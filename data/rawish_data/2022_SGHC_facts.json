{"casename":"2022_SGHC_1","fact":"'2\\u2003The plaintiff in Originating Summons No 335 of 2021 (\u201cOS 335\u201d) and the first defendant in Originating Summons No 745 of 2021 (\u201cOS 745\u201d) is Goldbell Engineering Pte Ltd (\u201cGoldbell\u201d). It is the employer of a project known as \u201cProposed Design and Erection of a 6-Storey Single-user Workshop with Ancillary Office on Lots 01642A & 01880P (Plot A) Mukim 07 at No. 8 and 10 Tuas Avenue 18 Singapore\u201d (\u201cthe Project\u201d). 1', '3\\u2003By a letter of award dated 19 April 2017, Goldbell entered into a $19m contract (\u201cthe Contract\u201d) with Range Construction Pte Ltd (\u201cRange\u201d) to appoint it as the Project\u2019s main contractor. 2', 'Range is the third party in OS 335 and the plaintiff in OS 745.', '4\\u2003Under the Contract, Range had an option of providing Goldbell with a cash deposit of 20% of the contract price, ie, $3.8 million, or a performance bond of that same amount, to secure the due performance of its contractual obligations. 3', 'Range opted to procure the issuance of a performance bond. This was duly issued by Etiqa Insurance Pte Ltd (\u201cEtiqa\u201d) in favour of Goldbell on 21 June 2017 (\u201cthe Bond\u201d). 4', 'Etiqa is the defendant in OS 335 and the second defendant in OS 745.', '5\\u2003Clause 4 of the Bond provided that it would expire upon the first of either (a) the original of the Bond being returned by Goldbell to Etiqa, accompanied by a written notice from Goldbell that it is to be cancelled, or (b) 30 November 2019, unless further renewed or extended by Etiqa in writing.', '6\\u2003Clause 1 of the Bond deals with the situation where Goldbell may make a call for payment under the Bond for sum or sums up to the maximum aggregate amount of $3.8m, which is the secured amount, and for Etiqa to make payment on an \u201con demand\u201d basis. Clause 1 provides: 5', '7\\u2003Clause 6 of the Bond, which was the main subject of contention in the various proceedings before me, both present and past, provides that: 6', '8\\u2003Hence, if Goldbell makes a request pursuant to cl 6 of the Bond for it to be extended, Etiqa may either extend the validity period of the Bond or, if Etiqa chooses not to so extend, pay the secured sum to Goldbell.', '9\\u2003The Project was beset by disputes between Goldbell and Range over the delay in the completion of the works and allegations of defective work which failed to comply with contractual requirements. The allegations of defective work included: the installation of electrical systems that were non-compliant with the contractual and statutory requirements, functional problems with the fire protection system which rendered it non-compliant with statutory requirements, water seepage issues caused by failure of waterproofing systems, poor workmanship that chronically plagued the Project, and unsatisfactory polyurethane flooring that was defective and failed to comply with contractual specifications. 7', 'In an affidavit filed for earlier proceedings, Goldbell claimed that all of these defects remained unrectified. 8', '10\\u2003The works were not completed by the contractual completion date of 7 September 2018, which had been extended from the initial contractual completion date of 31 August 2018. 9', 'Goldbell took the position that Range was in delay and that liquidated damages started to accrue from 8 September 2018 (inclusive) onwards. 10', 'Goldbell eventually took over the building in February 2019, but it claimed that this was without prejudice to its claim that the works were not completed in accordance with the Contract and that liquidated damages continued to accrue. 11', '11\\u2003Eventually, there was a meeting on 14 February 2019 between Mr William Chua, the chairman of the Goldbell group, and Mr Tan Yeow Khoon, the chairman of the Soon Hock Group (of which Range is a part), to discuss matters. 12', 'There is some evidence that, at this meeting, the two chairmen had agreed out of goodwill to fix the completion date on that day, ie 14 February 2019, so as to \u201cfreeze\u201d the accruing of liquidated damages due from Range, but on the condition that Range would expeditiously carry out rectification works for all outstanding defects. 13', '12\\u2003With the deemed completion date being 14 February 2019, Goldbell\u2019s case is that the maintenance period for the Project ran for its stipulated one year until 13 February 2020, according to the terms of the Contract. 14', 'At a meeting between Goldbell\u2019s and Range\u2019s representatives on 22 October 2019 (\u201cthe 22 Oct 2019 Meeting\u201d), it appears from the minutes of that meeting that there was a consensus between the two sides that the maintenance period was still ongoing, and that Range would follow up with the rectification of the defects during this period. 15', 'The minutes also recorded that Range had agreed to extend the validity period of the Bond, which was due to expire on 30 November 2019, to cover the length of the maintenance period, ie, until 13 February 2020. 16', '13\\u2003After the 22 Oct 2019 Meeting, Range followed up with its insurance brokers, Acorn International Network Pte Ltd (\u201cAcorn\u201d), to ask for the premium that was payable for an extension of the Bond\u2019s validity period to 13 February 2020. 17', 'Eventually, though, it appears that Range decided not to agree to any extension of the validity period of the Bond. It follows from this that Etiqa would not have extended the Bond\u2019s validity period, given that Etiqa would have had to obtain a fresh indemnity from Range before it would agree to any extension of the Bond.', '14\\u2003From 4 November 2019 to 25 November 2019, Goldbell chased Range to confirm that the Bond\u2019s validity period would be extended. 18', 'Save for an email reply from Range\u2019s representative Mr Dave Soh (\u201cMr Soh\u201d) sent on 4 November 2019 that he will \u201ccheck \u2026 and revert \u2026 [as soon as possible]\u201d, 19', 'Range subsequently did not respond to these chasers until 28 November 2019, when Mr Soh sent an email to Goldbell\u2019s representative Mr Vincent Teh in terms which Goldbell described as an obvious rejection of any notion that the Bond would be extended. 20', '15\\u2003On 29 November 2019, the day before the Bond was due to expire, Goldbell wrote to Etiqa to request for an extension of the Bond (\u201cthe Extension Request\u201d). 21', 'This was a short letter, which simply stated: 22', '16\\u2003On that same day, 29 November 2019, Range commenced Suit No 1235 of 2019 (\u201cSuit 1235\u201d) in the High Court against Goldbell and Etiqa. 23', 'At the same time, Range also filed an ex parte application for an interim injunction, which was supported by a 987-page affidavit from Mr Soh (\u201cMr Soh\u2019s Affidavit\u201d). 24', 'Range\u2019s counsel managed to get an urgent hearing before the duty judge at 5.00 pm that same day. A few hours\u2019 notice of the ex parte application was given to Goldbell.', '17\\u2003At the hearing before the duty judge, which was attended only by counsel for Range, counsel was able to convince the court of the need for the interim injunction. The duty judge, Andrew Ang SJ, thus ordered, inter alia, that (a) Goldbell was restrained from \u201crenewing or extending\u201d the validity of the Bond and from receiving any sum under the Bond, and (b) Etiqa was restrained from \u201crenewing or extending\u201d the validity of the Bond and from paying any sum under the Bond to Goldbell, pending the determination of Range\u2019s and Goldbell\u2019s liability towards each other under the Contract. 25', '18\\u2003As mentioned, Range had filed a writ of summons and commenced Suit 1235, instead of simply filing an originating summons as one might have expected. In Suit 1235, the relief sought was a permanent injunction to restrain Goldbell and Etiqa from extending or making payment under the Bond, pending the determination in arbitration of the substantive disputes between Goldbell and Range. 26', 'The basis of Range\u2019s relief was that the Extension Request was unconscionable and\/or fraudulent.', '19\\u2003Goldbell defended Suit 1235. It denied that the Extension Request was unconscionable or fraudulent. It claimed that it had a proper basis to make the Extension Request given that the maintenance period under the Contract was still ongoing. 27', 'As for Etiqa, it did not file any pleadings or otherwise participate in the action, as it claimed that the dispute was one between Goldbell and Range. Etiqa stated that it would abide by any orders made by the court. 28', '20\\u2003In spite of the \u201ccircuit-breaker\u201d period from April to June 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Suit 1235 proceeded expeditiously. By August 2020, the court had given directions for the trial dates for the suit to be fixed in March 2021. Parties were also due to file and exchange their affidavits of evidence-in-chief (\u201cAEICs\u201d) of both their factual and expert witnesses in December 2020.', '21\\u2003Then, on 21 September 2020, Goldbell filed its application in Summons No 4065 of 2020 (\u201cSUM 4065\u201d) to set aside the interim injunction. Goldbell also included in SUM 4065 a prayer for a declaration that Goldbell is entitled to be paid by Etiqa, and Etiqa is obliged to pay Goldbell, the sum of $3.8m (\u201cPrayer 2\u201d). SUM 4065 was fixed to be heard before me on 25 January 2021.', '22\\u2003On 23 October 2020, Goldbell also made an application in Summons No 4652 of 2020 (\u201cSUM 4652\u201d) for Range to provide security for costs for Suit 1235. This was on the basis that Range was allegedly insolvent. In its supporting affidavit for SUM 4652, Goldbell referred to Range\u2019s audited financial statements filed on 2 January 2020 (that it had obtained with the assistance of its solicitors) which indicated that Range had suffered losses in the financial year ending 30 June 2018, which were significantly in excess of its assets, and so Range was balance-sheet insolvent and current-asset insolvent. According to Goldbell, Range\u2019s auditors opined that this was a \u201cmaterial uncertainty which may cast significant doubt about [Range\u2019s] ability to continue as a going concern\u201d. 29', '23\\u2003Given that it was of the view that Range was insolvent, Goldbell also made an application in Summons No 4660 of 2020 (\u201cSUM 4660\u201d) for Range to fortify its undertaking to pay damages, which had been given when it applied for the interim injunction.', '24\\u2003Goldbell\u2019s application for security for costs was granted by an assistant registrar (\u201cAR\u201d), who ordered Range to furnish security in the amount of $250,000 for the costs of the action. Range filed Registrar\u2019s Appeal No 286 of 2020 (\u201cRA 286\u201d) against that decision. RA 286 was fixed together to be heard with SUM 4660. Both matters were heard by me on 2 December 2020.', '25\\u2003At the start of the hearing on 2 December 2020, lead counsel for Goldbell, Mr Jimmy Yim SC (\u201cMr Yim\u201d), informed me that he had obtained the oral confirmation of Etiqa\u2019s counsel, Mr Charles Phua (\u201cMr Phua\u201d), that Etiqa would be releasing the secured sum under the Bond, ie $3.8 million, to Goldbell, in the event that it was either successful in SUM 4065, which was Goldbell\u2019s application to set aside the interim injunction, or if Goldbell successfully defended Suit 1235. 30', 'Mr Yim had also written to the court earlier that same day (2 December 2020) to enclose an exchange of correspondence between himself and Mr Phua regarding Etiqa\u2019s position on the Bond. 31', 'Mr Yim also stated that this would have some impact on Goldbell\u2019s application for fortification of Range\u2019s undertaking to pay damages in SUM 4660. 32', '26\\u2003As neither Mr Phua nor any other counsel acting for Etiqa was present at the hearing on 2 December 2020, and because I was of the view that Etiqa\u2019s position on the Extension Request was relevant to Goldbell\u2019s application to set aside the interim injunction, I thus directed Goldbell and Range to inform Mr Phua to attend the hearing for the setting aside application, 33', 'which was scheduled for 25 January 2021.', '27\\u2003Counsel then proceeded with their arguments for the various matters fixed before me on 2 December 2020.', '28\\u2003For the arguments on RA 286, which was Range\u2019s appeal against the order that it furnish security for costs for Suit 1235, counsel for Range, Mr Tan Chee Meng SC (\u201cMr Tan\u201d), argued that the AR had erred in exercising her discretion to order security for costs. Mr Tan made some submissions that there was insufficient evidence to show that Range was insolvent. I was not impressed with these arguments.', '29\\u2003What was more persuasive, however, was Mr Tan\u2019s main argument in RA 286 that, since Goldbell would be assured that the sum of $3.8m would be paid under the Bond if it were to succeed in defending Suit 1235, the court should not exercise its discretion to order any security for costs, even if the court was of the view that Range was insolvent. This is because Goldbell was more than adequately secured. In this regard, Mr Tan specifically referred to Etiqa\u2019s confirmation, through Mr Phua, and as conveyed to the court by Mr Yim earlier, that it would pay the sum of $3.8m under the Bond to Goldbell if the application to set aside the interim injunction succeeded, or if Suit 1235 was eventually dismissed. 34', '30\\u2003When I queried Mr Tan whether, if the interim injunction was set aside, Range might make the argument some lesser sum than $3.8m should be paid by Etiqa under the Bond, instead of the full secured sum of $3.8m, his reply to me was: \u201cIt\u2019s all or nothing as far as we are concerned and I can state that firmly as our position, alright\u201d. 35', 'Mr Tan also confirmed that Range would not take any objection to the payment of $3.8m by Etiqa to Goldbell, even if the court found that Goldbell\u2019s claims against Range under the Project fell below $3.8m, and even if Goldbell was seeking to apply the difference to the payment of legal costs of Suit 1235. 36', 'Mr Tan was quite emphatic; he stated: \u201cI honestly cannot see why the issue of [$3.8m] is limited to damages and [liquidated damages]\u201d. 37', '31\\u2003Mr Christopher Chong (\u201cMr Chong\u201d), who appeared with Mr Yim, was counsel who made the oral arguments for Goldbell for RA 286. Given the unequivocal position taken by Mr Tan that Goldbell\u2019s claims under the Project and its legal costs if it succeeded in Suit 1235 were fully secured by sum of $3.8m, Mr Chong had to accept in the course of his submissions that: \u201cif Mr Tan holds that position \u2026 in that sense we are secured for the money\u201d. 38', '32\\u2003Given the position taken by both counsel, and with their consent, I deferred my decision on RA 286, until 25 January 2021, which had been fixed as the date for the hearing of SUM 4065, when I could hear directly from Etiqa\u2019s counsel as to whether Etiqa would indeed make payment of the secured sum of $3.8m to Goldbell if the interim injunction was indeed set aside or if Suit 1235 was dismissed. 39', 'In the meantime, I granted a stay on the order by the AR that security was to be provided by Range.', '33\\u2003Counsel then turned their attention to SUM 4660, which was Goldbell\u2019s application for fortification of Range\u2019s undertaking in support of the interim injunction. Mr Yim, on behalf of Goldbell, submitted that it had been fully justified in filing the application for fortification of Range\u2019s undertaking to the court to pay damages, given the evidence that had recently become available about Range\u2019s precarious financial position. 40', 'However, given Mr Phua\u2019s confirmation to him that Etiqa would pay on the Bond if the interim injunction was set aside, or if Suit 1235 was dismissed, Mr Yim accepted that it was no longer necessary for Goldbell to pursue the application for fortification. 41', 'Thus, the only issue before me was the question of costs.', '34\\u2003Mr Tan, on behalf of Range, argued, inter alia, that Goldbell should have clarified with Etiqa much earlier as to the latter\u2019s position on the Bond. He argued that Goldbell should have checked with Etiqa before taking out the application for fortification and, if that had been done, the application would not have been necessary. Since the application had been needlessly taken out by Goldbell, Mr Tan argued that it should pay for Range\u2019s \u201ccosts thrown away\u201d. 42', '35\\u2003 In response, Mr Yim suggested that I hold back my decision on the costs of the application for fortification until the next hearing on 25 January 2021, when I could hear directly from Mr Phua on Etiqa\u2019s position. 43', 'That would also allow Goldbell to confirm its stand that there was no need for any requirement of fortification given that Etiqa would pay on the Bond if the interim injunction was eventually set aside. Mr Tan agreed to this suggestion. 44', 'As such, I deferred my decision on the costs of SUM 4660 until 25 January 2021.', '36\\u2003Parties appeared before me on 25 January 2021, which was the date fixed for the hearing of SUM 4065, ie, Goldbell\u2019s application to set aside the interim injunction.', '37\\u2003Mr Phua attended the hearing as counsel for Etiqa. At the start of the hearing, I called upon Mr Phua to inform the court of Etiqa\u2019s position. I reproduce the relevant excerpt from the transcript of the hearing below: 45', '38\\u2003Hence, it is quite clear that Etiqa had, through its counsel, undertaken to the court that, if the interim injunction was set aside, it would make payment of the secured sum of $3.8m under the Bond to Goldbell pursuant to the Extension Request which it had made on 29 November 2019.', '39\\u2003On that basis, I subsequently allowed Range\u2019s appeal in RA 286 against the AR\u2019s decision to order security for costs. I discharged the order that Range had to pay security for the costs of Suit 1235 in the amount of $250,000. I also granted leave to Goldbell to withdraw its application in SUM 4660 for fortification of Range\u2019s undertaking, with no order as to costs.', '40\\u2003On 25 January 2021, I also heard Goldbell and Range on their respective cases as to whether the interim injunction should be set aside. The application in SUM 4065 presented three main issues for me to decide. The first was whether it had been unconscionable for Goldbell to have made the Extension Request on 29 November 2019. The second was whether Goldbell had behaved fraudulently by issuing the Extension Request. The third was whether Range had been guilty of failure to make full and frank disclosure when it applied for the interim injunction on an ex parte basis. The arguments took a full day, after which I reserved judgment.', '41\\u2003 I gave my decision on the application to set aside the interim injunction by way of an oral judgment, which I delivered on 18 February 2021 (\u201cJudgment\u201d). 46', '42\\u2003I rejected the arguments made by Range that the Extension Request was in truth a call on the Bond in full (see Judgment at [5]). In my view, all Goldbell had done was to request for an extension of the Bond\u2019s validity period until 13 February 2020. This was in accordance with the terms of cl 6 of the Bond, which granted Goldbell the contractual right \u2013 as between itself and Etiqa \u2013 to \u201cbe at liberty to demand at any time \u2026 that [Etiqa] either extend the validity period of [the Bond] or, in lieu of such extension by [Etiqa], make payment forthwith\u201d. It was then up to Etiqa to choose to decide whether to extend, or make payment of that secured sum to Goldbell, which would then be held as security by Goldbell until the end of the maintenance period. As such, I could not agree with Range\u2019s argument that Goldbell had made a call on the Bond via the Extension Request.', '43\\u2003I also did not accept Range\u2019s arguments that Goldbell had acted fraudulently or unconscionably (see Judgment at [13]). On the strength of the affidavit evidence before me, there was support for Goldbell\u2019s case that the completion date had been agreed with Range to be on 14 February 2019 so as to \u201cfreeze\u201d the accruing of liquidated damages due from Range for the delay in the completion of the Project. This agreement was subject to the condition that Range would expeditiously carry out rectification of all outstanding defects (see [11] above). There was therefore some basis for Goldbell\u2019s belief that the maintenance period for the Project ran from 14 February 2019 to 13 February 2020, according to cl 20.1 read with Appendix 1 of the \u201cREDAS Design and Build Conditions of Main Contract\u201d, which was incorporated as part of the Contract\u2019s terms. 47', '44\\u2003Goldbell also referred to the minutes of the 22 Oct 2019 Meeting (see [12] above), where there appeared to be consensus between Goldbell and Range that the maintenance period was still ongoing, and that was why Range stated at the meeting that it was prepared to procure an extension of the Bond. Under the terms of the Contract between Range and Goldbell, the Bond was required to remain in place until one month after the completion of the maintenance period. It was also disclosed in the affidavits that, subsequent to the meeting of 22 October 2019, Range had approached Acorn, its insurance brokers, to ask for the premium that was payable to Etiqa for an extension of the Bond\u2019s validity period to 13 February 2020 (see [13] above). This extended validity date was the same as that in the Extension Request made by Goldbell on 29 November 2019. Those facts lent credence to Goldbell\u2019s arguments that the parties had indeed agreed to extend the Bond\u2019s validity period until the end of the maintenance period (see Judgment at [14]).', '45\\u2003I also noted that it was not open to Range to argue that the maintenance period had ended sometime in September 2019 because the Project had been completed in September 2018 (see Judgment at [15]). This was because of adjudication proceedings between Goldbell and Range that took place after the grant of the interim injunction. In SOP\/AA 180 of 2020 (\u201cSOP 180\u201d) determined on 28 July 2020, 48', 'the adjudicator determined that the maintenance period for the project ended either on 14 February 2020 or 22 March 2020 as the handing over certificate (\u201cHOC\u201d) ought to have been issued by Goldbell on 14 February 2019 or 22 March 2019, and not at an earlier time in 2018 as claimed by Range. In SOP\/ARA 8 of 2020 (\u201cARA 8\u201d) determined on 1 September 2020, 49', 'which was an adjudication review lodged in respect of the determination in AA 180, the review panel found that the maintenance period expired on 22 March 2020, as the HOC should have been issued on 22 March 2019.', '46\\u2003There was no question that Goldbell and Range were bound by this determination because of s 21(1) of the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act (Cap 30B, 2006 Rev Ed). Under that section, the binding effect of an adjudication determination on the parties includes a form of issue estoppel binding the parties in relation to the issues determined by the adjudicator, as the Court of Appeal confirmed in Samsung C&T Corp v Soon Li Heng Civil Engineering Pte Ltd [2020] 2 SLR 955 (at [58]).', '47\\u2003In relation to the status of the defects in the Project, I stated as follows (see Judgment at [22]-[24]):', 'In short, I noted that there were claims and counterclaims between Goldbell and Range about defects and delay. The claims by Goldbell were substantial, and I was of the view that these issues between the parties should be fully and finally resolved in the ongoing arbitration proceedings.', '48\\u2003In sum, I was not convinced by Range\u2019s arguments that the high threshold of showing fraud or unconscionability has been demonstrated.', '49\\u2003Aside from the above, I also accepted Goldbell\u2019s arguments that Range had not made full and frank disclosure of all material facts in its possession when it appeared before the duty judge on 29 November 2019 to argue its application for the interim injunction (see Judgment at [38]). It is trite that an ex parte applicant has a duty to make full and frank disclosure of all material facts in its possession at the time of the application. Any fact which the court should take into consideration in making its decision is material (see The \u201cVasiliy Golovnin\u201d [2008] 4 SLR(R) 994 (\u201cVasiliy Golovnin\u201d) at [86]). This duty of full and frank disclosure extends as well to defences that might be reasonably raised by the defendant (Vasiliy Golovnin at [87]). Mere disclosure of material facts and documents without more or devoid of the proper context is also insufficient; it is for the applicant\u2019s counsel to draw the judge\u2019s attention to them in a fair manner (Vasiliy Golovnin at [91]-[94]).', '50\\u2003Upon a review of Mr Soh\u2019s Affidavit (see [16] above), which Range filed in support of its ex parte application for the interim injunction, counsel\u2019s written submissions and the notes of hearing before the duty judge, I found that Range had not set out fairly Goldbell\u2019s side of the story in relation to the maintenance period, ie that there was an \u201cin principle\u201d agreement to deem completion as having taken place on 14 February 2019, and that the maintenance period was thus still ongoing until 13 February 2020. This was despite Range recognising that the maintenance period issue was material to the question of whether there was a proper request to extend the validity period of the Bond. Counsel for Range also omitted to highlight to the duty judge the relevant contractual clauses which obliged Range to maintain the validity of the Bond until the end of the maintenance period.', '51\\u2003I also found that certain critical documents were not disclosed in Mr Soh\u2019s Affidavit. Chief amongst these was the minutes of the 22 Oct 2019 Meeting. Those minutes record at para 2.1.11 that Range \u201cis prepared to extend the Bond \u2026 and will discuss further with [Goldbell] and [Etiqa]\u201d. In his oral arguments before me, Mr Tan, on behalf of Range, had candidly acknowledged that these minutes were material, and that it might have been an oversight that the document was not disclosed (see Judgment at [35]).', '52\\u2003I also found it significant that Mr Soh\u2019s Affidavit did not disclose a WhatsApp message from Mr ES Tang, the quantity surveyor for the Project, dated 15 November 2019, reminding Mr Soh to get the Bond extended because at the \u201clast meeting [referring to the 22 Oct 2019 Meeting] [he] mentioned he will extend [the Bond]\u201d (see Judgment at [36]). Further, while a series of email exchanges from 24 September to 28 November 2019 between Range\u2019s staff and its insurance broker, Acorn, was exhibited to Mr Soh\u2019s Affidavit (which ran to 987 pages), there was no reference or mention of these email exchanges with Acorn at all in the main body of Mr Soh\u2019s Affidavit. I was of the view that Range\u2019s counsel ought to have specifically highlighted to the duty judge that these email exchanges indicated that Range had initially considered extending the Bond until 13 February 2020, and explained why that was the case (see Judgment at [36]).

The fourth defendant was waiting there with police officers and a security guard. The fourth defendant demanded the return of the keys to the Studio Unit. The plaintiff requested to return to the Studio Unit to take her cheque book to make payment of outstanding rent. The fourth defendant refused. The policemen who were there told the plaintiff that she had no right to go into the premises without permission.

The fourth defendant called the police and waited at the guardhouse of My Manhattan. The fourth defendant requested one of the security guards to look for the plaintiff and to bring her to the guardhouse. At about 10.40pm, a security guard went to look for the plaintiff. The security guard returned and said he could not find her. The fourth defendant went to the lift lobby of Blk 29 of My Manhattan, where the Studio Unit was, and saw the plaintiff come out of the lift. At Blk 31 of My Manhattan, the fourth defendant served the plaintiff with the SCT summons. The security guard suggested that they move to the carpark. The police spoke to the plaintiff. The plaintiff made a phone call. The security guard tried to advise the plaintiff to leave to keep the peace. The plaintiff handed over her keys and access cards to the security guard.

He also reminded her that she could use her access card to enter. She then hung up. He denies having told the plaintiff to go to the guardhouse. He was not around at the time of the confrontation between the plaintiff and the fourth defendant that night. He later found out that the plaintiff had returned the access cards and keys to the security guard, who had then passed them to the fourth defendant. 20', '17\\u2003On 23 May 2019, the plaintiff transferred $4,600 to the account of the first and fourth defendants.

Nevertheless, it was not disputed that KSE had received these quotations. 15', '10\\u2003KSE claims that, upon receiving the First 4 February 2020 Quotation, Mr Lee informed Mr Nam that this quotation was unacceptable. KSE allegedly took issue with how the rental rate of the equipment was calculated: it wanted the rate to be calculated by the volume of work done rather than by the time rented. 16', 'KSE claims that this was the reason that the Second 4 February 2020 Quotation was sent on the same day. As stated above (at [8]), the Second 4 February 2020 Quotation stipulated a unit rate of S$1.90\/m3 of sand transported for an estimated guaranteed quantity of 1,000,000m3. It was therefore premised on a volume-based rate (ie, cost per cubic metre of sand). In contrast, both the 30 August 2019 Quotation and the First 4 February 2020 Quotation provided for the supply and rental of equipment and manpower, calculated on a time-based rate (ie, cost per unit of time). 17', '11\\u2003According to KSE, after receiving the Second 4 February 2020 Quotation, Mr Lee submitted the rate of S$1.90\/m3 for an estimated guaranteed quantity of 1,000,000m3 18', 'to Hyundai, the main contractor of the Project. 19', 'Hyundai explained to Mr Lee that the rate was too high and negotiated for a rate of S$1.70\/m3.

Mr Lee also allegedly told Mr Nam that Chuan Lim Construction Pte Ltd (\u201cChuan Lim\u201d) had offered a rate of S$1.45\/m3 for the same works. Mr Lee, therefore, proposed to Mr Nam for the transportation of the sand at a rate of S$1.50\/m3 (the \u201cAgreed Volume Rate\u201d) and Mr Nam orally agreed (the \u201cAlleged Oral Agreement\u201d). Hence, the Alleged Oral Agreement was concluded shortly after the Second 4 February 2020 Quotation was rejected.', '12\\u2003Backho denies that the Alleged Oral Agreement was concluded for the transportation of sand at a rate of S$1.50\/m3. 21', 'Hence, Backho continued to perform its obligations under the previously concluded contract as evidenced by the 30 August 2019 Quotation and the First 4 February 2020 Quotation: it continued to supply KSE the stipulated equipment and manpower at the rates set out in those two quotations for the period of September 2019 to November 2019. 22', '13\\u2003KSE claims that although the Alleged Oral Agreement was concluded, it nevertheless agreed out of goodwill to pay Backho on time-based rates for a limited period of time. 23', '14\\u2003KSE claims that on or around 20 March 2020, Backho started the sand transportation works in accordance with the Alleged Oral Agreement. However, due to the Circuit Breaker and COVID-19 measures, Backho\u2019s work did not continue for long and it had to discontinue its sand transportation works from 6 April 2020 to 19 September 2020. 24', '15\\u2003When the works started on or around 20 March 2020, the dredging volume was very low during that period. There was not enough volume of sand to be transported to justify using Backho\u2019s equipment on site. KSE then agreed, out of goodwill, to pay using time-based rates for a very limited duration. 25', '16\\u2003When the works resumed in September 2020, after the lifting of the Circuit Breaker, KSE informed Backho that the previous payments using time-based rates would no longer apply since Backho had previously been paid only because of the issues with the low dredging quantity at that time. 26', '17\\u2003However, as the works had just resumed after the COVID-19 restrictions earlier, the dredged quantity was still low in late September. Based on further discussions between the parties in September 2020, KSE agreed to pay Backho using time-based rates for the rental of equipment from 20 September 2020 to the end of October 2020. KSE explained that this was because the works commenced from 20 September 2020, and it would take some time for Backho to mobilise its equipment before actually carrying out its works. If the works were charged on a volume basis, Backho would have earned significantly less revenue. Hence, KSE claims that it made payments to Backho on time-based rates purely out of goodwill, in view of the slower dredging works caused by the impact of the COVID-19 measures. In this way, Backho could still earn reasonable revenue in the interim. 27', '18\\u2003KSE claims that it informed Backho that starting from 1 November 2020, KSE would revert to paying Backho based on the previously Agreed Volume Rate of S$1.50\/m3 pursuant to the Alleged Oral Agreement. 28', 'KSE maintains that the Alleged Oral Agreement exists as Backho issued Progress Claim No 1 dated 5 January 2021 (\u201cProgress Claim 1\u201d) using a volume-based rate for work done in November and December 2020. 29', '19\\u2003KSE claims that Backho abandoned the contract on or around 14 February 2021. 30', 'Backho denies this allegation and claims that it was KSE that wrongfully repudiated their contract. 31', '20\\u2003Subsequently, on 27 February 2021, Backho issued a total of six invoices using a time-based rate under the 30 August 2019 Quotation and the First 4 February 2020 Quotation for work done in November 2020, December 2020, and January 2021. 32', '21\\u2003On 31 May 2021, Backho served on KSE a payment claim, \u201cPayment Claim Reference No. 2\u201d for work done from 30 August 2019 to 31 May 2020 (\u201cPayment Claim 2\u201d). 33', 'The sum claimed therein was $1,102,042.21.', '22\\u2003On 14 June 2021, KSE served its Payment Certificate in response to Payment Claim 2. 34', 'In it, KSE stated as follows: 35', '23\\u2003On 25 June 2021, Backho then lodged AA 165 based on KSE\u2019s non-payment in respect of Payment Claim 2. 36', 'In the adjudication proceedings, KSE argued, inter alia, that there was no \u201ccontract that [was] made in writing\u201d under s 4(3) of the SOPA, for two reasons: 37', '(a)\\u2003First, KSE submitted that the 30 August 2019 Quotation and the First 4 February 2020 Quotation were not signed by KSE because the terms of payment were not agreed to by KSE.', '(b)\\u2003Second, KSE contended that the parties had instead entered into an oral agreement \u201csome time in February 2020\u201d for work to be done by Backho at a volume-based rate of S$1.50\/m3 of sand transported.

MB initially offered \nShaffy a job to deliver tobacco. Around May 2018, MB requested Shaffy to \ndeliver a different item (\u201cthe Stuff\u201d) which MB did not specify but Shaffy \nsuspected were drugs as it was always sealed in blue tape. He would collect the \nStuff in the vicinity of Jurong Bird Park (\u201cJBP\u201d) and send them to Boon Lay \nMall or an address at MacPherson. On the second occasion he delivered the \nStuff, he became suspicious and asked MB about its contents and MB informed \nhim that he was transporting pills and said it was nothing serious. MB gave the \ncontact of a Malaysian person, \u201cM2\u201d, to Shaffy and instructed Shaffy to place \norders for the Stuff directly with M2. Shaffy would then place orders with M2 \non MB\u2019s instructions, and M2 would inform Shaffy when to collect the Stuff.20\n19 Defence\u2019s Reply Submissions dated 28 March 2022 (\u201cDWS2\u201d) at [3(ii)]; 10\/2\/22 NE \n23\u201324; 15\/2\/22 NE 3, 12. \n20 AB 195\u2013196 (5th Statement at [12]\u2013[15], [19]); 15\/2\/22 NE 45, 49\u201350, 95. \nVersion No 1: 13 May 2022 (17:03 hrs)\nPP v Mohammad Shaffy bin Hassan[2022] SGHC 111\n921  On 19 June 2018, MB instructed Shaffy to order \u201c2 packets\u201d.

Shaffy then sent a WhatsApp message to M2 saying, \u201ctomorrow 2\u201d.21 \n22 On 20 June 2018, at about 7.00am, M2 sent a WhatsApp message to \nShaffy to say that that his order was ready for collection. That evening, Shaffy \nproceeded to JBP and collected a plastic bag (\u201cPlastic Bag\u201d) which was white. \nHe then sent a WhatsApp message, \u201cDone boss\u201d, to M2 at about 11.07pm to \nsay that he had collected the goods.22\n23 Shaffy intended to deliver one packet to \u201cWak\u201d (who was MB\u2019s \ncustomer for drugs) at Boon Lay Mall and another packet to \u201cScar\u201d at \nMacPherson, after collecting the Plastic Bag. It was not disputed that Scar is \none Mohamed Hanafiah (\u201cHanafiah\u201d). Shaffy called Wak twice but Wak did \nnot answer the phone. He then called Hanafiah who said that he could not collect \nthe goods that day. Shaffy then brought the Plastic Bag home. He did not wish \nto leave it at JBP as he was afraid the goods would go missing.23 \n24 After bringing the Plastic Bag home, Shaffy went out and returned to the \nUnit at about 4.00am on 21 June 2018. He then opened the Plastic Bag and \ndiscovered two big bundles wrapped in black tape and one small bundle \nwrapped in blue tape. He felt something was wrong as he had only ordered two \nbundles of drugs, previously the bundles were wrapped in blue tape, and the \nblue bundle which he received this time had an unusual texture.

He left the remaining bundle (Exhibit A1A1) intact. When \nhe saw the contents of Exhibits A1A2 and A1A3 were brown, he suspected they \nwere heroin (or diamorphine). He knew heroin was powdery as he had \npreviously seen white heroin and consumed heroin. He also knew that ecstasy \nwas in the form of pills. As he suspected the drugs to be heroin, he removed a \npacket from Exhibit A1A3 (which bundle contained a few packets), smelt it, \nsmashed that packet on the outside to make the contents powdery, then took a \nbit of the powder, placed it on a foil and burnt and smoked it. That was when he \nwas sure it was heroin.24 \n25 In the process of smashing the small packet, Shaffy damaged it. He thus \ntransferred its contents into a new plastic packet (which could have been Exhibit \nA1A3B) and placed that packet into Exhibit A1A3. This would explain the \nanalysis by Cheryl Tan from the HSA, who found Exhibit A1A3B and various \nplastic packets from Exhibits B2A and C1E (seized from the Unit) to have been \nmanufactured by the same machine and come from the same source.25 \n26 At about 4.26pm on 21 June 2018, Shaffy received a call from one \n\u201cDanny\u201d who asked if he was going to Haig Road where they would usually \nhang out. Shaffy asked Danny if MB would be at Haig Road and told Danny \nthat he wanted to meet MB to discuss something. Shaffy wanted to meet MB \nand \u201cdo the exchange\u201d of bundles because Shaffy was supposed to have \nreceived two bundles of ecstasy pills but he had received three bundles of \nheroin.

After \nplacing Exhibit A1A into his Gucci bag (Exhibit A1), he left the Unit at about \n7.00pm to fetch Umi (with the Gucci bag in the Car) and they headed towards \nthe east of Singapore for a meal. That was when he was subsequently arrested.27\n28 Shaffy admitted that he had ever consumed heroin, \u201cice\u201d and ecstasy \npills.

{"casename":"2022_SGHC_113","fact":"'3\\u2003MEA Business Solutions Pte Ltd (\u201cMEA\u201d) was a corporate secretarial company that was owned and operated by Vadim, a Russian businessman. MEA was incorporated in February 2014 and ceased to exist as a legal entity after it was amalgamated with Intracorp Pte Ltd in January 2019. MEA\u2019s primary business was to assist its foreign clients to incorporate companies and open bank accounts in Singapore: GD at [13]. As part of MEA\u2019s services, Vadim also provided Singapore nominee directors for the companies that MEA incorporated for its clients. The nominee directors received instructions from the foreign clients of MEA through Vadim and were not involved in the operations of the companies. The responsibilities of the nominee directors included assisting MEA to (a) incorporate the companies, and (b) open bank accounts in the names of the companies.', '4\\u2003Vadim\u2019s pool of nominee directors included Andruew, a part time wrestler, actor and personal fitness instructor. Andruew became acquainted with Vadim in 2011 through their mutual interest in wrestling. Sometime in 2014, Andruew agreed to be a nominee director in order to supplement his income. As was the case with the other nominee directors that MEA engaged, Andruew\u2019s involvement was limited to incorporating companies and opening the relevant bank accounts. For his services as a nominee director, Andruew was paid between $750 and $1,300 per company upon appointment, and an additional $750 per company for each year his directorship was renewed. Between 2014 and 2016, Andruew acted as a nominee director for more than 50 companies incorporated by MEA.', '5\\u2003The manner in which the bank accounts of the three companies (that were the subject matter of the charges the appellants faced) were opened merits further elaboration. I begin with a summary of the key details of the three companies (\u201cthe Companies\u201d) and their respective bank accounts (each a \u201cBank Account\u201d and collectively, \u201cthe Bank Accounts\u201d):', '(a)\\u2003On 10 September 2014, Evoque Capital Corp Pte Ltd (\u201cEvoque\u201d) was incorporated, with Andruew as its sole shareholder and director. Evoque opened a bank account with Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Limited (\u201cOCBC\u201d) on 11 September 2014.', '(b)\\u2003On 19 September 2014, Babo Group Pte Ltd (\u201cBabo\u201d) was incorporated, with Andruew as its sole shareholder and director. Babo opened a bank account with OCBC on 3 October 2014.', '(c)\\u2003On 16 May 2016, Sensetec Pte Ltd (\u201cSensetec\u201d) was incorporated, with Andruew as its sole shareholder and director. Sensetec opened a bank account with Maybank Singapore Limited (\u201cMaybank\u201d) on 17 May 2016.', 'For ease of reference, I shall refer to OCBC and Maybank collectively as \u201cthe Banks\u201d.', '6\\u2003The Banks followed a similar due diligence process for the opening of the Bank Accounts. This due diligence process was put in place to comply with Notice 626 dated 30 November 2015 (\u201cthe Notice\u201d) issued by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (\u201cthe MAS\u201d). The Notice was a direction to banks issued pursuant to s 27B of the Monetary Authority of Singapore Act (Cap 186, 1999 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe Act\u201d) to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing. I will elaborate further on the background to the Notice later in these grounds at [30]\u2013[40]. It is helpful to reproduce s 27B of the Act to understand the objective of the section and the context of the Notice:', '7\\u2003Pursuant to measures that were put in place to comply with the Notice, the Banks required Andruew to complete and submit several documents before opening the Bank Accounts. This included an account opening form and the relevant supporting documents. The Banks were required to perform a customer due diligence (\u201cCDD\u201d) process on their customers as part of their \u201cKnow-Your-Client\u201d (\u201cKYC\u201d) measures, based on the information disclosed in the account opening form and the supporting documents. The CDD process was one of the core obligations the Notice imposed on the Banks in order to combat money laundering and terrorism financing. The truthfulness of the information that was disclosed was therefore critical. One of the crucial pieces of information that Andruew was required to disclose was a declaration of the UBO of each of the Bank Accounts (each a \u201cDeclaration\u201d and collectively, \u201cthe Declarations\u201d). The identification and verification of the UBO was a specific requirement under paragraphs 6.13 to 6.17 of the Notice, and the Declarations was specifically sought for this purpose. It is relevant that the account opening forms for all the Bank Accounts stated that the Banks were \u201centitled to rely on [the] declaration above on the identity(ies) of and information relating to the Beneficial Owner(s) of the Account\u201d.', '8\\u2003In this regard, Andruew declared to OCBC that he was the UBO of Evoque and Babo and to Maybank that he was the UBO of the bank account to be opened for Sensetec. The Declarations were in fact not true. The real UBOs of the Companies were MEA\u2019s foreign clients who were not disclosed to the Banks at the time the Bank Accounts were opened or subsequently.', '9\\u2003As noted at [7] above, Andruew was also required to attach supporting documents on the Companies relating to the Declarations. These included the Companies\u2019 Memorandum and Articles of Association and documents from the Accounting and Corporate Authority (\u201cACRA\u201d): GD at [17]. Notably, the supporting documents Andruew attached also did not disclose the true identities of the UBOs. Again, Andruew made no effort to state the correct facts at any time.', '10\\u2003Based on the information in the account opening forms, including the Declarations, and the supporting documents, the Banks carried out a series of checks on the Companies and Andruew using their internal platforms for any adverse reports: GD at [17]. On the strength of the Declarations and supporting documents, the Banks\u2019 checks were concluded with no adverse report on the Companies or Andruew: GD at [17]. The Bank Accounts were thus opened for the Companies on the basis that Andruew was the UBO. The Banks were accordingly misled into believing that Andruew was the UBO of the Companies.', '11\\u2003It was undisputed that at all material times, including during the process of opening the Bank Accounts and making the Declarations, Andruew acted entirely on Vadim\u2019s instructions. The information that Andruew provided to the Banks was given to him by Vadim based on instructions from MEA\u2019s foreign clients. Once the Companies were incorporated and the Bank Accounts opened, Andruew\u2019s involvement ended. He transferred control of the Companies and Bank Accounts to MEA\u2019s foreign clients with Vadim preparing either a declaration of trust or a transfer of shares: GD at [14]. Andruew consequently handed over to Vadim the bank tokens issued by the Banks for the Bank Accounts, and was not aware of any transactions that were thereafter undertaken.', '12\\u2003The appellants initially faced four charges under s 417 read with s 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe Penal Code\u201d). However, at the close of the Prosecution\u2019s case, a material witness in relation to one set of charges was overseas and unable to attend the trial. Thus, the Prosecution withdrew that charge: GD at [2]. As noted earlier at [1], Andruew and Vadim were convicted on the three remaining charges and sentenced to two weeks\u2019 and four weeks\u2019 imprisonment respectively. I set out the three charges for ease of reference.', '13\\u2003At trial, the Prosecution\u2019s case was that all the elements of the charge under s 417 of the Penal Code as well as the element of conspiracy between the appellants were made out. They sought to prove the following cumulative elements:', '14\\u2003The appellants disputed each of these elements at trial. Their arguments were dealt with in the reasoning of the District Court Judge (\u201cthe Judge\u201d), which I now turn to.'"}

At that time, the respondent was sharing a room with another lawyer, and no longer worked in the open office space with V. Shortly after, at about 8pm, the respondent returned to V\u2019s cubicle alone. Knowing that V would be alone, he had decided to take some compromising photographs of V, ostensibly to ease his stressful state. V was seated facing her computer. The respondent approached V from behind and leaned over her on the pretext of reading her computer screen. V allowed the respondent to do so as she thought he was trying to get a closer look at her computer screen. The respondent asked V what she was working on, and she said she was working on a set of legal submissions.', '8\\u2003The respondent then rested his body on the back rest of V\u2019s chair. He could see her brassiere, which was exposed because the neckline of her dress was loose. He took the opportunity not only to keep looking at her brassiere through the loose neckline, but also to take some photographs of her chest and brassiere so that he could view these later. The respondent held his handphone in his right hand and positioned it downwards over V\u2019s right shoulder. He then used his handphone to take several photographs of V\u2019s chest and brassiere.', '9\\u2003The respondent then went back to his room and viewed the photographs he had taken. He was sexually aroused and decided to take some more compromising photographs of V. A few minutes later, he returned to V\u2019s cubicle and again asked her what she was working on, to which she repeated her earlier reply that she was working on a set of legal submissions. The respondent proceeded surreptitiously to take several photographs of V\u2019s panties before leaving abruptly.', '10\\u2003The respondent then returned to his room, where he viewed all the photographs he had taken of V before deleting them.', '11\\u2003On 11 October 2017, V, who by then was a legal associate in the First Law Firm, was having lunch alone in her room in the First Law Firm. At around 2.30pm, the respondent entered her room and closed the door behind him. He sat on the floor to V\u2019s right while V sat at her desk.', '12\\u2003The respondent struck up a conversation with V, asking her what she was eating. V then swivelled her chair to the right to face the respondent. V was wearing a dress that was slightly above knee level. When seated, the hem of her dress was at the mid-thigh level. The respondent saw that V\u2019s legs were slightly apart and he could see in between them. He became sexually aroused and decided to take some upskirt photographs of V. The respondent was holding his handphone in his hand, and he pointed the camera lens in the direction of V\u2019s thighs. V noticed this and swivelled her chair back to face her desk with her legs underneath it.', '13\\u2003The respondent continued talking to V in order to get her to turn towards him again. He asked if he could see what she was having for lunch. V then swivelled her chair towards him and showed him her lunch. Her legs were directly in front of the respondent, and the respondent was still holding on to his handphone with the camera lens facing V\u2019s legs. V again swivelled back to face her desk.', '14\\u2003The respondent again asked V to show him her lunch, and she swivelled her chair to face him once more. The respondent was still holding on to his handphone with the camera lens facing V\u2019s legs.', '15\\u2003During this sequence of events, the respondent took several photographs of V\u2019s panties using his handphone.', '16\\u2003When V crossed her legs, the respondent asked her whether it was painful for females to sit cross-legged for too long, and how long she could sit in that way. He then stood up and walked towards V\u2019s desk. He rested his buttocks on her desk and struck up another conversation with V. He subsequently pressed his thigh against her upper arm. Thereafter, the respondent returned to his room to view the upskirt photographs he had taken of V, before deleting them.', '17\\u2003About a month later, on 7 November 2017, V lodged a police report stating that a male colleague had outraged her modesty. On 15 November 2017, the respondent resigned from the First Law Firm.', '18\\u2003According to V\u2019s Victim Impact Statement in the criminal proceedings, after she reported the matter to the police, the respondent started contacting V with a view to getting her to withdraw her complaint against him. The respondent told V the case would hurt his mother who was very sick, and he even threatened to commit suicide. The respondent also shared his suicidal thoughts with some of their colleagues, intending that they convey this to V. The respondent also enlisted the help of their colleagues to let him know whether V was in the office, and to deliver letters to her on his behalf.', '19\\u2003On 4 June 2020, V recorded a Victim Impact Statement, where she described the \u201cimmediate emotional effect\u201d of the offences, the \u201cemotional toll of proceeding\u201d against the respondent, and \u201cthe longer-term emotional effect of the offences\u201d.

They told Chan that the respondent was \u201coutstationed\u201d [sic], and that they did not know when he would return to Singapore.

However, he \nnoted that it was not so severe as to impair the appellant\u2019s judgment of \nthe nature of his acts or his ability to resist his actions. Conversely, Dr \nTan assessed the severity of the appellant\u2019s MDE to be moderate. \nNotably, Dr Tan agreed with Dr Cheok\u2019s assessment that the appellant\u2019s \nMDE was not so severe;\n(b) Nature of the offender (eg, his past behaviour and conduct): The \nappellant has a long history of past offending. However, both Dr Tan \nand Dr Cheok noted that he had no past psychiatric history. It thus \nappears that the appellant\u2019s MDE did not have any contributory link to \nthe present instances of offending; and\n(c) Manner and circumstances of the offending and the nature of the \noffence: In this regard, Dr Cheok\u2019s observations of the appellant\u2019s \noffending are apposite. I can do no better than to cite the DJ\u2019s analysis:5 \n\u201c[Dr Cheok] explained that the two offences were \u2018very goal directed\u2019 \nand comprised \u2018very complex actions\u2019 including choosing potential \n5 GD at [21].\nVersion No 2: 31 May 2022 (15:56 hrs)\nKuah Teck Hin v PP[2022] SGHC 119\n5targets that gave him the highest probability of success.

Yew Hong filed two affidavits, one as an \nadministratrix of the Estate, ie, in her capacity as the second defendant and the \nother as a beneficiary of the Estate, as the seventh defendant. Where reference \nis made to Yew Hong\u2019s AEIC and unless otherwise stated, it refers only to her \nAEIC that was filed in her capacity as a beneficiary of the Estate. The reasons \nVersion No 1: 24 May 2022 (14:38 hrs)\nOng Chin Woon v Ong Bee Hah[2022] SGHC 125 \n3for this will be apparent when the court refers to the joint defence filed by the \nadministratrices1.  \n5 The text of the Plaintiff\u2019s AEIC totalled less than 28 pages but his \nexhibits were compiled into three thick bundles of documents and consisted of \nmore than 1,000 pages, while similar documents formed the bulk of the 11 \nvolumes of the agreed bundles of documents. \n6 In his AEIC, the Plaintiff deposed that while the latter was alive, the \nFather conducted a business called Southern Tyre Co (\u201cSouthern Tyre\u201d) which \nsole-proprietorship was registered in the name of the Deceased (on 1 October \n19602) because the Father had a gambling habit. Southern Tyre was in the \nbusiness of supplying tyres to lorries and trucks that used to transport logs from \nPeninsular Malaya to sawmills in Singapore. On 1 January 1975, Southern Tyre \nwas converted into a partnership with Chin Ee and the Plaintiff as the partners \nof the Deceased. \n7 In or about 1972, the Father ventured into the logging business in \nMalaysia. He became a shareholder in a company called Lian Pong Timber \nIndustries Sdn Bhd on or about 26 November 1973.  \n8 The Plaintiff went to Peninsular Malaya to help in the Father\u2019s timber \nbusiness and was stationed in Negeri Sembilan and Pahang. Chin Ee was left to \nmanage Southern Tyre in Singapore. Chin Ee managed Southern Tyre until he \nemigrated to Canada on or about 12 December 1988 when the business was \ntaken over by Chin Ee\u2019s brother-in-law Seah Tua Chew (\u201cSeah\u201d). On 27 June \n1 See [ 56] infra\n2 See ACRA search at AB5748 \nVersion No 1: 24 May 2022 (14:38 hrs)\nOng Chin Woon v Ong Bee Hah[2022] SGHC 125 \n41991, both the Plaintiff and the Deceased formally withdrew from the \npartnership and Seah officially took over the business of Southern Tyre. \n9 After Malaysia banned the export of raw timber to Singapore in or about \n1977, the Plaintiff deposed that he incorporated Success Lumber International \nPte Ltd (\u201cSuccess Lumber\u201d) to sell timber logs in Singapore after the timber \nwas first sawn and turned into logs in Malaysia. The Deceased and Chin Ee \nwere shareholders of Success Timber but were not involved in running its \noperations. The Plaintiff was not a shareholder even though Success Lumber \nwas his company as he did not want his partners in his Malaysian timber \nbusiness to know he owned a competing business.  \n10 The Plaintiff deposed that he would help out in the business of Southern \nTyre whenever he returned to Singapore from Malaysia on weekends. The \nPlaintiff took all the credit for the family\u2019s prosperity3 and claimed that it was \nthe success of his timber business that enabled the family to attain a middle to \nupper middle-class lifestyle which included owning Mercedes Benz vehicles.\n11 Besides Southern Tyre and Success Lumber, the family ventured into \nother businesses and companies in Malaysia. These were (i) Syarikat Jayawaras \nSdn Bhd (\u201cJayawaras\u201d); (ii) Crescent Realty Sdn Bhd (\u201cCrescent\u201d) and (iii) \nForas Realty Development Sdn Bhd (\u201cForas\u201d). There was also a Singapore \ncompany called Goldrich (S) Pte Ltd (\u201cGoldrich\u201d) that was incorporated in \n1977. The Deceased was a shareholder of all these companies and received \n3 See transcripts on 25 August 2021 at p 222 \nVersion No 1: 24 May 2022 (14:38 hrs)\nOng Chin Woon v Ong Bee Hah[2022] SGHC 125 \n5regular dividends from them. More will be said about some of these companies \nlater4.  \n12 In the early days of Southern Tyre, the Deceased and her children \nresided at the second floor or attic of a shophouse that she owned at No 895, \nUpper Bukit Timah Road (\u201cthe Shophouse\u201d) which ground floor was where the \nbusiness of Southern Tyre was conducted. The Shophouse was acquired by the \ngovernment sometime in the 1990s and the Deceased received by way of \ncompensation around $100,000.\n13 In 1975, the family moved into a property located at No 1 Phoenix \nGarden (\u201cthe PG Property\u201d) which was purchased in the name of the Deceased \nalthough it was funded by monies from Southern Tyre and a bank overdraft \nfacility of Southern Tyre. On 14 June 1977, the Plaintiff and Chin Ee were added \nas joint owners to the PG Property without any payment on their part. \n14 On 27 May 1985, the Plaintiff married Geok Leng but he continued to \nlive at the PG Property after his marriage. On 18 August 1988, three months \nbefore the completion of the purchase of the Property, the Plaintiff and Geok \nLeng purchased a condominium unit at No 5 Newton Road #04-13 Elmira \nHeights (\u201cElmira Heights\u201d or \u201cthe Flat\u201d). He deposed in his AEIC that he looked \nforward to moving into the Flat with his family but he gave up the idea because \nthe Deceased was not keen to live there as it was less convenient for her friends \nto visit her.  \n4 See [19\u201320] and [74\u201375] infra\nVersion No 1: 24 May 2022 (14:38 hrs)\nOng Chin Woon v Ong Bee Hah[2022] SGHC 125 \n615 In 1988, the PG Property was sold. The Deceased had initially wanted \nto renovate the PG Property but changed her mind. Instead, she decided to and \ndid sell the PG Property for $540,000 and replaced it with the Property5 as the \nfamily home, at a purchase price of $620,000. The Deceased, Yew Hong (who \nwas then unmarried), the Plaintiff and Geok Leng moved into the Property in \n1989 after the PG Property was sold. \n16 Although the Flat was ready for occupancy by the second half of 1990, \nBee Hah deposed in her AEIC6 that the Plaintiff (with Geok Leng and later their \nchildren) continued to reside at the Property. Therefore, because of his and his \nfamily\u2019s continued occupation of the Property until the time it was sold, it was \nthe Plaintiff\u2019s case in this Suit that the Property was his matrimonial property \n(which the defendants disputed).  \n17 In late 1988, Chin Ee emigrated to Canada with his wife and first child. \nOn 21 May 1988, the Deceased (then about 60 years of age) called for a family \nmeeting (\u201cthe May 1988 meeting\u201d) to discuss financial matters with her children \nbefore Chin Ee left for Canada. For the May 1988 meeting, the Deceased \nrequested Yew Hong to take notes \u2013 which handwritten notes Yew Hong \nproduced at the trial7 and were also exhibited in her AEIC8. In the handwritten \nnotes, the Plaintiff was referred to as \u201cW\u201d while Chin Ee was referred to as \u201cD\u201d \n(which stands for David). What transpired at the May 1988 meeting has a \nmaterial bearing on this Suit and requires elaboration.\n5 See [1] infra\n6 At para 38\n7 See 2AB30\u201335\n8 As exhibit OYH-6\nVersion No 1: 24 May 2022 (14:38 hrs)\nOng Chin Woon v Ong Bee Hah[2022] SGHC 125 \n718 At the May 1988 meeting, following upon discussions amongst the \nfamily members, the following were some of the significant matters discussed \nand agreed upon:\n(a) the Plaintiff and Chin Ee would set up a joint UOB account (\u201cthe \nBrothers\u2019 Account\u201d) to which they would contribute $100,000 each. \nTheir contributions were to defray the daily, travelling and other \nexpenses of the Deceased as well as to take care of the university fees \nand wedding expenses of Yew Hong in the future. If the balance in the \nBrothers\u2019 Account was depleted below $10,000, the two brothers \nwould have to top up the shortfall equally to bring the balance back to \n$200,000; \n(b) Siew Eng, Ee Peng and Bee Hah would separately set up a bank \naccount with OCBC (\u201cthe Sisters\u2019 Account\u2019) into which they would \ntransfer monies from the Brothers\u2019 Account to fund the Deceased\u2019s \npersonal but not the household expenses. (The Sisters\u2019 Account with \nOCBC that was set up in or about September 1988 was closed after \nSiew Eng\u2019s demise in 1997. Thereafter, Bee Hah, Yew Hong and Ee \nPeng opened a new joint account with Industrial and Commercial Bank \nwhich then became the Sisters\u2019 Account);\n(c) the Plaintiff and Chin Ee would transfer back to the Deceased \ntheir interest in the PG Property;\n(d) $20,000 would be returned to the Deceased from Selegie;\n(e) the cost of renovation and car to be shared 50:50 by the Plaintiff \nand Chin Ee. Each to give $50,000;\nVersion No 1: 24 May 2022 (14:38 hrs)\nOng Chin Woon v Ong Bee Hah[2022] SGHC 125 \n8(f) based on a list that the Plaintiff produced, Siew Eng set out the \nDeceased\u2019s shares in various companies and arrived at a value of \n$164,000. \n19 The Deceased wanted her children to bear witness to the agreement of \nthe Plaintiff and Chin Ee in [ 18(c)] to transfer back to her their interest in the \nPG Property. Hence, Siew Eng wrote out a short note in Chinese to which the \nchildren appended their signatures. The English translation of the document \nreads:\nNumber 1 Phoenix Garden belongs to Tan Ah Moi (Chen \nZhenmei)\nOng Chin Woon, Ong Chin Ee are willing to withdraw their \nnames. Chen Zhenmei (Tan Ah Moi) [to] handle [it] at her \ndiscretion.    \nTwenty years later at a family meeting held on 10 March 2009 (\u201cthe March 2009 \nmeeting\u201d)9, it was confirmed that when the PG Property was sold, the Deceased \ntook all the sale proceeds. \n20 The reference to \u201cSelegie\u201d and $20,000 in [ 18(d)] requires an \nexplanation. According to Chin Ee10, \u201cSelegie\u201d was a reference to a five-storey \napartment building (\u201cthe Selegie Building\u201d) situated along Selegie Road which \nGoldrich owned. The entire Ong family were Goldrich\u2019s shareholders before \nChin Ee moved to Canada with the Deceased being the major shareholder. \nGoldrich had purchased for $140,000 the plot of land upon which the Selegie \nBuilding was constructed; the Plaintiff and Chin Ee paid $120,000 while the \nDeceased lent the balance of $20,000. \n9 See [75]\u2013[76] infra\n10 See para 58 of his AEIC\nVersion No 1: 24 May 2022 (14:38 hrs)\nOng Chin Woon v Ong Bee Hah[2022] SGHC 125 \n921 Whilst the Selegie Building was still under construction in 1988, the \nPlaintiff was embroiled in disputes with the contractor over delays in \nconstruction works. This resulted in the Plaintiff\u2019s car being vandalised. The \nDeceased was afraid that matters would get out of hand and wanted the Selegie \nBuilding disposed of with the return of her loan of $20,000. The Selegie \nBuilding was sold in 1989 for at least $1m. Less the bank loan used for \nconstruction and the Deceased\u2019s loan, Chin Ee11 estimated that he and the \nPlaintiff would have received $240,000 each from the sale proceeds. Chin Ee \nrequested the Plaintiff to use $100,000 therefrom for the Deceased\u2019s care which \nChin Ee assumed was done but, he never received the difference of $140,000. \n22 The reference to 50:50 in [ 18(e)] was to the Deceased\u2019s then intention \nto renovate the PG Property to which the Plaintiff and Chin Ee had agreed to \nmake an equal contribution of $50,000 each.  \n23 The Plaintiff deposed that while he resided at the Property, he paid for \nall the household expenses using monies withdrawn from the Brothers\u2019 \nAccount. Bee Hah (and the other daughters) opined that this in effect meant that \nChin Ee was paying for half of the Plaintiff\u2019s expenses which they felt was \nunfair. Hence, from about 1991 onwards, the Plaintiff took over the payment of \nthe regular household expenses at the Property as by then, he had two children. \nFurthermore, the Deceased had since October 1990, started making annual trips \nof about six months\u2019 duration each to Canada to visit Chin Ee and his family. \nShe would leave for Vancouver in spring (March or April) and return to \nSingapore in autumn (September or October) when the Canadian weather \nstarted to turn cold. Her last trip to Canada was in late 2014. According to Yew \n11 At para 61 of his AEIC\nVersion No 1: 24 May 2022 (14:38 hrs)\nOng Chin Woon v Ong Bee Hah[2022] SGHC 125 \n10Hong, due to the Deceased\u2019s long absences from Singapore between 1990 and \n2014, the bulk of the expenses incurred at the Property was, in any case, those \nof the Plaintiff and his family.  \n24 Between 1997 and 2005, the Deceased\u2019s daughters took her to see \nlawyers with a view to making a will, as the Deceased did not speak English. \nHowever, despite visiting three law firms between 19 March 1997 and \n14 September 2005, the Deceased did not execute a will. \n25 Yew Hong deposed in her AEIC12 (and so too did Bee Hah13) that in \nevery consultation she had with various lawyers\/law firms, the Deceased \nexpressed her wish that the Property was to be sold after her death and the sale \nproceeds distributed. Sometimes she would give details of the percentages or \namounts she intended to give to various individuals or charities, but she \nremained undecided and no will was executed as a result.\n26 On one occasion, on 11 February 2012, the Deceased accompanied by \nYew Hong visited Bee Hah at her home. There, the Deceased raised the subject \nof the Property which she estimated was worth $2.5m. She instructed Bee Hah \nto write down her instructions on how much to give to who, based on the figure \nof $2.5m. Whenever Bee Hah went to the kitchen, Yew Hong would take over \nrecording the Deceased\u2019s instructions. The notes were exhibited in Yew Hong\u2019s \nAEIC14 and the originals were also produced in court15. Counsel for the \ndefendants, Ms Hing, described the notes as the Deceased\u2019s informal will as it \n12 At para 60\n13 At para 50 of her AEIC  \n14 At exhibit OYH-16\n15 See exhibit D4 and 2AB125\u2013127\nVersion No 1: 24 May 2022 (14:38 hrs)\nOng Chin Woon v Ong Bee Hah[2022] SGHC 125 \n11set out the Deceased\u2019s wishes on how her assets should be dealt with after her \ndemise. \n27 Towards the end of 2014 after her return from Canada, the Deceased\u2019s \nhealth deteriorated. She spent considerable amounts of time in hospitals until \nher demise on 5 February 2015 at 87 years of age. \n28 After the Deceased\u2019s funeral, her children and grandchildren gathered at \nthe Property on 15 February 2015, at the Plaintiff\u2019s request. At that gathering, \nsome of the Deceased\u2019s belongings such as her watch and jewellery were \ndistributed together with the cash donations from people who had attended her \nwake.\n29 Another meeting of the siblings followed on 25 March 2015 (\u201cthe March \n2015 meeting\u201d). Yew Hong made notes of the discussions16 which primarily \nturned on the sale of the Property, the distribution of the sale proceeds and the \nappointment of administrators for the Estate. The Plaintiff made it clear that he \ndid not want to be an administrator. The Plaintiff also said the Deceased had \nbeen prepared to sell the Property to him for $800,000 some 20 years back, but \nhe would not press the issue as it would cause friction in the family.  \n30 On 20 May 2015, the Plaintiff, Yew Hong, Ee Peng and Bee Hah met \nthe Estate\u2019s solicitors for the first time (\u201cthe May 2015 meeting\u201d) to discuss the \nrole of administrators \u2013 this included arranging for the Property to be sold and \ndistributing the sale proceeds to the Estate\u2019s beneficiaries. The Plaintiff \nindicated that he was prepared to move out of the Property. Although she was \n16 See exhibit OYH-17 in her AEIC and 2AB143\u2013144.\nVersion No 1: 24 May 2022 (14:38 hrs)\nOng Chin Woon v Ong Bee Hah[2022] SGHC 125 \n12initially reluctant to take on the role, Bee Hah eventually agreed to be appointed \nan administratrix of the Estate along with Yew Hong and Ee Peng. The grant of \nletters of administration was extracted on 3 November 2015. With the death of \nEe Peng on 7 May 2017, Yew Hong and Bee Hah are the remaining \nadministratrices of the estate.\n31 Yew Hong deposed17 that out of the blue, in the interval between \nFebruary and May 2015, the Plaintiff told her that a loan of $500,000 had been \ntaken out for the Deceased\u2019s purchase of the Property and that the Deceased\u2019s \nmonies were used to repay the loans. \n32 On 4 August 2016, a family meeting was held at the Property. At this \nmeeting, the Plaintiff said he and Chin Ee wanted to purchase the Property by \npaying $200,000 to each of the other beneficiaries. However, nothing came out \nof this proposal as the administratrices did not obtain the consent of the other \nbeneficiaries. The discussions were recorded in a WhatsApp message to the \nsiblings from Yew Hong on the following day18.  \n33 Five months later on 18 January 2017, the Plaintiff, Chin Ee, Ee Peng, \nYew Hong and Bee Hah met at Ee Peng\u2019s house. By then, Ee Peng was in poor \nhealth. All the beneficiaries present agreed to sell the Property on the open \nmarket. The delay in selling since the letters of administration were extracted \n(on 3 November 2015) according to Chin Ee19 was due to the demise of Siew \nEng\u2019s husband (the third defendant\u2019s father) and the passing of Yew Hong\u2019s \nfather-in-law.   \n17 At para 102 of her AEIC as a beneficiary  \n18 At 1AB4186\u20134188\n19 See his AEIC at para 128\nVersion No 1: 24 May 2022 (14:38 hrs)\nOng Chin Woon v Ong Bee Hah[2022] SGHC 125 \n1334 As he was still residing at the Property, the Plaintiff requested that any \nsale must be subject to a three-years leaseback arrangement (\u201cthe leaseback \ncondition\u201d). Although she did not voice her objections, Yew Hong deposed in \nher AEIC20 that she was not supportive of the leaseback condition, as almost \ntwo years had passed since the Deceased\u2019s demise and she was mindful that the \nDeceased wanted the Property to be sold as soon as possible after her passing. \nHowever, as the Plaintiff was then the eldest while she was the youngest child \nin the family, she felt it was not her place to object and she did not. It should be \nnoted that during cross-examination of the Plaintiff21, he denied that the \nleaseback condition only benefited him\/his family as he was the only one \nstaying at the Property. In answer to the court\u2019s question, the Plaintiff gave the \nabsurd explanation that he believed the Deceased\u2019s spirit would return within \nfive years and she needed a roof over her head. \n35 Between February and April 2017, the Plaintiff allowed the appointed \nreal estate agent, Jeannie Lim (\u201cJeannie\u201d), to conduct viewings of the Property \nwhich was marketed initially at $3.5m and subsequently at $3.25m. After \nconsiderable difficulty, Jeannie found a buyer who was willing to pay $2.95m \nfor the Property (\u201cthe $2.95m offer\u201d) and to accept the leaseback condition.  \n36 However, in May 2017, before the administratrices could act on the \n$2.95m offer, Bee Hah and Yew Hong at a lunch with the Plaintiff and Chin Ee \nwere asked by the Plaintiff to sell the Property to his daughter Wen Jin at $2.7m \ninstead. The Plaintiff also asked that the estate pay him a commission of $60,000 \nand pay Wen Jin monthly rent of $4,000 under the leaseback condition. Not \n20 At para 100\n21 See transcripts on 27 August 2021 at p 349 line 21 \nVersion No 1: 24 May 2022 (14:38 hrs)\nOng Chin Woon v Ong Bee Hah[2022] SGHC 125 \n14surprisingly, the Plaintiff\u2019s unreasonable demands22 caused heated arguments \nand led to Yew Hong and then Bee Hah walking off.

It stated:\nAs I had infm CE the same early days.\nWen Jin n her boyfriend had confirmed to buy [Jalan Jermin] \nat $2.76M\nPls infm then to whom they will pay 1% option money asap \n38 Subsequently, Chin Ee informed Yew Hong23 that the offer price had \nbeen increased by $60,000 from $2.7m to $2.76m and that the purchasers would \nbe the Plaintiff and Wen Jin. Yew Hong was also told that the extra $60,000 \nwas meant24 to be given back to the Plaintiff by the Estate as his commission.  \nIn her AEIC25, Yew Hong said:\nIn other words, [the Plaintiff] wanted to extract the commission \nhe had requested from his own daughter and future son-in-law.  \n39 On 10 June 2017, all the beneficiaries consented to the sale to the \nPlaintiff and Wen Jin.

To show it was an \u201carm\u2019s length\u201d transaction, Wen Jin and\/or the \nPlaintiff decided that Wen Jin\u2019s future husband would be the sole purchaser. \n40 For reasons that will become apparent in the court\u2019s subsequent findings, \nYew Hong made copious references in her AEIC to the WhatsApp exchanges \nthat showed that the Plaintiff actively encouraged Wen Jin (and Wen Jin\u2019s future \nhusband) to purchase the Property at a discount to the market value. In her \ncommunication with the administratrices in particular with Yew Hong, Wen Jin \nalso made no secret of the fact she could only afford to buy the property with \nthe (financial) support of her father as her budget was only $2.7m and the \nPlaintiff would pay the difference of $60,000. \n41 The administratrices issued the option to purchase for the Property in \nJuly 2017 and the sale was completed in October 2017.

The applicant, COD, is a company incorporated in Singapore. It is a shipbuilder. The respondent, COE, is also a company incorporated in Singapore. It makes marine and offshore equipment. 1', '3\\u2003COE contracted to make and deliver to COD two identical fibre rope cranes (the \u201cCranes\u201d). 2', 'There was one contract for each crane on the same terms (\u201cthe contracts\u201d).

COE sought specific performance and payment of the balance contract price of the Cranes, with damages in the alternative. Pending the outcome of the proceedings, COE retained the Cranes, putting them into storage. 8', '6\\u2003A single arbitrator was appointed for both arbitrations. As the facts and legal issues overlapped, the arbitrations were consolidated. 9', '7\\u2003COE\u2019s primary claim for specific performance rested on the point that the Cranes were of a unique nature, given the novelty of using fibre rope instead of steel wire, and that it would be difficult to find an alternative buyer. Consequently, COE contended that damages would not be an adequate remedy. 10', 'Nonetheless, COE also claimed damages in the alternative to specific performance.', '8\\u2003The relevant parts of the relief claimed in the notice of arbitration for the first crane dated 6 November 2015 were as follows: 11', 'This language was carried through into the statement of claim for the first crane, which stated: 12', 'The relevant parts of the notice of arbitration and statement of claim for the second crane were substantially the same.', '9\\u2003Thus, damages were pleaded generally, with no measure of damages identified, but with specific items of expenditure primarily related to storage stated to be included.', '10\\u2003In the witness statement of COE\u2019s consultant filed in the arbitration on 6 October 2017 (the \u201cCOE witness statement\u201d), it was briefly explained that if specific performance was not granted, the quantum of damages claimed would still match the full price of the Cranes in addition to the other claimed costs such as storage costs. The reason given was that there was no second-hand market for the Cranes and therefore the purchase price would be a fair and reasonable reflection of COE\u2019s loss and damage suffered as a result of COD\u2019s breach. At best, the Cranes had a certain scrap value (which was insignificant compared to the purchase price), said to be supported by some quotations for scrap steel that COE had obtained in respect of equipment other than the Cranes. These quotations had previously been disclosed and were exhibited to the COE witness statement. 13', 'I will refer to this paragraph as COE\u2019s witness statement quantification.', '11\\u2003COE\u2019s consultant was cross-examined about ten days later, on 17 October 2017.

Nonetheless, the arbitrator on 28 April 2020 issued an interim award. 18', '15\\u2003The arbitrator decided that while the Cranes did not comply with contractual specifications for weight, this non-compliance was not sufficiently material to justify COD\u2019s termination of the contracts. COD\u2019s termination was thus wrongful and in breach of the contracts. However, he did not consider specific performance as the appropriate remedy because in his view this would absolve COE from liability to pay damages flowing from the excess weight. He then decided that damages were the just and appropriate remedy, and invited further submissions on the quantum of damages. It is worth setting out this part of his award in full (but omitting his footnotes): 19', '16\\u2003Following the interim award, there were requests for corrections and the Memorandum of Corrections was issued on 10 June 2020. 20', '17\\u2003Initially, COD\u2019s counsel had requested in an email dated 27 May 2020 that the filing of submissions on damages be deferred, 21', 'but when the arbitrator wrote to ask for the deferred date, COD\u2019s counsel wrote on 20 July 2020 to state that COD\u2019s position was that the arbitrator had no right or power to direct an assessment as there had been no agreement between the parties to bifurcation of the matter and both liability and damages should have been dealt with together. 22', 'COD expressed its disagreement to any further submissions on damages (and costs). In addition, COD\u2019s counsel informed that COD would shortly be filing an application to set aside the interim award.

He dealt with COD\u2019s objection in detail. 27', 'He considered that COE\u2019s plea of damages was not limited to the specific items identified, and a claim for the price of the Cranes was not excluded from it. He also referred to and relied on the Court of Appeal decision in Lee Chee Wei v Tan Hor Peow Victor and others and another appeal [2007] 3 SLR(R) 537 which was cited to him by COE. In that case, the plaintiff unsuccessfully sought specific performance, but had asked in submissions that if specific performance were not granted damages should be assessed. However, his plea omitted the words \u201cto be assessed\u201d and he had not put in evidence of damages during trial. The trial judge awarded only nominal damages. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and ordered an assessment of damages in lieu of specific performance.', '24\\u2003In response to COD\u2019s objection that the arbitration had proceeded on the basis of one evidential hearing, the arbitrator noted that evidence of the damages sought had been adduced during that evidential hearing, and referred to COE\u2019s witness statement quantification and the documents exhibited in support. The arbitrator concluded: 28', '25\\u2003The arbitrator ultimately awarded damages to COD based on the purchase price of the Cranes together with variation orders that increased the price, less the scrap value as set out in COE\u2019s witness statement quantification. 29', 'The arbitrator rejected COE\u2019s attempt to reduce the scrap value, disallowing any further evidence on this point. 30', 'The arbitrator also ultimately rejected any deduction for loss in cargo carrying capacity and increase in fuel consumption due to excess weight, 31', 'which had been the issue on which he had indicated he wanted further submissions in [130] of his interim award reproduced at [15] above.', '26\\u2003On 10 September 2021, COD filed its application to set aside the whole of the final award.

On 12 March 2022, COD applied by SUM 991 of 2022 for leave to file that third affidavit, and this application was heard at the start of the hearing of the setting aside application.

The first defendant signed a contract of employment with Singpet dated 7 August 2012 (the \u201cSingpet Contract\u201d). 7', 'On 3 April 2014, the plaintiff was incorporated, and the first defendant began working for the plaintiff some time thereafter. However, the first defendant did not sign a new written contract of employment with the plaintiff. There is therefore some disagreement concerning the precise start date and terms of his employment with the plaintiff. However, it is agreed that the plaintiff started paying the first defendant\u2019s salary and making payments to the first defendant\u2019s CPF account in January 2015. It is also agreed that from that point onwards, the first defendant was an employee of the plaintiff. 8', '7\\u2003It is worth setting out the plaintiff\u2019s business model in detail. The manufacturers of the pet products which the plaintiff deals with will only sell them to authorised dealers. Thus, the plaintiff acquires pet products from these authorised dealers. There are different authorised dealers in different countries, and the different authorised dealers sell the pet products at different prices. Online retailers prefer to acquire pet products from authorised dealers with lower prices but are not always able to do so. This allows the plaintiff to interpose itself between authorised dealer and online retailer. 9', '8\\u2003As an illustration, let us assume that the authorised dealer in Country A sells pet products at a lower price than the authorised dealer in Country B. An online retailer in Country B would therefore prefer to acquire its products from the authorised dealer in Country A. However, due to the regulations in Country B, it is not able to import a large quantity of products from Country A. The online retailer wants to purchase a large quantity, because the price of the products decreases as the quantity increases. In order to do so, the online retailer from Country B approaches the plaintiff, who, being in Singapore, is able to receive the products wholesale from Country A. The plaintiff receives the products wholesale from the authorised dealer in Country A, packs them into smaller individual packages, and sends them directly to the retail customers who have placed orders with the online retailer in Country B.', '9\\u2003In this business model, the retail customer benefits because they are able to acquire products at lower prices. The online retailer benefits because they are able to sell the products at lower prices than their competition, who purchase their products from authorised dealers in their own country. The plaintiff benefits because they charge the online retailer a fulfilment fee on each order.', '10\\u2003The plaintiff refers to the cost at which it acquires products from authorised dealers as the \u201ctrue cost\u201d. In order to account for various factors such as cost of freight and exchange rate fluctuations, the plaintiff applies a multiplier to true cost to obtain a figure which it calls \u201clanded cost\u201d. Finally, the fee that is charged to the online retailer is the landed cost plus a further \u201cfulfilment fee\u201d. The fulfilment fee varies based on the volume of orders that the online retailer places with the plaintiff. The larger the volume, the lower the unit fulfilment fee.', '11\\u2003The suppliers of the plaintiff are the authorised dealers. The customers of the plaintiff are the online retailers, who use the plaintiff\u2019s services to send the pet products directly from the plaintiff to the individuals who ultimately receive the pet products. SNPC was one of the online retailers in Australia that made use of the plaintiff\u2019s services. Another online retailer that was responsible for a significant part of the plaintiff\u2019s business was PetBucket.', '12\\u2003The first defendant was the warehouse manager for the plaintiff.

If the investment resulted in losses for the plaintiff, the defendant would not be remunerated. 10', '9\\u2003Having entered into the Investment Agreement, the plaintiff now had to transfer the principal sum to the defendant. However, it faced an obstacle in the form of capital control regulations in the PRC. 11', 'The plaintiff therefore borrowed moneys from various intermediaries with bank accounts outside the PRC, and had them transfer the respective sums borrowed directly to the defendant: 12', 'While these sums were transferred to a UOB Bank account held by the defendant (the \u201cUOB Account\u201d), the plaintiff alleges that the defendant made use of two other accounts in managing the investment, one with China Construction Bank (Asia) Hong Kong (the \u201cCCB Account\u201d) and another with KGI Securities (Singapore) Pte Ltd (the \u201cKGI Account\u201d). 13', 'I shall refer to all three accounts collectively as the \u201cAccounts\u201d.', '10\\u2003The plaintiff did not keep a close eye on this investment. 14', 'Li explained that this was due, among other things, to the small scale of the investment relative to the plaintiff\u2019s usual business within the PRC, and to the fact that the defendant would occasionally update Li, who would pass the information on to the plaintiff\u2019s management. 15', '11\\u2003Things changed in 2018. In January and March that year, Li received troubling news that the defendant was being investigated by Weiye for misappropriation of funds. 16', 'After discussing this with the plaintiff\u2019s president and legal representative, Wang Xianzhou (\u201cWang\u201d), the plaintiff decided to terminate the Investment Agreement and retrieve the principal sum and the investment returns from the defendant. 17', 'However, the defendant demurred, citing certain difficulties in the stock market. 18', 'Li was therefore tasked to obtain a written document from the defendant to attest to the existence of the Investment Agreement and to the defendant\u2019s obligation to return the moneys. 19', 'This was done on 15 March 2018, with the defendant drafting and executing the following declaration (the \u201cDeclaration\u201d) himself: 20', '12\\u2003Thereafter, for a time, the defendant appeared to be acquiescing to the plaintiff\u2019s desire to terminate the Investment Agreement. In June and July 2018, the defendant indicated to Li that he would be liquidating the shares and securities held in the Accounts. 21', 'However, in August 2018, prior to undertaking certain procedures he claimed were necessary to transfer the principal sum and the investment returns to the plaintiff, the defendant asked the plaintiff to reimburse him for personal income tax to be incurred in respect of the principal sum and investment returns residing in the Accounts. 22', 'The plaintiff agreed to this. 23', 'The defendant thus commissioned the preparation of a tax report, which indicated that he was liable to pay personal income tax of RMB1,189,071.74. 24', 'The parties then agreed that the defendant would be reimbursed for RMB680,000 first and then the remainder upon the return of the principal sum and the investment returns, for a total of RMB1.18 million of income tax. 25', 'Accordingly, the first tranche of RMB680,000 was transferred to the defendant\u2019s designated recipient company, Hainan Jiaopu Information Technology Co Ltd on 13 September 2018 through Li and a third party. 26', '13\\u2003The plaintiff therefore arranged for the defendant to fly to Singapore on 21 September 2018 to complete the necessary transfer procedures. 27', 'However, although the defendant informed Li at 2pm that day that he had arrived in Singapore, he became uncontactable thereafter. 28', '14\\u2003The defendant resurfaced only on 29 September 2018, asking Li to meet him on 3 October 2018 in the PRC. 29', 'It is Li\u2019s evidence that at the meeting, the defendant admitted that he had not entered Singapore on 21 September 2018, and that he was under investigation by the Singapore authorities and would only enter Singapore to complete the necessary transfer procedures after the investigation concluded. 30', '15\\u2003In view of the defendant\u2019s behaviour, a meeting was arranged between the defendant, Li and Wang in October 2018. 31', 'Li says that the defendant stormed out of the meeting, and later informed him that he would not return the principal sum and the investment returns to the plaintiff. 32', '16\\u2003After taking time to obtain legal advice, Li (on behalf of the plaintiff) sent the defendant a WeChat message demanding immediate payment of the principal sum and the investment returns, failing which HHBC would commence legal proceedings against the defendant to recover the same. 33', 'The defendant did not respond. 34', 'Accordingly, the plaintiff began the present action.', '17\\u2003The defendant, meanwhile, has painted a starkly different picture, one that centres on alleged interactions with Zhang, who was then the chairman of Weiye\u2019s board of directors and the Supervisor of the plaintiff. According to the defendant, the true arrangement that led to the deposit of a total of S$1,784,350 in his UOB Account was not the Investment Agreement for him to undertake investments on the plaintiff\u2019s behalf, but rather an arrangement between him and Zhang (\u201cZhang Wei\u2019s Arrangement\u201d).', '18\\u2003In December 2014, the defendant was contemplating leaving Weiye to pursue his own ambitions in respect of investing. 35', 'The defendant informed Zhang of this, and suggested that since he wished to set up his own investment firm to manage investments of about RMB100 million, continuing at Weiye would be akin to giving up commission and returns which he could earn on those sums. 36', 'Upon hearing this, Zhang made the defendant an offer: if the defendant were to stay on at Weiye, while providing Zhang with investment consultancy and management services, Zhang would pay him a single lump sum of RMB9 million (ie a 3% rate of return per annum on RMB100 million, calculated over three years). 37', 'The defendant accepted this offer. 38', 'Accordingly, Zhang \u2013 and not the plaintiff \u2013 caused the sum of S$1,764,350 (being supposedly the Singapore dollars equivalent of RMB9 million) to be transferred into the defendant\u2019s UOB Account, through Li, Liu Hongen, Max Fill and Well Fai. 39', '19\\u2003Thereafter, from around May 2015 to January 2018, the defendant advised Zhang on various investments and executed those investments on his behalf. Over time, these investments mainly consisted of trading in Weiye shares in the stock market and monitoring such trades. 40', 'In January 2018, Zhang Wei\u2019s Arrangement came to a close, 41', 'and the defendant left Weiye to set up his own investment firm in March 2018. 42', 'The defendant strenuously denies that his departure was prompted by any sort of investigation at Weiye for misappropriation of funds, as alleged by the plaintiff. 43', '20\\u2003This account by the defendant provides an alternative explanation for the entirety of the events set out by the plaintiff, save one: the Declaration executed on 15 March 2018 by the defendant himself. That, the defendant says, was executed in connection with a separate agreement, which he terms the \u201cAsset Exchange Agreement\u201d. The Asset Exchange Agreement came about from a conversation between the defendant and Li on 12 March 2018, wherein Li conveyed a request from Zhang for the defendant to provide funds from the Accounts (which were outside the PRC) to Weiye for its use outside the PRC. In exchange, an equivalent sum in RMB would be transferred to the defendant\u2019s personal bank account in the PRC. The defendant would also be reimbursed for the entirety of the personal income tax he would incur in the PRC as a result of the assets exchanged (which in essence leads to a remittance of the defendant\u2019s monies in Singapore currency in Singapore back to China in RMB in exchange for a remittance of the plaintiff\u2019s monies in RMB out of China to Singapore in Singapore currency). 44', 'The defendant was happy to oblige, as it would have been cumbersome for him to move his funds in Singapore back into the PRC himself. 45', 'Thus, Li \u2013 on behalf of the plaintiff \u2013 entered into an agreement on these terms with the defendant. 46', 'Li further requested that the defendant sign a document which stated that any and all assets held in the Accounts were owned by the plaintiff. In order to show his commitment to the Asset Exchange Agreement, the defendant signed the Declaration. 47', 'He denies that he drafted the Declaration, and says that it was instead Li who presented him with an unsigned copy to execute. 48', '21\\u2003It is out of the Asset Exchange Agreement that the defendant\u2019s counterclaim arises. He alleges that pursuant to that agreement, Xu Jingbo (\u201cXu\u201d), Zhang\u2019s secretary at the time, transferred a total of HK$2,785,000 from the CCB Account to Li in August 2018. 49', 'However, no equivalent sum was transferred to the defendant\u2019s bank account in the PRC thereafter. 50', 'The defendant also agrees that he was transferred RMB680,000 by the plaintiff in September 2018 as reimbursement of part of his income tax, but alleges that he is owed the remaining RMB509,071.74. 51', '22\\u2003Around this time, the defendant\u2019s relationship with Zhang began to crumble. The defendant claims that he began growing doubtful of the legitimacy of Zhang\u2019s purposes underlying the Asset Exchange Agreement. 52', 'His October 2018 meeting with Li and Wang was the last straw: when the Declaration was produced and he was asked to return the moneys in the Accounts to the plaintiff, he stormed out of the meeting. 53', '23\\u2003It is the defendant\u2019s case that the plaintiff\u2019s claim has in truth been engineered by Zhang. 54', 'He alleges that the plaintiff was and is ultimately controlled by Zhang, 55', 'and that this present suit is Zhang\u2019s attempt to claw back the remuneration paid to the defendant and a means of retaliation against him. 56'"}

{"casename":"2022_SGHC_131","fact":"'4\\u2003Jonathan and Wayne were introduced to CIC in early September 2018 by a mutual business acquaintance from a company called China Petroleum and Gas (S) Pte Ltd (\u201cCPAG\u201d). At this time, Mako had either been incorporated or was in the midst of being incorporated. 3', 'Thereafter, between September and October 2018, Richard met with Jonathan and Wayne to discuss a potential business relationship between CIC and Mako. The parties broadly agree that the purpose of such relationship was for Mako to assist CIC in developing its business in the Indonesian market. However, on CIC\u2019s case, the defendants were the ones who pitched the idea of assisting CIC with developing its presence in the Indonesian commodities market; 4', 'on the defendants\u2019 account, it was CIC who sought assistance with the development of its business. 5', '5\\u2003Whichever the case, in the midst of these meetings, on 12 October 2018, the Platform was officially launched in Singapore. It is Peter\u2019s evidence that, though the technology for the Platform was provided by Zall, CIC did not receive other forms of operational support. 6', 'It therefore needed to find ways to promote usage of the Platform on its own. The key strategy it intended to employ to achieve this was, first, to network with players in the commodities trading industry. CIC would then to use this network to encourage usage of its Platform. To this end, CIC was keen on participating in physical, back-to-back trades between suppliers in the region, particularly in Indonesia, and end-buyers in China. It was of the view that such physical trades would increase its exposure in the commodities trading industry, and, accordingly, help it to market the Platform. 7', '6\\u2003However, CIC claims that it had no experience in the area of conducting physical trades, which is where Mako, Jonathan and Wayne were supposed to come in. On CIC\u2019s case, Jonathan and Wayne held themselves out as seasoned commodities traders with reliable contacts in Indonesia. In particular, it is Richard\u2019s evidence that Jonathan and Wayne provided two set of documents to convince CIC that they had the necessary experience. 8', 'The first was a deck of PowerPoint slides (the \u201cSlides\u201d), which set out the experience they (and thus, Mako) allegedly had in the Indonesian commodities market. The second was what CIC calls the \u201cIndicative List of Deals\u201d. On its face, this \u201cList\u201d contains the details of past commodities trade deals. On Richard\u2019s evidence, Jonathan and Wayne provided them to CIC as a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of sorts, 9', 'that is, as a list of trade deals which they claimed to have procured and carried out in the past. The purpose of the \u201cList\u201d is the subject of dispute, and bears substantially on the parties\u2019 cases. I will return to it at [60]\u2013[63] below.', '7\\u2003CIC avers that these representations and documents induced it to appoint Mako as its \u201cagent\u201d to \u201csource for business in Indonesia, market CIC to local Indonesian traders and customers, and develop CIC\u2019s presence in the Indonesian commodities trading market for bauxite, nickel ore and coal\u201d. 10', 'This appointment was effected in mid-November 2018 by way of a written agreement entered into between CIC and Mako. 11', 'This agreement was recorded in Chinese and it is titled \u201c\u670d\u52a1\u534f\u8bae\u4e66\u201d (f\u00fa w\u00f9 xi\u00e9 y\u00ec sh\u016b). The parties agree that this should be read as the \u201cService Agreement\u201d, but dispute the translation of the substantive terms which inform their rights and obligations. CIC\u2019s preferred translation of the agreement, put forward by its translator, Tan Sin Ger (\u201cMr Tan\u201d), is as follows: 12', '8\\u2003The defendants\u2019 qualified translator, Wang Rihui\u2019s (\u201cMr Wang\u201d), offered the following translation in opposition: 13', '9\\u2003The parties\u2019 dispute over the proper translation of the Service Agreement, however, is just an aspect of their more fundamental dispute over the nature of the relationship it created between CIC and Mako. On CIC\u2019s case, the agreement was entered into hurriedly, 14', 'and does not \u201cexhaustively spell out all of [Mako\u2019s] duties\u201d 15', 'which should be understood as being more fully informed by three crucial facts surrounding the formation and performance of the Service Agreement. 16', 'First, the fact that Jonathan and Wayne \u201coperated with autonomy, and were given the responsibility and discretion to source for, negotiate and procure\u201d trade deals in Indonesia. Second, the fact that CIC \u201cdid not have any employees with experience with local Indonesian traders and customers\u201d. Finally, the fact that CIC \u201crelied on and reposed trust and confidence in Jonathan and Wayne and trusted their expertise to procure and carry out Indonesian commodities deals\u201d.', '10\\u2003I should add that, beyond Mako, it is CIC\u2019s case that Jonathan and Wayne were also its agents in their personal capacities. 17', 'To this end, CIC cites the same three facts above, but in lieu of the Service Agreement \u2013 to which Jonathan and Wayne were not parties \u2013 CIC relies on the fact that in November 2018, Wayne asked for name cards to be issued to him and Jonathan. More specifically, he requested that CIC print his and Jonathan\u2019s personal email addresses on these name cards, as opposed to email addresses tied to Mako. CIC did ultimately issue such name cards, identifying Jonathan and Wayne as a \u201cDirector\u201d and \u201cDeputy Director\u201d of CIC, respectively. 18', 'CIC submits that this should be construed as an indication that Jonathan and Wayne agreed to act as its agents personally, beyond their less direct roles as directors of Mako. 19', '11\\u2003In any event, whatever the nature of the legal relationship between CIC and each of the three defendants, sometime in mid-to-late November 2018, Mako procured a back-to-back trade for CIC to participate in as a middleman pursuant to the Service Agreement (the \u201cTransaction\u201d). It bears noting that Mako did not enter into the Transaction for and on behalf of CIC. CIC admits that Mako did not have \u201cany authority to enter into or execute any agreement on [its] behalf\u201d. 20', 'Thus, although the trade was sourced by Mako, the contracts in the Transaction were signed by employees of CIC.', '12\\u2003In the first leg of the Transaction, CIC contracted to purchase, on an FOB basis, 55,000 wet metric tonnes (\u201cWMT\u201d) of nickel ore containing at least 1.65% nickel. After some back-and-forth, the supplier of the nickel ore ended up being an Indonesian company called PT Toshida Indonesia (\u201cToshida\u201d) (I will refer to the contract between them as the \u201cCIC-Toshida Contract\u201d). I pause to highlight that the parties dispute the circumstances leading up to the formation of the CIC-Toshida Contract. I will address the necessary aspects of their dispute in due course. For now, I note that prior to the formation of the CIC-Toshida Contract, the supplier that Mako recommended was one PT Integra Mining Nusantara (\u201cIntegra\u201d). A contract between CIC and Integra was executed for the supply of the nickel ore (the \u201cCIC-Integra Contract\u201d), but this was later replaced with the CIC-Toshida Contract when it came to light that Integra\u2019s export licence would expire before the date on which the cargo could likely be shipped out of Indonesia. In the second leg of the Transaction, CIC contracted on a CIF basis to sell the cargo to CPAG for a profit (the \u201cCIC-CPAG Contract\u201d). CPAG was also a middleman; so, in the third leg of the Transaction, CPAG was contracted to sell the cargo to the ultimate buyer, a Chinese company called Guangdong Guangqing Metal Technology Co Ltd (\u201cGGMT\u201d).', '13\\u2003The Transaction, unfortunately, ran into difficulties. There were delays in the loading and shipping of the cargo, which contained an insufficient quantity of ore and failed to meet specifications. The shipped cargo only contained 37,408 WMT of ore and it was certified to contain just 1.43% nickel. These problems caused CIC to suffer the following losses: (a) the wasted part-payment it made to Toshida for cargo which failed to meet specifications; (b) the cost of freight it incurred to deliver the ore to CPAG in China; (c) the dead freight it incurred as a result of unutilised freight space; (d) demurrage from delays in the loading and shipping; and (e) payment it had to make to CPAG to satisfy an arbitral award made in CPAG\u2019s favour as a result of CIC\u2019s failure to provide cargo which met the specifications of the CIC-CPAG Contract. 21', '14\\u2003CIC seeks, by the causes of action it brings in this suit (see [1] above), to pin the responsibility for such losses on the defendants. Naturally, this begs the question as to why CIC has not taken the commercially simpler course, and sued Toshida. Indeed, most of the above losses flow directly from the failure of the cargo to meet specifications. By contrast, to hold the defendants liable for the same losses, CIC needs to rely on causes of action which are obviously more challenging to establish. On this, I should highlight that CIC did, on 15 October 2019, file a notice of arbitration against Toshida. 22', 'However, CIC has concerns that any award it might be able to obtain would be unenforceable. This risk of unenforceability, CIC pleads, is also attributable to the defendants \u2013 specifically, their failure to ensure that: (a) the CIC-Toshida Contract was recorded in Bahasa Indonesia; and (b) the arbitration clause in this contract was valid. 23', 'The first failing allegedly renders the contract null and void as a matter of Indonesian law. So, even if it is able to successfully obtain an arbitral award against Toshida, this would not be enforceable in Indonesia. The defendants\u2019 second failing is also said to have a bearing on the enforceability of any arbitral award CIC might be able to obtain against Toshida. 24', '15\\u2003The present suit against the defendants is, therefore, an alternative means to reach the same end. Furthermore, I should also note that the arbitration with Toshida has yet to conclude. As such, if I find the defendants liable to CIC and make an order for the payment of damages, my decision would not be rendered otiose by the rule against double recovery. 25', 'I can therefore proceed to consider CIC\u2019s case without concern for these parallel proceedings.'"}
{"casename":"2022_SGHC_132","fact":"'2\\u2003The Applicant was convicted after trial on a charge of having in his possession for the purposes of trafficking drugs containing not less than 35.21 g of diamorphine. As he was found not to have been a courier and had not been given a certificate of substantive assistance, he was sentenced to death. In comparison, one Ranjit, who had been charged with trafficking by transferring the drugs to him, was found to be a courier and granted a certificate of substantive assistance; Ranjit was sentenced to life imprisonment and 15 strokes of the case. As it was, the Applicant\u2019s appeal to the Court of Appeal led to the upholding of his conviction, but the overturning of the finding by the trial court that he was not a courier: the Applicant was subsequently granted a certificate of substantive assistance and he was eventually sentenced by the Court of Appeal to life imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane.', '3\\u2003In April 2021, the Applicant sought review under s 394H CPC of the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision, asking that the conviction for trafficking be set aside; this was refused by the Court of Appeal, which found that the allegations raised were speculative and did not meet the threshold for review.', '4\\u2003Then in January 2022, the Applicant filed an application for one Hafiz to be brought to court under the Prisons Act. No basis was found for this, and the Court of Appeal dismissed this application in April 2022, finding it was an abuse of process.', '5\\u2003The Applicant now brings his application for leave to commence judicial review. Reading this far, one would perhaps have thought that the judicial review would have pertained to the decision concerning the diamorphine charge which led to the capital charge being imposed on him initially, which he then avoided by virtue of being a courier, and obtaining a certificate of substantive assistance.', '6\\u2003However, that is not the case. The present application is not in respect of any decision concerning the criminal act underlying the charge he was convicted of and sentenced on, which one would have thought would have at least been somewhat germane. Instead the Applicant now complains of a decision by the Public Prosecutor (\u201cPP\u201d) concerning another criminal act. As it was, aside from Ranjit passing drugs containing diamorphine to the Applicant, the Applicant passed a package of methamphetamine to Ranjit; Ranjit then passed it to one Mohamed Hafiz Bin Mohd Arifin, ie, the Hafiz who featured in the last application before the Court of Appeal. The Applicant was charged in respect of the methamphetamine, which did not attract capital punishment. This non-capital methamphetamine charge was stood down during the Applicant\u2019s trial on the capital charge concerning diamorphine. Following his conviction on the diamorphine charge, the methamphetamine charge was withdrawn under s 147(1) CPC. This withdrawal operates as an acquittal on the methamphetamine charge. The acquittal stands unless the conviction on the diamorphine charge is set aside: s 147(2) CPC.'"}

The SILE which administers the Part B Exams, subsequently determined that at least 11 students who sat for the 2020 Part B Exams had cheated. Those students re-took and passed the Part B Exams in 2021 and then applied to be admitted to the Bar. Leon was one of the 11 students. He filed his application to be admitted as an Advocate and Solicitor of the Supreme Court on 14 February 2022, and the first supporting affidavit on 22 March 2022, by way of AAS 35 of 2022 (the \u201cAdmission Application\u201d).', '5\\u2003The applications of the first six applicants, not including Leon, were heard by another High Court Judge (the \u201cJudge\u201d). As it transpired, one of the first six applicants, Kuek Yi Ting Lynn (\u201cMs Kuek\u201d), had colluded with Leon and cheated in the 2020 Part B Exams. The Attorney-General (the \u201cAG\u201d) objected to each of the first six applicants being admitted, on the basis that their misconduct in relation to the 2020 Part B Exams indicated a character issue that suggested that they were not fit and proper persons to be admitted as Advocates and Solicitors of the Supreme Court of Singapore. The six applicants did not seriously contest the adjournments requested by the AG. But there remained a question as to what should be done in respect of their applications. In Re CTA and other matters [2022] SGHC 87 (the \u201cFirst Judgment\u201d) issued on 18 April 2022, the Judge accepted the suggestion advanced by the AG for Ms Kuek\u2019s application to be adjourned for 12 months (and for the applications of each of the other five applicants to be adjourned for six months). This difference arose from the fact that the circumstances surrounding Ms Kuek\u2019s misconduct were different to those affecting the applications of the other five applicants. The Judge, of his own accord, also directed that the file be sealed, with the names of the six applicants redacted, evidently on the premise that this would promote their rehabilitation. The AG subsequently objected to the sealing and redaction, and sought and was granted leave to tender further arguments. After hearing the parties \u2013 and it may be noted that the applicants did not seriously contest the AG\u2019s position \u2013 the Judge rescinded his sealing and redaction order in Re Monisha Devaraj and other matters [2022] SGHC 93, on 27 April 2022 (the \u201cSecond Judgment\u201d).', '6\\u2003Leon\u2019s Admission Application was scheduled to be heard in the following month, on 11 May 2022. On 22 April 2022, which was after the release of the First Judgment, Leon applied in HC\/SUM 1625\/2022 for permission to withdraw his application for admission (the \u201cWithdrawal Application\u201d).

The AG objected to both the Withdrawal Application and the Sealing Order Application.', '7\\u2003The AG\u2019s objection to the applications arose out of the Applicant\u2019s conduct not only during but also after the 2020 Part B Exams. I have already outlined the fact of Leon\u2019s cheating in the 2020 Part B Exams. After the 2020 Part B Exams and while the Applicant was undergoing training with a law firm, he was asked to meet the Dean of the SILE and to provide the SILE with a copy of the notes that he had used to study for the 2020 Part B Exams and to which he may have referred during the said examinations. The meeting took place on 15 February 2021, during which the Applicant was shown his answer scripts, alongside Ms Kuek\u2019s answer scripts. When asked to explain the patent similarities in their scripts, the Applicant claimed that they had spent a significant amount of time studying together, and had prepared study notes together, which they intended to use when taking the examinations. Referring to such study notes would have been permissible since the examinations were held on an open-book basis. He also claimed that he and Ms Kuek had prepared some materials together, which were intended to be used as prepared answers that they could copy and paste during the 2020 Part B Exams. As a result, he claimed that they would likely end up with similar or even identical answers. After the meeting, on the same day, the SILE sent the Applicant a side-by-side comparison of his and Ms Kuek\u2019s answer scripts, copies of the examination papers and a copy of the Examination Rules, and informed the Applicant to reply with his written representations if he wished to do so.', '8\\u2003The Applicant replied on 16 February 2021 stating that his examination answers were based on his study notes, which were based on \u201cpast year papers\u201d, \u201cpractice sessions\u201d, and \u201cpre-written paragraphs collated from seniors\u201d. He also claimed that some of his answers to the SILE\u2019s questions at their meeting the day before \u201cmay not be fully accurate\u201d since the 2020 Part B Exams had taken place a few months ago.', '9\\u2003On 19 February 2021, the SILE informed the Applicant that many of the files he had submitted to the SILE on 15 February 2021 as his purported study notes were in PDF format and dated 15 February 2021 (which was after the 2020 Part B Exams). The SILE said this suggested that the files had been created on 15 February 2021 itself and led the SILE to \u201cstrongly question\u201d whether those were the documents to which the Applicant had referred during the 2020 Part B Exams. In addition, the SILE noted that a number of the files he had submitted \u201cmay be corrupted and [could not] be opened\u201d. The SILE requested the Applicant to send the SILE \u201cthe actual files that [he] would have consulted during the examinations\u201d, specifying that it expected to \u201csee the source documents which would be in a format other than PDF (e.g. Word), with the document information (e.g. dates of creation, authors etc.) intact\u201d. The Applicant complied with the request. Having reviewed the relevant materials, the Director of the Part B Course thought there was reason to believe that the Applicant had cheated and\/or facilitated the cheating of another student in the 2020 Part B Exams, and reported this to the Student Disciplinary Committee (\u201cSDC\u201d) on 2 March 2021, pursuant to rules 10(2)(a), (c) and (e) of the Legal Profession (Admission) Rules 2011 (the \u201cAdmission Rules\u201d).', '10\\u2003The SDC then conducted its inquiry. The SDC reviewed the scripts of the Applicant and Ms Kuek in relation to all six subjects that were tested at the 2020 Part B Exams. The SDC also sought the views of the subject coordinators of the six subjects, and considered the representations made by the Applicant during the interview on 15 February 2021, as well as his written representations in his e-mail to SILE dated 16 February 2021 and the study notes he had submitted on 15 and 19 February 2021. While the SDC inquiry was ongoing, the Applicant was told to be forthcoming about any knowledge or information that would assist the investigation. He did not come forward with further explanations. In relation to Leon, the SDC gave him the benefit of the doubt for three of the six subjects but rejected his explanations for the other three subjects. The SDC concluded that some of the errors in the answer scripts, in particular, the application of the law to the fact patterns raised in the examination questions and the summaries of the facts that were reflected in the answer scripts submitted by Leon and by Ms Kuek, were such that these could not have been prepared in advance. Accordingly, the SDC concluded that Leon had cheated in these three subjects, and arising from this finding, it also concluded that he had acted fraudulently or dishonestly in his dealings with the SILE. After concluding its inquiry, on 8 April 2021, the SDC gave notice pursuant to r 11(1)(a) of the Admission Rules inviting Leon to show cause in writing within 21 days from the date of the letter, as to why he should not be dealt with by the Board of Directors of the SILE under r 12 of the Admission Rules, pursuant to which the Board of Directors may take certain actions, including the imposition of sanctions, on a student of the Part B Course. Leon did not attempt to show cause. According to the explanation he subsequently furnished, he said he respected the decision of the SDC and did not wish to challenge it. The SILE then issued a notice dated 22 June 2021 under r 12(5) of the Admission Rules, stating that the Board of Directors of the SILE had decided to refuse to issue to the Applicant the certificate referred to in r 25(4)(a) of the Admission Rules, which was a necessary pre-requisite for a candidate to be considered for admission to the Bar, until Leon had attended and passed the Part B Exams in 2021 (the \u201cSILE Notice\u201d). Leon subsequently sat for the Part B Exams in 2021 and passed all the subjects.', '11\\u2003Having passed the Part B Exams in 2021, Leon then took steps to make the present Admission Application on 14 February 2022. Prior to filing the supporting affidavit accompanying the Admission Application, he wrote to the SILE on 22 and 28 February 2022, and inquired as to what further details he needed to furnish in the affidavit for admission concerning the circumstances surrounding the cheating incident. He specifically asked what further details he needed to declare, besides disclosing the existence of the SILE Notice. He was told in response that aside from the SILE Notice, he should \u201cprovide sufficient information to enable all parties concerned to understand the matter\u201d. In the affidavit dated 22 March 2022 accompanying his Admission Application, however, Leon did not disclose the cheating incident and only mentioned that he had been issued the SILE Notice. These papers were served on the relevant stakeholders, namely, the AG, the Law Society and the SILE (collectively, the \u201cStakeholders\u201d).', '12\\u2003Upon receiving Leon\u2019s first affidavit, the AG sought further details as to why the SILE Notice had been issued. In response, Leon filed his first supplementary affidavit on 8 April 2022. In it, he explained that the SILE Notice had been issued because the Director of the Part B Course had reported to the SDC that \u201cthere was reason to believe that there was collaboration with another student of the Part B Course, based on similarities in answer scripts for certain subjects\u201d. Nothing further was disclosed as to what the SDC said or what it had found or recommended. Nor was any report of the SDC, or for that matter, any other document exhibited.', '13\\u2003On 14 April 2022, the AG wrote to Leon, requesting that further particulars be provided as to the findings of the SDC. On 22 April 2022, Leon filed his second supplementary affidavit, which eventually disclosed the findings of the SDC as well as the correspondence surrounding the SDC inquiry. He also revealed that he had struggled with a mental health issue over the preceding two years and that he had to contend with some personal family issues. He apologised for the lack of particulars and disclosures in the previous affidavits, and stated that he had \u201cwrongly thought\u201d that disclosing the SILE Notice would suffice for the purposes of the affidavit, since it described the outcome of the disciplinary proceedings.', '14\\u2003I digress to observe that at the hearing before me, I inquired about the certificates of good conduct that had been issued by the solicitor who supervised Leon\u2019s training as well as by two character referees in support of the Admission Application. I asked whether Leon had disclosed the facts and circumstances pertaining to the cheating incident to his supervising solicitor or to his character referees. Through counsel, he informed me that he had not disclosed this to his supervising solicitor but that he had conveyed the relevant facts to his character referees. Later in the course of the hearing, after a short break, I was informed by Leon\u2019s counsel, Ms Luo Ling Ling (\u201cMs Luo\u201d), that acting on his instructions during the break, she had called the supervising solicitor to disclose the relevant facts.', '15\\u2003On 20 April 2022, shortly after the release of the First Judgment and just prior to the filing of his second supplementary affidavit, Leon wrote to the Stakeholders to notify them of his intention to withdraw the Admission Application. He also sought their consent to his proposed course of action. In his Withdrawal Application, which was filed thereafter, Leon stated that he had failed to display the requisite values of honesty and integrity, and that he was not a fit and proper person to be admitted to the Bar. At about the same time, he also wrote to the Supreme Court Registry, requesting that his personal particulars including his name be redacted so that it would not be accessible through an e-Litigation search. This had been done for the first six applicants following the First Judgment. Leon then filed the Sealing Order Application on 28 April 2022, which the AG and the Law Society objected to. The primary ground advanced for this was first, that there was no public interest in the Applicant\u2019s identity since he was withdrawing his Admission Application; and second, the Applicant asserted that he suffered from a mental health condition which he claimed had been exacerbated by his anxiety over the public exposure of the First Judgment and the public outcry and reactions, especially on social media. He adduced a medical memo prepared by Professor Kua Ee Heok of the National University of Singapore (\u201cProfessor Kua\u201d), who opined that the disclosure of Leon\u2019s name \u201ccould\u201d trigger a severe psychiatric reaction. I directed the Registry to redact and seal the file until such time as I had heard the parties and ruled on the Sealing Order Application.'"}

The first and third loans are not germane to this \ninquiry since the debts are disputed and triable issues have been made out.\n19 The Plaintiff refers to their expert\u2019s assessment, who concluded that \neven taking into account the funds of the group as a whole, there would be an \ninability to pay the consolidated liabilities. \n20 The Defendant argues against this, pointing out that the expert\u2019s \nassessment includes the first and third loans, and did not include a A$1 million \nprovision by one of its other shareholders, one Mr Kwee, which is being held in \nescrow for the group\u2019s business. \n21 As noted by the Defendant, the problem with the expert\u2019s assessment is \nthat it takes into account the first and third loans as current liabilities, which \nshould be excluded from the analysis as they are disputed. And I am satisfied \non the evidence before me at this time that there are funds available, on a \ncommercial assessment, that would meet the amount due on the second loan, \nwhich is, in any event, payable only in August 2022.

To facilitate this potential share sale, the judicial managers conducted an internal restructuring of HTLI where the ownership of the shares in most of the subsidiaries was transferred to HTL Capital Pte Ltd (\u201cHTL Capital\u201d). HTL Capital was a newly incorporated entity and was wholly owned by HTLI. 12', 'The other remaining operating subsidiary of the HTL Group was HTL Manufacturing Pte Ltd (\u201cHTLM\u201d), which was the main revenue-generating subsidiary of the group. 13', 'Thus, after the internal restructuring, HTLI now owned just two subsidiaries \u2013 HTL Capital and HTLM.', '11\\u2003The judicial managers then engaged in a transparent sale process which considered the competing offers. They exercised their commercial judgment and sold HTLI\u2019s shares in HTL Capital and HTLM to Golden Hill. The sale of the shares was completed on 7 September 2020 (\u201cShare Sale\u201d). 14', 'What is also relevant is that Mr Phua YT and Mr Phua YP are the beneficial owners of Golden Hill. 15', 'The Shareholders objected to the sale of the shares and preferred the other offer from Man Wah Holdings Ltd (\u201cMan Wah\u201d) instead. 16', '12\\u2003Dissatisfied with the judicial managers\u2019 decision to sell the shares to Golden Hill instead of Man Wah, on 15 September 2020, the Shareholders brought an application in Originating Summons No 425 of 2020 (Summons No 3963 of 2020) to set aside the sale of the shares and to direct the judicial managers to accept Man Wah\u2019s offer. The application was dismissed in Re HTL International Holdings Pte Ltd [2021] 5 SLR 586 (\u201cHTL International (HC)\u201d) as I found that the judicial managers\u2019 decision to prefer a sale to Golden Hill instead of Man Wah did not cause prejudice to the Shareholders as the sale was in the interests of the creditors and shareholders as a whole and fair consideration was given to both offers (at [47] and [83]). The Shareholders then filed an appeal against that decision. The Court of Appeal found that there was no merit to the appeal as the judicial managers did not act unfairly in selling the shares to Golden Hill instead of Man Wah, and dismissed it on 8 September 2021 in Yihua Lifestyle Technology Co, Ltd and another v HTL International Holdings Pte Ltd and others [2021] 2 SLR 1141 (\u201cHTL International (CA)\u201d). 17', '13\\u2003In parallel with the proceedings in Singapore, when the judicial management order was made on 13 July 2020, Yihua had commenced legal proceedings abroad before the Shantou Intermediate People\u2019s Court of Guangdong province in Suit No 534 of 2020 (\u201cPRC Suit 534\u201d) against Mr Phua YT and Mr Phua YP, and HTLI.

In the Eighth Police Report, Mr Zuhairi denied making most of the statements attributed to him in Mr Ravi\u2019s First Affidavit.', '8\\u2003After Ms Lim\u2019s Affidavit was filed, Sum 4680\/2021 was filed on 8 October 2021. This was an application for leave to amend OS 825\/2021 to include an additional prayer for a declaration that the AG and\/or the State Counsel conducting OS 825\/2021 had breached rr 15 and 29 of the PCR by filing Ms Lim\u2019s Affidavit. It was contended this affidavit \u201coccasion[ed] a breach of fair trial\u201d. In support, Mr Suhail filed an affidavit on behalf of all the plaintiffs, contending that paragraph 9 of Ms Lim\u2019s Affidavit, which stated that the Eighth Police Report \u201craises serious doubts about the veracity of the claims made in Mr Ravi\u2019s affidavit and calls into question the entire basis for SUM 4462\u201d (\u201cMs Lim\u2019s Statement\u201d), was an allegation that Mr Ravi had falsified the contents of the plaintiffs\u2019 affidavits. He contended that, because of this, the State Counsel ought to have given notice to Mr Ravi and accorded him a chance to respond. Their not having done so, Mr Suhail deposed, raised questions about their impartiality.', '9\\u2003I heard and dismissed Sum 4462\/2021 and Sum 4680\/2021 with brief oral reasons on 14 October 2021, reserving the issue of costs to the hearing of OS 825\/2021. OS 825\/2021 was heard on 8 November 2021. In written judgment on 2 December 2021, I dismissed OS 825\/2021 in Syed Suhail (OS 825\/2021) and gave full reasons for the decisions in Sum 4462\/2021 and Sum 4680\/2021. I further directed counsel to address the court on costs of the various applications within 14 days.', '10\\u2003Costs ordinarily follow the event. Arising from the various positions highlighted at [2], the issues were, first, whether either Mr Ravi and\/or Mr Cheng ought to bear personal liability for those costs, and second, if so, the quantum of such costs.'"}

The aims of the MTF are, inter alia, to direct the whole-of-Government response to the novel COVID-19 outbreak, coordinate the community response to protect Singaporeans, and work with the international community to respond to the outbreak. 1', 'This application is concerned with two aspects of the Government\u2019s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, namely: 2', '(a)\\u2003The decision announced on 8 November 2021 that COVID-19 patients who are unvaccinated by choice would be charged for their COVID-19 medical bills from 8 December 2021 (the \u201cUnvaccinated Medical Bills Policy\u201d).', '(b)\\u2003The guidance in paragraph 7(c) of the \u201cUpdated Advisory on COVID-19 Vaccination at the Workplace\u201d dated 23 October 2021 (the \u201cOctober Advisory\u201d). The October Advisory was issued to employers by the Ministry of Manpower (\u201cMOM\u201d), the Singapore National Employers Federation (\u201cSNEF\u201d) and the National Trade Unions Congress (\u201cNTUC\u201d) (collectively, the \u201cTripartite Partners\u201d). Paragraph 7(c) of the October Advisory pertained to unvaccinated employees who were unable to be physically present at the workplace under the Workforce Vaccination Measures (the \u201cWVMs\u201d) that came into effect on 1 January 2022.', '3\\u2003The Applicants seek leave to apply for remedies against the responses by the Government (see [2(a)]\u2013[2(b)]). 3', '4\\u2003As set out at [2(a)], the Unvaccinated Medical Bills Policy is a policy decision not to extend full coverage of COVID-19 medical bills to COVID-19 patients who are eligible for vaccination but have opted against it (the \u201cunvaccinated by choice\u201d). The MTF and the Ministry of Health (\u201cMOH\u201d) announced the Unvaccinated Medical Bills Policy on 8 November 2021. 4', '5\\u2003Dr Heng Mok Kwee Derrick (\u201cDr Heng\u201d), the Deputy Director of Medical Services (Public Health Group) at MOH, explains that the Government\u2019s decision to provide full coverage of COVID-19 medical bills incurred in public hospitals was a departure from the usual healthcare financing model. 5', 'This arose from the Government\u2019s recognition of COVID-19 as an emergent and unfamiliar disease. 6', 'The default position is that patients who receive medical treatment in Singapore are expected to be responsible for their own medical bills. 7', 'For Singapore Citizens \/ Permanent Residents, there are tiers of support in the form of Government subsidies, such as MediShield Life, MediSave and MediFund. 8', 'Dr Heng deposes that the Unvaccinated Medical Bills Policy is therefore a return to the norm of regular healthcare financing in respect of the unvaccinated by choice. 9', '6\\u2003The present application is concerned only with paragraph 7(c) of the October Advisory (see [2(b)]). I set out the policy changes related to the October Advisory to provide the necessary background.', '7\\u2003On 23 October 2021, the MTF and MOM announced the implementation of the WVMs, which took effect from 1 January 2022. 10', 'The announcement is set out as follows:', '(a)\\u2003Only employees who are fully vaccinated, or have recovered from COVID-19 within the past 270 days, can return to the workplace.', '(b)\\u2003Unvaccinated employees will not be allowed to return to the workplace unless they have tested negative for COVID-19 on a Pre-Event Test (\u201cPET\u201d) that is valid for the duration that they are required to be present at the workplace. The costs of the PET are to be borne by these employees.', '(c)\\u2003Employees who are medically ineligible for vaccination are exempted from the WVMs if they need to work on-site.', '8\\u2003In connection with the announcement on 23 October 2021 (see [7]), the Tripartite Partners issued the October Advisory to provide guidance to employers and employees on the work arrangements that employers can make to manage their unvaccinated employees who are unable to be physically present at the workplace under the WVMs. 11', '9\\u2003To fully appreciate paragraph 7(c), it is appropriate to consider it within the context of paragraphs 6 \u2013 7 of the October Advisory as they set out guidance to employers on work arrangements for unvaccinated employees. The relevant paragraphs are replicated in full below.', '10\\u2003For completeness, I mention that on 26 December 2021, the MTF and MOM announced, inter alia, the removal of the concession for unvaccinated employees to return to the workplace upon providing a negative PET result from 15 January 2022. 12', 'Following the announcement on 26 December 2021, the Tripartite Partners updated the October Advisory to reflect the changes announced (the \u201cDecember Advisory\u201d). 13', 'Even so, paragraph 6(c) of the December Advisory substantially mirrors paragraph 7(c) of the October Advisory.', '11\\u2003According to Mr Then Yee Thoong (\u201cMr Then\u201d), the representative and Divisional Director of the Labour Relations and Workplaces Division of the MOM, the WVMs followed the vaccination-differentiated safe management measures implemented in the broader social and community context, such as stricter limits on the number of persons dining out at food and beverage establishments for unvaccinated persons as compared to vaccinated persons. 14', '12\\u2003The Applicants seek the following orders:', '13\\u2003It must be noted that the Applicants\u2019 use of Alleged Unvaccinated Medical Bills Directive and Alleged Employment Directive refer in substance to the Unvaccinated Medical Bills Policy and paragraph 7(c) of the October Advisory respectively. For clarity, I will adopt the latter two references as they properly identify the subject-matter of the Applicants\u2019 challenge. Further, I shall refer to [12(e)]\u2013[12(f)] collectively as the Substantive Legitimate Expectation Claims, or the SLE Claims.', '14\\u2003I make another preliminary observation on the orders sought. The orders are not felicitously drafted. First, the Applicants have not expressly indicated which grounds they intend to rely on in seeking the quashing orders (see [12(a)]\u2013[12(b)] above). Second, they seek declarations that the Unvaccinated Medical Bills Policy and paragraph 7(c) of the October Advisory are \u201cunlawful and\/or irrational\u201d (see [12(c)]\u2013[12(d)]). There is latent ambiguity in what constitutes unlawfulness as a ground of challenge. Unlawfulness is not an established ground of challenge. The Applicants do not provide any clarity on the particular \u201cunlawful\u201d ground they intend to rest their challenge on in their submissions to the court. In fact, the Applicants\u2019 written submissions refer only to \u201cunreasonableness\u201d and \u201cirrationality\u201d. I understand unreasonableness and irrationality to be the same ground of judicial review, which is the ground of irrationality. The ground of irrationality pertains to a decision that is unreasonable (see [25(b)] below). The Applicants also challenge the Unvaccinated Medical Bills Policy and the October Advisory on the basis that they \u201cdiscriminate against the unvaccinated people\u201d. 21', 'However, they have not explicitly stated the basis for their challenge. It can only be surmised that the Applicants intended to submit that the Unvaccinated Medical Bills Policy and the October Advisory are in contravention of the equal protection clause in the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1985 Rev Ed, 1999 Reprint) (the \u201cConstitution\u201d), ie, Art 12(1) of the Constitution. Thus, the Applicants have only expressly relied on irrationality as a ground of challenge for the declarations sought (see [12(c)]\u2013[12(d)]). Despite the lack of clarity, I will take the application at its highest in order to deal with the matter expeditiously (see below at [44]).'"}

{"casename":"2022_SGHC_143","fact":"'3\\u2003The parties married on 21 March 1981. They subsequently divorced on 13 November 1983 and remarried on 3 April 1984. The parties divorced again on 25 January 2017. It is undisputed that throughout their second marriage, the plaintiff was the sole breadwinner while the defendant was a housewife. The parties have four children, who were called as witnesses by the defendant at the trial. They are, in descending order of seniority:', '(a)\\u2003Munirah Abdul Salam (\u201cMunirah\u201d), the eldest daughter;', '(b)\\u2003Mohammad Noh Abdul Salam (\u201cMohammad Noh\u201d), the only son;', '(c)\\u2003Khatijah Abdul Salam (\u201cKhatijah\u201d), the second daughter; and', '(d)\\u2003Fatimah Abdul Salam (\u201cFatimah\u201d), the third daughter.', 'The plaintiff had originally brought claims against the four children as well on the basis that the defendant distributed certain sums of monies to them from the Salary Account and the Savings Account (as defined at [9] and [16] below respectively). The plaintiff discontinued these claims with costs on 22 December 2021.', '4\\u2003The parties bought and sold several properties over the course of their second marriage. Their first purchase was a resale unit in Boon Lay in late 1984 in their joint names. This was subsequently sold in 1990 for negligible profit. Their second purchase, in 1989, was a flat at Block 950 Jurong West Street 91, #02-641 Singapore 640950 (\u201cthe Jurong West flat\u201d) for around $80,000 in their joint names. This was sold in 2002 for $289,000. The net sale proceeds were $156,868.08.', '5\\u2003In early 2000, before the Jurong West flat was sold, the plaintiff purchased the Teban Gardens flat in his sole name. The defendant accepts that the Teban Gardens flat was purchased using only the plaintiff\u2019s CPF monies. However, she asserts that she contributed towards the renovation costs for the Teban Gardens flat from the sale proceeds of the Jurong West flat. Nothing of substance turns on this assertion.', '6\\u2003In the first half of 2006, Corporation Rise was purchased by the plaintiff, the defendant, Munirah and Mohammad Noh as joint tenants. At that time, the Teban Gardens flat had not been sold. A housing loan for Corporation Rise was taken by all the purchasers. The defendant submits that the plaintiff and Mohammad Noh contributed towards the downpayment of Corporation Rise, with the latter\u2019s contribution being between $10,000 to $12,000. However, the plaintiff denies that Mohammad Noh made any contribution, his position being that he was the sole contributor.', '7\\u2003It is undisputed that the plaintiff made a public announcement at the defendant\u2019s 50th birthday celebrations on 26 March 2006 that Corporation Rise had been purchased. However, the parties disagree on whether the plaintiff had said on that occasion that he had purchased Corporation Rise as a gift for the defendant. I set out the circumstances in which Corporation Rise was purchased in greater detail at [37]\u2013[38] below.', '8\\u2003As the family stayed in Corporation Rise, the Teban Gardens flat was rented out. Part of the rental proceeds was used towards payment of the monthly instalments for the housing loan for Corporation Rise. The defendant made no contributions towards the remainder of the monthly instalments, though it is in dispute as to whether Munirah and Mohammad Noh contributed. Corporation Rise was sold sometime between 2009 to 2010 resulting in net sale proceeds of $500,000 (\u201cthe Corporation Rise Proceeds\u201d). The parties agreed that the Corporation Rise Proceeds would be split equally between them to enable each to purchase insurance policies of $250,000 in their respective names. To this end, two policies for $200,000 and $50,000 were purchased by the plaintiff in April 2010, leaving the Balance Corporation Rise Proceeds in the defendant\u2019s hands. However, as the defendant did not purchase any insurance policies in her name, the Balance Corporation Rise Proceeds remained in an account in her name. As noted earlier at [1], the plaintiff claims this sum. I should add that the defendant asserts that the Balance Corporation Rise Proceeds were subsequently used to meet the expenses of the family. This is relevant to the plaintiff\u2019s claim for the Balance Corporation Rise Proceeds.', '9\\u2003The Teban Gardens flat was sold on 13 April 2011 for $520,000 resulting in the Teban Gardens Proceeds of $354,500.80. The cashier\u2019s order for the Teban Gardens Proceeds was banked into the parties\u2019 joint Post Office Savings Bank (\u201cPOSB\u201d) account (\u201cthe Savings Account\u201d). The circumstances surrounding the deposit of the cashier\u2019s order in the Savings Account are in issue. The plaintiff claims that he had instructed the defendant to deposit the cashier\u2019s order in a POSB account in his sole name (\u201cthe Salary Account\u201d). On the other hand, the defendant claims that the plaintiff told her that the Teban Gardens Proceeds were a gift to her and instructed her to deposit the cashier\u2019s order in the Savings Account. I address this at [58]\u2013[64] below. The defendant similarly asserts that the Teban Gardens Proceeds were subsequently used to meet the expenses of the family. Again, this is relevant to the plaintiff\u2019s claim for the Teban Gardens Proceeds.', '10\\u2003Several bank accounts were used by the parties over the course of their marriages and four are of significance in this action.', '11\\u2003The first is POSB account number 248-62383-7 in the defendant\u2019s sole name. I shall refer to this as the \u201cdefendant\u2019s Personal Account\u201d.', '12\\u2003The second is an United Overseas Bank (\u201cUOB\u201d) account in the joint names of the defendant and Khatijah. I shall refer to this as the \u201cUOB Account\u201d. The defendant transferred $100,000 from the Savings Account to the UOB Account on or about 27 July 2011, this being a portion of the Teban Gardens Proceeds.', '13\\u2003 The third is POSB account number 248-11980-2, which is the Savings Account. The Savings Account was opened in 1984 in the joint names of the parties for the purposes of paying for groceries, expenses of the children\u2019s education, and ancillary expenses of the family.', '14\\u2003The Savings Account was closed on or about 23 June 2012. It is common ground that following its closure, a total of $272,611.17 (\u201cthe 23 June 2012 Transfer Amount\u201d) was transferred from the Savings Account to the defendant\u2019s Personal Account (\u201cthe 23 June 2012 Transfer\u201d). It is disputed whether both parties were, or just the defendant was, present when the Savings Account was closed and the 23 June 2012 Transfer took place. I address this at [65]\u2013[70] below. Nonetheless, the parties are in agreement that the 23 June 2012 Transfer Amount comprised the following sums:', '(a)\\u2003 The balance of the Teban Gardens Proceeds of $254,500.80 (after deducting the $100,000 that was transferred out on 27 July 2011 (see [12] above)).', '(b)\\u2003And a further sum of $18,110.37 in the Savings Account that was unrelated to the Teban Gardens Proceeds.', '15\\u2003I pause to note that the plaintiff has not made a claim for all of the 23 June 2012 Transfer Amount (see [20]\u2013[21] below). His claim is restricted to the Teban Gardens Proceeds only. Accordingly, the claim concerns only that part of the 23 June 2012 Transfer that relates to the Teban Gardens Proceeds, the sum of $254,500.80 (see [14(a)] above), and the sum of $100,000 that was transferred on 27 July 2011 (see [12] above). That leaves the sum of $18,110.37 which was part of the 23 June 2012 Transfer Amount but is not related to the Teban Gardens Proceeds. The plaintiff makes no claim over this sum. In any case, it is the defendant\u2019s position that all of the 23 June 2012 Transfer Amount was also gifted to her by the plaintiff and that \u201cshe was free to do whatever she wanted with it\u201d. In other words, the defendant\u2019s position is that the sum of $18,110.37 was also gifted to her. As the plaintiff has only claimed the Teban Gardens Proceeds, it is not necessary for me to consider whether the $18,110.37 was also gifted by the plaintiff to the defendant. I say no more on this point. It suffices for me to consider whether (a) the Teban Gardens Proceeds were gifted by the plaintiff to the defendant when the Teban Gardens flat was sold on 13 April 2011, and (b) the plaintiff reaffirmed his intention when the Savings Account was closed and the 23 June 2012 Transfer occurred (see [58] below).', '16\\u2003The fourth is the Salary Account with POSB account number 103-78050-0. The Salary Account was opened in 1984 in the sole name of the plaintiff. The plaintiff\u2019s salary was credited into this account. The funds in the Salary Account were used to top up the Savings Account to meet the needs of the family.

This resulted in Viking Engineering becoming a minority shareholder with a 30% shareholding in VIG. The SPA obliged Mr Feen to abide by various undertakings. In particular, clause 5.1 of the SPA (\u201cClause 5.1\u201d) provided that Mr Feen was to change VIG\u2019s name to \u201cFeen Marine Pte Ltd\u201d or some other name agreed between the parties (\u201cthe Name-change Obligation\u201d). The same clause also provided that Mr Feen was not to use the \u201cViking\u201d name in any manner which may compete with the business of Viking Engineering, or be associated with or perceived to be associated with Viking Engineering (\u201cthe Non-use Obligation\u201d). Under Clause 5.3, Viking Engineering and Mr Feen were to use their best endeavours to procure a contract for a new inert gas system (\u201cIGS\u201d) and exhaust gas cleaning project for VIG.', '4\\u2003On 4 April 2017, Viking Engineering commenced Suit No 294 of 2017 (\u201cS 294\/2017\u201d), as minority shareholder of VIG, seeking various injunctions and remedies for minority oppression under s 216 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (\u201cCA\u201d) against the first to fourth defendants. Viking Engineering contended that, contrary to the SPA, Mr Feen failed to change the name of VIG to \u201cFeen Marine Pte Ltd\u201d. Instead, he incorporated a new company of the same name, being the second defendant (\u201cFeen Marine\u201d). Mr Feen thereafter transferred his entire shareholding in VIG to Feen Marine without first giving Viking Engineering the option of buying his shares. Viking Engineering contended that this action contravened Article 28 of VIG\u2019s articles of association. The business and corporate opportunities of VIG were alleged to have subsequently been diverted to Feen Marine; the fourth defendant, Scanjet Feen IGS Pte Ltd (\u201cScanjet Feen\u201d); and the fifth defendant, Feen Marine Scrubbers Pte Ltd (\u201cFeen Marine Scrubbers\u201d). Mr Feen was the sole director of each of these companies, collectively referred to as \u201cthe Feen Companies\u201d. Various claims were also made in relation to loans made to VIG and items said to have been taken from Viking Engineering\u2019s premises by VIG.', '5\\u2003Viking Engineering then followed on with Summons No 4101 of 2017 seeking summary judgment in S 294\/2017. On 24 November 2017, leave was given to Viking Engineering to amend its summons to include a prayer (as prayed for in its Statement of Claim) for a buy-out of its shares in VIG by Mr Feen.', '6\\u2003On 14 February 2018, I granted an injunction to restrain Mr Feen and his agents from using the name \u201cViking\u201d in any manner which may compete with the business of Viking Engineering or be associated with or perceived to be associated with Viking Engineering or the business of Viking Engineering. I also ordered Mr Feen to purchase Viking Engineering\u2019s entire shareholding in VIG, with an independent valuer to be appointed to ascertain the fair value of the shares by agreement within 14 days of final judgment. Counsel for the defendants asked for time to submit on whether a discount ought to be applied by the valuer to Viking Engineering\u2019s minority holding in VIG. 2', 'At the same time, after Viking Engineering contended that there was also evidence of diversion of business opportunities from VIG to Feen Marine Scrubbers, the latter was added by consent as the fifth defendant.', '7\\u2003On 9 April 2018, after hearing parties on the question of whether a discount for Viking Engineering\u2019s minority shareholding should apply, I held that no discount should be applied. I also ordered that the valuer make adjustments, as part of his valuation, for the diversion of opportunities to the Feen Companies. On the same date, in the course of finalising the form of the final orders, parties agreed that the cost of the valuation exercise would be borne by Mr Feen.', '8\\u2003The orders arising out of the summary judgment application were therefore the following:', '9\\u2003To complete the background on the summary judgment application, I should mention that whilst I granted summary judgment on 14 February 2018 as described above, unconditional leave to defend was given on the same date in respect of the remainder of the claims; these claims were not related to my finding of minority oppression, and remedies for these claims were not related to the remedies arising out of the minority oppression. These included claims that Mr Feen, as sole director of VIG, failed to cause VIG to repay loans made by Viking Engineering to VIG and sums that Viking Engineering had paid on VIG\u2019s behalf; and that VIG unlawfully took items from Viking Engineering\u2019s premises. 3', 'These claims (and a related counterclaim by VIG) were subsequently settled by parties on 6 July 2018, 4', 'and VIG\u2019s name was changed to Stokke Engineering Pte Ltd on 24 July 2018. 5', '10\\u2003Matters subsequent were less harmonious and have been detailed in Viking Engineering Pte Ltd v Feen, Bjornar and others [2019] SGHC 158, Viking Engineering Pte Ltd v Feen, Bjornar and others and another matter [2020] SGHC 78 and Feen, Bjornar and others v Viking Engineering Pte Ltd and another appeal and another matter [2021] 1 SLR 497.'"}

What I can see from the statement of facts is that there was perhaps a long gestation, but not necessarily minute planning throughout that period.', '7\\u2003I also accept that there was exploitation of the victim, who was in a vulnerable state, as she was unconscious, naked and blindfolded.

In preparation for this report, he interviewed Saridewi on 14 and 22 October 2020.', '17\\u2003In Dr Rajesh\u2019s 1st Report, he set out an opinion that Saridewi was suffering from persistent depressive disorder and amphetamine-type substance use disorder \u201cat the material time of the offence\u201d. 27', 'He explained that \u201ccomorbid substance abuse, depression and dysthymia are common\u201d as individuals \u201cwith depression and dysthymia often resort to drug use as a means of coping with their negative emotional state\u201d. 28', 'Dr Rajesh opined that Dr Lam\u2019s opinion was disregarded by the court as \u201cthe link between drug use and mental disorders was not properly explained in her report\u201d. 29', 'He further explained the possibility that comorbid mental disorders can coexist with drug use and can be diagnosed even in individuals using drugs. As such, he concluded that Saridewi had been suffering from an abnormality of mind at the material time of the offence, due to her mental disorders which had impaired her judgment and ability to make rational decisions. 30', '18\\u2003Dr Rajesh noted that Saridewi\u2019s reported methamphetamine use was documented in a drug withdrawal assessment form used by the SPS on 18 June 2016. 31', 'However, the withdrawal symptoms and signs of methamphetamine withdrawal are very different from the items that are mentioned on the drug withdrawal assessment form that the prison medical officers used. 32', 'Dr Rajesh stated that the drug withdrawal assessment form used by the SPS is tailored predominantly to account for symptoms and signs of heroin (the street name for diamorphine) withdrawal. These include nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, running nose, dilated pupils, yawning and piloerection. 33', '19\\u2003Dr Rajesh also outlined the diagnostic criteria for stimulant withdrawal as set out in the American Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (American Psychiatric Association Publishing, 5th Ed, 2013) (\u201cDSM-V\u201d). 34', 'This consists essentially of dysphoric mood and two (or more) of the following physiological changes developing within a few hours to several days after cessation of (or reduction in) prolonged amphetamine-type substance, cocaine or other stimulant use:', '20\\u2003According to the DSM-V, the above signs or symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning. The DSM-V also specifies that the signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are not better explained by another mental disorder, including intoxication or withdrawal from another substance. 35', 'The drug withdrawal assessment form used in prison settings did not include items related to methamphetamine withdrawal as mentioned in the DSM-V.', '21\\u2003Dr Rajesh opined that Saridewi had been suffering from amphetamine withdrawal during the statement-taking period. 36', 'In his interviews with Saridewi, she reported that she had experienced both the symptoms of a \u201ccrash\u201d and the withdrawal symptoms which set in after a crash during her lock-up. 37', 'He explained that chronic methamphetamine users first experience a \u201ccrash\u201d commencing 12 to 24 hours after the last use, which is characterised by exhaustion, fatigue and sleep disturbances (typically, excessive sleep). This subsides within two to four days and is followed by the withdrawal phase. The withdrawal phase sets in two to four days after last use, peaks in seven to ten days and subsides over two to four weeks. 38', '22\\u2003Dr Rajesh was of the view that Saridewi was experiencing methamphetamine withdrawal symptoms from 18 to 20 June 2016, during her observation at Changi Women\u2019s Prison (\u201cCWP\u201d), based on her reporting of excessive sleepiness, feelings of fatigue and sadness to Dr Lam and himself. 39', 'He stated that the prison medical officers\u2019 assessment that she was negative for non-opioid withdrawal was erroneous as the structured drug withdrawal assessment form used by the SPS was not specifically designed to pick up signs of methamphetamine withdrawal. 40', '23\\u2003Dr Rajesh further stated that it was plausible that symptoms of methamphetamine withdrawal would have been missed by the physicians who examined her at the time. The structured drug withdrawal assessment form used by the SPS to assess drug withdrawal is not designed to capture symptoms and signs of methamphetamine withdrawal, hence the relevant questions specific to methamphetamine withdrawal were not asked. 41', 'Furthermore, Dr Rajesh stated that the physicians and nurses only saw her \u201ccross-sectionally\u201d and there was no longitudinal assessment over several days which was necessary to observe withdrawal symptoms. 42', 'He opined in his 3rd Report that Saridewi was \u201cprobably\u201d suffering from moderate withdrawal at the time her statements were taken. 43', '24\\u2003Dr Rajesh further attached to his 3rd Report an amphetamine withdrawal questionnaire (\u201cAWQ\u201d) which is used in addiction settings in New Zealand that \u201celucidates the withdrawal symptoms\u201d. 44', 'He administered the AWQ to Saridewi on 22 October 2020 and found that she had met several of the questionnaire criteria. 45', 'Accordingly, Dr Rajesh opined that Saridewi had been suffering from amphetamine withdrawal between 18 and 24 June 2016. 46', '25\\u2003As for the limitations of the AWQ, Dr Rajesh acknowledged that the AWQ is not used in clinical practice in Singapore and needs to be administered within the 24-hour period after a patient is admitted to an inpatient unit, so that the limitation of retrospective recall is minimised. 47', 'Nonetheless, the AWQ is routinely used in Australia and New Zealand and has been validated for clinical use. 48', 'He also explained that the reason that he had used the questionnaire was to respond to the Court of Appeal\u2019s queries on the extent of Saridewi\u2019s condition (at [4] above). 49', 'Dr Rajesh stated that the symptoms that Saridewi displayed included excessive sleepiness, fatigue, increased appetite and going into \u201cshut down mode\u201d (in her words) after her arrest due to methamphetamine withdrawal. This was corroborated by the entry of a nurse, Maria Rhodora Vinluan Isla (\u201cMs Maria\u201d) who documented that she \u201clook[ed] lethargic\u201d on 20 June 2016. 50', 'Another nurse, Zawiyah Bte Amat (\u201cMs Zawiyah\u201d) recorded her pulse rate to be 62 on 19 June 2016. 51', 'Dr Rajesh stated that \u201ca slower heart rate (bradycardia) is also a sign of methamphetamine withdrawal\u201d, though \u201cit is not one of the essential criteria in the DSM-V\u201d. 52', '26\\u2003Dr Rajesh further stated that Saridewi had been suffering from \u201cat least moderate withdrawal\u201d based on her self-reports of excessive sleepiness, fatigue, increased appetite, psychomotor retardation and depressed mood. Her urine test also showed a high amount of amphetamine, much higher than the cut-off. 53', 'The reliability of her statements could be affected depending on the severity of withdrawal, as her cognitive processes could be affected by symptoms such as a lack of focus, poor concentration, and suggestibility. 54', '27\\u2003Dr Zakir prepared three reports providing his views on Dr Rajesh\u2019s reports. Dr Zakir did not personally examine or interview Saridewi. In preparing his reports, he relied on Dr Rajesh\u2019s medical reports, transcripts of Dr Lam\u2019s evidence at the trial in May 2018 and her medical report dated 12 April 2018, Dr Lee\u2019s medical report, transcripts of evidence by doctors who assessed Saridewi for drug withdrawal and Saridewi\u2019s investigation statements.', '28\\u2003The first report dated 15 April 2020 was prepared for the purpose of providing Dr Zakir\u2019s general views on Dr Rajesh\u2019s 2nd Report (\u201cDr Zakir\u2019s 1st Report\u201d). 55', 'Dr Zakir prepared a second report dated 25 May 2020 (\u201cDr Zakir\u2019s 2nd Report\u201d) that further considered the Toxicology Reports from the Health Sciences Authority and Saridewi\u2019s Instant Urine Test (\u201cIUT\u201d) result slip from a test done by the Central Narcotics Bureau (\u201cCNB\u201d). Dr Zakir prepared a third report dated 27 May 2021 (\u201cDr Zakir\u2019s 3rd Report\u201d) in response to the queries raised by the Court of Appeal for the purposes of the remitted hearing (at [4] above).', '29\\u2003Dr Zakir also relied on the diagnostic criteria in the DSM-V (at [19] above). 56', 'He highlighted that the most prominent signs and symptoms of methamphetamine withdrawal are disturbed sleep, depressed mood and anxiety, craving and cognitive impairment. 57', '30\\u2003At the outset, Dr Zakir noted that there were several contradictions in Saridewi\u2019s self-reports of the type, quantity and duration of methamphetamine and heroin consumption. 58', 'These details were vital in accurately diagnosing any substance use disorder, especially the substance withdrawal state. He subsequently detailed the different accounts that Saridewi had provided to various persons, highlighting that the varying accounts would result in the respective records indicating that she may have experienced different withdrawal symptoms (if any). 59', '31\\u2003However, given her history of methamphetamine use and the urine toxicology analysis that showed positive results for methamphetamine, Dr Zakir opined that it was likely that she may have suffered withdrawal symptoms after she was arrested due to abrupt cessation of methamphetamine use. 60', '32\\u2003Dr Zakir stated that generally, the severity of Saridewi\u2019s withdrawal symptoms could vary from mild to severe, 61', 'though he was unable to comment on the exact degree of severity of Saridewi\u2019s withdrawal symptoms. 62', 'He noted that Saridewi\u2019s level of alertness, distress, orientation and cognition at the point a particular statement was recorded could impede her ability to give accurate information. 63', 'However, Saridewi had not reported any major withdrawal symptoms nor exhibited any significant distress or impairment that would greatly impact her ability to give a coherent testimonial during the statement-taking period. 64', 'Most clinicians are capable of noticing moderate to severe withdrawal symptoms and in most cases of amphetamine use disorder, the withdrawal symptoms tend to be short, mild and self-limiting. 65', '33\\u2003Dr Zakir observed that Saridewi had the opportunity to report any withdrawal symptoms she had experienced during the initial period at Changi Medical Complex, but had failed to do so. This suggested that her symptoms had been neither prominent nor subjectively bothersome to her. 66', 'He stated that experienced clinicians are usually able to provide a reasonably accurate and consistent judgment as to the level of discomfort experienced by patients in methamphetamine withdrawal or in substance withdrawal (in general). 67', 'Since there were clear discrepancies in her description of the types, timeline and the quantity of the substances used, it was difficult to accurately diagnose her substance use disorder or substance use withdrawal.', '34\\u2003During the remitted hearing, six doctors and four nurses who had observed Saridewi at the contemporaneous time testified on their observations and findings they had regarding Saridewi\u2019s alleged methamphetamine withdrawal during the relevant period. The four nurses were called as defence witnesses while the doctors were called by the Prosecution. I will summarise the main aspects of their evidence below.', '35\\u2003Notably, three of the doctors, Dr Tan Chong Hun (\u201cDr Tan\u201d), Dr Edwin Lymen Vethamony (\u201cDr Vethamony\u201d) and Dr Rachel Chan (\u201cDr Chan\u201d) used the structured drug withdrawal assessment form issued by the SPS to assess Saridewi for drug withdrawal symptoms discussed at [18] above. 68', '36\\u2003Dr Tan examined Saridewi on 18 June 2016 at CWP. At the material time, Dr Tan was a Medical Officer attached to the Complex Medical Centre of the SPS. The clinical examination that he conducted at the material time included an assessment regarding whether Saridewi was experiencing withdrawal symptoms associated with the use of methamphetamine. 69', '37\\u2003At the remitted hearing, Dr Tan testified that he had looked out for withdrawal symptoms but conceded that it was possible that he may have missed symptoms that had not been specifically presented by the patient. 70', 'He testified that Saridewi had been coherent in answering questions and had not been so drowsy that she was unable to respond to his questions. 71', 'He further stated that Saridewi had not exhibited any suicidal tendencies and that she had not appeared teary or sad. 72', '38\\u2003Dr Vethamony conducted a clinical examination of Saridewi on 19 June 2016 at CWP. At the material time, Dr Vethamony was a Medical Officer attached to the Complex Medical Centre of the SPS. 73', 'The examination that he conducted at the material time included an assessment of whether Saridewi was experiencing withdrawal symptoms associated with the use of methamphetamine. 74', 'Dr Vethamony testified that if a doctor were to solely rely on the structured drug withdrawal assessment form, which is a form to facilitate notetaking for doctors when they attend to patients in the police lock-up, 75', 'mild to moderate methamphetamine withdrawal could be missed. 76', '39\\u2003Dr Vethamony further stated that he did not specifically ask Saridewi about hypersomnia, but this should have been monitored by the prison, which has a CCTV system. 77', 'He also did not observe any \u201cflat [a]ffect\u201d, which is sometimes presented by patients who are depressed. 78', 'Saridewi did not report any increased appetite to Dr Vethamony, and he did not ask about it. 79', 'During his examination of Saridewi, he also did not observe any restlessness or psychomotor retardation, but had in fact observed that she was quite alert. 80', '40\\u2003Dr Chan examined Saridewi on 20 June 2016 at CWP.

To illustrate this, Saridewi points out that Dr Zakir was selective in his reliance on scientific research and that he deleted words from the clinical conclusions in the articles he referred to in order to suit the Prosecution\u2019s case. Dr Zakir admitted that paragraph 5.2 of his 1st Report had been adapted from a specific paragraph referenced in Catherine McGregor et al, \u201cThe nature, time course and severity of methamphetamine withdrawal\u201d, Addiction (2005). 117', 'The words used in his report were reproduced from the said article, but Dr Zakir had selectively removed certain words, such as omitting to say that the subacute phase of methamphetamine withdrawal lasts \u201cat least\u201d two weeks, 118', 'thus giving an opinion in his report at odds with the medical conclusions of the referenced material. 119', '58\\u2003Saridewi submits that both experts agree on the symptoms of methamphetamine withdrawal, in that they refer to the same DSM-V criteria (at [19] above). 120', 'Saridewi further argues that both experts\u2019 views are not different. After Dr Zakir had sight of Saridewi\u2019s toxicology drug screen results, he confirmed that Saridewi may have \u201csuffered withdrawal symptoms from Methamphetamine after she was arrested on 17th June 2016, due to abrupt cessation of the use\u201d (at [31] above). 121', 'Dr Rajesh is of the same opinion, since he opined in his 3rd Report that Saridewi had been suffering from amphetamine withdrawal between 18 and 24 June 2016 (at [24] above). 122', '59\\u2003As to the extent of her condition, Saridewi relies on the AWQ administered by Dr Rajesh that suggests that she had been suffering from at least moderate withdrawal at the material time. 123', 'According to Dr Rajesh, the greater the severity of the withdrawal, the more one\u2019s cognitive processes can be affected. 124', 'Saridewi submits that symptoms that would have impeded her ability to give a reliable statement include her depressed mood and fatigue as her body was in \u201cshut down mode\u201d during the relevant period. 125', '60\\u2003Saridewi\u2019s symptoms during the relevant time could have been missed by the physicians who examined her as the structured drug withdrawal assessment form used by the SPS is not designed to capture symptoms and signs of methamphetamine withdrawal, but more those of opioid withdrawal, which entails a different set of symptoms and signs. 126', 'As the physicians used the template drug assessment form deployed at CWP, the relevant questions indicating the symptoms of methamphetamine withdrawal would not be asked of persons in remand such as Saridewi. 127', 'Furthermore, as suggested by Dr Rajesh, it is not reasonable to expect general practitioners to know of or be aware of all methamphetamine withdrawal symptoms. 128', 'Accordingly, if Saridewi did not volunteer her symptoms, it would be unlikely for the physicians to identify them. 129', 'This is further supported by the cross-examination of the doctors who examined Saridewi at CWP from 18 to 24 June 2016 \u2013 Dr Wong, Dr Vethamony and Dr Tan in particular stated that they could have missed mild symptoms of methamphetamine withdrawal. 130', '61\\u2003Lastly, Saridewi points out that she was labouring under the impression that she could be offered bail in spite of her capital charge. 131', 'As she testified during the remitted hearing, one of her motivations when giving her statements to Dr Lee had been to present a good impression to him in the hope that she could obtain bail. 132', 'As such, she did not mention that she was suffering from methamphetamine withdrawal and downplayed her \u201cice\u201d consumption, when in reality, she had been consuming up to 5 grams of \u201cice\u201d a day. 133', '62\\u2003The Prosecution submits that the totality of the evidence shows that Saridewi\u2019s statements are reliable. 134', 'First, the Prosecution submits that Saridewi\u2019s statements reflect her mental clarity at the time. Saridewi herself made several admissions that establish that she was lucid during her statement-recording. 135', 'She admitted that she had consciously and deliberately lied in her statements, which reflects goal-directed thinking. An individual undergoing withdrawal would not be able to lie continuously during the period of withdrawal. 136', 'Furthermore, she was able to recollect the events leading up to her arrest, providing details such as her feelings and actions of disposing the drugs, which show her alertness and active engagement during the course of her statement-recording. 137', 'The statements also disclosed information that only she knew about, such as the fact that she did not have a regular source of income. 138', 'Saridewi herself also accepted that all the information was uniquely within her knowledge. 139', '63\\u2003The Prosecution further submits that Saridewi was not suffering from any methamphetamine withdrawal at the relevant time. Saridewi admitted to Dr Lee that she had not suffered from drug withdrawal during her statement-taking. Across the two statements recorded on 23 June 2016, Saridewi also made positive assertions that she was \u201cfeeling fine and\u2026can give [her] statement\u201d [emphasis added]. 140', 'She also did not ask to postpone her statement-recording over the three-day period of 21 to 23 June 2016. 141', 'Even if Saridewi was suffering from methamphetamine withdrawal, her symptoms based on her claims were mild to moderate and they did not affect the reliability of her statements. 142', '64\\u2003The Prosecution urges the court to reject Dr Rajesh\u2019s evidence and opinion. To substantiate this, the Prosecution submits that Dr Rajesh relied heavily, if not solely on Saridewi\u2019s self-reports in formulating his opinion and that he accepted that these self-reports constituted a major part of his opinion. 143', 'The symptoms that Saridewi had self-reported to Dr Rajesh are inconsistent with her position during the 2018 trial \u2013 while she reported to Dr Rajesh that she had experienced symptoms of an increase in appetite and psychomotor retardation, this was not raised during the 2018 trial. 144', 'Dr Rajesh\u2019s assessment also arises from the results of the AWQ, which was administered four years after the event and was therefore not validly administered. 145', 'Dr Rajesh had also failed to set out Saridewi\u2019s account of the statement-taking process. 146', 'His reports fail to consider Saridewi\u2019s lies, her recollection of specific events, her ability to study photographs and identify exhibits, as well as to furnish details and to understand the contents of her statements. 147', '65\\u2003The Prosecution also submits that it is implausible that Saridewi\u2019s symptoms would have gone unnoticed by all her doctors and nurses given their experience and familiarity with withdrawal symptoms. 148', 'Dr Rajesh himself conceded that doctors who were aware of methamphetamine withdrawal symptoms and who worked regularly with such patients should be able to pick up on withdrawal symptoms. 149'"}

The jib had not been rigged according to the manufacturer\u2019s configuration. Unfortunately, the worker passed away as a result of his injuries.', '5\\u2003Consequently, the respondent, which was the employer of the deceased, was charged with, pleaded guilty to, and was convicted of a charge under s 12(1) read with s 20 of the Act:', '6\\u2003Sections 12(1) and 20 of the Act provide as follows:', '7\\u2003In his grounds of decision on sentence (the \u201cGD\u201d), the District Judge (the \u201cDJ\u201d) applied the sentencing frameworks set out in GS Engineering and MW Group in relation to offences under s 12(1) read with s 20 of the Act. Although he noted that there were divergences between the sentencing frameworks, he did not consider them to be inconsistent with one another (GD at [51]). He found that in negligently failing to implement safe work procedures and a lifting plan, the respondent\u2019s culpability was moderate (GD at [60]\u2013[73]). He also found that the potential harm inherent in the rigging of the jib was high as one other worker besides the deceased was exposed to such risk (GD at [74]\u2013[75]). Based on the applicable sentencing ranges in the frameworks for such cases of a fine between $120,000 and $300,000 (applying MW Group) or between $150,000 and $300,000 (applying GS Engineering), the DJ fixed the starting sentence at a fine of $210,000, which he took to be the midpoint of the respective sentencing ranges (GD at [77]). After balancing the aggravating factor on account of the death of the deceased against several mitigating factors such as the respondent\u2019s early plea of guilt and its otherwise unblemished safety record, the starting sentence was marginally uplifted by $10,000 to $220,000 (GD at [80]).', '8\\u2003In arriving at his decision, the DJ noted that the frameworks in GS Engineering and MW Group were likely in need of reconsideration in light of the High Court\u2019s decision in Mao Xuezhong v Public Prosecutor and another appeal [2020] 5 SLR 580 (\u201cMao Xuezhong\u201d), which related to offences under what is now 15(4) of the Act and which took a different approach in its consideration of harm and culpability (GD at [57]). Nonetheless, the DJ considered himself bound by GS Engineering and MW Group, and applied the frameworks in those cases accordingly (GD at [58]).', '9\\u2003In this appeal, the Prosecution seeks to substitute the GS Engineering and MW Group sentencing frameworks with one more akin to the framework in Mao Xuezhong. Notably, it submits that its proposed sentencing framework should be applicable not just to offences under s 12(1) of the Act, but to all Part 4 offences punishable under s 50(b) generally. Applying its proposed sentencing framework, the Prosecution argues that a heavier fine of $260,000\u2013$280,000 is appropriate.', '10\\u2003The respondent, meanwhile, submits that no departure from the GS Engineering and MW Group frameworks is warranted, despite candidly acknowledging that the principles of the Mao Xuezhong sentencing framework are applicable to offences under s 12(1) of the Act. In any event, it argues, should a new sentencing framework be formulated, the doctrine of prospective overruling should be applied, such that the new sentencing framework should not apply to the present case.', '11\\u2003To assist us in this appeal, we appointed a young amicus curiae, Ms Loh Jia Wen Dynyse (the \u201camicus\u201d).

As alluded to earlier at [ 65], Ms Yen\u2019s report was heavily criticised by \nBorneo in its closing submissions. It would be appropriate at this juncture for \nthe court to turn to the evidence that was adduced from Ms Yen in the course of \nher cross-examination that prompted Borneo\u2019s criticisms.  \n72 Under para 2 of Ms Yen\u2019s valuation, she had said:\nThe property under assessment is a parcel of land intended for \nindustrial use presently constructed with a power plant (Co-\nGen plant) and other improvements.  \n73 Ms Teh took issue with Ms Yen\u2019s reliance in her Terms of Reference \n(\u201cTOR\u201d)68 on the licence granted to PHSB in [69(d)] when Ms Yen herself \nconfirmed that as at the date of her valuation, she knew that PHSB was no longer \ngenerating electricity from the Co-Gen Plant. Questioned by Ms Teh as well as \nthe court,69 Ms Yen agreed that she should have stated in her TOR that PHSB \nno longer operated the plant.\n74 Another issue raised during her cross-examination was Ms Yen\u2019s \nreference70 to SHGCC\u2019s letter in [69(e)] stating it requested amendment of the \nlatter\u2019s letter of offer dated 29 October 2004 from SESB reserve to industrial \nland. Pressed by Ms Teh and the court, Ms Yen admitted there was no such \nrequest stated in the letter. What SHGCC wanted was stated in the following \nextracts71 from paras 3 to 5 of the letter:\n68 At item 7 of the TOR\n69 See transcripts on 23 September 2021 at p 485-486\n70 At item 8 of her TOR\n71 See 1AB2501\nVersion No 1: 08 Jul 2022 (17:09 hrs)\nBorneo Ventures Pte Ltd v \nOng Han Nam[2022] SGHC 162  \n28\u2026..The Co-Gen Plant has a different ownership and operating \nmodel as compared to the electricity sub-stations sited within \nthe Resort. It is to be privately owned and independently \noperated, and not intended to be treated in the same manner \nas the sub-stations.    \nWe have recently discovered that the Letter of Offer does not \naddress the terms of sub-division for the site of the Co-Gen \nPlant as an individual lot...\nIn view of the foregoing, we should be grateful if you could \nkindly look into the discrepancy and make the necessary \namendment to the Letter of Offer. \nThe court finds it unprofessional and misleading on her part for Ms Yen to give \nan incorrect interpretation of the above letter.\n75 At item 9 of the TOR, Ms Yen had said the Letter of Offer from LSDS \ndated 1 October 2014 at [69(f)] amended its previous accepted Letter of Offer \ndated 27 July 2007. The Letter of Offer dated 27 July 200772 was for \nsubdivision\/conversion of the Subject Land (part of the Sembulan Land) at a \npremium of RM4,000 for erection and use as an electricity substation. The \nLetter of Offer dated 1 October 2014 from LSDS requested payment from \nSGHCC of an annual rent of RM31,800 for the use of the land as Industrial Co-\nGen Plant. Since the usage of the Subject Land remained unchanged, there was \nno amendment of change of use. What did change was that the restriction on \ntransfer and sublease of the title only to SESB was removed from the 1 October \n2014 letter.73  \n76 Eventually. Ms Yen agreed that the only change between the two letters \nwas the decrease in annual rent from RM117,50074 in the July letter to \n72 At 1AB1983\n73 See transcripts on 23 September 2021 at p 500 \n74 See 1AB1986\nVersion No 1: 08 Jul 2022 (17:09 hrs)\nBorneo Ventures Pte Ltd v \nOng Han Nam[2022] SGHC 162  \n29RM31,800 in the October letter.75 She admitted that the removal of the \nrestriction on transfer to SESB was a very relevant factor but, when questioned \nby the court, she was unable to explain why that she omitted that important \nfactor from the TOR. However, she disagreed with Ms Teh\u2019s suggestion that \nshe omitted that fact so as to justify her low valuation of the Subject Land.\n77 Ms Yen testified she had conducted a search in DBKK in March 2021 \nand ascertained therefrom (verbally from the staff) that the Subject Land was \nzoned for infrastructure and utilities use. However, when she returned to DBKK \nin July 2021 and obtained a plan, she was told that the Subject Land was zoned \nfor \u201cMixed Use\u201d. \n78 Cross-examined why she did not submit to court her search results, Ms \nYen explained for her first visit to DBKK, she was given the information \nscribbled on a piece of paper. On the second occasion, she requested for a plan \nbut was not provided with one.  \n79 What made Ms Yen\u2019s testimony in regard to her alleged difficulties in \nobtaining a copy of KK Draft Plan less than credible was Ms Teh\u2019s disclosure76 \nthat Borneo and\/or its solicitors could and did, download the KK Draft Plan \nfrom the website of DBKK without difficulty. Ms Teh even provided Ms Yen \nwith the link. \n80 Ms Yen\u2019s two visits to DBKK were not mentioned in her valuation \nreport. She denied Ms Teh\u2019s suggestion that she failed to disclose the fact that \n75 See transcripts 23 September 2021 p 498 \n76 See transcripts at p 564\nVersion No 1: 08 Jul 2022 (17:09 hrs)\nBorneo Ventures Pte Ltd v \nOng Han Nam[2022] SGHC 162  \n30the DBKK had zoned the Subject Land as \u201cMixed Use\u201d to justify her valuation \nof the same as for industrial use.  \n81 Ms Yen was referred to the KK Draft Plan77 that Wong had obtained \nfrom DBKK in September 2011. The printed copy dated 30 March 2012 was \nendorsed with a stamp of City Hall78. She agreed that she could also have \nobtained the same printed plan and that it showed the Subject Land was zoned \nfor \u201cMixed Use\u201d. However, she denied she had deliberately withheld the \ndocument from the court because it would go against her valuation that the \nSubject Land was for industrial use79. The plan that Ms Yen obtained did not \nhave any stamp\/endorsement by DBKK affixed thereon. Repeated attempts by \nMs Teh and the court to obtain an explanation from her for the difference were \nfutile as what Ms Yen said made no sense80.    \n82 After she was shown that the version of the KK Draft Plan she herself \nobtained from DBKK81 showed the Subject Land had been re-zoned for \u201cMixed \nUse\u201d, Ms Yen agreed82. Further, when Ms Teh pointed out to Ms Yen that the \nSubject Land\u2019s zoning was different from that of the Sembulan Land which was \nfor hotel and resort, Ms Yen agreed. Despite such concession however, Ms Yen \ndenied that it was incorrect for her to state in her valuation report that the \nintended use of the Subject Land was \u201cIndustrial Use (Co-Gen Plant)\u201d. She also \nwould not agree that the owner of the Subject Land can submit a development \n77 See [23] supra\n78 See PSB149\n79 See transcripts on 23 September 2021 at p 536 \n80 Ibid pg 538-539 \n81 At PSB147-148\n82 See transcripts at p 546. \nVersion No 1: 08 Jul 2022 (17:09 hrs)\nBorneo Ventures Pte Ltd v \nOng Han Nam[2022] SGHC 162  \n31plan for the Subject Land on the basis of \u201cMixed Use\u201d and there would be a \nhigh chance it would be approved by the LSDS.83 \n83 However, Ms Yen conceded that if the owner of the Subject Land is \nwilling to pay a higher premium to the LSDS, it would not be difficult to have \nthe Subject Land converted from industrial use to \u201cMixed Use\u201d84. Despite this \nconcession however, Ms Yen disagreed such conversion would be reasonably \nattainable in December 2013 or March 2014. She opined that LSDS may not \napprove the conversion because at that time, the licence to supply electricity \nfrom the Co-Gen Plant was still valid until 2015. \n84 Ms Yen\u2019s answer conveniently overlooked the fact that the licence in \nfavour of OBSB was an unprofitable venture for OBSB who hardly used the \nlicence as, since October 2013, SH Resort had obtained its electricity supply \nfrom SESB.85Who else would OBSB supply electricity to? By 30 December \n2013 and more so by 26 March 2014, the Co-Gen Plant was at least dormant if \nnor defunct.  Yet Ms Yen failed to take this material factor into account raising \nserious questions on the accuracy of her valuation and report.  \n85 Ms Yen did concede that if the Subject Land is zoned for \u201cMixed Use\u201d, \nit would be worth substantially more than her valuation of RM3.4m.   \n86 The court now turns to the three comparable transactions used in Ms \nYen\u2019s valuation report (referred to as Ms Yen\u2019s Comparables No 1\u20133). Based \n83 Ibid p 550\n84 Ibid p 551\n85 See [48] supra\nVersion No 1: 08 Jul 2022 (17:09 hrs)\nBorneo Ventures Pte Ltd v \nOng Han Nam[2022] SGHC 162  \n32on those transactions, Ms Yen arrived at a valuation for the Subject Land at \nRM54 per sq ft.\n87 Ms Yen\u2019s Comparables No 1 and 3) were located in the north region of \nKota Kinabalu in Inanam while her Comparable No 2 is in the Kolombong area. \nAll are in remote areas whereas the Subject Land is at the fringe of the city \ncentre. When the court told Ms Yen she was not comparing like with like, she \ndisagreed.86 Cross-examined why she did not select comparables that were \nnearer to the city centre, Ms Yen said there were none. It should be noted that \nMs Yen withdrew her Comparable No 3 during cross-examination on the \nground it was inappropriate, that being agricultural land87.  \n88 When Ms Yen was taken to task for using her Comparable No 1, as its \nland title has no specific use stated and it would thereby by default under the \nSabah Land Ordinance be used for agricultural purposes, Ms Yen agreed. She \nhad arrived at a price per sq ft for her Comparable No 1 of RM73 based on the \ntransacted price of RM11,885,422 and land area of 162,814 sq ft.\n89 During cross-examination, it was revealed that a conversion premium \nhad to be paid to convert the land in Ms Yen\u2019s Comparable No 1 to general \nindustrial land. Based on a conversion formula88 of 10% x 70% of vacant \nindustrial land value, Ms Teh came to a figure of RM831,979 as the premium \npayable which Ms Yen failed to take into account in her valuation. \n86 See transcripts on 23 September 2021 at p 570\n87 Ibid at p 576\n88 Shown at 2SAB2208\nVersion No 1: 08 Jul 2022 (17:09 hrs)\nBorneo Ventures Pte Ltd v \nOng Han Nam[2022] SGHC 162  \n3390 Ms Yen was further informed that the owner of her Comparable No 1 \n(Harmony Broadway Sdn Bhd) had purchased the land with an approved \ndevelopment plan. Indeed, she herself had requested leave from court to correct \nher classification of the land from \u201cvacant land\u201d to \u201cdevelopment land\u201d. \nCommon sense dictates that land slated for development would be more \nvaluable than vacant land (to which Ms Yen agreed)89.  \n91 Ms Teh also pointed out to Ms Yen that her Comparable No 1: \n(a) has a proposed local distributor road running through its centre \nand there would be two road reserves one of which would occupy 13,345 \nsq ft; \n(b) has a drainage reserve which would take up 4,279 sq ft;  \n(c) is required by law to keep 10% of the development land vacant \nfor open space; and\n(d) is required to keep another 10% of the development land vacant \nfor a detention pond for flood mitigation purposes.\nThe acreage calculations in (a) and (b) were done by Wong. Taking all the non-\nusable factors in (a) to (d) into account (which Ms Yen did not), Ms Teh put it \nto Ms Yen that the area available for actual development in her Comparable No \n1 would only approximate 55% of the 162,814 sq ft stated in its land title. That \nbeing the case, the price transacted would be RM133 per sq ft instead of Ms \n89 See transcripts on 23 September 2021 at p 591 \nVersion No 1: 08 Jul 2022 (17:09 hrs)\nBorneo Ventures Pte Ltd v \nOng Han Nam[2022] SGHC 162  \n34Yen\u2019s figure of RM73 per sf ft, amounting to a gross undervalue of RM60 per \nsq ft. Surprisingly, Ms Yen disagreed with Ms Teh.90  \n92 Moreover, Ms Yen\u2019s Comparable No 1 comprises of hilly or undulating \nterrain, according to Borneo\u2019s search result using Google Maps.91 Ms Yen, who \nvisited the site, claimed she saw flat land. If the terrain is not flat land, costs \nwould have to be incurred to carry out hill cutting to level the land.  It was also \nlocated 200m away from a cemetery based on a search done by Google Maps.92 \nYet, Ms Yen would not agree that these two negative factors meant she should \nnot use her Comparable No 1 as a benchmark to value the Subject Land. She \nconfirmed she did not take into account the two negative factors in the value of \nher Comparable No 1 and make the necessary adjustments. \n93 The court moves next to consider Ms Yen\u2019s Comparable No 2 in Ms \nYen\u2019s valuation report. She used that transaction as it was zoned for general \nindustrial use. However, that was an error as under the KK Draft Plan;93 that plot \nof land was zoned for government use. It was also not located in the north region \nas she had stated in her valuation report but near a cemetery and funeral parlour94 \nboth of which were omitted from her report. She did not make adjustments for \nthose two negative factors nor for the fact that the land in question had no direct \naccess to a nearby main road called Jalan Lintas. Indeed, not only did Ms Yen \nnot make a downward adjustment to her valuation due to the three negative \n90 See transcripts on 23 September at p 604 \n91 See photograph at PSB296\n92 See PSB182A\n93 See PSB188\n94 See map at PSB185A\nVersion No 1: 08 Jul 2022 (17:09 hrs)\nBorneo Ventures Pte Ltd v \nOng Han Nam[2022] SGHC 162  \n35factors in [ 91], in her table at para 15.0 of her valuation report, she added 10% \nto her valuation as a plus factor. This is wholly erroneous.\n94 Under the special terms of the lease95 for Ms Yen\u2019s Comparable No 2, \nthe purpose was restricted to industry, whilst subleasing was prohibited and the \nowner had covenanted to complete construction of a building thereon before \nJanuary 2007. As the covenant was not fulfilled (as at 28 March 2013), the land \nregistry title96 showed that the government imposed on the land an additional \npremium and increased the annual rent payable. In return for the additional \npremium and increased annual rent, the covenant to build was first extended to \n2019 and then further extended to 2022.97  Ms Yen failed to take these factors \ninto account in her analysis of her Comparable No 2.\n95 During her further cross-examination,98 Ms Yen was informed that the \nvacant land in her Comparable No 2 had still not been developed since it was \ntransacted on 28 March 2013. She was told (to which she disagreed) that it was \nbecause the owner could not get his development plan approved as the permitted \nuse of the land under the current zoning is for government use.\n96 I turn next to Ms Yen\u2019s testimony on her Comparable No 3.

Ms Yen did not take this into \naccount in her use of her Comparable No. 3. It did not assist Ms Yen that she \nmade another mistake: Ms Yen\u2019s Comparable No 3 is in fact zoned for \ncommercial group centre according to Borneo\u2019s search102 (which Ms Yen \nconceded) and not for industrial use.  She further made an unjustified downward \nadjustment by 10% in her table103 for the Subject Land for the reason its title \nwas not yet issued.104 \n98 In relation to the lease for Ms Yen\u2019s Comparable No. 3, in Ms Yen\u2019s \nsupplementary AEIC105 it was shown that the lease for 99 years commenced on \n17 September 1970, which meant that the lease would expire in 2069. As at \nMarch 2014, the lease had a balance tenure of 55 years. In her table, Ms Yen \nfailed to take that into account and stated that the land had a 99 years\u2019 lease \nwhile at the same time understating the lease of the Subject Land by 6 years for \nwhich she gave a 10% discount.  \n99 See p 25 of Ms Yen\u2019s supplementary AEIC\n100 See transcripts on 24 September 2021 at p 633\n101 See SAB2207\n102 At PSB193\n103 At p 26 of her valuation report \n104 See transcripts on 24 September 2021 at p 637\n105 At p 24 \nVersion No 1: 08 Jul 2022 (17:09 hrs)\nBorneo Ventures Pte Ltd v \nOng Han Nam[2022] SGHC 162  \n3799 Despite being aware that the Subject Land was zoned for \u201cMixed Use\u201d, \nMs Yen failed to take that factor into account in her choice of using for \ncomparison transactions that involved industrial use land. She said it was \nbecause she relied on the letter to SHGCC from LSDS dated 1 October 2014 at \n[69(f)] above. Both counsel and the court pointed out to Ms Yen (who \ndisagreed) that LSDS is in charge of change of use, not zoning. There was no \nrational basis for her to rely on a letter which did not deal with zoning but \nreduced the quantum of annual rent in its original offer letter dated 27 July 2007 \nlisted at [69(b)].  \n100 Borneo had taken, via Google Street View, a photograph of the road \nleading to the entrance to Ms Yen\u2019s Comparable No 3 in October 2014106. It \nshowed a ticketing booth at the entrance and on the court\u2019s inquiry, Ms Teh \nconfirmed it was the side extension of a bus station\/terminal. That meant access \nwas restricted and would be a negative factor in its value which again, was not \ntaken into account in Ms Yen\u2019s valuation. However, she conceded that her \nComparable No 3 was not a reliable comparison as it had been acquired by and \nsurrendered to the government in August 2011107 for the extension and \nconstruction of a bus terminal.\n101 It was noted that the gazette notifications for the acquisition108 were \ndated 3 and 10 September 2009.  Ms Yen\u2019s Comparable No 3 was transacted on \n30 March 2009 and sold to Inai Rampai Sdn Bhd. Ms Yen disagreed with Ms \nTeh\u2019s suggestion that it was likely the said purchaser would have known of the \n106 See PSB192.\n107 See transcripts on 23 September 2021 at p 646 and PSB200\n108 At PSB203\nVersion No 1: 08 Jul 2022 (17:09 hrs)\nBorneo Ventures Pte Ltd v \nOng Han Nam[2022] SGHC 162  \n38impending acquisition at the time of its purchase and not paid a full but \ndiscounted price for the land.109 Apparently, she did not take the acquisition \nfactor into consideration.    \n102 During cross-examination,110 Ms Yen explained she wanted her \nComparable No 3 to be deleted not because of its impending acquisition but \nbecause it was zoned as agricultural land. Ms Teh pointed out her Comparable \nNo 2 was also wrongly zoned as industrial land when it should be for \ngovernment use and yet Ms Yen did not ask for its deletion. Ms Yen sought to \nexplain that, in relation to the fact that the title for her Comparable No 2 was \nindustrial use even though it was zoned for government use, she had wanted to \nchange the title but the court disallowed her request (because she was prompted \nto do so after having sight of the PSB111).  \n103 Ms Yen was shown graphs112 from the Malaysian National Property \nInformation Centre Annual Property Report 2014, which showed a 50% \nincrease in prices for industrial properties from 2009 to 2014.  She had only \nmade a 21% adjustment for the same time lapse in her Comparable No 3 which \nMs Teh described as \u201cgrossly inadequate\u201d;113 Ms Yen disagreed.  \n104 Contrary to her denial,114 the court accepts as valid Borneo\u2019s surmise that \nMs Yen deliberately failed to take into factors that would have allowed for a \n109 See transcripts on 23 September 2021 at p 648\n110 Ibid p 649\n111 See transcripts on 23 September 2021 at pg 576\n112 At PSB180\n113 See transcripts on 23 September 2021 at p 653 \n114 See transcripts on 24 September 2021 at p 661-662\nVersion No 1: 08 Jul 2022 (17:09 hrs)\nBorneo Ventures Pte Ltd v \nOng Han Nam[2022] SGHC 162  \n39greater upward adjustment on a per sq ft basis of her three comparables because \nshe wanted a good outcome for Ong. Had she done so, her values would have \nbeen significantly higher for land for industrial use. In addition, her comparables \nwere not the correct ones to be used because the Subject Land is not zoned for \nindustrial use under the KK Draft Plan but for \u201cMixed Use\u201d. \n105 On the other hand, Wong\u2019s comparables for industrial use land (termed \n\u201cWong\u2019s industrial Comparables No 1 to 3\u201d) were far more appropriate, if \nindeed the Subject Land was to be compared to industrial use land. The \nlocations of Wong\u2019s industrial Comparables were shown in maps and \nphotographs in PSB 210, 212, 222 to 256. Wong\u2019s industrial Comparables were \ncomparing with like with like in terms of zoning, accessibility (being close to \ndual carriageway in the case of Wong\u2019s industrial Comparable No 1). Yet Ms \nYen did not use any of them in her valuation report.\n106 Cross-examination of Ms Yen on Wong\u2019s industrial Comparables No 1 \nto 3 did not improve Ms Yen\u2019s credibility with the court. Her repeated reaction \nwas to disagree with Ms Teh even when the latter\u2019s questions called for other \nanswers and\/or explanations.\nThe submissions\n(i) Borneo\u2019s submissions \n107 Borneo was critical of Ong\u2019s testimony115 as it was of Ms Yen\u2019s. The \ncourt considers Borneo\u2019s criticisms as justified in the light of the court\u2019s own \ndim view of his evidence (see [ 130]). \n115 Ibid paras 11-18, 48- 61. \nVersion No 1: 08 Jul 2022 (17:09 hrs)\nBorneo Ventures Pte Ltd v \nOng Han Nam[2022] SGHC 162  \n40108 As alluded to earlier at [ 63], Borneo was highly critical of Ms Yen\u2019s \nvaluation\/testimony. Indeed, Borneo submitted116that her valuation report \nshould not be relied upon. Some of Borneo\u2019s lengthy criticisms of her \nevidence117 mirrored the court\u2019s own observations of Ms Yen\u2019s testimony as set \nout earlier at [73] to [106] and need not be repeated. \n109 In summary, Borneo submitted118 that Ms Yen\u2019s valuation report cannot \nbe relied upon for the following reasons:\n(a) she failed to take into consideration the nature and characteristics \nof the Subject Land;\n(b) she took no care to ensure the accuracy of the information in her \nvaluation report;\n(c) she did not use suitable or appropriate comparables and did not \nmake appropriate adjustments for her comparables;\n(d) she deliberately chose not to highlight the deficiencies of her \ncomparables in her valuation report;\n(e) she was not consistent in the manner she treated her \ncomparables; and\n(f) she failed to use comparables which are more appropriate. \n116 See paras 129-204 of Borneo\u2019s closing submissions \n117 Ibid paras 31, 62- 105, 129-204.\n118 Ibid at para 129\nVersion No 1: 08 Jul 2022 (17:09 hrs)\nBorneo Ventures Pte Ltd v \nOng Han Nam[2022] SGHC 162  \n41110 Borneo submitted that the court should instead accept Wong\u2019s evidence \nand valuation report. Hence, the Subject Land ought to be valued on the basis \nof \u201cMixed Use\u201d and the same was in all probability zoned as \u201cMixed Use\u201d as at \n26 March 2014 based on Wong\u2019s valuation and circumstantial evidence (citing \nChua Kok Tee David v DBS Bank Ltd [2015] 5 SLR 231).119 \n111 Borneo urged the court to accept that the fair market value of the Subject \nLand should be fixed at Wong\u2019s valuation of RM35m arguing that Ong\u2019s \nattempts via his counsel to find flaws in Wong\u2019s valuation had no merit.120  \nBorneo submitted that Wong\u2019s valuation was well supported by logic and \nevidence.   \n112 In regard to Ms Yen\u2019s shortcomings listed at [ 109] above, Borneo made \ncopious reference in its submissions to the transcripts121 to buttress their \ncriticisms of her testimony. \n113 Borneo further submitted122 that there was no bar to using as \ncomparables transactions that took place after 26 March 2014.  The 2011 MVS \napplicable to this case did not contain any prescribed standards as to the \ntransaction dates of comparables that can be used by a valuer in his valuation, \naccording to Wong\u2019s testimony.123 Wong was mindful that the 2011 MVS \napplied but where he could find no guidance therefrom, he would look at other \nguidance (which in this case was in the 6th edition).\n119 See Borneo\u2019s closing submissions paras 23-48 \n120 Ibid paras 106 -107. \n121 Ibid paras 132 - 204\n122 Ibid paras 108 -117\n123 At transcripts on 21 September 2021 at p 251-252 \nVersion No 1: 08 Jul 2022 (17:09 hrs)\nBorneo Ventures Pte Ltd v \nOng Han Nam[2022] SGHC 162  \n42114 Borneo submitted it was irrelevant that no separate title was issued for \nthe Subject Land124 pointing out that Ms Yen\u2019s valuation did not take that factor \ninto account. The same submission was made for the fact that there was no \ndevelopment plan for \u201cMixed Use\u201d.125\n115 Even if \u201cIndustrial Use\u201d is determined to be the correct basis for valuing \nthe Subject Land, Borneo submitted that Ms Yen\u2019s valuation cannot be relied \nupon126 due to the factors listed at [109] above.\n116 Borneo also argued that the previous valuation reports of the Sembulan \nLand that Ong referred to should not be relied upon either. Borneo pointed out \nthat none of the following four valuation reports were commissioned for the \npurpose of ascertaining the fair market value of the Subject Land as at 26 March \n2014:\n(a) The valuation report of SHGCC dated 24 April 2013 of CH \nWilliams Talhar & Wong (\u201cCH William\u2019s valuation\u201d);\n(b) Azmi\u2019s 2014 report;\n(c) Azmi\u2019s 2016 report; and\n(d) the Taylor Hobbs\u2019 valuation dated 27 April 2017.127\nAs such, these reports should be disregarded.\n124 See Borneo\u2019s closing submissions at paras 118 \u2013 120 \n125 Ibid paras 121 -125\n126 Ibid paras 129 -204.\n127 See [15] supra\nVersion No 1: 08 Jul 2022 (17:09 hrs)\nBorneo Ventures Pte Ltd v \nOng Han Nam[2022] SGHC 162  \n43117 Earlier at [ 62], the court had already expressed the view that Azmi\u2019s two \nreports are irrelevant. Hence, the court accepts Borneo\u2019s submission in [116 (b) \nand (c)].  \n118 As regards CH William\u2019s valuation, Borneo128 pointed out that it \nspecifically excluded the Subject Land and was commissioned to value the \nSembulan Land. As for Taylor Hobbs\u2019 valuation, it was prepared for the purpose \nof and adduced in, the Malaysian proceedings to determine whether the dispute \nfell within the monetary limits of the Malaysian High Court.  \n(ii) Ong\u2019s submissions \n119  Ong argued that GSH\/Borneo negotiated and purchased the assets of \nSH on an \u201cas is where is\u201d basis which meant that the highest and best use of the \nSubject Land under the MVS129 as at 26 March 2014 was that of \u201cindustrial co-\ngen plant\u201d, its legally permissible use at the material time. Ong alleged that \nBorneo\u2019s request to assess damages based on the development potential of the \nSubject Land as \u201cMixed Use\u201d was an afterthought which was contradicted by \nthe objective facts.\n120 Wong\u2019s testimony was alleged to be biased and not independent. It was \nsaid130 that Wong\u2019s valuation report was unreliable, unfair and partial to the \ninterests of GSH. Wong was accused of biasness because he conducts valuations \n(which he listed in his curriculum vitae) for GSH and\/or its related companies \non a yearly basis for five developments (including three hotels). \n128 At paras 207-209\n129 See [27] supra\n130 See paras 310  of Ong\u2019s closing submissions \nVersion No 1: 08 Jul 2022 (17:09 hrs)\nBorneo Ventures Pte Ltd v \nOng Han Nam[2022] SGHC 162  \n44121 Wong\u2019s valuation was criticised as being based on \u201cMixed Use\u201d of the \nSubject Land when it was zoned for industrial use. He did so on the instructions \nof Borneo. Wong\u2019s valuation was also said to be premised on numerous \nunfounded assumptions. It was said that Borneo had no proof that the Subject \nLand was zoned as \u201cMixed Use\u201d as of 26 March 2014.131 It was a leap of logic \non Borneo\u2019s part to rely on the KK Draft Plan. The 2011 version of the KK \nDraft Plan indicated that the Subject Land was zoned (in blue) under public \nutilities, for drainage, water bodies etc, but it was not zoned for \u201cMixed Use\u201d. \nThere was no evidence that SHGCC or Ong had applied to the KK City Hall for \na change in zoning of the Subject Land to \u201cMixed Use\u201d at the material time.   \n122 It was submitted132 that Wong\u2019s industrial Comparables valuing the \nSubject Land on Industrial Use basis were unsuitable and inapplicable due to \nthe following (non-exhaustive) factors: \n(a) Wong\u2019s Comparables had their own individual titles;\n(b) the transactions should not be considered as they took place after \n26 March 2014;\n(c) Wong\u2019s Comparable No 4 is located in the Penumpang district \nwhereas the Subject Land is located in the KK district;\n(d) Wong\u2019s Comparable No 3 was wrongly zoned as \u201cGeneral \nIndustry\u201d when it should be \u201cCommercial Mixed Use\u201d and Wong had \nconceded he needed to make a downward adjustment in value;\n131 Ibid at paras 189 - 203 \n132 Ibid at Section B para 258\nVersion No 1: 08 Jul 2022 (17:09 hrs)\nBorneo Ventures Pte Ltd v \nOng Han Nam[2022] SGHC 162  \n45(e) Wong erred in giving a 50% uplift to his comparables \u2013 he \nshould have made a downward adjustment. This was due to the position \ntaken by Wong that the Subject Land was not suitable for use as \n\u201cIndustrial (Co-Gen Plant)\u201d given its location near the city centre. That \nbeing the case, the Subject Land would be in an inferior position \ncompared to Wong\u2019s comparables;\n123 Additionally, Wong was said to be mistaken in his assumption that the \nCo-Gen Plant was defunct133 as well as in his baseless assumption that \ndevelopment plan approval for \u201cMixed Use\u201d for the Subject Land would be \nreadily forthcoming.134 \n124 Ong submitted that the lack of a separate title would have been a \nsignificant factor that would have reduced the fair market value of the Subject \nLand. Wong was also criticised for failing to take into account that a conversion \npremium was payable to change the zoning of the Subject Land to \u201cMixed Use\u201d \nif it was assumed to be zoned tourism due to being part of the Sembulan Land\u2019s \ntitle. Wong had also overlooked demolition costs for the Co-Gen Plant sitting \non the Subject Land.  \n125 Ong left no stone unturned in his closing submissions. He urged the \ncourt not to admit Borneo\u2019s documents found in the Plaintiff\u2019s Supplemental \nBundle of Documents (\u201cPSB\u201d) as their authenticity had not been proven. Since \nthey were not part of the agreed documents, Borneo must satisfy ss 66 and 67 \nof the Evidence Act 1893 (\u201cthe EA\u201d) before those documents can be considered \n133 See Ong\u2019s closing submissions at paras 320 - 325\n134 Ibid para 326.\nVersion No 1: 08 Jul 2022 (17:09 hrs)\nBorneo Ventures Pte Ltd v \nOng Han Nam[2022] SGHC 162  \n46as part of the evidence before the court (citing Jet Holdings Ltd and Others v \nCooper Cameron (Singapore) Pte Ltd [2005] 4 SLR(R) 417). As the PSB \ndocuments were not formally proven, Ong urged the court to exclude them \npursuant to the inherent powers of the court under O 92 r 4 of the Rules of Court \n(Cap 322 r 5) (\u201cthe Rules\u201d) and s 47(4) of the EA. \n126 By the same token, Ong submitted the court should exclude Wong\u2019s \nrebuttal report that formed part of the PSB135 as no leave was sought or granted \nfor Borneo to file or adduce additional expert report to rebut Ms Yen\u2019s report, \nand Ong would be wholly prejudiced if the same was allowed into evidence.  \n127 In short, Ong submitted that Wong\u2019s valuation report should be rejected \nin its entirety. On the other hand, Ong urged the court to accept Ms Yen\u2019s \nvaluation report and testimony for the following (non-exhaustive) reasons:\n(a) she had only factored relevant considerations in her valuation;136 \nand\n(b) Ms Yen\u2019s comparables were appropriate and suitable to derive \nthe fair market value of the Subject Land.137\nNothing was said in Ong\u2019s submissions on the shortcomings in Ms Yen\u2019s \nvaluation including those in the three comparables she used, or how her \ncredibility was undermined in the course of her cross-examination. These \n135 At PSB209  \n136 See Ong\u2019s closing submissions at Section B at para 204 onwards\n137 Ibid at Section C para 245 onwards\nVersion No 1: 08 Jul 2022 (17:09 hrs)\nBorneo Ventures Pte Ltd v \nOng Han Nam[2022] SGHC 162  \n47factors were addressed at length in Borneo\u2019s closing submissions and also noted \nby the court earlier at [73] to [104] above. \n128 Ong concluded his closing submissions with a request to the court to \naccept Ms Yen\u2019s valuation and that damages be assessed at 77.5% (that being \nBorneo\u2019s interest) of RM3.4m or RM2,635,000.  \n129 Both parties filed Reply submissions to counter\/rebut the other side\u2019s \nclosing submissions. \n130 Borneo pointed out in its Reply submissions138 in response to Ong\u2019s \nobjections at [125] to [126], that the documents pertaining to Ms Yen\u2019s \ncomparables were to give her advance notice of what she could expect to be \nasked in cross-examination. It is an undisputed fact that Ms Yen withdrew her \nComparable No 3 after she had had sight of the documents in PSB.    \n131 Boneo pointed out that some documents such as PSB 268-295 originated \nfrom Ong\u2019s documents in the defendant\u2019s bundle of documents.139 They were \nWong\u2019s version of Ong\u2019s slides.   \n132 In any case, as Borneo pointed out in its Reply submissions,140 Mr Lem \nhad indicated141 on the first day of trial that the documents in the PSB were \nlargely agreed save for Wong\u2019s rebuttal report. For that reason, the court marked \nthe entire bundle for convenience as Borneo\u2019s\/the plaintiff\u2019s documents instead \n138 At paras 228-242\n139 DBD 27-56\n140 See para 225-226\n141 See transcripts on 20 September at pg 4-5\nVersion No 1: 08 Jul 2022 (17:09 hrs)\nBorneo Ventures Pte Ltd v \nOng Han Nam[2022] SGHC 162  \n48of as an agreed bundle as the documents were partly agreed and partly not \nagreed. Moreover, Ong did not specifically challenge the authenticity of the \ndocuments in the PSB during the trial.  \n133 Borneo added142 that Ong himself had tendered to court on the first day \nof trial his own supplementary bundle of documents. Hence, what is sauce for \nthe goose is sauce for the gander.  \n134 In its Reply submissions, Borneo argued that Wong\u2019s rebuttal report (to \nwhich Ong did object at the start of trial) was not an expert report. Rather, the \ndocuments were prepared for the purpose of cross-examination \u2013 hence no leave \nwas required.  Wong\u2019s Comparables were used to cross-examine Ms Yen to \ndemonstrate how unreliable and biased her valuation was.  \n135 Borneo submitted143 that Ong\u2019s challenge to the authenticity of the \ndocuments in the PSB is belated and should not be entertained by this court."}

She testified that the complainant \nhad called her at about 8.00am on the morning of 26 December 2016.100  The \ncomplainant told [D] that she felt pain at the area of her anus.101  The \ncomplainant told [D] that she thought that she \u201cwas anal[led]\u201d, meaning that she \nhad been sexually penetrated in the anus.102  The complainant also told [D] that \nshe believed that the accused was responsible for the assault because she \nrecognised his voice.103  [D] testified that she asked the complainant to pass the \nphone to Julniee.104  [D] then told Julniee what had happened to the \ncomplainant.105       \n98 AB at p 269. \n99 AB at p 14. \n100 Transcript, 29 Sep 2020, p 70 lines 9\u201210. \n101 Transcript, 29 Sep 2020, p 70 lines 18\u201222. \n102 Transcript, 29 Sep 2020, p 70 lines 22 and 32, p 71 lines 8\u20129. \n103 Transcript, 29 Sep 2020, p 70 lines 26\u201229. \n104 Transcript, 29 Sep 2020, p 71 lines 22\u201224, p 72 lines 2\u20123 and 16\u201217. \n105 Transcript, 29 Sep 2020, p 72 lines 19\u201222. \nVersion No 1: 15 Jul 2022 (15:47 hrs)\nPP v Tan En Jie Norvan[2022] SGHC 166\n14Julniee\u2019s evidence\n20 Julniee was also called as a witness by the Prosecution.  As the Deputy \nPublic Prosecutor (\u201cDPP\u201d) said in his oral closing submissions, Julniee\u2019s \nevidence plays \u201ca very important role\u201d in the Prosecution\u2019s case.106  Given the \nWhatsApp messages she had sent to the complainant on 27 December 2016 (see \n[17] above), this was hardly surprising. \n21 Julniee\u2019s evidence was consistent with that of the complainant\u2019s in \ndescribing the events leading up to the alleged assault.  She confirmed the \ncomplainant\u2019s evidence that the latter was groggy and nauseous by the time they \nreached the Flat.107  She described how she was initially with the complainant at \nthe Toilet while the complainant was vomiting.108  Julniee also helped change \nthe complainant out of her dress, and into the T-shirt and boxer shorts that the \ncomplainant came to be wearing when she was sexually assaulted.109  \n22 Julniee gave evidence that, after she helped the complainant change, the \ncomplainant continued vomiting.110  She then left the complainant in the Toilet \nto vomit.111  She went to the accused\u2019s room and asked to speak to Ruben in \nprivate.112  She had a misunderstanding with Ruben concerning their \nrelationship, and wanted to speak to Ruben to clear things up.113  The accused \n106 Transcript, 8 Apr 2022, p 8 lines 27\u201229. \n107 Transcript, 13 Sep 2021, p 5 lines 24 and 25\u201228, p 6 line 3. \n108 Transcript, 13 Sep 2021, p 6 lines 3\u201220. \n109 Transcript, 13 Sep 2021, p 7 lines 21\u201223. \n110 Transcript, 13 Sep 2021, p 8 lines 14\u201215. \n111 Transcript, 13 Sep 2021, p 8 line 20. \n112 Transcript, 13 Sep 2021, p 8 lines 20\u201222. \n113 Transcript, 13 Sep 2021, p 9 lines 8\u201221. \nVersion No 1: 15 Jul 2022 (15:47 hrs)\nPP v Tan En Jie Norvan[2022] SGHC 166\n15left the room so that she and Ruben could speak in private.114  At that time, Alex \nwas asleep on the floor of that room.115  At this juncture, I should add that Julniee \nalso testified that she was in the accused\u2019s room speaking with Ruben for five \nminutes.116  Julniee also testified that when the accused left his room, he had left \nthe room door slightly open.117  This is consistent with the accused\u2019s evidence.118  \nThis may suggest that, when Julniee had her private conversation with Ruben \nin the accused\u2019s room (during which the alleged sexual assault had taken place), \nthe accused\u2019s room door had been open and not shut as the complainant has \ntestified (see [ 9] above).  However, I note that there is evidence to the contrary.  \nIn an investigation statement recorded from Julniee on 28 April 2017, Julniee \nstated that after she had \u201ctalked to Ruben for a while\u201d, the accused returned to \nhis room to check if she and Ruben were done.  When she informed the accused \nthat they were not done, the accused then closed his room door and left.119  Thus, \naccording to Julniee\u2019s investigation statement, the accused had initially left his \nroom door ajar but later shut it after he returned to the room and saw that Ruben \nand Julniee were still talking.  When Julniee was cross-examined by the \nProsecution on this part of her investigation statement (see [ 29] below), she \ntestified that she could not recall that the accused had returned to his room to \ncheck on her and Ruben and shut the room door.120  Her oral evidence is that the \naccused\u2019s room door had been left open throughout the entire duration of her \n114 Transcript, 13 Sep 2021, p 9 line 7. \n115 Transcript, 13 Sep 2021, p 8 lines 30\u201232. \n116 Transcript, 13 Sep 2021, p 11 lines 14\u201232;

According to Julniee\u2019s WhatsApp messages, none \nof them knew anything about what had happened.144  However, in her testimony, \nJulniee claimed that this was all a lie, because she did not actually speak to any \nof the three of them.145  She said in court that she had lied because she was \nhoping that, by telling the complainant that she did not know who was \nresponsible for the assault, the complainant would come to the view that there \nwas \u201cno conclusion\u201d and so would not continue to pursue the matter.146  Julniee \nclaimed that she did not want to find out what had happened to the complainant \n140 Transcript, 13 Sep 2021, p 18 lines 13\u201221. \n141 Transcript, 13 Sep 2021, p 18 lines 21\u201223. \n142 Transcript, 13 Sep 2021, p 20 lines 4\u20128.  \n143 Transcript, 13 Sep 2021, p 21 lines 1\u201212. \n144 AB at pp 231\u2012232. \n145 Transcript, 13 Sep 2021, p 24 lines 18\u201224, p 25 lines 9\u201211. \n146 Transcript, 13 Sep 2021, p 25 lines 4\u20127; p 26 lines 22\u201226. \nVersion No 1: 15 Jul 2022 (15:47 hrs)\nPP v Tan En Jie Norvan[2022] SGHC 166\n19because in her view,  it was \u201cvery hard for something that big to happen \u2026 \nduring that few minutes\u201d.147  In this regard, she was referring to the period of \ntime in which the complainant had been out of her sight and while she was in \nthe accused\u2019s room speaking to Ruben. \n28  As for the WhatsApp message to the complainant sent in the evening of \n27 December 2016, where Julniee said that she found out that the accused had \nbeen responsible for the assault, but that the accused only admitted to \n\u201cfingering\u201d the complainant (see [ 17] above), her evidence in court was that she \nwas lying in this and her other messages to the complainant.  She did this so that \nthe complainant would drop the idea of reporting the assault to the police, which \nthe latter had said she wanted to do.148\n29   In the light of Julniee\u2019s evidence in court, the Prosecution applied to \ncross-examine her on two investigation statements that she had given to the \npolice.  There is no dispute that these statements were voluntarily given by \nJulniee.  \n30 In Julniee\u2019s investigation statement recorded by Assistant \nSuperintendent Christine Tai (\u201cASP Tai\u201d) on 28 December 2016 (\u201cthe 28 Dec \nStatement\u201d)149, she stated that she was in the accused\u2019s room speaking to Ruben \nin private for about eight to ten minutes.

While doing so, the accused said that the complainant \n\u201chugged\u201d him.\n31 In the 28 Dec Statement, Julniee also stated that she had been woken by \nthe complainant at around 8.00am on 26 December 2016.  The complainant \npassed her mobile phone to Julniee so that she could speak to [D].  The 28 Dec \nStatement recorded Julniee\u2019s recollection of the conversation with [D] as \nfollows: \n[D] told me that something had happened to [the complainant] \nlast night and she felt pain in her butt but she don\u2019t know how \nto tell me so [D] told me briefly what happened.\n32 Julniee also stated in the 28 Dec Statement that, on the evening of 26 \nDecember 2016, she had called Ruben to find out what happened, but the latter \nsaid he had no idea.  The statement also recorded her as saying that she had \nspoken to the accused, who said that he could not remember anything.  Then, \non 27 December 2016, Julniee questioned the accused again.  The accused told \nher that, while he was smoking in the kitchen, he heard the complainant fall, so \nhe went into the Toilet to help her up, and while he was helping her get up from \nthe floor of the Toilet, the complainant had thrown herself at him, and they \n\u201cmake out\u201d [sic].  Julniee also stated that the accused told her that he and the \ncomplainant were kissing, but that he could not remember what happened after \nthat.  In the statement, Julniee went on to explain that, in the evening of 27 \nDecember 2016, she had told the complainant, through a message, that the \naccused was responsible for what had happened to her, and she also tried to \npersuade the complainant not to make a police report.\nVersion No 1: 15 Jul 2022 (15:47 hrs)\nPP v Tan En Jie Norvan[2022] SGHC 166\n2133 Julniee gave a further investigation statement to ASP Tai on 28 April \n2017 (\u201cthe 28 Apr Statement\u201d),150 which I have referred to earlier in this \njudgment (see [ 22] above).  ASP Tai had shown her the WhatsApp messages \nwhich she exchanged with the complainant on 26 and 27 December 2016.  \nThese messages had been extracted from the complainant\u2019s mobile phone.  ASP \nTai then asked Julniee a series of questions and recorded her answers.  \nQ5)  How did you manage to ascertain that it was your \nbrother?\nA5)  My brother was with me at home and I told him what \nhappened to [V] that morning and he told me that he \nwants to talk things out.\nQ6)  What did you brother admit to you?  \nA6)  He cannot recall what he did but he told me that he was \ndrunk too and he say that he didn\u2019t fuck [V] and he only \ncan recall that he fingered her.\n\u2026\nQ10)  I refer to s\/r 434 [referring to a WhatsApp message that \nJulniee had sent to the complainant on 27 December \n2016].

You mentioned \u2018My brother just told \nmy family and I his side of story that he didn\u2019t penetrate \ninto you.  And that you throw yourself at him and yall \nmade out.

After I changed her out into my \nhome attire, I went to my brother\u2019s room to talk to \nRuben.  Alex was sleeping in the room so I told my \nbrother to leave as I want some privacy with Ruben.  \nAfter I talked to Ruben for a while, my brother came in \nto check if we were done.  When I told him that we were \nnot done.  He closed the door and left. \u2026 \n34 After having reviewed the 28 Dec Statement and the 28 Apr Statement, \nI accepted that there were material inconsistencies between Julniee\u2019s evidence \nin court and what she had said in her investigation statements.  I thus allowed \nthe Prosecution to proceed with their cross-examination of Julniee under s \n147(1) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe EA\u201d).  \n35 Under cross-examination by both the Prosecution and later the Defence, \nJulniee kept to her version of events, which can be summarised as follows.  \nVersion No 1: 15 Jul 2022 (15:47 hrs)\nPP v Tan En Jie Norvan[2022] SGHC 166\n23(a) She insisted that she spoke to Ruben in the accused\u2019s room for \nless than five minutes.151  She also testified that, when she went to the \nkitchen after speaking to Ruben, she could not recall that the accused \nhad told her that he tried to help the complainant up from the floor, or \nthat the complainant had hugged him in the process of doing so.152  She \ntestified that all the accused told her was \u201cyour friend damn drunk\u201d.153\n(b) Julniee also denied that she had been told by [D] over the phone \nthat the complainant had been sexually penetrated in her anus, while the \nlatter was in the Toilet.  Julniee claimed that she could only remember \nthat [D] had told her that the complainant had informed [D] that \u201cher \n[the complainant\u2019s] butt hurts\u201d and that she could not remember \nanything else that [D] might have told her over the phone.154\n(c) She testified that she did not believe that the complainant had \nactually been assaulted,155 but she had sent messages to the complainant \nthat gave the impression that she was trying to find out who the assailant \nwas only to show the complainant that she was concerned.156  She \ninsisted that she never spoke to Ruben to ask him whether he knew what \nhappened.157\n151 Transcript, 13 Sep 2021, p 38 lines 12\u201217. \n152 Transcript, 13 Sep 2021, p 38 lines 23\u201227. \n153 Transcript, 13 Sep 2021, p 38 lines 28\u201231. \n154 Transcript, 13 Sep 2021, p 39 lines 5\u201211; 14 Sep 2021, p 29 lines 20\u201232, p 30 lines \n1\u201218. \n155 Transcript, 14 Sep 2021, p 41 lines 20\u201221. \n156 Transcript, 14 Sep 2021, p 41 lines 7\u20129, p 42 lines 7\u20128. \n157 Transcript, 13 Sep 2021, p 40 lines 14\u201219; 14 Sep 2021, p 43 lines 13\u201216. \nVersion No 1: 15 Jul 2022 (15:47 hrs)\nPP v Tan En Jie Norvan[2022] SGHC 166\n24(d) She repeatedly denied that the accused had admitted to her or \ntheir parents that he had \u201cfingered\u201d the complainant or that he had kissed \nthe complainant.158  She claimed that, when she showed the accused the \ncomplainant\u2019s message about her (Julniee) wanting to protect the \naccused if he was indeed responsible for the sexual assaults (see [ 16] \nabove), the accused brushed her off and told her words to the effect that \nshe should \u201cmanage [her] own problems\u201d.159 \n(e) She claimed that she had subsequently identified the accused as \nthe assailant in her WhatsApp messages to the complainant (see [ 17] \nabove) because the latter had already assumed that it was him160 and she \nwanted to assuage the complainant.  She claimed that the complainant \nhad assured her that no police report would be made once the assailant \nwas identified.161\n(f) Julniee also testified that she had lied to ASP Tai in many parts \nof her two investigation statements, or that she could not recall many of \nthe things she told ASP Tai in those statements.\n36 On the basis of her inconsistent evidence in court, the Prosecution \nsubmits that Julniee\u2019s credit should be impeached pursuant to s 157(c) of the \nEA, and full weight should be given to the 28 Dec Statement and the 28 Apr \nStatement under s 147(3) of the EA.

These were Dr Koh Meiling Serena \n(\u201cDr Koh\u201d) from KK Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Hospital, and Dr Zheng Zhimin \n(\u201cDr Zheng\u201d) from the Institute of Mental Health.  The Prosecution relies on the \ncomplainant\u2019s account of the events in relation to the alleged offences given to \nDr Koh and Dr Zheng, and as recorded in their medical reports,162 and submits \nthat the complainant has maintained a consistent version of the events \nthroughout.\n38 The Prosecution also called a senior forensic scientist from the Health \nSciences Authority (\u201cHSA\u201d), Mr Ping Shueh Yang (\u201cMr Ping\u201d), to give \nevidence.  He had examined, amongst other items, the T-shirt and the boxer \nshorts worn by the complainant at the time of the assault and prepared a report \non his findings.163  Mr Ping\u2019s evidence is that the exterior back of the T-shirt \nworn by the complainant tested positive for acid phosphatase, prostate-specific \nantigen, and semenogelin.  From this result, Mr Ping could confirm that semen \nwas present at the exterior back of the T-shirt.  Further, from an examination of \nthe DNA, the semen found matched the DNA profile of the accused.\n39 At the conclusion of the Prosecution\u2019s case, I called for the Defence.  \n162 Exhibits P32 and P24. \n163 Exhibit P31A. \nVersion No 1: 15 Jul 2022 (15:47 hrs)\nPP v Tan En Jie Norvan[2022] SGHC 166\n26The Defence\u2019s case \n40 The accused elected to give evidence.

The accused gave evidence that \nhe and Pang lived like \u201chusband and wife\u201d in the Flat.  According to him, he \nand Pang would have sex on a daily basis whenever she was not working on a \nflight.230  They would do so at various locations in the flat, including in the \nToilet while they were showering together.231  When he did so, he would \nejaculate on the floor or wall of the Toilet.232  The case for the Defence is that \nthe accused\u2019s semen might have been on the floor or wall of the Toilet, or on \nsome other article of clothing in the laundry basket, and from there, the semen \nwas transferred to the exterior back of the T-shirt.  That might have happened \nwhen the T-shirt came into contact with the floor or wall of the Toilet or some \nother article of clothing in the laundry basket.

It is not in dispute that the act of kissing the complainant\u2019s lips \nand the touching of the complainant\u2019s breast, both without her consent, \nconstitute acts of criminal force, and if indeed so perpetrated by the accused, \nwould have been intended by him to outrage the modesty of the complainant \n(see, eg Teo Keng Pong v Public Prosecutor [1996] 2 SLR(R) 890).  Thus, in \nrespect of the third and fourth charges, the only issue before this court is whether \nthe accused had indeed kissed her lips and touched her breast as the complainant \nhas alleged. \nVersion No 1: 15 Jul 2022 (15:47 hrs)\nPP v Tan En Jie Norvan[2022] SGHC 166\n3765 An accused person can be convicted solely on a complainant\u2019s testimony \nalone but only when it is so \u201cunusually convincing\u201d as to overcome any doubts \nthat might arise from the lack of corroboration (see AOF v Public Prosecutor \n[2012] 3 SLR 34 (\u201cAOF\u201d) at [111]).  While the \u201cunusually convincing\u201d standard \ndoes not change the rule that the Prosecution must prove its case beyond a \nreasonable doubt, it does set the threshold for the complainant\u2019s testimony to be \npreferred over the accused\u2019s evidence where the case is one that boils down to \none person\u2019s words against another\u2019s (see XP v Public Prosecutor [2008] 4 \nSLR(R) 686 (\u201cXP\u201d) at [31]).  The emphasis is on the sufficiency of the \ncomplainant\u2019s testimony, and the threshold would be met only if the testimony, \nwhen weighed against the overall backdrop of the available facts and \ncircumstances, contains that ring of truth which leaves the court satisfied that \nno reasonable doubt exists in favour of the accused (see Public Prosecutor v \nMohammed Liton Mohammed Syeed Mallik [2008] 1 SLR(R) 601 (\u201cLiton\u201d) at \n[39]). \n66 A witness\u2019s testimony may only be found to be \u201cunusually convincing\u201d \nby weighing the demeanour of the witness alongside both the internal and \nexternal consistencies found in the witness\u2019s testimony (see AOF at [115]).  The \ndemeanour of the witness is not invariably determinative, and if the witness fails \nto recall or satisfactorily explain material facts and assertions, her credible \ndemeanour cannot overcome such deficiencies (see XP at [71]).  Finally, even \nif the witness\u2019s testimony is found to be \u201cunusually convincing\u201d, it does not \nautomatically lead to a guilty verdict and does not dispense with the need for \nthe court to consider the other evidence and the factual circumstances peculiar \nto each case, as well as the need to assess the complainant\u2019s testimony against \nthat of the accused\u2019s (see AOF at [114(d)]).  An \u201cunusually convincing\u201d \nVersion No 1: 15 Jul 2022 (15:47 hrs)\nPP v Tan En Jie Norvan[2022] SGHC 166\n38testimony does not overcome materially or inherently contradictory evidence \n(see AOF at [114(d)]).  \n67 If the complainant\u2019s testimony is not \u201cunusually convincing\u201d, then the \naccused\u2019s conviction is unsafe unless there is some corroboration of the \ncomplainant\u2019s evidence (see AOF at [173]).  A liberal approach is adopted in \ndetermining whether a particular piece of evidence can amount to corroboration \n(see Liton at [43]).  There is no need for the corroborative evidence to consist \nof independent evidence implicating the accused in a material particular, and \nwhat is important is the substance as well as the relevance of the evidence, and \nwhether it is supportive or confirmative of the weak evidence which it is meant \nto corroborate (see Liton at [43]).  However, it is clear that subsequent repeated \ncomplaints by a complainant cannot, in and of themselves, constitute \ncorroborative evidence so as to dispense with the requirement for \u201cunusually \nconvincing\u201d testimony (see AOF at [114(a)]; XP at [29])."}

After taking into account, by way of set-off, various amounts that were awarded by the Arbitrator to the plaintiff, the Arbitrator awarded a net sum of $2,117,515.99 (excluding interest) in the first defendant\u2019s favour.

During the Site Visit, the plaintiff\u2019s representatives took several photographs of the Overhead Cranes.

Only one (categorised by the Arbitrator as \u201cRequest 4\u201d) is relevant to the applications before me.', '15\\u2003Given its centrality to the plaintiff\u2019s applications, in the following paragraphs, I set out in some detail (a) the plaintiff\u2019s Request 4 in relation to the Removal Order; and (b) the Arbitrator\u2019s decision on that request. The plaintiff submitted that upon inspection of the Overhead Cranes during the Site Visit, it realised for the first time that instead of dismantling and properly taking down the Overhead Cranes, the first defendant had \u201csevered the steel structural components into pieces\u201d. As a result, the Overhead Cranes had been damaged and\/or destroyed. Any residual value in the dismantled components had been destroyed and the remaining structural parts would only amount to scrap metal. In addition, various components of the Overhead Cranes had gone missing and \u201cmay have been cannibalised by the [first defendant] for its own use\u201d. These include (amongst others) the main control panels, various motors, cables, drag chains, power cables and cable festoon systems of the Overhead Cranes. 14', '16\\u2003The plaintiff claimed that these matters were unknown to it until the Site Visit. According to the plaintiff, the Site Visit was the first opportunity it had to properly inspect the \u201cdismantled crane system\u201d. 15', 'Thus, the plaintiff and the Arbitrator were not in a position to take into account the destruction of the Overhead Cranes and the resulting depreciation in their value in the plaintiff\u2019s earlier evidence and submissions in the Arbitration, and thus, this issue was not dealt with by the Arbitrator in the Final Award.', '17\\u2003In the main, the plaintiff was dissatisfied that, unbeknownst to itself and the Arbitrator, the Overhead Cranes had allegedly been destroyed in the course of being dismantled\/uninstalled by the first defendant following the termination of the Contract. According to the plaintiff, this was contrary to the first defendant\u2019s constant representations throughout the Arbitration that the Overhead Cranes had merely been dismantled and stored at the first defendant\u2019s premises pending the outcome of the Arbitration, which in turn led to the natural inference that the \u201cparts remained capable of reassembly (in which case their resale value would have been considerable)\u201d. 16', 'The plaintiff contended that as a result of the alleged destruction of the Overhead Cranes, their resale value would have deteriorated by about 50% of the original value. The plaintiff argued that the issue necessitated further consideration and an order from the Arbitrator, by way of an interpretation of the Final Award and\/or additional award. 17', 'The plaintiff\u2019s request for relief in the Rule 33 Application was stated as follows: 18', '18\\u2003In response, the first defendant submitted, inter alia, that the plaintiff\u2019s request cannot appropriately be dealt with under r 33 of the SIAC Rules since the conditions for its invocation were not satisfied. The plaintiff\u2019s claim was a new claim and was not part of the Arbitrator\u2019s mandate. To bring matters to a logical close, the first defendant suggested that the Removal Order be clarified as an order for removal on an \u201cas is where is\u201d basis. Alternatively, it submitted that the plaintiff was estopped from raising any arguments relating to the alleged damage to the Overhead Cranes, whether in the Arbitration or in separate proceedings, because of the doctrine of extended res judicata or abuse of process. 19', '19\\u2003After considering the submissions from the parties on the Rule 33 Application, the Arbitrator issued the Rule 33 Decision on 8 February 2021. The Arbitrator rejected the plaintiff\u2019s request for an interpretation of the Final Award and\/or an additional award on account of the alleged damage to the Overhead Cranes. The Arbitrator noted that he was functus officio after the release of the Final Award save in the limited circumstances set out in r 33 of the SIAC Rules. The Arbitrator found that r 33.3 (which dealt with the making of an additional award) only applied in respect of claims presented in the arbitration but not dealt with in the award. As it was not in dispute that the plaintiff had not, prior to the release of the Final Award, raised the matters relating to the alleged damage to\/cannibalisation of the Overhead Cranes and consequent diminution in value in the course of the Arbitration, r 33.3 of the SIAC Rules did not provide a basis for the Arbitrator to determine those matters. Accordingly, he was not in a position to issue the directions sought by the plaintiff. 20', '20\\u2003The Arbitrator also rejected the first defendant\u2019s suggested clarification of the Final Award that the Removal Order should be on an \u201cas is where is\u201d basis. The Arbitrator was of the view that while the first defendant framed its suggestion as such, it was in fact requesting the Arbitrator to make the clarificatory order. The Arbitrator found that there was no basis to grant this request as it would not be within his powers to do so under r 33 of the SIAC Rules. The Arbitrator concluded that r 33.1 did not apply as the first defendant\u2019s request did not involve any \u201cerror in computation, any clerical or typographical error or any error of a similar nature\u201d. Further, in the Final Award, the first defendant\u2019s request for the plaintiff to \u201cremove and dispose\u201d of the Overhead Cranes had been expressly rejected by the Arbitrator. Thus, it could not be said that the Arbitrator had not dealt with the first defendant\u2019s request, and therefore r 33.3 did not apply. As for an interpretation of the Final Award, the Arbitrator considered that the first defendant was unable to identify the relevant parts of the Final Award which were unclear, ambiguous or vague and as such, there was nothing in the Final Award to be interpreted such as to make r 33.4 applicable. 21', '21\\u2003What I have set out at [19] and [20] above encapsulates the ratio decidendi of the Arbitrator\u2019s decision on the Rule 33 Application in so far as the Removal Order and Request 4 are concerned. However, the Arbitrator went on, in obiter dicta, to state that even if he had the power to consider the first defendant\u2019s request to clarify the Removal Order as being on an \u201cas is where is\u201d basis, he would have dismissed it.', '22\\u2003From the correspondence exchanged between the parties, the Arbitrator observed that the plaintiff had made clear from the inception that the first defendant was under no circumstances to tamper with the Overhead Cranes as they constituted evidence relevant to the Arbitration. Since the first defendant\u2019s case was that it was entitled to reject the Overhead Cranes, the Arbitrator considered that the first defendant \u201ccannot on one hand claim that [it was] rejecting the [Overhead Cranes] (thereby disclaiming any right of ownership in respect of the same), and freely cannibali[s]e the [parts of the Overhead Cranes] on the other\u201d. 22', 'The Arbitrator also noted that the first defendant had represented during the Arbitration that it had \u201crefrained from tampering\u201d with the Overhead Cranes after communications with the plaintiff and that this was irreconcilable with the position it took in the Rule 33 Application that it was entitled to do as it saw fit in respect of the Overhead Cranes. At no point in time prior to the release of the Final Award did the first defendant indicate that the dismantling of the Overhead Cranes could have resulted in destruction of the same to any extent or that the components of the Overhead Cranes had been removed. If the first defendant had so indicated, this would then have been a matter for determination in the Final Award. As it stood, there was no basis for the first defendant\u2019s request that the Removal Order be clarified as one on an \u201cas is where is\u201d basis. 23', '23\\u2003The Arbitrator also observed that there was no indication that the plaintiff \u201cshould have been aware that the dismantling of the [Overhead Cranes] could have resulted in their destruction\u201d. 24', 'There was nothing in the correspondence exchanged between the parties that indicated that the dismantling could have resulted in some destruction of the Overhead Cranes. The relief sought by the first defendant, ie, that it had a right to reject the Overhead Cranes and claim the return of the purchase price, also meant that, if granted, the first defendant would need to return the Overhead Cranes to the plaintiff. Accordingly, the relief sought by the first defendant would not have put the plaintiff on notice that not all components of the Overhead Crane System that it had supplied would be returned. Finally, in light of his rejection of the first defendants\u2019 request, the Arbitrator did not consider it necessary to address its arguments on the application of the doctrine of extended res judicata or abuse of process. 25', '24\\u2003The Arbitrator eventually made one correction to the Final Award to correct a double-counting error which resulted in the principal net sum awarded being reduced to $2,110,025.99. The Arbitrator also extended the time for the plaintiff to remove the Overhead Cranes to six months from the date when the plaintiff is allowed access to the first defendant\u2019s premises (or within such time as agreed by the parties). 26', '25\\u2003Just over a month after the Rule 33 Decision was rendered, the first defendant commenced OS 212 on 10 March 2021 and obtained the Leave Order.'"}

When it was clear to Ms Tiong that Dr Chan wanted to end the relationship, she took matters into her own hands to seek revenge on Dr Chan. Between 29 May 2018 and June 2018, Ms Tiong demanded from Dr Chan a Cartier watch and $10,000, which was later increased to $150,000. She also sent the Screenshots to Dr Chan\u2019s family members. 22', 'Subsequently, Dr Chan made a police report against Ms Tiong for extortion.

On 20 February 2020, at around 5.00am, he hailed a taxi driven by the Victim near 427 Hougang Ave 6, Singapore. The Victim was 54 years old at the time of the offence.', '9\\u2003Upon boarding the Victim\u2019s taxi, the Appellant told the Victim that he wanted to go to the casino at Marina Bay Sands. Shortly after the Victim started driving, the Appellant told the Victim that he had forgotten to take something from home and asked the Victim to stop at the bus stop by 427 Hougang Avenue 6 Singapore. As soon as the Victim stopped the taxi to comply with his request, the Appellant grabbed the Victim from the rear passenger seat and choked him. The Victim struggled to break free but was unable to do so. The Victim sounded his car horn in the hope of scaring the Appellant off or getting the attention of any passers-by. The Appellant released the chokehold on the Victim and then grabbed his hands to stop him from sounding the horn. The Victim managed to bite the Appellant\u2019s hand and the Appellant let go.', '10\\u2003The Appellant then got out of the taxi, opened the door where the Victim was seated and then punched him on his face around four times, pushed him towards the front passenger seat, and again choked him on the neck. The Appellant then released his grip and fled from the scene. The Victim immediately called the police.', '11\\u2003The Victim was accompanied to Sengkang General Hospital and seen at at 6.00am. He was found to have sustained the following injuries:', '(a)\\u2003Bruises over his right eye and nasal bridge;', '(b)\\u2003A mildly displaced nasal bone fracture;', '(c)\\u2003An undisplaced fracture of the left anterior 8th rib; and', '(d)\\u2003A minimally displaced right inferior posterior orbital wall fracture.', '12\\u2003The Victim was discharged the following day. He was given hospitalisation leave for six days from 20 to 25 February 2020. When he was reviewed on 25 February 2020, the facial bruising and swelling were found to have resolved, and he was advised that his facial fractures could be managed conservatively.', '13\\u2003The Appellant contended that he attacked the Victim because the Appellant was upset over some personal matters, and because he did not like the Victim\u2019s tone. Neither of these claims was particularised in any way. It was not seriously disputed that the attack was unprovoked. The Appellant left for Malaysia shortly after he fled from the scene of the offence. Upon his return to Singapore, he was arrested on 22 October 2021 some 18 months later.', '14\\u2003The District Judge considered that the main sentencing considerations were deterrence and retribution, and applied the two-step sentencing approach set out by the Court of Appeal in Public Prosecutor v BDB [2018] 1 SLR 127 (\u201cBDB\u201d), which is as follows:', '(a)\\u2003First, the court should examine the seriousness of the injury as an indicator of the gravity of the offence, and from that derive the indicative starting point for sentencing, having regard to the wide range of (a) the possible injuries and (b) the possible sentences.', '(b)\\u2003Second, once the indicative starting point has been identified, the sentencing judge should consider the culpability of the offender, and the relevant aggravating and\/or mitigating factors.', '15\\u2003The District Judge found that the indicative starting point in this case should be around 12 or 13 months\u2019 imprisonment, and not between 13 and 15 months\u2019 imprisonment as the Prosecution had submitted. In arriving at this starting point, the District Judge considered the fact that there were multiple injuries, including fractures mainly at vulnerable parts of the body, and therefore thought that the starting point could not be as low as 6 months\u2019 imprisonment, as the Defence had submitted. In rejecting the submission made by the Defence, the District Judge distinguished the decision in Arumugam Selvaraj v Public Prosecutor [2019] 5 SLR 881 (\u201cArumugam\u201d), where the court applied a starting point of 6 months\u2019 imprisonment, in a case where the victim had suffered a fracture of a single finger accompanied by extensive bruises. The District Judge was satisfied that the nature and severity of the injuries suffered by the Victim was far worse than that inflicted in Arumugam.', '16\\u2003Having identified the indicative starting point of 12 or 13 months\u2019 imprisonment, the District Judge proceeded to the second stage of the BDB framework and examined the offender\u2019s culpability and the relevant aggravating and mitigating factors. The District Judge considered that the attack on the Victim was relentless and entirely one-sided. The District Judge also inferred from the sequence of actions undertaken by the Appellant that the whole attack was premeditated. The District Judge also considered it an aggravating factor that the Appellant fled to Malaysia soon after the offence and thought this demonstrated an intention to avoid detection and arrest. The District Judge rejected the Appellant\u2019s bare allegation that he in fact had to return urgently to Malaysia to attend to personal matters because his sister had been hospitalised. The District Judge also noted that the Appellant had deliberately attacked the Victim\u2019s face, which was a vulnerable area and considered this an additional aggravating factor. Finally, the District Judge also considered that this was an attack on a public transport worker committed in the very early hours of the morning, which was a riskier driving period for public transport workers since there would less likely be others around who might intervene. Given these aggravating factors, the District Judge adjusted the indicative sentence upwards to 14 months\u2019 imprisonment.', '17\\u2003The District Judge then considered the mitigating factors, and given that the Appellant had pleaded guilty, he adjusted the sentence to 13 months\u2019 imprisonment. The sentence was backdated to 22 October 2021, being the date of his arrest and remand.'"}

During the hearing of the appeal, the Prosecution conceded that this was incorrect as the fracture was merely a \u201csuspicious\u201d or suspected fracture. Instead, the grievous hurt caused in the present case related to the category of hurt whereby the sufferer was unable to follow his ordinary pursuits during the space of 20 days, under s 320(h) of the PC. Notwithstanding this error, I accept that the Prosecution\u2019s reliance on s 320(h) of the PC to establish grievous hurt is borne out by the facts admitted to by the appellant in the SOF.

First, he noted that there was no express provision under the WICA 2009 that allowed him to do so. Neither was there any clerical or arithmetical mistake that would have allowed him to make an addition or alteration to the Certificate of Order, in exercise of his powers under reg 11(2)(c) of the Work Injury Compensation Regulations (2010 Rev Ed). Accordingly, once the Certificate of Order had been issued, the Assistant Commissioner was functus officio and could not revise or set aside his orders. 31', '17\\u2003Second, Assistant Commissioner Loh observed that he was required under s 25(2) of the WICA 2009 to disregard the objection raised by the applicant (ie, that the Certificate of Order should be withdrawn as the Settlement Sum had been paid to the first and second respondents). Section 25 of the WICA 2009 provides that:', '18\\u2003The applicant had not raised the payment of the Settlement Sum as a ground of objection within the 14-day period provided for under s 25(1) of the WICA 2009, although it had the opportunity to do so. Accordingly, Assistant Commissioner Loh reasoned that he was \u201clegally required\u201d to disregard the applicant\u2019s belated objection. 32', 'There was therefore no legal basis for him to rescind or set aside the Certificate of Order. 33'"}

For Bharat Forge merely to prove that its crew could not connect iPads to Bluetooth headphones (both of which were purchased by Bharat Forge) does not create a prima facie likelihood that some defect in BASS\u2019 workmanship was to blame. On the contrary, from the evidence, this appears to have nothing to do with BASS\u2019 workmanship in installing the new CMS; rather, the likelihood is that Bharat Forge\u2019s crew just did not know how to connect iPads to Bluetooth headphones (which is what the evidence shows), or that there was something wrong with the iPads and\/or Bluetooth headphones.

The death of the father is tragic, \nbut that does not by itself, given the youth of the offender, pull the offender out \nof the ambit of the alternative sentencing regime specified in s 38 of the CYPA.  \nDetention is thus the punishment to be imposed.  \n7 While I am grateful to the Prosecution for identifying possible parallels \nwith imprisonment cases, the length of detention cannot however be determined \nby such parallels drawn with sentences imposed on adults \u2013 there is and should \nbe a qualitative difference between imprisonment and detention.\n8 Given the ability of the Minister to release a detained offender on licence \nunder s 38(4) of the CYPA (now s 43(4) of the 2020 revised edition), one \napproach would have been for the court to consider what would be an \nappropriate maximum term of detention, to be cut down by the Minister in the \nexercise of discretion.   On that approach, the court would presumably act \ncautiously and lean towards longer sentences generally.  However, I accept that \ngiven the dearth of guidance in the local context that such an approach may \ncreate great uncertainty.  For the moment at least then, the best approach is for \nthe court to consider what is appropriate bearing in mind the sentencing \nobjectives, and to treat the possibility of release on licence as being somewhat \nexceptional, or at least not run-of-the-mill. \n9  I should also note that s 38 of the CYPA does not expressly provide for \nbackdating, which indicates that that power is not conferred on the courts, \nthough a conclusive pronouncement will need to await considered arguments in \nan appropriate case.\nVersion No 2: 26 Jan 2022 (16:35 hrs)\nPP v CNJ[2022] SGHC 18\n4The relevant sentencing objectives \n10 The length of detention should be calibrated on a principled basis, which \nrequires consideration of the purposes of detention.  There has been no reported \npronouncement on this.  But given that it is prescribed for the punishment of \nminors who have committed various serious crimes, the objectives conceivably \nought to encompass rehabilitation, protection of the public, retribution and \nspecific deterrence.  General deterrence is presumably excluded, given that \ndetention is a special regime, replacing imprisonment.\n11 Of the various objectives, rehabilitation is important, given the age and \nimmaturity of the offender.  This has been described in various cases such as \nPP v ASR [2019] 1 SLR 941 as being the dominant consideration.  It is material \nthat under s 38(4) of the CYPA, the offender may be released on licence upon \nthe Minister\u2019s determination.  That opportunity to be released further reinforces \nthe conclusion that rehabilitation is a very important facet. I would however \nnote that in the context of s 38, it is not the sole consideration.  Protection of the \npublic would also be relevant and would be tied to the rehabilitative efforts since \nif rehabilitation is successful, the public would presumably be safer.  Specific \ndeterrence and punishment may also be in play given the gravity of the offence \nand the need to ensure it is not repeated by the offender.  In particular, \nretribution remains material as a life has been lost and some consequence must \nbe visited upon the offender.  \n12 In determining the appropriate sentence, bearing in mind these various \nobjectives, the details given by the Prosecution about the rehabilitative \nprogrammes and the conditions of detention were helpful.  I note that the \naccused will have opportunities for education and to sit for examinations.  There \nwill also apparently be other supportive programmes.  All of these go towards \nVersion No 2: 26 Jan 2022 (16:35 hrs)\nPP v CNJ[2022] SGHC 18\n5rehabilitation.  I am also given the assurance by the Prosecution that the prison \nauthorities will bear in mind the accused\u2019s circumstances when he is \nsubsequently transferred over to the prison school.  \nCalibration of the sentence\n13 Turning therefore to the specific circumstances here, given the \nseriousness of the offence, the present age of the accused, and what is to be \nhoped from detention, I am of the view that the appropriate term of detention \nshould be five years.  I am not assured that any shorter period will enable \nsufficient rehabilitation and reform to be effected, so that the accused will be \nable to function as a law-abiding citizen and that the public will be kept \nsufficiently safe from any repeat.  The lower sentence sought by the Defence, \nthat is three years\u2019 restriction of freedom, would also appear to be too short \ngiven the circumstances.\n14 The various factors relied upon by the Defence to argue for a period of \ndetention cannot be given that much weight.  I could not see that the accused\u2019s \ngaming addiction was operative and material in sentencing for this offence.  \nCooperation with the authorities is not of much weight as well: the investigation \nwould not have been particularly complex here and would not have been \nsubstantively aided by any cooperation by the accused.  The absence of \nantecedents is also to be expected in someone as young as him.  Conversely, the \npresence of family support does not address the need for both retribution and \nprotection.  His academic promise may go to the question of rehabilitation but \nagain does not address the need for retribution and protection.  As for the \nmother\u2019s illness, while unfortunate, that cannot play a role in the calibration of \nthe sentence.  I would also note that his autism had no contributory link to the \nVersion No 2: 26 Jan 2022 (16:35 hrs)\nPP v CNJ[2022] SGHC 18\n6commission of the offence, and is thus not material to the calibration of the \nsentence.\n15 I do, on the other hand, accept the psychiatric assessment that the \naccused is not likely to repeat such a violent act, which goes towards reducing \nthe need for specific deterrence and protection of the public. \n16 Anything as short as three years would not to my mind properly serve \nany of the objectives.  Rehabilitation in respect of an offence where death was \ncaused deliberately, would be an objective that one would prudently expect to \ntake a longer time to achieve, in the absence of actual evidence of progress.  And \na longer period is, I think, required to ensure appropriate deterrence, punishment \nand protection of the public.  While it may be that the probability of a repeated \nact is low, a three-year sentence would to my mind neglect entirely the \nremaining possibility of a repeat.\n17 At the other end of the range, I had considered whether the \ncircumstances called for seven years\u2019 detention.  This would mean that the \naccused would be detained till his early 20s.  The advantage is that this would \npresumably allow for him to mature within a controlled environment.  But as \nnoted by the Defence, taking into account the period spent in remand before \nconviction, this would mean that the accused would effectively be serving \neight years in all, which would appear to be too long.  The ability to be released \non licence is at present uncertain, and in the absence of clearer guidance, it \nwould not be appropriate for me to impose a lengthier sentence that I consider \nappropriate simply on the basis of caution. \n18 I conclude therefore that a five-year sentence of detention would balance \nthe various considerations, and so sentence the accused.\nVersion No 2: 26 Jan 2022 (16:35 hrs)\nPP v CNJ[2022] SGHC 18\n7A suggestion for the authorities\n19 I would suggest to the authorities that it may be worthwhile to consider \nwhether some form of a regime of pre-sentencing assessment should be laid out, \nsimilar to those for other alternative sentences, such as reformative training or \ncorrective training.  While one would always hope that young offenders \ncommitting murder or culpable homicide will be rare, these offences do occur.  \nThe creation of a structured pre-sentencing assessment involving psychiatrists, \ndevelopmental psychologists, detention officers and other specialists will likely \nassist the court in calibrating the appropriate sentence.  \n20 I had considered whether I should call for such an assessment here \ndespite the absence of express provisions.  Section 38(1) of the CYPA (now \ns 43(1) of the 2020 revised edition) gives sufficient leeway to the court I should \nthink.  However, such an assessment regime will require a fairly detailed \ndiscussion with the relevant specialists and the authorities.  I do not know, for \ninstance, what sort of rehabilitation and intervention might be feasible, or what \nthe science might indicate.  I suspect the discussion and deliberation necessary \non the part of the relevant authorities may take some time, and it may be that \nthe conclusion reached by the relevant agencies is that such a regime is not \nnecessary.  Or it might even be that this was considered previously and not \npursued.  I thus considered it best to proceed with sentencing here. \nAedit Abdullah\nJudge of the High Court\nVersion No 2: 26 Jan 2022 (16:35 hrs)\nPP v CNJ[2022] SGHC 18\n8Lim Shin Hui and Han Ming Kuang (Attorney-General\u2019s Chambers) \nfor the Prosecution;\nNathan Shashidran, Jeremy Pereira and J Jayaletchmi (Withers \nKhattarWong LLP) for the accused.\nVersion No 2: 26 Jan 2022 (16:35 hrs)"}

During the interview, the first defendant allegedly made false and\/or misleading allegations, intending to convey that the Public Prosecutor (\u201cPP\u201d) and\/or the AG had acted in bad faith, maliciously and\/or improperly so as to discredit the Attorney-General\u2019s Chambers (\u201cAGC\u201d) and\/or its legal officers, which amounted to conduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor under s 83(2)(h) of the LPA.', '3\\u2003On 11 December 2014, Gobi was arrested on suspicion of having in his possession two packets of granular substance containing a prohibited drug. Gobi was subsequently charged under s 7 read with s 33(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (\u201cMDA\u201d), punishable by death under s 33(1) read with Second Schedule of the MDA for importing a Class \u2018A\u2019 drug, containing 40.22g of diamorphine. 2', 'At the conclusion of Gobi\u2019s trial, the High Court found in Public Prosecutor v Gobi a\/l Avedian [2017] SGHC 145 (\u201cGobi (HC)\u201d) that Gobi had rebutted the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA that he had knowledge that the granular substance he possessed was diamorphine. The High Court thus convicted him on an amended lesser charge of attempting to import the said diamorphine believing it to be a controlled drug under Class \u2018C\u2019 instead, which was a non-capital charge. Gobi was thus sentenced to 15 years\u2019 imprisonment and ten strokes of the cane. 3', '4\\u2003The PP appealed against Gobi\u2019s acquittal. On 25 October 2018, the Court of Appeal in Public Prosecutor v Gobi a\/l Avedian [2019] 1 SLR 113 (\u201cGobi (CA)\u201d) accepted the PP\u2019s submissions and disagreed with the High Court\u2019s finding that the s 18(2) presumption had been rebutted. Accordingly, the Court of Appeal set aside Gobi\u2019s conviction on the amended charge and convicted Gobi on the original capital charge. 4', '5\\u2003On 27 May 2019, the Court of Appeal issued its judgment in Adili Chibuike Ejike v Public Prosecutor [2019] 2 SLR 254 (\u201cAdili\u201d). In Adili, the Court of Appeal clarified that wilful blindness could not be the subject of the presumption under s 18(1) MDA. 5', '6\\u2003On 3 January 2020, the first defendant filed CA\/CM 1\/2020 seeking leave pursuant to s 394H of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (the \u201cCPC\u201d) and s 11(2) of the Criminal Procedure Rules for the Court of Appeal to review its earlier decision in Gobi (CA) in light of, among other things, the new development in the law established in Adili. 6', '7\\u2003On 20 February 2020, the Court of Appeal granted leave to Gobi to file a review application pursuant to s 394I of the CPC.

On 19 October 2020, the Court of Appeal set aside Gobi\u2019s conviction on the Capital Charge. After reviewing the case, the Court of Appeal delivered brief grounds of its judgment (the \u201cOral Judgment\u201d), as set out in its Minute Sheet. 7', 'Notably, in its Oral Judgment, the Court of Appeal considered the Prosecution\u2019s case in respect of Gobi\u2019s knowledge of the nature of the drugs. In particular, the Court of Appeal noted that the Prosecution might have formulated its case on the premise that actual knowledge and wilful blindness were not distinct concepts. 8', 'As such, while the Prosecution\u2019s case at trial was one of wilful blindness to the nature of the drugs, in contrast, its case on appeal was one of actual knowledge, premised on the contention that Gobi did not in fact believe the assurances he had been given as to the nature of the drugs.

By his own admission, as well as the facts to which he had pleaded guilty in relation to the Second LTA Charge, the Respondent had simply relied on his staff: he did not contact Naseeruddin, had signed the conveyancing documents left on his desk without examining their contents, and was only aware that the Law Firm had acted for Naseeruddin in relation to the Property when he was subsequently questioned by officers from the CAD (see the DT Report at [40]\u2013[41] and [47]).', '19\\u2003Nevertheless, the DT held that only the Alternative 2nd Charge, and not the 2nd Charge, was made out.

However, since cause of sufficient gravity had been established in relation to the 1st Charge, and both charges were related to a single conveyancing transaction in respect of which the Respondent was the solicitor in charge, the DT formed the view that the Respondent\u2019s convictions on both the 1st Charge and the Alternative 2nd Charge should be considered holistically when determining the appropriate sanction to impose. Accordingly, the DT was satisfied, in relation to both the 1st Charge and the Alternative 2nd Charge, that there was a prima facie case of due cause, and in the circumstances, referred the entire matter encompassing both charges to the Court of Three Judges (\u201cC3J\u201d) (see the DT Report at [51]).', '21\\u2003The present application, C3J\/OS 6\/2021, is the Law Society\u2019s application for an order that the Respondent be made to suffer punishment as provided for in s 83(1) of the LPA.

The complainant knew the then sole proprietor of J&C, Ms Cheng Su Yin Judy (\u201cMs Cheng\u201d), and gave instructions to her. Shortly thereafter, from April 2016, Ms Cheng decided not to renew her practising certificate. The respondent then became the sole proprietor of J&C and took over the conduct of MC 288 and DC 2679.', '8\\u2003DC 2679 had been commenced by the complainant\u2019s former solicitors on 9 September 2015. The complainant obtained interlocutory judgment with liability fixed at 100% against the defendant in DC 2679 on 25 November 2015. The respondent was engaged primarily to see to the assessment of damages stage of DC 2679. On 17 March 2016, the solicitors for the defendant in DC 2679, United Legal Alliance LLC (\u201cULA\u201d), served a list of requests on the complainant seeking to determine, among other things, whether the complainant had been involved in any other road accidents apart from the accident on 12 November 2012.', '9\\u2003On 2 May 2016, the respondent filed a Notice of Change of Solicitor to formally take over the carriage of DC 2679 from the complainant\u2019s former solicitors.

At the time, the respondent was already in possession of documents that had been handed over by the complainant\u2019s former solicitors, at least some of which would have been relevant to the Discovery Request.', '11\\u2003On 27 June 2016, the complainant attended at the respondent\u2019s office and provided the respondent with his CPF statements for the period from January 2012 to May 2016, his IRAS notices of assessments for the financial years from 2010 to 2015 and the signed clinical abstract form, to enable the respondent to reply, at least in part, to the Discovery Request. On 30 June 2016, the complainant followed up with an email to the respondent pertaining to the Discovery Request stating:', '12\\u2003As the respondent did not respond to the Discovery Request, ULA sent another letter on 17 August 2016 requesting that the same be complied with by 19 August 2016 failing which ULA would file the necessary application.

On 4 October 2016, the District Court granted the orders sought in SUM 2793. By DC\/ORC 3529\/2016, the complainant was ordered to produce, among other things, the documents requested in SUM 2793 by 28 October 2016 and to pay costs fixed at $400 for SUM 2793 (the \u201cDiscovery Order\u201d). Although the respondent attended the hearing of SUM 2793, he did not take any steps to comply with the Discovery Order. He also did not inform the complainant that an application had been made or that an order had ensued against the complainant.', '14\\u2003On 31 October 2016, ULA sent a letter to the respondent noting that it had not heard from him. ULA stated that the respondent should disclose the required documents on or before 7 November 2016 failing which it would proceed to file the necessary application.', '15\\u2003On 8 November 2016, ULA took out DC\/SUM 3586\/2016 (\u201cSUM 3586\u201d), an application for an order that DC 2679 be struck out unless the Discovery Order was complied with. On 13 December 2016, the District Court granted the orders sought. By DC\/ORC 94\/2017, the complainant was ordered to comply with the Discovery Order by 10 January 2017 failing which DC 2679 would be struck out and the complainant was to pay costs fixed at $300 (\u201cUnless Order\u201d). Again, while the respondent attended the hearing of SUM 3586, he failed to comply with the Discovery Order. He also did not inform the complainant either that such an application had been made or that an order in these terms had been issued against the complainant.', '16\\u2003As the Unless Order was not complied with, DC 2679 was struck out on 20 January 2017. The complainant\u2019s case was that he had not received any update from the respondent in relation to the Discovery Request or any advice in relation to the progress of DC 2679 after he sent the 30 June 2016 email (above at [11]). As he was dissatisfied with the manner in which the respondent had been handling DC 2679, he approached Mr Lee Cheong Hoh (\u201cMr Lee\u201d) from M\/s Cheonghoh Law Corporation to take over the conduct of DC 2679. Mr Lee subsequently informed the complainant that DC 2679 had been struck out and eventually declined to take over conduct of DC 2679 on 8 February 2017 because he was not comfortable with the organisation of the documents handed over by the respondent in relation to DC 2679.', '17\\u2003The complainant then confirmed with Ms Cheng that DC 2679 had indeed been struck out, and met the respondent at the respondent\u2019s office sometime in February 2017 when the respondent informed him that he would try to solve the problem and reinstate DC 2679.', '18\\u2003As the complainant did not receive any further updates, he went to the respondent\u2019s office on 20 February 2017 to speak to him. However, the respondent was not in his office. The complainant then sent an email to the respondent recording the fact that he had gone to the respondent\u2019s office that morning and that the respondent was not in office. The complainant further requested that the respondent \u201clet [him] know the progress & status to reinstate [DC 2679] ASAP\u201d and to reply to his email at the soonest.', '19\\u2003DC 2679 was never restored, and no attempts were in fact made by the respondent to do so. As we noted earlier at [2], the complainant\u2019s claim for personal injury for the accident which took place on 12 November 2012 was time-barred at the time DC 2679 was struck out on 20 January 2017.', '20\\u2003On 22 March 2019, the complainant filed DC\/DC 873\/2019 (\u201cDC 873\u201d) against the respondent arising from the latter\u2019s negligence in his handling of DC 2679. On 9 January 2020, at the hearing of the complainant\u2019s summary judgment application against the respondent in DC 873, the respondent appeared in person. The District Court entered interlocutory judgment against the respondent for damages and costs to be assessed, and judgment for certain liquidated sums. The respondent\u2019s appeal was dismissed by the High Court on 3 March 2020.', '21\\u2003On 14 September 2021, the District Court adjudged the respondent liable to pay the complainant damages of $72,879.03 with costs fixed at $15,000 and disbursements to be agreed or taxed.

The Defendants had notice of the hearing but were unrepresented and were absent. I declined to enter judgment in default of defence and directed the plaintiff to apply inter partes to enter judgment on admissions of fact under O 27 r 3 instead. My reasons for doing so are set out at [137]\u2013[146] below. The hearing was accordingly adjourned.', '20\\u2003In early February 2020, the plaintiff filed its application under O 27 r 3. The plaintiff\u2019s O 19 and O 27 applications came up for hearing together before me in March 2020. Once again, the Defendants had notice of the hearing but were unrepresented and absent.', '21\\u2003At that hearing, I entered judgment in favour of the plaintiff and against the Defendants on the plaintiff\u2019s O 27 application. I also granted the plaintiff leave to withdraw its O 19 application with no order as to costs.', '22\\u2003The Judgment which I entered was in the following terms:', '(a)\\u2003I adjudged the first defendant liable to account to the plaintiff for and to pay to the plaintiff A$6.6m and PGK 1.7m together with simple interest on those sums at the rate of 5.33% per annum from the date of the writ to the date of judgment.', '(b)\\u2003I adjudged the plaintiff entitled to trace the sums under paragraph (a) above into any property, real or immovable, which the first defendant acquired using any part of the said sums.', '(c)\\u2003I adjudged the second and fourth defendants jointly and severally liable to pay the plaintiff the sum of A$0.4m together with simple interest on that sum at the rate of 5.33% per annum from the date of the writ to the date of judgment.', '(d)\\u2003I ordered the Defendants to pay to the plaintiff the costs of and incidental to this action, including but not limited to the costs of the O 27 application, which I fixed at $25,000 including disbursements.', 'This is the Judgment which the first defendant now seeks to set aside.', '23\\u2003I make three points about the procedural nature of the Judgment.', '24\\u2003First, the Judgment is a regular judgment. The first defendant accepts this point. 26', 'He therefore accepts that the plaintiff complied with all of the applicable provisions of the Rules in applying for and entering the Judgment. There is therefore no basis to set this judgment aside under O 2 r 1(2) on grounds of procedural irregularity.', '25\\u2003Second, the Judgment is a final judgment. I entered the Judgment under O 27 r 3. That rule gives the court the power to enter judgment summarily (ie, without a trial) upon a party\u2019s \u201cclear admission of facts in the face of which it is impossible for the party making it to succeed\u201d (Ellis v Allen [1914] 1 Ch D 904 at 909). Order 27 r 3 provides as follows:', '26\\u2003Judgment is entered under O 27 r 3 on the basis that the defendant has admitted that the facts relating to his liability are not in issue. The court is therefore entitled to enter judgment without having to make any findings of fact (Shunmugam Jayakumar and others v Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin and others [1996] 2 SLR(R) 658 at [35]). The purpose of allowing a plaintiff to enter judgment on admission of facts is to save time and costs (Cove Development Pte Ltd v Ideal Accommodation (Singapore) Pte Ltd [2009] SGHC 167 at [13]; Singapore Civil Procedure 2021 vol 1 (Cavinder Bull gen ed) (Sweet & Maxwell, 2021) at para 27\/0\/2).', '27\\u2003Third, the Judgment is a judgment on the merits. It is true that the Defendants failed to file a defence to the plaintiff\u2019s claim. It is also true that the Defendants were absent at the hearing of the plaintiff\u2019s O 27 application. But it would be wrong to characterise a judgment under O 27 r 3 as a default judgment. A default judgment is one entered purely by reason of a procedural default such as a failure to file a defence. A judgment entered under O 27 r 3 is entered after a consideration of the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s case in light of the defendant\u2019s admission of facts. I put it to the first defendant\u2019s counsel in the course of arguments that O 27 r 3 requires the court to consider the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s claim before it enters judgment. Counsel quite rightly conceded that that is correct. 27', '28\\u2003Indeed, on an application under O 27 r 3, the plaintiff must satisfy the court that the facts which the defendant has admitted establish all the elements of the plaintiff\u2019s pleaded cause of action, failing which the court will refuse to enter judgment under O 27 r 3 (Mycitydeal Ltd v Villas International Property Pte Ltd [2014] 4 SLR 1077 at [69]). It is thus open to the court to decline to enter judgment under O 27 r 3 on the basis that the plaintiff is not entitled to judgment, even on the facts as admitted by the defendant. Furthermore, it is open to a court hearing an application under O 27 r 3 to enter judgment in the plaintiff\u2019s favour on the basis of the admissions, but to reject or modify some of the heads of relief which the plaintiff claims. The court has that power whether the admissions are historical admissions or are made in the course of the proceedings. It also has that power whether the admissions are made expressly or are deemed by the Rules to have been made.', '29\\u2003The admissions on which the plaintiff relied on its O 27 application were deemed admissions. Under O 18 r 13, the Defendants\u2019 failure to traverse the facts alleged in the plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim constituted a deemed admission of those facts (see Zulkifli Baharudin v Koh Lam Son [1999] 2 SLR(R) 369). I entered the Judgment because, in light of those deemed admissions, the plaintiff satisfied me that it had established all of the elements of the causes of action it had pleaded against the Defendants and that it was entitled to enter judgment against the Defendants in terms of the prayers in its O 27 application.', '30\\u2003I reiterate that the Judgment was a regular judgment, a final judgment and a judgment entered against the first defendant on the merits. It was not a judgment entered upon a default, nor was it in any sense a judgment entered only provisionally. The Judgment adjudicated the plaintiff\u2019s claim against the Defendants and rendered the subject matter of this action res judicata, at least in Singapore (see Neptune Capital Group Ltd and others v Sunmax Global Capital Fund 1 Pte Ltd and another [2016] 4 SLR 1177 at [50]).', '31\\u2003In August 2021, the first defendant applied to set the Judgment aside as against him. That was over 16 months after I had entered the Judgment and after the first defendant had become aware of the Judgment (see [159]\u2013[160] below).', '32\\u2003The second and fourth defendants have not applied to set aside the Judgment as against them.'"}

In 2010, the second defendant pronounced a first talak on the first defendant. 9', 'In 2013, while the second defendant was still married to the first defendant, he entered into what is described as an \u201cunregistered marriage\u201d with the plaintiff. 10', 'I take that to mean that they entered into a relationship akin to marriage which was not recognised as a marriage under their personal law.', '8\\u2003In 2019, after the defendants\u2019 divorce, the second defendant and the plaintiff \u201cregistered their marriage\u201d. 11', 'I take that to mean that they entered into a relationship of marriage which is recognised under their personal law.', '9\\u2003All three parties are employees of the HDB. Further, the plaintiff and the first defendant have known each other since at least 2015. 12', 'The plaintiff and the first defendant are therefore known to each other as colleagues and acquaintances. 13', '10\\u2003In early 2015, the plaintiff came into a substantial sum of money from two sources. First, she realised a profit of a little over $163,000 when she sold her own HDB flat. 14', 'Second, she withdrew a lump sum from her CPF account. 15', '11\\u2003Knowing this, 16', 'the second defendant told the plaintiff: 17', '(a) that the defendants had fallen into arrears in servicing the HDB Loan on the Flat; and (b) that he intended to buy the first defendant\u2019s interest in the Flat from her, thereby making him the Flat\u2019s sole owner. He asked the plaintiff to hand him enough money, in the plaintiff\u2019s own words, \u201cto allow him to deposit the same into the 1st Defendant\u2019s CPF funds such as to allow the 2nd Defendant to buy over the Flat\u201d. 18', 'The plaintiff agreed to hand $205,359.80 to the second defendant for this purpose. 19', '12\\u2003I use the neutral verb \u201chand\u201d rather than \u201cgive\u201d so as not to imply that the plaintiff made a gift of the money to the second defendant. Whether she did so is an issue in contention on this application.', '13\\u2003The plaintiff handed the money to the second defendant in two tranches, on both occasions at the second defendant\u2019s request.', '14\\u2003First, in February 2015, the plaintiff procured a cheque in the sum of $7,256.68 drawn in favour of \u201cCPF\u201d and handed it to the second defendant. 20', 'The second defendant in turn handed the cheque to the first defendant. He instructed her to deposit it into her CPF account. 21', 'She did so, for the further credit of her CPF special account. 22', '15\\u2003Second, in March 2015, the plaintiff procured a DBS cashier\u2019s order in the sum of $198,103.12 drawn in favour of \u201cCPF BOARD\u201d 23', 'and handed it to the second defendant. Once again, the second defendant handed the cashier\u2019s order to the first defendant and instructed her to deposit it into her CPF account. 24', 'But this time, she did not do so immediately. In April 2015, the second defendant completed and presented to the first defendant the CPF form necessary for the deposit. He instructed her again to deposit the cashier\u2019s order into her CPF account. This time, she did so, to the further credit of her CPF ordinary account. 25', '16\\u2003This total sum of $205,359.80 is what the plaintiff now seeks to recover from the defendants.', '17\\u2003I should mention two minor points at this stage.', '18\\u2003First, the cheque which the plaintiff handed to the second defendant in February 2015 was not drawn on an account in the plaintiff\u2019s name. It was instead drawn on an account in the name of a company. 26', 'The evidence does not make clear the plaintiff\u2019s connection to the company. Nevertheless, the parties have treated the cheque and its proceeds as the plaintiff\u2019s property for all purposes. I shall do the same.', '19\\u2003Second, the parties consistently but incorrectly refer to the cheque and the cashier\u2019s order collectively as two cashier\u2019s orders. 27', 'Nothing turns on whether the instrument which the plaintiff handed the second defendant in February 2015 was a cheque or a cashier\u2019s order. For continuity and ease of exposition, therefore, I too will refer to these two instruments collectively as two cashier\u2019s orders.', '20\\u2003After paying the two cashier\u2019s orders into her CPF account, the first defendant carried out two transactions. 28', 'First, in September 2015, she withdrew $125,717.15 from her CPF ordinary account in order to repay the HDB Loan in full. 29', 'The result was the total discharge of the HDB\u2019s charge on the Flat. Second, in February 2016, she transferred $30,002.68 from her CPF ordinary account to her CPF investment account. 30', '21\\u2003On the evidence before me, the first defendant withdrew no funds from her CPF account other than the sum of $125,717.15 paid to the HDB in September 2015. It therefore appears that, out of the $205,359.80 which the plaintiff handed to the second defendant, a notional $79,642.65 remains in the first defendant\u2019s CPF account. That sum comprises: (a) $7,256.68 which remains in the first defendant\u2019s CPF special account (see [14] above); (b) $30,002.68 which remains in her CPF investment account (see [20] above); and (c) $42,383.29 which remains in her CPF ordinary account (being $205,359.80 less the sums of $7,256.68, $125,717.15 and $30,002.68). These figures ignore the interest which will have accrued on these sums since 2015.', '22\\u2003At some time in 2016, the plaintiff\u2019s brothers visited the Flat demanding to see the second defendant. Their intention was to recover $205,359.80 from him. The second defendant was not present at the Flat. The first defendant was.', '23\\u2003As a result of this visit, the first defendant questioned the second defendant about the source of the two cashier\u2019s orders. The first defendant\u2019s evidence is that it was only then that the second defendant revealed to her for the first time: (a) that the plaintiff was the ultimate source of the two cashier\u2019s orders; and (b) that he had entered into an unregistered marriage (see [7] above) with the plaintiff in 2013.', '24\\u2003The first defendant\u2019s evidence is that, as a result of these disclosures, she assumed that the plaintiff had made a gift of the two cashier\u2019s orders to the second defendant because he did not say anything to the contrary. 31', 'I accept the first defendant\u2019s evidence. The second defendant does not suggest that he told the first defendant anything about the origin of the two cashier\u2019s orders before 2016 and, in particular, at the time he handed them to her. Further, it would be natural for the first defendant to assume that the plaintiff, having entered into an unregistered marriage with the second defendant three years earlier, would as a result be prepared to make a gift of such a large sum to him.', '25\\u2003In May 2017, the first defendant commenced divorce proceedings against the second defendant in the Syariah Court. 32', 'In April 2018, at the first hearing of the divorce proceedings, the first defendant volunteered to the court that she had used money originating from the plaintiff to repay the HDB Loan in full. 33', 'The Syariah Court therefore held the divorce proceedings in abeyance to allow the plaintiff an opportunity to apply to intervene in the divorce proceedings and to assert a claim. 34', '26\\u2003In September 2018, the first defendant secured directions to permit the divorce proceedings to continue 35', 'on the basis that the plaintiff had failed to intervene in the divorce proceedings. The plaintiff\u2019s submission is that she had failed to do so simply because the first defendant failed to tell her about the Syariah Court\u2019s directions. 36', '27\\u2003In December 2018, the Syariah Court issued a divorce decree dissolving the defendants\u2019 marriage. 37', 'The decree included an order dividing the defendants\u2019 matrimonial property under s 52(3)(d) of the Administration of Muslim Law Act (Cap 3, 2009 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe AMLA\u201d).', '28\\u2003The property division order required the Flat be sold forthwith and awarded the first defendant 100% of the net proceeds of sale. 38', 'The order also awarded the first defendant $30,000 out of the $34,000 which the second defendant would have to repay to his CPF account out of the proceeds of sale (see [5] above). 39', '29\\u2003The property division order made no provision for the plaintiff. In particular, it took no account of the $205,359.80 which the second defendant had obtained from the plaintiff and handed to the first defendant or that part of it which the first defendant had used to repay the HDB Loan in full.', '30\\u2003That is not surprising. 40', 'The plaintiff herself had not intervened in the divorce proceedings and therefore had made no claim to any interest in the Flat. Further, the second defendant had filed no affidavits 41', 'and took no substantive part in the divorce proceedings. 42', 'He also failed to attend, whether by counsel or in person, the hearings at which the divorce decree was issued, and the property division order was made. 43', '31\\u2003The second defendant took this approach in the divorce proceedings even though he had, by then, entered into an unregistered marriage (see [7] above) with the plaintiff. He would therefore be expected to have had a natural incentive to protect if not advance the plaintiff\u2019s interests over the first defendant\u2019s interests. Despite this, the second defendant supplied no evidence and made no submissions to the court about the legal consequences of the first defendant having used money which originated from the plaintiff to repay the HDB Loan in full.', '32\\u2003It was only when the second defendant learned of the terms of the property division order that he acted to protect and advance the plaintiff\u2019s interests. That was when he applied to the Syariah Court under s 52(6) of the AMLA to have the order varied in two material respects: 44', '(a) by ordering that the plaintiff be paid $205,359.80 plus interest out of the net proceeds of the sale of the Flat on the basis that she had a proprietary interest in the Flat; 45', '(b) and by ordering that the second defendant be paid 15% of the net proceeds of sale by virtue of his contribution to the down payment (see [5] above). 46', '33\\u2003At the same time, the second defendant asked the plaintiff to intervene in the divorce proceedings and assert her claim. 47', 'The plaintiff did so.', '34\\u2003In May 2019, the plaintiff secured leave with the defendants\u2019 consent to intervene in the divorce proceedings. 48', 'In her affidavit filed in May 2019, on legal advice, 49', 'she framed her claim as a proprietary claim arising from a direct contribution of $205,359.80 towards the acquisition of the Flat. By her calculations, $205,359.80 represented 47% of the combined direct contributions of all three parties towards the acquisition of the Flat. 50', 'But the plaintiff did not go so far as to ask the Syariah Court to award her 47% of the Flat\u2019s net proceeds of sale. Instead, she asked the court to order the first defendant to pay her $205,359.80 plus accrued interest out of the net proceeds of sale. 51', 'The plaintiff accepted that the first defendant was entitled to set off against this sum of $205,398.80 an unrelated debt of $11,888 which she admitted owing to the first defendant. 52', '35\\u2003The first defendant quite naturally resisted the second defendant\u2019s variation application. In May 2019, she filed an affidavit in support of her position. 53', 'In the affidavit, she accepted that she prima facie had an obligation to pay $205,359.80 to the plaintiff (see [123(d)] below). But at the same time, she claimed to be entitled to set off against the $205,359.80 certain debts which the second defendant allegedly owed her. Effecting that set off left her liable to pay only $53,653.80 to the plaintiff. The first defendant concluded her affidavit by confirming that she was prepared to pay the plaintiff $53,653.80 out of the Flat\u2019s net proceeds of sale, less a sum of $3,500 for legal costs which she claimed from the plaintiff. 54', '36\\u2003The plaintiff denied 55', 'and continues to deny 56', 'both: (a) that she is liable to the first defendant for any of the debts of the second defendant which the first defendant seeks to set off against the $205,359.80; and (b) that the first defendant has any legal basis to set these debts off against the sum of $205,359.80.', '37\\u2003In October 2019, the Syariah Court rendered its decision on the variation application. 57', 'The court agreed with the first defendant that the property division order should not be varied in so far as it related to the second defendant\u2019s rights (see [32] above). Thus, the first defendant remained entitled to 100% of the net proceeds of sale as against the second defendant.', '38\\u2003However, the Syariah Court agreed in part with both the second defendant and the plaintiff that the property division order should be varied in so far as it related to the plaintiff\u2019s rights. The court held that: (a) the first defendant had failed to show that the plaintiff was liable for any of debts which the first defendant claimed to be entitled to set off against the $205,359.80; (b) the first defendant would be unjustly enriched in the sum of $125,717.15 (see [20] above) if she did not account to the plaintiff for that sum out of the net proceeds of sale; and (c) the plaintiff\u2019s claims for the remainder of the $205,359.80 were unrelated to the Flat and would have to be decided by an ordinary civil claim in the ordinary civil courts rather than in matrimonial proceedings in the Syariah Court. 58', '39\\u2003The Syariah Court therefore ordered the first defendant to pay the plaintiff $138,917.15 out of the net proceeds of sale. 59', 'That figure represents only the sum which the first defendant used to repay the HDB loan, ie, $125,717.15 (see [20] above), plus $13,200 in accrued interest. 60', '40\\u2003The plaintiff appealed against the variation order to the Appeal Board constituted under the AMLA. Her case on appeal was that the court should have ordered that she be paid the sum of $205,359.80 in full out of the net proceeds of sale. 61', 'The plaintiff\u2019s case was that she had a proprietary interest worth $205,359.80 in the Flat. That meant that the Flat was, to that extent, no longer matrimonial property which the court had any power to divide between the first defendant and the second defendant upon divorce. 62', '41\\u2003The first defendant did not appeal against the variation order. She was prepared to pay the plaintiff $138,917.15 out of the net proceeds of sale as required by the varied property division order \u201cfor the sake of closure\u201d. 63', '42\\u2003In August 2020, the Appeal Board dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s appeal. 64', 'But the Appeal Board went on of its own motion to set aside the variation order. The result of the Appeal Board\u2019s decision was to restore the original property division order (see [27]\u2013[29] above). Therefore, even though the first defendant had chosen not to appeal against the variation order, she found herself no longer under any obligation to pay any part of the Flat\u2019s net proceeds of sale to the plaintiff. 65', '43\\u2003The Appeal Board arrived at its decision by analogy with the decision of the Court of Appeal in UDA v UDB and another [2018] 1 SLR 1015. In brief, the Appeal Board held that a Syariah Court does not have jurisdiction to vary a property division order in favour of non-party to the marriage (in this case, the plaintiff). The Appeal Board rested its decision on two grounds. First, a Syariah Court, when exercising matrimonial jurisdiction under s 35(2) and s 52 of the AMLA, does not have personal jurisdiction or power to determine the substantive rights of a non-party to the marriage even if the non-party had obtained leave to intervene in the matrimonial proceedings. 66', 'Second, given that the foundation of the plaintiff\u2019s claim was a proprietary interest in the Flat to the extent of $205,359.80, that interest was not \u201cproperty\u201d within the meaning of s 52(14) of the AMLA and was therefore not susceptible to a Syariah Court\u2019s power to make orders for the disposition or division of \u201cproperty\u201d in the exercise of its matrimonial jurisdiction under s 52(3) of the AMLA. 67', '44\\u2003The Appeal Board expressly stated that its decision was simply that the plaintiff had asserted her claim in the wrong court and not that her claim lacked merit. As a result, the Appeal Board said that nothing in its decision precluded her from vindicating her claim for $205,359.80 in full through an ordinary civil claim in the ordinary civil courts.', '45\\u2003Taking her cue from the Appeal Board, the plaintiff commenced these proceedings in October 2020, claiming $205,359.80 in full from one or both of the defendants.', '46\\u2003The property division order remains in force to this day. But it has yet to be implemented. The Flat has yet to be sold. The defendants continue to co-own it as joint tenants. The first defendant continues to live in the Flat together with one of the defendants\u2019 three children. 68', 'The Flat\u2019s estimated value is now between $350,000 and $438,000. 69'"}

For present purposes, it suffices to note the following. \n5 The respondent was employed by Chye Joo Marine Pte Ltd since 6 May \n2013 to perform grit blasting and painting works at a shipyard (\u201cthe Shipyard\u201d). \nIn this connection, he operated forklifts and supervised the work of other \nworkers.  \n6 On 26 May 2019, six employees \u2013 including the respondent, \nShanmugam and the deceased \u2013 were assigned to work at the Shipyard. The \nteam began spray painting a vessel at about 9.00am. At about 3.00pm, the \nrespondent sought permission from one Velu Prakashraj (\u201cVelu\u201d), employee of \nAsia-Pacific Shipyard Pte Ltd (the operator of the Shipyard) (\u201cAPS\u201d) to use a \nforklift (which was distinct from the K Forklift) (\u201cthe M Forklift\u201d). Velu \nallowed the respondent to use the M Forklift as he knew the respondent was a \ncertified forklift operator but cautioned the respondent that the brakes of the M \nForklift were not effective. \n7 Separately, at about 5.00pm, the respondent wanted to seek permission \nto use the K Forklift (which similarly had faulty brakes). However, as none of \nthe APS employees were present at the Shipyard and the respondent knew that \nhe could start the engine to the K Forklift without an ignition key, he used his \nlocker key to ignite and operate the K Forklift. \nVersion No 2: 16 Aug 2022 (12:07 hrs)\nPP v Yeduvaka Mali Naidu[2022] SGHC 191\n38 The respondent and Shanmugam subsequently used the K Forklift to \ntransfer spray painting equipment.

{"casename":"2022_SGHC_192","fact":"'4\\u2003I begin with a summary of the findings of fact by the DJ, which form the background to the matter. On or around 13 December 2012, the respondent, Ms Wang Jian, purchased 360,000 shares in NSC Executive Centre Pte Ltd (\u201cNSC Executive Centre\u201d), which was 30% of the issued shares of the company. The company had an issued share capital and paid-up capital of $1,200,000. 1', 'The respondent had purchased the shares from Lu Jinyang (\u201cLu\u201d), an existing shareholder, and they concluded a share transfer form dated 13 December 2012 (the \u201c2012 Share Transfer Form\u201d). 2', 'While the consideration for the Shares was stated in the 2012 Share Transfer Form to be $216,315, the respondent claimed that it was in fact $400,000. The DJ preferred the respondent\u2019s account on the amount paid for the Shares. I agree with the DJ\u2019s finding in this regard. Nonetheless, the present appeal does not turn on whether the agreed consideration was $216,315 or $400,000. The broader point is that the respondent had purchased the Shares for a substantial sum \u2013 far more than the nominal $1 she was later alleged to have transferred the Shares to the appellant for.', '5\\u2003Following this purchase, the respondent was appointed a director of NSC Executive Centre on 13 December 2012. She remained a shareholder and a director of NSC Capital Pte Ltd (\u201cNSC Capital\u201d) when NSC Executive Centre was renamed NSC Capital on 11 May 2018.', '6\\u2003The first material event in the present dispute occurred in November 2018. At or around that time, the respondent ceased to be a shareholder of NSC Capital when she transferred the Shares in NSC Capital to the appellant, Chan Tam Hoi @ Paul Chan, on 21 November 2018. Similar to how the respondent acquired the Shares in 2012, the parties signed a share transfer form. The consideration for the transfer was reflected as a mere $1 on the share transfer form dated 21 November 2018 (the \u201c2018 Share Transfer Form\u201d). 3', 'The respondent also resigned and ceased to be a director of NSC Capital with effect from the same date. 4', '7\\u2003The appellant then became the sole director of NSC Capital on 21 November 2018 when the other directors also resigned as directors. At present, the appellant is the majority shareholder of NSC Capital with 55% shareholding. There are two other shareholders.', '8\\u2003The second material event in the present dispute occurred on 30 January 2019. At about 5pm on 30 January 2019, the respondent\u2019s father, Mr Wang Bin (\u201cMr Wang\u201d), appeared at NSC Capital\u2019s premises. The respondent was already there. It is undisputed that the appellant executed a letter dated 30 January 2019 which had been printed on NSC Capital\u2019s letterhead and bore its company stamp. This letter, which was addressed to the respondent, contained the following statement: \u201cWe will buy back the 30% of your investment in NSC Capital for the amount of SGD $467,165.00\u201d. This letter was executed by the respondent on behalf of NSC Capital.', '9\\u2003This, however, was not the end of the matter. On the very next day, 31 January 2019, the respondent and Mr Wang turned up at NSC Capital\u2019s premises again. They procured the appellant\u2019s signature on a revised version of the letter dated 30 January 2019 that the respondent had prepared. This revised letter, which was also dated 30 January 2019, was addressed to the respondent and contained the following statements: \u201cWe will buy back the 30% of your investment in NSC Capital for the amount of SGD $467,165.00\u201d and \u201cThe funds will be returned to your account (DBS Bank account: [redacted]) between today and the expiry date of your Visa in Singapore\u201d. 5', 'As the DJ noted, this second letter is substantively identical to the first letter except that it contained the account details to which the $467,165 was to be transferred to and a timeframe for payment to be made. This second letter was similarly executed by the appellant on behalf of NSC Capital. For convenience, I will refer to both letters collectively as the \u201c30 January 2019 Letter\u201d. Nothing in the present appeal turns on whether I am referring specifically to the original version signed on 30 January 2019, or the later revised version signed on 31 January 2019.', '10\\u2003Notwithstanding the execution of the 30 January 2019 Letter and the transfer of the Shares to the appellant, neither the appellant nor NSC Capital paid the sum of $467,165 to the respondent.

The cases interpreting s 211B of the Companies Act continue to be applicable to s 64 of the Act. IM Skaugen, in particular, gives guidance on the approach to be taken.

The Court does not take a vote at this time, but takes a broad assessment bearing in mind the quality of creditor support, particularly from significant or crucial creditors: [48]\u2013[58] of IM Skaugen.

According to V4\u2019s mother, V4 was closer to the accused than she was to her biological father. 24', 'The accused committed various sexual offences against V4 from 2006 to 2007, including taking obscene photographs of V4, outraging V4\u2019s modesty by rubbing his penis against V4\u2019s exposed vagina, and raping V4 on four occasions. 25', '13\\u2003On 12 February 2007 at about 2.44pm, when the accused was alone with V4 in the children\u2019s room at V4\u2019s residence, 26', 'he had sexual intercourse with V4 without her consent. 27', 'The accused undressed V4, instructed her to lie on the bed face up, pried open her vagina with his fingers and intentionally penetrated V4\u2019s vagina with his penis while pushing his body against her in a humping motion. 28', 'When V4 protested, the accused warned her to behave. Thereafter, the accused climbed on top of V4 and rubbed his penis against the exterior of V4\u2019s vagina violently. In the course of this incident, the accused penetrated V4\u2019s vagina a total of six times. The accused also rubbed his penis against V4\u2019s vagina, licked V4\u2019s vagina, and kissed V4 on her face, chest and lips. 29', 'When V4 started crying, the accused scolded her for acting up. 30', 'The accused recorded the entire incident with a video camera. The video clip lasted 22 minutes and 4 seconds, and the accused\u2019s offence took up about 15 minutes and 45 seconds of the video. 31', 'This incident formed the subject of the 52nd Charge.

He then proceeded to penetrate V4\u2019s vagina with his penis. 34', 'When the accused turned V4\u2019s body such that she was face down on the mattress, V4 cried and struggled, twitching her body from side to side. In response, the accused admonished her, and forcefully pinned her down as she tried to escape his grasp. He then lay on top of her and penetrated her vagina with his penis again. 35', 'The accused subsequently moved into a kneeling position and penetrated her vagina for a third time. At one juncture, when V4 tried to resist the accused, the accused forcibly pinned her down on the mattress and pushed himself against her even more violently. When V4 kicked her legs in the air, the accused turned himself and V4 to the left and penetrated her vagina with his penis once more while using both his legs to restrain V4 from kicking. 36', '15\\u2003The accused then positioned V4 on top of himself and penetrated her vagina with his penis a fifth time, before pushing her back onto the bed facing downwards and penetrating her vagina from behind a sixth time. 37', 'Finally, the accused turned V4\u2019s body around, spread her legs, and penetrated her for the seventh time.

Eventually, the accused approached V5\u2019s mother and offered to tutor V5, which V5\u2019s mother accepted. Outside of activities at the community centre, the accused frequently brought V5 to watch movies or play at the arcade. During these outings, the accused would often take V5 to a toilet to sexually abuse her, for instance, by forcing her to fellate him and ultimately raping her. The accused also sexually abused V5 at the dance studio of the community centre. 42', '18\\u2003Significantly, the accused placated V5 by buying her many gifts, including a computer.

He proceeded to force V5\u2019s vagina open and intentionally penetrated V5\u2019s vagina with his penis. 44', 'The accused then penetrated V5\u2019s mouth with his penis (which was the subject of one of the TIC Charges), before attempting to penetrate her vagina again. Thereafter, the accused manoeuvred V5\u2019s body into a kneeling position before rubbing the shaft of his penis against the opening of V5\u2019s anus. 45', 'The incident was recorded by the accused with a video camera, and based on the video recording, the offence lasted about 10 minutes and 30 seconds. 46', 'This incident formed the subject of the 57th Charge.

The accused instructed V5 to lie naked over a stack of blue foam padding in the dance studio of the community centre where he volunteered. He approached V5 from behind, pried open her vagina with his fingers and penetrated V5\u2019s vagina with his penis. Shortly after, the accused blindfolded V5 with a cloth and proceeded to rub his penis against V5\u2019s buttocks. 48', 'The accused then rubbed his penis against V5\u2019s vagina before inserting his penis into her mouth, and stopping to kiss her lips. 49', 'Finally, the accused spread V5\u2019s legs apart, and rubbed his penis against her vagina until he ejaculated on her vaginal region. 50', 'The accused recorded the incident with a video camera, and the offence lasted about 10 minutes. 51', 'This incident formed the subject of the 69th Charge. The accused did not wear a condom when committing the offence. 52', '21\\u2003On 3 June 2018, the complainant purchased a used laptop from the accused.

Those photographs and videos depicted the accused sexually assaulting various children. The complainant lodged a police report on 10 June 2018. 53', 'In a sense, the discovery of the accused\u2019s offences was highly fortuitous.

The coral reef which creates the atoll encloses a deep lagoon with an area of approximately 6km2. 1', 'Eauripik is a municipality of the island state of Yap, which in turn is part of four island states that make up the Federated States of Micronesia (\u201cFSM\u201d). The islands that make up the FSM, including Eauripik, are located in the Pacific Ocean close to the Marianas Trench where water depths can reach several thousand feet. The islands in the FSM including Eauripik are, some might say, home to some of the most biodiverse and beautiful coral reefs in the world. In the course of the proceedings before me, various epithets were used to describe the reef in question in Eauripik. For example, counsel for the plaintiffs, Mr Leong Kah Wah, described the reef as a \u201cNational Geographic standard\u201d reef. 2', 'I reproduce, at Annex 1 of this judgment, a selection of underwater photographs depicting sections of the reef located on the western leeward side of Eauripik (the \u201cReef\u201d).', '3\\u2003The Reef is characterised by a reef crest (or reef top) which slopes down seaward towards a reef wall. The reef wall extends downwards very steeply, in some parts almost vertically, to depths of at least 35m; 3', 'given where Eauripik is located, it is likely that the Reef wall extends downwards to depths far beyond those visible to the naked eye. According to the plaintiffs\u2019 expert, the Reef has exceptionally high biodiversity, high coral cover and high fish biomass. 4', '4\\u2003On 17 April 2017, the Liquefied Natural Gas carrier \u201cSEVILLA KNUTSEN\u201d (\u201cVessel\u201d), whilst in the course of her ocean passage, struck the west-facing leeward side of the Reef at several locations, causing damage to it (the \u201cIncident\u201d). Figure 2 below is a screenshot from aerial drone video footage taken some seven weeks after the Incident and gives some visual indication of the damage caused by the Vessel to the Reef. The damaged areas are visible as white \u201cscars\u201d appearing on the outline of the Reef, and are denoted by the red arrows. There were a total of ten scars caused by the Incident. Using Figure 1 above (at [1]) as a reference, the damage occurred at the west-facing edge of the Reef on the left side of the photograph.', '5\\u2003The plaintiffs in HC\/ADM 91\/2017 (\u201cADM 91\u201d) are Jesse Remalmog, John Haglelgam and Santus Sarongelfeg. Collectively, they are the traditional leaders, or Chiefs, of Eauripik and represent its people. ADM 91 is an admiralty action in rem brought by the plaintiffs against the defendant, the owner of the Vessel, seeking compensation as a result of the damage caused to the Reef by the Incident. It is accepted by the parties that (a) the law of FSM governs the plaintiffs\u2019 claim in tort, and (b) under FSM law, the plaintiffs as the traditional Chiefs of Eauripik possess the requisite standing to bring this action against the defendant in their representative capacities on behalf of the people of Eauripik.', '6\\u2003It is also common ground that (a) FSM law recognises a cause of action for damages in tort arising from negligent damage to a reef, and (b) that the people of Eauripik are entitled to sue (through their traditional Chiefs) based on a shared traditional and collective ownership right to use, and benefit from, the marine coral reef\u2019s natural resources. 5', '7\\u2003On 14 February 2019, the plaintiffs and the defendant entered into an agreement under O 70 r 34 of the Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed) (\u201cROC\u201d) to settle liability, which agreement was filed and accepted as an order of Court. Pursuant to that agreement, the defendant admitted 100% liability for the Incident. The hearing before me concerns a claim on reference brought pursuant to O 70 rr 40 and 41 of the ROC to assess the damages due to the plaintiffs as a result of the Incident.', '8\\u2003The issues that arise in this claim on reference are not particularly complex but they belie the gulf between the parties as to the appropriate level of compensation the plaintiffs are entitled to. To give a flavour of the extent of the divergence in the parties\u2019 positions, the plaintiffs seek an award of damages in the sum of approximately US$6.57m whereas the defendant contends that it should be no more than US$500,000. 6', '9\\u2003Before I turn to the main issues for determination, it would be useful to first summarise the somewhat unusual procedural history surrounding this dispute which, by reason of the course it took, has resulted in this court deciding a claim for the people of Eauripik for tortious compensation, under FSM law, that has no connection to Singapore other than the fact that the Vessel was arrested by the plaintiffs here.', '10\\u2003On 23 June 2017, the plaintiffs commenced ADM 91 and arrested the Vessel in Singapore. The Vessel was released on 27 June 2017 after the defendant provided security, under protest, by way of a letter of undertaking (\u201cLOU\u201d) from its Protection and Indemnity insurers (\u201cP&I Club\u201d) in the sum of US$9,247,220 (inclusive of interest and costs).', '11\\u2003On 13 July 2017, the plaintiffs filed HC\/SUM 3223\/2017 (\u201cSUM 3223\u201d) seeking an order to stay their own action in ADM 91 in favour of the FSM on the grounds of forum non conveniens. In response, the defendant commenced proceedings against the plaintiffs in the English courts seeking an anti-suit injunction against the plaintiffs to prevent the commencement or prosecution of legal proceedings in respect of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim otherwise than before this court; the basis of the defendant\u2019s application was that the LOU by its terms required the plaintiffs to only prosecute their claim in this court. An interim, and subsequently final, anti-suit injunction was granted by the English court in favour of the defendant. The English court also made a costs order in the defendant\u2019s favour for the sum of \u00a351,830 (the \u201cUK Costs Order\u201d). On 13 February 2019, an assistant registrar of the Supreme Court of Singapore ordered, pursuant to O 14 r 5 of the ROC, that judgment be entered for the defendant against the plaintiffs on its counterclaim for the UK Costs Order (with interest at 8% per annum calculated from 6 February 2018 until payment of the principal sum) and costs of $6,000 (the \u201cCounterclaim Judgment\u201d).', '12\\u2003As a consequence of the English court\u2019s anti-suit injunction against the plaintiffs, the plaintiffs decided to withdraw their stay application in SUM 3223 and were granted leave to do so on 27 October 2017. Thus, ADM 91 would continue on its course.', '13\\u2003 On 22 January 2018, the defendant requested for the plaintiffs\u2019 agreement to a moderation of the amount of security that had been furnished.

The offer was expressed to be an open global offer and the defendant expressly reserved its right to seek indemnity costs against the plaintiffs under O 59 of the ROC. On the first day of the hearing, the letter was brought to my attention, the fact of the offer having been made was placed on the record and the letter was marked as a defendant\u2019s exhibit. The offer was not accepted by the plaintiffs and the hearing continued.', '16\\u2003On the first day of the expert witnesses\u2019 evidence, which was given by way of an expert witness conference, it transpired that the plaintiffs intended to put forward a revised set of measurements on the area of damage caused by the Incident and to adduce supplemental evidence from the plaintiffs\u2019 expert to support the revised measurements. It was eventually agreed that pending the plaintiffs formally amending their pleadings and adducing further evidence in support of their amended case, and the defendant responding accordingly, the evidence of the expert witnesses on, inter alia, the issue of the extent of damage to the Reef would be postponed and further hearing dates fixed after matters had been regularised. 7', 'In the meantime, the hearing continued but the experts limited their evidence to issues pertaining to the nature of the Reef and its characteristics. The plaintiffs subsequently obtained leave to amend their Claim on Reference and to adduce further evidence from their experts, with the defendant being given consequential leave to file an amended Defence to Claim on Reference and responsive expert evidence. The second tranche of the hearing took place on 18 and 19 March 2021 and the experts gave their evidence on the remaining issues that had been held over from the first tranche.'"}

In 2017, Enjin changed strategy and focused instead on developing a proprietary blockchain technology for software developers. Their technology allowed software developers to integrate digital tokens within their games, applications and other programs. Enjin began issuing a digital token called \u201cENJ Coin\u201d (\u201cENJ\u201d) which was based on the Ethereum network. 10', 'ENJ is a utility token that can be used to create digital assets. There is a fixed amount of ENJ because there is no way to create new ENJ. Therefore, using ENJ to create digital assets gives the asset scarcity and value. In late 2017, through an Initial Coin Offering (\u201cICO\u201d), Enjin created 1bn ENJ and sold around 700m ENJ to the public to raise capital. 11', '6\\u2003During the ICO, around 260m ENJ was retained by Enjin, out of which around 30m to 50m was set aside for Enjin employees. 12', 'This is because Enjin paid some performance bonuses in ENJ. 13', 'Out of the total sum set aside for employees, Mr Blagov and Mr Radomski set aside individual amounts of ENJ for some of their employees, including Ms Pritchard. Around the time of the ICO, 6m ENJ was set aside for Ms Pritchard, as reflected in an Excel spreadsheet that was tendered in evidence 14', 'and which I will refer to as the \u201cENJ allocation spreadsheet\u201d. A key point of dispute in this suit is the legal significance of setting aside this figure \u2013 whether it was a provisional, earmarked figure that was subject to change at the discretion of Mr Blagov and Mr Radomski, or a final and irrevocable award. Before coming to a conclusion on that issue, I will simply refer to the sum of 6m ENJ neutrally as having been \u201cset aside for\u201d or \u201callocated to\u201d Ms Pritchard in late 2017.', '7\\u2003In March 2019, 3m ENJ, out of the 6m ENJ set aside for her, was paid to Ms Pritchard in the form of USD$300,000 (its value at the time). 15', '8\\u2003Around the time of the ICO, Ms Pritchard was formally appointed COO of Enjin. 16', 'In February 2019, Ms Pritchard was given the role of CFO of Enjin.

They told her that none of the other employees had received the \u201cfull amount\u201d. 20', 'Sometime in February 2020 after this conversation, Ms Pritchard was awarded 500,000 ENJ. 21', '11\\u2003On 20 April 2020, Ms Pritchard told Mr Blagov and Mr Radomski in a Slack conversation that she wanted the remaining 2.5m ENJ that was due to her to be paid in either cash or Bitcoin. Mr Blagov responded that they needed to have a meeting to discuss \u201ceverything\u201d. Ms Pritchard objected and said that no meeting was necessary. 22', 'From this exchange, Mr Blagov became concerned that Ms Pritchard might use her access to Enjin\u2019s financial accounts to pay her bonus to herself. 23', 'He therefore took precautionary measures to prevent this. He called Standard Chartered Bank (\u201cSCB\u201d) to instruct them to cancel the digital bank tokens which were in Ms Pritchard\u2019s possession. 24', 'He also changed the passwords on some of Enjin\u2019s other payment accounts. 25', '12\\u2003The next day, he asked Ms Pritchard to return the device tokens and other Enjin paperwork because he assumed that she did not to intend to continue working at Enjin.

On 22 April 2020 at 7.48 am, Mr Blagov told her that the tokens needed to be in the director\u2019s possession, and that there needed to be a discussion so that they could move forward.

{"casename":"2022_SGHC_204","fact":"Background facts\n3 The appellant was imprisoned for an unrelated offence between July and \nSeptember 2018. Therein, he became acquainted with one Eric. Upon his release \nfrom incarceration, the appellant informed Eric that he needed money. In turn, \nEric offered him \u201ceasy money\u201d in consideration of the appellant signing tenancy \nagreements for properties intended to house KTV workers. The appellant took \nup Eric\u2019s offer.1 \n4 Acting on Eric\u2019s instructions, the appellant contacted one Joanne, a \nproperty agent, and expressed his interest in renting an apartment (\u201cthe Unit\u201d). \nHe informed Joanne that he was in \u201cthe business of fitness equipment\u201d and \nwould be occupying the Unit with two co-tenants. The appellant obtained the \nNRIC of his two putative co-tenants from Eric and furnished these details to \nJoanne.2 \n5 On 31 January 2019, the appellant entered into a tenancy agreement with \nMvjestic Holdings Pte Ltd (\u201cthe Landlord\u201d) in respect of the Unit (\u201cthe First \nTenancy Agreement\u201d). The First Tenancy Agreement spanned 12 months and \nstipulated that rent was payable at $3,200 per month. In entering the First \nTenancy Agreement, the appellant deceived the Landlord into believing that (a) \nhe, along with his co-tenants, would be tenants of the Unit; and (b) he would \nobserve all the covenants of the First Tenancy Agreement, including not to use \n1 Statement of Facts (\u201cSOF\u201d) at [2]\u2013[3] (Record of Proceedings (\u201cROP\u201d) at p 6). \n2 SOF at [4]\u2013[6] (ROP at pp 6\u20137).\nVersion No 2: 25 Aug 2022 (12:38 hrs)\nWoo Haw Ming v PP [2022] SGHC 204\n3the Unit for any illegal purpose and not to part with possession of the Unit \nwithout the Landlord\u2019s written consent.3\n6 Eric instructed the appellant to leave the keys to the Unit and the tenancy \ndocuments on a table in the Unit. The appellant complied and additionally, left \nthe door to the Unit unlocked. Neither he nor his co-tenants occupied the Unit \nat any point in time. The appellant was paid $100 for performing the acts \noutlined at [ 4] to [ 6] (which formed the subject of the First Charge).4 \n7 Sometime before 4 December 2019, Eric instructed the appellant to \nrenew the First Tenancy Agreement. The appellant thus entered into a second \n12-month tenancy agreement with the Landlord, which began on 31 January \n2020 at the prevailing rent of $3,200 (\u201cthe Second Tenancy Agreement\u201d). \nAgain, in so doing, the appellant deceived the Landlord into believing that, \ntogether with his co-tenants, he would occupy the Unit and observe the \nassociated covenants.5 The appellant was, however, not paid for his acts in \nrelation to the Second Tenancy Agreement.6\n8 Subsequently, on 26 December 2019, police officers raided the Unit and \narrested three female subjects for offences under the Women\u2019s Charter (Cap \n353, 2009 Rev Ed).

Offence-specific factors that \nwent towards harm included the \u201c[f]rustration of government regulations\u201d, \n\u201c[p]ublic policy considerations\u201d, \u201c[d]ifficulty in detection\u201d and the \n\u201c[p]revalence of paper tenancy offences\u201d. Offence-specific factors that were \nrelevant to an offender\u2019s culpability spanned an offender\u2019s knowledge of the \nillicit nature of \u201cpaper tenancies\u201d, the number of properties involved, the \nduration of offending and the offender\u2019s role. As for offender-specific factors, \naggravating elements included offences that were TIC for the purpose of \nsentencing and an offender\u2019s history of offending while mitigating factors \nincluded a plea of guilt and co-operation with the authorities.9 \n11 In dealing with the offence-specific factors, the DJ noted that the \nappellant\u2019s offences: (a) frustrated the regulatory framework aimed at \n\u201cpolic[ing] the type of activities that [went] on at private residences behind \nclosed doors\u201d as well as the public interest in upholding public decency in the \ncommunity; (b) were part of a \u201cwell-orchestrated operation\u201d; (c) were difficult \nto detect; and (d) were an example of increasingly prevalent \u201cpaper tenancy \n8 GD at [32] (ROP at p 66).\n9 GD at [33] (ROP at p 67). \nVersion No 2: 25 Aug 2022 (12:38 hrs)\nWoo Haw Ming v PP [2022] SGHC 204\n5offences\u201d.10 The DJ also found that the appellant had some awareness that the \nUnit would be used for illegal activities. Whilst the Defence had submitted to \nthe contrary, the DJ noted that the highly irregular tenancy agreements \u2013 \nincluding the fact that the appellant did not reside in the Unit despite being listed \nas an occupier \u2013 must have alerted the appellant to the fact that the Unit would \nlikely be used for an illicit activity. Coupled with the fact that the appellant \nsigned multiple rental agreements over 11 months, the DJ considered that the \nappellant\u2019s culpability \u201cwas not insignificant\u201d.11\n12 Turning to the offender-specific factors, the DJ observed that two other \nsimilar charges under s 420 of the Penal Code were TIC for the purpose of \nsentencing. She placed mitigating weight on the appellant\u2019s plea of guilt and his \nco-operation with the authorities.12\n13 For completeness, the DJ considered that two of the cases the \nProsecution cited (which involved harm that was \u201cnot easily quantifiable\u201d), \nnamely Public Prosecutor v Mikhy K Farrera Brochez [2017] SGDC 92 \n(\u201cMikhy\u201d)  and Dong Guitian v Public Prosecutor [2004] 3 SLR(R) 34 \n(\u201cDong\u201d), provided guidance in ascribing a value to the offence-specific factor \nconcerning the frustration of government policy and regulations and in arriving \nat an indicative sentence in the present case.13 Contrastingly, she placed no \nweight on the unreported cases the Defence cited.14 \n10 GD at [35]\u2013[40] (ROP at pp 68\u201370). \n11 GD at [41]\u2013[47] (ROP at pp 70\u201372).\n12 GD at [48]\u2013[54] (ROP at pp 72\u201374).\n13 GD at [57]\u2013[59] (ROP at pp 74\u201376).\n14 GD at [60]\u2013[70] (ROP at pp 76\u201379).\nVersion No 2: 25 Aug 2022 (12:38 hrs)\nWoo Haw Ming v PP [2022] SGHC 204\n614 In the final analysis, the DJ placed both the level of harm disclosed and \nthe appellant\u2019s culpability \u201cat the higher end of the low band\u201d.15 She considered \nthat a sentence of up to six months imprisonment was appropriate for a case \ninvolving low harm and low culpability but arrived at a final sentence of three \nmonths\u2019 imprisonment per proceeded charge after balancing the aforesaid \noffence-specific and offender-specific factors.16 The DJ ordered the sentences \nto run concurrently as they \u201carose from the same set of facts\u201d.17 \nThe parties\u2019 submissions\nThe appellant\u2019s submissions\n15 The appellant submitted that the DJ erred in law and\/or fact in four \nrespects. First, the DJ accorded excessive weight to the offence-specific factors \nthat were relevant to the harm occasioned by the appellant\u2019s offences. In \nparticular, there was no basis for the DJ to find that sham tenancies frustrate \ngovernment regulations (given that there are no government agencies regulating \ntenancy agreements) or were prevalent. Moreover, the financial harm caused to \nlandlords by sham tenancies is mitigated by a landlord\u2019s recourse to the rental \ndeposit. Sham tenancies also do not require elaborate planning.18\n16 Second, the DJ accorded excessive weight to the offence-specific factors \nthat went towards the appellant\u2019s culpability. Pertinently, the DJ had no basis to \ninfer that the appellant had some awareness that the Unit would be used for \nillegal activities or to find that the appellant\u2019s offending conduct permeated 11 \n15 GD at [55] (ROP at p 74). \n16 GD at [71] (ROP at p 79); GD at [72]\u2013[75] (ROP at pp 79\u201381).\n17 GD at [75] (ROP at p 80). \n18 Appellant\u2019s Submissions dated 2 August 2022 (\u201cAS\u201d) at [29]\u2013[43].\nVersion No 2: 25 Aug 2022 (12:38 hrs)\nWoo Haw Ming v PP [2022] SGHC 204\n7months when the appellant had signed three sham tenancy agreements within \nthree weeks and renewed one of these agreements 11 months later.19\n17 Third, the DJ offended the rule against double counting by both treating \nthe charges TIC for the purpose of sentencing as an offence-specific factor \nrelevant to the offender\u2019s culpability and a separate aggravating factor.20\n18 Fourth, the DJ placed undue weight on Mikhy and Dong. Mikhy and \nDong can be distinguished as they involve the frustration of governmental \nregulations which caused palpable harm. There was no evidence presently that \ngovernment regulations were frustrated, and any harm caused by the appellant\u2019s \nactions was mitigated by the Landlord\u2019s recourse to the rental deposits.21\n19 Following from the above, and with reference to various unreported \nprecedents, the appellant submitted that a sentence of six weeks\u2019 imprisonment \nper proceeded charge was fair and just.22   \nThe respondent\u2019s submissions\n20  The respondent submitted as follows. The factors that the DJ considered \nin assessing the harm occasioned by the appellant\u2019s offences were valid. \nFraudulent tenancies have serious and wider repercussions on society; they \nfrustrate governmental interest in holding tenants accountable for actions that \ntake place within rented premises. Moreover, it was reasonable for the DJ to \nfind that there was a sophisticated and well-orchestrated operation undergirding \n19 AS at [44]\u2013[50].\n20 AS at [51]\u2013[54].\n21 AS at [55]\u2013[57].\n22 AS at [58]\u2013[78].\nVersion No 2: 25 Aug 2022 (12:38 hrs)\nWoo Haw Ming v PP [2022] SGHC 204\n8the appellant\u2019s offences. The appellant entered into the fraudulent tenancies on \nbehalf of Eric (who communicated with the appellant at arm\u2019s length), the \ntenancies were monitored and renewed before they fell due, and females were \nsubsequently recruited to run the vice operations.23\n21 Likewise, the factors that the DJ had regard to in calibrating the \nculpability of the appellant were valid. The DJ correctly held that the suspicious \ncircumstances of the transactions must have alerted the appellant that something \nillicit was being planned. The appellant had been asked to sign the agreements \nfor no reason, had not been given a reason why Eric could not sign the \nagreements, was paid money for signing the agreements, was listed as the \noccupier of the Unit despite having no intention to reside in the Unit and had \nbeen told to leave the keys to the unit and the tenancy agreement in the Unit. In \nthis regard, Chang Kar Meng v Public Prosecutor [2017] 2 SLR 68 (\u201cChang \nKar Meng\u201d) is authority for the proposition that a court can draw inferences in \ndetermining the relevant factual matrix for sentencing purposes, so long as there \nis a sufficient factual basis to support the inference.24\n22 In a similar vein, the DJ did not find that the appellant\u2019s offending \nbehaviour persisted for 11 months but that it persisted when the opportunity \npresented itself 11 months later. In any event, while the appellant first signed \nthe tenancy agreements in January 2019, the effect of his deception and any \nvice-related activities permeated the entire duration of the tenancy.25\n23 Respondent\u2019s Submissions dated 2 August 2022 (\u201cRS\u201d) at [17]\u2013[26].\n24 RS at [27]\u2013[30].\n25 RS at [33].\nVersion No 2: 25 Aug 2022 (12:38 hrs)\nWoo Haw Ming v PP [2022] SGHC 204\n923 Next, the DJ did not err in having regard to Mikhy and Dong. While \nneither Mikhy nor Dong involved facts similar to the present case, they show \nthat \u201cnon-financial harm that has a wider public policy impact is a relevant \naggravating factor in sentencing\u201d. In other words, the non-financial, societal \nconsequences of an offender\u2019s deception must be considered in calibrating the \nappropriate sentence to be imposed.26\n24 Finally, the DJ did not offend the rule against double counting. The DJ \nwas justified in considering the fact that the appellant had signed multiple \ntenancy agreements in assessing his culpability and in treating his TIC charges \nas an offender-specific aggravating factor.27 \nMy decision\nPreliminary observations\n25 To begin, although parties understandably sought to justify their \nrespective positions with reference to the DJ\u2019s sentencing framework (which \nshe modelled after the framework set out in Logachev), I had my reservations \non whether offences under s 420 of the Penal Code involving fraudulent \ntenancies lend themselves well to a sentencing framework modelled after \nLogachev. The two-stage, five-step Logachev sentencing framework eschews a \nfocus on the principal factual elements of the cases and instead employs at the \nfirst step, a general holistic assessment of the seriousness of the offence by \nreference to all the offence-specific factors rather than the principal factual \nelements. These offence-specific factors can be in turn broken down into factors \nthat go towards the offender\u2019s culpability and the harm caused by the offender\u2019s \n26 RS at [34]\u2013[38].\n27 RS at [39]\u2013[42].\nVersion No 2: 25 Aug 2022 (12:38 hrs)\nWoo Haw Ming v PP [2022] SGHC 204\n10actions. Thereafter, the court identifies the applicable indicative sentencing \nrange within the sentencing matrix based on the level of harm and culpability \ndisclosed, locates the appropriate indicative starting point within that range, \nmakes adjustments to the indicative starting point by considering offender-\nspecific factors and makes further adjustments (if any) to the sentence to take \ninto account the totality principle (Logachev at [75]\u2013[84]). \n26 As I observed in Sue Chang v Public Prosecutor [2022] SGHC 176, \nhowever, the Logachev sentencing approach combines the granularity of a \nsentencing matrix model with the holistic nature of the sentencing of the \nsentencing bands approach. It may thus be better suited for offences where a \nbroad range of outcomes may arise under the specific axes of harm or culpability \n(at [64]). Thus, in Ye Lin Myint v Public Prosecutor [2019] 5 SLR 1005, one of \nthe reasons the High Court considered that a Logachev sentencing framework \ncould aptly govern offences under s 507 of the Penal Code, which concerns \ncriminal intimidation by an anonymous communication, was that such a \nframework \u201cwould more fully capture the wide diversity of acts punishable \nunder s 507 [of the Penal Code]\u201d (at [46]). The difficulty with fashioning a \nsentencing framework with reference to Logachev to deal with fraudulent \ntenancies is that these offences tend to manifest in a particular manner, viz, an \noffender deceives a landlord into believing that he intends to reside in the \nproperty when he possesses no such intention and where the property is then \nused for other, often nefarious, purposes. Any variation amongst offences \ninvolving fraudulent tenancies, for instance in the eventual use of the property \nor an offender\u2019s role in the criminal enterprise, is not \u2013 at least, presently \u2013 so \nwide that it demands a general holistic assessment of the seriousness of the \noffence in the spirit of Logachev. \nVersion No 2: 25 Aug 2022 (12:38 hrs)\nWoo Haw Ming v PP [2022] SGHC 204\n1127 Additionally, I also found the particulars of the DJ\u2019s proposed \nsentencing framework to be doctrinally suspect. For instance, apart from noting \nthat the court ought to utilise the full range sentencing range prescribed by \nParliament, the DJ provided no explanation for her determination that a sentence \nof up to six months imprisonment was appropriate for an offence disclosing low \nharm and low culpability.28 It was not self-evident or intuitive that this should \nbe the indicative sentencing range, especially when the maximum punishment \nfor an offence under s 420 of the Penal Code (ten years\u2019 imprisonment) was \nbrought to bear upon the analysis. In a similar vein, I did not agree that \u201c[p]ublic \npolicy considerations\u201d, \u201c[d]ifficulty in detection\u201d and the \u201c[p]revalence of paper \ntenancy offences\u201d were offence-specific factors that went towards harm.29 \nThese considerations did not pertain to the manner and mode by which an \noffence is committed (see Ng Kean Meng Terence v Public Prosecutor [2017] \n2 SLR 449 (\u201cTerence Ng\u201d) at [39(a)]).  \n28 In my view, there is some merit in establishing a presumptive sentence \nfor offenders who enter into fraudulent tenancies. This would ensure \nconsistency in sentencing while maintaining an appropriate level of flexibility \nand discretion for sentencing courts. To this extent, the single starting point \napproach (which calls for the identification of a notional starting point which \nwill then be adjusted to take into account any aggravating or mitigating factors) \nand the benchmark approach (which provides the focal point against which \nsentences in subsequent cases can be determined) warrant serious consideration; \nboth approaches are \u201cparticularly suited for offences which overwhelmingly \nmanifest in a particular way\u201d (Terence Ng at [23], [27]\u2013[28], [31]\u2013[32]). \n28 GD at [71] (ROP at p 79). \n29 GD at [33] (ROP at p 67). \nVersion No 2: 25 Aug 2022 (12:38 hrs)\nWoo Haw Ming v PP [2022] SGHC 204\n12Nevertheless, as parties did not submit on this issue, I left it for consideration \non another occasion. \n29 Before I deal with whether the sentences meted out by the DJ were \nmanifestly excessive, I make one other observation. In the proceedings below \nand before me, counsel for the appellant, Mr Markandu, suggested that some \nweight could be accorded to unreported precedents in so far as they offer a \n\u201cuseful point of reference\u201d in the court\u2019s final determination of whether a \nsentence is just and fair.30 I found that there was limited utility in this exercise. \nIt is trite that unreported decisions lack sufficient particulars to paint the entire \nfactual landscape required to appreciate the precise sentences imposed (Abdul \nAziz bin Mohamed Hanib v Public Prosecutor and other"}

Ms Oh merely replied with a winking face emoji: \u201c\ud83d\ude09\u201d. 16', 'Mr Chin continued to request for a written contract in the first half of 2020 to protect his financial interests in the face of proposed pay cuts and reduced benefits. 17', '12\\u2003On 2 June 2020, Ms Oh and Mr Chin negotiated various terms of Mr Chin\u2019s engagement by way of emails sent at 1.40am (by Ms Oh) and 10.37am (by Mr Chin). Mr Chin thereafter sent a WhatsApp message to Ms Oh to inform her of the same at 10.46am, to which Ms Oh replied that she would \u201ccheck the email\u201d. 18', 'The two continued to discuss various terms such as the minimum notice period and minimum teaching rate over email. 19', '13\\u2003Following their correspondence over email and WhatsApp, on the same day, Ms Oh and Mr Chin agreed to the terms of Mr Chin\u2019s engagement by Writers Studio by way of an email chain (the \u201cAgreement\u201d). 20', 'The terms offered by Ms Oh included the following:', '14\\u2003In the end, no \u201cblack and white document\u201d was drawn up under cl 8. 21', 'Nevertheless, it is undisputed that Mr Chin replied to Ms Oh, later in the day at 3.53pm, agreeing to various terms: 22', '15\\u2003Significantly, there were no further replies from Ms Oh to that email on that day. Ms Oh and Mr Chin did correspond over WhatsApp thereafter, which I elaborate upon in the next paragraph. However, for completeness, I highlight at this juncture that it was only on 18 September 2020 that Ms Oh replied to the same email chain. In that reply, she stated, \u201cHere [are] the contractual terms we agreed on by email\u201d.', '16\\u2003Later that day (ie, on 2 June 2020), from 9.06pm to 9.20pm, Ms Oh and Mr Chin corresponded by way of WhatsApp concerning potential contributions to Mr Chin\u2019s Central Provident Fund (\u201cCPF\u201d) account: 23', 'It is not disputed that at all material times, Writers Studio did not make any contributions to Mr Chin\u2019s CPF account.', '17\\u2003Apart from the late payment of Mr Chin\u2019s remuneration and the dispute over Writers Studio\u2019s lack of provision of materials for the Science class which led to Mr Chin\u2019s breaking point on 16 September 2020 (on which I elaborate below), two points of contention relating to communications that soured the relationship between Ms Oh and Mr Chin were the request by Writers Studio for Mr Chin to transfer his personal phone number ending with \u201c4599\u201d to Writers Studio and Mr Chin\u2019s subsequent communication with Writers Studio\u2019s clients privately.', '18\\u2003As to the former, Mr Chin explained at the trial that his second number ending \u201c4599\u201d (the \u201c4599 Number\u201d) was of sentimental value as he had received it on his \u201c18th birthday\u201d to commemorate the birth of his sister\u2019s child. Mr Chin explains that a variation of the phrase \u201cI am an uncle\u201d in Chinese, spoken as \u201cshi wo jiu jiu\u201d sounds like \u201c4599\u201d. 24', 'For some reason, the 4599 Number was never transferred to Writers Studio despite the agreement to attend at an M1 outlet to effect transference. 25', 'Ms Oh\u2019s position on the matter is that, despite the number not being registered under Writers Studio, it still belonged to Writers Studio because Mr Chin \u201chas said that it belongs to the company\u201d. 26', 'On 3 November 2020, Mr Chin gave an undertaking to the Court (the \u201cUndertaking\u201d) that he would, inter alia, terminate the 4599 Number within five days in summons no 4627 of 2020 (\u201cSUM 4627\u201d). 27', 'That Undertaking put an end to the matter (ie, the failure to effect transference) and is therefore not an issue before me. I need not say more on the matter.', '19\\u2003The latter point of contention, however, remains before me. Mr Chin sought Writers Studio\u2019s permission to contact his students privately. This is in contrast with Writers Studio\u2019s policy that \u201cthe teachers have to contact the parents using a landline located in our office\u201d. 28', 'Mr Chin likewise knew that Writers Studio had \u201cquite a strict policy against using a personal or private line to contact the clients or the clients\u2019 parents\u201d. 29', 'Pursuant to such a policy, Mr Chin was to contact the students through Writers Studio\u2019s landline before there was any agreement to use the 4599 Number. 30', 'Writers Studio eventually ceded to Mr Chin\u2019s multiple requests to contact his students privately on 13 November 2019, on the condition that Ms Oh was to be included in group chats. It was in that context that he had agreed to transfer his 4599 Number to Writers Studio for it to be used as a company number. In that way, Mr Chin could protect his own personal interests (by mitigating the risk of being backstabbed or having words put in his mouth) and Writers Studio could include that company number on their brochures promoting Innova Studio and\/or Writers Studio. 31', '20\\u2003What is in dispute is whether Mr Chin was given the latitude to contact students and\/or their parents (the \u201cClients\u201d) using the 4599 Number only, or whether he could do so using either of his personal numbers. While Writers Studio takes the former position, Mr Chin takes the latter. Nevertheless, Mr Chin admitted that there is no evidence that he was allowed to use his other personal number to contact the Clients (the \u201c9693 Number\u201d). 32', '21\\u2003On 16 September 2020, Mr Chin ceased to work at Writers Studio. However, parties disagree on whether Mr Chin had resigned (as Ms Oh contends) 33', 'or whether he had been terminated by Writers Studio (as Mr Chin contends). Writer\u2019s Studio\u2019s position is somewhat inconsistent \u2013 as counsel confirmed at the trial, Writers Studio\u2019s claim is not even that Mr Chin had resigned. 34', 'None of Writers Studio\u2019s claim against Mr Chin turns on this factual dispute and I thus need not say any more on the issue.', '22\\u2003Two issues that led to the parties parting ways was Writers Studio\u2019s late payment of his fees and failure to share certain teaching materials with him. In respect of the first issue, it is not disputed that Writers Studio had paid Mr Chin late on more than one occasion. 35', 'Mr Chin\u2019s position is that his salary was \u201csupposed to be paid on the 7th of each month\u201d, 36', 'which is in accordance with cl 4a of the Agreement. Writers Studio failed to pay Mr Chin his salary in time on the following occasions:', '(a)\\u2003August 2018 (only paid after 23 September 2018); 37', '(b)\\u2003October 2018 (only paid after 5 December 2018); 38', '(c)\\u2003May 2019 (only paid after 3 July 2019); 39', 'and', '(d)\\u2003August 2020 (only fully paid on 17 September 2020). 40', '23\\u2003On 12 September 2020, Writers Studio suspected that Mr Chin was taking some worksheets as his own. Ms Oh received messages from Writers Studio\u2019s typist, Michelle Phu (\u201cMs Phu\u201d), informing her that \u201c[n]ormally, Travis don\u2019t want to put the header on the doc\u201d and asked confirmation from Ms Oh that they were to \u201cuse [I]nnova [S]tudio as header right?\u201d [emphasis added]. Based on the WhatsApp messages between Ms Oh and Ms Phu, Mr Chin had been requesting the typist to send him the Microsoft Word versions of the worksheets that Ms Phu had prepared for him, and to remove Innova Studio\u2019s header from the documents. Ms Oh instructed the typist not to send Mr Chin the materials that he had requested as the documents belonged to Writer\u2019s Studio and was confidential information under the NDA. 41', '24\\u2003On 16 September 2020, Mr Chin was scheduled to teach classes from 3.00pm to 9.00pm. Prior to his 3.00pm class, he \u201conce again requested\u201d for his salary and teaching materials for the classes but \u201cno assistance was given\u201d. In support, Mr Chin (\u201cTravis\u201d in the transcript) relies on a conversation over WhatsApp from 3.08pm to 3.33pm: 42', 'The conversation continued, from 3.34pm to 3.38pm: 43', 'At 4.15pm, Mr Chin followed up with \u201c[a]pologies.

Mr Chin thereafter asked for confirmation of his termination on 17 September 2020, for which no further correspondence was forthcoming from Writers Studio. 50', 'On 19 September 2020, Writers Studio issued a termination letter to Mr Chin. 51', 'While this may have led to the disagreement as to whether Mr Chin had resigned or had his employment terminated by Writers Studio, as mentioned at [21], nothing turns on this.', '30\\u2003In summary, on 16 September 2020, Mr Chin had:', '(a)\\u2003informed his students that he had not been paid his remuneration;', '(b)\\u2003encouraged his students to inform their parents that Writers Studio had not paid him his remuneration;', '(c)\\u2003ended his 3.00pm class early;', '(d)\\u2003cancelled his 5.00pm and 7.00pm classes on short notice; and', '(e)\\u2003declared to the students that he was resigning.', 'In this judgment, I refer to these acts as his \u201cConduct\u201d. Mr Chin agreed that he had \u201cbehaved unprofessionally on 16th September 2020\u201d and such behaviour had caused Writers Studio \u201cto suffer damage\u201d. 52', '31\\u2003Three further disputes arose after Mr Chin had resigned. The first relates to teaching materials generated by the parties such as worksheets, PowerPoint slides and notes for Mr Chin\u2019s classes. Writers Studio also engaged a typist to help Mr Chin convert his handwritten notes into typed documents. 53', 'While Writers Studio demands that such materials should be returned, according to Mr Chin, all such teaching materials in his possession were returned on 21 and 22 September 2020. Writers Studio demanded, by way of its solicitor\u2019s letter, that the following materials to be returned by Mr Chin: 54', '32\\u2003Through his solicitors, Mr Chin refuted Writers Studio\u2019s allegation that certain documents were missing (ie, not returned) and highlighted that it \u201cdid not specify what documents were missing\u201d. 55', 'Even up to and at the trial, Writers Studio did not particularise the missing documents which it sought to recover from Mr Chin. 56', 'Instead, Ms Oh merely referred to the same list reproduced above. 57', 'Ms Oh elaborated that what was given back to Writers Studio was \u201cbits and pieces of worksheets, and they are not even in the complete whole [sic]\u201d and asserted that \u201che took the documents that the typist has typed, right, and it is in his possession\u201d. 58', '33\\u2003The second dispute relates to Mr Chin\u2019s continued teaching of one student, [B], in breach of his Undertaking to the Court. This issue was raised at the trial and is not pleaded in the statement of claim. The Undertaking was for Mr Chin to \u201cnot initiate contact with any of [Writers Studio\u2019s Clients] whom [he] taught whilst he was employed by [Writers Studio] except for the six students identified in para 4 of the 2nd affidavit of [Ms Oh] dated 12 October 2020\u201d and \u201c[e]xcluding [Mr Chin\u2019s] students whom he taught before he joined [Writers Studio\u2019s] employ\u201d. 59', 'Ms Oh\u2019s affidavit filed in support of SUM 4627 included six addresses, of which only students living at five of these addresses were identified by Writers Studio. 60', 'The student who resided at the second address (\u201cthe second student\u2019s address\u201d) was not identified by Writers Studio. According to Mr Chin, [B] resides at that address. 61', 'However, according to Writers Studio, since that student was not named as one of the students excluded from the Undertaking, Mr Chin had breached the Undertaking.', '34\\u2003The third dispute relates to Mr Chin\u2019s inappropriate behaviour with Writers Studio\u2019s students. Sometime in October 2020, another mathematics tutor with Writers Studio who took over Mr Chin\u2019s mathematics classes, Ting Kwai Meng (\u201cMr Ting\u201d), was \u201cvery alarmed\u201d by what the students had told him about Mr Chin\u2019s classes. In that regard, Mr Ting recorded a conversation with himself, the students and other employees of Writers Studio: 62', 'On 10 November 2020, the Singapore Police Force called Mr Chin to give his statements on a report made against him for such conduct. 63', 'I refer to Mr Chin\u2019s alleged touching and\/or alleged inappropriate communication (including interactions) with his students as \u201cInappropriate Behaviour\u201d.', '35\\u2003As mentioned at [16] above, parties did not agree for Mr Chin to be considered a contracted employee for whom Writers Studio had to make CPF contributions. Nor did Mr Chin negotiate to be considered as such. Both parties understood that Writers Studio did not have to pay CPF contributions to a freelancer and Mr Chin was at all material times engaged \u201cprivately\u201d. Mr Chin also agrees that he ultimately gave Writers Studio the \u201cchoice\u201d to contribute to his CPF. 64', 'Nevertheless, at the trial before me, the issue of CPF contributions was hotly debated.', '36\\u2003Mr Chin contacted the CPF Board regarding Writers Studio\u2019s lack of CPF contributions \u201csince the beginning, as an employee\u201d only after his resignation from Writers Studio. 65', 'The CPF Board commenced an investigation into the matter and informed Writers Studio of such investigation by way of letter. 66', '37\\u2003Although Ms Oh could not remember the specific date on which Writers Studio was notified of CPF\u2019s investigation, Ms Oh did receive the letter prior to Writers Studio\u2019s Statement of Claim (Amendment No 2) dated 21 September 2021. 67', 'It was only in that last version of Writers Studio\u2019s pleaded case that Mr Chin was allegedly engaged pursuant to a contract. That is in stark contrast to its earlier versions of the Statement of Claim dated 2 November 2020 and 23 March 2021 respectively, wherein Writers Studio referred specifically to Mr Chin\u2019s employment contract with it.

WWC\u2019s primary business is the construction and operation of wastewater treatment facilities in China. 8', '9\\u2003The first defendant provided the initial capital injection into WWC of around US$500,000. However, the plaintiff alleges that this was insufficient for WWC to commence operations. The first defendant therefore approached the plaintiff for financial assistance. The plaintiff then invested about US$1.2m into WWC. 9', '10\\u2003Notwithstanding her investment, the plaintiff alleges that the first defendant never issued any share certificates to her. The first defendant allegedly assured the plaintiff that WWC was a family-run business based on trust and that the plaintiff was the largest shareholder in WWC. In particular, the first defendant represented to the plaintiff that she owned 45% of WWC because of her investment. However, the plaintiff disputes this and avers that she is beneficially entitled to around 70% of WWC based on her initial capital injection. 10', '11\\u2003Unbeknownst to the plaintiff, WWC was fully sold to Goldwind International Holdings (HK) Limited (\u201cGoldwind\u201d) for approximately US$100m (\u201cthe Sale Proceeds\u201d) in 2017. Before this sale, the third defendant took over WWC\u2019s entire shareholding.

From 1 January 2000, SBS paid its bus captains on a monthly basis for the same number of hours of work, ie, 48 hours per week. The monthly salary consisted of the basic pay and a \u201cWeekly Allowance\u201d. Section 38(4) of the EA stipulates that an employee who at the employer\u2019s request works for more than eight hours a day or 44 hours a week must be paid overtime (\u201cOT\u201d) for the extra hours at a rate of not less than 1.5 times his hourly basic rate of pay. As the monthly basic pay under a bus captain\u2019s employment contract was based on a 48-hour work week, the basic pay thus comprised the 44-hour work week with the additional four hours (\u201cAdditional 4 Hours\u201d) described in the MOU as \u201cbuilt-in overtime\u201d or \u201cBIOT\u201d.

At the material time, the Employment Act (Cap 91, 1996 Rev Ed) (\u201cEA 1996\u201d) applied, but the relevant provisions are in pari materia to the EA. A bus captain would receive the Weekly Allowance so long as he worked one day and did not take any unpaid leave of absence in that work week. The Weekly Allowance was to ensure that employees were not short-changed. 3', '3\\u2003Additionally, although s 2(1) of the EA 1996 (and the EA) provided that \u201chours of work\u201d excluded intervals allowed for rest and meals (\u201cBreak Times\u201d), Cheng Siak Kian (\u201cCheng\u201d), SBS\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, attested that SBS paid its bus captains the OT rate for any hour after their eighth hour of work (which first eight hours included Break Times) each day. 4', '4\\u2003As part of the annual salary increment negotiations for the 2011 financial year between SBS and NTWU, SBS acceded to NTWU\u2019s request to revise the denominator for computing a bus captain\u2019s hourly rate from 48 to 44 hours beginning 1 January 2011. This enhanced the hourly rate of the bus captains and boosted a bus captain\u2019s OT earnings (for working beyond the 48 hours).

The contract also obliged the buyer to pay for each parcel by a confirmed, irrevocable, non-transferable and workable letter of credit payable at sight. 11', '10\\u2003The plaintiff advanced funds to the seller to enable it to purchase the coal which it was on-selling to the buyer. 12', 'The contract for the sale of the coal 13', 'was therefore structured to give the plaintiff a form of security for its advance. Thus, the contract was a tripartite contract between the buyer, the seller and the plaintiff. This was no doubt so that the plaintiff would have a direct cause of action against the buyer for a breach of the contract. Further, the contract expressly obliged the buyer: (a) to pay for the coal by two letters of credit to be issued in precisely the same terms as two draft letters of credit attached to the contract; 14', '(b) to name the plaintiff (rather than the seller) as the beneficiary in both letters of credit; 15', '(c) to procure that a major or international bank in Singapore confirmed both letters of credit; 16', 'and (d) to procure that both letters of credit were issued subject to the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits, 2007 Revision (\u201cthe UCP600\u201d) issued by the International Chamber of Commerce (\u201cthe ICC\u201d). 17', '11\\u2003The buyer duly procured a bank in Dubai to issue the two letters of credit in favour of the plaintiff. As stipulated in the contract, both letters of credit were issued expressly subject to the UCP600. 18', 'The first letter of credit was issued in August 2019 for US$0.7m, plus or minus 10%. The second letter of credit was issued in September 2019 for US$1.65m, plus or minus 10%. 19', 'Save for the value and the date of issuance, the two letters of credit are identical in all material respects.', '12\\u2003The issuing bank asked the defendant to act as the advising bank for both letters of credit. It also permitted the defendant to act as the nominated bank for both letters of credit. 20', 'The defendant duly advised both letters of credit to the plaintiff. 21', 'Both of the defendant\u2019s advices to the plaintiff contained the Sanctions Clause. 22', '13\\u2003In September 2019, the defendant added its confirmation to both letters of credit. 23', 'Both of the defendant\u2019s confirmations contained the Sanctions Clause. 24', '14\\u2003Both letters of credit were amended a number of times, both before and after the defendant confirmed them. The defendant duly advised all of these amendments to the plaintiff 25', 'and added its confirmation to them when necessary. All of the defendant\u2019s advices and confirmations of these amendments also contained the Sanctions Clause. 26', '15\\u2003The Sanctions Clause is a bespoke clause which the defendant invariably includes when it advises or confirms a letter of credit. 27', 'There is no provision in the UCP600 which covers the subject-matter of the Sanctions Clause. There is equally no such provision in the draft letters of credit attached to the contract for the sale of the coal or in the letters of credit as issued.', '16\\u2003In late November 2019, the plaintiff made a presentation of documents to the defendant under the letters of credit. 28', 'It made this presentation through a presenting bank. This first presentation of documents was discrepant. A day later, the defendant rejected the presentation. 29', 'The defendant does not suggest that the plaintiff was in breach of contract in doing so.', '17\\u2003One day after the rejection, the plaintiff made a second presentation of documents to the defendant under the letters of credit. 30', 'The defendant accepts that this second presentation was a complying presentation within the meaning of the UCP600. 31', 'The defendant therefore also accepts that, but for the Sanctions Clause, this presentation would have obliged the defendant pay the plaintiff against the documents. 32', '18\\u2003The face value of the drafts which the plaintiff presented to the defendant was US$2.42m. 33', 'This is the principal sum which the plaintiff claims from the defendant as damages for breach of contract.', '19\\u2003After the defendant had determined that the plaintiff\u2019s presentation was a complying presentation, it sent the documents for sanctions screening. Sanctions screening is one of the defendant\u2019s standard post-presentation procedures. 34', 'The purpose of sanctions screening is to ensure that the defendant complies with US sanctions laws and regulations. 35', 'I describe those laws and regulations in more detail below.', '20\\u2003The coal in the sale contract was shipped on a vessel known as \u201cOmnia\u201d. The defendant\u2019s sanctions screening revealed that the Omnia was an exact match for a vessel known as \u201cLady Mona\u201d. The defendant had determined \u2013 once in June 2015 36', 'and once again as recently as August 2019 37', '\u2013 that Lady Mona fell within the scope of US sanctions on Syria because it was likely to be beneficially owned by a Syrian entity. 38', 'The defendant made these determinations in the course of its continuing procedures for ensuring that it complies with US sanctions laws and regulations.', '21\\u2003In early December 2019, the defendant informed the presenting bank that the defendant was unable to accommodate the plaintiff\u2019s presentation of the documents because the transaction did not comply with applicable US sanctions laws or with policies designed to promote compliance with those laws. 39', 'At the same time, the defendant also informed the plaintiff directly that the defendant could not obtain internal approvals to pay the plaintiff against the complying presentation. 40', 'In early December 2019, the defendant returned the plaintiff\u2019s documents to the presenting bank. 41', 'The defendant did not make any determination at any time that the plaintiff\u2019s second presentation was a non-complying presentation. Indeed, the defendant\u2019s determination was quite the opposite: that it was a complying presentation which the defendant could nonetheless not pay against because the transaction did not comply with applicable US sanctions laws or with policies designed to promote compliance with those laws. Article 16 of the UCP600 and its requirements are therefore of no application.', '22\\u2003The letters of credit expired at the end of December 2019. 42', 'The plaintiff began efforts to secure payment direct from the buyer. In January 2020, the plaintiff entered into negotiations with the issuing bank and the buyer. The outcome of these negotiations was a written Memorandum of Understanding. In February 2020, pursuant to the Memorandum of Understanding, the buyer paid US$2.2m to the plaintiff in exchange for the plaintiff\u2019s documents. 43', '23\\u2003It is part of the defendant\u2019s case in this action that \u2013 even if it is in breach of contract for failing to honour its confirmations \u2013 the plaintiff fully mitigated any loss that may have been caused by the breach when it received US$2.2m directly from the buyer in February 2020. That sum of US$2.2m is not, of course, the entire sum of US$2.42m which the plaintiff claims in this action. But the defendant submits that the difference of US$0.22m is not a loss caused by any breach of contract on the defendant\u2019s part because it arises largely from a deficiency in the quality of the coal. 44', '24\\u2003This aspect of the defendant\u2019s case is relevant only to the issue of damages. As I have found that the defendant is not in breach of contract at all, I need not and do not deal with damages.'"}

On the same day, the Respondent borrowed $40,000 from the Complainant ostensibly for the purpose of annulling the bankruptcy order. The Complainant first provided the Respondent with $3,000 in cash, and provided $37,000 in cash the following day. The Respondent agreed to repay $40,000 to the Complainant in April 2018. Separately, the Respondent also approached the Complainant\u2019s mother to borrow $20,000 around 2 February 2018. This loan was to be repaid a few weeks after February 2018. All of the loans were repaid towards the end of September 2018 after the Complainant threatened to commence bankruptcy proceedings.', '9\\u2003It was crucial that after the Disclosure, the Respondent continued to act for the Complainant. In a WhatsApp message to the Complainant on 10 January 2018, the Respondent stated that she had had the annulment of the bankruptcy order \u201csorted\u201d, and that the case file against her would be closed. But in actuality, the bankruptcy order was not annulled until 22 May 2018, four months after the said message was sent.', '10\\u2003As for the Complainant\u2019s custody proceedings, the hearings were held on 11 April, with oral grounds delivered by 8 May 2018.

Thus, Smart had breached Article 4, paragraphs (A)(a), (A)(c) and (A)(i) of Schedule 2 of the Contract and clause 7(d) of the Contract. The MCST claimed $33,405, being the costs to restore the landscaping which was carried out by Lucky Garden Floriculture Pte Ltd (\u201cLucky Garden\u201d). 7', '6\\u2003Second, Smart wrongly and\/or negligently advised the MCST to tender for and install Hoarding Works on the basis that the costs incurred could be reimbursed from the SPs of these unit. In reliance of Smart\u2019s advice, the MCST engaged Build Archive 1 (\u201cBA\u201d) to install the Hoarding Works. However, the SPs subsequently refused to reimburse the MCST for such works. As such, the MCST claimed that Article 4, paragraph (A)(b) of Schedule 2, and clauses 7(a), (b), (c), (e), (i) and (j), of the Contract were breached. It claimed $67,000 as compensation for the costs of the Hoarding Works that could not be reimbursed from the sinking fund. 8', '7\\u2003Third, Smart wrongly advised the MCST to install the EM Locks. The MCST claimed that although Smart recommended the installation of the EM Locks system to prevent unauthorised entry into the premises after the closing hours of the shopping mall, Smart never implemented the system, which shows that the EM Locks were unnecessary. The MCST thus claimed that Article 4, paragraph (A)(b) of Schedule 2, and clauses 7(a), (b), (c) and (e), of the Contract were breached and claimed $19,153.50 as wasted costs incurred in installing the EM Locks. 9'"}
{"casename":"2022_SGHC_22","fact":"'2\\u2003The Plaintiff was incorporated in Singapore on 6 September 2010 and its primary purpose was\/is the provision of mobile messaging services. The Plaintiff\u2019s shareholders are Skantek Limited (\u201cSkantek\u201d), a British Virgin Islands Corporation and Bakel AG, a Swedish corporation (\u201cBakel\u201d).', '3\\u2003Skantek and Bakel are also shareholders of a Malaysian entity called Ice Mobile Sdn Bhd (\u201cIce Mobile\u201d) which prior to 4 August 2010 was known as Radius-ED Sdn Bhd (\u201cRadius\u201d).', '4\\u2003Ng was employed by Radius as a key account manager with effect from 2 January 2008, pursuant to a letter of appointment dated 26 October 2007. 1', '5\\u2003In early 2001, Radius was acquired by a US company known as Intelligent Communications Enterprise Corporation Inc (\u201cIce Corp\u201d) 2', 'after which Radius changed its name to Ice Mobile.', '6\\u2003Ng resigned from Ice Mobile\u2019s services on 11 August 2015 by which time he was holding the position of business development director.', '7\\u2003While he was employed first by Radius and then by Ice Mobile, it was Ng\u2019s case that he was part of a sales team that was tasked to carry out sales for Ice Mobile as well as for the Plaintiff, as both companies had common shareholders in Skantek and Bakel. In addition to his monthly salary, Ng claimed he was paid commission for the sales he generated for Ice Mobile and the Plaintiff.', '8\\u2003 \\u2003In Wong\u2019s case, he was offered employment as a systems engineer by a letter dated 22 July 2004 from Radius, which offer he accepted on 23 July 2004. 3', 'Wong was promoted several times whilst employed by Radius until he attained the position of general manager of business development by the time he resigned on 20 May 2015.', '9\\u2003Like Ng, Wong claimed he was also part of the sales team employed to carry out sales for Ice Mobile as well as the Plaintiff. Similarly, Wong was paid his monthly salary and from 10 May 2006 onwards whilst he was still with Radius, Wong also received his sales commission as well.', '', '10\\u2003While Ng and Wong were still in the employment of Ice Mobile, one Suresh Kumar (\u201cKumar\u201d) was appointed a director as well as Chief Executive Officer (\u201cCEO\u201d) of the Plaintiff and Ice Mobile on or about 29 October 2013, when the previous CEO resigned.', '11\\u2003A month before October 2013, Kumar had been appointed by Loganathan Ravishankar (\u201cLogan\u201d), a director of the Plaintiff, as an independent consultant to conduct due diligence on the operations of both the Plaintiff and Ice Mobile. In the course of his appointment as director and CEO, Kumar discovered that Ng had been paid by the Plaintiff $133,495.90 (\u201cNg\u2019s sales commission\u201d) allegedly for commission earned between 28 January 2011 and 28 October 2014, even though Ng was not an employee of the Plaintiff.', '12\\u2003Kumar similarly discovered that Wong was also paid sales commission by the Plaintiff of $174,988.34 (\u201cWong\u2019s sales commission\u201d) for the same period as Ng when he too was not an employee of the Plaintiff. Henceforth, the two sums will be referred to collectively as \u201cthe unauthorised commissions\u201d.', '13\\u2003In his Affidavit of Evidence in Chief (\u201cAEIC\u201d) Kumar deposed 4', 'that Ng\u2019s employment contract contained a clause that explicitly stated that any disputes in the calculation of sales commission would be resolved at the sole discretion of Ice Mobile and there was another clause that stated that the sales commission scheme did not apply to sales personnel who resigned.', '14\\u2003Kumar added that Ng was under Ice Mobile\u2019s Sales Incentive Scheme (\u201cSIS\u201d), On-Target Earning Commission Scheme (\u201cOTE\u201d) and Sales Commission Scheme (\u201cSCS\u201d) and any commission due to him under those schemes would have been paid out to him in full. The Plaintiff had no role in the commission pay-outs.', '15\\u2003Kumar alleged that the unauthorised commissions were an illicit arrangement between Ng and Wong with Balamurali Balasubramaniam (\u201cBala\u201d) the then CEO of Ice Mobile, who was also a director of the Plaintiff. Kumar deposed that Bala himself was a salaried employee of Ice Mobile with no commission entitlements. Yet, Bala paid himself US$512,000 (which approximated S$698,419.20) as \u201cconsultancy\u201d fees over and above his salary. Bala had initially joined Ice Mobile as a consultant in 2009 pending its takeover by Ice Corp. It was Bala who came up with a formula to pay the Defendants their commission.', '16\\u2003Kumar identified another person as being involved in the unauthorised commissions paid to both Defendants. That person was Cindy Soh (\u201cCindy\u201d), the Human Resources & Finance Manager of Ice Mobile. She was neither an employee nor director of the Plaintiff, but was apparently a director of Radius for about 6 months in 2006. 5', 'Cindy reported to Bala and took his instructions as the CEO of Ice Mobile. Such instructions included keying into a Microsoft excel sheet the sales revenue figures in order to compute commission due to the Defendants.', '17\\u2003Kumar deposed that the unauthorised commissions were never sanctioned by the board of directors of Ice Mobile or the Plaintiff. He alleged that the Defendants had acted fraudulently, dishonestly and wrongfully in procuring the unauthorised commissions to themselves.', '18\\u2003In 2016, Ng instituted proceedings against Ice Mobile in the Malaysian Industrial Arbitration Court (\u201cthe MIAC\u201d) in Case No. 4\/4\/(21)-1002\/16 (\u201cNg\u2019s IAC proceedings\u201d). In the course of cross-examination on 7 September 2017, Ng admitted 6', 'that there was no basis for him to receive commission from the Plaintiff. On 3 January 2018 Ng applied by email to withdraw Ng\u2019s arbitration proceedings and on 5 January 2018, the MIAC made an order dismissing his case. 7', '19\\u2003Ng then sued Ice Mobile in the Sessions Court in Malaysia in 2018 (\u201cNg\u2019s Malaysian suit\u201d) for outstanding sales commission amounting to RM214,990.81 (\u201cNg\u2019s claim). In a judgment given on 29 January 2020, the Sessions Court ruled in favour of Ng\u2019s claim. Ice Mobile appealed to the Kuala Lumpur High Court against the decision of the Sessions Court. On 8 October 2020, the High Court allowed Ice Mobile\u2019s appeal, set aside the judgment of the Session Court and dismissed Ng\u2019s claim with costs. The grounds of judgment dated 31 July 2021 (\u201cthe High Court judgment\u201d) were received by the Plaintiff in August 2021. Ng has filed an appeal with the Malaysian Court of Appeal against the High Court judgment.', '20\\u2003On his part, Wong commenced proceedings on or about 14 April 2016 against Ice Mobile in the MIAC in Case No. 27(21)\/4-623\/16 (\u201cWong\u2019s IAC proceedings\u201d) alleging that he was constructively dismissed by Ice Mobile\u2019s letter of termination dated 20 May 2015. Wong requested to be reinstated to his former post of senior manager of business development. In an Award dated 11 July 2019, 8', 'the MIAC dismissed Wong\u2019s IAC proceedings, finding that in failing to return to work on 27 May 2015 to serve out his three months\u2019 notice period, Wong had disobeyed a lawful order of his superior, which act was tantamount to insubordination. Wong\u2019s insubordination constituted a breach of contract on his part which went to the root of his contract of employment and amounted to a repudiatory breach thereof 9', '.', '21\\u2003Further, the MIAC found 10', 'that Wong failed to meet his sales targets for the years 2011\u20132014 and he would not in any case have qualified for any sales commission payments.', '22\\u2003It was disclosed by the Plaintiff\u2019s counsel 11', 'in court that the Defendants are now in direct competition with the Plaintiff doing the same exact same business.', '23\\u2003Kumar\u2019s AEIC for both Suits mirrored the allegations pleaded in the Plaintiff\u2019s (amended) Statement of Claim (\u201cSOC\u201d) almost verbatim. There is no necessity therefore to repeat the Plaintiff\u2019s pleaded allegations save to add that there were alternative claims based on unjust enrichment and monies had and received against both Defendants. For both Defendants, the unauthorised commissions commenced on 28 January 2011 and ended on 28 October 2014.', '24\\u2003In both Suits, the Plaintiff averred that certain findings were made in Wong\u2019s IAC proceedings and his claim there was dismissed. The Plaintiff quoted extracts from the findings made by the MIAC to support its pleaded case that the principles of issue estoppel and\/or res judicata applied and those findings of facts cannot be retried in these proceedings. 12', '25\\u2003The Defendants filed almost identical defences in the two Suits. In the First Suit, Ng averred 13', 'that although he was employed by Ice Mobile, he had carried out work in the form of sale of bulk messaging services for both Ice Mobile and the Plaintiff. Ng admitted that Ice Mobile and the Plaintiff are separate entities, but it was the sales team of Ice Mobile of which Ng was a part that procured the sales for both entities serving the Malaysian clients of Ice Mobile and non-Malaysian clients of the Plaintiff.', '26\\u2003Ng added that since the Plaintiff\u2019s incorporation, he had received payment of any and all commission from the Plaintiff through his Maybank account in Singapore, regardless of whether the sales he procured were through Ice Mobile\u2019s clients or the Plaintiff\u2019s. Ng put the Plaintiff to strict proof of all the allegations made against him. He pleaded that Wong\u2019s IAC proceedings only related to the Second Suit and not to the First Suit.', '27\\u2003Other than the fact that the Plaintiff\u2019s claim against Wong in the Second Suit was for a different sum, Wong\u2019s defence was a mirror image of that filed by Ng.', '28\\u2003In relation to Wong\u2019s IAC proceedings, Wong\u2019s defence accepted that the MIAC made the findings the Plaintiff had quoted 14', 'but he contended that the MIAC focused on his failure to meet annual sales targets whereas the commission he received throughout his employment was not solely based on meeting his annual sales targets. He was also entitled to receive monthly commission based on his satisfying the monthly threshold targets set for him which he did. 15', '29\\u2003Wong averred that the MIAC\u2019s findings that he did not meet his annual sales target related to a sale commission scheme that took effect from July 2014. He contended he never received commission pursuant to the July 2014 scheme. He pointed out that the MIAC did not make findings in respect of his performance against sales targets set for him under previous commission schemes that he was placed under. He added that he has applied for a judicial review of the MIAC\u2019s findings.', '30\\u2003Like Ng, Wong put the Plaintiff to strict proof of its many allegations against him. Very little turns on the Replies filed by the Plaintiff in the two Suits and the court will refer to those documents only in passing in relation to Ng\u2019s testimony.', '31\\u2003On the application of the Defendants and with the Plaintiff\u2019s consent, the two Suits were consolidated by order of court dated 28 February 2020 and tried before this court.', '32\\u2003The Plaintiff called three witnesses for its case. Besides Kumar, the Plaintiff\u2019s other witnesses were Fredrik Jan Olof Ramen (\u201cRamen\u201d) and Logan.', '33\\u2003Apart from Ng and Wong, the Defendants\u2019 other witnesses were Bala and Laszlo Karoly Kadar (\u201cLaszlo\u201d) who is also known as Thomas Kesser, a witness called at the eleventh hour by the Defendants and who claimed to be the Plaintiff\u2019s shareholder. Although they indicated to the court they intended to, the Defendants eventually did not call Cindy as their witness.', '34\\u2003In cross-examination of Kumar, the Defendant\u2019s counsel then tried to suggest that Cindy would have supported the Defendants\u2019 case if she had been called as the Plaintiff\u2019s witness, which this court views as an unmeritorious suggestion. The court pointed out that it would have been more appropriate for the Defendants to call her to testify since it was their contention that she would have supported their case. 16', 'It is trite law that he who alleges must prove.', '35\\u2003During Kumar\u2019s cross-examination, 17', 'he had in any event disagreed that Cindy was part of Ice Mobile\u2019s senior management. In re-examination, he explained that Cindy was nothing more than Ice Mobile\u2019s bookkeeper, albeit she was the head of her department. Her monthly salary was about RM9,800 as compared with Bala\u2019s salary of S$15,000 from the Plaintiff which approximated RM45,000 per month. 18', '36\\u2003On the first day of the scheduled trial, the Defendants applied to vacate the trial dates by way of Summonses Nos 5189 of 2021 and 5190 of 2020 respectively in the First and Second Suits (\u201cthe two Summonses\u201d) due to their intention to call Laszlo as a last-minute witness as well as their intention to file a supplementary AEIC by Bala.', '37\\u2003The court heard and dismissed both Summonses as regards vacating the trial dates but allowed the Defendants to file a supplementary AEIC by Bala. Trial was postponed by half a day to allow the Defendants more time to prepare for their case.', '38\\u2003I should add as an aside that Logan and Laszlo are embroiled in another set of proceedings in Suit 1180 of 2019 (\u201cSuit 1180\u201d) in which Laszlo as the second plaintiff and a medical doctor as the first plaintiff, sued Logan and Logan\u2019s brother-in-law Gunaratnam Sakunthar Raj (\u201cRaj\u201d). The trial was before another court which dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 claim in a judgment dated 22 October 2021 (see Metupalle Vasanthan & Anor v Loganathan Ravishankar & Anor [2021] SGHC 238) and awarded judgment of US$388,281.22 instead on Logan\u2019s counterclaim against the first plaintiff.', '39\\u2003The Plaintiff has also sued Bala in Suit No 1118 of 2020 (\u201cSuit 1118\u201d) for inter alia the return of the sum of US$512,000 19', 'which action is still pending.', '40\\u2003Kumar was the first to testify for the Plaintiff. In his AEIC, Kumar referred to Ng\u2019s Malaysian suit and Wong\u2019s IAC proceedings. His testimony as stated earlier (see [23]) mirrored the Plaintiff\u2019s SOC and was uncontroversial. Kumar was cross-examined on Ice Mobile\u2019s Employee Handbook (\u201cthe Handbook\u201d) which took effect on 1 January 2015. He had drafted the comprehensive document which totalled 47 pages which copy was received and acknowledged by Ng on 22 January 2014 and by Wong on 2 March 2015. 20', '41\\u2003At issue were the following clauses in the Handbook:', '42\\u2003During cross-examination, 21', 'Kumar disclosed that the earning targets for sales employees were actually set by Ng himself as at the material time, since he was the head of sales at Ice Mobile, Ng came up with the sales commission scheme which Kumar then approved and implemented.', '43\\u2003Kumar was also cross-examined and re-examined on eight HSBC telegraphic transfer documents 22', 'which he signed for remittances to Ng in Singapore dollars. Kumar testified 23', 'that he did note Ng was paid commission regardless of the fact that the sales team did not meet its OTE targets. For 2013, the Plaintiff was short of its on-target sales by almost $6m and $7m in 2014. However, after consulting Logan, Kumar was told not to \u201crock the boat\u201d and Logan instructed Kumar to approve the payments as part of Ng\u2019s OTE (see [14]), until Kumar had more time to look into the documents to find out if the OTE scheme actually existed in the first place. 24', 'This was before the new sales commission scheme that Kumar devised was implemented later in 2014.', '44\\u2003Kumar explained that after its peak in December 2011 to January 2012, the Plaintiff\u2019s business went into a steady decline from a monthly revenue of RM3.5m to RM1.5m. He attributed the decline in revenue to the sales team\u2019s attitude of not taking responsibility. The team was more interested in travelling overseas and chasing for payment of their commission than in increasing sales and collection of payments. It was a bad corporate culture that permeated throughout the entire organisation from the top, a recipe for disaster in any business. After the Defendants\u2019 resignations, things did not improve as they set up rival businesses to compete with Ice Mobile.', '45\\u2003The court turns next to Logan\u2019s evidence. He is a trained pilot who has become a successful investor and businessman in various ventures in a number of countries including the charter, sale and purchase of private jets and organising corporate tours for governments. Logan\u2019s investments in Skantek, Ice Mobile and the Plaintiff were just some of his many business ventures. Unfortunately, due to the current Covid-19 pandemic, the business of his private jet company as well as that of his cancer treatment centre in the Philippines have been adversely affected.', '46\\u2003In his AEIC and in court, Logan said he considered Bala a close family friend. It was Bala who first introduced Radius to him in 2009 of which Bala was then a consultant. Logan invested in Radius in 2013. He deposed 25', 'he was not directly involved in the day-to-day running of the business of Ice Mobile and\/or the Plaintiff as he left that to Bala. However, he and Bala would meet once a week and Bala would discuss and propose various ideas he had. However, not once did Bala discuss with Logan anything regarding schemes for payment of sales commissions to employees of either company. Logan was only aware that Ice Mobile had employees who were paid fixed salaries under their respective contracts of employment.', '47\\u2003Logan deposed 26', 'that in or about April 2013, he noticed that the business and profits of Ice Mobile and the Plaintiff had been going down steadily over a period of time and that Bala had taken several business trips which did not result in any new business for either company. Such trips on business class airfare were to play golf overseas. 27', 'In one year alone, Logan discovered that Bala visited Bali five times but the Plaintiff had no messaging business there 28', '. As a result, Logan requested Bala to resign as CEO which Bala did on 29 October 2013 shortly after Kumar was appointed (see [10]). He said Kumar\u2019s appointment to conduct a due diligence exercise was done after consultation with Ramen in September 2013.', '48\\u2003Believing from Kumar\u2019s preliminary findings that the businesses of Ice Mobile and the Plaintiff were being mismanaged, Logan then ordered a full investigation of both companies. He discovered therefrom the unauthorised commissions paid to the Defendants by Bala and the sum of US$512,000 that Bala paid himself. He deposed that Bala\u2019s undocumented commission scheme in effect guaranteed preposterous amounts of money to the Defendants even where the Plaintiff was not doing well. Those payments were never sanctioned by the board of directors of either Ice Mobile or the Plaintiff. Hence, the Plaintiff was entitled to recover them.', '49\\u2003Logan surmised that Bala had a hand in the new competing businesses set up by Ng and Wong. He further suspected Bala of being instrumental in the Defendants\u2019 incorporation of an offshore shell company. He opined that Bala protected the Defendants by paying them the unauthorised commissions and then took them away to create the new business they now have. Indeed, he thought the three persons were setting up companies on the side while working for and being paid by Ice Mobile. 29', '50\\u2003Logan alleged that Bala told him Bala expected to procure business from companies like Singtel in Singapore and the Tata group in India, but it was just talk and no deals materialised. Logan opined that Bala had abused his and Ramen\u2019s trust.', '51\\u2003The court notes that in Logan\u2019s affidavit filed on 27 October 2020 to oppose the Defendants\u2019 two summonses (see [36]) for leave to file Bala\u2019s supplemental AEICs, he had deposed that his brother in-law Raj held shares in Skantek on trust for him. In that affidavit, Logan vigorously denied Bala\u2019s allegation that Laszlo owned Skantek. 30', 'Logan alleged that Bala introduced Laszlo to him and Ramen as someone who could broker business arrangements for Ice Mobile and the Plaintiff. Over time however, he and Ramen came to realise that Laszlo was a conman and a fraudster who foisted scams on them and caused Ramen to lose US$2.4m in the process. Logan further alleged that Laszlo operated under multiple names, passports and aliases.', '52\\u2003The Plaintiff\u2019s last witness was Ramen who is a non-resident director of the Plaintiff, based in Belgium. In his AEIC, Ramen deposed he holds 92.61% of the shares in Bakel which in turn holds 30% of the shares in the Plaintiff as well as Ice Mobile. Like Logan, Ramen is involved in numerous businesses as an investor. He had also resided in Singapore previously and managed companies here for 7 years 31', 'and those in other countries in the Asia region; these included the Swedish multinational supplier of household appliances known as Electrolux. 32', 'Ramen is a board member of the Plaintiff but not of Ice Mobile.', '53\\u2003Like Kumar, Ramen deposed that there was no justification for payment of commission by the Plaintiff on behalf of Ice Mobile to the Defendants as the payments were not sanctioned by the board of directors of the Plaintiff or Ice Mobile. Cindy could not have authorised the payments as she was not an employee of the Plaintiff but of Ice Mobile where she reported to Bala and took his instructions as he was the CEO.', '54\\u2003Ramen deposed that Bala did not communicate with him or Logan nor seek their approval regarding any scheme for payment of sales commissions to any employees of the Plaintiff. He only became aware of the unauthorised commissions paid to the Defendants by Bala and Bala\u2019s payment of US$512,000.00 to himself when told by Kumar in Sweden where they met in October 2015. Ramen testified in board meetings he attended with Bala, the latter never brought up the issue of commissions nor was it a subject matter on the agenda. He was emphatic that he never heard from Bala anything about commissions, never saw any plans for commissions nor seen any calculations 33', 'as regards achievements related to those plans.', '55\\u2003 As far as Ramen was aware, the Plaintiff employed Bala as its CEO and one other person Allyce Kwong who was a sales representative. 34', 'Ramen testified he had met the Defendants and was aware they did sales for Ice Mobile 35', '.', '56\\u2003 The AEICs of Ng and Wong were almost identical save for their different employment histories. The Defendants\u2019 AEICs 36', 'contained the following common paragraphs:', 'Henceforth the Defendants\u2019 Maybank accounts will be referred to collectively as \u201cthe Singapore accounts\u201d. The Defendants added that after they opened the Singapore accounts, all payments of commission that they were entitled to were only paid into those accounts. The only form of payment which they continued to receive through their Malaysian bank accounts (which was also with Maybank) was their salaries.', '57\\u2003The Defendants deposed that the Plaintiff had no sales staff and all its sales were done by the sales teams in Ice Mobile of which they were a part. Both claimed to have sourced for clients for the Plaintiff from a non-exhaustive list of countries which included Singapore, United Kingdom, Sweden, Croatia, France. India, South Africa, Egypt, Philippines, China and Hong Kong.', '58\\u2003The Defendants also deposed that their sales commission paid between 2009 and 2013\/2014 was structured in accordance with the OTE scheme implemented by the previous management of Ice Mobile when it was known as Radius and its CEO was Dr Bruno Sorrentino (\u201cDr Sorrentino\u201d) who ran the company with his wife Sherri Goh (\u201cGoh\u201d). The defendant added that throughout their employment, they were never told in writing or otherwise, that they were not entitled to be paid commission.', '59\\u2003Although they did not go to the extent that Bala did in alleging Cindy 37', 'was the party primarily if not solely responsible for the unauthorised commissions they received, the Defendants\u2019 AEICs emphasised Cindy\u2019s role in those transactions. They suggested that Cindy was the person who requested them to set up the Singapore accounts in order for them to receive the payments. Indeed, during cross-examination, 38', 'Ng described Cindy as \u201chigh management\u201d.', '60\\u2003Ng filed a supplementary AEIC (\u201cNg\u2019s supplementary AEIC\u201d) after leave was granted by 9the court. Ng\u2019s supplementary AEIC addressed the Plaintiff\u2019s SOC (Amendment No 1) and Reply (Amendment No 2). The Plaintiff\u2019s amended SOC had referred to the dismissal of Wong\u2019s IAC proceedings and in the Plaintiff\u2019s amended Reply, it averred that the outcome of Wong\u2019s IAC proceedings applied to Ng.', '61\\u2003Ng disagreed with the Plaintiff\u2019s above position pointing out that Wong\u2019s IAC proceedings only involved Wong and Ice Mobile and he was not a party. Hence, the findings of the MIAC in Wong\u2019s IAC proceedings did not apply to and were not relevant to him. Ng added that the Plaintiff\u2019s attempt to rely on Wong\u2019s IAC proceedings was a prejudice to him.', '62\\u2003Ng\u2019s supplemental AEIC then referred to Ng\u2019s Malaysian proceedings. He deposed that the Sessions court had awarded him judgment for his claim for commission from Ice Mobile as the court accepted his testimony of having made sales both for Ice Mobile and the Plaintiff and the two companies had an internal agreement for the Plaintiff to pay all his commission.', '63\\u2003Ng was cross-examined on the sales targets that were set for him by the previous management 39', 'in 2008 and 2009. He agreed that in order to earn his commission based on OTE, he had to achieve the sales set by Sorrentino. Apparently, the previous management would in December of each year, set sales targets that Ng must meet for the following year.', '64\\u2003Ng was questioned on Bala\u2019s email to him dated 6 April 2011 40', 'which attached therewith Ice Mobile\u2019s OTE targets for 2011. The email there referred to Bala\u2019s earlier email addressed to the Defendants dated 17 March 2011 (\u201cthe 17 March email\u201d). As the 17 March email featured prominently in the Plaintiff\u2019s closing submissions and the Defendants relied on it for their defence, the court sets out below its full text:', '65\\u2003The Plaintiff\u2019s stand was that no firm contract was concluded on the Defendants\u2019 commission based on the above email as the Defendants were unable to produce any document which showed their acceptance of Bala\u2019s terms. Ng had referred to his email to Bala dated 27 April 2012 (more than a year later) 41', 'titled \u201cFinal Numbers\u201d where he stated:', 'As noted above, the email could not have been a response to Bala\u2019s email of 6 April 2011 at [64]. In fact, it was a reply to Bala\u2019s email dated 24 April 2012 42', 'titled Final Numbers wherein Bala had reviewed Ice Mobile\u2019s requirements, past performance and projected plans for 2012.', '66\\u2003There was a change in the commission structure for the Defendants in 2013 as part of their commissions became guaranteed. This can be seen in Bala\u2019s email dated 29 March 2013 43', 'addressed to Ng (of which Wong was also a recipient) and which was copied to Cindy where Bala inter alia said:', 'Neither Ng nor Wong responded to the above email. Indeed, Ng\u2019s testimony 44', 'that there would have been a subsequent email response from him in relation to the commission scheme Bala proposed was not substantiated.', '67\\u2003Cross-examined on the 17 March email, Ng disagreed it did not constitute a formal agreement. 45', 'However, he did agree that his email set out at [65] was a counterproposal to Bala\u2019s proposals set out at [64].', '68\\u2003Ng further disagreed that guaranteed commissions is hardly a practice in almost every industry 46', '. Ng explained that the SMS market because very challenging at end-2012 as the government regulatory authority, the MCMC, prevented Ice Mobile from achieving its targets. In his case, the target set for him was RM22\u201323m in sales which he could not possibly achieve. Ng informed Bala that the sales commission was what motivated his sales. Bala then decided to change the commission structure such that Ng would receive 45% of his commission as part of his basic pay.', '69\\u2003Notwithstanding that para 4 of Bala\u2019s email in [66] clearly stated that the offer would expire on 30 June 2012 after which it would be reviewed, Ng insisted that he accepted the offer for the whole of 2012.', '70\\u2003Counsel for the Plaintiff drew Ng\u2019s attention to Kumar\u2019s letter dated 18 August 2014 addressed to him 47', 'relating to the SCS scheme in 2014, as an example of a formal commission agreement which Ng countersigned to indicate his acceptance. Ng disagreed stating it was not necessarily how an agreement is documented 48', '.', '71\\u2003On 12 May 2015, Ng tendered his letter of resignation 49', 'as business development director to Kumar. He disclosed during cross-examination 50', 'he was prompted to do so because (i) Kumar terminated the services of three of his sales staff (including Wong) allegedly for non-performance without informing him and (ii) his sales commission had been outstanding for more than a year. Ng tendered a separate letter of resignation also dated 12 May 2015 51', 'as a director of Ice Mobile. He was replaced by Logan.', '72\\u2003In answer to the court\u2019s question, Ng agreed 52', 'that he did not have an employment contract with the Plaintiff. In fact, according to a letter dated 1 June 2010 53', 'addressed to him by Bala (which Ng countersigned as acceptance), after Radius was acquired by Ice Corp, Ng\u2019s employment contract was transferred to Ice Corp.', '73\\u2003It is noteworthy that Bala\u2019s email of 17 March 2011 in [64] was not copied to Ramen as a director of the Plaintiff nor even to Cindy despite Ng\u2019s contention that she was part of Ice Mobile\u2019s high management (see [59]).', '74\\u2003As for Cindy\u2019s role, Ng asserted when questioned by the court 54', 'that Cindy was the financial controller and co-signatory of bank documents who kept records in the computer system relating to his and Wong\u2019s commission. She had to approve their payments to ensure they were within the company\u2019s budget. Ng confirmed Cindy was part of the company\u2019s management who gave the final approval for their payments. He added that that was why the Defendants wanted to subpoena her as a witness (but they did not).', '75\\u2003The court pointed out to Ng that Cindy was not party to relevant emails even though (according to the Defendants) she played such an important role in the unauthorised commissions. Ng agreed with the court\u2019s observations but offered no explanation for the omission. Counsel for the Plaintiff also noted that there was no exchange of emails between Bala and Cindy relating to commission calculations and\/or payments. Ng sought to explain that as a sales person, he was in no position to decide who is carbon-copied in company emails. He himself had never emailed to either Logan or Ramen. Apart from his own speculation, Ng could not identify any document that showed that Ramen (or Logan) knew of the commission arrangement Bala had agreed with him and Wong.', '76\\u2003Ng had referred to an email from Bala dated 17 December 2011 where the latter indicated he would be discussing with Ramen \u201cour plans for Europe\u201d. 55', 'The court questioned Ng 56', 'how he could conclude therefrom that Ramen was always kept in the loop when Ramen was not even copied in that email.', '77\\u2003Unlike the commission that he received from Ice Mobile which he declared to the Malaysian tax authorities, Ng\u2019s cross-examination 57', 'revealed that he did not declare as his income, nor did he pay taxes in Malaysia or in Singapore on, the unauthorised commissions. His excuse was that he did not have a chance to do so but would take remedial action.', '78\\u2003Ng admitted he signed off on the accounts of Ice Mobile as the company\u2019s \u201csecondary\u201d director but added he was \u201cjust a sleeping director\u201d and was never involved in any board meetings. Ng pointed out that after Kumar joined Ice Mobile, Kumar paid Ng\u2019s commission earned from previous months. Ng also said that he and Bala never discussed that he would be paid by the Plaintiff.', '79\\u2003It was during cross-examination that Ng disclosed he works for Fire Mobile Sdn Bhd and is a director of Cookiss Mobile Sdn Bhd which is Wong\u2019s employer. Both companies are in the same business as Ice Mobile and the Plaintiff. Ng and Wong are involved with another company called Trylah Sdn Bhd where their wives Joanne Munis and Allyce Kwong respectively, are directors.', '80\\u2003 There is no doubt from the documents presented in court that Ng worked hard generally and achieved the sales targets set for him. However, Ng could not refer to a single document to support the Defendants\u2019 case that they were paid commission by the Plaintiff for non-Malaysian clients of Ice Mobile by some arrangement agreed between the two companies. It is to be borne in mind that neither Ng nor Wong were employed by the Plaintiff either by an appointment letter, contract of employment or even by way of exchange of emails between themselves and the Plaintiff or, between themselves, Ice Mobile and the Plaintiff. Nor could Ng or Wong point to any correspondence or email from Bala informing them they were also to carry out sales for the Plaintiff.', '81\\u2003It was during his re-examination 58', 'that Ng explained why he disagreed with the Plaintiff\u2019s counsel 59', 'that guaranteed commission was not an industry practice. Ng disclosed that Bala as Ice Mobile\u2019s CEO and director, had from 1 January 2013 onwards decided not to pay Ng and other sales staff a basic salary. Instead, Bala proposed that all sales staff maintain Ice Mobile\u2019s 2012 sales targets. However, to incentivise and\/or retain the unhappy staff, Bala proposed to convert their commission to guaranteed payments which was what he did. It did not help that the MCMC, the regulatory authority under the Ministry of Communications, 60', 'prohibited the messaging industry from conducting its mass messaging business due to many complaints of receiving scam and spam messages by end-users. The prohibition greatly affected and reduced Ice Mobile\u2019s revenue by 60\u201370% and in turn the commission paid to its sales staff.', '82\\u2003Much time was spent on and by the Defendants during cross-examination and re-examination (as well as in their closing submissions) on the operations of the various commission schemes particularly the OTE. Ng in particular sought to explain\/justify the quantum of the unauthorised commissions he received from the Plaintiff. Such evidence is irrelevant \u2013 it is not the quantum that is in issue here but the Plaintiff\u2019s liability and the Defendants\u2019 entitlement to payment from the Plaintiff. Consequently, the Defendants\u2019 closing submissions 61', 'arguing that the Plaintiff had not discharged the burden in proving anything was illicit about the OTE is with respect, completely off the mark. It was not the OTE that was illicit, but the Defendants\u2019 receipt of payments from the Plaintiff based on the OTE and other commission schemes that was illicit, according to the Plaintiff.', '83\\u2003The fact that Bala and\/or the Defendants treated Ice Mobile and the Plaintiff as one and the same does not detract from the fact that it is no answer to the position at law that the two are separate legal entities with the former a Malaysian and the latter a Singapore, registered company.', '84\\u2003During Ng\u2019s re-examination, 62', 'counsel for the Defendants referred him to a memorandum dated 15 August 2014 63', 'from Bala (as director and CEO of Ice Mobile) addressed to all employees of the sales team where he announced that the SCS would be implemented. Separately on 18 August 2014, 64', 'Bala had written to Ng to say the SCS for 2014 would be effective from 1 July 2014 and Ng\u2019s sales target was set at RM15,356,500. With respect, the implementation of the SCS in July 2014 of no relevance to the issues before the court.', '85\\u2003As mentioned at [59], Ng had suggested that Cindy, a middle-management employee of Ice Mobile, had requested for the Defendants to open the Singapore accounts in order for them to receive payments. However, to substantiate his claim, all that Ng could do was to point to the following email exchanges:', 'Apart from his say so, none of the above emails proved that Cindy was instrumental in Ng\u2019s (and Wong\u2019s) opening of the Singapore accounts. It bears noting that Cindy\u2019s salary and position in Ice Mobile were lower than Ng\u2019s. It was absurd of Ng, a director of Ice Mobile, to expect the court to believe his testimony that he reported to Cindy as she was the head of human resources, finance and billing. 66', '86\\u2003It was equally absurd for Wong to testify that the idea for the Plaintiff to pay him commission came from Cindy to which proposal Bala as the CEO had no objections and the Defendants went along with the proposal, 67', 'let alone that Cindy taught them to open the Singapore accounts.', '87\\u2003The court turns next to Wong\u2019s testimony. It would not be necessary to refer to Wong\u2019s AEIC as the facts therein stated were in line with Ng\u2019s AEIC. The court has already set out at [56] the identical paragraphs to be found in both Defendants\u2019 AEICs. As in Ng\u2019s case, Wong provided no particulars whatsoever of how Cindy instructed him to open the Singapore accounts in April 2010.', '88\\u2003In cross-examination, counsel for the Plaintiff (Mr Ari), took Wong through the findings in Wong\u2019s IAC proceedings. Questioned on his numerous admissions made in cross-examination therein that his performance was below par as well as the adverse findings made by the MIAC against him, Wong\u2019s repeated refrain was that his answers had been taken out of context. Indeed, on the court\u2019s inquiry, he went so far as to suggest that the MIAC made incorrect findings of fact. 68', '89\\u2003Despite his admissions in Wong\u2019s IAC proceedings that he failed to meet the sales targets set for him by Ice Mobile for the years 2011\u20132014, Wong insisted that his performance was not poor or lacked behind that of his sales colleagues as found by the MIAC. In fact, for 2014, it was found that Wong achieved only 42% of his sales target, which he admitted. 69', 'This was despite the fact that Kumar reduced Wong\u2019s sales targets whilst those of his colleagues were increased and yet they managed to achieve 70% of their targets. If his sales dropped, Wong blamed it on his customers such as Ericsson IPX who he claimed cut its volume of messaging traffic. 70', '90\\u2003 In re-examination, Wong sought to show 71', 'that his sales performance was not below par but matched that if not exceeded, his colleagues\u2019. He pointed out that the sales target for 2014 was only given to him late, in August 2014.', '91\\u2003Wong was cross-examined on Bala\u2019s email to him dated 24 April 2012 72', 'with the subject being the 2012 OTE applicable to him. The court has dealt at [65] with Ng\u2019s email from Bala which was in similar terms. Wong could not recall if he replied to that email in which Bala made the following offer to him :', 'Hence, Wong could not prove that he accepted Bala\u2019s above offer. Neither could he point to any document showing he made a counterproposal to Bala\u2019s offer. For Wong to \u2018deem\u2019 Bala\u2019s email as an arrangement for him to get his commission 73', 'does not advance his case at all.', '92\\u2003The 17 March email 74', '(set out at [64] above) was also relied on by Wong as the basis for his entitlement to the unauthorised commissions. The court will not repeat the Plaintiff\u2019s position set out at [65]\u2013[66] as to why that email cannot constitute a contract between the Plaintiff and the Defendants. The court would add that as in Ng\u2019s case, Wong agreed in answer to the court\u2019s question 75', 'that he did not have a contract of employment with the Plaintiff.', '93\\u2003Wong\u2019s evidence in re-examination that he served clients in Singapore 76', 'does not overcome the hurdle that he was unable to refer to any supporting documents that entitled him to commission payments from the Plaintiff.', '94\\u2003Bala was the Defendants\u2019 first witness. In his second affidavit filed on 29 November 2020 in support of the Defendants\u2019 applications in the two Summonses (see [36]), Bala had deposed 77', 'as follows:', '95\\u2003However, as noted earlier at [34], the Defendants failed to call Cindy to testify. No explanation was offered by the Defendants or their counsel for Cindy\u2019s absence from the trial. The court was also not told if any efforts had been made to procure her testimony by video-link from Kuala Lumpur.', '96\\u2003It should be noted again that the common testimony of the Defendants and Bala was that Cindy was primarily responsible for paying the unauthorised commissions. Yet, when the court questioned him, 78', 'Bala agreed that Cindy merely did the commission calculations for the Defendants, but it was he who decided their entitlement. In short, he authorised while Cindy implemented the commission payment scheme for the Defendants. This was a far cry from saying (as the Defendants repeatedly alleged), that Cindy was the decision maker when it came to their commission payment.', '97\\u2003Bala\u2019s explanation for the late filing of the two Summonses was that he only started looking for documentation when he was sued in Suit 1118 in November 2020 by the Plaintiff. He found documents in his old laptop which he initially thought no longer functioned.', '98\\u2003Bala\u2019s supplementary AEIC 79', '(as well as his affidavit filed for the two Summonses set out at [94]) was revealing. He deposed 80', 'therein that Laszlo 81', 'not Logan is the ultimate beneficial owner of Skantek (up to October 2013). He said Laszlo\u2019s shares in Skantek were held by Raj (Logan\u2019s brother-in-law) on Laszlo\u2019s not Logan\u2019s behalf. Bala added that Laszlo\u2019s status as a shareholder was acknowledged by Ramen in certain emails that Bala exhibited. Bala disclosed that Laszlo sold his shares in Skantek to Logan in or about October 2013, for which Logan did not pay, resulting in Laszlo suing Logan in Suit 1180 (see [38]).', '99\\u2003Since Laszlo owned Skantek, Bala deposed that as the CEO of the Ice Mobile group he reported to Laszlo not and never to Logan -- Laszlo entrusted him to run the group\u2019s business as he deemed fit.', '100\\u2003Bala claimed he did have discussions generally with Ramen on operations of the businesses of the Ice Mobile group which discussions included the finances of the group. He added that Ramen would have known of the commission scheme as it was not a secret. In the Plaintiff\u2019s audited accounts for the year 2011, the words \u201cstaff commission\u201d appeared as a separate item and Ramen had signed off those accounts. Laszlo would also have seen the annual accounts. Bala said Ramen had not raised objections to him about the commission scheme during his tenure as CEO.', '101\\u2003The court pointed out to Bala 82', 'that staff commission did not equate to sales commission (to which Bala conceded). Anyone looking at the accounts including Ramen would not know it related to any sales incentive scheme. Bala then claimed that in his several meetings with Ramen, they would talk about cashflow statements and which included commissions.', '102\\u2003Bala testified he was unable to refer to written communication with Laszlo as that was not Laszlo\u2019s style of working.', '103\\u2003During cross-examination, Bala explained his very late reference to Laszlo\u2019s ownership of Skantek with the excuse that there was no need to bring it up earlier until Logan claimed to be the rightful owner.', '104\\u2003The court does not doubt that Bala (as he testified) implemented the OTE commission scheme in Ice Mobile. What is relevant for the court\u2019s consideration is what was the basis for his implementing the scheme for the Plaintiff to include the Defendants who were not the Plaintiff\u2019s employees? The Plaintiff only had two employees namely, Bala himself and Wong\u2019s wife Allyce Kwong, whose services were terminated when Kumar became the CEO. It bears remembering that Bala\u2019s payment to himself US$512,000 is the subject of the Plaintiff\u2019s action against him in Suit 1118.', '105\\u2003 Laszlo was the Defendants\u2019 last witness. His AEIC contradicted Logan\u2019s 83', 'in regard to who was the actual owner of Skantek and Ramen\u2019s in regard to whether the board of directors of the Plaintiff was aware that the Defendants were being paid sales commission by the Plaintiff as well as by Ice Mobile. Nothing turns on other aspects of Laszlo\u2019s AEIC or his oral testimony. His evidence was aligned with the Defendants\u2019 and Bala\u2019s.', '106\\u2003The issues that the court needs to determine in this case are:', '(a)\\u2003Were the Defendants entitled to receive sales commission from the Plaintiff and retain the unauthorised commissions the Plaintiff seeks to recover?', '(b)\\u2003Did the Defendants (as the Plaintiff alleged) fraudulently and dishonestly justify the payments of the unauthorised commissions by claiming their entitlement was under their respective contracts of employment with Ice Mobile?', '(c)\\u2003Were the payments to the Defendants procured by way of an illicit arrangement which the Defendants had with Bala?', '(d)\\u2003Did the payments to the Defendants require the sanction of the board of directors of the Plaintiff?', '(e)\\u2003Were the Defendants unjustly enriched?', '107\\u2003It is not within the purview of this court nor is it necessary in the determination of the above issues for this court to decide whether Logan or Laszlo was the rightful owner of Skantek before October 2013.', '108\\u2003Where necessary the court will, in the course of its findings make reference to the parties\u2019 closing submissions and their further submissions. Ng and Wong filed identical submissions save that the paragraphs\u2019 numbering differed.', '109\\u2003It is common ground that there was no written agreement nor any correspondence or document emanating from the Plaintiff or Ice Mobile that gave the Defendants the right to be paid sales commission by the Plaintiff. Neither can it be disputed that at law, the two companies are separate legal entities. The fact that Bala as the common CEO chose to treat the two companies as one in the Ice Mobile group is not a valid counter to the legal position.', '110\\u2003The issue turns on whether Bala had the blanket mandate wearing the hat as the common CEO of both companies, to make the Plaintiff pay commission to the Defendants who were not its employees, for bulk sales of messenger services supposedly procured from non-Malaysian customers of the Defendants.', '111\\u2003Earlier at [72], Ng himself had acknowledged to the court that he did not have an employment contract with the Plaintiff. The court had also at [80] commented on the dearth of documentation in Ng\u2019s case and the other shortcomings in the Defendants\u2019 case which need not be repeated.', '112\\u2003As for Wong, the court too at [91]\u2013[93] has referred to the lack of any contractual documentation to support his entitlement to commission from the Plaintiff. The court had also pointed out at [64]\u2013[67], that Ng\u2019s and or the Defendants\u2019 reliance on certain email exchanges in their defences as evidence of contractual arrangements with the Plaintiff was misconceived.', '113\\u2003Although they indicated to the court they intended to, the Defendants did not call Cindy to testify. The Defendants had asserted that Cindy would have supported their case. 84', 'The burden of proof lies on the person who makes a positive assertion. That the Defendants ultimately chose not to call Cindy as witness is a negative factor that the court takes into consideration \u2013 it gives rise to an adverse inference under s 116(g) of the Evidence Act Cap 97, that had Cindy testified, her evidence would not have been favourable to the Defendants.', '114\\u2003As noted earlier at [59], the Defendants tried to suggest that Cindy was primarily responsible for the payment of the unauthorised commissions. However, despite their written and oral testimony, there was not a single document that the Defendants (nor Bala, for that matter) could rely on, which supported their claim that Cindy was the person who requested the Defendants to open the Singapore accounts, let alone that she was primarily responsible for paying the unauthorised commissions. Indeed, the court\u2019s observations at [75] and questioning of Bala at [96] showed such a suggestion to be completely baseless. Moreover, the Defendants\u2019 failure to procure Cindy as a witness at [95] spoke volumes of the credibility of such a suggestion.', '115\\u2003In the Plaintiff\u2019s closing submissions 85', 'for the First Suit, it highlighted the fact that even in Ng\u2019s contracts of employment, there was no reference to commission. The omission was noted in Ng\u2019s contract with Radius dated 27 October 2007, in his letter of confirmation dated 15 July 2008 and his letter of promotion dated 13 July 2009. The Plaintiff submitted an example of a formal contract would be the letter dated 15 January 2008 86', 'addressed to Ng from the then CEO Sorrentino setting out sales revenue target for 2008 which Ng had to achieve and which Ng indicated he agreed to by countersigning the document. Similarly, there was another letter dated 10 September 2009 87', 'addressed to Ng from the CEO Goh, setting out the sale revenue targets for 2009, which Ng signed to indicate his acceptance.', '116\\u2003The Plaintiff pointed out that in all the documents relating to sales incentives prior to 2011, there was also no element of guaranteed commissions. In Ng\u2019s cross-examination. 88', 'he had confirmed that there was no guaranteed commission even where there were formal documents relating to his commission entitlement.', '117\\u2003The court had earlier 89', 'set out the full text of the 17 March email from Bala to them which the Defendants contended was the contractual basis of their commission payments from the Plaintiff. The court does not accept the Defendants\u2019 contention \u2013 it is quite clear that the 17 March email is not a contract made between the Plaintiff and the Defendants as the requisite elements of offer and acceptance for a contract to be formed were absent. It is also to be noted that neither Ng nor Wong pleaded in their respective defences that there was a contract that governed their payment of commission from the Plaintiff. It is trite law that a party is bound by its pleadings.', '118\\u2003Moreover, in Ng\u2019s Malaysian suit, he had admitted during cross-examination that there was no basis for him to receive payments from the Plaintiff. 90', '119\\u2003The clauses in the Handbook that the Defendants rely on 91', 'do not help to advance their case further either. The Defendants had relied on the words \u201cwritten communication\u201d in cl 1.3 to say their employment contract would encompass the 17 March email. However, Kumar in his testimony 92', 'had explained that an email is a tool of communication and would not bind the Plaintiff and the Defendants to any form of agreement unless the email contained a PDF document which had a contract. As Kumar pointed out, there was no witness to the alleged agreement, no acceptance and no signatures in the 17 March email. Moreover, the Handbook was dated 1 January 2015 and hence was not in effect on 17 March 2011. The Defendants did not produce another handbook that was in effect in March\u2013April 2011.', '120\\u2003The Plaintiff\u2019s submissions cited several cases for the correct approach to find a contract exists based on a series of correspondence. These included Tribune Investment Trust Inc v Soosan Trading Co Ltd [2000] 2 SLR(R) 404 (\u201cTribune Investment\u201d), Gay Choon Ing v Loh Sze Ti Terence Peter [2009] 2 SLR(R) 332 and Chwee Kin Keong & Ors v Digilandmall.com Pte Ltd [2004] 2 SLR(R) 594.', '121\\u2003The Court of Appeal in Tribune Investment held that in the absence of a formal contract, 93', 'the existence of any contract must be inferred from the written correspondence and contemporaneous conduct of the parties at the material time. Further, the question of whether or not there was an intention by the parties to enter into a legally binding contract should be determined objectively. Applying these principles to the Defendants\u2019 case, the court has already observed at [66] that neither Ng nor Wong responded to the 17 March email so as to conclude a contract (if the email could be considered an offer capable of acceptance which the court does not believe to be the case).', '122\\u2003Moreover, as the Plaintiff\u2019s closing submissions pointed out, 94', 'the Defendants did not in their defences (or in their AEICs) assert that the court should pierce and lift the corporate veil to find that Ice Mobile and the Plaintiff were one single economic entity (as Bala\u2019s behaviour seemed to suggest) and should accordingly be so treated. The Plaintiff added that the concept of a single economic entity is fraught with difficulties in any case, citing Manuchar Steel Hong Kong Ltd v Star Pacific Line Pte Ltd [2014] 4 SLR 832.', '123\\u2003In the light of the court\u2019s observations that there was no contractual basis for the Defendants to have received the unauthorised commissions, the court\u2019s answer on the first issue listed at [106] must be \u201cNo\u201d.', '124\\u2003The court accepts the Defendants\u2019 closing submissions 95', 'that the standard of proof for fraud and dishonesty is very high and there must be compelling evidence proving such fraud and dishonesty.', '125\\u2003The court believes the Defendants\u2019 conduct was dishonest but not fraudulent in the legal sense. The Defendants cannot have assumed (wrongly) that they were entitled to be paid by the Plaintiff when they well knew they were not the Plaintiff\u2019s employees. The fact that they entrusted Bala to ensure they got paid and left it to him to make the necessary payment arrangements through Cindy does not exonerate them.', '126\\u2003The arrangement was illicit in the sense that Ng as a director of Ice Mobile, never made known the arrangement for payment of commission from the Plaintiff to the board of directors of Ice Mobile. Indeed, in answer to the court\u2019s question, 96', 'Ng agreed that there should have been a company resolution from Ice Mobile approving payment of commission to him from the Plaintiff. There was no documentation either between the two companies to the effect that Ice Mobile and the Plaintiff agreed to the commission arrangement let alone that Ice Mobile would reimburse the Plaintiff for the commissions paid to the Defendants.', '127\\u2003Bala also did not inform the boards of either Ice Mobile or the Plaintiff of the Defendants\u2019 receipt of the unauthorised commissions from the Plaintiff. It is also undisputed that neither Ng nor Wong have paid taxes on or declared the unauthorised commissions to either the Malaysian or Singapore tax authorities. The court disbelieves Ng\u2019s claim that he did not get round to declaring the same as his income. It was deliberate concealment by the Defendants to avoid paying income tax in both countries. Bala would have been privy to the Defendants\u2019 non-payment of income taxes. Such tax avoidance\/evasion on the Defendants\u2019 part is reprehensible.', '128\\u2003It cannot be disputed that the Plaintiff\u2019s payment of sums totalling S$308,484.24 to the Defendants required the sanction of the board of directors of the Plaintiff. Bala may be the Plaintiff\u2019s CEO but that did not as he seemed to think, give him a carte blanche to pay the Defendants such huge sums without at least informing the Plaintiff\u2019s other director(s) Ramen and\/or Logan, obtaining their approval and passing a board resolution to that effect. This was particularly so when the Plaintiff\u2019s revenue\/profits along with that of Ice Mobile (according to Kumar) 97', 'was steadily declining over the years since 2011-2012.', '129\\u2003The Defendants\u2019 closing submissions 98', 'stated that the following elements are required to found an action for unjust enrichment citing Singapore Swimming Club v Koh Sin Chong Freddie [2006] 3 SLR 845 (\u201cKoh Freddie\u201d):', '(a)\\u2003that the defendant has received a benefit or that an enrichment has been accrued to the defendant;', '(b)\\u2003that the benefit or enrichment is at the plaintiff\u2019s expense; and', '(c)\\u2003that the defendant\u2019s enrichment is unjust.', 'The Court of Appeal in Koh Freddie 99', 'cited its decision in Wee Chiaw Sek Anna v Ng Li-Ann Genevieve and Another [2013] 3 SLR 801 (\u201cWee Anna\u201d) for the above principles. In Wee Anna, the Court of Appeal 100', 'stated that in unjust enrichment, a claimant seeks recovery of the enrichment on the basis that the claimant should not be deprived of the benefit.', '130\\u2003Applying the three elements to this case, there is no doubt that the Plaintiff fulfils all three criteria.', '131\\u2003It cannot be disputed that the Plaintiff\u2019s payments to the Defendants were neither sanctioned nor authorised by its board of directors. There was no legal\/contractual basis for the payments. Apart from their say so, there was nothing before the court to prove the bulk messaging sales the Defendants purportedly made were concluded on the Plaintiff\u2019s behalf.', '132\\u2003For the Defendants to submit in their closing submissions 101', 'that there was no lack of consent on the Plaintiff\u2019s part is to completely ignore the evidence adduced from Ramen and Logan.', '133\\u2003The court has no doubt that Bala\u2019s testimony was consistent with the Defendants\u2019 so as to assist them and himself when the time comes for him to defend Suit 1118. Laszlo\u2019s evidence was also tailored to assist the Defendants and Bala. As stated earlier at [36], Laszlo was called as the Defendants\u2019 witness at the eleventh hour. The Plaintiff\u2019s submissions pointed out that 102', 'Bala and the Defendants put the blame on the absent Cindy as the person responsible for payment of the unauthorised commissions. Yet, at the last minute, instead of calling Cindy they called Laszlo to testify. The Defendants did a volte face and Bala then testified that the payments were known to and approved by Laszlo who gave him a carte blanche to run the Plaintiff\u2019s operations as Bala deems fit. As pointed out earlier at [96], Bala agreed with the court that Cindy took his instructions to pay the Defendant \u2013 she did not make the decision.', '134\\u2003As stated at [19], the High Court judgment dismissing Ng\u2019s claim was only received by the Plaintiff in August 2021. Upon receipt of the same, the Plaintiff applied to this court to file further submissions. The court acceded to the request and both parties filed their further submissions on 31 August 2021.', '135\\u2003The Plaintiff pointed out in its further submissions that the High Court judgment made specific findings of fact and law in respect of the issues in this case which this court should accept\/adopt.

As a director of Ice Mobile, Ng would have been able to produce documents to support the existence of an internal arrangement if the same existed. The Malaysian court opined Ng was not telling the truth;', '(c)\\u2003there were no documents that could show the existence of a sales commission scheme covering the years 2011\u20132013 and the period January\u2013June 2014;', '(d)\\u2003Ng was not an honest witness. He deliberately avoided treating the Plaintiff\u2019s payments as employment income giving rise to a conclusion that he was evading income tax, an offence in both Singapore and Malaysia;', '(e)\\u2003the Sessions court judge failed to appreciate the significance of the civil suit brought by the Plaintiff in Singapore against Ng to recover the sums paid to him on the basis that Ng received the sums fraudulently, dishonestly or wrongfully;', '(f)\\u2003Ng should have brought his claim for RM43,620 by way of a counterclaim in the Singapore action as all previous payments had been made by the Plaintiff and Singapore was the proper forum. His action was suspicious and gave rise to an ulterior motive on the part of Ng.', '136\\u2003The Plaintiff then went on in its further submissions to cite the law (and cases) on res judicata, recognition of a foreign judgment, issue estoppel and cause of action estoppel. In short, the Plaintiff wanted this court to give due weight to the High Court judgment.', '137\\u2003The Defendants on the other hand urged this court not to give any weight to the High Court judgment and submitted it should not influence the outcome of these proceedings. In brief, the Defendants\u2019 reasons were as follows:', '(a)\\u2003It would be premature to rely on the High Court judgment as it was not final \u2013 Ng had appealed against it to the Court of Appeal;', '(b)\\u2003the subject matter of the Sessions court and High Court Judgments was Ng\u2019s claim against Ice Mobile which is separate and distinct from the Plaintiff\u2019s claim against him in the First Suit; there are no overlaps;', '(c)\\u2003Ng\u2019s Malaysian suit involved issues of his resignation and his purported failure to collect payments which were matters not pleaded in the First Suit and are not before this court;', '(d)\\u2003although the subject matter of the First Suit, ie, the Plaintiff\u2019s claim against Ng, did not form the subject matter of Ng\u2019s Malaysian Suit, the Malaysian High Court made a finding that there was no evidence to justify payment of commission by the Plaintiff to Ng between 2011 and 2014;', '(e)\\u2003the Malaysian High Court took the view that the due diligence exercise undertaken by Kumar was important evidence even though the due diligence report itself was not evidence that was before the Malaysian proceedings; neither was it produced in these proceedings; and', '(f)\\u2003the Malaysian High Court had made adverse findings on Ng\u2019s character and credibility even though trial of his claim was conducted before the Sessions Court below.', '138\\u2003The Defendants submitted that any assessment of the credibility of Ng in these proceedings ought to be made based solely on the trial and evidence that was before this court. They added that no weight should be given to the Malaysian High Court\u2019s observations that the Sessions Court judge failed to understand the significance of the Plaintiff\u2019s two suits against the Defendants.', '139\\u2003Since this court finds in favour of the Plaintiff against both Defendants, there is no necessity in any event to rely on Ng\u2019s Malaysian Suit or the High Court judgment based on the principles of issue estoppel, res judicata and\/or the comity of nations.', '140\\u2003At this juncture, the court needs to address one more issue concerning Logan\u2019s status quo as the owner of Skantek. In the Defendants\u2019 closing submissions, 103', 'the Defendants argued that until 2013 Laszlo was the owner of Skantek and in turn the Plaintiff. Laszlo may well have been the owner of Skantek until 2013. What was also in evidence is he did sell his shares to Logan. The fact that Logan may not have paid Laszlo the full purchase price does not make Logan any less the owner. The court in Suit 1180 accepted that Logan owns Skantek and that Raj held the Skantek shares as Logan\u2019s trustee.'"}

{"casename":"2022_SGHC_226","fact":"'6\\u2003Sometime in August 2019, the defendant launched a new line of fans bearing the mark \u201cCO-FAN\u201d. 10', 'This, it bears noting, resembles the COFAN trade mark save for the hyphen between the syllables of the former mark. Central to the present dispute are the divergent narratives proffered by the plaintiff and the defendant for the formulation of their respective marks. Both parties claim to have conceptualized the \u201cCOFAN\u201d\/\u201cCO-FAN\u201d mark independently. I set out their respective explanations below.', '7\\u2003Mr Phua claims that after leaving the defendant to start the plaintiff, he chose the name \u201cTriple D\u201d as it was symbolic of his desire for the company to have at least three different \u201cbrands\u201d of products. The first of the trilogy of brands was the \u201cBESTAR\u201d trade mark, which was registered in the plaintiff\u2019s name on 3 July 2017. 11', 'Sometime in the latter half of 2018, Mr Phua and Mr Pang came up with the COFAN mark. In Mr Phua\u2019s view, the COFAN mark was felicitous for the following reasons: 12', '(a)\\u2003\u2018COFAN\u2019 was short for \u2018Colin\u2019s Fan\u2019. \u2018Colin\u2019 is Mr Phua\u2019s Christian name. The plaintiff avers that the inclusion of an element of Mr Phua\u2019s name in product branding was also consistent with its prior BESTAR mark, which incorporated Mr Phua\u2019s Chinese name (\u2018\u661f\u2019, which means \u2018star\u2019 in Chinese).', '(b)\\u2003Mr Pang felt that the first syllable of \u2018COFAN\u2019 could stand for \u2018cooperation\u2019. He thought this to be representative of the work dynamic within the plaintiff.', '8\\u2003Shortly after, the plaintiff applied for the registration of the COFAN trade mark on 27 February 2019 (the \u201cApplication\u201d). This, according to Mr Phua, was done in order to \u201creserve\u201d the mark before further preparations were made for its use. The Application received no objections and was accepted by the Trade Marks Registry (the \u201cRegistry\u201d) after the two-month period for filing opposition had lapsed. Mr Phua testified that it was after the opposition period that Mr Pang and him first made casual mention to industry counterparts that the plaintiff was planning to release fans bearing the COFAN mark to the market. However, Mr Phua explained that the plaintiff did not formally publicise nor apply the COFAN trade mark to its products as it was not ready for launch. Instead, the plaintiff was focused on building the BESTAR brand. 13', 'In this regard, capital for funding the COFAN brand came from the plaintiff\u2019s revenue from the sale of BESTAR products. 14', '9\\u2003The defendant\u2019s narrative, on the other hand, is that the idea for the CO-FAN mark sprung from Mr Quek and Mr Lim\u2019s strategy to diversify their business sometime in January 2016. 15', 'In particular, Mr Quek and Mr Lim testified that at that point in 2016, fans sold under the FANCO mark were powered by alternating current (\u201cAC\u201d), which was largely associated with a lower price range in the market. It was thus their hope that the defendant could enter the market for direct current (\u201cDC\u201d) fans, which could command a higher price as they were quieter and consumed less power. Mr Lim therefore developed the CO-FAN mark for the defendant\u2019s newly conceived DC fan product range by simply reversing the syllables of the defendant\u2019s FANCO mark. 16', '10\\u2003The defendant contends that Mr Phua learnt of Mr Quek and Mr Lim\u2019s idea to launch products bearing the CO-FAN mark on two occasions. The first was some time in February 2016, 17', 'when Mr Quek and Mr Lim shared their plans to sell fans bearing the CO-FAN mark with Mr Phua during an informal chat in the defendant\u2019s offices (the \u201cFebruary 2016 Meeting\u201d). The second instance was on 7 March 2016, 18', 'when Mr Quek and Mr Lim held a meeting in Mr Quek\u2019s office for a formal discussion of the plans to produce DC fans (the \u201cMarch 2016 Meeting\u201d). The March 2016 Meeting was allegedly attended by Mr Phua, Mr Lim, Mr Quek and Ms Claudia Fong (\u201cMs Fong\u201d), who is the defendant\u2019s human resource manager and Mr Quek\u2019s wife. Mr Quek\u2019s evidence is that, in the course of the March 2016 Meeting, it was decided that this new line of DC fans would bear the CO-FAN mark. In particular, the first \u201cmodel\u201d of fans with the CO-FAN mark would be named \u201cHELI\u201d. 19', 'The \u201cHELI\u201d mark was, in effect, a secondary product identifier of the fans bearing the CO-FAN mark (the \u201cHELI identifier\u201d). At that point, \u201cHELI\u201d had already been applied to goods that the defendant sold in Malaysia. 20', 'In support of these discussions, the defendant exhibits handwritten minutes of the March 2016 Meeting (the \u201cMinutes\u201d), 21', 'which the defendant alleges were taken contemporaneously by Mr Lim. 22', '11\\u2003The defendant also details the preparatory steps it took prior to launching fans bearing the CO-FAN mark. These preparatory steps are distilled as follows:', '(a)\\u2003Sometime in January 2017, the defendant engaged Qiangjing Lightning Electrical Co Ltd (\u201cQiangjing\u201d), a factory in China, as its manufacturer. Discussions were held with Qiangjing in order to refine and obtain the final prototypes for safety testing and eventual sale. These prototypes were shipped to Singapore sometime in 2018.', '(b)\\u2003On 9 November 2018, the defendant applied for \u201cCertificates of Conformity\u201d (\u201cCOCs\u201d) from T\u00dcV S\u00dcD PSB (\u201cPSB\u201d). PSB is a conformity assessment body (\u201cCAB\u201d) designated by the Consumer Protection Safety Authority (\u201cCPSA\u201d) to certify that certain products satisfy the applicable safety standards and requirements. In order to obtain the COCs, the defendant also submitted test certificates which certified that the prototypes were electrically fit-for-purpose (the \u201cTest Certificates\u201d).', '(c)\\u2003On 7 June 2019, PSB issued the COCs in relation to all fans which the defendant submitted applications for. Shortly after, the defendant\u2019s products were registered with CPSA on 11 June 2019. This enabled the defendant to affix its products with a \u201cSAFETY Mark\u201d. This was the final regulatory hurdle before the defendant could begin selling the fans.', '12\\u2003Following the aforementioned preparations, the defendant advertised and sold DC fans bearing the CO-FAN mark sometime in August 2019. These fans also bore the HELI identifier (hereinafter referred to as the \u201cCO-FAN HELI-marked fans\u201d). 23', 'Mr Phua testified that he learnt of the defendant\u2019s sale of fans bearing the CO-FAN mark sometime in late-2020. 24', '13\\u2003According to Mr Quek, it was only later in April 2021 that the defendant sought legal advice as to whether the CO-FAN mark could be registered as a trade mark. Mr Quek attributes the delay to his preoccupation with investigations by the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (\u201cIRAS\u201d) in relation to fraud by Mr Quek and the defendant (the \u201cIRAS Investigations\u201d). 25', 'This, Mr Quek avers, relegated the defendant\u2019s plans for obtaining trade mark registration for the \u201cCO-FAN\u201d mark to \u201clow priority\u201d. 26', 'It was at this time that the defendant learnt that the plaintiff was the registered proprietor of the COFAN trade mark. Shortly after, the defendant received a letter from the plaintiff\u2019s lawyers dated 27 April 2021 demanding that the defendant immediately cease its use of the CO-FAN mark (the \u201c27 April 2021 Letter\u201d). This was closely followed by another letter from the plaintiff\u2019s lawyers dated 30 April 2021 (the \u201c30 April 2021 Letter\u201d) which repeated the plaintiff\u2019s demands. It is undisputed that, after these letters were sent, the plaintiff proceeded to launch its own fans bearing the COFAN mark on 2 May 2021. These fans also bore the secondary product identifier \u201cHALI\u201d (the \u201cHALI identifier\u201d). I hereinafter refer to fans bearing the COFAN mark and HALI identifier as the \u201cCOFAN HALI-marked fans\u201d.', '14\\u2003On 24 May 2021, the plaintiff filed the present action claiming that the defendant\u2019s use of the CO-FAN mark infringed the plaintiff\u2019s registration for the COFAN mark. The defendant filed its defence and counterclaim on 21 June 2021, seeking invalidation of the COFAN mark on the ground of bad faith. It also seeks relief arising from the plaintiff\u2019s alleged groundless threats of trademark infringement.'"}

The grounds for \nterminating his employment were his alleged acts of insubordination and \nmisconduct. His case is that his employment was terminated in breach of \ncontract in order to suppress his attempts to expose internal wrongdoing.\n2 The plaintiff now brings this action against the defendants seeking \ndamages for: (a) failing to pay him his profit share in breach of his employment \ncontract; (b) inducing him to enter into his employment contract by fraudulent \nmisrepresentation; (c) terminating his employment in breach of contract; \n(d) conspiring to injure him by unlawful means, ie by terminating his \nemployment in breach of contract; (e) failing to pay him a post-termination \nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n2monthly indemnity in breach of contract; and (f) the stigma loss he has suffered \narising from the manner in which his employment contract was terminated.\n3 I dismiss all of the plaintiff\u2019s claims. The first claim is dismissed because \nit is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the relevant provision of his \nemployment contract. The second claim is dismissed: (a) because the plaintiff \nhas either fabricated or misunderstood the misrepresentations he alleges were \nmade to him; and (b) because even the plaintiff does not believe the allegations \nof fraud on which this claim rests. The third claim is dismissed because the \nplaintiff was indeed guilty of insubordination and misconduct justifying \nsummary termination of his employment. The fourth claim is dismissed because \nit is bereft of particulars and evidence and is completely baseless. The fifth claim \nis dismissed because the plaintiff failed to comply with an express contractual \ncondition precedent for him to receive the post-termination monthly indemnity. \nThe sixth and final claim is dismissed because there was no breach of any \nimplied term of mutual trust and confidence in the plaintiff\u2019s employment \ncontract.\n4 The defendants bring a counterclaim against the plaintiff seeking relief \nfor his breach of his obligations of confidentiality. I have allowed the \ncounterclaim but have ordered the plaintiff to pay only nominal damages of \n$1,000 for his breach.\n5 I now set out my reasons in full.\nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n3The parties\n6 The plaintiff was born in India, is a citizen of the Netherlands and resides \nin the United Kingdom.1\n7 The first defendant is the holding company of a group of companies in \nthe business of raising, investing and managing private equity funds. I shall refer \nto that group of companies as \u201cthe LCA Group\u201d. The LCA Group has its head \noffice in Singapore and is managed from Singapore. Member companies of the \nLCA Group are incorporated in several other jurisdictions, including Mauritius \nand Hong Kong. The first defendant is incorporated in Mauritius.\n8 The second defendant is a wholly owned subsidiary of the first defendant \nand therefore a member of the LCA Group. The second defendant is \nincorporated in Hong Kong.\n9 The third defendant is the founder of the LCA Group. He was, at all \nmaterial times, the managing partner and chairman of the LCA Group and the \nmanaging partner of the first defendant.\n10 The fourth defendant was, at all material times, a senior human resources \nexecutive in LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (\u201cLVMH\u201d). LVMH is a \nvery large and very successful multinational luxury goods conglomerate \nheadquartered in France.2\n1 The plaintiff\u2019s affidavit of evidence in chief (\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s AEIC\u201d) at para 1.\n2 Plaintiff\u2019s AEIC at para 7.\nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n4LVMH and the LCA Group\n11 LVMH is the sole shareholder of the first defendant. It is therefore the \nultimate holding company of the LCA Group and its ultimate owner. LVMH is \nalso a sponsor of the LCA Group\u2019s private equity funds and an investor in those \nfunds.3 LVMH therefore has a multi-tiered economic interest in the performance \nof the LCA Group and its funds.\n12 LVMH therefore has significant involvement in the LCA Group\u2019s \nmanagement. That is how the fourth defendant finds himself a defendant in this \naction. He was never a director or even an employee of the LCA Group. But as \na senior human resources executive at LVMH, he participated in the LCA \nGroup\u2019s decision to terminate the plaintiff\u2019s employment. The plaintiff \ntherefore claims that the fourth defendant is a conspirator who participated in a \nplot to injure the plaintiff by terminating his employment in breach of contract.\nDiscussions with the LCA Group in June 2011\n13 The possibility of the LCA Group employing the plaintiff arose for the \nfirst time in June 2011. That was when an executive search consulting firm \nknown as Spencer Stuart & Associates (Singapore) Pte Ltd (\u201cSpencer Stuart\u201d) \napproached the LCA Group on behalf of the plaintiff. The plaintiff and the third \ndefendant already knew each other as former colleagues.4 Spencer Stuart\u2019s \napproach led to a meeting between the plaintiff and the third defendant in \nMumbai.5\n3 Plaintiff\u2019s AEIC at para 7.\n4 Third Defendant\u2019s AEIC at paras 15 to 17.\n5 The third defendant\u2019s affidavit of evidence in chief dated 7 November 2020 (\u201cThird \nDefendant\u2019s AEIC\u201d) at paras 14.\nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n514 As a consequence of this meeting, the plaintiff met a senior LVMH \nexecutive, also in Mumbai.6 This senior executive was Mr Daniel Piette, a \nmember of LVMH\u2019s Executive Committee. Part of Mr Piette\u2019s role at LVMH \nwas to oversee LVMH\u2019s direct investment in funds, including those managed \nby the LCA Group. Mr Piette was therefore the LVMH executive to whom the \nthird defendant then reported. The third defendant then held a position in LVMH \nconcurrently with his position in the LCA Group, as LVMH\u2019s Group President \nfor Southeast Asia.7\n15 These meetings led to the LCA Group making a formal offer in June \n2011 to employ the plaintiff as its Regional Managing Director of Operations.8 \nThe plaintiff did not ultimately accept this offer. Instead, in July 2011, he \naccepted an offer of employment in India with a men\u2019s fashion internet start-up \ncalled Zovi.com.9 \nDiscussions with the LCA Group in February 2012\n16 Discussions about the plaintiff\u2019s possible employment with the LCA \nGroup resumed in January and February 2012, while plaintiff was still \nemployed by Zovi.com. The result of these discussions was that the LCA Group \nonce again made a formal offer to employ the plaintiff.10 This time, the plaintiff \naccepted.\n6 Third Defendant\u2019s AEIC at para 18; 10 February 2021 Transcript p 23 line 9 to p 24 \nline 18; CB 233\u2013242A.\n7 Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 2) dated 12 October 2020 (\u201cSOC\u201d) at para 5.\n8 CB 243\u2013248.\n9 CB 256.\n10 Third Defendant\u2019s AEIC at para 33; Gibert Ong\u2019s affidavit of evidence in chief dated \n2 January 2020 (\u201cOng\u2019s AEIC\u201d) at paras 30 to 31.\nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n617 In February 2012, the plaintiff ceased to be an employee of Zovi.com \nand became an employee of the LCA Group. He remained employed by the \nLCA Group until June 2015 when, as I have mentioned, his employment was \nterminated summarily.\n18 Three different members of the LCA Group employed the plaintiff in \nturn from February 2012 to June 2015 under three different contractual \narrangements. Apart from his primary place of work, the material terms of the \nplaintiff\u2019s employment, including his remuneration package, remained \nunchanged despite these changes of employer. Given that I have dismissed all \nof the plaintiff\u2019s claims, it is immaterial which company in the LCA Group was \nhis employer at any given time. For convenience, therefore, I shall refer to the \nplaintiff\u2019s employer throughout the entire period from February 2012 to June \n2015 simply as \u201cthe LCA Group\u201d.\nThe employer\/employee relationship breaks down\n19 The third defendant was the plaintiff\u2019s immediate superior officer \nthroughout the plaintiff\u2019s employment by the LCA Group. Their relationship \nwas initially uneventful,11 apart from the inevitable minor issues.\n20 In August 2014, their relationship came under serious strain. That was \nwhen a dispute arose between the plaintiff and the LCA Group about the correct \nconstruction of the formula in the plaintiff\u2019s employment contract by which to \ncalculate his entitlement to a share of the profit on the next fund which the LCA \nGroup raised. The dispute festered from August 2014 to May 2015. By June \n2015, there had been a complete breakdown in the relationship between \nemployer and employee and between immediate superior and subordinate. \n11Third Defendant\u2019s AEIC at para 58.\nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n721 As a result, the LCA Group terminated the plaintiff\u2019s employment \nsummarily for insubordination and misconduct on 29 June 2015. The LCA \nGroup took this step with the knowledge and support of LVMH.12\nThe plaintiff commences this action \n22 The plaintiff now brings this action seeking the following relief against \nthe defendants:\n(a) Damages for the LCA Group\u2019s breach of contract in failing to \npay him his share of the next fund which it raised. The plaintiff values \nthis claim at US$37.5m.13\n(b) Damages for the LCA Group\u2019s fraudulent misrepresentation, \nbeing the value of the share options at Zovi.com which the plaintiff gave \nup in order to accept employment with the LCA Group. The plaintiff \nvalues this claim at US$75m14 or US$3m.15\n(c) Damages for terminating the plaintiff\u2019s employment in breach of \ncontract. The plaintiff values this claim at just under US$112,000, being \nthe salary he would have earned during his six-month notice period.16\n(d) Damages for conspiring to injure the plaintiff by unlawful \nmeans, ie by terminating the plaintiff\u2019s employment in breach of \ncontract.

The plaintiff values this claim at US$43.3m.19\n23 The LCA Group rejects all of the plaintiff\u2019s claims in their entirety. I \nnow deal with each of the plaintiff\u2019s claims in turn. \nClaim 1: the plaintiff\u2019s profit share\n24 The plaintiff\u2019s first claim is that the LCA Group has failed to pay him \nhis share of the profit on the next fund raised by the first defendant, calculated \nin accordance with the formula set out in his employment contract. The parties \nhave referred to that next fund as \u201cFund II\u201d. I shall do the same.\n25 I note in passing that the plaintiff commenced this action even before \nthe LCA Group was obliged to calculate and pay to him his share of Fund II\u2019s \nprofit. In that sense, although the plaintiff does not plead it in this way, his first \nclaim is in substance a claim that the LCA Group committed an anticipatory \nbreach of his employment contract when it refused to accept his construction of \n17 PCS at paragraph 326(b). \n18 PCS at paragraph 326(c). \n19 PCS at paragraph 326(d). \nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n9the contractual formula. As nothing turns on this point, I need not analyse it \nfurther. \nFactual background\n26 When the plaintiff commenced his employment in February 2012, the \nLCA Group had just started raising funds from investors for Fund II. Fund II \nclosed in June 2014 with US$980m raised.20\n27 In August 2014, the plaintiff queried the construction of the formula by \nwhich his share of the profit on Fund II was to be calculated. The dispute over \nthe proper construction of that formula is the root cause of all of the unhappy \nevents which followed, including this litigation. It is therefore necessary to \nconsider now in more detail the three sets of contractual arrangements under \nwhich the LCA Group employed the plaintiff.\n28 From February 2012 to May 2012, the first defendant employed the \nplaintiff as its Managing Director. I shall refer to this employment contract as \n\u201cthe February 2012 Contract\u201d. From May 2012 to June 2014, the LCA Group\u2019s \nmember company in Mumbai21 employed the plaintiff. Concurrently, the LCA \nGroup\u2019s member company in Mauritius22 paid the plaintiff part of his \nremuneration package under a consultancy agreement with him. I shall refer to \nthese contracts collectively as \u201cthe May 2012 Contract\u201d. From June 2014 to \nJune 2015, the second defendant employed the plaintiff as its Managing \n20 The defendants\u2019 closing submissions dated 19 April 2021 at para 31.\n21 CB 398\u2013402.\n22 CB 365.\nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n10Director, Operations. I shall refer to this employment contract as \u201cthe June 2014 \nContract\u201d. \n29 The formula by which the plaintiff\u2019s share of the profit on Fund II was \nto be calculated was set out expressly in cl 3.1 of the February 2012 Contract.23 \nYou will be entitled to receive a gross basic remuneration of \nUSD 400,000.00 per annum paid monthly in arrears, in 12 \nequal instalments. You will be eligible for an annual \nperformance bonus targeting 100% of your gross annual base \nsalary subject to individual performance and business results \n\u2026 We also wish to confirm that you will be awarded 2.5% carry \nfor the next fund raised by [the first defendant].\u201d\n[Emphasis added]\nIt is not disputed that Fund II is \u201cthe next fund raised by [the first defendant]\u201d \nwithin the meaning this clause.\n30 From May 2012, the contractual formula by which the plaintiff\u2019s share \nof the profit on Fund II was to be calculated is set out in a letter (\u201cthe May 2012 \nLetter\u201d) which accompanied the May 2012 Contract.24 The language of the May \n2012 Letter is identical in all material respects to cl 3.1 of the February 2012 \nContract:\nDear Uday\nYou will be awarded 2.5% carry for the next Fund raised and \nmanaged by [the first defendant]. \nThe carry shares will be allocated to you in accordance with the \ncarried interest scheme of the next Fund.\n(Emphasis added)\n23 Ong\u2019s AEIC at para 46; CB 263 and 355.\n24 CB 418; DCB 84.\nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n1131 The June 2014 Contract is silent on the plaintiff\u2019s entitlement to a share \nof the profit on Fund II. However, the LCA Group does not argue that the June \n2014 Contract extinguished whatever contractual effect the May 2012 Letter \nmight have had with regard to the plaintiff\u2019s share of the profit on Fund II. I \ntherefore proceed on the basis that the May 2012 Letter remained in force as a \nterm of the plaintiff\u2019s employment contract throughout his employment under \nthe June 2014 Contract.\nThe parties\u2019 cases \n32 The critical phrase in both the February 2012 Contract and the May 2012 \nLetter is the phrase \u201c2.5% carry\u201d. The plaintiff\u2019s case is that this phrase must be \nconstrued in the context of the parties\u2019 prior negotiations and shared \nunderstanding at the material time to \u201crepresent 2.5% of gross profits\u201d.25\n33 In response, the LCA Group raises three broad points: \n(a) The May 2012 Letter is not enforceable: (i) because it was at \nmost a mere agreement to agree;26 (ii) because it lacks sufficient \ncertainty;27 or (iii) because it was subject to conditions precedent which \nwere never fulfilled.28\n(b) Even if the May 2012 Letter is enforceable, the plaintiff\u2019s \nconstruction of its contractual effect is wrong. The phrase \u201c2.5% carry\u201d \n25 SOC at paras 16(a) and 19(a); DWS at paragraph 83.\n26 DWS at paras 60 to 63.\n27 DWS at paras 64 to 69.\n28 DWS at paras 70 to 72.\nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n12refers to 2.5% of the LCA Group\u2019s share of the profit on Fund II and not \nto 2.5% of what the plaintiff calls the \u201cgross profits\u201d of Fund II.29\n(c) Even if the plaintiff\u2019s construction is correct, Fund II failed to \ngenerate sufficient returns over its lifetime to yield any profit at all, \nthereby leaving the plaintiff with at best only a claim for nominal \ndamages for breach of contract.30\n34 It is convenient to take the final point first. \nFund II did not yield a profit\n35 The plaintiff and his expert both accept31 that Fund II lost substantial \nmoney for its investors. Its net internal rate of return from inception to \nSeptember 2020, just a few months before trial, was negative 11% per annum.32 \nAs things stand, it is virtually impossible for Fund II, given the limited time \nremaining of its lifespan, to recover these losses and generate a profit for \ninvestors and the LCA Group. The plaintiff and his expert all but accept this.33\n36 I therefore take it that the plaintiff\u2019s share of the profit on Fund II, by \nwhatever formula it may be calculated, is zero. As such, even if I were to decide \nthis first claim entirely in the plaintiff\u2019s favour, he would be entitled only to \n29 Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No. 2) dated 26 October 2020 (\u201cD&CC\u201d) at \nparas 7\u20139. \n30 DWS at paras 111 to 114.\n31 3 February 2021 Transcript at p 99 line 9 to p 101 line 8; 4 February 2021 Transcript \nat p 155 line 21 to p 157 (line 11).\n32 AB 5731.\n33 3 February 2021 Transcript at p 99 line 9 to p 101 line 8; 4 Febrary 2021 Transcript at \np 155 line 21 to p 157 line 11.\nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n13nominal damages. In that sense, determining the first claim could be said to be \nof little substantive importance.\n37 Despite this, I will proceed to determine the proper construction of the \nphrase \u201c2.5% carry\u201d. I do this for two reasons. First, that issue of construction \nis fundamental to the resolution of the plaintiff\u2019s remaining claims. It is \nimpossible to assess the quality of the parties\u2019 conduct after August 2014 \nwithout forming a view on whose position on the construction of \u201c2.5% carry\u201d \nwas correct. Second, even if it is correct that the plaintiff is entitled only to \nnominal damages, that would still mean a victory for him on this claim, albeit a \ntechnical one. That could have a significant bearing on the award of the costs of \nthis claim, and perhaps even of the entire action.\n38 I therefore analyse the first claim only in order to determine the proper \nconstruction of the phrase \u201c2.5% carry\u201d. In my view, for the reasons which \nfollow, the LCA Group\u2019s construction is undoubtedly correct and the plaintiff\u2019s \nis fundamentally wrong. The phrase \u201c2.5% carry\u201d means 2.5% of the LCA \nGroup\u2019s share of the profit on Fund II and not 2.5% of the \u201cgross profits\u201d on \nFund II.\nThe contextual approach\n39 The parties are in agreement that I must construe the phrase \u201c2.5% \ncarry\u201d using the contextual approach. The contextual approach requires me to \nascertain the parties\u2019 objective intention at the time they entered into the \ncontract, taking as my starting point the parties\u2019 text and construing that text in \nlight of its context, provided that that context is clear, obvious and known to \nboth parties: Zurich Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior Design & \nConstruction Pte Ltd [2008] 3 SLR(R) 1029 at [125], [128]\u2013[129]; Crescendas \nBionics Pte Ltd v Jurong Primewide Pte Ltd [2019] SGHC 4 at [104].\nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n14The text\n40 I start with the text, ie the phrase \u201c2.5% carry\u201d. Construing this phrase \nrequires me to construe its three aspects: (a) the meaning of \u201c2.5%\u201d; (b) the \nmeaning of \u201ccarry\u201d; and (c) the arithmetic relationship between \u201c2.5%\u201d and \n\u201ccarry\u201d.\n2.5%\n41 There can be no dispute as to the meaning of \u201c2.5%\u201d. It is a fraction \nexpressed as a percentage. Expressing a fraction as a percentage is a device to \nmake it easier to compare fractions with different denominators. The symbol \n\u201c%\u201d indicates merely that the figure preceding it must be divided by one \nhundred to arrive at the decimal equivalent of the fraction. Expressing 2.5% as \na decimal therefore simply requires dividing 2.5 by 100. Thus, 2.5% can be \nexpressed as a decimal and then as an irreducible fraction as follows: 2.5\n100\n = 0.025 = 1\n40.\nCarry\n42 On the meaning of \u201ccarry\u201d, the expert evidence on both sides was \nconsistent. \u201cCarry\u201d or \u201ccarried interest\u201d34 means 20% of a fund\u2019s profit. A \nfund\u2019s profit is what remains after its costs have been paid, after investors have \nreceived their capital back and after investors have received an agreed rate of \nreturn on that capital. The carry (C) of a fund with profit (P) can therefore be \nexpressed as follows: \ud835\udc36= 20\n100\u00d7\ud835\udc43= 0.2 \u00d7\ud835\udc43=20% \u00d7\ud835\udc43. \n34 Goodson\u2019s Expert Report at para 15, para 20; Jonathan Robinson\u2019s Expert Report dated \n6 November 2020 (\u201cRobinson\u2019s Expert Report\u201d) at para 21; 19 February 2021 \nTranscript at p 5 line 24 to p 6 line 3; 4 February 2021 Transcript at p 33 lines 3\u201312 to \np 40 lines 3\u201310, p 47 lines 9\u201314, p 99 lines 19\u201324, p 173 lines 1\u20135.\nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n1543 To make the analysis which follows easier to understand, it is useful now \nto postulate a highly simplified example adopting the customs and practices in \nthe private equity industry as established at trial by the expert evidence on both \nsides.\n44 Assume the following. A fund manager proposes a private equity fund \nto investors. The fund is to have a lifespan of exactly one year. The fund \nmanager is entitled to retain 20% of the fund\u2019s profit at the end of that year. But \nthe fund manager will have no right to retain that 20% unless investors are first \nrepaid 100% of their capital plus a rate of return on that capital at 8% per annum \nover the lifespan of the fund. \n45 Now assume that the fund manager receives capital of $100 on 1 January \n2022 from investors. He invests the $100 on the same day in a single investment. \nFrom 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2022, the investment generates no income \nand the fund manager makes no distributions to investors. On 31 December \n2022, the fund manager sells that single investment for $238. The fund\u2019s total \ncosts over its one-year lifespan amount to $30, all of which are unpaid. That $30 \nincludes the fund manager\u2019s fees and expenses and the costs of acquiring, \nholding and selling that single investment. \n46 On 1 Jan 2023, therefore, the fund manager holds $238. He distributes \nthat $238 as follows. First, he pays the fund\u2019s costs of $30. That leaves $208. \nSecond, he returns to the investors $100, being the capital they paid in at \ninception. That leaves $108. Third, he pays investors $8.00, being the agreed \nrate of return over the one year on their capital of $100. That leaves $100. Out \nof that $100, the fund manager pays $80 to investors as their agreed share of the \nfund\u2019s profit. The fund manager retains the remaining $20 as the fund manager\u2019s \nagreed share of the fund\u2019s profit. \nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n1647 In this example, the total amount which investors receive from the fund \non 1 January 2023 is $188 ($100 + $8 + $80). That is equivalent to investors \nearning a return of 0.88 times their initial investment of $100. This fund would \nthen be said to have generated a multiple of 1.88x for investors. That means that \nits investors\u2019 total pay-out at the end of the fund\u2019s lifespan ($188) is 1.88 times \nthe capital they paid in on the fund\u2019s inception ($100).\n48 The 20% share of the fund\u2019s profit which the fund manager retains in \nthe final step is what is known in the industry as the \u201ccarry\u201d or the \u201ccarried \ninterest\u201d. The 8% rate of return which the fund manager had to earn for investors \nin order to be entitled to the carry is known as the \u201churdle rate\u201d. These two rates \n\u2013 8% for the hurdle rate and 20% for the carry \u2013 are industry standards.\n49 The fund in this example would be said to have generated a carry of $20 \nfor the fund manager. It is customary in the industry in certain contexts to view \nand refer to the carry as a \u201ccarried interest pool\u201d comprising 20 points. In my \nexample, therefore $1 of carry in the fund manager\u2019s hands represents $1 out of \n$100 or 1% of the fund\u2019s profit. The same $1 is also viewed as representing one \npoint out of 20 points in the carried interest pool, or 5% of the carry. This is \nwhat gives rise to the factor of five between the parties\u2019 competing constructions \nof the phrase \u201c2.5% carry\u201d.\nArithmetic relationship between \u201c2.5%\u201d and \u201ccarry\u201d\n50 All that remains now is to construe the arithmetic relationship between \n\u201c2.5%\u201d and \u201ccarry\u201d expressed by the phrase \u201c2.5% carry\u201d. The plaintiff submits \nthat the relationship is one of division. The LCA Group submits that the \nrelationship is one of multiplication. The plaintiff\u2019s construction would, in my \nexample, entitle him to $2.50, leaving $17.50 in the carried interest pool. The \nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n17LCA Group\u2019s construction, in my example, would entitle him only to $0.50, \nleaving $19.50 in the carried interest pool.\n51 I have no hesitation in rejecting the plaintiff\u2019s submission. It is a \ndisingenuous and contrived submission, completely divorced from basic \narithmetic.\n52 Expressing the plaintiff\u2019s construction as an arithmetic formula yields \nthe following:  2.5\n100 \u00f7 20\n100 = 2.5\n100 \u00d7 100\n20 = 250\n2000= 0.125 =12.5% . On this \nbasis, the plaintiff claims that the phrase \u201c2.5% carry\u201d entitles him to 12.5% of \nthe carry on Fund II. Going back to my example, $2.50 is 2.5% of $100, but is \n12.5% of $20.\n53 The LCA Group submits that the plaintiff\u2019s arithmetic is fundamentally \nflawed in that it is meaningless to calculate the plaintiff\u2019s share by using a ratio \nof percentages, ie, 2.5% \u00f7 20%  or 2.5%\n20%.35 I accept this submission. In fact, the \nplaintiff\u2019s arithmetic contains three fundamental and related errors, which \namount in combination to arithmetic sleight of hand. The first fundamental error \nis that the operation of multiplication is associative but the operation of division \nis not. The second fundamental error is that the 20% or 20\n100 by which the plaintiff \ndivides 2.5% or 2.5\n100 in his arithmetic is not an abstract figure but is a percentage \nof another number. That in turn implies a multiplication operation which is \nmissing in the plaintiff\u2019s arithmetic. Because division is not associative, that \nmissing multiplication operation means that it is arithmetically wrong as a first \nstep to divide 2.5\n100 by 20\n100. The third fundamental error is that that missing number \n35 4 February 2021 Transcript at p 113 line 25 to p 115 line 24.\nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n18which is to be multiplied by 20\n100 is Fund II\u2019s profit (P), and not Fund II\u2019s carry \n(C).\n54 Therefore, even if I were to accept the plaintiff\u2019s submission that the \nphrase \u201c2.5% carry\u201d implies the arithmetical relationship of division between \n\u201c2.5%\u201d and \u201ccarry\u201d, the correct formula to express that construction (bearing in \nmind that division is not associative and that \u201ccarry\u201d is 20% of profit) is 2.5\n100 \u00f7\n 20\n100 \u00d7 \ud835\udc43= 2.5\n100 \u00f7 20 \u00d7 \ud835\udc43\n100= 2.5\n100 \u00d7100\n20 \u00d7 \ud835\udc43=2500\n2000 \u00d7 \ud835\udc43= 5\n4 \u00d7 \ud835\udc43. As the \nLCA Group submits, this is arithmetic nonsense. This is also commercial and \ncontractual nonsense. More importantly, this is not the result which the plaintiff \nhimself advocates: 12.5\n100 \u00d7 \ud835\udc36 or 2.5\n100 \u00d7 \ud835\udc43\n55 The plaintiff\u2019s submission in fact amounts to equating the industry term \n\u201ccarry\u201d ($20 in my example) with what he calls \u201cgross profits\u201d (GP) ($100 in \nmy example). That would be expressed arithmetically as follows: 2.5% \u00d7\n \ud835\udc36= 2.5% \u00d7 \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc43 = 2.5\n100 \u00d7 \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc43. But that is not how the plaintiff puts his case: \nhis case is that the arithmetic operation between \u201c2.5%\u201d and \u201ccarry\u201d (which he \nconstrues to mean \u201cgross profits\u201d) is division, not multiplication. Further, \ninsofar as this submission construes \u201ccarry\u201d as being equivalent to \u201cgross \nprofits\u201d, or what I have called simply profit, the expert evidence on both sides \nis consistent that that is not the meaning of \u201ccarry\u201d in the private equity industry. \n\u201cCarry\u201d means the fund manager\u2019s share of a fund\u2019s profit, customarily 20%, \nand not the entirety of the fund\u2019s profit.\n56 The alternative is that the plaintiff\u2019s submission amounts to construing \nthe symbol \u201c%\u201d as meaning \u201cpoints of\u201d such that \u201c2.5% carry\u201d means \u201c2.5 \nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n19points of carry\u201d. There is no basis for construing the symbol \u201c%\u201d in this way. It \ndenotes, without any ambiguity, a fraction or a ratio and not an absolute number. \n57 In my view, \u201c2.5% carry\u201d is the linguistic equivalent of \u201c2.5% of carry\u201d. \nThe natural reading of the phrase \u201c2.5% carry\u201d is that it holds the word \u201cof\u201d, \nunstated but understood, between \u201c2.5%\u201d and \u201ccarry\u201d. That unstated preposition \nindicates to me nothing but the arithmetic relationship of multiplication. Thus, \nin my view, the phrase \u201c2.5% carry\u201d properly construed means that the plaintiff \nwas entitled contractually to 2.5% of the carry on Fund II. That is the arithmetic \nequivalent of 0.5% of Fund II\u2019s profit: 2.5\n100 \u00d7 \ud835\udc36= 2.5\n100 \u00d7 20\n100 \u00d7 \ud835\udc43= 50\n10000\n \u00d7 \ud835\udc43 = 0.5\n100 \u00d7 \ud835\udc43=0.5% \u00d7\ud835\udc43=0.5% \ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc53 \ud835\udc43 . Thus, in my example, the \nplaintiff\u2019s share of the carry on this construction would indeed be $0.50, as the \nLCA Group submits, and not $2.50 as the plaintiff submits. \nThe expert evidence\n58 The plaintiff called two expert witnesses on different aspects of the \nprivate equity industry: Mr Peter Goodson and Mr Frank Carr. Although both \nexperts claimed to support the plaintiff\u2019s arithmetic, both were unable to justify \nthat support under cross-examination. Mr Goodson agreed that, in my example, \nthe phrase \u201c50% carry\u201d would mean $10 and that the phrase \u201c10% carry\u201d would \nmean $2. He then had to accept that the phrase \u201c2.5% carry\u201d had to mean $0.50 \nand not $2.50 because \u201c2.5% carry\u201d had to be less than \u201c10% carry\u201d.36 Mr Carr \naccepted that, in my example, \u201c2.5% carry\u201d would be $0.50 out of the $20 and \nthat $2.50 out of the $20 would be \u201c2.5 points of carry\u201d and not \u201c2.5% carry\u201d.37\n36 4 February 2021 Transcript at p 113 line 25 to p 115 line 24 and p 118 lines 4\u201323.\n37 4 February 2021 Transcript at p 149 line 1 to p 150 line 17.\nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n2059 The plaintiff\u2019s case amounts to construing the phrase \u201c2.5% carry\u201d as \nmeaning \u201c2.5% of the profit\u201d or \u201c2.5 points out of the carry\u201d. For the reasons I \nhave given, I am satisfied that the text of that phrase construed in accordance \nwith the customs and practices of the private equity industry does not support \nthe plaintiff\u2019s construction. I therefore now turn to consider the context.\nThe context\n60 There is equally nothing in the context which supports the plaintiff\u2019s \nconstruction. Indeed, in my view, the context in fact supports the LCA Group\u2019s \nconstruction.\nThe June 2011 estimate\n61 The LCA Group\u2019s construction of the phrase \u201c2.5% carry\u201d is consistent \nwith an estimate of the plaintiff\u2019s share of the carry of Fund II which Mr Gilbert \nOng sent to Spencer Stuart by email in late June 2011. Mr Ong was the LCA \nGroup\u2019s Chief Financial Officer at the material time. Mr Ong\u2019s email is the \nearliest occasion in the evidence before me on which any of the parties used the \nphrase \u201c2.5% carry\u201d.\n62 In his estimate, Mr Ong assumed that Fund II, like its predecessor Fund \nI, would raise US$635.5m from investors and would generate a multiple of 2.5x \nor 250%. That means that Fund II would earn enough to return 100% of the \ninvestors\u2019 capital to them plus an additional 150% of their capital. On those \nassumptions, he projected that \u201c2.5% carry\u201d would translate to US$4.77m for \nthe plaintiff:38 \n2.5% carry on next Fund. Based on current Fund size and \nprojection of returns, it will be worth US$4.77m. We are \n38 CB 259; Ong\u2019s AEIC at paras 20-21.\nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n21expecting to raise a larger fund in the next round and hence the \nnumber is expected to be larger.\u201d\n63 Mr Ong does not set out in this email how he arrived at the estimate of \nUS$4.77m as the plaintiff\u2019s share of the carry on Fund II. But Mr Ong was a \nwitness at trial and explains his working in his affidavit of evidence in chief. A \n2.5x fund which raised US$635.5m in investors\u2019 capital would leave the fund \nmanager holding 2.5 times US$635.5m or US$1,588.75m at the end of the \nfund\u2019s lifespan. On Mr Ong\u2019s assumptions, the investors\u2019 capital of US$635.5m \nis first returned to investors out of that sum. That leaves US$953.25m, being 1.5 \ntimes US$635.5m. The fund\u2019s costs and hurdle rate have been accounted for in \nthe selection of 2.5x as the multiple and need not be deducted separately. The \ncarry would therefore be 20% of US$953.25m or US$190.65m. The plaintiff\u2019s \nshare, being \u201c2.5% carry\u201d, would be 2.5% of US$190.65m or US$4,766,250. \nRounded off to two decimal places, that is Mr Ong\u2019s figure of US$4.77m.\n64 The plaintiff\u2019s own expert, Mr Carr, accepted that, on these assumptions, \nthe estimate of US$4.77m in Mr Ong\u2019s email was an estimate of 2.5% of the \ncarry on Fund II and not an estimate of 2.5% of the \u201cgross profit\u201d or the profit \nof Fund II.39\n65 Mr Ong\u2019s email legitimately forms part of the context against which the \nphrase \u201c2.5% carry\u201d is to be construed. Although this email was not addressed \nto the plaintiff, he accepts that he saw this email at that time.40 It was therefore \nknown to both parties. I further accept that the plaintiff knew Fund I\u2019s size in or \naround June 2011. The third defendant testified at trial that he had told the \n39 4 February 2021 Transcript at p 151 line 12 to p 153 line 24.\n40 CB 259; 27 January 2021 Transcript at p 33 lines 8\u201310, p 36 lines 6\u201311, p 41 line 25 \nto p 42 line 4.\nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n22plaintiff of Fund I\u2019s size.41 I accept also that third defendant gave the plaintiff \nthe \u201cfull background\u201d on Fund I before the meeting between the plaintiff and \nMr Piette in June 2011.42 \n66 Mr Ong\u2019s estimate of \u201c2.5% carry\u201d and the assumptions underlying it \nwere therefore known to both the LCA Group and to the plaintiff as early as \nJune 2011. All of this is inconsistent with the plaintiff\u2019s case as to context and \na \u201cshared understanding\u201d of the meaning of the phrase \u201c2.5% carry\u201d in the May \n2012 Letter.\nIndustry norms\n67 I am also satisfied that an award to the plaintiff of a share of the carry \non Fund II of 12.5% would have been wholly contrary to industry norms. The \nplaintiff\u2019s case is that his share of the carry on Fund II was worth US$37.5m. \nAlternatively, calculating the plaintiff\u2019s share of the carry according to the \nplaintiff\u2019s formula but based on Mr Ong\u2019s assumptions in his June 2011 email \nwould yield five times Mr Ong\u2019s US$4.77m figure or US$23.83m. The \nevidence before me establishes that it would have been wholly contrary to \nindustry norms for the LCA Group to have awarded a share of the carry of that \norder of magnitude to someone with the plaintiff\u2019s experience in private equity \nand for someone performing the plaintiff\u2019s role in the LCA Group.\n68 The plaintiff had no private equity experience when he accepted \nemployment with the LCA Group. It is true that he is highly educated and holds \na Masters in Business Administration from Insead, a leading international \n41 10 February 2021 Transcript p 40 line 23 to- p 41 line 3, p 43 lines 16\u201317, p 169 line \n14 \u2013 p 170 line 4.\n42 CB 229.\nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n23business school. It is also true that he had held very senior executive positions \nbefore joining the LCA Group. But it is equally true that his exposure to the \nprivate equity industry before then was either purely academic (as part of his \nbusiness school curriculum) or from the other side (as a senior executive of a \nprivate equity fund\u2019s investee company).43 Further, he had no experience in \ninvesting and deal-making.\n69 Further, once the joined the LCA Group, the plaintiff was primarily an \noperations professional, albeit the most senior one. He had only limited \ninvolvement in portfolio management. He was not a sponsor, a founder or an \ninvestment professional.\n70 Persons of the plaintiff\u2019s experience and involvement do not customarily \nreceive awards of carry of the order of magnitude of 12.5%. The plaintiff\u2019s \nexpert, Mr Carr, is an expert on executive compensation in the private equity \nindustry. His expert report cites and exhibits a paper by Ms Amanda Persaud, a \npartner in the asset management group of a Wall Street law firm. The title of \nMs Persaud\u2019s paper is \u201cPrivate Equity Carried Interest Arrangements: A \nBusiness Perspective\u201d. Both Mr Goodson and Mr Carr were cross-examined on \nMs Persaud\u2019s paper. Her paper contains a statement of industry norms for the \nallocation of a share of carry to a list of recipient classes. Each recipient class \nin her list typically deserves and receives a smaller share of the carry than the \nclass above it. Operations professionals such as the plaintiff are in the lowest \n43 27 January 2021 Transcript at p 34 lines 6\u201316 and p 35 lines 11\u201324.\nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n24class. The plaintiff was at best in the lower tier of the second recipient class or, \nmore likely, in the third recipient class. As Ms Persaud says:44 \nRecipient Classes\nAt the top are founders, many of whom have extensive deal \nnetworks, are responsible for investor relationships and serve \nas chairpersons or CEOs of the sponsor. Founders tend to take \na sizeable portion of carried interest relative to others, and in \nthe case of sponsors with multiple founders who are actively \ninvolved in the business, this can sometimes amount to over \n50% of total carried interest.\nSenior investment professionals of a sponsor actively source, \nmanage and sit on the boards of portfolio companies. These \nindividuals take the next largest share of the carried interest \npool. Other investment professionals, such as vice presidents \nand associates, who assist in analyzing and managing deals, \ngenerally receive smaller shares of carried interest.\nToday, many sponsors also set aside carried interest for senior \noperations professionals, such as the general counsel, chief \noperating officer and chief financial officer. As sponsors \nfundraise and operate in a more regulated environment, it is \nnot uncommon for the head of investor relations and the chief \ncompliance officer to also receive a share of carried interest.\nMr Goodson\u2019s evidence is consistent with this. \n71 The LCA Group\u2019s expert on executive compensation in the private \nequity industry is Mr Jonathan Robinson. He produced a report on the norms \nfor executive compensation for Asian private equity funds.45 I accept that \nevidence. According to Mr Robinson\u2019s report, the norm is 1.4% to 5.1% for \nsomeone with the plaintiff\u2019s experience and performing the plaintiff\u2019s role.46 \nThat range is perfectly consistent with a 2.5% share of the carry. The plaintiff\u2019s \nclaim to a 12.5% share of the carry is outside the range by an order of magnitude.\n44 CB 3285-3289; Frank Carr\u2019s Expert Report dated 6 November 2020 (\u201cCarr\u2019s Expert \nReport\u201d) at para 58(d) and p 391 (Exhibit P).\n45 CB 3566\u20133672 and 3778\u20133793.\n46 Robinson\u2019s Expert Report at paras 42\u201343.\nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n2572 None of this evidence was satisfactorily addressed by the plaintiff\u2019s \nexpert witnesses. Mr Goodson was not an expert on executive compensation \nand did not address the issue at all. Mr Carr included market data from a \ndifferent market with different norms, ie, North America, and addressed the \nissue from the perspective of a loss of compensation. In any event, Mr Carr\u2019s \nmarket data on compensation in the Asia Pacific region does not support a share \nof the carry of the order of magnitude of 12.5%.47 \n73 I also accept the LCA Group\u2019s submission that the plaintiff\u2019s claim of a \n12.5% share of the carry is extremely high, given that three sponsors and 14 or \n15 executives in recipient classes higher than the plaintiff\u2019s were all awarded a \nshare of Fund II\u2019s carry.48 This makes it implausible that the LCA Group would \nhave awarded the plaintiff as much as 12.5% of the carry on Fund II. \n74 I therefore accept the LCA Group\u2019s submission that it would have been \ncompletely contrary to industry norms for the LCA Group to have awarded \n12.5% of the carry on Fund II \u2013 or anything of that order of magnitude \u2013 to the \nplaintiff. \nThe plaintiff\u2019s preference for security over risk\n75 Finally, it is not in dispute that the plaintiff told the third defendant \nduring the precontractual negotiations over his remuneration package that he \nvalued security of future income most. He therefore preferred a higher base \nsalary and a higher bonus target over a higher share of carry. That is why cl 3.1 \nof the February 2012 Contract weighted the plaintiff\u2019s remuneration package \ntowards salary and bonus rather than carry, giving him a fixed salary of \n47 CB 3418\u20133445;\/ Carr\u2019s Expert Report at p 891 (Exhibit W).\n48 Robinson\u2019s Expert Report at paras 46\u201347; CB 793\u2013795 at paras 4.1 and 4.3.\nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n26US$400,000 per annum and an annual performance bonus targeting 100% of \nhis fixed salary (see [ 29] above). The evidence at trial established that the \nplaintiff\u2019s base remuneration placed him as high as the 75th percentile for \nexecutives in the private equity industry in the Asia Pacific region.49 \n76 All of this is entirely consistent with an award of 2.5% of the carry on \nFund II and entirely inconsistent with an award of 12.5% of the carry on Fund \nII.\nNo shared understanding\n77 Part of the plaintiff\u2019s case as to the context for interpreting the phrase \n\u201c2.5% carry\u201d rests on an understanding said to be shared by him and the LCA \nGroup that that phrase would mean \u201c2.5% of the gross profits\u201d of Fund II. As \nevidence of that shared understanding, the plaintiff points to four \nrepresentations which the LCA Group made to the plaintiff in 2011 and 2012.\n78 These representations are also central to the plaintiff\u2019s claim in \nfraudulent misrepresentation. For the reasons set out at [ 87]\u2013[ 121] below, I find \nthat the plaintiff misunderstood two of the representations and has testified \nfalsely that the other two representations were made. As those representations \nwere either misunderstood or never made, they are incapable of giving rise to \nany shared understanding between the plaintiff and the LCA Group which forms \nany part of the context for construing the phrase \u201c2.5% carry\u201d.\n49 CB 3566\u20133672, Robinson\u2019s Expert Report at Annex C, Tab 1\nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n27Conclusion on the first claim\n79 For all of these reasons, I reject the plaintiff\u2019s case on the proper \nconstruction of the phrase \u201c2.5% carry\u201d. The construction which the LCA \nGroup advances is the correct construction, being consistent with both the text \nand the context and with industry usages and norms. That being so, there is no \nscope for the plaintiff to rely on the contra proferentem rule.50 \n80 The plaintiff had no entitlement under his employment contract to 2.5% \nof the \u201cgross profits\u201d of Fund II, to 12.5% of the carry on Fund II or to 2.5 points \nout of the carried interest pool generated by Fund II. That finding suffices to \ndismiss the plaintiff\u2019s first claim entirely. I therefore need not analyse or \ndetermine the first and third of the LCA Group\u2019s three broad points (see [ 33] \nabove).\nClaim 2: fraudulent misrepresentation\n81 The plaintiff\u2019s second claim is that the LCA Group induced him to enter \ninto his employment contract by making fraudulent misrepresentations to him. \nFor the plaintiff to succeed in this claim, he must establish: (a) that the LCA \nGroup made representations to him of fact; (b) that the LCA Group made the \nrepresentations intending that the plaintiff should act upon them by accepting \nthe LCA Group\u2019s offer of employment; (c) the representations actually induced \nthe plaintiff to accept the LCA Group\u2019s offer of employment; (d) the plaintiff \nsuffered loss and damage as a result of accepting the LCA Group\u2019s offer of \nemployment; and (e) the LCA Group made the representations fraudulently, ie, \nknowing that they were false or in the absence of genuine belief that they were \n50 PCS at para 217.\nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n28true: Panatron Pte Ltd and another v Lee Cheow Lee and another [2001] 2 \nSLR(R) 435 at [14].\nThe parties\u2019 cases\n82 The plaintiff\u2019s case on fraudulent misrepresentation is as follows. The \nLCA Group made four representations to him while he was still employed by \nZovi.com that, if he accepted employment with the LCA Group, he would be \nawarded \u201c2.5% of the gross profits of Fund II\u201d. Two of these representations \nwere made in writing and two were made orally:51\n(a) First, in a phone call in or around June 2011, the third defendant: \n(i) told the plaintiff that Mr Ong\u2019s email projecting the plaintiff\u2019s share \nof the profit as US$4.77m (see [ 62] above) had \u201cmisunderstood the \nplaintiff\u2019s carried interest entitlement\u201d; and (ii) \u201cconfirmed that the \nplaintiff\u2019s carry interest entitlement was 2.5% of the gross profits of \nFund II\u201d.52\n(b) Second, in an email in July 2011, the third defendant told the \nplaintiff that \u201c[a]nyone joining [Fund II] prior [to the second half of \n2012] will get entitled to carry interest from [the] very beginning.\u201d53 The \nplaintiff \u201ctook this to mean that his carry interest entitlement would be \na percentage of gross profits of Fund II\u201d.54 \n(c) Third, in February 2012, the LCA Group sent the first defendant \na draft of his employment contract containing a term providing that he \n51 SOC at para 57.\n52 SOC at para 57(i) read with para 56.\n53 CB 280.\n54 SOC at para 57(i).\nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n29would be \u201cawarded 2.5% carry for the next fund raised by the company\u201d. \nThe plaintiff \u201ctook this to mean that his carry interest entitlement would \nbe 2.5% of the gross profits of Fund II\u201d.55\n(d) Finally, when Mr Piette interviewed the plaintiff in February \n2012, he represented orally to the plaintiff \u201cthat the carried interest \nwould be 2.5% of the gross profit, which on his calculation would \namount to USD 37.5 million\u201d.56\n83 The plaintiff\u2019s case continues as follows. The plaintiff relied on these \nrepresentations when he gave up his employment at Zovi.com and accepted \nemployment with the LCA Group. If the plaintiff has to rely on his \nmisrepresentation claim, that means that the LCA Group\u2019s representations have \nbeen falsified in that the plaintiff has been found not to be entitled to \u201c2.5% of \nthe gross profits of Fund II\u201d but only to 2.5% of the carry on Fund II. The first \ndefendant made these representations fraudulently, knowing them to be false, \nor recklessly, not caring whether they be true or false. As a result of relying on \nthe first defendant\u2019s misrepresentations, the plaintiff suffered loss and damage \nin the sum of either US$75m57 or US$3m,58 being the value of the share options \nhe would have been awarded at Zovi.com if he had not given up his employment \nthere in order to accept employment with the LCA Group.\n84 In response, the LCA Group\u2019s case is as follows. The representations are \nnot actionable, being statements of future intent rather than representations of \npast or present fact. Even if they are actionable, the representations were never \n55 SOC at para 57(ii) read with para 56.\n56 SOC at para 57(iii).\n57 PCS at paragraph 326(f). \n58 PRCS at paragraph 180. \nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n30made or are true. Even if the representations were made and are false, the \nrepresentations did not induce the plaintiff to give up his employment with \nZovi.com and to accept employment with the LCA Group. And, even if the \nrepresentations did induce the plaintiff to do so, he did not suffer any loss or \ndamage as a result, because his share options at Zovi.com were and are \nworthless.\n85 For the reasons which follow, I reject the plaintiff\u2019s case in fraudulent \nmisrepresentation in its entirety for the following reasons: (a) the written \nrepresentations were made but are not false; (b) the oral representations were \nnever made, the plaintiff\u2019s account of them being false; (c) the plaintiff\u2019s claim \nthat the LCA Group was fraudulent is contrary to facts he believes to be true; \n(d) the representations did not induce the plaintiff to give up employment with \nZovi.com and to accept employment with the LCA Group; and (e) the plaintiff \nhas failed to establish that he suffered any loss as a result of giving up his \nemployment with Zovi.com to accept employment with the LCA Group.\nThe representations are either true or were not made\n86 I start by analysing the plaintiff\u2019s pleaded case that the LCA Group made \nthe four representations to him (see [ 82] above). I deal with the two written \nrepresentations first before dealing with the two oral representations. \nThe plaintiff fundamentally misunderstood the two written representations\n87 Given that they are in writing, there can be no doubt that the LCA Group \nmade the two written representations to the plaintiff. But I accept the LCA \nGroup\u2019s submission that the plaintiff fundamentally misunderstood the written \nrepresentations. Correctly understood, the written representations are not false.\nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n3188 The first written representation simply refers to the plaintiff\u2019s \nentitlement to \u201ccarry\u201d on Fund II from its inception.59 This representation says \nnothing about the quantum of his share of the carry. The second written \nrepresentation says simply that the plaintiff will be \u201cawarded 2.5% carry\u201d on \nFund II. It says nothing about what \u201c2.5% carry\u201d means or how it is to be \ncalculated.\n89 The plaintiff claims that he understood both written representations to \nmean that the LCA Group would award him some part of the \u201cgross profits\u201d of \nFund II, not of its \u201cnet profits\u201d. According to the plaintiff\u2019s use of the terms \n\u201cgross profits\u201d and \u201cnet profits\u201d, the fund in my example (see [ 44]\u2013[ 46] above) \ngenerated \u201cgross profits\u201d of $100 and \u201cnet profits\u201d of $20. The plaintiff\u2019s case \nis therefore that he understood the two written representations to mean that he \nwas entitled to 2.5% of the $100 ($2.50) and not to 2.5% of the $20 ($0.50).\n90 But neither of the written representations uses the words \u201cgross\u201d or \n\u201cprofits\u201d or the phrase \u201cgross profits\u201d. This is an objective fact. The plaintiff \nhad no alternative but to accept this fact in cross-examination. He further \naccepted: (a) that the LCA Group never used any of these words at the material \ntime, whether orally or in writing; and (b) that his pleaded term \u201cgross profits\u201d \nis merely his own ex post facto subjective and self-engendered understanding \nof the words which the LCA Group did use, which were \u201ccarry\u201d or \u201ccarried \ninterest entitlement\u201d:60\n\u201cQ: And there was no representation that there would be a 2.5 \npayment based on gross profits.\nA: Your Honour, the terms \u201cgross\u201d and \u201cnet\u201d were never \nmentioned to me at the material time.\n59 CB 280; SOC at para 57(i).\n60 27 January 2021 Transcript at p 140 line 12 to p 141 line 17.\nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n32Q: \u201cAt the material time\u201d meaning when?\nA: Recruitment, employment, and until the August\u2026\n\u2026\nQ: Mr Mehra, if the concept of gross profit was not mentioned \nto you, why do you state so in paragraph 354(d) of your AEIC?\nA: Sorry, 354(d)?\nQ: Yes: \u201cThe carried interest allocated to me would be 2.5 per \ncent of the gross profit\u2026\u201d\nA: Your Honour, because these are all alien terms now, and \nsubsequently, since the dispute, I have realised that we need to \nfurther define what the verbal explanation to me was. And the \nway to define what 2.5 per cent means is to further clarify gross \nprofit, but the actual word \u201cgross\u201d was not used.\u201d\n91 The phrase \u201cgross profits\u201d is crucial to the plaintiff\u2019s case both in \ncontract and misrepresentation. But his cross-examination revealed the phrase \nto have no basis in the facts. It is merely a self-serving term which the plaintiff \nhas adopted after the fact for the purposes of pleading and presenting his case.\n92 Further, the concept of \u201cgross profits\u201d was not something which the \nplaintiff himself understood during the pre-contractual discussions, whether in \nthe sense which he now claims to understand it or in any other sense. As the \nplaintiff himself candidly accepts, he had no understanding of the deductions \nthat are made by a private equity fund manager \u201cin arriving from gross to net\u201d \nprofits. The plaintiff further accepts that his state of ignorance continued even \nup to the point when he sat down to draft his affidavit of evidence in chief for \nthis action.61\n93 The plaintiff\u2019s use of \u201cgross profits\u201d in pleading and presenting his case \nis contrived and incorrect. The experts are agreed that it is customary in the \n61 28 January 2021 Transcript at p 18 lines 10-16, p 142 line 23 to p 143 line 10.\nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n33private equity industry to refer to what the fund manager retains after he has \npaid 80% of a fund\u2019s profits to investors as \u201cthe carry\u201d or \u201cthe carried interest\u201d. \nThese were the only terms which the LCA Group used in its written \nrepresentations to the plaintiff.\n94 At best, all that the LCA Group represented to the plaintiff in the two \nwritten representations is that he would be entitled to 2.5% of the carry on Fund \nII. At best, and correctly understood, the two representations did not mean that \nthe plaintiff would be entitled to 2.5% of the \u201cgross profits\u201d on Fund II, as the \nplaintiff has pleaded. Given the plaintiff\u2019s concessions in cross-examination \n(see [ 90] and [ 92] above),62 he had no basis at that time to understand the written \nrepresentations as meaning that the LCA Group would pay him 2.5% of Fund \nII\u2019s profit ($2.50 in my example) and not merely 2.5% of the carry ($0.50 in my \nexample). \n95 I therefore accept the LCA Group\u2019s submission that it was the plaintiff\u2019s \nown ex post facto misunderstanding of the content of the written representations \nwhich has led him to take from these written representations the meaning that \nhe now pleads. That is not the meaning which the representations objectively \nbear. That objective meaning is the only meaning which the LCA Group \nintended at the time.\n96 The two written representations, correctly understood, are consistent \nwith my finding as to the proper construction of the phrase \u201c2.5% carry\u201d. The \ntwo written representations were therefore not false. They are not \nmisrepresentations.\n62 28 January 2021 Transcript at p 17 line 18 to p 18 line 2, p 60 line 22 to\u2013 p 62 line 21.\nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n34The LCA Group did not make the oral representations\n97 The plaintiff\u2019s case is that the LCA Group represented to him orally on \ntwo occasions that he would be entitled to 2.5% of Fund II\u2019s \u201cgross profits\u201d.63 \nThe first occasion was allegedly in a phone call with the third defendant which \ntook place in or around June 2011.64 The second occasion was allegedly at a \nmeeting with Mr Piette in February 2012.65\n98 Both the phone call with the third defendant and the meeting with Mr \nPiette did take place. But both the third defendant and Mr Piette categorically \ndeny making any such representation to the plaintiff on those occasions, or \nindeed on any other occasion. The third defendant\u2019s evidence is that it is \ncommercial nonsense to promise anyone a share of a private equity fund\u2019s \n\u201cgross profits\u201d.66\n99 I accept the LCA Group\u2019s evidence. For the reasons which follow, I find \nthat neither of them made the alleged oral representations to the plaintiff.\n(1) The third defendant did not make the oral representation\n100 In his statement of claim, the plaintiff\u2019s pleaded account of the third \ndefendant\u2019s oral representation is as follows:67\nAfter [the third defendant] received a copy of Gilbert Ong\u2019s email \ndated 27 June 2011, [the third defendant] then reassured the \nplaintiff over the phone, in or around June 2011, that Gilbert \nOng had misunderstood the plaintiff\u2019s carried interest \n63 SOC at para 19(a).\n64 SOC at para 57(i) read with para 56.\n65 SOC at para 10.\n66 10 February 2021 Transcript at p 50 lines 1\u201319; 18 February 2021 Transcript at p 30 \nline 12 to p 31 line 5.\n67 SOC at para 56(ii).\nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n35entitlement.

The third defendant did not make this \nrepresentation. I arrive at that finding for five reasons.\n103 First, in connection with the oral representations, the plaintiff accepted \nin cross-examination once again (see [ 90] above) that the third defendant, as \nwell as Mr Piette for that matter, had never spoken to him of \u201cgross profits\u201d. \nThe plaintiff also accepted once again that the term \u201cgross profits\u201d is merely his \nown subjective and self-engendered understanding of what the third defendant \nhad actually said:69\nQ: Now, let\u2019s look at paragraph 56 [of the statement of claim]\u2026 \nFocus on the last sentence \u201c\u2026the third defendant also \nconfirmed that the plaintiff\u2019s carry interest entitlement was \n2.5% of the gross profits of [the fund].\u201d You will agree that this \nstatement is incorrect?\nA: I apologise for the confusion, your Honour. The statement is \nnot a quote of [the third defendant\u2019s], so in that sense it is \nincorrect. It is just intended to be a position that\u2019s stated based \non the phone call and the understanding I gained from that \nphone call. So that is correct, your Honour. He did not use these \nwords, specifically.\nQ: It is based on your own understanding of the phone call and \nnot by reason of [the third defendant] telling you that it is 2.5 \nper cent of the gross profits of the fund.

Am I correct?\nA: That is correct, your Honour.\nQ: So if they did not speak about gross profits, they could not \nhave told you that your package would include 2.5 per cent of \nthe gross profits. A simple proposition. You can agree or \ndisagree.\nA: I disagree, your Honour.\nQ: All right, you disagree. I find it quite alarming that you could \ndisagree to such a simple proposition, but I\u2019ll move on.\n\u2026\nCourt: --what Mr Tan is driving at is the gap between the words \nyou claim were used by the defendants and Mr Piette and the \nunderstanding you subjectively had of the meaning of those \nwords\u2026I would need to understand and I will need to make a \nfinding whether these specific word[s] were spoken to you by \nany of the defendants. \u201c2.5 per cent of gross profit\u201d, were those \nactual words spoken to you and, if so, is that false?\nA: \u2026Those actual words were not spoken, your Honour. And if \nI might elaborate, the confusion between even me and my \nlawyers in trying to explain these terms had come down to a \npoint where then we agreed \u201c2.5 per cent gross profits\u201d would \nbe the appropriate term to use and try to describe these in legal \ndocuments\u2026\nCourt: So what you have pleaded is not what you are going to \nbe asking me to decide the defendants actually said in those \nwords; instead what you have pleaded is what you understood \ntheir words to be. Is that right?\nA: That is correct. That is correct, your Honour.\u201d\n104 Second, this alleged oral representation is of critical importance, not \nonly to the plaintiff\u2019s case in misrepresentation but also to his case in contract. \nThat is because he relies on it not only as a fraudulent misrepresentation but also \nas evidence of a shared understanding forming part of the admissible context \nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n37for construing the phrase \u201c2.5% carry\u201d. On the plaintiff\u2019s case, this phone call \nwas the earliest time that anybody on behalf of the LCA Group made the specific \nrepresentation to the plaintiff on which his entire misrepresentation case rests. \nOne would expect it to be the cornerstone of the plaintiff\u2019s positive case on both \nmisrepresentation and breach of contract. \n105 Despite this, the plaintiff did not plead this representation anywhere in \nhis original statement of claim. The plaintiff pleaded it belatedly in his reply, \nand even then only to meet the LCA Group\u2019s plea in its defence and \ncounterclaim that Mr Ong\u2019s June 2011 email and other contemporaneous \ndocumentary evidence showed that the first defendant promised the plaintiff \nnothing more than \u201c2.5% carry\u201d.70 It was only then that the plaintiff \nincorporated this alleged representation by amendment into his statement of \nclaim as part of his positive case.71\n106 Indeed, if the third defendant had in fact made this representation, one \nwould have expected the plaintiff to have drawn it to the LCA Group\u2019s attention \nas soon as the dispute arose in August 2014, long before he commenced this \naction in March 2016. He did nothing of the sort. From in or around June 2011 \n(when the third defendant allegedly made this representation) to June 2015 \n(when the plaintiff\u2019s employment was terminated) all the way up to July 2016 \n(when the plaintiff first pleaded this representation in his reply and then \nincorporated it by amendment into his statement of claim), he had made no \nreference whatsoever to this representation, whether by himself, through his \n70 Reply dated 11 July 2016 at paragraph 6(2).\n71 Statement of claim (Amendment No. 1) dated 22 July 2016 at paragraph 56(ii).\nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n38solicitors or through Spencer Stuart, his interface with the LCA Group in 2011, \nand whether informally in correspondence or formally in his pleadings.72\n107 Third, the plaintiff\u2019s account of this representation shifted significantly \nand materially. His pleading asserts that the third defendant \u201cconfirmed that the \nplaintiff\u2019s carry entitlement was 2.5% of the gross profits of Fund II\u201d.73 The \nplaintiff embellished this account in his affidavit of evidence in chief. His \nevidence was that the third defendant positively \u201creassured [the plaintiff] that\u2026 \n\u201c\u20182.5% carry\u2019 referred to 2.5 points out of 20 points\u201d and clarified that the \nplaintiff\u2019s share of Fund II\u2019s profit was to be \u201c12.5% of the total carried interest \npool available to management\u201d.74\n108 It is of course arithmetically true that 2.5 points out of 20 points is 12.5% \nof the 20 points. That is because 2.5\n20 = 0.125 = 12.5\n100 =12.5%.  But the \nplaintiff\u2019s affidavit of evidence in chief does not simply assert this equation as \na matter of arithmetic. It asserts as a fact that the third defendant in this phone \ncall and in or around June 2011 expressly stated this equation to the plaintiff in \norder to disavow Mr Ong\u2019s email and as reassurance to the plaintiff about the \nmeaning of \u201c2.5% carry\u201d. These embellishments appear nowhere in the \nplaintiff\u2019s original or even amended pleadings. It emerged for the very first time \nin his affidavit of evidence in chief, filed almost five years after he commenced \nthis action. It is clear to me this aspect of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence is an \nafterthought, put forward falsely merely to advance his case.\n72 27 January 2021 Transcript at p 96 lines 13\u201320.\n73 SOC at para 56(ii).\n74 Plaintiff\u2019s AEIC at para 343.\nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n39109 Fourth, the plaintiff\u2019s account is contrary to the inherent probabilities. \nThe plaintiff\u2019s case is that he relied on the oral representation which the third \ndefendant made in or around June 2011 when he accepted the first defendant\u2019s \nwritten offer of employment in February 2012.75 That would mean that the \nplaintiff accepted the remuneration package in that offer \u2013 including the award \nof \u201c2.5% carry\u201d in those very words \u2013 even though he knew: (a) that the third \ndefendant had, more than six months earlier, expressly disavowed Mr Ong\u2019s \nwritten representation that the plaintiff would be entitled to \u201c2.5% carry\u201d \nestimated to be worth US$4.77m; and (b) that that disavowal was purely oral \nand was not in writing or even evidenced by writing. There is no record of the \nplaintiff making any attempt to have the third defendant\u2019s earlier representation \nrecorded in the LCA Group\u2019s written offer of February 2012 or indeed \nanywhere else in writing before he accepted the offer. There is also no record \nof the plaintiff himself restating the third defendant\u2019s representation in any pre-\ncontractual correspondence. \n110 In fact, in July 2011, the plaintiff informed Spencer Stuart that the first \ndefendant\u2019s package was acceptable, making no mention whatsoever of this \nalleged oral representation.76 It appears therefore that the plaintiff would have \nbeen happy, if he had been minded to accept the LCA Group\u2019s offer in July \n2011, to proceed on the basis that Mr Ong\u2019s July 2011 email was the definitive \nword on the plaintiff\u2019s share of Fund II\u2019s carry.77 \n111 If the third defendant had indeed made the representation, these failures \nand omissions would be entirely contrary to the inherent probabilities. As I have \n75 CB 258.\n76 CB 258.\n77 CB 257\u2013258.\nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n40mentioned, the difference between the parties\u2019 positions is not trivial: it is a \nfactor of five.\n112 Fifth, I accept the defendant\u2019s submission that there was no rational \ncommercial reason for the third defendant to promise the plaintiff in June 2011 \nthat his share of the carry would be five times that which I have found would \nhave been commensurate with the plaintiff\u2019s experience and role (see [ 67]\u2013[ 74] \nabove). A share of the carry on Fund II of this order of magnitude is all the more \nuncommercial given the plaintiff\u2019s case that he was not expected to invest any \nof his personal funds in Fund II. As the LCA Group puts it, that means that the \nplaintiff\u2019s case today is that it agreed in February 2012 that the plaintiff should \nbear none of the risks of Fund II and reap only the rewards of Fund II. That is \ncontrary to the inherent probabilities.\n113 The plaintiff says that the third defendant offered him a share of the carry \nof this order of magnitude in July 2011 because he wanted the LCA Group\u2019s \noffer to be competitive with Zovi.com\u2019s offer. That offer included participation \nin an employee\u2019s share option plan. On this point, I accept the defendant\u2019s \nexpert witnesses\u2019 evidence: a share of the carry of a fund to be launched and \nmanaged by a well-established and successful private equity fund manager, such \nas the LCA Group, carries far less risk, and is therefore far more valuable, than \nan option to be awarded shares in a start-up company with no track record and \nwith no certainty that the shares can ever be monetised, let alone that the shares \nwill have value or appreciate in value over time.78 What the plaintiff had on \noffer from Zovi.com was substantially more risky and substantially less \nvaluable than the LCA Group\u2019s offer of 2.5% of the carry on Fund II.79 There \n78 19 February 2021 Transcript at p 69 lines 9\u201314.\n79 CB 249 and 251.\nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n41was no commercial reason for the third defendant to offer the plaintiff 12.5% of \nthe carry on Fund II to be competitive with Zovi.com\u2019s offer.\n114 For all of these reasons, I find that the third defendant did not make the \nalleged oral representation as alleged or at all. \n(2) Mr Piette did not make the oral representation\n115 The plaintiff also alleges that Mr Piette represented orally to the plaintiff \nat an interview in February 2012 \u201cthat the carried interest would be 2.5% of the \ngross profit, which on his calculation would amount to USD 37.5 million\u201d.80 \n116 I reject the plaintiff\u2019s evidence. I find that Mr Piette did not make this \nrepresentation for four reasons. \n117 Once again, the plaintiff\u2019s case on this representation is contrary to the \ninherent probabilities. After Mr Piette interviewed the plaintiff in Delhi in \nFebruary 2012, Mr Ong send a revised draft employment contract to the \nplaintiff. The draft continued to provide that the plaintiff would be entitled to \n\u201c2.5% carry\u201d on Fund II. The plaintiff signed the employment contract without \ndemur.81 That would be contrary to the inherent probabilities if Mr Piette had \nindeed made this oral representation to the plaintiff. \n118 Once again, there was no commercial reason for Mr Piette to promise \nthe plaintiff in February 2012 a profit share of the order of magnitude of \nUS$37.5m. The plaintiff\u2019s bargaining position in early 2012 was no better than \nit had been in June 2011. In fact, his bargaining position by this time was, if \n80 SOC at para 57(iii).\n81 CB 372\u2013378.\nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n42anything, worse. I accept the LCA Group\u2019s submission that the plaintiff initiated \nthe discussions with the LCA Group in early 2012 because he had by then been \nasked to leave Zovi.com (see [ 138] below).82\n119 Once again, the plaintiff\u2019s account of this representation shifted \nsignificantly and materially. His statement of claim pleads that Mr Piette \nrepresented to the plaintiff that: \u201cThe carried interest allocated to the plaintiff \nwould be 2.5% of the gross profit, or 2.5 carry points, which would amount to \nUSD 37.5 million\u2026, or 12.5% of the carried interest pool...\u201d.83 This is consistent \nwith an email which the plaintiff sent in or around August 2014, soon after the \ndispute first arose.84 The plaintiff\u2019s affidavit of evidence in chief confirms this \naccount in two places.85\n120 In cross-examination, however, the plaintiff resiled from this account in \ntwo critical respects. First, he conceded that Mr Piette had never used the phrase \n\u201cgross profits\u201d. He therefore conceded that Mr Piette did not tell the plaintiff \nthat he would be entitled to \u201c2.5% of gross profits\u201d as the plaintiff had pleaded \nand affirmed.86 Second, he conceded that Mr Piette did not tell the plaintiff that \nhe would be entitled to \u201c12.5% of the carried interest pool\u201d.87\n121 The plaintiff accepted in cross-examination the possibility that he had \nadded to his account in this way self-servingly and with the benefit of hindsight. \nThus, the plaintiff accepted that he might have inserted the word \u201cgross\u201d before \n82 Third Defendant\u2019s AEIC at para 32.\n83 SOC at para 10.\n84 CB 1278.\n85 Plaintiff\u2019s AEIC at paras 354(d) and 407(d).\n86 28 January 2021 Transcript at p 17 line 18 to p 18 line 2, p 60 line 24 to p 62 line 21.\n87 27 January 2021 Transcript at p 113 line 18 to p 115 line 5.\nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n43\u201cprofits\u201d even though nobody had used the word \u201cgross\u201d at the time \u201con his own \nbehalf because, in two or three years of being in the business\u2026it might have \nbeen something [he] had heard\u201d.88 Particularly egregious is the plaintiff\u2019s \nattempt in his pleading to put the words \u201c12.5% carried interest pool\u201d into Mr \nPiette\u2019s mouth. When asked why he pleaded and affirmed in his affidavit of \nevidence in chief that Mr Piette had used those words when Mr Piette had not, \nthe plaintiff said that \u201cit\u2019s meant to signal an inference that [Mr Piette\u2019s] \nexplanation was aligning with [the third defendant\u2019s] explanation\u201d.89 I do not \naccept the plaintiff\u2019s explanation for putting words into Mr Piette\u2019s mouth that \nthe plaintiff himself accepts Mr Piette did not say. It is a clear attempt to tailor \nhis evidence to advance his case.\n122 For all of these reasons, I find that Mr Piette did not make the oral \nrepresentation as alleged or at all. \nConclusion\n123 I am satisfied that the plaintiff subjectively misunderstood the written \nrepresentations, and that they were objectively true. I am also satisfied that the \nthird defendant and Mr Piette did not make the oral representations as alleged \nor at all. I am also driven to the conclusion that the plaintiff\u2019s evidence of the \noral representations is not the result of a mistake. It is deliberately false, \ncontrived in hindsight and deliberately tailored to advance his case rather than \nto speak the truth.\n88 28 January 2021 Transcript at p 17 line 18 to p 18 line 2.\n89 27 January 2021 Transcript at p 114 line 23 to p 115 line 5.\nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n44The LCA Group was not fraudulent\n124 In any event, I find also that the plaintiff\u2019s case on fraud is entirely \nwithout basis. I explain first why fraud is of fundamental importance to the \nplaintiff\u2019s claim before explaining why there is no basis for fraud.\nA representation as to future intent is actionable only if fraudulently made\n125 To be actionable, a misrepresentation must be a false statement of a past \nor present fact (Tan Chin Seng and others v Raffles Town Club Pte Ltd [2003] \n3 SLR(R) 307 at [20]-[21]). This excludes statements as to the future. A \nrepresentor\u2019s statement that a state of affairs will come about in the future is \neither a promise or a prediction. It is a promise when that state of affairs is within \nthe promisor\u2019s control. It is a prediction when that state of affairs is outside the \npromisor\u2019s control. Neither a promise nor a prediction is a statement of past or \npresent fact. Therefore, neither a broken promise nor a failed prediction is \nactionable as a misrepresentation.\n126 The plaintiff\u2019s case is that the LCA Group represented to him that, if he \nbecame an employee of the LCA Group, the LCA Group would award him \n\u201c2.5% of the gross profits of Fund II\u201d.90 For the purposes of this section of my \nanalysis, I will assume, contrary to the plaintiff\u2019s concession and my findings, \nthat the LCA Group actually did make this representation to him in writing and \norally.\n127 This representation is not a statement of fact. It is in substance a promise. \nThat is because it is a statement by the LCA Group that it would bring about in \nthe future a state of affairs. That state of affairs is that the LCA Group would \n90 SOC at para 57.\nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n45pay the plaintiff \u201c2.5% of the gross profits of Fund II\u201d. If falsified, this \nrepresentation will amount to broken promise. It cannot be a failed prediction. \nThat is because what the LCA Group pays to the plaintiff out of the profits of \nFund II in the future is not outside the control of the LCA Group. I therefore \nneed say nothing further about failed predictions.\n128 A broken promise gives rise to a viable claim in fraudulent \nmisrepresentation only if the representor had no intention of fulfilling the \npromise at the time he made it. This is not an exception to the rule that an \nactionable misrepresentation must be a statement of fact. That is because, in \ntruth, it is not the broken promise which is the actionable misrepresentation. The \nactionable misrepresentation is the implicit representation which accompanies \nevery promise: that the promisor genuinely intends to honour his promise. If the \npromisor has no such intent, the promise is made fraudulently. That is because \nthe implicit representation which accompanies the promise is false. That is so \neven if, by some happenstance, the subject of the promise ultimately eventuates. \nAnother way of putting the same point, albeit somewhat inaccurately, is that a \nbroken promise is actionable in misrepresentation if and only if the representor \nmakes the promise having no intention of fulfilling it, and the representor is in \nthat sense fraudulent.\n129 Therefore, contrary to the LCA Group\u2019s submission, classifying the \nalleged representation as a promise rather than a statement of fact is not in itself \na ground on which to dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s claim in fraudulent \nmisrepresentation. All that that means is that this claim cannot succeed simply \nby the plaintiff showing that the LCA Group has broken its promise. The \nplaintiff can nevertheless succeed by proving fraud, ie that the LCA Group \nrepresented to the plaintiff that it would pay him\u201c2.5% of the gross profits of \nFund II\u201d with no intention of keeping the promise. \nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n46The plaintiff\u2019s own case is that the first defendant was not fraudulent\n130 The plaintiff\u2019s own evidence is fatal to his plea of fraud. He readily \naccepted in cross-examination that the third defendant and Mr Piette fully \nintended that the LCA Group would keep its promise to pay the plaintiff \u201c2.5% \nof the gross profits of Fund II\u201d when they made the representations to him in \nJune 2011 and February 2012. That necessarily means that he accepts that the \nimplicit representation which accompanied this alleged promise (see [ 128] \nabove) was true at the time the LCA Group made this promise. \n131 As the plaintiff explained in cross-examination, the only case he \nadvances on fraud is that the third defendant and Mr Piette changed their mind \nin August 2014 and decided to cause the LCA Group to break the promise to \npay him \u201c2.5% of the gross profits of Fund II\u201d. The plaintiff asserts further that \nthey did so in order to put pressure on him because they were unhappy about \nhis whistleblowing:91\nQ: \u2026When you said that you realised in August 2014 that \nwhat [the third defendant] said was false, what is it that \nhe said, prior to August 2014, that was false and had \ninduced you to join L Capital and terminate your \nemployment with Zovi.com?\nA: Yes\u2026\nCourt: What\u2019s the answer?\nA: The answer is that I believe [the third defendant\u2019s] \ncommunication of my carried interest in 2011 and [Mr \nPiette\u2019s] explanation in 2012 were true at the time. In \nAugust, they restated that position, and when we go \nfurther into my whistleblowing, I can explain the context \nand why I believe that\u2019s so. So I don\u2019t believe that there \nwas anything false mentioned in 2011 and 2012. I think \nthere was a reinterpretation in 2014 on the basis of the \nevents that took place just prior.\n91 28 January 2021 Transcript at p 78 line 11 to p 79 line 22.\nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n47Q: We know that [the third defendant\u2019s] interpretation is as \nstated in the email by Gilbert Ong on 22 August, and \nthat is the position [the third defendant] maintains. Is it \nyour evidence that at the time he communicated with \nyou in July 2011, he did not believe in this \ninterpretation that he gave you on 22 August 2014?\nA: Yes, your Honour, that is correct. That is what I am \ntrying to say.\nQ: So your case is [the third defendant] had deliberately \nmisled you as to the interpretation of \u201c2.5 per cent carry\u201d \nin July 2011?\nA: No, your Honour, that\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying. I\u2019m saying \nin July 2011, he was earnest in telling me what my carry \nwas. Come August 2014, and again when we discussed \nthe whistleblowing, I think it will be clearer, he changed \nhis position, and I perceived that as he wanted to put \npressure on me.\n132 In order to be fair to the plaintiff, I wanted to be sure that he had not \nmisspoken and that I had not misunderstood his case on fraud. I therefore gave \nhim an opportunity to address the fundamental issue of fraud squarely, putting \nthe issue to him neutrally and in layman\u2019s language. In response, he again \ndisavowed the fundamental element of fraud:92\nCourt: \u2026Mr Mehra, what Mr Tan is saying is: from what I \nunderstand of your evidence, you are saying that you \naccept that in 2011, the third defendant was telling you \nthe truth as to his future intention, and in 2014, he was \nlying to you about what he had told you in 2011. If he \nwas telling you the truth in 2011 and you joined L \nCapital in 2012, and then he lied after you had joined, \nthen you would not have been induced to join by a lie.\nA: Your Honour, that is absolutely correct.\nCourt: All right, thank you.\n133 The plaintiff\u2019s answers in cross-examination are not admissible \nevidence on whether the third defendant and Mr Piette made the pleaded \n92 28 January 2021 Transcript at p 93 lines 11\u201321.\nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n48representation fraudulently. That question turns on whether the third defendant \nand Mr Piette intended at that time to cause the LCA Group to keep its promise \nto pay the plaintiff \u201c2.5% of the gross profits of Fund II\u201d. The plaintiff is not, \nof course, a mind reader. He can therefore have no personal knowledge of their \nstate of mind at the material time. He is therefore incapable of giving direct \nevidence as to the third defendant\u2019s and Mr Piette\u2019s state of mind at the material \ntime within the meaning of s 62(1) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed).\n134 But the plaintiff is not merely a witness in this litigation. He is also one \nof the litigants. I must take it that he presents his case to the court as an honest \nlitigant. It is therefore not open to the plaintiff to advance a position in this action \n\u2013 whether in his pleadings, in his affidavit of evidence in chief, in his counsel\u2019s \ncross-examination of the defendants\u2019 witnesses or in his submissions \u2013 which is \ncontrary to facts which the plaintiff accepts to be true. That is so even if the \nplaintiff himself is unable to give admissible evidence as to the truth of those \nfacts, for example, as in this case, because they are outside his personal \nknowledge.\n135 The passages from the plaintiff\u2019s cross-examination which I have cited \nat [131] and [ 132] above show that the plaintiff believes to this day that the third \ndefendant and Mr Piette made the representation to him honestly, not \nfraudulently. The plaintiff therefore could not have hoped to succeed in his plea \nof fraud. He should have never made the plea, let alone pursued it at trial in an \nattempt to secure judgment. \nThe plaintiff was not induced by the representation\n136 I also do not accept that the first defendant\u2019s alleged representation \ninduced the plaintiff to leave his employment with Zovi.com and take up \nemployment with the first defendant. Again, for the purpose of this analysis, I \nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n49assume that the LCA Group did make a misrepresentation to the plaintiff as \nalleged.\n137 First of all, in the passage from his cross-examination which I have cited \nat [132] above, the plaintiff himself accepted that he was not induced to accept \nemployment with the LCA Group by any pre-contractual deception by the LCA \nGroup. That is fatal to the plaintiff\u2019s case in inducement.\n138 Second, I accept LCA Group\u2019s case that the plaintiff was asked to leave \nZovi.com in early 2012 and that that was why he reinitiated the discussions with \nthe LCA Group about potential employment. The evidence before me shows \nthat the plaintiff was, by early 2012, in \u201csettlement\u201d negotiations with Zovi.com. \nThe negotiations were over a \u201cseverance package\u201d of six months\u2019 salary with \nthe possibility of extension if he had been unable within those six months to \nfind employment or to start a business of his own.93 The plaintiff accepted in \ncross-examination that a \u201cseverance\u201d package implies an involuntary \ntermination of employment and is rarely offered to an employee who resigns \nvoluntarily.94 Further, the plaintiff expressed concern in contemporaneous \nemails to Zovi.com about how his departure would be publicised. That would \nhave been an unlikely concern if he were leaving voluntarily for a better \nemployment opportunity. \n139 I therefore find that the plaintiff accepted the LCA Group\u2019s offer of \nemployment in February 2012 because that was the best alternative he then had, \nafter having been asked to leave Zovi.com. As such, I find that he would have \n93 CB 380\u2013381\n94 27 January 2021 Transcript at p 88 lines 2\u201321.\nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n50accepted the LCA Group\u2019s offer of employment with or without the alleged \nrepresentation.\n140 Finally, returning to my actual findings thus far, insofar as the plaintiff \nwas induced by anything to accept the first defendant\u2019s offer of employment, \nthe true and operative inducement was, at best, his own misunderstanding of \nwhat the phrase \u201c2.5% carry\u201d meant. That misunderstanding did not originate \nfrom any act or omission on the part of the LCA Group or its representatives. \nNor was it a reasonable misunderstanding of the representations which the LCA \nGroup actually made to him. His misunderstanding was entirely subjective, \nentirely self-engendered and entirely unreasonable. The LCA Group cannot \nbear any responsibility in fact or in law if the plaintiff was induced to accept the \nLCA Group\u2019s offer of employment by his own subjective, self-engendered and \nunreasonable misunderstanding of the terms of his remuneration.\n141 For all of these reasons, I find that the plaintiff has failed to establish the \nelement of inducement. \nThe plaintiff has not proven that he suffered any loss\n142 Finally, I accept the LCA Group\u2019s submission that the plaintiff has failed \nto prove that he suffered any loss as a result of the alleged misrepresentations.\n143 The plaintiff claims that his reliance on the first defendant\u2019s \nmisrepresentation caused him to suffer loss of US$75m or US$3m. That is the \nvalue which the plaintiff ascribes to the shares in Zovi.com which he would \nhave received under its employee stock option plan (\u201cESOP\u201d) if he had \nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n51remained with Zovi.com instead of accepting employment with the LCA Group \nin February 2012.95\n144 I reject the plaintiff\u2019s case on loss for three reasons.\n145 First, I have already accepted that the plaintiff was asked to leave \nZovi.com in early 2012 (see [ 138] above). Therefore, with or without the first \ndefendant\u2019s alleged misrepresentation, and with or without his alleged reliance \non it to accept employment with the LCA Group, the plaintiff was going to lose \nany entitlement to participate in Zovi.com\u2019s ESOP.\n146 Second, the plaintiff has failed to prove that he in fact lost any ESOP \nshares or that he even had a chance to be allotted ESOP shares. As the LCA \nGroup points out, the plaintiff accepted that he was not a participant in any \nESOP at Zovi.com.96 He also confirmed that Zovi.com had not allotted any \nshares to him under its ESOP, vested or unvested, when he accepted \nemployment with the LCA Group.97 \n147 Third, the US$75m figure which the plaintiff originally ascribed to this \nclaim is wholly speculative and devoid of any substance. It assumes that \nZovi.com would achieve a valuation of US$1bn within five years.98 Not only is \nthere no evidence that this was more probable than not in 2012, there is evidence \nthat this was impossible by 2016. That is when Zovi.com was wound up.99 \n95 SOC at para 64(ii).\n96 27 January 2021 Transcript at p 69 lines 20\u201325).\n97 27 January 2021 Transcript at p 70 lines 1\u20133.\n98 SOC at para 64(ii).\n99 27 January 2021 Transcript at p 70 lines 4\u20136, p 71 lines 4\u201312.\nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n52There is also no evidence to support the alternative figure of US$3m which the \nplaintiff advances in his reply closing submissions.\nConclusion\n148 The plaintiff\u2019s own evidence cited at [ 131]\u2013[ 132] above makes clear that \nhis true complaint against the LCA Group in his misrepresentation claim is not \nthat it deceived him. His true complaint is the LCA Group broke its promise to \npay him 2.5% of the \u201cgross profits\u201d of Fund II. Protecting the plaintiff\u2019s interest \nin that promise, assuming for the moment that it was made, is entirely and \nproperly the domain of the law of contract. I have already rejected the plaintiff\u2019s \ncontractual claim for 2.5% of Fund II\u2019s gross profits as wholly misconceived. It \nwould subvert the law of contract to allow the plaintiff to pursue, let alone \nsucceed, in an alternative claim in tort based on the LCA Group\u2019s breach of the \nvery same promise. His true complaint is not even actionable in tort.\nClaim 3: termination in breach of contract\n149 The plaintiff\u2019s third claim is a claim that the LCA Group terminated his \nemployment in breach of contract. \nThe law\n150 The applicable law is not in dispute.

Therefore, either party to an \nemployment contract may terminate it: (a) in accordance with its express terms; \nor (b) for a repudiatory breach by the other party: Piattchanine, Iouri v \nPhosagro Asia Pte Ltd [2015] 5 SLR 1257 (\u201cPiattchanine (HC)\u201d) at [117]. \n151 Furthermore, whether a party is entitled to terminate an employment \ncontract for repudiatory breach of that contract is determined on the ordinary \nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n53test which applies to all contracts as set out in RDC Concrete Pte Ltd v Sato \nKogyo (S) Pte Ltd [2007] 4 SLR(R) 413 (\u201cRDC Concrete\u201d), ie the innocent \nparty will be entitled to terminate the contract for breach: (a) where the contract \nprovides expressly that a breach of that term will entitle the innocent party to \nterminate the contract; (b) where one party clearly conveys to the other that it \nwill not perform its obligations under the contract at all, thereby renouncing it; \n(c) where the intention of the parties was to designate the term that has been \nbreached as one that is so important that any breach of that term, regardless of \nits actual consequences, would entitle the innocent party to terminate the \ncontract; or (d) if the breach gives rise to an event which will deprive the \ninnocent party of substantially the whole of the benefit that the parties intended \nit should obtain under the contract (RDC Concrete at [91]\u2013[99] and [113]; \nPhosagro Asia Pte Ltd v Piattchanine, Iouri [2016] 5 SLR 1052 (\u201cPiattchanine \n(CA)\u201d) at [52] and [54]\u2013[55]).\n152 Turning now to the specific context of an employment contact, an \nemployee commits a repudiatory breach of his employment contract if he is \nguilty of misconduct. Misconduct is conduct which destroys the relationship of \ntrust and confidence which underlies a contract between employer and \nemployee and which thereby renders the employment relationship untenable \n(Piattchanine (HC) at [253]\u2013[254] and [260]; cited with approval in \nPiattchanine (CA) at [50] and [53]). One type of conduct which will have this \neffect is insubordination. Insubordination is the wilful disobedience of a \nreasonable and lawful command from a superior officer (Piattchanine (CA) at \n[52(b)], [55]). Disobedience is wilful if it is done \u201cintentionally, knowingly and \npurposely, without justifiable excuse, as distinguished from an act done \ncarelessly, thoughtlessly, heedlessly, or inadvertently.\u201d100\n100 P\u2019s closing submissions at para 89(b).\nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n54The LCA Group\u2019s case \n153 The LCA Group\u2019s primary case is that: (a) the plaintiff\u2019s conduct from \nOctober 2014 to June 2015 constituted breaches of the express and implied \nterms of his employment contract;101 and (b) the LCA Group terminated the \nplaintiff\u2019s employment on 29 June 2015 in accordance with its rights and \nobligations under his employment contract. The LCA Group\u2019s alternative case \nis that the same conduct of the plaintiff amounted to a repudiatory breach of the \nplaintiff\u2019s employment contract \u2013 because it evinced his intention no longer to \nbe bound by its terms \u2013 which the LCA Group accepted on 29 June 2015, \nthereby terminating the contract.102 \n154 In its letter dated 29 June 2015 terminating the plaintiff\u2019s employment, \nthe LCA Group justified the termination on six grounds:\n(a) The plaintiff had been guilty of insubordination by failing or \nrefusing to attend meetings. \n(b) The plaintiff had been guilty of insubordination by remaining in \nIndia, without approval from the LCA Group\u2019s management, instead of \nreporting to his primary place of work under the June 2014 Contract, \nwhich was Hong Kong, or reporting to Singapore as instructed by the \nthird defendant. \n(c) The plaintiff had actively undermined the third defendant, his \nimmediate superior officer within the LCA Group, by alleging that the \nthird defendant had harassed the plaintiff in retaliation for the plaintiff\u2019s \nwhistleblowing. \n101 CB 2712\u20132715; D&CC at para 46.\n102 D&CC at para 67.\nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n55(d) The plaintiff had destabilised the LCA Group by alleging \ninternal wrongdoing to senior management of LVMH, despite the fact \nthat the plaintiff had by then been told to direct these allegations only to \nthe third defendant. \n(e) The plaintiff had disrupted the LCA Group\u2019s operations by \nchallenging the LCA Group\u2019s summary of its meetings with the plaintiff \nin May 2015 to discuss the conditions of his continued employment and \nby relying on points of contention after the meetings which he did not \nraise at those meetings. \n(f) The plaintiff had unreasonably challenged the LCA Group on his \nbonus and share of the carry on Fund II which caused a breakdown in \nthe relationship of trust and confidence between the LCA Group and the \nplaintiff.\n155 In this action, the LCA Group also seeks to justify its termination of the \nplaintiff\u2019s employment on an additional ground not set out in the termination \nletter. That additional ground is that, between March 2015 and June 2015, the \nplaintiff used his LCA Group email account to send emails containing material \nconfidential to the LCA Group to his personal email account without the LCA \nGroup\u2019s consent. The LCA Group did not include this ground in the termination \nletter because it discovered the underlying facts only afterwards, in April 2016.\nThe plaintiff\u2019s case\n156 In response, the plaintiff asserts that the LCA Group terminated his \nemployment in breach of the June 2015 Contract on two grounds:\n(a) First, none of the conduct which the LCA Group now complains \nof amounts to a breach of his employment contract at all. \nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n56(b) Second, even if he was in breach of his employment contract, the \nLCA Group failed to issue him a written notice of deficiency and failed \nto allow him an opportunity to cure the breach as it was required to do \nby the express terms of his employment contract.\n157 The gist of the plaintiff\u2019s case is that the LCA Group has contrived the \nallegation of insubordination in order to hide its true reason for terminating the \nplaintiff\u2019s employment: to \u201csuppress the plaintiff\u2019s whistleblowing and [to] \ncover up [Mr] Piette\u2019s mistake of informing the plaintiff that he would be \nentitled to US$37.5 million\u201d as his share of the carry on Fund II.103\n158 For the reasons which follow, I find that the plaintiff was indeed in \nbreach of the express and implied terms of his employment contract or in \nrepudiatory breach of his employment contract by reason of his conduct from \nAugust 2014 to June 2015, and that this conduct amounted to wilful \ninsubordination. I find also that the LCA Group terminated the plaintiff\u2019s \nemployment in accordance with the express terms of his contract and also at \ncommon law. \n159 Much of the plaintiff\u2019s case on this claim rests on his allegation that he \nwas a whistle-blower. I therefore deal first with the that aspect of the plaintiff\u2019s \ncase before turning to consider the LCA Group\u2019s grounds for the termination. \nThe plaintiff\u2019s whistleblowing\n160 The plaintiff\u2019s case is that, in the course of his employment by the LCA \nGroup, he learned of serious wrongdoing within the LCA Group in connection \nwith seven potential investments which the LCA Group made between February \n103 DWS at para 86.\nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n572012 and June 2015.104 I reject the plaintiff\u2019s case. His allegations of \nwrongdoing are exaggerated, contrived and self-serving. \n161 As the LCA Group points out, it proceeded to make only two of these \nseven investments. It did not make any of the other five investments, partly as \na result of concerns with the plaintiff raised.105 The plaintiff suggests that the \nLCA Group owed a duty to investors or its regulators to account for the reasons \nfor not making these investments. There is no basis for this suggestion. \n162 As for the remaining two investments, the plaintiff raised his concerns \nabout those potential investments in 2012 and remained silent thereafter.106 He \nreturned to his allegations about these two investments only in April 2015, when \nhis dispute with the LCA Group about the proper construction of the phrase \n\u201c2.5% carry\u201d arose was well advanced.107 The inference is irresistible that he \ndid so purely for tactical reasons. \n163 The plaintiff asserts that he discovered criminal wrongdoing, including \n\u201ccorruption\u201d, by senior executives within the LCA Group, including the third \ndefendant:108\n\u2026possible breaches of penal provisions in applicable \nlegislations [sic] (involving offences such as cheating, \ndishonestly or fraudulently making a false statement, criminal \nbreach of trust, corruption, etc) \u2026 [which] \u2026 \u201cmay also involve \nstatutory and civil wrongs like misrepresentation, breach of \nfiduciary duty, conspiracy to inflict wrongful acts etc.\n104 Plaintiff\u2019s AEIC at paras 103\u2013191\n105 Plaintiff\u2019s AEIC at paras 138\u2013180; 2 February 2021 Transcript at p 139 line 25 to p \n140 line 12.\n106 Plaintiff\u2019s AEIC at paras 103\u2013125\n107 CB 1887\u20131886.\n108 Plaintiff\u2019s AEIC at para 18; CB 1665. \nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n58His case is that he owed a fiduciary duty to investors and regulators to escalate \nand to expose this wrongdoing: what he calls \u201cwhistleblowing\u201d. It is also his \ncase that his whistleblowing resulted in a \u201cmassive clean-up\u201d where \u201cvirtually \neverybody\u2026cited in [his] whistleblowing emails has been exited\u201d from the \nLCA Group.109 \n164 Not for the first time, the plaintiff\u2019s account is wholly exaggerated. The \ntruth is far more mundane. The plaintiff accepted, when I sought clarification, \nthat by \u201ccorruption\u201d he did not mean bribe-taking.110 And by \u201cmassive clean \nup\u201d, he did not mean the prosecution, or even the summary dismissal of \nemployees found guilty of criminal wrongdoing. Those employees, including \nthe third defendant, remained with the LCA Group and left for unrelated reasons \nseveral years after the plaintiff\u2019s whistleblowing.111 And, as the LCA Group \npoints out, the third defendant continues to work closely with the LCA Group \neven after he ceased his employment and relinquished his executive positions \nwithin it.112\n165 In any event, to the extent that there was any plausible substance to the \nplaintiff\u2019s whistleblowing at all, I accept the LCA Group\u2019s evidence that both \nthe LCA Group and LVMH took his allegations seriously and did not engage in \na cover up or try to suppress the plaintiff. Arising from the plaintiff\u2019s \nallegations, LVMH appointed KPMG to conduct an internal review.

Further, I accept that the whistleblowing was a mere contrivance, \ndesigned to create leverage to be deployed in his dispute over his share of the \ncarry on Fund II. \n166 In any event, the plaintiff\u2019s whistleblowing is and was, both factually \nand legally distinct from his obligations under his employment contract in three \nsenses. First, his status as a whistleblower gave him no legal basis on which to \ndisregard his contractual obligations under his employment contract and gave \nhim no legal excuse for any breach of his employment contract. Although the \nplaintiff asserted this legal proposition in his cross-examination, his \nsubmissions cite no authority for it. Second, I accept the fourth defendant\u2019s \nevidence that the LCA Group kept entirely separate the plaintiff\u2019s performance \nor non-performance of his contractual obligations under his employment \ncontract from the action it took to investigate his allegations of wrongdoing.114 \nFinally, I also accept that the LCA Group\u2019s decision to terminate the plaintiff\u2019s \nemployment was not in any way motivated by a desire to suppress his \nwhistleblowing or to retaliate for it. Indeed, that aspect of the plaintiff\u2019s case is \nquite illogical: terminating the plaintiff\u2019s employment would not in any way \nprevent him from continuing to blow his whistle.115\nThe root cause of the plaintiff\u2019s conduct\n167 The root cause of the rupture in the employer\/employee relationship was \nthe plaintiff\u2019s unhappiness over the LCA Group\u2019s refusal to agree with him that \n113 The fourth defendant\u2019s affidavit of evidence in chief dated 9 October 202 (\u201cFourth \nDefendant\u2019s AEIC\u201d) at para 34. \n114 16 February 2021 Transcript at p 115 line 15 to p 116 line 16; Fourth Defendant\u2019s \nAEIC at para 34; CB 2043, CB 2126A, CB 2150, CB 2152, CB 2596\n115 3 February 2021 Transcript at p 28 line 9 to p 30 line 7.\nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n60he was entitled to 12.5% of the carry on Fund II. The plaintiff himself accepted \nthis.116 \n168 A turning point in the employer\/employee relationship took place in \nOctober 2014, shortly after the dispute had arisen. The LCA Group arranged a \nface-to-face meeting in London between the plaintiff, the third defendant and \nMr Piette. One Mr Raj Mitta was also in attendance.117 Mr Mitta was and still \nis a consultant to the LCA Group and a member of its Strategic Advisory \nBoard.118 The LCA Group arranged the meeting in an effort to correct the \nplaintiff\u2019s mistaken understanding of the phrase \u201c2.5% carry\u201d and to draw a line \nunder the dispute so that both parties could move forward.119 The plaintiff, \nhowever, saw the meeting as a negotiation to resolve a bona fide dispute over \nthe meaning of \u201c2.5% carry\u201d. The plaintiff\u2019s approach was fundamentally \nmistaken.\n169 The LCA Group\u2019s evidence, which I accept, is that the plaintiff was \ninsubordinate and rude to Mr Piette at this meeting.120 The meeting concluded \nwith the plaintiff declaring himself to be a \u201cdemotivated\u201d employee and \nthreatening to stop work unless the LCA Group agreed to pay him 12.5% of the \n116 CB 1674\u20131684.\n117 D&CC at paras 54 to 56.\n118 Mitta Rajsekar\u2019s affidavit of evidence in chief dated 7 November 2020 (\u201cMitta\u2019s \nAEIC\u201d) at para 3.\n119 Day 3 Transcript at p 153 lines 3\u20135, p 149 lines 11\u201313.\n120 Day 9 Transcript p 19 (lines 14-18), p 20 (line 14) \u2013 p 21 (line 12); Third Defendant\u2019s \nAEIC at paras 82\u201383; Day 11 Transcript p41 (lines 8-23); Day 7 Transcript p 18 (line \n21) \u2013 p 19 (line 17), p 52 (lines 5-25); Mitta\u2019s AEIC at paras 12, 14\u201315 and 18\u201322; \nDaniel Piette\u2019s affidavit of evidence in chief (\u201cPiette\u2019s AEIC\u201d) at paras 24\u201325\nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n61carry on Fund II.121 The LCA Group never agreed. As I have found, the LCA \nGroup was correct not to agree.\n170 From October 2014 onwards, as the plaintiff foreshadowed, he proved \nhimself to be a thoroughly demotivated employee. As a result, in February 2015, \nMr Piette and Mr Mitta122 recommended to the third defendant that the LCA \nGroup part ways with the plaintiff. But the third defendant was reluctant to do, \npreferring to try and maintain continuity in the management team by \nremotivating and retaining a demotivated senior executive.123 \n171 I now consider in turn the plaintiff\u2019s insubordination and misconduct \nfrom February 2015 to June 2015. \nDisobeying instructions to meet in Singapore\n172 In early February 2015, the third defendant instructed the plaintiff to \nreport to Singapore for a meeting on 13 March 2015.124 The plaintiff agreed to \ndo so.125 \n173 It is common ground that, on 3 March 2015, the plaintiff learned that the \nLCA Group was considering terminating his employment.126\n121Mitta\u2019s AEIC at para 18; Piette\u2019s AEIC at para 25; Third Defendant\u2019s AEIC at para \n83.\n122 Piette\u2019s AEIC at paras 29\u201330; Mitta\u2019s AEIC at paras 24\u201327. \n123Third Defendant\u2019s AEIC at paras 91\u201395. \n124 CB 1467.\n125 CB 1467.\n126 Plaintiff\u2019s AEIC at para 323\nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n62174 On 4 March 2015, the third defendant supplemented his initial \ninstruction by asking the plaintiff to stop work on all matters in order to report \nto Singapore latest by 9 March 2015 and to stay in Singapore for about a week \nafter the meeting on 13 March 2015.127 The third defendant intended to use \nthese two weeks to assign the plaintiff a new work location and work scope.128 \n175 The plaintiff did not obey this instruction. This was even though he had \nby then already agreed to report to work in Singapore for the meeting on 13 \nMarch 2015.129 Instead, the plaintiff replied on 6 March 2015 to query the third \ndefendant\u2019s instruction to stop work and to query the third defendant\u2019s \ninstruction to remain in Singapore for a two-week period around the 13 March \n2015 meeting. In the same email, the plaintiff alleged that he would face \n\u201cserious personal difficulties in travelling to Singapore in the short term\u201d130 \nbecause both his children were visiting him in India and because both his parents \nwere terminally ill and required his presence.131 In cross-examination, the \nplaintiff gave a different reason for not complying with this instruction. He \ntestified that he was reluctant to meet the third defendant in Singapore because \nhe feared that the third defendant would ask him to terminate his employment \nwith the LCA Group.\n176 The third defendant then withdrew his instruction for the plaintiff to \nreport to work in Singapore for those two weeks around 13 March 2015.

On that day he sent an email \nto the third defendant declining to report as instructed,136 saying that a meeting \nwas pointless if the LCA Group was not prepared to acknowledge the validity \nof the plaintiff\u2019s whistleblowing.

On 14 \nApril 2015,140 the third defendant sent the plaintiff a reminder about the meeting \non 24 April 2015. The plaintiff ignored the reminder. \n180 On 21 April 2015,141 the plaintiff informed the third defendant that he \nwas unable to meet him in Singapore on 24 April 2015. The reason he gave was \nthat the plaintiff had to accompany his parents for medical treatment in Mumbai \non 23 April 2015 and 24 April 2015. The third defendant immediately offered, \nas an indulgence warranted by the circumstances, to travel to Mumbai on 30 \nApril 2015 to meet the plaintiff.142 The plaintiff ignored this offer. \n181 In the meantime, the plaintiff was actually in Singapore on a personal \ntrip from 4 April 2015 to 9 April 2015.143 He could easily have made \narrangements to meet the third defendant in Singapore on a mutually convenient \ndate during this period. But the plaintiff deliberately did not inform the third \ndefendant or the LCA Group that he was in Singapore for this trip.144 \n182 On 23 April 2015, the third defendant changed the date of the meeting \nfrom 24 April 2015 to 12 May 2015 and changed the venue of the meeting from \nMumbai to Singapore.

The plaintiff did not ignore the \nfourth defendant: he confirmed that he would attend.146\n184 At trial, the plaintiff gave three reasons for refusing to obey the third \ndefendant\u2019s instructions to meet in March 2015 and April 2015. First, he said \nthat he had no obligation to obey the third defendant147 because the third \ndefendant was one of the \u201cprime accused\u201d in the plaintiff\u2019s whistleblowing.148 \nWhen it was pointed out that the plaintiff had at the time cited personal reasons \nas his justification for not obeying the third defendant\u2019s instructions, the \nplaintiff maintained that one of his reasons at that time for not obeying the third \ndefendant\u2019s instructions was because the third defendant was the subject of the \nplaintiff\u2019s whistleblowing.149 Second, he said that he did not obey the third \ndefendant\u2019s instructions to meet because there was a possibility that the LCA \nGroup would terminate his employment at the meeting. Third, he said that \nobeying the third defendant\u2019s instructions would compromise his \u201cfiduciary \nduties\u201d to the LCA Group and to the investors in its funds.\n185 It is insubordination to refuse to obey a reasonable and lawful instruction \nfrom a superior officer.

The plaintiff gives several reasons why his decision to stay on in \nMumbai after 10 April 2015 was not a breach of his employment contract.154 \n190 First, he claims that the third defendant gave him blanket approval in \n2013 to work from Mumbai as and when the plaintiff considered it necessary in \norder to care for the plaintiff\u2019s parents.155 The third defendant denies ever giving \nany such blanket approval. I accept the third defendant\u2019s evidence. The \nplaintiff\u2019s evidence is contrary to the inherent probabilities. No superior officer \nwould give a subordinate blanket approval to absent himself from his primary \nplace of work as and when the employee chose to do so. That is especially the \ncase when the other place of work is not just in another city but in another \ncountry. In the absence of specific approval from the LCA Group, it was a \nbreach of contract for the plaintiff to remain in Mumbai beyond 10 April 2015. \nThe plaintiff does not allege that there was any such specific approval. \n191 Second, the plaintiff alleges that he understood the third defendant\u2019s \noffer to meet the plaintiff in Mumbai on 24 April 2015 as an instruction that the \nplaintiff should remain in Mumbai until 24 April 2015.156 That is disingenuous \nand a pure contrivance. The third defendant\u2019s offer to the plaintiff to meet him \nin Mumbai was purely an indulgence to the plaintiff. It came only after the \n154 Plaintiff\u2019s AEIC at paras 43\u201353.\n155 Plaintiff\u2019s AEIC at paras 43\u201344; Plaintiff\u2019s FBPs to the SOC (see SDB at p 367).\n156 Plaintiff\u2019s AEIC at para 48.\nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n68plaintiff had refused to obey the third defendant\u2019s instruction to meet in \nSingapore and as an effort to accommodate the plaintiff\u2019s personal \ncircumstances with his parents\u2019 illness. The plaintiff had no basis to read the \nthird defendant\u2019s offer as an instruction to remain in Mumbai after 10 April \n2015. \n192 Finally, the plaintiff alleges that the LCA Group told him, in response \nto his query, that he did not require approval to postpone the date of his return \nfrom Mumbai to Hong Kong from 10 April 2015 to 29 April 2015.157 His case \nis that this amounts to approval for him to remain in Mumbai after 10 April \n2015. This is another disingenuous contrivance. The plaintiff\u2019s query was in \nsubstance about the LCA Group\u2019s travel and expenses policy about the cost of \npostponing his flight. It was not a query about extending his approved absence \nfrom his primary place of work. Further, the person who told him that no \napproval was required for the date change because there was no cost difference \nwas a junior member of the LCA Group\u2019s administrative staff.158 She had no \nauthority to extend the LCA Group\u2019s approval of the plaintiff\u2019s absence from \nhis primary place of work. The plaintiff himself must have known this.\n193 The plaintiff absented himself from his primary place of work under the \nJune 2014 Contract after 10 April 2015 without the approval of the LCA Group \nand without a contractual defence. He was therefore in breach of his contract.159 \nThis breach amounts to misconduct. Absenting oneself in this way from one\u2019s \nprimary place of work is conduct which destroys the relationship of trust and \n157 Plaintiff\u2019s AEIC at para 49.\n158 Plaintiff\u2019s AEIC at para 46.\n159 26 February 2021 Transcript at p 86 lines 17\u201325.\nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n69confidence which underlies a contract between employer and employee and \nwhich renders the employment relationship untenable.\nWhistleblowing to LVMH\n194 In March 2015, the plaintiff began to make his allegations of internal \nwrongdoing within the LCA Group directly to LVMH. He began on 18 March \n2015 when he emailed the third defendant160 more allegations of wrongdoing \nand forwarded a copy of that email to Mr Antonio Belloni.161 Mr Belloni was a \nmember of LVMH\u2019s board of directors and the Group Managing Director of \nLVMH. Mr Belloni was, in addition to Mr Piette, a senior executive of LVMH \nto whom the third defendant reported. The plaintiff also provided to Mr Belloni \nfurther details about his dispute with the third defendant over the meaning of \n\u201c2.5% carry\u201d. \n195 On 7 April 2015,162 the plaintiff raised more allegations of wrongdoing, \neven while he continued to ignore the third defendant\u2019s instruction to meet him \nin Singapore. The plaintiff forwarded these emails to Mr Belloni163 and to one \nMs Chantal Gaemperle.164 Ms Gaemperle is a member of LVMH\u2019s Executive \nCommittee and the Executive Vice President of Human Resources and \nSynergies of LVMH.

His entire time after that point was spent on compiling \na whistleblowing report.165 Despite this, he continued to receive and accept his \nfull salary from the LCA Group. \n198 The plaintiff\u2019s justification for this is that he read the third defendant\u2019s \n4 March 2015 email (see [ 174] above) as the third defendant\u2019s instruction to \nstop work.166 This is yet another contrivance. The thrust of this email is that the \nplaintiff should stop work until he reported to the third defendant in Singapore \nfor the third defendant to assign the plaintiff a new place of work and a new \nscope of work. The plaintiff cannot choose to follow the third defendant\u2019s \ninstruction to stop work and disregard the third defendant\u2019s instruction to report \nto Singapore to set the conditions for resuming work. \n199 I accept the LCA Group\u2019s submission that the plaintiff in substance \nrefused to work from 4 March 2015 onwards.167 This too is wilful \ninsubordination and misconduct. \n165 3 February 2021 Transcript at p 69 line 13\u2013 to p 70 line 3; Plaintiff\u2019s AEIC at para 52.\n166 3 February 2021 Transcript at p 65 (line 4) to p 66 line 19.

Accounts differ about what \nhappened at this meeting. For reasons I have already given, the plaintiff showed \nhimself throughout his testimony to be a witness more interested in advancing \nhis case than in assisting the court. I therefore accept the third defendant and the \nfourth defendant\u2019s account of this meeting as being more accurate, insofar as it \ndiffers from the plaintiff\u2019s account. Their account is also consistent with \ncontemporaneous emails which they wrote to more senior LVMH executives \nsummarising what transpired at this meeting. \n202 At this meeting, the fourth defendant left the plaintiff in no doubt that \nhe was on the brink of being dismissed summarily for insubordination. He told \nthe plaintiff that his insubordination had to cease and that he could no longer \nexpect to receive a salary despite absenting himself from his primary place of \nwork in Hong Kong, ignoring his immediate superior\u2019s instructions and doing \nno work.169 The plaintiff indicated that he wanted his employment with the LCA \nGroup to continue. The fourth defendant told him that that could happen only if \nthe plaintiff agreed to abide by certain conditions.170 The plaintiff appeared \nchastened and cooperative.

At this meeting, the third defendant set out the three conditions for \nthe plaintiff\u2019s continued employment. First, Singapore was now to be the \nplaintiff\u2019s primary place of work, with his scope of work focusing on operations \nand portfolio management. Second, the plaintiff had to accept that he was \nentitled only to 2.5% of the carry on Fund II. Finally, the plaintiff had to agree \nto draw a line under the past and to perform his contractual obligations going \nforward in a cooperative and responsive manner.175 It was clear that failure to \naccept these three conditions would lead to termination of the plaintiff\u2019s \nemployment.176 The plaintiff appeared to accept these three conditions.\n171 Exhibit D1 Tab 1; 16 February 2021 Transcript at p152 lines 12\u201321; Fourth \nDefendant\u2019s AEIC at para 42; Third Defendant\u2019s AEIC at paras 111\u2013113.\n172 Exhibit D1 Tab 2 at point 1; 2 February 2021 Transcript at p 93 lines 2\u20139.\n173 Exhibit D1 Tab 1 at points 1 and 4.\n174 Exhibit D1 Tab 1 at points 4 and 5; CB 2596.\n175Third Defendant\u2019s AEIC at para 114; Fourth Defendant\u2019s AEIC at paras 46\u201347; 17 \nFebruary 2021 Transcript at p 48 lines 2\u201323.\n176 17 February 2021 Transcript at p 36 lines 1\u201323.\nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n73206 These conditions were then recorded formally in a letter dated 28 May \n2015 issued by the LCA Group to the plaintiff.177 The LCA Group asked the \nplaintiff to accept these conditions formally by 3 June 2015.178 \n207 The plaintiff refused to accept the conditions. On 3 June 2015,179 he \nasserted that he had not been guilty of insubordination and that the LCA Group \nhad no basis to require him to accept the conditions for his employment to \ncontinue. \n208 The plaintiff then resumed his insubordination. Most notably, on 12 June \n2015,180 he made further allegations of wrongdoing directly to Ms Gaemperle. \nThis was despite the fourth defendant having instructed the plaintiff at the 12 \nMay 2015 meeting that the plaintiff should channel all future whistleblowing to \nthe fourth defendant.181\nTermination of the plaintiff\u2019s employment\n209 On 29 June 2015, the LCA Group summarily terminated the plaintiff\u2019s \nemployment.182 I accept that the plaintiff\u2019s conduct which I have outlined above \namounts not only to a breach but to a repudiatory breach of the express and \nimplied terms of his employment contract.183 The plaintiff\u2019s insubordination \nhad caused, by 29 June 2015, an irretrievable rupture in the relationship of \n177 CB 2636\u20132637.\n178 CB 2636\u20132637.\n179 CB 2678\u20132680; D&CC at paras 63(b) to 63(c).\n180 CB 2702.\n181 Fourth Defendant\u2019s AEIC at paras 49\u201350; 16 February 2021 Transcript at p 158 lines \n15-20.\n182 CB 2712\u20132715.\n183 CB 1237.\nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n74mutual trust and confidence that must subsist between and employer and an \nemployee (Piattchanine (HC) at [253]-[254] cited with approval in Piattchanine \n(CA) at [50]).\nNotice of deficiency\n210 The plaintiff next complaints that the LCA Group breached its \ncontractual obligations to him when it terminated his employment because it \nfailed to comply with cl 5.5 of the June 2015 Contract. That clause requires the \nLCA Group to give the plaintiff written notice of any deficiency in his \nperformance of his obligations under the contract and appropriate time to correct \nthe deficiency before terminating his employment:184\n5.5. If at any time during your employment by [the second \ndefendant], you shall be guilty of any serious default or grave \nmisconduct or shall neglect to give such of your time or \npersonal attention to the business of [the second defendant] as \nmay reasonably be required or shall disobey or neglect any \nlawful orders or directions given to you or shall be guilty of \nbreach of non-observance of any of the obligations on your part \nas the Employee herein contained or as defined in the agreed \njob description, [the second defendant] will provide you with a \nwritten notice of such deficiency. If after appropriate time you \nhave not corrected the deficiency, [the second defendant], at its \nsole discretion, may terminate your employment.\n211 I do not accept that the LCA Group failed to comply with cl 5.5 of the \nJune 2014 Contract. Clause 5.5 does not stipulate any specific form for the \nwritten notice of deficiency which it obliges the LCA Group to provide to the \nplaintiff. The contractual intent of cl 5.5 is to afford a measure of employment \nfairness to the plaintiff. It ensures that the plaintiff has a chance to redeem \nhimself before the LCA Group can take the final and irreversible step of \nterminating the employer\/employee relationship. It further ensure that that \n184 SOC at para 47(b).\nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n75termination will not come as a surprise to the plaintiff. Thus, the LCA Group \nmust not only give the plaintiff notice that he is at risk of termination but must \nalso tell him what deficiency has caused that risk to arise and allow him an \nappropriate amount of time to correct the deficiency. The contractual intent in \nrequiring the notice of deficiency to be in writing is to enhance the protection \nwhich cl 5.5 affords to the plaintiff by minimising the scope for \nmiscommunication or misunderstanding the contents of the notice and by \nalleviating problems of proving that notice was or was not given. The \ncontractual intent of cl 5.5 is served so long as the LCA Group gives the plaintiff \nnotice in writing of the deficiencies in his performance and allows him an \nopportunity to correct those deficiencies. So long as the plaintiff understands \nthe significance of the notice and the seriousness of the consequence that may \nensue if he does not take advantage of the opportunity afforded to him to correct \nhis deficiencies, the precise form of the notice is irrelevant to the contractual \nintent of cl 5.5.\n212 The LCA Group gave the plaintiff many such notices and opportunities. \nIt is immaterial that none of them were headed \u201cNotice of Deficiency\u201d or made \nexpress refence to cl 5.5 of the June 2014 Contract. These notices of the \nplaintiff\u2019s deficiencies include the following:185\n(a) An email from the third defendant to the plaintiff on 13 March \n2015186 warning the plaintiff not to make allegations of wrongdoing \nwithout proof.\n185 D&CC at paras 64(a) \u201364(d).\n186 CB 1664\u20131665.\nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n76(b) An email from the third defendant to the plaintiff on 6 April \n2015187 notifying the plaintiff that he had a \u201chabit of slinging mud at \nothers\u201d and that he \u201cignored various directives asking [him] to report\u201d. \nThe email also reiterated the third defendant\u2019s instruction to meet in \nSingapore given that the plaintiff was ignoring them.\n(c) The 28 May 2015 letter (see [ 206] above) which informed the \nplaintiff that he had been guilty of insubordination and invited him to \naccept the conditions for his continued employment by 3 June 2015.188\n213 It is true that the fourth defendant in cross-examination ventured an \nopinion as to whether certain written communications from the LCA Group to \nthe plaintiff were or were not notices of deficiency within the meaning of \ncl 5.5.189 I give no weight to his opinion. Whether or not a particular written \ncommunication which the LCA Group issued to the plaintiff is a notice of \ndeficiency within the meaning of cl 5.5 is a question of law. It is an issue for the \ncourt to decide. It cannot be the subject of evidence, particularly from a witness \nof fact such as the fourth defendant. Furthermore, the June 2014 Contract is \nexpressly governed by Singapore law. The issue cannot therefore even be the \nsubject of expert evidence. The fourth defendant\u2019s opinion on the issue, coming \nfrom a witness of fact and moreover on a matter of Singapore law, is quite \nirrelevant to my determination of the proper construction of cl 5.5 and its \napplication to the LCA Group\u2019s communications with the plaintiff.

The result is that the only unlawful \nmeans on which the plaintiff relies for this conspiracy did not take place.\n218 Second, I have also held that the plaintiff\u2019s whistleblowing was baseless \nand that the plaintiff\u2019s evidence is false that Mr Piette promised to pay \nUS$37.5m to the plaintiff as his share of Fund II\u2019s profit. Those findings mean \nthat there is no conceivable motive remaining for any conspiracy to terminate \nthe plaintiff\u2019s employment by unlawful means. \n190 SOC at para 49; PCS at para 166.\n191 PCS at paras 169(b) and 181 to 189.\nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n78219 Third, the plaintiff\u2019s case as to when the conspirators combined to \nterminate his employment in breach of contract was constantly shifting. His \npleadings assert that by early 2015, he \u201capprehended that concerted efforts were \nbeing made to force him out\u201d of the LCA Group.192 This is inconsistent with his \nevidence at trial. At first, he said in cross-examination that he realised in early \nAugust 2014 that there was a plot to cause him harm.193 But less than half an \nhour later in his cross-examination, he said: \u201c\u2026 from the discovery documents \nthat I have read subsequent to my termination, it seems that that [the] plot was \nhatched sometime between December 2014 and February 2015\u201d.194 The \nplaintiff\u2019s closing submissions argue that the combination took place \u201cas early \nas February 2015\u201d,195 which presumably mean no earlier than that. Three \nparagraphs later, his closing submissions assert that the plaintiff\u2019s \u201crepeated \nwhistleblowing \u2026 on corporate governance issues as early as 2012 made him a \nconstant thorn in the Defendants\u2019 side, prompting them to devise a \u201cgame plan\u201d \nto get him fired\u201d.196 The plaintiff\u2019s case as to when this combination took place \nis a complete contrivance. \n220 Fourth, the plaintiff\u2019s case as to identity of the conspirators was also \nconstantly shifting. His pleaded case is that the conspirators were the third \ndefendant, the fourth defendant, Mr Piette, Mr Belloni and Ms Gaemperle.197 \nHis affidavit of evidence in chief adds two further conspirators: Mr Mitta and \n192 SOC at paras 38 to 39.\n193 2 February 2021 Transcript at p 23 lines 15\u201322.\n194 2 February 2021 Transcript at p 34 lines 19\u201324.\n195 PCS at para 168.\n196 PCS at para 171.\n197 SOC at para 50.\nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n79one Mr Gujral.198 Mr Gujral was, at that time, the Regional Managing Director \nIndia and Structuring & Risk for the LCA Group. But in the plaintiff\u2019s cross-\nexamination, he disavowed any intention to allege that Mr Gujral was a \nconspirator.199 But he added for the first time another LVMH human resources \nexecutive, one Mr Nicolas Calemard, as a conspirator.200 Mr Calemard was \ninvolved in the drafting the 28 May 2015 letter (see [ 206] above). In his closing \nsubmissions, for good measure, the plaintiff adds the first defendant and the \nsecond defendant as conspirators.201 The plaintiff\u2019s case on the identity of the \nconspirators is a complete contrivance. \n221 If the plaintiff is held to his pleadings, and if his case is indeed that the \ncombination between the conspirators had already taken place by early 2015, it \nis impossible for any of the LVMH executives to be conspirators.

All of \nthe contemporaneous correspondence and the oral evidence shows that it was \nthe LCA Group\u2019s and the LVMH\u2019s intention to terminate the plaintiff\u2019s \nemployment strictly in accordance with his contract so as to part ways lawfully \nwith a demotivated and disruptive employee who was demanding the wholly \n198 Plaintiff\u2019s AEIC at para 331.\n199 2 February 2021 Transcript at p 5 line 16 to p 15 line 15.\n200 2 February 2021 Transcript at p 51 lines 5\u201311, p 53 lines 19\u201321, p 56 lines 5\u201311.\n201 PCS at para 163.\n202 CB 1665\u20131666, 1674\u20131676, 1887\u20131896, 1931\u20131985 and 2043\u20132062\nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n80unreasonable share of 12.5% of the carry on Fund II without any legal \njustification.\n223 Sixth, the plaintiff\u2019s case is contrary to the inherent probabilities. It was \nalways open to the LCA Group to terminate the plaintiff\u2019s employment in \naccordance with the June 2014 Contract, by giving him six months\u2019 notice.203 \nThere was no need for any of the alleged conspirators to combine to do so in \nbreach of contract. The fact that the LCA Group chose to terminate the \nplaintiff\u2019s employment summarily rather than on notice indicates to me that the \nLCA Group and the senior LVMH executive involved genuinely believed that \nthe plaintiff had been guilty of misconduct warranting summary termination, \nnot that they were conspiring to injure him by any means, lawful or unlawful.\n224 What actually happened is that the LCA Group found themselves \ndealing in 2015 with an employee who was making completely unreasonable \nand legally baseless demands for money and who, when those demands were \nrejected, became thoroughly demotivated, thoroughly recalcitrant and \nthoroughly disruptive. The situation could not be allowed to continue and the \nplaintiff could not continue to be paid for doing nothing productive and for \ndoing many things counterproductive. As a result, the LCA Group with the \nsupport of LVMH eventually resolved to terminate the plaintiff\u2019s employment \nin accordance with his contract of employment. And, as I have found, they \nsucceeded in doing so.\n225 The plaintiff\u2019s conspiracy claim is misconceived and is dismissed.\n203 2 February 2021 Transcript p 132 line 12 \u2013 p 133 line 11.\nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n81Claim 5: monthly indemnity\n226 The plaintiff\u2019s fifth claim is that the LCA Group failed to pay him a post-\ntermination monthly indemnity which was due to him under cl 9 of the June \n2014 Contract.\n227 Clause 9 of the June 2014 Contract204 is a non-compete clause. It obliges \nthe plaintiff not to be engaged in or by any business competing with the LCA \nGroup for six months after his employment with the LCA Group ceases. As \nconsideration for this non-compete obligation, if the plaintiff is unable to find \nsuitable alternative employment during this six month period, the LCA Group \nis obliged to pay the plaintiff an indemnity equivalent to 70% of his monthly \nbasic salary for every month of the six-month non-compete period. \n228 The plaintiff\u2019s case is that he was unable to find suitable alternative \nemployment and that he duly observed his non-compete obligation for the full \nsix-month non-compete period. He therefore claims the monthly indemnity for \nsix months, ie from 29 June 2015 to 29 December 2015, amounting to \n$78,321.25.205\n229 Clause 9 of the June 2014 Contract expressly provides that the LCA \nGroup is obliged to pay the plaintiff the monthly indemnity only if the plaintiff \neither: (a) informs the LCA Group in writing every month during the six-month \nperiod of the name and address of his current employer; or (b) confirms to the \nLCA Group that he is unemployed. Clause 9 goes on to provide expressly that \nfailure to provide this information or confirmation \u201cwill result in the suspension \nof the payment of the monthly indemnity\u201d. \n204 CB 1238.\n205 PCS paragraph 259.\nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n82230 The plaintiff accepts that he was bound by the non-compete clause. But \nit is common ground that the plaintiff did not provide the information or \nconfirmation to the LCA Group which cl 9 makes a condition precedent to his \nright to receive the monthly indemnity.206 This claim therefore fails. \n231 Clause 9 also gives the LCA Group the right unilaterally to denounce its \nobligation to pay the monthly indemnity to the plaintiff in writing \u201cat the time \nthe termination notice is given or payment in lieu [of notice] is made\u2026\u201d. It is \ncommon ground that the LCA Group did not denounce cl 9 in writing at the \ntime it issued notice of termination to the plaintiff on 29 June 2015. Instead, the \nLCA Group denounced cl 9 in writing only by a separate email sent on 16 July \n2015.207 The LCA Group relies on this notice as a valid denunciation of cl 9. \nGiven my finding that the plaintiff failed to fulfil the condition precedent to his \nright to receive the monthly indemnity, it is not necessary for me to decide \nwhether this written notice in July 2015 does or does not amount to a valid \ndenunciation of the LCA Group\u2019s obligation under cl 9. \n232 The plaintiff argues that the LCA Group\u2019s email of 16 July 2015 was an \ninvalid denunciation and amounted itself to a breach of contract, thereby \nreleasing him from any obligation under cl 9 to provide the information or \nconfirmation about his employment status in order to be entitled to receive the \nmonthly indemnity. \n233 This argument is misconceived. The provisions in cl 9 relating to \ndenunciation do not oblige the plaintiff to denounce cl 9. They merely provide \nthat if it chooses to do so, it must do so in writing and, on the plaintiff\u2019s case, \n206 3 February 2021 Transcript at p 126 line 18 to p 128 line 10.\n207 CB 2725; 3 February 2021 Transcript at p 125 line 25 to p 126 line 4.\nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n83on 29 June 2015. Even if the plaintiff is correct that the 16 July 2015 email is \nnot a valid denunciation within the meaning of cl 9, that invalidity is its only \nconsequence. The failed attempt to denounce cl 9 on 16 July 2015 does not put \nthe LCA Group in breach of contract or even in anticipatory breach of contract. \nThe effect of the invalid denunciation is that cl 9 simply continues to bind the \nparties in accordance with its terms. The plaintiff continued to be entitled to \nreceive the monthly indemnity from the LCA Group. But the express condition \nprecedent to be fulfilled month by month to receive the monthly indemnity \ncontinued to bind the plaintiff. That condition precedent was never fulfilled \nduring the six month non-compete period. \n234 The plaintiff\u2019s claim for the monthly indemnity fails. \nClaim 6: stigma loss\n235 The plaintiff\u2019s sixth claim is that the LCA Group terminated his \nemployment contract in breach of contract and in breach of the implied term of \nmutual trust and confidence in the contract, thereby attaching a stigma to him \nin the employment market by reason of which he has to date been unable to find \nany employment.\n236 I assume, without deciding, that there is an implied term of mutual trust \nand confidence in every employment contract governed by Singapore law (Wee \nKim San Lawrence Bernard v Robinson & Co (Singapore) Pte Ltd [2014] 4 SLR \n357 (\u201cWee Kim San\u201d) at [24]). I also assume, without deciding, that the decision \nof the House of Lords in Malik v Bank of Credit and Commerce International \nSA [1988] AC 20 (\u201cMalik\u201d), approved obiter in Wee Kim San, represents the \nlaw in Singapore. I also assume in the plaintiff\u2019s favour, contrary to my finding, \nthat the LCA Group terminated the plaintiff\u2019s employment in breach of contract \nand, more specifically, in breach of this implied term.\nVersion No 1: 28 Jan 2022 (16:23 hrs)\nUday Mehra v L Capital Asia Advisors[2022] SGHC 23\n84237 Even with the benefit of all these assumptions, this claim is \nmisconceived. As the LCA Group points out, if all that an employer does is to \nterminate an employee\u2019s employment in breach of the implied term of mutual \ntrust and confidence, \u201cthe only damages recoverable by the employee will be \ndamages for premature termination losses flowing from the employer\u2019s failure \nto give proper notice or pay salary in lieu of notice\u201d (Wee Kim San at [34] and \n[36]). There is in this situation no scope for the employee to recover \u201cstigma \nloss\u201d. \n238 The plaintiff\u2019s case is simply that the LCA Group committed a breach \nof the implied term of mutual trust and confidence when it terminated his \nemployment on 29 June 2015. The plaintiff does not allege that the LCA Group \nbreached the implied term in any other way. Thus, for example, it is not the \nplaintiff\u2019s case that the LCA Group engaged in corrupt business practices which \ncaused a stigma to attach to its employees, as in Malik. \n239 Therefore, even if the LCA Group had terminated the plaintiff\u2019s \nemployment in breach of the implied term of mutual trust and confidence, there \nwould be no scope for the plaintiff to recover any damages under the rule in \nMalik. The result is a fortiori, given that I have found that the LCA Group \ncommitted no breach of contract whatsoever in terminating the plaintiff\u2019s \nemployment. It was the plaintiff who breached the contract by his sustained and \nwilful insubordination and misconduct from February 2015 to June 2015. \n240"}

{"casename":"2022_SGHC_237","fact":"background for Mr Wong\u2019s wrongful act, and was not itself to be impugned.\nThe SILE\u2019s investigations\n11 When the similarities between the two scripts were discovered, the SILE \ncontacted Mr Wong for an interview, which took place on 17 February 2021. \nTo his credit, Mr Wong was quick to admit his misconduct to the interviewers. \nHe also did not seek to downplay the wrongfulness of his actions and was fully \ncooperative in providing the SILE with documents relevant to its investigation. \nHe handed to the SILE (a) digital copies of the notes he had prepared for and \nused during the Mediation paper; (b) digital copies of the two scripts which he \nsubmitted at 12.06pm and 12.14pm; (c) the auto-generated acknowledgement \nemails he had received after making those submissions; and (d) the email from \nthe other candidate attaching that candidate\u2019s submitted script. These materials \nfacilitated the SILE\u2019s determination of what had happened. \n12 Here, I would draw a marked distinction between the ways in which \nMr Wong and Mr Leon Tay (\u201cMr Tay\u201d) conducted themselves during the \nSILE\u2019s investigations. As I set out in Re Leon Tay at [7]\u2013[10], Mr Tay took the \nposition that he and Ms Lynn Kuek did not collude or communicate during the \nexamination, but, instead, had arrived at substantially identical answers as a \nresult of their use of common study notes. The SILE therefore asked to examine \nthose notes to test the truth of his claim. This, however, was not a smooth and \neasy process. There was some suggestion that he had altered the study notes he \nsent to the SILE and had otherwise attempted to hinder its review of such notes \n(Re Leon Tay at [9]). Mr Wong, by contrast, demonstrated remorse and \nforthrightness in his dealings with the SILE, right from the outset. For this, I \nVersion No 1: 26 Sep 2022 (12:06 hrs)\nRe Wong Wai Loong Sean[2022] SGHC 237\n7gave him some credit, though this was somewhat diminished by (a) the fact that \nMr Wong then wholly failed to disclose this cheating incident in his admissions \naffidavit; and (b) more problematically, his explanation for such failure. I turn \nnext to this issue.\nNon-disclosure in admissions affidavit\n13 On 8 March 2022, Mr Wong was notified that he had passed his 2021 \nresitting of the Part B examinations. Three days later, on 11 March 2022, he \nfiled AAS 100. On 22 April 2022, he filed his admissions affidavit in support \nof AAS 100, but he made no mention in paragraph 7(j) of this affidavit that the \nSILE had issued a r 12(5) notice against him under the 2011 Rules in respect of \nthe 2020 Part B examinations and that he had been deprived of a pass in the \nMediation paper as a result of his cheating. Paragraph 7, generally, requires \napplicants to disclose any facts relevant to their suitability to be admitted as an \nadvocate and solicitor. This would include such things as whether they had \ncommitted any criminal offences, whether they had been found guilty of any \nprofessional misconduct, or whether they had any physical or mental conditions \nwhich impair or may impair their ability to practice. Paragraph 7(j) was a catch-\nall section of the admissions affidavit in which applicants were meant to \ndisclose any fact which could affect their suitability to be admitted. Mr Wong\u2019s \nfailure to mention anything in this context did not go unnoticed. On 11 May \n2022, the SILE contacted Mr Wong and asked that he file a further affidavit \ndisclosing the fact that disciplinary action had been taken against him. Mr Wong \ncomplied, and, on 19 May 2020, he filed a supplementary affidavit setting out \nall events relevant to his cheating in the 2020 Mediation paper (\u201cMr Wong\u2019s \nSecond Affidavit\u201d). The stakeholders did not dispute that the account set out in \nthis affidavit was complete and honest.\nVersion No 1: 26 Sep 2022 (12:06 hrs)\nRe Wong Wai Loong Sean[2022] SGHC 237\n814 However, Mr Wong\u2019s Second Affidavit did not explain why, in the first \ninstance, he had failed to disclose even the fact of this incident at paragraph 7(j) \nof his admissions affidavit. Therefore, on 6 July 2022, the AG\u2019s Chambers \nwrote to Mr Wong asking that he explain, in a further affidavit, his failure to \nmake such disclosure. On 7 July 2022, Mr Wong filed an affidavit providing his \nexplanation (\u201cMr Wong\u2019s Third Affidavit\u201d). He claimed that he genuinely \nbelieved that the SILE had forgiven the cheating incident, and, therefore, that it \ndid not need to be disclosed. He referenced three bases in support of this belief:\n(a) The first was that the r 12(5) notice only mentioned that he had \nbeen deprived of a pass without more, and, further, in the email to which \nthe r 12(5) notice was attached, the SILE also invited him to apply to \nretake the papers which he had failed. Mr Wong interpreted this situation \nas the SILE granting him a chance to make good his mistake. \n(b) The second concerned the SILE\u2019s response to an email Mr Wong \nhad sent on 18 March 2022, after he had filed AAS 100 but before he \nfiled his admissions affidavit. In his email, Mr Wong wrote to the SILE \nto request its standard certificate confirming, for the purposes of his \napplication to be admitted, that he was a \u201cqualified person\u201d within s 2(1) \nof the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, Rev Ed 2009) and that he had \nfulfilled the requisite training and examination criteria. On 21 and 22 \nMarch 2022, the SILE sent two emails to Mr Wong, neither of which \ncontained directions that he was to declare the cheating incident in his \nadmissions affidavit.\n(c) The last concerned the widespread media coverage of Re CTA \nand other matters [2022] SGHC 87 (\u201cRe CTA\u201d) on 18 April 2022, \nshortly before Mr Wong filed his admissions affidavit. After reading \nabout the nature of the cheating acts of the candidates associated with \nVersion No 1: 26 Sep 2022 (12:06 hrs)\nRe Wong Wai Loong Sean[2022] SGHC 237\n9that decision \u2013 which seemed to involve collusion across multiple papers \n\u2013 Mr Wong concluded that the SILE had allowed him to retake the Part \nB examinations and had not directed him to declare his cheating incident \nbecause, relative to the misconduct seen in those cases, his own was \u201cnot \nas grave\u201d. This further contributed to Mr Wong\u2019s genuine belief that his \nmisconduct had been forgiven, and, thus, did not need to be declared.\n15 The representatives of the AG, the Law Society and the SILE did not \naccept Mr Wong\u2019s explanation, and, at the Hearing, they maintained objections \nto the non-disclosure of the cheating incident in his admissions affidavit. On \nthis issue, the primary submissions were made by the AG\u2019s representative, \nMr Jeyendran, who pressed with some force the contention that Mr Wong\u2019s \nnon-disclosure revealed at least some dishonesty. This argument was bolstered \nby Mr Kenneth Lim, the representative for the Law Society, who took me \nthrough a page on the Society\u2019s website which provides guidance to basic but \ncommon uncertainties surrounding the admissions process \n(www.lawsociety.org.sg\/our-community\/admissions). These answers, \nMr Kenneth Lim argued, should have pointed Mr Wong in the right direction:\nWhat do I have to declare in paragraph 7 of my Affidavit of \nAdmission? Examples?\nPlease refer to the Second Schedule of the Legal Profession \n(Admission) Rules 2011.\nExamples include the following:\n(i) Criminal offences committed in Singapore and overseas\n(ii) Academic offences committed in school\/university (eg. \nCollusion, plagiarism, academic malpractice etc)\n(iii) Traffic offences\n(iv) Littering offences\n(v) Offences committed during National Service that \nresulted in you getting charged (eg. Detention barracks, \nfines, stoppage of leave etc)\nVersion No 1: 26 Sep 2022 (12:06 hrs)\nRe Wong Wai Loong Sean[2022] SGHC 237\n10(vi) Medical conditions that may affect your suitability to \npractice (eg. Physical or mental conditions) \nIf you are unsure, please declare it.\nI am not sure if I should declare the offence\/condition in \nparagraph 7? What do I do?\nYou are required to make the full 10 declarations without \nexclusion. If you are unsure, you are advised to declare it to be \nsafe.\nI do not think the condition affects my suitability to \npractise. Can I choose not to declare it in my affidavit?\nIt is not up to the applicant to decide on their suitability to be \nadmitted to the bar\/to practice. This is up to the relevant \nstakeholders. If you are unsure, it is always best to declare. \nFailure to make a declaration may have serious consequences \n(eg. Such as relevant stakeholders objecting to your admission \nto the bar)\nWhat happens when I make a declaration under Paragraph \n7 of my affidavit?\nYou will be asked to provide more details in the form of a \nsupplementary affidavit and exhibit any relevant documents \n(eg. Charge sheet, medical report).\nFor example, if you have declared a medical condition, you will \nbe asked to submit a detailed medical report from your doctor \nwhich states that you are fit to be admitted and to practice.\n[emphasis added in italics]\n16 Having considered the guidance provided by the Law Society, I accepted \nMr Jeyendran\u2019s and Mr Kenneth Lim\u2019s arguments that Mr Wong\u2019s non-\ndisclosure was unsatisfactory. While I did not think that the explanation \nMr Wong provided to account for his non-disclosure was entirely untruthful \n(see [ 14] above), I, equally, was not persuaded that his belief was reasonable in \nall the circumstances. First of all, apart from the questions and answers set out \non the Law Society\u2019s website, it bears highlighting that the cover of every \nquestion paper for the Part B examinations contained the following instructions:\nVersion No 1: 26 Sep 2022 (12:06 hrs)\nRe Wong Wai Loong Sean[2022] SGHC 237\n11You must not collaborate, consult or communicate with any one \nor any entity (other than the Institute) in any manner during \nthe Examinations. Anyone who does this (and those who assist \nthem) can expect to be dealt with severely. If you are found to \nhave collaborated, consulted or communicated with any one or \nany entity in any manner during the Examinations, you would \nbe required, when seeking admission as an Advocate and \nSolicitor, to declare the incident in your affidavit of admission as \nan Advocate and Solicitor, and the Institute may object to your \nadmission as an Advocate and Solicitor.\n[emphasis in italics]\n17 In any case, even without these various sources directing Mr Wong to \nerr on the side of caution when it came to making disclosures, it seemed to me \nthat his explanation was more in the vein of wishful thinking than a grounded, \nreasonable belief, or as he put it, a \u201cgenuine belief\u201d. In the media coverage of \nRe CTA, it was reported that five of the six applicants were required to retake \nthe papers in respect of which they were denied passes because of their cheating, \nand the remaining applicant was required to reattend the entire Part B course. In \nthis light, I did not think that the mere fact that the SILE allowed Mr Wong to \nretake the papers which he had failed was indicative of much of anything, much \nless forgiveness specifically relieving him of any obligation to inform the other \nstakeholders as well as the court of the cheating incident. The same went for the \nfact that the SILE did not give any directions on disclosure in its emails on 21 \nand 22 March 2022 (see [ 14(b)] above). These struck me as far too thin bases \nfor Mr Wong to have reasonably reached the conclusion he did.\n18 In fact, I did not think Mr Wong himself fully bought into this belief. In \nhis Third Affidavit, he concluded his explanation for his non-disclosure with \nthe following paragraph: \nFrom 20\u201322 April 2022, I started preparing and began drafting \nmy Affidavit for Admission. When drafting my Affidavit for \nAdmission, I came across paragraph 7(j) that required editing. \nWhen editing the paragraph, I remember thinking whether I \nshould disclose the cheating incident. At that time, it was my \nVersion No 1: 26 Sep 2022 (12:06 hrs)\nRe Wong Wai Loong Sean[2022] SGHC 237\n12genuine belief in my mind that SILE had indicated that they had \nforgiven me based on [my explanation] above, and that my \ncheating incident had hopefully been swept under the rug. I \nthus foolishly decided not to disclose the cheating incident \nbased on this hope. I wish to say here that my non-disclosure \nwas not with fraudulent intentions. I was not actively thinking \nwith the intention in my mind to purposely deceive anybody, \nalthough the result of my actions ended up as deceit. I was \nfrightened by the thought that my legal life would come to an \nend and desperately wanted to believe that there was still hope \nfor me. I just could not take up the courage to mention my \ndisappointing act again.\nThis explanation, in my view, spoke for itself.\n19 That being said, I did not agree with Mr Jeyendran that Mr Wong\u2019s non-\ndisclosure rose to the level of dishonesty. In reaching this conclusion, I took into \naccount the fact that Mr Wong\u2019s conduct was distinguishable from that seen in \nRe Leon Tay. There, not only did Mr Tay maintain the false claim that the \nsimilarities between his answers and those of Ms Lynn Kuek could be explained \nby their use of common study notes, he also made deliberately selective and \nincomplete disclosures notwithstanding the fact that the SILE had specifically \ndirected him to provide enough information to enable all parties concerned to \nunderstand the matter (Re Leon Tay at [11] and [33]). Mr Wong, by contrast, \nwas candid from his very first interview with the SILE and there was thus no \nreason to think that he was embarking on a bid to conceal his misconduct \ndishonestly. Put another way, given his earlier honesty, and the fact that the full \nextent of his misconduct was known to the SILE \u2013 whom Mr Wong must have \nknown could easily and likely would inform the other two stakeholders and \ncertainly the court \u2013 I did not think that Mr Wong actually believed that he \nwould be able to hide anything. Absent this belief, in the circumstances, I did \nnot think he could be said to have acted dishonestly. \nVersion No 1: 26 Sep 2022 (12:06 hrs)\nRe Wong Wai Loong Sean[2022] SGHC 237\n1320 In my judgment, Mr Wong\u2019s non-disclosure was more aptly seen as a \nvery bad misjudgement brought about by his misguided and na\u00efve wishful \nthinking. However, this did not excuse his omission. Having applied his mind \nspecifically to whether disclosure ought to be made (see [ 18] above), wishful \nthinking was not a good reason to reach the decision he did. The fact that he \ndecided not to disclose the cheating incident thus points to a lack of candour, \nwhich all advocates and solicitors, or, applicants seeking to become advocates \nand solicitors, must strive to avoid. This is especially important when it comes \nto disclosures that are called for when facing up to difficult situations. Hence, \nin my assessment of SUM 2501, I gave some weight to the fact that Mr Wong \ndid not make any disclosure in his admissions affidavit. \nThe appropriate period of Mr Wong\u2019s undertaking\n21 I next turn to how I weighed the relevant considerations (see [ 3] above) \nin arriving at my decision that Mr Wong should undertake for two years not to \nbring a fresh application to be admitted as an advocate and solicitor (see [ 5(a)] \nabove). \n22 The first consideration was the seriousness of his misconduct. In my \nview, the severity of Mr Wong\u2019s act of cheating, despite his \u201cpanic\u201d, was not to \nbe understated. At the Hearing, I accepted that Mr Wong\u2019s misconduct did not \nappear to be as grave as that, for example, seen in Re Leon Tay. After all, apart \nfrom what is set out at [ 8] above, Mr Wong did not communicate improperly \nwith anyone during the Mediation paper with a view to cheating; nor was there \ncollusion in his case. However, these differences should not trivialise the \nseverity of Mr Wong\u2019s misconduct. In and of itself, such misconduct betrayed \na fundamental disregard for doing what was plainly right. Even in his panic, it \nshould never have crossed Mr Wong\u2019s mind to do what he did. The most that \nVersion No 1: 26 Sep 2022 (12:06 hrs)\nRe Wong Wai Loong Sean[2022] SGHC 237\n14can be said in his favour is that his misconduct followed from a snap judgment \nwhich was acted upon within a span of just two or three minutes. But this did \nnot weigh meaningfully as a mitigating factor in my assessment of Mr Wong\u2019s \ncharacter issues. The practice of law is dynamic, often stressful, and frequently \nfast-paced. There are numerous circumstances in which lawyers need to make \ndecisions quickly, and even these must be made with honesty, care and due \ndiligence. And, while there is at least a logical nexus between time-pressure and \nlack of care, it should never be difficult for a lawyer faced with the need to make \na quick decision to do so honestly. \n23 The snap decision Mr Wong made in his panic simply displayed his \nwillingness and capacity to cheat when placed under pressure. I also found it \ntroubling that, when pressed to the wall, Mr Wong was willing to appropriate \nthe work of another as his own without even seeking that other person\u2019s \npermission. This pointed to a lack of respect or regard for others and also \nsuggested a quite serious character defect, which, in my view, would require \nsome time to address.\n24 The second and third considerations (see [ 3] above) have been discussed \nat [11]\u2013[ 20] above. I shall not restate my analysis and, here, it suffices for me \nto draw my earlier discussion to a close. As stated at [ 12], I gave some credit to \nMr Wong for his candour with the SILE during its investigations, but I was also \nacutely mindful of the non-disclosure in his admissions affidavit. On the whole, \nI took the view that these circumstances were more revealing of character issues \nthan they were not. This therefore did affect my assessment of SUM 2501 to \nsome degree. \n25 Finally, in respect of the fourth and fifth considerations (see [ 3] above), \nMr Goh Pek San (\u201cMr Goh\u201d) of P S Goh & Co \u2013 Mr Wong\u2019s supervising \nVersion No 1: 26 Sep 2022 (12:06 hrs)\nRe Wong Wai Loong Sean[2022] SGHC 237\n15solicitor during his practice training \u2013 came forth to attest to Mr Wong\u2019s regret \nand remorse, his generally good character, as well as his willingness to work on \nhis faults. Mr Goh also stated that he would continue to supervise Mr Wong as \na mentor and a senior member of the profession. I was aware that Mr Wong did \nnot give evidence on the steps he had taken or planned to take, so as to work on \nthe character issues which he identified in himself. However, I did not hold this \nagainst him. Mr Wong was not specifically asked to provide such information, \nand, given the relative novelty of these types of cases, I did not think it would \nhave been fair to expect this as a matter of course. I trusted that, by working \nwith Mr Goh as a mentor, he would be able to devise a thoughtful and \nproductive plan. However, it may be noted that such information may be helpful \nto a court faced with such issues in the future.\n26 Drawing all of these considerations together, Mr Goh submitted at the \nHearing that it was sufficient for Mr Wong to undertake not to bring a fresh \napplication to be admitted for a period of up to one and a half years. This was \nconsistent with the position taken by Mr Kenneth Lim for the Law Society. The \nSILE took no position. Mr Jeyendran, however, submitted that a term of four \nyears was necessary. I considered this to be unduly lengthy. The AG accepted \nthat there was no collusion or premeditation, and, as I have explained above, the \nfact that Mr Wong failed to disclose his misconduct in his admissions affidavit \nneeded to be seen in the light of his candour with the SILE in the first discussion. \n27 In the face of the AG\u2019s submission, I should reiterate that the objective \nof deferment in admissions cases is not punitive. A defined period of deferment \nserves two purposes from two different perspectives. From the perspective of \nthe applicant, it is a clear timeframe within which they should aim to resolve \nany and all character issues which their misconduct reveals. Accordingly, when \nan applicant proposes a period of time, that proposal needs to be realistic, not \nVersion No 1: 26 Sep 2022 (12:06 hrs)\nRe Wong Wai Loong Sean[2022] SGHC 237\n16overly optimistic. From the perspective of the stakeholders, it is a period of time \nat the end of which they should have confidence that the applicant can, with \nbest efforts, return with whatever that is necessary to renew trust in their \nsuitability to be admitted. The stakeholders should be forthcoming with \nguidance and advice to aid in this process of rehabilitation. They also need to \nbe balanced in this regard. It is their duty to protect the public interest by \nidentifying individuals who are not suited to be admitted. However, in doing so, \nthey should not take an unduly pessimistic view of applicants who have erred. \nYoung men and women who have made a mistake should be encouraged to learn \nfrom this and to emerge better and stronger. The task of the court in this context \nis to find the right balance between views that are too optimistic and those that \nare too pessimistic. \n28 In these premises, I determined that a period of not less than two years \nwas necessary. This was not an insubstantial period, and, in my judgment, it was \njustified by three factors in particular. The first was the severity of Mr Wong\u2019s \nact of cheating as I have explained at [ 22]\u2013[ 23] above. The second was the fact \nthat he appropriated and passed off the other candidate\u2019s work as his own. These \nfactors signified not only a lack of integrity, but, as I have noted, a lack of \nrespect for the efforts of others. The last was his total failure to make any \ndisclosure in his admissions affidavit. As stated, I did not construe this as an \nomission driven by a dishonest intent to conceal. However, it nevertheless \ndisplayed a lack of moral courage and candour on his part; courage and candour \nwhich he ought to have maintained resolutely from his first interview with the \nSILE. \n29 Mr Wong will do well to use these two years to reflect upon and to \nidentify the sources of and solutions to the specific character faults underlying \nthese aspects of his misconduct. With such reflection, I believe he will likely be \nVersion No 1: 26 Sep 2022 (12:06 hrs)\nRe Wong Wai Loong Sean[2022] SGHC 237\n17able to work through these issues effectively, to enable him to return \u2013 if he so \nwishes \u2013 with a fresh application in respect of which the stakeholders and this \ncourt can have confidence.\nMs Ong Jia Yi Joleen, Mr Lim Zi Yi and Ms Annabelle Au Jia En\n30 I turn next to my decisions in respect of the applications to withdraw \nAAS 121, 124 and 125. \n(a) AAS 121 concerned Ms Ong Jia Yi Joleen (\u201cMs Ong\u201d) and her \nwithdrawal application was HC\/SUM 3008\/2022 (\u201cSUM 3008\u201d). At the \nHearing, I allowed SUM 3008 subject to the Conditions of Withdrawal \n(see [ 5] above), save that the period determined to be suitable for her to \nundertake not to bring a fresh application to be admitted, was three years \nfrom 26 August 2022, the date of my decision. \n(b) AAS 124 and 125 concerned Mr Lim Yi Zi (\u201cMr Lim\u201d) and \nMs Annabelle Au Jia En (\u201cMs Au\u201d). Their applications for withdrawal \nwere HC\/SUM 3009\/2022 (\u201cSUM 3009\u201d) and HC\/SUM 3010\/2022 \n(\u201cSUM 3010\u201d) respectively. I allowed SUMs 3009 and 3010 subject to \nthe Conditions of Withdrawal and determined that the periods for which \nthey should, appropriately, undertake not to bring fresh applications \nwere one year in respect of Mr Lim and nine months in respect of \nMs Au. Both these periods were also to run from 26 August 2022. \n31 I now explain how I determined these to be the suitable periods.\nGeneral background\n32 Ms Ong and Mr Lim attended the same university but were, at the time, \nonly somewhat acquainted. They got to know each other better after graduating \nVersion No 1: 26 Sep 2022 (12:06 hrs)\nRe Wong Wai Loong Sean[2022] SGHC 237\n18and returning to Singapore to sit for the Part A examinations, also administered \nby the SILE. Ms Ong and Ms Au were not from the same university but met \nwhilst interning at a law firm. The three became friends and were part of the \nsame study group for the Part B examinations. This group initially included \nseveral other candidates but, at some point, Ms Ong, Mr Lim and Ms Au \ndecided that it would be more effective for them to work in a smaller group. \nThey therefore formed their own study group of just three. \n33 In this smaller study group, the trio focused on the preparation of what I \nwill refer to hereafter as \u201cstock answers\u201d. These are prepared paragraphs \u2013 \ntypically of generic material such as, for example, statements of the law or \nprinciples applicable to a specific area \u2013 which they could copy and paste into \ntheir answer scripts. This served, they explained, to alleviate some time-pressure \nfrom having to retype such material in full. It should be noted that this practice \nwas permitted during the 2020 session of the Part B examinations because \ncandidates were not required to use dedicated testing software which precluded \ncopying and pasting into and from the application. Candidates\u2019 scripts were \nMicrosoft Word documents which, as mentioned, they submitted through the \nSILE\u2019s website (see [ 7] above). On the face of the materials placed before me \nat the Hearing, there was some uncertainty as to whether this practice was \nagainst the SILE\u2019s examination rules, especially in cases where two or more \ncandidates\u2019 scripts turn up similarities because they used a common set of stock \nanswers. I therefore pressed the SILE\u2019s representative, Mr Avery Chong \n(\u201cMr Chong\u201d), to clarify this. \n34 Mr Chong, after taking instructions, confirmed two points. First, it was \nnot against the 2020 examination rules for candidates to copy and paste answers \nin this manner into their scripts. Second, he confirmed that candidates were also \nnot precluded from using common stock answers so long as they did not \nVersion No 1: 26 Sep 2022 (12:06 hrs)\nRe Wong Wai Loong Sean[2022] SGHC 237\n19communicate during the examination. Thus, where similarities were observed \nbetween two candidates\u2019 scripts, a review of those scripts would be conducted \nby the SILE to determine whether they were of such nature and extent that they \ncould fairly be explained by the candidates\u2019 use of common stock answers, or \nwhether it was more appropriate to infer that the candidates must have \ncommunicated during the examination in arriving at their similar answers. Such \na review, of course, would only be necessary in cases where the candidates \nmaintained that any similarities between their scripts were to be explained by \ntheir use of common stock answers, and not by reason of any wrongful \ncommunication. As I will turn to explain from [ 44] below, the clarification that \ncandidate were not precluded from using common stock answers was of great \nsignificance.\n35 For now, however, I return to the study group of these three candidates. \nTheir study sessions took place during the height of the pandemic, and so they \nused an online communication platform called \u201cDiscord\u201d to meet virtually. \nMs Ong, Mr Lim and Ms Au each explained that they did not create their \nDiscord channel with a view to collaborating or colluding during the \nexaminations. It was only intended to be a platform for hosting discussions in \nthe course of their preparations. However, for reasons which were not made \nclear either in their affidavits or at the Hearing, Ms Ong and Mr Lim had left \nthe Discord application running on their respective computers during at least \ntwo papers of the Part B examinations: Mediation, and Ethics and Professional \nResponsibility (\u201cEthics\u201d). Ms Au had also done so at least during the Ethics \npaper. This was despite the clear instruction to candidates that communicating \nduring the examination was not permitted (see [ 16] above), and, therefore, in \nthe absence of any reason for them to have left such applications running during \nthe two-hour and 15-minute window of each paper, one could have construed \nthis as an indicator of possible premeditation.\nVersion No 1: 26 Sep 2022 (12:06 hrs)\nRe Wong Wai Loong Sean[2022] SGHC 237\n2036 As I will explain in greater detail momentarily, Ms Ong and Mr Lim \nadmitted to communicating during the Mediation paper in breach of the \nexamination rules, and all three of them admitted to communicating during the \nEthics paper. However, they maintained before me that such communications \nwere spontaneous, not premeditated, and had been triggered by Ms Ong\u2019s \npanicked calls for assistance. The stakeholders did not suggest that these \nexplanations were untruthful, and there was nothing that objectively suggested \nthat Ms Ong, Mr Lim and Ms Au, by the time they appeared before me at the \nHearing, had not put forth complete and honest accounts of their misconduct. \nThere was, accordingly, no basis for me to view the fact that they had left the \nDiscord application running during the examination as indicative of an intention \nto communicate and cheat beforehand. I therefore gave them the benefit of the \ndoubt and put it down to inadvertence on their part.\nThe admitted cheating incidents\n37 With the general background set out in some detail, the trio\u2019s admitted \ncheating incidents can be stated more briefly. First, on 25 November 2020, \nbetween 10am and 12pm, Ms Ong attempted most of the Mediation paper by \nherself in accordance with the SILE\u2019s examination rules. However, she was \nunable to complete a part of the final question carrying ten marks of the paper\u2019s \ntotal 100 marks. Faced with this, Ms Ong claimed that she panicked and \ncontacted Mr Lim on Discord. In her panic, she requested that he send her his \nanswer to that question. When he obliged, Ms Ong proceeded to copy his entire \nresponse before submitting her script through the SILE\u2019s website. As before \n(see [ 10] above), I reviewed the side-by-side comparison between their scripts \nand was satisfied that this was the extent of her copying.\nVersion No 1: 26 Sep 2022 (12:06 hrs)\nRe Wong Wai Loong Sean[2022] SGHC 237\n2138 Unbitten the first time, Ms Ong seemed twice emboldened. The Ethics \npaper was held on 1 December 2020, also between 10am and 12pm. Due to \ncertain technical faults with the SILE\u2019s website, the Ethics paper was released \napproximately ten minutes late. Ms Ong explained that this put her in a state of \npanic and anxiety for the entire paper. She also claimed that she did not realise \nthe SILE had extended the paper by 15 minutes on account of the delayed \nrelease. Thus, near what she thought was the end of the Ethics paper, Ms Ong \ncontacted Mr Lim and Ms Au on their Discord channel, pleading that they help \nher by, once again, providing their answers to the questions she had not even \nattempted. They obliged, and, as with the Mediation paper before, Ms Ong then \nsubmitted her script for the Ethics paper with answers copied wholly from her \npeers. The irony of such misconduct in the context of the Ethics paper was \npalpable.\n39 My review of the side-by-side comparison of the trio\u2019s Ethics scripts, \nhowever, was not particularly fruitful. It emerged from the accounts I was given \nthat Ms Ong\u2019s script had 18 blocks of texts which matched Mr Lim\u2019s script and \n44 blocks which matched Ms Au\u2019s script, with an overall similarity of around \n78%. Ms Ong, Mr Lim and Ms Au each attempted to account for some matching \nblocks by reference to their common stock answers. This was not helpful as far \nas I was concerned. Without access to their stock answers (which had not been \nexhibited), there was little I could do to determine the extent to which Ms Ong \ncopied Mr Lim\u2019s and Ms Au\u2019s answers. Further, although they each were able \nto correlate some of the matching blocks to their individual stock answers, there \nwere conspicuous gaps in their accounts. In respect of the matching blocks \nnumbered 1, 2, 4\u20139, 19, 23, 24, 27 and 29, all three applicants could point to a \nlocation in their notes from which the block was lifted. However, for the block \nnumbered 33, for example, Ms Ong could point to a place in her notes, but \nMr Lim and Ms Au were unable to do the same; in respect of the block \nVersion No 1: 26 Sep 2022 (12:06 hrs)\nRe Wong Wai Loong Sean[2022] SGHC 237\n22numbered 30, Mr Lim was unable to point to a location in his notes, although \nMs Ong and Ms Au were able to; and, as regards the block numbered 21, only \nMr Lim was able to account for the block by reference to his notes. These are \nonly illustrations. \n40 This uncertainty was not satisfactory. In so far as Ms Ong\u2019s character \nissues were concerned, the extent of her copying was, in my view, relevant. Just \nas a willingness to cheat in multiple papers could be indicative of a more serious \ncharacter defect than a willingness only to cheat in one, the capacity to copy \nmore of her peers\u2019 answers could have given rise to a similar inference in respect \nof Ms Ong. In fact, in Ms Ong\u2019s case, the inference could have gone beyond \nthis. Her evidence was that she had contacted Mr Lim and Ms Au close to the \nend of the examination to plead for their assistance. If, however, the extent of \nher copying was far greater than would be expected in such a situation (contrast, \nfor example, Mr Wong\u2019s and her copying in respect of the Mediation paper: see \n[10] and [ 37] above), the veracity of her explanation may come into doubt. To \nresolve this uncertainty, at the Hearing, Ms Ong\u2019s, Mr Lim\u2019s and Ms Au\u2019s \nlawyers were directed to take instructions and assist me. \n41 Before turning to their clarifications, for completeness, it should be \nnoted that the Ethics paper comprised two questions with three parts each, \nnamely, questions 1(a), 1(b), 1(c), 2(a), 2(b) and 2(c). Candidates were required \nto attempt and pass both questions, to pass the paper as a whole. Each part was \nnot allotted a mark per se, but candidates were advised to complete each part \nwithin a certain amount of time, thus denoting the weight of that question in the \nscheme of the paper. Candidates were advised to take 20 minutes for each part \nof the first question, but 22, 14 and 24 minutes in respect of questions 2(a), 2(b) \nand 2(c) respectively. Counsel for Ms Ong, Mr Devadas Naidu (\u201cMr Naidu\u201d) \ntold me that his client recalled copying Mr Lim\u2019s and Ms Au\u2019s answers in \nVersion No 1: 26 Sep 2022 (12:06 hrs)\nRe Wong Wai Loong Sean[2022] SGHC 237\n23respect of questions 1(c) and 2(a), which constituted slightly more than a third \nof the whole Ethics paper. Counsel for Mr Lim, Ms Shobna Chandran \n(\u201cMs Chandran\u201d), and for Ms Au, Mr Peter Ong (\u201cMr Ong\u201d), confirmed that \ntheir clients did not have a different recollection, and the stakeholders also did \nnot enter an objection to this clarification. \n42 In the circumstances, although such clarification was not provided under \noath, I proceeded on this basis and did not make more of the fact that Ms Ong\u2019s \nscript for the Ethics paper seemed to disclose a greater degree of similarity with \nMr Lim\u2019s and Ms Au\u2019s scripts than one part of each of the two questions. In \nshort, I gave Ms Ong the benefit of the doubt on the seemingly greater degree \nof similarity and did not take it into account in determining SUM 3008. \n43 This is all that needs to be said of the circumstances of the trio\u2019s cheating \nincidents, and their accounts thereof. It is important, however, in looking at the \nsum of these incidents, to note that Ms Ong, on both occasions, was the sole \ntrigger for the wrongful communications, and, also, the only person who \nbenefitted from such communications. This is not to trivialise Mr Lim\u2019s and \nMs Au\u2019s willingness to indulge Ms Ong\u2019s obviously dishonest requests, but, for \nnow, the severity of their conduct is a matter which can be put aside. I will \nreturn to it (at [ 69]) below. In any event, as a result of their misconduct, the \nSILE issued notices under r 12(5) of the 2011 Rules to all three applicants. \nMs Ong and Mr Lim were denied passes in respect of the Mediation paper, and \nall three were denied passes in respect of the Ethics paper. As mentioned at [ 2] \nabove, they were allowed to retake these papers, and, upon doing so during the \n2021 session of the Part B examinations, they passed.\nThe SILE\u2019s decision on the Criminal and Civil Litigation papers\n44 This brings me to an area which gave rise to some factual difficulty.\nVersion No 1: 26 Sep 2022 (12:06 hrs)\nRe Wong Wai Loong Sean[2022] SGHC 237\n2445 Apart from the two papers discussed above, Ms Ong, Mr Lim and \nMs Au were all also denied passes in respect of the Criminal Litigation Practice \n(\u201cCriminal Litigation\u201d) paper. Unlike the Mediation and Ethics papers, \nhowever, there was some lack of clarity as to how the SILE reached its \nconclusion that the trio had also cheated in this paper. This lack of evidential \ncertainty, as I alluded to at [ 4] above, affected my ability to properly assess the \ncharacter issues that this gave rise to.\n46 Ms Ong\u2019s, Mr Lim\u2019s and Ms Au\u2019s scripts to the Criminal Litigation \npaper turned up 50 matching blocks and revealed an overall similarity of around \n70%. When the SILE questioned them about this, they each explained that they \ndid not communicate during the examination and that the similarity could be \nexplained by their use of a common set of stock answers that they had prepared \ntogether. They did not, at any point, change their account, which was maintained \neven before me at the Hearing. As I mentioned at [ 34] above, the SILE accepted \nthat similarities resulting from the use of common notes or prepared answers \nwere not prohibited. The similarities needed to be of such character and extent \nthat they gave rise to the inference that the candidates must have communicated \nor collaborated during the examination to amount to cheating.\n47 By denying Ms Ong, Mr Lim and Ms Au passes in respect of the \nCriminal Litigation paper, the SILE evidently did not accept their explanation \npremised on the use of common stock answers and considered that the inference \nof improper communication could appropriately be drawn. Indeed, in letters \nsent to each of the three applicants on 8 April 2021, inviting them to show cause \nunder r 11 of the 2011 Rules, the SILE stated that it had found that their scripts \ncontained numerous blocks of identical or almost identical text which included \ncommon errors as well as question-specific factual analysis which could not \nhave been prepared beforehand. After consulting the subject coordinator for the \nVersion No 1: 26 Sep 2022 (12:06 hrs)\nRe Wong Wai Loong Sean[2022] SGHC 237\n25Criminal Litigation paper, the SILE determined that the three candidates could \nnot be given the benefit of the doubt, and, as with the Mediation and Ethics \npapers, they were also denied passes in Criminal Litigation.\n48 By itself, there was nothing to suggest that this conclusion was unsound. \nHowever, confusion arose from the fact that Ms Ong, Mr Lim and Ms Au stood \nin a similar position in relation to the Civil Litigation Practice (\u201cCivil \nLitigation\u201d) paper. In respect of this paper, the SILE had identified 71 matching \nblocks, with an overall similarity of about 78%. This was greater than that which \nhad been identified in respect of the Criminal Litigation paper, and, indeed, the \nSILE had also observed that the applicants\u2019 matching blocks of text in the Civil \nLitigation paper were of the type which could not have been prepared \nbeforehand. Yet, after consultation with the subject coordinators for the Civil \nLitigation paper, it concluded that the candidates could be given the benefit of \nthe doubt. The three applicants were therefore not denied passes in this paper.\n49 I was unable to understand this, and the SILE did not put forward any \nmaterial at the Hearing to explain why the papers were treated differently. Once \nagain, the SILE accepted that similarities resulting from the use of common \nnotes alone, without communication or collaboration during the examination, \nwere not wrongful. This presumably accounted for the SILE\u2019s decision in \nrespect of the Civil Litigation paper. However, I was not told of any basis for \nthe SILE to arrive at the opposite conclusion in respect of the Criminal \nLitigation paper. On the contrary, the material before me at the Hearing \nsuggested strongly that they should have both been decided in the same way. \nWithout more information, I could not conclude whether the SILE was being \nlenient in respect of the Civil Litigation paper or harsh in respect of the Criminal \nLitigation paper. \nVersion No 1: 26 Sep 2022 (12:06 hrs)\nRe Wong Wai Loong Sean[2022] SGHC 237\n2650 This was crucial. If I had preferred the former view, the logical import \nwas that Ms Ong, Mr Lim and Ms Au were lying about the nature and extent of \ntheir misconduct. In fact, the conclusion would not merely be that they had been \nless than forthcoming; all three applicants maintained their positions in the \naffidavits they filed for the purposes of SUMs 3008, 3009 and 3010. Therefore, \nto prefer the former view was also to conclude that the trio had each lied under \noath. There was, in my view, no material before me which could justify my \narriving at such a damning conclusion. At the Hearing, Mr Jeyendran initially \ndisagreed with this, and pressed the opposing view. He referred to the fact that \nMs Ong, Mr Lim and Ms Au had each accepted the SILE\u2019s decision. Therefore, \nhe suggested, it did not lie in their mouths now to contend that they did not cheat \nin the Criminal Litigation paper. This did not persuade me. \n51 I was mindful that the applicants did not challenge the SILE\u2019s decision, \nfor example, by commencing judicial review proceedings to obtain a Quashing \nOrder. However, it was one thing for the applicants not to dispute and, in that \nsense, to accept the SILE\u2019s decision. It was another thing entirely for them to \nadmit to misconducting themselves in a manner which would have revealed \ndeep and serious character flaws. Ms Ong, Mr Lim and Ms Au did not, at any \npoint, accept or admit that they had communicated or colluded during either the \nCriminal or Civil Litigation papers. Their acceptance of the SILE\u2019s decision to \ndeny them of passes in respect of the Criminal Litigation paper could not be \nread as a concession that they had in fact communicated or colluded. On the \ncontrary, it was, in my view, a fair position for them to have taken. As I pointed \nout to Mr Jeyendran at the Hearing, it was not unreasonable for applicants \nseeking admission to choose not to initiate judicial review proceedings against \none of the three stakeholders charged with overseeing their admission to the \nprofession. When the point was put in this way, Mr Jeyendran accepted that, \ngiven the absence of material from which I could discern the basis on which the \nVersion No 1: 26 Sep 2022 (12:06 hrs)\nRe Wong Wai Loong Sean[2022] SGHC 237\n27SILE distinguished between the two papers, I should disregard the fact that the \napplicants were found to have cheated in the Criminal Litigation paper. \nMr Kenneth Lim and Mr Chong also agreed that this was the appropriate course \nto take.\n52 To be clear, this did not call into question the legitimacy of the SILE\u2019s \ndecision. These were not judicial review proceedings. The SILE\u2019s decision was \nonly being disregarded for a very specific purpose. As I explained at [ 3] above, \nthe sole question to be determined in cases like these is whether the applicant is \nsuitable to be admitted in terms of her character. Without a clear explanation on \nhow the SILE arrived at its decision in respect of the three applicants\u2019 Criminal \nand Civil Litigation papers, I was simply not in a position to conclude from the \nSILE\u2019s decision alone, that the trio had not only communicated and colluded \nduring the Criminal Litigation paper, but that they had, until the Hearing, \nmaintained a blatant lie about the extent of their wrongdoing.\n53  I should also make clear that I am not criticising the SILE for the lack \nof information. By way of background, at a case management conference held \non 15 July 2022, Assistant Registrar Karen Tan directed the SILE to decide \nwhether they were willing to disclose the Student Disciplinary Committee\u2019s \n(\u201cSDC\u201d) internal report on the decision, assuming one existed. On 29 July 2022, \nthe SILE informed the court that the SDC had indeed prepared a report, but that \nthere were confidentiality concerns. Thus, the SILE declined to adduce the \nreport for my consideration. No particular factual or legal bases for the \nconfidentiality concerns were raised. Counsel for Ms Ong, Mr Lim and Ms Au \ndid not push for its disclosure, and, at the Hearing, Mr Chong suggested that the \nreport was unlikely to contain any information which would have been \nprobative of this specific issue. \nVersion No 1: 26 Sep 2022 (12:06 hrs)\nRe Wong Wai Loong Sean[2022] SGHC 237\n2854 For these reasons, I did not give any weight to the fact that the SILE \ndeprived Ms Ong, Mr Lim and Ms Au of passes for the Criminal Litigation \npaper, in assessing the character issues faced by these candidates. \nCompliance and non-compliance with the SILE\u2019s investigations\n55 After the SILE discovered the similarities between Ms Ong\u2019s, Mr Lim\u2019s \nand Ms Au\u2019s scripts in various subjects, Ms Ong was not immediately \ncooperative with its investigation. She was first interviewed by the SILE on 15 \nFebruary 2021. During this interview, she was asked about the Ethics, Criminal \nLitigation and Civil Litigation papers but she denied communicating with \nMr Lim and Ms Au. At this point, she was not asked about the Mediation paper, \nand she did not volunteer any information. After the interview, Ms Ong was \ndirected to provide written representations within 24 hours. In her \nrepresentations, she set out detailed references to her study notes. These \nreferences were to common stock answers she, Mr Lim and Ms Au used, and \nwere intended to account for the similarities between her answers in the \nCriminal Litigation, Civil Litigation and Ethics papers and those of Mr Lim and \nMs Au. \n56 In these representations, however, Ms Ong said nothing about the fact \nthat she had communicated with Mr Lim during the Mediation paper, or that she \nhad communicated with both Mr Lim and Ms Au during the Ethics paper. On \nMs Ong\u2019s account, she omitted such explanation in respect of the Ethics paper \nbecause she had realised that there was simply no explanation for the similarities \nbetween hers, Mr Lim\u2019s and Ms Au\u2019s answers to the Ethics paper, and, thus, she \nwas \u201cplanning to confess to [the] SILE [at her] second interview\u201d, which was \nscheduled to take place on 17 February 2021. Her affidavit did not provide an \naccount of her intentions in respect of the Mediation paper.\nVersion No 1: 26 Sep 2022 (12:06 hrs)\nRe Wong Wai Loong Sean[2022] SGHC 237\n2957 I did not believe Ms Ong. If she had indeed arrived at the realisation that \nthere was no valid explanation for the similarities observed in respect of hers, \nMr Lim\u2019s and Ms Au\u2019s Ethics papers, there was no good reason for her to \nentirely omit an admission in respect of the Ethics paper. If she preferred to \nadmit to her misconduct more fully in person, she could and should still have \nindicated to the SILE in writing that there was a confession to be made. In any \nevent, irrespective of why Ms Ong omitted to admit her misconduct in the \nEthics paper, the tenor of Ms Ong\u2019s affidavit suggested more that she realised \nthat she had no choice but to admit her mistake since there was no good \nexplanation for the similarities observed in the Ethics paper. On the whole, it \ndid not seem to me to be a case of her reaching the conclusion that the right \nthing to do was to admit her misconduct in full. This construction of her affidavit \nwas supported by the fact that, at the second interview with the SILE, Ms Ong \ndid not admit her misconduct in respect of the Mediation paper of her own \ninitiative. She only did so when she was asked. Indeed, as I observed above, \nMs Ong did not even state in her affidavit that she had intended to admit her \nmisconduct in respect of the Mediation paper at the second interview with the \nSILE. This suggested to me that any candour she displayed at this time was not \nunderpinned by honesty or remorse, but rather reflected a degree of tactical \nrealism. Accordingly, though I was mindful that Ms Ong was, from 17 February \n2021, honest in her dealings with the SILE, I did not give her credit for her \nadmissions. On the contrary, I found that her initial lack of candour was \ndishonest and revealing of a character defect. \n58 This was in stark contrast with the conduct of her peers, Ms Au and \u2013 in \nparticular \u2013 Mr Lim. They were both forthright from the very outset of their \ndealings with the SILE. In fact, when Mr Lim was first interviewed by the SILE, \nhe had not been asked about the similarities between his and Ms Ong\u2019s scripts \nfor the Mediation paper. Yet, he brought it up of his own accord and informed \nVersion No 1: 26 Sep 2022 (12:06 hrs)\nRe Wong Wai Loong Sean[2022] SGHC 237\n30the SILE of what had happened. I regarded this as an encouraging sign of his \ncharacter.\nIncomplete disclosure in their admissions affidavits\n59 The final issue which needs to be addressed, before I turn to my \nreasoning in respect of the periods of Ms Ong\u2019s, Mr Lim\u2019s and Ms Au\u2019s \nundertakings, was the fact that they did not provide full disclosure in their \nadmissions affidavits. Unlike Mr Wong, they did at least disclose the fact that \nthey had been found by the SILE to have breached the rules of the 2020 Part B \nexamination, though they did not elaborate on the circumstances of their \nwrongdoing. The extent of their disclosures was as follows:\nMs Ong\u2019s admissions affidavit: As I had contravened the Rules \nof the Part B Examinations, I was issued a Notice under Rule \n12(5) of the Legal Profession (Admission) Rules 2011 on 22 June \n2021. This was issued by the Singapore Institute of Legal \nEducation. As a consequence, I was deprived of a pass in Part \nB of the Singapore Bar Examinations 2020, in Criminal \nLitigation Practice, Ethics and Professional Responsibility and \nMediation. I was allowed to retake those subjects in the \nSingapore Bar Examinations 2021 and have since passed them. \nI have deeply regretted my actions during the 2020 \nexaminations and have learnt my lesson from this incident. I \nhope to be given a second chance and be allowed to be called to \nthe bar.\nMr Lim\u2019s admissions affidavit: On 22 June 2021, l was given \nnotice under Rule 12(5) of the Legal Profession (Admission) \nRules 2011 by the Board of Directors of the Singapore Institute \nof Legal Education depriving me of a pass in the Criminal \nLitigation, Ethics and Professional Responsibility and Mediation \nAdvocacy papers pursuant to Rule 12(1)(d) of the Legal \nProfession (Admission) Rules 2011, as I was found to have \nbreached the Examination Rules of the Singapore Institute of \nLegal Education. I had admitted my mistake in the first instance \nduring my representations to the Singapore Institute of Legal \nEducation. In my representations to the Dean of the Singapore \nInstitute of Legal Education, I had informed her that I would \nlike to be availed the opportunity to retake my papers and rectify \nmy mistake. I was allowed to retake and have since passed the \nabovementioned papers in Part B of the Singapore Bar \nExaminations 2021. I have taken the past two years to reflect \nVersion No 1: 26 Sep 2022 (12:06 hrs)\nRe Wong Wai Loong Sean[2022] SGHC 237\n31and am extremely remorseful and regretful of my actions. It has \nbeen my lifelong dream to practice law in Singapore, and I am \ngrateful for the opportunity to retake my papers and to have \npassed them. It is my sincere hope to be called to the Bar to \nfulfil this dream.\nMs Au\u2019s admissions affidavit: The Singapore Institute of Legal \nEducation deprived me of a pass in Criminal Litigation Practice \nand Ethics and Professional Responsibility in Part B of the \nSingapore Bar Examinations 2020 after giving me notice under \nr 12(5) of the Legal Profession (Admission) Rules 2011. The \nSingapore Institute of Legal Education allowed me to retake the \nexaminations for the said subjects in 2021 and I have attained \na pass for them. I am truly regrettable and remorseful for \nrunning afoul of the examination regulations, and hope to be \ngiven a second chance to be called to the bar.\n60 As with Mr Wong (see [ 15] above), the representatives of the AG, the \nLaw Society and the SILE all took issue with the fact that the trio had not made \nfull disclosures in their admissions affidavits. The explanations which Ms Ong, \nMr Lim and Ms Au provided for their lack of full and frank disclosure were, \nhowever, in my view, reasonable. They claimed to have believed that they were \nonly required \u2013 in their admissions affidavits \u2013 to make general declarations. \nThey were under the impression that, subsequently, the stakeholders would then \ndirect them to provide any necessary supplementary affidavits to explain those \ngeneral declarations. They relied on the following guidance provided on the \nLaw Society\u2019s website (see [ 15] above):\nWhat happens when I make a declaration under Paragraph \n7 of my affidavit?\nYou will be asked to provide more details in the form of a \nsupplementary affidavit and exhibit any relevant documents (eg. \nCharge sheet, medical report).\nFor example, if you have declared a medical condition, you will \nbe asked to submit a detailed medical report from your doctor \nwhich states that you are fit to be admitted and to practice.\n[emphasis added in italics]\nVersion No 1: 26 Sep 2022 (12:06 hrs)\nRe Wong Wai Loong Sean[2022] SGHC 237\n3261 Further, the three applicants also submitted that they took this view \nbecause, by the time they filed their admissions affidavits, the SILE was already \nfully aware of their misconduct. Thus, the applicants argued, they were not \nexpecting to conceal this fact, nor were they even attempting to do so.\n62 I accepted their explanation. It seemed most improbable to me that they \nwere setting out to conceal their misconduct given that they had: (a) made at \nleast some declaration in their admissions affidavits; and (b) already admitted \nsuch misconduct to the SILE. As I suggested to Mr Jeyendran at the Hearing, I \nviewed these as cases of poorly drafted affidavits rather than cynical ones. In \nmy assessment of the appropriate periods of their respective undertakings, I \ntherefore attributed no weight to their failure to disclose all the facts in their \ninitial admissions affidavits.\nThe appropriate period to be undertaken by the three applicants\n63 Having analysed all the considerations relevant to Ms Ong\u2019s, Mr Lim\u2019s \nand Ms Au\u2019s cases, I now turn to how I weighed these factors in arriving at my \ndecision that they should undertake, respectively, for three years, one year, and \nnine months, not to bring fresh applications to be admitted as advocates and \nsolicitors (see [ 30] above).\n64 I begin with Ms Ong. First, as regards the severity of her misconduct \n(see [ 3] above), I reiterate what I have said at [ 22]\u2013[ 23] above, in relation to \nMr Wong. Again, the seriousness of dishonest conduct, even if it flowed from \na state of panic, cannot be understated. Indeed, Ms Ong chose to consult her \nfellow candidates not once, but twice. Had she realised her mistake after the \nMediation paper and not repeated it, perhaps, it could at least have been \nsuggested that her misconduct was reflective of an instance of abysmally bad \ndecision-making (though this would not have been mitigating, for the reasons I \nVersion No 1: 26 Sep 2022 (12:06 hrs)\nRe Wong Wai Loong Sean[2022] SGHC 237\n33articulated in respect of Mr Wong at [ 22] above). However, the fact that it \nhappened again, during her Ethics paper no less, makes such an optimistic view \nof her character flaws quite untenable. \n65 Next, in respect of the second and third considerations (see [ 3] above), I \nwould simply repeat [ 55]\u2013[ 57] and [ 59]\u2013[ 62] above. That said, I should also add \nthat, though I thought that Ms Ong\u2019s lack of initial candour was revealing of at \nleast some character faults, such faults did not rise to the level of Mr Tay\u2019s faults \nin Re Leon Tay. Ms Ong did, after all, admit the facts by the time of her second \ninterview with the SILE; by contrast, Mr Tay was not completely forthcoming \nuntil the hearing before me, when he accepted that he was not a fit and proper \nperson to be admitted, and when his counsel suggested that having regard to all \nthe circumstances, the undertaking in question should be for a period of five \nyears. It was only at that stage that the fact of cheating was no longer in issue.\n66 Finally, in the affidavit Ms Ong filed in support of SUM 3008, she also \nset out volunteering activities in which she had been engaged since the cheating \nincidents and other activities which she planned to undertake to develop her \ncharacter. Mr Naidu, Ms Ong\u2019s supervising solicitor during the period of her \npractice training, also stated that he would continue to mentor her. \n67 At the Hearing, Mr Naidu suggested that the appropriate undertaking for \nMs Ong should be for a period between two and two and a half years. \nMr Kenneth Lim submitted that it should be for a period of three years. He \nassessed Ms Ong\u2019s character issues as suggestive of an even deeper concern \nthan Mr Wong\u2019s for largely the same reasons set out at [ 64]\u2013[ 65] above. \nMr Jeyendran for the AG submitted that the term should be for a period of four \nyears. \nVersion No 1: 26 Sep 2022 (12:06 hrs)\nRe Wong Wai Loong Sean[2022] SGHC 237\n3468 I agreed with Mr Kenneth Lim. On my assessment, Ms Ong\u2019s conduct \nrevealed more serious character issues than those observed in Mr Wong\u2019s case, \nthough, as I stated above, they did not rise to the level of that displayed by \nMr Tay. Accordingly, I found that an undertaking period of three years was \nsuitable. This should afford Ms Ong time to reflect on and address the character \nissues that have been disclosed.\n69 Next, I turn to Mr Lim\u2019s and Ms Au\u2019s cases. The essence of their \nmisconduct was, to put it simply, their willingness to oblige Ms Ong and accede \nto her obviously improper requests. In my judgment, this was revealing of a \ndifferent, slightly narrower sort of character flaw than that which could be \ngleaned from the misconduct of Mr Wong and Ms Ong. While improper in its \nown right, it was more specifically suggestive of a certain lightness with which \nMr Lim and Ms Au treated the importance of the unwavering integrity and \nhonesty expected of legal professionals, particularly in upholding general and \ninstitutional standards of conduct. \n70 Whilst they did not benefit from their misconduct, it did not seem to \ncross Mr Lim\u2019s and Ms Au\u2019s minds that the notions of integrity and honesty \nextend beyond personal gain, and encompassed a broader respect for systems, \ninstitutions, and, more importantly, the standards of the profession as a whole. \nThis may appear rather abstract, but the importance of this broader view of \nintegrity and honesty should not have been lost on Mr Lim and Ms Au. On the \ncover of each question paper administered during the Part B examinations, \ncandidates were instructed as follows:\nYou are responsible for safeguarding the integrity of your \nanswers and to that end, you must ensure that during the \nExaminations you (i) are not in close proximity with another \nperson or persons such that your answers may be seen; and (ii) \ntake all appropriate measures such that only you may see and \nhave access to your answers.\nVersion No 1: 26 Sep 2022 (12:06 hrs)\nRe Wong Wai Loong Sean[2022] SGHC 237\n3571 At the Hearing, Mr Jeyendran suggested that, although the nature of \nMs Ong\u2019s misconduct was distinct from that of Mr Lim and Ms Au, the \nmisconduct of the latter two was, nevertheless, equally severe. Or, as he put it, \nthere was no difference between Ms Ong\u2019s conduct in asking for answers, and \nthat of Mr Lim and Ms Au in giving the answers. \n72 I rejected this submission. In my view, Mr Lim\u2019s and Ms Au\u2019s \nmisconduct was, plainly, less serious. One who asks for improper help in an \nexamination is more culpable because she is the initiator of the whole course of \nimproper conduct which follows. And, in initiating such course of improper \nconduct, she both seeks to advance her own interest and undermines broader \ninstitutional interests. Those who respond lack the former motivation. Whilst it \nis crucial for lawyers to protect the integrity of legal institutions, disregard for \nthe integrity of an examination cannot be said to be as severe as disregard for \nsuch integrity in furtherance of one\u2019s own interests. There are, in this light, \nclearly additional layers to Ms Ong\u2019s misconduct beyond that of Mr Lim and \nMs Au. Furthermore, she who asks also unfairly puts those asked in an \nunenviable position, particularly when there are, in an examination, time and \nother pressures. \n73 Therefore, in so far as Mr Lim and Ms Au were concerned, I found that \ntheir misconduct did not reveal character issues which were as severe as that \nrevealed by Ms Ong\u2019s misconduct. Furthermore, in determining the appropriate \nperiods of their undertakings, I was mindful of (a) the fact that they were, from \nthe outset, wholly forthcoming with the SILE; and (b) the details they provided \nin their respective affidavits setting out volunteer works which they had taken \nup and had planned. Drawing these factors together, Ms Chandran, for Mr Lim, \nsubmitted at the Hearing that the term for him should not exceed one year. This \nwas also Mr Ong\u2019s position for Ms Au. Mr Kenneth Lim, for the Law Society, \nVersion No 1: 26 Sep 2022 (12:06 hrs)\nRe Wong Wai Loong Sean[2022] SGHC 237\n36suggested two years, while Mr Jeyendran suggested three years. The SILE did \nnot take any position.\n74 At the Hearing, Mr Jeyendran explained that the AG had taken the view \nthat Ms Ong, Mr Lim and Ms Au had communicated and collaborated in respect \nof the Criminal Litigation paper. However, this did not take into account the \nreasons why I did not give weight to the SILE\u2019s decision in respect of the \nCriminal Litigation paper (as stated at [ 44]\u2013[ 54] above). It followed that the \nperiod proposed by Mr Jeyendran could not be accepted. \n75 In these premises, I considered that for Mr Lim, a period of one year was \nappropriate. As regards Ms Au, given that she had only assisted Ms Ong with \none instead of two papers, a shorter period of nine months was appropriate. As \nI explained at [ 27] above, the period for which an applicant is required to \nundertake not to bring a fresh application is reflective of the time which they \nwill, realistically, need to work out their character issues. Realistically, I was \noptimistic that Mr Lim and Ms Au would be able to work through their \ncharacter faults in a shorter period of time. However, I caution that they should \nnot view the relatively shorter period of their respective undertakings with \nlightness. \nConclusion\n76 Mr Wong, Ms Ong, Mr Lim and Ms Au may wish, at some point, to \nreturn with fresh applications to be admitted as advocates and solicitors. Before \nthen, the former two of them will need to learn, above all, that there is far greater \nhonour and dignity in accepting rightful failure than in grasping for undeserved \nsuccess. The latter two must learn not to go to the aid of others, no matter how \nfamiliar, how close, or how sympathetic the cry for help might be, if such aid \ncan only be provided in sacrifice of one\u2019s integrity and principles. The virtues \nVersion No 1: 26 Sep 2022 (12:06 hrs)\nRe Wong Wai Loong Sean[2022] SGHC 237\n37which underlie these precepts should be evident, and, in fact, it should be \npainfully obvious why, in an advocate and solicitor\u2019s relationship with the court, \nwith her opponents, and with her clients, these are some of the most \nfundamentally important principles from which an honourable member of this \nprofession must never stray. \n77 Having so strayed, however, I hope that Mr Wong, Ms Ong, Mr Lim and \nMs Au will put in the work to regain the confidence that has been lost. This will \nrequire time and effort, but if approached with care, thought and intent, it will \nbe fruitful. They should do their best to engage in consistent reflection, but also \nturn to mentors in the profession for guidance. Difficult lessons, especially \nabout oneself, need to be learnt from within, but they do not need to be learnt \nalone. I was heartened to see that senior members of the Bar had come forth as \nmentors to these four applicants. Mr Goh stepped forth in respect of Mr Wong, \nMr Naidu in respect of Ms Ong, Mr Ong in respect of Ms Au, and I note that \nunnamed mentors have also been in contact with Mr Lim. In time, I hope that \nthe applicants \u2013 with guidance and mentorship \u2013 will find ways to resolve the \ncharacter issues this incident has come to reveal. \nSundaresh Menon\nChief Justice\nVersion No 1: 26 Sep 2022 (12:06 hrs)\nRe Wong Wai Loong Sean[2022] SGHC 237\n38Goh Pek San (P S Goh & Co) for the applicant in AAS 100;\nDevadas Naidu (Metropolitan Law Corporation) for the applicant in \nAAS 121;\nShobna Chandran, Ng Jie Zhen Amy and Thaddaeus Aaron Tan \nYong Zhong (Tan Rajah & Cheah) for the applicant in AAS 124;\nPeter Ong Lip Cheng (Peter Ong Law Corporation) for the applicant \nin AAS 125;\nJeyendran s\/o Jeyapal, Lee Hui Min and Lim Toh Han (Attorney-\nGeneral\u2019s Chambers) for the Attorney-General;\nKenneth Lim Tao Chung (Allen & Gledhill LLP), Davis Tan Yong \nChuan (Rajah & Tann Singapore LLP) and Darryl Chew Zijie (Chia \nWong Chambers LLC) for the Law Society of Singapore;\nChong Soon Yong Avery (Avery Chong Law Practice) for the \nSingapore Institute of Legal Education.\nVersion No 1: 26 Sep 2022 (12:06 hrs)"}

Mr Lee had technical experience from working at the Defence Science and Technology Agency. Mr Baker had considerable business experience from around the world. They decided to collaborate to achieve their vision to \u201cdemocratize the property market\u201d. To do this, they set up StreetSine. 7', '8\\u2003In or around July 2012, SPH reached out to Mr Lee to explore a potential investment by SPH into StreetSine through SSTG (which was then known as CoSine Holdings Pte Ltd). 8', 'SPH was interested in acquiring SSTG as it was then looking to expand its digital media business. SPH viewed the acquisition of SSTG as a strategic expansion in its digital media business and an opportunity to improve its existing online property listings business, ST Property. At the time, SSTG was Singapore\u2019s only major real estate analytics company. It managed and operated the Singapore Real Estate Exchange (\u201cSRX\u201d), a digital platform which provided the property market with computer generated pricing and other related services. It obtained real-time information on sales and rental transactions from its partnership with a consortium of property agencies in Singapore (\u201cSRX Consortium\u201d). SPH was hoping to gain access to this information through an acquisition of SSTG. This would allow ST Property to provide high-quality listings to differentiate itself from its competitors. 9', 'Acquiring SSTG would also block ST Property\u2019s competitors from acquiring it, and at the same time hedge against SSTG becoming a competitor in the future. It was also intended that after the acquisition, SPH, Mr Baker and Mr Lee would work together to position SSTG for an Initial Public Offering (\u201cIPO\u201d) by 2017. 10', '9\\u2003The plaintiffs were interested in SPH\u2019s proposed investment because they felt they needed a large company as an ally. They were of the view that the disruptive power of their technology was too big for two small entrepreneurs to handle. They would need an entity like SPH to protect their business from incumbents which would seek to thwart their vision to create an efficient property market in Singapore. 11', '10\\u2003Between December 2013 and August 2014, negotiations were carried out regarding SPH\u2019s acquisition of SSTG. Eventually, it was agreed that SPH\u2019s investment would be carried out through a subsidiary, SPHI, acquiring 60% of the shares in SSTG. On 31 October 2014, the following agreements were executed: 12', '11\\u2003Under the MAs, Mr Baker was appointed Chief Executive Officer (\u201cCEO\u201d) and Mr Lee was appointed Chief Technology Officer (\u201cCTO\u201d) of StreetSine. 13', 'Clause 2 of the MAs set out their term of employment:', '12\\u2003The SHA provided that the plaintiffs would be involved in the management of StreetSine. Clause 1.1 defined the term \u201cManagement\u201d as \u201ceach of the Existing Shareholders in their capacities as Chief Executive Officer (in the case of [Mr Baker]) and Chief Technology Officer (in the case of [Mr Lee]) of [SSTG and its related companies].\u201d 14', 'Clause 5 of the SHA set out the responsibilities and authority of \u201cManagement\u201d.

Specifically, on 6 April 2016, SISV issued a press release stating that \u201ccomputer-generated values [were] not valuations (in accordance with the SISV Valuation Standards and Practice Guidelines) and are therefore not recognised by [SISV]\u201d. 21', 'In response, SSTG lodged a complaint with the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (\u201cCCCS\u201d) on 18 April 2016. 22', 'On 10 November 2016, SSSPL commenced a suit in the High Court against SISV for various causes of action, including the tort of conspiracy and unlawful interference with trade or business (\u201cSISV Litigation\u201d). 23', 'On 16 October 2017, 26 defendants were added to SSSPL\u2019s claim in the SISV Litigation. 24', 'When the SISV Litigation was commenced, Wong Thomas & Leong (\u201cWTL\u201d) were SSSPL\u2019s solicitors.

Around the same time, Mr Rodney McCune (\u201cMr McCune\u201d), a barrister qualified in the UK, was hired as legal consultant to assist in the SISV Litigation. 25', 'When Mr Davinder Singh SC set up his own legal practice (\u201cDSC\u201d) in around February 2019, DSC took over the conduct of the SISV Litigation. 26', '16\\u2003No Qualifying IPO was achieved by 31 December 2017. By 21 January 2018, Mr Baker had decided to relocate to the USA and discussed this with Mr Fong. Discussions concerning Mr Baker\u2019s replacement followed. 27', 'Eventually, Mr Barakat-Brown emerged as a candidate that was acceptable to Mr Baker, Mr Lee and SPHI. At this point, I should note that Mr Barakat-Brown was not new to StreetSine. In 2013, while he was Managing Director & Head of Advisory of Religare Capital, an investment banking firm, he had advised SSTG in relation to the potential acquisition of its shares. 28', 'Later, in July 2017, through his new firm, Candor Advisory Partners (\u201cCAP\u201d), he was engaged by SSTG as an external advisor to advise on its objectives of bringing in a new investor and positioning itself for an IPO in three to five years\u2019 time. CAP was first engaged from 1 August 2017 to end-January 2018 before a second mandate letter was executed in March 2018 to engage them until March 2019. 29', 'When discussions concerning a new CEO were ongoing, Mr Barakat-Brown thought that he would be a good fit because of his expertise and experience with SSTG\u2019s business. He suggested this to Mr Baker. 30', '17\\u2003On 23 May 2018, the engagement of Mr Barakat-Brown as CEO of StreetSine with effect from 1 June 2018 was formalised by resolutions of SSTG and SSSPL\u2019s boards. It was also formalised that Mr Baker would be resigning as CEO of StreetSine and would be adopting the new role of \u201cCo-Founder and Executive Director\u201d with effect from 1 June 2018. 31', 'On 4 June 2018, Mr Barakat-Brown\u2019s Service Agreement (\u201cService Agreement\u201d) was sent to him, signed by Mr Julian Tan (\u201cMr Tan\u201d), a director of SSTG, on behalf of StreetSine. 32', '18\\u2003The months that followed involved a series of disagreements between the plaintiffs and SPHI. One such disagreement related to the Service Agreement. Mr Baker complained to Mr Fong that he had not seen the Service Agreement before it was executed and that he was not aware of what Mr Tan had locked StreetSine into. Mr Fong responded that the Service Agreement was in all material aspects the same as an earlier draft which Mr Baker himself had provided. Mr Fong\u2019s evidence was that he thought that this meant that Mr Baker had accepted its terms and thus it was surprising to him that Mr Baker indicated that he \u201chad not bought into\u201d the Service Agreement. 33', '19\\u2003There was also disagreement about Mr Baker\u2019s role as \u201cCo-Founder and Executive Director\u201d. Mr Baker was of the view that it had been agreed that he would \u201coversee Singapore operations\u201d. 34', 'To the contrary, SPHI took the position that it had only agreed to this appointment for the purposes of effecting a \u201ctransition\u201d so that Mr Baker could oversee the SISV Litigation and regional expansion, but not operational matters. 35', 'This disagreement was brought to the fore when Mr Baker began raising issues with Mr Barakat-Brown\u2019s performance as CEO of StreetSine.', '20\\u2003As mentioned earlier, StreetSine was looking to bring in a new investor to position itself for an IPO. It was therefore engaged in negotiations with REA Group Limited (\u201cREA\u2019), a multinational digital advertising business specialising in property. On 17 August 2018, REA submitted an indicative non-binding proposal to acquire 60% to 100% of SSTG based on a valuation of the company at $85m (the \u201cIndicative Proposal\u201d). 36', 'For Mr Baker and Mr Lee, this was a massive undervaluation. In an e-mail to Mr Fong, Mr Baker described REA\u2019s indicative valuation \u201cbrazen but not surprising\u201d, and that it arose from REA\u2019s \u201cdiscount[ing]\u201d StreetSine as a \u201cfirst generation listing portal\u201d. 37', '21\\u2003Thus, on 22 August 2018, Mr Baker and Mr Lee submitted a formal offer to sell their shareholding to SPH. They provided three options as consideration for their 40% shareholding: 38', 'They based their offer on a valuation analysis report prepared by Mr Barakat\u2013Brown (the \u201c22 August Valuation Report\u201d) which estimated the value of SSTG to be $250m. SPH communicated their rejection of this offer on 24 September 2018 and told Mr Baker and Mr Lee that, having considered the terms of the Indicative Proposal, SPHI wished to \u201ccontinue to engage REA Group and proceed with the next stage in the process, with the aim of concluding a sale of StreetSine to REA as expeditiously as possible\u201d. 39', 'However, REA withdrew the Indicative Proposal on 22 October 2018, because after concluding its due diligence, it found that \u201cmaterial assumptions that formed the basis of [the Indicative Proposal] [had] not been supported\u201d and \u201cany valuation which would support a final binding offer from REA [was] likely to be materially lower than the terms outlined in [the Indicative Proposal]\u201d. 40', '22\\u2003Discussions between the plaintiffs and SPHI regarding the potential bifurcation of StreetSine followed, but no agreement was reached. 41', 'In or around end-October 2018 to November 2018, the SPHI-nominated directors formed the view that it was no longer necessary or in StreetSine\u2019s interests for the plaintiffs to stay in their executive positions. 42', 'On 14 December 2018, Mr Fong informed the plaintiffs that there was no longer a need for them to remain in their executive roles and that their transition to non-executive roles was to be formalised as soon as possible. 43', 'Written resolutions approving the termination of the plaintiffs\u2019 employments as Executive Director and CTO were approved by the SSTG board on 17 December 2018. 44', 'The plaintiffs were paid three months\u2019 salary in lieu of notice in accordance with Clause 9.2 of the MAs, and remained non-executive directors of SSTG. 45', 'Mr Barakat-Brown then took the following steps pursuant to the plaintiffs\u2019 termination: 46', '23\\u2003Between the plaintiffs\u2019 removal from their management roles on 17 December 2018 and the commencement of this suit on 30 August 2019, the following relevant events occurred:', '(a)\\u2003On 23 May 2019, letters were issued to the plaintiffs on behalf of StreetSine demanding the return of certain sums (amounting to $19,500) which it alleged were unauthorised and improperly paid. 47', 'On 21 June 2019, StreetSine commenced a suit against the plaintiffs for the recovery of these payments (the \u201cMC Suit\u201d). 48', 'NLC Law Asia LLC (\u201cNLC\u201d) acted for StreetSine in the MC Suit. 49', '(b)\\u2003SSTG sent a request to its shareholders for additional cash facilities of between $6.58m and $8.58m on 24 July 2019. The same day, Mr Baker replied on behalf of the plaintiffs, indicating that they would only consider the request for capital if certain conditions were met, one of which was reducing Mr Barakat-Brown\u2019s compensation or terminating his employment. 50', '(c)\\u2003On 16 July 2019, the plaintiffs\u2019 solicitors at the time sent a letter to SPH\u2019s solicitors, Allen & Gledhill LLP (\u201cA&G\u201d), communicating an offer to sell their 40% shareholding to SPH for a total consideration of $55m payable immediately, $45m payable upon completion of the SISV Litigation and 1% of gross revenue for SSTG\u2019s digital property, banking and financial services for a 10-year period beginning on 1 September 2021. 51', 'A&G responded on 29 July 2019 with a counter-offer from SPH to purchase the plaintiffs\u2019 shareholding for a total of $10m. 52', '24\\u2003After commencement of these proceedings, further relevant events occurred. In November 2019, SSSPL sought a legal opinion from DSC on the merits of its claim in the SISV Litigation (\u201cthe DSC Note\u201d). 53', 'On 5 December 2019, Mr Fong, Mr Barakat-Brown and lawyers from DSC attended mediation with the parties to the SISV Litigation. A settlement was reached, whereby SISV and StreetSine would jointly issue a press release which addressed SISV\u2019s earlier statements (discussed at [15] above) that formed the basis of the SISV Litigation (\u201cSISV Settlement\u201d). 54', 'In the press release, SISV stated that it recognised that computer-generated valuations could facilitate pricing transparency for the public and enhance the efficiency and productivity of property professionals, and strongly recommended embracing such technology. The press release also contained an acknowledgement from StreetSine that for transactions where a formal valuation is required, the opinion of a licensed appraiser remained important. 55', 'No compensation was paid to SSSPL as part of the SISV Settlement.', '25\\u2003During a board meeting held on 28 April 2020, Mr Barakat-Brown updated the board that by the end of June, due to financial difficulties, StreetSine would not be able to continue to trade. After considering his report, the majority of the StreetSine board decided that StreetSine should be placed under judicial management if shareholder funds were not forthcoming. 56', 'No such funds were made available, and on 11 May 2020, SSTG and SSSPL applied to be placed under judicial management (\u201cJM Applications\u201d). 57', 'The JM Applications were granted on 22 June 2020, and leave was given to continue these proceedings against SSTG on the condition that it was to be treated as a nominal defendant, and no substantive relief was sought against it. 58', '26\\u2003On 9 November 2020, the interim judicial managers (\u201cIJMs\u201d) of SSTG entered into an agreement with 99 Group for the sale of all its shares in SSSPL as well as some of its assets. 59', 'SPH had also made an offer for the purchase of SSTG\u2019s shares in SSSPL, but the IJMs accepted 99 Group\u2019s offer instead. 60', 'The sale of SSSPL to 99 Group was completed on 1 December 2020 for consideration of $8,429,729,56. 61', 'SSTG remains under judicial management.', '27\\u2003In the course of proceedings I had to deal with a number of interlocutory applications. I will mention two points.', '28\\u2003The first concerns party representation. There are two aspects to this. One is that on 17 June 2021, Mr Baker filed notice that he intended to act in person. Mr Lee, however, would remain represented by Providence Law Asia LLP, as they had both been hitherto. This raised the question of whether multiple plaintiffs can proceed in this way, as ordinarily they should be represented by one set of counsel. If plaintiffs engage different counsel, or one is in person while the other is represented by counsel, there is then on one hand the risk of inconsistent positions being taken and on the other hand the possibility of inefficient use of court time where both plaintiffs seek to address the court separately on the same points. It was immediately apparent to me that Mr Baker was a sophisticated and articulate individual who felt that he could best speak for the justice of his case. Sensibly, the defendants did not make much of an objection, and I allowed the plaintiffs to proceed in this way, subject to my control of time and on the basis of their stated intention to take consistent positions. Thereafter, Mr Baker and Mr Lee\u2019s counsel worked together to divide the time appropriately and with minimal duplication.', '29\\u2003The other aspect of party representation concerned the fact that, of the defendants, SPH and SPHI had one set of counsel from Allen & Gledhill LLP while Mr Barakat-Brown had another set from the same law firm. The defendants made applications for further security for costs from Mr Baker who is resident outside the jurisdiction. I dismissed these applications on the principal ground that Mr Baker (and Mr Lee) now had assets within the jurisdiction (namely their indirect share of the sales proceeds for SSSPL held by the judicial managers of SSTG) that were likely to exceed the quantum of any adverse order for costs. While doing so, I observed that: 62', '30\\u2003The second point is that, preparatory to applying for subpoenas to compel attendance at trial, Mr Baker applied for dispensation of affidavits of evidence-in-chief in respect of twelve witnesses, including the chairman, chief executive officer and numerous employees of SPH, the judicial manager of SSTG and even a partner of Allen & Gledhill LLP. 63', 'First, as the application was only filed by Mr Baker, I required Mr Lee\u2019s counsel to confirm that he associated himself with the application and reminded the plaintiffs they could have only one case for both of them, and would be jointly and severally responsible for costs, if ordered. Secondly, as Mr Baker is a litigant in person, albeit one working closely with Mr Lee\u2019s counsel, I explained the consequences of a party calling a witness as its own, namely that leading questions may not be asked except in accordance with s 144 of the Evidence Act 1893 (the \u201cEA\u201d), and that the party is generally bound to accept the truthfulness of that witness, unless the witness is impeached in accordance with s 157 of the EA. These are important restrictions that operate to discourage parties from calling witnesses speculatively, merely in hope that they may give favourable evidence. Without them, trials would be unnecessarily prolonged, a result that would not be in the interests of the expeditious administration of justice. I allowed the application only in respect of two witnesses, namely Ms Young Yim Nee Babsy (\u201cMs Young\u201d), who was a nominee of SPHI on SSTG\u2019s board, and Mr Ng Yat Chung (\u201cMr Ng\u201d), the CEO of SPH.'"}

The parties subsequently agreed that the vessel \u201cAsia Ruby III\u201d would be the vessel nominated to carry the cargo from India to China. 4', '9\\u2003The Contracts each contained a price adjustment clause, which described how the base price of the Iron Ore Fines would be adjusted in the event that the iron content, impurities and physical specifications of the Iron Ore Fines delivered to the plaintiff deviated from the contractual specifications (the \u201cAdjustment Clause\u201d). The plaintiff also had the right under the Contracts to reject the entire cargo or renegotiate the price, if the iron content of the Iron Ore Fines fell below 56%. 5', '10\\u2003The Contracts also each contained an arbitration agreement (collectively, the \u201cArbitration Agreements\u201d), which provided as follows: 6', '11\\u2003Pursuant to the Contracts, the defendant loaded the Iron Ore Fines onto the Tiger Shanxi and the Asia Ruby III by 28 February 2017 and 21 February 2017 respectively. 7', 'The Asia Ruby III arrived at her nominated port of discharge in Shandong, China, on or around 11 March 2017 and discharge was completed on the same day. The Tiger Shanxi arrived at her nominated port of discharge in Tangshan, China, on or around 1 April 2017 and discharge was completed on or around 3 April 2017. 8', '12\\u2003It was not in dispute that the Iron Ore Fines did not meet the specifications stated in the Contracts (the \u201ccargo defects\u201d). In particular, the iron content of the Iron Ore Fines fell below the contractually specified minimum of 56%. The Iron Ore Fines supplied under the Tiger Shanxi Contract also contained an excess of silica content, while the Iron Ore Fines supplied under the Asia Ruby Contract contained an excess of silica and moisture content. 9', '13\\u2003In light of the cargo defects, on 4 April 2017, the parties agreed to an addendum to each of the Contracts (collectively, the \u201cAddenda\u201d), with the aim of revising the final price of the Iron Ore Fines payable by the plaintiff to the defendant. 10', 'The material terms of the Addenda were as follows:', '14\\u2003The Iron Ore Fines were blended with other cargoes purchased by the plaintiff. The Iron Ore Fines supplied under the Asia Ruby Contract were sold to third parties from April 2017 onwards, while the Iron Ore Fines supplied under the Tiger Shanxi Contract were sold to third parties from May 2017 onwards. 13', 'According to the plaintiff, the sales were completed by Glencore International AG (\u201cGlencore\u201d), in its capacity as the plaintiff\u2019s agent. 14', '15\\u2003On 30 May 2017, the plaintiff made a provisional payment of US$417,555.06 to the defendant in respect of the Contracts (the \u201cProvisional Payment\u201d). This amount was lower than the provisional price that the parties had agreed to under the Addenda, as the plaintiff alleged that the defendant had agreed to lower the provisional price of the Iron Ore Fines. 15', '16\\u2003Disputes subsequently arose between the parties as to whether they had each fulfilled their obligations under the Contracts, as amended by the Addenda. On 13 August 2019, the defendant commenced two sets of arbitration proceedings against the plaintiff pursuant to the Arbitration Agreements, in SIAC Arbitration No 279 of 2019 (in respect of the Tiger Shanxi Contract) and SIAC Arbitration No 280 of 2019 (in respect of the Asia Ruby Contract). Both arbitration proceedings were subsequently consolidated by the consent of the parties. 16', '17\\u2003The defendant\u2019s primary claim in the Arbitration was for the original price of the Iron Ore Fines agreed upon by the parties under the Contracts (ie, US$33.50 and US$34.50 per DMT, see [7]\u2013[8] above). The defendant contended that the plaintiff had failed to intimate it of the final price at which the Iron Ore Fines had been sold to third parties, and that the plaintiff should therefore be presumed to have utilised the entirety of the Iron Ore Fines for its own gain. 17', 'In the circumstances, the defendant\u2019s position was that the parties should \u201crevert\u201d to the prices agreed upon by them under the Contracts. 18', '18\\u2003On the other hand, the plaintiff\u2019s case was that pursuant to the Price Adjustment Mechanism in the Addenda, the final price of the Iron Ore Fines should be determined by the actual price that they had been sold to third parties for. Further, the plaintiff highlighted that the Iron Ore Fines had been blended with the plaintiff\u2019s own cargoes, and had been sold in various quantities on different dates and at different prices. 19', 'Accordingly, the plaintiff claimed that the final price of the Iron Ore Fines should be calculated with reference to the quantity and quality of the Iron Ore Fines that had been blended with the plaintiff\u2019s cargo, and the prevailing market price of iron ore fines with similar iron content on the particular day of sale, as indicated by industry publications such as the \u201cMysteel\u201d price index (the \u201cplaintiff\u2019s calculations\u201d). 20', 'The plaintiff\u2019s calculations were set out in the witness statement of the plaintiff\u2019s executive director, Mr Mahesh Kumar Agrawal (\u201cMr Agrawal\u201d), which was filed in the Arbitration. 21', 'Based on the plaintiff\u2019s calculations, the final price of the Iron Ore Fines should have been approximately US$58,678.80 less than the Provisional Payment. 22', 'The plaintiff therefore counterclaimed for this sum. Additionally, the plaintiff raised various counterclaims for damages for the defendant\u2019s alleged breaches of the Contracts. 23', '19\\u2003The hearing of the Arbitration took place from 24 March 2021 to 25 March 2021. 24', 'In the defendant\u2019s opening statement on the first day of the hearing, the defendant\u2019s counsel in the Arbitration appeared to question the precise role of Glencore in the sale of the Iron Ore Fines to third parties. In particular, it was suggested that Glencore had not acted as the plaintiff\u2019s agent and had instead purchased the Iron Ore Fines from the plaintiff, as a buyer. 25', 'In response to this contention, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel in the Arbitration sought to introduce into evidence copies of invoices from Glencore, which had been translated from Mandarin to English (the \u201cGlencore Invoices\u201d). 26', 'The plaintiff\u2019s counsel in the Arbitration claimed that the Glencore Invoices would establish that Glencore had only acted as the plaintiff\u2019s agent in the sale of the Iron Ore Fines, and that the Iron Ore Fines had not been sold to Glencore. 27', '20\\u2003The Arbitrator did not grant leave for the Glencore Invoices to be admitted during the hearing and took the matter under advisement. 28', 'Following the conclusion of the hearing on 25 March 2021, the Arbitrator requested that the parties file post-hearing submissions on several issues, including: (a) the admissibility of the Glencore Invoices; and (b) any agency relationships that might have existed among the parties and Glencore. 29', '21\\u2003In the Award dated 5 August 2021, the Arbitrator found, inter alia, that:', '(a)\\u2003The Glencore Invoices were adduced too late and would therefore not be admitted into evidence. 30', '(b)\\u2003The plaintiff was in breach of the Contracts and the Addenda, by failing to make payment of a 20% advance agreed to by the parties under the Contracts, and the provisional price as agreed to under the Addenda. 31', '(c)\\u2003Given the plaintiff\u2019s failure to make payment for the Iron Ore Fines, title for the Iron Ore Fines had not passed from the defendant to the plaintiff. Accordingly, the plaintiff had acted as the defendant\u2019s agent in the onward sale of the Iron Ore Fines to third parties, and therefore owed the defendant fiduciary duties. 32', '(d)\\u2003The Price Adjustment Mechanism required both parties to consider the actual amounts realised from the sale of the Iron Ore Fines, and to jointly calculate the amounts due to the defendant. As the defendant\u2019s fiduciary, the plaintiff was obliged to account to the defendant. The plaintiff had breached its fiduciary duties to the defendant by unilaterally calculating the final price of the Iron Ore Fines. The plaintiff had failed to keep the defendant informed of, inter alia, who the Iron Ore Fines had been sold to and the payment terms on which they had been sold. While some of this information had been provided by the plaintiff for the purposes of the Arbitration, this information had been adduced \u201ctoo little, too late\u201d. 33', '(e)\\u2003The parties had not agreed upon a final price for the Iron Ore Fines in the Contracts, and the Price Adjustment Mechanism set out in the Addenda was \u201cvague and ambiguous\u201d. This had also been the first time that the parties had done business together. In the circumstances, applying s 8 of the Sale of Goods Act 1979 (c 54) (UK) (the \u201cSOGA\u201d), the plaintiff was obliged to pay the defendant a \u201creasonable price\u201d. 34', '(f)\\u2003The plaintiff\u2019s calculations were not helpful. While the plaintiff\u2019s calculations had been endorsed by its expert witness, Mr Roger Emmott (\u201cMr Emmott\u201d), Mr Emmott was a metallurgist who had no experience in the purchase and sale of iron ore fines. 35', '(g)\\u2003The appropriate final price of the Iron Ore Fines was the original price agreed upon by the parties under the Contracts, with downward revisions made pursuant to the Adjustment Clause to take into account the cargo defects. 36', '(h)\\u2003Given the plaintiff\u2019s breach of the fiduciary duties it owed to the defendant in failing to account to the defendant how the final prices of the Iron Ore Fines were arrived at, the actual amount of proceeds realised from the sale of the Iron Ore Fines was immaterial. It was therefore not necessary to make a formal decision on the nature of the relationship between the plaintiff and Glencore, or on the precise role of Glencore in the sale of the Iron Ore Fines. 37', '(i)\\u2003The plaintiff\u2019s counterclaims were dismissed. 38'"}

For the purposes of this appeal, the following brief facts are relevant. Commencing 7 January 2002, Ms Ten was a candidate for the degree of Masters of Arts (Architecture) by research at the School of Design and Environment of NUS. It was a requirement that Ms Ten complete a thesis in order to graduate from the course. Dr Wong Yunn Chii (\u201cDr Wong\u201d) was Ms Ten\u2019s sole supervisor for her thesis.', '4\\u2003Ms Ten raised a complaint about Dr Wong\u2019s conduct with NUS. She dealt with a number of NUS officers regarding the complaint, including Professor Lily Kong (\u201cProf Kong\u201d) and Professor Ang Siau Gek (\u201cProf Ang\u201d). A Committee of Inquiry (\u201cCOI\u201d) was set up to look into Ms Ten\u2019s complaint. The COI concluded that, amongst other things, Dr Wong had failed to comply fully with his duties as Ms Ten\u2019s supervisor, and recommended that he be censured for this failure. When conveying the findings of the COI to Ms Ten, Prof Kong did not mention this finding of the COI. Communication between Prof Kong and Ms Ten continued, with Ms Ten complaining that the COI\u2019s process was inadequate and lacked transparency. There were further disagreements between Ms Ten and NUS about the requirements that she needed to fulfil to receive her degree. Eventually, on 4 September 2006, NUS terminated her candidature with immediate effect before she obtained her degree.', '5\\u2003Ms Ten brought suit against NUS to award her the degree and claimed damages for breach of contract, misfeasance in public office, intimidation and negligence. Ms Ten was dissatisfied with the way NUS had handled her complaint against Dr Wong. She felt that NUS and its officers were trying to cover up Dr Wong\u2019s misconduct, and had thus retaliated maliciously. In particular, she alleged that Prof Kong and Prof Ang had put obstacles in her way to prevent her from obtaining her degree.', '6\\u2003On 9 July 2018, all of Ms Ten\u2019s claims were dismissed by Woo Bih Li J (as he then was): the Judgement at [301].

The Court of Appeal noted that the delay was substantial, and that Ms Ten had failed to provide good reasons for it. 3', 'The Court of Appeal also considered that Ms Ten\u2019s appeal had little prospect of success.

Maniam JC noted that Ms Ten\u2019s submissions in OSB 3 were by and large premised on her dissatisfaction with the Judgment and the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in OS 25. These were decisions which she could no longer appeal against. 5', 'As such, Maniam JC found that the debt that was the subject of OSB 3 was not disputed on grounds which appeared to be substantive and he was not satisfied that there were other grounds on which the statutory demand ought to be set aside. 6', '10\\u2003Two months after Maniam JC\u2019s decision, on 10 March 2021, Ms Ten filed the OS.

NUS filed an affidavit in support of its application for striking out. Ms Ten did not file an affidavit in reply, although after the time for doing so passed, she asked various times to do so without filing an application. The assistant registrar (the \u201cAR\u201d) granted NUS\u2019s application on 16 December 2021, striking out the OS and ordering costs in NUS\u2019s favour.', '12\\u2003On 27 December 2021, by Registrar\u2019s Appeal 351 of 2022 (the \u201cRA\u201d) Ms Ten appealed against the AR\u2019s decision.

For ease of reference, I will continue to refer to Asia Recruit by its original name at the time of incorporation, unless otherwise specified. From 10 March 2015 to 28 March 2016, Terry was the sole director and shareholder of Asia Recruit. Asia Recruit operated as an employment agency, and it held an Employment Agency Licence (\u201cEA Licence\u201d) issued by the Ministry of Manpower (\u201cMOM\u201d). The EA Licence allowed Asia Recruit to deal with all types of workers and was originally valid for the period of 21 April 2015 to 21 April 2018. The EA Licence was suspended by the MOM on 28 December 2015. As Asia Recruit was licensed as an employment agency, it was able to submit work pass applications on behalf of other employers through a portal on the MOM\u2019s website known as \u201cEmployment Pass Online\u201d (\u201cEPOL\u201d). This required Asia Recruit to first obtain proper authorisation from such employers, in a prescribed form. Between May and July 2015, Asia Recruit submitted 137 work pass applications where AJM was named as the employer, all of which were rejected by the MOM. Over the same period, Asia Recruit also submitted 139 work pass applications purportedly on behalf of a company known as Hangeun Doogeun Korean Restaurant Pte Ltd (\u201cHDKR\u201d), for employment at HDKR. Of these 139 applications, 136 were rejected by the MOM and three were withdrawn.

{"casename":"2022_SGHC_254","fact":"'7\\u2003The appellant is a 55-year-old male Singaporean. He was a director of Megamarine Services Pte Ltd (\u201cMegamarine\u201d), a company in the business of manufacturing and repairing air winches and general trading of equipment. As mentioned earlier, the Prosecution proceeded with 19 charges against the appellant. Fifteen of those were charges of abetment by engaging in a conspiracy with one Rajavikraman s\/o Jayapandian (\u201cRaj\u201d) and another Alvin Lim Wee Lun (\u201cLim\u201d) to corruptly obtain gratification under s 6(a) read with s 29(a) of the PCA (the \u201cConspiracy Charges\u201d). At the time of those offences, Raj was a project director at Rotating Offshore Solutions Pte Ltd (\u201cRotating\u201d), which was in the business of building and designing generators and compressors, while Lim was a yard manager in the Facilities Department at Keppel FELS (\u201cKFELS\u201d) shipyard. The other four proceeded charges were of corruptly giving gratification under s 6(b) of the PCA.', '8\\u2003Sometime in late-2014, the appellant was approached by Raj, who said that he would be able to refer jobs from KFELS to vendors. Raj explained that he knew someone in KFELS called \u201cAlvin\u201d (referring to Lim), who was in a position to recommend to whom the jobs were to be awarded. According to Raj, Lim wanted 15% of the invoice value of the jobs (before GST) in order to award those jobs, and so the invoices submitted by the vendors to KFELS would have to be marked up. Raj and the appellant then decided that they would seek vendors for jobs in KFELS and would ask for their invoices to be marked up by more than 15%. The mark-up was to be shared between Lim, Raj and the appellant.', '9\\u2003According to KFELS\u2019s procurement process, it was the Purchasing Department\u2019s responsibility to source for quotations from contractors. However, during the period when Lim oversaw the Facilities Department, he instructed his staff to source for quotations before raising the Electronic Purchase Requisition (\u201cEPR\u201d). The details of the contractor and the price quoted would be included in the description of the EPR. It was a common practice in KFELS shipyard at that time for end-users such as the Facilities Department to source for quotations instead of the Purchasing Department, and the orders raised were still approved even though the Purchasing Manager knew that this should not have been allowed. This administrative lapse in the procurement process meant that Lim effectively decided which contractors would be invited to quote for jobs at KFELS and subsequently, which of these contractors would be recommended to be awarded with jobs.', '10\\u2003Among the Conspiracy Charges under s 6(a) read with s 29(a) of the PCA:', '(a)\\u2003One charge involved the corrupt obtaining of gratification from one U Keh Choon (\u201cKeh Choon\u201d), the director of Titan Offshore Equipment Pte Ltd (\u201cTitan\u201d), which was wholly owned by him. Titan was in the business of manufacturing and servicing marine equipment, including capstans. Sometime in late-2014, the appellant contacted Keh Choon, asking if he was interested to supply two capstans to KFELS. After Keh Choon indicated his interest and responded with an indicative price, the appellant, on Raj\u2019s advice, responded with a revised marked-up price, which was to be submitted in the quotation to KFELS. Keh Choon agreed that if Titan were to be awarded the job, the difference in these two amounts (the indicative price and the marked-up price) would be paid as commission to the appellant and Raj. Keh Choon was also informed that 15% of that sum would be given to someone in KFELS (Lim). From 2015 to 2017, KFELS purchased two new capstans from Titan and engaged Titan for its servicing and repair services for six existing capstans at the KFELS shipyard. For every job that Titan invoiced KFELS, the appellant would receive a copy of Titan\u2019s marked-up invoice to KFELS, and he would then calculate the amount of mark up and use Megamarine to invoice Titan for the commission (though on four occasions the appellant used another entity, 3W Logistics Services (\u201c3W\u201d) to invoice Titan: see [12(b)] below). In all, Keh Choon made a total of seven commission payments to Megamarine from 2015 to 2017 from Titan\u2019s accounts, amounting to a sum of $196,661.72. Of these payments, one of them, which involved a sum of $107,000 obtained in or around January 2015, was the subject of the amended first charge.', '(b)\\u2003Two charges involved the corrupt obtaining of gratification from one Goh Sheng Li, Stanley (\u201cGoh\u201d), the director of Spectrama Marine & Industrial Supplies Pte Ltd (\u201cSpectrama\u201d), which was in the business of supplying, repairing, servicing and testing industrial lifting equipment. The appellant was previously a long-term customer of Spectrama. Sometime in late-2014, the appellant arranged an introductory meeting for Raj to meet Goh. During that meeting, the appellant and Raj informed Goh about a potential job for KFELS. Goh expressed his interest to take on the job. At a subsequent meeting, the appellant and Raj requested a percentage of the invoiced amounts of the jobs as commission for referring the jobs to Spectrama. It was also made known to Goh that someone in KFELS (Lim) would receive a share of the commissions to ensure that Spectrama was given the business. Goh agreed and he marked up the price in the quotations submitted to KFELS to factor in the commission. From 2015 to 2017, Spectrama performed a total of 49 jobs for the servicing and repair of chain blocks and lever blocks for KFELS. For every job that Spectrama invoiced KFELS, Goh would similarly provide a copy of the marked-up invoice to the appellant, who would then calculate the amount of mark-up and use Megamarine to invoice Spectrama for the commission. In all, Goh made a total of 21 payments to Megamarine from 2015 to 2017 from Spectrama\u2019s accounts, amounting to a sum of $190,917.01. Of these payments, two of them, which involved sums of $21,835.41 and $28,784.36 that were respectively obtained on or around 19 February 2016 and 18 August 2016, were the subject of the amended 16th and 21st charges.', '(c)\\u2003Twelve charges involved the corrupt obtaining of gratification from one Fatkullah Bin Tiap (\u201cFatkullah\u201d), the founder and managing director of Growa (F.E.) Pte Ltd (\u201cGrowa\u201d), which is in the business of distributing hoists and cranes and providing services such as the repair, servicing and inspections of hoists and cranes. Sometime in late-2014, Raj asked the appellant if he had a contact for a contractor that could provide crane inspection services for KFELS. The appellant then contacted Fatkullah and told him about a job opportunity for Growa to provide crane inspection services for KFELS. Fatkullah was informed that he had to mark up Growa\u2019s quoted prices in order to pay commissions to the appellant and Raj in return for referring Growa for the job at KFELS, and that a portion of these commissions would be paid to someone in KFELS (Lim) so as to ensure that Growa was given the business. Fatkullah agreed to this arrangement. Between 10 January 2015 and 25 October 2016, Growa performed a total of 22 crane inspection jobs for KFELS. Again, for every job that Growa invoiced KFELS, a copy of the marked-up invoice would be provided to the appellant, who would then calculate the amount of the mark-up and use Megamarine to invoice Growa for the commission (though on six occasions the appellant used 3W to invoice Growa: see [12(b)] below). In all, Fatkullah made a total of 18 commission payments to Megamarine from 2015 to 2016 from Growa\u2019s accounts, amounting to a sum of $492,274.90. Of these payments, 12 of them, involving sums between $22,778.16 and $46,170.50 obtained between 30 March 2016 and 28 November 2016, were the subject of the amended 32nd, 33rd, 35th, 36th, 37th, 38th, 39th, 40th, 41st, 42nd, 43rd and 44th charges.', '11\\u2003After receiving each commission payment from Titan, Spectrama and Growa, the appellant would compute Lim\u2019s, Raj\u2019s and his own share of the commissions. For each commission payment, the appellant would first deduct Lim\u2019s share and another portion for Megamarine\u2019s corporate tax payment, before splitting the remaining amount between himself and Raj evenly. The total amount paid by Keh Choon, Goh and Fatkullah as corrupt gratification (in respect of all the abetment by conspiracy charges, ie, both the Conspiracy Charges and the non-proceeded charges that were taken into consideration for sentencing) was $879,853.63, of which Lim received $293,822.39, Raj received $191,115.89 and the appellant received $191,115.89. The balance sum was paid by Megamarine to the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore as corporate tax.', '12\\u2003As for the charges involving the corrupt giving of gratification under s 6(b) of the PCA (the \u201cNon-Conspiracy Charges\u201d):', '(a)\\u2003One charge involved the appellant corruptly giving $3,000 to Raj for furthering the interests of Megamarine with Rotating. Sometime in March 2014, Raj informed the appellant that the purchasing manager of Rotating would request a quotation for the supply of hardware. Raj informed the appellant that, if Megamarine clinched the deal, the appellant would have to give Raj some commission for referring and recommending the works to Megamarine. The appellant agreed; Megamarine was awarded the job and the appellant paid Raj $3,000. This was the subject of the amended 47th charge.', '(b)\\u2003Three charges involved the appellant corruptly giving sums of $2,997.12, $2,308.32 and $2,564.48 to one Ong Tun Chai (\u201cOng\u201d), the manager of 3W Logistics Services (\u201c3W\u201d), for preparing fictitious invoices on 3W\u2019s letterhead. 3W, a sole proprietorship registered under the name of Ong\u2019s mother, was in the business of transporting cleaning chemicals and laundry for hospitals, prisons and hotels. Sometime in late-2016, the appellant asked Ong to help prepare 3W invoices and delivery orders, which were used to invoice Titan and Growa for the commission that they had agreed to pay for obtaining contracts with KFELS on those occasions when the appellant did not use Megamarine directly to invoice Titan and Growa. In return, the appellant promised to pay Ong 8% of the invoiced amount. Ong agreed and prepared ten such invoices and their corresponding delivery orders. However, the descriptions on these invoices were fictitious, as none of the jobs stated therein were carried out. For these invoices and delivery orders, the appellant paid Ong a total sum of $15,092.80 over ten occasions in 2016. Three of those payments respectively were the subject of the 51st, 52nd and 53rd charges.'"}

During this period, the first and second defendants allegedly procured and\/or provided responses to the finance team\u2019s queries by making available, among other things, information and documents that had been prepared, presented, reported, endorsed or provided by them. 22', '9\\u2003The plaintiff claims that the first and second defendants made various representations (the \u201cAlleged Misrepresentations\u201d) between early-2016 and July 2017 about the value and business of Blackgold Australia, orally and by the provision of information and documents, to induce the plaintiff to acquire Blackgold Australia. 23', '10\\u2003In addition, the plaintiff alleges that it relied on the Financial Reports, in deciding to proceed with the acquisition of Blackgold Australia (the \u201cAcquisition\u201d). 24', 'The plaintiff asserts that the Partnership was engaged in connection with the proposed Acquisition, and the Partnership was aware that the shareholders of Blackgold Australia intended to dispose of their interest in Blackgold Australia to potential acquirers, including the plaintiff. In particular, the Partnership was aware that the plaintiff was in discussions with Blackgold Australia in relation to the Acquisition. 25', '11\\u2003On 28 October 2016, the plaintiff and Blackgold Australia entered into a scheme implementation deed (the \u201cScheme Implementation Deed\u201d), which provided that the Acquisition was to take place through a scheme of arrangement (the \u201cscheme\u201d), in accordance with the Australia Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). 26', 'The Federal Court of Australia granted leave on 24 May 2017 for Blackgold Australia to convene a scheme meeting, for the shareholders of Blackgold Australia to consider approving the scheme. 27', '12\\u2003According to the second defendant, in the course of negotiations leading up to the scheme meeting, he, as a majority shareholder in Blackgold Australia, 28', 'requested an increase in the cash consideration for the scheme. 29', 'The second defendant claims that as a result, Khua proposed that the parties enter into an agreement whereby, in exchange for the second defendant supporting the scheme and not seeking an increase in cash consideration for the scheme, Khua would warrant on the plaintiff\u2019s behalf that Khua had conducted his own due diligence and that he had fully understood the underlying operations and financial and legal positions of the Blackgold Group, including any unfavourable information, and had nonetheless decided to proceed with the Acquisition. 30', 'Shortly before the scheme meeting, the parties signed a letter of undertaking (the \u201cLOU\u201d) drafted in Chinese dated 25 June 2017, setting out those terms. 31', 'There was an undertaking in the LOU not to hold the second defendant liable: 32', '13\\u2003 Khua, however, disputes the second defendant\u2019s version of the event.

The special audit was carried out by a special auditor, Ernst & Young Advisory Pte Ltd (\u201cEY\u201d), appointed by the plaintiff\u2019s audit committee.

It is in the business of constructing, amongst other things, water, gas and sewage pipelines. Tiong Seng Civil Engineering Pte Ltd (\u201cTSCE\u201d), the defendant, was also incorporated in Singapore, and its business is the provision of infrastructure engineering design and consultancy services, as well as the construction of civil engineering projects. 1', 'TSCE belonged to a group of companies which included Tiong Seng Contractors Pte Ltd (\u201cTSC\u201d).', '3\\u2003In or around June 2016, TSC was engaged by the Public Utilities Board (the \u201cPUB\u201d) to construct a potable water pipeline (the \u201cProject\u201d). 2', 'TSC subcontracted the Project wholly to TSCE. Around May 2017, TSCE entered into a subcontract with ICOP for the performance of microtunnelling works which constitute part of the Project. This was done through the execution of a letter of award as amended by a supplemental letter (the \u201cLOA\u201d), both of which were dated 15 April 2017. 3', 'The terms of their subcontract were captured in several documents set out in cl 1.1 of the LOA 4', 'and, collectively, I will refer to them as the \u201cSubcontract\u201d. In the course of this judgment, I will reproduce the relevant terms reflected in the Subcontract, as necessary.', '4\\u2003The Project, which was titled \u201cProposed 1600mm diameter pipeline from AYE\/Henderson Road to River Valley Road\u201d, was part of a larger project for the construction of potable water pipelines from Jalan Kampung Chantek to Marina South and River Valley Road. As far as the Project was concerned, ICOP was engaged to install: \u201c124m of DN1200mm Reinforced Concrete Composite Pipe with built in Mild Steel Collar\u201d and \u201c2229m of DN1600mm\u201d of the same type of pipe. The installation method was microtunnelling, and this was to be carried out in four drives: the first was for the installation of the shorter DN1200mm pipeline (the \u201cDN1200mm Pipeline\u201d), and the other three drives were to install the longer DN1600mm pipeline (the \u201cDN1600mm Pipeline\u201d). 5', 'I should also add that \u201cDN\u201d (Diameter Nominal) refers to the internal diameter of the pipe.', '5\\u2003Briefly, microtunnelling is a method of installing pipelines which entails \u201cthrusting pipes through the ground as controlled excavation is undertaken at the cutter-face of the microtunnel boring machine (the \u201cMTBM\u201d)\u201d. An illustration and description of a typical microtunnelling setup is assistive: 6', '', '6\\u2003ICOP\u2019s further description of the process, as given by their main factual witness, Cheng Ching Keong (\u201cDato Cheng\u201d), is as follows:', '7\\u2003To this, I should call to attention three other points regarding the process of microtunnelling which are relevant in this dispute. First, pressure is transferred from the jacking frame through each pipe section. This being the case, it is clearly necessary for something to ensure the smooth transfer of pressure between each section. Ordinarily, timber pressure transfer rings (also known as \u201cchipboard\u201d) are used. However, ICOP also has superior hydraulic joints which enable pressure to be transferred more effectively, and, therefore, pipelines can be installed with a tighter curvature. 7', 'Second, when exiting the launching shaft, the MTBM needs to break through a wall. This is called the \u201cheadwall\u201d, and at its centre is a \u201csoft eye\u201d, a weak section of concrete and a watertight seal which allows the MTBM to be launched without water or other material flooding into the shaft. This function requires the seal to be able to sustain a certain amount of pressure, depending on various factors. 8', 'Lastly, upon reaching the receiving shaft, the MTBM needs to be lifted out as a whole by crane. 9', 'Therefore, the whole length of the shaft needs to be free from protrusions 10', 'that would block the path of the MTBM as it is being lifted out. Should there be obstructions, the MTBM would need to be dismantled prior to being removed, and this would result in additional costs. 11', '8\\u2003This general description of the Project and of how microtunnelling works are carried out is sufficient, at this point, to understand the nature of the parties\u2019 dispute. As and when further details are necessary to understand the specific issues before me, I shall then set them out.', '9\\u2003I will not dedicate a section in this judgment to the general context and chronology of the parties\u2019 contractual relationship. It suffices to note that in the middle of 2017, ICOP commenced the first drive to install the DN1200mm Pipeline (\u201cDrive 1\u201d); then in 2018, it carried out the second drive to install a section of the DN1600mm Pipeline (\u201cDrive 2\u201d). During Drive 2, the parties were already facing tensions and disagreements. So much so that after Drive 2 in March 2019, and before the commencement of the third drive, ICOP considered itself justified in terminating the Subcontract. Interspersed between these three key events were \u2013 obviously \u2013 many important sub-events, activities and communications. These, however, are better dealt with together with the merits of the various claims and counterclaims brought by ICOP and TSCE respectively. This is because, for the most part, the issues before me are relatively discrete.', '10\\u2003On this note, I turn to those issues.'"}

His wife, Ms Ng Sheau Lian (\u201cMs Ng\u201d), is also a relevant party due to her involvement in the various negotiations. The defendant, SCP Holdings Pte Ltd, is a company incorporated in Singapore. The defendant is the holding company of Biomax Holdings Pte Ltd (\u201cBiomax\u201d). Biomax is involved in the organic waste treatment business. Dr Puah Chum Mok (\u201cDr Puah\u201d) and Dr Sim Eng Tong are directors of the defendant at all material times.', '4\\u2003Sometime in 2014, Dr Puah contacted Ms Ng about the organic waste treatment technology that Biomax was developing. The defendant was at the time a technology start-up which was looking for investors to expand its business. As such, Dr Puah had hoped to convince Ms Ng to invest in the defendant.', '5\\u2003Dr Puah subsequently met with the plaintiff and Ms Ng. Both the plaintiff and Ms Ng were keen to invest in the technology. While the defendant alleged that the plaintiff had made his investment without Ms Ng\u2019s knowledge, nothing in the present case turned on this. What is material was that the plaintiff entered into a first Convertible Loan Agreement dated 31 May 2014 with the defendant (\u201cthe First Agreement\u201d). By way of the First Agreement, the plaintiff agreed to lend the defendant a principal amount of $400,000 (\u201cthe Loan\u201d). Clause 3.1 of the First Agreement provides that the interest rate of the Loan shall be 10% per annum.', '6\\u2003Clause 3.2 of the First Agreement (\u201cClause 3.2\u201d) provided for how the Loan will be repaid.

In this respect, Clause 4 relates to the defendant\u2019s right of prepayment, whereas Clause 7 relates to events of default. There was nothing in the case that turned on Clauses 4 and 7.', '7\\u2003While this was not argued before the AR, I directed the parties to address me on Clause 13.1 during the hearing. Clause 13.1 provides as follows: 3', '8\\u2003Sometime after the First Agreement was concluded, the plaintiff contacted Dr Puah again to make additional investments in the defendant. This resulted in the plaintiff and the defendant entering into a second Convertible Loan Agreement dated 22 December 2015 (\u201cthe Second Agreement\u201d), whereby the plaintiff agreed to lend the defendant a principal amount of $75,000.', '9\\u2003Clause 3.1 of the Second Agreement (\u201cClause 3.1\u201d) replicated Clause 3.2 of the First Agreement, save for the tenure of the agreement and the applicable interest rate.

According to the defendant, the plaintiff had informed Dr Puah around June or July 2016 that he and Ms Ng would like to exercise the option of receiving shares instead of having their capital returned with interest. 5', 'In other words, the plaintiff had elected to exercise \u201cOption 2\u201d under both Clause 3.2 of the First Agreement and Clause 3.1 of the Second Agreement. The defendant alleged that this verbal discussion had taken place during one of the regular meetings between the plaintiff and Dr Puah at or near the defendant\u2019s office. 6', '12\\u2003Consequent to this supposed election to receive shares, the defendant alleged that Dr Puah started to interact more closely with the plaintiff. For example, the defendant stated that Dr Puah started a WhatsApp chat with the plaintiff to provide him with more information about the operations and business of the defendant and its subsidiaries. 7', 'However, it was undisputed that the defendant never issued any of Biomax\u2019s shares to the plaintiff. Also, in or around mid-2019, the defendant alleged that Dr Puah shared with the plaintiff the defendant\u2019s plan to be listed in an initial public offering (\u201cIPO\u201d) sometime in 2024. 8', 'Following this exchange, the defendant stated that the plaintiff and Ms Ng agreed to keep to their decision to receive shares, provided that the listing in an IPO happened by 2024. 9', 'According to the defendant, there were further meetings between the plaintiff and Dr Puah in 2021, during which the plaintiff was briefed on the defendant\u2019s new business model adopted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 10', 'There was also allegedly a meeting on 12 March 2021 between the plaintiff, Ms Ng and Dr Puah, where Ms Ng threatened Dr Puah that she would publicise the defendant\u2019s financial difficulties and Dr Puah\u2019s name all over social media if she was not repaid the principal sum and interest. 11', '13\\u2003In contrast, the plaintiff\u2019s version of events was quite different.

No doubt there were some \ninconsistencies in their narration of certain details, but I found that these were \ninconsequential as they related to minor or peripheral aspects. \n59 The accused did not dispute the sequence in which the respective victims \nwent to meet him at the top of the slide at the playground. The victims also gave \nconsistent evidence in this regard. [V3] was the first to see the accused, but \nwhen asked by the accused whether he would choose to suck the accused\u2019s penis \nor to walk away, he could not decide which course to take. The accused \nthreatened that \u201ctables and chairs would fly\u201d the next time he saw the victims at \nthe coffeeshop if the matter was not settled. As [V3] remained undecided, the \naccused told him to call [V2] to see him (at [ 16]\u2013[ 17] above). \n60 [V2] was similarly given two \u201coptions\u201d of settling the problem, to either \nfollow the accused\u2019s \u201cway\u201d or to walk away. If he chose the latter, the accused \nwould give him \u201cproblems \u2026 in public\u201d. [V2] recalled that the accused had \nuttered the \u201ctakde kau hisap \u2026\u201d phrase to him. [V2] was told to suck the \naccused\u2019s penis and although he felt disgusted, he did so for two to three \nseconds. He gave clear evidence that the accused\u2019s penis penetrated his mouth \n(at [18]\u2013[ 20] above).\n61 [V1] was next to be summoned to see the accused, and he was told by \nthe accused in an angry tone that if he wanted to \u201csettle the problem\u201d, he would \nhave to suck the accused\u2019s penis. [V1] proceeded to suck the accused\u2019s penis. \nHe covered the accused\u2019s penis with his mouth for a few seconds until the \naccused told him to stop (at [ 21]\u2013[ 22] above).\nVersion No 1: 19 Oct 2022 (11:54 hrs)\nPP v Mustapah bin Abdullah[2022] SGHC 262\n2662 Finally, when [V3] was asked to see the accused the second time, the \naccused again used the \u201ctakde kau hisap \u2026\u201d phrase, asking him whether he \nwanted to \u201csettle\u201d the problem. [V3] agreed to do so and he was also clear in \nhis testimony that the accused\u2019s penis penetrated his mouth (at [ 24]\u2013[ 25] \nabove).\n63 In terms of external consistency, the evidence of the victims that the \naccused had penetrated their mouths with his penis bore important common \nthreads. There were no material gaps or discrepancies. Their evidence was \nconsistent when measured against the accused\u2019s statements. He acknowledged \nusing the \u201ctakde kau hisap \u2026\u201d phrase, unzipping his pants and exposing his \npenis to the victims.142 He agreed that by asking them whether they wanted to \n\u201csettle\u201d the problem, he meant that the victims were to suck his penis,143 \nalthough he claimed that he did not expect that they would take him seriously \nand that they had the option to walk away.144\n64 The accused\u2019s claim that he did not really expect the victims to take his \nwords literally and to proceed to suck his penis was entirely disingenuous. If he \nwas merely intent on baiting and chastising them, there was no need for him to \nhave blatantly unzipped his pants to expose his penis to them upon seeing them \none-on-one at the top of the slide. There was even less of a need for him to call \non them repeatedly to suck his penis. Having done so, any reasonable person \nwould only assume, and indeed would have expected, that under such \ncircumstances the accused had been completely serious about his stated intent. \nWhile the accused claimed that the \u201ctakde kau hisap \u2026\u201d phrase was a \u201cslang\u201d \n142 AB at p 47 (Exhibit P8-2) and p 51 (Exhibit P9-2). \n143 Transcript, 27 Apr 2022, p 38 line 18 to p 39 line 9. \n144 AB at p 97 (Exhibit P6-4, Dr Yeo\u2019s report at para 16).\nVersion No 1: 19 Oct 2022 (11:54 hrs)\nPP v Mustapah bin Abdullah[2022] SGHC 262\n27phrase that he used to \u201cmake [the victims] go away\u201d,145 he had repeated this to \neach of the victims.146 This showed the accused\u2019s voluble insistence that the act \nof sucking his penis was the only way that the disagreement between him and \nthe victims could be \u201csettled\u201d. \n65 I rejected the accused\u2019s claim in his oral testimony that he had pushed \nthe victims away before their mouths could make contact with his penis. This \nwas an obvious afterthought as it was entirely inconsistent with all the accounts \nhe had given prior to trial. I shall examine this aspect in greater detail below at \n[97]\u2013[ 107] where I deal with the accused\u2019s credibility as a whole.\nThe victims had not colluded to falsely implicate the accused\n66 The accused suggested that the victims, in particular [V1], had conspired \nto backstab147 him and had somehow influenced the other Prosecution witnesses \nto align themselves with the victims\u2019 side of the story. The accused\u2019s suggestion \nwas premised on pure speculation and was not supported by any evidence. The \nsettled law is that the accused bears the burden of adducing sufficient evidence \nof an alleged motive to falsely implicate him, whereupon the burden to show \nthat no such motive exists shifts to the Prosecution: Goh Han Heng v Public \nProsecutor [2003] 4 SLR(R) 374 at [33]; Public Prosecutor v GCK and another \nmatter [2020] 1 SLR 486 at [102]. I agreed with the Prosecution that the accused \nhad not provided any cogent evidence of any possible motive on the victims\u2019 \npart.\n145 Transcript, 27 Apr 2022, p 72 lines 21\u201327. \n146 Transcript, 12 Apr 2022, p 61 lines 13\u201318; 19 Apr 2022, p 18 lines 24 \u2013 26; 21 Apr \n2022, p 69 lines 11\u201314.\n147 Accused\u2019s submissions at p 12 (5-6).\nVersion No 1: 19 Oct 2022 (11:54 hrs)\nPP v Mustapah bin Abdullah[2022] SGHC 262\n2867 The opportunity for the victims to discuss their evidence and collude \nwas no doubt possibly present, but I found no grounds to suspect that there was \nany collusion. The victims had no reason to fabricate and falsely implicate the \naccused. They had clearly looked up to him, regarded him as a \u201cbig brother\u201d148 \nand respected his advice. The victims bore no animosity towards the accused, \nand had simply sought to avoid him after hearing the rumours about him and \n[M2].149 Instead, it was the accused who was upset and indignant that they had \npurportedly spread such rumours and were avoiding him, and he had then sought \nthem out to \u201csettle\u201d the issue with them (at [ 6] and [ 14] above).\n68 The manner in which the incident came to light was also noteworthy. It \nwas entirely fortuitous that the very next day after the incident, on 18 October \n2018, Mr [AB] astutely observed that [V1] was quieter and less cheerful \ncompared to his usual self.150 Pertinently, [V1], like [V2] and [V3], did not \ninitiate any complaint. He did not volunteer any information until Mr [AB] \napproached him and enquired what had happened. Mr [CD] also similarly noted \n[V1]\u2019s anxious and fearful demeanour when he counselled him on 22 October \n2018.151 It was only then that details of the acts of fellatio emerged. Mr [AB] \nand Mr [CD]\u2019s careful enquiries and sensitive handling of the issue were \ninstrumental in ensuring that the sexual acts were ultimately disclosed. In the \ncircumstances, the fact that the victims gave mutually corroborative accounts to \nthe police and in their court testimonies was more consistent with the truth rather \n148 Transcript, 26 Apr 2022, p 10 lines 29\u201330.\n149 AB at p 1 ([V1]\u2019s statement at para 5), p 8 ([V3]\u2019s statement at para 4); Transcript, 12 \nApr 2022, p 85 lines 15\u201323.\n150 Transcript, 11 Apr 2022, p 86 lines 9\u201314.\n151 Transcript, 11 Apr 2022, p 105 lines 28\u201332. \nVersion No 1: 19 Oct 2022 (11:54 hrs)\nPP v Mustapah bin Abdullah[2022] SGHC 262\n29than any alleged attempt to collude and fabricate evidence to malign the \naccused.\n69 It was also difficult to see why the victims would have been willing to \nadmit to having fellated the accused and to undergo the rigours of the full police \ninvestigation and trial process unless their allegations were true. From the \nvictims\u2019 accounts, they had felt compelled to \u201csettle\u201d the matter with the \naccused. [V2] and [V3] had apparently not intended to surface the matter but \ninstead intended to keep it to themselves.152 [V1]\u2019s parents also appeared \nreluctant for him to get involved by making any police report and did not engage \nthe school on the issue.153 If the incident did not actually occur, it would have \nbeen much more logical and natural for the victims to have simply denied that \nany such potentially shameful and embarrassing acts had taken place. Thus, the \nfact that the victims affirmed that they had fellated the accused was far more \nconsistent with them having spoken truthfully about the incident.\nThe accused\u2019s statements\n70 In his three statements, the accused stated that he had told the victims \nthat if they wanted to \u201csettle\u201d their issues with him, they would have to suck his \npenis. He admitted that each of the victims put their mouths onto his penis after \nhe unzipped his pants.154 As such, his statements were materially self-\nincriminating in respect of the issue of whether he had penetrated the victims\u2019 \nmouths with his penis. \n152 Transcript, 21 Apr 2022, p 50 lines 10\u201313; 26 Apr 2022, p 60 lines 2\u20133. \n153 Transcript, 11 Apr 2022, p 108 lines 2\u20136. \n154 AB at p 47 (Exhibit P8-2). \nVersion No 1: 19 Oct 2022 (11:54 hrs)\nPP v Mustapah bin Abdullah[2022] SGHC 262\n3071 It was evident from the statements that the accused had tried to \ndownplay the nature and severity of the sexual acts by suggesting that the \nvictims did not actually suck his penis for any extended duration.155 In particular, \nthe accused claimed that the victims only \u201ccovered\u201d156 his penis briefly with \ntheir mouths. In my assessment, this was no more than a matter of semantics. \nThe accused\u2019s statements were consistent with the victims\u2019 evidence, and the \ntotality of the evidence had to be properly evaluated and understood. In that \nlight, the acts of penetration had taken place once the accused\u2019s penis was in the \nvictims\u2019 mouths.\n72 To be clear, it is not a defence to criminal liability under s 376(1)(a) of \nthe Penal Code to contend that penetration was only for a brief duration lasting \na few seconds or that the offender\u2019s penis was not erect, as long as there is \nsufficient evidence to show that there was in fact penetration of the victim\u2019s \nmouth with the offender\u2019s penis. It was also not a defence for the accused in the \npresent case to maintain that the victims did not actually engage in any \n\u201csucking\u201d of his penis, but had merely \u201ccovered\u201d his penis with their mouths. \nThe ingredients of the offence do not require proof that they had sucked his \npenis. In any event, the victims\u2019 evidence was that they had done so, albeit only \nbriefly. I shall examine more fully below at [ 80]\u2013[ 83] the question of whether \nthe accused had penetrated the victims\u2019 mouths with his penis for sexual \ngratification.\n73 The accused argued that the statements ought to be disregarded as IO \nRegina had recorded his statements despite knowing that he was in an unstable \ncondition (see [ 32] and [ 39] above). This argument was plainly unmeritorious. \n155 AB at p 47 (Exhibit P8-2) and p 97 (Dr Yeo\u2019s report at para 16). \n156 AB at p 52 (Exhibit P9-3). \nVersion No 1: 19 Oct 2022 (11:54 hrs)\nPP v Mustapah bin Abdullah[2022] SGHC 262\n31IO Regina and Ms Maria both testified that the accused was calm and coherent \nwhen his statements were recorded,157 and he had not raised any complaints \nbefore or during the statement-taking process. \n74 The accused claimed to have been under tremendous stress due to \nongoing unlicensed moneylender activities in his neighbourhood (see [ 41] \nabove). However, IO Regina and Ms Maria were not informed of any of his \nalleged concerns over unlicensed moneylenders causing harassment to his flat, \nlet alone of his purported concern that the moneylenders might endanger his \nelderly mother\u2019s safety.158 In any event, his alleged fears about illegal \nmoneylending activities appeared to be groundless. His last and only police \nreport concerning illegal moneylending activities was made in November 2017, \nnearly an entire year before the incident.159 No further harassing telephone calls \nwere received since late 2017 after he changed his home telephone number in \nDecember 2017 or January 2018. On his own evidence, he only continued to \nmonitor such activities for the next six months (ie, until July 2018).160 This \nwould suggest that by October 2018, there were no further harassing telephone \ncalls causing him concern.\n75 Apart from the accused\u2019s bare allegations of feeling stressed from the \nalleged harassment by unlicensed moneylenders, there was no other objective \nevidence adduced of such activities persisting in October 2018. He claimed that \nwhile there were no longer harassing phone calls, his neighbours and his elderly \nmother continued to be threatened by illegal loan sharks who were loitering \n157 Transcript, 11 Apr 2022 p 22, line 28; Transcript, 11 Apr 2022 p 70, lines 15\u201317.\n158 Transcript, 11 Apr 2022, p 48 lines 28\u201331; 11 Apr 2022, p 74 lines 14\u201319. \n159 Exhibit P15.\n160 Transcript, 28 Apr 2022, p 29 lines 18\u201324. \nVersion No 1: 19 Oct 2022 (11:54 hrs)\nPP v Mustapah bin Abdullah[2022] SGHC 262\n32around his area.161 However, none of these individuals was called to testify to \ncorroborate his claims.\n76 I found that the accused\u2019s claims that he was harassed by unlicensed \nmoneylenders were hastily cobbled together and were not credible. These \nclaims were little more than a desperate attempt to support his belated claim that \nhe had been in an unstable frame of mind when his statements were recorded. \nThe contents of the statements were coherent and included details which only \nthe accused himself could have given. The statements did not appear to have \nbeen given by him when he was not in a proper condition to do so. \n77 I saw no basis to impugn the reliability and accuracy of the accused\u2019s \nstatements which were corroborative of the victims\u2019 accounts. I therefore \naccorded full weight to them in evaluating the evidence.\nThe accused\u2019s account to Dr Yeo\n78  In his interviews with Dr Yeo, the accused had also partially \nincriminated himself, at least to the extent of acknowledging that his penis had \nmade contact with the victims\u2019 mouths. He told Dr Yeo that he had stopped the \nvictims \u201cwithin seconds\u201d of them putting his penis in their mouths.162 This still \namounted to a confession that his penis had penetrated their mouths. \n79 In his submissions, the accused alleged that Dr Yeo had lied in court and \nhad been influenced to take the side of the victims (see [ 40] above). He claimed \nthat Dr Yeo had been misled by IO Regina\u2019s summary of facts. He further \nsuggested that Dr Yeo had not only misunderstood his explanation of the \u201ctakde \n161 Transcript, 28 Apr 2022, p 29 lines 5\u201310. \n162 AB at p 97 (Exhibit P6-4, Dr Yeo\u2019s report at para 16). \nVersion No 1: 19 Oct 2022 (11:54 hrs)\nPP v Mustapah bin Abdullah[2022] SGHC 262\n33kau hisap \u2026\u201d phrase, but had left out other explanations he gave. I saw no basis \nwhatsoever for his criticisms of Dr Yeo. The IMH report was objective and was \nbased on Dr Yeo\u2019s contemporaneous notes of his interviews with the accused, \nwhere he had been assisted by a Malay interpreter. There was no conceivable \nreason for Dr Yeo to have lied to implicate the accused, to have conducted \nhimself improperly or to have been anything less than objective and impartial \nin his assessment of the accused.\nWhether the acts of penetration were for the accused\u2019s sexual gratification\n80 I shall briefly address this issue for completeness, since the accused\u2019s \nposition appeared to be that even if he had penetrated the victims\u2019 mouths with \nhis penis, he did not and could not have derived any sexual gratification from \ndoing so. The Prosecution\u2019s case was pitched somewhat differently in any case. \nThe Prosecution submitted that the accused had been angry due to the victims\u2019 \nalleged circulation of the rumour, and had been motivated by revenge to commit \nthe offences.163 It was not the Prosecution\u2019s case that the accused had done so \nfor the sake of sexual gratification.\n81 Notably, this argument appeared to find some support in [V2]\u2019s \nindication that the accused was not actually asking for oral sex when he said the \n\u201ctakde kau hisap \u2026\u201d phrase, but was \u201cpissed off\u201d (see [ 18] above). From this, \nit could be seen that [V2]\u2019s perception was that the accused was not seeking \nsexual gratification but was displaying his irascibility over the victims having \nallegedly spread rumours about him and [M2]. I accepted that this was a fair \nand reasonable characterisation of the accused\u2019s animus. He was seeking \nprimarily to vent his anger and to chastise the victims for their impertinence. It \n163 Prosecution\u2019s submissions at para 115. \nVersion No 1: 19 Oct 2022 (11:54 hrs)\nPP v Mustapah bin Abdullah[2022] SGHC 262\n34was consistent with the undisputed fact that each incident of sexual penetration \nwas brief, lasting only a few seconds at most. In addition, the accused\u2019s penis \nwas not erect and he did not ejaculate.\n82 Nevertheless, in my view, an offender\u2019s motive in committing the \noffence under s 376(1)(a) of the Penal Code is irrelevant. Specifically, obtaining \nsexual gratification is plainly not an element of the offence. Lust or libido are \nnot ingredients of the offence. An offender may commit the offence for one or \nmore reasons which are best known only to himself, whether for sexual \ngratification, as a perverse display of ego-boosting bravado, or to intimidate, \nhumiliate, degrade and\/or assert authority over his victim(s). There may well be \nother possible reasons. Whatever the accused\u2019s actual motivation(s) might have \nbeen in the present case, this had no bearing on the material elements of the \noffence. The offence was still a sexual offence once the requisite elements of \nthe offence had been proved. \n83 To reiterate, the crucial elements to be proved beyond reasonable doubt \nwere that there were acts of penetration, and that the victims had not consented \nto the acts. I have explained above why I found that the accused had penetrated \nthe victims\u2019 mouths with his penis. In connection with the latter requirement, it \nalso had to be shown that the victims did not consent to the sexual acts in the \ncircumstances of the case and that the accused had known or had reason to \nbelieve that the victims had engaged in the acts out of fear of injury.\nWhether the victims consented to the sexual acts with the accused\n84 A key plank of the defence was that the victims had been given a choice \nas to whether to fellate the accused. Further, the accused claimed to be surprised \nthat the victims had taken the \u201ctakde kau hisap \u2026\u201d phrase, which he claimed \nVersion No 1: 19 Oct 2022 (11:54 hrs)\nPP v Mustapah bin Abdullah[2022] SGHC 262\n35was a \u201cslang\u201d, literally and had agreed to suck his penis. The victims, however, \nall testified that they had been fearful that the accused would cause injury to \nthem or their families and had only acquiesced to his demands to fellate him as \na result (see [ 16], [ 19], [ 21] and [ 24] above).\n85 It was crucial to appreciate the full context in which the victims had \nagreed to \u201csettle\u201d the problem with the accused by sucking his penis. The \nuncontroverted evidence was that the accused was angry that the victims had \npurportedly spread rumours about him making [M2] suck his penis and were \navoiding him. He wanted to know who had been responsible for the rumours. \nHe confronted the victims and spared no effort to demonstrate his capacity to \ncarry out his threats of violence; in fact, he had no qualms resorting to various \ndisplays of violence on the victims to strike fear in them and punish them, such \nas by kicking or slapping them. In my assessment, the victims had no reason to \ndoubt that the accused was serious about his threats of violence.\n86 Beginning with the accused\u2019s conversation over the phone with [V1] at \naround midnight on 17 October 2018, the accused had systematically threatened \nand browbeaten the victims. [V1] was the first to meet the accused at the fitness \ncorner near the hut, after he was told that the accused would \u201cpotong\u201d him if he \ndid not meet him immediately (see [ 7] above). [V1] was then assaulted and \nrecalled feeling pain from the accused having squeezed his jawline and slapped \nhim (see [ 8] above). [V1] felt \u201cvery scared\u201d at that time and shouted for the \naccused to stop.164 The accused then used vulgarities and offensive language in \ntext messages to [V2] and [V3] (see [ 9]\u2013[10] above). [V2] testified that he felt \nafraid as he thought that the accused was angry with him.165\n164 Transcript, 26 Apr 2022, p 19 lines 2\u20134. \n165 Transcript, 12 Apr 2022, p 88 lines 1\u20137.\nVersion No 1: 19 Oct 2022 (11:54 hrs)\nPP v Mustapah bin Abdullah[2022] SGHC 262\n3687 [V3] later met the accused after midnight on 17 October 2018. [V3] was \nthreatened with harassment at his residence, and the accused said that he would \n\u201cpotong\u201d [V3]\u2019s family members if it transpired that [V3] had been trying to \ndefend the person who had spread the rumour. The accused was angry and \npulled [V3] hard by the hair. He also threatened to hit [V3] with the beer bottle \nhe was holding. [V3] felt \u201creally scared\u201d and cried (see [ 11] above).\n88 On the night of the incident itself, when the accused met the victims at \naround 10.30pm, he lost no time in terrorising them. It appeared that the accused \nhad been drinking. When [V2] arrived, the accused kicked [V2] on his back \n(albeit lightly) while holding on to a beer bottle (at [ 13] above). He then \nproceeded to slap [V3], knocking [V3]\u2019s spectacles to the floor, and thrust his \nhand towards [V3]\u2019s eye in an attempt to scratch [V3]\u2019s eyeball166 (at [ 14] \nabove). The accused also slapped [V1].167 [V1] and [V2] testified that the \naccused\u2019s aggressiveness made them feel afraid.168 The accused confronted the \nvictims over the rumour and brought up his past involvement in gang fights, \nwhile threatening to go to their homes, causing them to fear that he would harass \ntheir families. The victims all testified that they were fearful of the accused as \nhe behaved violently and aggressively. They also believed that the accused was \ncapable of carrying out the violent acts he threatened, as the accused had \npreviously told them about his involvement in a gang.\n89 The victims were subsequently told to meet the accused one-on-one at \nthe top of the slide at the playground. None of them dared to decline. Eventually, \neach of the victims was presented with the accused\u2019s ultimatum: either to \n166 Transcript, 21 Apr 2022, p 46 lines 18\u201322. \n167 AB at p 13 ([M1]\u2019s statement at para 9).\n168 Transcript, 12 Apr 2022, p 93 lines 17\u201323. \nVersion No 1: 19 Oct 2022 (11:54 hrs)\nPP v Mustapah bin Abdullah[2022] SGHC 262\n37\u201csettle\u201d the problem with him by sucking his penis, or walk away (and be \nprepared for the consequences). The accused attempted to characterise this as a \nchoice that he gave the victims. In the circumstances, I found that the obvious \ntruth of the matter was that the accused had presented them with a Hobson\u2019s \nchoice. The victims complied by accepting the ignominious \u201coption\u201d of sucking \nthe accused\u2019s penis. To them, this was the lesser of two evils. What was \nmanifestly clear was that they had only complied out of fear after they had been \nthreatened and assaulted by the accused. They were also in fear of further harm \nor harassment that the accused might inflict on them or their families if they \nchose to walk away instead. \n90 Plainly, the victims did not consent, but did so, in [V3]\u2019s words, \u201cfor the \nsake of settling\u201d the conflict.169 They did not act voluntarily and did not submit \nthemselves while \u201cin free and unconstrained possession of [their] physical and \nmoral power to act in a manner [they] wanted\u201d, adopting the language of the \nHigh Court in Public Prosecutor v Iryan bin Abdul Karim and others [2010] 2 \nSLR 15 at [123].

In this connection, the court must have \nclose regard to the accused\u2019s reason or purpose for repacking drugs, which is to \nbe objectively ascertained upon taking into account all the facts and context of \nthe case (see Zainudin at [92]). It is in this context that the accused\u2019s evidence \nof the reason he repacked the Repacked Drugs assumes critical importance (see \nZainudin at [92]\u2013[95] and [110]\u2013[111]).\n10 Here, the accused\u2019s explanation is that he had repacked the Repacked \nDrugs into what were subsequently labelled exhibits D4, D6, D7 and D8 \nbecause their original packaging was torn. This forms the thrust of the Defence\u2019s \ncase.5 I reject the accused\u2019s explanation and the Defence\u2019s case.\n11 Firstly, I agree with the Prosecution that the accused gave inconsistent \nevidence as to whether the original packaging was torn when he received the \nRepacked Drugs.6\n5 DSS at para 3.\n6 PSS at paras 8\u20139.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2022 (14:02 hrs)\nPP v Shen Hanjie[2022] SGHC 265\n712 In the accused\u2019s 2nd Long Statement, the accused said that \u201cwhen [he] \nreceived the big black packet marked with D4, [he] did not open up to see what \n[was] inside\u201d [emphasis added].7 This indicated that exhibit D4 was the original \npackaging. There was also no mention of there being an earlier packaging which \nwas torn, which required the accused to use exhibit D4 as a replacement \npackaging. However, at trial, the accused said that he had received some of the \nRepacked Drugs in a torn black zip lock bag and proceeded to repack them into \nexhibit D4 on Alan\u2019s instructions. As a result, his DNA was found on exhibits \nD4 and D4C2.8 When the accused\u2019s attention was drawn to the conflict between \nhis 2nd Long Statement wherein he said that he did not open up exhibit D4, and \nhis aforementioned explanation for the presence of his DNA on exhibit D4, the \naccused said that he could not remember which bags were torn and required \nrepacking,9 and was uncertain whether he opened the packaging of the \nRepacked Drugs found in exhibit D4.10\n13 In the accused\u2019s 3rd Long Statement, the accused said:11\n\u2026 For Photo 42 to Photo 46, I only recogni[s]e the big black \nplastic marked with D5, D6, D7, D8 and D9 in Photo 42 \nand Photo 43.

There was no mention that the original \npackaging was torn. The accused also expressly stated in his 3rd Long Statement \nthat he did not open up the exhibits to check their contents, and that he had never \nseen the contents of exhibits D6, D7 and D8 prior to the recording of this \nstatement. Again, the accused\u2019s evidence shifted at trial. On the stand, the \naccused claimed that he had discovered that there was no Erimin-5 in exhibits \nD6, D7 and D8 when he \u201cwanted to change the bag which were torn\u201d and \u201csaw \nthe things inside\u201d.12\n14 Secondly, the first time the accused claimed that the original packaging \nof the Repacked Drugs was torn was during his examination-in-chief, when he \nwas asked to explain the presence of his DNA on various exhibits.13 Although \nthe accused in his 3rd Long Statement said that \u201csometimes, if some of the big \nblack plastic [bags were] torn, [he would] put them into a similar big plastic\u201d,14 \nhe was merely describing his general practice. He did not specifically mention \nin his statements that he had repacked the Repacked Drugs because their \noriginal packaging was torn. This specific point was only raised at trial. Even \nthough the DNA reports were only issued by the HSA on 16 April 2019 after \nseven out of eight of the investigative statements were taken,15 the accused could \nstill have mentioned that he had repacked the Repacked Drugs in his statements \n12 22 July 2021 Transcript at p 15 lines 27\u201330 (see also p 16 lines 4\u201312).\n13 16 July 2021 Transcript at p 25 line 1 to p 27 line 13.\n14 AB 398 (para 29).\n15 Agreed Statement of Facts at para 29; AB 135\u2013208.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2022 (14:02 hrs)\nPP v Shen Hanjie[2022] SGHC 265\n9at any point in time, regardless of when the DNA reports were issued. The \nbelatedness of this point undermines its veracity.\n15 Thirdly, and relatedly, all these (at [ 11]\u2013[ 14] above) cohere with the \nfinding in the judgment on conviction that the accused was a witness lacking in \ncredit. This is further reinforced by the conflict between the accused\u2019s evidence \nthat he repacked the Repacked Drugs because the original packaging was torn \n(which was first raised in his oral testimony) and his position in his 2nd and 3rd \nLong Statements that he did not see the contents of the exhibits at all. If the \nformer was true, the accused would have seen at least some of the items found \nwithin the exhibits; if the latter was true, that would undermine the credibility \nof his claim that the original packaging was torn which prompted him to repack \nthe Repacked Drugs. \n16 That said, to the accused\u2019s credit, he consistently stated in his 3rd Long \nStatement and oral testimony that he would change the drug packaging \nwhenever the original packaging was torn.16 However, this does not take the \naccused very far. This may be a general practice of the accused, but the inquiry \nfor the purposes of ss 33B(2)(a) and 33B(3)(a) of the MDA must be directed \ntowards the accused\u2019s acts in relation to the particular consignment of drugs \nwhich form the subject matter of the charge against him (Zamri bin Mohd Tahir \nv Public Prosecutor [2019] 1 SLR 724 at [15] and Mohammad Farid bin Batra \nv Public Prosecutor and another"}

By this, Kishor thought that he was not carrying an illegal substance \nbecause the customs officer had checked it and let him through.77\n75 Kishor then called Suresh to ask him where to deliver the Black Bundles \nand subsequently proceeded to Circuit Road. He called Pung to say that he had \narrived and, after that call, made another call to Suresh\u2019s handphone and spoke \nto Chandru to confirm if Pung was the person he was to deliver the Black \nBundles to.78 Whilst talking to Chandru on the phone, Kishor met Pung. When \nKishor handed the Grey Bag to Pung, he accidentally dropped his handphone \nand, as he picked it up, Pung handed him a white envelope (\u201cWhite Envelope\u201d). \nKishor took the White Envelope but he did not know what it contained.

TEC would call Tan who \nwould then inform Pung to meet the person (delivering the items) near the \nCondo, and sometimes TEC would use Arum\u2019s handphone to call Pung.80 \n77 Since end-2014 until his arrest in 2016, TEC had been sending dog food, \ncat food, biscuits and Chinese medicine (collectively \u201cthe Items\u201d) to Pung \nthrough intermediaries. TEC would inform Tan which of the Items were for his \nfriends or for Pung\u2019s family. Where the Items were for TEC\u2019s friends, Pung felt \ncompelled and \u201cforced\u201d to take and store them temporarily at his home until \nTEC\u2019s friends came to collect them. If he did not agree to do so, TEC would \ncomplain to Tan and \u201cpressurise\u201d her. Tan would then \u201csubmit\u201d to TEC and ask \nPung to do TEC\u2019s bidding. Pung did not want his relationship with Tan to be \nstrained as they quarrelled often regarding TEC. Hence, he agreed to help TEC \nsafekeep items to maintain harmony in the home. Pung was also afraid of TEC \nbecause he had a very bad temper.81 \n78 About six months before Pung\u2019s arrest, TEC called Pung to say that it \nwas inconvenient for him to schedule delivery and collection of goods and TEC \nintroduced Arum to Pung for this purpose. TEC gave Pung a three-step \ninstruction. First, when Arum called Pung, Pung would have to ask Arum \u201cone \nor two\u201d. Second, if Arum said \u201cone\u201d, Pung would prepare $3,200 for Arum, and \nif Arum said \u201ctwo\u201d, Pung would prepare $6,400. If Arum asked for more \nmoney, Pung would give him more money. Third, Pung was to arrange with \nArum to collect the goods. However, he did not know whether the person he \ncollected the goods from was Arum. Arum would communicate with Pung to \n80 27\/10\/21 NE 5.\n81 27\/10\/21 NE 2, 6\u20138, 15; 28\/10\/21 NE 16\u201320; AB 630\u2013631 (7th Statement at [47]\u2013\n[48]).\nVersion No 1: 05 Feb 2022 (13:44 hrs)\nPP v Kishor Kumar a\/l Raguan[2022] SGHC 27\n32deliver items to Pung about once a month or every two months. The moneys \nthat Pung passed to Arum were debts that Pung collected on TEC\u2019s behalf.82\n79 On 29 July 2016, Arum called Pung to arrange a time to collect an item. \nPung brought along the White Envelope to pass to Arum. It contained $6,400 \nwhich Arum had arranged with Pung on 26 July 2016 when he told Pung that \nPung was taking \u201c2 portions\u201d. Pung also added $100 to that sum. When Pung \nmet up with Kishor, Kishor handed him the Grey Bag and he passed the White \nEnvelope to Kishor. The Grey Bag was tied up and Pung thought it contained \ncat or dog food.83 He was arrested whilst walking home.\n80 Pung claimed that TEC had forced him to take possession of the Grey \nBag and items therein, as well as the Kucinta Bag, Purina Bag and Wafer Bags, \nfor the reasons as stated at [ 77] above, and that he stored them temporarily as \nTEC had told him that someone would collect them subsequently.84\nElements of the charge\n81 For the offence of trafficking in a controlled drug under s 5(1)(a) of the \nMDA to be made out, the Prosecution must prove the act of trafficking in a \ncontrolled drug without any authorisation, and knowledge of the nature of the \ncontrolled drug (Saravanan Chandaram v Public Prosecutor and another \nmatter [2020] 2 SLR 95 at [185]).

SUM 1183 was heard and granted ex parte on the same day by Andrew Ang SJ. The interim ASI is embodied in HC\/ORC 1463\/2021 (\u201cORC 1463\u201d). The plaintiff notified the defendant of ORC 1463 immediately after the hearing. 2', '6\\u2003ORC 1463 reads as follows:', '7\\u2003An issue arose at the oral hearing before me on 22 July 2022 as to the relevance of ORC 1463 to the present committal application, which was taken out only in relation to ORC 6040. I address this below as a preliminary issue (at [36]\u2013[50]). In essence, what has become of this issue is that the plaintiff has decided not to pursue breaches of ORC 1463 as part of the present proceedings (without forbearing to bring future proceedings pertaining to the same).', '8\\u2003Given the circumstances, I do not intend to comment further on the wording of ORC 1463, save to note that the reference in ORC 1463 to \u201cCompany Petition in the National Company Law Tribunal (\u201cNCLT\u201d) in Mumbai, India, which was served on the Plaintiff on 3 March 2021\u201d refers to the same petition as \u201cCompany Petition No. 92 of 2021\u201d in Order 1(a) of ORC 6040. The latter simply reflects the petition number that was later assigned to those proceedings: see OS 242 Judgment at [13]. To clarify this further, I turn to outline the foreign proceedings that the ASI is concerned with.', '9\\u2003The alleged breaches of ORC 6040 pertain to two sets of Indian proceedings: proceedings before the National Company Law Tribunal in Mumbai, India (\u201cNCLT\u201d), and proceedings before the Bombay High Court. These neatly correspond to breaches of different parts of ORC 6040: the NCLT proceedings engage Order 1(a) (as described at [4] above), and the Bombay High Court proceedings engage Order 1(b) (also as described at [4] above).', '10\\u2003The parties broadly do not dispute the occurrence of the steps taken (or not taken) in the proceedings before the NCLT and the Bombay High Court. 3', 'The dispute centres on the legal significance of these acts and omissions.', '11\\u2003The NCLT proceedings were commenced by the defendant on 3 March 2021, prior to ORC 6040 being made, and indeed, prior to the commencement of OS 242. The defendant\u2019s petition was subsequently assigned the case number Company Petition No 92 of 2021 (\u201cthe NCLT Petition\u201d) (see OS 242 Judgment at [13]\u2013[14]). The respondents to this petition are the same persons named in Order 1(b) of ORC 6040: the plaintiff, Ms Shobitha Annie Mani (\u201cMs Mani\u201d), Mr Navin Mittal, Mr Anand Mittal and People Interactive (India) Pte Ltd (\u201cPeople Interactive\u201d).', '12\\u2003The genesis of the NCLT proceedings has been set out more fully in the OS 242 Judgment at [9]\u2013[13]. In essence, the dispute principally relates to two matters: the management of People Interactive (where the plaintiff and defendant are shareholders), and the rights and obligations of shareholders under a Shareholders\u2019 Agreement (or \u201cSHA\u201d). The defendant seeks the following reliefs in the NCLT proceedings:', '13\\u2003In the OS 242 Judgment, I held (at [66]\u2013[68]) that all disputes between the parties brought before the NCLT fell within the scope of the arbitration agreement contained in the SHA. I further found that the circumstances militated in favour of granting a permanent ASI, and granted the ASI accordingly (at [69]\u2013[93]). Relevantly, Order 1(a) of ORC 6040 is worded to restrain the defendant from pursuing, continuing and\/or proceeding with the action commenced by him by way of the NCLT Petition.', '14\\u2003At the time I heard parties in relation to the ASI application, the NCLT Petition had not been withdrawn. Instead, the defendant has repeatedly sought adjournments of the hearing of the NCLT Petition.

On the same day, the defendant also applied for interim reliefs pending the final determination of Suit 95 (Interim Application No 1010 of 2021) (\u201cIA 1010\u201d). The applications were served on the plaintiff\u2019s Indian solicitors, AZB & Partners, on 24 March 2021. 5', '16\\u2003Some months later, the defendant sought to, inter alia, amend Suit 95.

This included bringing on record ORC 6040 and affidavits filed by Indian law experts in the Singapore proceedings.', '17\\u2003While much emphasis was placed on IA 2827\u2019s nature as an amendment application, there were in fact two distinct forms of relief sought thereunder: first, an amendment of the plaint, and second, the grant of a temporary injunction restraining the defendants in Suit 95 from holding a requisitioned extraordinary general meeting (\u201cEGM\u201d, and in relation to the injunction, \u201cEGM Injunction\u201d). 7', 'The prayers sought in IA 2827 were worded as follows: 8', '18\\u2003To put the second relief (ie, the EGM Injunction) in context, the notices dated 24 February 2021 that are mentioned in para 14(b) had requisitioned an EGM to appoint additional directors and a managing director for People Interactive.

{"casename":"2022_SGHC_280","fact":"'4\\u2003The background facts are largely undisputed. Hawaii Tower is a 21-storey freehold residential condominium development (\u201cthe Development\u201d) comprising 135 units situated at 73 to 77 Meyer Road, Singapore. The Development was completed in 1984. The appellant has been living in the Development since June 1995. Apart from the Unit, the appellant also owns another unit in the Development at 77 Meyer Road. That other unit is tenanted. For present purposes, this is what the fa\u00e7ade of Stack 1 of Block 75 (where the Unit is located) looks like from a reasonable ground level: 1', '', '5\\u2003Importantly, the respondent had passed Additional By-Laws in 1990 and 2014 that are relevant to the present case. First, on 15 March 1990, the respondent passed the 1990 Additional By-Laws, of which Clauses 6.0 and 7.0 are relevant: 2', '6\\u2003Second, on 15 November 2014, the respondent passed the 2014 Additional By-Laws, pursuant to s 32 of the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act 2004 (2020 Rev Ed) (\u201cBMSMA\u201d) at the general meeting held in November 2014. These 2014 Additional By-Laws therefore predate the appellant\u2019s application to renovate the Unit. While the 2014 Additional By-Laws were passed before the latest version of the BMSMA, nothing turns on this in the present appeal.', '7\\u2003For present purposes, Part III of the 2014 Additional By-Laws provides, among others, as follows:', 'The Appendix C referred to by Clause 6 of Part III of the 2014 Additional By-Laws comprises the prescribed \u201cApplication Form for Additional & Alteration Works\u201d, a summary of the relevant clauses from the 2014 Additional By-Laws, and extracts of the relevant clauses from the 2014 Additional By-Laws. Nothing in the present appeal turns on the contents of Appendix C, except in so far as such content is replicated from the relevant clauses of the 2014 Additional By-Laws set out above.', '8\\u2003Rather than a strict chronological order, I organise my discussion of the background facts along the following themes: (a) the nature of the Unapproved Works, (b) the appellant\u2019s reinstatement works, and (c) the appellant\u2019s request for past renovation records.', '9\\u2003On 29 January 2021, the appellant applied to the respondent to carry out extensive renovation to the Unit. The appellant\u2019s application was accompanied by an attachment with a description of the works to be carried out. There was a total of ten work items. These did not include the Unapproved Works, which deserve further explanation. In this regard, it would have been helpful had a floorplan of the Unit been more clearly referred to in the affidavits. This would have helped the court visualise and contextualise what may be difficult to understand through a written description. For example, the description of \u201cthe replacement of the air-conditioner condenser unit placed on the external wall\u201d begs several questions. Where is this external wall relative to the Unit? How does the wall feature against the external fa\u00e7ade? Indeed, I eventually located the floorplan in the appellant\u2019s second affidavit (which had been appended for a tangential purpose). This is then a floorplan of the Unit: 3', '10\\u2003It becomes much easier to visualise and contextualise the Unapproved Works by reference to this floorplan.', '(a)\\u2003First, the appellant had installed aluminium framed glass windows behind the approved window grilles along the balcony edge. This, I understand to refer to the two curved windows at the top of this floorplan, where the two balconies are referred to:', 'For convenience, I will term this work item as the \u201cAluminium Glass Windows Installation\u201d.', '(b)\\u2003Second, the appellant had removed the sliding doors of the living room and master bedroom. This, I understand to be the sliding door between the areas marked \u201cBalcony\u201d and \u201cLiving Room\u201d\/\u201cMaster Bedroom\u201d in the floorplan. More specifically, the sliding doors, which have been removed, are represented by the jagged line between the areas just mentioned:', 'For convenience, I will term this work item as the \u201cSliding Doors Removal\u201d.', '(c)\\u2003Third, the appellant had intended to replace the air-conditioner condenser unit placed on the external wall. Mr Vijayendran and Mr Leo Cheng Suan (\u201cMr Leo\u201d), who appeared for the respondent, confirmed that because the appellant had already removed his existing air-conditioner condenser unit and not installed his new one, there are no photographs of this particular work. Be that as it may, the parties pointed me to photographs in the record which showed how the replacement air-conditioner condenser unit would have looked like, had it been installed. For example, this photograph below, which, while not showing the air-conditioner condenser of the Unit, shows a similar example one storey above the Unit: 4', 'Similarly, there are other photographs in the record which show similar air-conditioner condenser units in other units within the Development, 5', 'of which I reproduce one:', 'For convenience, I will term this work item as the \u201cAir-Conditioner Condenser Replacement\u201d.', '11\\u2003The first two Unapproved Works, viz, the Aluminium Glass Windows Installation and the Sliding Doors Removal, had come about in the following manner. After the appellant\u2019s application to commence renovation, Mr Loh Kok Leong (\u201cMr Loh\u201d), the respondent\u2019s condominium manager, verbally approved the application on 29 January 2021 itself.', '12\\u2003On 3 February 2021, the renovation began with hacking works. In the course of the works, the appellant\u2019s contractor removed the sliding doors at the balconies of the living room and master bedroom. This can be seen in the photograph below. Compared against the floorplan, the sliding doors would have been where the rectangular opening that occupies about three-quarters of the photograph, from left to right: 6', 'As can be seen, the sliding doors are some distance away from the balcony edge.', '13\\u2003In addition, the contractor also hacked \u201cthe half-walls within [the Unit]\u201d. More specifically, the contractor \u201chacked an opening on the master and common bathroom reinforced concrete wall below the window, which is part of the building fa\u00e7ade\u201d. 7', '14\\u2003The appellant has said that he removed the sliding doors at the balconies so that he could install aluminium framed glass windows along the balcony edge. Apparently, the plan to install the glass windows had only materialised after the renovation application had been approved by Mr Loh on 29 January 2021. The appellant\u2019s explanation for why he had not sought further approval before starting work was that he \u201cinadvertently forgot to update the renovation form\u201d that he had earlier submitted. 8', 'The appellant has maintained this reason for the present appeal. 9', '15\\u2003On 26 February 2021, the respondent stopped all works at the Unit. It also prevented the appellant\u2019s contractor from accessing the Unit. Mr Loh informed the appellant that the respondent objected to the removal of the sliding doors at the balconies of the living room and master bedroom, as well as the installation of the aluminium framed glass windows behind the existing window grilles. This was because these works would affect the fa\u00e7ade of the Development.', '16\\u2003The appellant could not make sense of the respondent\u2019s objections. This was because he was simply doing what he had done to the balconies of two of the bedrooms in the Unit some 18 years ago. Indeed, the appellant had renovated the Unit on two previous occasions. He had carried out the following works without the respondent objecting: (a) affixing an air-conditioner condenser unit on an external wall some 25 years ago, (b) installing window grilles in the balcony some 24 years ago for the living room, master bedroom and two other bedrooms, and (c) removing the balcony sliding doors and installing aluminium framed sliding glass windows at the balconies of two of the bedrooms some 18 years ago. However, the respondent did not have any record of the appellant\u2019s application for approval to do these works.', '17\\u2003Be that as it may, to restart the renovation, the appellant then asked Mr Loh if the respondent would be amenable to him installing foldable and frameless glass curtains to the balcony of his living room and master bedroom (\u201cglass curtains\u201d). According to the appellant, the glass curtains would be less visible from the outside as they did not have any frames. However, Mr Loh informed the appellant that the respondent would likewise not allow the glass curtains. Instead, for the renovation to continue, the respondent would require the appellant to first carry out reinstatement works. It was then that the appellant formally wrote to the respondent to seek its consent for the removal of the sliding doors and the installation of the glass curtains behind the window grilles.', '18\\u2003On the evening of 26 February 2021, the appellant emailed Mr Loh, seeking the respondent\u2019s approval to install glass curtains to the balconies of the living room and master bedroom. The appellant explained that he would like to do this to (a) make the premises \u201cdengue-safe\u201d for his elderly relatives who visited him and spent time at the balcony, and (b) to keep out the construction noise and dust from the nearby constructive site at Meyer Rise.', '19\\u2003 On 2 March 2021, Mr Loh replied that the respondent did not approve the request to install glass curtains as this was deemed to be changing the building fa\u00e7ade. The appellant continued to press his case. He emphasised that the glass curtains which he intended to install behind the existing grilles are frameless and would not detract from the appearance of the building. It would also provide an additional barrier against haze. In addition, there were numerous other units in the Development that had windows installed at their balconies. The respondent remained unmoved and maintained its disapproval of these works.', '20\\u2003The third of the Unapproved Works, viz, the Air-Conditioner Condenser Replacement, had come about in the following manner. While the renovations were going on in the first instance, the appellant decided to replace the old air-conditioner condenser that he had previously affixed to the external wall of the Unit some 25 years ago. The appellant informed Mr Loh of this decision verbally. Mr Loh apparently told the appellant that this work would be approved, provided that the water discharge from the condenser pipe is rerouted into the Unit.', '21\\u2003On 16 April 2021, after the respondent stopped all works on 26 February 2021, Mr Loh informed the appellant\u2019s contractor that the air-conditioner condenser would not be allowed to be installed on the external wall. Instead, it had to be installed within the Unit. The respondent\u2019s reason was that the installation of the new air-conditioner condenser on the external wall poses a hazard to residents. Further, the respondent demanded that the appellant also remove his existing air-conditioner condenser, that is, the one he had intended to replace. However, by this time, the appellant had already removed his old air-conditioning condenser unit.', '22\\u2003Just as the respondent\u2019s reason for disapproving the Aluminium Glass Windows Installation and the Sliding Doors Removal did not make sense to the appellant, so too did this explanation in relation to the Air-Conditioner Condenser Replacement. This is because the appellant was doing what he had done 25 years ago. Also, the appellant pointed to other units in the Development which had their air-conditioner condensers installed on the external wall in a similar manner. The respondent remained unmoved.', '23\\u2003Thus, the respondent has maintained its disapproval of the Unapproved Works comprising the Aluminium Glass Window Installation, the Sliding Doors Removal, and the Air-Conditioner Condenser Replacement. This has resulted in the appellant\u2019s application to the DJ and the present appeal before me. Having set out the way the Unapproved Works had come about, I turn now to how the parties attempted to resolve the deadlock through the appellant promising to undertake reinstatement works. I should add, however, that after the appellant dropped his appeal in relation to his claim for damages, nothing in the present appeal turns on these reinstatement works.', '24\\u2003As a result of the respondent\u2019s stoppage of the appellant\u2019s renovation, the appellant\u2019s contractor could not carry out any works between 26 February 2021 and 18 March 2021. Eventually, Mr Loh informed the appellant that he could resume work if he carried out certain reinstatement works as set out in an email dated 18 March 2021 as follows: 10', '25\\u2003However, the appellant did not carry out the reinstatement works. The respondent therefore stopped the works in the Unit again on 10 May 2021. From the limited correspondence adduced in evidence, the DJ found that the appellant had not carried out the reinstatement works even up to 21 May 2021. Indeed, in the respondent\u2019s solicitor\u2019s reply of 21 May 2021, a further deadline of 4 June 2021 was extended to the appellant to complete the reinstatement works.', '26\\u2003It appears that a critical issue between the parties was the reinstatement of the master and common bathroom reinforced concrete wall below the window which was part of the building fa\u00e7ade. This is item 2 in Mr Loh\u2019s email dated 18 March 2021. The appellant\u2019s contractor had \u201chacked an opening on the master and common bathroom reinforced concrete wall below the window, which is part of the building fa\u00e7ade\u201d 11', 'because the appellant wanted to install a \u201cwindow door\u201d in its place to improve the ventilation in the Unit. The appellant knew this was not part of the approved works. But he went ahead with it as he thought the \u201cwindow door\u201d would not be visible from the external fa\u00e7ade due to the half-height wall at the balcony ledge with window grilles installed.', '27\\u2003In this regard, the respondent had become concerned that this wall was a structural wall as it was supported by rebars. The appellant obtained the endorsed certification of a professional engineer to support his claim that the hacking of the wall would not affect the structural integrity of the building. However, as the DJ found, the certification pertained to an internal wall and not the reinforced concrete wall below the window.', '28\\u2003Eventually, the Building and Construction Authority (\u201cBCA\u201d) inspected and determined that the wall was structural. The BCA therefore directed the appellant to reinstate it. The appellant duly reinstated the wall with a professional engineer\u2019s endorsement obtained on 1 November 2021, as required by the BCA.', '29\\u2003Given the appellant\u2019s feeling that he was being unfairly targeted by the respondent, he verbally requested from Mr Loh the records of all the owners who had made renovation applications since November 2014. This was because he had observed that various units in the Development had installed window grilles and glass windows. This meant that the building had no uniform fa\u00e7ade to begin with. He also observed that the other owners had installed their air-conditioner condensers on the external wall without the respondent taking any action against them. Above all, as already mentioned, the appellant wanted these records to satisfy himself that the respondent\u2019s current disapproval of the Unapproved Works was not unfairly targeting him.', '30\\u2003Despite the respondent\u2019s earlier refusal to allow the appellant access to the records, the respondent relented once the appellant engaged solicitors who wrote to the respondent on its obligation under s 47(1) of the BMSMA. Upon his inspection, the appellant observed that there are currently a total of 19 units in the Development (excluding the Unit) which had also installed windows at their balconies. The 19 units comprised five units in Block 73, 11 units in Block 75, and three units in Block 77.', '31\\u2003More significantly, despite being able to access the records all the way back to 1995, the appellant did not find any records of the previous renovations that he had carried out to the Unit about 18 years ago when he removed the balcony sliding doors and installed aluminium framed glass windows in two of the bedrooms of the Unit.

However, with respect to the DJ, it is entirely plausible that the appellant had applied to carry out those renovations, but the respondent had lost the records. Indeed, Mr Vijayendran confirmed before me that the appellant\u2019s position was that he had applied to carry out those renovations in the past.

Pursuant to the Contract, MAJ agreed to provide long-term hangar parking services for the Aircraft at $2,900 per month (\u201cthe Hangarage Fees\u201d). Accordingly, MAJ had granted the defendant a contractual licence to park the Aircraft on the Property (\u201cthe Licence\u201d).

There was no reply from the defendant.', '9\\u2003On 24 January 2022, by way of a Deed of Assignment, MAJ assigned the Hangarage Fees and all rights, title, claims, demands, benefits, and interest under and in respect of the Fees to the plaintiff free and clear of any other claims, rights, or interest of any person whatsoever. Crucially, the Deed of Assignment does not purport to assign or transfer any rights or obligations under the Contract.

The DPP then commenced his cross-examination of the accused. At the completion of the DPP\u2019s cross-examination and before the accused\u2019s re-examination, Mr Hassan asked for an adjournment of the trial to take instructions from the accused as this would be his first opportunity to do so since his appointment as counsel in September 2019, some 19 months earlier. 5', '11\\u2003On 31 August 2021 when the trial resumed after it was again part-heard, Mr Hassan requested for all the documents (including the statement of facts) in relation to Babu\u2019s plea of guilt to the reduced charge.

This had happened some months earlier on 4 March 2021 during the accused\u2019s cross-examination by Mr Tiwary when the accused (who had all along been giving oral evidence in the Tamil language) suddenly shouted at Mr Tiwary in English saying: \u201cI am not blaming. You understand or not? \u2026 You came down below in the lock-up. You tell me. You take all the things [meaning the drugs].

The accused said that he had gotten upset and angry as the things that Mr Tiwary was saying and putting to the accused were untrue 10', '. I note that Babu had since pleaded guilty to drug trafficking in conjunction with the accused in this case (see [9] above).

It is in the business of processing and distributing metal and engineering products, and specialises in the supply of steel products for the building and construction industry. 1', '3\\u2003The first defendant, Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Southeast Asia Pte Ltd (\u201cNippon Steel Singapore\u201d) is a Singapore incorporated company. It is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the second defendant, Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corporation (\u201cNippon Steel Japan\u201d), which is a company incorporated under the laws of Japan. 2', 'Nippon Steel Japan is in the business of steelmaking and steel fabrication. 3', 'According to Nippon Steel Singapore, it does not manufacture or fabricate steel but performs \u201cspecific business functions\u201d in and out of Singapore. 4', '4\\u2003One Mr Yoshimitsu Murahashi (\u201cMr Murahashi\u201d) joined Nippon Steel Singapore from Nippon Steel Japan in late 2011. 5', 'As at October 2017, he was a Senior Manager, Technical Services, in Nippon Steel Singapore. 6', 'As will become clear, Mr Murahashi played a central role in the creation and dissemination, if any, of the alleged defamatory publication (\u201cthe Publication\u201d) and words (\u201cthe Words\u201d). The Publication and the Words are set out in full in Annexes 1 and 2 respectively. Where appropriate, I refer to the Publication and the Words collectively as the \u201cAlleged Defamatory Material\u201d.', '5\\u2003This suit revolves around the Product. CS began distributing the Product in the Singapore market in or around 2014. It is CS\u2019s case that the Product is of superior quality to other steel grades on the market, including S460M. For convenience, I refer to this grade of steel as the \u201cSuperior steel grade\u201d or \u201cSuperior grade\u201d. I explain the difference between the various grades of steel at [7]\u2013[9] below. CS pleads that the Alleged Defamatory Material conveyed to the reasonable person that, among other things, the Product was sold by CS in breach of the BC1:2012. 7', 'This, it says, damaged its credit and reputation and caused it to lose sales of the Product. 8', '6\\u2003To provide context to CS\u2019s claim, I set out an overview of the relevant segment of the steel column market in Singapore and the industry standards relevant to the dispute. The present proceedings concern \u201cH beams\u201d. The vertical members of the H beam are known as flanges, while the horizontal member that connects the two flanges is known as the web. 9', '7\\u2003Various grades of H steel beams are marketed in Singapore. These steel columns may be used for purposes such as property development or the construction of fixed offshore structures (eg, oil rigs and service platforms). 10', 'Two such grades of steel columns are S460M and S355. Both CS and the defendants supply S460M and S355 steel columns in Singapore. CS has been supplying S460M steel (ie, the Product when used in accordance with lower design strengths) since 2014. 11', 'The defendants anticipated being ready to release their new product, the \u201cNippon Product\u201d into the market in December 2017. 12', 'The defendants were not supplying the Nippon Product when the acts of alleged defamation and\/or malicious falsehood first started in October 2017 (see [18] and [130] below). CS alleges that only the defendants and itself supply S460M steel columns in Singapore. 13', 'They are therefore competitors in this range of steel columns.', '8\\u2003S460M steel is of a higher quality than S355. 14', 'To appreciate this, an understanding is needed of the inverse relationship between the flange thickness of a steel column and its strength properties. As the defendants\u2019 expert, Professor Ting Seng Kiong (\u201cProf Ting\u201d) explained, all strength properties like tensile strength reduce as the steel section becomes thicker. 15', 'Tensile strength is the maximum stress a material can endure before fracturing. 16', 'As a result, the thicker the section, the lower its design strength value. 17', 'The design strength value is the pressure that a steel column may be intended to withstand in the design of the project. 18', 'Design strength is expressed in megapascals (\u201cMPa\u201d) and the design strength for different grades of steel columns is set out in various industry guides. Prof Ting clarified that if the design strength of a steel column is reduced, this is done to \u201cpreserve safety levels\u201d of the eventual construct. 19', '9\\u2003Returning now to S460M and S355 steel, the former is of a \u201chigher quality\u201d than the latter because for a given flange thickness, S460M steel has a higher design strength value. 20', '10\\u2003A suite of industry standards governs the design strength of steel columns used in projects in Singapore. From 1 April 2013, the \u201cStructural Eurocodes\u201d were implemented in Singapore. The Eurocodes are a set of European Standards (abbreviated \u201cEN\u201d) for the design of buildings and other civil engineering works and construction products. 21', 'CS alleges that after a two-year transition period wherein the Structural Eurocodes applied alongside the British and Singaporean design standards, from 1 April 2015 onwards, the British design standards no longer apply in Singapore. 22', \"11\\u2003The main Eurocode containing the rules for the use of structural steel in the design of buildings and civil engineering works is EN 1993-1-1: 2005 'Eurocode 3: Design of Steel structures - Part 1-1 : General Rules and Rules for Buildings\u2019 (\u201cEurocode 3\u201d). Other Eurocodes like \u201cEurocode 2\u201d relate to the design of concrete structures while \u201cEurocode 5\u201d relates to the design of timber structures. 23\", 'Singapore\u2019s implementation of the Eurocode 3, \u201cSS EN 1993-1-1:2010\u201d is identical to the Eurocode 3 itself. 24', 'The Eurocode 3 is significant for two reasons. First, CS claims that the Eurocode 3 recognises that if a \u201cEuropean Technical Approval\u201d (\u201cETA\u201d) is granted in respect of a construction product, that product is in full compliance with the Eurocode 3. 25', 'An ETA is a favourable technical assessment of the product\u2019s fitness for an intended use. 26', 'It is usually given for innovative products that are too early in their life to be covered by a harmonised European standard. 27', 'Second, the Eurocode 3 sets out the design strength of various steel columns with different thicknesses. 28', '12\\u2003On 1 April 2013, the BCA also issued the BC1:2012. This was a revision of an initial version of the same guide introduced in 2008. In 2008, Singapore was still adopting British standards instead of the Eurocodes. The BC1:2012 comes along with a handbook: \u201cHandbook to BC1:2012, Use of Alternative Structural Steel to BS 5950 and Eurocode 3\u201d (\u201cthe Handbook\u201d). 29', 'Part of CS\u2019s case is that the BC1:2012 only applies to \u201calternative steel materials\u201d, ie, steels that are not covered and compliant with British or European standards. 30', '13\\u2003In or around 2014, CS introduced the Product to the Singapore market. 31', 'CS describes the Product as a \u201chigh-strength jumbo column\u201d, which is also a H-column, with the design name \u201cHISTAR 460\u201d. 32', 'The Product is manufactured by ArcelorMittal Belval&Differdange (\u201cAM\u201d), a Luxembourg company. AM and CS entered into a distribution agreement on 27 September 2017 for CS to supply the Product within Singapore on an exclusive basis. This was superseded by a revised version dated 1 January 2018 (\u201cthe Distribution Agreement\u201d). 33', 'Under the Distribution Agreement, CS agreed to purchase a minimum of 6,000 metric tonnes (\u201cmt\u201d) of beams and sections in the Superior and S460M steel grades each year for distribution in Singapore. 34', '14\\u2003CS claims that the Product has dual-specifications, in that it meets the specifications of both the S460M grade and Superior grade. 35', 'Mr Sim Thiam Chye Eric (\u201cMr Sim\u201d), the Deputy Head of Sales from CS, explained that the Product would meet the design standards of S460M steel in the European Standard EN 10025-2004 \u201cHot rolled products of structural steels\u201d (\u201cEN 10025-4:2004\u201d). However, the Product can also enjoy a higher design strength available to the Superior steel grade due to the issuance of ETA 10-0156 (\u201cthe Issued ETA\u201d). Under the Issued ETA, the Product has an enhanced design strength of 460 MPa for up to a flange thickness of 100mm, as compared to the design strength of S460M steel which is only 400MPa at 100mm. I shall refer to this enhanced design strength as the \u201cCatalogue Design Strength\u201d of the Product. 36', 'CS argues that Eurocode 3-1.1.1(3) allows for the use of ETAs and Eurocode 3-2.3.2 adds that the material properties for design are specified in the ETAs. 37', 'In this context, CS claims that if the Product is used as HISTAR 460 (ie, the Superior steel grade), it is even stronger than S355 and S 460M steel. 38', '15\\u2003The practical benefits of using the Product as the Superior grade of steel were explained by Mr Simon Koh (\u201cMr Koh\u201d), CS\u2019s Head of Sales. Mr Koh testified that since the Product is stronger than the S355 and S460M grades of steel, smaller sizes of the Product are required to meet the load-bearing capacities of columns. These weight savings translate to cost savings through reductions in the amount of materials used and time expended on welding. 39', '16\\u2003Accordingly, CS claims that since the Superior grade is covered by the Issued ETA and also complies with the design standards of S460M steel in EN 10025-4:2004, the defendants\u2019 representation in the Alleged Defamatory Material that the Product must comply with the BC1:2012 Guide is false. 40', 'CS argues that the BC1:2012 itself does not permit the use of ETAs and that reference to an ETA is only permitted under the Eurocodes. 41', '17\\u2003CS expected strong sales of the Product. 42', 'However, CS now complains that the annual total tonnage of the Product sold between 2016 and 2018 fell below the minimum 6,000mt under the Distribution Agreement. 43', 'CS\u2019s evidence is that from 2016 to 2019, it only sold a further 3,200mt of the Product in total across three projects in Singapore. 44', '18\\u2003According to CS, the defendants wanted to develop their own S460M steel product but knew that this would take years. The impetus for the defendants\u2019 development efforts was Mr Murahashi\u2019s prediction of growth in demand for S460M H-columns in Singapore in the years following the release of the BC1:2012. 45', 'From about 2013 onwards, Mr Murahashi, employed by Nippon Steel Singapore, took it upon himself to persuade Nippon Steel Japan to manufacture a steel column to rival the Product. 46', 'CS alleges that before the defendants could bring a rival product to market, both defendants disseminated the Alleged Defamatory Material to nip CS\u2019s competitive advantage in the bud. 47', '19\\u2003On a few occasions in 2013, Mr Murahashi met with one Professor Chiew Sing-Ping (\u201cProf Chiew\u201d), an author of the BC1:2012, to understand the local conditions better. 48', 'It is unclear if Prof Chiew was the only author of the BC1:2012, 49', 'as he referred to himself as the \u201cPrincipal Consultant\u201d engaged by the BCA to develop the BC1:2012. 50', 'I therefore refer to him as an author of the BC1:2012. During one such meeting with Prof Chiew, Mr Murahashi claims that Prof Chiew explained that even if S460M steel was manufactured to British and European standards, it was a Class 1 steel under the BC1:2012 and the default design parameters for S460M therein had to be complied with. According to Mr Murahashi, Prof Chiew\u2019s position is that even if the Catalogue Design Strength of the Superior steel grade provides for a greater design strength as compared to S460M steel, once the Product is deployed in a Singapore construction project, the default design parameters for S460M apply. 51', 'However, Prof Chiew was not called as a witness by any party to this action.', '20\\u2003After these meetings with Prof Chiew, Mr Murahashi commenced work on an internal presentation paper sometime in 2013 to propose the manufacturing and marketing of a S460M product by Nippon Steel (ie, the Nippon Product). Mr Murahashi believed that the Nippon Product would possess characteristics that were slightly different from the Product. 52', '21\\u2003By August 2014, Mr Murahashi completed the internal presentation paper and titled it \u201cReaction of the Market on High-strength H-column, HISTAR 460, by ArcelorMittal and the Prospect of Future Demand in Singapore\u201d (\u201c2014 Internal Paper\u201d). By an email dated 18 August 2014, he circulated the paper to his Heads of Department in Nippon Steel Japan, Mr Tetsuya Akahoshi and Mr Yasuo Muraoka. 53', 'Mr Murahashi admitted under cross-examination that the 2014 Internal Paper recommended the development of a product to compete with AM\u2019s Product in Singapore. 54', '22\\u2003CS\u2019s case is that the 2014 Internal Paper contained a variation of the Publication. I surmise that CS was troubled by the graph depicted below. On one view, the graph suggests that the Product\u2019s Catalogue Design Strength is superseded by lower design strengths in the BC1:2012 when the Product is used in Singapore: 55', '', '23\\u2003Mr Murahashi claims that he met with Prof Chiew and another acquaintance, Professor Richard Liew (\u201cProf Liew\u201d), in or around the last quarter of 2014 to discuss the main conclusions in his 2014 Internal Paper. Mr Murahashi claims that Prof Liew is, like Prof Chiew, a local expert on structural steel. 56', 'Mr Murahashi testifies that the two professors concurred with the main conclusions in the document. 57', 'However, like Prof Chiew, Prof Liew was not called as a witness in this action.', '24\\u2003In 2016, research and development work was still ongoing with regard to the proposed Nippon Product. 58', 'Mr Murahashi prepared another presentation which revised the 2014 Internal Paper. The revised paper is titled \u201cIncreasing Need for Grade-60 High-strength H-column Supplied by ArcelorMittal for Iconic Building Projects in Asian Countries\u201d and is dated 31 July 2016 (the \u201c2016 Internal Paper\u201d). Mr Murahashi\u2019s evidence is that the 2014 Internal Paper was focused on the Singapore market, whereas the 2016 Internal Paper predicted a growing demand for S460M H-columns in major construction projects in other parts of Asia as well. 59', '25\\u2003Mr Murahashi was concerned not to fall behind the competition. His intent behind the 2016 Internal Paper was to impress upon Nippon Steel Japan that it should expedite the process of being ready to supply the Nippon Product to potential customers in Asia. 60', 'The 2016 Internal Paper contained a variation of the Publication and was shared first with two members of Nippon Steel Japan\u2019s Ho Chi Minh City office and copied to Mr Masaya Higuchi (\u201cMr Higuchi\u201d). The latter was Mr Murahashi\u2019s colleague in Singapore, working in Nippon Steel Singapore\u2019s sales department. 61', '26\\u2003CS\u2019s case is that \u201csince in or about August 2014\u201d, 62', 'the defendants took steps to inform customers, using the Alleged Defamatory Material or some variation thereof, that the BC1:2012 applied to the Product and the Product could not be used in Singapore in accordance with its Catalogue Design Strength. 63', '27\\u2003CS claims that there are four versions of the Publication in the following documents: the 2014 Internal Paper, 2016 Internal Paper, a presentation dated 25 July 2017 (\u201cthe 2017 Presentation\u201d) and another internal report prepared by Mr Murahashi dated 11 December 2017 (\u201cthe 2017 Internal Report\u201d). 64', 'In contrast, the defendants contend that there is only one version of the Publication that originated from the 2014 Internal Paper and was modified in the 2016 Internal Paper. 65', 'However, even if CS is right about there being multiple versions of the Publication, CS does not allege that there is a substantive difference between them. I also do not think the question of whether there are indeed multiple versions of the Publication is material to the resolution of the dispute. I therefore say no more on this issue.', '28\\u2003In August 2017, Mr Murahashi reached out to Mr Hiroki Fukuda (\u201cMr Fukuda\u201d) of Kajima Overseas Asia Pte Ltd (\u201cKajima\u201d), the main contractor of the Integrated Intermediate Care Hub project (\u201cIICH Project\u201d). Mr Murahashi, Mr Higuchi and Mr Fukuda eventually met on 24 August 2017. Mr Murahashi wanted to find out about the structural steel requirements of the IICH Project. At this meeting, Mr Murahashi promoted the use of S460M steel and, in particular, the Nippon Product.', '29\\u2003In mid-September 2017, Mr Fukuda informed Mr Murahashi that Kajima was contemplating the use of S460M steel. However, he revealed that the final decision lay with Kajima\u2019s subcontractor overseeing structural steel works for the project, Kong Hwee Iron Works and Construction Pte Ltd (\u201cKong Hwee\u201d). Kong Hwee was slated to reach a decision in the first week of October 2017. 66', 'Mr Fukuda referred Mr Murahashi to Mr Kannan Natarajan (\u201cMr Kannan\u201d) from Kong Hwee. 67', '30\\u2003On 18 September 2017, Mr Murahashi and Mr Kannan met. According to Mr Murahashi, he promoted the Nippon Product to Mr Kannan at this meeting by explaining its design strength and properties. 68', 'At the end of the meeting, Mr Murahashi obtained from Mr Kannan a verbal promise not to disclose the details of their meeting to CS as he did not want CS to know that he had approached Kong Hwee about potentially supplying S460M steel for the IICH Project. 69', '31\\u2003In mid-October 2017, Kong Hwee decided to order the Product (rather than the Nippon Product) for the IICH Project. 70', 'Having learnt of this, Mr Murahashi asked to meet Mr Fukuda on 21 October 2017. 71', 'Mr Murahashi acknowledged in cross-examination that the point of meeting with Mr Fukuda was to convey that the Nippon Product was just as good as the Product because the latter could not be used in Singapore in accordance with its Catalogue Design Strength, and only S460M steel was certified under the BC1:2012. 72', '32\\u2003Subsequently, on 23 October 2017, Mr Fukuda sent Mr Murahashi a text message stating: \u201cRegarding lack of BCA\u2019s approval on HISTAR, if you have any BCA\u2019s circular etc., could you send it over? I would like to check it.\u201d 73', '33\\u2003Parties differ over the proper interpretation of Mr Fukuda\u2019s message. CS argues that the message reveals Mr Fukuda\u2019s impression, after his meeting with Mr Murahashi on 21 October 2017, that the BCA had not approved the use of the Product in Singapore. 74', 'In contrast, Mr Murahashi claims that Mr Fukuda was simply under the misapprehension that the BCA\u2019s approval was required before the Product could be used as the Superior grade of steel in the IICH Project. 75', 'This divergence between parties appears to go to the issue of whether the Alleged Defamatory Material conveyed to Mr Fukuda on 21 October 2017 bore a defamatory meaning.', '34\\u2003Mr Murahashi asked to meet Mr Fukuda on the same day to clarify matters. At this meeting at Kajima\u2019s site office at Jalan Tan Tock Seng, Mr Murahashi handed out two or three copies of the Publication to Mr Fukuda and two of his colleagues. 76', 'Mr Murahashi claims that the Publication is pages 2 and 3 of the 2016 Internal Paper. 77', 'Mr Murahashi then explained verbally that: (a) the BC1:2012 applied to all construction projects in Singapore and to all columns certified as S460M steel, including the Product and the Nippon Product; (b) the Product, even if used as the Superior steel grade, had to comply with the design strengths prescribed in the BC1:2012 (ie, it could not be used in accordance with its Catalogue Design Strength); and (c) in the graph in the Publication (\u201cthe Graph\u201d) (see below), the red line represented the Catalogue Design Strength of the Product as the Superior steel grade, the black line represented the default design strength values for S460M under the BC1:2012 and the yellow line the default design strength values for the Superior steel grade under the 2008 version of the BC1:2012. 78', 'These oral representations made to Mr Fukuda and his colleagues are \u201cthe Words\u201d referred to at [4] above.

He testified that he could have been shown the Publication in October 2017, December 2017 or at some other time. 82', 'The defendants accept that on the balance of probabilities, Mr Murahashi did share a copy of the Publication with Mr Kannan on 25 October 2017. 83', 'As to the Words, Mr Murahashi accepted that he had \u201cshared with Mr Kannan the same points [he] had shared with Fukuda-san on 23 October 2017\u201d [emphasis added]. 84', 'Although Mr Kannan could not recollect what had happened at the 25 October 2017 meeting, based on Mr Murahashi\u2019s affidavit and oral evidence, and given the unlikelihood of Mr Murahashi sharing the Publication with Mr Kannan without speaking the Words, I accept on the balance of probabilities that the Words were communicated to Mr Kannan.', '37\\u2003After meeting with Mr Murahashi, Mr Kannan called CS\u2019s Mr Sim to clarify doubts on the strength of the Product. Mr Kannan said that his doubts arose because of the Publication given by the defendants. 85', '38\\u2003Eventually, however, Kajima\u2019s order for the Product in the IICH Project was invoiced on 23 November 2017. 86', '39\\u2003The following sequence of events accounts for how Prof Chiew, one of the alleged publishees, came to know that CS was marketing the Product under the Catalogue Design Strength (see [134] below). After he met with Mr Fukuda and Mr Kannan, Mr Murahashi attended a seminar on 26 October 2017 (\u201cthe Seminar\u201d) during which AM\u2019s Mr Jean-Claude Gerardy (\u201cMr Gerardy\u201d) gave a presentation. Mr Gerardy stated that the Product was used in the Funan Mall redevelopment project (\u201cFunan Project\u201d) in accordance with its Catalogue Design Strength. 87', 'Mr Gerardy added that the BCA did not require the design parameters set out in the BC1:2012 to be followed because of the Issued ETA that the Product had obtained. 88', 'As Mr Murahashi conceded in cross-examination, if Mr Gerardy was right, then what was represented in the Alleged Defamatory Material communicated to Mr Kannan and Mr Fukuda is incorrect. 89', '40\\u2003Mr Murahashi disbelieved Mr Gerardy\u2019s account that the Product was used as the Superior steel grade in the Funan Project without objection from the BCA. 90', 'However, neither Mr Murahashi nor anyone else employed by the defendants clarified the accuracy of Mr Gerardy\u2019s account with the BCA. Instead, Mr Murahashi sought to verify Mr Gerardy\u2019s claims with Prof Chiew. He says he reached out to Prof Chiew via WhatsApp on the evening of 26 October 2017. 91', 'The two then met up in early November 2017 to speak about the Seminar. At the end of this meeting, Prof Chiew said he would make inquiries with his contacts at the BCA. 92', 'Mr Murahashi\u2019s account is that he followed up with Prof Chiew in December 2017 to check in on the latter\u2019s findings but Prof Chiew did not give him a clear answer.', '41\\u2003CS challenges the suggestion that Prof Chiew failed to respond clearly to Mr Murahashi. CS argues that Prof Chiew did receive confirmation from the BCA in late October 2017 that the Product had been used in the Funan Project in accordance with its Catalogue Design Strength. 93', 'In an email dated 5 April 2018 to Mr Murahashi, Prof Chiew stated: 94', '42\\u2003CS also highlights the evidence of its steel expert, Associate Professor Pang Sze Dai (\u201cProf Pang\u201d), that the Product has been used in the Jewel Changi Airport project (\u201cJewel Project\u201d), the DUO Singapore (a residences, offices, hotel and retail space in Bugis) project (\u201cDUO Project\u201d) and the Funan Project in accordance with its Catalogue Design Strength. 95', '43\\u2003Prof Pang relies on portions of AM\u2019s website stating that the Product was used in the Jewel Project and DUO Project. 96', 'However, Prof Pang admitted that he had not seen any \u201cstructural calculations or any other documents\u201d confirming this. 97', 'As for the Funan Project, Prof Pang referred to the construction drawing of the building. He observes that \u201c[i]n the Kingpost (steel column) Schedule, a distinction is made between S460 steel (which suffers from strength loss with larger thickness ...) and HISTAR 460 steel in the Grade column. If HISTAR 460 steel is designed and used as S460 steel, the grade of steel will most likely be listed as S460\u2026\u201d. He explains that the \u201cdeliberate distinction between S460 and HISTAR S460M by the consultant will imply that in all likelihood, HISTAR 460 is used in this project for members marked UC2 \u2013 UC5 according to its technical specifications in the ETA ...\u201d [emphasis added]. The relevant portion of the construction drawing is as follows:', 'Prof Pang was not cross-examined specifically on the construction drawing. However, Prof Pang was questioned on how he knew that the Product was used in the Funan Project in accordance with its Catalogue Design Strength. In response, Prof Pang testified that he inferred this from an email between the main contractor for the Funan Project, Woh Hup (Private) Limited (\u201cWoh Hup\u201d), and CS. According to Prof Pang, the email mentions that the Product was used without a reduction factor. 98', 'It is unclear to me what email Prof Pang was referring to or whether the construction drawing cited in his report was found within said email. However, CS submits that in addition to Prof Pang\u2019s report and testimony, WhatsApp messages between one Ms Cong Zheng Xia (\u201cMs Cong\u201d) from Woh Hup and Mr Koh in January 2018 confirm that the Product\u2019s Catalogue Design Strength was approved for the Funan Project. 99', 'In these messages, Ms Cong states that: \u201cNow BCA and Prof Chiew Sing Ping is commenting that we should follow BC1 \u2013 by using reduction factor as S460M\u201d; \u201cWe have finished Jewel, Funan also installed on site\u201d; and \u201cFunan - BCA approved almost one year and installed few months ago, we cannot strengthen it\u201d [emphasis added]. 100', 'I accept Prof Pang\u2019s explanation that, on the face of the construction drawing, the Product was used in the Funan Project under its Catalogue Design Strength. The construction drawing is corroborated by Ms Cong\u2019s messages to Mr Koh.', '44\\u2003It is also CS\u2019s case that Dr Chi Trung Tran (\u201cDr Tran\u201d) of the BCA accepted that the Product\u2019s Catalogue Design Strength could be used in the IICH Project because of the Issued ETA. According to Mr Koh, Dr Tran was the Deputy Director (Innovative Materials and Solutions) of the BCA and the Principal Engineer for the Bridges and Structural Steel department at the material time. 101', 'The BCA indeed does not appear to have objected to the use of the Product\u2019s Catalogue Design Strength, at least, until late 2017. That is when Mr Murahashi caused Prof Chiew to begin inquiring with the BCA as to whether the BC1:2012 should lead to a reduction in the Product\u2019s design strengths (see [40]\u2013[41]).', '45\\u2003To re-capitulate, in October 2017, Kong Hwee had agreed to use the Product in the IICH Project. 102', 'However, in or before November 2017, Meinhardt Group (\u201cMeinhardt\u201d), who appears to be the Qualified Person (\u201cQP\u201d) for the IICH Project, 103', 'was approached by Dr Tran to discuss the use of the Product. A QP is an architect or a professional engineer appointed to prepare the plans of any building works: ss 2(1) and 9(1) Building Control Act 1989. Among other things, the QP should ensure that the design and execution of his\/her projects are in accordance with the BCA\u2019s requirements: see the Handbook at p i; s 9 of the Building Control Act 1989. CS highlights that after Mr Koh informed Dr Tran that the Product was covered by the Issued ETA, Dr Tran told Mr Koh that \u201cThe Histar 460 has ETA hence it is okay. We don\u2019t need to meet tomorrow\u201d. I reproduce the relevant portion of Mr Koh\u2019s WhatsApp messages with Dr Tran on 1 November 2017: 104', '46\\u2003Based on the foregoing, CS argues that Dr Tran accepted that the Product was not subject to the BC1:2012. The defendants challenge this by pointing to Dr Tran\u2019s follow-up email on 19 December 2017 to Meinhardt. In this email, Dr Tran informed Meinhardt that as the QP, it needed to conduct tests on the Product if the Product was to be used in the IICH Project in accordance with its Catalogue Design Strength. 105', 'The defendants argue that this shows that the BCA took the view that the Product had to adhere to the BC1:2012. CS counters by pointing to Mr Koh\u2019s evidence that: (a) the strength reduction \u201cactually comes from the EN standards\u201d (and not the BC1:2012); 106', 'and Dr Tran later called Mr Koh in late March 2018 to say that the Product was not subject to the BC1:2012. 107', 'Mr Koh alleges that Mr Ronnie Lim, CS\u2019s general manager, and Mr Sim were with him when he took the call. 108', '47\\u2003CS also alleges that Mr Murahashi disseminated the Alleged Defamatory Material in October 2017 on a business trip to Vietnam. During that trip, Mr Murahashi and a representative from Okaya, a broker or trading house in Vietnam that worked with the defendants but is not part of the defendants\u2019 group of companies, went to visit Coteccons (a contractor) and Arup (a structural design consultant). 109', 'Mr Murahashi claims that at this meeting he shared information about the Nippon Product. CS argues that in doing so he referred to the 2016 Internal Paper and the 2017 Presentation. 110', 'The next day, he emailed a copy of both documents to two representatives of Okaya. 111', '48\\u2003CS doubts that Mr Murahashi attended the meeting to share information about the Nippon Product. Presumably, CS insinuates that the purpose of the meeting in Vietnam was instead to disparage the Product and\/or CS. CS points to the documents referenced at the meeting \u2013 the 2016 Internal Paper and the 2017 Presentation \u2013 and highlights that the Nippon Product is nowhere mentioned therein and that instead the documents are replete with references to \u201cHISTAR 460\u201d. 112', '49\\u2003The defendants argue that Mr Murahashi did not share the Publication with anyone other than Mr Fukuda of Kajima and Mr Kannan of Kong Hwee. 113', 'For the following reasons, CS invites me to infer a wider dissemination of the Alleged Defamatory Material.', '50\\u2003First, CS argues that the Alleged Defamatory Material was disseminated to more of the defendants\u2019 customers based on a statement made in the 2017 Internal Report prepared by Mr Murahashi. Mr Murahashi prepared this report for Mr Yoichi Furuta (\u201cMr Furuta\u201d) to summarise the discussion that the two had on 8 December 2017 when Mr Furuta confronted Mr Murahashi about the Publication (see [58]\u2013[59] below). Mr Furuta was the managing director of Nippon Steel Singapore at the material time. Under the heading \u201cNSSMC reaction\u201d, the report states: 114', '51\\u2003CS argues that the excerpt above reveals that in response to the Product entering the market in Singapore, the defendants took steps from 2016 to inform customers, using the Publication (or some variation thereof) that the BC1:2012 Guide applied to the Product, and that the Product could not be used in Singapore in accordance with its Catalogue Design Strength. 115', '52\\u2003Second, CS argues that apart from Mr Murahashi, other employees of the defendants had copies of the Publication and there is a \u201cvery real possibility\u201d that they could have shared it with other customers or external parties. As to the identity of these other employees, Mr Murahashi testified that there were two other colleagues in the Technical Services department in Singapore who worked with him to promote the Nippon Product and they sometimes exchanged information. 116', 'CS also relies on the fact that Murahashi \u201cworked with other employees in the Defendants\u2019 sales department\u201d, such as Mr Higuchi, to promote the Nippon Product. 117', '53\\u2003Third, CS highlights that Mr Murahashi shared variations of the Publication (in the 2016 Internal Paper and 2017 Presentation) with Okaya in Vietnam. Mr Murahashi admits that Okaya is an external party vis-\u00e0-vis the defendants. 118', 'CS further argues that the fact that AM received a copy of the Publication from a third party whose identity is not adduced in evidence shows that \u201cbad words\u201d spread in the industry. 119', '54\\u2003CS discovered the Publication when Mr Sim met Mr Kannan at Kong Hwee\u2019s premises on or about 27 December 2017. 120', 'To Mr Sim\u2019s recollection, he met Mr Kannan to discuss further opportunities for the use of the Product. By this time, Kong Hwee had agreed to use the Product in the IICH Project (see [31] above).', '55\\u2003Mr Sim testified that at this meeting Mr Kannan showed him the Publication of his own accord. 121', 'Mr Sim claims he was \u201cdumbfounded\u201d when he saw the Publication because it incorrectly suggests that the Product is subject to the BC1:2012. 122', '56\\u2003Following Mr Sim\u2019s discovery, several of CS\u2019s representatives met with Mr Derrick Goh, AM\u2019s sales manager, to discuss the Publication and how to address its circulation. It was agreed that AM would engage the defendants, while CS would engage the BCA to address the correctness of the Publication. 123', '57\\u2003However, it was also discovered that AM had earlier received a copy of the Publication and suspected that Mr Murahashi was behind its dissemination. 124', 'No evidence was led as to how AM came into possession of this information or the identity of the person who disclosed such information to AM. Further, sometime in early December 2017, AM\u2019s Mr Bradley Davey (\u201cMr Davey\u201d) had reached out to the defendants\u2019 Mr Takashi Yatsunami (\u201cMr Yatsunami\u201d) regarding the Publication. Mr Davey forwarded the Publication or a version of it and the Issued ETA to Mr Yatsunami. 125', 'At the material time, Mr Yatsunami was the President and Chief Executive Officer of Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal USA Inc (as it was known then). 126', 'Sometime in or around December 2017, Mr Yatsunami brought the Publication to Mr Furuta\u2019s attention and informed the latter that Mr Murahashi had allegedly circulated the document. 127', '58\\u2003On 8 December 2017, Mr Furuta met with Mr Murahashi to better understand the situation. Mr Murahashi was apprised of AM\u2019s accusation that: (a) the Publication suggests that the Product supplied in Singapore is of an inferior quality to that supplied in Europe; and (b) he is responsible for circulating the Publication. 128', 'Mr Murahashi then offered his side of the story to Mr Furuta. Among other things, Mr Murahashi told Mr Furuta that: (a) he did not intend to suggest that the Product supplied in Singapore was inferior to that supplied in Europe; (b) under the BC1:2012, the Product was subject to the default design strengths for S460M steel; and (c) an author of the BC1:2012 (ie, Prof Chiew) informed him that Mr Gerardy was wrong to suggest that the Product could be used in accordance with its Catalogue Design Strength in Singapore. 129', '59\\u2003At the end of the meeting, Mr Furuta instructed Mr Murahashi to prepare a report setting out what the latter had shared with him. 130', 'This report is the 2017 Internal Report.', '60\\u2003The 2017 Internal Report reveals that the defendants anticipated being ready to \u201cstart manufacturing and supplying [the Nippon Product] from December 2017\u201d. 131', 'This contradicts Mr Murahashi\u2019s evidence that the defendants were ready to supply the Nippon Product in July 2017. 132', 'Further, the report shows that the defendants\u2019 projected timeline for another new product, which would equal the strength of the Product, was even longer. 133', 'The report stated that the latter product would likely be manufactured and supplied \u201csometime in the second half of 2021\u201d. 134', '61\\u2003After Mr Furuta reviewed the 2017 Internal Report together with Mr Yatsunami, an email exchange between various representatives of the defendants and AM ensued.', '62\\u2003I highlight only the salient email messages. First, Mr Yatsunami\u2019s 20 December 2017 email states that the defendants would check with the BCA on \u201cthis design standard issue\u201d. CS argues that the defendants never followed up with the BCA. 135', '63\\u2003Second, Mr Furuta sent a letter to AM on 23 January 2018 (\u201cthe 23 Jan Letter\u201d). The 23 Jan Letter, among other things, explained how the defendants used the Publication in their interactions with customers. In particular, the 23 Jan Letter stated that: 136', 'The 23 Jan Letter also contained an offer by the defendants to issue a written clarification which could be shown to all of the defendants\u2019 customers. The written clarification would include a statement that the parties were seeking clarification with the BCA on the matter and that the defendants were not suggesting that the \u201cHISTAR 460 H-columns\u201d AM sold in Singapore were inferior to those AM sold in Europe. 137', '64\\u2003In response to the 23 Jan Letter, AM called for a meeting between the defendants and Mr Gerardy. This meeting took place on 2 February 2018, at which Mr Gerardy explained why the BC1:2012 did not apply to the Product. 138', '65\\u2003Mr Furuta claims that he had no reason to disbelieve what Mr Gerardy said and that he agreed to work with Mr Gerardy\u2019s team to prepare a written clarification. That clarification letter is dated 9 February 2018 (\u201c9 Feb Letter\u201d). 139', 'Mr Furuta testified that the letter was handed to AM and it was for AM to decide how it wished to deploy the letter. 140', 'The 9 Feb Letter stated, among other things, that: 141', '66\\u2003Now, Mr Furuta testifies that the 9 Feb Letter was issued just to \u201cplacate\u201d AM. Mr Furuta says that when the letter was released, the defendants were still confused and proposed to go to the BCA together with AM to clarify the applicability of the BC1:2012. 142', '67\\u2003CS claims that even after the 9 Feb Letter was released, AM and CS continued to receive queries about the suitability of the use of the Product in Singapore. Mr Sim\u2019s evidence is that on or around 3 May 2018, Kajima\u2019s Mr Koji Aihara (\u201cMr Aihara\u201d) informed him that Kajima wished to use the Product in Singapore. However, because of what the defendants had said, Mr Aihara was afraid of having the proposal rejected by the BCA for non-compliance with regulatory standards. 143', 'CS then decided to take action against the defendants.'"}

He described the Supervisor as a homewrecker and warned people to be aware of him. He also included other images in the post, including photographs of the Supervisor and the images of text conversations between V1 and the Supervisor. We refer to this as \u201cthe First Facebook Post\u201d.', '7\\u2003After the First Facebook Post was published, both V1 and the Supervisor were separately told about it by their friends. The First Facebook Post also went \u201cviral\u201d. When GED accessed his Facebook account at around 4.00pm that day, it had attracted about 1,000 comments and 3,000 \u201clikes\u201d, and it had been shared about 2,000 times by other Facebook users. Upon seeing this, GED decided to remove the First Facebook Post as he had not expected it to receive so much attention. However, because he wanted to draw the attention of the public to what the Supervisor had done, GED decided to publish a new post on his Facebook account containing an edited version of the Image, in which V1\u2019s face was blurred but her breasts and the Supervisor\u2019s face were fully visible (\u201cthe Second Facebook Post\u201d). The Second Facebook Post was removed one day later.', '8\\u2003On 21 September 2021, GED pleaded guilty to two charges:', '(a)\\u2003one charge of theft in dwelling under s 380 of the Penal Code, by taking V1\u2019s mobile phone without her permission on 6 February 2020 (DAC-904515-2021) (\u201cthe Theft Offence\u201d); and', '(b)\\u2003one charge of distributing an intimate image under s 377BE(1) and punishable under s 377BE(3) of the Penal Code, by publishing the First Facebook Post (containing the Image with V1\u2019s face visible) on 12 February 2020 (DAC-904516-2021).', '9\\u2003GED consented to two other charges being taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing:', '(a)\\u2003one charge of possession of intimate images and recordings under s 377BD(1)(b) and punishable under s 377BD(2) of the Penal Code, by taking pictures and videos of V1\u2019s intimate images and videos without her permission on 6 February 2020; and', '(b)\\u2003one charge of distributing an intimate image under s 377BE(1) and punishable under s 377BE(3) of the Penal Code, by publishing the Second Facebook Post (containing the edited Image with V1\u2019s face blurred) later on 12 February 2020.', '10\\u2003On 3 December 2021, the District Judge (\u201cthe DJ\u201d) sentenced GED to 12 weeks\u2019 imprisonment for his Actual Distribution Offence and one week\u2019s imprisonment for the Theft Offence, to run consecutively, such that the aggregate sentence was 13 weeks\u2019 imprisonment: see Public Prosecutor v GED [2022] SGDC 6 (\u201cthe 9280 GD\u201d).', '11\\u2003With regard to the Actual Distribution Offence, the DJ observed that general deterrence had to feature as a dominant sentencing consideration, given the context in which s 377BE was enacted. Further, a retributive element could also be relevant where serious harm was caused to the victim (see the 9280 GD at [32]). The DJ accepted that the offence-specific and offender-specific factors that the Prosecution had proposed in Public Prosecutor v Shahrul Nizam Bin Kharuddin [2021] SGDC 67 (\u201cShahrul Nizam\u201d) were relevant to sentencing, alongside several other sentencing factors. These factors \u201chad to be weighed and balanced to arrive at a properly calibrated sentence on the facts of each case\u201d (see the 9280 GD at [33]\u2013[35]). The DJ noted that more harm was caused in the present case than in Shahrul Nizam because the Image was distributed to a large number of users on Facebook, but held that it was not so much more egregious that it warranted a sentence of 18 months\u2019 imprisonment, which the Prosecution sought and which was more than seven times the sentence of ten weeks\u2019 imprisonment imposed in Shahrul Nizam. The DJ then considered five unreported cases where offenders had been sentenced under s 377BE(1), and where the imprisonment terms had ranged from five weeks to 27 weeks. Although he accepted that unreported cases had \u201clittle or no precedential value\u201d, he found them helpful for \u201ccomparative purposes\u201d in \u201cderiving a broad sensing of what an appropriate sentencing range in the present case might be\u201d, in the absence of any reported decisions on s 377BE(1) or any authoritative sentencing guidelines. The DJ concluded in the circumstances that the present case was not so much more egregious than these five cases as to warrant the much higher sentence sought by the Prosecution, which seemed manifestly excessive (see the 9280 GD at [38]\u2013[46]).', '12\\u2003The DJ went on to consider the relevant sentencing factors, beginning with four aspects of this case which increased GED\u2019s culpability and the potential harm to V1: (a) that the Image itself was highly intrusive; (b) that V1\u2019s face was fully visible in the Image and she was easily identifiable; (c) that the Image was distributed to a large number of people; and (d) that GED re-posted the Image with V1\u2019s face blurred in the Second Facebook Post, which was only taken down a day later. However, the DJ rejected the Prosecution\u2019s submission that the court should also have regard to the harm caused to the Supervisor, noting that there was no charge under s 377BE(1) against GED in relation to the Supervisor. The DJ also found that the Prosecution\u2019s submission that GED had acted out of malice, and had intended to cause maximum humiliation to V1, was not borne out by the evidence (see the 9280 GD at [48]\u2013[50]).', '13\\u2003In GED\u2019s favour, the DJ accepted that he was a person who was otherwise of good character. He had no antecedents and his offences were a one-off aberration committed under very acute circumstances when he was in despair over V1\u2019s infidelity. His offences therefore did not call for specific deterrence. The DJ also took into account: (a) GED\u2019s early plea of guilt; (b) the fact that his motivation in posting the Image was not to spite V1 or extort any concession from her, and he did not seek to cause her maximum humiliation; (c) that what was distributed was an image and not a video recording; and (iv) that the present offence did not involve a breach of trust by GED (see the 9280 GD at [51]).', '14\\u2003Weighing the various offence- and offender-specific factors, and comparing the sentences imposed in past cases, the DJ concluded that an appropriate sentence for GED\u2019s Actual Distribution Offence in this case was 12 weeks\u2019 imprisonment (see the 9280 GD at [54]). On 8 December 2021, the Prosecution appealed against this sentence. No cross-appeal was filed by GED.', '15\\u2003The offender in MA 9008 (\u201cGEH\u201d) was 38 years old at the material time. He and his wife (\u201cB\u201d) were undergoing divorce proceedings at the time of the offence. GEH suspected that B was having an extramarital affair.', '16\\u2003On 7 February 2020 at approximately 10.00pm, GEH and three other persons (whom we refer to as \u201cC\u201d, \u201cD\u201d and \u201cE\u201d) went to B\u2019s home and followed her when she left her home and boarded a car driven by the victim (\u201cV2\u201d). Suspecting that B and V2 were in a relationship, GEH, C, D and E followed V2\u2019s car in their respective vehicles. GEH and E then coordinated a driving manoeuvre to trap V2\u2019s car. They then alighted from their vehicles to confront V2. V2 did not initially want to step out of his car but he eventually complied after GEH kicked the side mirror of his car and shouted at him. The parties then proceeded to a grass patch by the side of the road.', '17\\u2003There, GEH and E (later joined by D) attacked V2 for about half an hour, including by punching and kicking his face and body numerous times while E pinned V2 to the ground in a chokehold. As a result of the attack, V2 suffered the following injuries: a facial contusion, a right floor of orbit fracture, a right maxillary hemoantrum, a right periorbital hematoma, a right clavicle fracture and a minor head injury.', '18\\u2003While the attack was ongoing, GEH, D and E decided to humiliate V2 further by pulling down his pants and underwear to expose his genitals, hurting him further when he attempted to resist. GEH then used V2\u2019s mobile phone without his consent to take a 55-second-long video recording both V2\u2019s injured face and exposed penis at length while insulting him verbally (\u201cthe Video\u201d). At this point, on D\u2019s suggestion, GEH sent the Video to more than 500 of V2\u2019s contacts by WhatsApp. The recipients included V2\u2019s colleagues, friends, neighbours and sporting teammates. This was designed to humiliate him. GEH also sent a copy of the Video to E. There is also video evidence, which GEH does not challenge, of GEH sending a follow-up voice message using V2\u2019s phone stating \u201cPlease forward to all people! Right? Forward to all everyone!\u201d (\u201cthe Follow-up Message\u201d).', '19\\u2003The police received a call alerting them to the situation at about 11.21pm that night, and they subsequently arrived on the scene. Even upon being told by the police officers to calm down and to stop behaving in a rowdy fashion, GEH, D and E continued to conduct themselves in a disorderly manner by shouting derogatory insults at B and singing \u201chappy birthday\u201d loudly to mock her, while standing along a public road. They only stopped shouting at B when they were placed under arrest.', '20\\u2003On 18 October 2021, GEH pleaded guilty to three charges:', '(a)\\u2003one charge of voluntarily causing grievous hurt with common intention under s 325 read with s 34 of the Penal Code, by punching and kicking V2\u2019s face and body multiple times, together with D and E (DAC-913702-2020) (\u201cthe VCGH Offence\u201d);', '(b)\\u2003one charge of distributing an intimate recording under s 377BE(1) and punishable under s 377BE(3) of the Penal Code, by sending the Video of V2 to E and more than 500 of V2\u2019s contacts by WhatsApp (DAC-913704-2020); and', '(c)\\u2003one charge of disorderly conduct on a public road with common intention under s 20 of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act (Cap 184, 1997 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe MOA\u201d) read with s 34 of the Penal Code, by shouting and using insulting language despite having been told to stop behaving in a rowdy manner by police officers (together with D and E) (MAC-905573-2020) (\u201cthe MOA Offence\u201d).', '21\\u2003GEH consented to three other charges being taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing:', '(a)\\u2003one charge of criminal intimidation with common intention under s 506 read with s 34 of the Penal Code, by threatening to circulate videos online of V2 being beaten and stripped unless he admitted that he was a party to an extramarital affair;', '(b)\\u2003 one charge of insulting B\u2019s modesty under s 377BA of the Penal Code, by shouting vulgarities relating to B\u2019s genitals; and', '(c)\\u2003one charge of insulting modesty with common intention under s 377BA read with s 34 of the Penal Code, by taking videos of V2\u2019s exposed penis without his consent (together with D and E).', '22\\u2003On 13 January 2022, the Principal District Judge (\u201cthe PDJ\u201d) sentenced GEH to 18 months\u2019 imprisonment for his Actual Distribution Offence, 18 months\u2019 imprisonment and four strokes of the cane for his VCGH Offence, and a fine of $1,500 (in default, six days\u2019 imprisonment) for his MOA Offence. The imprisonment terms were ordered to run consecutively, such that the aggregate sentence was 36 months\u2019 imprisonment, four strokes of the cane and a fine of $1,500 (in default, six days\u2019 imprisonment): see Public Prosecutor v GEH [2022] SGDC 25 (\u201cthe 9008 GD\u201d).', '23\\u2003In relation to GEH\u2019s Actual Distribution Offence, the PDJ reasoned as follows:', '(a)\\u2003As both parties agreed that the offence-specific and offender-specific factors set out in Shahrul Nizam were a useful guide, the PDJ proceeded on this basis (see the 9008 GD at [98]\u2013[99]). The PDJ rejected GEH\u2019s submission that s 377BE was enacted mainly to tackle \u201crevenge pornography\u201d as this was \u201cnothing more than a convenient label pertaining to a certain fact situation and [did] not necessarily cover the whole spectrum of offences contemplated under [s] 377BE(1)\u201d. The PDJ also rejected GEH\u2019s submission that a video of the victim engaged in sexual activity fully nude would always rank worse, in terms of harm, than a video of the victim partially nude as in the present case. Having regard to the offence-specific factors, the PDJ identified 21 months\u2019 imprisonment as the starting point (see the 9008 GD at [106]\u2013[109]).', '(b)\\u2003As for the offender-specific factors, the PDJ regarded the two related charges against GEH that were taken into consideration as an aggravating factor. However, the PDJ viewed GEH\u2019s plea of guilt, letter of apology and offer of compensation to V2 as mitigating factors (see the 9008 GD at [110]\u2013[111]).', '(c)\\u2003The PDJ rejected the Prosecution\u2019s submission that caning should be imposed for GEH\u2019s Actual Distribution Offence on the basis that the facts disclosed an offence under s 354A of the Penal Code (which attracted mandatory caning). The PDJ noted that GEH had not been charged with any offence under s 354A. In any event, as four strokes of the cane had been imposed for GEH\u2019s VCGH Offence (as to which see [24] below), the PDJ did not see the need to impose a further sentence of caning for GEH\u2019s Actual Distribution Offence (see the 9008 GD at [113]).', '24\\u2003For GEH\u2019s VCGH Offence, the PDJ applied the two-step sentencing framework set out by the Court of Appeal in Public Prosecutor v BDB [2018] 1 SLR 127 (\u201cBDB\u201d and \u201cthe BDB Framework\u201d). First, having regard to the seriousness of the injuries suffered by V2 and the sentencing precedents, the PDJ identified 15 months\u2019 imprisonment as the indicative starting point (see the 9008 GD at [74]\u2013[90]). After taking into account the relevant aggravating and mitigating factors, the PDJ held that an uplift of three months\u2019 imprisonment was appropriate (see the 9008 GD at [91]\u2013[94]). The PDJ did not think there were any exceptional circumstances warranting a departure from the starting point of caning for GEH\u2019s VCGH Offence and held that four strokes of the cane would be appropriate (see the 9008 GD at [97]).', '25\\u2003Finally, for GEH\u2019s MOA Offence, the PDJ noted that it had been held in Public Prosecutor v Gao Zhengkun [2019] SGDC 241 (\u201cGao Zhengkun\u201d) that the usual sentencing tariff for such offences was a fine. The PDJ was of the view that there was no reason to depart from the starting point of a fine, and that a fine of $1,500 (in default, six days\u2019 imprisonment) was appropriate in the circumstances (see the 9008 GD at [114]\u2013[117]).', '26\\u2003On 13 and 14 January 2022 respectively, GEH and the Prosecution filed cross-appeals against the PDJ\u2019s decision. GEH\u2019s appeal relates to the sentences imposed for his Actual Distribution Offence, VCGH Offence and MOA Offence, while the Prosecution\u2019s appeal relates only to GEH\u2019s Actual Distribution Offence and VCGH Offence.', '27\\u2003On 9 March 2022, the Prosecution requested that MA 9008 be heard together with MA 9280 as similar issues would be canvassed in both Magistrate\u2019s Appeals. In view of the overlap in the issues to be decided and the novel legal questions raised, the court directed that MA 9280 and MA 9008 be heard together before a three-Judge coram pursuant to s 386(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 (2020 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe CPC\u201d).

In particular, they were unable to identify any consideration received by Kyen for each of the Third Party Transactions. 15', 'They also say that they were unable to find evidence that these transactions were in discharge of any genuine pre-existing debt owned by Kyen to the respective third parties. They further allege that Feima knew of and\/or had a pre-existing relationship with Infinite Future Limited (\u201cIFL\u201d), to which Kyen had paid USD 18,785,000.

Feima is not claiming for this amount because the Deed of Assignment remains in force, and Feima accepts that this would remain the case until it has been set aside by a court.

The Company was incorporated by Wavoo and the plaintiff as equal shareholders and founding directors on 2 March 2012. Wavoo disputes this characterisation of the plaintiff being a co-founder and says that he is the \u201cactual founder\u201d. However, nothing in the present application turns on this characterisation.', '4\\u2003Regardless of whether he can be characterised as a \u201cco-founder\u201d, the plaintiff was appointed as a director of the Company since its incorporation. However, the plaintiff was removed as a director pursuant to a member\u2019s resolution at the Annual General Meeting (\u201cAGM\u201d) on 23 August 2021. Since 12 April 2021, the plaintiff has been a majority shareholder of the Company. He holds 9,600 of the 20,000 ordinary shares in the Company, or approximately 48% of the shares.', '5\\u2003In turn, Wavoo was appointed as a director of the Company since its incorporation. He remains a director to date. Wavoo is a minority shareholder of the Company with approximately 44% of the shares (8,840 of the 20,000 ordinary shares). Latiff was appointed as a director of the Company on 1 August 2019. This was pursuant to a director\u2019s resolution signed by the plaintiff and Wavoo. Latiff is also a minority shareholder of the Company with approximately 8% of the shares (1,560 of the 20,000 ordinary shares). Wavoo and Latiff are married to each other.', '6\\u2003On 3 August 2021, the plaintiff commenced the present application for leave to commence a statutory derivative action on behalf of the Company against Wavoo and Latiff pursuant to s 216A of the Companies Act. The application was the culmination of a series of correspondences, which included the plaintiff\u2019s notice of his intention to commence the present application, between the parties which dated as far back as 3 February 2020. I shall refer to these correspondences later in this judgment as the defendants have suggested that the notice requirement under s 216A(3)(a) of the Companies Act is not met by these correspondences.

{"casename":"2022_SGHC_308","fact":"'7\\u2003The present application had come about in the following way. The applicant first learned that the respondent was in voluntary liquidation when its managing agent received an email from the respondent\u2019s customer management manager, Mr Bradford Thong (\u201cMr Thong\u201d), on 25 July 2022. Mr Thong had signed off as representing \u201cMCL Land (Vantage) Pte Ltd (In Liquidation)\u201d, despite having corresponded with the applicant previously as a customer management manager of MCL Land Limited, the parent company of the respondent. Having investigated further following this email, the applicant discovered that the respondent had been in members\u2019 voluntary liquidation since 12 May 2021. Because the respondent had held a final general meeting on 1 July 2022, the applicant believed that the respondent is due to be dissolved sometime in early October 2022.', '8\\u2003However, there were two outstanding matters that had arisen in June and July 2022 which had not been resolved between the parties:', '(a)\\u2003On or about 1 June 2022, the applicant was notified by the respondent that Fermax Asia Pacific Pte Ltd, one of the respondent\u2019s sub-contractors for the Development, was discontinuing an app which was necessary for the operation of the video intercom system built into the Development. Without the app or a reasonable replacement, the video intercom system would be effectively defunct. The applicant was in the process of discussing a solution to this with the respondent.', '(b)\\u2003On or about 7 July 2022, the applicant had sent the respondent a list of defects in the common area for the respondent to rectify. Mr Thong had informed the applicant that the respondent or MCL Land Limited were reviewing the list of defects with the main contractor. While the main contractor had attended to some of the matters on the list of defects, most of the defects remained unresolved without a firm commitment from the respondent to rectify them.', '9\\u2003While the applicant was prepared to resolve these matters in due course, its approach changed as soon as it discovered the respondent\u2019s imminent dissolution. The applicant became concerned that, if the respondent were to be dissolved, then there would be no party responsible for these two outstanding matters. The applicant therefore took steps and instructed its solicitors to write to the respondent and MCL Land Limited on 29 August 2022. The purpose of the correspondence was to invite the respondent to formally assign its outstanding obligations and liabilities to MCL Land Limited. This would allow the applicant to continue the resolution of the two outstanding matters with MCL Land Limited even after the respondent was dissolved.', '10\\u2003On 5 September 2022, MCL Land Limited responded to say that it was \u201cprepared, on a goodwill basis and without accepting any liability or obligation whatsoever\u201d to work with the main contractor for the Development to resolve the defects issue. However, MCL Land Limited did not wish to formally take over the respondent\u2019s obligations and liabilities. It also did not address the other outstanding matter in relation to the video intercom app.', '11\\u2003Accordingly, the applicant made the present application to defer the date of the respondent\u2019s dissolution until after the respondent\u2019s outstanding obligations and liabilities owed to the applicant are discharged, either through amicable settlement or litigation. Alternatively, the applicant applied to defer the date of the respondent\u2019s dissolution until its obligations and liabilities are assigned or novated to a third party to be agreed between the parties. Ultimately, the applicant\u2019s main concern was to have a party be responsible for the two outstanding matters, whether this was the respondent or otherwise.'"}
{"casename":"2022_SGHC_309","fact":"'4\\u2003I should first introduce the parties to the Suit. In the Suit, the claimant, Ms Leong Quee Ching Karen, the first defendant, Mr Lim Soon Huat (\u201cSoon Huat\u201d), and the second defendant, Mr Lim Soon Heng (\u201cSoon Heng\u201d), are siblings. Their father was the late Dato Lim Kim Chong (\u201cDato Lim\u201d), who passed away on 19 November 2021. Dato Lim had eight children, including the claimant, Soon Huat, and Soon Heng. For convenience, I shall refer to Dato Lim and his extended family as the \u201cLim Family\u201d. The fifth defendant is Soon Huat\u2019s son, Mr Thomas Lim (\u201cThomas\u201d).', '5\\u2003The third, fourth, and sixth defendants are companies incorporated in Singapore. These companies are part of a group of companies owned by, and operated for the benefit of, various members of the Lim Family. The sixth defendant is Seng Lee Holdings Pte Ltd (\u201cSLH\u201d). Soon Huat and Soon Heng collectively hold 60.42% of the shareholding in SLH. They are also the only two current directors of SLH (after the claimant was removed from the board). The claimant is a minority shareholder of SLH with 10.41% shareholding. The third defendant, Lim Kim Chong Investments Pte Ltd (\u201cLKCI\u201d), is also a shareholder of SLH. It holds the remaining 29.17% of the shareholding in SLH. Soon Huat is purportedly the sole shareholder of LKCI. He and Soon Heng are the only two directors of LKCI. Accordingly, Soon Huat and Soon Heng, and through LKCI, control the rights to 89.59% of the shareholding in SLH. The fourth defendant is Sin Soon Lee Realty Company (Private) Limited (\u201cSSLRC\u201d). Soon Huat holds 26.92% of the shareholding of SSLRC.', '6\\u2003I come then to the claimant\u2019s pleaded case. Her case in the Suit is that Soon Huat, Soon Heng, and LKCI (through Soon Huat, and Soon Heng as its directors and\/or shareholders) have acted oppressively against her and disregarded her legitimate expectations and interests as a minority shareholder of SLH. She therefore claims for relief under s 216 of the Companies Act 1967 (2020 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe Companies Act\u201d) for minority oppression against Soon Huat, Soon Heng, and LKCI.', '7\\u2003According to the claimant, Dato Lim decided that he wanted to distribute his considerable assets to his various children. SLH was therefore incorporated for this purpose on 12 July 2013. Subsequently, on 25 July 2013, the Lim Family entered into a Deed of Family Arrangement (\u201cOriginal Deed\u201d) to, among others, distribute a portion of Dato Lim\u2019s assets to his eight children in Singapore. To effect this, Dato Lim divided his eight children into two groups, \u201cGroup A\u201d and \u201cGroup B\u201d. The \u201cGroup A\u201d beneficiaries, which include Soon Huat, came to be shareholders of SSLRC and the beneficial owners of the assets held by SSLRC and its subsidiaries. The \u201cGroup B\u201d beneficiaries, which include Dato Lim, the claimant, Soon Heng, and LKCI, became shareholders of SLH and the beneficial owners of the assets held by SLH and its subsidiaries. On 28 February 2015, the Lim Family entered into an Amending and Restating Deed of Family Arrangement (\u201cAmended Deed\u201d) to amend certain terms of the Original Deed.', '8\\u2003On 15 September 2016, Dato Lim purportedly gave his 100% stake in LKCI to Soon Huat. On 23 August 2017, Dato Lim also purportedly gave Soon Huat his personal stake of 31.25% in SLH. Thus, by 23 August 2017, Soon Huat became a member of the \u201cGroup B\u201d beneficiaries. He remains a member of both the \u201cGroup A\u201d and \u201cGroup B\u201d beneficiaries up to the present time.', '9\\u2003By the claimant\u2019s own characterisation, she undertook various important duties in relation to SLH after it was incorporated. Indeed, according to her, even Dato Lim regarded her as playing an important role. Apart from her involvement in SLH, the claimant was also appointed as a director of several of the \u201cGroup B\u201d subsidiaries. This is said to be consistent with Dato Lim\u2019s repeated instructions to the Lim Family that the family business should take care of the claimant and allow her to receive a stipend in the course of her lifetime.', '10\\u2003As a result of the above backdrop, in particular, the incorporation of SLH to hold assets collectively for the benefit of all the \u201cGroup B\u201d beneficiaries, including the claimant, the claimant says that she has legitimate expectations to be treated fairly in relation to, and not be unjustly excluded from, SLH and the \u201cGroup B\u201d subsidiaries. In particular, the claimant says that her legitimate expectations extend to her being included and involved in the management of SLH and the \u201cGroup B\u201d subsidiaries, and to have access to information pertaining to them.', '11\\u2003However, the claimant says that, in breach of her legitimate expectations, Soon Huat, Soon Heng, and LKCI (as the majority shareholders of SLH) have carried out oppressive acts against the claimant. These acts include the following:', '(a)\\u2003On 27 April 2022, the claimant was removed as director of the \u201cGroup B\u201d subsidiaries under questionable circumstances. Her removal had come just five days after she had asked, through her then solicitors, for the management accounts of the \u201cGroup B\u201d subsidiaries. The claimant avers that she was entitled to such information as a director.', '(b)\\u2003Between 20 and 21 June 2022, the claimant requested a comprehensive breakdown of the \u201cAdministrative Expenses\u201d that was recorded in SLH\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements for each of the Financial Years between 2013 to 2021 from SLH. The claimant had observed that these Administrative Expenses were significant and on a general uptrend over the years. However, SLH did not reply in any helpful manner and did not, for example, give a proper breakdown of these Administrative Expenses.', '(c)\\u2003On 20 January 2022, SLH issued letters to each of the \u201cGroup A\u201d beneficiaries (ie, the shareholders of SSLRC) asking that they procure SSLRC to, among others, transfer two properties (\u201cthe Properties\u201d) to Soon Huat and Thomas, respectively. However, this ran counter to the understanding that SLH was meant to hold the assets for the benefit of the \u201cGroup B\u201d beneficiaries collectively. This would, in effect, remove valuable properties from SLH and affect the value of the claimant\u2019s shares.', '12\\u2003As a result of the alleged minority oppression against her, the claimant commenced the Suit primarily for a special audit to be conducted in respect of SLH\u2019s accounts and affairs. In particular, she claims for (a) an order for a special audit to be conducted into the accounts and affairs of SLH\u2019s financial position, or (b) an order that Soon Huat, Soon Heng, and\/or LKCI purchase the claimant\u2019s shares in SLH following the determination of a price by an independent valuer appointed to value the shares and (crucially) to conduct a special audit into the accounts and affairs of SLH to determine whether there are any matters which need to be taken into account in valuing the claimant\u2019s shares. As can be seen, the common item in both prayers is the special audit.', '13\\u2003To resolve matters, Soon Huat made several offers to purchase the claimant\u2019s shares in SLH:', '(a)\\u2003On 11 March 2022, Soon Huat offered to purchase the claimant\u2019s shares in SLH \u201cat fair value to be determined by an independent valuer appointed by [him]\u201d. On 28 March 2022, the claimant rejected this offer.', '(b)\\u2003On 7 July 2022, Soon Huat made a revised offer to purchase the claimant\u2019s shares in SLH at fair value and without a minority discount.

She responded by saying that \u201cshe is not, and would not be, in a position to contemplate any sale of her shareholding in the Company until and unless she is fully apprised of the affairs of the Company\u201d. The claimant therefore counter-proposed that a third-party accountant of her choosing to be appointed to review the books and records of SLH and its subsidiaries.', '(c)\\u2003On 2 August 2022, after the Suit was commenced, Soon Huat put forth a third offer, which is the material offer in question (\u201cthe Offer\u201d). By the terms of the Offer, a valuer would be appointed to value the claimant\u2019s shares and would be given information and documents pertaining to such a valuation, but not for a special audit. In addition, the offer would also include the pro-rated value of the Properties. On 8 August 2022, the claimant replied stating that the \u201coffer to provide access only to information that \u2018bears upon the value of [the claimant\u2019s] shares\u2019 does not address [the claimant\u2019s] concerns about potential mismanagement of [SLH] and its subsidiaries\u201d.', '14\\u2003Subsequently, on 22 August 2022, Soon Huat and Soon Heng filed HC\/SUM 3124\/2022 and HC\/SUM 3125\/2022, respectively, to strike out the Suit (\u201cthe Striking Out Applications\u201d). The Striking Out Applications were brought under O 9 r 16 of the Rules of Court (2021 Rev Ed) (\u201cROC 2021\u201d). The learned AR dismissed the Striking Out Applications and the defendants, including Soon Huat and Soon Heng, have appealed against his decision.

The DR therefore deemed Mr Chan to be absent at the CMC and proceeded to strike out the applicant\u2019s defence pursuant to O 108 r 3(7) of the ROC 2014 and entered the Default Judgment for the plaintiff. 15', 'However, the DR clarified the status of the Default Judgment in these terms: 16', '13\\u2003Ms Lim\u2019s firm then informed Mr Chan\u2019s firm via email on 25 January 2022 as to what happened during the CMC. 17', 'Ms Lim\u2019s firm maintained that they had taken the plaintiff\u2019s instructions and they were instructed that the plaintiff was not agreeable to mentioning the matter on the applicant\u2019s behalf. The email continued that Ms Lim \u201chad sought directions from the Court for [her] client to make an application to strike out [the applicant\u2019s] Defence\u201d. However, the email then said that the DR \u201chad instead exercised [her] discretion to award Judgment in favour of [the plaintiff] against [the applicant]\u201d. I pause to note that the DR\u2019s Notes of Evidence suggest that it was, in fact, Ms Lim who asked the court to enter default judgment against the applicant (see [10] above). It is, of course, technically true that the DR had to exercise her discretion to enter the Default Judgment, but the email suggests that Ms Lim never even sought a default judgment. This is not quite what happened.', '14\\u2003One day after the CMC, on 25 January 2022, the applicant filed SUM 373 to set aside the Default Judgment. Mr Chan also filed a supporting affidavit to explain his absence from the CMC. He explained that he had gone for his COVID-19 booster shot on 22 January 2022. On the early morning of 24 January 2022, which was the date of the CMC, he began to feel body aches and fever.

This is despite the DR\u2019s own direction at the CMC that the \u201c[applicant] is at liberty to apply to set aside the default judgment with a supporting affidavit filed by [applicant\u2019s counsel] to explain his absence in Court today\u201d. 21', 'Given that the DR had considered in SUM 373 the substantive merits of the applicant\u2019s defence to ascertain if any triable issues had been raised, she had presumably regarded the Default Judgment as a regular one.', '17\\u2003In RA 16, the applicant maintained much of her pleaded defence, but also argued that her ex-husband (the first defendant in MC 7384) had forged her signature in the Guarantee. 22', 'The DJ dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal against the DR\u2019s decision for essentially the same reasons as the DR: 23', '(a)\\u2003First, the DJ found that the plaintiff was not contractually obliged to interpret the Guarantee to the applicant or to advise her to seek legal advice before signing the Guarantee.', '(b)\\u2003Second, the DJ found that the documentary evidence did not support the applicant\u2019s assertion that she thought she was executing documents relating to the sale of her own vehicle.', '(c)\\u2003Third, as for the applicant\u2019s fresh allegation that her ex-husband had forged her signature, the DJ found that there was no evidence before the court to support this allegation.', '18\\u2003As such, the DJ concluded that the applicant did not show any triable issues to warrant the setting aside of the Default Judgment. As with the DR, the DJ did not mention in his reasoning how Mr Chan\u2019s absence at the CMC affected the status of the Default Judgment. Also, given that the DJ had considered the substantive merits of the applicant\u2019s defence to ascertain if any triable issues had been raised, he too presumably regarded the Default Judgment as a regular one.', '19\\u2003The applicant then applied for leave to appeal to the General Division of the High Court in SUM 3233. The same DJ dismissed the application on the basis that none of the three grounds in Lee Kuan Yew v Tang Liang Hong and another [1997] 2 SLR(R) 862 (\u201cLee Kuan Yew\u201d) which would have justified such leave to appeal was satisfied. 24', '20\\u2003The applicant has now made an application to the High Court for permission to appeal against the DJ\u2019s decision in RA 16.

When TLET rented the Equipment to G-Con in this period, it issued invoices to G-Con on a monthly basis which set out the terms and conditions for the rental and the rental charges.

Her evidence was that she agreed to this meeting out of goodwill despite the fact that Precise had no obligation to Ten-League, because parties were all working the Project together.

This would be up to the amount that G-Con owed to Ten-League. In consideration of this arrangement, Ten-League would refrain from shutting down its machines, so that G-Con could finish its works without delaying Precise\u2019s Project.

Further, G-Con would need to use the progress payments received from Precise to pay for its overheads and to pay its workers and sub-contractors. As such, Precise could not pay the entire progress payment to Ten-League. Finally, while G-Con was prepared to consider the direct payment arrangement, any sum to be paid directly from Precise to Ten-League would need to be after G-Con\u2019s deductions and subject to its confirmation of the actual amount payable. 18', '12\\u2003It is not disputed that no agreement was reached at the 14 Jan Meeting.

The 31 Jan Ten-League Letter referred to the 14 Jan Meeting, and stated that despite Ten-League\u2019s willingness to resolve the matter, there had been no progress in terms of either receiving payment or a commitment to pay the outstanding amount owed. As such, Ten-League would have to shut the Equipment down on 3 February 2020 (three days later). Ten-League described this shutdown as having been \u201cactivated\u201d by G-Con\u2019s non-payment. 20', '14\\u2003Mr Jison Lim explains that Ten-League believed at the time that it could not rely on G-Con to pay its outstanding debt. While G-Con had issued two cheques to Ten-League of approximately $300,000 in partial repayment of this debt, the cheques had bounced. Ten-League feared that this would be a recurring pattern in G-Con\u2019s attempts to settle its outstanding payments. 21', '15\\u2003On the same day, Mr Choo sent a letter on behalf of G-Con to Precise which was copied to Mr Jison Lim (the \u201c31 Jan G-Con Letter\u201d).

When Ms Zhang attempted to clarify that the acknowledgment was meant to be from Precise to G-Con and not from Precise to Ten-League, Ms Poon responded that Precise would have its own arrangement with G-Con and therefore it was not necessary for Ten-League to initiate an acknowledgement letter. 25', 'Precise did not sign anything on 31 January 2020.', '18\\u2003On 3 February 2020, the day that Ten-League had said it would shut the Equipment down, Ms Poon met Mr Choo at Precise\u2019s office and asked him to explain the 31 Jan G-Con Letter. 26', 'She asked Mr Choo why G-Con would authorise Precise to pay any outstanding fees due to G-Con to Ten-League instead, up to a maximum of $2m, without the need for G-Con to assess and confirm the amount payable. She said that she was confused because this meant that G-Con would have to be prepared to pay the full $2m to Ten-League. She added that she could not even be confident that the sums due from Precise to G-Con would come close to $2m. Mr Choo explained that Mr Jison Lim had contacted him and told him that Ten-League\u2019s auditors required G-Con to issue the 31 Jan G-Con Letter such that Ten-League\u2019s initial public offering exercise (\u201cIPO\u201d) would not be affected. Thus, the 31 Jan G-Con Letter was simply for show. He explained that he signed the 31 Jan G-Con Letter despite disagreeing with its contents because he trusted Mr Jison Lim\u2019s explanation that it was simply to satisfy Ten-League\u2019s auditors. 27', '19\\u2003After this discussion between Ms Poon and Mr Choo, Precise issued a letter addressed to G-Con dated 4 February 2020 (the \u201c4 Feb Letter\u201d) that was copied to Ten-League by e-mail. The following portions of the 4 Feb Letter are relevant: 28', '20\\u2003Ten-League responded later that day by e-mail (the \u201c4 Feb E-mail\u201d), instructing Ms Poon to \u201cdo this after discussion with auditor\u201d. Ten-League stated that it had \u201cchecked with [its] auditor\u201d and noticed that there was no timing provided for the payment date, and that Precise would pay to Ten-League whatever was left after deduction subject to G-Con\u2019s assessment and confirmation of the actual amount payable. What Ten-League said that it needed was: 29', 'Ten-League further stated that \u201c[f]ailing which, the whole amount due to G-con will be classified as doubtful debts and [their] IPO can be cancelled.\u201d Finally, it stated that the terms and conditions set out above had been indicated in \u201cTen-League\u2019s letter\u201d (presumably the Draft Acknowledgement) and that if Precise could come out with something of the same effect it \u201c[would] be good\u201d. 30', '21\\u2003In relation to the references to an \u201cauditor\u201d, Mr Lim Teck Meng explained that around the end of 2019, Ten-League had contemplated a listing exercise and had preliminarily engaged in discussions with financial advisers to determine what steps it would need to take. 31', 'Mr Jison Lim met with two or three auditing firms for this purpose. 32', 'Neither Mr Jison Lim nor Mr Lim Teck Meng gave evidence of what was specifically discussed with the auditors. However, Mr Lim Teck Meng testified that, from his own professional knowledge, he believed that if Mr Jison Lim had discussed the outstanding debts with the auditors, the common-sense reply would be to collect back the outstanding amount so that there would not be doubtful debts that could result in a reduction in the profit and accordingly the valuation of Ten-League. 33', 'Mr Jison Lim testified that G-Con\u2019s debt would have been raised by any interested investor or participant in the proposed listing exercise following due diligence because after all, the amount was fairly significant and it would be preferable that there would not be doubtful debts affecting the valuation of Ten-League. 34', 'He further testified that Ten-League would have attempted to seek recovery of the sums from G-Con in any event. Ultimately, in April 2020 it became clear that a listing exercise would not be appropriate at the time and therefore no auditors were ever appointed or formally engaged. 35', '22\\u2003The parties met on 6 February 2020 at Precise\u2019s office. The attendees were the same as those for the 4 Feb Meeting, except that Mr Teo and Mr Seng did not attend. What was discussed at the meeting is the subject of much dispute. It is at this meeting that Ten-League alleges a tripartite contract was formed between Ten-League, G-Con and Precise regarding a direct payment arrangement (the \u201cDirect Payment Agreement\u201d). Ten-League (in closing submissions), alleges that the following was agreed: 36', 'Both Precise and Mr Choo deny that any such agreement was reached at the 6 Feb Meeting. 37', '23\\u2003The next day, a letter was sent by G-Con to Precise (the \u201c7 Feb Letter\u201d). Mr Lim Teck Meng drafted this letter on Mr Choo\u2019s behalf. His evidence is that the 7 Feb Letter \u201crecorded\u201d the terms of the Direct Payment Agreement which had been reached at the 6 Feb Meeting. He understood, based on the terms of the Direct Payment Agreement, that this letter was important to \u201cformalise the payment arrangement and record that G-con expressly authorised Precise to settle its debt to Ten-League on G-Con\u2019s behalf, to avoid any potential action by G-Con against Precise for interfering in its contractual arrangement with Ten-League.\u201d 38', '24\\u2003The 7 Feb Letter referred to the 4 Feb Letter. It stated that G-Con was acceptable to Precise\u2019s terms and thereby authorised Precise to pay to TLC, and deduct from the amount payable to G-Con, the following sums (totalling $2m): $800,000 on or before 28 February 2020, $700,000 on or before 31 March 2020 and $500,000 on or before 30 April 2020. Finally, it stated, \u201c[i]f the amount payable to [G-Con] is less than $2m, please make whatever amount available to [Ten-League]. [G-Con] will pay [Ten-League] for the shortfall.\u201d 39', 'Mr Choo signed the 7 Feb Letter and affixed G-Con\u2019s company stamp to it. However, his evidence is that he did so simply because Mr Lim Teck Meng and Mr Jison Lim told him that they needed him to do so to satisfy their auditors. Like the 4 Feb Letter, his evidence is that he disagreed with the contents. He would not know how much money he would receive from Precise, and that G-Con would not be able to pay $2m in three months. 40', 'When Ms Poon called him to clarify the 7 Feb Letter, he explained that it was simply a \u201ccomfort\u201d letter and that any direct payment arrangement was still subject to the conditions he had raised at the 14 Jan Meeting (see [11] above). 41', '25\\u2003Precise did not respond to the 7 Feb Letter. Ms Poon\u2019s evidence is Mr Choo told her that the 7 Feb Letter was just to satisfy Ten-League\u2019s auditors, and that the 4 Feb Letter remained applicable. As such, she saw no need to respond. 42', '26\\u2003On 17 February 2020, Precise issued Payment Certificate No. 13 (\u201cPC13\u201d) to G-Con. 43', 'PC13 certified that $1,718,200.23 was payable to G-Con for works done in January 2020. However, this was subject to contra charges and back charges amounting to $952,083.20. After factoring GST, the amount due to G-Con from Precise was $819,766.62. 44', 'On 24 February 2020, Precise issued a cheque for $811,316.78. This was $8,449.84 less than the amount stated in PC13 because that sum had been inadvertently overpaid to G-Con in a previous payment. Ms Poon explained that, while the cheque was issued on 24 February 2020, Precise left the addressee field blank because she was waiting to clarify with Mr Choo the amount payable to Ten-League. 45', '27\\u2003On 27 February 2020, Mr Jison Lim instructed one of his staff to shut the Equipment down. He explains that he did so because he suspected that Ten-League would not be receiving the first payment from Precise stipulated in the 7 Feb Letter. 46', 'Later that day, he received a message from a staff member of G-Con, Mr Baktha, asking him to \u201cconsider again\u201d and to \u201clet [him] finish this project\u201d. 47', 'Mr Jison Lim agreed and asked him to chase Precise for payment. 48', '28\\u2003On 2 March 2020, Ms Poon called Mr Choo to confirm the amount payable to Ten-League, as the 4 Feb Letter stated she should (see [19(c)] above). Mr Choo told her to instead issue the cheque to G-Con, and that G-Con would make its own payment to Ten-League. Ms Poon asked for this to be confirmed in writing, and Mr Choo did so. 49', 'This written confirmation referred to PC13 and informed Precise not to make payment to Ten-League, and instead to make full payment to G-Con. Precise acknowledged this in writing as well. 50', 'In light of G-Con\u2019s instructions, Ms Poon instructed her staff to address the PC13 cheque to G-Con and sign it. Mr Choo collected the cheque that day. 51', '29\\u2003G-Con then issued a cheque dated 4 March 2020 to Ten-League for the sum of $100,000. 52', 'Mr Choo prepared a report to show Ten-League how he had allocated the sum received from Precise to G-Con\u2019s sub-contractors, suppliers and workers. This report indicated a balance of $162,911.77, and of this balance Mr Choo paid $100,000 to Ten-League and retained the rest for cash flow. 53', '30\\u2003Ten-League was not satisfied that it had not received the $800,000 directly from Precise in accordance with the Direct Payment Agreement and that instead, Precise had paid G-Con who had then used the sum to pay settle other debts. 54', 'Thus, Ten-League proceeded to shut the Equipment down immediately and started demobilising the Equipment from 6 March 2020. 55', '31\\u2003On 11 March 2020, TLET commenced proceedings against G-Con (\u201cSuit 226\u201d) for the sum of $1,810,702.70, being G-Con\u2019s arrears pursuant to the Rental Agreements as at that date. 56', 'The claim was one for breach of the Rental Agreements. 57', 'Mr Lim sent the writ of summons in Suit 226 to Ms Poon and Mr Choo via e-mail the same day. 58', 'He followed this with a further e-mail on 13 March 2020 referring to the 6 Feb Meeting (the \u201c13 Mar E-mail\u201d). In this e-mail, he stated: 59', '32\\u2003Ms Poon responded on 17 March 2020, stating that Precise had at all times made clear that it had no objection to issue direct payment to Ten-League subject always to G-Con\u2019s assessment and confirmation of the actual amount payable. She stated that Precise\u2019s records showed that on 2 March 2020, Mr Choo did not assess any amount to be paid to Ten-League. She reiterated that there was no \u201cprivity of contract\u201d between Precise and Ten-League and that Ten-League\u2019s agreement to let G-Con continue to use the Equipment was purely of its own accord. She suggested that Ten-League pursue the matter with G-Con. 60', '33\\u2003On 21 March 2020, TLET obtained judgment in default of appearance in Suit 226.', '34\\u2003Thereafter, four further payment certificates were issued by Precise to G-Con. These are as follows:', '35\\u2003As can be seen, in all the payment certificates following PC13, G-Con was not due any money and in fact owed money to Precise. This arose from significant sums stated to be owing to Precise from G-Con, termed by parties as \u201cback charges\u201d, which far exceeded the certified sums for work completed by G-Con. The propriety of these back charges for PC14 and PC15 is disputed by Ten-League and forms the content of an unlawful conspiracy claim (see [44] below). 65', '36\\u2003After obtaining judgment in default, TLET commenced an application against Precise to garnish any sums due or accruing from Precise to G-Con (\u201cSummons 1449\u201d). On 27 March 2020, the date PC 14 was issued, it obtained a provisional garnishee order (\u201cPGO\u201d) against Precise. Precise was notified about the PGO on 30 March 2020. 66', 'In the course of Summons 1449, Ms Poon filed an affidavit stating that, as at that date, there were no monies due and owing from Precise to G-Con, and that in fact, Precise was owed money by G-Con (as per the table at [34] above). 67', 'At the hearing on 9 July 2020, the assistant registrar dismissed TLET\u2019s application to make the PGO absolute and discharged the PGO, accepting that there were no monies owed by Precise to G-Con as at the date the PGO was granted. 68', 'On 22 July 2020, TLET filed a notice of appeal against the AR\u2019s decision. This was subsequently withdrawn on 17 August 2020. 69', '37\\u2003On 26 August 2020, Ten-League commenced this suit against Precise and Mr Choo.'"}

{"casename":"2022_SGHC_32","fact":"'3\\u2003The appellant, Ten-League Corporations Pte Ltd, supplied a boom lift to the respondent, Debenho Pte Ltd. I shall refer to the appellant as the seller and to the respondent as the buyer.', '4\\u2003A boom lift is a mechanical device that enables workers to carry out tasks at height. It is a mobile elevating platform falling within the class of equipment for which Singapore Standard SS 616:2016 1', 'provides a code of practice for safe use. In this case, the boom lift had two booms, an upper and a lower one. I shall refer to it as the Boom Lift. Bearing model number GTZZ-25, it was manufactured by a company incorporated in the People\u2019s Republic of China, Changsha Skyboom Heavy Industry Co Ltd. 2', 'Their literature describes the Boom Lift as a self-propelled articulated boom lift. 3', 'I reproduce here the seller\u2019s illustration of its main components: 4', '', '5\\u2003For the Boom Lift to achieve its full working height, both booms would need to be used, as depicted in the illustration. The Boom Lift had a safeguard against the potential risk of toppling: a tilt sensor that would trigger an automatic shut off if the chassis of the Boom reached 3 degrees of inclination. 5', '6\\u2003At about the time of delivery, the Boom Lift had received a certificate of test dated 30 October 2017 issued by Mr Tan Geok Leng (\u201cMr Tan\u201d), an examiner authorised by the Ministry of Manpower. 6', 'It was delivered in November 2017 and fully paid for. 7', '7\\u2003On 28 January 2018, during operation by the buyer, one of the wheels of the Boom Lift lifted off the ground, triggering shut off. 8', 'The two workers on the platform were rescued by use of a scissors lift, another type of mobile elevating work platform. 9', '8\\u2003A photograph was taken and put into evidence during the trial. It is reproduced here: 10', '', '9\\u2003I shall refer to this photograph as the tilting incident photograph. It shows the Boom Lift after it had shut off and before the workers were rescued. Only the upper boom had been deployed. It had been elevated to an angle of about 45 to 50 degrees. One wheel had lost contact with the ground.', '10\\u2003The technical data for the Boom Lift specified a maximum height for the platform of 24.5m and a lift capacity of 230kg (sufficient for two workers and some equipment). Its horizontal reach maximum was specified to be 16m. Its stowed length was specified to be 11.28m. 11', 'The difference between the horizontal reach maximum and the stowed length is explained by the fact that the upper boom can be telescopically extended.', '11\\u2003Three days after the incident, and after the Boom Lift had been stowed, the buyer complained by email dated 31 January 2018 that the Boom Lift was \u201cunsafe for use\u201d and requested that the seller rectify the problem. 12', 'The email attached the tilting incident photograph, among others.', '12\\u2003The seller\u2019s customer service coordinator replied by email on 7 February 2018 to say that they had \u201cspecially arranged the service engineer from the headquarter to come to Singapore to do the thorough check on this boom lift\u201d and cautioned that the buyer should not operate the boom lift due to \u201cthe safety reason\u201d. 13', '13\\u2003The inspection by the service engineer, Mr Jia Lixin (\u201cMr Jia\u201d), took place on 12 February 2018. 14', 'The job card stated, inter alia, that to make sure the machine would work safely the manufacturer would add an angle sensor and rewrite the computer program controlling the operation of the Boom Lift. 15', 'It also contained the suggestion that the buyer \u201coperate the first boom up 1 to 50 degree. If want to move up more, should lift up the floor arm\u201d. On the day of the inspection, prior to installation of the angle sensors, the upper boom was lifted to an angle of 65 degrees and no wheel lifting was observed.', '14\\u2003On 5 March 2018, two angle sensors were installed, and the computer program was modified, as recorded in the job card for that date. 16', 'The job card also explained that going forward, the upper boom could only be operated on its own up to a maximum of 45 degrees whereafter the lower boom would need to be deployed. It is helpful to appreciate that the deployment of the lower boom not only increases the working height but also brings the centre of gravity of the lifting structure back over the chassis and so reduces the risks of tipping or toppling.', '15\\u2003However, the buyer was not satisfied with the Boom Lift with the additional angle sensors. By an email dated 28 March 2018, the buyer raised a different concern, namely that the platform rocked severely when the boom was fully extended. 17', 'Parties agreed that the seller would take the Boom Lift back and replace it with other equipment of equivalent value, but this compromise was not carried out. 18', 'The compromise is not relied on in these proceedings. Thereafter, the buyer issued a solicitors\u2019 demand letter dated 15 October 2018, seeking, among other things, a full refund of the purchase price. 19', 'In this letter, the buyer asserted that at the time of the incident the Boom Lift was being operated to its maximum height of 24.5m. 20', '16\\u2003The buyer commenced proceedings in June 2019.', '17\\u2003There was a mistake made by the buyer in its statement of claim. As asserted in its letter of demand, the buyer pleaded that during the tilting incident the Boom Lift was operating at its maximum height of 24.5m. 21', 'During oral arguments on the appeal, I asked counsel for the buyers whether this was really the case, given that the lower boom had not been deployed at all. 22', 'After consulting with her clients, counsel confirmed at the next hearing that the working height during the incident was in fact only around 15m, which would be consistent with the upper boom being raised to an angle of about 48 degrees. 23', '18\\u2003As for the seller, it particularised one aspect of improper usage with the words \u201cThe main boom should be raised before the secondary boom.\u201d 24', 'Without agreed or defined terminology this pleading was not completely clear. In the hearing before me, the terminology used has been that of lower and upper booms. The lower boom corresponds to the main boom as pleaded, while the upper boom corresponds to what was termed the secondary boom in the pleadings. Thus, the gist of the defence on this aspect was that before the upper boom was fully extended or elevated, the lower boom should be deployed both to achieve a greater height and to rebalance the centre of gravity. It does appear that the buyer understood this pleading to refer instead to the upper boom being lifted before the lower boom, given that it confirmed in its reply that that was what it had done. 25', '19\\u2003The trial took place over four days in March and April 2021. The buyer called three witnesses of fact and one expert. None of them were present during the incident.

The buyer\u2019s expert engineering witness, Mr Teng Chin Seng (\u201cMr Teng\u201d), did not testify about the tilting incident but only about his inspections in November 2019. The inspections in November 2019 were also attended by the manufacturer\u2019s representative, Mr Jia, who had carried out the inspections in 2018. Much of the inspections in November 2019 concerned the allegedly excessive nature of the shaking of the platform under certain conditions. 26', '20\\u2003The seller called three witnesses of fact and an expert engineering witness.

The plaintiff contends that the first defendant should first pursue the litigation for which leave is sought in these proceedings, while the defendants contend that the first defendant should remain a live company until Xiamen Tonghin\u2019s litigation against the plaintiff in China concludes.

On or around 4 July 2016, Mr Soh confirmed that he would proceed with the loan. 12', 'Following Mr Soh\u2019s confirmation that Asidokona would proceed with the loan, Mr Wong informed Mr Ong to prepare the necessary documents for the loan. 13', '11\\u2003On 18 July 2016, at 5.10pm, Mr Ong sent the following email to Mr Soh (copying Mr Wong) regarding \u201cProject Gold\u201d: 14', 'The documents attached were a power of attorney between Mr Soh and SSI (\u201cPower of Attorney\u201d), a deed of charge between Mr Soh and SSI of the shares in Asidokona (\u201cDeed of Charge\u201d), an instrument of transfer for the transfer of the shares in Asidokona from Mr Soh to a corporate buyer (\u201cShare Transfer Form (corporate buyer)\u201d), an instrument of transfer for the transfer of the shares in Asidokona from Mr Soh to an individual buyer (\u201cShare Transfer Form (individual buyer)\u201d), directors\u2019 resolutions in writing passed pursuant to article 90 of Asidokona\u2019s Articles of Association (\u201cBoard Resolutions\u201d) and a personal guarantee between Mr Soh and SSI (\u201cPersonal Guarantee\u201d).', '12\\u2003On 19 July 2016 at 8.18am, Mr Soh replied to Mr Ong\u2019s email highlighting that the draft loan agreement was not attached. 15', 'In response, at 10.38am, Mr Ong sent Mr Soh (copying Mr Wong) the draft loan agreement between Asidokona and SSI (\u201cLoan Agreement\u201d). 16', 'On 21 July 2016, Mr Soh decided to \u201csign off\u201d on 22 July 2016 and confirmed the following with Mr Wong through WhatsApp messages: 17', 'Thus, the common understanding was that Mr Ong was to transfer only S$1,700,000 as the remaining S$300,000 was to be used for the interest payment for three months at the rate of 5% a month as set out in the draft loan agreement. 18', '13\\u2003Meanwhile, Mr Ong informed Ms Pok Mee Yau (\u201cMs Pok\u201d), also known as Karen, that Mr Soh would attend at the JLC Advisors\u2019 office to sign the loan documents. Ms Pok was previously a partner of JLC Advisors. She had drafted the documents attached to Mr Ong\u2019s emails to Mr Soh dated 18 and 19 July 2016 (as mentioned at [11]\u2013[12]), which I shall refer to collectively as the \u201cLoan Documents\u201d. Mr Ong requested Ms Pok to attend to the signing by Mr Soh as he would be occupied then. 19', '14\\u2003According to Ms Pok, on 22 July 2016, Mr Soh attended at the JLC Advisors\u2019 office in the morning. Ms Pok introduced herself to Mr Soh as a partner of JLC Advisors. During the meeting which took about 25 minutes, Ms Pok flipped through the relevant documents and briefly explained them to Mr Soh. Ms Pok also told Mr Soh that he could take his time to review the documents before signing and he informed her that he was ready to sign. Ms Pok then asked Mr Soh to sign on the execution pages. 20', 'Mr Soh did so. 21', 'After Mr Soh had signed the documents, Ms Pok stamped her name and profession and signed in the signature block as the witness for the Loan Agreement, Personal Guarantee, Deed of Charge and Power of Attorney. 22', '15\\u2003I should point out that the defendants plead an entirely different version of events. In particular, the defendants aver that, at all times, the loan was meant to be personal to Mr Soh at an interest rate of 3% per month. Mr Ong and Mr Wong, who were present at the meeting at JLC Advisors on 22 July 2016, essentially compelled Mr Soh to agree to an increase of the interest rate from 3% to 5% per month. Due to his urgent need for funds, Mr Soh agreed. Further, as Mr Soh was informed by a female staff that the agreements were not ready for his perusal, out of trust, he signed off on blank pages. 23', 'It is patently clear to me that this account is completely unbelievable. Even if one were to disregard the evidence of Mr Wong, Mr Ong or Ms Pok, the defendants\u2019 version is completely undermined by the wealth of objective evidence in the form of the contemporaneous communications between the parties (including some crucial pieces which I have referred to in [11]\u2013[12] above). As I observed at [2] above, at the trial, the defendants dropped these challenges.', '16\\u2003Turning to the Loan Agreement, the key terms are as follows: 24', '17\\u2003In the Personal Guarantee furnished by Mr Soh, pursuant to cl 1.1 read with cl 2.1(b), Mr Soh guaranteed that should Asidokona not pay any amount when due under or in connection with the Loan Agreement, Mr Soh would immediately on demand pay that amount to SSI as if he was the principal obligor up to the secured amounts, being the principal sum of S$2m, \u201call legal costs and other costs, charges and expenses whatsoever (on a full indemnity basis) and interest\u201d accrued on the same. By cl 3, should Mr Soh not make any payment of any sum due and owing under the Personal Guarantee, he shall, to the extent permitted by law, pay interest on such amount due from and including the due date to the date of actual payment (whether before or after judgment) at 6% per month accruing on a daily basis. 25', '18\\u2003As for the Deed of Charge, by cll 1.1 and 2, as well as the Recital (D) of the Preamble, Mr Soh agreed to charge 100% of the entire shareholding in the issued and paid-up capital of Asidokona to SSI by way of a first fixed charge for due performance and discharge of all his obligations arising under the Loan Agreement. By cl 4, Mr Soh is to deliver to SSI the share certificates for the Charged Shares, together with two share transfer forms executed in blank, and a certified true copy of the Register of Members of Asidokona duly noting that the shares are subject to the charge. 26', '19\\u2003On 22 July 2016, the S$2m loan was fully disbursed by DBS cheques dated the same date for S$1.1m and S$590,000 to Asidokona. Apart from the actual disbursement of S$1.69m, interest for three months of S$300,000 and transaction expenses of S$10,000 under cl 9.2 of the Loan Agreement were accounted for. 27', '20\\u2003Of the S$2m principal sum, Mr Wong contributed a total of S$1m to SSI. 28', 'Mr Wong contributed S$500,000 of his own money, and approached some other people to extend personal loans to him to raise the remaining S$500,000 as follows: 29', 'Due to the time constraints, Mr Wong told the four parties to make payments directly to the JLC Advisors\u2019 clients\u2019 account. Mr Wong has since repaid everyone for the full sums except for Mr Yong\u2019s S$100,000. 30', 'As for Mr Ong\u2019s client, the \u201cHong Kong\u201d investor contributed the remaining sum of S$1m. More will be said about this from [27] below.', '21\\u2003As the loan was disbursed on 22 July 2016, the Initial Term of the loan expired on 21 October 2016. This was the common understanding among Mr Wong, Mr Soh and Mr Ong. According to Mr Wong, in accordance with cl 2 read with Item 3 of Schedule 1, Asidokona was granted an extension of the loan by a further three months to 21 January 2017. Thereafter, Mr Wong alleged that Asidokona unilaterally extended the loan on multiple occasions. 31', '22\\u2003In October 2016, via a series of WhatsApp exchanges with Mr Wong, Mr Soh confirmed that he would renew the Loan Agreement on a \u201cmonth to month basis\u201d. As regards the interest payment, Mr Soh also agreed with Mr Wong\u2019s confirmation that the interest payment liable would be S$100,000. 32', 'Mr Soh stated that \u201c[w]e will still pay interest. 5 per cent per month\u201d. 33', 'Further, on 5 March 2017, Mr Soh also confirmed that \u201c[i]n terms of interest \u2026 [w]e will not dispute. Sin 100k \u2026\u201d and that he was of the view that \u201c[they] should be [paying off the loan] by mid March as paper work delay due to [his] hospitalisation\u201d. 34', '23\\u2003According to AAI, during the period between July 2016 and May 2017, Asidokona made various interest payments to SSI aggregating S$900,000. 35', 'The defendants do not dispute making payments amounting to S$900,000. However, they plead that these were repayments towards the loan (not interest), and that the repayments were not made to SSI.', '24\\u2003In any event, Asidokona failed to comply fully with its payment obligations under the Loan Agreement. 36', 'As of 15 May 2017, Asidokona failed to redeem the loan and SSI issued a statutory demand (through its solicitor Mr Ong) to Mr Soh for the sum of S$2,128,904 on the same date. 37', 'Between the period from end June 2017 to March 2018, Mr Soh reassured Mr Wong that Asidokona would repay the loan and interest. However, nothing materialised. 38', 'Thus, SSI\u2019s position is that it is clear from the correspondence that Mr Soh had \u201crepeatedly admitted Asidokona\u2019s liability under the Loan Agreement\u201d. 39', '25\\u2003According to Mr Wong, in and around March 2018, Mr Ong expressed to Mr Wong SSI\u2019s disappointment and frustration with the empty promises made by the defendants. As the loan was referred to SSI by Mr Wong, Mr Wong decided to arrange for AAI to take over the loan from SSI to \u201cmanage the direction forward in recovering the loan debt\u201d. Since Mr Wong had personally invested moneys to fund the loan for Asidokona and Mr Yong had indirectly contributed to the loan (as mentioned at [20] above), both Mr Yong and Mr Wong have an interest in the repayment of the loan. Thus, Mr Yong and Mr Wong decided that their company, AAI, would be the assignee of the Loan Agreement, Personal Guarantee and Deed of Charge. In that respect, Mr Wong \u201cirrevocably assigned [his] interest of S$1,000,000 from SSI to AAI\u201d. The arrangement pursuant to the assignment was that after the payment of costs, any sums recovered from the present proceedings are to be repaid to AAI and SSI in equal proportions. Thus, there is \u201cno avenue for AAI to profit from these proceedings\u201d. 40', '26\\u2003On 30 March 2018, all rights under the Loan Agreement and the Personal Guarantee were assigned from SSI to AAI (the \u201cFirst Deed of Assignment\u201d), notice of which was given to Asidokona and Mr Soh on 28 August 2018. 41', 'However, due to an oversight, the Deed of Charge was not assigned from SSI to AAI under the First Deed of Assignment. The Deed of Charge was assigned only on 15 November 2018 (the \u201cSecond Deed of Assignment\u201d), notice of which was likewise given on the same date. 42', 'In relation to the two deeds of assignments which I shall refer to as the \u201cDeeds of Assignments\u201d, Mr Wong signed on behalf of SSI and Mr Yong signed on behalf of AAI.', '27\\u2003According to Mr Wong, it was also only \u201cduring the assignment that [Mr Wong] found out from [Mr Ong] that the Hong Kong investor is [Ms Lou]\u201d. At the time of signing the Loan Agreement, Mr Wong did not know the identity of the \u201cHong Kong\u201d investor (see [9] above). 43', 'As such, Mr Wong referred to the other funder for the loan as the \u201cHK\u201d lender in his communications with Mr Soh at the material time. 44', '28\\u2003After Mr Wong became aware that the Hong Kong investor was in fact Ms Lou, Mr Wong called up Mr William Wong (ie, Ms Lou\u2019s husband) sometime in June or July 2018. During that call, Mr William Wong confirmed that SSI had sufficient moneys in July 2016 to fund the loan, that Mr Wong could sign off on the Loan Documents on behalf of SSI, and that Mr Wong could initiate a suit against the defendants. 45', '29\\u2003Indeed, on 22 July 2016, when Mr Soh signed the Loan Documents, SSI did not execute them. Around the time of the assignment from SSI to AAI, this was discovered by Mr Wong. Based on what Mr William Wong communicated, Mr Wong executed the Loan Documents on behalf of SSI. 46', 'This was witnessed by Mr Ong. 47', '30\\u2003Mr Ong\u2019s evidence is broadly consistent with Mr Wong\u2019s account. In particular, Mr Ong also referred to Ms Lou as the \u201cHong Kong\u201d investor. 48', 'According to Mr Ong, he referred to Ms Lou as such because \u201cMr William Wong and [Ms Lou] preferred to remain anonymous\u201d behind SSI. Mr Ong remained the \u201cpoint of contact\u201d at all material times between Mr Wong and SSI. Ms Lou wanted to be a \u201c\u2018sleeping\u2019 contributor\u201d and was \u201ccontent to have the [l]oan administered by [Mr Wong] and\/or his nominees\u201d for SSI. In that regard, Ms Lou and SSI had \u201cexpressly authorised [Mr Wong] to act as SSI\u2019s principal and agent\u201d. 49', 'In his testimony, Mr Ong clarified that Mr William Wong was \u201cthe primary person who is in charge of the group of funds and William is based in Hong Kong\u201d. Ms Lou and Mr William Wong were \u201coften in Hong Kong\u201d and they \u201coften remit funds from Hong Kong\u201d. 50', 'Mr Ong confirmed that the remaining sum of S$1m extended to Asidokona was deducted from the pool of funds which Mr William Wong and Ms Lou maintained in JLC Advisors\u2019 client account. 51', '31\\u2003In an interesting twist, Ms Lou denied that she knew about the Loan Documents or that SSI had authorised the same to be entered into at the material time. In a slightly incoherent fashion, she nevertheless said that she understood that Mr Ong was acting for SSI in relation to the Loan Documents. 52', 'Ms Lou deposed that since she had \u201cno idea of the Loan Agreement at the material time\u201d, the issue of the source of funds for the same is \u201cbest answered by Mr. Jeffrey Ong\u201d. 53', 'In due course, I shall discuss Ms Lou\u2019s evidence in more detail.'"}

Under clause 3 of the Management Contract, the defendant\u2019s term as managing agent would be from 1 May 2013 until the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s second AGM which took place on 30 April 2014. 4', '3\\u2003The defendant continued as the managing agent of JFH from 30 April 2014 until 8 July 2014 when the plaintiff appointed a new managing agent Vinco Real Estate Management Pte Ltd (\u201cVinco\u201d) to take over. 5', '4\\u2003The change in management agency for JFH was prompted by a dispute between the plaintiff and the defendant over a problem involving the grease interceptor system (\u201cthe Grease Trap\u201d or \u201cthe System\u201d) which is located below the ground level in the Building and is accessible by a room at the front driveway of the Building. The Grease Trap comprised of two units of grease (and solids) interceptors, an ejector system (consisting of one ejector tank and two ejector pumps) and a sump pump system which consists of two sump pumps. 6', 'A simplified schematic diagram of the System can be found in Appendix 4 of the report of the defendant\u2019s expert Mr Chong Seng Lai dated 1 March 2021.', '5\\u2003The Grease Trap was part of the Building\u2019s common property and it therefore came under the control of the plaintiff as well as the defendant\u2019s responsibility.

However, JOL\u2019s engagement was not based on a contract but was ad hoc as and when the defendant made a request. The ad hoc maintenance works for the Grease Trap consisted of manually removing the hardened grease through the ground level manhole. According to the plaintiff, because the Grease Trap was not maintained on a regular basis, there were frequent blockages that necessitated JOL\u2019s services being called upon often on an urgent basis to clear the blockages.', '7\\u2003In the affidavit of evidence-in-chief (\u201cAEIC\u201d) of the plaintiff\u2019s only witness Mr Ow Yong Chaan Loung (\u201cMr Ow Yong\u201d), he set out a number of occasions when JOL were called to clear blockages (emergency and non-emergency) of the Grease Trap. 7', 'During his cross-examination, Mr Ow Yong clarified that the blockages were not in the Grease Trap itself but in the pipes from individual units that led to the common pipe and then to the grease tank.

It was only when council members told him to do so (according to the plaintiff), that Mr Ahmad started looking for quotations to repair the Grease Trap. Mr Ahmad had told the council members he was using an in-house pump to suck out the water and it was only after the water level had gone down that a contractor could have access to the Grease Trap.', '10\\u2003Eventually, on 27 May 2014, the defendant submitted two quotations to the plaintiff to repair the Grease Trap.

Accordingly, on 10 March 2015, through its (former) solicitors, the plaintiff sent a letter of demand 13', 'to the defendant giving notice that the plaintiff would be taking the necessary steps to investigate and rectify the problem of the Grease Trap and would seek to recover such costs \u201cfrom the party liable for the Problems\u201d (\u201cProblems\u201d were defined in the letter as \u201csignificant rectification works in order to address all associated problems arising from the Installation [of the large submerged grease trap]).', '17\\u2003As a prudent measure, the solicitors wrote similar letters of demand to the Building\u2019s architects, the M & E Engineers and the Developer on the same day.', '18\\u2003In a follow-up letter dated 3 July 2015 to the defendant and the other parties stated above at [17], 14', 'the plaintiff\u2019s solicitors stated it had obtained a quotation from RJS Engineering Consultancy Services in the total sum of $600,000 to make good the damages associated with the Installation. The solicitors required the addressees of their letter to respond within 14 days with \u201can acceptable offer of compensation\u201d failing which the plaintiff would proceed with repair works and commence legal action. All the addressees denied liability in their respective replies to the letters of demand from the plaintiff\u2019s solicitors. 15', '19\\u2003Much later, the plaintiff decided to replace the grease trap system in the light of the problems highlighted by CCBS (see above at [14]\u2013[15]) if the Grease Trap was rectified. The plaintiff engaged Richard Lok M & E Consultants (\u201cRL\u201d) to conduct the tender exercise for the supply, installation, testing and commissioning of a new mechanical and electrical system grease trap system.', '20\\u2003On 21 April 2017, RL notified the plaintiff that it had received four tenders for the new grease trap system. RL recommended that the tender be awarded to L-ONYX Pte Ltd (\u201cL-ONYX\u201d). The Plaintiff accepted RL\u2019s recommendation and by RL\u2019s letter dated 11 July 2017, 16', 'L-ONYX was awarded the contract and paid $245,785.63 for the supply, installation, testing and commissioning of a new grease trap system at JFH. 17', '21\\u2003The plaintiff\u2019s attempts to resolve its claim amicably or through mediation 18', 'with the defendant were unsuccessful and\/or rebuffed. Consequently, in January 2020, the plaintiff commenced Suit No 20 of 2020 (\u201cthis Suit\u201d) against the defendant.'"}
{"casename":"2022_SGHC_45","fact":"The facts\nThe loan facility agreement and the security agreements \n15 In November 2016, the plaintiff entered a suite of interrelated \nagreements with Lioncap:\n(a) A loan facility agreement22 and an addendum23 to it under which \nLioncap Asia extended a HK$120m loan facility to the plaintiff.24\n(b) Two security agreements25 and two supplementary agreements \nby which the plaintiff created a security interest in 130m Cabbeen shares \nin favour of Lioncap Global as security for: (i) the HK$120m loan \nfacility which Lioncap Asia had extended to the plaintiff; and (ii) a \nHK$2m loan facility which Lioncap Asia had separately and earlier \nextended to an associate of Mr Yang.26\n16 The following three provisions of the security agreements are relevant \nfor present purposes:27\n(a) Clause 2.01 created in favour of Lioncap Global \u201ca first legal \ncharge\u201d in the shares upon completion;\n22NSK p 623.\n23 NSK p 649.\n24 SOC A2 para 5; Core Bundle vol 1 (\u201c1CB\u201d) at p 93.\n25 NSK p 652.\n26 CB 69, 89, 19 and 49. \n27 NSK p 652.\nVersion No 3: 08 Dec 2023 (18:00 hrs)\nAcute Result Holdings Ltd v [2022] SGHC 45\nCGS-CIMB Securities (Singapore) Pte Ltd\n8(b) Clause 3.01 of the security agreements obliged the plaintiff, by \nway of completion, to deliver the 130m shares either to Lioncap Global \nor to a brokerage account designated by Lioncap Global; and\n(c) Clause 2.05 provided that Lioncap Global would acquire \u201call the \nlegal beneficial titles and interests\u201d in the shares upon, amongst other \nthings, an event of default under the loan facility agreement.\n17 This suite of interrelated agreements is expressly governed by Hong \nKong law. Furthermore, the laws of several other jurisdictions are potentially \nengaged. The plaintiff is a Cayman company. Cabbeen is a BVI company. The \ninstruction letters by which the plaintiff transferred the 57.08m shares to \nLioncap Global\u2019s account with the defendant are governed by Indonesian law.28 \nBut neither party called any expert evidence on any foreign law at trial. The \nparties are therefore content to have this action determined on the basis that all \nof these foreign laws are identical in all material respects to Singapore law.29 I \ntherefore do not refer to or apply any law other than Singapore law in the \nremainder of this judgment.\nThe plaintiff transfers the shares out of its brokerage account in Hong Kong\n18 In November 2016, pursuant to cl 3.01 of the security agreements, \nLioncap Global directed the plaintiff to open a dedicated brokerage account with \nPT CIMB Securities Indonesia (\u201cCIMB Indonesia\u201d) in the plaintiff\u2019s own name \nand to transfer the 130m shares into this account.30 CIMB Indonesia is a member \nof the same group of companies as the defendant but is a separate legal entity \n28 AB 1353.\n29 DCS para 77.\n30 NSK para 21; NE 13.07.2020 p 81:17-82:9\nVersion No 3: 08 Dec 2023 (18:00 hrs)\nAcute Result Holdings Ltd v [2022] SGHC 45\nCGS-CIMB Securities (Singapore) Pte Ltd\n9incorporated and carrying on business as a brokerage in Indonesia. CIMB \nIndonesia is not a party to this or any other action by the plaintiff.\n19  In December 2016, as directed, the plaintiff opened the dedicated \nbrokerage account with CIMB Indonesia.31 At that time, the plaintiff held its \nCabbeen shares in a brokerage account with China Merchant Securities (HK) \nCo Ltd (\u201cCMS\u201d), a brokerage in Hong Kong.32 In January and February 2017, \nthe plaintiff transferred 144m shares from its account with CMS into its account \nwith CIMB Indonesia.33 The plaintiff thereby appropriated these shares to \nLioncap Global\u2019s security. It is not clear why the plaintiff transferred 144m \nshares instead of 130m as envisaged by the security agreements. The \ndiscrepancy is ultimately immaterial. \nThe instruction letters\n20 Lioncap Asia failed to advance any part of the HK$120m loan facility \nto the plaintiff as it was obliged to under the loan facility agreement.34 It appears \nthat Lioncap Asia had difficulty raising funds to lend the plaintiff.\n(1) The plaintiff rejects a draft instruction letter\n21 In February 2017, Lioncap Global presented to the plaintiff a draft letter \nof instructions. Lioncap Global asked the plaintiff to sign the draft and issue it \nto CIMB Indonesia.35 The draft informed CIMB Indonesia: (a) that Lioncap \nGlobal had an intention to borrow the 144m shares; and (b) that the plaintiff \n31 NSK para 21.\n32 NSK para 4.\n33 NSK paras 30 to 32; SOC A2 paras 11 to 12; 8 AB 4517.\n34 NSK para 33; 6 AB 3312.\n35 NSK para 40; p 850.\nVersion No 3: 08 Dec 2023 (18:00 hrs)\nAcute Result Holdings Ltd v [2022] SGHC 45\nCGS-CIMB Securities (Singapore) Pte Ltd\n10irrevocably instructed CIMB Indonesia to transfer the 144m shares from the \nplaintiff\u2019s account with CIMB Indonesia to Lioncap Global\u2019s account with the \ndefendant.

She suggested several \namendments. Only one of those amendments is material. That amendment was \nthe express proviso italicised below, stipulating that \u201cthe legal and beneficial \nownership of the shares\u201d was to remain with the plaintiff:39\nDear Sir\/Madam\nWe refer to the request of Lioncap Global Management Limited \nas the Plegdee Pledgee in relation to the Facility Agreement in \nthe amount of HK$120,000,000 from Lioncap Asia Limited as \nset forth in the following documents:\nl.

It was concerned because a number of months had elapsed \nsince the plaintiff executed the loan facility agreements and security agreements \nand Lioncap Asia had failed to lend any money to the plaintiff. Further, the \nplaintiff wanted to reduce the loan quantum and secure the release of some of \nthe 144m shares held in the plaintiff\u2019s account with CIMB Indonesia.42\n26 In March 2017, the plaintiff informed Lioncap Global that it would not \nsign the draft.43 As a result, the next day, Lioncap declared an event of default \nunder the November 2016 agreements.44 The plaintiff denied any default. It \nasserted that it had fulfilled all of its contractual obligations to Lioncap and that \nit was in fact Lioncap Asia who was in breach of its obligation to lend money \nto the plaintiff under the loan facility agreement.45\n40 NSK para 55.\n41 NSK para 58.\n42 NSK para 59.\n43 NSK para 59.\n44 NSK para 60; 2 AB 941.\n45 NSK paras 62 to 63; 2 AB 945.\nVersion No 3: 08 Dec 2023 (18:00 hrs)\nAcute Result Holdings Ltd v [2022] SGHC 45\nCGS-CIMB Securities (Singapore) Pte Ltd\n1327 Later on in March 2017, with Lioncap Global\u2019s consent,46 the plaintiff \ninstructed CIMB Indonesia to transfer 30m of the shares back to its account with \nCMS. CIMB Indonesia duly carried out the transfer.47 This left 114m shares in \nthe plaintiff\u2019s account.\n(2) The plaintiff and Lioncap Global enter into an addendum\n28 On 20 April 2017, the plaintiff\u2019s representatives met Lioncap\u2019s \nrepresentatives in an attempt to resolve matters.48 Lioncap continued to insist \nthat the plaintiff transfer the shares to Lioncap Global\u2019s account with the \ndefendant. To reassure the plaintiff, Lioncap represented expressly that the \nplaintiff would remain the legal and beneficial owner of the shares even after \nthe transfer and that the shares could not leave Lioncap Global\u2019s account \nwithout instructions from the plaintiff.49 \n29 The plaintiff and Lioncap reached an agreement at this meeting. As a \nresult, at the conclusion of this meeting, they executed an addendum. Their \nintention was for the addendum to supplement and vary the November 2016 \nagreements.50 Therefore the addendum contained the following express \nprovisions (a) that the terms of the addendum amend the November 2016 \nagreements; (b) the terms of the addendum are to be treated as if they had been \nincluded in the November 2016 agreements; and (c) all other provision of the \nNovember 2016 agreements are to remain in full force and effect.51\n46 NSK para 34; SOC A2 para 18. \n47 NSK para 39.\n48 NSK para 69.\n49 NSK para 70(c) and 70(d).\n50 NSK para 72; p 910 to 917.\n51 NSK p 910.\nVersion No 3: 08 Dec 2023 (18:00 hrs)\nAcute Result Holdings Ltd v [2022] SGHC 45\nCGS-CIMB Securities (Singapore) Pte Ltd\n1430 The contractual effect of the April 2017 addendum was threefold. First, \nthe addendum reduced the quantum under the loan facility agreement from \nHK$120m to HK$50m.52 Second, the addendum released 56.92m shares from \nLioncap Global\u2019s security interest as no longer being needed, given the reduced \nquantum of the loan facility. Third, and most importantly, the plaintiff \nundertook an obligation to transfer 47.08m shares from its account with CIMB \nIndonesia to Lioncap Global\u2019s account with the defendant.\n31 The plaintiff and Lioncap performed their obligations under the April \n2017 addendum immediately upon executing it. Thus, they executed two further \ndocuments together with the addendum. These two documents were attached \npro forma to the addendum.\n32 First, the plaintiff signed a letter dated 20 April 2017 addressed to CIMB \nIndonesia instructing it to transfer 47.08m shares from the plaintiff\u2019s account \nwith CIMB Indonesia to Lioncap Global\u2019s account with the defendant.53 I shall \nrefer to this letter as the \u201c20 April 2017 instruction letter\u201d.\n33 Second, the plaintiff and Lioncap Global signed a joint letter of \ninstructions also dated 20 April 2017 addressed to CIMB Indonesia instructing \nit to transfer 56.92m shares from the plaintiff\u2019s account with CIMB Indonesia \nto the plaintiff\u2019s account with CMS.54 \n34 The joint letter of instructions is immaterial for present purposes and I \nneed say no more about it. It suffices to note that, on 24 April 2017, CIMB \n52 NSK p 911.\n53 NSK para 72(b), p 919 to 922; 1CB at p 123, 138.\n54 NSK para 72(c), p 924. \nVersion No 3: 08 Dec 2023 (18:00 hrs)\nAcute Result Holdings Ltd v [2022] SGHC 45\nCGS-CIMB Securities (Singapore) Pte Ltd\n15Indonesia transferred the 56.92m shares back to the plaintiff\u2019s account with \nCMS.55 This transfer left 57.08m shares in the plaintiff\u2019s account with CIMB \nIndonesia. It is these 57.08m shares which Lioncap Global went on to \nmisappropriate from the plaintiff.\n(3) The 20 April 2017 instruction letter\n35 The 20 April 2017 instruction letter retained the language asserting that \nthe shares would not, by reason of the instruction letter, be owned by Lioncap \nGlobal (see [ 21] above) as well as the proviso inserted by the plaintiff\u2019s solicitor \n(see [ 23] above):56\nDear Sir\/Madam,\nWe refer to the request of LionCap Global Management Limited \nas the Pledgee in relation to the Facility Agreement in the \namount of HK$50,000,000 from LionCap Asia Limited as set \nforth in the following documents:\nl.

Its principal \nobjection was that letter was framed as the plaintiff acquiescing to lending the \n47.08m shares to Lioncap Global rather than irrevocably instructing CIMB \nIndonesia to transfer the 47.08m shares to Lioncap Global.57 CIMB Indonesia, \nquite understandably, insisted that the plaintiff amend the letter so that it was \u2013\nin accordance with CIMB Indonesia\u2019s standard form instructions for share \ntransfers \u2013 framed as the plaintiff\u2019s irrevocable instructions to CIMB Indonesia \nto transfer the shares to Lioncap Global.\n(4) The first instruction letter\n37 By 24 April 2017, the plaintiff and Lioncap Global had resolved their \nissues with CIMB Indonesia about the wording of the 20 April 2017 instruction \nletter. On that day, the plaintiff issued a revised letter instructing CIMB \nIndonesia to transfer 47.08m shares from the plaintiff\u2019s account with CIMB \nIndonesia to Lioncap Global\u2019s account with the defendant.58 I shall refer to this \nletter as the \u201cfirst instruction letter\u201d. \n38 The first instruction letter was in substantially the same terms as the 20 \nApril instruction letter save that it addressed the principal issue that CIMB \nIndonesia had raised.59 This letter was now framed expressly as the plaintiff\u2019s \nirrevocable instructions to CIMB Indonesia to transfer the 47.08m shares to \nLioncap Global. Despite this, the first instruction letter retained the language \nasserting that the shares would not, by reason of the transfer, be owned by \n57 NSK p 920.\n58 NSK para 82.\n59 NSK para 85, p 983; YZ para 43; 1CB 430. \nVersion No 3: 08 Dec 2023 (18:00 hrs)\nAcute Result Holdings Ltd v [2022] SGHC 45\nCGS-CIMB Securities (Singapore) Pte Ltd\n17Lioncap Global (see [ 21] above) as well as the proviso inserted by the plaintiff\u2019s \nsolicitor (see [ 23] above). \n39 The first instruction letter was in the following terms:\nDear Sir\/Madam\nWe refer to the request of Lioncap Global Management Limited \nas the Pledgee in relation to the Facility Agreement in the \namount of HK$50,000,000 from Lioncap Asia Limited as set \nforth in the following documents:\nl.

In November \n2017, as a result of this pressure, Lioncap Global returned 2.26m shares to the \nplaintiff.72 Lioncap Global failed to return any more of the shares.\n47 The plaintiff ceased to engage Lioncap Global and instructed solicitors.73\n48 At this point, the plaintiff was unaware of the dealings between the \ndefendant and Lioncap and, in particular, of the matters set out at [ 44] above.\nThe first Hong Kong action\n49 In April 2018, the plaintiff commenced action against Lioncap Global \nin Hong Kong to recover the missing shares.74 Lioncap Asia was not a defendant \nto this action.

In August 2018, in view \nof the default judgment against Lioncap Global, the plaintiff stopped paying \ninterest. Lioncap Asia then declared an event of default under the loan facility \nagreement.77 As a result, the plaintiff paid Lioncap Asia under protest the \ninterest due for the quarter ending November 2018, while continuing its \nattempts to recover the missing shares and dividends.\n53 In November 2018, Lioncap Asia demanded the next interest payment \ndue on the loan. By this time, the plaintiff had failed to recover anything from \nLioncap Global, despite the default judgment in the first Hong Kong action. The \nplaintiff therefore refused to pay any further interest to Lioncap Asia. Instead, \n76 LMP para 81 to 86.\n77 LMP para 89.\nVersion No 3: 08 Dec 2023 (18:00 hrs)\nAcute Result Holdings Ltd v [2022] SGHC 45\nCGS-CIMB Securities (Singapore) Pte Ltd\n22it commenced action against both Lioncap Global and Lioncap Asia to have the \nNovember 2016 agreements rescinded.78 \n54 In May 2019, the plaintiff secured a default judgment in the second \nHong Kong action against Lioncap Global and Lioncap Asia. The default \njudgment:79\n(a) declared the loan facility agreement, the security agreements, the \nApril 2017 addendum and both instruction letters voidable and \nrescinded;\n(b) declared the plaintiff to be the beneficial owner of the 57.08m \nshares together with their traceable proceeds and all dividends paid on \nthem; and\n(c) required Lioncap Global to transfer the 57.08m shares to the \nplaintiff and to pay all sums due to the plaintiff, against which the \nplaintiff was to return to Lioncap Asia the HK$45m which it had lent \nthe plaintiff (see [ 41] above), provided that Lioncap Asia refunded the \ninterest which the plaintiff had paid it. \nThe parties\u2019 cases\n55 The plaintiff\u2019s case on the first tranche is as follows. The plaintiff\u2019s \nintention in entering into the security agreements and transferring the shares to \nLioncap Global was not to benefit Lioncap Global but merely to create a \nsecurity interest in the shares in favour of Lioncap Global.80 Therefore, Lioncap \n78 LMP para 90 to 91.\n79 LMP para 96.\n80 PCS para 63 to 64.\nVersion No 3: 08 Dec 2023 (18:00 hrs)\nAcute Result Holdings Ltd v [2022] SGHC 45\nCGS-CIMB Securities (Singapore) Pte Ltd\n23Global held the 57.08m shares on resulting trust for the plaintiff. Alternatively, \nif the effect of the first and second instruction letters was to transfer legal title \nto the shares to Lioncap Global, it held the shares on an express trust for the \nplaintiff.81 In either event, Lioncap Global misappropriated the shares in breach \nof trust.82 The defendant knew that Lioncap Global was dealing with the shares \nin breach of trust.83 The defendant therefore: (i) received the 30m shares from \nLioncap Global with knowledge of the breach of trust; (ii) holds the 30m shares \non constructive trust for the plaintiff;84 (iii) dishonestly assisted Lioncap Global \nin its breach of trust in respect of all of the shares;85 or (iv) breached a duty of \ncare in tort by transferring the shares out of Lioncap Global\u2019s account so as to \nrender Lioncap Global the beneficial owner of the shares.86\n56 The defendant\u2019s case in response is as follows. Lioncap Global was not \nany sort of trustee for the plaintiff at any time, either by reason of the plaintiff\u2019s \nintention in entering into the November 2016 agreements or by reason of the \ntransfers of the shares in April and May 2017.87 Even if Lioncap Global was a \ntrustee of some sort, the plaintiff has failed to discharge its burden of proving \nthat Lioncap Global acted in breach of the alleged trust.88 Even if Lioncap \nGlobal did act in breach of trust, the defendant was not dishonest and did not \nknow that Lioncap Global was dealing with the shares in breach of trust.89 As \n81 PCS para 98.\n82 PCS para 108.\n83 SOC A2 para 32.\n84 SOC A2 paras 35 to 37; PCS paras 296 to 305.\n85 SOC A2 para 39 to 40; PCS paras 57 to 295.\n86 SOC A2 para 42A; PCS paras 308 to 370.\n87 DCS paras 69 to 149.\n88 DCS paras 150 to 160.\n89 DCS paras 161 to 285. \nVersion No 3: 08 Dec 2023 (18:00 hrs)\nAcute Result Holdings Ltd v [2022] SGHC 45\nCGS-CIMB Securities (Singapore) Pte Ltd\n24for the plaintiff\u2019s claim in negligence, a financial institution (ie the defendant) \nowes no duty to a third party (ie the plaintiff) to take reasonable care to protect \nthat third party from a fraud perpetrated by one of the financial institution\u2019s \ncustomers (ie Lioncap Global). Any attempt to impose such duty would be \ncontrary to principle, precedent and policy.90\n57 With specific reference to the 30m shares which the defendant \npurchased from Lioncap Global (see [ 44(a)] above), the defendant\u2019s case is as \nfollows. The plaintiff\u2019s pleaded case against the defendant asserts liability only \nfor dishonest assistance and knowing receipt. These are forms of liability in \nequity which are purely personal liability. The plaintiff\u2019s pleaded causes of \naction can therefore yield only personal remedies in equity, not proprietary \nremedies.91 The plaintiff\u2019s prayer for a declaration that the defendant holds the \n30m shares on trust for the plaintiff and an order requiring it to transfer the \nshares to the plaintiff is therefore not tethered to any pleaded cause of action. In \nany event, the defendant acted in good faith in accordance with the instructions \nof its customer, Lioncap Global, in opening the 30m CFD positions and in \npurchasing the 30m shares from Lioncap Global to cover the positions.92 The \ndefendant was therefore a bona fide purchaser for value of the 30m shares \nwithout notice of any alleged beneficial interest which the plaintiff may have \nhad in them.93\n90 DCS para 286 to 292.\n91 DSC para 281; DRS paras 100 to 101. \n92 Defence A2 para 12(2); Transcript, 24 July 2020, p 119:4 to 7.\n93 DCS para 281; Defence A2 para 16B.\nVersion No 3: 08 Dec 2023 (18:00 hrs)\nAcute Result Holdings Ltd v [2022] SGHC 45\nCGS-CIMB Securities (Singapore) Pte Ltd\n25Establishing a trust is essential to the plaintiff\u2019s case in equity\n58 The essence of the plaintiff\u2019s case in equity is that Lioncap Global dealt \nwith the shares in breach of trust or in breach of a fiduciary duty owed to  the \nplaintiff.94 The defendant is not in a position to deny this aspect of the plaintiff\u2019s \ncase. All it can do is to put the plaintiff to proof.95 \n59 Proving that Lioncap Global held the shares on trust for the plaintiff is \ntherefore absolutely essential to the plaintiff\u2019s claims in equity. A trust is the \nplaintiff\u2019s only basis for asserting that Lioncap Global owed a fiduciary duty to \nthe plaintiff. Without an underlying fiduciary duty, a third party cannot be held \npersonally liable for knowing receipt or dishonest assistance: George Raymond \nZage III and another v Ho Chi Kwong and another [2010] 2 SLR 589 at [20] \nand [23]. Further, plaintiff\u2019s counsel confirmed that the constructive trust it \nasserts in this action is an institutional constructive trust and not a remedial \nconstructive trust.96 The proprietary base necessary for an institutional \nconstructive trust to arise is absent unless Lioncap Global held the shares on \ntrust for the plaintiff at the time the defendant purchased those shares.\nPreliminary point on the pleadings\n60 On the issue of whether Lioncap Global was a trustee for the plaintiff, \nthe defendant takes the preliminary point that the plaintiff has impermissibly \ndeparted from its pleadings.97 The defendant\u2019s argument on its preliminary point \nproceeds as follows. The plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim asserts that the source of \n94 SOC A2 paras 29 and 30. \n95 D A2 paras 11 and 14.\n96 Transcript, 19 November 2020, p 54:6 to 11.\n97 DCS paras 72 to 74.\nVersion No 3: 08 Dec 2023 (18:00 hrs)\nAcute Result Holdings Ltd v [2022] SGHC 45\nCGS-CIMB Securities (Singapore) Pte Ltd\n26the trustee\/beneficiary relationship lies in the contractual terms of the November \n2016 agreements. Thus, the plaintiff pleads expressly that because no event of \ndefault ever occurred under the security agreements, the plaintiff was and is the \nbeneficial owner of the shares.98 By this plea, the plaintiff asserts that a trust \narose because the contractual terms of the security agreements never operated \nto vest equitable title to the shares in Lioncap Global. If that is the plaintiff\u2019s \ncase, the only intention of the plaintiff which is material is its intention as \nmanifested in the November 2016 agreements. Its intention at any time after \nNovember 2016 is immaterial.99 Its intention manifested outside the November \n2016 agreements is equally immaterial. However, in its closing submissions, the \nplaintiff asserts that the trustee\/beneficiary relationship arose when the plaintiff \ntransferred the shares to Lioncap Global in April and May 2017. A resulting \ntrust is said to have arisen upon those transfers because the plaintiff had no \nintention to benefit the defendant by the transfers.100 Alternatively, an express \ntrust is said to have arisen then because of the terms of the first and second \ninstruction letters, by which the plaintiff expressly retained the beneficial \ninterest in the shares. \n61 The defendant also takes the further point on the pleadings that, although \nthe plaintiff pleads expressly that it was and is beneficially entitled to the shares, \nit has nowhere pleaded that the legal basis for this plea is that Lioncap Global \nheld the shares on trust for the plaintiff, let alone on resulting trust.101\n98 SOC A2 paras 26 and 27.\n99 PCS para 66 and 68.\n100 DCS paras 60 and 72.\n101 DCS para 73.\nVersion No 3: 08 Dec 2023 (18:00 hrs)\nAcute Result Holdings Ltd v [2022] SGHC 45\nCGS-CIMB Securities (Singapore) Pte Ltd\n2762 In response, the plaintiff submits that it has sufficiently pleaded all the \nessential facts on which to now advance a case that Lioncap Global was a trustee \nof the shares for the plaintiff and also as to how and when it became a trustee. \nThat is all that the plaintiff needs to do in order now to advance a case that \nLioncap Global was either a resulting trustee or an express trustee for the \nplaintiff:  Lin Chao-Feng v Chuang Hsin-Yi [2010] 4 SLR 427 at [15] and \n[19].102\n63 I accept the defendant\u2019s submission that the plaintiff has changed its case \nbetween its pleadings and its closing submissions. However, I decline to reject \nthe case which the plaintiff now advances on this technical point alone. I say \nthat for three reasons. \n64 First, I accept the plaintiff\u2019s submission that a pleader\u2019s duty is to plead \nfacts not law. Once the material facts have been pleaded, the pleader can \ndevelop the legal consequences of those facts in submissions.103 I would add \nonly the proviso that the legal consequences which the pleader develops in \nsubmissions must not take the opposing party by surprise so as to cause it \nprejudice which cannot be remedied. \n65 Second, I have found against the plaintiff on the case it now advances in \nits closing submissions. I must assume that, by advancing that case, the plaintiff \nhas abandoned its pleaded case. I must also assume that the case which the \nplaintiff now advances is its best and final case against the defendant. Given my \nfinding that the plaintiff fails even on its best case, it makes no difference \nwhether that case was or was not adequately pleaded.\n102 PRS para 10.\n103 PRS para 10.\nVersion No 3: 08 Dec 2023 (18:00 hrs)\nAcute Result Holdings Ltd v [2022] SGHC 45\nCGS-CIMB Securities (Singapore) Pte Ltd\n2866 Finally and most importantly, allowing the plaintiff to advance this case, \neven though it is a change from its pleaded case, causes the defendant no \nprejudice. The defendant was aware of the changed case from the time of the \nplaintiff\u2019s oral opening at trial. The changed case became clear as a result of \nplaintiff\u2019s counsel\u2019s responses to my questions on the very issue of the source \nof the trustee\/beneficiary relationship.104 Thereafter, defendant\u2019s counsel cross-\nexamined the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses on the basis of the changed case as well as \non the basis of the original pleaded case. There is also no suggestion that the \ndefendant required any further discovery to deal with the changed case. That is \nwhy the defendant quite rightly does not suggest that it will suffer any prejudice \nif the plaintiff is permitted to advance the changed case.105 That is also \npresumably why, as the plaintiff points out, the defendant did not take the \npleading point at trial or pursue it with any vigour in submissions.106\n67 I therefore examine on the merits the plaintiff\u2019s case that Lioncap Global \nwas a trustee for the plaintiff by reason of the transfers. I first analyse the \nplaintiff\u2019s case of a resulting trust before analysing its alternative case of an \nexpress trust.\nLioncap was not a resulting trustee of the shares\nA summary of the law relating to resulting trusts\n68 A resulting trust arises when a transferor transfers property to a \ntransferee lacking the intention to benefit the transferee: Lau Siew Kim v Yeo \nGuan Chye Terence [2008] 2 SLR(R) 108 at [35] (\u201cLau Siew Kim\u201d); Chan Yuen \n104 Transcript, 13 July 2020, p 15:21 to 16:3; 18:8 to 20:20. \n105 PRS para 21 to 22.\n106 PRS para 8.\nVersion No 3: 08 Dec 2023 (18:00 hrs)\nAcute Result Holdings Ltd v [2022] SGHC 45\nCGS-CIMB Securities (Singapore) Pte Ltd\n29Lan v See Fong Mun [2014] 3 SLR 1048 at [43] (\u201cChan Yuen Lan\u201d). The two \nfactual elements which give rise to a resulting trust are therefore: (a) a transfer \nof property to a transferee; and (b) circumstances in which the transferor does \nnot intend to benefit the transferee: Moh Tai Siang v Moh Tai Tong and another \n[2018] SGHC 280 at [72]; Robert Chambers, Resulting Trusts (Clarendon Press, \nOxford 1997) (\u201cChambers\u2019 Resulting Trusts\u201d) at p 32, accepted in Lau Siew \nKim at [35].\n69  A transferor\u2019s lack of intention to benefit the transferee can be \nestablished in two ways: (a) by a failure to rebut the presumption of resulting \ntrust which arises when a transferee of property does not provide the whole of \nthe consideration for the transfer; or (b) by evidence of the transferor\u2019s intention \nwith respect to the transfer. The court should not resort to the presumption if \nthere is evidence which can prove the transferor\u2019s intention or from which that \nintention can be inferred: Chan Yuen Lan at [51] (broadly approving Neo Hui \nLing v Ang Ah Sew [2012] 2 SLR 831 at [25]).\n70 The primary case of both parties is that there is sufficient evidence to \nmake a finding as to the plaintiff\u2019s intention at the material time. As such, I \nbegin by analysing that evidence.\nThe time at which to ascertain intention\n71 In the resulting trust analysis, the time at which to ascertain a transferor\u2019s \nintention is the time it transferred its property to the transferee. The transfers of \nthe plaintiff\u2019s property to Lioncap Global took place on 28 April 2017 and 31 \nMay 2017 (see [ 40] and [ 43] above). However, on the facts of this case, that is \nnot the correct time at which to ascertain plaintiff\u2019s intention.\nVersion No 3: 08 Dec 2023 (18:00 hrs)\nAcute Result Holdings Ltd v [2022] SGHC 45\nCGS-CIMB Securities (Singapore) Pte Ltd\n3072 The correct time at which to ascertain the plaintiff\u2019s intention is 20 April \n2017. I say that for three reasons. First, 20 April 2017 is when the plaintiff \nsigned the April 2017 addendum and undertook a contractual obligation to \ntransfer the shares to Lioncap Global\u2019s account with the defendant. Second, by \nsigning and issuing the 20 April 2017 instruction letter in performance of this \ncontractual obligation, the plaintiff evinced that it was ready, willing and able \nto do all within its power to transfer the shares to Lioncap Global. That is so \neven though this letter ultimately proved ineffective because CIMB Indonesia \nrejected it. Third, neither party suggests that the plaintiff\u2019s intention changed \nbetween: (a) the date it signed the addendum and the rejected instruction letter \n(20 April 2017) and the date it signed the first instruction letter (24 April 2017); \n(b) between the date it signed the first instruction letter (24 April 2017) and the \ndate it signed the second instruction letter (18 May 2017); or (c) between the \ndates on which it signed each instruction letter (24 April 2017 and 18 May 2017) \nand the dates on which CIMB Indonesia actually transferred the shares to \nLioncap Global (28 April 2017 and 31 May 2017).\n73 I therefore analyse the evidence to ascertain the plaintiff\u2019s intention as \nat 20 April 2017.\nThe parties\u2019 cases as to the plaintiff\u2019s intention on 20 April 2017\n74 The plaintiff\u2019s case as to its intention on 20 April 2017 is as follows. The \nplaintiff\u2019s only intention in November 2016 was to create a security interest in \nfavour of Lioncap Global. The plaintiff therefore had no intention to benefit \nLioncap Global in November 2016.107 That intention remained unchanged \nbetween November 2016 and 20 April 2017. The plaintiff therefore continued \n107 PCS para 69 to 70.\nVersion No 3: 08 Dec 2023 (18:00 hrs)\nAcute Result Holdings Ltd v [2022] SGHC 45\nCGS-CIMB Securities (Singapore) Pte Ltd\n31to have no intention to benefit Lioncap Global on 20 April 2017.108 On the \nauthority of Lau Siew Kim and Chan Yuen Lan, Lioncap Global therefore \nbecame a resulting trustee of the shares for the plaintiff when it received the \nshares in April and May 2017.\n75 The defendant\u2019s case as to the plaintiff\u2019s intention on 20 April 2017 is \nas follows. Even if it is true that the plaintiff\u2019s intention remained unchanged \nfrom November 2016 to 20 April 2017, its intention on its own case at all times \nwas to create a security interest in favour of Lioncap Global. That intention is \nwholly incompatible with a resulting trust arising in the plaintiff\u2019s favour, \nbefore or after the transfer of the shares to Lioncap Global.109 In the alternative, \nthe plaintiff\u2019s intention on 20 April 2017 was to lend the shares to Lioncap \nGlobal as part of a share lending agreement, the very commercial purpose of \nwhich requires Lioncap Global to acquire the beneficial interest in the shares.\n76 Before turning to analyse the evidence, I note at the outset that the \nplaintiff has been very careful to advance its case as to its intention on 20 April \n2017 precisely as the lack of intention analysis of the resulting trust requires: by \nasserting that the plaintiff had no intention to benefit Lioncap Global when it \ntransferred the shares to Lioncap Global.110 \n77 But that is not the plaintiff\u2019s case in substance. If that were indeed the \nplaintiff\u2019s case, it would simply adduce evidence from Mr Yang and Mr Ng that \nthe plaintiff never formed any such intention on or about 20 April 2017. The \nplaintiff\u2019s case on its intention is not simply that it lacked an intention to benefit \n108 PRS paras 26 to 27.\n109 DCS para 75.\n110 PCS paras 70, 79; PRS para 13. \nVersion No 3: 08 Dec 2023 (18:00 hrs)\nAcute Result Holdings Ltd v [2022] SGHC 45\nCGS-CIMB Securities (Singapore) Pte Ltd\n32Lioncap Global. Its case goes well beyond that. Its case is that it had an actual \nintention not to benefit Lioncap Global. That is what the plaintiff is attempting \nto prove by relying on the express language of the security agreements, the \nexpress language of the instruction letters (see the two italicised phrases at [ 39] \nabove) and the evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses at trial.\n78 In that sense, and despite the very careful wording by which the plaintiff \nadvances its case, its case on intention deliberately goes further than the lack of \nintention analysis in Lau Siew Kim and Chan Yuen Lan requires it to go. This \nhas an important consequence. If the plaintiff fails in its attempt to establish a \nresulting trust on the basis that it had an actual intention not to benefit Lioncap \nGlobal on 20 April 2017, that leaves the plaintiff no forensic room to fall back \non the presumption of a resulting trust or on an express trust.\nThe security agreements created only a security interest\n79 For the reasons which follow, I accept the defendant\u2019s case and reject \nthe plaintiff\u2019s case as to the plaintiff\u2019s intention on 20 April 2017.\n80 The plaintiff and the defendant agree on three points. First, the security \nagreements are evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s intention in November 2016 to create \nnothing more than a security interest over the shares in favour of Lioncap \nGlobal.111 Second, the security agreements did not transfer any property in the \nshares to Lioncap Global.112 Third, even though the security agreements call \nthemselves \u201cShare Pledge Agreements\u201d, the security interest they created could \nnot have been a pledge.113 \n111 PCS para 64; DCS para 86; PRS para 24.\n112 PCS para 65; DCS para 83(a).\n113 NE 19 Nov 2020, p23 line 5 to 6; p39 line 3 to 4; DCS para 83; PRS para 28.\nVersion No 3: 08 Dec 2023 (18:00 hrs)\nAcute Result Holdings Ltd v [2022] SGHC 45\nCGS-CIMB Securities (Singapore) Pte Ltd\n3381 All three of these points are correct. The first two points are correct \nsimply because that is what the security agreements expressly provide. The third \npoint is correct because the only assets which can be the subject of a pledge are \nassets reducible to possession, ie, chattels or documentary intangibles. A share \nis not a chattel: it is a chose in action. It is also not a documentary intangible. A \ndocumentary intangible is an intangible asset represented by a document of title. \nDocuments of title include bills of lading, bills of exchange and negotiable \nsecurities. A share certificate, at least in respect of a Singapore company, is not \na document of title. Shares in a Singapore company (see [ 17] above) cannot \ntherefore be the subject of a pledge: Qilin World Capital Ltd v CPIT Investments \nLtd [2018] 2 SLR 1 at [4].\nThe security agreements created a charge\n82 As to the true nature of the security interest which the plaintiff created \nin favour of Lioncap Global, the plaintiff\u2019s case is that the security interest was \na charge.114 The defendant\u2019s case is that cl 3.01 of the security agreements \nenvisaged Lioncap Global taking either a charge or a mortgage. Which interest \nLioncap Global actually took depended on how it exercised its right to require \nthe plaintiff to appropriate the shares to the security under that clause.115 If \nLioncap Global exercised that right by requiring the plaintiff to transfer \nownership of the shares to Lioncap Global, the security interest would be a \nmortgage. If Lioncap Global exercised that right so as to allow the plaintiff to \nretain ownership of the shares, it would be a charge. \n114 PCS para 65.\n115 DCS para 83.\nVersion No 3: 08 Dec 2023 (18:00 hrs)\nAcute Result Holdings Ltd v [2022] SGHC 45\nCGS-CIMB Securities (Singapore) Pte Ltd\n3483 In my view, the plaintiff\u2019s analysis is correct but incomplete. The \ndefendant\u2019s analysis is both correct and complete.\n84 Leaving aside for the time being security interests which are created by \nor under statute, a security interest is simply a right which X grants to Y \nconsensually, ie, by contract, for Y to exercise some sort of right over X\u2019s \nproperty upon X\u2019s default in performing an obligation. The obligation secured \nby the interest is typically a debt which X owes to Y. But it can be any type of \nobligation and can even be one which X owes, as in this case, to someone other \nthan Y.\n85 If the security interest includes Y\u2019s power to sell or compel a sale of the \nsecurity, the security interest is either a charge or a mortgage. If, in addition, the \nsecurity interest involves a transfer of ownership of the security or of some other \nproperty right in the security to Y, it is a mortgage. If the security interest does \nnot involve any such transfer, it is a charge: Carreras Rothmans Ltd v Freeman \nMathews Treasure Ltd and another [1985] Ch 207 at 227, cited in Roy Goode \n& Louise Gullifer, Goode and Gullifer on Legal Problems of Credit and \nSecurity (Sweet & Maxwell, 6th Ed, 2017) (\u201cGoode & Gullifer\u201d) at para 1-55.\n86 Creating a charge in favour of Y therefore transfers ownership of no \nexisting property right in the security to Y. The charge merely creates a new \nproprietary interest in the security and vests it in Y: Hugh Beale et al, The Law \nof Security and Title-based Financing (Oxford University Press, 3rd Ed, 2018) \n(\u201cSecurity and Title-based Financing\u201d) at para 6.52. That proprietary interest \nsubsists as an incumbrance on the security, ie as a restriction on X\u2019s unfettered \nright as owner to deal with the security, until X discharges the obligation or the \nincumbrance is otherwise released in accordance with the parties\u2019 agreement.\nVersion No 3: 08 Dec 2023 (18:00 hrs)\nAcute Result Holdings Ltd v [2022] SGHC 45\nCGS-CIMB Securities (Singapore) Pte Ltd\n3587 On the facts of this case, the security interest which the plaintiff created \nin favour of Lioncap Global was a charge. That is because Lioncap Global\u2019s \nsecurity interest attached to the shares without any transfer of ownership. \nInstead, under cl 3.01 of the security agreements, Lioncap Global directed the \nplaintiff to appropriate the shares to the security interest by delivering the shares \nto a dedicated account in the plaintiff\u2019s own name. Lioncap Global therefore \nacquired no ownership of or in the shares, and acquired only a right to have \nrecourse to the shares in the event the plaintiff defaulted on its debt to Lioncap \nAsia: Re Lin Securities (Pte) Ltd [1988] 1 SLR(R) 220 at [19]\u2013[21]. All of that \nmakes Lioncap Global\u2019s security interest in the shares a charge, not a mortgage.\n88 The plaintiff takes the position that it is not material for present purposes \nto characterise the true nature of Lioncap Global\u2019s security interest in the \nshares.116 I disagree. A resulting trust is definitionally incompatible with a \ncharge. That is the inevitable result of the defining characteristics of both a \nresulting trust and of a charge. One of the defining characteristics of a resulting \ntrust is a transfer of ownership of the transferor\u2019s property to the resulting trustee \n(see [ 68] above). One of the defining characteristics of a charge is that it does \nnot transfer any ownership of the security to the chargee (see [ 84] above). A \ntransfer of ownership being essential for a resulting trust to arise, a charge can \nnever give rise to a resulting trust. A transfer of property negating the creation \nof a charge, a resulting trust can never give rise to a charge. That is no doubt \nwhy the plaintiff no longer attempts to trace the origin of the resulting trust it \nrelies on to the plaintiff\u2019s entry into the November 2016 agreements and the \ntransfers of the shares into the plaintiff\u2019s account with CIMB Indonesia in \nJanuary and February 2017 pursuant to those agreements (see [ 19] above).\n116 PRS para 28.\nVersion No 3: 08 Dec 2023 (18:00 hrs)\nAcute Result Holdings Ltd v [2022] SGHC 45\nCGS-CIMB Securities (Singapore) Pte Ltd\n36The security agreements created an equitable charge\n89 Contrary to the plaintiff\u2019s submissions,117 the charge which Lioncap \nGlobal took over the shares was not a legal charge but an equitable charge. It is \nimmaterial that the recitals118 and cl 2.01119 of the security agreements describe \nthe security interest as a \u201clegal charge\u201d. The proprietary right created by a \ncharge arises and is recognised only in equity, not at common law. All charges \ncreated by contract \u2013 as opposed to those created by statute \u2013 are therefore by \ndefinition equitable charges. That is so regardless of whether the subject-matter \nof the charge is property which is recognised at law or in equity.\nThe subject-matter of the charge was the plaintiff\u2019s equitable interest in the \nshares\n90 The subject matter of the equitable charge which the plaintiff created in \nfavour of Lioncap Global is the plaintiff\u2019s beneficial interest in the shares, not \nthe legal interest. That is because the plaintiff never owned the legal interest in \nany of the shares. The legal interest in all shares traded on the Hong Kong Stock \nExchange is vested permanently in a nominee designated by the exchange. \nImmobilising the legal interest in this way allows trades on the exchange to be \nsettled scriplessly. Trades therefore settle without any conveyance of the legal \ninterest, ie without the need to present share certificates and transfer forms to \nthe company and without the delay, cost and paperwork that that entails. Trades \non the exchange therefore involve a transfer of only the beneficial interest in the \n117 PCS para 65.\n118 NSK p 654, 680.\n119 NSK p 657, 683.\nVersion No 3: 08 Dec 2023 (18:00 hrs)\nAcute Result Holdings Ltd v [2022] SGHC 45\nCGS-CIMB Securities (Singapore) Pte Ltd\n37shares traded. The only interest which the plaintiff ever had in the shares for \npresent purposes was a beneficial interest.120 \n91 The plaintiff held the beneficial interest in the shares at the end of a chain \nof trusts. That chain started from the nominee in whom legal title to the shares \nwas immobilised. That nominee held legal title to the shares on a bare trust. The \nbeneficial interest under that trust ran through a chain of financial \nintermediaries, such as custodians and nominees, to the plaintiff. Each link in \nthe chain held the bare equitable title to the beneficial interest in the shares on \ntrust, or more accurately sub-trust, for the next link in the chain. The final link \nin the chain is the plaintiff, in whom is vested not bare equitable title but the \nentire beneficial interest in the shares:121 Michael Bridge et al, The Law of \nPersonal Property (Sweet & Maxwell, 2nd Ed, 2018) (\u201cLaw of Personal \nProperty\u201d) at paras 6-050 and 6-051. The beneficial interest in the shares was \nthe only property in the shares which the plaintiff owned and could charge to \nLioncap Global. \n92 Regardless of the true legal position, however, I will in this judgment \nignore the chain of trusts by which the plaintiff as beneficial owner held these \nintermediated securities. I will treat the plaintiff as the absolute owner of the \nshares immediately before Lioncap Global\u2019s equitable charge attached to the \nshares upon delivery under cl 3.01 of the security agreements. When I refer to \nlegal title to the shares in this judgment, I therefore refer in reality to the bare \nequitable title to the beneficial interest in the shares. If the plaintiff cannot \nsucceed on this stylised analysis of the property rights in intermediated \nsecurities, it cannot succeed on any deeper analysis of the true legal position.\n120 DCS para 83(b). \n121 Transcript, 19 November 2020, p 10:9 to 13.\nVersion No 3: 08 Dec 2023 (18:00 hrs)\nAcute Result Holdings Ltd v [2022] SGHC 45\nCGS-CIMB Securities (Singapore) Pte Ltd\n38The plaintiff intended to confer a benefit on Lioncap Global\n93 It is not disputed that the first of the two elements necessary to give rise \nto a resulting trust (see [ 68] above) was satisfied when the plaintiff transferred \nthe shares to Lioncap Global in April and May 2017.122\n94 The plaintiff\u2019s case is that the second element necessary to give rise to a \nresulting trust was satisfied because the plaintiff\u2019s intention on 20 April 2017 \nremained the same as it was in November 2016: to do no more than create a \nsecurity interest in Lioncap Global\u2019s favour.123 The plaintiff\u2019s submission, in \neffect, is that an intention to create a security interest in favour of Lioncap \nGlobal negates any intention to confer a benefit on Lioncap Global and therefore \nsatisfies the second element necessary for a resulting trust to arise.\n95 As a matter of fact, as a matter of precedent and as a matter of principle, \nI do not accept the plaintiff\u2019s submission. An intention to create a security \ninterest in favour of a transferee suffices, in itself, to prevent the second element \nnecessary for a resulting trust to arise from being satisfied. The legal \nrelationship between the grantor and the grantee of any type of security interest \nis fundamentally incompatible with the relationship of trustee and cestui que \ntrust under a resulting trust.\n(1) Fact\n96 As a matter of fact, the plaintiff did intend to confer a benefit on Lioncap \nGlobal on 20 April 2017, when it entered into the April 2017 addendum. The \nbenefit was the contractual obligation which the plaintiff undertook in the April \n122 Transcript, 19 November 2020, pp 10:25\u201311:2 (Acute), 88:16\u201318 (CIMB Singapore).\n123 PCS para 70.\nVersion No 3: 08 Dec 2023 (18:00 hrs)\nAcute Result Holdings Ltd v [2022] SGHC 45\nCGS-CIMB Securities (Singapore) Pte Ltd\n392017 addendum to transfer the shares to Lioncap Global. This was factually a \nbenefit to Lioncap Global because Lioncap Global acquired a right which it did \nnot have before 20 April 2017.\n97 Further, the plaintiff actually conferred a benefit on Lioncap Global \nwhen it transferred the shares to Lioncap Global. Before the April 2017 \naddendum, Lioncap Global had only a charge over the shares, ie, a security \ninterest in the shares without a transfer of ownership of any property in the \nshares. By transferring the shares to Lioncap Global, the plaintiff improved \nLioncap Global\u2019s security interest in the shares. If, contrary to the plaintiff\u2019s \ncase, it transferred the shares to Lioncap Global intending to convey with them \nthe beneficial interest in the shares to Lioncap Global, the result is that the \nplaintiff converted Lioncap Global\u2019s charge into a mortgage. A mortgage is both \nde facto and de jure a stronger security interest than a charge. Transferring \nshares which are subject to a charge to the chargee so as to subject them to a \nmortgage is a de facto and a de jure benefit to the erstwhile chargee, and new \nmortgagee.\n98  On the other hand, if the plaintiff transferred the shares to Lioncap \nGlobal intending not to convey the beneficial interest in the shares to Lioncap \nGlobal, as the plaintiff submits (and even if I accept that that intention operated \nin equity by itself to separate the bare equitable title to the shares from the \nbeneficial interest in the shares) the transfer nevertheless conferred a factual \nbenefit on Lioncap Global. That benefit was to strengthen Lioncap Global\u2019s \ncontrol of the shares. Even on the plaintiff\u2019s own case, the transfer at the very \nleast ceded control of the shares to Lioncap Global. Ceding control in this way \n(even if doing so did not involve a transfer of ownership of any property in the \nshares to Lioncap Global) improved Lioncap Global\u2019s existing charge in a \nVersion No 3: 08 Dec 2023 (18:00 hrs)\nAcute Result Holdings Ltd v [2022] SGHC 45\nCGS-CIMB Securities (Singapore) Pte Ltd\n40practical sense. If nothing else, it tightened Lioncap Global\u2019s existing \nencumbrance over the shares by giving Lioncap Global control over the shares.\n99 In either event, I accept the defendant\u2019s submission124 that an intention \nto confer a factual benefit by creating or improving a security interest suffices \nin itself to prevent the second element necessary for a resulting trust to arise \nfrom being satisfied (see [ 68] above). I do not accept the plaintiff\u2019s submission \nthat only an intention to transfer the beneficial interest in the shares suffices to \nprevent the second element from being satisfied.125 So long as a transferor \nintends a transfer of property to confer a factual benefit on a transferee, the \ntransferee\u2019s conscience is unaffected by the transfer and equity does not \nintervene by separating legal title from beneficial interest by imposing a \nresulting trust.\n100 As a matter of fact, therefore, the plaintiff had an actual intention to \nbenefit Lioncap Global on 20 April 2017.\n(2) Precedent\n(A) MKC ASSOCIATES CO LTD V KABUSHIKI KAISHA HONJIN\n101 As a matter of precedent, as the defendant correctly points out,126 the \nrelationship between the grantor and the grantee of a security interest is \nfundamentally and conceptually distinct from the relationship between a \nbeneficiary and a trustee under a trust: MKC Associates Co Ltd v Kabushiki \nKaisha Honjin and others (Neo Lay Hiang Pamela and another, third parties; \n124 Transcript, 19 November 2020, p 92:25 to 93:3; p 93:27 to 94:4; p 95:1 to 15.\n125 Transcript, 19 November 2020, p 154:7 to 155:28.\n126 DCS para 75.\nVersion No 3: 08 Dec 2023 (18:00 hrs)\nAcute Result Holdings Ltd v [2022] SGHC 45\nCGS-CIMB Securities (Singapore) Pte Ltd\n41Honjin Singapore Pte Ltd and others, fourth parties) [2017] SGHC 317 \n(\u201cMKC\u201d) at [148]\u2013[151].

BRD and \nExodus provide users with a public wallet address and allow the private key to \nbe stored directly on the user\u2019s phone. BRD and Exodus wallets do not \nthemselves hold cryptocurrencies but rather manage the private key through \nwhich a user can access those cryptocurrencies (which are maintained on the \nBTC or ETH blockchain).11\n16 While the plaintiff had locked both his Exodus and BRD wallets with a \npassword, both wallets employed recovery seeds that could be used to recover \nthe passwords and could therefore allow him to gain access to the \ncryptocurrencies in the event that his mobile phone was lost or destroyed.12\n17 In January 2021, the plaintiff and seven acquaintances were on vacation \nat his apartment in Mexico. On the night of 7 January 2021, the plaintiff and \none acquaintance went out while the rest of the group remained at his apartment. \nAs he needed some money, the plaintiff called one member of the group at his \napartment, [E], and requested that [E] retrieve some cash that the plaintiff had \nkept in the safe in the master bedroom of his apartment. The plaintiff read the \nsafe combination to [E] and [E] repeated the combination to the plaintiff to \nconfirm that he had gotten it right.

The plaintiff therefore claimed that anyone \nin the apartment could have heard the safe combination being said out loud. [E] \nlater brought to the plaintiff the requested cash, and the three of them returned \nto the apartment at around 2.00am on 8 January 2021.13\n18 At around 8.00pm on 8 January 2021, the plaintiff accessed his Exodus \nand BRD wallets and discovered that his BTC and ETH had been withdrawn \nwithout his knowledge or consent.14\n19 The transaction records of the BRD and Exodus applications showed \nthat on 8 January 2021, the following transfers were made to three different \nwallet addresses that the plaintiff did not control or own:15\n(a) at 7.16pm, 59.38 BTC was transferred from the Exodus wallet to \nwallet address [address redacted];\n(b) at 7.17pm, 50.45 BTC was transferred from the BRD wallet to \nwallet address [address redacted]; and\n(c) at 7.19pm, 1497.54 ETH was transferred from the Exodus wallet \nto wallet address [address redacted].\n20 The plaintiff claimed that, since his mobile phone was with him when \nthe above transactions took place, the first defendants could not have effected \nthe transfers using the BRD and Exodus applications on his mobile phone. \nHence, the plaintiff believed that the first defendants obtained the plaintiff\u2019s \n13 Plaintiff\u2019s 1st Affidavit dated 27 May 2021 at paras 26 and 27.\n14 Plaintiff\u2019s 1st Affidavit dated 27 May 2021 at para 28.\n15 Plaintiff\u2019s 1st Affidavit dated 27 May 2021 at para 29; Plaintiff\u2019s Skeletal Submissions \ndated 4 June 2021 at para 10.\nVersion No 1: 04 Mar 2022 (11:26 hrs)\nCLM v CLN[2022] SGHC 46\n9recovery seeds by accessing his safe, sometime between the time he read the \nsafe combination aloud to [E] the night before and the time at which the \ntransactions were made. The first defendants entered the plaintiff\u2019s recovery \nseeds into the BRD and Exodus applications via a separate mobile device to \naccess the plaintiff\u2019s private keys, which they then used to transfer the Stolen \nCryptocurrency Assets.16\n21 Subsequently, the plaintiff\u2019s investigations and tracing efforts \ndetermined that the first defendants had dissipated the stolen assets through a \nseries of digital wallets.17 Ultimately, the relevant transfers are as follows:18\n(a) on or around 17 April 2021, 15.0 BTC traceable to the Stolen \nCryptocurrency Assets was transferred to wallet address [address \nredacted], which is controlled by the second defendant (the \u201csecond \ndefendant\u2019s account\u201d); and\n(b) on or around 25 April 2021, 0.3 BTC traceable to the Stolen \nCryptocurrency Assets was transferred to wallet address [address \nredacted], which is controlled by the third defendant (the \u201cthird \ndefendant\u2019s account\u201d).\n22 Hence, the plaintiff sought a proprietary injunction and a worldwide \nfreezing injunction against the first defendants, as well as ancillary disclosure \norders against the second and third defendants for information and documents \n16 Plaintiff\u2019s 1st Affidavit dated 27 May 2021 at para 30.\n17 Plaintiff\u2019s Skeletal Submissions dated 4 June 2021 at para 55(b).\n18 Plaintiff\u2019s Skeletal Submissions dated 4 June 2021 at para 11.\nVersion No 1: 04 Mar 2022 (11:26 hrs)\nCLM v CLN[2022] SGHC 46\n10relating to the accounts that were credited with the 15.0 BTC and 0.3 BTC that \nare traceable to the Stolen Cryptocurrency Assets.19\nMy decision\nJurisdiction against persons unknown\n23 As stated above (at [ 7]), the identity of the first defendants were \nunknown at the time of the application in SUM 2444. There is therefore a \npreliminary issue of whether the court has jurisdiction to grant interim orders \nagainst the first defendants even though their identities were unknown at that \ntime. The plaintiff submitted in the affirmative, with the following authorities \nin support.20\n24 In the UK, the jurisdiction to grant orders against persons unknown was \nrecognised in Bloomsbury Publishing Group Ltd and another v News Group \nNewspapers Ltd and others [2003] 1 WLR 1633 (\u201cBloomsbury\u201d). There, the \ncourt granted the plaintiff\u2019s application for an interlocutory injunction against \nunknown persons who had taken copies of an unpublished book, enjoining such \npersons to deliver up the copies of the book and restraining them from disclosing \nto any person any information derived from the book (at 1634). The court noted \nthat the UK Civil Procedure Rules (\u201cCPR\u201d) Practice Directions para 4.1(1) \nmerely required that the title of the proceedings \u201cshould state \u2026 the full name \nof each party\u201d [emphasis added] and not that a defendant must be named (at [16] \nand [19]). Moreover, the court considered CPR 3.10, which states as follows:\n19 Plaintiff\u2019s Skeletal Submissions dated 4 June 2021 at para 13.\n20 Plaintiff\u2019s Skeletal Submissions dated 4 June 2021 at para 25.\nVersion No 1: 04 Mar 2022 (11:26 hrs)\nCLM v CLN[2022] SGHC 46\n11General power of the court to rectify matters where there \nhas been an error of procedure\n3.10 Where there has been an error of procedure such as a \nfailure to comply with a rule or practice direction \u2014\n(a) The error does not invalidate any step taken in the \nproceedings unless the court so orders; and\n(b) the court may make an order to remedy the error.\nThe court noted that \u201c[CPR] 3.10 confers on the court a general power of \ndispensation where there has been a procedural error and provides that such \nerror does not invalidate any step taken in the proceedings unless the court so \norders\u201d (at [15]). From this premise, the court distinguished the pre-CPR case \nof Friern Barnet Urban District Council v Adams and others [1927] 2 Ch 25, \nwhere it was held inter alia that the prescribed form of writ required the \ndefendant to be named. Because of the different regime introduced by the CPR, \nthe court held (at [19]) that \u201c[t]he proper application of [CPR] 3.10 is \nincompatible with a conclusion that the joinder of a defendant by description \nrather than by name is for that reason alone impermissible\u201d. Importantly, the \ncourt set out the appropriate test as follows (at [21]):\n\u2026 The crucial point, as it seems to me, is that the description \nused must be sufficiently certain as to identify both those who \nare included and those who are not. If that test is satisfied then \nit does not seem to me to matter that the description may apply \nto no one or to more than one person nor that there is no further \nelement of subsequent identification whether by service or \notherwise.\n25 In CMOC v Persons Unknown [2017] EWHC 3599 (Comm) \n(\u201cCMOC\u201d), the plaintiffs claimed against unidentified defendants who \nmisappropriated \u00a36.3m by infiltrating the email account of the plaintiff\u2019s senior \nmanagement and issuing payment instructions without the plaintiff\u2019s \nauthorisation (at [1]). The court recognised Bloomsbury as authority for the \nproposition that the courts have jurisdiction to grant interlocutory injunctions \nVersion No 1: 04 Mar 2022 (11:26 hrs)\nCLM v CLN[2022] SGHC 46\n12against persons unknown and held that there was \u201cno reason in principle against, \nand indeed a good arguable case for, saying that this should extend to a freezing \ninjunction\u201d (at [4]). The court thereby granted the plaintiff\u2019s application for a \nworldwide freezing injunction against persons unknown, and ancillary \ndisclosure orders against certain banks who had received the stolen proceeds (at \n[9]\u2013[10]).\n26 In Zschimmer & Schwarz GmbH & Co KG Chemische Fabriken v \nPersons Unknown & Anor [2021] 7 MLJ 178 (\u201cZschimmer\u201d), the plaintiff, a \nGerman company, was defrauded by unidentified persons to make payments to \na bank account in Malaysia, which the plaintiff thought were genuine \ncommission payments to a South Korean business partner. In granting a \nproprietary injunction and a freezing injunction against persons unknown, the \nMalaysian High Court considered CMOC, and noted that it was affirmed by the \nUK Supreme Court in Cameron v Liverpool Victoria Insurance Co Ltd \n[2019] 3 All ER 1 and applied in at least two other English decisions (at [44]\u2013\n[48]). Importantly, the court reasoned as follows (at [40] and [49]):\n40 It is not usually the case that a defendant is described \nas \u2018persons unknown\u2019. Nevertheless, the court can grant \ninterlocutory orders against the first defendant \u2014 being persons \nunknown. In cases like the present which involve cyber fraud \nand fake email addresses, the fraudster or fraudsters are \nunknown. English case law have allowed for similar injunctive \norders against \u2018persons unknown\u2019. There is nothing in our \nRules of Court 2012 that would prevent the writ of summons \nand applications from being filed against persons unknown.\n\u2026\n49 As stated above, there is nothing in our Rules of Court \n2012 prohibiting the making of an order against persons \nunknown. In fact, O 89 of the Rules of Court 2012 for summary \nproceedings for possession of land allows for a defendant \nreference to persons unknown (see Fauziah bt Ismail & Ors v \nLazim bin Kanan & Ors (as person occupying GM 820, Lot 1642, \nMukim Kajang, Daerah Hulu Langat, Negeri Selangor Darul \nEhsan without the applicants\u2019 consent) [2013] 5 MLJ 423; [2013] \nVersion No 1: 04 Mar 2022 (11:26 hrs)\nCLM v CLN[2022] SGHC 46\n137 CLJ 37 (CA) the commentary in Foong\u2019s Malaysia Cyber, \nElectronic Evidence and Information Technology Law, para \n[8.098] to [8.100]).\n[emphasis added]\n27 In my view, the reasoning in the above authorities is instructive and \nreadily applicable to our legal context.\n28 To begin with, like in the case of the UK and Malaysia, there is nothing \nin our Rules of Court (Cap 322, R5, 2014 Rev Ed) (\u201cROC\u201d) that requires a \ndefendant to be specifically named. While the prescribed form for commencing \nan action by writ (Form 2 under Appendix A of the ROC) contains fields for the \nplaintiff to state the name and address of the defendant, O 1 r 7 of the ROC \nclarifies that: \u201cthe Forms in Appendix A to these Rules shall be used where \napplicable with such variations as the circumstances of the particular case \nrequire\u201d [emphasis added].\n29 Moreover, similar to CPR 3.10 in the UK (as relied on by the court in \nBloomsbury), O 2 r 1 of our ROC expressly provides that even if the \ncommencement of proceedings against persons unknown contravenes the ROC, \nsuch a contravention is treated as a mere irregularity, and will not result in the \nnullification of proceedings unless the court exercises its discretion to order the \nsame:\nNon-compliance with Rules (O. 2, r. 1)\n1.\u2014(1)  Where, in beginning or purporting to begin any \nproceedings or at any stage in the course of or in connection \nwith any proceedings, there has, by reason of anything done or \nleft undone, been a failure to comply with the requirements of \nthese Rules, whether in respect of time, place, manner, form or \ncontent or in any other respect, the failure shall be treated as \nan irregularity and shall not nullify the proceedings, any step \ntaken in the proceedings, or any document, judgment or order \ntherein.\nVersion No 1: 04 Mar 2022 (11:26 hrs)\nCLM v CLN[2022] SGHC 46\n14(2)  Subject to paragraph (3), the Court may, on the ground that \nthere has been such a failure as is mentioned in paragraph (1), \nand on such terms as to costs or otherwise as it thinks just, set \naside either wholly or in part the proceedings in which the \nfailure occurred, any step taken in those proceedings or any \ndocument, judgment or order therein or exercise its powers \nunder these Rules to allow such amendments (if any) to be \nmade and to make such order (if any) dealing with the \nproceedings generally as it thinks fit.\n\u2026\n[emphasis added in bold italics and italics]\nPlainly, the reference to \u201corder\u201d in the above provision covers interim orders \nsuch as injunctions.\n30 Furthermore, just as how O 89 of the Malaysian Rules of Court 2012 \nallows for a reference to persons unknown in summary proceedings for \npossession of land (as noted in Zschimmer), so does O 81 of our ROC, which \ngoverns the same. Order 81 r3 of the ROC provides as follows:\nForm of originating summons (O. 81, r. 3)\n3.  An originating summons filed under this Order shall include \nthe following note at the end thereof:\n\u201cNote: Any person occupying the premises who is not \nnamed as a defendant by this originating summons may \napply to the Court personally or by solicitor to be joined \nas a defendant.

{"casename":"2022_SGHC_50","fact":"'2\\u2003The applicant, Ms Kong Swee Eng (\u201cKong\u201d) had claimed trial to ten charges under s 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241, 1993 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe PCA\u201d) in the State Courts. Broadly, the ten charges were that she corruptly gave gratification to personnel in JSPL to induce them into favouring her business interests in Rainbow and DMH. Both companies were in the business of supplying shipping materials and parts, with JSPL being one of their principal customers. Importantly, in Rainbow\u2019s case, JSPL was its only customer. Kong directly or indirectly owned or was involved in both companies.', '3\\u2003To establish its case, the Prosecution had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Kong had given gratification to JSPL personnel, and that this gratification was an inducement or reward for a conferment of a benefit. The Prosecution also had to show that there was an objectively corrupt element in the transaction which Kong was subjectively aware of: see Public Prosecutor v Leng Kah Poh [2014] 4 SLR 1264 at [20].', '4\\u2003At first instance, Kong denied giving gratification for several of the charges. More importantly, she argued that there was a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with the then managing director of JSPL, Wong, and that this acted as a defence to the charges. The special relationship, according to Kong, was agreed sometime in 2003 or 2004 between (a) herself and Huan; and (b) Wong and the then CEO of JSPL, KK Tan Senior. Wong played an integral role in this relationship which continued until 2013. The special relationship was initiated by Wong who proposed that Rainbow give up all of its existing customers in return for being the exclusive supplier to JSPL. Whenever an order was intended to be placed by JSPL, Wong would email Kong to request that she send an invitation to quote. Following review of the quotation, Wong would indicate to Kong if the price was too high and invite her to lower it to meet his expectations. If she agreed, Rainbow would secure the job. Kong testified that although she would negotiate over price, she would ultimately capitulate since JSPL was Rainbow\u2019s only customer. This meant that, as a result of the special relationship, Rainbow was almost always guaranteed JSPL\u2019s custom. This was referred to as the \u201cspecial relationship defence\u201d.', '5\\u2003The upshot of Kong\u2019s position was that it was unnecessary for her to offer gratification to anyone in JSPL. In other words, even if she had given gratification, it was not an inducement or reward, and thus it was not tainted by an objectively corrupt element. It also followed that she did not have subjective guilty knowledge. Thus, the mental element of a charge of corruption would not be established.', '6\\u2003At first instance, Kong was acquitted of all ten charges by the Judge on the basis of the special relationship defence. The Judge found that Kong had met her evidential burden with regard to the existence of the special relationship, and that the evidential burden had shifted to the Prosecution to rebut it which it failed to do: see Public Prosecutor v Kong Swee Eng [2020] SGDC 140 at [30], [31], [47], and [57]. Crucially, he pointed out that the Prosecution ought to have called Wong to rebut the existence of the special relationship: at [58]. Accordingly, Kong was acquitted on all charges on the basis that there was no reason for her to bribe anyone in JSPL, which meant that there was reasonable doubt as to the elements of the charges: at [81]\u2013[83].', '7\\u2003The Prosecution appealed, arguing that the Judge had erred in finding that Kong had met her evidential burden in proving the existence of the special relationship. I heard the appeal and allowed it in part for several reasons. Relevant to the present application, I found that Kong had not discharged her evidential burden with regard to the special relationship. Accordingly, I found that the Prosecution did not need to rebut the special relationship: the GD at [56]. I went on to consider the ten charges faced by Kong and found that the Prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt for eight of the charges, and convicted Kong accordingly.

The defendant is an insurance company incorporated in Singapore.', '5\\u2003On 16 September 2013, the plaintiff and the defendant entered into Marine Cargo Insurance Policy No 92359646 (the \u201cPolicy\u201d) 4', 'under which the defendant would indemnify the plaintiff against any loss, damage or expense arising out of the transit of tin concentrate from Kigali, Rwanda to the port at Dar es Salaam, Tanzania and thereafter to Penang, Malaysia.', '6\\u2003The salient terms of the Policy were cll 8.1 and 11.1, which I set out below: 5', 'These clauses provide that the plaintiff\u2019s tin concentrate would be insured only for the period after the \u201ccommencement of the transit\u201d (the \u201cTransit Period\u201d).', '7\\u2003On 15 September 2017 and 30 May 2018, the plaintiff entered into two sale and purchase contracts with Excellent Mining for the purchase of nine shipments of tin concentrate. The contracts referred to the tin concentrate as cassiterite. 6', '8\\u2003I pause to set out the various stages involved in the transporting of the tin concentrate from Excellent Mining to the consignee, Malaysian Smelting Corporation Ltd (\u201cMSC\u201d) in Penang. This supply chain is undisputed but important to the present case: 7', '(a)\\u2003First, approximately 20 to 25 metric tonnes of tin concentrate for each of the affected shipments were procured by Excellent Mining from mines in Rwanda (including its own) and transported to Excellent Mining\u2019s premises in plastic bags which were secured with Precintia tags. These bags were then emptied onto the ground and the tin concentrate was mixed. Samples of tin concentrate were collected for analysis by a representative of Alex Stewart International Rwanda Ltd (\u201cAlex Stewart\u201d). After samples were collected, the tin concentrate was weighed and poured into empty drums through a hole using a funnel in the presence of the Alex Stewart representative. Once the drums were filled up, the holes of every drum (comprising a bung hole and a ventilation hole) were welded shut and sealed with Precintia clips by the Alex Stewart representative, in the presence of a representative from the International Tin Supply Chain Initiative (\u201cITSCI\u201d) and a Mineral Field Officer (\u201cMFO\u201d) from the Rwanda Mines, Petroleum and Gas Board (\u201cRMB\u201d). The lids of all drums were then applied with white alkyd paint by Excellent Mining\u2019s personnel. The ITSCI shipment number and\/or lot number and the addresses of both Excellent Mining and the plaintiff were written on the paint coating. As part of standard procedure, the Alex Stewart representative would take photographs of the sampling, weighing and packing process for record purposes. The sixth to the ninth shipments were sampled and sealed on 17 May 2018, 5 June 2018, 19 June 2018 and 28 June 2018 respectively. While waiting for a report on the samples by Alex Stewart, the sealed drums with the contents were kept in a yard surrounded by a compound wall in Excellent Mining\u2019s premises in Kigali, Rwanda. The plaintiff asserts that the compound of Excellent Mining was protected by security guards 24\/7 and closed-circuit television (\u201cCCTV\u201d) surveillance cameras.', '(b)\\u2003Second, for each shipment, when the drums were ready to proceed to Bollor\u00e9 Logistics Rwanda Ltd\u2019s (\u201cBollor\u00e9 Logistics\u201d) bonded warehouse (the \u201cBonded Warehouse\u201d) in Kigali, Rwanda, they were loaded into a 40ft container in the presence of the Alex Stewart representative. The loading into the container was done outside the Excellent Mining compound as the compound was not big enough for the 40ft container. When the drums were loaded into the 40ft container the Alex Stewart representative then affixed temporary seals on the container\u2019s doors.', '(c)\\u2003Third, the 40ft container was driven from Excellent Mining\u2019s premises to the Bonded Warehouse. This journey took approximately 45 minutes to one hour.', '(d)\\u2003Fourth, at the Bonded Warehouse, the 40ft container containing the drums will clear customs. The temporary seals on the doors of the 40ft container were broken and a further inspection was conducted by representatives from Alex Stewart, Bollor\u00e9 Logistics and the Rwanda Revenue Authority (\u201cRRA\u201d). After the inspection, the doors of the 40ft container were closed and sealed by the same representatives.', '(e)\\u2003Fifth, after clearing customs, the 40ft container was transported on land from the Bonded Warehouse in Kigali, Rwanda to the port in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The journey was 1400km to 1500km long and required overnight stops over several days.', '(f)\\u2003Sixth, the 40ft container arrived at Dar es Salaam and was parked at the Inland Container Depot.', '(g)\\u2003Seventh, in the presence of the representatives of the Tanzania Revenue Authority and Bureau Veritas (Bollor\u00e9 Logistics\u2019 surveyors) the seals of the 40ft container were broken and the drums were inspected by them. Thereafter, the drums were loaded into a 20ft container. The doors of the 20ft container were then sealed in the presence of representatives of the Tanzania Revenue Authority, Bureau Veritas and the liner shipping company. 8', '(h)\\u2003Eighth, the 20ft container was loaded on board a ship for a sea journey from Dar es Salaam to a port in Penang, Malaysia.', '(i)\\u2003Ninth, upon arrival in Penang, the seals of the 20ft container were broken in the presence of a receiver who would take delivery of the drums.', '9\\u2003Under the first sale and purchase contract dated 15 September 2017, the plaintiff was to take delivery of the first six shipments of the tin concentrate at the Excellent Mining premises. 9', 'This was the point of the \u201ccommencement of the transit\u201d within cl 8.1 of the Policy (see [6] above). Thus, it is undisputed that the insurance coverage for the sixth shipment of the 27 drums of tin concentrate weighing 18 metric tonnes started when the tin concentrate left Excellent Mining\u2019s premises, ie, from the third stage above (at [8(c)]).', '10\\u2003The second sale and purchase contract dated 30 May 2018 applied to the remaining three shipments of tin concentrate, ie, the seventh to ninth shipments. This contract states that the plaintiff was to take delivery as follows: 10', 'Again, this was the point of the \u201ccommencement of the transit\u201d within cl 8.1 of the Policy (see [6] above). From those terms, it is undisputed that the insurance coverage for the tin concentrate of the seventh to ninth shipments began (on a free carrier basis) upon clearance of customs at the Bonded Warehouse in Kigali, Rwanda. This meant that the Transit Period for the seventh to ninth shipments began from the fifth stage above (at [8(e)]). The details of these shipments are as follows:', '(a)\\u2003For the seventh shipment, there were 30 drums of tin concentrate weighing 20.4 metric tonnes.', '(b)\\u2003For the eighth shipment, there were 36 drums of tin concentrate weighing 22.675 metric tonnes.', '(c)\\u2003For the ninth shipment, there were 40 drums of tin concentrate weighing 25 metric tonnes.', '11\\u2003In total, under the sixth to the ninth shipments, the plaintiff was to take delivery of 86.075 metric tonnes of tin concentrate in 133 drums. For these shipments, the defendant issued marine cargo insurance certificates.', '12\\u2003 On or around 10 July 2018, the sixth shipment arrived at MSC in Penang, Malaysia. The seventh shipment was delivered to MSC on 25 July 2018. The eighth and ninth shipments were also delivered to the same place in Penang on 6 September 2018. 11', 'Upon the arrival of the respective shipments, it was discovered that the entire quantity of the tin concentrate had been replaced with iron oxide. Upon inspection by MSC and representatives of both the plaintiff and the defendant, it was revealed that the top portion of the drums had been cut and welded. The welding marks around the rim of each drum was well concealed with a thick layer of white alkyd paint. In this way, the welded hole of the drum with the security seal of Precintia clips remained intact.', '13\\u2003Upon the discovery of the thefts of the tin concentrate, the plaintiff sent notices of claim for the shipments to the defendant by e-mail on 17 July 2018 (sixth shipment), 31 July 2018 (seventh shipment) and 24 September 2018 (eighth and ninth shipments).', '14\\u2003On or around 3 October 2018, the plaintiff\u2019s representative, Mr Tambawala, and the defendant\u2019s expert, Dr Luigi Petrone (\u201cDr Petrone\u201d) from AqualisBraemar LOC, travelled to Rwanda. Dr Petrone went to Excellent Mining\u2019s premises and the Bonded Warehouse to conduct investigations into the transit of the sixth to the ninth shipments from Kigali to Dar es Salaam.', '15\\u2003On 7 May 2019, the defendant informed the plaintiff that its claims for the sixth to the ninth shipments regarding the swapped tin concentrate were rejected as the defendant\u2019s investigations revealed that the tin concentrate had been swapped with iron oxide at Excellent Mining\u2019s premises. Consequently, the defendant alleged that the plaintiff did not have an insurable interest as the loss did not occur during the Transit Period. Thus, the sixth to the ninth shipments were not covered by the insurance policy. 12', 'On 19 June 2019, the plaintiff made a formal demand for payment of its claims under the Policy by way of a letter, but the defendant has not made such payment to date. 13', '16\\u2003On 30 August 2019, the National Public Prosecution Authority of Rwanda (the \u201cNPPA\u201d) issued a report after conducting extensive investigations (the \u201cNPPA Report\u201d). It concluded that the thefts did not occur in Rwanda. The parties agree that such a report was issued.

Prior to OTPL, HLT and certain companies in the Xihe Group entering an insolvency process, their businesses were connected. Some of the companies within the Xihe Group (\u201cthe vessel-owning subsidiaries\u201d) owned vessels which OTPL, a ship chartering and ship management company, would charter principally under bareboat charters (some vessels were chartered under time charterparties). Xihe Holdings itself did not own any vessels. A large part of OTPL\u2019s fleet was vessels chartered from the vessel-owning subsidiaries. OTPL would sub-charter those vessels to or enter into contracts of carriage with HLT, which was one of Singapore\u2019s largest oil and related commodities trading companies at that time.

This proposal (ie, the ship management agreements) was, however, not accepted by the Xihe Group. It should be emphasised that the meeting was with the management of the Xihe Group \u2013 at this point, the entities in the Xihe Group were not in an insolvency process.

However, redelivery for the 41 vessels under the bareboat charters could not take place because the relevant vessel-owning subsidiaries: (a) had not obtained written consent from the mortgagees of the vessels to terminate the bareboat charters and take redelivery; and (b) required leave of court to take redelivery of the vessels during the interim judicial management period.', '9\\u2003Accordingly, on 6 July 2020, the relevant vessel-owning subsidiaries filed HC\/OS 652\/2020 (\u201cOS 652\u201d) to obtain leave of court for redelivery of 37 vessels that were the subject of bareboat charters with OTPL. It was unclear why leave was not sought for all 41 vessels. The OTPL JMs did not resist the application, maintaining their earlier position that they wished to redeliver the vessels. However, they made it clear that redelivery was subject to leave of court and the mortgagees\u2019 consent being obtained. Ultimately, no hearing date was fixed as the applicants were directed at a pre-trial conference on 21 July 2020 to obtain consent from the mortgagees to terminate the bareboat charters, and then to work out the terms of redelivery with the OTPL JMs.', '10\\u2003However, the discussions on the terms of redelivery did not reach a conclusion.

The Xihe JMs were appointed as interim judicial managers and took control of 28 vessels that were the subject of OS 652. The Xihe JMs were appointed judicial managers on 13 November 2020.

When I gave my decision, I stated that it was not made clear to me how many of the 76 vessels in SUM 2085 had Notices of Non-Adoption issued in relation to them. However, upon further review of the materials, it appears that Notices of Non-Adoption were issued in relation to 74 out of the 76 vessels that were the subject of SUM 2085. The remaining two vessels, the \u201cOcean Princess\u201d and the \u201cOcean Pride\u201d, were on time charters which were terminated on 4 June 2020 and redelivered by OTPL prior to the JM Order (see [8] above). Accordingly, Notices of Non-Adoption were not necessary. The Notices of Non-Adoption were also sent to the relevant mortgagees.', '12\\u2003The conduct of the Xihe JMs following the issuance of the Notices of Non-Adoption was significant as it represented a volte face compared to the position taken by the management of the Xihe Group. The Xihe JMs took the following steps. First, between 1 and 2 September 2020 they issued notices to the OTPL JMs retracting the Termination Notices, notwithstanding that they had been accepted by the OTPL JMs (subject to the conditions noted at [7]\u2013[8] above). Second, in response to the Notices of Non-Adoption, between 10 and 15 September 2020, they issued notices to the OTPL JMs affirming the bareboat charters. Finally, they sought leave to discontinue OS 652. Leave was granted on 28 September 2020.', '13\\u2003In response, on 1 October 2020, the OTPL JMs filed HC\/SUM 4257\/2020 (\u201cSUM 4257\u201d) to disclaim and terminate 96 bareboat charters as unprofitable contracts pursuant to s 332 read with s 227X of the Companies Act. Parties to SUM 4257 attended mediation and were able to resolve issues with regards to a large number of vessels. Accordingly, SUM 4257 proceeded only with regard to 57 vessels \u2013 52 of these vessels belonged to the subsidiaries of Xihe Holdings, while five belonged to Xihe Capital and its subsidiaries.', '14\\u2003On 23 November 2020, I heard SUM 4257 and granted leave for the OTPL JMs to disclaim the bareboat charters (\u201cthe Disclaimer Order\u201d). The Disclaimer Order contained consent orders pertaining to how redelivery of the vessels was to be effectuated and also stipulated that the vessel-owning subsidiaries and mortgagees would bear all costs for crewing, maintenance and upkeep that might be reasonably incurred from 10 November 2020 until redelivery. However, the Disclaimer Order was without prejudice to the rights of the vessel-owning subsidiaries to claim such amounts from OTPL.', '15\\u2003On 2 December 2020, M\/s WongPartnership LLP (\u201cWongP\u201d), solicitors for the Xihe JMs, wrote to M\/s K&L Gates Straits Law LLC (\u201cStraits Law\u201d), solicitors for the OTPL JMs (\u201cthe 2 December Letter\u201d). In the letter, the Xihe JMs reserved their right to lodge proofs of debt in the judicial management or winding up of OTPL for several categories of claim amounting to approximately US$156m. These included charterhire and costs for crewing, maintenance, upkeep, insurance, surveys and the repair of the vessels. Importantly, the 2 December Letter stated that (a) the claims would be lodged as priority claims that ranked pari passu with the OTPL JMs\u2019 remuneration and expenses, and (b) the OTPL JMs should preserve sufficient funds to meet these claims pending their adjudication.', '16\\u2003On 4 December 2020, the OTPL JMs wrote to OTPL\u2019s creditors, including the vessel owners, inviting them to submit their proofs of debt by 5.00pm, 18 December 2020. This was done to determine creditor voting entitlements at the first creditors\u2019 meeting that was to be held on 6 January 2021 (\u201cthe First Creditors\u2019 Meeting\u201d).', '17\\u2003On 15 December 2020, Straits Law responded to the 2 December Letter by e-mail. This e-mail simply noted the contents of the 2 December Letter, and stated that the OTPL JMs would carry out the administration of OTPL\u2019s affairs and funds as they deemed fit and in accordance with their obligations at law.', '18\\u2003On 18 December 2020, the Xihe JMs, on behalf of the vessel owners, filed proofs of debt. These proofs of debt labelled certain bareboat charter claims as priority claims. These were adjudicated for the purpose of determining voting entitlement, but there was no admission that the claims would be accorded any such priority.', '19\\u2003On 26 December 2020, WongP wrote to Straits Law and reminded the OTPL JMs to set aside sufficient funds to meet the claims. Several days later on 29 December 2020, Straits Law responded stating that the OTPL JMs did not agree that the claims in the proofs of debt amounted to priority claims, and that they would make an application to court to determine the issue. Several days later at the First Creditors\u2019 Meeting, the OTPL JMs clarified that they would not make any payment until the court gave directions on the issue concerning the claims.', '20\\u2003On 10 February 2021 and 1 April 2021, the Xihe JMs emailed the OTPL JMs stating that they agreed to pay certain crew wages that OTPL had claimed for November and December 2020. However, they also made deductions from these payments for certain repair costs they had incurred for several vessels. The OTPL JMs did not agree to such deductions on the basis that it was not clear what those costs related to.', '21\\u2003On 20 April 2021, WongP wrote to Straits Law to demand immediate payment by OTPL of further repair costs incurred by the Xihe JMs and the vessel owners in respect of ten vessels. These costs were estimated to be US$3,115,000 (\u201cthe 20 April Letter\u201d). This claim was made on the basis that OTPL had breached bareboat charters by failing to maintain and redeliver the vessels in good condition. The letter also stated that the Xihe JMs reserved their right to set off their claims for repair costs against amounts claimed by OTPL.', '22\\u2003Nine days later on 29 April 2021, a representative from the same auditing firm as the Xihe JMs e-mailed the OTPL JMs on behalf of the Xihe JMs on OTPL\u2019s claims for operational expenses with regard to a vessel that had not yet been redelivered. In this e-mail, it was asserted that OTPL\u2019s claim could be set off against the amounts it owed to various vessel-owning subsidiaries, including the costs of repair referred to in the 20 April Letter.'"}

Thus, the victim, V2, V4 and V5 were not allowed to eat for five days in total from the evening of 1 September 2018 to the night of 6 September 2018. The accused threw away all the food in the house, including all the raw and frozen food in their refrigerator. The accused did not cook and also told V6 that she was disallowed to cook.

There were large bottles of water in the refrigerator, but the accused bound these together with rubber bands so that he would know if the children tampered with them. 23', '24\\u2003The accused also cut off the electricity supply to their lights, refrigerator and air-conditioner.

For instance, V6 once managed to smuggle some packets of chicken rice to them to eat. On another occasion, V6 hid some biscuits and potato chips in their letterbox. V3\u2019s boyfriend then retrieved these snacks from the letterbox and smuggled them to the four children. 25', 'V3 also attempted to smuggle food from Subway into the Canberra Flat for her siblings, but the accused found out and threw the food away. 26', '26\\u2003On the night of 6 September 2018, which was the eve of V6\u2019s birthday, the accused permitted the victim, V2, V4 and V5 to eat plain rice.

Her shift started at 11.00pm and would end at 7.00am the next day. When she left home, the rest of the family was eating dinner at the table near the kitchen. 28', 'The victim was 13 years old at the time. 29', '28\\u2003After dinner, the accused went into the master bedroom and signalled the victim to go to his room after she finished eating her dinner. When the victim entered the master bedroom, the accused instructed her to return to the room about half an hour later with a towel. Sometime after 10.00pm, the victim entered the master bedroom and the accused told her to lock the door. The victim complied. 30', '29\\u2003The accused told the victim to wash her private parts in the master bedroom toilet and she complied. After the victim finished washing herself, she put on her clothes. When she opened the toilet door to go out, the accused asked her to go back into the toilet, so she did. The accused entered the toilet with her and asked her to remove all her clothes. He too removed all his clothes. Whilst standing, the accused started to kiss the victim on the lips. He held and licked her breasts, then asked her to suck his penis to make it erect. The victim squatted and began to fellate the accused. As she was doing this, he also squeezed her breast with his hand, which she found painful. 31', '30\\u2003After the victim had fellated the accused for a while, he asked her to kneel on the floor and bend over in a praying posture, with her head down and her hands stretched forward. The victim did so on the toilet floor. The accused tried to insert his penis into the victim\u2019s vagina from behind, but he could not. He also touched her vagina with his fingers and she felt a sharp pain as his fingernails were sharp. The victim told him that it hurt, but he told her to bear with it. 32', '31\\u2003When the accused failed to insert his penis into the victim\u2019s vagina from behind, he told her to lie on her back on the toilet floor. He then tried to insert his penis into her vagina again but was unable to. The victim told him that she was in pain because her back was lying on the raised boundary surrounding the shower area. The accused then led the victim out of the toilet and into the bedroom. 33', '32\\u2003The accused laid his towel on the bed in the master bedroom, which the victim lay on. The accused inserted his penis into the victim\u2019s vagina and moved it in and out. The victim told him that it was very painful, but he told her to bear with it. Her legs were bent at the knees and the accused held her legs apart. He moved his penis in and out of her vagina for a while, then turned her onto her side and continued having sex with her. After a while, the accused withdrew his penis and ejaculated onto the victim\u2019s stomach. 34', '33\\u2003The accused then told the victim to hold his ejaculate by cupping it against her body while walking to the toilet to prevent it from dripping. In the toilet, the accused washed his penis and told the victim to wash his ejaculate from her stomach and to wash her vagina. The victim complied and also took a shower. The accused told the victim not to tell anyone about what had happened. She then left his room. 35', '34\\u2003Sometime before midnight on 16 November 2018, V2 and V4 noticed the victim leaving the master bedroom after the final incident of rape (see [33] above). Finding it strange that the victim had showered there, they followed the victim and asked her what had happened. The victim then broke down and said that their father just had sex with her. She also revealed that this had been happening since she was in Primary 5. 36', '35\\u2003V2 persuaded the victim to file a police report. They decided to go to a police station far away from their house so that the accused would not look for them there. At around 12.21am on 17 November 2018, V2 and the victim left the Canberra Flat under the pretext of throwing rubbish. Instead, they ran down the stairs to go to a nearby block. They then took a Grab taxi which V2\u2019s boyfriend had booked for them to a police station at Bedok. 37', '36\\u2003On 17 November 2018 at about 1.37am, the victim lodged a police report at Bedok North Neighbourhood Police Centre to say that her father had been sexually assaulting her. The victim was subsequently brought to KK Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Hospital, where she was warded for a week. She then stayed at a children\u2019s home for about two weeks before returning home to the Canberra Flat. 38', '37\\u2003After the victim and V2 left the Canberra flat on 17 November 2018, the accused searched for them at three different police stations, to no avail. Between 6.34am and 7.52am on 17 November 2018, the accused visited ten different websites on how to pass a lie detector test. The websites he visited included a WikiHow article titled \u201c4 Simple Ways to Cheat a Polygraph Test (Lie Detector)\u201d and a Mirror Online article titled \u201cYou can fool a lie detector test with just one simple movement \u2013 and get away with it\u201d.

Dr Wong is presently an associate consultant in the Division of Obstetrics & Gynaecology at KK Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Hospital. On physical examination, Dr Wong noted that the victim\u2019s hymenal opening appeared irregular, with deep notches noted at 8, 10 and 11 o\u2019clock. A superficial 1cm vertical laceration was also noted at the victim\u2019s introitus, at the 6 o\u2019clock position. 40', '39\\u2003The accused was examined by Dr Vivekanandan Sivalingam (\u201cDr Sivalingam\u201d), a consultant from the Department of General Psychiatry of the Institute of Mental Health, on 7, 14 and 20 December 2018.

Several personnel from JSPL were involved or referred to in the present case, including:', '(a)\\u2003Wong Weng Sun (\u201cWong\u201d), who was at the material time JSPL\u2019s Managing Director.', '(b)\\u2003Chee Kim Kwang (\u201cChee\u201d), who was at the material time the head of JSPL\u2019s procurement department.', '(c)\\u2003Tan Kim Kian (\u201cTan\u201d), who was at the material time the senior manager of the \u201cBulk Section\u201d in JSPL\u2019s procurement department.', '(d)\\u2003Adam Abdullah Koay (\u201cKoay\u201d), who was at the material time a Deputy General Manager in JSPL\u2019s procurement department. He and the respondent knew each other for many years, having met in Malaysia prior to either one of them working in Singapore.', '(e)\\u2003Ng Poh Lin (\u201cNg\u201d), who was at the material time employed as a procurement officer in JSPL\u2019s procurement department.', '(f)\\u2003Chan Chee Yong \u201cDerek\u201d (\u201cChan\u201d), who was at the material time employed as an assistant section manager in JSPL\u2019s procurement department. Chan and Ng are husband and wife, having married in March 2013.', '(g)\\u2003Lau Kim Kiat \u201cMichael\u201d (\u201cLau\u201d), who, during the events leading up to the present case, was first employed as an engineer in the Piping and Design Section of JSPL from 2006 to 30 April 2013, and later as a project manager in DMH from 7 May 2013.', 'Over the course of trial, correspondence between the respondent and these persons were produced. The correspondence took place on work and personal emails, as well as the mobile messaging application WhatsApp (\u201cWhatsApp\u201d). The contents of this correspondence were crucial.', '5\\u2003In 2016, after investigations by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (\u201cthe CPIB\u201d), the respondent was charged with eleven counts of giving gratification to several persons in JSPL, under s 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241, 1993 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe PCA\u201d). The recipients of the gratification were all JSPL employees, and the majority of them were in its procurement department. The gratification included investment opportunities, overseas trips, alcohol, rental of the Flat, and employment. The respondent claimed trial, and ten charges were proceeded with which are reproduced below. Throughout the course of these grounds of decision, I will simply refer to them as \u201cthe 1st charge\u201d, \u201cthe 2nd charge\u201d, the \u201c3rd charge\u201d etc.', '6\\u2003The trial lasted 48 days. The respondent and Huan testified, along with many of the JSPL personnel referred to above at [4] who allegedly received gratification from the respondent. The Prosecution\u2019s case was that the respondent had given gratification to Chee, Tan, Koay, Chan, Ng and Lau, in order to advance her business interests in Rainbow and DMH. The respondent\u2019s case on most of the charges was that no gratification was given. Further, she argued that there was a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with key personnel in JSPL that served as a defence to all the charges (\u201cthe special relationship defence\u201d).', '7\\u2003The special relationship was allegedly agreed sometime in 2003 or 2004 between (a) the respondent and Huan, and (b) Wong and the then CEO of JSPL, Tan Kim Kuan (referred to as \u201cKK Tan Senior\u201d). As a result of the special relationship, Rainbow was essentially guaranteed JSPL\u2019s custom. As Rainbow was assured of JSPL\u2019s custom, the respondent argued that it was unnecessary for her to have given gratification to anyone to advance the business interests of Rainbow or DMH. At this juncture it is relevant to note two points. First, despite the importance of Wong\u2019s evidence on the special relationship defence, he was called by neither the respondent (to support the special relationship defence), nor the Prosecution (to rebut it). Second, though Wong was originally on the Prosecution\u2019s list of witnesses, it ultimately decided against calling him. Instead, Wong was offered to the respondent as a witness and his investigative statements were made available to her as well.', '8\\u2003The Judge acquitted the respondent on all the charges on the basis of the special relationship defence. This will be elaborated upon further below at [50]\u2013[51]. Briefly, he found that (a) the special relationship would have had the effect asserted by the respondent, and (b) she had discharged her evidential burden in this regard. Accordingly, he found that the evidential burden had shifted to the Prosecution to rebut the special relationship. The Judge was of the opinion that the Prosecution did not have sufficient evidence at hand to rebut the special relationship, and thus it ought to have called Wong as a witness for this purpose. As noted above, the Prosecution did not call Wong as a witness. As the Prosecution had not failed to rebut the special relationship, the Judge found that there was reasonable doubt on the mens rea for all the charges and acquitted the respondent without considering each charge specifically: see Public Prosecutor v Kong Swee Eng [2020] SGDC 140 (the \u201cGD\u201d) at [24], [30], [31], [47], [58] and [63].'"}

At the material time, he was concurrently performing duties as a National Parks Board (\u201cNParks\u201d) officer and a Safe Distancing Enforcement Officer appointed under s 35(1) of the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020 (Act 14 of 2020) (\u201cthe COVID-19 Act\u201d). His role as a Safe Distancing Enforcement Officer was to enforce compliance with the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020 (\u201cthe COVID-19 Regulations\u201d), as well as any other control orders made under s 34 of the COVID-19 Act, in order to minimise the spread of COVID-19. By virtue of s 35(7) of the COVID-19 Act, Safe Distancing Enforcement Officers are treated as public servants for the purposes of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) when exercising their powers in the course of their duties under Part 7 of the COVID-19 Act. 1', '7\\u2003The other parties involved are: 2', '(a)\\u2003A1, a 39-year-old female Singaporean. She is an NParks officer and was also concurrently performing duties as a Safe Distancing Enforcement Officer with the victim.', '(b)\\u2003Chew Chye Boon (\u201cA2\u201d), a 58-year-old male Singaporean. He is a passer-by who witnessed the accused\u2019s attack on the victim.', '8\\u2003On the morning of 4 May 2020, the accused decided to head to the Sungei Serangoon Park Connector (\u201cthe Park Connector\u201d) to pick some pandan leaves for cooking. The \u201cCircuit Breaker\u201d was still in force as of 4 May 2020, and individuals were not allowed to leave their ordinary place of residence in Singapore, except for the purposes permitted under reg 4(3) of the COVID-19 Regulations. 3', '9\\u2003Before 11.01am that morning, the accused hid two kerambit knives under the insoles of his shoes (with one kerambit knife hidden in each shoe). The kerambit knives each had an approximately 10cm-long blade. The accused intended to use the kerambit knives to cut the pandan leaves at the Park Connector.', '10\\u2003The accused then wore his shoes with the kerambit knives hidden in them and left the house. At about 11.01am that morning, he was captured on police camera footage walking down the staircase at level 3 of Block 252 without wearing a mask over his nose and mouth. By failing to wear a mask over his nose and mouth at all times when not in his ordinary place of residence, without any reasonable excuse, the accused contravened reg 3A(1)(a) of the COVID-19 Regulations, which contravention is an offence punishable under s 34(7)(a) of the COVID-19 Act. 4', '11\\u2003The accused collected his bicycle from the bicycle bay at the void deck of Block 252. He had previously taped a walking stick (\u201cthe walking stick\u201d) to his bicycle so that he could bring it along when cycling. The walking stick is nearly a metre long and has a wooden upper end. The lower end of the walking stick is a 20.8cm-long blade concealed by a wooden sheath with a black rubber stopper, which was in turn secured with tape. 5', '', '12\\u2003As the blade of the walking stick is capable of being used for cutting or stabbing, and can be concealed therein with the wooden sheath and rubber stopper, the walking stick is a scheduled weapon listed in the Second Schedule to the Corrosive and Explosive Substances and Offensive Weapons Act (Cap 65, 2013 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe CESOWA\u201d). The accused did not have any lawful purpose to be in possession of the walking stick. He thereby committed an offence under s 7(1)(a) of the CESOWA. 6', '13\\u2003The accused left Block 252 at about 11.04am and cycled to the Park Connector. There, he took out the kerambit knife hidden in his left shoe and cut some pandan leaves. He then put the kerambit knife back in his left shoe and placed the pandan leaves in his bicycle basket. 7', '14\\u2003The victim and A1 arrived at the Park Connector on an NParks buggy (\u201cthe buggy\u201d) shortly before 11.46am. They drove through the Park Connector and put up \u201cSafeEntry\u201d signs along the way. 8', '15\\u2003While driving the buggy, the victim spotted the accused near lamp post A9-2\/8 in the Park Connector and noticed that the accused was not wearing a mask despite being in a public place. The victim also observed that there were pandan leaves in the accused\u2019s bicycle basket. He surmised that the accused had obtained those pandan leaves from a plot at the Park Connector. 9', '16\\u2003The victim stopped the buggy about two to three metres away from the accused. While seated in the buggy, the victim asked the accused in English why he had cut the pandan leaves and whether he had a mask. A1 conveyed the victim\u2019s questions to the accused in Malay. The accused questioned why he needed to wear a mask. He further insisted that he was entitled to cut the pandan leaves. The victim and A1 then informed the accused that they were officers from NParks and that he was not allowed to cut the pandan leaves at the Park Connector. The accused remained insistent that he had the right to cut the pandan leaves. 10', '17\\u2003To diffuse the tension, the victim and A1 changed the conversation topic and asked the accused to wear a mask. The accused, however, grew more agitated. While repeating that he did not have a mask and that he did not wish to wear one, he retrieved the walking stick from his bicycle. 11', '18\\u2003The victim, acting in his capacity as a Safe Distancing Enforcement Officer, photographed the accused as evidence of the latter\u2019s failure to comply with the COVID-19 Regulations and asked for his particulars. The accused refused to provide his particulars. As the accused was uncooperative, the victim called the police at 11.46am and reported: \u201cREFUSE WEAR MASK AND GIVE HIS PARTICULAR [sic]. CAN POLICE GIVE A CALL WHEN ARRIVED [sic].\u201d 12', '19\\u2003While waiting for the police to arrive, the victim and A1, in the execution of their duties as Safe Distancing Enforcement Officers, explained to the accused the importance of wearing a mask. The accused responded by hurling the Hokkien vulgarities \u201ckanni nabey chao chee bye\u201d, which means \u201cfuck your mother\u2019s smelly cunt\u201d, at the victim. 13', '20\\u2003The victim in turn recorded a video of the accused on his mobile phone to collect evidence of the accused\u2019s abusive conduct. This angered the accused further. Without warning, the accused removed the wooden sheath on the walking stick to reveal its concealed blade before suddenly stabbing the left side of the victim\u2019s chest with the bladed end of the walking stick. The victim, who was seated in the buggy, was shocked to see the blade of the walking stick partially embedded in his chest. He grabbed the end of the walking stick and tried to pull the blade out of his chest. However, the accused entered the buggy and forcefully pushed the bladed end of the walking stick towards the victim\u2019s chest at least two more times. 14', '21\\u2003A1 screamed for help, alighted from the buggy and tried to pull the accused away from the victim. In the ensuing struggle, both the accused and the victim fell out of the buggy and onto the grass patch next to the road in the Park Connector. The accused dropped the walking stick as he fell from the buggy. A2 heard A1\u2019s screaming and approached the buggy. He saw the accused struggling with the victim and recorded a video of them falling out of the buggy with his mobile phone. 15', '22\\u2003While the accused and the victim were on the grass patch, the accused retrieved one of the kerambit knives (\u201cthe kerambit knife\u201d) from his shoe and attacked the victim by repeatedly slashing him with the kerambit knife. The victim tried to disarm the accused by grabbing the accused\u2019s right hand with his left hand. The accused was holding the kerambit knife in his right hand. However, the accused continued to struggle with and attack the victim while holding on to the kerambit knife. In the course of the struggle, the accused almost severed the victim\u2019s left thumb with the kerambit knife. 16', '23\\u2003As his left hand was weak and bleeding, the victim grabbed the accused\u2019s right hand with his right hand. The accused bit the victim\u2019s right hand in a bid to retain possession of the kerambit knife. A1 picked up the walking stick and hit the accused\u2019s hand with the blunt wooden end of the stick several times, but the accused continued biting the victim\u2019s right hand. The victim did not retaliate at all during the attack. 17', '24\\u2003A2 intervened, holding the accused\u2019s left hand down with his foot while trying to pry open the accused\u2019s right hand. He was unable to do so as the accused was gripping the kerambit knife very tightly. The accused eventually stopped biting the victim and dropped the kerambit knife. Despite his injuries, the victim managed to stand up. The victim, A1 and A2 ran away from the accused, who stood up and walked towards them aggressively but did not give chase. While running away, A1 called the police at 12.02pm. The victim, A1 and A2 stopped at Tampines Expressway towards Seletar Expressway before Punggol Road, where they waited for the ambulance and the police. 18', '25\\u2003After the assault, the accused put the wooden sheath with rubber stopper back on the walking stick and cycled home. He reached Block 252 shortly before 12.54pm and headed to the washing area at the void deck. After ensuring that there were no passers-by, he hid the walking stick in a concrete compartment that was covered with a metal lid. He returned home thereafter. 19', '26\\u2003The accused was arrested later that day at about 1.15pm, outside a 7-Eleven store at Block 210 Hougang Street 21, Singapore. Upon searching the accused\u2019s belongings, the police found a kerambit knife in each of the accused\u2019s shoes and a roughly 14cm-long knife blade (without a handle) in the accused\u2019s bicycle basket. On 5 May 2020 at about 10.45pm, the walking stick was recovered from the concrete compartment in which it had been hidden by the accused and was seized by the police. 20', '27\\u2003The victim was conveyed and admitted to Changi General Hospital, where he was examined by Dr Tan Hiang Jin (\u201cDr Tan\u201d). Dr Tan observed that the victim had sustained a left chest wall penetrating injury, a scalp laceration and multiple lacerations over his bilateral upper limbs and hands. 21', '28\\u2003Later that day on 4 May 2020, the victim was transferred to the Emergency Department of Singapore General Hospital (\u201cSGH\u201d) where he underwent general surgery and hand surgery concurrently. 22', 'Dr Soo Kian Tak (\u201cDr Soo\u201d) was one of the doctors who treated the victim at SGH. In a medical report dated 19 October 2020, Dr Soo noted that the victim had sustained the following injuries: 23', '(a)\\u2003\u201cScalp laceration measuring 5cm in length, did not reach periosteum\u201d.

He was given follow-up appointments with the Department of Hand and Reconstructive Microsurgery at SGH as his hand injuries were deemed to be of a more severe nature. 24', 'His hand injuries were treated by various SGH doctors, including Dr Huan Khian Wan Sarah Joy 25', 'and Dr Kang Yong Chiang (\u201cDr Kang\u201d). Dr Kang prepared a specialist medical report dated 24 June 2021 on the victim\u2019s hand injuries. The salient portions of the report are reproduced below: 26', '30\\u2003In total, the victim was given 89 days of medical leave from 4 May 2020 to 31 July 2020 (both dates inclusive). 27', '31\\u2003Dr George Paul (\u201cDr Paul\u201d), a senior consultant forensic pathologist from the Health Sciences Authority, issued a pathologist report dated 6 July 2020. Dr Paul made the following observations on the severity of the victim\u2019s injuries: 28', '(a)\\u2003The left chest wall laceration measuring 6cm in length (see [28(b)(i)] above) did not endanger the victim\u2019s life because the blade of the walking stick did not breach the victim\u2019s chest wall and enter the chest cavity. However, \u201cthe direction of the wound \u2013 towards the left border of the sternum and therefore the upper left side of the heart and the great vessels arising from it\u201d was such that the injury could have been life-threatening.', '(b)\\u2003The sternum puncture wound measuring 1cm (see [28(b)(ii)] above) \u201cwas stopped by the sternum-breast bone, and [had] travelled [a] further 3cm laterally or distally, in the superficial tissues\u201d. This wound would have had the potential for entering the heart and causing death if the bone had not stopped it.', '(c)\\u2003The victim\u2019s hand injuries could have resulted in massive haemorrhage and could have been life-threatening if not for prompt medical intervention.', '32\\u2003The accused was separately examined by two doctors, Dr Lin Hanjie 29', 'and Dr Yak Si Mian, 30', 'on 5 May 2020 at 5.20pm and 10.00pm, respectively. The accused was noted to have: (a) abrasions on his forehead; (b) mild abrasions with bruising just lateral to his left eye; (c) small, linear abrasions on his right wrist and left hand; (d) abrasions over his right ankle; and (e) two small linear abrasions behind his right ear. His physical examination was otherwise unremarkable. 31', '33\\u2003Dr Kenneth Koh (\u201cDr Koh\u201d) of the Institute of Mental Health conducted a psychiatric assessment of the accused following his arrest. Dr Koh examined the accused twice \u2013 on 8 May 2020 and 14 May 2020. Dr Koh reported the following findings: 32', '(a)\\u2003The accused has no mental disorder.

In fact, he was delivering diamorphine, and had been \nhanded a sum of S$2,300 for a previous delivery. The court observed that given \nthe large sum of money involved, he must have known that what he had \n29 AB 192, para 13 and 193, para 18. \n30 SOAF at para 3 and Schedule A, para 2. \n31 AB 129.\nVersion No 1: 25 Apr 2022 (18:12 hrs)\nPP v Gunalan Goval[2022] SGHC 62\n16previously delivered, and was again delivering, could not have been betel nuts: \nat [43].\n38 Similarly, I find that the substantial payment of an average of S$2,630 \n(RM7,890) per bundle goes against the Accused\u2019s claim that he thought they \nwere merely wrongful reading books.\n39 The Defence submitted that the collection of S$5,260 on the third \noccasion was at best a neutral factor, for the Accused had not collected any \nmoney on the first two occasions when he had delivered bundles for \u201cSiva\u201d.32 \nThe Defence asked, rhetorically, \u201cMight the relatively large sum collected \nduring the third delivery job have been intended to cover the cost of the \u201cbooks\u201d \ndelivered for the first and second jobs as well?\u201d33 There is no evidence on the \npoint, and I consider it unlikely that payment for the first two deliveries would \nbe deferred until the third job. But even if the S$5,260 collected was meant to \ncover the cost of the three deliveries in total, the amount of that payment would \nstill go against the Accused\u2019s claim that he thought he was delivering wrongful \nreading books, which would likely not cost over S$5,000.\n(2) What the Accused received for delivering the bundles\n40 In the Contemporaneous Statement, the Accused said he was paid \nRM200 for delivering each \u201cbook\u201d.34 In his third long statement recorded on \n22 March 2019, he changed that to RM200 for every \u201cjob\u201d35 \u2013 which he \nexplained meant he was paid RM200 per trip (in his ninth long statement \n32 Further Closing Submissions of the Defence, para 27.\n33 Further Closing Submissions of the Defence, para 28.\n34 AB 129.\n35 AB 204, para 61; AB 208, para 77.\nVersion No 1: 25 Apr 2022 (18:12 hrs)\nPP v Gunalan Goval[2022] SGHC 62\n17recorded on 28 March 2019).36 He said he had lied in the Contemporaneous \nStatement about receiving RM200 per \u201cbook\u201d because he was scared from \nhaving been arrested.37 This would mean the Accused had lied about receiving \nmore money than he was actually paid, because he was scared. \n41 I doubt that explanation. But whether the Accused was paid RM200 per \n\u201cbook\u201d, or RM200 per trip, it was more than what his employer paid him \u2013 \nwhich was only RM120\u2013125 per trip from Malaysia to Singapore to deliver \ngoods including pellets, detergents and bread (with his monthly salary averaging \nRM3,500).38 This further supports the conclusion that he did not think the \n\u201cbooks\u201d were merely wrongful reading books. \n42 In Saravanan, the accused person claimed he believed he was \ntransporting tobacco, not drugs. He was paid either S$5,000 (per the statement \nof facts), or RM2,000 (the figure given by him at trial). The court noted that in \neither case, it undermined the economics of a deal that purportedly involved \ntobacco worth at most RM7,000 on the accused person\u2019s own evidence: \nSaravanan at [35(d)]. Here, both the amounts the Accused collected from third \nparties, and what he was paid for making the deliveries, suggest that he was not \nmerely carrying wrongful reading books, and that the Accused knew that.\n43 It is also notable that the Accused gave inconsistent accounts of whether \nhe had actually received payment from \u201cSiva\u201d, or just a credit in reduction of a \nloan he had taken from \u201cSiva\u201d. In his long statements, he said that he was paid \nby \u201cSiva\u201d transferring the money into his Maybank account.39 At trial, however, \n36 AB 238, Qn and Ans 15a.\n37 AB 261, Qn and Ans 52a \u2013 52c.\n38 AB 214, paras 103 \u2013 105.\n39 AB 204, para 61; AB 208 \u2013 211, paras 77, 81 and 88; AB 214 \u2013 215, para 105.\nVersion No 1: 25 Apr 2022 (18:12 hrs)\nPP v Gunalan Goval[2022] SGHC 62\n18the Accused said that this statement about \u201cSiva\u201d paying him RM200 for every \njob was not true.40 He said, the truth was that he had borrowed some RM3,000 \nfrom \u201cSiva\u201d, and RM200 was deducted from that loan for every job he did for \n\u201cSiva\u201d. He said he did not inform the investigator about the loan from \u201cSiva\u201d as \nit was his \u201cpersonal thing\u201d. This explanation makes no sense \u2013 the Accused had \nshared with the investigator various personal matters about his family, and he \ncould not explain why the supposed loan from \u201cSiva\u201d was even more personal, \nsuch that he would decline to mention it, and instead lie about receiving \npayments into his Maybank account.41 Perhaps the Accused considered it \nsomehow advantageous to say there was a deduction from what he owed \u201cSiva\u201d, \nrather than payments received through his bank account, but the distinction does \nnot help him. In any event, it damages his credibility to have either lied to the \ninvestigator, or lied to the court.\n(3) Both \u201cSiva\u201d and the Accused viewed the deliveries as dangerous \ntransactions\n44 The Accused said in his long statements that \u201cSiva\u201d had told him that \nbringing the \u201cbooks\u201d into Singapore was a dangerous job,42 and that he had \ninitially told \u201cSiva\u201d that he did not want to do the job because it was dangerous \nand he was scared.43 He said he still chose to do it despite being scared: \u201cThe \n40 NE, 2 November 2021, page 7 lines 1 \u2013 18.\n41 NE, 2 November 2021, page 35, lines 16 \u2013 28; page 39, lines 20 \u2013 28; page 72 line 28 \n\u2013 page 73, line11; 3 November 2021, page 4, line 4 \u2013 page 8 line 17.\n42 AB 204, para 61; AB 223, Qn and Ans 3a.\n43 AB 206, para 69, AB 220, Qn and Ans 1a.\nVersion No 1: 25 Apr 2022 (18:12 hrs)\nPP v Gunalan Goval[2022] SGHC 62\n19only one reason is for the money.\u201d44 This extract from his third long statement \ngives a flavour of the Accused\u2019s thinking in that regard:45\n64. [\u201cSiva\u201d] did not explain what this \u201cbook\u201d was about. He \nonly said it was a dangerous job because I had to deliver the \n\u201cthing\u201d to someone in Singapore and that I had to be very \ncareful when doing this job and also be very careful when \ndelivering the \u201cthing\u201d to someone in Singapore. He did not \nmention any reason on why I needed to be careful. He also did \nnot explain why it was dangerous. He just told me to be careful \nand that was all.\n65. I did not ask him why I had to be careful. I did not ask \nhim why it was dangerous. I did not ask him what was that \n\u201cthing\u201d\/\u201dbook\u201d about. I did not ask him why I needed to collect \nthe money from the people in Singapore. I did not bother much \nand did not ask him anything because all I wanted was the \nmoney from him.\n45 In a later statement, the Accused sought to recast the above, to say he \nthought his deliveries for \u201cSiva\u201d were dangerous because if his boss found out, \nhe would be sacked from his job as a delivery driver.46 This does not sit well \nwith his earlier statements, which included him saying that he was scared to \nbring the \u201cthings\u201d into Singapore \u201c[b]ecause [he] needed to pass through \ncustoms and bring the thing into Singapore.\u201d47 Moreover, on his own account, \nhe knew that he was smuggling something illegal into Singapore, save that he \nclaimed he believed it was just wrongful reading books, not drugs. His concern \nabout the deliveries of the \u201cbooks\u201d being dangerous was not limited to the fear \nof losing his job as a delivery driver \u2013 he knew he was breaking the law.\n44 AB 220 \u2013 221, Qn and Ans 1b \u2013 1e; AB 222, Qn and Ans 2d, 2e; AB 223, Qn and Ans \n3e, 3f; AB 225, Qn and Ans 4e \u2013 4g.\n45 AB 205, paras 64 \u2013 65.\n46 AB 225 \u2013 227, Qn and Ans 5b \u2013 5j.\n47 AB 223, Qn and Ans 3b \u2013 3c.\nVersion No 1: 25 Apr 2022 (18:12 hrs)\nPP v Gunalan Goval[2022] SGHC 62\n2046 I find that the Accused\u2019s statements about the deliveries being \ndangerous, and him being scared, do not support his assertion that he thought \nthe books were merely wrongful reading books. They suggest that he knew he \ncould get into more serious trouble, than if he were merely delivering wrongful \nreading books. Moreover, he had not \u2013 when expressing his concerns about \ncarrying out the deliveries \u2013 said in his statements that he thought he was \ndelivering wrongful reading books.\n47 It is unlikely that the Accused would simply have accepted that the \nbundles were \u201cbooks\u201d as \u201cSiva\u201d had allegedly told him. The Defence submitted \nthat unlike the accused person in Mohamed Shalleh, the Accused had no \nknowledge that \u201cSiva\u201d was involved in illegal activity.48 However, this is not \nborne out by the Accused\u2019s testimony, which was merely to the effect that he \ndid not know \u201cSiva\u2019s\u201d background or whether \u201cSiva\u201d was a licenced \nmoneylender.49 Nor is the Defence\u2019s contention supported by the other evidence \nhere, specifically:\n(a) the Accused himself described the \u201cthings\u201d he was carrying, as \nwrongful reading books;\n(b) both \u201cSiva\u201d and the Accused regarded the job as a dangerous one \n(see [ 44]\u2013[ 46] above);\n(c) the Accused was fearful because he needed to pass through \ncustoms and bring the \u201cthings\u201d into Singapore (see [ 45] above); and\n48 Further Closing Submissions of the Defence, para 19.\n49 NE, 2 November 2021, page 9, lines 20 \u2013 23. \nVersion No 1: 25 Apr 2022 (18:12 hrs)\nPP v Gunalan Goval[2022] SGHC 62\n21(d) the Accused had surrendered the \u201cthings\u201d to Sgt3 Syazwan when \nhe was asked if he had anything to surrender (see [ 13] above).50\n48 In those circumstances, the Accused would have \u201cproceed[ed] with \ncaution in his dealings\u201d with \u201cSiva\u201d rather than believed whatever \u201cSiva\u201d had \nsaid about the things he was asked to carry (Mohamed Shalleh at [34]). \n(4) The checks done by the Accused on the bundles\n49 The Accused gave different accounts of whether he had checked the \n\u201cbooks\u201d only on the fourth occasion (when he was arrested), or also on the \nearlier three occasions when he had delivered bundles for \u201cSiva\u201d. He also gave \ndifferent accounts of whether he could properly see the \u201cthings\u201d in the bag.\n50 In his second long statement recorded on 21 March 2019, the Accused \nsaid that on each of the four occasions that he had delivered the \u201cthings\u201d, he had \nopened the bags in which the \u201cthings\u201d were, and checked them.51\n51 In his seventh long statement recorded on 26 March 2019, however, he \nsaid he had only checked the \u201cthings\u201d in the bag on the fourth occasion, just \nbefore he was arrested.52 That was also his position at trial.53 At trial, he also \nsought to deny having said in his second long statement that he had checked the \n\u201cthings\u201d on the three previous occasions. He could not, however, explain why a \ndifferent account was provided in his second long statement, or why he had not \nasked to correct it after the second long statement was read back to him in \n50 AB 108, para 9.\n51 AB 198, para 32.\n52 AB 227, Qn and Ans 7.\n53 NE, 2 November 2021, page 51, line 3.\nVersion No 1: 25 Apr 2022 (18:12 hrs)\nPP v Gunalan Goval[2022] SGHC 62\n22Tamil.54 On this, I find that the Accused had, as recorded in his second long \nstatement, checked the \u201cthings\u201d on all four occasions. This is how it was \nrecorded:55\n32. Normally, I would only take the bag and opened [sic] to \nsee before the person comes and collect the thing. This is the \nsame for all the previous three times that I brought the \u201cthings\u201d \ninto Singapore. Because I am very scared to do all these things, \nso I would only open the bag to check before the person comes \nand collect the \u201cthings\u201d.\n52 The Accused also provided inconsistent accounts of whether he had \ntouched the \u201cthings\u201d. At trial, the Accused said that when he had checked the \n\u201cthings\u201d on the fourth occasion, just before he was arrested, it was dark inside \nthe trailer as he had not switched on the light.56 He also said that he had unzipped \nthe bag but had not touched the \u201cthings\u201d.57 That was also the position stated in \nhis second long statement recorded on 21 March 2019:58\n27 \u2026 I turned over to the back passenger seat, reached for \nthe black colour school bag, and then opened the zip. I looked \ninside that bag but did not place my hand inside the bag. I did \nnot touch anything inside the bag. When I looked inside that \nbag, I saw the \u201cthings\u201d in bundles and bundles. I saw the three \n\u201cthings\u201d. It seemed to be like a book all stacked up.\n28 One of the bundles was inside a white plastic bag. The \nother two bundles were not inside any plastic bag, but were \nplaced on top of a cloth. I think it was a black colour cloth which \nlooked like a shirt. I think so only, I cannot confirm the exact \ncolour of the cloth but I can confirm it was a dark colour cloth. \nI can also confirm it looked like a t-shirt. I cannot confirm if \nthat t-shirt has a collar but it definitely looked like a t-shirt to \nme.

Indeed, he said that he \nhad brought one of the \u201cthings\u201d a bit forward and then pushed it back inside the \nbag.59 That was a reference to the bundle that was in a white plastic bag (as \nshown in Photo 11), although the Accused said he was not sure if he had touched \nthe bundle itself, or the plastic bag holding it. The Accused was specifically \nreferred to para 27 of his second long statement (quoted at [ 52] above) where \nhe said he had not touched anything in the bag; he was asked which version of \nevents was correct, and he maintained that he had touched the \u201cthings\u201d.\n54 The Accused continued to maintain that he had touched the \u201cthings\u201d in \nhis tenth long statement recorded on 29 March 2019 \u2013 he again said that para 27 \nof his second long statement (where he said he had not touched the \u201cthings\u201d), \nwas wrong.60\n55 At trial, however, the Accused reverted to saying that he had not touched \nthe \u201cthings\u201d in the bag.61 He could not explain his vacillating positions, except \nto say that he was very confused.62 The statements do not, however, bear out \nthis alleged confusion: in his eighth long statement, the Accused had described \nin some detail which of the \u201cthings\u201d he had touched, why he had touched them, \n59 AB 235 \u2013 236, Qn and Ans 12j to 13f; AB 270.\n60 AB 256, Qn and Ans 42.\n61 NE, 2 November 2021, page 57, line 9 \u2013 page 59, line 10.\n62 NE, 2 November 2021, page 57, line 9 \u2013 page 59, line 10.\nVersion No 1: 25 Apr 2022 (18:12 hrs)\nPP v Gunalan Goval[2022] SGHC 62\n24and the manner in which he had touched them. In particular, the Accused had \nexplained that he had touched the \u201cthings\u201d because he had to count them, and \nadded that he had even pulled one of the \u201cthings\u201d a bit forward and then pushed \nit back, specifically identifying the one of the three bundles that was in the white \nplastic bag (see [ 53] above). Moreover, he maintained this on a separate \noccasion when his tenth long statement was recorded, further confirming that \nthe version of events stated in the second long statement was incorrect (see [ 54] \nabove). Notably, he did not say at any time in the statement recording process \nthat he was confused.\n56 On a related note, in his second long statement, the Accused described \nthe \u201cthings\u201d in some detail (see the extract quoted at [ 52] above), and that is \ninconsistent with his claim at trial that he had simply looked into the bag, with \nthe light off. This suggests that even if the light was off, he was still able to see \nwhat he had described in his statements.\n57 In any event, I find that the Accused had touched the bundles, as he had \nadmitted in his eighth and tenth long statements. His having checked and \ntouched the bundles is consistent with his ability to describe them as looking \nlike packets (see [ 32(c)]\u2013[ 33] above), with other details besides (see [ 52] \nabove). This goes against his main defence that he thought they were wrongful \nreading books.\n58 The Accused seemed to be distancing himself from the contents of the \nbag, so as to deny knowledge of what they were. When confronted about why \nhe thought the \u201cthings\u201d in the bag were \u201cbooks\u201d despite not having touched \nthem, he started by saying \u201cwhat was told to me [was] that it was books and it \nlooked like books to me\u201d. He was then asked how he could say they looked like \nreading books if the cab was dark, and his responses were: \u201cBecause Siva told \nVersion No 1: 25 Apr 2022 (18:12 hrs)\nPP v Gunalan Goval[2022] SGHC 62\n25me that it was books.\u201d and \u201cWhat was informed to me, that it was books. That\u2019s \nall.\u201d63 \n59 It is significant that the Accused\u2019s fallback was that \u201cSiva\u201d said the \n\u201cthings\u201d were \u201cbooks\u201d, rather than that the Accused himself thought they were \n\u201cbooks\u201d because of what they looked like to him. This was reminiscent of what \nhe said in his eighth long statement (discussed at [ 32(c)]\u2013[ 33] above): \u201cSiva\u201d \nreferred to the \u201cthings\u201d as \u201cbooks\u201d, and the Accused assumed that they were \nbooks because \u201cSiva\u201d said so, not because the \u201cbooks\u201d looked like reading \nbooks. Indeed, when he checked them, they looked like packets, not reading \nbooks.\n60 As the Court of"}

It submitted that it sufficed to simply assert the existence of a dispute, which it had done so. 25', '(b)\\u2003Second, there was a dispute over the legality and enforceability of the Loan Facility as there was a triable issue of whether the interest charged under the Loan Facility was exorbitant and excessive. 26', 'IEL was referring to the amount of interest claimed in the SD (US$841,028.76), of which US$28,747.40 was accrued interest and US$812,281.36 was default interest. 27', '(c)\\u2003Third, there was a dispute over whether MMI was entitled to claim the entirety of the Loan Sum because part of that amount (the sum of US$750,000) had been extended by MMT. 28', 'It was argued that MMI had not furnished any consideration in respect of that loan amount of US$750,000.', '16\\u2003At the 14 Jul Hearing, counsel for IEL also advanced a further argument as to why CWU 81 should be dismissed. He said, without further explanation or elaboration, that the parties were in \u201cnegotiations\u201d about a possible investment by MMI at the time the SD was served and hence the Loan Sum was \u201cnot due\u201d because there was an agreement that MMI would \u201chold on\u201d from recalling the Loan Facility. 29', 'However, this argument was unsubstantiated by any affidavit evidence. In response, counsel for MMI argued that there was no legal basis for that submission because item 4 of the Letter of Intent (see [8] above), which dealt with the Proposed Investment and provided for the amounts owing by IEL to be set off against any investment sum paid, had been expressly described as not legally binding. Further, it was Mr Ghai (rather than IEL) that had been a party to the Letter of Intent. 30', '17\\u2003At the conclusion of the 14 Jul Hearing, I considered that IEL had not satisfied the court that there had been even a prima facie dispute over its liability for the Outstanding Sum. In connection with the first dispute over the amount repayable, counsel for IEL accepted that IEL\u2019s affidavit offered no particulars of the alleged cross-claim and whether it exceeded the Outstanding Sum. As for the second dispute over the enforceability of the Loan Facility, counsel for IEL also could not articulate the legal basis for challenging the enforceability of the Loan Facility. As for the third dispute over whether consideration had been provided by MMI in respect of US$750,000 under the Loan Facility, I did not consider that to be any dispute at all. Clause 2 of the Loan Facility made it clear that the sum of US$750,000 was deemed repaid to MMT and reborrowed by IEL from MMI under the Loan Facility. MMI would have provided consideration by its extension of a further sum of US$860,000 to IEL. Thus, I considered that there were no grounds for dismissing and\/or staying CWU 81 in favour of arbitration.', '18\\u2003Given IEL\u2019s failure to make any payment, or secure or compound the Outstanding Sum under the SD within three weeks of its service, it was deemed unable to pay its debts within the meaning of s 125(1)(e) of the IRDA pursuant to the presumption of insolvency in s 125(2)(a). I was therefore of the view that the grounds for winding up IEL were made out and ordered so accordingly.', '19\\u2003For completeness, I would add that, even if there were any merits in the dispute over whether consideration had been provided by MMI in respect of US$750,000 owing under the Loan Facility, or IEL\u2019s contention that the interest charged under the Loan Facility was exorbitant and excessive, there would have been, at the very least, an undisputed sum of US$860,000 (US$1.61m less US$750,000) and interest or US$1.61m (the Outstanding Sum less interest) that was due and outstanding. Either sum was well in excess of the statutorily-prescribed minimum in s 125(2)(a) of the IRDA and IEL\u2019s refusal to pay any sum at all would still trigger the operation of the presumption of insolvency in s 125(2)(a) of the IRDA (see Re Sanpete Builders (S) Pte Ltd [1989] 1 SLR(R) 5 at [59]).', '20\\u2003On 19 July 2021, the then-solicitors for IEL, Christopher Bridges Law Corporation (\u201cCBLC\u201d), wrote a letter to court (\u201cthe 19 Jul Letter\u201d) requesting further arguments for CWU 81. 31', 'In the 19 Jul Letter, CBLC explained that IEL\u2019s subsidiaries in Myanmar had sufficient cash and assets and so IEL was able to pay the debt claimed by MMI. The 19 Jul Letter also set out a proposed timeline for repayment of the Outstanding Sum by IEL. In short, CBLC indicated that it wanted to make further arguments that IEL was not insolvent and could meet MMI\u2019s demand for repayment.', '21\\u2003On 22 July 2021, MMI\u2019s solicitors, Allen & Gledhill LLP (\u201cA&G\u201d), wrote a letter to court in reply to the 19 Jul Letter. 32', 'A&G submitted that IEL\u2019s request for further arguments should be rejected and the winding-up order ought to stand because, inter alia, the arguments which IEL wanted to make in its request for further arguments could and should have been raised during the 14 Jul Hearing.', '22\\u2003In the meantime, IEL changed its solicitors to Mallal & Namazie LLP (\u201cM&N\u201d). On 22 July 2021, M&N wrote a letter to court, responding to A&G\u2019s letter of that same date. 33', 'It stated that IEL faced logistical difficulties in transferring funds outside of Myanmar to effect payment to MMI and that the earliest it could do so was 27 July 2021. It proposed that the winding-up order made at the 14 Jul Hearing be stayed for three weeks.', '23\\u2003On 22 July 2021, I agreed to hear further arguments and directed IEL to file and serve an affidavit in support of its further arguments by 26 July 2021, and for MMI to file its responsive affidavit by 2 August 2021. I also directed that MMI was not to extract the winding-up order made at the 14 Jul Hearing, until the hearing of the further arguments and any decision made thereon.', '24\\u2003On 26 July 2021, IEL filed an affidavit by Mr Ghai in support of its further arguments. The affidavit raised the following points:', '(a)\\u2003AG Asset Management Co Ltd had about US$800,000 in cash, as well as an inventory of fuel with an estimated value of not less than US$627,806.07. 34', 'On 26 July 2021, Mr Ghai had obtained the approval of the Central Bank of Myanmar to remit sums of up to US$3m to pay MMI. 35', '(b)\\u2003The Loan Facility was part of the Proposed Investment by MMI in relation to the Retail Project. 36', 'Mr Ghai explained that MMI had been willing to offer these loans because it wanted to leverage on his knowledge and expertise to establish wholesale fuel trade operations in Myanmar, in connection with which he had provided significant assistance. 37', '(c)\\u2003It was intended that the Loan Sum and outstanding interest under the Loan Facility was to be set off against the Proposed Investment of US$7.5m, 38', 'and that up until 6 April 2021, MMI had never made any demand for repayment. 39', '(d)\\u2003On 25 January 2021, sometime before the signing of the Supplemental Letter, MMI\u2019s legal counsel had sent to Mr Ghai a document titled an \u201cAcknowledgment of Debt\u201d, which provided that no default interest had been levied on the Loan Sum up until that point. 40', 'This showed that the Loan Sum was never considered to be outstanding, even after the due date for payment as stipulated in the Loan Facility, ie, 1 August 2020.', '25\\u2003On 2 August 2021, MMI filed its responsive affidavit. The affidavit emphasised that IEL had still not made repayment of any part of the Outstanding Sum despite its earlier representations in its solicitors\u2019 letters to court. 41', 'MMI also claimed that neither IEL nor Mr Ghai had the means to repay the Outstanding Sum. 42', 'The affidavit also raised the following points in response to those raised by Mr Ghai:', '(a)\\u2003It had been indeed envisaged that the Loan Sum and outstanding interest under the Loan Facility would be set off against the Proposed Investment so that only the remaining amount would be invested as cash by MMI in IEL, but that was subject to the execution of formal investment documentation, which was never done. 43', '(b)\\u2003The \u201cAcknowledgment of Debt\u201d which Mr Ghai had referred to had been a draft that was never executed by the parties. It had nothing to do with the Supplemental Letter, and MMI had never represented that it would not charge default interest on the Loan Sum. 44', '26\\u2003On 3 August 2021, IEL changed its solicitors to Rajah & Tann Singapore LLP (\u201cR&T\u201d). On 4 August 2021, A&G wrote a letter to court asking that the court reject the further arguments which IEL wanted to make about its solvency. A&G complained that IEL still had not made payment to MMI of any part of the Outstanding Sum. A&G also expressed its concerns that IEL was seeking to illegitimately delay matters since it had appointed two new sets of solicitors in the three-week period after the 14 Jul Hearing.', '27\\u2003Given the concerns expressed by MMI, I directed that the hearing for further arguments, which had initially been scheduled for 23 August 2021, be brought forward to 10 August 2021.', '28\\u2003On the day of the hearing, IEL filed another affidavit by Mr Ghai (\u201cthe 10 Aug Affidavit\u201d) in which he asked for leave to make two new further arguments as to why the winding-up order made at the conclusion of the 14 Jul Hearing should be recalled, namely: (a) as at 14 April 2021 when the SD was issued, no sum was yet due under the Loan Facility; and (b) IEL had a valid cross-claim quantified in the amount of US$9,452,071.68 against MMI. 45', '29\\u2003When the parties\u2019 counsel appeared before me on 10 August 2021, IEL\u2019s new counsel, Mr Lee Eng Beng SC (\u201cMr Lee\u201d), sought an adjournment so that he could make the new further arguments which Mr Ghai had set out in the 10 Aug Affidavit. Mr Lee also indicated that IEL would not be pursuing the further arguments set out in the 19 Jul Letter. Mr Jason Chan SC, who appeared for MMI, objected to IEL\u2019s application and argued that IEL was acting in abuse of process.', '30\\u2003As per s 29B(2) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe SCJA\u201d), IEL had 14 days from the date of the original order made on 14 July 2021 to put in a request for further arguments. Given that IEL was out of time in making its request for these new further arguments, I directed that IEL file an application for an extension of time to request to make these new further arguments, and file a supporting affidavit by 24 August 2021 setting out those arguments in full. MMI was directed to file any responsive affidavit by 7 September 2021.', '31\\u2003Pursuant to my directions, IEL filed Summons No 3994 of 2021 (\u201cSUM 3994\u201d), which was its application for an extension of time to request for new further arguments. IEL also filed a supporting affidavit by Mr Ghai setting out its further arguments in full. That affidavit elaborated on the two grounds that Mr Ghai had raised in the 10 Aug Affidavit, which I had also granted IEL leave to file and rely on.', '32\\u2003First, Mr Ghai explained that the various loans (including the Loan Facility) had been provided by MMI to IEL as part of the Proposed Investment in the Retail Project (see [7] above). They were meant to enable IEL to start work on the Retail Project even before any formal documentation on the Proposed Investment was entered into. 46', 'It was the parties\u2019 understanding that the sums advanced would eventually be converted into MMI\u2019s equity investment in IEL once the relevant documentation was executed, and that none of these loans would be repayable while IEL was working on the Retail Project pending the formalisation and completion of the Proposed Investment. 47', '33\\u2003The parties had expected the Proposed Investment to be formalised by 1 August 2020 (which was also the date on which the Loan Facility was to be repaid at the latest per cl 6: see [6] above), but they were unable to agree on the full terms by that time. 48', 'They therefore decided to extend the timeframe for those discussions by 180 days. It was in that context that Mr Ghai and MMI entered into the Letter of Intent on 13 August 2020. 49', 'A first draft of the relevant investment documentation was exchanged on 11 November 2020, but the parties were still unable to agree on its terms by 10 February 2021. Mr Ghai and MMI therefore entered into the Supplemental Letter to extend the term of the Letter of Intent until 9 May 2021. 50', 'During the term of the Letter of the Intent (which was subsequently extended by the Supplemental Letter), Mr Ghai was obliged to work exclusively with MMI towards formalising the Proposed Investment and was prohibited from discussing or soliciting any other investment offer that was similar to or in competition with the subject matter of the Proposed Investment. This was referred to in item 20 of the Letter of Intent as the \u201cExclusivity Period\u201d. 51', '34\\u2003Mr Ghai said that it was obvious that, while the parties were working towards the formalisation and completion of the Proposed Investment pursuant to the terms of the Letter of Intent, the Loan Facility was not repayable and IEL would not be in default by not repaying the loan. 52', 'Accordingly, MMI was not entitled to serve the Letter of Demand (on 6 April 2021) and the SD (on 14 April 2021) because the Exclusivity Period had not yet expired, and the Loan Facility was not yet repayable, as at both of those dates. 53', '35\\u2003Second, Mr Ghai gave details of how IEL had a cross-claim of US$9,452,071.68 against MMI. As alluded to earlier (see [7] above), Mr Ghai explained that MMI had been keen to establish a business for the wholesale supply of petroleum products in Myanmar (\u201cthe Wholesale Business\u201d). 54', 'It had been the parties\u2019 common understanding that the groundwork for the establishment of the Wholesale Business would be undertaken by IEL (and indeed, that had been the case), and that MMI was to reimburse IEL for its incurred costs. 55', 'There was also an understanding between Mr Ghai and MMI that Mr Ghai would be entitled to 20% profits from the Wholesale Business, regardless of which entity within the MM Group was involved in the Wholesale Business. 56', 'In connection with the establishment of the Wholesale Business, Mr Ghai had incorporated a company in Singapore, Iceberg Energy Services Pte Ltd, which was later renamed Myanmar Petroleum Services Pte Ltd (\u201cMPS\u201d). Mr Ghai subsequently transferred an 80% stake in MPS to MMI for a nominal sum of S$1 but remained as a director of MPS. 57', '36\\u2003By January 2021, Mr Ghai began to worry that MMI would renege on its promise to give him 20% of the profits from the Wholesale Business. 58', 'He subsequently informed MMI on 10 March 2021 that he was no longer interested in collaborating with MMI for the Wholesale Business. 59', 'Pursuant to that, Mr Ghai resigned as a director of MPS but he did not agree to transfer his 20% stake to MMI at S$1, as MMI had proposed. 60', 'Then, in two e-mails exchanged between MMI and IEL on 29 March 2021, IEL stated that it ought to be compensated for its contribution to the Wholesale Business, and this was acknowledged by MMI. 61', 'I refer to these e-mails as the \u201c29 Mar E-mails\u201d, the contents of which I will return to later in these grounds (see [87] below). For now, it suffices to note that Mr Ghai\u2019s affidavit stated that IEL, pursuant to those e-mails, proceeded to issue an invoice on 30 April 2021 to MMI for work done for the Wholesale Business (\u201cthe 30 Apr Invoice\u201d). 62', 'The sum claimed in the 30 Apr Invoice is the subject matter of the cross-claim by IEL against MMI.', '37\\u2003On 7 September 2021, MMI filed its responsive affidavit, refuting the various contentions raised by MMI.', '38\\u2003First, MMI disputed Mr Ghai\u2019s contention that the Loan Facility was not repayable at the time when the SD was served on 14 April 2021. MMI said that sums advanced under the Loan Facility were repayable strictly in accordance with its terms. 63', 'MMI never represented to IEL and\/or Mr Ghai that the Loan Sum would not be repayable. 64', 'IEL\u2019s obligation to repay the Loan Sum was independent of the Letter of Intent and the Supplemental Letter, 65', 'and there was nothing in those documents which stated that the Loan Sum would not be repayable during the Exclusivity Period. 66', 'The parties to the Letter of Intent and the Supplemental Letter were MMI and Mr Ghai; IEL was not a party. 67', 'In any case, according to MMI, it had been obvious, well before the issuance of the Letter of Demand on 6 April 2021, that Mr Ghai no longer wished to collaborate with MMI on the Retail Project. 68', '39\\u2003Second, MMI disputed that IEL had any cross-claim in respect of work done for the Wholesale Business. It said that the Wholesale Business, while related to the Retail Project, was carried out through different legal entities. 69', 'MMI did not participate directly in the Wholesale Business, but carried it out through MPS and Myanmar-incorporated MPS subsidiaries, including Kilocal Myanmar Limited (\u201cKML\u201d) and Kilocal Limited (\u201cKL\u201d). 70', 'According to MMI, IEL never did any work in Myanmar in respect of the Wholesale Business. 71', 'MMI also never agreed that IEL was to be compensated for work done for the Wholesale Business. In the 29 Mar E-mails, Mr Zaen Hamid (\u201cMr Hamid\u201d), MMI\u2019s managing director, had asked Mr Ghai (rather than IEL) to quantify the compensation which he was entitled to in respect of work done for the Wholesale Business. 72', 'MMI accepted that it was true that there was a profit-sharing arrangement with Mr Ghai; the intention, however, was for his share of the profits to be received \u201cpersonally through his 20% stake in MPS\u201d. 73', '40\\u2003Both SUM 3994 and IEL\u2019s further arguments were heard on 29 October 2021.'"}

In SUM 2394, OSLabs contended that even if the May Resolutions were invalidated by s 184D(2)(a) of the Companies Act, such invalidation had \u201cno impact whatsoever on the validity of the [sale and purchase agreements] and share transfers\u201d from the Vendor Shareholders to PhonePe. 39', 'In SUM 2410, PhonePe contended that there would \u201cbe no order to be made\u201d by the court if s 184D(2)(a) of the Companies Act \u201cwould automatically render the Resolutions invalid\u201d. 40', '25\\u2003The hearing before me on 31 May 2021 was in respect of SUM 2394, SUM 2410, as well as OS 468 Prayers 1 and 4. At that hearing, Affle made an oral application to proceed only with the first part of OS 468 Prayer 1 (ie, the part relating to the invalidity of the May Resolutions). I granted the first part of OS 468 Prayer 1 and HC\/ORC 3587\/2021 (\u201cORC 3587\u201d) was subsequently extracted on 30 June 2021 holding that the \u201c3 May 2021 and 5 May 2021 resolutions (collectively, the \u201cResolutions\u201d) that were purportedly passed in accordance with [s 184A of the Companies Act] are invalid\u201d. Counsel for Affle also agreed, in respect of OS 468 Prayer 4, that PhonePe could vote as proxy for the Vendor Shareholders. I granted an order in terms of OS 468 Prayer 4, with the following two qualifications: (a) until the Emergency Arbitrator or some other arbitrator in his stead has decided on the validity (or otherwise) of the transfers which have been registered in its favour, PhonePe shall not exercise any voting right in relation to the subject shares at the said EGM; and (b) that the EGM shall not be convened before the decision of the Emergency Arbitrator (or his replacement) has been made.', '26\\u2003On 10 June 2021, OSLabs wrote to PhonePe and Affle to propose to convene the EGM (without waiting for the decision of the Emergency Arbitrator): (a) by way of shorter notice; and (b) where the shareholders entitled to attend and vote be the shareholders on record as at 3 May 2021 and 5 May 2021. 41', 'On 11 June 2021, PhonePe responded that it would be agreeable to convening the EGM as proposed, but that such agreement was without prejudice to its position adopted in OS 468. 42', 'On 14 June 2021, Affle responded that it was not agreeable to convening the EGM by way of shorter notice and maintained that it be \u201cduly convened with 21 days\u2019 notice\u201d. 43', 'It did not specifically object to the proposal as to the members entitled to attend and vote.', '27\\u2003The hearing before me on 18 June 2021 was in respect of SUM 2394 and SUM 2410. Parties indicated that it would take a long time for the Validity Issue to be decided by the Emergency Arbitrator and parties thus applied to amend the order relating to OS 468 Prayer 4. I allowed the amendment (a) authorising the convening of the EGM notwithstanding the fact that the Validity Issue remained unresolved and (b) stipulating that the parties entitled to vote at the EGM would be the members reflected on the company register as at 3 and 5 May 2021 (which therefore included the Vendor Shareholders). The matter was adjourned to a date after the EGM. I should also mention that, contrary to its earlier position adopted at the hearing on 31 May 2021, counsel for Affle took the position that neither PhonePe nor the Vendor Shareholders could vote at the EGM.

{"casename":"2022_SGHC_69","fact":"the background to the matter is set out in the First Judgment and the \nCA Judgment, I shall not go into the full details of the matter here and will only \nset out the facts relevant to this judgment. After taking possession of the \nProperty on 15 March 2012, the Plaintiff discovered numerous defects. He \nengaged a building surveyor to inspect the Property and prepare a list of defects.  \nWhat took place thereafter was several months of toing and froing between the \nPlaintiff and the Defendant, with the Plaintiff sending to the Defendant one \ndefects list after another as new defects were discovered. The parties were in \ncommunication on arrangements for joint inspection, methods of rectification, \nand on whether certain items were truly defects that the Defendant was liable \nfor.

This standoff continued and in February 2013, the Plaintiff called a \ntender based on specifications prepared by his building surveyor. The lowest \ntenderer submitted a price of $1,880,350.  The Defendant took the view that this \nwas excessive and informed the Plaintiff that it would not reimburse him on this \nbasis. The Plaintiff called another tender based on specifications drawn up by a \nnew building surveyor and the lowest bid for this was submitted by JTA \nConstruction Pte Ltd (\u201cJTA\u201d) at $1,213,200. The Plaintiff eventually awarded \nthe contract to JTA (\u201cJTA Contract\u201d) and the work was carried out from \n1 September 2014 to 30 May 2015. \n4 Therefore, there are two categories of defects. The first is those defects \nthat the Defendant had admitted as defects under the SPA and were prepared to \nenter the premises to rectify (\u201cAdmitted Defects\u201d). The second is those defects \nthat the Defendant denied were defects under the SPA and had taken the position \nthat it was not liable to rectify (\u201cNon-admitted Defects\u201d).  In respect of the \nAdmitted Defects, the first issue is whether the Plaintiff had failed to mitigate \nhis damages because he had refused the Defendant access to the Property for \nthe purpose of rectifying those defects. For the Non-admitted Defects, this will \nentail a determination of: (a) whether each item is a defect under the SPA such \nthat the Defendant would be liable to rectify; and if so, (b) what would be the \nreasonable cost that would be incurred by the Plaintiff to rectify such defects.\n5 There is a sub-category of the Admitted Defects. This concerns the \npassenger lift and vehicle lift (collectively, \u201cthe Lifts\u201d) in the Property. The \nDefendant\u2019s main contractor had engaged Gylet Elevator Co Pte Ltd (\u201cGylet\u201d) \nto supply and install the Lifts.

{"casename":"2022_SGHC_7","fact":"'4\\u2003Starting from January 2016, Envy Asset Management Pte Ltd (\u201cEAM\u201d), a company in which Mr Ng is a 90% shareholder, 5', 'offered to investors an investment scheme involving physical nickel trading. Investors would place monies with EAM for the purported purpose of investing in London Metal Exchange (\u201cLME\u201d) grade nickel. EAM would then use investor monies to purchase LME grade nickel at a discounted price from sellers, before then selling it on to buyers at a higher price. 6', 'On the maturity date of their investments, the investors would then be entitled to returns, which would be based on the spread between the discounted purchase price and the subsequent sale price of the LME grade nickel. 7', 'Investors were also told that their monies were transferred to Envy Asset Management Trading Ltd (\u201cEAMT\u201d), a British Virgin Islands-incorporated company wholly owned by Mr Ng, that was responsible for making payment to the sellers and\/or receiving the sale proceeds from the buyers on behalf of EAM. 8', '5\\u2003In or around March 2020, the Monetary Authority of Singapore placed EAM on the Investor Alert List and its business was thereafter transferred to EGT in or around June 2020. 9', 'From April 2020 onwards, the nickel trading investment scheme also came to be offered by EGT instead of EAM. 10', 'By this time, EGT\u2019s investors no longer invested directly in LME grade nickel, but instead purchased a portion of the receivable that was due from buyers who purportedly purchased LME grade nickel from EGT. 11', '6\\u2003The plaintiffs were two such investors in EGT\u2019s nickel trading investment scheme. From November 2020 to January 2021, they entered into a total of five contracts with EGT for the purchase of a portion of EGT\u2019s trade receivables that were purportedly due from one Raffemet Pte Ltd (\u201cRaffemet\u201d), which was supposedly a buyer of nickel from EGT. Two of these contracts involved Debenho - one in November 2020 and another in December 2020; while three of them involved Mr Low - one in November 2020, another in December 2020 and a third in January 2021 (separately, \u201cthe Contract\u201d and collectively, \u201cthe Contracts\u201d). The plaintiffs claim they were informed by the defendants that the trade receivables underlying each of the Contracts represented the net purchase price that was payable by Raffemet under a corresponding contract for the purchase of LME grade nickel from EGT that was entered into within the same month as each of the Contracts. The plaintiffs were informed of three such contracts between EGT and Raffemet by the defendants - one in November 2020, another in December 2020, and a third in January 2021 (collectively, \u201cthe Corresponding Contracts\u201d). 12', '7\\u2003In total, the plaintiffs collectively paid $20,108,944.95 as the purchase prices under the Contracts to EGT. Each of the Contracts allegedly provided for the plaintiffs\u2019 entitlement to receive a specified percentage of \u201cany and all net amounts received or recovered by EGT from Raffemet\u201d pursuant to the Corresponding Contracts, and that EGT was to remit to the plaintiffs their return within ten business days after EGT\u2019s receipt of payment from Raffemet. 13', '8\\u2003The plaintiffs claim that EGT had informed them that they had earned net profits of approximately 17% of their purchase price in connection with the Contracts for November and December 2020 (\u201cthe Profits\u201d), and that they were entitled to the repayment of their purchase price and the Profits within ten business days upon them making a request to EGT. 14', 'The plaintiffs duly made the request, which they say was acknowledged by EGT, but payment of those sums was never forthcoming, even after their solicitors sent letters of demand to EGT. 15', '9\\u2003The plaintiffs claim that they dealt solely with Mr Ng in relation to each of the Contracts, that Mr Ng \u201cwas and is the controlling mind and alter ego of EGT\u201d, and that the Contracts were \u201cauthorised, directed and\/or procured\u201d by Mr Ng. 16', 'The plaintiffs also claim that Mr Ng (who was acting for and on behalf of EGT) either himself or through his agents made representations to them about EGT and Raffemet entering into each of the Corresponding Contracts at the material times (namely, November 2020, December 2020 and January 2021) and that the Corresponding Contracts were valid and binding agreements between EGT and Raffemet (\u201cthe Representations\u201d). 17', '10\\u2003The plaintiffs claim that the Representations were false as they later discovered that none of the Corresponding Contracts ever existed, 18', 'and that Mr Ng had made the Representations fraudulently, with the knowledge that they were false, or in reckless disregard of whether they were true. 19', 'The plaintiffs also claim that they had entered into the Contracts and made payment of the purchase price of approximately $20.1m in reliance on the truth of the Representations. 20', '11\\u2003The plaintiffs commenced the present suit on 31 March 2021 and made claims against EGT and, in the alternative, against Mr Ng. 21', '(a)\\u2003As against EGT, on account of its breach of contract, the plaintiffs claim: (i) the return of the purchase price paid under the Contracts for November and December 2020; (ii) payment of the Profits due under the Contracts for November and December 2020; and (iii) the repayment of the purchase price paid under the Contract for January 2021. In the alternative, the plaintiffs seek the rescission of the Contracts on account of the Representations, which they say were false and were fraudulently made by EGT and\/or Mr Ng, and the return of the total purchase price paid under all of the Contracts, or damages for misrepresentation to be paid by EGT to the plaintiffs.', '(b)\\u2003As against Mr Ng, on account of his \u201cpersonal liability to the [p]laintiffs for directing, authorising and\/or procuring EGT\u2019s fraud\u201d, the plaintiffs claim the return of the total purchase price paid under all of the Contracts or damages for misrepresentation to be paid by Mr Ng to the plaintiffs.', '12\\u2003EGT entered an appearance in the suit but (for reasons that will be explained later) did not file its defence. Mr Ng entered an appearance in the suit and filed his defence on 4 May 2021. It is not necessary for present purposes to consider Mr Ng\u2019s defence in detail, but it suffices to note the following: (a) he avers that the plaintiffs dealt with one Jordan Chua (and not him) in relation to the Contracts; 22', '(b) he denied making or being liable for the Representations; 23', '(c) alternatively, he denied making the Representations fraudulently; 24', 'and (d) he had reasonable grounds to believe and did believe that the Representations were true. 25', 'Mr Ng later made some amendments to his defence on 2 June 2021, the details of which are immaterial for present purposes. 26', '13\\u2003On 27 April 2021, the court ordered EGT to be placed under interim judicial management. 27', 'EGT\u2019s interim judicial managers issued a report on 25 May 2021 (\u201cthe IJM Report\u201d) to inform the court and EGT\u2019s creditors of the prospects of EGT achieving the purposes of judicial management.', '14\\u2003The IJM Report stated that the nickel trading investment scheme was a complete fiction as EAM and EGT never made any purchase of nickel from any sellers, nor did they enter into any transaction for the sale of nickel to any buyers like Raffemet. 28', 'While EGT did enter into a series of contracts for the sale of nickel to Raffemet between August and September 2020, 29', 'these transactions relate to shipments of nickel, which the IJMs opined had been procured from Raffemet by EGT in the first place for the specific purpose of being shown to investors and hence was unrelated to the nickel trading investment scheme. 30', 'Accordingly, this meant that none of the Corresponding Contracts, which are the subject of the Representations the plaintiffs claim were made by Mr Ng, ever existed. The IJM Report also stated that investor monies were never transferred to EAMT, but instead to two Singapore bank accounts. Mr Ng was the holder of at least one, if not both accounts. 31', 'The interim judicial management order was thereafter discharged, and EGT was later wound up by the court on 16 August 2021 following an application by its interim judicial managers on the basis that it was hopelessly insolvent. 32', '15\\u2003The effect of the interim judicial management order and the subsequent liquidation of EGT meant that the suit as against EGT has been stayed since 27 April 2021, and the plaintiffs are no longer able to pursue their claims in the suit against EGT without first obtaining leave of court to do so. To date, the plaintiffs have not sought leave to do so. Indeed, as explained below, the plaintiffs have undertaken, through their counsel, that they will not pursue such leave (see [20] and [32] below).', '16\\u2003On 22 March 2021, Mr Ng was charged with two counts of cheating under s 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe Penal Code\u201d) for allegedly deceiving two parties (who were not the plaintiffs) to pay at least $48m in connection with purchasing a portion of the receivables under EGT\u2019s sale and purchase contracts with Raffemet, when no such contracts actually existed. 33', 'On 20 April 2021, Mr Ng was charged with five more similar counts of cheating involving five other individuals. 34', 'By 23 June 2021, Mr Ng had been charged with 15 counts of cheating, two counts of forgery under s 465 of the Penal Code and two further counts of fraudulent trading under s 340(5) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed). 35', '17\\u2003At the time of the hearing before me, Mr Ng faced a total of 70 criminal charges. 36', 'I was informed by counsel for Mr Ng that, of these 70 charges, 49 were cheating charges under s 420 of the Penal Code involving 49 separate alleged victims. 37', 'Two of these cheating charges allege that Mr Ng had cheated Mr Low (the 16th charge) and Debenho (the 17th charge) (collectively \u201cthe Charges\u201d) by deceiving them into believing that they were purchasing a portion of the receivables which EGT was to receive from Raffemet under the Corresponding Contracts, a fact which Mr Ng knew to be false, and which induced Mr Low and Debenho to enter into the Contracts and pay the purchase prices, which they otherwise would not have done had they not been so deceived. 38', 'The Charges were preferred against Mr Ng on 14 May 2021. 39', '18\\u2003The news reports annexed to Mr Low\u2019s affidavit filed for these proceedings state that Mr Ng is out on bail (and he remains so, as I understand from his counsel at the hearing before me) in the amount of $1.5m. These reports also state that he has been ordered by the court to wear an electronic tag and comply with a 10.00pm to 6.00am curfew, 40', 'and further, that the alleged fraud to which Mr Ng was linked now involved more than $1bn. 41', '19\\u2003On 11 June 2021, Mr Ng applied in Summons No 2756 of 2021 for the suit as against him to be stayed (\u201cthe Stay Application\u201d) pending: (a) the final outcome of any application that the plaintiffs may make for leave to continue the suit against EGT; and (b) the final determination of the criminal proceedings in relation to the Charges (\u201cthe Criminal Proceedings\u201d), including any appeals. The basis for (a) was that both the plaintiffs\u2019 claims against EGT and against Mr Ng were inextricably linked and, as such, the suit against Mr Ng should be stayed on case management grounds to avoid the risk of inconsistent findings. In other words, Mr Ng\u2019s position is that the claim against him should not proceed unless it is clear that the plaintiffs will not be permitted to proceed with their claim against EGT. The basis for (b) was that there is a real danger that Mr Ng may be prejudiced in the Criminal Proceedings if the suit was heard before the former given that it involves the same subject matter as the suit. 42', '20\\u2003An assistant registrar (\u201cAR\u201d) heard the Stay Application on 12 August 2021. Following the hearing, the plaintiffs\u2019 solicitors wrote to court on 18 August 2021 to confirm that the plaintiffs would not be filing any application for leave to continue the suit as against EGT which, two days earlier, had been ordered to be wound up. 43', '21\\u2003The AR delivered her decision on 19 August 2021. She dismissed the Stay Application. In relation to the application for a stay on the basis that the claims against the two defendants were linked, the AR held that there was little risk of a multiplicity of proceedings to justify a stay. This was because the plaintiffs had confirmed that they would not be applying for leave to continue the suit against EGT (see [20] above). 44', 'In relation to the application for a stay because of the Criminal Proceedings, the AR held that Mr Ng had not shown that there was a real danger of injustice in the Criminal Proceedings if the suit was not stayed. This was because it was not known whether the Prosecution will ultimately proceed to trial on the Charges out of the many charges that Mr Ng faces. Also, there was no clarity as to when the trial in the Criminal Proceedings will take place. 45', '22\\u2003Mr Ng appealed against the AR\u2019s decision (\u201cthe Registrar\u2019s Appeal\u201d). The arguments at the appeal first dealt with whether a stay should be granted until there was clarity as to the plaintiffs\u2019 intentions to either proceed or not proceed against EGT. Counsel for Mr Ng argued that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims against EGT and Mr Ng are inextricably linked, raise the same issues, and will rely on the same evidence. Counsel submitted that the court can only make a finding that Mr Ng is personally liable if it first makes a finding that EGT has committed fraud. That is because the plaintiffs have pleaded that Mr Ng is liable on account of him directing, authorising and\/or procuring EGT\u2019s fraud (see [11(b)] above). As such, if the court finds that EGT had not acted fraudulently, then the entire premise of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims against Mr Ng falls away because there would be nothing that he could be personally liable for. 46', 'If the claims against EGT and Mr Ng were dealt with in separate proceedings, with the claim against Mr Ng proceeding first, there might be a risk of inconsistent findings and conflicting decisions, eg, if Mr Ng is found liable for fraudulent misrepresentation, but in later proceedings, EGT is found not liable for any fraud. 47', 'Thus, counsel argues that the claim against Mr Ng should be stayed until such time it is made clear that the plaintiffs will not be allowed to proceed with the claim against EGT, ie, when any application by the plaintiffs for leave to proceed with their claim against EGT is dismissed.', '23\\u2003In reply, counsel for the plaintiffs submits that, even though their claims against EGT and Mr Ng arise from the same background facts, they are in fact separate and distinct, with each having their own separate issues to be tried. Hence, counsel argues that the proper ventilation of issues in the plaintiffs\u2019 claim against Mr Ng is not dependent on the resolution of issues in the plaintiffs\u2019 claim against EGT. 48', 'In any event, counsel also argues that there is no real risk of overlapping issues and inconsistent decisions that weighs in favour of a stay because of his confirmation, as set out in Fullerton Law Chambers\u2019 letter of 18 August 2021 to the court, that the plaintiffs will not be filing any application for leave to continue their claim against EGT, given that the company is now in liquidation (see [20] above). At the hearing before me, counsel also informed me that he will state \u201con the record\u201d that the plaintiffs will not be making any application to continue with the claim against EGT, whether now or in the future. 49', '24\\u2003I come now to the arguments in relation to the application for a stay until the final determination of the Criminal Proceedings. Counsel for Mr Ng argues that his client will suffer a real danger of prejudice in the Criminal Proceedings if the suit is not stayed. This arises in two ways. First, given that the elements of the fraudulent misrepresentation claim against Mr Ng are almost identical to what the Prosecution has to prove in respect of the Charges, if the suit is allowed to proceed, Mr Ng would be required to give evidence on matters which he would raise or rely upon in his defence in the Criminal Proceedings, thereby undermining his right of silence and his privilege against self-incrimination. 50', 'Second, if Mr Ng has to give evidence in the suit before the Criminal Proceedings are tried, he would be required to disclose the same evidence that he will later rely on in his defence in the Criminal Proceedings, as well as reveal the identity of the witnesses that he will call and the questions which his lawyers might put to the Prosecution\u2019s witnesses in cross-examination, at a time when he does not yet know what the Prosecution\u2019s case against him will be. That will give the Prosecution an unfair advantage in the Criminal Proceedings as it now has an opportunity to watch a \u201ctest run\u201d of its case and, if necessary, improve upon it. 51', '25\\u2003Counsel for Mr Ng also points to other factors in favour of a stay until the Criminal Proceedings are completed. First, if the suit is not stayed, Mr Ng will face the huge burden and strain of having to defend both criminal and civil proceedings concurrently. 52', 'Second, there is nothing in the circumstances which would militate against the grant of a stay since the plaintiffs will suffer no more than the frustration of delay, which is per se not a sufficient reason for the refusal of a stay, once it has been shown that there is a real danger of prejudice to Mr Ng in the Criminal Proceedings if the suit were to proceed. 53', '26\\u2003In reply, the plaintiffs submit that Mr Ng has failed to show that there is a real danger of prejudice to him in the Criminal Proceedings if the suit is allowed to proceed. In particular, since Mr Ng has already filed his defence in the suit, counsel submits that it is difficult to see how any further evidence adduced in support Mr Ng\u2019s case in the suit would cause prejudice to him in the Criminal Proceedings. 54', 'The plaintiffs also point to the uncertainty in the progress of the Criminal Proceedings and the potentially indefinite delay they may suffer in pursuing their rather substantial claim against Mr Ng if the suit is stayed. 55'"}
{"casename":"2022_SGHC_70","fact":"'4\\u2003I begin by setting out the pertinent portions of the Statement of Facts. For Shell, the Pulau Bukom facility is its largest petrochemical production and export centre in the Asia Pacific region.', '5\\u2003The accused is a 45-year-old Singaporean. He joined Shell on 1 June 2004. At the material time, he was deployed as a Shore Loading Officer, assigned to Team D, at the Pulau Bukom facility. In that capacity, the accused was primarily tasked to facilitate the transfer of Shell\u2019s petroleum products to client vessels. The accused tendered his resignation on 5 December 2017, but this was superseded by his termination with effect from 28 December 2017. 2', '6\\u2003Between 2007 and 2018, the accused was part of a conspiracy with his co-conspirators from Team D to dishonestly misappropriate gas oil from the Pulau Bukom facility by illegally transferring gas oil out of the facility onto vessels. Each instance of misappropriation was often referred to as an \u201cillegal loading\u201d. 3', '7\\u2003Generally, to broker a deal to sell misappropriated gas oil, a Shore Loading Officer of the syndicate engaged with the captain of a vessel to discuss the sale and purchase of the gas oil. 4', 'The misappropriated gas oil was sold at a price lower than its prevailing estimated market value as derived from the S&P Global Platts index. 5', 'Broadly, the criminal proceeds were split amongst all co-conspirators even if they were not present during the illegal loading, so as to prevent any unhappiness among the co-conspirators. 6', '8\\u2003When the accused became involved in the dishonest misappropriation of gas oil in 2007, the fellow mastermind was Abdul Latif bin Ibrahim (\u201cLatif\u201d). Further co-conspirators were recruited. They were Muhammad Ashraf bin Hamzah (\u201cAshraf\u201d), Tiah Kok Hwee (\u201cTiah\u201d) and Muzaffar Ali Khan (\u201cMuzaffar\u201d). With the involvement of Ashraf, Tiah, and Muzaffar, Latif and the accused were able to expand the scheme to involve more bunker ships. Subsequently, it was discovered that Latif had retained approximately half of the proceeds prior to splitting the remainder with the accused and the other co-conspirators. The parties fell out, and the scheme came to a halt. 7', '9\\u2003In mid-2014, the accused, with the remaining co-conspirators, resumed their criminal activities without Latif. They established contacts with other vessels willing to participate in the illegal loadings. They also successfully recruited three other colleagues, namely Muhamad Farhan bin Mohamed Rashid, Cai Zhizhong, and Koh Choon Wei, into the scheme. Between 2014 and 2017, the accused and his co-conspirators entered into agreements to perform illegal loadings for various vessels, including those belonging to Sentek Marine & Trading Pte Ltd, Sirius Marine Pte Ltd and Prime Shipping Corporation (\u201cPrime Shipping\u201d) which is based in Vietnam. 8', 'One other colleague, Sadagopan Premnath (\u201cSadagopan\u201d), also joined the syndicate. 9', '10\\u2003To evade detection over the long period of time, the accused and the co-conspirators relied on a combination of methods. These included configuring the flow of misappropriated gas oil through routes that avoided custody transfer meters, ensuring that multiple pumps and tanks were moving at the same time (including unnecessary tank-to-tank transfers) to mask the misappropriation, hiding the misappropriation of gas oil from a tank by shifting production of gas oil into the same tank (such that the level in the tank appeared balanced or even to be increasing while the misappropriation was taking place), and timing the misappropriation of gas oil vis-\u00e0-vis the legitimate loading of gas oil. 10', '11\\u2003Relying on their combined in-depth knowledge of Shell\u2019s internal systems and processes, the accused and the co-conspirators took further steps to avoid detection by their supervisors and colleagues. These measures included tampering with the bunker meter (if the misappropriated gas oil was being transferred to a bunker ship), stationing a co-conspirator at the control panel to mask the movement of misappropriated gas oil by manipulating the control panel, and tampering with the orientation of the CCTV cameras to ensure that their illegal activities were not recorded. 11', 'For many of the transactions, the accused also paid off independent surveyors to turn a blind eye to the excess misappropriated gas oil being loaded onto the vessels. 12', '12\\u2003The details of the CBT charges, including the period of the offence, the volume of gas oil misappropriated, the value of misappropriated gas oil, the vessels, the number of illegal loadings and the co-conspirators involved are set out at Annex A. 13', 'The total volume of misappropriated gas oil in the CBT charges is 143,157 metric tonnes, with a total value of S$93,835,793.49. 14', 'No restitution has been made to Shell for the offences. 15', '13\\u2003As stated at [5] above, the accused left Shell in December 2017. In part, this was because he had heard rumours that there were investigations into the misappropriation of gas oil. Nonetheless, he continued to be involved in the syndicate and assisted in the collection and distribution of the proceeds from the illegal loadings. 16', '14\\u2003Investigations revealed that the accused obtained criminal benefits of at least S$5,630,398.68 through the scheme. Between 2012 and 2018, the accused converted, transferred or removed a sum of S$3,417,201.32, which in whole represented the benefits from criminal conduct, by spending the criminal proceeds on local and overseas properties, foreign exchange trading, vehicles, as well as investments in local and foreign businesses. Substantial assets have been seized or frozen. 17', 'The total amount in the CDSA charges involves S$2,684,908.43, and the details are set out at Annex B. 18', '15\\u2003Between 2014 and 2017, the accused and Muzaffar engaged the assistance of surveyors from Intertek Testing Services Pte Ltd (\u201cIntertek\u201d) and SGS Testing & Control Services Singapore Pte Ltd (\u201cSGS\u201d) to facilitate their misappropriation of gas oil. Surveyors from SGS and Intertek were engaged by Shell to conduct inspections of the quantity of gas oil supplied to vessels by Shell. Following these inspections, the surveyors would prepare ullage reports for Shell and their respective employers to show the amount of cargo loaded onto the vessel. 19', '16\\u2003Together with Muzaffar, the accused approached the surveyors and entered into an arrangement to pay them cash in exchange for their forbearing to accurately report the amount of cargo loaded onto their vessels. The surveyors would either turn a blind eye to the unauthorised loading of cargo or omit to inspect the non-nominated tanks of the vessels which had received misappropriated gas oil. Non-nominated tanks were tanks which were not designated to receive any cargo. Payment was made to all the surveyors even if they did not perform the inspection of the specific vessel to keep them quiet about the misappropriation of the gas oil. The moneys were deducted from the proceeds of the sale of the misappropriated gas oil. 20', '17\\u2003The PCA charges involved six surveyors (five were employed by Intertek and the remaining surveyor was employed by SGS), and a total gratification sum of US$145,000 and S$10,000. The details are set out in Annex C.', '18\\u2003Shell expended significant efforts to identify the reason for the unidentified oil loss at the Pulau Bukom facility. Between 2015 and 2017, Shell engaged: (a) a group of Hydrocarbon Mass Balance experts from Shell\u2019s other offices to conduct a technical and process review at the facility; (b) a third-party consultant known as Trident Management Consulting Inc to review its hydrocarbon loss; and (c) a global multidisciplinary team of Shell analysts to monitor tank movements. 21', 'On 1 August 2017, Shell lodged a police report regarding the unidentified loss of fuel. 22', 'Since then, Shell has taken numerous measures to improve its processes at the facility. By the end of 2020, the estimated costs incurred and to be incurred by Shell to manage the consequences of the long-term misappropriation is in the region of S$6m. 23'"}

The respondent says that this meant that there was no \nagreement on the price, and hence, there was no agreement for the Ramp Works. \nI disagree. As seen from the subsequent correspondence between the parties, \neven when Mr Coney was informed on numerous occasions that the appellant \nhad commenced Ramp Works, he did not raise any objections as to the costs of \nthe Ramp Works. Although silence ordinarily is no consent, in the context of \nthe facts, Mr Coney no longer had his reservations about the price once the \nRamp Work has started with the actual knowledge and consent of the \nrespondent without protest. \n21 This was further buttressed by the 19 February WhatsApp in which \nMr Wong updated Mr Coney on the progress of the Ramp Works and provided \nphotographs of the steel materials that had been fabricated. In the same \nconversation, Mr Wong asked for Mr Coney to issue a purchase order, to which \nMr Coney replied \u201c[s]ure it can be done tomorrow\u201d.

The CSAPL SVP Contract, signed by Mr Jagetia on 19 April 2018, lies at the heart of this dispute, and I now set out the material clauses. 10', '9\\u2003Pursuant to cl 1.2, the CSAPL SVP Contract \u201csupersedes\u201d the CIPL DMD Contract. Although the CSAPL SVP Contract is dated 14 March 2018, it commences on 1 April 2018 while Mr Jagetia\u2019s length of employment is backdated to 26 September 2014 (ie, the date of the CIPL DMD Contract) as follows:', '10\\u2003Under cl 2.2, Mr Jagetia was to report directly to the board of CSAPL with \u201cdaily oversight by Executive Vice President, Asia\u201d [emphasis in original]. As mentioned at [5], at the material time, the position was held by Mr Fewkes.', '11\\u2003Under cl 5.1, Mr Jagetia was to \u201cdevote most of his working capacity to the employment with [CSAPL] and can use some of his time to support the activities of [CSAPLH]\u201d.', '12\\u2003The CSAPL SVP Contract also addresses Mr Jagetia\u2019s move from India to Singapore with his family. That said, it is common ground between parties that the contract stops short of expressly requiring Mr Jagetia and his family to move to Singapore:', '13\\u2003Clauses 6.5, 6.6 and 6.9 provide for the related expenses of relocation (the \u201cRelocation Allowance\u201d), repatriation (the \u201cRepatriation Allowance\u201d), telecommunication and tax as follows:', '14\\u2003The remaining sub-clauses of cl 6 set out Mr Jagetia\u2019s compensation and benefits, including his gross annual base salary (the \u201cGross Annual Base Salary\u201d) and gross annual benefits package (the \u201cAnnual Benefits Package\u201d):', '15\\u2003In relation to the short-term incentive (\u201cSTI\u201d) mentioned in cl 6.2, cl 7 provides very broadly as follows:', '16\\u2003This brings me to cl 11, the last clause I wish to highlight, which provides that the contract may be terminated by either Mr Jagetia or CSAPL as follows: 12', '17\\u2003I pause to highlight that arising from the contractual provisions set out at [12] and [13], CSAPL contends that there is an implied term under the CSAPL SVP Contract for Mr Jagetia to relocate with his family to Singapore (the \u201cRelocation Obligation\u201d). Mr Jagetia contends, however, that he was merely given the option to relocate with his family to Singapore. As it transpired, Mr Jagetia\u2019s family did not relocate to Singapore. As to whether Mr Jagetia could be said to have relocated to Singapore, parties differ.', '18\\u2003During Mr Jagetia\u2019s employment, four issues were brewing in respect of the management of CSAPL. Operating in the background seems to be a disagreement between the two shareholders, CBAS and CSAPLH. Indeed, on most of the resolutions in relation to these matters, the CBAS nominated directors and the CSAPLH nominated directors appear to have taken opposite sides. I summarise the parties\u2019 perspectives on these issues.', '19\\u2003The first, and probably most significant of the four issues, concerns the refinancing of a loan facility granted by CBAS to CSAPL (the \u201cCBAS Loan Facility\u201d). 13', '20\\u2003As set out in the CSAPL SVP Contract, one of Mr Jagetia\u2019s responsibilities was to \u201clead \u2026 financial management\u201d so as to \u201clower financial cost \u2026 within CSAPL\u201d. 14', 'According to Mr Jagetia, he had attempted to reduce CSAPL\u2019s interest expenses arising from the CBAS Loan Facility by refinancing it. In that regard, Mr Jagetia attempted to obtain a loan from third-party banks at more competitive interest rates (the \u201cFinancing Efforts\u201d). 15', 'In particular, Mr Jagetia\u2019s position is that he secured an offer from Rabobank for a US$350m loan facility (the \u201cRabobank Loan Facility\u201d) in which CSAPL \u201cstood to save up to US$123,000 per week or US$6,388,000 per annum in interest costs\u201d compared to the CBAS Loan Facility. 16', 'However, Mr Jagetia was of the view that he was \u201cmet with blocking and delaying tactics\u201d from CBAS nominated directors because CBAS \u201cwould lose the windfall it had been earning\u201d. 17', '21\\u2003According to CSAPL, the issue of refinancing was an important one. More information would have been needed on the financing options, and the board would only have acted after a review of all the relevant information and an analysis of the same. At a series of board meetings from 30 January 2019 to 4 June 2019, the Rabobank Loan Facility was discussed. Various members of the board had reservations about the key terms of the Rabobank Loan Facility, including the financial covenants and repayment schedule, and they wanted an understanding of CSAPL\u2019s financial position. Mr Jagetia failed to address the concerns of the board which, as SVP of CSAPL, was for him to do. Mr Jagetia was not blocked in the Financing Efforts. 18', '22\\u2003Next, according to Mr Jagetia, sometime in 2017, when he was DMD of CIPL, he had discovered trade practices which were allegedly \u201cimproper\u201d within CIPL. Although he attempted to investigate the matter while he was CSAPL SVP, the directors nominated by CBAS prevented him from doing so. 19', 'Specifically, Mr Jagetia raised concerns of \u201cillegal trade practices and anti-competitive behaviour\u201d to the CIPL Audit Committee (the \u201cWhistle-Blowing Efforts\u201d). 20', 'However, Mr Fewkes and the CBAS nominated directors considered the Whistle-Blowing Efforts to be detrimental to CBAS and did not want any publicity or investigation in relation to the matters. 21', '23\\u2003CSAPL contends that these matters are irrelevant to the contractual dispute at hand. In particular, Mr Stollberg highlights that Mr Jagetia \u201cnever brought it to [CSAPL\u2019s] attention at the time when the matter surfaced in CIPL\u201d but had instead \u201cconsidered the whistle-blowing issues \u2026 a matter for CIPL to deal with\u201d. According to Mr Stollberg, the issue of illegal trade practices was first brought to the attention of the CSAPL\u2019s board of directors only on 23 June 2019. 22', 'However, CSAPL did not hamper Mr Jagetia\u2019s efforts in relation to the matters.', '24\\u2003Another of Mr Jagetia\u2019s responsibilities was to \u201cactively drive the IPO in close cooperation with Carlsberg representatives\u201d. 23', 'Mr Jagetia is of the view that CBAS nominated directors had been \u201cobstructing [his] efforts\u201d to \u201cwork towards\u201d the initial public offering of CIPL and GBPL (the \u201cIPO Efforts\u201d). 24', 'Again, CSAPL disputes Mr Jagetia\u2019s narrative of the events. 25', 'CSAPL highlights that at a board meeting on 23 October 2018, the CBAS nominated directors decided that they could not approve a mandate to proceed without \u201ca complete understanding of the pros and cons for CSAPL of the IPO and restructuring\u201d as they needed \u201can aligned input from the IPO Committee\u201d. 26', '25\\u2003Lastly, Mr Jagetia is of the view that the CBAS nominated directors \u201cfrustrated\u201d his attempts to participate in the business planning of CSAPL\u2019s subsidiaries (the \u201cPlanning Efforts\u201d). 27', 'For instance, they did not support Mr Jagetia\u2019s efforts to get the management of CIPL and GBPL to engage him to manage short term and long range business such that he would be privy to the communications with the subsidiaries. 28', 'Also, they did not advise the Carlsberg Group and CSAPLH employees to (a) work with Mr Jagetia and (b) not communicate directly with CIPL and GBPL in relation to areas for which Mr Jagetia was responsible. 29', '26\\u2003Again, CSAPL disagrees with Mr Jagetia\u2019s narrative. When Mr Jagetia brought up the issues at a board meeting, Mr Steenberg mentioned that there is no mention in the CSAPL SVP Contract or the CSAPL\u2019s shareholders agreement that all information \u201cneeds to go through [the] SVP\u201d. In any case, it would be \u201centirely unpractical as it will create an unnecessary bottle neck to make one person the sole contact for all information\u201d. As a multinational corporation, \u201cnowhere in the company is there one person that all communications go through\u201d. 30', '27\\u2003Apart from the management issues, disagreements soon emerged with respect to Mr Jagetia\u2019s remuneration.', '28\\u2003In relation to the STI for 2018, there are two disputes. For context, it is not seriously disputed that the STI from January 2018 to March 2018 while Mr Jagetia was DMD of CIPL (the \u201cCIPL STI\u201d) is still due to him. The first dispute is over which entity is liable to make the payment (whether CSAPL or otherwise). Mr Jagetia takes the view that CSAPL should pay him S$114,800 for the CIPL STI. 31', 'Second, the parties disagree on the computation of the STI from April 2018 onwards (the \u201cCSAPL 2018 STI\u201d). While CSAPL approved a sum of S$135,500 for the CSAPL 2018 STI, Mr Jagetia claims that it should have been S$192,363.80.', '29\\u2003As reproduced above at [14], cl 6.2 of the CSAPL SVP Contract provides that Mr Jagetia\u2019s Gross Annual Base Salary shall be reviewed \u201conce a year\u201d, for which the first review was to take place in April 2019. Mr Jagetia\u2019s view is that he should have received a salary increment similar to that enjoyed by the senior management in CIPL and GBPL (ie, about 5%). However, CSAPL disagrees, and Mr Jagetia received no such increment.', '30\\u2003By June 2019, things had come to a head. At a board meeting on 26 June 2019, Mr Stollberg highlighted the following matters which purportedly supported an \u201cimmediate termination\u201d of Mr Jagetia\u2019s employment under cl 11.5 of the CSAPL SVP Contract, as reproduced at [16] above: 32', '31\\u2003In contrast, the other CSAPLH nominated director, Mr Yeo, stated that Mr Jagetia should be \u201cgiven adequate opportunity to respond\u201d. Despite Mr Yeo\u2019s objections, the board nevertheless voted to terminate Mr Jagetia. Mr Fewkes then formally terminated Mr Jagetia\u2019s employment as SVP of CSAPL. 33'"}

They lived together for several years with their own young children and the children from Ms Mytsyk\u2019s former marriage, prior to Ms Mytsyk commencing divorce proceedings in August 2019. Shortly after filing for divorce, Ms Mytsyk also started a civil suit against Mr Anushka and Med Travel. This is HC\/S 1247\/2019 (\u201cS 1247\u201d), in which Mr Anushka is the first defendant and Med Travel is the second defendant. Ms Mytsyk\u2019s co-plaintiffs in S 1247 are her father, one Hryhorii Liaskovskyi (\u201cMr Liaskovskyi\u201d), and a company called Health & Help Pte Ltd, (\u201cHealth & Help\u201d) in which she is currently the sole shareholder and director on record.

On 20 November 2013, Mr Anushka transferred 50% of the shares in Med Travel to Mr Liaskovskyi. On 13 June 2016, Mr Liaskovskyi transferred this 50% shareholding to Ms Mytsyk. Ms Mytsyk was also appointed a director of Med Travel on 7 June 2018.', '5\\u2003While Ms Mytsyk and Mr Anushka do not deny that the above facts are a matter of documentary record, each has his or her own narrative. It is Ms Mytsyk\u2019s case that Mr Anushka has never been more than a \u201cnominee shareholder and director\u201d of Med Travel: according to her, he has always held the shares of Med Travel on behalf of Mr Liaskovskyi who is the true beneficial owner of the company. 6', 'Ms Mytsyk alleges that Mr Anushka should have transferred 100% of these shares to Mr Liaskovskyi in November 2013 instead of transferring only 50%; and that Mr Anushka forged Mr Liaskovskyi\u2019s signature on the share transfer documents. Ms Mytsyk further alleges that Mr Anushka forged the documents relating to her appointment as a director of Med Travel, although she presently takes the position that she has since consented to and\/or ratified the appointment.', '6\\u2003Mr Anushka, for his part, denies these allegations.

The Complainant engaged one Realax Services Pte Ltd (\u201cRealax\u201d) to recover an investment which he had made in a UK company.

When Mr Thirumurthy returned to the office later that day, he was told of the Complainant\u2019s visit to sign the document by his secretary, and he then appended his signature on the POA and attested that the Complainant had signed the POA in his presence. Mr Thirumurthy says that he thought about asking the Complainant to return to his office and execute the POA again, this time in his presence, but decided that he did not need to do so because his secretary had witnessed the Complainant signing the POA.

On the other hand, counsel for Mr Thirumurthy, Mr R S Bajwa, submits that we should impose a shorter period of suspension, but supplement the punishment by imposing a fine pursuant to s 83(1)(e) of the LPA, which provides that the court can impose a fine under s 83(1)(c) \u201cin addition\u201d to a period of suspension imposed under s 83(1)(b).

Due to his concerns regarding Pengrui\u2019s financial stability, Chambers suggested extending the cancelling date to 5 August 2021. 48', 'To save time, Chambers prepared Addendum No 2, which reflected the extended cancelling date and was signed by Milaha. Chambers forwarded Addendum No 2 to Pengrui on 27 July 2021. 49', '37\\u2003Pengrui did not respond to Addendum No 2. Instead, on 28 July 2021, Pengrui issued a seller\u2019s notice of default and demanded the return of the deposit. 50', 'Chambers responded by inviting Pengrui to execute the Addendum No 2 and followed up with tendering the two days\u2019 advance NOR, which was rejected by Pengrui on the same day. 51', '38\\u2003On 29 July 2021, 52', 'parties attended a conference call.

Chambers was not amenable to this, given the minor issues with the vessel and requested Lightship to arrange a conference call to discuss the next steps. 54', 'The conference call was arranged on 2 August 2021.', '40\\u2003Chambers accused Zhang of misleading the court (both in his first affidavit and by Pengrui\u2019s counsel at the hearing of the OS) in denying Zhang\u2019s attendance at the 2 August 2021 meeting.

It was only then that Wang spoke to Zhang to update him on Addendum No 2. 66', 'Unfortunately, Pengrui did not agree to Milaha\u2019s offer on the spud leg issue and Pengrui served the Notice of Cancellation on Milaha on 4 August 2021. 67', '47\\u2003Wang added that after the Notice of Cancellation was served, he received no further instructions from Pengrui, save for a request on 5 August to obtain from Milaha the ABS survey status report and to ascertain if there were any pending class conditions vis-\u00e0-vis the Vessel. Wang duly passed this request on to Milaha. 68', 'As Pengrui had cancelled the MOA and Wang was no longer instructed, Wang sought to broker a deal between Milaha and a new buyer, as he was aware there were other potential buyers of the Vessel in Tianjin. 69', '48\\u2003The facts in [7] to [47] outline the state of the affidavits when the Application was heard.'"}

That decision is the subject of a pending appeal. OTML\u2019s striking out application, which is the subject matter of these grounds, could not be heard together with PNGSDP\u2019s striking out application because, for various reasons, OTML was served with the writ of summons and entered an appearance in this action about six months after PNGSDP. 23', 'In that sense, PNGSDP has had the benefit of a six-month head start over OTML in its efforts to extricate itself from this action without a trial.', '17\\u2003The subject matter of this long running litigation was and is:', '(a)\\u2003the environmental damage caused by the Mine;', '(b)\\u2003the decision of the Mine\u2019s majority owner to cease its involvement in the Mine by transferring the Shares to PNGSDP in 2002 and the suite of contracts entered into on that occasion and at or around that time;', '(c)\\u2003the State\u2019s expropriation of the Shares in 2013; and', '(d)\\u2003a fund now worth about US$1.48 billion 24', 'which PNGSDP is bound to hold and administer in accordance with the suite of contracts.', '18\\u2003The general background to this long running litigation is set out in detail in State v PNGSDP (HC) at [8] to [36] and in State v PNGSDP (CA) at [5] to [11]. The background relevant to this specific action is set out in Ok Tedi (PNGSDP) at [15] to [37]. To enable this judgment to be read and understood on its own, it is necessary to restate some of the background from Ok Tedi (PNGSDP), supplemented as necessary by additional facts which are relevant only to the plaintiffs\u2019 claims against OTML.', '19\\u2003Until the Shares were transferred to PNGSDP in 2002, OTML\u2019s ultimate majority owner was a multinational mining company now known as BHP Group Limited (\u201cBHP Group\u201d). BHP Group incorporated OTML in 1981 to develop and operate the Mine. 25', 'Until 2002, OTML\u2019s shares were held as follows. BHP Group held 52% of OTML\u2019s shares through its wholly owned subsidiary, BHP Minerals Holdings Pty Ltd (\u201cBHP Minerals\u201d). 26', 'The State held 30% of OTML\u2019s shares: 20% directly and 10% through a corporate vehicle. A minority shareholder held the remaining 18% of OTML\u2019s shares. 27', '20\\u2003In 1995, the State and BHP Group established a system of statutory compensation for loss and damage caused by flooding arising from the operation of the Mine. The system comprised both general compensation payable to all residents of areas which suffered loss or damage and specific compensation payable to individuals who suffered particular loss or damage. 28', '21\\u2003Between 1994 and 1996, the members of the Affected Communities brought proceedings against BHP Group and OTML in the Supreme Court of Victoria and in Papua New Guinea. 29', 'They claimed compensation in those proceedings for the environmental damage which the Mine had caused and was continuing to cause to the Affected Communities.', '22\\u2003In 1996, all of these proceedings were settled. The terms of the settlement, broadly speaking, committed BHP Group to pay the claimants\u2019 legal costs and to underwrite the general compensation fund under the statutory scheme (see [20] above). In exchange, the claimants agreed to terminate the proceedings and support the statutory scheme, thereby becoming eligible to receive compensation under the scheme. 30', '23\\u2003In 1999, OTML commissioned a report to assess the risks which the Mine posed to human health and to the environment and to make recommendations. The preliminary recommendation in June 1999 was that the Mine close immediately, or at the latest by 2001. 31', 'That was well before the end of the Mine\u2019s economic life.', '24\\u2003BHP Group was concerned about the damage which the Mine\u2019s operation was causing to the environment in the Affected Communities and to BHP Group\u2019s corporate reputation in Australia. As a result, BHP Group was prepared to accept the recommendation and to close the Mine early. 32', 'But OTML\u2019s other shareholders and the State were opposed to early closure. 33', 'The Mine was extremely profitable for its shareholders and was an important contributor to Papua New Guinea\u2019s economy for the State (see State v PNGSDP (CA) at [5]). 34', 'They believed that it was possible to use part of the Mine\u2019s profits to prevent, mitigate and alleviate the past, present and future environmental damage arising from its operations. It is fair to say as well that the Mine brought economic and other benefits to the members of the Affected Communities which led the weight of opinion in the Affected Communities to oppose early closure.', '25\\u2003Given the diverging views between BHP Group on the one hand and OTML\u2019s shareholders and the State on the other, BHP Group decided to exit OTML. This would allow the remaining shareholders to continue to operate the Mine through OTML without BHP Group being involved or being exposed to legal and reputational risk. 35', 'The surrounding communities were told of BHP Group\u2019s exit plan (the \u201cExit Plan\u201d). 36', '26\\u2003In July 1999, as a result of the risk assessment report (see [23] above), OTML undertook a first round of community consultations to consider the way forward with the Mine, taking into account the environmental damage which it caused. 37', '27\\u2003In late 1999, the State invited the World Bank to comment on the risk assessment report. The World Bank accepted the report\u2019s conclusion that the preferred option to prevent further environmental damage to the Affected Communities was to close the Mine early. But the World Bank criticised the report for failing to consider the trade-offs involved in early closure and therefore failing to recognise that closure would inflict disastrous social costs on the Affected Communities and economic costs on Papua New Guinea and the State. 38', 'The World Bank therefore recommended a process of public consultation to arrive at a consensus on the way forward.', '28\\u2003As a result of the World Bank\u2019s recommendations, in February 2000, the State initiated a programme of further community consultations (\u201cthe Consultation Programme\u201d) 39', 'with the leaders of about 156 villages and over 100,000 inhabitants of six regions of the Western Province (\u201cthe CMCA Regions\u201d). 40', 'The CMCA Regions were the regions most directly affected by the operation of the Mine.', '29\\u2003The purpose of the Consultation Programme was: (a) to explain to those living in the CMCA Regions the environmental impact of mine continuation and the social and economic impact of mine closure; and (b) to ascertain from those most directly affected by the environmental damage whether they wanted the Mine to continue or to close and, in either case, on what terms. 41', 'Whatever the outcome, the intention was that the Consultation Programme would achieve finality between the State, the people of Papua New Guinea and OTML about the way forward with respect to the Mine. 42', '30\\u2003BHP Group was not involved in the Consultation Programme. 43', 'It had already taken a settled decision to exit OTML.', '31\\u2003The Consultation Programme was a joint effort of the State and OTML. 44', 'OTML established a Community Relations (\u201cCR\u201d) department to lead the Consultation Programme. 45', 'Each community nominated two members to represent them in the consultations. 46', 'Independent, non-governmental organisations observed the operation of the Consultation Programme to ensure that the communities were properly informed and their interests properly protected. 47', 'The Consultation Programme continued for about a year and involved several rounds of what started as consultations and then became negotiations. 48', '32\\u2003The Consultation Programme found widespread support for mine continuation, so long as the existing statutory compensation scheme (see [20] above) was enhanced to address the environmental damage the Mine had caused and was continuing to cause. In-principle agreements to this effect were recorded in six heads of agreement (\u201cthe CMCA Heads of Agreement\u201d). The parties to the CMCA Heads of Agreement were OTML, the State, the provincial government of the Western Province and each of the six CMCA Regions. 49', '33\\u2003Although the CMCA Heads of Agreement were not in themselves a binding or final resolution, they expressly envisaged a binding and final resolution in two ways. First, they provided that, if the State decided in favour of mine continuation, each CMCA Region would negotiate and enter into a mine continuation agreement with OTML which would set out the terms on which the Mine would continue to operate. 50', 'Second, they also provided that these mine continuation agreements would cover all issues and achieve binding finality on the terms of mine continuation in perpetuity. 51', '34\\u2003OTML and the CMCA Regions then negotiated the mine continuation agreements. 52', 'Some of the six CMCA Regions were further subdivided, creating a total of ten CMCA Regions. OTML and the ten CMCA Regions entered into ten separate Community Mine Continuation Agreements (\u201cCMCAs\u201d) between November 2001 and April 2004. 53', '35\\u2003The CMCAs set out the terms for mine continuation. So long as the Mine continued in operation, the CMCAs obliged OTML to pay to each CMCA Region annual compensation for: (a) the environmental damage caused by the Mine; (b) for depriving the CMCA Region of possession of land; and (c) for associated loss and damage. 54', '36\\u2003OTML\u2019s case is that the CMCAs set out with finality as against the ten CMCA Regions the terms on which OTML would continue to operate the Mine. 55', \"It is also OTML\u2019s case that the purpose of the compensation scheme agreed in the CMCAs was to compensate the ten CMCA Regions, thereby discharging OTML's obligation to pay statutory compensation to the CMCA Regions in accordance with Papua New Guinea\u2019s Mining Act. 56\", '37\\u2003While all this was going on, two individuals acting as representatives of their respective communities commenced two class actions in the Supreme Court of Victoria against BHP Group and OTML (\u201cthe 2000 Class Actions\u201d). The claimants alleged that BHP Group and OTML had breached the 1996 settlement agreement (see [15] above). 57', 'These claimants included but were not limited to members of the ten CMCA Regions.', '38\\u2003Once the CMCAs were agreed, the ten CMCA Regions chose to receive compensation and other benefits from OTML under the terms of the CMCAs rather than to continue with the 2000 Class Action. 58', 'As a result, the terms of the CMCAs obliged the ten CMCA Regions to opt out of the Class Action and to release OTML and BHP Group from all liability. 59', '39\\u2003In 2003, the 2000 Class Actions came to an end when all of the remaining claimants entered into a settlement agreement. 60', '40\\u2003In the meantime, BHP Group had settled on the mechanics of its Exit Plan. A key part of the plan was for BHP Minerals to transfer the Shares to a special purpose vehicle. PNGSDP was incorporated in Singapore in October 2001 to be that special purpose vehicle. 61', '41\\u2003PNGSDP\u2019s corporate constitution is set out in three documents: (a) its Memorandum of Association; (b) its Articles of Association (\u201cthe Articles\u201d); and (c) a schedule to the Articles called the \u201cRules of the PNG Sustainable Development Program\u201d. This schedule is more commonly referred to as \u201cthe Program Rules\u201d. 62', '42\\u2003PNGSDP\u2019s objects, as recorded in its memorandum of association, include promoting sustainable development within Papua New Guinea and advancing the general welfare of the people of Papua New Guinea \u2013 particularly those of the Western Province \u2013 through programmes and projects for social and environmental purposes for their benefit. It is significant that PNGSDP\u2019s objects refer to the people of the Western Province and of Papua New Guinea generally and do not refer to the CMCA Regions, the Affected Communities or their members specifically.', '43\\u2003The Program Rules have effect as part of the statutory contract embodied in the Articles as between PNGSDP and its members for the time being.', '44\\u2003The Program Rules have two key aspects.', '45\\u2003First, the central provision of the Program Rules obliges PNGSDP to establish a fund known as the Long Term Fund. The purpose of the Long Term Fund is to hold, broadly speaking, two thirds of all Distributions together with the accumulated investment income earned on the Long Term Fund. 63', 'Under the Program Rules, PNGSDP undertook express contractual obligations to its members as to how it was to apply: (a) Distributions; (b) the Long Term Fund; and (c) investment income earned on the Long Term Fund.', '46\\u2003Second, cl 9 of the Program Rules, among other things, both permits and obliges PNGSDP to apply Distributions for the benefit of two classes of people: (a) the people of the Western Province; and (b) the people of Papua New Guinea. 64', 'Both of these classes include, but are not confined to, members of Affected Communities. This is because not all of the communities in the Western Province have been affected by the environmental damage caused by the Mine. The members of the Affected Communities are therefore a subset of the people of the Western Province, who are in turn a subset of the people of Papua New Guinea. The plaintiffs complain about this feature of the Program Rules and describe it as \u201cthe Shared Benefits Arrangement\u201d. 65', '47\\u2003In 2002, BHP Group caused BHP Minerals to transfer the Shares to PNGSDP and thereby achieved its objective of exiting OTML. 66', 'PNGSDP paid BHP Minerals and BHP Group no monetary consideration for the Shares. The consideration was instead the suite of contracts which preceded 67', 'and accompanied 68', 'the transfer. Part of the purpose of this suite of interlocking and interdependent contracts was to release and insulate BHP Group and persons affiliated with it (apart from OTML) from all liability arising from past and future environmental damage caused by the Mine.', '48\\u2003Four of these contractual arrangements are relevant for present purposes.', '49\\u2003First, BHP Group, the State, OTML and OTML\u2019s shareholders entered into a contract known as the Ok Tedi Mine Continuation (Ninth Supplemental) Agreement (\u201cNinth Supplemental Agreement\u201d). 69', 'By this contract, BHP Group confirmed its intention to exit OTML and agreed that BHP Minerals should transfer the Shares to PNGSDP. 70', 'The State went on to give legislative effect to the Ninth Supplemental Agreement by enacting the Mining (Ok Tedi Mine Extension (Ninth Supplemental) Agreement) Act 2001 (No 7 of 2001) (PNG). 71', 'The first schedule to the Act is the Ninth Supplemental Agreement. The second schedule to the Act comprises the CMCAs.', '50\\u2003Second, PNGSDP entered into a contract known as the \u201cMaster Agreement\u201d with BHP Group, OTML and all of OTML\u2019s shareholders. 72', 'By cl 3.1 of the Master Agreement, BHP Minerals agreed to transfer the Shares to PNGSDP. 73', 'The consideration for this transfer was PNGSDP\u2019s contractual undertaking in cl 3.2 of the Master Agreement to comply with the Program Rules. 74', 'PNGSDP gave this undertaking expressly for the benefit of four entities: BHP Minerals, BHP Group, the State and OTML.', '51\\u2003Third, PNGSDP executed two deeds of indemnity: one in favour of BHP Group (\u201cBHP\u2019s Indemnity\u201d) 75', 'and another in favour of the State (\u201cthe State\u2019s Indemnity\u201d). 76', 'Under these indemnities, PNGSDP agreed to indemnify BHP, the State and a very broadly defined group of affiliates (apart from OTML) for any and all liability arising from any future environmental damage caused by the Mine. 77', '52\\u2003Finally, in February 2002, as security for the punctual performance of its obligations under BHP\u2019s Indemnity and the State\u2019s Indemnity, PNGSDP entered into: (a) a security deed (\u201cthe Security Deed\u201d); 78', '(b) an equitable mortgage over the Shares (\u201cthe Equitable Mortgage\u201d); 79', 'and (c) a security trust deed (\u201cthe Security Trust Deed\u201d). 80', 'I shall refer to these three contracts collectively as \u201cthe Security Arrangements\u201d. 81', '53\\u2003The parties to the Security Deed are PNGSDP, OTML and the Security Trustee. 82', 'By the Security Deed, PNGSDP created an equitable mortgage over Distributions and a fixed and floating charge over virtually all of PNGSDP\u2019s present and future assets in favour of the Security Trustee for the benefit of the State and BHP as security for the punctual performance of its obligations under BHP\u2019s Indemnity and the State\u2019s Indemnity. 83', 'The Security Deed required PNGSDP to deposit with the Security Trustee a duly executed blank transfer form in respect of the Shares and to direct OTML to forward the original certificates for the Shares directly to the Security Trustee once OTML had issued them in PNGSDP\u2019s name. 84', '54\\u2003The parties to the Equitable Mortgage are PNGSDP and the Security Trustee. By the Equitable Mortgage, PNGSDP created in favour of the Security Trustee an equitable mortgage over its present and future interest in the Shares, in all after-acquired shares in OTML and in all future rights arising from these shares as security for the punctual performance of its obligations under BHP\u2019s Indemnity and the State\u2019s Indemnity. 85', '55\\u2003The parties to the Security Trust Deed are the Security Trustee, PNGSDP, BHP Group, the State and OTML. The Security Trust Deed sets out the rights, duties, powers and immunities of the Security Trustee. 86', '56\\u2003The CMCAs 87', 'envisaged the State, OTML, the CMCA Regions and PNGSDP engaging in discussions from time to time to review the operation of the CMCAs. 88', 'One such review was held in 2011. At the conclusion of that review, the parties agreed to allow the Mine to operate until 2025. To record this agreement, the parties executed nine CMCA extension agreements in 2012 (\u201cCMCA EAs\u201d). The State went on to give legislative effect to the CMCA EAs by enacting the Mining (Ok Tedi Mine Extension (Eleventh Supplemental) Agreement) Act 2014 (No 56 of 2014) (PNG) (the \u201cEleventh Supplemental Agreement Act\u201d). 89', '57\\u2003Under the CMCAs and the CMCA EAs, OTML has made payments totalling approximately PGK874.16m, or almost $340m, to the CMCA Regions from 2001 to 2020. 90', 'The plaintiffs do not allege that OTML has breached any of its obligations under the CMCAs or the CMCA EAs. 91', '58\\u2003In 2013, during an intractable dispute between the State and PNGSDP over control of PNGSDP which led to the earlier litigation in Singapore, the State expropriated the Shares without compensation. 92', 'It did this by enacting legislation 93', 'which cancelled the Shares and obliged OTML to issue to the State new shares equivalent to 52% of OTML\u2019s issued and paid-up share capital.', '59\\u2003As a result, PNGSDP ceased to be a shareholder of OTML in 2013. With that, PNGSDP stopped receiving Distributions. PNGSDP continues, however, to hold the Long Term Fund and the investment income which it continues to generate subject to its corporate constitution including the Program Rules.', '60\\u2003The plaintiffs commenced this action in July 2020 against OTML, PNGSDP, Sir Mekere, the State and the Security Trustee. The impetus for this action is said to be (see [73] below) my finding in State v PNGSDP (HC) (at [301]\u2013[341]) that PNGSDP did not hold the OTML shares, Distributions or the Long Term Fund on any sort of trust for the people of Papua New Guinea, let alone specifically for the members of the Affected Communities (see also State v PNGSDP (CA) at [11]). One of my reasons for arriving at this finding was that the provisions of the Security Deed were inconsistent with any such trust (State v PNGSDP (HC) at [320]\u2013[331]).'"}

In this connection, the co-defendant filed two applications against Loh, seeking: (a) a gag order prohibiting the disclosure of the identities of witnesses or parties to the divorce proceedings (\u201cSUM 2128\u201d); and (b) an order to strike out Loh\u2019s claim against him entirely, or alternatively, to strike out portions of Loh\u2019s Statement of Particulars (\u201cSOP\u201d) (\u201cSUM 2009\u201d). These applications were scheduled to be heard on 27 July 2015.', '6\\u2003When Koh was retained by Loh, some 20 days prior to the scheduled hearing, he also received his first set of instructions as to how Loh wished his case to be run. Loh specifically noted that it was important to him to establish that the co-defendant was the initiator of the adulterous affair. The notes of this meeting reflect that Loh\u2019s desire to establish this stemmed from his view that this would help him get a sense of personal closure, and also help him explain to his children that the co-defendant had enticed their mother, so that the proceedings would not cast her in a bad light. Koh seemed to have recognised the importance of this point to Loh. Towards the end of the meeting, he is noted as observing that although the SOP drafted by Loh needed to be \u201creworked\u201d, they needed to \u201cprevent [Loh\u2019s then-wife and the co-defendant] from getting a moral victory\u201d.', '7\\u2003From this point until the hearing on 27 July 2015, the flow of communications between Loh and Koh was entirely one-sided. On 8 July, Loh sent an e-mail to Koh setting out the arguments in support of his case that it was the co-defendant who had enticed Loh\u2019s wife. Koh did not respond to this e-mail. On 14 July, Loh then sent a detailed e-mail to Koh, setting out his \u201cfirst cut\u201d responses to SUM 2009. From this e-mail, it would have been clear to Koh which particulars Loh wished to defend, and which he did not object to being struck out or amended. However, it may be noted that Loh prefaced this e-mail as follows:', 'Koh, again, did not respond.', '8\\u2003On 15 July, Loh received an e-mail from Koh\u2019s paralegal, attaching a notice from the Family Justice Courts (\u201cFJC\u201d). The court directed, by this notice, that the skeletal submissions for SUM 2009 and SUM 2128 were to be filed by 24 July. On the next day, 16 July, Loh e-mailed Koh, asking what he intended to put forth in the written skeletal submissions that the court had directed be filed. Loh wrote that there was \u201c[n]o rush\u201d, and asked Koh to extend him a copy of the submissions whenever they were ready. Koh did not respond.', '9\\u2003On 24 July, Loh wrote to Koh again. In this e-mail, Loh referred to his meeting with Koh on 7 July, where the latter had suggested that he might be in touch with opposing counsel on the amendment of pleadings before the upcoming case conference. Querying whether Koh had acted on this suggestion since 7 July, Loh asked, \u201c[a]re there any developments? What is our strategy?\u201d There was, again, no response.', '10\\u2003On 26 July, a day before the hearing, Loh sent yet another e-mail which, again, drew no reply Koh. In this, he wrote:', '11\\u2003It is apposite to highlight at this point that Koh subsequently conceded \u2013 under cross-examination during proceedings before the disciplinary tribunal \u2013 that he did not speak to Loh at all between 7 and 27 July 2015. Hence, there were no meetings, calls or conversations which need to be interposed into the sequence of foregoing e-mails, and inferences may be drawn from them with this in mind.', '12\\u2003On the morning of 27 July 2015, Koh attended the hearing of SUM 2009 and SUM 2128 before Assistant Registrar Eugene Tay (\u201cAR Tay\u201d) at the FJC. At the hearing, Koh made certain representations to AR Tay regarding his instructions from Loh. The first was that he had spoken to counsel for the co-defendant, Mr Nicholas Narayanan (\u201cMr Narayanan\u201d), and that they were trying to reach a settlement \u201cin terms of pleadings\u201d. However, as he had been \u201cunable to get [Loh\u2019s] confirmation\u201d, they would be proceeding with the hearing of the striking-out application. The second was made in response to AR Tay\u2019s follow-up question further into the proceedings as to whether Loh was then contesting \u201ceverything that [the co-defendant\u2019s counsel had applied] to strike out\u201d. To this, Koh said, \u201cYes. No instructions to agree\u201d.', '13\\u2003Neither representation was true. First, as the one-way nature of Loh and Koh\u2019s correspondence in the 20 days preceding the hearing shows, there was no question of Koh having been \u201cunable\u201d to secure confirmation. He had just not made any effort to seek any instructions from Loh. Second, Loh had made it clear to Koh that he did not object to the striking out of certain paragraphs. Therefore, it was not the case that Koh did not have any instructions to agree. For example, in one paragraph of the SOP, Loh had averred, amongst other things, that the co-defendant was \u201cnot only a liar and an adulterer\u201d but also of a \u201cvindictive nature\u201d. In Loh\u2019s e-mail to Koh on 14 July 2015, his remark in respect of this paragraph was \u201c[w]e can strike this one out as a concession\u201d. As regards another paragraph, in which Loh had made averments which were wholly irrelevant, he indicated in his 14 July e-mail that \u201c[w]e can strike out [the] portions they want\u201d.', '14\\u2003In any event, notwithstanding what Koh said to AR Tay, as the hearing progressed, Koh agreed to numerous paragraphs of Loh\u2019s SOP being struck out by consent. In total, Koh agreed to 19 paragraphs (or parts thereof) being struck out by consent. Fourteen of these were paragraphs which Loh expressly did not consent to being struck out. Indeed, Loh\u2019s instructions as regards some of these paragraphs could not, in our view, have been any clearer. To illustrate, in relation to a paragraph in which he averred that the co-defendant had received and kept certain compromising photos of his ex-wife, Loh\u2019s instruction was, \u201c[n]o to striking out. This is proof of [a] sexual affair\u201d.', '15\\u2003After the hearing, Koh called Loh to inform him that AR Tay had ruled against him in respect of both SUM 2009 and SUM 2128. Although Koh and Loh agree that this conversation took place, their respective accounts as to the precise content of that conversation differ on one salient point. Koh claims that he informed Loh he had conceded \u2013 as opposed to \u201cconsented\u201d \u2013 to the striking out of various parts of the SOP. Loh, on the other hand, contends that he asked Koh to inform him which particulars had been struck out, but Koh was unable to recall because of the number of paragraphs they had dealt with. On Loh\u2019s account, Koh never mentioned conceding to the striking out of any of the particulars in question.', '16\\u2003On the following day, 28 July 2015, Loh was informed in writing by Koh\u2019s paralegal of the particulars that had been struck out by AR Tay. Conspicuously, the e-mail to Loh did not mention that the assistant registrar\u2019s orders relating to certain paragraphs (or sub-paragraphs) had been made by consent. Instead, particulars which had been struck out by consent were captured under the heading, \u201cTo be strike [sic] out unless otherwise stated as per submitted by the Co-Defendant\u201d. We are mindful that on 31 July 2015, Koh\u2019s paralegal sent another e-mail to Loh enclosing: (a) the draft orders of court from the co-defendant\u2019s counsel; and (b) Koh\u2019s letter responding with the endorsed orders. The first order made in respect of SUM 2009 was as follows: \u201cThat by consent, the paragraphs set out at Annex A herein, as submitted in the Co-Defendant\u2019s Submissions filed on 24 July 2015, be struck out\u201d. Annex A is correspondingly titled, \u201cStruck out by consent\u201d. However, we note that the fact and impact of the consent orders were not specifically called to Loh\u2019s attention. Indeed, as we will set out momentarily, the subsequent exchanges between Loh and Koh suggest that the former did not appreciate that the orders had been made by consent.', '17\\u2003After the first update on 28 July 2015 and prior to 11 August 2015, Loh stated in 21 e-mails that he was unhappy with the result of the hearing and wished to appeal AR Tay\u2019s orders in respect of both SUM 2009 and SUM 2128. In seven of these 21 e-mails, Loh asked specifically that he be sent a copy of the court\u2019s notes of argument. To illustrate their tone, one of Loh\u2019s e-mails, sent on 4 August, reads as follows:', 'Koh did not respond to this e-mail. In fact, as was the case with the pre-hearing correspondence, Koh also did not respond to most of Loh\u2019s e-mails sent on or after 28 July.', '18\\u2003We highlight in particular an exchange of e-mails that took place between 6 and 11 August 2015. By 6 August, Loh had already instructed Koh, on several occasions, to file appeals against the orders made by AR Tay in both SUM 2009 and SUM 2128. On that day, Koh filed an appeal in respect of SUM 2128. However, no appeal was filed for SUM 2009. When Loh asked why the latter appeal had not been filed, Koh responded on 7 August, stating that it \u201c[might] prove to be a superfluous exercise given that [they were] amending the SOP\u201d. Koh added, \u201c[i]n any event I am not confident that you will succeed in the [a]ppeal given that submissions and opinions and evidence are not allowed to stand as pleadings\u201d. Loh acknowledged Koh\u2019s explanation but reiterated later that same day that his instructions were, nevertheless, to file an appeal. There was no response from Koh, and it was only after Loh involved the Firm\u2019s managing partner on 11 August 2015 that Koh prepared the appeal papers for SUM 2009, and sent them to Loh for his review and approval.', '19\\u2003The appeal against the orders made in SUM 2009 was eventually filed within time, on 11 August 2015. Even so, despite the appeal having been filed, there is nothing in writing showing that Koh informed Loh that some of the striking-out orders had been entered into by consent, much less that Koh had advised Loh that, because of this, it would likely be impossible to succeed on appeal. Furthermore, Koh did not provide Loh with a copy of the notes of argument that he had been seeking since 28 July 2015. Loh ultimately obtained these notes on 2 September 2015 by applying directly to the FJC, after he had discharged Koh and started representing himself on 12 August 2015.', '20\\u2003On the day after Loh obtained the notes of argument, 3 September 2015, Loh e-mailed Koh asking six questions which concerned Koh\u2019s handling of his matter. We set out only two of these six questions, which are salient for present purposes. First, Loh asked why Koh had failed to act promptly on his repeated instructions to file an appeal against the orders made by AR Tay in SUM 2009. Second, and more pertinently for present purposes, Loh asked why Koh had failed to disclose that certain particulars had been struck out by consent, and further, when his consent for such a course had been secured.', '21\\u2003Koh did not respond to this e-mail, and also seemingly ignored chasers sent by Loh on 13 and 29 January 2016. Finally, on 5 February 2016, after Loh again involved the Firm\u2019s managing partner, Koh responded. He claimed not to have seen Loh\u2019s e-mails, which allegedly \u201cwent into [his] junk mail folder\u201d. In response to Loh\u2019s first question, Koh wrote that he was \u201cunder the impression that [Loh] wanted to move the divorce proceedings along so that [he] could proceed with the ancillary matters\u201d. We digress to note that this could not in any meaningful way be seen as a response to the question that Loh had asked, which was specifically why Koh had not acted promptly on his express instructions to file the appeal. Even if Koh generally believed that Loh wished for his divorce to proceed expeditiously, that does not answer why, in the face of repeated and clear instructions to file an appeal in SUM 2009, Koh did not act on the specific instructions that Loh had conveyed.', '22\\u2003As to the second question, Koh replied, \u201cI had told you that there were certain para[graph]s that would be struck out and I exercised my discretion as counsel to consent to the obvious ones in order to try and mitigate the issue of costs\u201d [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]. Loh\u2019s question and Koh\u2019s response are significant. The very fact that Loh asked this question on 3 September 2015, and repeatedly prompted Koh to respond, is telling. It undermines the latter\u2019s claim (see [15] above) that he informed Loh about this fact immediately after the hearing. Indeed, the tenor of Koh\u2019s own response suggests that this was the first time he was addressing this with Loh. Furthermore, it confirms that Koh had acted of his own volition, and not on the basis of Loh\u2019s instructions, in agreeing to at least some of the particulars being struck out.', '23\\u2003The exchanges continued. From 12 to 24 February 2016, Loh confronted Koh with several inconsistencies in his responses, and suggested that Koh had not responded to Loh\u2019s post-hearing e-mails and queries to \u201cconceal the truth of what really happened on 27 July 2015\u201d. Specifically, Loh alleged that Koh had been negligent in the conduct of his matter, and had deliberately delayed filing his appeal because doing so \u201cwould have opened [his conduct during the hearing] up to scrutiny\u201d. The last reply sent by Koh did not address these suggestions or allegations. Instead, Koh simply remarked that he regretted that their relationship had deteriorated to such an extent. Again, Koh said nothing that would suggest that he had, immediately after the hearing, informed Loh what had transpired and, as he would later claim in the proceedings before the disciplinary tribunal, that he had nothing to hide because he was acting within the scope of Loh\u2019s instructions.', '24\\u2003We should also mention another noteworthy event that took place in the background. On 23 September 2015, Loh proceeded with his appeal against the orders made by AR Tay in SUM 2009. The district judge who heard the appeal reinstated around seven pages of particulars which had been struck out by AR Tay, though none of these included the 19 paragraphs (or parts thereof) which had been struck out by consent. It also appears from the record that the district judge highlighted to Loh that even though many of the striking-out orders had been made by consent, he would nevertheless consider the substantive merits of Loh\u2019s appeal in respect of those orders, rather than decline to consider them on the basis that they had been consented to.', '25\\u2003Against that backdrop, we outline the procedural history of the matter.'"}

{"casename":"2022_SGHC_86","fact":"the facts \nsuggest otherwise. The plaintiffs\u2019 case is that the defendants had misused the \nplaintiffs\u2019 client revenue information to solicit the plaintiffs\u2019 clients by offering \ncheaper prices to undercut the plaintiffs\u2019 prices. The plaintiffs\u2019 basis for seeking \nthe non-solicitation injunctions was to remove the unfair competitive advantage \nthat the defendants had unfairly obtained by using the plaintiffs\u2019 confidential \ninformation, and not to protect the confidential information itself. Therefore, I \nam of the view that the non-solicitation injunctions are, what is commonly \nunderstood as, \u201cspringboard\u201d injunctions.\n17 Nevertheless, I find that the non-solicitation injunctions should be \ngranted in the present case because the requirements laid out in Goh Seng Heng \nhave been met. The KPMG Report suggests that the defendants are in \npossession of the Revenue Spreadsheet, which contains confidential \ninformation of the plaintiff pertaining to the revenue the plaintiff receives from \neach client. The circumstances of the case further suggest that the defendants \nmight have already used the client revenue data to undercut the plaintiffs\u2019 prices, \nVersion No 2: 19 Apr 2022 (13:55 hrs)\nPacific Prime Insurance Brokers Singapore Pte Ltd [2022] SGHC 86\nv Lee Suet Fern \n9and that some of the plaintiffs\u2019 clients have moved their business to the \ndefendants. The core issue in dispute is whether the information on client \nrevenue gave the defendants an unfair competitive edge. I am of the view that \nit does. Having the data on how much each client pays the plaintiffs, the \ndefendants are able to offer services at a lower price to undercut the plaintiffs, \nwhich will certainly be considered a competitive advantage. In fact, in the email \nsent by Baxter to the plaintiffs, it can be seen that Baxter moved their business \nto the Afeli entities because they were able to offer \u201ca substantially lower cost \nstructure\u201d. This suggests, if anything, that there is a real risk of the defendant \nmisusing the plaintiffs\u2019 confidential information to give themselves an \u201cunfair \nadvantage\u201d in terms of pricing, and that the \u201cunfair advantage\u201d is still being \nenjoyed by the defendant.\n18 The defendants say that since the confidential client revenue data in the \nRevenue Spreadsheet contains no pricing information, there can be no \ncompetitive advantage. I disagree. The Revenue Spreadsheet shows the \nbreakdown of the revenue the plaintiffs received from their clients for their \nservices. Even without detailed pricing information, the knowledge of the exact \namount each client pays the plaintiffs would allow the defendants to price their \nservices accordingly to undercut the plaintiffs. \n19 For completeness, I find that damages would not be adequate to \ncompensate the plaintiffs in the present case. The Revenue Spreadsheet contains \nconfidential revenue information from 318 clients of the plaintiffs. Even if, as \nthe defendants claim, 17 of the clients had terminated their appointment with \nthe plaintiffs prior to April 2021, there is still a very significant number of \nclients on the list that are current clients of the plaintiffs. The non-solicitation \ninjunctions are therefore necessary to prevent the defendants from using the \nVersion No 2: 19 Apr 2022 (13:55 hrs)\nPacific Prime Insurance Brokers Singapore Pte Ltd [2022] SGHC 86\nv Lee Suet Fern \n10confidential information in the Revenue Spreadsheet to further undercut the \nplaintiffs and siphon off businesses from the plaintiffs. Notwithstanding the \ninjunctions, the defendants remain free to carry on their business as long as they \ndo not solicit the plaintiffs\u2019 clients or rely on the plaintiffs\u2019 confidential \ninformation. Any losses suffered by the defendants as a result of the interim \ninjunctions can be compensated with damages. \n20 I am minded that a \u201cspringboard\u201d injunction is not meant to be \nmaintained indefinitely and is only meant to be in place for such time as it would \ntake the wrongdoer to achieve lawfully what he was hoping to achieve \nunlawfully, relative to the plaintiff (Jardine Lloyd Thompson Pte Ltd v Howden \nInsurance Brokers (S) Pte Ltd [2015] 5 SLR 258 at [21]). In the present case, I \nam of the view that the non-solicitation injunctions should be effective for six \nmonths from the date of this judgment. By then, both sides ought to be able to \ncompete against each other on reasonably even terms. The plaintiffs, for \nexample, would \u2013 or at least they should \u2013 have completed damage control and \ntaken steps to stop the bleeding, if any, to prevent further losses. The defendants, \non the other hand, would be steadier on their feet, and would be able to meet \ntheir rivals evenly too. Therefore, I will allow the defendants to vary \nparagraphs 1(b), 2(a) and 3(b) of the Injunction Order to limit the duration of \nthe non-solicitation injunctions to six months from the date of this judgment. It \nshould be borne in mind that the non-solicitation injunctions were first granted \nabout six months ago. So an overall 12 months protection would be adequate to \nbring the plaintiffs\u2019 position back on even keel.\n21 Turning to the issue of material non-disclosure, I am of the view that \nalthough there may have been matters which the plaintiffs omitted to disclose, \nVersion No 2: 19 Apr 2022 (13:55 hrs)\nPacific Prime Insurance Brokers Singapore Pte Ltd [2022] SGHC 86\nv Lee Suet Fern \n11they are not material non-disclosures that are sufficient to discharge the \ninjunction orders. My reasons are as follows:\n(a) First, although the plaintiffs could have told the court that Jez\u2019s \nemployment contract did not contain a non-solicitation clause, the \nplaintiffs\u2019 omission is not fatal because Jez\u2019s employment contract has \nbeen provided in full in the affidavit of Oliver Xavier Jean Claude Zeller. \nFurthermore, the plaintiffs are not relying on any contractual basis for \nthe non-solicitation injunctions. Instead, the non-solicitation injunctions \nwere sought to give effect to the confidentiality obligations arising from \nthe confidentiality provisions in Jez\u2019s employment contract, which was \nnot disputed by the parties.\n(b) Second, in relation to the non-disclosure of the exodus of \nemployees who resigned from the plaintiffs after the Acquisition, I am \nof the view there is no material non-disclosure. The fact that other \nemployees had decided to leave the plaintiffs\u2019 employ around the same \ntime may be relevant for the trial, it does not change the fact that at least \nfive of the plaintiffs\u2019 former employees resigned from the plaintiffs to \njoin the defendants\u2019 rival incipient business.\n(c) Third, I find that there was no material non-disclosure of the \ncircumstances in which the plaintiffs\u2019 clients have moved their business \nto the Afeli Entities. The email to the plaintiffs from Baxter dated 30 \nSeptember 2021 suggests that the main reason that Baxter decided to \nmove their business to the Afeli Entities is that the Afeli Entities were \nable to offer a cost structure that is much cheaper than the plaintiffs. This \nis consistent with the plaintiffs\u2019 case that there has been a misuse of the \nVersion No 2: 19 Apr 2022 (13:55 hrs)\nPacific Prime Insurance Brokers Singapore Pte Ltd [2022] SGHC 86\nv Lee Suet Fern \n12confidential client revenue information by the defendants to undercut \nthe plaintiffs. \n(d) Fourth, I agree that it may not be completely accurate to say that \nRicky had \u201ccomplete access\u201d to the source codes of CXA1 if he had only \n\u201csupervised access\u201d. However, I am of the view that this does not \namount to a material non-disclosure. The plaintiffs clarified that \n\u201csupervised access\u201d in this case does not mean that Ricky had to seek \napprovals before he could access the source codes. Instead, it simply \nmeant that there will be a record if Ricky so chooses to access the source \ncodes. The \u201csupervision\u201d to Ricky\u2019s access is, therefore, ex post facto in \nnature and does not prevent Ricky from accessing the source code. \n(e) Lastly, in relation to the non-disclosure that the information in \nthe Revenue Spreadsheet is outdated, I am of the view that this does not \namount to a material non-disclosure. Even if the Revenue Spreadsheet \nonly contained client revenue data as of 3 August 2020, it could be still \nused by the defendants to approach the plaintiffs\u2019 clients and undercut \nthe plaintiffs. Generally, information like pricing does not change \ndrastically on a year-on-year basis, and historical prices are always \ncommercially useful for planning purposes. \n22 Turning to the defendants\u2019 argument that the non-solicitation clause in \nNellie\u2019s employment contract should be struck down for being an unreasonable \nrestraint of trade, I am of the view that the reasonableness and validity of the \nnon-solicitation clause should not be assessed at the interlocutory stage (Littau \nRobin Duane v Astrata (Asia Pacific) Pte Ltd [2010] SGHC 361 at [30]). The \nrelevant threshold at this stage is whether there is \u201ca serious question to be \ntried\u201d, which has been readily satisfied by the plaintiffs. In any event, the \nVersion No 2: 19 Apr 2022 (13:55 hrs)\nPacific Prime Insurance Brokers Singapore Pte Ltd [2022] SGHC 86\nv Lee Suet Fern \n13plaintiffs\u2019 basis for seeking the non-solicitation injunction against Nellie is not \nthat there is an enforceable non-solicitation clause in Nellie\u2019s employment \ncontract. Rather, as mentioned above, the plaintiffs are seeking the non-\nsolicitation injunction against Nellie to prevent the defendants from gaining any \nunfair competitive advantage from their misuse of the plaintiffs\u2019 confidential \ninformation. Therefore, the issue of the enforceability of the non-solicitation \nclause may well be rendered moot.\n23 Lastly, I am of the view that the balance of convenience lies in favour \nof the plaintiff and that maintaining the injunctions carries a lower risk of \ninjustice than not doing so. This is especially when the confidential information \nin question includes the information of the plaintiffs\u2019 client revenues and \nproprietary information pertaining to CXA1.  Once the confidentiality of such \ninformation is breached, it will be permanently lost. Therefore, the balance of \nconvenience favours the preservation of this confidentiality, pending the \ndetermination of this action. However, I agree with the defendants that the \ncurrent scope of the confidentiality injunctions against the second and third \ndefendants, found in paragraphs 2(b) and 3(a) of the Injunction Order, is too \nwide because they contain the term \u201cor other information\u201d. I will therefore allow \nthe defendants to vary paragraphs 2(b) and 3(a) of the Injunction Order to limit \nthe scope of the confidentiality injunctions by making their proposed \namendments and deleting the terms \u201cor other information\u201d. \n24 For the aforementioned reasons, I dismiss the defendants\u2019 application to \ndischarge the non-injunction injunctions and the confidentiality injunctions, but \nallow the defendants to vary paragraphs 1(b), 2(a) and 3(b) of the Injunction \nOrder to limit the duration of the non-solicitation injunction to six months, and \nto make their proposed amendments to paragraphs 2(b) and 3(a) of the \nVersion No 2: 19 Apr 2022 (13:55 hrs)\nPacific Prime Insurance Brokers Singapore Pte Ltd [2022] SGHC 86\nv Lee Suet Fern \n14Injunction Order to limit the scope of the confidentiality injunctions.

She was a freelance nurse at the \nmaterial time and advertised her babysitting services on the Internet sometime \nin 2016, stating therein that she was a nurse. She resided in an apartment in \nHougang with her two teenage daughters. \n7 Sometime in October 2016, the mother of BB1 (\u201cM1\u201d) was looking for \nbabysitting services for her children, and was contacted by the Appellant. M1 \nstarted sending over BB1 and her elder daughter of five years old to the \nAppellant\u2019s home for babysitting sometime in early November 2016. Generally, \nshe would send them over at around 7.30am and pick them up at around 6pm \nlater that day. \n8 The Appellant babysat BB1 and her sister on eight occasions between 7 \nNovember and 9 December 2016. The Appellant was the primary caregiver to \nBB1 during these times and would feed her, including personally preparing her \nmilk. This was save for one occasion where one of the Appellant\u2019s daughters \ndid so. It was agreed that the Appellant\u2019s daughters did not administer any \npoisons or any stupefying, intoxicating or unwholesome drugs to BB1 during \nthese babysitting sessions. \nVersion No 3: 29 Jul 2022 (08:40 hrs)\nSa\u2019adiah bte Jamari v PP[2022] SGHC 88\n49 On 22 November 2016, M1 brought BB1 to KK Women\u2019s and \nChildren\u2019s Hospital (\u201cKKH\u201d) for a check-up, as she noticed that BB1 was \nbehaving unusually. KKH took a blood sample from BB1 and subsequently \ndischarged her as nothing unusual was found. The blood test did not check for \nany medication or drugs in BB1\u2019s blood.\n10 On 9 December 2016, after picking BB1 up from the Appellant\u2019s home, \nM1 noticed that BB1 was unnaturally drowsy. She brought BB1 to Parkway \nEast Hospital (\u201cPEH\u201d), whereupon BB1 was admitted. A medical memo dated \n16 February 2017 stated that she was found to be drowsy, floppy and unable to \nfollow objects. A blood sample taken from BB1 on 9 December 2016 was sent \nto the Health Sciences Authority (\u201cHSA\u201d) for analysis on 12 December 2016, \nand was found to contain the following substances: \n(a) Alprazolam \u2013 0.37ug\/ml;\n(b) Chlorpheniramine \u2013 0.14ug\/ml;\n(c) (Dextro)methorphan \u2013 0.19ug\/ml;\n(d) Diazepam \u2013 0.28ug\/ml;\n(e) Nordiazepam \u2013 0.90ug\/ml;\n(f) Orphenadrine \u2013 0.10ug\/ml;\n(g) Oxazepam \u2013 0.13ug\/ml;\n(h) (Pseudo)ephedrine \u2013 2.3ug\/ml;\n(i) Temazepam \u2013 0.10ug\/ml;\n(j) Triprolidine \u2013 0.05ug\/ml; and\nVersion No 3: 29 Jul 2022 (08:40 hrs)\nSa\u2019adiah bte Jamari v PP[2022] SGHC 88\n5(k) Zolpidem \u2013 0.96ug\/ml.\n11 BB1 responded well to treatment and was subsequently discharged on \n13 December 2016. She was found to be well at a review on 17 December 2016. \n12 As for BB2, sometime in December 2016, her mother (\u201cM2\u201d) posted in \na Facebook group called \u201cMummy\u2019s Group\u201d that she needed someone to look \nafter BB2 on the night of 25 December 2016. The Appellant responded to this \nmessage, and it was agreed that M2 would send BB2 to the Appellant\u2019s home \nfor babysitting. M2 subsequently sent BB2 to the Appellant\u2019s home on the said \nnight. Other than the Appellant and her daughters, Dr Peter Looi (\u201cDr Looi\u201d) \nwas also present in her home. However, he was not involved in BB2\u2019s care. As \nwith the charge involving BB1, it was agreed that the Appellant\u2019s daughters did \nnot administer any poisons or any stupefying, intoxicating or unwholesome \ndrugs to BB2.\n13 On 26 December 2016, sometime between 6.30am and 7.30am, BB2\u2019s \nfather (\u201cF2\u201d) picked BB2 up from the Appellant\u2019s home. M2 sent BB2 to KKH \nat around 5pm on the same day. BB2 was observed to be drowsy with ptosis \n(droopy eyelids), truncal ataxia (inability to sit upright and\/or stand without \nsupport) and had difficulty walking, and was admitted. \n14 A urine sample taken from BB2 on 28 December 2016 was sent to the \nHSA for analysis the following day. The following substances were detected in \nthe urine sample: hydroxyalprazolam, alprazolam, chlorpheniramine, diazepam, \nephedrine, nordiazepam, oxazepam and temazepam.

The Victims\u2019 mothers had consistently \ntestified that their babies were normal when they were brought over to the \nAppellant\u2019s home, but unusually drowsy when picked up, and their testimony \nwas corroborated by their messages to the Appellant as well as the fact that they \nbrought the Victims to the hospital to be examined. The poisons were also found \nin the Victims\u2019 blood samples shortly after they had left the care of the \n3 Record of Proceedings (\u201cROP\u201d), p 8. \n4 ROP, p 9.\n5 Prosecution\u2019s Closing Submissions, para 4 (ROP, p 1163). \nVersion No 3: 29 Jul 2022 (08:40 hrs)\nSa\u2019adiah bte Jamari v PP[2022] SGHC 88\n8Appellant. The Appellant did not moreover have a satisfactory explanation for \nthe milk bottle with traces of zolpidem which was found in her home. It was \nargued that the Appellant, being an enrolled nurse and being fully aware of the \ndangers of administering non-prescribed medication to babies, clearly intended \nto cause hurt to the Victims by so administering the poisons to them. \n21 With regard to sentence, the Prosecution highlighted the vulnerability of \nthe Victims, and the testimony of Dr Juliet Tan (\u201cDr Tan\u201d) and Dr Koh Ai Ling \n(\u201cDr Koh\u201d), Registrars at the Department of Paediatrics in KKH who had \nprepared medical reports for BB2, that it would be unsafe to administer the \ndrugs that were found in the Victims without close monitoring.6 The \nProsecution sought a sentence of at least seven years\u2019 imprisonment, bearing in \nmind that the sentencing norm for such cases was in the range of three to four \nyears\u2019 imprisonment and on an application of the totality principle.7 \nFurthermore, where victims of similar vulnerability were involved, three years\u2019 \nimprisonment had been imposed for mere attempts to commit the offence.  \n22 The Appellant denied administering the drugs to the Victims.8 She \nargued that the forensic investigations were insufficient to show that only she \ncould have administered the drugs to the babies.9 The Report showed at best that \nshe had access to those drugs that were found in her body in September 2016. \nOn the other hand, many of the poisons were widely available over the counter, \n6 Prosecution\u2019s Skeletal Sentencing Submissions, paras 4 to 5, 7 (ROP, pp 1330 to \n1331).  \n7 Prosecution\u2019s Skeletal Sentencing Submissions, paras 10 to 12 (ROP, pp 1331 to \n1332). \n8 Defence\u2019s Final Submissions, para 10 (ROP, p 1384). \n9 Defence\u2019s Final Submissions, para 25 (ROP, p 1387). \nVersion No 3: 29 Jul 2022 (08:40 hrs)\nSa\u2019adiah bte Jamari v PP[2022] SGHC 88\n9and a majority of them were not found inside her home. Furthermore, the police \nhad been single-minded in investigating the Appellant to the exclusion of other \nsuspects.10 They only belatedly conducted an incomplete screening of the \nmedical records of the Victim\u2019s family members, and did not conduct a search \nof their homes.11 In this regard, it was possible that BB1 had been administered \nthe drugs by BB1\u2019s paternal grandmother, who was a senior assistant nurse at \nTan Tock Seng Hospital (\u201cTTSH\u201d) and disapproved of BB1\u2019s babysitting \narrangement with the Appellant.12 It was also possible that BB2 had been \nadministered the drugs by either or both of BB2\u2019s parents. They had sent BB2 \nto the hospital only in the evening despite collecting her in the morning.13\n23 The Appellant argued that a global sentence of not more than two years\u2019 \nimprisonment was appropriate. Among other things, her contribution to society \nas a nurse was a mitigating factor and the poisons had no lasting side-effects on \nthe Victims.14 She had also been suffering from various mental conditions \nincluding major depressive disorder, such that she was not an appropriate \nexample to deter others from committing similar offences.15 Several of the cases \nhighlighted by the Prosecution involved domestic workers poisoning their \nemployers or employers\u2019 families as revenge, but there was no such \nconsideration in the present case, and those cases involved substances such as \n10 Defence\u2019s Final Submissions, para 30 (ROP, p 1392). \n11 Defence\u2019s Final Submissions, paras 31 to 35 (ROP, pp 1392 to 1394). \n12 Defence\u2019s Final Submissions, para 48 (ROP, p 1400).  \n13 Defence\u2019s Final Submissions, paras 74 to 76 (ROP, pp 1410 to 1411). \n14 Defence\u2019s Mitigation and Sentencing Submissions, paras 4 and 9 (ROP, pp 1456 \u2013 \n1457). \n15 Defence\u2019s Mitigation and Sentencing Submissions, paras 11 to 12 (ROP, pp 1460 to \n1462). \nVersion No 3: 29 Jul 2022 (08:40 hrs)\nSa\u2019adiah bte Jamari v PP[2022] SGHC 88\n10liquid soap and insecticide that were not meant for consumption under any \ncircumstances.16\nDecision below \n24 The Judge found that the strength of the circumstantial evidence was \nsuch that an irresistible inference could be drawn that the Appellant had \nadministered the drugs to the Victims. \n25 He observed that the drugs that were found in the blood of BB1 were \nconnected to the Appellant primarily due to the timing of the symptoms and the \nfact that all the drugs found in the blood of BB1 could be traced to identical \ndrugs that the Appellant had taken or been prescribed as medication.17 \nFurthermore, he was satisfied from the circumstances that no one other than the \nAppellant had administered the drugs found in BB1. He found that there was no \nevidential basis for the suggestion by the Defence that BB1 could have been \npoisoned by BB1\u2019s paternal grandmother, whom he found an honest witness.18 \nThere was also no suggestion by the Defence that M1 had poisoned BB1 and no \nevidence to indicate as much, and her actions was consistent with the behaviour \nof a concerned mother who sought medical attention for her daughter when \nsomething was wrong with her. The symptoms observed of BB1 being under \nthe influence of medication or drugs which were found in her blood were right \nafter BB1 was picked up from the Appellant\u2019s home. It was also \u201cmost \ncompelling\u201d that all ten drugs found in the blood of BB1 coincided with the \ndifferent drugs that the Appellant had consumed before and had access to. \n16 Defence\u2019s Mitigation and Sentencing Submissions, para 26 (ROP, p 1469). \n17 GD, [37].\n18 GD, [38].\nVersion No 3: 29 Jul 2022 (08:40 hrs)\nSa\u2019adiah bte Jamari v PP[2022] SGHC 88\n1126 As for BB2, her change in behaviour before and after the babysitting \nsession with the Appellant could only be explained by the drugs found in her \nurine and blood samples.19 Since parties had agreed that Dr Looi and the \nAppellant\u2019s two daughters did not administer the drugs to BB2, only the \nAppellant could have done so while BB2 was at her home. The Judge found no \nbasis for the suggestion that either or both of BB2\u2019s parents could have poisoned \nBB2. The Appellant also had recent access to those specific drugs that were \nfound in BB2\u2019s samples as well as the opportunity to administer them to her.\n27 He additionally found the Appellant an unreliable witness who had \nsought at every turn to distance herself from the poisons found in the bodies of \nthe Victims; yet, these attempts were futile in light of her medical records.20\n28 On sentencing, the Judge considered, inter alia, the young age of the \nVictims, the nature of the drugs, which put their lives at risk, and the high level \nof trust reposed in the Appellant by the Victims\u2019 mothers. Deterrence and \nretribution were therefore relevant sentencing principles.21 He agreed with the \nProsecution\u2019s submissions that the applicable sentences were in the range of \nthree to four years\u2019 imprisonment per charge, based on the sentencing \nprecedents tendered. He found that the sentence for each offence should be three \nand a half years\u2019 imprisonment, with the totality principle not being highly \nrelevant as the total sentence was not crushing or disproportionate to the \nAppellant\u2019s criminality.22\n19 GD, [42].\n20 GD, [48].\n21 GD, [56]. \n22 GD, [59] and [61]. \nVersion No 3: 29 Jul 2022 (08:40 hrs)\nSa\u2019adiah bte Jamari v PP[2022] SGHC 88\n12The arguments on"}

Both CS and DB are well-known multinational financial institutions. The basis of the receivership application, which remains to be determined, is that the monies and securities in the Bank Accounts are beneficially owned by Mdm Zhang. 6', '11\\u2003Many years prior to this originating summons, LDV had obtained a freezing order in Singapore on 2 March 2015 in support of its then intended claim against Mdm Zhang in arbitration. The freezing order was directed only against Mdm Zhang. Nonetheless, when it was served on CS and DB, they froze the Bank Accounts apparently because they considered Mdm Zhang to be the beneficial owner of them. LDV then sought pre-action discovery against CS and DB seeking, among other things, the account opening forms and other related documents for the Bank Accounts. Discovery was ordered by the assistant registrar (see La Dolce Vita Fine Dining Co Ltd and another v Deutsch Bank AG and another and another matter [2016] SGHCR 3) and this was upheld on appeal by Andrew Ang SJ in Success Elegant Trading Ltd v La Dolce Vita Fine Dining Co Ltd and others and another appeal [2016] 4 SLR 1392 (\u201cSETL No 1\u201d). CS and DB duly provided account opening forms and other related documents identifying Mdm Zhang as beneficial owner and sole authorised signatory of the Bank Accounts.

In or around August 2020, Kelington had \nbegun searching for a replacement Country Manager for KESH and, for this \npurpose, communicated with Mr Gan.13 In or around October 2020, Mr Gan \nagreed to be employed by Kelington as the Country Manager (China) for KESH.\n10 At the end of September 2020, Mr Gan communicated to Mr Lim that \nhe would be resigning from his existing employment.14 He was, however, \ncontractually obliged to serve three months\u2019 notice.15 This meant that unless his \nemployer agreed to an early release, he could only commence employment with \nKelington Singapore in January 2021, or he would breach his existing \nemployment contract. Indeed, for him to have two employers at the same time \nwould also be a breach of his contract with Kelington.16\n11 Mr Gan\u2019s LOA from Kelington,17 however, stated that his appointment \nas Country Manager (China) for KESH \u201cshall commence on 1st December \n2020\u201d.

It contends that the terms of Mr Gan\u2019s contract of employment \nwere reduced to the form of a document (the LOA), and accordingly no extrinsic \nevidence can be admitted to contradict, vary, add to, or subtract from the terms \nin the LOA. Specifically, Kelington contends that since the commencement date \n18 PCS, paras 40\u201345; Mr Lim\u2019s AEIC, paras 41\u201343. \n19 Mr Gan\u2019s AEIC, paras 5, 8, 11, 13 and 14 (BAEIC at pages 330\u2013333); NE, 26 January \n2022, page 70, lines 23\u201332 and page 62, lines 12\u201331. \nVersion No 1: 26 Apr 2022 (11:46 hrs)\nKelington Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Gan Cheng Chuan[2022] SGHC 90\n7stated in the LOA (at clause 1.3) is 1 December 2020, that cannot be \ncontradicted (or even qualified) by any evidence outside of the LOA.20\n15 However, the parol evidence rule only applies when it is proved that the \ndocument was intended by the parties to contain all the terms of the contract. \nThe court must therefore first determine whether in fact the LOA was intended \nto contain all the terms of the parties\u2019 agreement. In doing so, the court may \nlook at extrinsic evidence and apply the normal objective test, subject to a \nrebuttable presumption that a contract which is complete on its face was \nintended to contain all the terms of the parties\u2019 agreement: Zurich Insurance \n(Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior Design & Construction Pte Ltd \n[2008] 3 SLR(R) 1029 at [40] and [110]; The Law of Contract in Singapore \n(Andrew Phang Boon Leong gen ed) (Academy Publishing, 2012) (\u201cThe Law \nof Contract in Singapore\u201d) at paras 06.027\u201306.028. Having done so, the court \nmay well conclude that the LOA was not intended by the parties to contain all \nthe terms of their contract \u2013 the contract might instead be partly written and \npartly oral. If so, the court can consider extrinsic evidence to establish what the \nterms of the contract are, even, as a logical extension, where the oral evidence \ncontradicts the written document: The Law of Contract in Singapore at \npara 06.040.\n16 There are thus two questions to be dealt with: the anterior question of \nwhether the LOA was intended by Kelington and Mr Gan to contain all the \nterms of their agreement; and, if it was not so intended, the subsequent question \nof what the terms of the agreement between the parties were (having regard to \n20 PCS, paras 39\u201345.\nVersion No 1: 26 Apr 2022 (11:46 hrs)\nKelington Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Gan Cheng Chuan[2022] SGHC 90\n8extrinsic evidence). However, as the facts pertaining to both questions overlap \nsubstantially, I will deal with them in the round. \nThe nature of the LOA\n17 The LOA appeared to be complete on its face. In particular, clause 1.3 \nstated the commencement date of Mr Gan\u2019s employment with Kelington as \n1 December 2020.21 This gave rise to a rebuttable presumption that the LOA \nwas intended to contain all the terms of the parties\u2019 agreement, including the \ncommencement date of 1 December 2020.\n18 However, it remains open to Mr Gan to rebut that presumption by \nshowing that the parties\u2019 agreement\/understanding was that the commencement \ndate would be 1 January 2021, not 1 December 2020. It is also open to Mr Gan \nto show that even if the commencement date were 1 December 2020, it was \nnevertheless tentative, in that it was subject to him being released early from his \nexisting employment by that date.\nThe negotiations between the parties\n19 Mr Gan\u2019s discussions were principally with Kelington\u2019s representative, \nMr Lim. Mr Gan provided his resume to Mr Lim on 11 August 2020,22 and \nMr Lim conducted an interview with him on 13 August 2020.23 Mr Gan\u2019s \nevidence is that during the interview, he told Mr Lim that he would need to serve \nthree months\u2019 notice with his existing employer. \n21 AB1, page 77, clause 1.3. \n22 AB1, page 21. \n23 Mr Lim\u2019s AEIC, para 14 (BAEIC, page 10); Mr Gan\u2019s AEIC, para 5 (BAIEC, page \n330). \nVersion No 1: 26 Apr 2022 (11:46 hrs)\nKelington Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Gan Cheng Chuan[2022] SGHC 90\n920 Following the interview, Mr Lim told Mr Gan that Kelington was keen \nfor him to come on board as KESH\u2019s Country Manager (China),24 and on \n10 September 2020 Mr Gan indicated that he was willing to be appointed to that \nposition by informing Mr Lee via a WhatsApp message that he was \u201con \nboard\u201d.25\n21 On 14 September 2020, Mr Lim sent Mr Gan a WhatsApp message \nasking, \u201c\u2026 Commencement date 1 Dec 2020 ok for you?\u201d Mr Gan replied on \nthe same day, \u201cTentative\u201d.26 Mr Gan\u2019s evidence is that he had indicated that the \ncommencement date was \u201ctentative\u201d because he had yet to tender his resignation \nfrom his existing employment; 27 even if he had done so right away, it was \nalready mid-September 2020, and his three-month notice period would go past \n1 December 2020.\n22 The parties then negotiated other terms of Mr Gan\u2019s prospective \nemployment with Kelington. On 15 September 2020, Mr Lim forwarded a draft \nLOA to Mr Gan.28 Clause 1.3 of the draft stated the commencement date of Mr \nGan\u2019s employment with Kelington as 1 December 2020,29 although there had \nbeen no further discussion on the commencement date after Mr Gan had said it \nwas \u201ctentative\u201d.\n24 Mr Lim\u2019s AEIC, para 16 (BAEIC, page 11). \n25 AB1, page 92. \n26 AB1, page 92. \n27 Mr Gan\u2019s AEIC, para 5 (BAEIC, page 330); NE, 26 January 2022, page 70, lines 23\u2013\n32 and page 76, lines 1\u20139.\n28 AB1, page 31. \n29 AB1, page 32A, clause 1.3. \nVersion No 1: 26 Apr 2022 (11:46 hrs)\nKelington Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Gan Cheng Chuan[2022] SGHC 90\n1023 Clause 1.5 of the draft LOA provided that either party could terminate \nMr Gan\u2019s employment by giving six months\u2019 written notice, or by paying six \nmonths\u2019 basic salary in lieu of notice.30\n24 Mr Gan responded on 21 September 2020, highlighting certain clauses \nin the draft LOA that he was not comfortable with.31\n25 On 23 September 2020, Mr Lim sent Mr Gan a revised draft of the \nLOA.32 Mr Gan asked to negotiate clause 1.5 further: he wanted a guaranteed \nthree-year term, to be compensated with the amount equivalent to his salary for \nthe balance of the three-year term if Kelington should terminate his employment \nbefore the three years were up. Mr Lim proposed that this apply mutually: if \nMr Gan should choose to leave Kelington before three years were up, he would \nhave to pay Kelington the amount equivalent to his salary for the balance of the \nthree years. Mr Gan agreed to this, and so clause 1.5 was drafted as it now \nappears.33\n26 On 29 September 2020, Mr Gan sent Mr Lim a WhatsApp message to \nsay, \u201cSpeaking to my boss today. Will sign off [the LOA]\u201d.34 Mr Gan then \nproceeded to tender his resignation. With his three-month notice period, he thus \ncould not commence employment with Kelington on 1 December 2020 as stated \n30 AB1, page 32A, clause 1.5. \n31 AB1, pages 33\u201343. \n32 AB1, pages 44 and 55\u201363. \n33 Mr Lim\u2019s AEIC, paras 29\u201331 (BAEIC, pages 16\u201317); NE, 26 January 2022, page 83 \nline 14\u2013page 85 line 3. \n34 AB1, pages 95\u201396.\nVersion No 1: 26 Apr 2022 (11:46 hrs)\nKelington Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Gan Cheng Chuan[2022] SGHC 90\n11in the draft LOA, unless his existing employer agreed to waive his notice and \nrelease him early.\n27 On 1 October 2020 Mr Gan sent Mr Lim a WhatsApp message to say \nthat he would send the LOA back that day. Shortly after, though, he sent further \nmessages to say, \u201cThe boss have not accepted my resignation\u201d and, \u201cI will \ncontinue to speak with him.\u201d35 Thus, at or around the end of September 2020, \nMr Gan had told his boss he was resigning, but his boss had not agreed to an \nearly release.\n28 Although Mr Gan had not highlighted clause 1.3 of the draft LOA as one \nof the clauses that he was not comfortable with whilst he was negotiating the \nterms of the LOA with Mr Lim (see [ 22]\u2013[ 25] above), he had earlier told \nMr Lim that Mr Lim\u2019s suggested commencement date of 1 December 2020 was \n\u201ctentative\u201d. Nevertheless, Mr Lim inserted that date in the draft LOA. I accept \nthat Mr Lim knew that Mr Gan had to serve notice with his existing employer, \nand as such, could only commence employment with Kelington on 1 December \n2020 if his existing employer agreed to an early release. Otherwise, he could \nonly commence employment with Kelington after he had finished serving \nnotice. As his notice period ran till the end of December 2020, that meant that \nhe could only start employment with Kelington on 1 January 2021.\nThe execution of the LOA\n29 At 8.30am on 2 October 2020, Mr Gan sent Mr Lim a signed copy of the \nexecution page of the LOA (a photo sent by WhatsApp).36 Mr Gan thereby \n35 AB1, page 96. \n36 AB1, pages 86 and 96.\nVersion No 1: 26 Apr 2022 (11:46 hrs)\nKelington Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Gan Cheng Chuan[2022] SGHC 90\n12stated: \u201cI \u2026 hereby acknowledge and confirm that I understand and accept the \nappointment offered to me subject to the above mentioned terms and conditions \nof contract. In addition, I consent to the payment of my monthly salary and other \npayments due to me by direct credit through Company\u2019s appointed Bank.\u201d\n30 Mr Gan signed in the space provided for his signature, but he did not \ndate the execution page in the space provided for that.\n31 In response, Mr Lim asked, \u201cThe date?\u201d (Mr Lim\u2019s message of \n2 October 2020, 9.32am).37 I accept Mr Lim\u2019s evidence that his query was a \nreference to the missing date in the space for it on the execution page.38\n32 But that is not how Mr Gan understood Mr Lim\u2019s query \u2013 Mr Gan \nresponded right away: \u201cHave to be 1st Jan\u201d (at 9.32am) and \u201cBut you may send \nme works to analyse\u201d (at 9.33am).

However, Mr Lim \nclaims that if there had been \u201cany errors to the signature date\u201d, he preferred to \nonly correct Mr Gan when he received the executed copy (which he received on \n9 October 2020). On the stand, he maintained that he had wondered why \n37 AB1, pages 86 and 96. \n38 Mr Lim\u2019s AEIC, para 41 (BAEIC, page 21); NE, 25 January 2021, page 37, line 10\u2013\npage 38, line 21. \n39 AB1, page 86. \n40 Mr Lim\u2019s AEIC, para 41 (BAEIC, page 21).\nVersion No 1: 26 Apr 2022 (11:46 hrs)\nKelington Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Gan Cheng Chuan[2022] SGHC 90\n13Mr Gan would want his signature to be dated \u201c1st Jan\u201d, but he did not clarify \nthis with Mr Gan.41\n34 Mr Lim\u2019s explanation is artificial, and I do not accept it \u2013 if Mr Lim \nthought it would be an \u201cerror\u201d for Mr Gan to date the execution page 1 January \n2021 (which is what he says he thought Mr Gan meant to do),42 he would have \nsaid so rather than to wait a week to correct the error, if Mr Gan did proceed to \ndate the execution page \u201c1st Jan\u201d.\n35 Likewise, if the date of \u201c1st Jan\u201d did not make sense to Mr Lim, he \nwould have asked Mr Gan to clarify the matter. This is especially since the LOA, \nwhich Kelington had dated 15 September 2020, also provided that Mr Gan was \nto \u201cknowledge [sic] [his] understanding and acceptance\u201d of the LOA by signing \nand returning a copy \u201cimmediately from the date hereof, failing which \n[Kelington] shall treat the offer as lapsed\u201d [emphasis added].43 It would not be \nconsistent with that for Mr Gan to purport to only accept the LOA on 1 January \n2021.\n36 I find that an objective, reasonable person in Mr Lim\u2019s position would \nhave known that \u201c1st Jan\u201d, as mentioned by Mr Gan in his WhatsApp message \non 2 October 2020, was a reference to the commencement date of his \nemployment with Kelington:\n(a) First, Mr Gan did not simply say \u201c1st Jan\u201d; he said: \u201cHave to be \n1st Jan\u201d [emphasis added]. There is no reason why Mr Gan had to date \n41 NE, 25 January 2022, page 77, line 32\u2013page 78, line 14; page 79, lines 17\u201323.\n42 Mr Lim\u2019s AEIC, para 41.\n43 AB1, pages 77 and 85.\nVersion No 1: 26 Apr 2022 (11:46 hrs)\nKelington Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Gan Cheng Chuan[2022] SGHC 90\n14the execution page \u201c1st Jan\u201d, and indeed, that did not make sense to Mr \nLim. Rather, the date in question had to be 1 January 2021 because of \nMr Gan\u2019s notice period, ie, it was a reference to his commencement date.\n(b)  Second, Mr Gan did not merely say \u201cHave to be 1st Jan\u201d; he \nwent on to say, \u201cBut you may send me works to analyse\u201d. That only \nmakes sense if \u201c1st Jan\u201d were a reference to his commencement date \u2013 \nMr Gan was saying that although he could only commence employment \nwith Kelington on 1 January 2021, Kelington could nevertheless \u201csend \n[him] works to analyse\u201d prior to that date, ie, he could take preparatory \nsteps in advance of his prospective employment with Kelington. If \n\u201c1st Jan\u201d were a reference to the date to be filled in on the execution \npage, Mr Gan\u2019s subsequent statement, \u201cBut you may send me works to \nanalyse\u201d, would not make sense.\n(c) Third, Mr Gan had to serve notice with his existing employer, \nand he had just told Mr Lim that his existing employer had not accepted \nhis resignation. It follows that Mr Gan had not obtained an early release, \nand would have to serve out his notice. That takes one back to Mr Gan\u2019s \nremark to Mr Lim on 14 September 2020 that the commencement date \nof 1 December 2020 initially proposed by Mr Lim was merely \n\u201ctentative\u201d (see [ 21] above). In that context, when Mr Gan said, \u201cHave \nto be 1st Jan\u201d, that was a reference to the commencement date.\n37 The above conclusion is reinforced by Mr Lim\u2019s response (or lack \nthereof) when Mr Gan sent over a complete copy of the LOA on 9 October 2020, \nwith the date 1 October 2020 inserted on the execution page.44 Mr Lim did not \n44 AB1, pages 87, 96 and 77\u201385.\nVersion No 1: 26 Apr 2022 (11:46 hrs)\nKelington Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Gan Cheng Chuan[2022] SGHC 90\n15ask Mr Gan why he had done so, even though Mr Lim claims to have understood \nMr Gan\u2019s message a week earlier (\u201cHave to be 1st Jan\u201d) to mean that Mr Gan \nwanted to date the execution page 1 January 2021. The evidence suggests that \nMr Lim never thought Mr Gan was referring to the date to be inserted on the \nexecution page; rather, Mr Lim knew that \u201c1st Jan\u201d was Mr Gan\u2019s intended \ncommencement date of his employment with Kelington.\n38 One other notable piece of evidence is a message which KESH\u2019s then \nCountry Manager (China), Mr Wan Siew Chuan (\u201cMr Wan\u201d), received from \nMr Steven Ong (\u201cMr Ong\u201d) (Mr Wan\u2019s supervisor and the Chief Operating \nOfficer of Kelington Group Berhad)45 on 6 October 2020:46\nGan CC [Cheng Chuan] has finally confirmed joining yesterday \nbut he can only come to SH [Shanghai] on 1 Jan 2021. Now \nthey are talking to him to ask him to quit earlier if possible. \nHowever, let\u2019s assume that he cannot make it, so your \nhandover target is still KH [Kevin Hu] \u2026 [emphasis added in \nbold italics]\n39 Mr Ong\u2019s message evinces his understanding that Mr Gan could only \ncommence his employment with Kelington on 1 January 2021 because of his \nexisting employment, and that attempts were being made to ask him to \u201cquit \nearlier\u201d (ie, to obtain an early release from his existing employment). However, \nabsent any confirmation that Mr Gan could obtain an early release, Kelington \nGroup Berhad was operating under the assumption that he \u201ccannot make it\u201d (ie, \nthat he would not be able to commence his employment with Kelington earlier \nthan 1 January 2021). On the evidence, as of 6 October 2020, Mr Lim was the \nonly person with whom Mr Gan had discussed his commencement date.

There is, however, nothing in the evidence that \nindicates that if Mr Gan could commence employment on 1 December 2020, he \nwould nevertheless be unable to travel to Shanghai until 1 January 2020. In \nparticular, Mr Lim did not say that Mr Gan\u2019s reference to \u201c1st Jan\u201d in his message \nof 2 October 2021, meant that that was the earliest date Mr Gan could travel to \nShanghai \u2013 Mr Lim said he thought that was just about dating the execution page \nof the LOA.47\n41 Mr Wan says he understood that Mr Gan would only be joining \nKelington in January 2021,48 and not that Mr Gan would be joining Kelington \nearlier (on 1 December 2020) but could only travel to Shanghai on 1 January \n2021.49 Kelington\u2019s suggestion that 1 January 2021 was only Mr Gan\u2019s travel \ndate would mean that Mr Wan was never informed when his successor, Mr Gan, \nwould be joining Kelington as an employee, which is an unlikely scenario. \n47 Mr Lim\u2019s AEIC, para 41 (BAEIC, page 21).\n48 Mr Wan Siew Chuan\u2019s Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief dated 26 November 2021 (\u201cMr \nWan\u2019s AEIC\u201d), para 6 (BAEIC, page 524). \n49 NE, 27 January 2022, page 40 lines 8\u201313, page 55 lines 18\u201320.\nVersion No 1: 26 Apr 2022 (11:46 hrs)\nKelington Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Gan Cheng Chuan[2022] SGHC 90\n17Mr Gan\u2019s communications with Kelington\u2019s human resource department\n42 From 13 October 2020 through 8 December 2020, Mr Gan liaised with \nMs Joan Au (\u201cJoan\u201d) from Kelington\u2019s human resource (\u201cHR\u201d) department.50 \nShe asked him for details of a bank account into which his salary could be \ncredited, and their subsequent messages on 13 October 2020 read as follows \n[with times stamps added]:\nMr Gan: I don\u2019t have a Chinese bank acct [11:27am]\nJoan: I see\u2026 your official join date to KESH will be from 1 Dec \n2020.

[11.32am]\nJoan: \ud83d\ude05 [11.33am]\n43 Mr Gan consistently maintained that his commencement date was \n1 January 2021 \u2013 he even joked with Joan about the possibility of Kelington \npaying him salary for the month of December 2020 for the work he would not \nhave performed. Joan pointed out that the LOA stated the commencement date \nas 1 December 2020, but she said she would reconfirm that with Mr Lim. She \nnever got back to Mr Gan on this, however, even though they continued to \ncorrespond on various other HR matters from 19 October 2020 until \n50 AB1, pages 107\u2013110.\nVersion No 1: 26 Apr 2022 (11:46 hrs)\nKelington Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Gan Cheng Chuan[2022] SGHC 90\n1812 November 2020. There was then a break before the next (and last) message \nfrom Joan, which was on 8 December 2020.\n44 I note the following:\n(a) There was no communication from Kelington\u2019s HR department \n(or, apparently, anyone else in Kelington) to Mr Gan on 1 December \n2020 \u2013 when, according to Kelington, Mr Gan had become an employee. \nNor was there any announcement within Kelington (or the Kelington \ngroup of companies) that Mr Gan had joined Kelington that day.\n(b) Although Joan had asked Mr Gan to provide his bank account \ndetails for salary crediting purposes \u201cafter [he had] joined\u201d (at 11.32am), \nMr Gan never provided his bank account details, and Joan did not follow \nup on this even after 1 December 2020 came and went. Kelington did \nnot pay Mr Gan salary in December \u2013 instead, Kelington purported to \noffset an amount representing salary for 1\u201322 December 2020, against \nits damages claim.51\n45 Mr Gan\u2019s communications with Joan are consistent with his \ncommencement date being 1 January 2021, rather than 1 December 2020.\nPreparatory steps\n46 From 22 October 2020, Kelington provided Mr Gan with information, \nand involved him in discussions. I regard these in the nature of preparatory steps \nin advance of Mr Gan commencing employment with Kelington. I accept that \nby 22 October 2020, Mr Gan had committed to joining Kelington, which \n51 SOC, para 10b (SDB, page 5). \nVersion No 1: 26 Apr 2022 (11:46 hrs)\nKelington Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Gan Cheng Chuan[2022] SGHC 90\n19explains his involvement in such matters from then. But that does not point \ntowards 1 December 2020 being his commencement date rather than 1 January \n2021.\n47 Mr Wan was the Country Manager (China) of KESH until the end of \nDecember 2020, and his evidence was that \u201call managerial and\/or executive \ndecisions [were] well within [his] power and authority\u201d during that period as he \nwas \u201cstill the person in charge and\/or the Country Manager [(China)] until \nDecember 2020\u201d.52 Mr Gan made no such decisions as the Country Manager \n(China) of KESH, because Mr Gan never became the Country Manager (China) \nof KESH, whether from 1 December 2020, or ever. On a related note, Mr Wan \nsaid that he understood Mr Gan\u2019s participation in discussions (from October \ninto December 2020) to be as an observer only.53\n48 A transition plan was circulated by Mr Wan on 4 November 2020.54 \nItem 3 on the action list is \u201cAnnouncement\u201d, both external to customers, \nsuppliers, and contractors, and internal to the Kelington group of companies. \nThe stated date for Item 3 was 1 December 2020, but in the event, no \nannouncement was made on that date. Instead, an announcement was made on \n8 December 2020 which I discuss later (at [ 59]\u2013[ 60]).\n49 Item 4 on the action list is \u201cChange of constitution and legal rep\u201d, for \nwhich the stated date was 17 December 2020, and for which the following \nelaboration was provided: \u201cLegal Rep - George Gan\u201d. However, no evidence \n52 Mr Wan\u2019s AEIC, para 8 (BAEIC, pages 524\u2013545).\n53 Mr Wan\u2019s AEIC, para 8 (BAEIC, page 524), NE 27 January 2022, page 55 lines 2\u201310.\n54 AB1 at pages 124 and 316.\nVersion No 1: 26 Apr 2022 (11:46 hrs)\nKelington Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Gan Cheng Chuan[2022] SGHC 90\n20was led to show that Mr Gan was appointed as a legal representative for KESH, \nor any other company in the Kelington group, by that date.\n50 Nothing in the transition plan states that Mr Gan would become a \nKelington employee on 1 December 2020. What was stated under the \u201cNote\u201d \nsection was: \u201cGeorge Gan go Shanghai at 1 Jan 2021 and be able to work from \nmid of Jan 2021.\u201d\n51 The transition plan \u2013 and what was done (or not done) pursuant to it \u2013 \ndoes not support Kelington\u2019s contention that the commencement date of \nMr Gan\u2019s employment was 1 December 2020.\nFurther discussions between Mr Lim and Mr Gan about shortening the \nnotice period with his existing employer \n52 Between 19 and 21 October 2020, Mr Lim and Mr Gan discussed the \npossibility of Mr Gan shortening his notice period with his existing employer. \nThe messages they exchanged are as follows [with date and time stamps \nadded]:55\nMr Lim: Good Morning George, is it possible for you to come \nearlier? [19 October 2020, 10.55am]\nMr Gan: Hi Seng Chuan. My release date is end Dec as of now. \nSeems difficult to come earlier [19 October 2020, 11.11am]\nMr Lim: Due to work requirement?

Mr Gan\u2019s response to whether he could \u201ccome earlier\u201d was that his \nrelease date was \u201cend Dec\u201d, and it seemed difficult to come earlier than that. In \nresponse, Mr Lim did not clarify that he was asking about Mr Gan commencing \nhis employment with Kelington even earlier than 1 December 2020, rather than \nearlier than January 2021 as Mr Gan was referring to (see Mr Gan\u2019s messages \nof 19 October 2020, 11.11am and 21 October 2020, 9.34am). Instead, Mr Lim \nsimply said it would be better for Mr Gan \u201cto go [to China] earlier by early Dec\u201d \n(his message of 19 October 2020, 11.15am).\n54 The evidence does not bear out that Mr Gan could only go to China by \nearly December 2020 if he commenced his employment with Kelington earlier \n56 Mr Lim\u2019s AEIC, para 47 (BAEIC, page 24), NE, 25 January 2022, page 39, lines 27\u2013\n31 and page 81, lines 1\u201318.\nVersion No 1: 26 Apr 2022 (11:46 hrs)\nKelington Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Gan Cheng Chuan[2022] SGHC 90\n22than 1 December 2020. I find that the discussions about whether he could \u201ccome \nearlier\u201d were about him joining Kelington earlier than 1 January 2021, which \nwas what his commencement date would otherwise be.\n55 Conspicuously, Mr Lim never told Mr Gan in the course of those \nmessages that he considered Mr Gan to have contracted unconditionally to \ncommence employment with Kelington on 1 December 2020. If Mr Lim truly \nbelieved that Mr Gan had contractually agreed to commence employment with \nKelington on 1 December 2020, it would only have been natural for him to \nmention this, upon seeing Mr Gan\u2019s messages that he could not \u201ccome earlier\u201d \nthan January 2021. Mr Lim says he did not wish to raise that as an issue as that \nmight create tension with Mr Gan right from the start.57 I consider that a lame \nexcuse.\n56 Mr Lim went so far as to tell Mr Gan that Kelington could pay off \nMr Gan\u2019s notice period to secure an early release,58 which is inconsistent with \nKelington\u2019s position that it was Mr Gan\u2019s obligation to join Kelington on \n1 December 2020 come what may.\nEvents in December 2020\n57 Kelington\u2019s case is that Mr Gan became an employee on 1 December \n2020. But on that date, Mr Gan did not report anywhere, or to anyone, for his \nfirst day of work. It does not appear that anyone even contacted him that day. \nThere was no announcement to his colleagues, to the Kelington group of \n57 Mr Lim\u2019s AEIC, para 48 (BAEIC, page 24). \n58 AB1, page 97. \nVersion No 1: 26 Apr 2022 (11:46 hrs)\nKelington Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Gan Cheng Chuan[2022] SGHC 90\n23companies, or to customers, suppliers and contractors, that Mr Gan had joined \nKelington as of 1 December 2020.\n58 Clause 1.1 of the LOA states that Kelington appoints Mr Gan and \nMr Gan agrees to serve as Country Manager (China) for KESH; clause 1.3 states \nthat the appointment shall commence on 1 December 2020.59 In fact, however, \nMr Gan was not appointed Country Manager (China) for KESH on 1 December \n2020, or ever \u2013 Mr Wan continued to be Country Manager (China) till the end \nof December 2020 (see above at [ 47]). If, as Kelington contends, clause 1.3 \nreflected the agreement\/understanding between the parties on the \ncommencement date, then Kelington acted contrary to it by not appointing \nMr Gan as Country Manager (China) for KESH with effect from 1 December \n2020. The true position is: Mr Gan\u2019s commencement date was 1 January 2021, \nand that is why Kelington did not appoint him Country Manager (China) for \nKESH with effect from 1 December 2020.\n59  On 6 December 2021, Mr Lim sent Mr Gan a draft announcement which \ncontained the following sentence: \u201cWe are very pleased to announce the hiring \nof Mr. Gan Cheng Chuan (George) as Country Manager for KE Shanghai, \nChina, effective 1st Jan 2021.\u201d60 That sentence was retained in the finalised \nannouncement (save that the date was reflected as \u201c01st Jan 2021\u201d and \u201cMr.\u201d \nwas omitted), which was made as a staff announcement on 8 December 2020 \nby the Chief Executive Officer of Kelington Group Berhad.61 The \nannouncement did not say that Mr Gan had already joined Kelington as of that \n59 AB1, page 77. \n60 AB1, page 98.\n61 AB1, page 478.\nVersion No 1: 26 Apr 2022 (11:46 hrs)\nKelington Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Gan Cheng Chuan[2022] SGHC 90\n24date; instead, it announced \u201cthe hiring\u201d of Mr Gan as Country Manager (China) \nfor KESH \u201ceffective 01st Jan 2021\u201d. This too is consistent with Mr Gan\u2019s \ncommencement date being 1 January 2021, not 1 December 2020.\n60 Mr Gan was forwarded the staff announcement on 8 December 2020 by \nMr Soh Tong Hwa, a non-executive director of Kelington Group Berhad, with \na \u201cthumbs up\u201d emoji: \ud83d\udc4d.62 That bolstered the impression on Mr Gan\u2019s part, that \nthere was consensus on 1 January 2021 being his commencement date.\n61 Mr Gan had, however, begun to waver in his resolve to join Kelington. \nHe told Mr Lim on 7 December 2020 at 9.10am that his existing employer had \ncalled and made a \u201ccounter offer for [him] to stay\u201d.63 Again, Mr Gan\u2019s language \nis consistent with his position: he had yet to leave his existing employer or join \nKelington \u2013 so it was about him staying with his existing employer. In response, \nMr Lim did not protest that Mr Gan was already a Kelington employee as of \n1 December 2020. Instead, Mr Lim simply said \u201cStay firm with us\u201d \n(7 December 2020, 9.24am), and \u201cAnnouncement is already made by Raymond \nGan. Let\u2019s move together and make life better.\u201d (7 December 2020, 9.33am). \n62 Mr Lim\u2019s subsequent message of 10 December 2020, 5.31pm is even \nmore telling: \u201cIf not because of this opportunity to join [Kelington], and [you \nhave] committed to join us, would he make counter offer?\u201d64 Again, Mr Lim did \nnot say that Mr Gan was already a Kelington employee as of 1 December 2020. \nInstead, he spoke of \u201cthis opportunity to join [Kelington]\u201d, which Mr Gan had \n62 AB1, page 157.\n63 AB1, page 99.\n64 AB1, page 99. \nVersion No 1: 26 Apr 2022 (11:46 hrs)\nKelington Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Gan Cheng Chuan[2022] SGHC 90\n25committed to. That too is consistent with Mr Gan\u2019s position that he had yet to \ncommence his employment with Kelington, but had merely committed to doing \nso. \n63 On 19 December 2020, Mr Gan messaged Mr Lim to say, \u201c\u2026 I have \ndecided to stay with the existing company. Sorry for all the troubles caused\u201d.65 \nMr Lim\u2019s reply was simply, \u201cSad to hear that.\u201d He did not contradict Mr Gan\u2019s \nassertion that he would be staying with his existing company; he did not say that \nMr Gan was already a Kelington employee.\n64 On 22 December 2020, Kelington sent Mr Gan a letter of demand,66 in \nwhich it purported to characterise Mr Gan\u2019s communication to Mr Lim on \n19 December 2020 as \u201cnotice that [Mr Gan] will not be continuing with [his] \nemployment with [Kelington]\u201d, which Kelington accepted. The letter further \npurported to end Mr Gan\u2019s employment on 22 December 2020. This was an \nattempt to rewrite history.\n65 Mr Gan\u2019s pithy response on 26 December 2020 was that it was \nclause 9.4 of the LOA that applied, for he had terminated the contract before the \ncommencement of his employment.67\nConclusion on the Main Issue\n66 For the above reasons, I find that Mr Gan has rebutted the presumption \nthat the LOA was intended to contain all the terms of the parties\u2019 agreement. \n65 AB1, page 99.\n66 AB1, pages 480\u2013481.\n67 AB 482.\nVersion No 1: 26 Apr 2022 (11:46 hrs)\nKelington Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Gan Cheng Chuan[2022] SGHC 90\n26Specifically, the commencement date of Mr Gan\u2019s employment term was the \nsubject of an agreement\/understanding between Mr Lim and Mr Gan, outside \nthe LOA. The terms of the contract were not reduced to the form of a document \n(the LOA). As such, the parol evidence rule does not apply to prevent Mr Gan \nfrom relying on extrinsic evidence to prove the parties' \nagreement\/understanding as to the commencement date. \n67 I find that the agreement\/understanding between the parties was that the \ncommencement date of Mr Gan\u2019s employment with Kelington was 1 January \n2021, not 1 December 2020. When Mr Gan repudiated the contract on \n19 December 2020, and Kelington treated the contract as terminated on \n22 December 2020, Mr Gan was not an employee of Kelington. Accordingly, it \nis clause 9.4 of the LOA that applies, not clause 1.5. It follows that Mr Gan\u2019s \nliability to Kelington was only in the sum of RM24,000, for which consent \njudgment was entered, and which he has already paid to Kelington.\n68 Further, even if the parol evidence rule applied, s 94(c) of the Evidence \nAct provides that \u201cthe existence of any separate oral agreement constituting a \ncondition precedent to the attaching of any obligation under any such contract, \ngrant or disposition of property, may be proved\u201d. Thus, it was always open to \nMr Gan to prove (as he has) that it was a condition precedent to the \ncommencement of his employment with Kelington, that he be freed of his \nexisting employment.\n69 If at all Mr Gan agreed to 1 December 2020 being the commencement \ndate, that was just \u201ctentative\u201d (as he put it) \u2013 it was always subject to him being \nfreed of his existing employment by then. However, his employer had not \nagreed to an early release; and while he was still serving notice, Mr Gan decided \nVersion No 1: 26 Apr 2022 (11:46 hrs)\nKelington Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Gan Cheng Chuan[2022] SGHC 90\n27to stay on with his employer and not join Kelington after all. A conditional \nagreement to 1 December 2020 as the commencement date does not work for \nKelington\u2019s claim under clause 1.5. If Mr Gan did not obtain an early release by \n1 December 2020, he was not obliged to commence his employment with \nKelington on that date. Thereafter, he terminated the contract prior to the \ncommencement of his employment with Kelington, and as such, clause 1.5 does \nnot apply.\nSubsidiary Issue (1): was clause 1.5 of the LOA an unenforceable penalty \nclause?\n70 As stated at [ 67] above, I find that it is clause 9.4 of the LOA, not \nclause 1.5, that applies. I go on to consider whether, if clause 1.5 had applied, \nKelington\u2019s claims would nevertheless have failed on account of clause 1.5 \nbeing an unenforceable penalty clause.\n71 In determining whether clause 1.5 of the LOA is an unenforceable \npenalty clause, the focus is whether it provides a genuine pre-estimate of the \nlikely loss at the time of contracting: Denka Advantech Pte Ltd and another v \nSeraya Energy Pte Ltd and another and other"}

He relies on the testimony of \nJoanne, who was. Her evidence is that during the dinner, Hendra produced the \nPOA and passed it to the defendant. The defendant passed it to Joanne and said \nthat the plaintiff was a creditor of KSP Indosurya with a \u201cbig amount\u201d. The \ndefendant also requested that Joanne hand the POA to the plaintiff to sign, and \nfor the plaintiff to \u201cbantu bantu KSP\u201d which means \u201chelp help KSP\u201d in \nEnglish.24\n23 Joanne took the POA and showed the defendant and Hendra the 5 May \nLetter. She said she would get her father to sign the POA but the defendant must \nalso \u201csettle the 150\u201d (referring to the Loan Amount, which is in the ballpark of \nIDR150bn).25 She then asked the plaintiff to sign the 5 May Letter.26\n24 Joanne\u2019s evidence is that she queried the defendant about the Deletion and \nasked what would happen if the 9 Properties were not enough to satisfy the Loan \nAmount.

He also told Joanne that the Goodwill Offer \nwas made only in view of their friendship, as he had no personal obligations to \nsettle the plaintiff\u2019s claim, which was against KSP Indosurya.29\n27 The defendant wanted to make clear that his agreement to transfer the \nassets was not a contract of any sort, but a goodwill offer. Hence, he inserted \nthe term \u201cMOU\u201d into the 5 May Letter.30 The defendant made the Deletion to \nreiterate that his Goodwill Offer would only extend to the 9 Properties, and that \nthey would be transferred along with their existing loans.31 In his WA \n27 Joanne\u2019s AEIC at para 31.\n28 Defendant\u2019s AEIC at para 40.\n29 Defendant\u2019s AEIC at para 41.\n30 Defendant\u2019s AEIC at para 43.\n31 Defendant\u2019s AEIC at para 44.\nVersion No 2: 29 Apr 2022 (11:31 hrs)\nUrip Cahyadi v Henry Surya[2022] SGHC 94\n10correspondence with Joanne leading up to the 7 May Dinner, he did not identify \nany properties other than the 9 Properties, as part of the Goodwill Offer.\n28 Thus, he never entered into the Oral Agreement.\nThe Law\n29 In OCBC Capital Investment Asia Ltd v Wong Hua Choon [2012] 4 SLR \n1206, the Court of"}

The presumption \nof knowledge in s 18(2) of the MDA therefore works to mitigate these \ndifficulties (see Tan Kiam Peng at [54]).  Pursuant to s 18(2) of the MDA, which \napplies in this case because it is accepted that the accused has been \u201cprove[n] \n\u2026 to have had a controlled drug in his possession\u201d (see [ 28] above), the accused \nis presumed to have known the nature of that controlled drug found in his \npossession.  As mentioned earlier, the Prosecution relies on this presumption in \nthe alternative to establish that the accused knew that the Bundles contained \nmethamphetamine.  As such, one of the key questions before the court is \nwhether the accused has rebutted that presumption of knowledge as to the nature \nof the contents of the Bundles.  To rebut the presumption of knowledge, the \nburden is on the accused to establish on a balance of probabilities that he did \nnot know the nature of the drugs in his possession (see Gobi a\/l Avedian v Public \nProsecutor [2021] 1 SLR 180 (\u201cGobi\u201d) at [57] and [65]).  \n32 As for the term \u201cwilful blindness\u201d, it is important to bear in mind that it \ncan be used in two distinct senses (see Adili ([ 28] above) at [44]).  The first may \nVersion No 1: 29 Apr 2022 (15:31 hrs)\nPP v Sri Tharean Muthalagan[2022] SGHC 96\n16be described as the \u201cevidential sense\u201d of the term, that is, where the accused \nperson\u2019s suspicion and deliberate refusal to inquire are treated as evidence \nwhich, together with all the other relevant evidence, might sustain a factual \nfinding or inference that the accused person had actual knowledge of the fact in \nquestion (see Adili at [45]).  In other words, when wilful blindness is referred to \nin this sense, it is nothing more than a convenient shorthand for an inference \nthat the accused actually did know the truth (see Adili at [45]\u2012[46]).  However, \nthere is also an \u201cextended conception\u201d of wilful blindness, which describes a \nmental state that falls short of actual knowledge but nevertheless is held to \nsatisfy the mens rea of knowledge because it is the legal equivalent of actual \nknowledge (see Adili at [47]; Gobi at [54]).  It describes the state of mind of an \naccused person who does not in fact know the true position but sufficiently \nsuspects what it is and deliberately refuses to investigate in order to avoid \nconfirmation of his suspicions, and so he is treated as though he did know what \nthe true position was (see Adili at [47] and [48]). \n33 I now turn to consider the Prosecution\u2019s case on knowledge to identify"}

The convertible notes would be converted at a rate of 135.57340905 shares for USD1 of convertible note principal balance.
