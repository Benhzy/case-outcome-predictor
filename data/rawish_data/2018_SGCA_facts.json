{"casename":"2018_SGCA_1","fact":"'3\\u2003The Respondent was the registered proprietor of the Patent entitled \u201cMethod of and Apparatus for Moulding Resin to Seal Electronic Parts\u201d. The Patent\u2019s earliest priority date (based on the original patents in Japan) was 22 July 1993. The filing date in Singapore was 6 July 1994. The date of grant in Singapore was 22 February 1999. 1', 'The Judge stated that the Patent \u201cexpired sometime in 2014, although parties seem to differ on the exact date of expiry\u201d (Judgment at [1]). A search in the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore\u2019s website shows the expiry date of the Patent as 6 July 2014.', '4\\u2003The infringing acts concerned a product known as the \u201cIDEALmold\u201d machine, which the Appellant manufactured, sold, offered for sale and kept in Singapore. Sometime in 1999, the Appellant began manufacturing and selling the IDEALmold machines which were found by the Judge to have infringed the Patent. The Patent concerns moulding technology and moulding machines\/apparatus. As explained by the Judge, the moulding process encapsulates the electronic circuitry with a layer of thermo-setting plastics (also known as \u201cresin\u201d). A moulding apparatus softens resin with heat and then injects the softened resin into a mould under high pressure. The end result is a layer of resin encasing and sealing the electronic circuitry, protecting it from heat and environmental hazards. The word \u201cmould\u201d was spelt as \u201cmold\u201d in various documents tendered at the trial but we shall use only the spelling \u201cmould\u201d unless we are quoting from the documents.', '5\\u2003By way of describing the background art, the Patent describes the components of the then-conventional moulding apparatus: 2', '6\\u2003The Patent also describes the then-conventional moulding sequence: 3', '7\\u2003The Patent summarises the invention claimed therein as a \u201cmethod of and an apparatus for molding resin to seal electronic parts, which can simply cope with production of electronic parts to be sealed with molded resin in small and large quantities\u201d [emphasis added]. 4', 'These, in turn, comprise a moulding apparatus equipped with a single moulding unit, in relation to which any number of additional moulding units can be detachably mounted. This allows the moulding apparatus to be \u201cresponsive to mass production without increasing the mold itself in size\u201d, simply by \u201cadjust[ing] the number of the molding units provided on the molding apparatus in response to the production capacity as required\u201d (see excerpt at [47] below). 5', '8\\u2003Figures 1B and 3 in the Patent depict the side views of the invention claimed:', '9\\u2003Figures 2 and 4 of the Patent are overhead diagrammatic representations of the invention claimed:', '10\\u2003Four claims are in dispute between the parties.

{"casename":"2018_SGCA_10","fact":"'4\\u2003As the subject of this judgment is the application filed by the Prosecution to admit further evidence on appeal, we will limit ourselves to providing a brief sketch of the facts and the proceedings leading to this application. In recounting the facts, we will focus on those aspects of the parties\u2019 cases that concern the new evidence sought to be admitted.', '5\\u2003A total of six charges were brought against the respondent. The second charge against the respondent was for the offence of aggravated outrage of modesty under s 354A(1) read with s 354A(2)(b) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe Penal Code\u201d), allegedly committed against the complainant\u2019s sister. That single charge was stood down at trial and has yet to be decided. The Prosecution proceeded with the five remaining charges at trial and they all concern sexual offences allegedly committed by the respondent against the complainant. They are summarised as follows:', '(a)\\u2003The first charge (\u201cthe First Charge\u201d) was for the offence of aggravated outrage of modesty under s 354A(1) of the Penal Code. In March 2009, sometime at night, the respondent is alleged to have touched and kissed the complainant\u2019s breasts in a prime mover (\u201cthe Prime Mover\u201d) which was parked in a forested area in Punggol. In order to commit the offence, he wrongfully restrained the complainant by confining her in the Prime Mover. The complainant was 15 years old at the time.', '(b)\\u2003The third charge (\u201cthe Third Charge\u201d) was for the offence of sexual assault by digital penetration under s 376(2)(a) of the Penal Code. Sometime in the beginning of June 2010, in the morning, the respondent is alleged to have penetrated the complainant\u2019s vagina with his finger without her consent, in the living room of the flat where the complainant stayed with her mother, sister and brother (\u201cthe Unit\u201d). The complainant was 16 years old then.', '(c)\\u2003The fourth charge (\u201cthe Fourth Charge\u201d) was likewise for the offence of sexual assault by digital penetration. Sometime at the end of June 2010, in the afternoon, the respondent is alleged to have penetrated the complainant\u2019s vagina with his finger without her consent, in the bedroom of the Unit. The complainant was 16 years old at the time.', '(d)\\u2003The fifth charge (\u201cthe Fifth Charge\u201d) was for the offence of rape under s 375(1)(a) of the Penal Code. Sometime in the beginning of January 2010 at about 10pm, the respondent is alleged to have raped the complainant by penetrating her vagina with his penis without her consent in the Prime Mover, which was parked in a forested area in Punggol. The complainant was 15 years old when this occurred.', '(e)\\u2003The sixth charge (\u201cthe Sixth Charge\u201d) was likewise for the offence of rape. Sometime in the early part of 2011, at night, the respondent is alleged to have raped the complainant in the Prime Mover in a forested area in Punggol. The complainant was 16 years old at the time.', '6\\u2003The trial took place over a period of 10 days. The Prosecution called a total of 13 witnesses, including the complainant; the respondent took the stand as the only witness for the defence (\u201cthe Defence\u201d).', '7\\u2003The Prosecution\u2019s case was primarily based on the complainant\u2019s account of events. According to the Prosecution, the respondent came into the complainant\u2019s life sometime in 2004, when he began a relationship with the complainant\u2019s mother. He moved into the Unit soon after this and then lived with the complainant\u2019s mother, sister, brother and the complainant herself. The sexual abuse began in March 2009, when the complainant was just 15 years old. The respondent took her out in the Prime Mover, a vehicle that was owned by Sim Hock Beng Company (\u201cthe Company\u201d), which was the respondent\u2019s employer. According to the complainant, the Prime Mover was red and bore the registration number XB4268Z. The respondent drove to a forested area in Punggol, where he caressed and kissed the complainant\u2019s breasts in the cabin of the Prime Mover. This was the subject of the First Charge. The respondent\u2019s misconduct escalated when he committed digital-vaginal penetration on the complainant on two occasions during the June 2010 school holidays, while they were in the Unit. This formed the subject of the Third and Fourth Charges. He also raped the complainant on two occasions, in the beginning of 2010 and 2011 respectively. The rapes occurred in the cabin of the Prime Mover, which was parked in a forested area in Punggol. These were the subject of the Fifth and Sixth Charges.', '8\\u2003The events came to light only gradually. The complainant first confided in her boyfriend sometime in 2010. The boyfriend pressured the complainant to inform her mother about the incidents and the complainant eventually told her mother about some aspects of the sexual abuse in 2011. The full extent of the respondent\u2019s alleged wrongdoing only came to light towards the end of 2012, after the complainant spoke with her sister on 25 December 2012. Her sister then revealed that she had similarly been subjected to unwanted sexual advances from the respondent. They then decided to inform their brother about the respondent\u2019s conduct. The brother in turn lodged a police report on 27 December 2012.', '9\\u2003The respondent contested all five charges that the Prosecution proceeded with, and denied that he had ever sexually assaulted or raped the complainant. In relation to the charges concerning the offences that allegedly occurred within the Prime Mover (namely, the First, Fifth and Sixth Charges), the respondent claimed that he had never driven the Prime Mover, whether with or without the complainant. The Defence also contended that in any event, the rapes could not have occurred in the cabin of the Prime Mover as alleged, since that area was dirty and contained tools and heavy items. Notably, the Defence relied on the testimony of Mr Sim Hock Beng, the owner of the Company. Mr Sim testified under cross-examination that between 2009 and 2011, one \u201cIdris\u201d had been assigned to drive the Prime Mover \u201c[m]ost of the time\u201d. \u201cIdris\u201d had, however, passed away three or four years prior to the trial. Mr Sim also stated that Idris \u201cwould drive and sleep in the vehicle\u201d, and not go home because \u201che was tired from his work\u201d. He \u201cwould park at \u2026 East Coast Park\u201d and sleep in the vehicle. It is not disputed that this was the first time that the existence of \u201cIdris\u201d was made known to the Prosecution.', '10\\u2003The respondent also contended that the allegations relating to his use of the Prime Mover were implausible, having regard to their frequency and duration. The Prosecution\u2019s case was that the respondent had brought the complainant out for two-hour stretches at night, two or three times a week over a period of one and a half years. As to the Third Charge, the Defence contended that if the respondent had in fact sought to sexually assault the complainant in the manner alleged, while they were in the living room of the Unit, the complainant would surely have run to the safety of the bedroom where her mother was sleeping at that very time. In relation to the Fourth Charge, the Defence sought to cast doubt on the Prosecution\u2019s case that the respondent had contrived a situation to be alone with the complainant by sending her sister out on an errand to buy lunch. The Defence suggested that it was \u201ccurious\u201d that the complainant had failed to accompany her sister so as to avoid remaining in the Unit alone with the respondent.', '11\\u2003The issue of whether, in making its case before the trial judge (\u201cthe Judge\u201d), the Defence had relied on the complainant\u2019s alleged delay in communicating her allegations to her boyfriend and family members as well as her reluctance in reporting the matter to the police, is one of the central matters in issue in the Prosecution\u2019s present application to admit further evidence. We explore this issue further below.', '12\\u2003The Judge acquitted the respondent of all five charges against him: Public Prosecutor v Mohd Ariffan bin Mohd Hassan [2017] SGHC 81 (\u201cthe GD\u201d) at [45]. The Judge found that the complainant\u2019s evidence was not unusually convincing. He also found that the remaining evidence did not significantly strengthen the Prosecution\u2019s case and in fact contained substantial flaws and shortcomings. In the result, he concluded that the Prosecution failed to prove the elements of the charges beyond a reasonable doubt: the GD at [44]. As it is one of the Prosecution\u2019s submissions in the present application that it was unaware that the complainant\u2019s delay in making her allegations would be of any significance in the proceedings until the Judge rendered his decision, it is necessary to have close regard to the reasoning in the GD.', '13\\u2003The Judge began by considering the evidence concerning the offences that were allegedly committed in the Prime Mover. He noted that Mr Sim had given evidence that the respondent was not permitted to drive the Company\u2019s prime movers, that the keys to the prime movers were kept in the Company\u2019s store and \u2013 importantly for present purposes \u2013 that Idris drove the Prime Mover between 2009 and 2011 and would sleep in the vehicle after work instead of going home: the GD at [24]\u2013[25]. He described at [26]\u2013[32] what he perceived to be various inconsistencies between Mr Sim\u2019s evidence and that of the complainant concerning the interior of the Prime Mover, and held at [33] that \u201c[t]he upshot of the [respondent\u2019s] evidence, taken together with Mr Sim\u2019s evidence, was to put in real doubt the [Prosecution\u2019s] case on the identity and use of the [Prime Mover]\u201d.', '14\\u2003Turning to the charges in respect of those offences that allegedly occurred in the Unit, the Judge pointed out a number of \u201cdisquieting aspects\u201d of the complainant\u2019s evidence: the GD at [34]\u2013[35]. In relation to the Third Charge, he noted that \u201c[d]efence counsel [had] pointed out that [the complainant] could have ran [sic] back to the bedroom to the protection of her mother, or to raise alarm and complain to her about him, but inexplicably she did neither and remained silent for half a year before telling her that he touched her body\u201d. Regarding the Fourth Charge, the Judge observed that \u201cno questions were asked and no information volunteered\u201d from the complainant\u2019s sister as to the complainant\u2019s claim that the respondent had instructed the complainant\u2019s sister to leave the Unit to buy lunch, leaving the complainant alone with the respondent in the Unit. According to the Judge, this omission \u201craised questions over the [complainant\u2019s] account [of] the [incident]\u201d. He proceeded to refer to the possibility of drawing an adverse inference against the Prosecution pursuant to Illustration (g) to s 116 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe Evidence Act\u201d), but stopped short of explicitly doing so, finding only that the omission \u201chad a negative impact on the [Prosecution\u2019s] case\u201d.', '15\\u2003In the next section of the GD which was titled \u201cReview\u201d, the Judge first agreed with the Prosecution\u2019s submission that the case rested primarily on the credibility of the complainant and respondent: the GD at [37]. He then quoted extensively from our decision in AOF v Public Prosecutor [2012] 3 SLR 34 (\u201cAOF\u201d), focusing on [111]\u2013[115] of AOF which concern the requirement that a complainant\u2019s evidence be \u201cunusually convincing\u201d in circumstances where there is no corroborative evidence. The Judge also considered Kwan Peng Hong v Public Prosecutor [2000] 2 SLR(R) 824 at [32]\u2013[33], where Yong Pung How CJ emphasised the need for caution in relying solely on the evidence of the complainant to ground a conviction: the GD at [38].', '16\\u2003The Judge then observed that, strictly speaking, the complainant\u2019s evidence \u201cdid not stand alone\u201d, given the evidence of her mother, brother, sister and boyfriend whom she had told about the respondent\u2019s conduct. He then referred to s 159 of the Evidence Act, which provides as follows:', '17\\u2003The Judge noted Yong CJ\u2019s observation in Khoo Kwan Hain v Public Prosecutor [1995] 2 SLR(R) 591 at [49] that although s 159 of the Evidence Act had \u201cthe effect of elevating a recent complaint to corroboration, the court should nevertheless bear in mind the fact that corroboration by virtue of s 159 alone is not corroboration by independent evidence\u201d [emphasis in original]. The Judge found that there were no reasons to account for the complainant\u2019s failure to promptly complain to her boyfriend and family members about the sexual assaults. He also observed that when she eventually broke her silence, her accounts were \u201ccontradictory and inconsistent\u201d despite the fact that she had ample time to recall the forms of abuse that she had suffered: the GD at [40]\u2013[41].', '18\\u2003The Judge found that the complainant\u2019s description of the cabin of the Prime Mover and the respondent\u2019s alleged frequent usage of the Prime Mover was contradicted by Mr Sim\u2019s evidence: the GD at [42]. He again pointed out (in relation to the Fourth Charge) that \u201cnothing was mentioned\u201d by the complainant\u2019s sister of the complainant\u2019s claim that the respondent had sent her out of the Unit so that he could be alone with the complainant. The Judge surmised that \u201c[t]hese, and the other matters I have referred to have a negative impact on [the complainant\u2019s] credibility\u201d: the GD at [43]. He concluded that the complainant\u2019s evidence was \u201cnot usually compelling or convincing and the other evidence did not strengthen the [Prosecution\u2019s] case in any significant way\u201d, and that there were \u201csubstantial flaws and shortcomings in the evidence\u201d that led to his finding of reasonable doubt: the GD at [44]. He then acquitted the respondent of the charges in respect of offences against the complainant.'"}

The appellants were two of the three shareholders in each of the respondent companies, the third being Chesham Properties Pte Ltd (\u201cChesham\u201d).', '5\\u2003The facts underlying this dispute were covered in detail by the High Court Judge (\u201cthe Judge\u201d) who heard the applications in his grounds of decision: see Perennial (Capitol) Pte Ltd and another v Capitol Investment Holdings Pte Ltd and other matters [2017] SGHC 84 (at [3]\u2013[18] (\u201cthe GD\u201d). What follows is an account of the key facts.', '6\\u2003In April 2010, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (\u201cURA\u201d) launched a tender for a lease of a parcel of land located at the junction of North Bridge Road and Stamford Road. This parcel included the land on which the Capitol Theatre stood. While it was run-down and neglected, some of its former glory and fame still clung to the building, and the tender gave developers in Singapore an opportunity to acquire and capitalise on a landmark site.', '7\\u2003One such developer was Mr Kwee Liong Seen (\u201cMr Kwee\u201d). He invited Mr Pua Seck Guan (\u201cMr Pua\u201d) and Mdm Sukmawati Widjaja (\u201cMdm Widjaja\u201d) to join him in collectively bidding for the lease. It was envisioned that the land would be developed into an integrated development project comprising a theatre, a hotel and a retail mall (\u201cthe Capitol Project\u201d) which would include the restoration and refurbishment of the Capitol Theatre and the other conserved buildings adjacent to it. Mr Pua and Mdm Widjaja responded with enthusiasm and the parties decided to incorporate special purpose vehicles to hold their respective interests in the joint venture. To that end, Mr Kwee incorporated Chesham on 14 May 2010, Mdm Widjaja incorporated Top Property Investment Pte Ltd (\u201cTop Property\u201d) on 8 June 2010, and Mr Pua incorporated the first appellant, Perennial, on 16 August 2010, as a wholly owned subsidiary of Perennial Singapore Investment Holdings Ltd, which is in turn a wholly owned subsidiary of Perennial Real Estate Holdings Ltd (\u201cPRE Holdings\u201d). Mr Pua is the Chief Executive Officer and one of the directors of PRE Holdings. Chesham, Top Property and Perennial are, hereafter, collectively referred to as \u201cthe Original Shareholders\u201d.', '8\\u2003On 16 August 2010, the Original Shareholders incorporated nine companies (\u201cthe Nine Companies\u201d), which included the three respondent companies, to hold various components and assets of the Capitol Project. The Original Shareholders each appointed one director to the board of directors of each of the Nine Companies. Perennial appointed Mr Pua while Chesham appointed Mr Kwee.', '9\\u2003The articles of association of each of the respondent companies contains the following clause (\u201cArt 22\u201d):', '10\\u2003On 18 August 2010, two bids were submitted through the Nine Companies to the URA. On 27 October 2010, one of these proposals won the tender. The shares in the respondent companies were subsequently distributed between Perennial, Chesham and Top Property in the respective proportions of 40%, 30% and 30%.', '11\\u2003It should be noted that under Conditions 52 and 57.1 of the URA Conditions of Tender, the URA had the right to re-enter and resume possession of the site and dispose of it as though the tender had never been submitted, without compensation to the lessee, if the lessee were to be placed in liquidation before the issuance of the certificate of statutory completion for the Capitol Project. As of the date of the filing of the applications, no certificate of statutory completion had been issued.', '12\\u2003In March 2012, Top Property decided to leave the Capitol Project. Following a series of negotiations, Chesham purchased two-thirds of Top Property\u2019s shares. The remaining shares were purchased by New Capitol, another wholly owned subsidiary of Perennial Singapore Investment Holdings Pte Ltd. Thus, after Top Property\u2019s departure from the Capitol Project, the appellants collectively held 50% of the shares in each of the respondent companies, while Chesham held the other 50%.', '13\\u2003Shortly after winning the tender, the Original Shareholders met to discuss how they would take the Capitol Project forward. They agreed, inter alia, to execute a joint venture (\u201cJV\u201d) agreement to order their relationships, interests and rights. Numerous drafts of a proposed JV agreement were circulated amongst the Original Shareholders between November 2010 and March 2011, but in the event no agreement was ever signed.', '14\\u2003In the meantime, in December 2010, the Original Shareholders had agreed on the following allocation of responsibilities in relation to the Capitol Project: Perennial would be in charge of developing the retail component, Chesham would be responsible for developing the hotel and theatre components, while Top Property would be responsible for developing the residential component. This allocation of responsibilities reflected the respective expertise of Mr Pua, Mr Kwee and Mdm Widjaja: Mr Pua had experience in retail management. Mr Kwee had experience in developing luxury hotels and Mdm Widjaja had experience in developing and marketing luxury residential projects. The Original Shareholders also agreed on the following:', '(a)\\u2003Perennial (Singapore) Retail Management Pte Ltd (\u201cPSRM\u201d) would be engaged to develop and operate the retail components of the Capitol Project. This engagement was to be effected through management agreements called the Retail Property Management Agreements (\u201cRPM Agreements\u201d). PSRM was to execute RPM Agreements with CRM and CHM. The RPM Agreement between PSRM and CRM would cover the retail units to be located in a building to be newly constructed while the RPM Agreement between PSRM and CHM would cover the retail units to be located within the conservation buildings of the Capitol Project.', '(b)\\u2003Patina Hotels & Resorts Pte Ltd (\u201cPatina\u201d) would be engaged to develop and operate the retail and hotel components of the Capitol Project. This engagement was to be effected through a management agreement called the Hotel Management Agreement (\u201cHM Agreement\u201d). Patina was to execute the HM Agreement and a licence agreement with CHM for the purpose of managing and operating the hotel.', '15\\u2003According to the appellants, there was an understanding that the RPM Agreements would be executed at around the same time as the HM Agreement. Chesham, however, denied that there was any such understanding.', '16\\u2003The HM Agreement had to be signed with some urgency because it was thought desirable to market the residential units as having access to the concierge services and amenities of the hotel. The HM Agreement was executed on 29 April 2013. Subsequently, in September 2013, the appellants provided Chesham with several drafts of the two RPM Agreements. However, despite many discussions, the appellants and Chesham were unable to agree on the terms of the RPM Agreements and neither was signed.', '17\\u2003Discussions regarding the terms of the JV agreement began again in May 2014, after Mr Pua informed Mr Kwee that the appellants intended to transfer their shares in the respondent companies to their parent company, PRE Holdings. Mr Kwee was concerned that this would result in a change in the appellants\u2019 management, and sought to formalise the terms of the shareholders\u2019 relationship in the JV agreement. Chesham sent a draft JV agreement to Mr Pua on 28 May 2014, and negotiations concerning its terms ensued.', '18\\u2003Between July 2014 and August 2014, Chesham and the appellants also began to negotiate the timing of the execution of the JV agreement and the RPM Agreements. Chesham wanted the RPM Agreements to be executed contemporaneously with the JV agreement. The appellants, however, considered that the RPM Agreements were more urgent and, on 29 August 2014, they requested that the RPM Agreements be finalised before discussions on the JV agreement were resumed. The final outcome of these discussions is a matter in dispute. Chesham claimed that the understanding reached was that the RPM Agreements would be finalised before the JV agreement, but the RPM Agreements and the JV agreement would all be signed at the same time. Chesham termed this the \u201cOctober 2014 Agreement\u201d. The appellants, however, denied that there was ever any such agreement for all three documents to be signed at the same time.', '19\\u2003By 13 March 2015, one of the RPM Agreements was ready for execution. The parties continued to negotiate the terms of the other RPM Agreement and the JV agreement but were still unable to agree on the terms of the latter.', '20\\u2003In April 2015, Mr Pua requested that the RPM Agreements be signed. Mr Kwee refused to sign the RPM Agreements until the JV agreement was finalised, citing the October 2014 Agreement. The appellants denied that there was such an agreement and took Chesham\u2019s delay in executing the RPM Agreements as a violation of the alleged prior understanding that the RPM Agreements would be executed at the same time as the HM Agreements (see [15] above). The impasse continued and nothing further was signed.', '21\\u2003This disagreement became a source of great bitterness between the appellants and Chesham, and between Mr Pua and Mr Kwee. Numerous issues stemmed from the impasse. Since the RPM Agreements were never executed, PSRM remained unpaid for the retail leasing services which it provided in respect of the Capitol Project. Mr Pua refused to countersign payments for various expenses incurred by CHM and Patina relating to the opening of the hotel. Chesham claimed that as a result of this refusal, the hotel could not open despite having received its Temporary Occupation Permit on 13 October 2015. The discord between the appellants and Chesham severely stunted the Capitol Project and its economic potential (at [18] of the GD).', '22\\u2003On 13 April 2016, the appellants filed winding-up applications in respect of the three respondent companies under s 254(1)(i) of the Companies Act.

Civil Tech was engaged as the main sub-contractor for two construction projects by the Land Transport Authority, the T211 project for the construction of the Bright Hill MRT station and the C933 project for the construction of the Jalan Besar MRT station. By two separate contracts (\u201cthe T211 Contract\u201d and \u201cthe C933 Contract\u201d), Civil Tech engaged Hua Rong as its sub-contractor to supply labour for each of these projects.', '4\\u2003On 6 December 2016, Hua Rong submitted a payment claim (\u201cthe Payment Claim\u201d) in the sum of $601,873.40 to Civil Tech for work under the T211 Contract.', '5\\u2003On 21 December 2016, Civil Tech issued a payment certificate, which the parties accepted served as a payment response (\u201cthe Payment Response\u201d), certifying a negative sum of $1,571,055.66. In other words, by the Payment Response, Civil Tech claimed that far from being liable to Hua Rong, the latter owed it a substantial sum of money. According to Civil Tech, Hua Rong had made fraudulent payment claims under the C933 Contract, not the T211 Contract, which claims Civil Tech had satisfied and which it contended it was entitled to recover. Civil Tech sought to raise a set-off to the Payment Claim on this basis, and indicated this in the Payment Response.', '6\\u2003Hua Rong subsequently filed an adjudication application in relation to the Payment Claim. In its adjudication response, Civil Tech again claimed that it had satisfied fraudulent payment claims made by Hua Rong under the C933 Contract, and was entitled to withhold payment of the Payment Claim on this basis.', '7\\u2003On 15 February 2017, the adjudicator (\u201cthe Adjudicator\u201d) released his determination (\u201cthe Adjudication Determination\u201d). The Adjudicator held that the Act did not permit the respondent in an adjudication application to set-off claims arising under another contract against monies due to a claimant under the contract to which the adjudication relates. In the absence of any other asserted defence, the Adjudicator therefore determined that Hua Rong was entitled to the claimed sum of $601,873.40, interest and costs.', '8\\u2003In March 2017, Hua Rong applied for and obtained leave to enforce the Adjudication Determination, and judgment in terms of the same.', '9\\u2003On 4 April 2017, Civil Tech applied to court to set aside the Adjudication Determination, and the order of court granting Hua Rong leave to enforce the Adjudication Determination and judgment in terms of the same. In gist, Civil Tech argued that the respondent to a payment claim under the Act is entitled to raise any claim or set-off to withhold payment, as long as the payment response makes mention of that claim or set-off. The Adjudicator had thus erred in refusing to consider the set-off that Civil Tech had raised based on the C933 Contract. This was a jurisdictional error, and the Adjudication Determination should therefore be set aside.'"}

The application, which the Respondent subsequently approved, did not state that any of these renovation works would be in areas that were not within the unit.', '4\\u2003In August 2013, the Respondent discovered in the course of some routine inspections that the Appellant had installed timber decking on two ledges that bordered segments of the Unit\u2019s external facades on the 29th floor (\u201cWork 1\u201d). Each of the two ledges was enclosed by a parapet that was about 0.75m in height and resembled balconies, although it was common ground that they were not in fact balconies. Fixed glass panels originally separated the ledges from the Unit such that they could not be accessed by occupants of the Unit, but the Appellant had replaced those with sliding panels.', '5\\u2003The Respondent then corresponded with Glory, stating that Work 1 was unauthorised and requesting the Appellant to restore the fixed glass panels. Further correspondence ensued and, on 28 August 2013, the Respondent advised the Appellant to submit a formal application to install timber decking on the ledges. The Appellant did so through Glory on 3 September 2013, but the Respondent concluded that Work 1 entailed the exclusive use of common property, which it had no jurisdiction to authorise. It thus advised the Appellant to sponsor a resolution at the next Annual General Meeting (\u201cAGM\u201d) in April 2014 to acquire the right to the exclusive use of the ledges pursuant to s 33(1)(c) of the BMSMA. Such a resolution would have required the support of at least 90% of the aggregate share value of all the valid votes cast at the AGM in order to be carried. However, the Appellant did not initially pursue this course.', '6\\u2003About eight months later, on or around 5 May 2014, the Respondent discovered that the Appellant had covered the entirety of the flat roof on the 30th floor, outside the Unit, with similar timber decking (\u201cWork 2\u201d). The flat roof was accessible to all subsidiary proprietors in the Development through a common staircase.', '7\\u2003A few days later, on or around 12 May 2014, the Respondent discovered that the Appellant had installed an air-conditioning ventilation unit on an external wall enclosing the Unit at the 30th floor, in the same vicinity as Work 2 (\u201cWork 3\u201d). To carry out Work 3, the Appellant would have needed to hack through the wall in question so as to connect the air-conditioning ventilation unit to the interior of the Unit.', '8\\u2003Thereafter, the Respondent wrote to Glory requesting the immediate removal of Works 1, 2 and 3 (collectively, \u201cthe Works\u201d), failing which the Respondent would remove or demolish \u201call unauthorised works\u201d. Further correspondence was subsequently exchanged between the Respondent and Glory, but there was no resolution and the Works remained in place.', '9\\u2003About a year later, at the AGM held on 25 April 2015, the Appellant tabled motions seeking the exclusive use and enjoyment of, and\/or special privileges in respect of, the areas where the Works had been carried out (collectively, \u201cthe Areas\u201d).

It was incorporated in 2008.', '10\\u2003The Companies collectively held assets (including but not limited to cash, shares of other companies and bonds) worth over US$584m in 2012. According to the Companies\u2019 Statement of Claim, while the Companies used to be in the business of, among others, \u201cshipping, marine engineering and supplies\u201d, the Companies\u2019 present activities are confined to \u201cthe holding and management of various investment assets (comprising principally cash, gold and shareholdings)\u201d. Ernest Ferdinand Perez De La Sala (\u201cErnest\u201d), the defendant in S 178, also described the Companies as \u201cholding vehicles with no day-to-day trading or operations except for any minor business that [JMM] may have had\u201d in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief (\u201cAEIC\u201d). It should be noted that CFC owns all the shares in PEN, PEN owns all the shares in PAL, and PAL owns all the shares in CFC. CFC, PEN, and PAL are organised in an \u201corphan\u201d or circular structure, which is legal under Panamanian and BVI law but not under Singapore law. We will refer to CFC, PEN and PAL collectively as \u201cthe Orphan Companies\u201d. The structure that they exist in will be referred to as \u201cthe Orphan Structure\u201d.', '11\\u2003The Judgment sets out the relationships in the De La Sala family in great detail (at [7]\u2013[14]). Since many of these background facts are not disputed and not material for the purposes of the present appeals, we will not repeat them except to introduce the key members of the family who are involved in the present state of affairs:', '(a)\\u2003Robert Perez De La Sala Sr (\u201cRobert Sr\u201d) and Camila Vasquez De La Sala (\u201cCamila\u201d) were the patriarch and matriarch of the De La Sala family before their deaths in 1967 and 2005, respectively. Camila was the sole beneficiary of Robert Sr\u2019s will. Robert Sr was the reason for the family\u2019s tremendous wealth as he was a successful self-made businessman. He rose to become the chairman and majority shareholder of the shipping company John Manners and Company Limited (Hong Kong) (\u201cJMC\u201d), which was to be one of the key assets of the De La Sala family. Robert Sr also incorporated Lasala Investments Limited (\u201cLIL\u201d) in 1939, which was an investment company under his control. LIL was renamed North Enterprises Limited (\u201cNEL\u201d) some time after June 1959. In his later years, Robert Sr was preoccupied with reducing his exposure to estate duty as evidenced by his correspondence with his sons prior to his death. By the time of Robert Sr\u2019s death, he had long divested himself of his shareholdings in JMC and NEL, which held much of his wealth.', '(b)\\u2003Robert Sr and Camila had four children in the following order: Jerome Anthony Perez De La Sala (\u201cTony\u201d), Ernest, Robert Perez De La Sala (\u201cBobby\u201d) and Isabel Brenda Koutsos (\u201cIsabel\u201d). Camila and the four children were known collectively as \u201cJERIC\u201d. We will refer to Camila, Bobby, Isabel and Tony as \u201cJRIC\u201d. Ernest, apparently the most commercially astute of the four children, took over the management of the family\u2019s business interests and assets after the death of Robert Sr, and was the de facto head of the De La Sala family after Camila\u2019s passing. Ernest was the one who was responsible for heavily restructuring the family\u2019s business interests and assets after Robert Sr\u2019s death. As de facto head of the family, he was based outside of Australia, unlike the rest of the family, for tax planning purposes, and disbursed funds to the rest of the family regularly. Ernest was married to Hannelore de Lasala-Debring (\u201cHannelore\u201d), but they were divorced in May 1970. Hannelore gave evidence in S 178 and independently brought fresh proceedings in HCMP 1029\/2013 against Ernest in Hong Kong (\u201cthe Hong Kong proceedings\u201d) on the basis that he had misrepresented to her during the divorce proceedings that a very large part of his assets were family assets held by him on trust. Ernest\u2019s witness statements in the Hong Kong proceedings are the subject of some summonses filed in these appeals (see [71] below).', '(c)\\u2003Edward De La Sala (\u201cEdward\u201d) and Christina De La Sala (\u201cChristina\u201d) are Bobby\u2019s children, and the nephew and niece of Ernest. Christina married James Copinger-Symes (\u201cJames\u201d). They are the defendants in counterclaim in S 178 and will be referred to collectively as \u201cECJ\u201d. ECJ came to Singapore in 2004\u20132005, having allegedly been invited by Ernest to come here to join him in the management of the Companies (and by extension, the De La Sala family\u2019s assets). The nature and effect of Ernest\u2019s representations to ECJ are issues on appeal.', '12\\u2003The directors of the Companies are all members of the De La Sala family. ECJ, Isabel and Ernest are directors of CFC, PEN, PAL, DOM and SMC. ECJ and Ernest are the directors of JMM. Edward and James were also shareholders with 5,000 shares each in SMC, but they purportedly held these shares on trust for PEN pursuant to deeds of trust.', '13\\u2003The corporate structure of the Companies today is a result of the various rounds of restructuring that have occurred since Ernest took over the reins of the family\u2019s business interests after Robert Sr\u2019s death in 1969. As we have noted above at [11], these business interests were concentrated in NEL and JMC at the time of Robert Sr\u2019s death, and Ernest accepted during cross-examination that his main assets as of 1970 were his shares in JMC and NEL. Therefore, the evidence strongly suggests that NEL and JMC are in fact the origins of the Companies\u2019 wealth that lies at the heart of the dispute in S 178.', '14\\u2003There also appears to be a third possible source for the Companies\u2019 assets in dispute \u2013 a pool of assets called the \u201cFive Stars\u201d, evidenced by the February 1984 Memorandum that traces the value of the assets from 1970 to 1983. It is not clear from the record what \u201cFive Stars\u201d relates to and what has happened to these assets. Since none of the parties have attempted an explanation, we shall not dwell on this point.', '15\\u2003 The various parties\u2019 interests in NEL and JMC right after Robert Sr\u2019s death are salient to the dispute in S 178, as Ernest\u2019s claim to the Companies\u2019 assets rests principally on his assertion that he had bought out JRIC\u2019s shares in NEL and JMC after Robert Sr\u2019s death, and that JRIC therefore had no claim to the assets in the Companies. Therefore, we will set out the facts relating to the shareholdings of NEL and JMC.', '16\\u2003It is undisputed that NEL\u2019s shareholders, at the time of Robert Sr\u2019s death, were JERIC in equal shares of 1,200 each (see the Judgment at [113]). On 26 August 1967, except for one share which Ernest retained, all of the 6,000 shares in NEL were transferred to San Roberto Steamship Company SA (\u201cSR\u201d), a nominee company under the control of Ernest. SR was wholly owned by San Miguel Navigation Company SA (\u201cSM\u201d), which was in turn owned by JMC. The reason for JRIC\u2019s transfer of their NEL shares to SR is a matter of dispute \u2013 Ernest claimed that he acquired JRIC\u2019s NEL shares using SR, one of his nominee companies, while the Companies and ECJ denied that such a sale ever occurred.', '17\\u2003In so far as JMC is concerned, it is undisputed that at the time of Robert Sr\u2019s death, Ernest had a 37% stake in JMC, while JRIC held a 45% stake in JMC through their nominee company, Overseas Nominees Ltd. Overseas Nominees Ltd\u2019s 45% stake was subsequently transferred to Compass Enterprises Inc (\u201cCE\u201d) on 1 September 1970. This stake in JMC remained with CE until 2011 at least.', '18\\u2003In December 1969, what the Judge termed as \u201cthe first orphan structure\u201d was created when JMC sold its shares in SM to CE, which was in turn wholly owned by SR. CE, SM and SR were thus held in a triangular structure, with SR owning all of NEL\u2019s shares except for one held by Ernest. We will continue to refer to this as \u201cthe first orphan structure\u201d, in contradistinction to the Orphan Structure which currently exists. The following is a pictorial representation of the first orphan structure:', '19\\u2003The significance of this structure will become clear at [127] below.', '20\\u2003ECJ had, until the breakdown of their relationship with Ernest in August 2011, been working under Ernest\u2019s direction in managing the assets held by the Companies. ECJ claim to have done so on the understanding that the Companies\u2019 assets were part of a De La Sala family trust, while Ernest claims that ECJ were helping him to manage what were ultimately his assets. Ernest and ECJ\u2019s relationship broke down sometime in August 2011, when Ernest instructed ECJ to transfer various US dollar deposits held by PAL, CFC and SMC with UBS (Singapore) and HSBC Singapore to CFC\u2019s account with UBS (Vancouver). Ernest apparently asserted to Edward, for the first time, that the Companies\u2019 assets belonged to Ernest personally. This triggered a series of actions by ECJ to alter Ernest\u2019s role from sole signatory to the Companies\u2019 bank accounts to a joint signatory with Bobby and Isabel, although Ernest\u2019s sole signatory status was reinstated after Bobby and Isabel intervened. Disgruntled with this turn of events, Ernest transferred the assets in the Companies\u2019 bank accounts, worth a total of CAD 663,033,557.61 at the material time, into his personal account with UBS (Canada).'"}
{"casename":"2018_SGCA_17","fact":"'6\\u2003The full facts are set out in the Judge\u2019s decision, published as PT Sandipala Arthaputra v STMicroelectronics Asia Pacific Pte Ltd and others [2017] SGHC 102 (\u201cthe Judgment\u201d) at [10]\u2013[48]. We only briefly canvass the relevant events.', '7\\u2003We start with the parties involved and how their trades interrelate. The first appellant and the plaintiff in the suit below, Sandipala, produces personalised electronic identification cards. The second and third appellants, Mr and Ms Tannos, are father and daughter and are Sandipala\u2019s directors. They are responsible for most, if not all, of the decisions involving Sandipala. The first to third respondents were the defendants in the suit below. The first respondent, STMicroelectronics Asia Pacific Pte Ltd (\u201cST-AP\u201d), sells microchips, which we will refer to simply as \u201cchips\u201d below for convenience. These chips can be used by companies like Sandipala to produce electronic identification cards. The third respondent, Mr Vincent Pierre, Luc, Cousin (\u201cMr Cousin\u201d), is ST-AP\u2019s country manager in Indonesia. The second respondent, Oxel, also supplies and sells chips for use in electronic identification cards. Unlike ST-AP, which produces the hardware, ie, the physical chip, Oxel supplies the software for the chip, ie, its operating system. The chip produced by ST-AP is encoded with Oxel\u2019s software. When the chip is produced and encoded, Sandipala uses the completed chip to produce the physical electronic identification cards.', '8\\u2003The dispute centres on the Supply Contract concluded on 9 November 2011 between Sandipala and Oxel. It is a one-page signed acceptance of Oxel\u2019s quotation and a one-page purchase order reflecting the same terms. 3', 'Sandipala ordered a \u201ccommitted quantity\u201d of 100m chips at a price of US$0.60\/unit (a total price of US$60m), to be delivered in four batches quarterly. These chips were manufactured by ST-AP (namely the ST23YR12 chips, which will be referred to as the \u201cST chip\u201d) and encoded with Oxel\u2019s software known as \u201cPAC\u201d for the chips\u2019 operating system (\u201cthe Oxel chips\u201d). The Oxel chips are thus ST chips encoded with Oxel\u2019s operating system. Sandipala was to make a 20% down payment of the price of the chips to be delivered per quarter. It accordingly paid US$1.2m as down payment for the first batch on 14 November 2011.', '9\\u2003The Oxel chips were purchased by Sandipala for the purpose of fulfilling its obligations under a separate tender contract with the Indonesian government for the production of electronic identification cards called electronic-KTP cards (\u201ce-KTP cards\u201d) for all its citizens (\u201cthe Tender\u201d). The Tender was launched in February 2011 and set out requirements for the chips and its operating systems. 4', 'Sandipala is the only party in the present appeal who directly participated in the Tender. It joined an existing consortium led by Perusahaan Umum (Perum) Percetakan Negara (\u201cPNRI\u201d and \u201cthe Consortium\u201d) to bid for the Tender. 5', 'Among the five companies in the Consortium, PNRI and Sandipala were responsible for producing the e-KTP cards. The other members were responsible for other segments of the Project, including conducting training seminars or installing other systems (eg, the government database).', '10\\u2003After Sandipala joined the Consortium, the Consortium submitted its tender proposal to the Indonesian government. As part of the tender process, each applicant had to submit two chips for evaluation, and the operating system masked onto each chip had to be an \u201copen operating system\u201d, ie, it could be put into the two types of chips specified. 6', 'In the proposal, the Consortium specified two chips made by different manufacturers, namely the NXP P308G0P3 chip (\u201cthe NXP chip\u201d) and the ST chip manufactured by ST-AP. 7', '11\\u2003After the proposal stage, the Indonesian government carried out proof of concept testing in May and June 2011. Bidders had to demonstrate how they would carry out the population data collection, production and personalisation of the e-KTP cards to the Indonesian government. This included the use of a sample set of the proposed chips (the NXP chip and ST chip) encoded with the proposed software and operating system. The Judge found that the evidence only established one test carried out at Sandipala\u2019s factory on 20 May 2011 (\u201cthe tender evaluation\u201d). 8', 'In the court below, the parties disputed the type of chips that were tested during the tender evaluation. Sandipala claimed that the ST chip (with a compatible operating system) was successfully tested, and ST-AP and\/or Oxel had promised that chips identical to those that were successfully tested would be supplied under the Supply Contract. Sandipala argued that the ST chip for the tender evaluation was supplied under a contract between Softorb (a subcontractor of one of the companies in the Consortium) and ST-AP for 100,000 chips (the \u201cTender Evaluation Chips\u201d). 9', 'The respondents, ST-AP, Oxel and Mr Cousin, claim that only the NXP chip, and not the ST chip, was tested because the ST chip was not ready for testing as of May 2011. They could not have promised Sandipala that they would supply the same ST chips as those tested during the tender evaluation because no such chips were tested. For reasons we will describe later (see [19] below), the Judge preferred the respondents\u2019 version.', '12\\u2003A month later on 21 June 2011, the Indonesian government awarded the Tender to the Consortium. 10', 'Its award approved the use of both the NXP chip and the ST chip. No operating system was specified. Shortly before or after the Tender was awarded, Sandipala purchased 14 personalisation machines from Datacard (to personalise the cards) that were configured to work with the NXP chips. 11', 'A month later, it purchased the NXP chips from two distributors. 12', 'During the four months which followed, it received or obtained quotations from other entities (including Oxel and ST-AP) for chips that could be used to produce the e-KTP cards. 13', 'Some of these quotations were for chips encoded with an operating system that would not be compatible with the existing e-KTP system.', '13\\u2003Sandipala eventually ordered chips from Oxel in November 2011 under the Supply Contract (see [8] above), with the first batch of 10m chips to be delivered in the last quarter of 2011 or the first quarter of 2012. 14', '14\\u2003The first batch of the Oxel chips were accordingly delivered in December 2011. These were accepted by Sandipala. A few days earlier, the Consortium had decided to reduce Sandipala\u2019s allocation of card production from about 103m chips to 60m chips. 15', 'Sandipala claims that it only realised two months later, in January 2012, that the Oxel chips could not be used to produce the e-KTP cards. (Oxel and the other respondents conversely claim that Sandipala knew of the incompatibility the moment it entered into the Supply Contract.) This was because although Oxel used the ST chip, which had been approved for use by the Indonesian government, Oxel\u2019s operating system, PAC, which was encoded on the chip, was incompatible with the e-KTP system unless certain fundamental changes were made to the system. Sandipala then attempted to obtain the Indonesian government\u2019s approval for changes to be made to the e-KTP system to accommodate the Oxel chips but this was not granted. Ms Tannos wrote to Mr Andi Bharata Winata (\u201cMr Winata\u201d), Oxel\u2019s sales and marketing representative in Indonesia, on 10 January 2012, requesting a temporary reduction of Sandipala\u2019s order, 16', 'which was rejected. Ms Tannos wrote again on 19 January 2012 asserting that the order for 100m chips was only an indicative order, save for 10m chips. 17', 'Oxel replied that the order was for a \u201ccommitted quantity\u201d of 100m chips. 18', '15\\u2003Sandipala rejected chips delivered to it from February to April 2012. To date, Oxel has purchased 19,426,284 chips (completed and encoded with the PAC operating system) 19', 'to fulfil its obligations under the Supply Contract but Sandipala has only accepted delivery of 5,874,364 chips in nine shipments. Out of the chips it has accepted delivery of, it has only paid for approximately a sixth of them, ie, 1,068,489 chips. 20', 'It has rejected six shipments amounting to 6,457,414 chips and has not paid for them. 21', '16\\u2003Sandipala commenced the proceedings in the suit below against ST-AP, Oxel and Mr Cousin on 28 June 2012.

{"casename":"2018_SGCA_18","fact":"'2\\u2003The Appellant is the proprietor of the Patent known as the \u201cautomotive accident recordal system and process\u201d (Patent No 87795). The Patent was first filed in 1999, published on 16 April 2002, and granted on 31 May 2002. Since then, the Appellant has renewed the Patent on a yearly basis.', '3\\u2003In essence, the patented invention (\u201cthe Invention\u201d) is an in-vehicle camera which is powered automatically and begins recording images when the driver turns the ignition system on. The camera records in a cyclical manner, with later images overwriting the earlier ones, so that at any one time, only the most recent images are stored. The recording of images stops in two instances: at the end of each journey when the ignition system is turned off; and upon impact to or sudden deceleration of the vehicle, such as in the event of an accident. In the latter instance, a sensor is triggered and the main power supply to the camera is cut. Thereafter, the camera continues recording using a standby power source, but only for a fixed interval of around five to ten seconds. As a result, images captured just before and after an accident are stored in memory and protected from being overwritten. In this way, the Invention is able to record and preserve \u201cvisual data leading up to the event of a dangerous situation requiring sharp braking or an accident\u201d.', '4\\u2003There are 22 claims in the Patent, of which eight were relevant to the Appellant\u2019s case at the trial. For the purposes of this appeal, only claim 1 of the Patent (\u201cClaim 1\u201d) is relevant. The facts and findings in relation to the other disputed claims can be found in the Judgment and we do not propose to reproduce them here. As for Claim 1, it reads as follows:', '5\\u2003The Respondent distributes and offers for sale in-vehicle cameras which include the following devices (collectively referred to as \u201cthe Devices\u201d):', '(a)\\u2003Marbella MX5 HC Digital Recorder (\u201cMX5\u201d);', '(b)\\u2003Marbella MX6 HC Digital Recorder; and', '(c)\\u2003Marbella QB6 HD Digital Recorder.', '6\\u2003Relying on s 66(1) of the Patents Act (Cap 221, 2005 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe PA\u201d), the Appellant alleged that the Respondent had infringed Claim 1 of the Patent by offering the Devices for sale. According to the Appellant, the Devices comprised all the features in Claim 1. On this basis, the Appellant sought orders for the delivery up of the Devices, an account of profits in respect of the Devices sold to date or damages to be assessed, and other reliefs.', '7\\u2003The Respondent raised two alternative defences. First, it filed particulars of objection against the Patent under O 87A r 3(2) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) alleging that the Patent was and had always been invalid because the relevant claims in the Patent were not novel and did not involve an inventive step. Second, the Respondent maintained that in any event, the sale of the Devices did not infringe the Patent because three essential features of Claim 1 of the Patent (\u201cthe three disputed essential features of Claim 1\u201d) were not found in the Devices. These features were:', '(a)\\u2003the existence of an ignition monitor;', '(b)\\u2003a means to send a signal from the ignition monitor to the system controller on detection of an ignition voltage; and', '(c)\\u2003a means to switch off at least one optical recorder after a fixed interval following the receipt of a sensor signal.', '8\\u2003The Respondent also counterclaimed for remedies under s 77 of the PA, which provides for the grant of an injunction, a declaration or damages where groundless threats of infringement proceedings are found to have been made. The Respondent claimed that the Appellant had made such threats by issuing two cease-and-desist letters to it. The first letter claimed that the Respondent had infringed the Patent by selling MX5 (only) and sought a letter of undertaking from the Respondent to: (a) cease doing so immediately; (b) deliver up all units of MX5 in its possession; and (c) pay damages as well as the Appellant\u2019s legal and investigative costs. The second letter, sent about eight months later, similarly informed the Respondent that it had infringed the Patent; but this time, the Appellant relied on the fact that the Respondent had been selling all three of the Devices. In the second letter, the Appellant further indicated that he would not enforce his strict legal rights provided that the Respondent agreed to: (a) sign a letter of undertaking acknowledging the infringement; (b) pay a licence fee in respect of each unit of the Devices that it had sold; (c) enter into a licence agreement for the future sale of the Devices; (d) pay costs for the expert opinion obtained by the Appellant; and (e) pay the Appellant\u2019s professional and investigative fees.'"}

{"casename":"2018_SGCA_2","fact":"'2\\u2003The appellant, Benzline Auto Pte Ltd (\u201cBenzline\u201d), is in the business of retail sale and wholesale of car parts and accessories, and of providing modification services using those parts and accessories. It also engages in the parallel importation of cars. Benzline\u2019s representatives during the period in which this dispute arose were Mr Ng Seng Keong (\u201cMr Ng\u201d, also known as \u201cKevin\u201d), who was and is Benzline\u2019s managing director, and Mr Chong Ban Cheong (\u201cMr Chong\u201d, also known as \u201cGeorge\u201d), who was then Benzline\u2019s marketing and business development manager. By the time of the trial, Mr Chong had left Benzline and he appeared at the trial as a witness for the respondents.', '3\\u2003The second respondent, Supercars Singapore Pte Ltd (\u201cSupercars Singapore\u201d), is a car retailer. The first respondent, Supercars Lorinser Pte Ltd (\u201cSupercars Lorinser\u201d), was incorporated by the second respondent as a conduit for the intended retail sale of a specific brand of cars, which we shall discuss shortly. For convenience, we refer to them as a collective entity, \u201cSupercars\u201d, except where the context requires a distinction to be drawn. Supercars\u2019 representatives were Mr Chua Yeow Kang (\u201cMr Chua\u201d, also known as \u201cMarcus\u201d), a director of both respondents, and Mr Yu Ming Yong (\u201cMr Yu\u201d), a shareholder of Supercars Singapore.', '4\\u2003Looming large in the background of this dispute are two German entities which are not parties to these proceedings. Daimler AG (\u201cDaimler\u201d) is the automobile manufacturer which produces, among others, the Mercedes-Benz line of cars. It does so through subsidiaries bearing the Mercedes-Benz name, but for ease of reference, we shall refer simply to Daimler as a collective entity. One of Daimler\u2019s customers is Sportservice Lorinser Sportliche Autoausrustung GmbH (\u201cLorinser\u201d). Lorinser is in the business of customising and tuning Mercedes-Benz cars for sale to consumers. It orders Mercedes-Benz cars, modifies them using its own parts (\u201cLorinser car parts\u201d), and sells the modified cars (\u201cLorinser cars\u201d) under the Lorinser brand. It also sells the Lorinser car parts separately. Lorinser\u2019s principal was Mr Marcus Lorinser and its main representative in its dealings with Benzline and Supercars was its export sales manager, Mr Evangelos Hatzikoitsis (\u201cEH\u201d). No witnesses from Daimler or Lorinser gave evidence in these proceedings.', '5\\u2003What follows is a brief outline of the facts. Especially pertinent details will be explored in greater depth at the appropriate points of our analysis.', '6\\u2003Benzline and Lorinser have a long history of business dealings. In 1993, Benzline was appointed the master dealer of Lorinser car parts in Singapore. In 2006, Benzline and Lorinser concluded a similar agreement in respect of Lorinser cars, and for a time Benzline actively pursued the importation and sale of Lorinser cars. Benzline\u2019s efforts were impeded by one major obstacle: Daimler\u2019s international consumer warranty (\u201cthe Daimler Warranty\u201d), which in Singapore was provided through Cycle & Carriage, only applied to direct imports of Mercedes-Benz cars. Since the Lorinser cars were considered parallel imports, they were not covered by the Daimler Warranty in Singapore. This meant that any warranty would have to be provided by Benzline itself at an added fee charged to its customers, making Lorinser cars a markedly less attractive value proposition. Benzline sold about 60 Lorinser cars before abandoning the experiment in 2007. Thereafter, it continued to hold the master dealership rights, but in practice restricted itself (as far as Lorinser\u2019s products were concerned) mainly to selling Lorinser car parts and customisation services, although it would occasionally order Lorinser cars at the special request of individual customers.', '7\\u2003This state of affairs continued until 2013, when EH informed Mr Ng and Mr Chong that Lorinser had concluded an agreement with Daimler to extend the Daimler Warranty to Lorinser cars, provided they were sold by an authorised dealer. A dealer wishing to participate in this new arrangement (hereinafter referred to as the \u201cSpecial Project\u201d) would have to enter into a fresh agreement with Lorinser for that purpose. EH mentioned that negotiations with a possible dealer in Thailand had fallen through. He then suggested that Benzline consider applying to be Lorinser\u2019s authorised dealer for Thailand, Malaysia, and\/or Singapore for the purposes of the Special Project. Benzline was intrigued by the Special Project, but was not inclined to be the direct retailer of Lorinser cars due to its relative lack of car retail expertise and human resources. Benzline hence considered that it would be more advantageous to find another party to assume the role of sub-dealer, allowing Benzline to make some profits (essentially as a middleman) without having to develop its own retail capabilities.', '8\\u2003It so happened that Mr Chong and Mr Chua were neighbours and had known each other for some years. Mr Chong was aware of Mr Chua\u2019s role in Supercars, and he decided to inform the latter of the opportunity as well as to recommend Supercars to Mr Ng. The recommendation was well received by Mr Ng, and the three men began discussions with a view toward Benzline and Supercars entering into an exclusive sub-dealership agreement for the purposes of the Special Project (\u201cthe Exclusive Sub-Dealership Agreement\u201d). Many of these discussions involved Lorinser as well.', '9\\u2003At least initially, Supercars was interested in being the exclusive sub-dealer of Lorinser cars in Thailand as well as Singapore. Somewhere along the way, talk of operations in Thailand petered out, and the parties focused their discussions on the Singapore market. In late 2013, the discussions appeared to be going well, and both parties were confident that the Exclusive Sub-Dealership Agreement would materialise in due course. However, the decision was not entirely in their hands as Lorinser had the power to accept or reject a proposed sub-dealer. For this among other reasons (see [29]\u2013[30] below), the terms of the Exclusive Sub-Dealership Agreement were dependent on the terms of a new master dealership agreement between Benzline and Lorinser (\u201cthe Benzline\u2013Lorinser Agreement\u201d), which was to cover the Special Project. As a consequence, the parties could not attempt to finalise the Exclusive Sub-Dealership Agreement until April 2014, when the final draft of the Benzline\u2013Lorinser Agreement was produced.', '10\\u2003During this waiting period, discussions continued regarding certain orders which had to be placed with Daimler (and which therefore first had to be placed with Lorinser). Daimler expected its buyers to provide it with projected yearly orders for planning purposes (\u201cPlanning Orders\u201d). In order to actually obtain cars, buyers would subsequently have to place monthly orders (\u201cPurchase Orders\u201d) accompanied by a 30% deposit on each order.', '11\\u2003In January 2014, EH reminded the parties that if the deposit on Supercars\u2019 first Purchase Order (\u201cthe First Purchase Order\u201d) was not placed soon, there could be a lengthy delay in the eventual delivery of the Lorinser cars, and this would hinder Supercars\u2019 achievement of its sales target for the year 2014. The course of their correspondence on this matter was as follows:', '(a)\\u2003On 17 January 2014, EH sent an e-mail to Mr Chua (copied to Mr Ng, Mr Chong, and Marcus Lorinser) to request Mr Chua to submit two things: an amended Planning Order for 2014 and \u201cthe [P]urchase [O]rders for the first order for May production (total[ling] 7x units)\u201d. EH further requested that Mr Chua \u201ctransfer the deposit of 30% directly to [Lorinser\u2019s] account\u201d.', '(b)\\u2003On 21 January 2014, EH sent an e-mail to Mr Ng containing the first draft of the Benzline\u2013Lorinser Agreement (\u201cthe First Draft Agreement\u201d) as an attachment. He requested that Mr Ng circulate the contents of the draft to Mr Chua and Mr Yu and \u201cask them to study it\u201d. That was done and Mr Chua and Mr Yu then reviewed the First Draft Agreement. The terms of the First Draft Agreement are discussed in detail at [33]\u2013[34] below.', '(c)\\u2003On 22 January 2014, having discussed the matter with Mr Chua, Mr Yu met Mr Ng and, on behalf of Supercars, gave him a personal cheque for $300,000 drawn in favour of Benzline (ie, the Payment), accompanied by a payment voucher filled in by Mr Yu (\u201cthe Payment Voucher\u201d) which stated the payment to be a \u201c30% deposit for New Mercedes as attached\u201d. Mr Ng signed and returned the Payment Voucher.', '(d)\\u2003On 27 January 2014, Mr Chong sent an e-mail to EH (copied to Mr Ng) to place an order for nine cars (ie, the First Purchase Order). The e-mail stated the names and codes of the cars as well as the codes for the various customisation options to be applied to each car. These nine cars were described as being \u201cfor the initial launching\u201d.', '(e)\\u2003On 6 February 2014, EH sent an e-mail to Mr Ng (copied to Mr Chong) regarding some problems with the First Purchase Order. He informed Mr Ng that some of the models in that order were unavailable, and that this had caused Daimler\u2019s system to reject the order. He listed the \u201c[a]lternative and current[ly] available models\u201d that could be ordered instead. Mr Chong forwarded EH\u2019s e-mail to Mr Chua on the same day.', '(f)\\u2003On 12 February 2014, Mr Chong sent an e-mail to EH (copied to Mr Ng, Mr Chua, and Marcus Lorinser) stating the desired substitute models. Further e-mail exchanges on the topic followed, and it appears that the First Purchase Order was finalised (after substitutions, and the number being reduced to seven cars) in late February 2014.', '12\\u2003It is unclear from the evidence when precisely the First Purchase Order was successfully entered into Daimler\u2019s system and when the Payment was used by Lorinser to place the deposit on the First Purchase Order. It is undisputed, however, that the Payment was sent to Lorinser by Benzline and that Lorinser did pay Daimler. Additionally, a Planning Order of 100 cars was agreed and submitted by Supercars.', '13\\u2003Between February and April 2014, the parties continued their discussions, and some additional Purchase Orders were placed (primarily through direct correspondence between Supercars and Lorinser), but Supercars did not make any payment to either Benzline or Lorinser in respect of those.', '14\\u2003On 29 April 2014, EH sent Mr Ng a copy of the second and final draft of the Benzline\u2013Lorinser Agreement (\u201cthe Second Draft Agreement\u201d) who then forwarded the draft to Mr Chua. The parties dispute precisely the actions that were taken by Supercars and Benzline following this, but what is material and undisputed is that Mr Chua strongly objected to the inclusion of a clause (cl 18.2) which required Benzline to provide Lorinser with a standby letter of credit (\u201cstandby LC\u201d) in the amount of \u20ac250,000. Since the Exclusive Sub-Dealership Agreement was to mirror the Benzline\u2013Lorinser Agreement, the parties understood this to imply that Supercars would have to provide the standby LC. Mr Chua was unwilling to have Supercars do so, and Lorinser was, at least to Benzline\u2019s understanding, equally unwilling to have the clause removed.', '15\\u2003Between April and May 2014, the parties had a number of discussions concerning the problem. According to Supercars, a compromise was reached under which Supercars would contract directly with Lorinser and would be willing to provide the standby LC pursuant to that contract, with Benzline\u2019s profits to be replaced by a separately negotiated commission; Benzline denies that there was any such compromise. Either way, on 21 May 2014, Mr Chua e-mailed Marcus Lorinser directly (without copying anyone from Benzline) to propose this new arrangement. Lorinser on its part did not reply and only forwarded the e-mail to Mr Ng, who did not react well to this development. Later in May 2014, Supercars caught wind that Benzline had instead entered into an exclusive sub-dealership agreement with a competitor, Regal Motors Pte Ltd (\u201cRegal\u201d). Supercars considered this to be an indication that its relationship with Benzline was at an end. At this point, no Lorinser cars had been delivered to Supercars. Supercars demanded a refund of the Payment, which Benzline refused to give. Supercars then commenced the proceedings below.'"}
{"casename":"2018_SGCA_20","fact":"'3\\u2003This case involves a husband, a wife, and the wife\u2019s mother. Divorce proceedings were started by the husband in 2008. The proceedings were prolonged due to disputes unrelated to the issue before us. By 2015, matters had reached the stage where the parties were preparing for the ancillary matters hearing on the division of matrimonial property. In July 2015, the mother, whom we shall henceforth call \u201cthe intervener\u201d, applied for leave to intervene in the divorce proceedings. The basis of her application was that she wished to dispute the husband\u2019s claim that an immovable property owned by the intervener was actually held by her on trust for the husband and wife and constituted a matrimonial asset. This application succeeded before the Family Court.', '4\\u2003Thereafter, the husband applied for leave to cross-examine the intervener and the wife in respect of the dispute over the ownership of the property. The Family Court granted leave for cross-examination of the husband, the wife and the intervener. The wife and the intervener were dissatisfied and appealed to the Family Division against the order for cross-examination. On the hearing of the appeal, the High Court Judge (\u201cthe Judge\u201d) raised the question of whether the court, exercising its power under s 112 of the Women\u2019s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe Charter\u201d), had the jurisdiction and power to determine the intervener\u2019s interest in the property and make orders against her since she was a third party to the divorce proceedings.', '5\\u2003The intervener and the wife took the position that the court ought to determine any property dispute involving the intervener together with the issues under s 112 of the Charter. They submitted that although this section did not expressly state that the court which dealt with the division of matrimonial property had such power, such courts had in the past determined the nature and extent of third party interests before dividing the matrimonial assets between divorcing spouses. Further, this jurisdiction arose, if not from s 112 of the Charter, then from ss 22 and 25 of the FJA as well as ss 16 and 17 of and the First Schedule to the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe SCJA\u201d).', '6\\u2003The husband, on the other hand, argued that s 112 of the Charter did not apply to the determination of a third party\u2019s property rights and a separate civil suit had to be commenced by either the intervener or the divorcing parties in relation to the disputed property.'"}

{"casename":"2018_SGCA_23","fact":"'5\\u2003The Appellants were, at the material time, a family of Korean nationals living in Indonesia. The first appellant (\u201cthe 1st Appellant\u201d) is the father, the fourth appellant (\u201cthe 4th Appellant\u201d) is the mother, while the second and third appellants (\u201cthe 2nd Appellant\u201d and \u201cthe 3rd Appellant\u201d respectively) are their sons. The 3rd Appellant is not a person in respect of whom information was sought by the NTS in the Request. The 1st Appellant owns a group of companies known as the \u201cK Group\u201d, which has ten subsidiaries in Korea and 30 subsidiaries in Indonesia. The 1st Appellant acquired Indonesian citizenship in April 2014 and is no longer a Korean citizen.', '6\\u2003At the material time, the NTS was conducting criminal tax investigations into the affairs of five individuals (\u201cthe five Korean taxpayers\u201d): the 1st, 2nd and 4th Appellants, and two other persons who were officials of the K Group. Specifically, the NTS suspected that the 1st Appellant was the beneficial owner of a number of Singapore-incorporated companies (\u201cthe Singapore Entities\u201d) as well as related entities in the British Virgin Islands (\u201cBVI\u201d), the Netherlands, Hong Kong and Panama (\u201cthe Related Foreign Entities\u201d). A total of 51 companies were implicated. The NTS suspected that the 1st Appellant had incorporated these 51 nominee companies (\u201cthe 51 implicated companies\u201d) using the names of his family members (specifically, the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Appellants) as well as the names of various employees of the K Group as the directors and shareholders of these companies, and, through this scheme, had evaded tax on the investment income of these 51 companies even though he was their beneficial owner. From its investigations, the NTS had reason to believe that the five Korean taxpayers as well as these 51 companies had bank accounts in Singapore that were being used to conceal unreported income and evade taxes.', '7\\u2003On 23 September 2013, the NTS submitted the Request to the Comptroller to obtain information relating to the five Korean taxpayers and the 51 implicated companies. The Request was made pursuant to Art 25(1) of the Convention. Article 25 of the Convention, which is incorporated into our domestic legislation via s 105D of the Income Tax Act (Cap 134, 2014 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe ITA\u201d), reads as follows:', '8\\u2003Section 105D of the ITA also bears setting out in full:', '9\\u2003It was not disputed by the parties that the NTS was a \u201ccompetent authority\u201d and the Convention, a \u201cprescribed arrangement\u201d, for the purposes of s 105D of the ITA.', '10\\u2003In the Request, the NTS sought, in relation to the five Korean taxpayers and the 51 implicated companies, Singapore bank account information and documents, including bank statements, account opening contracts, personal information of agents and consignees, cancelled cheques, deposit slips and transactional documents, for the period from 1 January 2003 onwards. The cover letter accompanying the Request included the following confirmation by the NTS:', '11\\u2003In response to the Request, the Comptroller wrote to the NTS on 7 November 2013 to clarify certain matters. The Comptroller sought to understand \u201cthe legality and tax implications\u201d under Korean law of Korean taxpayers owning offshore companies. The Comptroller also pointed to Singapore\u2019s EOI requirements in the Eighth Schedule of the ITA (\u201cthe Eighth Schedule\u201d), and asked for the following specific clarifications to \u201cunderstand the relevance of the requested information to [the NTS\u2019s] tax investigation\u201d:', '12\\u2003In addition, the Comptroller asked, among other things, that the NTS share, \u201c[f]or each of the identified country group of the Related Foreign Entities and the related Korean taxpayer(s) involved, \u2026 [its] basis of suspicion and the findings thus far that led to the [Request]\u201d.', '13\\u2003The NTS replied to the Comptroller on 16 December 2013 duly responding to each of the points of clarification sought by the Comptroller. In the cover letter accompanying its reply, the NTS included the same confirmation as that mentioned above at [10].', '14\\u2003To explain the five Korean taxpayers\u2019 suspected tax evasion scheme, the NTS drew a diagram illustrating what it believed to be the structure of the scheme across the various jurisdictions involved. According to the NTS, the 1st Appellant was a Korean tax resident and was hence obliged to report his worldwide income to the NTS. The NTS suspected that the 1st Appellant had made investments through several offshore companies located in various jurisdictions (including the 51 implicated companies) and believed him to be the beneficial owner of these companies. The 1st Appellant had allegedly failed to report the income earned through these companies, and the NTS believed that he had concealed the unreported income in Singapore bank accounts.', '15\\u2003The NTS also referred the Comptroller to information that it had recovered from a USB drive found in the 1st Appellant\u2019s Korean office (\u201cthe USB Drive\u201d), \u201cmany substantial documents\u201d and emails that it had obtained through its investigations and tax audit, as well as statements of officials in the K Group who had allowed their names to be used to incorporate the Related Foreign Entities, all as evidence forming the basis of its suspicion that the 1st Appellant was the beneficial owner of the aforementioned companies and had used them to invest and conceal unreported income.', '16\\u2003On 17 January 2014, the Comptroller sought further clarification. Based on the information that had by then been provided by the NTS, the Comptroller had grouped the 51 implicated companies into three groups. In this second letter, the Comptroller sought \u201cfurther background\u201d on one group of nine foreign companies whose links to the 1st Appellant did not seem apparent and whose shareholders were not any of the five Korean taxpayers. The Comptroller also sought clarification as to whether two specific companies were actually BVI or Indonesian entities.', '17\\u2003In addition, the Comptroller sought the NTS\u2019s confirmation as to whether it was seeking confidentiality in respect of the Request such that the five Korean taxpayers and the 51 implicated companies would not be notified that their Singapore bank records were being sought pursuant to an EOI request.', '18\\u2003Subsequently, representatives of the Comptroller and the NTS met in Korea on 21 January 2014 to discuss the Request. In the course of the meeting, the NTS confirmed, based on what it had uncovered in the course of its investigations, its belief that the 51 implicated companies were companies which were wholly controlled by the 1st Appellant. The NTS informed the Comptroller that these companies had been used to receive unreported income, with a sum of at least US$250m kept in Singapore bank accounts that were held in their names. As the 1st Appellant had failed to report his overseas income and assets, the NTS required information on what it believed to be hidden foreign income and assets in order to assess the suspected evaded taxes. The minutes of the meeting also recorded that certain documents providing details relating to the 51 implicated companies were furnished to the Comptroller on his request.', '19\\u2003The NTS further informed the Comptroller that it was seeking confidentiality in relation to the Request because its investigations into the five Korean taxpayers were serious criminal investigations and the latter had not been notified of the Request by the NTS.', '20\\u2003After due consideration of the Request, and following the various rounds of clarifications that had taken place, with information and documents provided by the NTS over the course of several months from September 2013 onwards, the Comptroller was satisfied that the Request satisfied the requirements stipulated in the Convention and the ITA. The Comptroller accordingly exercised his power under s 105F read with s 65B of the ITA to issue the Production Notices to three Singapore banks: one to the Singapore branch of Woori Bank on 21 January 2014, and the other two to UBS AG and Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Limited respectively on 27 January 2014.', '21\\u2003The Production Notices were issued on a confidential basis, and the five Korean taxpayers as well as the 51 implicated companies were not notified of the Request prior to the issuance of these notices. However, on or around 27 January 2014, employees of the Appellants\u2019 companies were informed of the Request by the NTS\u2019s investigators. The Appellants also learnt from the NTS\u2019s investigators that the Comptroller had, in response to the Request, issued the Production Notices. On 11 February 2014, the Appellants filed OS 106 seeking leave to apply for a prohibiting order and a quashing order against the Comptroller and the Production Notices respectively (see [2] above).', '22\\u2003On 8 May 2014, almost four months after the issuance of the Production Notices and some three months after the filing of OS 106, the 1st Appellant commenced adjudication proceedings in Korea with the National Tax Tribunal (\u201cthe NTT\u201d) to dispute his tax residency in Korea for the years 2003 to 2012. He did so by bringing an appeal against the tax assessment issued against him by the NTS on 7 March 2013, which was predicated on his being tax resident in Korea at the material time. The rest of the Appellants similarly requested adjudication by the NTT to determine their tax residency, but the NTT decided that that would be done only after the 1st Appellant\u2019s tax residency had been reviewed.', '23\\u2003On 2 May 2016, the NTT determined that the NTS should re-investigate the issue of the 1st Appellant\u2019s tax residency in Korea. This was premised on a particular provision in the Korea-Indonesia tax treaty which was engaged when a person of interest was a dual resident of both Contracting States. In such circumstances, it was necessary to ascertain with which of the two States that person\u2019s economic relations was closer. This was the specific issue that the NTS was to revisit. The NTT, however, did opine that it was reasonable to consider the 1st Appellant a Korean resident for the purposes of Korean tax law, and that the 1st Appellant\u2019s personal relations appeared to be closer to Korea than Indonesia.', '24\\u2003On 21 June 2016, the NTS issued the result of its re-investigation and maintained that its original tax assessment against the 1st Appellant was lawful. On 13 July 2016, the 1st Appellant filed a complaint with the Seoul Administrative Court seeking to overturn the NTS\u2019s tax assessment.', '25\\u2003In relation to the NTS\u2019s tax assessments against the 2nd to 4th Appellants, the NTT issued its decision on these tax assessments on 5 July 2016. The NTT cancelled a portion of the gift tax assessments against the 2nd and 3rd Appellants, but concluded that the rest of the tax assessments against the 2nd to 4th Appellants were lawful. At the time the Appellants\u2019 case in this appeal was filed, the 2nd to 4th Appellants were preparing to challenge the NTT\u2019s decision in the Seoul Administrative Court.'"}

Broadley was Singbuild Pte Ltd (\u201cSingbuild\u201d)\u2019s sub-contractor and used the equipment supplied under the Contract to fulfill its obligations under its contract with Singbuild.', '4\\u2003Broadley began defaulting on payments to Alacran in 2015 because Singbuild, in turn, was not paying Broadley. Mr Lin Zhonghan (\u201cMr Lin\u201d), Alacran\u2019s former business development manager, chased Mr Govindaraju Elanthiriyan (\u201cMr Govin\u201d), Broadley\u2019s managing director, for the payments. They met twice to discuss Broadley\u2019s payment of the outstanding sum of $423,407.34 (\u201cthe Outstanding Sum\u201d). They first met in August 2015 (\u201cthe First Meeting\u201d) and again three months later in November 2015 (\u201cthe Second Meeting\u201d). Certain facts regarding the meetings are disputed. For the First Meeting, it is not disputed that Broadley issued post-dated cheques (for September 2015) to Alacran for the Outstanding Sum (\u201cthe Cheques\u201d), to be encashed by Alacran only after Singbuild had paid Alacran. What is disputed is who suggested the issuance of the Cheques. Mr Lin and Mr Govin point to each other.', '5\\u2003The main factual dispute arises from the Second Meeting:', '(a)\\u2003Mr Lin, representing Alacran, claims that (i) Mr Govin proposed that an undertaking be issued to authorise Singbuild to pay the Outstanding Sum directly to Alacran from the money that Singbuild owed Broadley; (ii) Mr Lin informed Mr Govin that it did not matter who paid the Outstanding Sum as long as it was paid, but if Singbuild defaulted on the payment, Broadley would remain liable for any outstanding amount; and (iii) Mr Govin remained silent in response to Mr Lin\u2019s statement in (ii).', '(b)\\u2003Mr Govin, representing Broadley, alleges that (i) Mr Lin asked Mr Govin to issue an undertaking as Alacran wished to collect the Outstanding Sum directly from Singbuild; (ii) Mr Lin said that he would return the Cheques to Broadley once the undertaking was signed; and (iii) Mr Govin agreed to prepare an undertaking and informed Mr Lin that the undertaking would absolve Broadley from all further liability to Alacran.', 'For reasons we will go into later (see [9] below), the Judge found that Mr Lin\u2019s version was more likely on a balance of probabilities.', '6\\u2003Two days after the Second Meeting, on 6 November 2015, Broadley (through one Ms Chatterly, a senior quantity surveyor at Broadley) sent a draft of the undertaking to Mr Lin via email. The email stated \u201cplease find draft Undertaking letter which we [Broadley] will send to SingBuild\u201d. 1', 'The undertaking is a one-page letter (\u201cthe Undertaking\u201d), on Broadley\u2019s letterhead and addressed to Singbuild. When the draft of the Undertaking was sent to Mr Lin on 6 November 2015, it had not been signed by any of the parties. Broadley (through Mr Govin) and Singbuild signed the Undertaking at a subsequent site meeting. Mr Lin then took the Undertaking back to his office and signed it on behalf of Alacran. 2', 'No changes whatsoever were made to the text of the Undertaking. It read as follows:', '7\\u2003Both Mr Lin and Mr Govin state that the Undertaking was meant to reflect what they had discussed at the Second Meeting. Mr Lin\u2019s evidence was that he believed that the Undertaking only authorised Singbuild to pay on behalf of Broadley without releasing Broadley from liability for the Outstanding Sum, whereas Mr Govin\u2019s evidence was that the purpose of the Undertaking was for Singbuild to assume all of Broadley\u2019s liability to Alacran and to absolve Broadley from all liability to Alacran. In other words, Mr Govin understood the Undertaking as effecting an assignment of the debt, ie, the Outstanding Sum.'"}

It had a fleet of three chartered vessels, including the V8 Stealth II (\u201cthe Vessel\u201d), and it sub-chartered these vessels out to third party charterers on shorter fixtures or participated in vessel pooling arrangements. The Vessel was chartered from the appellant, Diablo Fortune Inc (\u201cDiablo\u201d), pursuant to a BIMCO Standard Bareboat Charter (\u201cthe Bareboat Charter\u201d) that the Company entered into with Diablo on 6 June 2008. The charter period was initially stipulated to be five years, but was subsequently extended to 4 May 2017.', '8\\u2003On 10 March 2010, the Company entered into a Standard Ship Management Agreement (\u201cManagement Agreement\u201d) with V Ships (Asia) Pte Ltd (\u201cV Ships\u201d) for V Ships to provide technical and crew management services in respect of the Vessel. The Company also entered into a pooling arrangement with V8 Pool Inc (\u201cV8\u201d) on 9 February 2011 (\u201cthe Pool Agreement\u201d). Under the Pool Agreement, the Company earned revenue from the Vessel by sub-chartering it to V8, which in turn employed the Vessel in the pooling arrangement. To facilitate the Pool Agreement, V8 engaged Navig8 Asia Pte Ltd (\u201cNavig8\u201d) to manage the commercial affairs of the Vessel. V8 paid the Company charter hire monthly based on the actual earnings from the pooling arrangement divided by the number of pool participants and after deducting the management fee due to Navig8.', '9\\u2003The Company subsequently incurred substantial losses and was unable to pay its debts. On 19 December 2016, the Company filed a winding up application in Singapore. On 21 December 2016, the Company\u2019s directors notified Diablo of the winding up application, and informed Diablo that it intended to arrange for early redelivery of the Vessel as the Company no longer had the financial means to pay hire or continue with the Bareboat Charter. 1', '10\\u2003Upon receiving this notification, Diablo sought to exercise a lien on the sub-freights due from V8 to the Company (the \u201cLien\u201d) pursuant to cl 18 of the Bareboat Charter, which states:', 'To this end, Diablo sent a lien notice to V8 on 30 December 2016.', '11\\u2003As referred to at [8] above, under the Pool Agreement, V8 was to make distributions to the Company for charter hire earned.

That interest was recorded as income in Group Lease Singapore\u2019s 2016 financial statements, which was in turn a \u201cfabrication of accounting records and exaggeration of [Group Lease Thailand\u2019s] operating results\u201d. 15', 'As a result, the Commission said, it had decided to lodge a criminal complaint against Group Lease Thailand and had banned Mr Konoshita from occupying directorships in Thai companies.', '14\\u2003After the Commission\u2019s news release, Ernst & Young, who was the independent auditor of Group Lease Thailand and its subsidiaries, issued on 13 November 2017 a \u201cReport on Review of Interim Financial Information\u201d to the shareholders of Group Lease Thailand. 16', 'This report, in the light of the news release, revises Group Lease Thailand\u2019s 2015, 2016, 1Q2017 and 2Q2017 profits and net assets, stating for that purpose that profits for 2015 and 2016 had to be revised downwards by 30% and 45% respectively. 17', 'The report also states that if the Commission\u2019s allegations are true, then the relevant past financial statements would \u201chave to be actively corrected and revised with the now known fraud which is indicative of wholesale-fraudulent misrepresentation in the past of the loans granted by [Group Lease Thailand] to the borrowers in Cyprus and Singapore\u201d. 18', '15\\u2003JTrust claims that during this time, it \u201ctried to make sense of what happened and explored its options for potential recovery\u201d. 19', 'One option was to discuss with Mr Konoshita the possibility of integrating JTrust and Group Lease Thailand\u2019s parent company in Japan, Wedge Holdings. This was explored, but negotiations for that purpose by mid-December 2017 had not reached any landing. JTrust asserts, in particular, that Mr Konoshita asked for more time, but later \u201cdropped out of touch after 28 November 2017\u201d, after which his brother Mr Tatsuya carried on the correspondence. Eventually, JTrust came to the view that Group Lease Thailand was simply \u201cengaging in delaying tactics\u201d, 20', 'and decided that it had to take a decision for which it could give an account to its shareholders.', '16\\u2003JTrust then instructed two consultancy firms, Control Risks Group (S) Pte Ltd (\u201cControl Risks\u201d) and Matson, Driscoll & Damico Pte Ltd (\u201cMDD\u201d), to investigate the ownership and profile of Group Lease Singapore\u2019s borrowers and the nature of the loans. Two expert reports were produced, one by Mr Charles Warren of Control Risks dated 22 December 2017 (\u201cthe Warren Report\u201d) 21', 'and the other by Mr Iain Potter of MDD also dated 22 December 2017 (\u201cthe Potter Report\u201d). 22', '17\\u2003The reports state that Group Lease Singapore\u2019s loans to the Singapore and Cyprus Borrowers served no discernible commercial purpose. 23', 'There was little information to suggest that these borrowers had commercial activities at the time the loans were made. The reports also state that Group Lease Singapore\u2019s real reason for extending loans to the Singapore and Cyprus Borrowers was questionable because these companies had been incorporated just months before millions of dollars were loaned to them. 24', '18\\u2003The Potter Report, in particular, states the following:', '(a)\\u2003It was very unlikely that the loans were entered into on a commercial arms\u2019 length basis, given (i) the absence of a commercial rationale for the Borrowers to enter into loans that had very high interest rates (of 14.5% or 25%); (ii) the Commission\u2019s finding, indicated in the news release of 16 October 2017, that the Cyprus Borrowers and Cougar were \u201ccontrolled\u201d by Mr Konoshita; and (iii) Group Lease Thailand\u2019s ability to obtain early repayment of the loans. 25', '(b)\\u2003It was very likely that the interest repayments received by Group Lease Singapore were being made from the capital that had been loaned by Group Lease Singapore to the Borrowers, unless the Borrowers had been able to put the loan funding they had received into investments which generated returns in excess of 25% annually, but that was unlikely because there was no information to suggest that they had commercial activities. 26', 'In other words, a round-tripping scheme was in place.', '(c)\\u2003After the Commission\u2019s news release, Group Lease Thailand\u2019s management decided to account for a provision equal to the remaining balance of the loan receivables and accrued interest as of 30 September 2017, which was approximately US$65m. This meant that Group Lease Thailand had recognised that they had suffered a loss of that amount. This fact indicated that the true nature of the loans was a series of interest-free loans with large portions of the capital being forgiven. 27', '19\\u2003Considering that Group Lease Thailand had to recognise an irrecoverable loss of US$65m on the loans it had extended to the Singapore and Cyprus Borrowers, and considering that its auditor, Ernst & Young, had to revise its declared profits for 2015 and 2016 downwards by 30% and 45% respectively in the light of the Commission\u2019s news release (see [14] above), Group Lease Thailand did not appear to be the successful profit-making company that JTrust had invested in.', '20\\u2003On the footing of this and other information, JTrust on 26 December 2017 brought the Conspiracy Action against seven parties, comprising Group Lease Singapore, Mr Konoshita, Cougar, and the Cyprus Borrowers. 28', 'According to its statement of claim, these seven parties together with Group Lease Thailand conspired to defraud JTrust of its investment of US$180m in Group Lease Thailand. JTrust also alleges that Mr Konoshita misappropriated JTrust\u2019s investment in Group Lease Thailand by transferring the monies from the investments in the form of loans to the third to the seventh defendants in the Conspiracy Action, who then used part of those monies to purchase from Mr Konoshita shares in a company called APF Group Co Ltd (\u201cAPF\u201d), which JTrust alleges is Mr Konoshita\u2019s personal investment vehicle. 29', '21\\u2003JTrust claims that but for the fraud, it would not have converted the debentures obtained under the first investment agreement. Nor would it have invested the sum of US$180m under the second and third investment agreement or later purchased Group Lease Thailand\u2019s shares and warrants. Therefore, its claimed losses include the monies it invested under the three agreements; the expenses it incurred in entering those agreements and in converting the first agreement\u2019s debentures and in the purchase of shares and warrants; and the costs of financing its investments in Group Lease Thailand.', '22\\u2003The respondents do not contest the general sequence of events in JTrust\u2019s narrative. Instead, their central contention is that the Conspiracy Action and the application for the Mareva injunction, together with this appeal, are part of JTrust\u2019s global scheme to bring the Group Lease group of companies to its knees by inflicting upon it \u201cmaximum commercial and reputational damage\u201d so that it would be \u201ceasy prey\u201d for a forcible takeover, thus enabling JTrust to obtain the integration it had failed to negotiate in the immediate aftermath of the Commission\u2019s news release. 30', 'JTrust, say the respondents, is therefore not really interested in recouping its investment. The respondents also say that the facts outlined below should have been fully and frankly disclosed at the ex parte application, and that they show that JTrust has not come to court with clean hands and should therefore be disqualified from obtaining Mareva relief.', '23\\u2003The respondents highlight that in 2015, JTrust\u2019s parent company, JTrust Japan, together with one of its subsidiaries, PT Bank JTrust Indonesia Tbk (\u201cJTrust Indonesia\u201d), were sued in Mauritius by a group of companies referred to in these proceedings as the Weston Entities for conspiracy to defraud the group of substantial monies. In May 2015, the Supreme Court of Mauritius granted the Weston Entities final judgment against JTrust Japan and JTrust Indonesia in the sum of US$110.5m. That judgment has since given rise to a judgment debt in the sum of approximately US$200m due to accrued interest. In June 2015, the same court granted the Weston Entities worldwide Mareva injunctions against JTrust Japan and JTrust Indonesia to ensure payment of the judgment sum. 31', '24\\u2003The Weston Entities later brought contempt proceedings against JTrust, alleging that it had caused JTrust Japan\u2019s failure to pay the judgment debt by using funds which had been frozen to invest in Group Lease Thailand through the very investment agreements in respect of which JTrust seeks now to recover its investment from Group Lease Thailand. 32', 'The Supreme Court of Mauritius found JTrust, as well as Mr Fujisawa and Mr Asano, in contempt of court for breaching the Mauritian Mareva injunction issued in June 2015. 33', '25\\u2003The Weston Entities then brought an action 34', 'in Singapore in October 2015 against JTrust Japan and JTrust Indonesia to recover the judgment sum that the Weston Entities were awarded in Mauritius in May 2015. The Weston Entities are represented in that action by Mr Eugene Thuraisingam, who appeared before the Judge below on behalf of the Weston Entities on a watching brief. As the Judge observed in the Judgment, at the hearing, counsel for Group Lease Singapore and Mr Konoshita, Mr Edric Pan, denied that his clients were collaborating with the Weston Entities. Also, Mr Thuraisingam stated that sum claimed in the action involves the same fund as does the sum claimed by JTrust in the Conspiracy Action, but this was denied by counsel for JTrust, Mr Chan Leng Sun SC: see the Judgment at [9]. Although the Weston Entities\u2019 action in Singapore was commenced in 2015, it is currently still at the pleadings stage.', '26\\u2003The respondents also highlight that after the Exchange on 9 March 2017 publicly asked Group Lease Thailand for information on the Singapore and Cyprus Borrowers, and after Group Lease Thailand responded with assurances on 13 March 2017, JTrust did not demand any further explanation from Group Lease Thailand about the loans. 35', 'Instead, it made numerous further investments into Group Lease Thailand from March to September 2017.', '27\\u2003Also, after the Commission issued its news release of 16 October 2017, JTrust did not immediately issue a legal claim against Group Lease Thailand. Instead, Mr Fujisawa expressed solidarity with Mr Konoshita and Group Lease Thailand. 36', 'On the day of the news release, Mr Fujisawa and Mr Konoshita exchanged a number of text messages 37', 'in which Mr Fujisawa advised the latter to be \u201cvery careful\u201d as Thailand was \u201cno longer a law-abiding country\u201d 38', 'and agreed with him that the Commission\u2019s suggestion that the loans to the Cyprus Borrowers posted an excessive profit was \u201ctotally untrue\u201d. 39', '28\\u2003Mr Fujisawa then spent the next month and a half meeting with Mr Konoshita and other representatives of Group Lease Thailand to negotiate a merger with JTrust. The two men during that period remained on cordial terms, although Mr Fujisawa had by the end of November grown impatient. On 30 November 2017, JTrust served a letter of demand on Group Lease Thailand purporting to cancel the second and third investment agreements. But even after that, email communications on the proposed merger continued into mid-December 2017. The respondents highlight that not once during this time did Mr Fujisawa claim to have been defrauded by Group Lease Thailand or Mr Konoshita. 40', 'Instead, Mr Fujisawa twice stated, in his emails in December 2017, that if the Commission retracted its allegation that Mr Konoshita had acted fraudulently, then JTrust would resume its partnership with Group Lease Thailand without terminating the agreements. 41', '29\\u2003The negotiations for the proposed merger eventually broke down in mid-December. The respondents highlight that this was the \u201cmost proximate event\u201d to the commencement of the Conspiracy Action. 42', 'JTrust displayed no urgency in bringing the claim after the Commission published its news release because JTrust had waited until mid-December to appoint its experts to investigate the Singapore and Cyprus Borrowers and the nature of the loans that Group Lease Singapore extended to those entities. 43', 'By then, say the respondents, JTrust had already decided to commence proceedings, and \u201cjust needed an \u2018expert\u2019 to rubber-stamp its intended case theory\u201d. 44', '30\\u2003In addition to bringing the Conspiracy Action in Singapore on 26 December 2017, JTrust on 21 December 2017 brought proceedings in the British Virgin Islands (\u201cBVI\u201d) against Mr Konoshita and APF. We shall call this the \u201cBVI Action\u201d. In the BVI Action, JTrust claims that Mr Konoshita and APF dishonestly induced it to invest in Group Lease Thailand, knowing that the investment monies would be misappropriated to Mr Konoshita and APF, and that Mr Konoshita acted dishonestly by failing to inform JTrust that he was the ultimate controller and beneficial owner of Cougar and the Cyprus Borrowers. 45', 'JTrust has obtained a worldwide Mareva injunction against Mr Konoshita and APF in the BVI Action (\u201cthe BVI Order\u201d). The respondents rely on this order to argue that JTrust is abusing the court\u2019s process by seeking another set of worldwide Mareva injunctions in these proceedings.'"}
{"casename":"2018_SGCA_28","fact":"'5\\u2003V8 has been disposing of waste wood with BFI since 2007. Initially, V8 agreed to dispose of its waste wood at $40 per metric ton (\u201cpmt\u201d), but there was no written agreement between the parties. Sometime in late 2010, Eugene Lee Shung Guan (\u201cEugene\u201d), the Chief Executive Officer of BFI, informed Yu Jia Ru Derrick (\u201cDerrick\u201d), the Sales and Operations Director of V8, that he was distributing wood shredders through a separate company called Hammel (S) Pte Ltd (\u201cHammel\u201d). Eugene suggested that V8 purchase a shredder from Hammel to shred the waste wood that V8 collects from its customers into wood chips. This would make it easier for V8 to transport the wood chips and V8 could enjoy the lower price for disposal that applied to wood chips. Derrick agreed and purchased a shredder from Hammel through Eugene. The parties then agreed that V8 could continue to dispose of waste wood at the price of $40pmt, or dispose of wood chips at the price of $15pmt.', '6\\u2003Sometime in July 2013, the parties entered into negotiations for the appointment of BFI as V8\u2019s exclusive disposal service provider. The parties eventually entered into the Biomass Supply Agreement (\u201cBSA\u201d). Under the BSA, it was agreed that BFI would be V8\u2019s exclusive disposal service provider and that, in exchange, V8 would enjoy lower disposal fees, at $30pmt for waste wood and $13.50pmt for wood chips. It is unclear from the text of the BSA when the BSA was entered into. The Judge found the commencement date of the BSA to be 1 August 2013 (see the Judgment at [4]). This is not disputed on appeal.', '7\\u2003On 10 April 2015, V8 terminated the BSA alleging that BFI had repudiated the agreement through its conduct. On 14 May 2015, BFI commenced this suit against V8 for wrongful termination of the BSA and for non-payment of invoices. V8 maintained that it was entitled to terminate the BSA because BFI had renounced it. In its Defence, V8 pleaded that BFI had (a) wrongfully rejected V8\u2019s deliveries of waste wood and wood chips, and\/or (b) wrongfully and unilaterally raised the prices for its services under the BSA. In particular, V8 relied on four occasions when BFI had attempted to unilaterally increase prices and eight occasions when BFI had allegedly rejected delivery of waste wood and wood chips either because its premises were full, or because the wood chips were oversized in that they were more than 100mm in length (\u201cthe 100mm requirement\u201d).', '8\\u2003We do not propose to outline the 12 occasions of the alleged rejections and the attempts by BFI to increase prices. These were set out in chronological order by the Judge: see the Judgment at [35]\u2013[64]. We will only highlight two facts which are, in our view, germane to the two appeals before us: first, it is undisputed that after each alleged rejection of delivery, the deliveries would always resume thereafter; and second, it is undisputed that BFI issued credit notes to negate any price difference between the amounts charged to V8 and the amounts payable pursuant to the BSA, after V8 had protested the unilateral increase in prices by BFI. As a result, V8 never paid the higher prices that BFI attempted to impose.'"}
{"casename":"2018_SGCA_29","fact":"'5\\u2003We begin by setting out the relevant facts in so far as they bear upon the present applications to adduce further evidence on appeal.', '6\\u2003The present dispute arose out of a Sale and Purchase Agreement (\u201cthe SPA\u201d) dated 16 December 2013 that BNX and BOE entered into for the sale of a hotel in Singapore by BOE to BNX.', '7\\u2003BOE acquired a 99-year lease of a parcel of land by way of a grant from the Singapore Government on 17 November 2008. Pursuant to the head lease, BOE was to develop the land in accordance with plans approved by the competent authority under the Planning Act (Cap 232, 1998 Rev Ed), namely, the URA. Among other things, BOE had to ensure that at least 25% of the maximum permissible gross floor area (\u201cGFA\u201d) in the proposed development would be applied for use as a hotel, and at least 60% as office space. In accordance with the guidance provided in a circular issued by the URA on 2 September 2002, facilities within a development that did not fall within the core understanding of hotel use could nonetheless be included in the computation of the space deemed to have been set aside for hotel use as long as these were for the sole and exclusive use of guests and staff of the hotel.', '8\\u2003Construction of a mixed-use development at the said parcel of land acquired by BOE took place from late 2010 to October 2013 (\u201cthe Development\u201d). During this period, the URA imposed various use restrictions on the Development that mirrored those in the head lease by issuing grants of written permission specifying the restrictions.', '9\\u2003On 29 July 2009, the URA issued the first grant of written permission for the Development (\u201cthe 2009 GWP\u201d). On 22 October 2009, the URA raised concerns in a letter sent to BOE\u2019s project architects, [A], and suggested that BOE\u2019s plans for the Development failed to attribute the minimum 25% of the GFA for use as a hotel. These concerns stemmed from the fact that various parts of the Development appeared to be for facilities that would commonly be used by members of the public and hence could not be attributed as being for hotel use. At various times between 2009 and 2013, BOE engaged the URA in discussions as to what would be required to ensure that sufficient facilities in the Development could be attributed as being for hotel use. [A] played a significant role in BOE\u2019s discussions with the URA in this connection. [A] advised BOE as to how the URA\u2019s use restrictions could be understood as well as on the effect of the restrictions on who could operate or patronise the facilities in question, and communicated with the URA on BOE\u2019s behalf.', '10\\u2003On 20 July 2010, the URA informed BOE that the meeting rooms on the third floor of the Development could be attributed as being for hotel use only if BOE provided a letter of undertaking declaring that those spaces were not to be open for use by the public. The URA further required those spaces to be annotated in the plans to state that they would be \u201cfor hotel staff use only\u201d, and also intimated that it would subsequently impose a condition in its written permission to that effect. On 14 October 2010, BOE undertook to the URA in writing (\u201cthe October 2010 Undertaking\u201d) as follows:', '11\\u2003On 27 March 2013, following a request from the URA for clarification of BOE\u2019s intentions in respect of the use of the food and beverage facilities (also referred to as guest lounges) on the 32nd and 33rd floors and the executive lounge, spa, gym and meeting rooms on the 35th floor, BOE furnished the URA with another written undertaking (\u201cthe March 2013 Undertaking\u201d) as follows:', '12\\u2003On 10 May 2013, BOE gave the URA yet another written undertaking (\u201cthe May 2013 Undertaking\u201d) as follows:', '13\\u2003On 23 May 2013, the URA issued another grant of written permission in respect of the Development (\u201cthe May 2013 GWP\u201d). The May 2013 GWP granted BOE planning permission, subject to the condition that the facilities within the Development that were the subjects of the October 2010 Undertaking, the March 2013 Undertaking and the May 2013 Undertaking (specifically, the third floor meeting room, the 32nd and 33rd floor food and beverage facilities, and the 35th floor executive lounge, spa, gym and meeting rooms, henceforth referred to as \u201cthe Relevant Facilities\u201d) would be restricted for the exclusive use of hotel guests and staff, and would not be open to the public.', '14\\u2003In July 2013, BNX, which was looking to purchase a hotel in Singapore, approached BOE and inquired about purchasing the Development. BNX was keen to complete the acquisition of any property before the end of 2013 so as to enjoy a tax benefit worth about US$40m in the country of origin of its parent holding company.', '15\\u2003On 2 September 2013, the Temporary Occupation Permit (\u201cTOP\u201d) was issued for the Development. This signified that the Building and Construction Authority accepted that the Development was in compliance with the URA\u2019s requirements in relation to the various uses of the GFA.', '16\\u2003On 20 September 2013, BNX wrote to BOE offering to purchase the Development for S$475m.', '17\\u2003It is common ground that BOE was to arrange for access to all relevant materials to be provided to BNX as soon as practicable in order to enable BNX and its consultants to undertake their due diligence review prior to completing the purchase of the Development. As part of the due diligence process, BOE established a \u201cvirtual data room\u201d, which was a database containing soft copies of all the key documents relevant to the Development. BOE also set up a \u201cphysical data room\u201d, which was a room containing all the drawings and correspondence relating to the Development accumulated from the start of the project. This included about 30 large lever-arch files containing all the correspondence between BOE and the various authorities in Singapore, with six of these files containing BOE\u2019s and [A]\u2019s correspondence with the URA in particular. Notably, the October 2010 Undertaking and the March 2013 Undertaking could be found in the physical data room, but not in the virtual data room. As for the May 2013 Undertaking, it was not included in either the physical data room or the virtual data room.', '18\\u2003On 7 October 2013, BOE informed BNX that the relevant information for the purpose of due diligence had been prepared and could be accessed in the virtual data room. BOE provided BNX with the details required to gain access to the virtual data room and the list of categories of the documents that were there.', '19\\u2003On 10 October 2013, the URA issued to [A] (on behalf of BOE) a final grant of written permission (\u201cthe October 2013 GWP\u201d) in respect of the Development. The October 2013 GWP referred to planning conditions stipulated in the approved plans at that time, which in turn specifically identified drawings that disclosed the use restrictions for the Relevant Facilities in the Development. BOE included the October 2013 GWP in the virtual data room.', '20\\u2003On 21 October 2013, BOE agreed to sell the Development to BNX, and on 25 October 2013, it signed its acceptance of the offer letter from BNX dated 20 September 2013. The agreement that was concluded at this stage was subject to conditions, including the satisfactory completion of the due diligence process.', '21\\u2003As it transpired, BNX did not make any due diligence enquiries in relation to the material in the virtual data room until 4 November 2013, which was about a month after the material had first been made available. On or about that date, BNX submitted a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet setting out a number of queries with separate columns showing: (a) the location within the disclosed materials of any document in relation to which the query or request related, (b) the nature of the information sought, (c) the importance of the query, and (d) a blank column for BOE to provide its response. The spreadsheet was updated on an ongoing basis to incorporate any further information required or requests or queries emanating from BNX. After the initial round of queries submitted on 4 November 2013, there were four further rounds of queries submitted on 14, 22 and 29 November, and 2 December 2013.', '22\\u2003On 28 November 2013, WongPartnership LLP (\u201cWongPartnership\u201d), whom BNX had retained as solicitors for the purposes of this sale, wrote to BNX to draw its attention to two subfolders uploaded into the virtual data room and, in particular, the letters sent from URA on 22 October 2009 (in which the URA had raised concerns as to compliance with the GFA requirements in the head grant of the Development), and 20 July 2010 (in which the URA had specifically raised the need for BOE to provide a letter of undertaking to the effect that facilities on the third floor of the Development were not to be leased out for public use) (see [9] and [10] above).', '23\\u2003In a telephone conference between WongPartnership and BNX on 29 November 2013, WongPartnership advised BNX that the Development could not be occupied unless the issue regarding the fulfilment of the GFA requirements for the Development was resolved to the satisfaction of the URA. On the same day at 4.30pm, BNX requested from BOE details of any follow-up, including related correspondence between the URA and [A], regarding the issues raised by the URA in its letters sent on 22 October 2009 and 20 July 2010. At 6.23pm on the same day, BOE replied, stating that the issues raised in that letter had been resolved by the issuance of the TOP. Following this, WongPartnership referred the matter to EC Harris (a firm of consultants that BNX had hired to assist with the due diligence process) and specifically requested EC Harris to confirm with BNX that the GFA requirement prescribed by the authorities had been fulfilled and regularised.', '24\\u2003Separately, a representative from EC Harris visited the physical data room from 5 to 7 November 2013 to review the drawings and documentation stored there. He was assisted by a representative of BOE who was familiar with the documents and remained on hand to assist him in finding anything that he might need.', '25\\u2003On 11 November 2013, the hotel commenced operations.', '26\\u2003On 2 December 2013, BNX sought a copy of the October 2013 GWP. This was duly provided on 3 December 2013.', '27\\u2003Also on 2 December 2013, EC Harris informed BNX that in the light of the issuance of the TOP, it believed that the appropriate measures had been taken, but that BNX should nonetheless seek a legal opinion from its own legal counsel on whether the Development had any outstanding issues in relation to planning approvals. EC Harris also advised WongPartnership that it would be a good idea for it to check with [A] and BOE to satisfy itself that the issues raised in 2009 had been resolved. It is not clear whether or how WongPartnership specifically acted on that advice. It did send a copy of the October 2013 GWP to BNX, which, as noted above, referred to the planning conditions stipulated in the approved plans at that time, which in turn specifically identified drawings that disclosed the use restrictions for the Relevant Facilities in the Development; and it also informed BNX that the URA had confirmed that the issues raised in the 22 October 2009 letter had been resolved by the various grants of written permission issued thereafter.', '28\\u2003Further, on 11 December 2013, when WongPartnership produced its legal due diligence report, among other things, it concluded that BNX should instruct its consultants to review the various grants of written permission that had been issued together with the accompanying permits, permissions and drawings. BNX did not follow up on that advice.', '29\\u2003On 16 December 2013, BNX and BOE signed the SPA. On 19 February 2014, BNX and BOE entered into a lease agreement, which was to run until the day immediately before BOE\u2019s head grant would expire. The lease agreement, which was registered on 2 April 2014, was granted by BOE to BNX in order to effect the sale of the Development.', '30\\u2003Despite the use restrictions, from the commencement of hotel operations in November 2013 until July 2014, members of the public were permitted to patronise the Relevant Facilities. However, in July 2014, BNX first became aware that the URA had restricted the use of the Relevant Facilities to guests and staff of the hotel. BNX accused BOE of wrongfully failing to disclose the use restrictions during the negotiations for the SPA. BOE rejected this allegation. This eventually led to the present dispute.', '31\\u2003On 29 October 2014, BNX commenced arbitration proceedings against BOE by filing a Request for Arbitration with the Secretariat of the International Court of Arbitration of the ICC. This was pursuant to cl 33.2 of the SPA, which provides for disputes under the SPA to be resolved by arbitration in Singapore under the Rules of Arbitration of the ICC. The AA (and not the International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe IAA\u201d)) applied to govern the arbitration proceedings pursuant to s 3 of the AA, given that the arbitration was seated in Singapore and was not an international arbitration within the meaning of s 5(2) of the IAA, such that Part II of the IAA did not apply.', '32\\u2003In the Statement of Case filed by BNX on 3 June 2015, the following claims were raised against BOE:', '(a)\\u2003A primary claim for fraudulent misrepresentation, alleging that BOE had fraudulently misrepresented to BNX that members of the public would be permitted to patronise the Relevant Facilities, and that the Relevant Facilities could therefore generate an independent revenue stream for the business after BNX acquired it. BNX contended on this basis that it was entitled to rescind the SPA, and obtain a refund of the price and an award of damages.', '(b)\\u2003An ancillary claim for breach of contract, alleging that because BNX could not permit members of the public to patronise the Relevant Facilities, BOE was in breach of certain warranties under the SPA. BNX thus submitted that it should receive damages as compensation for the diminution in the value of the business by reason of losing the stream of revenue which it had expected would flow from its being able to open the Relevant Facilities to members of the public.', '(c)\\u2003Alternative claims for breach of an alleged collateral contract, unjust enrichment, constructive trust and non-fraudulent misrepresentation.', '33\\u2003We pause to make an observation, to which we shall return. The case mounted by BNX rested on its belief at the material time that there were no applicable use restrictions as far as the Relevant Facilities were concerned. Hence, it had anticipated that these could be used to generate an independent stream of revenue. BNX further contended that this was so as a result of a representation or warranty to this effect made or given by BOE.', '34\\u2003By 19 March 2015, the arbitral tribunal (\u201cthe Tribunal\u201d) was duly constituted.', '35\\u2003Pursuant to Procedural Order No 1 issued by the Tribunal on 17 April 2015, the parties agreed, among other things, that the conduct of the arbitration would be governed by the International Bar Association\u2019s Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Commercial Arbitration (\u201cthe IBA Rules\u201d).', '36\\u2003On 29 July 2015, BOE filed and served on BNX its Statement of Defence, as well as its witness statements accompanied by the relevant factual exhibits and legal materials.', '37\\u2003On 19 August 2015, each party delivered to the other a request for the production of documents in the form of a Redfern Schedule. BNX made 12 separate document requests in relation to correspondence between the URA, [A] and BOE, and for internal communications within BOE on planning approval, GFA calculations, the use restrictions, and the written permissions. BOE objected to all of these requests, ostensibly on the ground that these did not meet the requirement stipulated in Art 3(3)(a)(ii) of the IBA Rules that such requests concern a \u201cnarrow and specific category\u201d of documents that were \u201creasonably believed to exist\u201d. Nonetheless, BOE offered to disclose all hard copy correspondence in its possession between [A] and the URA pertaining to the use restrictions. This included the October 2010 Undertaking and the March 2013 Undertaking, both of which had been available in the physical data room during the due diligence process before the parties had entered into the SPA. Notably, this offer to disclose did not include the May 2013 Undertaking. It was suggested that this was the case because the May 2013 Undertaking had somehow been inadvertently omitted from both the physical data room and the virtual data room during the due diligence process preceding the signing of the SPA (see [17] above).', '38\\u2003On 10 September 2015, the Tribunal issued its ruling in respect of the various requests for the production of documents. The Tribunal rejected all of BNX\u2019s requests relating to the planning approval, GFA calculations, use restrictions and written permissions, finding that these requests did not satisfy the requirements under the IBA Rules because the categories of documents sought were too wide and inadequately specified. Instead, the Tribunal only made disclosure orders relating to the fraudulent misrepresentations alleged by BNX in its Statement of Case. These were restricted to documents that were relevant and material to showing the states of mind of the alleged representors identified in BNX\u2019s pleadings. The Tribunal also acknowledged BOE\u2019s offer of voluntary disclosure and observed that no order was required in respect of the hard copy files that had been voluntarily made available by BOE. Subsequently, in late September 2015, BNX\u2019s counsel attended BOE\u2019s offices to review the hard copy files that BOE had voluntarily offered to disclose, and made copies of these.', '39\\u2003There followed the filing of further pleadings and further document requests. On 20 November 2015, BOE served its Statement of Rejoinder, supplemental factual witness statements, supplementary supporting materials, and supplemental expert reports.', '40\\u2003On 27 November, 2 December, and 4 December 2015, BNX sent letters to BOE, requesting the disclosure of various documents following BNX\u2019s inspection of the materials served by BOE on 20 November 2015. In particular, in the letter sent on 4 December 2015, BNX made the following requests:', '41\\u2003BOE responded to BNX on 2 and 8 December 2015, declining to produce any of the further documents requested by BNX on the ground that the requests were untimely, irrelevant and immaterial to the issues in dispute. In particular, BOE stated in its letter dated 8 December 2015 that:', '42\\u2003On 7 December 2015, BNX made an application to the Tribunal for an order for BOE to produce the documents referred to at [40] above. BOE responded on 8 December 2015, maintaining its position that further disclosure was unwarranted as BNX\u2019s latest documents requests were untimely, and irrelevant and immaterial to the issues in dispute. On 9 December 2015, the Tribunal dismissed BNX\u2019s application for further document disclosure on the grounds that these requests: (a) overlapped significantly with the documents sought in BNX\u2019s original requests reflected in its Redfern Schedule, which had earlier been rejected by the Tribunal; (b) related to documents that went towards showing that a particular representative of BOE who was different from the two representatives referred to in BNX\u2019s pleadings had misled BNX about the use restrictions at the Development, which was not a part of BNX\u2019s case in the first place; and (c) were too wide, and BNX had failed to show how the documents requested were relevant or material.', '43\\u2003We return to a point we alluded to at [33] above. BNX\u2019s case was that BOE had always represented that there were no relevant use restrictions at all. Hence, its claim rested on the fact that the discovery of the existence of any use restrictions came as an unexpected surprise contrary to the alleged representations. BNX\u2019s case was not that BOE had misled it as to the scope of the restrictions since its essential case was that it had been led to believe that there were no restrictions. As against this, BOE maintained that from the October 2013 GWP as well as the two undertakings that were disclosed in the virtual data room, it was evident that there were use restrictions in place and further, at the material time, BNX was in fact alive to this fact as well as the need to ascertain just what these were.', '44\\u2003The oral hearings for the arbitration took place between 26 January and 4 February 2016. During the oral hearings, BNX maintained its primary claim in fraudulent misrepresentation and its ancillary claim in breach of contract. However, it dropped its alternative claims founded upon the breach of an alleged collateral contract, unjust enrichment, constructive trust and non-fraudulent misrepresentation. In its written closing submissions at the very end of the hearing, BNX mounted an alternative claim in fraud for the first time. Specifically, BNX alleged that BOE had perpetrated a fraud against the URA and the Singapore Government by making a conscious decision to breach the use restrictions, and the October 2010 Undertaking and the March 2013 Undertaking given to the URA in its operation of the Development, such that the SPA should be rendered a nullity. We mention here that BNX evidently remained unaware of the May 2013 Undertaking throughout the course of the hearing.', '45\\u2003The Tribunal issued the Award on 1 June 2016, dismissing all of BNX\u2019s claims. Its key findings may be summarised as follows:', '(a)\\u2003Regarding the claim for fraudulent misrepresentation, the Tribunal found, amongst other things, that BOE made none of the representations alleged by BNX; that in any case, there was no reliance by BNX which had never given conscious thought to the issue of public access to the Relevant Facilities; that further, BNX could easily have found out about the use restrictions from the due diligence process; and that BOE had not been dishonest since it had no specific duty of disclosure that had been breached.', '(b)\\u2003In relation to the claim for breach of warranty, the Tribunal found that BOE\u2019s failure to observe the use restrictions, while in breach of the head grant from the Singapore Government, did not constitute a breach of the terms of the sale or render the sale unlawful.', '(c)\\u2003As for the claim that BOE had defrauded the URA and the Singapore Government, the Tribunal found that BOE\u2019s representatives had honestly, even if mistakenly, believed at the material time that a more generous interpretation of the use restrictions was permissible, and that BOE had always relied on advice from [A] regarding the effect of the use restrictions.', '46\\u2003Having had its claims dismissed in their entirety by the Tribunal, BNX proceeded to take a series of steps either to challenge the Award directly or to gather additional evidence in aid of its intended challenges against the Award. Initially, BNX did the following:', '(a)\\u2003On 14 July 2016, BNX commenced Originating Summons No 651 of 2016 (\u201cOS 651\u201d), seeking leave to appeal against the Award on purported questions of law under s 49 of the AA. On 13 September 2016, this was dismissed by an assistant registrar on the ground that BNX had contracted out of its rights of appeal under s 49 of the AA when it agreed to an ICC arbitration clause in the SPA. BNX appealed to a High Court judge in chambers, but this too was dismissed on 14 November 2016.', '(b)\\u2003On 21 July 2016, BNX commenced Originating Summons No 735 of 2016 (\u201cOS 735\u201d), seeking leave to serve pre-action interrogatories on [A]. Neither party had led any evidence from any witness from [A] in the arbitration. The interrogatories were directed at the advice given by [A] to BOE on the use restrictions, and referred directly to the written and oral evidence of BOE\u2019s witnesses during the arbitration, which was in breach of BNX\u2019s confidentiality obligations pursuant to the arbitration. On discovering this, BOE applied successfully to intervene in OS 735, and on the basis of its submissions, the Judge dismissed those proceedings.', '47\\u2003Then, on 30 August 2016, BNX commenced OS 871, seeking to set aside the Award pursuant to s 48 of the AA on the grounds that: (a) the Tribunal had exceeded its jurisdiction by deciding matters that were not before it; (b) there was a breach of natural justice which deprived it of a fair hearing; and (c) the Award was contrary to public policy. The Judge dismissed OS 871 on 8 March 2017 and CA 61 is an appeal against this.', '48\\u2003Regarding the first ground of challenge, BNX claimed that the Tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction by making findings on the meaning of the use restrictions and the URA\u2019s policy in respect of them, as well as on the advice given to BOE on the effect of the use restrictions by [A]. The Judge rejected this and found that the Tribunal did not in fact make any such findings but instead had proceeded on assumptions as to these matters that were all in BNX\u2019s favour (GD at [60]\u2013[68]). As to [A]\u2019s advice on the use restrictions, the Judge found that the Tribunal had only addressed this in the context of determining the subjective state of mind of BOE\u2019s representatives. This was well within the scope of the arbitration and BNX was or ought reasonably to have been aware that the subjective belief of BOE\u2019s representations, based on the advice they had received from [A], was a live issue before the Tribunal (GD at [69]\u2013[71]).', '49\\u2003In relation to the second ground of challenge, BNX contended that the Award was made in breach of natural justice in so far as the Tribunal found that [A]\u2019s advice on the use restrictions and the URA policy was correct, because: (a) BNX had no notice that the URA\u2019s policy would be an issue in the arbitration, and hence was not given an opportunity to be heard on it; and (b) the Tribunal had wrongly admitted hearsay evidence on [A]\u2019s advice and BNX had wrongly been denied an opportunity to cross-examine [A]\u2019s representatives. The Judge rejected this. First, he found that the Tribunal did not make any finding on the URA policy, but had accepted that the evidence given by BOE\u2019s representatives in respect of [A]\u2019s advice was honest and should be accepted even though the Tribunal assumed that such advice was wrong (GD at [77]\u2013[78]). Secondly, there was no breach of the hearsay rule because it did not apply to arbitration (GD at [79]), and even if it did, it was not engaged here because the evidence went solely to the state of mind of BOE\u2019s representatives (GD at [86]\u2013[92]). BOE\u2019s representatives were perfectly competent to testify as to the advice they received and the effect this had on them.', '50\\u2003As for the third ground of challenge, BNX claimed that the Award was contrary to public policy because: (a) the Tribunal had relied on hearsay evidence, which was against basic notions of justice; (b) the Tribunal\u2019s alleged finding on the meaning of the use restrictions and the URA policy was in violation of morality and justice; and (c) the Tribunal erred in finding that the SPA was not void for illegality as a sale of an unlawful business. The Judge rejected this too. First, the Judge found that the Tribunal did not rely on hearsay evidence, and that even if it did, there was no breach of public policy in its doing so (GD at [100]\u2013[101]). Secondly, the Judge found that the Tribunal had not made findings on the meaning of the use restrictions or URA policy, but had considered those issues only in the context of BOE\u2019s representatives\u2019 subjective understanding of them (GD at [102]\u2013[104]). Thirdly, the Judge found that the SPA was not illegal because there was nothing requiring BNX to continue operating the hotel in a manner that breached the use restrictions (GD at [108]\u2013[110]).', '51\\u2003In the meantime on 17 October 2016, BNX commenced Suit 1097, seeking to rescind the lease agreement that BOE had granted BNX in order to effect the sale of the Development. We have touched on this lease agreement at [29] above. BNX relied on substantially the same allegations of fraudulent misrepresentation as those it had relied on in the arbitration in its attempt to rescind the SPA, but claimed that the lease and the SPA were distinct agreements, and that the arbitration had dealt only with the parties\u2019 rights under the SPA and not the lease.', '52\\u2003On 1 November 2016, BOE filed SUM 5305 to strike out Suit 1097 on the basis that the claims advanced there were: (a) precluded by the doctrine of res judicata or were an abuse of process; and (b) legally unsustainable in any event. On 8 March 2017, the Judge granted BOE\u2019s application and struck out BNX\u2019s claims in Suit 1097 because the lease bore a true and subordinate relationship to the SPA. Suit 1097 was thus a collateral attack on the Award and an abuse of process, and was in any event legally unsustainable (GD at [137] and [152]). The Judge rejected the notion that the lease agreement and the SPA were independent agreements that conferred rights and obligations that were independent of each other (GD at [134]\u2013[136]). The Judge also dismissed all the other subsidiary points taken by BNX. CA 62 is the appeal brought by BNX against this decision.', '53\\u2003Finally, on 29 June 2017, BNX commenced Suit No 585 of 2017 (\u201cSuit 585\u201d) against [A], which was a claim in negligence. BNX claimed that [A], as BOE\u2019s architect, had been negligent and breached its duty of care to BNX, a buyer of the Development, to advise BOE with reasonable care and skill. BNX claimed that such a duty of care arose because [A] knew or ought to have known that its advice to BOE would be made available to a prospective buyer of the Development (namely BNX), who would rely on it in entering into a sale transaction (in this case, the SPA). [A] filed its defence in the suit on 24 July 2017, and subsequently amended it on 22 August 2017.', '54\\u2003In its defence filed in Suit 585, [A] made references to various documents recording correspondence in May 2013 between BOE, [A] and\/or the URA, as well as to the May 2013 Undertaking (\u201cthe May 2013 Documents\u201d), as follows:', 'BNX claims that it only came to know about the existence of the May 2013 Documents following the aforementioned references made in [A]\u2019s defence in Suit 585. [A] has since applied to strike out Suit 585.'"}

The freight market plummeted. This severely affected the Chartering Business of Parakou.', '8\\u2003On 30 October 2008, Parakou received an email warning it to \u201cpay sharp attention to the financial condition\u201d of Ocean Glory, which had re-delivered a vessel that it had chartered from another entity \u201cearlier than the minimum period with extremely short notice\u201d.', '9\\u2003On 31 October 2008, Parakou received the original copies of the charterparty for the Canton Trader from Galsworthy. However, Parakou never signed the charterparty. Galsworthy eventually brought and succeeded in an action against Parakou in respect of this charterparty (\u201cthe Galsworthy Claim\u201d).', '10\\u2003Thereafter, Parakou engaged in the conduct that forms the subject matter of these proceedings, which conduct we broadly categorise as \u201cthe Disputed Transactions\u201d and \u201cthe Legal Proceedings\u201d.', '11\\u2003In November 2008, Parakou sold 10 vessels and two uncompleted hulls (collectively, \u201cthe OPL Vessels\u201d) to Parakou Investment Holdings Pte Ltd (\u201cPIH\u201d). At all material times, C C Liu, Chik, and Liu Por were directors and shareholders of PIH, with C C Liu holding 70% of the shares in PIH.', '12\\u2003With effect from 30 November 2008, Parakou terminated 12 ship management agreements (\u201cSMAs\u201d) that it had entered into with 12 companies (\u201cthe 12 Pretty Entities\u201d). The 12 Pretty Entities were controlled by C C Liu, Chik, Liu Por, and another son of C C Liu. Thereafter, the 12 Pretty Entities entered into contracts on substantially the same terms with Parakou Shipmanagement Pte Ltd (\u201cPSMPL\u201d). PSMPL had been incorporated on 18 November 2008 to take over the OPL Business and Ship Management Business of Parakou. The parties do not dispute that these acts effected a \u201ctransfer\u201d of the SMAs from Parakou to PSMPL.', '13\\u2003Between 12 and 24 November 2008, Parakou repaid debts of S$9,812,543 that it had owed to PIH (\u201cthe PIH Repayments\u201d). These payments were approved by Liu Por and Yang.', '14\\u2003On 5 December 2008, Parakou repaid debts of S$3,046,200 to Parakou Shipping SA (\u201cthe PSSA Repayment\u201d). Parakou Shipping SA was wholly owned by C C Liu, and controlled by C C Liu as well as Chik. This payment was approved by Yang.', '15\\u2003On 9 and 15 December 2008, Parakou set off a total of S$1,732,239 of debts that PIH owed to it in respect of the purchase of the OPL Vessels against debts that it owed to PIH for charter hire (\u201cthe PIH Set-Off\u201d). This set-off was approved by Liu Por and Yang.', '16\\u2003On 12 December 2008, Parakou paid a total of S$267,128 in bonuses to all four of the Directors (\u201cthe Bonus Payments\u201d). Around the same time, Parakou increased the monthly salaries of Liu Por and Yang by S$2,000 each with effect from 1 January 2009 (\u201cthe Salary Increases\u201d). Pursuant to these increases, Liu Por and Yang received a total of S$108,000 between January 2009 and March 2011.', '17\\u2003On 22 December 2008, C C Liu and Chik transferred their shares in Parakou to Liu Por and Yang, and appointed them as directors in Parakou.

This decision was effected by way of a board resolution signed by Liu Por and Yang (\u201cthe 23 December 2008 Resolution\u201d). These 39 employees were subsequently hired by PSMPL in January 2009. Nevertheless, Parakou continued to pay the salaries of six of these employees from January 2009 to December 2010.

Galsworthy then commenced arbitration proceedings against Parakou in London (\u201cthe London Arbitration\u201d). In response, Parakou commenced court proceedings in Hong Kong against the owners and\/or demise charterers of the Jin Kang (formerly, the Canton Trader) for an indemnity in respect of any liabilities that it might incur in the London Arbitration (\u201cthe HK Court Proceedings\u201d).', '21\\u2003During the London Arbitration, Liu Por and Yang admitted that if a valid charterparty did in fact exist between Parakou and Galsworthy, Parakou would be liable for damages of at least US$2,670,000.

The Deceased was pronounced dead by the paramedics at about 5pm.', '11\\u2003In October 2015, the Respondent attended at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital with complaints of headache and eye pain. He was treated with anti-glaucoma and anti-inflammatory medications and laser treatment was performed on him. In January 2016, the Respondent underwent surgery to remove a cataract in his right eye. Over time, the Respondent began to associate various other ailments like constipation, weakness of the knees, insomnia and weight loss with his surgery or his food intake. Although the Respondent sought medical attention for these ailments, he refused to consume the prescribed medication or to heed his doctor\u2019s advice. For instance, he refused to consume laxatives to relieve his constipation as he believed that the laxatives were poisonous. The Respondent also believed that the Deceased and Yanni were trying to \u201ctorture\u201d him by making him drink prune juice to relieve his constipation.', '12\\u2003On Saturday, 12 March 2016, the Deceased, Annie and Yanni accompanied the Respondent to a clinic to collect his health check-up report. Although the report was not adverse, the Respondent continued to be worried about his health and felt that either someone was trying to harm him or he was suffering from some illness and was going to die.', '13\\u2003Annie suggested that the Respondent and the Deceased spend that night at her home as she felt that a change of environment might do the Respondent some good. The Respondent and the Deceased agreed.', '14\\u2003While at Annie\u2019s home, the Respondent appeared troubled. He told Annie that she must take care of Yanni if he was not around. He also told Annie that he did not think she was his daughter. Annie asked the Respondent if he would abandon her if she was not his daughter and he assured her that he would not. The Respondent told Annie that he did not want her to go for DNA testing to verify if she was his daughter. Nothing else of significance happened that night.', '15\\u2003On Sunday, 13 March 2016, Annie took the Respondent and the Deceased to her place of worship, Trinity Christian Church. While they were taking the lift in the church, the Respondent made some incomprehensible noises ending with \u201cmad already!\u201d. The Respondent kept quiet after that.', '16\\u2003Later, when Annie accompanied the Respondent to a toilet in the church, they met one Pastor Alana. The Respondent suddenly said something to the effect of \u201cGod wanted me to return daughter to the rightful parent\u201d. During the sermon, the Respondent told a stranger sitting beside him that people were poisoning him.', '17\\u2003After the church service, Annie drove the Respondent and the Deceased back to the Flat. The Respondent said that he was tired and went to his bedroom to take a nap. The Deceased remained in the living room. Annie stayed for a while to chat with the Deceased before leaving the Flat at about 3pm to pick up Yanni.', '18\\u2003The Respondent claimed that after Annie left the Flat, he heard some roaring sounds around his ears which woke him up from his nap. He walked to the kitchen and got a knife from the sink. He then walked out of the kitchen and saw the Deceased folding some clothes in the living room. He stabbed her from the back. The Respondent then moved in front of the Deceased where he continued to stab her repeatedly.', '19\\u2003The Deceased struggled and the Respondent dropped the knife. The Respondent then proceeded to the kitchen to get a chopper, returned to the living room and used the chopper to continue his attack on the Deceased. The Respondent stopped hacking the Deceased with the chopper only when he realised that she was dead.', '20\\u2003After he realised that the Deceased was dead, the Respondent rested on the sofa for a while before he called Yanni. Yanni was with Annie at the time and she missed the Respondent\u2019s phone call. The Respondent then called his younger sister, Joanna Kong (\u201cJoanna\u201d), and told her that he had killed his wife. The Respondent told Joanna to call the police and to distribute his money to his two daughters. After the Respondent hung up, Joanna called Annie and instructed her to call the police and to wait for the police to arrive before going up to the Flat.', '21\\u2003At around this time, Yanni realised that she had missed the Respondent\u2019s phone call. When she called him back, the first thing her father said was, \u201cI killed mommy.\u201d Yanni told him not to talk nonsense and the Respondent replied, \u201cAlready killed.\u201d Yanni continued engaging him in conversation over the phone while Annie drove them back to the Flat. Annie also called the police in the meantime (see the First Information Report at [9] above).', '22\\u2003At about 4.45pm, Annie and Yanni arrived at the void deck of the Flat. The police arrived shortly thereafter. The two sisters went up to the Flat with the police. When Yanni opened the door, she saw the Respondent sitting on the sofa in the living room in blood-stained clothes and the Deceased lying motionless in a pool of blood on the floor next to the sofa. The Respondent appeared dazed and was quiet. A blood-stained chopper measuring 30cm long (with the blade measuring 19.5cm long and 8.5cm at its widest part) was seen near the Deceased\u2019s left foot, while a blood-stained knife measuring 32.8cm long (with the blade measuring 20.8cm long and 3.8cm at its widest part) was seen near the Deceased\u2019s body under the coffee table. The chopper and the knife were seized by the police subsequently.', '23\\u2003At about 4.58pm, the paramedics arrived at the scene and the Deceased was pronounced dead at about 5pm.', '24\\u2003Following his arrest, the Respondent was examined medically. He was noted to have (among other injuries) minor scratches and abrasions over his face, chest, right elbow, knees and back, as well as a laceration on his right ring finger which required stitching.', '25\\u2003At about 9.25pm that day, Associate Consultant Forensic Pathologist Dr Chan Shijia arrived at the Flat and examined the Deceased\u2019s body. She observed that the Deceased was lying on the left lateral position in a diagonal direction facing between the TV console and the main door. She was lying in a pool of blood which was densest around her head. Near her body, under the coffee table, was a kitchen knife with a brown handle and there was a chopper near the foot of the Deceased. In addition to the large amount of blood on the floor where the Deceased was lying, there were blood spatters on the living room wall behind the TV console and on the perpendicular living room wall with a window (behind the Deceased). There was no apparent blood spatter on the curtains. There were blood-stained footprints (in both directions) between the living room and the kitchen.', '26\\u2003The next day, 14 March 2016, Dr Chan performed an autopsy on the Deceased in the mortuary at the Health Sciences Authority. She subsequently produced an autopsy report in which she certified the cause of death to be \u201c(IA) HAEMORRHAGE DUE TO (IB) MULTIPLE INCISED WOUNDS TO HEAD\u201d. A total of 189 injuries were noted in the autopsy report, the most severe of which were concentrated around the Deceased\u2019s head and neck region. A large number of incised wounds were on the Deceased\u2019s head. Some of these resulted in facial fractures. There were five incised wounds on the neck which were superficial in nature. Eight stab wounds were also noted on the Deceased\u2019s head, chest, back and left thigh. These too were generally superficial in nature. There was also extensive bruising all over the Deceased\u2019s body which was the result of blunt force trauma.', '27\\u2003Dr Chan was of the opinion that \u201c[d]eath was due to haemorrhage from the multiple incised wounds to the head, including the face and scalp\u201d. While the incised wounds and stab wounds may have been superficial in nature, massive haemorrhage could result from the overall effect of the multiple scalp and facial injuries, which could result in death. This was evident from the large amount of blood found at the scene, as well as the autopsy findings of a body with marked pallor and lack of discernible hypostasis.', '28\\u2003Dr Chan also noted that there was no evidence of an underlying medical condition which could have contributed to the Deceased\u2019s death. No alcohols, volatiles or drugs were detected in the Deceased\u2019s blood or urine.', '29\\u2003In his statements to the police, the Respondent admitted that he killed the Deceased. He claimed that he believed his family would not look after him if he were unwell and that Annie had reconciled with her \u201creal\u201d parents and disliked him. He believed that he should kill the Deceased first because his family might want to kill him.', '30\\u2003On the day of the offence, the Respondent was awakened by \u201croaring\u201d sounds around his ears. His mind told him to let Annie leave the house first so that he could kill the Deceased when she was alone. After getting a knife from the kitchen, he approached the Deceased from the back and stabbed her multiple times. She fell to the floor and they struggled. He then went to the kitchen, got a chopper and attacked her further while she lay on the floor. His mind told him to \u201cmake sure she die\u201d. After he realised that she was dead, he was \u201chappy\u201d and stopped attacking her. He then called Yanni to tell her what he had done and wrote a statement on a piece of paper to set out how his property and savings should be distributed.', '31\\u2003Following his arrest on the day of the offence, the Respondent was admitted to Changi General Hospital. On admission, the Respondent was perplexed, disorientated and agitated, banged his head about 44 times and said he had heard voices. 1', 'Over the course of admission, he said repeatedly that he wanted to die. On 15 March 2016, the Respondent was remanded in Changi Prison Complex Medical Centre for psychiatric evaluation.', '32\\u2003The Respondent was assessed by Dr Kenneth Koh (\u201cDr Koh\u201d), a psychiatrist and senior consultant with the IMH. Dr Koh issued four reports dated 11 April 2016 (\u201cthe First Report\u201d) 2', ', 6 December 2016 (\u201cthe Second Report\u201d) 3', ', 9 May 2017 (\u201cthe Third Report\u201d) 4', 'and 3 January 2018 (\u201cthe Fourth Report\u201d) 5', '. The Fourth Report was issued after the High Court\u2019s decision of 16 October 2017 and before the appeal was heard by the Court of Appeal. A further report dated 8 February 2018 (\u201cthe Fifth Report\u201d) was prepared by Dr Koh after the hearing of this appeal because it was requested by the Court of Appeal during the hearing. We set out the Fifth Report at [51] below.', '33\\u2003Dr Koh issued the First Report after examining the Respondent on four occasions. The Respondent said he had never previously consulted a psychiatrist, had no history of suicidal or violent behaviour and had never hit his late wife before the incident stated in the charge. He also told Dr Koh that he had a good relationship with the Deceased until about three months before the incident when he began to suspect that she had been unfaithful in the distant past and that Annie was not his daughter. The Deceased gave him conflicting answers when he asked her about it. The Respondent said that after the blow-up with the Deceased over these suspicions, matters settled somewhat, although he continued to be disturbed by such thoughts occasionally. The First Report also stated that the Respondent said he did not know why he stabbed the Deceased, despite the question having been posed to him many times in different ways.', '34\\u2003According to the Respondent\u2019s sister Joanna, when Annie was about five years old, the Respondent told her he suspected that the Deceased had had an affair but he did not raise it again thereafter. Joanna, Annie and Yanni said that the Respondent and the Deceased had a normal marital relationship without any past violence. However, after the eye operation in October 2015, the Respondent became inordinately preoccupied with his physical health and began consulting many doctors. He said that his wife and Yanni were harming him. Once, he also claimed that one of the doctors in a polyclinic was in cahoots with the Deceased to harm him.', '35\\u2003The First Report also recorded that the Respondent had nihilistic\/somatic delusions. For example, he said that while giving his statement to the police, he had put his thumbprint on a document consenting for his organs to be taken away. He believed that his left eye had been taken out and donated and that his internal organs and intestines had been \u201crobbed and donated already\u201d to other people. He suspected this because he had been having constipation in the past few months.', '36\\u2003Dr Koh concluded the First Report with the following opinion:', '37\\u2003In the Second Report, Dr Koh gave the following clarification:', 'Section 300 of the Penal Code sets out the offence of murder. Exception 7 to that section, commonly known as the defence of diminished responsibility, states:', '38\\u2003Dr Koh provided an updated assessment of the Respondent in the Third Report after examining the Respondent in Changi Prison on 4 May 2017 and perusing the prison\u2019s psychiatric notes. After reiterating his conclusions in the First Report, Dr Koh stated:', '39\\u2003Dr Koh was present at the hearing before the High Court trial Judge (\u201cthe Judge\u201d). The Judge recited the portion of the Third Report stating that the Respondent had a brief psychotic episode but had responded well to medication, entered into remission for several months and posed a low risk of dangerousness to others. He then asked Dr Koh whether his opinion remained true as at the date of the hearing (16 October 2017). Dr Koh confirmed that, based on recent medical notes from the prison psychiatrist, the Respondent was still in a state of remission and it appeared that his mental state had not changed significantly since the Third Report. 6', '40\\u2003The Prosecution obtained the Fourth Report from Dr Koh after the Judge sentenced the Respondent and about three weeks before we heard the appeal. There, Dr Koh stated:', '41\\u2003After reproducing the penultimate paragraph of the Third Report (see [38] above) stating the Respondent\u2019s low risk of dangerousness to others, Dr Koh concluded the Fourth Report with the following remarks:'"}
{"casename":"2018_SGCA_32","fact":"facts to those of the present case.  \nFor instance, in Public Prosecutor v Selvaraju  Jayaselvam (Criminal Case \nNo 14 of 2009, unreported),  the accused was a 26-year old male and the victim  \nwas an eight-year-old boy. The accused  had been  dispatched  to perform repair \n2\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Chua  Hock  Leong [2018]  SGCA  32\nworks at the victim\u2019s school when he chanced  upon the victim.  The accused  \nthen followed  the victim  to the toilet and asked the victim to check  if the \nflushing systems in the cubicles were functioning properly. The victim  went \ninto one of the cubicles and tested the flush. The accused then entered  the same \ncubicle and fellated the victim by sucking on his penis without his consent. The \naccused pleaded guilty to one charge under  s 376(1)(b), punishable under  \ns 376(4)( b) of the Penal  Code. Another charge  for attempting to penetrate the \nvictim\u2019s mouth  with his penis was taken into consideration for the purposes  of \nsentencing. No other notable aggravating  factor was present. The accused, who \nwas a first-time offender, was sentenced  to ten years\u2019 imprisonment and \n12 strokes of the cane.  We should  also mention that just like the present  case,  \nthere was only one victim  involved, there was no prior existing relationship  \nbetween the victim and the offender and there  was only a single instance of \nfellatio, although there was another charge taken  into consideration. As far as \nprecedent goes, it generally follows that given that the Respondent here had \nclaimed trial, the sentence,  if any, ought to be higher than ten years\u2019 \nimprisonment. \n6 Second,  in line with the objective  of utilising \u201cthe full spectrum of \nsentences\u201d enacted by Parliament so as to avoid \u201ca clustering of sentencing \noutcomes\u201d (see Ng Kean Meng  Terence v Public Prosecutor [2017] 2 SLR 449 \n(\u201cTerence  Ng\u201d) at [14]), the mandatory  minimum sentence should be reserved  \nfor offenders who have strong mitigating factors  in their favour and where there  \nare no aggravating factors present.  Given that there are no mitigating  factors in \nthe present case (the Respondent claimed trial to the offence, thereby placing \nthe Victim  in the invidious position  of recounting an event that he would surely \nwant to forget),  it follows that the sentence cannot be the mandatory  minimum  \n3\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Chua  Hock  Leong [2018]  SGCA  32\nsentence. On this basis alone, the sentence imposed by the Judge is clearly \nwrong in principle.  \n7 Third, we are of the view that there were, in fact, aggravating factors  \npresent in this case that justified a sentence higher  than the mandatory minimum  \nsentence.\n8 Whilst we disagree  with the Prosecution  that there was premeditation or \nabuse of trust in the present  case,  we find that the harm caused  to the Victim \nwas an aggravating factor. Even  though the Victim was not diagnosed to be \nsuffering from any post-traumatic stress disorder, the offence had caused \npsychological harm to the Victim. The victim impact  statement showed that the \nVictim was so adversely  affected by the incident that he became emotionally \nand socially  withdrawn. He no longer went out of his house unaccompanied. \nUnlike in the past, he often wished to be alone and found social interaction \ndifficult to enjoy. He also did not wish to go back to the park again  but had no \nchoice but to go there when asked to do so by his friends as he was unable to \ntell them  what had happened. Such visits  caused  him distress.  As a result of the \nincident, he also became very afraid  of talking to elderly men. In short, the \nVictim\u2019s life has been damaged  significantly as a result of the Respondent\u2019s  \nactions, a factor that must be taken  into account in sentencing (see Terence Ng \nat [44(h)]).\n9 We also find that in claiming trial to the offence, the Respondent had \ndisplayed an \u201cevident lack of remorse\u201d  (see Terence Ng at [64(c)]). This was \nclearly apparent  to us from  the manner  in which  he chose to conduct his defence  \nat trial. He portrayed the Victim as a sexual  predator who would ask an elderly \nstranger whether he wanted to \u201cplay\u201d (ie, have  sex) and who could even suggest \ngoing to a hotel to do it. The \n4\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Chua  Hock  Leong [2018]  SGCA  32\nRespondent also testified that the Victim kept touching his own private  parts  \nand the Victim\u2019s penis was erect beneath his shorts, thereby implying that the \nVictim was highly  experienced  sexually.  The Respondent also claimed that the \nVictim had touched and talked about the Respondent\u2019s  \u201csperm\u201d after the \nRespondent had masturbated. His counsel  also cross-examined the Victim on \nwhether he watched pornography. \n10 For completeness,  we note that, during the course of its submissions, the \nProsecution had referred  to the benchmarks set by us in Pram Nair v Public \nProsecutor [2017] 2 SLR 1015 (\u201cPram Nair\u201d) for the offence of digital  \npenetration using  a finger under  s 376(2)( a) of the Penal Code. After some \nconsideration, we do not find the present occasion  to be an appropriate case to \ndeal with the applicability or otherwise of the benchmarks set in Pram Nair to \noffences involving fellatio under  s 376(1) of the Penal Code. Since the present"}

By doing so, they stood to be able to redevelop Bugis Cube and then sell the entire project at a profit. Foo agreed and suggested that some of the funding be provided by Sakae. Following this, on 3 September 2010, Sakae entered into the JVA with the Company and GREIC for the purposes proposed by Andy Ong. Sakae was the minority shareholder in the Company, holding 24.69% of the Company\u2019s issued share capital, while GREIC held the remaining 75.31%.', '11\\u2003The JVA included the following provisions:', '(a)\\u2003The board of the Company would consist of four directors, with GREIC and Sakae each entitled to appoint two directors, regardless of their relative shareholding positions in the Company.', '(b)\\u2003For certain defined matters (\u201cShareholder Reserved Matters\u201d), the Company could act only if it obtained the prior unanimous approval of all its shareholders in a general meeting, who were required to act reasonably and in the best interests of the Company and the shareholders when exercising their voting rights.', '(c)\\u2003For other defined matters (\u201cBoard Reserved Matters\u201d), the Company could act only if it obtained the prior majority approval of its directors, who were required to exercise their voting rights reasonably and in the best interests of the Company and the shareholders.', '(d)\\u2003Any director or shareholder with a direct or indirect interest in any matter that would require either shareholder approval or board discussion, not limited to Shareholder Reserved Matters and Board Reserved Matters, was obliged to declare that interest and was not entitled to participate in any discussion or vote on that matter.', 'Notwithstanding the provision in the JVA that the Company would have four directors, at the time of the trial, Foo and Ho were the only two appointed directors of the Company.', '12\\u2003Throughout the course of the following years, Sakae and Foo evidently left the management of the Company to Andy Ong and GCM.

Management fees were payable by the Company to GCM under the MA, and these amounted to $460,000 (plus GST) yearly and such amount of the Company\u2019s profits as was to be determined between the Company and GCM on an annual basis. The defendants in Suit 1098 also produced an addendum to the MA dated 1 May 2010 (\u201cthe Addendum\u201d) which purportedly required the payment of management fees of around $2.8m to GCM. This document was signed by Andy Ong purportedly acting for and on behalf of the Company. In 2011 and 2012, Andy Ong and Ong Han Boon, who were then directors of the Company, caused the Company to pay GCM a sum of $2,826,335.17 pursuant to the Addendum.', '14\\u2003As for Transaction 1(b), in August 2012, Andy Ong represented to DBS Bank Ltd (\u201cDBS\u201d) that GCM was entitled to management fees from the Company calculated in accordance with the terms of the MA and the Addendum. In September 2012, GCM and DBS entered into the TPAP, under which the management fees due to GCM from the Company were assigned to DBS. DBS agreed, on the security of the TPAP, to make credit facilities (\u201cthe DBS Loan\u201d) available to one of Andy Ong\u2019s companies, ERC International Pte Ltd (\u201cERC International\u201d). (ERC International, which is now known as TYN Investment Pte Ltd, is the tenth defendant in Suit 1098; it was previously wholly owned by ERC Holdings.) ERC International drew on the DBS Loan to pay a sum of about $60m to purchase a property at 101 Penang Road. Ultimately, the TPAP caused no loss to the Company because the DBS Loan was fully repaid and the TPAP was discharged.', '15\\u2003Transaction 2 concerned a loan of $10m that the Company extended to ERC Unicampus through the First Loan Agreement. In 2011, Andy Ong and Ong Han Boon, the then directors of the Company, arranged for the First Loan, under which the Company extended a sum of $10m to ERC Unicampus to fund the latter\u2019s purchase of a property that was later named \u201cBig Hotel\u201d. At the trial, whether or not the First Loan had been repaid and, if so, the extent of the repayment made were in dispute.', '16\\u2003Transaction 3 related to the Company\u2019s payment of $16m to ERC Institute in September 2012 as compensation for the early termination of the Lease Agreement. Under that agreement, which was dated 1 March 2012, the Company agreed to let the third to sixth floors of Bugis Cube to ERC Institute. The term of the lease was three years, with an option to renew it for two additional terms of three years each. The Lease Agreement bore the signatures of Ho and Ong Han Boon for and on behalf of the Company and ERC Institute respectively.', '17\\u2003Barely three months after the Lease Agreement was signed, the Company purportedly terminated it by way of a letter dated 30 May 2012. This letter was produced only during the trial. An identically worded letter dated 31 July 2012 had earlier been disclosed before the trial began. Supposedly as compensation for the early termination of the Lease Agreement, the Company paid ERC Institute $16m. The bulk of the compensation amount was paid on 13 September 2012, with $14.3m being disbursed to ERC International and $1.5m to ERC Unicampus. The remaining $200,000 was to be paid to ERC Holdings as and when required.', '18\\u2003Transaction 4 involved the Company\u2019s entry on 4 May 2012 into the Consultancy Agreement with ERC Consulting, under which the latter was to be paid a consultancy fee of $150,000 to conceptualise the sale of Bugis Cube and coordinate promotional activities to effect the sale. The Consultancy Agreement was purportedly signed by Ho on behalf of the Company and by Ong Siew Bok (Andy Ong\u2019s brother) on behalf of ERC Consulting. Ong Siew Bok was at all material times accustomed to act in accordance with Andy Ong\u2019s directions.', '19\\u2003It turned out that earlier, on 2 May 2012, the Company had already engaged Knight Frank Pte Ltd (\u201cKnight Frank\u201d) as the \u201cSole Marketing & Sales Agent\u201d to handle the sale of Bugis Cube, and Knight Frank was named as the \u201cSole Marketing Agent\u201d in the advertisements which were printed to promote the launch event held in June 2012 for the sale. Nonetheless, the Company paid a total of $160,500 to ERC Consulting on 24 December 2012 as \u201cMarketing Consultancy\u201d fees for the sale of Bugis Cube.', '20\\u2003Transaction 5 involved the Company\u2019s entry into the Second Loan Agreement on 7 May 2012 to extend a further loan of $10m to ERC Unicampus. This agreement was signed by Ho for and on behalf of the Company, and by Andy Ong for and on behalf of ERC Unicampus. It was common ground that the following events occurred on 4 May 2012: (a) Foo and Ho, as directors of the Company, passed a board resolution approving the Second Loan and another board resolution calling for an extraordinary general meeting (\u201cEGM\u201d) to be held on 7 May 2012; (b) Ho issued a notice to inform the Company\u2019s shareholders (namely, Sakae and GREIC) of the EGM; and (c) Foo and Ho, as corporate representatives of the respective shareholders, acknowledged the said notice. At the EGM, the Company\u2019s shareholders passed a resolution approving the Second Loan Agreement. It was also undisputed that the Second Loan was subsequently repaid in full (see the Main Judgment at [151]).', '21\\u2003Transaction 6, which is the sole transaction relied on by Sakae in Suit 122, concerned the Company\u2019s alleged grant of an option to ERC Holdings in September 2010 to subscribe for 8.8 million of the Company\u2019s ordinary shares at a price of $8.8m (\u201cthe ERC Option\u201d). It was common ground that on 24 May 2012, ERC Holdings paid the Company $8.8m in the purported exercise of this option. However, Andy Ong only informed Foo two weeks later on 6 June 2012 that ERC Holdings intended to exercise the option.', '22\\u2003According to Sakae, Foo, upon being informed of the ERC Option on 6 June 2012, told Andy Ong that he would not approve the issue of new shares in the Company to ERC Holdings. However, Andy Ong insisted that the option would be exercised by ERC Holdings and informed Foo that if Sakae wished to maintain its 24.69% shareholding in the Company, it would have to subscribe for a further 2,641,975 shares at the price of $2,641,975. In order to maintain Sakae\u2019s shareholding in the Company, Foo yielded to Andy Ong\u2019s demand and signed a series of documents dated 31 May 2012 and 1 June 2012 authorising and approving the allotment of 8,058,025 shares to ERC Holdings; he also caused Sakae to pay a sum of $2,641,975 to the Company for an additional 2,641,975 shares. The agreements and understandings relating to ERC Holdings\u2019 subscription for shares in the Company are collectively referred to as the \u201cShare Option Agreement\u201d.', '23\\u2003As a result of the issuance of new shares to ERC Holdings and Sakae, at the time of the trial, GREIC held 45.35% of the Company\u2019s issued share capital, ERC Holdings held 29.96%, while Sakae continued to hold 24.69%.', '24\\u2003Transaction 7 involved the Company\u2019s payment of $8m to Andy Ong on 24 May 2012 and its execution of the PMA with him.', '25\\u2003According to the appellants in CA 87 (\u201cthe CA 87 appellants\u201d), this payment was a valid payment to Andy Ong for work to be done on the Company\u2019s behalf pursuant to the PMA dated 4 May 2012, which was signed by Ho for and on behalf of the Company, and by Andy Ong on his own behalf. The stated purpose of the PMA was to appoint Andy Ong as the project manager (cl 2) to ensure that the works needed to renovate and refurbish the Company\u2019s units at Bugis Cube would be completed to the Company\u2019s satisfaction (cll 4 and 8). Clause 9 of the PMA fixed the \u201cContract Sum\u201d at $8m.', '26\\u2003Sakae contends that Andy Ong caused the Company to pay him the $8m without any justification and without its (Sakae\u2019s) knowledge or consent. The PMA, Sakae submits, is a sham agreement which was drawn up much later than 4 May 2012, but backdated to that date so as to provide a fictitious basis for making the $8m payment to Andy Ong, and thereby conceal the fact that that payment had nothing to do with the refurbishment of the Company\u2019s units at Bugis Cube but in fact went towards helping to fund ERC Holdings\u2019 exercise of the ERC Option on 24 May 2012. Sakae found out about the $8m payment only in November 2012 when its Chief Financial Officer discovered, while inspecting the Company\u2019s records, that a payment of $8m to Andy Ong had been recorded as a reimbursement to him for sums which he had paid to a \u201cproject manager\u201d appointed to carry out the refurbishment of the Company\u2019s units at Bugis Cube. As for the PMA, it was disclosed only in February 2013 when Andy Ong and Ho filed affidavits to resist Sakae\u2019s application in Originating Summons No 124 of 2013 (\u201cOS 124\u201d) for leave to bring a derivative action in the Company\u2019s name against them pursuant to s 216A (this action was subsequently discontinued by Sakae in May 2013).', '27\\u2003On 25 October 2012, Foo, who by then had serious concerns over various transactions undertaken by the Company, convened a Sakae board meeting to table his concerns. After receiving answers that were unsatisfactory, Foo caused investigations to be carried out into the Company\u2019s financial affairs. The seven transactions enumerated above were then uncovered.', '28\\u2003This led Sakae to commence the two Suits, which were later consolidated. Andy Ong, Ong Han Boon and Ho, along with six of the other defendants in Suit 1098, in turn commenced third party proceedings against Foo in both Suits, claiming either indemnification against or contribution from Foo in respect of any liability that they might incur arising from Sakae\u2019s claims against them.'"}

Since only the second appellant has had conduct of the case, we will refer to him as \u201cthe appellant\u201d.', '5\\u2003In 2007, the respondent purchased the land adjoining the left side of the Property and, in 2008, began construction works to build The Amery. The excavation to build the basement carpark of The Amery commenced between 9 and 23 March 2009, with varying start dates for different parts of the site. It is common ground that the excavation caused the soil around the Property to shift, and the Property to tilt towards the excavation site.', '6\\u2003The tilt was first discovered in late March 2009, when the appellant noticed crack lines appearing on the car porch. Tiles on the building apron had been forced out and grilles on the drains were bending and breaking. The appellant suspected that the Property was tilting when he found that the metal main door grille was closing by itself. There was also ponding of water in the bathrooms.', '7\\u2003After the respondent was alerted to the tilt, the parties jointly inspected the Property on 3 April 2009. The respondent engaged Dr Yong Deung Ming (\u201cDr Yong\u201d), a professional engineer, to inspect the Property. Dr Yong reported that there was \u201cno imminent sign of damage, distress, distortion or [danger]\u201d to the Property and that the Property was \u201cstructurally sound and safe for its intended usage\u201d. The appellant was not satisfied and escalated the matter to the Building and Construction Authority (\u201cthe BCA\u201d).', '8\\u2003On 8 April 2009, two tiltmeters were installed on the Property. The tiltmeters measured the tilt of the Property with the state of the Property on 8 April 2009 as a baseline. In other words, they only measured how much more the Property tilted from 8 April 2009 onwards, without accounting for the pre-existing tilt.', '9\\u2003Separately, Dr Yong took two measurements of the tilt of the Property by optical survey on 9 and 25 April 2009 (\u201cthe 2009 Measurements\u201d). The 2009 Measurements were measurements of the absolute tilt of the Property, ie, the extent to which the Property deviates from a vertical straight line. The absolute tilt is measured by dropping a plumb line from the top of the building and measuring the height-distance from the plumb line to the building wall. The absolute tilt is expressed as a ratio of this distance of deviation over the height of the plumb line. A larger ratio means that the absolute tilt is more acute. For example, 1\/100 represents a larger tilt than 1\/500.', '10\\u2003As a result of the appellant\u2019s complaint, the BCA issued the respondent with a Stop Work Order around 15 April 2009, prohibiting the respondent from carrying out more excavation works and permitting only strengthening works. The basement slabs for The Amery were cast between 21 and 25 April 2009.', '11\\u2003The BCA also required Dr Yong to prepare a further report on his assessment of the tilt of the Property. In a further report dated 15 May 2009 and subsequent letters dated 25 June 2009 and 31 August 2009, Dr Yong assessed the Property to be structurally sound and safe for continued use as a residence. Based on the 2009 Measurements, he advised that the absolute tilt was within tolerable limits and appeared to have stabilised. The tilt continued to be monitored using measurements from the two tiltmeters until July 2010, before a final tiltmeter measurement was taken in July 2012 for a review.', '12\\u2003On 27 July 2012, JIB Specialist Consultants Pte Ltd prepared a report, which was checked and approved by Dr Yong, after a further inspection of the Property (\u201cthe July 2012 Report\u201d). The aim was to assess whether the state of the Property had deteriorated from July 2010 to July 2012. The July 2012 Report relied among other things on the readings taken by the two tiltmeters between March 2010 and July 2012, which showed that the tilt worsened slightly from 2009 to 2010 and stabilised after 2010. Dr Yong stated that he was satisfied that the structural condition of the building remained as stable as it was in July 2010, and that the building was safe for continued occupation.'"}

As a consequence of their children\u2019s Singapore schooling, the Yacobs also began to come to Singapore frequently and got to know the Boedionoes in 2008. The events that led to the two suits took place between 2008 and 2011.', '9\\u2003Suit 71 was commenced on 30 January 2012. It was started to recover various sums of money that Mr Yacob and Mr Suriadinata had transferred to Mr Boediono between 2008 and 2010. The transfers fell into two categories. The first comprised sums of money that Mr Yacob had remitted to Mr Boediono allegedly for the latter to buy a car on his behalf. Two sums were transferred for this purpose: $100,000 on 7 April 2008 and a further $140,100 in August 2009.', '10\\u2003The second category comprised transfers made by both Mr Yacob and Mr Suriadinata to the appellants in December 2010. Specifically, Mr Yacob remitted $607,700 on 7 December 2010 while Mr Suriadinata transferred sums totalling $624,570.19 by various remittances in December 2010 and January 2011. Mr Yacob and Mr Suriadinata claimed that the purpose of the transfers was to enable the appellants to buy apartments in Oasis Garden and Parc  Mondrian as joint investments for the four of them (ie, Mr Yacob, Mr Suriadinata and the appellants).', '11\\u2003In April 2011, Mr Boediono emailed Mr Yacob, asking whether he wanted to convert the condominium investment into a cluster bungalow investment. In June 2011, the Yacobs flew to Singapore to meet the appellants. The parties dispute the precise dates of these meetings and what happened during the meetings. Mdm Susilawaty said she met the appellants on 20 June 2011 while Mr Yacob said his meeting with them took place on 21 June 2011. During these meetings, according to the Yacobs they signed documents relating to the sale of the Oasis Garden apartment. The appellants\u2019 version was completely different. They said that only one meeting took place and that the documents signed were for the transfer of the Apartment.', '12\\u2003In July 2011, the appellants met the Yacobs in Bali to discuss yet another investment.', '13\\u2003In August 2011, Mr Yacob allegedly became suspicious of the appellants after seeing an Indonesian news report that stated that Mr Kweh and his wife were wanted in Indonesia for fraud. He sent an email expressing his concern to Mr Boediono on 24 September 2011. After some correspondence, they agreed to meet on 1 November 2011, but this meeting did not materialise in the end. Finally, in December 2011, the Yacobs visited Singapore to check on the condominium properties but discovered that no units were registered in the appellants\u2019 names. Mr Yacob then sent an urgent SMS message to Mdm Koh.', '14\\u2003 Mr Boediono denied receiving any follow-up emails or messages from Mr Yacob in September 2011, but asserted that he met Mr Yacob on 31 October 2011. At that meeting, Mr Yacob handed over a statutory declaration that he had made for an application for a replacement certificate of title (\u201cRCOT\u201d) in relation to the transfer of the Apartment. Mr Yacob denied that this meeting happened.', '15\\u2003 The factual background to Suit 169 was that in 2007, the Yacobs agreed to buy the Apartment which was a unit in a condominium development in Singapore known as The Chuan. The intention was to make the Apartment a home for their children. The purchase was completed in 2008 and the Apartment was registered in the joint names of the Yacobs. The allegation made in Suit 169 was that the Boedionoes and Mr Kweh had wrongfully procured the fraudulent transfer of the ownership of the Apartment to Mr Kweh using the RCOT. The Yacobs claimed that the transfer documents, which included the RCOT, were fraudulently procured by the appellants. They further claimed that in both the RCOT application and the eventual transfer, Mr Toh and Mr Tan acted negligently. It should be noted that Mr Toh acted for the Yacobs in the RCOT application and Mr Kweh in the transfer of the Apartment, while Mr Tan acted for the Yacobs in the transfer of the Apartment.', '16\\u2003Mr Kweh died before the trial commenced. The court granted leave for the appellants to adduce an affidavit which Mr Kweh had made eight months before he passed away to set out his response to the allegations made by the Yacobs.', '17\\u2003The following is a brief account of events relating to the transfer of the Apartment:', '(a)\\u2003On about 14 June 2011, Mr Toh (acting for Mr Kweh) prepared a draft sale and purchase agreement between the Yacobs and Mr Kweh which stated that the purchase price of the Apartment was $1.8m and further that the Yacobs acknowledged that they had received sums totalling $1,792,750 from Mr Kweh over a period of time prior to the signing of the agreement. He also prepared a formal instrument of transfer.', '(b)\\u2003On 21 June 2011, Mr Boediono allegedly handed over a cashier\u2019s order to Mr Yacob. This cashier\u2019s order represented a refund of an amount of about $7,000 due to Mr Yacob because the Apartment\u2019s purchase price was slightly higher than Mr Yacob\u2019s debt to Mr Kweh. According to the appellants, this buttressed their claim that the transfer of the Apartment was made to satisfy Mr Yacob\u2019s debt to Mr Kweh. After the meeting, the parties flew to Surabaya where they passed the documents mentioned in (a) above to Mr Kweh.', '(c)\\u2003On 27 June 2011, Mr Kweh passed the signed sale and purchase agreement and transfer instrument, and a written statement confirming receipt of the remaining sum owed by Mr Yacob to Mr Kweh to Mr Boediono. The documents appear to have been signed before an Indonesian notary public.', '(d)\\u2003In late June or early July 2011, Mr Kweh informed Mr Boediono that Mr Yacob had misplaced the certificate of title issued in respect of the Apartment and asked his son for Mr Yacob\u2019s contact details so that Mr Toh could help the Yacobs apply for an RCOT.', '(e)\\u2003Mr Boediono provided Mr Toh with an email address (\u201cAddress A\u201d, [xxx]) and a mobile number. Mr Toh asked the appellants to collect documents to be signed for the application. Mr Boediono passed these to his friend, one Suteja Hartanto, to pass to Mr Kweh in Surabaya for the Yacobs to sign before a notary public. Mr Kweh later passed the signed documents back to his son.', '(f)\\u2003On 20 September 2011, Mr Toh used these documents to make an RCOT application. This application was rejected by the Singapore Land Authority (\u201cSLA\u201d) as insufficient information had been provided.', '(g)\\u2003Mr Toh accordingly asked Mr Boediono for the additional details required by the SLA and wanted Mr Yacob to provide the details directly to him. On 24 September 2011, Mr Toh received an email from a second email address (\u201cAddress B\u201d, [xxx]), purporting to be from Mr Yacob.', '(h)\\u2003Mr Boediono alleged that he met Mr Yacob on 31 October 2011 and that the latter handed over a statutory declaration for use in the second RCOT application. Mr Yacob denied this meeting.', '(i)\\u2003Mr Toh then made a second RCOT application. This application was granted on 2 December 2011. The Yacobs averred that they had never received any notification from the SLA to that effect.', '(j)\\u2003Once the RCOT application was successful and a new certificate of title was in hand, it was time for the transfer. Mr Toh could not act for both sides of the transaction so he roped in Mr Tan to act for the Yacobs. In this connection, Mr Toh provided Mr Tan with both Address B and a third email address (\u201cAddress C\u201d, [xxx]) so that Mr Tan would be able to contact his clients. Mr Tan tried to do so but failed. Thus, on 7 December 2011, he emailed a Letter of Authority to Mr Toh for Mr Yacob and Mdm Susilawaty to sign, since Mr Toh said that he would be meeting them in Indonesia that month. Thereafter, on 12  December 2011, Mr Tan received an email from Address B appearing to be from Mr Yacob, confirming that the Apartment had been fully paid for.', '(k)\\u2003On 23 December 2011, Mr Tan sent an email to Mr Yacob at Address B to ask Mr Yacob for permission to complete the sale early. According to Mr Tan, he received an affirmative reply on 27 December 2011.', '(l)\\u2003The registered ownership of the Apartment was transferred into Mr Kweh\u2019s name on 28 December 2011.', '18\\u2003The appellants denied that they had procured the transfer fraudulently. They averred that the Apartment was transferred by the Yacobs to Mr Kweh to pay off Mr Yacob\u2019s indebtedness. Around the time of the transaction, the debt stood at around $1.793m, which was slightly lower than the purchase price of S$1.8m. That was why there was a cashier\u2019s order for the balance sum. Mr Boediono asserted that as further security for repayment, Mdm Susilawaty had issued a cheque for $1.793m (\u201cthe HSBC cheque\u201d), in favour of Mr Kweh. The HSBC cheque was to be encashed if the transfer was not made. Further, Mdm Susilawaty had signed a note handwritten by Mr Kweh which recorded that this was the reason for the HSBC cheque.', '19\\u2003The Yacobs made the case that they never intended to transfer the Apartment to Mr Kweh and that they were the victims of fraud. They said that they never gave Mr Tan instructions to act for them in the conveyance nor did they give Mr Toh instructions to act for them in the RCOT applications. Mdm Susilawaty denied signing the HSBC cheque and the handwritten note. Before the Judge she gave evidence that her cheque book had been kept in the Apartment and that when she entered the premises subsequently to retrieve their belongings the cheque book was missing.', '20\\u2003Both Mr Tan and Mr Toh denied that they were negligent when purporting to act for the Yacobs. Mr Toh said that he acted in the RCOT applications based on information given to him by Mr Boediono, which he verified. Mr Tan said that his information came from Mr Toh, and he had taken proper steps to verify the same.'"}

Bintai is a company incorporated in Singapore carrying on the business of mechanical and electrical engineering.', '7\\u2003This dispute arose out of a contract for construction works in respect of additions and alterations to Suntec City\u2019s convention centre and retail podium. Samsung was the main contractor for the project, while Bintai was engaged by Samsung as the subcontractor. Specifically in respect of the subcontract, Bintai was engaged pursuant to a letter of acceptance dated 3 December 2012 to supply and install mechanical, electrical and plumbing works. The subcontract was for the sum of $85,850,000.00 (excluding GST), with a further sum of $4,475,000.00 (excluding GST) for optional prime costs and provisional sum items.', '8\\u2003On 19 May 2017, Bintai submitted Payment Claim No 59 (\u201cPC 59\u201d) for the claimed amount of $13,479,366.43. On 9 June 2017, Samsung submitted Payment Response No 59 (\u201cPR 59\u201d), stating a response amount of \u201c($2,190,963.62)\u201d. In short, Samsung claimed that far from having any liability to pay Bintai, there was in fact a net balance in Samsung\u2019s favour.', '9\\u2003The breakdown for the amount claimed in PC 59, the response amount in PR 59, and the difference between the two amounts may be seen as follows:', '10\\u2003The backcharges, comprising the sum of \u201c($585,252.20)\u201d, and which had been included in Samsung\u2019s computation of its response amount in PR 59, were imposed by Samsung on Bintai for its failure to provide scaffolding. Samsung claims that this was part of Bintai\u2019s scope of works under the subcontract. On the other hand, the variation works reflected under PR 59 concerned a reassessment of various payments which had previously been made by Samsung to Bintai pursuant to Payment Response No 57 in respect of work that had already been completed by Bintai.', '11\\u2003On 7 July 2017, Bintai served notice of intention to apply for adjudication (\u201cthe NOI\u201d), and lodged the Adjudication Application on the same day. The Adjudication Application and the supporting documents, including Bintai\u2019s submissions made in support of the Adjudication Application (\u201cthe AA Submissions\u201d), filled nine arch-lever files.', '12\\u2003In the NOI, Bintai stated under the \u201cDispute Details\u201d section that the payment response amount of \u201c($2,190.963.62)\u201d was \u201cdisputed\u201d, and that Bintai only intended to seek payment of the sum of $2,146,250.00 (which is for the release of the first half of the retention monies) in the adjudication proceedings.', '13\\u2003In the AA Submissions, Bintai reiterated that while it disputed Samsung\u2019s computation of the response amount in PR 59 of \u201c($2,190.963.62)\u201d, it was only seeking payment of the sum of $2,146,250.00 in the adjudication proceedings, though it expressly reserved its right to claim the balance amount reflected in PC 59 in due course. Bintai then stated that there were three issues in dispute for the purpose of the Adjudication Application. These were said to be the following: (a) the retention monies; (b) the backcharges for scaffolding carried out during the project; and (c) the variation works that had been certified and paid in earlier payment responses but had been recomputed and reversed in PR 59. The remainder of the AA Submissions was organised in three distinct parts, each dealing with one of these three items and recognising that these were three discrete issues to be resolved in the adjudication.', '14\\u2003The Adjudicator was appointed shortly after on 11 July 2017 by the Singapore Mediation Centre.', '15\\u2003On 17 July 2017, Samsung filed the Adjudication Response, which consisted of two arch-lever files, and included its submissions in support of the Adjudication Response (\u201cthe AR Submissions\u201d). In the AR Submissions, Samsung maintained its response amount of \u201c($2,190.963.62)\u201d as reflected in PR 59, and stated that its submissions would be organised in the following four sections: (a) a preliminary objection to the validity of the Adjudication Application; (b) the retention monies; (c) the backcharges for scaffolding; and (d) the variation works previously paid and re-assessed under PR 59. Samsung duly structured the remainder of the AR Submissions in four distinct parts. Thus, aside from raising the preliminary objection that the Adjudication Application failed to \u201ccontain such information or be accompanied by such documents as may be prescribed\u201d as required under s 13(3)(c) of the Act, Samsung plainly joined with Bintai on the precise three issues that Bintai had identified in the AA Submissions.', '16\\u2003The Adjudicator directed Bintai to provide a written response to the AR Submissions by 21 July 2017 and Samsung to file its reply by 22 July 2017, and fixed an oral conference on 25 July 2017.', '17\\u2003Bintai filed its reply submissions on 21 July 2017, while Samsung filed its written reply to Bintai\u2019s reply submissions on 22 July 2017.

It was not in dispute at the hearing of the appeal that Mr Yap was negligent in this regard. As a result, the Airtug collided into a pillar (\u201cthe Pillar\u201d) leading up to and supporting the floor of the Lounge (\u201cthe Accident\u201d). The Pillar extended up to the second level of the T2 Building, where it was situated near the Kiosk. 9', '12\\u2003The Accident caused damage to the Pillar and to the cantilevered portion of the floor of the Lounge. In particular, there was settlement movement of the floor slabs next to the Pillar and near the Kiosk, ie, part of the floor subsided. 10', 'However, it is undisputed that the Kiosk itself did not sustain material damage, eg, in the form of cracks: counsel for NTUC Foodfare, Mr N Sreenivasan SC (\u201cMr Sreenivasan\u201d), confirmed this before us. Mr Sreenivasan also did not contend that the Premises, where the Kiosk was situated, suffered any material damage.', '13\\u2003The Building and Construction Authority (\u201cthe BCA\u201d) issued a Closure Order dated 14 February 2014 (\u201cthe Closure Order\u201d) in respect of the affected area of the Lounge. 11', 'The Kiosk was situated within the affected area. NTUC Foodfare was hence unable to operate the Kiosk while the Closure Order was in force. CAG did not collect rent from NTUC Foodfare during this period. 12', '14\\u2003CAG cut off the electricity supply to the Kiosk while the Closure Order was in force. Some of the equipment at the Kiosk \u2013 chillers, boilers, an ice maker and a toaster \u2013 were damaged due to dust, rust and lack of electricity arising from the closure. 13', '15\\u2003On 18 March 2014, CAG held a meeting with NTUC Foodfare. 14', 'During this meeting, CAG expressed concern that the waterproofing membrane beneath the floor of the Kiosk (see [9] above) had been damaged and requested NTUC Foodfare to retrofit the Kiosk to address this concern. CAG initially indicated that it would bear the cost of the works. However, after NTUC Foodfare submitted a quotation for the works to CAG, the loss-adjusters appointed by CAG\u2019s insurers (\u201cInsight\u201d) wrote to NTUC Foodfare stating that CAG did not cause the incident and should not be held liable for it. 15', 'Insight sent NTUC Foodfare\u2019s quotation to the loss-adjusters appointed by SIAEC\u2019s insurers (\u201cCrawford\u201d).', '16\\u2003On 3 June 2014, Crawford informed NTUC Foodfare that it would have to prove that the waterproofing membrane had been damaged (to recover the cost of the works to the Kiosk from SIAEC or its insurers). 16', '17\\u2003By an email dated 17 July 2014, NTUC Foodfare requested that CAG provide a report stating the reasons why it required the Kiosk to be rebuilt. 17', '18\\u2003By an email dated 23 July 2014, CAG replied to state that it would permit NTUC Foodfare to resume operations at the Kiosk even if it did not rebuild it, provided a qualified person (\u201cQP\u201d) or professional engineer (\u201cPE\u201d) endorsed the safety and operational readiness of the Kiosk. 18', 'However, NTUC Foodfare did not obtain such an opinion from a QP or a PE. NTUC Foodfare\u2019s position is that no QP or PE was willing to certify the safety of the Kiosk without information on the damage to the T2 Building, the rectification works to the same and how the Kiosk was built (and this information was not forthcoming). 19', 'However, the respondents dispute this. At the trial, the respondents called an expert who testified that he would have been able to assess the safety of the Kiosk based on a visual inspection of the Kiosk alone. 20', 'His evidence on this point was unchallenged.', '19\\u2003On 30 July 2014, the BCA lifted the Closure Order. CAG resumed collecting rent from NTUC Foodfare from 7 August 2014. 21', '20\\u2003On 9 October 2014, CAG agreed to grant a further 3-year term lease to NTUC Foodfare for the period of 1 May 2015 to 30 April 2018. 22', 'Thereafter, NTUC Foodfare commenced works to rebuild the Kiosk and eventually resumed business at the outlet in November 2014. 23', '21\\u2003On 10 March 2015, the loss-adjusters appointed by NTUC Foodfare\u2019s insurers, NTUC Income (see [6] above), issued a report assessing the total loss suffered by NTUC Foodfare in the sum of $176,926.85, comprising sums of $5,909.85 and $171,017.00 in respect of the damaged equipment (see [14] above) and loss of profits respectively. 24', 'NTUC Income subsequently paid a sum of $176,176.85 (the total sum assessed by its loss-adjusters excluding a deductible of $750.00 provided for under the Policy) to NTUC Foodfare. 25', '22\\u2003NTUC Foodfare then commenced the suit from which this appeal arises, alleging that it had suffered the following losses due to the Accident: 26', '23\\u2003NTUC Foodfare claims a total of $176,176.85 \u2013 the total of losses (a) and (b) in the table above, excluding the deductible of $750.00 (see [21] above) - on behalf of NTUC Income pursuant to the latter\u2019s right of subrogation under the Policy. It claims losses (c) and (d) (\u201cthe Rebuilding Losses\u201d) in its own right. 27', 'Its case is that Mr Yap drove the Airtug negligently, in breach of his duty of care to NTUC Foodfare, thereby causing the latter to sustain the aforementioned losses. It further claims that SIAEC, Mr Yap\u2019s employer, is vicariously liable for his negligence.'"}
{"casename":"2018_SGCA_42","fact":"'4\\u2003SSA is the national association for the sport of shooting in Singapore. SRA is a member club of SSA. At the material time, SSA was the lessee of the Premises from Sport Singapore (\u201cSport SG\u201d), then known as the Singapore Sports Council, under a lease agreement dated 29 December 2008 (\u201cthe Master Lease\u201d). In turn, SSA allowed SRA to occupy and manage part of the Premises, including two areas known as the SRA Armoury and the SRA Office. This arrangement had been in place since 2000, but was never formalised. Nonetheless, it was accepted, both in the court below and on appeal, that SRA had been granted a gratuitous licence to occupy the SRA Armoury, where it stored its firearms and ammunition.', '5\\u2003At this juncture, we will briefly describe the layout of the Premises. The SRA Armoury is located in the basement of the main building on the Premises (\u201cthe NSC main building\u201d), which is situated at the south-eastern end of the Premises. An unlined earth drain (\u201cthe unlined drain\u201d) runs north-west across the Premises. There are three crossings over the unlined drain, each of which carries beneath it a culvert (ie, a drainage pipe through which water can flow from one section of the unlined drain to the next). These culverts are marked out as Culverts A, B and C in the layout plan annexed to these grounds. Water flows downstream from Culvert A, which is the culvert nearest the SRA Armoury, to Culvert C and onwards out of the Premises.', '6\\u2003In preparation for the 2015 Southeast Asian Games (\u201cthe 2015 SEA Games\u201d), on 30 October 2013, the Premises were handed over by SSA and Sport SG to a contractor known as HCJ Construction Pte Ltd (\u201cHCJ\u201d) for renovation works to be carried out. This handover was evidenced by a letter dated 30 October 2013 from the Singapore Sports Council (as Sport SG was then known) to HCJ, titled \u201cProposed expansion works including additions and alteration works at the [Premises]\u201d and sub-titled \u201cHanding over of site possession for commencement of works\u201d (\u201cthe 30 October Handover Letter\u201d). 1', 'This letter also stated: \u201cHandover by: Singapore Sports Council \/ Singapore Shooting Association\u201d, whose respective representatives were named as Mr Ho Juan Teow and Mr Lim Meng Kiaw. It was not disputed that HCJ had been engaged by Sport SG to carry out the renovation works. However, the precise scope of the renovation works that Sport SG had authorised HCJ to carry out was unclear from the evidence adduced in court, in part because the contract between Sport SG and HCJ was not adduced in evidence. It followed that the precise extent of the handover to HCJ \u2013 ie, whether the whole or only part of the Premises had been handed over \u2013 was disputed. More will be said on this point later (at [46] below).', '7\\u2003On 1 December 2014, HCJ handed over the Premises back to Sport SG and, in turn, SSA. This was evidenced by a \u201cHanding Over Form\u201d dated 1 December 2014 (\u201cthe 1 December Handover Form\u201d), the full title of which read as follows: 2', 'The handover form also indicated: \u201cTaking Over By: Singapore Sports Council\u201d and \u201cWitnessed By: National Shooting Center\u201d. Again, Mr Ho Juan Teow and Mr Lim Meng Kiaw were named as the respective representatives. For ease of reference, the period between 30 October 2013 and 1 December 2014 during which HCJ carried out the renovation works at the Premises will hereafter be termed \u201cthe Renovation Period\u201d.', '8\\u2003During approximately the same timeframe as the Renovation Period (specifically, between August 2013 and December 2014), SRA\u2019s members noticed that numerous trucks carrying full loads of earth fill material and debris frequently entered the Premises. The trucks were observed unloading and dumping their loads on the Premises and then leaving. SSA denied having engaged the trucks to dump the earth fill material and debris on the Premises and claimed that Sport SG was responsible. Likewise, Sport SG denied the allegation and claimed that SSA was responsible. We will revisit this point later in these grounds as the indiscriminate dumping of earth fill material and debris was one of the bases upon which SRA mounted its counterclaim against SSA.', '9\\u2003The 1st Flood occurred on 24 December 2014, less than a month after HCJ handed over the Premises back to Sport SG and, in turn, SSA. The basement of the NSC main building was flooded to a height of approximately 1m. The property stored in the SRA Armoury, such as SRA\u2019s ammunition and target papers, was submerged in water for hours. It was not disputed that the main cause of the 1st Flood was a landslip at the unlined drain (\u201cthe Landslip\u201d) due to what was termed a \u201cslope failure\u201d between Culverts B and C (at [32] of the GD). Soil from the slope of a newly-constructed embankment at that section of the unlined drain (\u201cthe embankment between Culverts B and C\u201d) had slid into the unlined drain, preventing water from flowing through Culvert C and out of the Premises, and creating a backflow of water towards the NSC main building.', '10\\u2003The 2nd Flood occurred on 3 May 2015. The basement of the NSC main building was flooded to a height of approximately 30cm. This time, SRA\u2019s ammunition and target papers were not affected, but SRA nonetheless incurred some cleaning costs. It was not disputed that the main cause of the 2nd Flood was the clogging of Culvert B by debris, with a landslide downstream as a possible contributing factor (at [56] of the GD).'"}
{"casename":"2018_SGCA_43","fact":"'3\\u2003The relevant facts are set out in the statement of facts which the appellant admitted to.', '4\\u2003On 24 July 2016 at about 5am, the appellant was walking in the vicinity of the victim\u2019s housing estate intending to break into a house to steal items. He climbed through an open window on the second floor of a walk-up shop-house unit in which the victim and her grandmother resided.', '5\\u2003After ransacking the living room, the appellant entered the victim\u2019s bedroom where he saw her sleeping. He covered the victim\u2019s mouth and squeezed her neck to prevent her from screaming. He then punched her in the face several times to silence and immobilise her. The victim pretended to have fainted in order to avoid being physically assaulted further. The appellant removed the victim\u2019s shorts and underwear and penetrated her vagina with his penis for about two minutes. The appellant then left the unit with the victim\u2019s mobile phone as well as the victim\u2019s and her grandmother\u2019s handbags.', '6\\u2003The police and paramedics were called and the victim was brought to the hospital. The victim\u2019s medical report stated that she was distressed, dishevelled and vomiting. She had three bruises of about 1\u20132cm in length on her cheeks, chest and arm, a 2cm abrasion on her neck, a contusion on her lip, and experienced tenderness in her back.', '7\\u2003The appellant was arrested later that morning at 10.20 am. The police found one glass bottle and two glass tubes in his pocket. The appellant admitted to ownership and possession of these items, which are utensils used for drug consumption.', '8\\u2003The appellant\u2019s DNA was found on the victim\u2019s endocervical swab, and his semen and DNA were found on the victim\u2019s underwear. The victim\u2019s blood and DNA were detected on the inter-digital area of the appellant\u2019s left hand. The victim\u2019s DNA was also found on his penile swab.', '9\\u2003The victim was subsequently referred to the Institute of Mental Health for a psychiatric assessment. She told her psychiatrist that she was extremely terrified in the immediate aftermath of the rape and that her fianc\u00e9 broke up with her because she was raped. She reported struggling with thoughts of self-blame. The psychiatrist found that she was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder with prominent intrusive memories of the event.', '10\\u2003The statement of facts further relates an earlier incident which took place in the morning of 27 June 2016 when a manager of a caf\u00e9 discovered that the caf\u00e9 had been broken into. A small sling bag was found on the premises and it contained the appellant\u2019s expired passport as well as a straw containing not less than 0.15g of white granular powdery substance later analysed and found to contain diamorphine. The appellant admitted to having ownership and possession of the bag and its contents.', '11\\u2003In the proceedings below, the appellant pleaded guilty to the charges of house-breaking by night with theft and aggravated rape in respect of his actions on 24 July 2016. He also pleaded guilty to the drug possession charge in respect of the diamorphine which was found on 27 June 2016.', '12\\u2003The appellant agreed to the following five charges being taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing (\u201cTIC charges\u201d):'"}
{"casename":"2018_SGCA_44","fact":"'5\\u2003These appeals arise out of a dispute between two groups of parties who entered into a joint venture in 2001 to develop a large plot of land in Bukit Timah referred to as \u201cTurf City\u201d. The first group, the Singapore Agro Agricultural Pte Ltd (\u201cSAA\u201d) Group (\u201cSAA Group\u201d), comprises five individuals: Tan Senior, Tan Chee Beng (\u201cTan CB\u201d), Koh Khong Meng (\u201cKoh KM\u201d), Samuel Ng and Ong Cher Keong (\u201cOng CK\u201d). The three Respondents make up the second group. Two members of the SAA Group \u2013 Samuel Ng and Ong CK \u2013 are not parties to the present set of appeals although they were defendants in the underlying suit (\u201cSuit 27\u201d) from which these appeals arose.', '6\\u2003Pursuant to the joint venture between the SAA Group and the Respondents, two companies, Turf City Pte Ltd (\u201cTCPL\u201d) and Turf Club Auto Emporium (\u201cTCAE\u201d) (collectively referred to as \u201cthe JV Companies\u201d), were incorporated. The shares in the JV Companies were held as follows:', '(a)\\u2003the three Respondents each held 12.5%, and thus 37.5% of the shares in total; and', '(b)\\u2003the SAA Group held the remaining 62.5% of the shares, although Tan CB and Ong CK held their shares indirectly through SAA, a company in which they were shareholders and that was controlled by the SAA Group.', '7\\u2003The site was leased from the Singapore Land Authority (\u201cthe SLA\u201d) by SAA under a \u201c2001 Head Lease\u201d. SAA then granted corresponding sub-tenancies to the JV Companies, which in turn granted sub-sub-tenancies of the units in the site to ultimate tenants. The main source of revenue of the JV Companies came from the rent or fees payable by the ultimate tenants.', '8\\u2003While the site was being developed, the two groups fell into disputes. The Respondents consequently commenced two actions, Suit 703 and OS 1634, based on, among other things, allegations that they had been oppressed as minority shareholders of the JV Companies. The two actions were later consolidated; we hence refer to Suit 703 and OS 1634 collectively as \u201cthe Consolidated Suits\u201d. The Consolidated Suits were brought against some members of the SAA Group. Notably, Tan CB and Ong CK, who are both parties to the present proceedings, were not parties to the Consolidated Suits. The six defendants to the Consolidated Suits were TCPL, TCAE, SAA, Samuel Ng, Koh KM and Tan Senior (collectively, \u201cthe Defendants (Consolidated Suits)\u201d). The parties, however, dispute whether Tan Senior continued to be a party to the Consolidated Suits after his bankruptcy in 2003.', '9\\u2003In the meantime, in 2004, the 2001 Head Lease between SAA and the SLA expired and was renewed for three years through a fresh head lease (\u201cthe 2004 Head Lease\u201d). SAA correspondingly granted sub-tenancies to the JV Companies. Before the Consolidated Suits proceeded to trial, in February 2006, the parties reached a settlement that was recorded by the High Court and encapsulated in the Consent Order. The parties named in the Consent Order were the Respondents and the Defendants (Consolidated Suits). Tan Senior denies being party to the Consent Order, even though he is named therein, on the basis of his lack of involvement in the Consolidated Suits following his bankruptcy in 2003. He also alleges that he had at no point participated in the settlement negotiations which led to the Consent Order and was not privy to the correspondence that was exchanged between counsel over its terms.', '10\\u2003The Consent Order was intended to settle the disputes which were the subject-matter of the Consolidated Suits and end the joint venture by extricating either the Respondents or the SAA Group from the JV Companies (see Turf Club (No 1) at [29]). It provided for a bidding exercise (\u201cthe Bidding Exercise\u201d) to be conducted within stipulated timelines to bring the joint venture to an end. Both groups agreed that the higher bidder would purchase the shares of the lower bidder, and that those behind the lower bid would then resign as directors of the JV Companies. It was also agreed that if the Respondents were the higher bidder, the Defendants (Consolidated Suits), in particular SAA, would use their best endeavours to transfer the lease with the SLA, which was in SAA\u2019s name, to the JV Companies. Two external entities, collectively referred to as \u201cthe KPMG Entities\u201d, were engaged to investigate the financial affairs of the JV Companies, conduct an independent and fair valuation of the shares in the companies and supervise the Bidding Exercise.', '11\\u2003As a result of disagreements over the engagement of, and payment for, a quantity surveyor, the valuation reports for the JV Companies were issued 13 months after the envisaged timeline. During the period of delay, unbeknownst to both the KPMG Entities and the Respondents, SAA renewed the 2004 Head Lease with the SLA for another three years. The new head lease, which is pertinent to these appeals, is referred to as \u201cthe 2007 Head Lease\u201d. Crucially, unlike in the case of the previous two head leases, SAA did not grant corresponding sub-tenancies to the JV Companies.', '12\\u2003The valuation reports prepared by the KPMG Entities did not take into account the 2007 Head Lease or the earning capacities of the JV Companies in the period after the expiry of the 2004 Head Lease. This was because neither KPMG Entities nor the Respondents had been informed of the 2007 Head Lease after it was entered into on 22 May 2007. As a result, the valuation reports reflected a very pessimistic outlook on the two companies: TCPL was valued at $1.33 per share and TCAE was assigned a \u201cnil\u201d value.', '13\\u2003The 2007 Head Lease eventually came to light after the valuation reports were issued. The Respondents responded by calling for revised valuation reports to be issued. In response, the Defendants (Consolidated Suits) maintained, through their counsel, that there was no need to revise the valuation reports to take into account the 2007 Head Lease because, while the 2004 Head Lease had been renewed, SAA was not obliged to, and therefore would not, renew the sub-tenancies with the JV Companies.', '14\\u2003This led the Respondents to file an application (\u201cSUM 4117\u201d) seeking, among others, an order to clarify and\/or vary the Consent Order to oblige SAA to renew the sub-tenancies with the JV Companies and for a revaluation exercise to be conducted on the new terms. The application was dismissed by Choo Han Teck J, who held that the High Court had no jurisdiction to vary the Consent Order. In the same judgment, Choo J also observed that the allegations of breaches of the Consent Order were unfounded. Thereafter, each side filed further applications against the other group revolving around the question of whether the Bidding Exercise ought to proceed.', '15\\u2003Eventually, the Respondents commenced Suit 27. In this suit, the Respondents brought a number of claims against the individual members of the SAA Group (ie, Tan Senior, Tan CB, Koh KM, Samuel Ng and Ong CK), of which only the following are pertinent to the present appeals:', '(a)\\u2003Contractual breaches of the following terms of the Consent Order, pursuant to which the Respondents sought a setting aside of the Consent Order and a revival of the Consolidated Suits:', '(b)\\u2003In the alternative, a claim that the individual members of the SAA Group breached the fiduciary duties they owed to the Respondents, and are therefore liable to account to the Respondents for the profits made since the 2001 Head Lease, including but not limited to the profits made under 2007 Head Lease; and', '(c)\\u2003In the alternative, two claims in tort that the individual members of the SAA Group are liable for having conspired to breach the Consent Order and\/or having induced the breaches of the Consent Order.', '16\\u2003Choo J dismissed the action without a trial after hearing the parties on some preliminary issues in October 2012. The Respondents appealed to the Court of Appeal (vide \u201cCA 156\u201d), and succeeded in reversing Choo J\u2019s decision. Suit 27 was remitted to the High Court to be tried by the Judge.', '17\\u2003The Judge heard the parties in the first half of 2015 and delivered his judgment on 6 August 2015 (\u201cthe HC Judgment\u201d). He first held that Choo J\u2019s earlier observations in SUM 4117 \u2013 namely, that the allegations of breaches were unfounded (see [14] above) \u2013 did not give rise to an issue estoppel in respect of the construction of the Consent Order and the allegations of breaches. The Judge then held that the Consent Order ought to be set aside (and the Consolidated Suits be revived) for two reasons:', '(a)\\u2003The Consent Order was inoperative.', '(b)\\u2003The Defendants (Consolidated Suits) had committed repudiatory breaches of the three terms (as summarised at [15] above).', '18\\u2003The Judge made consequential orders granting leave to the Respondents to add Tan CB, Tan Senior and Ong CK as defendants in the Consolidated Suits. In doing so, he dismissed the latter two\u2019s attempt to raise laches, estoppel by conduct, waiver by election and abuse of process as defences in order to avoid being named as defendants in the reinstated suits on the ground of a substantial delay before the Respondents commenced legal proceedings against them.', '19\\u2003In addition, the Judge dismissed the counterclaim that was brought by three of the defendants to Suit 27 asking for the Bidding Exercise to be proceeded with. The Judge did not deal with the alternative claims that the defendants had (a) committed breaches of fiduciary duties, and (b) conspired to procure and\/or induced the breaches of the Consent Order. Instead, he held that these claims were to be dealt with alongside the revived Consolidated Suits.', '20\\u2003All the defendants in the action, save for Samuel Ng who never took part in the proceedings but against whom judgment was entered, appealed against the Judge\u2019s decision. Three appeals were filed. Ong CK\u2019s appeal, however, was deemed withdrawn after the time for the filing of the requisite documents lapsed. Samuel Ng and Ong CK are thus not party to these appeals.', '21\\u2003In Turf Club (No 1), this Court upheld the Judge\u2019s finding that the Defendants (Consolidated Suits) had breached cl 11, the implied term, and cl 5 of the Consent Order (in the manner summarised at [15(a)] above), and that all three breaches (\u201cthe Repudiatory Breaches\u201d) were repudiatory in nature.', '22\\u2003While we agreed with the Judge that the Consent Order had been breached, we disagreed that the Consent Order could thus be set aside and the Consolidated Suits could be revived. The Repudiatory Breaches only had the effect of prospectively terminating the Consent Order and releasing the parties from future obligations. Further, the original causes of action in the Consolidated Suits had been superseded upon the making of the Consent Order, and the original claims had been discharged. The Consent Order did not provide for the revival of the claims in the event of a breach. In addition, contrary to the Appellants\u2019 submission, the court did not retain a residual discretion to set aside or not enforce a contractual consent order. There was also no basis to find that the Consent Order could be set aside on the ground that it was inoperative. We therefore reversed the Judge\u2019s finding that the Consent Order ought to be set aside as well as his order that the Consolidated Suits be revived.', '23\\u2003In our judgment in Turf Club (No 1), which was delivered on 22 March 2017, we directed the parties to address several issues that the Judge did not have to deal with, but which were now material due to our ruling that the Consent Order should not be set aside (at [175]). In particular, parties were asked to submit on (a) what remedies should be ordered for the Repudiatory Breaches of the Consent Order, and (b) which of the Appellants would be subject to such remedies. These gave rise to the Remedy Issue and the Party Issue, respectively.', '24\\u2003Thereafter, in July 2017, the Respondents obtained leave to file further submissions on, among other issues, the Fiduciary Duties Issue. This alternative claim for breach of fiduciary duties had been advanced at the trial below, but had not been decided on by the Judge on the basis that it could be determined together with the revived Consolidated Suits (see [19] above). Given that we had reversed the Judge on this point, it was only fair to allow them to address this issue before us.', '25\\u2003We heard the parties\u2019 submissions on the three issues on 15 August 2017. During the course of that hearing, it became clear that there were two other causes of action that should be addressed: the Respondents\u2019 alternative claims that the Appellants were liable for the tort of conspiring to procure the breaches of the Consent Order and\/or the tort of inducing the breaches of the Consent Order (see [15(c)] above). These alternative claims are more relevant to those Appellants who are found to not be liable in contract (not being parties to the Consent Order), as they may nonetheless be liable in tort for the damage caused by the breaches of the Consent Order. As with the claim in breach of fiduciary duties, these claims in tort had not been dealt with by the Judge on the basis that they could be determined together with the revived Consolidated Suits (see [19] above).', '26\\u2003Following the hearing of 15 August 2017, we remitted a question to the Judge on the tortious claims and, in particular, whether the defendants in Suit 27 who were not parties to the Consent Order, namely Tan CB, Ong CK and\/or Tan Senior (who is arguably not a party to the Consent Order), had conspired to procure and\/or had induced the breaches of the Consent Order by the other relevant defendants. The Judge heard the parties on this question in September 2017 and delivered a supplementary judgment on 17 October 2017 (\u201cthe Supplementary Judgment\u201d), in which he found:', '(a)\\u2003Tan CB, Koh KM, Tan Senior, and Ong CK liable for conspiracy to injure the Respondents by unlawful means, ie, by procuring or otherwise enabling the breach of the Consent Order; and', '(b)\\u2003Tan CB, Tan Senior, and Ong CK liable for the tort of inducing the breach of the Consent Order by SAA.', '27\\u2003We heard the parties on the correctness of the Judge\u2019s findings on these claims in tort on 2 March 2018.', '28\\u2003With the above background in mind, we move on to consider, in turn, the four issues (set out at [3] above) \u2013 namely, the Fiduciary Duties Issue, the Party Issue, the Remedy Issue and the Tort Issue.'"}

A fuller account of the background and procedural history of the present dispute may be found in the GD (at [4]\u2013[12]).', '4\\u2003The Appellant has, since his birth in 1984, lived in a five-room Housing Development Board (\u201cHDB\u201d) flat located at Block 306 Hougang Avenue 5 #02-355 Singapore 530306 (\u201cthe Flat\u201d) until he was evicted by the Respondent in July 2009. The Flat was held in joint tenancy by the Deceased and one Low Eng Cheng, who is one of the Appellant\u2019s aunts (\u201cthe Aunt\u201d). The Aunt and the Deceased had previously moved out of the Flat in 1992, but returned to live with the Appellant in 2005. The Aunt passed away on 7 September 2007, while the Deceased passed away on 28 November 2008. This left the Estate, which the Appellant was not a beneficiary of, as the sole legal and beneficial owner of the Flat.', '5\\u2003According to the Appellant, the Deceased had, before her passing, frequently emphasised to the Appellant, in the presence of his relatives and their family doctor, that the Flat was not to be sold in the event of her demise, and that the Appellant would be free to continue staying in the Flat for as long as he wished. The Deceased also expressed her intention to leave everything in the Flat to the Appellant.', '6\\u2003In reliance on the promises made by the Deceased, the Appellant took care of both the Aunt (who was suffering from ovarian cancer) and the Deceased (who was suffering from tuberculosis) during the entire period from 2005 till their deaths in 2007 and 2008, respectively. The Appellant claimed to have suffered from the following detriments:', '(a)\\u2003First, the Appellant spent time and effort to care for the Aunt and the Deceased, and took on the responsibility of paying for all of the household expenses, including food and utilities, as well as the medical expenses for the Deceased. He did not claim these expenses from a sum of $40,000 that the Aunt had left in her bank account, to which she had given the Appellant access for the purposes of maintaining and providing for the Deceased. He also refrained from asking his other family members to contribute to the expenses.', '(b)\\u2003Second, the Appellant refrained from seeking regular full-time employment, and subsequently also gave up his employment as a financial planner with Manulife Singapore (even though it allowed for relative flexibility in working hours) in order to take care of the Deceased on a full-time basis.', '(c)\\u2003Third, the Appellant claimed that while taking care of the Deceased, given that the Deceased had contracted tuberculosis, he had to endure the \u201cmental anguish\u201d that came with the fear of contracting tuberculosis himself. The Appellant was also compelled to sacrifice his social life by avoiding social contact in the entire period when taking care of the tuberculosis-stricken Deceased.', '7\\u2003Following the Appellant\u2019s eviction in July 2009, he brought the Suit, which is a claim in proprietary estoppel against the Estate. In the Appellant\u2019s original Statement of Claim filed in February 2010, the Appellant sought to recover only the moneys expended in taking care of the Deceased during her lifetime. However, the Appellant subsequently amended his Statement of Claim in March 2013 to include an additional claim for equitable compensation for the loss of his life-long licence to reside in the Flat.', '8\\u2003On 24 August 2016, the Appellant obtained an order for interlocutory judgment against the Estate with damages to be assessed.', '9\\u2003At first instance before the AR, the Appellant dropped his claim for the moneys expended in taking care of the Deceased, and focused only on his claim for the equitable compensation for the loss of his life-long licence, which he claimed is best quantified by reference to the rent that he has been paying in respect of his alternative accommodation following his eviction from the Flat. To that end, the Appellant sought a sum of $420,000.', '10\\u2003The AR awarded the Appellant damages of $84,000, taking the view that a sum equivalent to rental of $1,000 per month for a period of seven years from the time when he was evicted from the Flat was sufficient to satisfy the equity that arose as a result of the detriment suffered by the Appellant. The AR also ordered the costs of the action to be taxed on a District Court scale if not agreed. The Appellant appealed.'"}

Since then, he has been residing in Singapore. M attends a kindergarten in Singapore and is due, if he is to remain here, for enrolment in a local primary school in early 2019. M was born with a congenital lung condition. Initially treated for this condition at a hospital in London, he is currently under the care of KK Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Hospital (\u201cKKH\u201d). In early 2017, M was diagnosed by a specialist at KKH as having Autism Spectrum Disorder (\u201cASD\u201d). He has been participating in an early intervention programme run by the Autism Association (Singapore) (\u201cAAS\u201d) since June 2017.', '5\\u2003The appellant, TSF (\u201cthe Father\u201d), is M\u2019s father. He is a 41-year-old Singaporean. During the marriage, the Father worked in the London office of an international bank. After his return to Singapore in September 2016, the circumstances of which are discussed below (at [27]), he worked as an ad hoc tuition teacher and a freelance risk management consultant. His counsel informed this court at the hearing of the appeal that he had recently found employment as an administrator in a local tertiary institution. He presently resides with M in Singapore.', '6\\u2003The respondent, TSE (\u201cthe Mother\u201d), is M\u2019s mother. She is currently 35 years old and is a national of another Asian country. After the parties married in Singapore in June 2011, she moved to London to live with the Father. At present, she is still residing in the parties\u2019 English matrimonial home. She has been granted a \u201cLeave to Remain\u201d permit by the UK immigration authorities. This permit, granted in August 2017, entitles her to live and work in the UK until 31 January 2020, with the possibility of further extensions. The Mother was a student during the marriage but avers that she recently found employment in London as a bookkeeper and office administrator.', '7\\u2003M and the Father live with M\u2019s paternal grandparents (\u201cthe Grandparents\u201d), who are retirees. The Grandparents have been involved in caring for M for a substantial part of his life.', '8\\u2003In July 2013, when M was around a year old, his parents brought him to Singapore so that the Grandparents could look after him while the Mother prepared for an examination in England. Shortly thereafter, the couple returned to the UK, leaving M behind. The relationship between his parents broke down while M was in Singapore. Unbeknownst to the Mother, the Father had decided to end their marriage and he covertly instructed his solicitors in Singapore to prepare the necessary applications.', '9\\u2003On 18 January 2014, the Father and the Mother arrived in Singapore again. The Mother was under the impression that they were here to pick up M and would return to the UK with him within the month. Within days of their arrival, however, the Father initiated divorce proceedings in Singapore and filed the following applications:', '(a)\\u2003OSF 30\/2014, an ex parte application to restrain the Mother from taking M out of jurisdiction while the other applications were being heard;', '(b)\\u2003OSF 31\/2014, an application for sole custody, care and control of M with supervised access to the Mother; and', '(c)\\u2003OSF 36\/2014, an application for leave to file a Writ of Summons for divorce within three years of marriage.', '10\\u2003The second and third applications were served on the Mother on 22 January 2014. She was caught by surprise. Although the applications had been assigned hearing dates in February, the Mother took no action in Singapore at that point. Instead, she instructed solicitors in England to file an emergency application in the English courts. She obtained an order from the English High Court on 24 January 2014 requiring the Father to return M to England. According to the Mother, the order was served on the Father by e-mail and so enraged him that he made threats against her life which terrified her. On 25 January 2014, the Mother flew back to the UK alone. At the Singapore airport she was served with the ex parte application to restrain her from taking M with her but there is no indication on the record that she was planning to do so at that time.', '11\\u2003The Mother took no part in the Singapore proceedings for quite a while thereafter but pursued her English proceedings. These led to several orders being made subsequently by the English courts: (a) M was made a ward of the English courts; (b) the Father\u2019s passport was impounded; and (c) the Father was repeatedly ordered to return or cause the return of M to the UK. For clarity of exposition, we elaborate on the English proceedings separately at [15] to [25] below. It should be noted that the Father himself returned to England shortly after the Mother, leaving M with the Grandparents, and thereafter contested the English proceedings.', '12\\u2003On 26 February 2014, the Father was granted leave by the Singapore court to commence a divorce suit within three years of the marriage. The Father filed for divorce here on 28 February 2014. At this point, the Father carried on the proceedings from abroad. Shortly after the divorce proceedings were commenced, the Grandparents filed an application seeking to be appointed legal guardians of M and to have interim custody, care and control, pending the conclusion of the divorce proceedings.', '13\\u2003In July 2014, interim judgment of divorce was granted to the Father. In January 2015, the court decided it should make no order as to the custody, care and control of M, without prejudice to either party\u2019s right to apply for custody after the conclusion of the English proceedings in relation to M. In the light of this, the Grandparents withdrew their application for guardianship.', '14\\u2003Whilst the Mother\u2019s English solicitors wrote to the Family Court in Singapore a few times in 2015 informing them of orders made by the English courts, the Mother hardly participated in the Singapore proceedings. She did not take action here until late November 2015 when she filed an application for an order mirroring those made by the English courts for the return of M and for the recognition of M as a ward of the English courts (hereinafter, the \u201cmirror order\u201d). Shortly thereafter, in January 2016, she filed a Notice of Appointment of Solicitors in the divorce proceedings.', '15\\u2003In the meantime, proceedings relating to the custody of M were apace in England. On 24 January 2014, in response to the Father\u2019s applications in Singapore, the Mother filed an emergency ex parte application in the English courts for the return of M to England. On the same day, the English High Court made orders for the Father to return M to England no later than 29 January 2014. Further, the Father was to surrender his and M\u2019s travel documents, in so far as they were within his possession or control, until further direction of the court. M was also made a ward of the English court until further order.', '16\\u2003On 30 January 2014, the Father attended at the English High Court and disputed its jurisdiction over M. He took the position that M was habitually resident in Singapore and that it was the Singapore courts that had jurisdiction to make orders relating to M\u2019s welfare. As a result, the earlier court order was suspended and the issue as to M\u2019s place of habitual residence was fixed for hearing.', '17\\u2003On 28 February 2014, the Father was arrested by the London police in relation to allegations of marital rape made against him by the Mother.', '18\\u2003On 14 March 2014, after hearing arguments as to M\u2019s habitual residence, Russell J delivered judgment holding that M was habitually resident in the UK and accordingly ordered the Father\u2019s return of M to the UK no later than 18 March 2014: see Re M (a child) [2014] EWHC 963 (Fam). The Father\u2019s passport was ordered to be detained until M was returned to England.', '19\\u2003On 3 April 2014, after the Father failed repeatedly to comply with orders to return M to the UK, the Father was found to be in contempt of court by the English High Court and sentenced to 18 months\u2019 imprisonment: see MB v GK [2014] EWHC 1122 (Fam). The Grandparents were also joined as parties to the wardship proceedings and ordered to return M to the UK. In June 2014, on appeal by the Father, the English Court of Appeal set aside the order of imprisonment but affirmed the finding that M was habitually resident in the UK and consequently dismissed the Father\u2019s appeal against the orders requiring him to cause M\u2019s return to the UK: see Re K (Return Order: Failure to Comply: Committal: Appeal) [2015] 1 FLR 927.', '20\\u2003Several events occurred in the second half of 2014:', '(a)\\u2003In August 2014, the Mother engaged the assistance of a child recovery organisation and entered Singapore illegally by boat with two of its operatives. They forcibly removed M from the Grandparents\u2019 care while the Grandparents were leaving their residence with M. A scuffle left M and one or both of the Grandparents with minor injuries. The police retrieved M shortly afterwards and arrested the Mother. M was then placed in the voluntary care of the Grandparents. In September 2014, the Mother pleaded guilty to immigration offences in Singapore and was sentenced to ten weeks\u2019 imprisonment.', '(b)\\u2003In July 2014, Wood J ordered the Father, in so far as he was lawfully able to do so, to seek the immediate return of M to the UK in the Singapore courts. However, this order was later discharged as the Mother no longer relied on it.', '21\\u2003In June 2015, Roberts J of the English High Court heard and dismissed the Father\u2019s application to stay the English wardship proceedings on the grounds of forum non conveniens in Re K (A Child) (No 3) (Forum Conveniens) [2016] 2 FLR 132. Further, she made orders in July 2015 for M to be joined as a party to the proceedings, for a third party to be appointed as his guardian, and for him to be returned to England by 9 September 2015. Two further court orders were made in August and October 2015 requiring the Father to cause the return of M to England on pain of contempt of court. Again, these orders were not complied with.', '22\\u2003In October 2015, the Father was tried for alleged rape of the Mother. He was subsequently acquitted by the jury.', '23\\u2003According to the Mother, as of November 2015, 11 orders had been made by the English courts for the return of M, none of which were complied with.', '24\\u2003In late November 2015, the Mother filed OSG 204\/2015 in Singapore seeking the mirror order (see [14] above). In December 2015, she also obtained an interim injunction preventing the Father and the Grandparents from removing M from Singapore. In response, the Grandparents made a second bid for guardianship of M. The Father also applied for sole custody, care and control of M with supervised access to the Mother. The Mother in turn applied for the Father\u2019s and the Grandparents\u2019 applications to be stayed.', '25\\u2003This led to a total of five applications before the District Judge (\u201cthe DJ\u201d) in the Family Court and it is to these applications that we now turn.'"}

He is an experienced businessman who has been involved in various businesses since the 1980s, primarily in the retail of beverages and fruit juices. Mr Ole is married to Mdm Lai Oi Heng (\u201cMdm Lai\u201d). Mdm Lai has been in charge of managing the couple\u2019s joint personal portfolio by channelling their wealth towards various investments since the 1970s.', '6\\u2003The Second Respondent (\u201cMr Sim\u201d) is an entrepreneur.

VIE was in the business of general wholesale trade until it was de-registered in 2012.', '7\\u2003Mdm Lai first met the Respondents around the end of 2003 when she obtained Mr Sim\u2019s help to settle a dispute. Mdm Lai and Mr Sim became good friends.', '8\\u2003Subsequently, from early 2005, Mdm Lai and VIE entered into a series of agreements. The agreements were recorded in writing. On their face, they were for Mdm Lai to provide \u201cloans\u201d to VIE for the purchase and resale of specified foods and food-related products overseas. The agreements provided that the funds were to be repaid with a \u201cprofit\u201d on a stipulated date (\u201cthe Repayment Date\u201d). Each agreement was also supported by a tax invoice from VIE stating the type, quantity and price of the goods which it related to.', '9\\u2003At Mdm Lai\u2019s request, the party providing the funds under the agreements was changed from Mdm Lai to Orion around end 2007 (hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Orion Agreements\u201d), and then from Orion to Mr Ole from about end February to March 2008 (hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Ole Agreements\u201d). In total, between 2005 and early 2008, there were 740 such agreements between Mdm Lai, Orion or Mr Ole (as the party providing the funds) and VIE under which more than $58m was disbursed (\u201cthe Agreements\u201d).', '10\\u2003Both sides accept that the Agreements are not entirely proper. In particular, it is common ground that the tax invoices are not genuine documents and do not reflect actual transactions performed by VIE. What is disputed is the true nature of the Agreements and the events which transpired during the material period.', '11\\u2003Subsequently, VIE failed to repay the Appellants under the 76 Orion and Ole Agreements, which were concluded between December 2007 and March 2008. The sum outstanding under the Orion and Ole Agreements was $10,253,845, comprising $8,909,500 as the principal sums yet to be repaid and $1,344,345 as the \u201cprofit\u201d due to the Appellants. The Appellants therefore sued Ms Chua (trading as VIE) for breach of contract (for the entire outstanding sum) and in unjust enrichment (for the unpaid principal sums alone). They also sued Ms Chua and Mr Sim for falsely representing to them that the monies were for business purposes and for conspiring to defraud them. The two latter claims are therefore the only substantive causes of action against Mr Sim.', '12\\u2003It should be noted from the outset that the claims in contract and unjust enrichment are against Ms Chua in her capacity as the sole proprietor of VIE. In fact, it was VIE which was the contracting party to the Agreements as made clear by the wording of the contracts, and the fact that they were endorsed with VIE\u2019s stamp. In this regard, it is undisputed that Mr Sim was the main controller of VIE and Ms Chua was acting as his assistant.'"}
{"casename":"2018_SGCA_50","fact":"'14\\u2003The appellant is Lee Tat Development Pte Ltd (\u201cLee Tat\u201d). The respondent is the management corporation of the condominium development, Grange Heights (\u201cthe MCST\u201d). The long-running legal dispute between Lee Tat and the MCST concerns a narrow strip of land (\u201cthe Servient Tenement\u201d).', '15\\u2003Tracing the origins and winding course of the dispute calls for a brief description of the lay of the land. As shown in the diagram below, Grange Heights sits on a plot designated Lot 687 (the dotted area), which comprises what were formerly two separate pieces of land, namely Lots 111-34 and 561.', 'As can be seen, Lot 687 has no access to Grange Road except via Lot 111-31 (the shaded area), ie, the Servient Tenement, which lies between what was formerly Lot 111-34 and Grange Road. This means that for Grange Heights residents, the most direct method of accessing Grange Road is to pass through the Servient Tenement. The question at the heart of the protracted tussle between Lee Tat and the MCST was whether Grange Heights residents had this right of way (\u201cthe Right of Way\u201d). In successive rounds of litigation, the MCST maintained that Grange Heights residents did have it. On the other hand, Lee Tat, which initially owned only two dominant tenements, Lots 111-32 and 111-33 (shown to the left of the Servient Tenement), but subsequently acquired the Servient Tenement itself, maintained that Grange Heights residents had no such Right of Way, and sought to exclude them from using the Servient Tenement.', '16\\u2003The issue whether Grange Heights residents had the Right of Way is intertwined with changes in ownership of the various lots of land over time. Lots 111-30, 111-31 (ie, the Servient Tenement), 111-32, 111-33 and 111-34 were originally owned by a company called Mutual Trading Ltd (\u201cMutual Trading\u201d). In 1919, Mutual Trading sold Lots 111-30, 111-32, 111-33 and 111-34 (\u201cthe Dominant Tenements\u201d) and granted a right of way over the Servient Tenement to the purchasers of the Dominant Tenements. In this way, owners of Lot 111-34 came to enjoy the Right of Way over the Servient Tenement.', '17\\u2003In 1970, Hong Leong Holdings Ltd (\u201cHLH\u201d), the developer of Grange Heights and the MCST\u2019s predecessor in title, acquired Lots 111-34 and 561. The two lots were amalgamated into Lot 687 in 1976. It should be noted that the residential units within Grange Heights were built on what was formerly Lot 561, while the tennis courts and changing rooms were constructed on what was formerly Lot 111-34.', '18\\u2003Lee Tat, which was then known as Collin Development Pte Ltd (\u201cCollin\u201d), acquired Lots 111-32 and 111-33 in 1973. It later also purchased the Servient Tenement on 27 January 1997.', '19\\u2003The present set of proceedings was preceded by five rounds of litigation between the parties. These shall be referred to as \u201cthe First Action\u201d to \u201cthe Fifth Action\u201d respectively, in chronological order of commencement. We foreshadow, however, that the Fourth Action was heard and decided before the Third Action.', '20\\u2003The First Action was brought by Collin against HLH in 1974, when Grange Heights was under construction. At the time, Collin had recently acquired Lots 111-32 and 111-33, but did not own the Servient Tenement. Collin sought a declaration that HLH and its employees, as well as Grange Heights residents, were not entitled to use the Servient Tenement. HLH counterclaimed for a declaration that it enjoyed the Right of Way. The matter was heard at first instance by F A Chua J. In Collin Development (Pte) Ltd v Hong Leong Holdings Ltd [1974\u20131976] SLR(R) 618 (\u201cGrange Heights (No 1) (HC)\u201d), he dismissed Collin\u2019s claim on the basis that HLH had not substantially interfered with Collin\u2019s enjoyment of the Right of Way (at [22]). Chua J also dismissed HLH\u2019s counterclaim on the ground that the declarations sought by HLH could not be made against Collin because the latter was not the owner of the Servient Tenement (at [24]). His decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal in Collin Development (Pte) Ltd v Hong Leong Holdings Ltd [1974\u20131976] SLR(R) 806.', '21\\u2003The Second Action was commenced by the MCST in April 1989. By this time, Lots 111-34 and 561 had been amalgamated, the MCST had become the owner of Lot 687, and Collin had renamed itself Lee Tat. Lee Tat owned Lots 111-32 and 111-33, but it did not yet own the Servient Tenement.', '22\\u2003The Second Action was prompted by Lee Tat\u2019s instalment of an iron gate and fence across the ends of the Servient Tenement. The MCST reacted by applying for an injunction to restrain Lee Tat from restricting its access to the Servient Tenement. Lee Tat raised two contentions in response:', '(a)\\u2003first, that the amalgamation of Lot 111-34 and Lot 561 had extinguished the MCST\u2019s Right of Way (\u201cthe Amalgamation Issue\u201d); and', '(b)\\u2003secondly, that Grange Heights residents were not entitled to use the Servient Tenement because the residential apartments stood on Lot 561, and the benefit of the Right of Way did not extend from Lot 111-34 to Lot 561, as the latter was not one of the Dominant Tenements (\u201cthe Extension Issue\u201d).', '23\\u2003The Second Action was heard by Punch Coomaraswamy J. In Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 301 v Lee Tat Development Pte Ltd [1990] 2 SLR(R) 634, Coomaraswamy J held that the amalgamation of Lots 111-34 and 561 had not extinguished the MCST\u2019s Right of Way (at [8]). He also found that Lee Tat was not entitled to close the Right of Way because it was not the owner of the Servient Tenement and did not complain of excessive use of the Servient Tenement (at [9]\u2013[10]). He therefore granted an injunction restraining Lee Tat from interfering with the MCST\u2019s Right of Way (at [11]). This decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal in Lee Tat Development Pte Ltd v Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 301 [1992] 3 SLR(R) 1 (\u201cGrange Heights (No 2) (CA)\u201d), which judgment was released in September 1992.', '24\\u2003It must be noted that whilst Coomaraswamy J determined the Amalgamation Issue in favour of the MCST, he did not address the Extension Issue. The Court of Appeal also did not address the Extension Issue in Grange Heights (No 2) (CA). The significance of this point will become clear shortly.', '25\\u2003The Third Action was commenced on 4 June 2004 by the MCST. By this time, Lee Tat had become the owner of the Servient Tenement (in 1997). In the Third Action, the MCST sought a declaration that it was entitled to repair and maintain the Right of Way, which had allegedly fallen into disrepair.', '26\\u2003Soon after the commencement of the Third Action, Lee Tat commenced the Fourth Action on 26 June 2004. It sought various reliefs, including a declaration that the Right of Way could not be used for access to Lot 687, and a permanent injunction preventing Grange Heights residents from using the Right of Way.', '27\\u2003By agreement of the parties, the Fourth Action was heard before the Third Action. In the proceedings, Lee Tat again raised the Extension Issue, submitting that the Right of Way could not be used for the benefit of Lot 561. In this regard, it cited Harris v Flower and Sons (1904) 91 LT 816 (\u201cHarris v Flower\u201d) for the principle that a right of way which is granted over a servient tenement in favour of a dominant tenement cannot be used for the purposes of a non-dominant tenement, as this would exceed the rights of the dominant owner as defined by the terms of the grant (\u201cthe Harris v Flower principle\u201d). The Fourth Action was heard by Woo Bih Li J at first instance. His judgment is found at Lee Tat Development Pte Ltd v Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 301 [2004] 4 SLR(R) 828 (\u201cGrange Heights (No 4) (HC)\u201d). Woo J held that the judgments in the Second Action had determined whether Grange Heights residents could use the Right of Way to gain access not only to Lot 111-34 but also to Lot 561 (at [30] and [37]). He considered that this gave rise to an issue estoppel which meant that Lee Tat was not entitled to raise this issue afresh in the Fourth Action (at [43]).', '28\\u2003On appeal, the Court of Appeal affirmed Woo J\u2019s decision in the Fourth Action by a two-to-one majority. That decision is found at Lee Tat Development Pte Ltd v Management Corporation of Strata Title Plan No 301 [2005] 3 SLR(R) 157 (\u201cGrange Heights (No 4) (CA)\u201d). The majority agreed with Woo J that an issue estoppel had arisen because the judgments in the Second Action had \u201cfinally and conclusively determined\u201d that Grange Heights residents enjoyed the Right of Way over the Servient Tenement (Grange Heights (No 4) (CA) at [2]).', '29\\u2003Chao Hick Tin JA dissented, and took the view that no issue estoppel had arisen. He noted that the First and Second Actions had been decided at a time when Lee Tat was the owner of only two dominant tenements (ie, Lots 111-32 and 111-33), and not the owner of the Servient Tenement. The courts in the First and Second Action had therefore approached the issue purely as a matter of whether the use of the Servient Tenement by HLH or Grange Heights residents had interfered with Lee Tat\u2019s rights and interests as owner of Lots 111-32 and 111-33 (at [68]\u2013[69]). Yet the rights of the owner of a servient tenement were different from those of an owner of a dominant tenement, and the issue had not been decided as between the MCST and Lee Tat in its capacity as owner of the Servient Tenement. While Lee Tat had raised the Extension Issue in the Second Action, it had not been ruled upon because Lee Tat \u201ccould not really raise the issue of trespass\u201d, given that its rights were, at the time, purely those of the owner of a dominant tenement (Grange Heights (No 4) (CA) at [74]). Therefore, Lee Tat was not estopped from re-litigating this issue (at [82]). Applying the Harris v Flower principle, Chao JA held that Grange Heights could not extend the Right of Way to benefit Lot 561 because under the terms of the original grant, the Right of Way applied to only Lot 111-34 (at [61]).', '30\\u2003Following the conclusion of the Fourth Action, the Third Action came for hearing before Woo J. In Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 301 v Lee Tat Development Pte Ltd [2007] 2 SLR(R) 554 (\u201cGrange Heights (No 3) (HC)\u201d), Woo J held that the MCST was entitled to repair and maintain the Servient Tenement (at [6]).', '31\\u2003Woo J\u2019s decision was set aside by the Court of Appeal in Lee Tat Development Pte Ltd v Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 301 [2009] 1 SLR(R) 875 (\u201cGrange Heights (No 3) (CA)\u201d). As the Judge noted, this was the point at which \u201c[t]he tide turned\u201d (see the Judgment at [23]). In that decision, this court held that the majority of the Court of Appeal in the Fourth Action had erred in finding that issue estoppel arose. This court agreed with Chao JA\u2019s dissenting judgment in the Fourth Action (Grange Heights (No 3) (CA) at [44] and [67]). As Lee Tat\u2019s arguments in these appeals rely heavily on what was decided by the Court of Appeal in the Third Action, we summarise the findings reached in that decision in some detail:', '(a)\\u2003First, there was no need for the High Court and the Court of Appeal in the Second Action to decide the Amalgamation Issue. The MCST and Lee Tat were, at the time, fellow owners of dominant tenements, and neither was in a position to question the existence of the Right of Way vis-\u00e0-vis the other. Only an owner of the Servient Tenement could have done this. In so far as the courts in the Second Action had decided the Amalgamation Issue, such a decision bound Lee Tat only as the owner of Lots 111-32 and Lot 111-33, and not as the owner of the Servient Tenement (at [32(a)] and [32(e)]).', '(b)\\u2003Secondly, there was no need for the courts in the First and Second Actions to determine the Extension Issue (at [41]). The courts in both actions had effectively ruled that Collin, and later Lee Tat, were not competent to raise the Extension Issue (at [45]). It was not the owner of the Servient Tenement and therefore had no locus standi to raise the Extension issue. Thus, the decisions of the courts in the Second Action did not constitute a ruling on the merits of the Extension Issue (at [32(f)] and [32(g)]).', '(c)\\u2003Thirdly, any decisions made in the First and Second Actions could not have affected Lee Tat\u2019s rights as servient owner after it acquired the Servient Tenement in 1997. Further, the Extension Issue had not been decided in the First and Second Actions. Thus, in the Fourth Action, Lee Tat was not estopped from litigating any issue affecting its interests in the Right of Way in its capacity as owner of the Servient Tenement, including the Extension Issue (at [43(f)] and [82]\u2013[84]).', '(d)\\u2003Fourthly, the judgment of the majority in Grange Heights (No 4) (CA) contained an \u201cegregious error\u201d in so far as it stated that the Extension Issue had been decided in the MCST\u2019s favour in the Second Action. This had caused the grave injustice of preventing Lee Tat from raising the Extension Issue in the Fourth Action. The Arnold exception (see the House of Lords decision in Arnold v National Westminster Bank plc [1991] 2 AC 93) therefore applied to the finding in Grange Heights (No 4) (CA) that the Extension Issue was res judicata (at [80]\u2013[81]).', '32\\u2003The Court of Appeal then considered both the Amalgamation Issue and the Extension Issue afresh. In so far as the Extension Issue was concerned, the court held that the MCST could not seek to extend the benefit of the Right of Way to Lot 561, which was a non-dominant tenement, as that would exceed the terms of the grant and therefore breach the Harris v Flower principle (Grange Heights (No 3) (CA) at [91]\u2013[92]). In so far as the Amalgamation Issue was concerned, the court held that the Right of Way vis-\u00e0-vis Lot 111-34 had been extinguished by operation of law as a result of the amalgamation of Lots 111-34 and 561 (Grange Heights (No 3) (CA) at [93]).', '33\\u2003In June 2009, the MCST filed an application for an order to reconstitute the Court of Appeal to set aside its judgment in Grange Heights (No 3) (CA). It argued that there had been a breach of natural justice as the MCST had not been heard on the Arnold exception in the Third Action. It then filed an application to the High Court (\u201cthe Fifth Action\u201d) to determine the preliminary question of whether the Court of Appeal could be reconstituted to hear an application to set aside its own judgment. The application was heard by Choo Han Teck J, who in Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 301 v Lee Tat Development Pte Ltd [2010] 1 SLR 645, held that the Court of Appeal should not be reconstituted, because even if the MCST had been deprived of an opportunity to be heard on the Arnold exception, this was not so grave a procedural wrong as to warrant reopening the case (at [11]). Choo J therefore dismissed the application. This decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal in Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 301 v Lee Tat Development Pte Ltd [2011] 1 SLR 998 (\u201cGrange Heights (No 5) (CA)\u201d), albeit based on different reasoning. For present purposes, it is unnecessary to explain the details of this court\u2019s findings in Grange Heights (No 5) (CA). It should be noted, however, that one of the court\u2019s reasons for affirming Choo J\u2019s decision to dismiss the application by the MCST was that it would not serve any useful purpose to allow the application. The Court held that in so far as the application had been brought as a precursor to an attempt to set aside the judgment in Grange Heights (No 3) (CA), it would not serve any useful purpose because the Court in Grange Heights (No 3) (CA) had set aside the judgment in Grange Heights (No 4) (CA) not only based on the Arnold exception but on \u201cthree separate and distinct grounds\u201d (Grange Heights (No 5) (CA) at [66]), including a finding that the Extension Issue had never been decided on the merits.', '34\\u2003As will become clear later in this judgment, Lee Tat relies heavily on that finding to convince this court that the Judge had erred in dismissing its claim in trespass in the present set of proceedings.'"}
{"casename":"2018_SGCA_51","fact":"the facts, we find that Northstar had abandoned its right of proof \nagainst the Appellant\u2019s bankruptcy estate.  \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nLee Chen  Seong Jeremy v Official Assignee [2018] SGCA 51\n1028 As a starting point, we observe  that undue  emphasis was placed  on s 346 \nof the Companies Act. Seen in its proper context, this provision  is nothing more \nthan a sweep-up or catch-all provision. According to the existing  statutory  \nregime and the practice that prevailed  at the relevant  time in relation to the \nstriking off of companies, when a company  seeks to dissolve  itself,  it should  \nresolve all outstanding matters; specifically, it must ensure that it has \naccounted for all its liabilities  and dealt away  all its assets. Regulation  2(3)(b) \nof the Companies (Striking Off) Regulations 2015 (S 834\/2015),  which was \npromulgated with a view to set out the then-existing  practice in legislation (see \npara 60 of Chapter 5 of the Report of the Steering Committee  for Review of the \nCompanies Act (April  2011) and para 85 of the Ministry of Finance\u2019s Responses  \nto the Report of the Steering Committee  for Review  of the Companies  Act (3 \nOctober 2012)), states that one of the conditions that must be fulfilled  before a \ncompany can be struck  off the Register is that the company must  have \u201cno assets \nor contingent assets and no pending liability or  contingent liability\u201d. \n29 But even  with the best will in the world, the intention  to resolve the \ncompany\u2019s affairs before dissolution may not always be accomplished. This \npresents a particular problem where a company\u2019s  assets are concerned. The \ncompany may ordinarily be taken to know what its assets are but occasionally,  \nit might mistakenly or inadvertently fail to deal with an asset before dissolution . \nThat is where s 346 of the Companies Act comes in: if it should transpire that \nthere is, in fact, an asset  in existence that has not been dealt with,  it would vest \nin the OR for her to deal with. That is all s 346 does and it should not be given \ngreater significance than this.\n30 What the OA seems to be suggesting is that the significance of s 346 of \nthe Companies Act ought to be enlarged such that because of the existence  of \nthat provision, any apparent asset is presumed to exist  and would vest in the OR \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nLee Chen  Seong Jeremy v Official Assignee [2018] SGCA 51\n11at the time of striking off. On this view, even  though  the now-defunct creditor,  \nNorthstar, has not done anything to transfer  its interest in the right in question \nto the OR, the OR would, by virtue  of s 346 of the Companies Act, have \nsucceeded to that right.\n31 We reject this suggestion. As a preliminary  point, we note that it is \nultimately a question of fact, to be determined on the basis of all the evidence,  \nas to whether the asset remains in existence  as an asset  of the company that was \nnot dealt with in the course of its dissolution such that it should now be dealt \nwith under  s 346 of the Companies Act. It might be that the inferences to be \ndrawn in such circumstances  might be different  depending on whether one is \ndealing with tangible property or intangible property. But either way, in our \nview, the question of whether a company\u2019s asset continues to exist or not after \nits striking-off should be analysed on the basis of the facts as they stood \nimmediately prior  to the dissolution. If the said asset is found to exist even after \nthe dissolution of the company,  then and only then would s 346 of the \nCompanies Act come into the picture.\n32 In the present case, our analysis  of the relevant facts at the time of \nstriking off leads us to conclude that Northstar  had overtly abandoned,  with the \nrequisite subjective intent, its right to participate  in any payout from  the \nAppellant\u2019s estate. There are three  pieces  of evidence that support this \nconclusion. \n33 First, there are the declarations  made  at the time of dissolution. As \nmentioned above at [5], when Northstar  was being dissolved, its directors made \ndeclarations to the effect that the company no longer  had contingent assets  and \nthat all its assets had been cleared. The directors ought to be taken to know  what  \nthe assets  of the company were and their statements may be taken  at face value.  \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nLee Chen  Seong Jeremy v Official Assignee [2018] SGCA 51\n12Taken at face value, such statements could only mean  that as far as the directors \nwere concerned,  Northstar had given up its right of proof and did not intend to \npursue it. There  is no reason why we should go behind this to conclude that the \ndeclarations did not extend to the right of proof of the Northstar debt, or to insist \nnow on the need for specific proof that the creditor intended  to give up or \nabandon this particular right. Significantly, the OA does not claim to have \ncontacted the former directors or promoters of the company to query whether \nthey had simply overlooked the Northstar debt,  or whether they retained any \nintention of claiming  what they could  out of Northstar\u2019s right of proof  despite \nthe declarations suggesting the contrary at the time of the application to strike \nthe company off the  Register. \n34 The OA seemed to take the position that the declarations could not be \ntaken at face value because  there were moneys in the Appellant\u2019s estate after \nthe date of the declarations. But on that premise,  the OA seems to us to be \nputting the cart before the horse. Any right against the bankruptcy estate is a \nright that accrues to a creditor only to the extent  that the creditor  continues to \nhold the intention to retain that right of proof even after and in spite of the \ndeclarations it had made suggesting the contrary.  It cannot be gainsaid that if \nthe creditor had subjectively intended  to relinquish  that right completely and \nunreservedly, it could  have done  so and the right of proof would then have been  \nextinguished. That the right of proof could not have  been abandoned at the time \nthe declarations were made, as suggested by the OA, because there was now the \npossibility of  a payment is a  non sequitur and indeed, it begs the question. \n35 The OA also submitted that no reliance could  be placed on the \ndeclarations as they were  made for the purpose  of securing the application to \nstrike Northstar off the Register. We were unable to follow this. Whatever  the \npurpose for which the declaration  was made,  its broad  and unlimited terms \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nLee Chen  Seong Jeremy v Official Assignee [2018] SGCA 51\n13constituted a representation that Northstar had no other assets and this plainly \ncomprehended contingent assets as well, such as the right to a dividend out of \nthe Appellant\u2019s estate  in bankruptcy. We could see no reason  at all for assuming \nthat the declarations must have been  made  either mistakenly  or fraudulently, as \nthe OA sought to suggest might be the case. There was absolutely no evidence \nto support such a  hypothesis.  \n36 Second,  the accounts of the company appended  to the striking-off \napplication support the conclusion that Northstar  had abandoned its right of \nproof. Neither the proof nor the debt featured in Northstar\u2019s accounts,  and in the \ncase of an intangible property like the right of proof, the act of taking  the \nproperty off the balance  sheet  would seem  to be a clear indication  of its \nabandonment; in the instant case, it signalled Northstar\u2019s intention to write off \nthe debt and that Northstar no longer  wished to pursue it. \n37 Finally, there is Northstar\u2019s conduct in relation to other debts. While \nNorthstar did write to NSH intimating a waiver (see [15] above),  that does not \nmake the case weaker in relation  to the present  proof  because that was for a debt \nthat did appear in the financial statements  appended  to Northstar\u2019s  striking off \napplication. On the contrary, it could be seen as corroborative of Northstar\u2019s \nintention to abandon its interest in the outstanding amounts generally due to it \nand on that basis,  this would  extend  to its right of proof in relation  to the \nNorthstar debt.  In short, its willingness to write off the remaining debt on its \nbooks suggested that it could very well similarly have given up on (if it had not \nalready) the possibility  of a payout  in respect of the Northstar debt in order to \nsecure its dissolution. It would be recalled that Northstar had itself  struck off \nsome six years after it filed its proof in the Appellant\u2019s bankruptcy estate, a long \nenough period for it to have concluded that the prospect of recovering a cent \nfrom the estate was  highly  remote.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nLee Chen  Seong Jeremy v Official Assignee [2018] SGCA 51\n1438 Taken together, we are satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the \nproper inference to be drawn in all the circumstances  is that Northstar  intended \nto and did abandon  its right to participate in payment out of the Appellant\u2019s \nestate in bankruptcy. Accordingly, s 346 becomes irrelevant because that \nsection only kicks in if there is an asset  that has not been accounted for and on \nthe above analysis there is no such asset. \n39 On this view  of the case, because  we see this not as an instance where \nthere had been a mistake or inadvertence in relation  to the existence and dealing \nof a company\u2019s existing assets before its dissolution (which could then trigger \nthe operation of s 346 of the Companies  Act), but as one where the right in \nquestion had been abandoned, the proper conclusion  is that the right in question \nwas no  longer an asset of the company\u2019s  after the declarations had been made. \n40 The facts of the case of Re Fivestar Properties Limited [2015]  EWHC  \n2782 (Ch) (\u201cFivestar\u201d) illustrate this point. In that case, a bank  had provided a \nloan facility  to Fivestar Properties Ltd (the \u201cCompany\u201d)  which was secured  by \nway of a legal charge over the freehold in commercial premises (the \u201cProperty\u201d) \nowned by the Company which had been leased to a large  commercial tenant. \nThe Company defaulted on repayment. Administrators  that were subsequently \nappointed sought to dissolve the Company. The administrators\u2019 final report \nstated that there were  no further assets to be realised (at [6]), although the \nsame report later acknowledged that the freehold was still vested in the \nCompany. The Company was dissolved. On dissolution, the assets remaining in \nthe Company\u2019s  ownership (ie, the Property) vested in the Crown as bona \nvacantia under s 1012 of the Companies Act 2006 (c 46) (UK).  The Crown  later \ndisclaimed interest in the Property, and subsequent to that, the bank  restored the \nCompany to the UK Companies Register and the Property re-vested in the \nCompany as  if it had  never been dissolved (at [23]).  \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nLee Chen  Seong Jeremy v Official Assignee [2018] SGCA 51\n1541 Despite the declaration made  by the administrators in Fivestar , it was \nevident that they had been  mistaken  about  the Company\u2019s assets (as Cooke  J \nalluded to at [6] of Fivestar). There was an asset (the Property) that had not been \naccounted for and this was expressly referred to in the report filed by the \nadministrators. That is quite unlike  the present case where Northstar\u2019s actions \nand conduct, as seen in its accounts which did not include this debt, its \ndeclarations in the application to be struck off the Register and its waiver  of a \ndebt owed by another  debtor, all point towards  an intention  to abandon  this right \nof proof.\nConcluding remarks\n42 We therefore  allow"}

At the material time, Dr Sunil Kumar Sethi (\u201cDr Sethi\u201d) was Chief of the Department of Laboratory Medicine and Senior Consultant Chemical Pathologist at NUH, while Mr Peter Lim (\u201cMr Lim\u201d) was the Principal Medical Technologist with NUH\u2019s Department of Laboratory Medicine. 3', '5\\u2003In 2004, NHG embarked on a project to digitise the clinical care processes in its hospitals. NUH initially had a combination of manual and electronic processes for its clinical care workflows. Doctors ordered laboratory tests for patients on hard copy forms. The information was then keyed into an electronic system known as the Laboratory Information System (\u201cLIS\u201d). The digitisation project contemplated the development of an Electronic Medical Records (\u201cEMR\u201d) system to computerise the records kept by NHG\u2019s hospitals. For specimen testing in the laboratory, NHG envisioned a Computerised Physician Order Entry (\u201cCPOE\u201d) system which would enable doctors to order medical tests electronically. 4', 'In November 2004, NHG called for proposals for these processes and systems and appointed a vendor in June 2005 for the supply and implementation of the EMR system. 5', '6\\u2003However, an additional component pertaining to sample collection was still required in order for NUH to have a complete electronic laboratory trail from test-ordering through to result-reporting. 6', 'NUH decided that a software should be developed for this purpose.

It is not disputed that Dr Sethi, Mr Lim, Dr Poo and Dr Ratty were each involved in the project in some capacity.

The station is linked to a specimen processing system which does two things. First, the system determines and relays the requirements for the specimen to be taken from the patient for the particular test ordered. This includes the type, the number and the colour of the tubes and the amount of specimen to collect from the patient. Second, the processing system aggregates information relating to the specimen, such as the patient identification code, patient name, the unique laboratory analyser test accession number for a specimen, etc, and relays them to the specimen collection system such that a label is printed onsite for the tube and to be affixed to the specimen tube.', '11\\u2003On 27 July 2012, three days before the expiry of two years from the date of grant of the Patent, NUH filed the Reference with the Registrar under s 47(1) of the Act for a determination of entitlement to the Patent.

Consequently, on 17 March 2015, NUH filed Originating Summons No 239 of 2015 (\u201cthe High Court Proceedings\u201d) in the High Court pursuant to O 87A r 8 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (\u201cROC\u201d), which allows the referral of entitlement proceedings to the High Court. NUH sought two main orders:', '(a)\\u2003that NUH be named as the sole proprietor of the Patent, or alternatively, as a joint proprietor of the Patent together with Cicada; and', '(b)\\u2003that Dr Sethi and\/or Mr Lim be named as the rightful inventor(s) of the Patent in place of Dr Poo and Dr Ratty, or alternatively, as joint inventor(s) of the Patent together with Dr Poo and Dr Ratty.', '13\\u2003Cicada opposed NUH\u2019s application on three main grounds. First, it contended that NUH was out of time under s 47(9) of the Act, which required an application to the court for determination be commenced within two years from the date of grant of the Patent. Second, it argued that Dr Ratty and Dr Poo of Cicada were the sole inventors of the inventive concepts disclosed in the Patent. Third, it argued that even if Dr Sethi were the inventor, he was not an employee of NUH but was employed by the National University of Singapore (\u201cNUS\u201d). Accordingly, NUH was not entitled to ownership of the Patent.'"}

Following from this, a number of transactions took place involving WM, its two Shareholders and the Taxpayer. We attach in the Annexures to this judgment two diagrams tendered by the CIT to the Income Tax Board of Review (\u201cITBR\u201d) to aid in the understanding of the said transactions and the flow of funds resulting from them.', '4\\u2003On 27 October 2004, WM raised $520m by a bond issue. Of the $520m raised, the Shareholders subscribed to $205m of subordinated junior bonds. 1', 'The Shareholders considered it crucial for them to subscribe to these junior bonds because, first, it would have been \u201cpractically impossible\u201d to find third party investors willing to subscribe to these bonds at the interest rate of 4.05%, and second, the Shareholders\u2019 subscription would signal confidence in the Mall\u2019s performance to other potential investors. 2', '5\\u2003Subsequently, WM lent the $520m raised from the bond issue to the Taxpayer under a facility agreement (\u201cthe WM Loan\u201d) at an effective interest rate of 3.728% per annum. 3', 'The WM Loan was made in consideration of periodic interest payable by the Taxpayer to WM and was secured by, among other things: 4', '(a)\\u2003a fixed charge over a set of accounts to be opened and maintained by the Taxpayer, and', '(b)\\u2003an assignment of the Taxpayer\u2019s rights over the tenancy agreements and rental income from the Mall.', '6\\u2003The amount of the WM Loan, ie, $520m, was in line with the full market value of the Mall, which was valued in 2004 at $525m. 5', 'According to the Taxpayer, it chose to assign its rights to the rental income from the Mall as security for the WM Loan so that it could continue to own and operate the Mall, which was at that time its only income-earning asset. 6', '7\\u2003The Taxpayer applied the $520m obtained from the WM Loan in the following manner:', '(a)\\u2003$170m was used to refinance pre-existing borrowings;', '(b)\\u2003$17m was used as working capital; and', '(c)\\u2003$333m was lent to the Shareholders pursuant to loan agreements dated 20 October 2004, under which $166.5m was advanced to each Shareholder on an unsecured basis at an interest rate of 3.78% per annum (\u201cthe Shareholder Advances\u201d). 7', 'The stated purpose of the Shareholder Advances was to enable the Shareholders to subscribe to the subordinated junior bonds issued by WM 8', 'and to allow their use as general working capital. 9', '8\\u2003Following the Securitisation Exercise, the Taxpayer\u2019s primary income-generating assets were (a) the interest income from the Shareholder Advances 10', 'and (b) the rental income from the Mall. For the financial years ending 31 December 2004 through to 2008, the Taxpayer\u2019s total assets ranged between approximately $889m and $996m. During this period, the Mall was valued at between $525m and $614m while the Shareholder Advances remained at a consistent $333m. 11', '9\\u2003At the same time, the Taxpayer had to pay WM interest on the WM Loan. CIT allowed the Taxpayer to deduct the full amount of interest expense incurred on the WM Loan under s 14(1)(a) of the ITA. 12', '10\\u2003Following the Securitisation Exercise, the Taxpayer engaged in a two-step restructuring of its capital structure, involving first the Capital Reduction Exercise and thereafter the issuance of the Shareholder Bonds.', '11\\u2003Prior to 26 November 2004, the Taxpayer had a paid-up share capital of $10.2m. 13', 'On 26 November 2004, at an extraordinary general meeting of the Taxpayer, the Shareholders resolved to reduce the share capital of the Taxpayer by the following steps: 14', '(a)\\u2003capitalise a sum of $325.3m (comprising $37m from retained earnings, $268.3m from the asset revaluation reserve and $20m from the capital redemption reserve); and thereafter,', '(b)\\u2003reduce its share capital by $333m (from $335.5m to $2.5m) by a return of the sum to the Shareholders in proportion to their shareholding.', '12\\u2003On 2 December 2004, the Capital Reduction Exercise was approved by the High Court. 15', 'This brought about two consequences: (a) the Taxpayer was left with a paid-up share capital of only $2.5m and (b) a debt of $333m became immediately due and payable by the Taxpayer to the Shareholders.', '13\\u2003On 15 December 2004, 16', 'in place of the debt of $333m immediately due to the Shareholders, 17', 'the Taxpayer decided to issue the Shareholder Bonds, which were fixed rate subordinated bonds for an aggregate amount of $333m.

Unlike dividends, interest payments are independent of the Taxpayer\u2019s ability to service the WM Loan. 23', 'This restructuring therefore addressed the anticipated problem that the Taxpayer\u2019s ability to pay dividends would be heavily curtailed after the Securitisation Exercise. Further, interest payments also allowed the Shareholders\u2019 return on investment to be exempted from capital maintenance rules imposed by the Companies Act (Cap 19, 2008 Rev Ed). 24', '(b)\\u2003Second, it was said that the restructuring of the Shareholders\u2019 investment was \u201ctimely\u201d given the transition from an imputation system to a one-tier system of taxing corporate profits. 25', '16\\u2003Between 2005 and 2009, the Taxpayer paid interest of 7.1% per annum to the Shareholders on the Shareholder Bonds (\u201cthe Interest Expense\u201d).', '17\\u2003The deductibility of the Interest Expense under s 14(1)(a) of the ITA is the subject of contention here and below.

Senda and Well Prospering are both wholly-owned subsidiaries of Longsheng; in effect, therefore, Longsheng is the company\u2019s ultimate majority shareholder. The Company has five directors, and under the Company\u2019s shareholder agreement, three were to be appointed by Longsheng and two by Kiri Industries. Kiri Industries appointed the appellant and Mr Manishkumar Pravinchandra Kiri. Longsheng appointed the Longsheng directors. Mr Ruan was appointed as the chairman of the board of directors.', '5\\u2003Sometime before July 2014, concerns were raised over loans that had been made by the Company to entities related to Longsheng. The directors of the Company got round to discussing borrowing conditions for such related party loans, and in October 2014, the directors of the Company agreed on a set of such conditions (\u201cthe Borrowing Conditions\u201d). These conditions, in essence, stipulated that related party loans would only be approved if the total amount loaned was no greater than the cash margins that Longsheng had provided to guarantee the Company\u2019s bank borrowings; in addition, the interest rates charged by the Company for the related party loans were not to be lower than the Company\u2019s own borrowing costs. In short, the Company should not be subsiding the borrowing costs of the related parties; nor should the Company be granting loans to related parties to an extent greater than that to which Longsheng was securing the Company\u2019s bank borrowings.', '6\\u2003In January 2015, Mr Manishkumar wrote to the Longsheng directors, requesting them to declare dividends for the preceding financial year, 2014, on the basis that the Company had made profits after making provisions to clear past year losses. The Longsheng directors replied a couple of days later, informing Mr Manishkumar that it would not be appropriate to declare dividends because the Company had a high level of expenses and required large sums of working capital.', '7\\u2003On 14 February 2015, the appellant e-mailed Mr Xu to find out about a reference to related party loans exceeding $90m in \u201cBoard papers\u201d presented at a previous board meeting, further noting that the cash margins for the last quarter of 2014 had not been confirmed. After exchanging a number of e-mails with Mr Xu and his representative, the appellant discovered that two related party loans for US$20m and US$80m had been granted without the prior knowledge and approval of the appellant and Kiri Industries.', '8\\u2003In April 2015, the appellant also discovered that the Borrowing Conditions had been breached for the months between September and December 2014. Subsequently, the appellant made a series of requests for documents and information, but these efforts were blocked as Mr Ruan had instructed the management of the Company to route the appellant\u2019s requests through the board instead.', '9\\u2003On 26 June 2015, Kiri Industries commenced proceedings against Senda and the Company in the High Court, seeking relief on the ground of minority oppression.

He noted that it was important for board members to be kept apprised of the financial affairs and management of the Company, and requested documents relating to the Company\u2019s and its subsidiaries\u2019 accounts (including profit and loss statements, balance sheets, loan documentation, investments, etc).', '11\\u2003On 1 August 2015, the appellant received replies from Senda, the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Mr Eric Hopmann, and the Longsheng directors. Both Senda and Mr Hopmann deferred to the decision of the board of directors. The Longsheng directors refused to comply with the appellant\u2019s requests, taking the position that the appellant\u2019s requests were made in furtherance of the minority oppression suit, and that the information sought could be used to commit further possible breaches of the non-competition clause (see [9] above). The Longsheng directors also told the appellant that they were willing to meet to discuss the requests for information and sought responses from the appellant in respect of any wrongful competition that Kiri Industries was engaging in. It should be noted, however, that the Judge formed the view that the Longsheng directors in fact had no intention of acceding to any part of the appellant\u2019s request in the 18 July 2015 letter (Mukherjee Amitava v DyStar Global Holdings (Singapore) Pte Ltd [2017] SGHC 314 (\u201cJudgment\u201d) at [95]).', '12\\u2003The appellant filed the Inspection Application on 15 September 2015, about six weeks after the Longsheng directors\u2019 reply.

The first hearing of the Inspection Application took place on 17 August 2016, and the Judge granted an adjournment to let the parties attempt to reach an agreement on the scope of inspection.

{"casename":"2018_SGCA_58","fact":"'3\\u2003We begin with a brief overview of the background to these appeals. Mr Goel is a Singapore permanent resident, while RWS is the owner and operator of the casino at Resorts World Sentosa (\u201cthe Casino\u201d). Mr Goel visited the Casino on the night of 21 April 2012. After a quarrel erupted between Mr Goel and two other patrons of the Casino in the early hours of the morning of 22 April 2012, Mr Goel was escorted by the Casino\u2019s security staff, comprising both RWS\u2019s own security officers and SATS\u2019s auxiliary police officers (\u201cAPOs\u201d), into a separate room, where he was detained for several hours before being escorted out of the Casino (\u201cthe Incident\u201d). Mr Goel sustained injuries to his shoulder during the Incident.', '4\\u2003On 29 May 2013, Mr Goel commenced the Suit against RWS, claiming that RWS was vicariously liable for the acts of assault, battery and wrongful imprisonment committed by both RWS\u2019s security officers and SATS\u2019s APOs, and that RWS was negligent in failing to keep him safe and secure while he was within its premises. Mr Goel eventually quantified his claim on 29 May 2015 at a total sum of S$484,196.16, comprising damages for the pain and suffering and loss of amenities arising from the injuries that he had sustained, loss of liberty for about an hour, medical and transport costs incurred as a result of his injuries, loss of pre-trial income, loss of his year-long membership at the Casino, loss of the credit that he had accumulated in his Genting Rewards Gold Card, as well as for aggravated and exemplary damages for the \u201chaughty and high-handed attitude\u201d that RWS had allegedly displayed during and after the Incident. 1', '5\\u2003On 19 November 2013, RWS joined SATS as a third party to the Suit, seeking from SATS an indemnity or contribution in respect of Mr Goel\u2019s claim and the costs of the Suit (\u201cthe Third Party Proceedings\u201d). 2', 'The Third Party Proceedings against SATS was grounded on a contractual indemnity provided for in a letter of agreement entered into between RWS and SATS on 31 August 2009 for SATS to provide security services at the Casino. The relevant terms of the agreement stated as follows: 3', '6\\u2003Pursuant to these terms, SATS would be contractually liable to indemnify RWS should the latter be found liable to Mr Goel for the actions of SATS\u2019s APOs in respect of any failure on the part of SATS\u2019s APOs to \u201cuse reasonable skill and care\u201d in the provision of security services or SATS to \u201cprovide adequate supervision to reasonably ensure correct performance of [s]ecurity [s]ervices\u201d. 4', '7\\u2003On 2 July 2014, RWS and SATS made a joint offer to fully and finally settle Mr Goel\u2019s claim for damages in the Suit for S$62,000, with all parties to bear their own costs (\u201cthe First Offer\u201d). 5', 'Mr Goel rejected the First Offer. On 17 September 2014, RWS and SATS made another joint offer, this time offering an increased amount of S$100,000 in full and final settlement of Mr Goel\u2019s claim for damages and interest in the Suit and for costs to be in accordance with O 22A of the ROC (\u201cthe Second Offer\u201d). 6', 'Mr Goel also rejected the Second Offer. Both the First Offer and the Second Offer will be collectively referred to as \u201cthe Offers\u201d.', '8\\u2003Following the trial of the Suit, the Judge found in favour of Mr Goel and awarded him S$45,915.74 in damages, which was a fraction of his claim amount: see Goel Adesh Kumar v Resorts World at Sentosa Pte Ltd (SATS Security Services Pte Ltd, third party) [2015] SGHC 289 (\u201cthe Liability Judgment\u201d) at [50]. In particular, the Judge held that RWS\u2019s security officers were 80% liable and SATS\u2019s APOs were 20% liable in respect of the torts of wrongful imprisonment, assault and battery committed against Mr Goel (at [19]\u2013[23] and [28]), but rejected the claims: (a) in negligence (at [31]); (b) for damages for pre-trial loss of earnings (at [42]\u2013[44]); and (c) for aggravated and exemplary damages (at [47]\u2013[48]). The Judge also found that RWS and SATS were respectively vicariously liable only for the tortious acts of their respective employees (at [24]\u2013[26]), such that RWS was only liable to pay Mr Goel 80% of the damages awarded, whereas SATS was not liable to pay Mr Goel the remaining 20% because it was not a defendant in the Suit (at [27] and [32]). As for the Third Party Proceedings commenced by RWS against SATS, the Judge held that it was \u201credundant\u201d, given that RWS was vicariously liable only for the acts of its own security officers (and not the APOs), such that there was no basis for RWS to claim an indemnity or contribution from SATS for any damages ordered against it (at [29]\u2013[30]).', '9\\u2003On 1 December 2015, Mr Goel filed Civil Appeal No 215 of 2015, which was an appeal against, among other things, the Judge\u2019s dismissal in the Liability Judgment of his claims for damages for negligence, pre-trial loss of earnings as well as for aggravated and exemplary damages, and named both RWS and SATS as co-respondents to the appeal. 7', 'On 11 December 2015, SATS filed Court of Appeal Summons No 329 of 2015 (\u201cSUM 329\u201d), seeking to strike out the Notice of Appeal insofar as SATS was named as a co-respondent to the appeal. We granted SUM 329 on 31 March 2016. On 17 August 2016, this Court dismissed the appeal. 8', '10\\u2003The issue of costs of the Suit was remitted to the Judge, who issued the Costs Judgment on 9 March 2017. The Judge held that: (a) RWS was to pay Mr Goel\u2019s costs of the Suit on a standard basis on the Magistrate\u2019s Court scale up to 2 July 2014 (ie, the date of the First Offer) (at [9] and [13(a)]); and (b) Mr Goel was to pay RWS\u2019s costs of the Suit on an indemnity basis on the High Court scale from 2 July 2014 (at [9] and [13(b)]).', '11\\u2003As for the costs for the Third Party Proceedings, the Judge held that RWS was to pay 80% of SATS\u2019s costs on a standard basis on the High Court scale (at [13(c)]). The Judge reasoned that first, SATS (and not RWS) was entitled to costs in the Third Party Proceedings given that RWS was vicariously liable only for the acts of its own security officers (and not SATS\u2019s APOs), and hence no question of indemnity against SATS arose for determination (at [11]). Second, RWS (and not Mr Goel) should be liable for SATS\u2019s costs in the Third Party Proceedings because Mr Goel, as the plaintiff in the Suit, had the right to choose not to make SATS a defendant in the Suit, and had in fact substantially succeeded (in terms of liability but not the quantum) in his claim against RWS. Mr Goel would be liable for costs of the Third Party Proceedings only if the real issue of the Suit turned out to be between Mr Goel and SATS, or RWS was clearly the wrong party to sue; neither of these scenarios presented themselves in the Suit (at [12]). Consequently, the Judge considered it fair to order RWS to pay 80% of SATS\u2019s costs in the Third Party Proceedings.', '12\\u2003On 29 June 2017, the Judge granted the application by RWS in Summons No 1264 of 2017 (\u201cSUM 1264\u201d) seeking leave to appeal against the Judge\u2019s decision in not ordering Mr Goel to indemnify it in respect of SATS\u2019s costs incurred in the Third Party Proceedings. 9', 'RWS duly filed its Notice of Appeal on 24 July 2017. 10', '13\\u2003On 2 October 2017, Mr Goel filed Summons No 4600 of 2017 (\u201cSUM 4600\u201d), seeking an extension of time from the High Court for leave to appeal against the Costs Judgment. 11', 'Although the Judge granted Mr Goel leave to appeal out of time, Mr Goel failed to file a Notice of Appeal accompanied by a certificate for security for costs on time. 12', 'On 20 December 2017, Mr Goel filed Court of Appeal Originating Summons No 24 of 2017 (\u201cOS 24\u201d), seeking leave, this time from the Court of Appeal, to file and serve a Notice of Appeal against the Costs Judgement out of time. 13', '14\\u2003At the hearing fixed for both RWS\u2019s Appeal and OS 24 on 6 February 2018, we allowed OS 24, and adjourned RWS\u2019s Appeal to be heard together with Mr Goel\u2019s Appeal.

At the material time, both Tan and the Appellant resided in Malaysia.', '9\\u2003As will become evident from the narration of the facts, the case against the Appellant was somewhat unusual.

Hence, the presumptions in ss 17 and 18 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe MDA\u201d) as to possession, the purpose of possession and knowledge of the nature of the drugs did not apply. The Prosecution\u2019s case against the Appellant at the trial was largely based on Tan\u2019s testimony that he had taken delivery of the drugs from the Appellant, who had also directed him on the persons to whom and the sequence in which he was to deliver the drugs. In addition, the Prosecution relied on DNA evidence retrieved from strips of tape that were used to cover the bundles of drugs, as well as forensic evidence recovered from the handphones of the Appellant and Tan (\u201cthe Handphone Evidence\u201d). Having outlined the case against the Appellant, we now fill in the details with the material facts.', '10\\u2003On 21 February 2014 at about 5.58am, Tan drove into Singapore through Tuas Checkpoint.', '11\\u2003Later that day, at about 6.45am, Tan delivered a blue bag containing three bundles of drugs (\u201cthe Blue Bag\u201d) to one Low Johnnie (\u201cLow\u201d) at City Plaza, a shopping mall located at 810 Geylang Road. Shortly thereafter, officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (\u201cCNB\u201d) arrested Tan and Low.', '12\\u2003The CNB officers seized the Blue Bag, which was later marked \u201cB\u201d, and the three bundles of drugs in it. During the investigations, the three bundles of drugs were cut open, and each bundle was found to contain a Ziploc bag of powdery substance. Each Ziploc bag was covered with cling wrap, with several layers of black tape applied over the whole of the cling wrap. The cling wrap and black tape used to cover the three bundles were marked \u201cB1\u201d, \u201cB2\u201d and \u201cB3\u201d respectively, and the corresponding Ziploc bags beneath the cling wrap and black tape were marked \u201cB1A\u201d, \u201cB2A\u201d and \u201cB3A\u201d respectively. B1A, B2A and B3A were submitted to the Illicit Drugs Laboratory of the Health Sciences Authority (\u201cthe HSA\u201d) for analysis and were found to contain a total of not less than 21.74g of diamorphine. These drugs formed the subject matter of the first charge against the Appellant.', '13\\u2003After arresting Tan, the CNB officers searched his car and recovered a white plastic bag containing seven bundles of drugs. This white plastic bag was the Jorano bag of drugs, which the Prosecution claimed the Appellant had handed to Tan (see [7] above). It was later marked \u201cA1\u201d. The seven bundles of drugs in it were cut open during the investigations and were found to contain the following:', '(a)\\u2003Three of the bundles of drugs were each found to contain a Ziploc bag of crystalline substance. Like the Ziploc bags referred to in the preceding paragraph, the Ziploc bag in each of these three bundles was covered with cling wrap, with several layers of black tape applied over the whole of the cling wrap. The cling wrap and black tape coverings of these three bundles were marked \u201cA1A\u201d, \u201cA1B\u201d and \u201cA1C\u201d respectively, and the corresponding Ziploc bags beneath the coverings were marked \u201cA1A1\u201d, \u201cA1B1\u201d and \u201cA1C1\u201d in turn. Upon analysis by the HSA, A1A1, A1B1 and A1C1 were found to contain a total of not less than 323.7g of methamphetamine. These drugs formed the subject matter of the second charge against the Appellant.', '(b)\\u2003The remaining four bundles of drugs were each found to contain a packet of tablets. As in the case of the Ziploc bags mentioned at [12] and [13(a)] above, each packet of tablets was covered with cling wrap and black tape. The coverings of the four packets of tablets were marked \u201cA1D\u201d, \u201cA1E\u201d, \u201cA1F\u201d and \u201cA1G\u201d respectively, and a separate piece of cling wrap found in the bundle covered by A1D was marked \u201cA1D1\u201d. The corresponding packets of tablets in the four bundles were marked \u201cA1D1A\u201d, \u201cA1E1\u201d, \u201cA1F1\u201d and \u201cA1G1\u201d respectively. Upon analysis by the HSA, the tablets were found to contain nimetazepam. These drugs formed the subject matter of the third charge against the Appellant, which the Prosecution did not proceed with at the trial (see [4] above).', '14\\u2003In the course of Tan\u2019s arrest, the CNB officers also seized three handphones from him: a Sony Ericsson handphone (\u201cTKH-HP1\u201d), a Nokia handphone (\u201cTKH-HP2\u201d) and a Samsung handphone (\u201cTKH-HP3\u201d).', '15\\u2003On 21 February 2014, a contemporaneous statement and three cautioned statements were recorded from Tan. In these statements, Tan denied knowing what the contents of the ten bundles of drugs recovered in the course of his arrest (\u201cthe Ten Bundles\u201d) (see [12]\u2013[13] above) were.', '16\\u2003On 24 February 2014, Tan provided a long statement to the CNB in which he stated the following:', '(a)\\u2003On 20 February 2014 at around 7.00pm, he received a call on TKH-HP3 from the number +601 46125901 (\u201cthe Untraced Number\u201d), which belonged to one \u201cAh Jun\u201d. Ah Jun told Tan that there was a job for him the next day. The job was to deliver drugs to persons in Singapore. Tan, who had been delivering drugs to recipients in Singapore since September 2013, agreed to carry out the job as outlined by Ah Jun.', '(b)\\u2003Later that evening at around 9.00pm, Tan called a Chinese man. According to Tan, Ah Jun and this Chinese man were the coordinators of the operation: they would pack the drugs and then direct him to deliver the bundles of drugs to the intended recipients. The Chinese man told Tan that he was to deliver three bundles each of \u201cShao Shui\u201d and \u201cBing\u201d and four bundles of \u201cYu Ruo\u201d. These were the bundles of diamorphine, methamphetamine and nimetazepam respectively.', '(c)\\u2003At around 4.00am on 21 February 2014, Tan drove to Ah Jun\u2019s home to collect the drugs. According to Tan, \u201cAh Jun then passed [him] the drugs in 1 white plastic bag\u201d. This white plastic bag was the Jorano bag of drugs. It contained the Blue Bag and the Ten Bundles. Importantly, on Tan\u2019s account, the Ten Bundles had all been pre-packed and he had not been involved in packing any of them.', '(d)\\u2003Tan put the Jorano bag of drugs into his car and drove to Singapore. After arriving in Singapore, he received text messages sent by Ah Jun using the Untraced Number. These were the Delivery Messages, which, according to the Prosecution, were sent by the Appellant (see [7] above). In the messages, Ah Jun gave Tan the contact numbers of the two persons to whom he was to deliver the drugs. Ah Jun also informed Tan of the sequence in which he was to deliver the drugs and which packets of drugs were to be delivered to each of the two recipients. Tan then separated the Ten Bundles for the two intended recipients based on labels marked \u201cA\u201d, \u201cB\u201d and \u201cC\u201d respectively which were pasted on the bundles. Significantly, on Tan\u2019s account, this was the extent to which he handled the Ten Bundles.', '(e)\\u2003Thereafter, Tan called the intended recipients of the drugs and told them to meet him at City Plaza. Upon arriving at City Plaza, he met Low, the first intended recipient, and delivered the three bundles of diamorphine to him. Tan and Low were then arrested by CNB officers.', '17\\u2003On 25 and 26 February 2014, Tan provided two further long statements to the CNB. In these statements, he identified some of the drug exhibits and spoke of his family and personal circumstances.', '18\\u2003Several weeks later, on 1 April 2014, after follow-up investigations subsequent to a separate arrest, officers from the CNB arrested the Appellant on the suspicion that he was involved in drug activities. Three handphones were seized in the course of the Appellant\u2019s arrest: a Nokia handphone, which was later marked \u201cJJ-HP1\u201d, and two Samsung handphones, which were later marked \u201cJJ-HP2\u201d and \u201cJJ-HP3\u201d respectively.', '19\\u2003Some eight months after the Appellant\u2019s arrest, on 5 December 2014, Tan provided a further long statement to the CNB. In this statement, Tan reiterated that on the morning of his arrest, Ah Jun had given him the drugs referred to at [12]\u2013[13] above in Malaysia. A single photograph of the Appellant was then shown to Tan, who proceeded to identify the Appellant as Ah Jun. It was not evident, from the materials before us, whether the Appellant had been questioned in connection with this matter at that time.', '20\\u2003On 6 February 2015, the first statement by the Appellant in connection with this matter was recorded by the CNB. Notably, the recording of this statement was done more than ten months after the Appellant\u2019s arrest on 1 April 2014 (see [18] above). In this statement, the Appellant stated the following:', '(a)\\u2003He knew Tan by the name of \u201cAh Hao\u201d. He used to work at an Internet cafe which Tan patronised, and became acquainted with Tan through Shao Yang (see [8] above), another patron of that cafe. Both Tan and Shao Yang worked for a man whom he knew as \u201cXiao Hu\u201d. He came to know Xiao Hu about six months after meeting Tan.', '(b)\\u2003Xiao Hu had previously loaned him RM800. He felt indebted to Xiao Hu even after repaying the loan, and had therefore performed errands for Xiao Hu, including purchasing paper boxes, cartons of black sticky tape and Ziploc bags. He had also helped Xiao Hu to pack pills and white substances. He had been told that these were sexual enhancement pills and solidified fragrance oils, but he suspected that they were drugs.', '(c)\\u2003He had previously seen the Jorano bag of drugs at Xiao Hu\u2019s home. However, in relation to the drug exhibits found inside that bag, he stated:', 'Similarly, in relation to the Blue Bag and its contents, he said that he had \u201cnever seen nor touch[ed] them before \u2026\u201d.', '(d)\\u2003He had previously seen bundles similar to the seized drug exhibits at Xiao Hu\u2019s residence, but Xiao Hu had told him not to touch them.', '21\\u2003On 9 October 2015, the Appellant provided three cautioned statements to the CNB. In these statements, he denied the charges against him. He said that he had nothing to do with the drugs in the Ten Bundles, although he knew Tan as a friend.', '22\\u2003The DNA Profiling Laboratory of the HSA (\u201cthe Laboratory\u201d) analysed, among other items, A1, A1A, A1B, A1C, A1D, A1D1, A1E, A1F, A1G, B, B1, B2 and B3. These were the Jorano bag of drugs (A1), the Blue Bag (B), the cling wrap-cum-black tape coverings of the Ten Bundles (A1A, A1B, A1C, A1D, A1E, A1F, A1G, B1, B2 and B3) and the separate piece of cling wrap found in the bundle covered by A1D (A1D1). The findings of this analysis were set out in two reports dated 9 September 2014 and 13 November 2014 respectively (\u201cthe DNA Reports\u201d).', '23\\u2003The DNA Reports indicate that the Laboratory took swabs of various surfaces of the drug exhibits, extracted DNA from the swabs and then amplified the extracted DNA to obtain DNA profiles. These DNA profiles were then compared with DNA profiles obtained from blood specimens taken from the Appellant and Tan to ascertain whether their DNA was found on the drug exhibits.', '24\\u2003Before we set out the findings in the DNA Reports, we briefly describe how the cling wrap and black tape used to cover each bundle of drugs were applied. The cling wrap was first used to cover each Ziploc bag or packet of drugs. The black tape was then applied continuously over the cling wrap several times, thus forming layers of tape. Only the non-adhesive side of the outermost layer of tape would have been exposed to contact with any person handling the Ten Bundles after they had been wrapped as aforesaid.', '25\\u2003The Laboratory took swabs of five areas of the materials used to cover each bundle of drugs:', '(a)\\u2003Area 1 \u2013 This was the exterior surface of each bundle before it was dismantled; in other words, it was the non-adhesive side of only the outermost layer of tape around each bundle.', '(b)\\u2003Area 2 \u2013 This was the innermost surface of the covering of each bundle, that is, the side of the cling wrap that was in contact with the Ziploc bag or packet of drugs contained within the bundle.', '(c)\\u2003Area 3 \u2013 This was the adhesive side of the entirety of the tape used to cover the cling wrap around each bundle. By definition, this area was different and distinct from the non-adhesive side of the outermost layer of tape around each bundle (Area 1). However, it included the adhesive side of the strips of tape constituting Area 1.', '(d)\\u2003Area 4 \u2013 This was the non-adhesive side of the entirety of the tape used to cover the cling wrap around each bundle. In short, this was the back of Area 3 and it therefore included Area 1.', '(e)\\u2003Area 5 \u2013 This was the entirety of the cling wrap around each bundle. It comprised both the side of the cling wrap that was in contact with the Ziploc bag or packet of drugs contained within each bundle (Area 2), as well as the side that was not in contact.', '26\\u2003Significantly, Ms Tang Sheau Wei June (\u201cMs Tang\u201d), the HSA analyst who prepared the DNA Reports, testified that for each bundle of drugs, the Laboratory swabbed at the same time the entire area of tape constituting Area 3 (and the entire area of tape constituting Area 4). Hence, where DNA was found on Area 3 on a particular bundle of drugs, there was no further evidence as to where exactly on Area 3 the DNA was found. The evidence did not indicate whether the DNA was found on Area 3 of the outermost layer of tape around that bundle, or on Area 3 of the layers of tape beneath that.', '27\\u2003Tan\u2019s DNA was found at the following points on the Ten Bundles:', '(a)\\u2003Area 1 \u2013 Tan\u2019s DNA was found on Area 1 on nine of the bundles, namely, the bundles covered by A1A, A1B, A1C, A1D, A1E, A1F, A1G, B1 and B3.', '(b)\\u2003Area 3 \u2013 Tan\u2019s DNA was found on Area 3 on five of the bundles, namely, the bundles covered by A1A, A1D, A1E, A1G and B1.', '(c)\\u2003Area 4 \u2013 Tan\u2019s DNA was found on Area 4 on eight of the bundles, namely, the bundles covered by A1A, A1B, A1C, A1D, A1E, A1G, B1 and B2.', 'Tan\u2019s DNA was not found on either Area 2 or Area 5 on any of the Ten Bundles. In addition, his DNA was found on the exterior surfaces, interior surfaces and handles of the Jorano bag of drugs, but not on the Blue Bag.', '28\\u2003The Appellant\u2019s DNA was found on three of the Ten Bundles, namely, the bundle covered by A1F (Area 3), the bundle covered by A1G (Areas 2, 4 and 5) and the bundle covered by B3 (Area 4). The Appellant\u2019s DNA was not found on the Jorano bag of drugs at all, nor was it found on the Blue Bag.', '29\\u2003For the purposes of these grounds of decision, it will suffice for us to set out in brief the following aspects of the Handphone Evidence. We deliberately refrain from saying more about this evidence since it will likely feature prominently at the retrial of this matter.', '30\\u2003First, on 21 February 2014 between 6.08am and 6.10am, three messages were sent from the Untraced Number to TKH-HP2. These were the Delivery Messages. The Untraced Number was saved in TKH-HP2 under the contact name \u201cAh Jun\u201d (in Mandarin). The relevant translated portions of the Delivery Messages read as follows:', '(a)\\u2003\u201cA = 98944027\u201d;', '(b)\\u2003\u201c83046830, collect whatever amount given\u201d;', '(c)\\u2003\u201cDo a\u2019s first\u201d.', 'It was undisputed that the handphone number \u201c98944027\u201d belonged to Low.', '31\\u2003Second, the Untraced Number was saved in JJ-HP1, the Appellant\u2019s Nokia handphone. The contact name assigned to the Untraced Number was the Chinese character \u201c\u6211\u201d, which means \u201cI (or Me)\u201d. According to the Appellant, the Untraced Number belonged to Xiao Hu, and it was Xiao Hu who had saved the number in JJ-HP1 under the Chinese character for \u201cI (or Me)\u201d.', '32\\u2003Third, the Untraced Number was found in JJ-HP3, one of the Appellant\u2019s Samsung handphones, where it was reflected as belonging to a Facebook contact named \u201cAkira Akimoto\u201d. Five Facebook Messenger messages were received on JJ-HP3 from \u201cAkira Akimoto\u201d on 25 March 2014. Notably, these five messages (\u201cthe Akira Akimoto Messages\u201d) were not translated. The Appellant testified that they were sent by Xiao Hu in a group conversation on Facebook. The Prosecution did not cross-examine the Appellant on these messages in the proceedings below.', '33\\u2003Fourth, the number of JJ-HP1, +601 67604280, was saved in TKH-HP1 and TKH-HP3 under the contact names \u201cAh Jun\u201d and \u201cAh Jun 1\u201d (in Mandarin) respectively.', '34\\u2003Fifth, on 20 and 21 February 2014, calls were made from TKH-HP3 to the Untraced Number, as well as from the Untraced Number to TKH-HP3.'"}
{"casename":"2018_SGCA_6","fact":"'3\\u2003On 11 June 2008, the respondent, [BPW], entered into a share purchase and share subscription agreement (\u201cthe Agreement\u201d) with certain shareholders (\u201cthe Sellers\u201d) of [P] Limited (\u201cthe Company\u201d) to purchase their controlling stake in the Company. The Agreement is governed by Indian law and contains an ICC arbitration clause designating Singapore as the place of arbitration. On 12 November 2012, the respondent commenced arbitration proceedings against the Sellers pursuant to the arbitration clause in the Agreement (\u201cthe Arbitration Agreement\u201d). The crux of the respondent\u2019s claim was that during the negotiations leading to the Agreement, the Sellers had fraudulently misled them and concealed facts concerning certain investigations that the United States Department of Justice and the United States Food and Drug Administration had commenced against the Company. The respondent claimed that such non-disclosure constituted fraud under the Indian Contract Act 1872 (Act No 9 of 1872) (\u201cIndian Contract Act\u201d). It also sought monetary damages pursuant to s 19 of the Indian Contract Act, to put it in the same position as if the representations made had been true. The Sellers contested their liability for fraud. They also objected to the computation, scope, and measure of damages which the respondent claimed pursuant to the Indian Contract Act.', '4\\u2003The Award was delivered on 29 April 2016 by the majority of the three-member arbitral tribunal (\u201cthe Tribunal\u201d) who found in favour of the respondent. The third arbitrator issued a dissenting award. Thereafter, the respondent started enforcement proceedings in India. The appellant was appointed lead counsel by some of the Sellers to assist them in resisting the Indian enforcement proceedings.', '5\\u2003Around the same time, by way of Originating Summons No 490 of 2016 (\u201cOS 490\u201d), the respondent also sought to enforce the Award in Singapore. Leave to enforce the Award against the Sellers in Singapore was granted on 18 May 2016 (\u201cthe Leave Order\u201d).', '6\\u2003The Sellers responded by taking out applications in OS 490 to set aside the Leave Order, and filing Originating Summonses 784 and 787 of 2016 against the respondent to set aside the Award (collectively, \u201cthe Singapore Proceedings\u201d). It will be noted that the Sellers filed two separate applications in the Singapore Proceedings and, correspondingly, two separate applications for the ad hoc admission of the appellant in OS 1114 and OS 1115. This is because the Sellers comprise two groups. The first group comprises 15 adult and corporate sellers (\u201cthe Adult Sellers\u201d). The second group comprises five minor sellers (\u201cthe Minor Sellers\u201d). The two groups raised different arguments in their applications, and these differences are elaborated on below at [11]. Before delving into the Sellers\u2019 arguments, we note material aspects of the Award.', '7\\u2003By the Award, the majority held that the Sellers were liable for fraudulently misrepresenting or concealing from the respondent the genesis, nature, and severity of the Company\u2019s regulatory problems. It is the majority\u2019s computation of damages, however, that forms the focus of the Singapore Proceedings. The Award recorded that it was \u201cnot disputed\u201d that the measure of damages recoverable under s 19 of the Indian Contract Act would be similar to that recoverable for fraudulent misrepresentation under general tort principles. In this regard, the Award cited the Gujarat High Court decision in R C Thakkar v Gujarat Housing Board AIR 1973 Guj 34 (\u201cR C Thakkar High Court Decision\u201d) and the English House of Lords decision in Smith New Court Securities Ltd v Citibank N A [1997] AC 254 (\u201cSmith New Court\u201d). Therefore, by the Award, damages were granted in order to put the respondent back in the monetary position it would have been in had the wrong not been committed (ie, pre-acquisition of the Company\u2019s shares). Because the Arbitration Agreement provides that the arbitrators \u201cshall not award punitive, exemplary, multiple or consequential damages\u201d, the Award benchmarked the sum awarded against alternative quantum calculations.', '8\\u2003The dissenting arbitrator was of the view that if a contract was obtained by fraudulent misrepresentation, the innocent party had to elect to either rescind the contract under s 19 of the Indian Contract Act or insist that it be specifically performed so as to put that party in the position in which it would have been if the representation made had been true. Because the respondent did not exercise its option to rescind the contract on the ground of fraud, it could not claim damages under s 19 of the Indian Contract Act (ie, it had waived its right to damages for misrepresentation).', '9\\u2003As noted, the appellant\u2019s admission was sought solely so that he might address difficult and novel Indian law issues inherent in the Singapore Proceedings. Therefore, not all the grounds which the Sellers have raised in their attempts to set aside the Award were relevant for our consideration of the appeals. In our view, the relevant grounds fell into two broad categories:', '(a)\\u2003First, that the Tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction because the Award contained decisions on matters beyond the scope of submission (\u201cthe Jurisdictional Challenge\u201d).', '(b)\\u2003Second, that the Award is contrary to the public policy of Singapore (\u201cthe Public Policy Challenge\u201d).', '10\\u2003The main thrust of the Jurisdictional Challenge was that the majority exceeded the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction by assessing and awarding damages in a manner contrary to the Arbitration Agreement (see above at [7]).', '11\\u2003The Adult Sellers and the Minor Sellers raised different arguments in their Public Policy Challenge. The former argued that the majority\u2019s reliance on the R C Thakkar High Court Decision, which has been overruled by the Indian Supreme Court in R C Thakkar v Gujarat Housing Board Civil Appeal No 2652 of 1972 (\u201cR C Thakkar Supreme Court Decision\u201d), violated Indian public policy. This in turn would violate Singapore\u2019s public policy. The Minor Sellers argued that the Award violated the public policy of Singapore because, by finding the Sellers jointly and severally liable for the full sum of damages, the majority of the Tribunal had imposed grossly disproportionate liability for damages on the Minor Sellers, and had failed to protect their welfare and best interests.'"}
{"casename":"2018_SGCA_60","fact":"'2\\u2003The facts of the dispute were canvassed in detail by the Judge in the GD, and it suffices for us to set out only the facts relevant to the appeal. The appellant is Mr Teng Wen-Chung, who was the chairman, director and majority shareholder of a Taiwanese insurance company, Singfor Life Insurance Ltd (\u201cSingfor\u201d), until it was placed under government receivership in 2014. The respondent is the Singapore branch of EFG Bank AG, a bank incorporated in Switzerland.', '3\\u2003This matter revolved around two loan facilities (\u201cthe Loan Facilities\u201d) that the respondent had extended to Surewin Worldwide Limited (\u201cSurewin\u201d), a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. The first facility (\u201cthe First Surewin Facility\u201d) was originally dated August 2007 and provided for a loan of up to US$30m. According to the appellant, this limit was increased over time. Most significantly, it was increased to US$205m in January 2012 before being increased to US$240m in November 2012. The second facility (\u201cthe Second Surewin Facility\u201d), originally dated December 2011 and revised in November 2012, allowed Surewin to draw down up to US$30m on the facility. It was expressly provided in the Loan Facilities that they were to be governed by Singapore law.', '4\\u2003On 19 January 2012, shortly before the loan limit of the First Surewin Facility was increased to US$205m, the appellant and the respondent entered into an indemnity agreement (\u201cthe Indemnity Agreement\u201d). Under the agreement, which was expressly governed by Singapore law, the appellant agreed to pay the respondent all sums of money owing or payable to the respondent by Surewin. This included all sums that Surewin owed the respondent under the Loan Facilities.', '5\\u2003The Loan Facilities were also secured by four pledges, of which two are noteworthy for our purposes. The first pledge was made by Singfor Tactical Asset Allocation Portfolio SA in September 2007 over its assets held in an account with the respondent, and the second pledge was entered into by Volaw Corporate Trustee Ltd in March 2008 over the assets of SFIP-1 Unit Trust, of which Singfor was the sole unit holder. Like the Loan Facilities and the Indemnity Agreement, both pledges were expressly governed by Singapore law.', '6\\u2003In August 2014, Singfor was placed under government receivership. This constituted an event of default under the Loan Facilities and led the respondent to terminate the Loan Facilities and demand repayment of the outstanding amounts, as it was entitled to do. After failing to realise its security, the respondent issued a letter of demand in December 2015 to the appellant demanding repayment of approximately US$199.7m as the sum outstanding under the Loan Facilities, and US$12.7m as costs expended in connection with the enforcement of the Loan Facilities.', '7\\u2003The respondent subsequently commenced this action against the appellant. About a year later, in December 2016, the respondent filed an application for summary judgment, which was granted by the Registrar of the Supreme Court in February 2017. The appellant sought to resist summary judgment on the basis that the Indemnity Agreement was unenforceable as a result of foreign illegality. It turned out that he had been convicted for breach of trust and money laundering with respect to Singfor in June 2016 by the Taipei District Court, which observed in its judgment (\u201cthe Taiwanese Judgment\u201d) that the pledges were illegal and of no effect under Taiwanese law.', '8\\u2003The appeal against the Registrar\u2019s decision was dismissed by the Judge, whose decision was appealed against by the appellant to this court. At this juncture, we ought to point out that the respondent sought to enforce only the Indemnity Agreement in relation to the First Surewin Facility. Approximately US$32.1m had been realised from the collateral securing the Loan Facilities, and the respondent had put that sum towards repaying the amount owed under the Second Surewin Facility. The appellant did not contest the respondent\u2019s entitlement to do so, and we were thus concerned only with the First Surewin Facility in this appeal.'"}

The application for recusal was premised on the Judge\u2019s alleged conduct at the hearings on 18 April, 21 April, 20 and 21 June 2017.', '13\\u2003On 2 October 2017, the Judge heard the parties and dismissed SUM 240.', '14\\u2003In the parties\u2019 submissions below, the Appellant\u2019s main ground for recusal was that the Court had been infected by apparent bias. The Appellant elaborated that this was because her counsel had been unduly hampered in the presentation of her case before the Judge; the Judge had favoured the Respondent by giving his counsel more time and greater leeway; and the Judge had prejudged the case against the Appellant without having heard the parties fully.', '15\\u2003The Respondent submitted that apparent bias was not made out on the facts. The Respondent added that the recusal application was a backdoor appeal prematurely brought before any order was made by the Judge because the Appellant was unhappy with the Judge\u2019s factual findings. Further, as a matter of public policy, the recusal application should not be allowed as it would condone \u201cjudge shopping\u201d.', '16\\u2003At the time this appeal was heard, the hearing of the ancillary matters in the divorce suit had not concluded and no orders had been made.'"}
{"casename":"2018_SGCA_62","fact":"'3\\u2003The material facts have been set out by the Judge at [4] to [13] of the GD. Essentially, this case concerns the transportation of a package of drugs, which was found to contain not less than 53.64g of diamorphine. The co-accused were charged with having trafficked in these drugs. Although they were both physically involved in handling the green bag that contained the drugs at various points, and even though in Rahmat\u2019s case he accepted that he was in possession of the green bag, they each contended that they were not trafficking. The objective facts and the contentions of each of the co-accused in respect of these facts may be stated as follows.', '(a)\\u2003First, each co-accused claimed that he was dealing with or acting on the instructions of another person. Rahmat referred to the person he was dealing with as \u201cKanna\u201d, while Zainal referred to the person he was dealing with as \u201cSamba\u201d.', '(b)\\u2003Second, the person or persons on whose instructions the co-accused were acting, was or were in fact responsible for arranging to transport the package of drugs.', '(c)\\u2003Third, Rahmat claimed that Kanna instructed him to deliver the package, which he ultimately claimed he thought contained medicines, to someone called \u201cBai\u201d, who then directed him to deliver it to Zainal. Rahmat further claimed that he was to collect a sum of $8,000 which was said to be the repayment due to Kanna arising from an earlier unrelated illegal moneylending transaction, rather than the payment for the medicines. According to Rahmat, his main task was to collect payment of the supposed illegal loan.', '(d)\\u2003Fourth, Zainal, who had been a drug dealer, claimed that he wanted to move from drug dealing to dealing in uncustomed cigarettes. As his first endeavour in this direction, he asked Samba to arrange delivery of 200 cartons of such cigarettes. He was told that 20 cartons would be delivered first and in return he was to pay a sum of $8,000, which was the amount payable for the entire shipment.', '(e)\\u2003Fifth, Rahmat delivered the green bag to Zainal and collected the sum of $8,000. Zainal said he knew at once that the green bag did not contain the cigarettes. But he said he paid the sum of $8,000 as an advance payment for the anticipated future delivery of the cigarettes. He specifically maintained that he did not pay the $8,000 for the green bag. In fact, his case was that he never really took delivery of the green bag. The green bag was just incidental to the transaction as a whole and was curiously and for no apparent reason left there by Rahmat. Further, when Zainal later moved the green bag to a location in the warehouse behind some pallets where it could not readily be seen, he said he had done so with a view to retrieving it later and then returning it to Rahmat, whom he had hoped and expected would eventually return with the cigarettes.', '(f)\\u2003Sixth, throughout this transaction, Zainal said he was extremely uncomfortable because he thought they might be under surveillance by law enforcement officers.'"}
{"casename":"2018_SGCA_63","fact":"'4\\u2003Hualon Corporation (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd, a Malaysian company that was incorporated in 1989, is the respondent in this appeal. It was put into receivership in November 2006. Prior thereto its directors were two brothers, namely, Mr Oung Da Ming and Mr Oung Yu-Ming (collectively \u201cthe Oung brothers\u201d). The Oung brothers were substantial shareholders in the respondent. They were also shareholders in three related companies: Hualon Chemical and Textile Co Ltd (\u201cHualon Chemical\u201d), Hualon Corporation Taiwan which itself was a substantial shareholder in the respondent, and E-Hsin International Corporation (\u201cE-Hsin\u201d).', '5\\u2003In 1993, the respondent incorporated a company in Vietnam known as Hualon Corporation Vietnam as its wholly-owned subsidiary (\u201cthe Vietnam Subsidiary\u201d). The Vietnam Subsidiary was governed by its company charter issued on 30 December 1993. Mr Oung Da Ming was its chairman.', '6\\u2003In June 1999, the Vietnam Subsidiary issued shares to Hualon Chemical and E-Hsin (\u201cthe 1999 transfers\u201d) and, as a result, was no longer wholly owned by the respondent. The Oung brothers, as the then-directors of the respondent, procured the 1999 transfers.', '7\\u2003Starting in late 1999 the respondent experienced financial difficulties and was thereafter forced to seek help from its creditors through a scheme of arrangement. Its financial position did not improve substantially, however, and this led the creditors to appoint Mr Duar Tuan Kiat (\u201cthe Receiver\u201d) as receiver and manager of the respondent on 30 November 2006. From then onwards, the respondent acted under the direction of the Receiver and the powers of the directors were displaced.', '8\\u2003In the meantime, the appellant, Marty Ltd, had entered the scene in August 2006 as a company incorporated in the BVI by the Oung brothers. The Oung brothers are and were at all material times the only shareholders of the appellant.', '9\\u2003In March 2007, Hualon Chemical subscribed for further shares in the Vietnam Subsidiary and E-Hsin transferred its shares in the Vietnam Subsidiary to the appellant (\u201cthe 2007 transfers\u201d). The allegation is that the 2007 transfers were procured by the Oung brothers.', '10\\u2003In February 2008, the Vietnam Subsidiary was re-registered for the purpose of obtaining an investment certificate from the relevant authorities. As part of the re-registration process, the Vietnam Subsidiary\u2019s company charter was revised and updated (\u201cthe Revised Charter\u201d). The Revised Charter contains a number of articles which are relevant to the issues between the parties but we need only mention two:', '(a)\\u2003Article 7, which sets out the \u201cCapital Contribution\u201d of the shareholders of the Vietnam Subsidiary. It states that the shares of the Vietnam Subsidiary are held by the respondent (47.69%), the appellant (41.21%) and Hualon Chemical (11.1%). These proportions were a direct result of the shares that the appellant and Hualon Chemical had acquired through the 1999 and 2007 transfers; and', '(b)\\u2003Article 22, the arbitration clause which provides that disputes between members of the company should first be resolved through negotiation and conciliation and if this cannot be done \u201cthe disputes shall be submitted by any Party for final settlement to Singapore International Arbitration Centre (\u201cSIAC\u201d) in accordance with the Rules of laws of SIAC. The award of the arbitrators is final and binding\u201d.', '11\\u2003In August 2008, Hualon Chemical transferred all of its shares in the Vietnam Subsidiary to the appellant and another BVI company, Cubic Holdings Limited, a company whose ownership remains unknown (\u201cthe 2008 transfers\u201d). The respondent\u2019s position is that the 2008 transfers were also procured by the Oung brothers. After the 2008 transfers, the shareholders of the Vietnam Subsidiary were the appellant (now holding 99.7% of the shares), Cubic Holdings Limited (holding 0.11% thereof) and the respondent (whose shareholding was reduced to only 0.19%). The 1999, 2007 and 2008 share transfers (collectively the \u201cShare Transfers\u201d) and the parties\u2019 capital contributions as recorded in Art 7 of the Revised Charter formed the basis of the dispute between the parties. The respondent\u2019s position is that the Share Transfers were invalid and that its ownership of the Vietnam Subsidiary has been unlawfully diluted to almost nothing.', '12\\u2003In February 2009, the Receiver commissioned Indochine Counsel, a law firm in Vietnam, to undertake a \u201climited due diligence\/check\u201d on the Vietnam Subsidiary. Indochine Counsel\u2019s proposed scope of services, which was approved and accepted by the Receiver, included obtaining the corporate records of the Vietnam Subsidiary.', '13\\u2003On 1 July 2009, Indochine Counsel sent its report dated 19 June 2009 (the \u201cDue Diligence Report\u201d) to the Receiver. In the section titled \u201cOur Advice\u201d, Indochine Counsel set out its advice on the consequences and legal redress under the laws of Vietnam in respect of the transfer of capital from the respondent to the appellant. It took the view that the respondent\u2019s representative (ie, Mr Oung Da Ming) was not authorised to act or had acted ultra vires in respect of the Share Transfers. Specifically, Indochine Counsel stated that if the respondent could prove that its representative had taken a \u201cfabricated act\u201d in respect of the Share Transfers, it could \u201cbring [the] matter to the authorized court\/arbitration against such unauthorized representative in order to request the court to consider and judge invalidity of such fabricated capital assignment transaction\u201d. Attached to the Due Diligence Report was a copy of the English translation of the Revised Charter. Thus, from July 2009 onwards, if not earlier, the Receiver and his advisers had access to the Revised Charter.', '14\\u2003From 2009 to 2014, the Receiver investigated the matters that were raised in the Due Diligence Report, including by taking steps to locate the individuals involved and to scrutinise the Share Transfers. On 22 July 2014, when he considered enough material had been gathered, the Receiver commenced proceedings in the BVI courts on behalf of the respondent against the appellant and the Oung brothers (\u201cthe BVI Action\u201d). In the statement of claim it filed in the BVI Action on the same day, the respondent alleged that it had been wrongfully deprived of its shareholding in the Vietnam Subsidiary. According to the statement of claim, the Oung brothers had breached their statutory and fiduciary duties and the appellant had dishonestly assisted the Oung brothers and knowingly received shares in the Vietnam Subsidiary to which it was not entitled and was thereby unjustly enriched. The respondent then applied for and obtained leave to serve the cause papers on the Oung brothers out of jurisdiction and also obtained an injunction restraining the appellant from disposing of its interest in the Vietnam Subsidiary (\u201cthe Interim Injunction\u201d).', '15\\u2003The appellant received the cause papers on 13 October 2014 and filed its Acknowledgment of Service on 4 November 2014. On the relevant form, the appellant checked the \u201cYES\u201d box in response to the question as to whether it intended to defend the claim. However, no defence was ever filed.', '16\\u2003Subsequently, the appellant and the Oung brothers filed separate challenges against the BVI court\u2019s jurisdiction on the ground of forum non conveniens. The appellant stated in its application (filed on 18 December 2014) that the BVI was not the natural or appropriate forum to hear the respondent\u2019s claim and that Malaysia or alternatively Vietnam would be the appropriate and convenient forum to hear the claim. The appellant amended its jurisdictional challenge on 26 January 2015 to include an application to discharge the Interim Injunction. The jurisdictional challenge was heard on 9 February 2015.', '17\\u2003On 2 February 2015, before the jurisdictional challenge was heard, the respondent applied for leave to discontinue the BVI Action against the Oung brothers. Leave was granted on 9 February 2015. Thereafter, the BVI Action was only against the appellant.', '', '18\\u2003On 10 February 2015, the BVI court dismissed the appellant\u2019s jurisdictional challenge. In its decision, the BVI court explained that the appellant needed to show that some other jurisdiction was clearly or distinctly the appropriate forum, and doubted that this could be done as the appellant had put forward two different jurisdictions as alternative candidates. The BVI court held that it did not need to resolve this conundrum because in any event, the appellant had adduced no evidence to show that the respondent was entitled to commence proceedings against the appellant in either Malaysia or Vietnam as of right, nor had the appellant submitted to the courts of either jurisdiction.', '19\\u2003The Receiver takes the position that it was only at the end of February 2015, after the jurisdictional challenge had concluded and some seven months after the institution of the BVI Action, that he discovered the existence of Art 22, the arbitration clause. Two affidavits were filed in support of this position. The first affidavit was made by the Receiver who explained that he was not aware of the existence of Art 22 until it was brought to his attention by his lawyers towards the end of February 2015. This was corroborated by a second affidavit made by the respondent\u2019s counsel in the BVI proceedings (\u201cthe BVI counsel\u201d), who took a similar position. She said that during February 2015, in the course of reviewing the documents filed by the appellant, \u201cit came to the attention of the [respondent\u2019s] lawyers that the [Revised Charter] \u2026 contained an arbitration clause. This clause had not previously been noticed by any of the law firms instructed in this matter\u201d. However, we note that no affidavit was filed by the lawyers who had noticed Art 22, explaining how or why they had failed to spot Art 22 before the commencement of the BVI Action and the circumstances in which Art 22 was eventually spotted. The respondent also did not tender in evidence any correspondence between the parties that could have shed light on these issues. Further, in July 2014, the same BVI counsel had filed an affidavit in support of the injunction application which exhibited an English translation of the Revised Charter containing all the articles of the same including Art 22.', '20\\u2003On 6 March 2015, the appellant filed a fresh application to discharge the Interim Injunction. The appellant argued, inter alia, that the Interim Injunction should be discharged because there was no serious issue to be tried.', '21\\u2003On 10 March 2015, the respondent filed its Notice of Arbitration with the SIAC and the arbitration, known as SIAC Arbitration No 48 of 2015, was subsequently deemed to have commenced on 12 March 2015. In its Notice of Arbitration, the respondent took the same position as it did in the BVI court: that the Oung brothers breached their fiduciary duties by procuring the dilution of the respondent\u2019s shareholding in the Vietnam Subsidiary, and that the appellant was liable as knowing recipient or dishonest assistant or was unjustly enriched. Significantly, the respondent stated in its Notice of Arbitration that its case was \u201cbased on [the Revised Charter] adopted on 4 February 2008, at the direction of the Oung Brothers, as a foundation for their subsequent fraudulent dilution of the [respondent\u2019s] shareholding\u201d. The respondent took the position that the Revised Charter and the associated share transfers were invalid and sought, inter alia, a re-transfer of the shareholding in the Vietnam Subsidiary to the respondent.', '22\\u2003The next day, 13 March 2015, the respondent wrote to the appellant, stating that although it challenged the validity of the Revised Charter as a whole, it accepted the existence and validity of Art 22, the arbitration clause, and would be seeking to rely on it. In the same letter, the respondent proposed that the BVI proceedings be stayed pending the outcome of the arbitration. The respondent took no concrete steps in this regard until 20 April 2015.', '23\\u2003On 26 March 2015, the appellant applied to the BVI court for summary judgment in its favour or to strike out the BVI Action. The appellant submitted that the Receiver had no authority to institute the BVI Action and that there was no evidence of the Share Transfers. The appellant later amended its application to introduce a time-bar defence and to introduce further details of that defence.', '24\\u2003In response, on 31 March 2015, the respondent asked to inspect certain documents that were referred to in the affidavit filed in support of the appellant\u2019s summary judgment application. The respondent\u2019s request was refused by the appellant on 17 April 2015.', '25\\u2003On 20 April 2015, after the respondent\u2019s inspection request was refused and more than one month after the respondent initially filed its Notice of Arbitration, the respondent applied to the BVI court to stay the BVI Action in favour of arbitration. The application was heard by the BVI court on 18 May 2015. Judgment was reserved.', '26\\u2003During this time, the arbitration proceedings were running in parallel. On 19 June 2015, the tribunal was constituted with a sole arbitrator. The appellant thereafter challenged the jurisdiction of the tribunal. In September and October 2015, the parties tendered their submissions on jurisdiction to the tribunal.', '27\\u2003On 28 October 2015, the respondent applied to the BVI court to extend the Interim Injunction. The terms of the application were that the Interim Injunction be continued (ie, in favour of litigation), or alternatively, that a fresh injunction should be granted against the appellant on the same terms pending the determination of the arbitration proceedings. Counsel for the respondent, Ms Yogarajah, confirmed during the hearing before us that the respondent\u2019s primary application had been for the Interim Injunction to be continued in support of litigation and the application for a fresh injunction in support of arbitration was an alternative prayer. The BVI court heard the appellant\u2019s application to discharge the Interim Injunction (see [20] above) and the respondent\u2019s application to extend the Interim Injunction on 3 November 2015. On 20 November 2015, the BVI court granted the appellant\u2019s application and discharged the Interim Injunction. The respondent appealed against this order on 11 December 2015 and the appellant filed a cross-appeal on 5 January 2016 in respect of some of the findings made by the BVI court.', '28\\u2003In the meantime, the appellant applied to the BVI court in November 2015 for security for costs to be provided by the respondent in respect of the litigation. The BVI court granted the appellant\u2019s application on 20 January 2016 and ordered the respondent to pay security for costs into court within 21 days. The respondent did not pay in time and the BVI Action was struck out on 22 March 2016. It should be noted that no decision was ever made in respect of the respondent\u2019s appeal against the decision to discharge the Interim Injunction because the respondent\u2019s claim was struck out.', '', '29\\u2003On 19 April 2016, the tribunal held that it had jurisdiction over the dispute. The appellant challenged that decision in the High Court by filing Originating Summons No 501 of 2016 on 19 May 2016. The appellant argued that the respondent could not take the position that Mr Oung Da Ming had no authority to enter into the Revised Charter while simultaneously relying on Art 22, the arbitration clause contained within the Revised Charter. The appellant also submitted that because of the unique nature of the respondent\u2019s challenge, the dispute between the parties did not fall within the scope of Art 22. The appellant further argued that the respondent\u2019s conduct in commencing the BVI proceedings and taking steps in the litigation even after the arbitration was commenced meant that it had waived its right to arbitrate, repudiated the arbitration agreement or was estopped from relying on the arbitration clause.'"}
{"casename":"2018_SGCA_64","fact":"'2\\u2003Suit 17, which has yet to be heard, is a minority oppression action brought by EQ Capital Investments Ltd (\u201cEQ Capital\u201d) against four defendants: (a) Sunbreeze Group Investments Ltd (\u201cSunbreeze\u201d), the first appellant in this appeal; (b) Manoj Mohan Murjani (\u201cMr Murjani\u201d), the second appellant; (c) his wife, Kanchan Manoj Murjani (\u201cMrs Murjani\u201d), the third appellant; and (d) The Wellness Group Pte Ltd (\u201cWellness\u201d). Sunbreeze and EQ Capital are shareholders of Wellness, holding 80.62% and 7.55% respectively of Wellness\u2019 shares, with the remaining shares in Wellness being held by two private equity funds. Mr and Mrs Murjani are directors and shareholders of Sunbreeze as well as directors of Wellness. Wellness is a nominal party in Suit 17, having been joined only because the plaintiff, EQ Capital, seeks reliefs concerning it. The third party proceedings were instituted only by the first three defendants in Suit 17 (the appellants in this appeal), but not Wellness, and Wellness is not a party to this appeal.', '3\\u2003The claims in Suit 17 are closely related to a joint venture between Wellness, OSIM International Pte Ltd (\u201cOSIM\u201d) and Paris Investment Pte Ltd (\u201cParis\u201d). These parties are now shareholders in a joint venture company known as TWG Tea Company Pte Ltd (\u201cTWG\u201d). TWG was originally incorporated as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Wellness in October 2007. In 2010, Paris acquired 15.8% of the shares in TWG. In early 2011, OSIM was considering investing in TWG. OSIM\u2019s founder, chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Ron Sim Chye Hock (\u201cMr Sim\u201d), is the respondent in this appeal as well as the ultimate sole beneficial owner of EQ Capital. During the negotiations with OSIM, Mr Murjani presented Mr Sim with profit projections showing that TWG expected to achieve profit before tax and minority interests (\u201cPBT\u201d) of $29m for the financial year ending 31 March 2013 (\u201cFY2013\u201d). OSIM decided to invest in TWG. This culminated in the signing of two agreements dated 18 March 2011:', '(a)\\u2003a sale and purchase agreement (\u201cthe SPA\u201d), pursuant to which OSIM purchased a 35% stake in TWG from Wellness and Paris; and', '(b)\\u2003a shareholders\u2019 agreement between Wellness, OSIM, Paris and TWG (\u201cthe SHA\u201d), under which the parties agreed to operate TWG as a joint venture and envisaged the establishment of future joint ventures between TWG and OSIM in other countries in Asia.', '4\\u2003Following OSIM\u2019s investment, Wellness, OSIM and Paris held TWG\u2019s shares in the respective proportions of 54.7%, 35% and 10.3%. Clause 4.5 of the SPA (\u201cthe Profit Swing Clause\u201d) provided for the following changes in shareholding depending on TWG\u2019s audited PBT for FY2013:', '(a)\\u2003If the audited PBT was less than $17m, Wellness and Paris would transfer some of their shares in TWG (an aggregate of 1% of TWG\u2019s shares per $1m shortfall, up to a maximum of 10%) to OSIM at a nominal price of $1.', '(b)\\u2003If the audited PBT exceeded $27m, OSIM would transfer some of its shares in TWG (1% of TWG\u2019s shares per $1m excess, up to a maximum of 10%) to Wellness and Paris at a nominal price of $1.', '5\\u2003TWG\u2019s audited PBT for FY2013 turned out to be about $5.5m. On 9 April 2013, OSIM invoked the Profit Swing Clause and acquired 10% of the total shares in TWG from Wellness and Paris for a nominal consideration of $1 to each of them. TWG\u2019s shareholding after this transaction (\u201cthe Profit Swing Transaction\u201d) was as follows: Wellness (46.3%), OSIM (45%) and Paris (8.7%). On 18 October 2013, OSIM purchased all the shares in Paris, thereby acquiring a majority of TWG\u2019s shares. OSIM also appointed two persons as directors of TWG, thereby acquiring control of TWG\u2019s board.', '6\\u2003In November 2013, TWG proposed a rights issue (\u201cthe Rights Issue\u201d) to raise capital. This was approved by Paris and OSIM. Wellness did not subscribe for the Rights Issue. On 18 January 2014, OSIM and Paris together subscribed for the entire 77,000 shares available under the Rights Issue, as a result of which their combined shareholding in TWG became 69.9% (58.6% to OSIM and 11.3% to Paris), while Wellness\u2019 shareholding was further diluted to 30.1%.', '7\\u2003In February 2014, Wellness and Mr Murjani commenced Suit No 187 of 2014 (\u201cSuit 187\u201d) against OSIM, Paris and the directors of TWG (including Mr Sim) for minority oppression, conspiracy to injure and breach of contract. They sought to set aside the Profit Swing Transaction and the Rights Issue. Suit 187 was dismissed by the High Court: see The Wellness Group Pte Ltd and another v OSIM International Ltd and others and another suit [2016] 3 SLR 729 (\u201cWellness v OSIM\u201d). That decision was upheld in Civil Appeal No 64 of 2016 (\u201cCA 64\u201d), and costs orders were made against Wellness in respect of both the appeal and Suit 187.', '8\\u2003On 10 January 2017, EQ Capital filed Suit 17. Its claims are fivefold:', '(a)\\u2003First, Mr and Mrs Murjani caused Wellness to breach its obligations under the SHA, its Memorandum and Articles of Association and the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe Companies Act\u201d) by causing Wellness not to convene any Annual General Meeting (\u201cAGM\u201d); not to file any annual returns with the Registrar of Companies; and not to prepare, file and provide EQ Capital with Wellness\u2019 audited accounts from the financial year ending 31 March 2011 (\u201cFY2011\u201d) to date. Consequently, EQ Capital has been and continues to be deprived of its right to attend and participate in AGMs and to review the audited accounts of Wellness. We refer to this as \u201cthe AGM\/Accounts Claim\u201d.', '(b)\\u2003Second, Mr Murjani caused Wellness\u2019 shareholding in TWG to be diluted as a result of the Profit Swing Transaction. The Profit Swing Clause was based on the profit projections which Mr Murjani had presented to OSIM (see [3] above), and which he knew to be unreliable or unsupported. The dilution of Wellness\u2019 shareholding in TWG as a result of the Profit Swing Transaction in turn damaged EQ Capital\u2019s interest in TWG as a shareholder of Wellness. We refer to this as \u201cthe Profit Swing Claim\u201d.', '(c)\\u2003Third, Mr and Mrs Murjani caused Wellness\u2019 shareholding in TWG to be further diluted by failing to cause Wellness to subscribe for the Rights Issue. We refer to this as \u201cthe Rights Issue Claim\u201d.', '(d)\\u2003Fourth, Mr and Mrs Murjani failed to protect Wellness\u2019 interests by failing to cause Wellness to appoint a director to TWG\u2019s board after Mr Murjani resigned from the board on 28 September 2012. We refer to this as \u201cthe Appointment Claim\u201d. (In this regard, we should point out that one of the High Court\u2019s findings in Suit 187, which was undisturbed in CA 64, was that the following term should be implied into the SHA: \u201cthe majority shareholder(s) (whoever they may be) would be entitled to appoint two directors, and the minority shareholder(s) would be entitled to appoint one director so long as they hold at least 25% of the shares in TWG\u201d (see Wellness v OSIM at [121]). Since Wellness held 30.1% of the shares in TWG at the time the decision in CA 64 was rendered, it was entitled to appoint one director to TWG\u2019s board. In October 2016, Wellness sought to appoint Mr Murjani as a director of TWG, but this was rejected by TWG, OSIM and Paris. Subsequently, in February 2017, Wellness sought to have another person, Associate Professor Mak Yuen Teen (\u201cAssociate Professor Mak\u201d), appointed as a director of TWG, but this was rejected by TWG as well. Wellness then applied to the court for an order that Associate Professor Mak be appointed to TWG\u2019s board. Its application was dismissed at first instance (see The Wellness Group Pte Ltd v TWG Tea Co Pte Ltd and others [2017] SGHC 298), but it was allowed on appeal (see The Wellness Group Pte Ltd v Paris Investment Pte Ltd and others [2018] SGCA 47).)', '(e)\\u2003Fifth, Mr and\/or Mrs Murjani caused Wellness to commence Suit 187 and CA 64 even though they knew and\/or ought to have known that the proceedings were without merit, and\/or were reckless as to whether Wellness had good grounds for bringing Suit 187, thereby exposing Wellness to the costs orders made against it in Suit 187 and CA 64. Mr and\/or Mrs Murjani also caused Wellness to obtain loans amounting to $3.1m from Sunbreeze in order to foot Wellness\u2019 legal fees. We refer to this as \u201cthe Costs Claim\u201d.', '9\\u2003On the basis of these claims, EQ Capital seeks the following reliefs:', '(a)\\u2003an order that Mr and Mrs Murjani compensate and pay Wellness the loss in value which Wellness suffered by reason of the dilution of its shareholding in TWG;', '(b)\\u2003an order that Sunbreeze and\/or Mr Murjani and\/or Mrs Murjani repay Wellness to the extent that Wellness\u2019 funds were used to pay the costs and disbursements ordered against it in Suit 187 and CA 64;', '(c)\\u2003an order that Sunbreeze and\/or Mr Murjani and\/or Mrs Murjani reimburse Wellness such part of the $3.1m worth of loans that Wellness repaid to Sunbreeze using its own funds; and', '(d)\\u2003an order that Wellness be wound up, or that Sunbreeze and\/or Mr Murjani and\/or Mrs Murjani be made to purchase EQ Capital\u2019s shares in Wellness at a fair value.', '10\\u2003The appellants in turn commenced third party proceedings against Mr Sim for a contribution or an indemnity. Their position is that Mr Sim was the \u201calter ego and\/or controlling mind and will\u201d of EQ Capital as well as the \u201calter ego and\/or controlling shareholder\u201d of OSIM at the material time. In both their defence and their third party statement of claim (\u201cTPSOC\u201d), the appellants attribute various acts undertaken by EQ Capital and OSIM to Mr Sim. Their defence to the five claims set out above and their corresponding third party claims against Mr Sim may be stated briefly as follows.', '11\\u2003First, the appellants\u2019 defence to the AGM\/Accounts Claim is that Mr Sim and\/or OSIM deliberately delayed the finalisation of TWG\u2019s audited accounts for FY2011 when they disagreed with Wellness over the price at which TWG would sell its products to OSIM-TWG Tea (North Asia) Pte Ltd (\u201cthe JV Company\u201d), a joint venture set up between OSIM and TWG. This in turn delayed the finalisation of Wellness\u2019 audited accounts for FY2011 as those accounts had to reflect TWG\u2019s revenue and profits. Moreover, in November 2013, when Wellness was in the process of finalising its audited accounts, Mr Sim and\/or EQ Capital alleged that a $25.5m dividend payment by Wellness which they had approved more than two years earlier by way of a shareholders\u2019 resolution dated 31 March 2011 was wrongful. This was done in order to illegitimately pressurise the appellants into agreeing to a sale of Wellness\u2019 shares in TWG to OSIM. The TPSOC repeats these allegations.', '12\\u2003Second, the appellants\u2019 defence to the Profit Swing Claim is that Mr Sim and\/or OSIM brought about the dilution of Wellness\u2019 shareholding in TWG by invoking the Profit Swing Clause. Moreover, as Mr Sim benefited from the Profit Swing Transaction through OSIM, it would be an abuse of the court\u2019s process for him to bring the Profit Swing Claim through EQ Capital for the latter\u2019s alleged loss arising from the same transaction. The appellants\u2019 argument appears to be that any such loss should be attributed to Mr Sim as the alter ego of EQ Capital, while the corresponding gain from the Profit Swing Transaction was also made by Mr Sim, but this time as the alter ego of OSIM. In any event, any dilution of EQ Capital\u2019s interest in TWG is not in itself unfairly prejudicial to EQ Capital\u2019s interests as a shareholder of Wellness. The TPSOC repeats the allegation that Mr Sim and\/or OSIM brought about the Profit Swing Transaction. According to the TPSOC, the Profit Swing Clause was based on profit projections which were in turn premised on TWG selling its products to the JV Company at a certain franchise price. However, Mr Sim and\/or OSIM caused TWG to sell its products to the JV Company at levels which were substantially below that franchise price. This reduced TWG\u2019s audited PBT for FY2013 to about $5.5m, thereby enabling OSIM to invoke the Profit Swing Clause.', '13\\u2003Third, the appellants\u2019 defence to the Rights Issue Claim is that they honestly believed that it was not in Wellness\u2019 interests to subscribe for the Rights Issue. Moreover, Mr Sim caused TWG to initiate the Rights Issue despite knowing that Wellness was not in a position to subscribe for any shares thereunder. Mr Sim also failed to provide Wellness with adequate notice of the extraordinary general meeting convened to approve the Rights Issue; did not address Wellness\u2019 concerns in relation to the Rights Issue; and did not give Wellness adequate information pertaining to the Rights Issue. The appellants further contend that the Rights Issue ultimately benefited Mr Sim and was brought about by him and\/or Paris and OSIM, and it would therefore be an abuse of the court\u2019s process for Mr Sim to bring the Rights Issue Claim through EQ Capital for loss allegedly suffered by the latter arising from the Rights Issue. In any event, any dilution of EQ Capital\u2019s interest in TWG is not in itself unfairly prejudicial to EQ Capital\u2019s interests as a shareholder of Wellness. The appellants also argue that Mr and Mrs Murjani owed no duty to EQ Capital to cause Wellness to subscribe for the Rights Issue, and EQ Capital therefore lacks the standing to sue them. The TPSOC repeats each of these allegations in so far as they relate to Mr Sim.', '14\\u2003Fourth, the appellants\u2019 defence to the Appointment Claim is that they did not cause Wellness to appoint a director to TWG\u2019s board while Suit 187 was underway, and their attempts to have Wellness appoint a director after CA 64 concluded were obstructed by Mr Sim and\/or OSIM, who refused to accept Wellness\u2019 appointment of Mr Murjani in October 2016. In any event, any failure to cause Wellness to appoint a director to TWG\u2019s board is not in itself unfairly prejudicial to EQ Capital\u2019s interests as a shareholder of Wellness. The TPSOC repeats the allegation that Mr Sim and\/or OSIM obstructed Wellness from appointing a director to TWG\u2019s board following the disposal of CA 64.', '15\\u2003Fifth, the appellants\u2019 defence to the Costs Claim is that EQ Capital is not a proper party and\/or lacks the standing to claim the costs and disbursements which Wellness was ordered to pay in Suit 187 and CA 64. Further, the appellants contend that EQ Capital is not acting in good faith or in Wellness\u2019 best interests in bringing Suit 17. They also aver that the Costs Claim, if upheld, would give rise to double recovery of the costs and disbursements which Wellness was ordered to pay in Suit 187 and CA 64 since EQ Capital and Mr Sim have not undertaken to pay any amounts recovered in Suit 17 to Wellness. We observe in passing that it is not clear to us why any such undertaking should have been forthcoming, given that what EQ Capital prays for in its statement of claim in Suit 17 is (among other reliefs) payment to Wellness of the sums which Wellness paid in respect of the costs and disbursements ordered against it in Suit 187 and CA 64 (see [9(b)] above), but nothing turns on this for the purposes of the present appeal. The appellants also plead in their defence that Mr Murjani and Wellness commenced Suit 187 because they honestly and reasonably believed that the Rights Issue was engineered by Mr Sim and\/or OSIM as an act of minority oppression. The TPSOC states that the appellants commenced Suit 187 and CA 64 in order to set aside and\/or invalidate the Profit Swing Transaction and the Rights Issue in that honest and reasonable belief.', '16\\u2003The TPSOC also avers that EQ Capital\u2019s veil of incorporation should be lifted because Mr Sim, who is EQ Capital\u2019s alter ego and\/or controlling mind and will, is using it as a facade to benefit from the very acts which he brought about through OSIM. Further and\/or in the alternative, the TPSOC avers that Mr Sim acted in bad faith and\/or in an unconscionable manner and\/or in abuse of the court\u2019s process in bringing Suit 17 through EQ Capital with a view to unjustly enriching himself. In this regard, it is said that the benefits which Mr Sim derived from the Profit Swing Transaction, the Rights Issue and the costs orders made in Suit 187 and CA 64 form the subject of the reliefs which he seeks through EQ Capital in Suit 17 (see [9] above), and it would be unconscionable for him to be allowed to benefit from these reliefs.'"}

The third and fourth contracts were with PTT. The fourth contract (\u201cthe 4th Contract\u201d) was made on around 3 October 2014 and was for the purchase of styrene monomer, which was also the subject matter of the contract in issue here (\u201cthe Contract\u201d). 4', '9\\u2003The Four Contracts were concluded in the same way. 5', 'The parties would first negotiate over the telephone. They would then agree on certain key terms that would be reflected in emails or other correspondence. Finally, PTT or PTT Public would send a Supply Agreement to Vinmar. This would contain the full terms of the parties\u2019 contract. There were four Supply Agreements (\u201cthe Four Agreements\u201d) corresponding to the Four Contracts. 6', 'Notably, none of the Four Agreements included an execution page for the parties\u2019 signature. We agree with Vinmar that this indicates that the parties intended the terms in the Four Agreements to be binding even without formal execution of those agreements. 7', '10\\u2003All of the Four Agreements contained broadly two kinds of terms. There were terms specific to the contract in question, such as terms pertaining to product, quantity, price and delivery. In addition, there were several identical provisions \u2013 for example, regarding insurance and limitation of liability \u2013 which appear to be standard terms on which PTT and PTT Public contract. One such term found in all of the Four Agreements was the following exclusive jurisdiction clause (\u201cthe EJC\u201d): 8', '11\\u2003In November 2014, Vinmar required styrene monomer to fulfil its obligations under a contract to sell the same to its customer (\u201cVisen\u201d). 9', 'On or around 20 November 2014, Mr Sumit Verma of Vinmar (\u201cMr Verma\u201d) met Mr Bhuvarahan Krishnan (\u201cMr Krishnan\u201d) of PTT to discuss terms for Vinmar to purchase around 3,000mt of styrene monomer (\u201cthe Cargo\u201d) from PTT.', '12\\u2003On 21 November 2014, Mr Krishnan sent an email to Mr Verma (\u201cthe Deal Recap\u201d). 10', 'The Deal Recap set out several key terms including the product to be sold, its quality, quantity, origin and price, and the mode and timing of payment. The term on price provided for the price of the Cargo to be determined based on certain published prices (for styrene monomer) for November 2014.

{"casename":"2018_SGCA_66","fact":"'6\\u2003The respondent, WCS Engineering Construction Pte Ltd (\u201cthe respondent\u201d) was the main contractor for the construction of a development known as \u201cThe Hillford\u201d, which comprises 281 residential units. The Hillford is specially designed with features and facilities to accommodate the elderly. The respondent engaged the appellant, Glaziers Engineering Pte Ltd (\u201cthe appellant\u201d) under a subcontract to carry out aluminium, stainless steel and glazing works, including the fabrication, supply and installation of shower screens in all bathrooms in The Hillford (\u201cthe subcontract\u201d). The appellant commenced work in February 2015 and completed work in October 2016 (GD at [4]\u2013[6]). It then issued its final progress claim under the subcontract. This final progress claim eventually became the basis of the appellant\u2019s adjudication application (GD at [7]).', '7\\u2003After construction of The Hillford concluded in October 2016, The Hillford\u2019s temporary occupation permit was issued and the flats were handed over to the subsidiary proprietors (GD at [4]).', '8\\u2003From October 2016 to January 2017, the sliding doors in the shower screens of at least eight units in The Hillford shattered while they were in use. Many of these incidents resulted in personal injuries (GD at [8]). This triggered a series of meetings and correspondence between the appellant, the respondent, the developer of The Hillford (\u201cthe developer\u201d) and the developer\u2019s architect, in which the parties discussed the cause of the shattering shower screens as well as possible solutions to the problem.', '9\\u2003In gist, the respondent took the position that the appellant was responsible for the shattering shower screens either because it had used defective materials or had installed the shower screens with defective workmanship, and had generally failed to complete the works in compliance with the subcontract. The respondent thus stated that it would look to the appellant for damages for, and an indemnity against, all losses arising from the negligent installation of the shower screens, including the use of defective materials. The respondent also refused to pay the appellant the final progress claim (GD at [9]\u2013[10] and [14]).', '10\\u2003The appellant denied the respondent\u2019s allegations, and averred that the shower screens had been fabricated and installed according to shop drawings and mock-ups approved by the respondent\u2019s consultants. The appellant also took the position that any remedial work which the respondent might require would amount to a variation of the subcontract, to be carried out at the respondent\u2019s own cost (GD at [12]).', '11\\u2003On 13 February 2017, the developer\u2019s architect told the respondent that there were two causes for the shattering: First, the shower frames required a 30mm buffer between the edge of the screen and the wall in order to avoid the edge striking the wall when the sliding shower door was opened. However, some shower frames had been installed without this 30mm buffer. Secondly, the rollers in the aluminium tracks for the shower screens allowed the screens to slide too freely when opened. This meant the shower screens might strike the walls at high speeds, shattering as a result. The developer\u2019s architect required the respondent to address the problem by installing rubber studs along the aluminium tracks, applying plastic seals along the leading edge of the shower screens, and laminating the shower screens with safety film so that if they shattered, the shards of glass would be held in place to prevent injury (GD at [15]\u2013[16]).', '12\\u2003The appellant agreed to replace, at its own cost and without admission of liability, the shower screens which had shattered. However, it refused to perform the other remedial measures required by the developer\u2019s architect unless the respondent accepted that they would amount to a variation of the subcontract. Ultimately, the respondent and the developer made their own arrangements to have the remedial work carried out. The respondent apparently bore the cost of this remedial work and also reimbursed the medical expenses of the residents who had suffered personal injuries due to the shattering shower screens (GD at [17]\u2013[18]).', '13\\u2003On 22 February 2017, the appellant served a payment claim on the respondent within the meaning of s 10 of the Act. The claim was for $204,279.96, covering all work done under the subcontract which remained unpaid. This included $109,910.40 for the supply and installation of the shower screens (GD at [19]\u2013[20]). The respondent served a payment response on 7 March 2017, by which it sought to back charge $78,659.96 to the appellant for \u201cCOSTING INCURED [sic] FOR THE SHATTERING OF SHOWER SCREEN\u201d. This included medical claims from residents which the respondent had reimbursed, attendance costs incurred by the respondent and the developer in dealing with the issue, and the costs of the remedial measures taken to address the problem. The respondent also made certain other deductions and adjustments in its payment response. According to the respondent, taking all these deductions into account, it was the appellant which owed the respondent about $3,000 (GD at [21]).', '14\\u2003On 29 March 2017, the appellant applied under s 13 of the Act to have its claim adjudicated. In its adjudication application, the appellant accepted as valid certain deductions and adjustments which the respondent had made in the payment response. It thus reduced its claim from $204,279.96 to $95,840.91. It maintained, however, that the respondent was not entitled to back charge the appellant for $78,659.96 in costs arising from the shattering shower screens. The appellant\u2019s adjudication application was accompanied by a set of written submissions in which the appellant provided its reasons for rejecting the back-charge. The appellant argued, among other things, that the respondent had \u201cproduced insufficient evidence to prove that the shattered glass incident [was] due to the fault of the [appellant]\u201d, 1', 'and that the respondent \u201c[had] not set out a sufficient explanation\u201d of why it was withholding certain sums comprising the back charge, 2', 'and further that the back charge included costs of work which was outside the appellant\u2019s scope of work (GD at [24]).', '15\\u2003The respondent filed an adjudication response on 6 April 2017. It maintained that it was entitled to deduct $78,659.96 from the appellant\u2019s claim. Among other things, it argued that the appellant had not installed the shower screens in accordance with the approved drawings. The respondent also averred that it had given sufficient particulars relating to the back charge in its payment response (GD at [25]\u2013[26]).', '16\\u2003After the parties agreed that the adjudicator would have until 15 May 2017 to issue his determination (GD at [28]), the adjudicator fixed an adjudication conference for 27 April 2017. Both parties lodged further written submissions in anticipation of this conference on 24 April 2017 (GD at [29]). In addition, the respondent also filed a set of skeletal arguments on the same day responding to the appellant\u2019s written submissions (GD at [35]).', '17\\u2003In this round of submissions, the appellant specifically argued that the respondent had failed to meet its \u201cburden of proof\u201d. In particular, the appellant argued that the adjudicator was required to take a \u201crobust approach\u201d to deciding whether the respondent could set off the costs arising from the shattering screens against the payment claim, 3', 'but it was impossible for the adjudicator to do this because the respondent had \u201cfailed to provide sufficient evidence to discharge its burden of proof\u201d (GD at [31]). The appellant further submitted that the adjudicator could not address the respondent\u2019s alleged entitlement to set-off without a \u201cfact-intensive investigation and expert evidence on the issues\u201d, and such an exercise was unsuitable to be undertaken in proceedings under the Act (GD at [31]). In response, the respondent\u2019s skeletal arguments asserted that the respondent had produced sufficient evidence and particulars. However, neither party proffered a test or standard against which the sufficiency of the evidence ought to be assessed (GD at [34] and [36]).', '18\\u2003Similarly, when the adjudication conference took place on 27 April 2017, the parties (both represented by counsel) did not specifically address the adjudicator on the applicable standard against which to assess whether the respondent had established its entitlement to set-off. The adjudicator did not invite either party to address him on this issue (GD at [37]).', '19\\u2003On 15 May 2017, the adjudicator released his written adjudication determination. He allowed the appellant\u2019s claim in full without making any deduction for the costs arising from the shattering shower screens, which the respondent had sought to back charge to the appellant (GD at [39]). In his view, whether the respondent was entitled to set off this back charge against the appellant\u2019s claim turned on two questions, which he framed for himself as follows:', '20\\u2003It appears that the adjudicator\u2019s view that he should be satisfied that the appellant was responsible for the shattering shower screens \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d stemmed from his understanding that he should take a \u201crobust approach\u201d in examining the respondent\u2019s back charge. This is clear from the following extracts from the adjudication determination:', '21\\u2003The \u201creasons set out in para. 50 to 55 above\u201d referred to six doubts which the adjudicator identified in relation to the question of whether the appellant was responsible for the shattering shower screens. These doubts may be summarised as follows:', '(a)\\u2003There were scientific investigative procedures which could have been carried out to determine whether the appellant was responsible for the shattering shower screens, and to what extent. The parties\u2019 submissions had revealed that some investigative procedures might have been carried out by the respondent, but no reports or documents were presented as evidence to the adjudicator, which he \u201cfound strange\u201d. Without such a specialist report, the adjudicator was \u201cunable to reach a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt\u201d on the extent of the appellant\u2019s responsibility for the shattering shower screens. 4', '(b)\\u2003There was no evidence of the specifications which the appellant was required to comply with under the subcontract, and no evidence to show that the appellant had failed to comply with any such specifications. 5', '(c)\\u2003There was no evidence of any guideline or code stipulating that shower frames required a 30mm gap between the wall and the sliding door in order to avoid the shattering of glass panels. Further, there were many units within the Hillford which did not have the requisite 30mm buffer and yet had not reported any shattering shower screens. 6', '(d)\\u2003It appeared to the adjudicator that the shower doors had been designed in such a way that the door openings were too narrow, given that guidelines set by the Building and Construction Authority (\u201cBCA\u201d) suggested that shower areas designed to accommodate the elderly should have openings of at least 800mm in width, to accommodate wheelchair use. The adjudicator was unsure which party should be liable for breakages arising from this apparent flaw in the design. 7', '(e)\\u2003A shower screen had shattered in one unit even after the remedial works suggested by the developer\u2019s architect had been carried out. This cast doubt on the efficacy of the respondent\u2019s remedial measures, the costs of which it sought to back charge to the appellant. 8', '(f)\\u2003One of the documents which the respondent relied upon in the adjudication asserted that shower screens had shattered in three units which were mentioned nowhere else in the respondent\u2019s submissions. This raised further doubts as to the accuracy of the respondent\u2019s submissions. 9', '22\\u2003The adjudicator thus concluded that the appellant was entitled to receive substantially the whole of its claim, subject to some minor deductions. The adjudicator also awarded the appellant interest on this sum, and 50% of the costs of the adjudication.', '23\\u2003The respondent commenced Originating Summons No 662 of 2017 on 14 June 2017, seeking to have the adjudication determination set aside on four separate grounds. It is unnecessary to delve into the details of all but one of these grounds: namely, that the adjudicator breached his obligation under s 16(3)(c) of the Act to comply with the principles of natural justice by failing to give the respondent an opportunity to address him on the applicable standard of persuasion. The Judge considered that the other three grounds relied upon by the respondent for setting aside the adjudication determination were subsidiary to this main point, and it therefore formed the focus of his decision, as well as this appeal.'"}
{"casename":"2018_SGCA_67","fact":"'3\\u2003ERCP II and GREIC, the two companies that are the subject of these appeals, are investment holding companies set up by Ong Siew Kwee (\u201cAndy Ong\u201d) and his associates pursuant to two joint ventures that he entered into with Foo sometime in 2009 or 2010. The first venture was the acquisition and development of what was known as the Big Hotel located at 200 Middle Road, Singapore; and the second was the acquisition and development of units in a mall known as Bugis Cube located at 470 North Bridge Road, Singapore. We will refer to these ventures as \u201cthe Big Hotel project\u201d and \u201cthe Bugis Cube project\u201d respectively.', '4\\u2003ERC Unicampus Pte Ltd (\u201cERCU\u201d) is a corporate vehicle that was incorporated for the purposes of acquiring and holding the Big Hotel project. Its shareholders include ERCP II, through which Foo made his investment in the project, and other special purpose vehicles (\u201cSPVs\u201d) set up by Andy Ong and his associates. ERCP II is the subject of CA 196, an appeal arising out of CWU 143.', '5\\u2003ERCP II is an investment holding company incorporated in November 2010. Clause 3.2 of its shareholders\u2019 agreement dated 21 February 2011 states that its \u201cprincipal business\u201d is to invest in the project of acquiring, converting and managing the Big Hotel through ERCU. At the time of the application below, it held 32.24% of the shares in ERCU. Aside from these shares, ERCP II has no business of its own and no other valuable asset. The Big Hotel property has been sold and most of the investment returns distributed. ERCP II therefore only has the following assets at present:', '(a)\\u2003a claim to a share of a security deposit of $3.75m that was returned by the purchaser of the Big Hotel property to ERCU and is presently held by ERCU (\u201cthe Security Deposit\u201d), and', '(b)\\u2003a potential claim to a share of $33.45m held in escrow by Rajah & Tann Singapore LLP (\u201cR&T\u201d) (\u201cthe Escrow Sum\u201d) as solicitors for ERCP II, pending the determination of Originating Summons No 1004 of 2017 (\u201cOS 1004\u201d) brought against ERCU by Griffin Real Estate Investment Holdings Pte Ltd (\u201cGREIH\u201d) for the Escrow Sum to be paid to it. The Escrow Sum is currently held by R&T pursuant to a settlement agreement dated 3 December 2016 between the parties in Originating Summons No 924 of 2015 (\u201cOS 924\u201d), which included ERCP II and ERCU. We will elaborate on GREIH and these related actions later (see [16] and [26]\u2013[27]).', '6\\u2003According to Foo, ERCP II also has some interest in a $5m retention sum held by Dentons Rodyk & Davidson LLP, the law firm that acted as the solicitors for the purchasers of the Big Hotel property from ERCU (\u201cthe Retention Sum\u201d). The context of this sum is not entirely clear but, in any case, this is not a material point for the purposes of this appeal.', '7\\u2003According to information provided by counsel for Foo, ERCP II\u2019s board composition since its incorporation is as follows:', '8\\u2003Based on the additional evidence sought to be adduced on appeal, which we will elaborate on below, it turns out that both Andy Ong and Ong HB have been disqualified from holding any directorship since 13 March 2017. Ong HB averred that he had only found out about his disqualification on or around 1 August 2018 and had since ceased to be involved in ERCP II\u2019s management. Thus, Stephen Tan in effect became ERCP II\u2019s sole director from that point. On 29 August 2018, which was a few days before the hearing of this appeal, Chia Puay Khiang (\u201cChia\u201d) was appointed a co-director of ERCP II by a directors\u2019 resolution to which Stephen Tan was the sole signatory. The propriety of this appointment is disputed.', '9\\u2003As for ERCP II\u2019s shareholders, they comprise several individual investors, as well as Foo, Tan, Ainon and ERC Holdings Pte Ltd (\u201cERC Holdings\u201d):', '(a)\\u2003Foo held 19.8% of the total issued and paid up shares in ERCP II as of October 2017.', '(b)\\u2003ERC Holdings held around 9.24% of the shares in ERCP II as of July 2017. This is the ultimate holding company of several of Andy Ong\u2019s SPVs (collectively termed the \u201cERC Group\u201d). It was incorporated on 13 May 1999 by Andy Ong, who was its majority shareholder (with a 91.85% shareholding) until 15 May 2017, which was shortly after the release of the judgment of the High Court in Suit Nos 122 and 1098 of 2013 (collectively, \u201cthe Suits\u201d), which are suits to which he was party and which we refer to at [17] below. That judgment was adverse to Andy Ong, and after its release, he transferred all his shares in ERC Holdings to his sister, Ong Geok Yen (\u201cOng GY\u201d). Andy Ong was also a director of ERC Holdings until 15 February 2016 when Ong GY took over. At the time of the hearing below, ERC Holdings\u2019 directors were Ong GY and Ong Geok Hong Lydia, who is another of Andy Ong\u2019s sisters. Apart from its shareholding in ERCP II, ERC Holdings also purportedly acquired shares in ERCU in October 2013 through the exercise of a share option, the legitimacy of which is presently disputed.', '(c)\\u2003Tan and Ainon are shareholders and collectively hold around 3.96% of ERCP II\u2019s issued shares as at July 2017. As noted above (at [1]), they oppose the winding up of ERCP II.', '10\\u2003There was nothing to suggest that the relevant parties\u2019 shareholdings had materially changed by the time the appeal was heard before us.', '11\\u2003We turn to the sequence of relevant events relating to the Big Hotel project.', '12\\u2003On 14 October 2010, ERC Holdings obtained an option to purchase the Big Hotel property, which was exercised by ERCU on 3 November 2010. The total purchase price of the property was $103m.', '13\\u2003By October 2013, almost three years after this, a total of five SPVs, including ERCP II, had been set up for unrelated individual investors to participate in the Big Hotel project. A shareholders\u2019 agreement was entered into in respect of each SPV. However, Andy Ong continued to make the principal commercial and management decisions for the project and, for this purpose, he used another of his vehicles, a company known as Gryphon Estate Management Pte Ltd (\u201cGEM\u201d). The payment of management fees by ERCU to GEM is one of the issues in dispute.', '14\\u2003On 17 November 2015, the Big Hotel property was sold for $203m. Prior approval for the sale was obtained from ERCU\u2019s shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting (\u201cEGM\u201d) of the company that was held two months earlier on 17 September 2015.', '15\\u2003In 2016 and early 2017, a large part of the investment returns from the Big Hotel project was distributed to the various shareholders of ERCU and, in turn, by them to their respective shareholders. At the time of the hearing below, the proceeds had been distributed to the shareholders of ERCP II, and ERCP II\u2019s only remaining interest was its proportional share of the Security Deposit, the Escrow Sum, and possibly the Retention Sum (see [5] above).', '16\\u2003In respect of the Bugis Cube project, GREIH is the corporate vehicle through which the investment was to be made and held. For present purposes, it suffices to note that save for a period between May 2012 and April 2017, GREIH has had two shareholders: Sakae Holdings Ltd (\u201cSakae\u201d), which held 24.69% of its issued share capital, and GREIC, which held the remaining 75.31%. These two shareholders represent (in a loose sense of the term) Foo\u2019s and Andy Ong\u2019s interests in the venture respectively.', '17\\u2003GREIH has been the subject of extensive litigation before our courts. On 7 April 2017, the High Court issued its judgment in respect of the Suits in Sakae Holdings Ltd v Gryphon Real Estate Investment Corp Pte Ltd and others (Foo Peow Yong Douglas, third party) and another suit [2017] SGHC 73 (\u201cSakae (HC)\u201d) in which it found, amongst other things, that Andy Ong and Ong HB, as directors of GREIH at the material time, had engaged in oppressive conduct towards Sakae, which was the minority shareholder in GREIH. Consequently, GREIH was ordered to be wound up (see Sakae (HC) at [293]). We upheld this aspect of the High Court\u2019s decision on 29 June 2018: see Ho Yew Kong v Sakae Holdings Ltd and other appeals and other matters [2018] 2 SLR 333 (\u201cSakae (CA)\u201d). GREIH is therefore now in the control of court-appointed liquidators. The relevance to the present appeals of certain adverse findings made against Andy Ong and Ong HB in Sakae (HC) and Sakae (CA) is contested.', '18\\u2003The focus of CA 55 is, however, on GREIC. This is an investment holding company incorporated by Andy Ong in November 2009. Its sole asset is its 75.31% shareholding in GREIH. GREIC\u2019s memorandum of association (\u201cMOA\u201d) (as amended by special resolutions passed in 2010) lists seven objects, the first of which is to own the Bugis Cube project through GREIH for investment purposes for a minimum duration of 10 years commencing from the date of ownership, and the sixth of which is to distribute the sale proceeds from GREIC\u2019s assets to its shareholders. Clause 2.3 of a shareholders\u2019 agreement dated 31 August 2010 signed by the shareholders of GREIC, including Yap, also stated that the \u201cprincipal business\u201d of GREIC was to invest in the Bugis Cube project through GREIH.', '19\\u2003As for GREIC\u2019s board composition, the following may be gleaned from what was before us:', '20\\u2003As we mentioned above (see [8]), it transpired that Andy Ong and Ong HB had been disqualified from holding any directorship since 13 March 2017. According to Ong HB, he first learnt of this disqualification sometime on or about 1 August 2018 and had thereafter ceased to be involved in GREIC\u2019s management. Thus, just as with ERCP II, Stephen Tan effectively became GREIC\u2019s sole director and, by a directors\u2019 resolution to which he was the sole signatory, he purported to appoint Chia as a co-director on 29 August 2018.', '21\\u2003GREIC\u2019s shareholders comprised several unrelated individual investors as well as SPVs incorporated by Andy Ong and his associates. They include the following:', '(a)\\u2003Yap is a shareholder of GREIC and held around 3.19% of its issued share capital (400,000 out of a total of 12,555,000 issued shares) in September 2017 when CWU 146 was filed. Based on Yap\u2019s affidavits filed in CWU 146, as at 2 October 2017, 28 out of 45 shareholders holding 58.5% of GREIC\u2019s issued share capital supported his winding up application.', '(b)\\u2003Tan and Koh are also shareholders of GREIC and they oppose Yap\u2019s winding up application. As at September 2017, they collectively held around 3.19% of GREIC\u2019s issued share capital. They claim to be unrelated to the directors of GREIC.', '(c)\\u2003It appears that Andy Ong has some interest in GREIC, through ERC Holdings, which is one of the ultimate indirect holding companies of GREIC. Details regarding the management and shareholders in ERC Holdings have been set out at [9(b)] above. ERC Holdings held around 0.8% of GREIC\u2019s issued share capital as at September 2017.', '22\\u2003Again, there was nothing to suggest that the parties\u2019 shareholdings in GREIC had materially changed by the time of this appeal.', '23\\u2003As for the relevant events pertaining to the Bugis Cube project, on 3 September 2010, Sakae, GREIC and GREIH entered into a joint venture agreement that governed their investment in the Bugis Cube project. Pursuant to this agreement, GREIH purchased the Bugis Cube property for around $46m in March 2010. As was the case with the Big Hotel project, the plan was to develop and thereafter sell the Bugis Cube property for investment returns.', '24\\u2003About two years later, between June and October 2012, GREIH sold all the units in the first to fifth floors of the six-storey Bugis Cube property and received a total of $142.8m from the sale. According to Yap, GREIC\u2019s share of the investment returns was between $41m and $89m. However, GREIH has not yet distributed to its shareholders the proceeds from the partial sale of Bugis Cube, although the reasons for the delay are disputed. At the time of the hearing before us, the sixth floor of units in Bugis Cube, apparently valued at around $15m, remained unsold by GREIH.', '25\\u2003There are several related matters concerning the Big Hotel and Bugis Cube projects, of which two are directly relevant to the present appeals.', '26\\u2003OS 924 is a claim by Yap and some other investors against ERCU for, amongst other things, sale proceeds from the Big Hotel project to be held in escrow pending shareholder approval for its distribution. On 8 November 2016, the High Court dismissed the application. Based on its oral grounds, which are not sealed, the court decided as it did on the basis that the applicants, as shareholders of ERCP II and not of ERCU, did not have the requisite standing to sue. In so concluding, the court examined and rejected the applicants\u2019 argument that the corporate veil between ERCP II and ERCU should be pierced because the corporate structure was a mere fa\u00e7ade designed to defeat the applicants\u2019 rights and to frustrate the enforcement of their shareholder rights:', 'OS 924 was eventually settled after the decision of the High Court was issued, with a portion of the sale proceeds returned to the shareholders, and some monies remaining in the hands of ERCU held on escrow by R&T (see [5(b)] above).', '27\\u2003OS 1004 is GREIH\u2019s claim against ERCU in respect of the Escrow Sum. ERCP II is not a party to OS 1004. In Originating Summons No 471 of 2017, GREIH also obtained an injunction restraining ERCU from dealing with the Escrow Sum pending full disposal of OS 1004, which was still pending as at the hearing of this appeal.'"}

{"casename":"2018_SGCA_7","fact":"'11\\u2003Given that the disputed issue is a question of law of general applicability, the specific facts of the present case are of limited relevance to our decision. The facts are set out comprehensively in the first instance judgment of the Presiding Judge of the State Courts (\u201cthe Judge\u201d), Public Prosecutor v Lam Leng Hung and others [2015] SGDC 326 (\u201cthe Conviction GD\u201d), as well as the MA Judgment. They are also summarised in our grounds of decision on an application for leave to bring a criminal reference brought by the fourth respondent, Chew Eng Han v Public Prosecutor [2017] 2 SLR 1130 (\u201cChew Eng Han\u201d) at [6]\u2013[29]. For present purposes, it therefore suffices for us to only briefly recount the facts.', '12\\u2003CHC is a Singaporean \u201cmega-church\u201d that embarked on what it called \u201cthe Crossover\u201d project in 2002. This was a project that involved Ms Ho Yeow Sun (\u201cSun Ho\u201d), a co-founder of CHC and wife of the second respondent, Kong Hee, recording secular pop music albums as a means of evangelical outreach. At the same time, the church was actively looking for suitable premises to accommodate its growing congregation and raised large amounts of funds for this purpose through a pledge campaign. These donations were aggregated in a Building Fund (\u201cthe BF\u201d) and were meant to be used for the purchase of land, construction costs, rentals, furniture and fittings.', '13\\u2003The Crossover was a controversial project that gave rise to allegations within the church that CHC was giving excessive attention to Sun Ho and misusing its funds to promote her career. In response to these allegations, the CHC management board announced \u2013 both publicly and to the church\u2019s executive members (\u201cthe EMs\u201d) \u2013 that church funds had not been used to purchase Sun Ho\u2019s albums or to promote her career. This was untrue.', '14\\u2003Following the denouncement of the allegations, the six respondents, who were leaders of CHC, decided that greater distance should be placed between CHC and Sun Ho\u2019s music career to avoid further negative publicity. To this end, a separate company, Xtron Productions Pte Ltd (\u201cXtron\u201d), was incorporated in June 2003. Xtron was, in appearance, an independent firm which was to provide artiste management services to Sun Ho. But the Judge, with whom the High Court agreed, found that Xtron was in substance no more than an extension of CHC and was controlled entirely by the church, and in particular by Kong Hee, who was the senior pastor of CHC, and the fifth respondent, Tan Ye Peng (\u201cYe Peng\u201d), who was the deputy senior pastor. The directors of Xtron were no more than figureheads. From 2003, Xtron financed Sun Ho\u2019s music career using monies from various sources including donations and revenue from CHC. But these proceeds were deemed to be insufficient after it was resolved that the Crossover, and therefore Sun Ho\u2019s music career, should be extended to the USA. Eventually, a plan was hatched for Xtron to take a loan from CHC\u2019s BF, notwithstanding that the BF was a restricted fund meant to be used for building-related expenses. This loan took the form of a bond subscription agreement (\u201cthe Xtron BSA\u201d) under which a total of $13m was transferred from the BF to Xtron in exchange for Xtron bonds. The CHC board and the EMs of the church were led to believe that the monies from the BF were to be invested to generate financial returns, since the church was unlikely to acquire a building anytime soon. In reality, these monies were diverted to the Crossover.', '15\\u2003In mid-2008, the respondents came under pressure from CHC\u2019s auditors to disclose the true nature and purpose of the Xtron bonds, including the uncertainty of repayment (given that Xtron was consistently making losses) and the identity of Sun Ho as a \u201ckey player\u201d in Xtron. Seeking respite from the auditors, they made a decision to take Sun Ho out of Xtron. This would be accomplished by transferring her to another company, Ultimate Assets, and by way of another bond subscription agreement, this time between CHC and another company, PT The First National Glassware (\u201cFirna\u201d). Under this bond subscription agreement (\u201cthe Firna BSA\u201d), a further $11m was transferred from the BF to Firna. Firna was an Indonesian glassware manufacturing company. But the Firna bonds were never intended to be available for Firna\u2019s glass factory business, nor was Firna\u2019s revenue ever intended to go toward the redemption of the Firna bonds. Instead, as the courts below found, the respondents had complete control over the Firna bond proceeds and these monies were primarily used for the Crossover.', '16\\u2003In late 2009, after CHC\u2019s auditors raised further questions about the Xtron and Firna bonds, it was decided that the bonds had to be redeemed. Between October and December 2009, the respondents procured a series of transactions to redeem the Xtron and Firna bonds (\u201cthe round-tripping transactions\u201d).', '17\\u2003The round-tripping transactions involved two broad components:', '(a)\\u2003The transfer of funds totalling $11.4m from CHC\u2019s BF and General Fund (\u201cGF\u201d) to companies controlled by the respondents, purportedly as investments in a Special Opportunities Fund (\u201cSOF\u201d). These funds were then routed to Firna and paid back to CHC in order to redeem the Firna bonds.', '(b)\\u2003CHC entering into an Advance Rental License Agreement with Xtron (\u201cthe ARLA\u201d), under which Xtron set off $21.5m from the sum that CHC was to pay Xtron, in order to fully redeem the bonds it had issued to CHC. As part of the ARLA, CHC also transferred approximately $15.2m to Xtron as \u201cprepayment\u201d of advance rental. As the courts below found, the ARLA was not a genuine commercial agreement and its purpose was simply to facilitate the redemption of the Xtron bonds and the return of the monies owed to CHC under the SOF.', '18\\u2003To record these transactions, the respondents inserted accounting entries in CHC\u2019s General Journal. The courts below found that these entries were false as they did not capture the substance of the transactions, which were not genuine commercial transactions but were instead intended to create the false impression that the Xtron and Firna bonds had been redeemed through proper means.', '19\\u2003The net result of the round-tripping transactions was that the Xtron and Firna bonds were redeemed, and the liabilities owed to CHC under the SOF were discharged. Subsequently, the ARLA was terminated and Xtron repaid CHC a total of $40.5m, comprising the unutilised advance rental and security deposit paid under the ARLA (including interest). Although it is not exactly clear where Xtron obtained these funds from, it appears that a number of loans were granted to Xtron by various individuals affiliated to the respondents and CHC so that the company could make the necessary repayment to the church.', '20\\u2003Following investigations by the Commercial Affairs Department on the above facts, a total of 43 charges were brought against the six respondents. These have been characterised in the judgments below as the \u201csham investment charges\u201d, the \u201cround-tripping charges\u201d and the \u201caccount falsification charges\u201d:', '(a)\\u2003The three sham investment charges, which were brought against all the respondents save for the third respondent, Tan Shao Yuen Sharon (\u201cSharon\u201d), concerned the offence of conspiring to commit CBT as an agent punishable under s 409 read with s 109 of the Penal Code. These charges arose from the use of the BF to purchase the Xtron and Firna bonds. The relevant \u201cagents\u201d stated in the charges are Kong Hee, Ye Peng and the first respondent, Lam Leng Hung (\u201cJohn Lam\u201d), who were entrusted with the funds in their capacity as members of the CHC management board. The first sham investment charge was brought under the 1985 revised edition of the Penal Code (ie, the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed)), and the second and third charges were under the 2008 revised edition of the same Act (ie, the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed)). The only difference between the two versions of the Penal Code in relation to s 409 concerns the maximum non-life imprisonment term for the offence. This has no bearing on the present application, which concerns only the elements of the s 409 offence and not the sentences imposed, and all subsequent references to \u201cthe Penal Code\u201d in this judgment are to both revised editions of the legislation.', '(b)\\u2003The three round-tripping charges were brought against all the respondents except Kong Hee and John Lam. These charges are also for the offence of conspiring to commit CBT as an agent punishable under s 409 read with s 109 of the Penal Code, and they were brought on the basis that the BF and the GF had been misused in the round-tripping transactions. The relevant \u201cagent\u201d identified in these charges is Ye Peng, who was entrusted with the funds in his capacity as a member of the CHC management board.', '(c)\\u2003Four account falsification charges were brought against all the respondents except Kong Hee and John Lam. These charges are for the offence of falsification of accounts under s 477A read with s 109 of the Penal Code and they arose from the recording of false entries in CHC\u2019s General Journal (see [18] above).', 'For convenience, we will refer to the sham investment and round-tripping charges as \u201cthe CBT charges\u201d.'"}

Jega and the respondent had met in Singapore when the respondent was working as a security guard in the casino in Sentosa. The respondent claimed to have grown close to Jega as they were both working in Singapore. The respondent explained that he did not have many friends in Johor Bahru. Among his friends in Johor Bahru, Jega was the only one who went to clubs and discos. 8', 'The respondent therefore asked Jega about the \u201cchocolate drugs\u201d. In particular, the respondent asked Jega \u201cwhat are chocolate drugs\u201d and mentioned to him that they would be used in discos. 9', 'According to the respondent, Jega replied that \u201cif it is to be used in discos, it is not a very dangerous drug and that it is not a terrible drug\u201d. 10', '7\\u2003The respondent claimed that he believed Jega because Jega frequented discos and there was no reason why Jega would lie to him about this since Jega did not know Guru or Vinod.

The respondent also thought that since Guru was present at the meeting with Vinod and Guru was the respondent\u2019s friend, Vinod would not lie in front of Guru. This was also because they knew that the respondent was asking about the delivery because of his financial problems. The respondent claimed that he agreed to transport the drugs for Vinod for the above reasons.', '8\\u2003The respondent admitted that he had delivered similar bundles of drugs into Singapore on eight or nine previous occasions on his relative\u2019s motorcycle. 13', 'The first occasion took place a few days after 22 October 2014.

After arriving in Singapore, he was instructed by either Vinod or Guru to go to Admiralty Station. 19', 'Upon reaching Admiralty Station, the respondent called Vinod and was told to pass the packet to a man with a hunchback. 20', 'The respondent did as instructed.', '10\\u2003On the day of arrest on 11 December 2014, the respondent received and handled the drugs as described above. Before entering Singapore, the respondent picked up his friend, Chandra, so that they could travel together to Singapore for work.

A team of Central Narcotics Bureau (\u201cCNB\u201d) officers were notified and upon their arrival, the respondent and Chandra were escorted into a nearby empty garage for a strip search by the CNB officers.

{"casename":"2018_SGCA_74","fact":"'2\\u2003The respondent, Mr Yeo Chee Siong (\u201cMr Yeo\u201d), is 64 years old this year. He was a carpenter for a company called Salpac (S) Pte Ltd (\u201cSalpac\u201d) for nearly two decades. Every day before dawn, he was ferried to work from Woodlands, where he stayed, on a lorry owned by Salpac and, in the later part of his career with Salpac, driven by his colleague, Mr Chew Kong Seng (\u201cMr Chew\u201d). On the morning of 29 December 2012, Mr Yeo boarded the lorry but did not make it to work. The lorry had collided into a bus as result of being carelessly driven by Mr Chew. The accident caused Mr Chew\u2019s death. Mr Yeo, on the other hand, suffered serious injuries to his head and body. Although he has since made good recovery, he survives with permanent cognitive impairment of some measure, and with an aching and debilitated frame. He can no longer return to his trade and now works as a cleaner. In the event, he sought to recover damages in negligence from Salpac as well as from Mr Chew\u2019s estate, which is being administered by Mr Chew\u2019s widow, Mdm Lua Bee Kiang (\u201cMdm Lua\u201d), the appellant.', '3\\u2003In December 2015, Mr Yeo obtained interlocutory judgment against Mr Chew\u2019s estate and withdrew his claim against Salpac. The matter proceeded before the High Court for Mr Yeo\u2019s damages to be assessed. In August 2017, the High Court Judge (\u201cthe Judge\u201d) awarded Mr Yeo damages in the total sum of $576,626, and the reasons for her decision are set out in Yeo Chee Siong v Salpac (S) Pte Ltd and another [2017] SGHC 304 (\u201cthe GD\u201d). The Judge arrived at the total sum by using the \u201ccomponent\u201d method for assessing damages, by which she first awarded separate amounts for each item of loss and then added up the amounts to arrive at the total sum. Out of the total sum, $96,826 was for four items, namely, pre-trial loss of earnings, medical expenses, nursing home expenses and transport expenses. Before the Judge, Mdm Lua did not dispute that Mr Yeo was entitled to recover for that amount. But she challenged his claim for damages for four other heads of loss, namely, (a) pain, suffering and loss of amenity; (b) loss of earning capacity; (c) loss of future earnings and (d) cost of future nursing care.', '4\\u2003The Judge allowed Mr Yeo\u2019s claim on each of those four items. She awarded Mr Yeo $326,000 for pain, suffering and loss of amenity. This comprised $200,000 for his head injuries and $126,000 for his bodily injuries. She awarded him $72,000 for loss of future earnings and $5,000 for loss of earning capacity. And she awarded him $76,800 for the cost of future nursing care. In making this award, the Judge took into account the fact that Mr Yeo\u2019s brain injury had increased his risk of developing dementia in the last two to three years of his life, and that if the condition did manifest, he would need to be institutionalised. Accordingly, the award was for the cost of being placed in a nursing home for two years. In sum, the Judge allowed substantially the whole of Mr Yeo\u2019s claims. Mdm Lua now appeals against the Judge\u2019s decision on each of those four heads of loss.', '5\\u2003Mdm Lua argues that the Judge\u2019s award was manifestly excessive. On Mr Yeo\u2019s pain, suffering and loss of amenity, she complains that the Judge\u2019s award is based on a misapplication of the relevant assessment guidelines, does not account for overlapping injuries and is out of line with awards in previous cases where the claimants survived with much more severe permanent disabilities than Mr Yeo. Mdm Lua also argues that the Judge was wrong to apply the component method in this case, and asks that the award be reduced from $326,000 to $179,000. On Mr Yeo\u2019s loss of future earnings, Mdm Lua criticises the Judge for using a multiplier and a multiplicand that fail to account for contingencies, and asks that the award be reduced from $72,000 to $12,000. Mdm Lua also contends that Mr Yeo should be awarded nothing for loss of earning capacity because it has not been established on the evidence. And she argues that he should receive nothing for the cost of future nursing care because it is a speculative loss. In particular, she submits that Mr Yeo has not proved on a balance of probabilities that he will develop dementia in the future, and therefore ought not to be awarded the cost of nursing care for the purpose of managing that condition.', '6\\u2003Mr Yeo makes opposing submissions in relation to each of these four heads of loss. On the award for pain, suffering and loss of amenity, he contends that the Judge arrived at the right quantum by correctly applying the component method. He also submits that the award is not out of line with the precedents because he suffered more serious injuries than the claimants did in the cases relied upon by Mdm Lua. On loss of earning capacity and loss of future earnings, he disagrees with Mdm Lua that the Judge\u2019s awards were not supported by the evidence. He also submits that the Judge\u2019s award for loss of future earnings did account for the relevant contingencies. And he defends the Judge\u2019s award for cost of future nursing care on the basis that it is supported by the evidence.'"}
{"casename":"2018_SGCA_75","fact":"facts. \nTan Su Fern was a case where the court ordered the property to be sold in the \nopen market and there was thus no eventual owner to speak of. TJB v TJC \nconcerned the payment of monies before the date of the court order and not \nduring the interim period between the date of the court order  and the date of \ncompletion. Both these  cases thus pertained  to very different situations and do \nnot assist  us in the present case.\n20 For the foregoing reasons,  we affirm the Judge\u2019s decision in relation to \nthe mortgage payments. We hold that mortgage  payments during  the interim  \nperiod between  the date of the court order and the date of completion should \nprima facie be borne by the eventual owner  of the property given that any \npayment of the outstanding mortgage would solely benefit the said party. \nNevertheless, we emphasise, as did the Judge, that this is only a prima facie  \nposition that can be displaced in the appropriate circumstances (see the GD at \n[20]). Such situations  include, but are not limited to, instances  where it would \nbe unjust to order  the eventual owner to bear the ongoing liabilities, having \nregard to the distribution  of the other  matrimonial  assets or the ability of the \neventual owner to bear such liabilities. No such circumstances were raised  in \nthe present case and thus the prima facie  position that the Wife should bear the \nongoing liabilities is not displaced.\nProperty tax  payments\n21 Property  tax payments do not stand on the same footing as mortgage \npayments. Mortgage payments affect  the net equity of the property and thus \nshould be paid by the party which would benefit  from any changes in such net \nequity. In contrast, property tax payments  do not affect the net equity of the \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nTIC v TID [2018] SGCA 75\n10property and are instead  tariffs  levied on the ownership of the property,  \nindependent of its occupation or beneficial  use (see, eg, the Singapore High \nCourt decision of BFC Development  LLP v Comptroller  of Property Tax [2013]  \n1 SLR 1053 at [7]). Thus, in our judgment, the prima facie position is that such \npayments should  be borne  by the party who should be taken to be the owner of \nthe property, subject  to the power  of the court  to make a contrary order if the \ncircumstances so require (see [20]  above).\n22 In the context of the division of matrimonial property, the question of \nownership as at the date of the court order  depends  on what  would happen to \nthe matrimonial  property after the court  order.  In Sivakolunthu Kumarasamy  v \nShanmugam Nagaiah [1987] SLR 182 (\u201cSivakolunthu\u201d),  the matrimonial \nproperty was ordered to be sold in the open market  and the proceeds  to be \ndivided equally between  the husband and wife. Before  the sale could take place,  \nthe husband passed away. The wife claimed  that the entire property vested in \nher solely, by virtue of the rule of survivorship. This Court held that the rule of \nsurvivorship did not apply  because, from the date of the court order, the parties\u2019 \njoint tenancy over the property was severed  and they held the property as tenants  \nin common, with the result  that the husband\u2019s estate could claim his share of the \nproceeds once the property was sold (at [38]\u2013[39]). Thus,  where the division of \nmatrimonial assets is concerned, the court  has been prepared to recognise that \nthe ownership of the property  as at the date of the court order would reflect the \nterms of the order even if the actual  outcome  (in the case of Sivakolunthu , the \nsale of the property) has not  been  legally  effected.\n23 In the present case, the District  Judge\u2019s order  of 10 September 2015 gave \nthe Wife the option of taking over the property and she confirmed  at the hearings \nof 27 June and 31 August 2017 that she would be doing so (see the GD at [16]). \nShe was thus the notional  owner of the property  as at the date of the court order  \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nTIC v TID [2018] SGCA 75\n11and, in fact, also occupied the property  during the relevant period. She should \ntherefore prima  facie bear the property tax payments  during  the interim  period. \nAnd as we noted at [20] above, there were no special  circumstances that called \nfor the prima  facie position to be displaced. Accordingly, as with the mortgage  \npayments, we affirm  the Judge\u2019s finding that the Wife should bear the property \ntax payments during the interim period.\nSummary of  our findings\n24 On the question of which  party  should bear the ongoing liabilities in the \nperiod between the date of the court  order  and the date of completion in a \nsituation where one party to a divorce  has been  given the option of buying  over \nthe other party\u2019s share  of the matrimonial  property, our findings can be \nsummarised as follows.\n(a) It is necessary to distinguish between the different types of \npayments, for instance mortgage and property tax payments, because \nthey attract different considerations.\n(b) In relation to mortgage payments, the prima  facie position is that \nthe eventual owner of the property  should bear such payments because \nit is the eventual owner who will benefit solely  from any mortgage  \npayments made. Whether the value of the property actually rises or falls \nand which  party occupies  the property  in the interim are not relevant \nconsiderations.\n(c) In relation to property tax or other similar  payments which do \nnot affect the net equity  of the property, the prima facie position is that \nthe notional owner of the property as at the date of the court order should \nbear such payments  because these payments  are levied upon ownership.  \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nTIC v TID [2018] SGCA 75\n12The notional  owner as at the date of the court  order depends on the terms \nof the order.\n(d) The court can fashion an order to displace these  prima facie \npositions if  the circumstances so require.\n(e) On the present facts, given that the Wife had confirmed during \nthe two hearings  before  the Judge that she would be taking up the option \nto purchase the Husband\u2019s  share of the property, she is both the eventual \nowner and the notional  owner  of the property as at the date of the court  \norder and should prima  facie  bear the mortgage  and property tax \npayments. There  were  no circumstances  on the present facts that \nrequired this prima facie position to be displaced.\n25 From  the foregoing  discussion, it will be evident that in cases where one \nparty to a divorce  is given the option of buying over the other party\u2019s share of \nthe matrimonial property, it is important for the court to identify the different  \ntypes of payments involved and then to state whether  it is applying  the prima  \nfacie position  or whether there are special circumstances on the facts which \njustify the imposition  of a specific, tailored order. As a practical matter, this \nwould make clear to the parties who should bear the payments  and would also \nassist the appellate  court,  in the case of an"}

The development project was financed by United Overseas Bank Limited (\u201cUOB\u201d), which held a legal mortgage over, inter alia, the D8 Property. Subsequently, the development project ran into financial difficulties, and Lee Siew Noi Ivy (\u201cIvy Lee\u201d), the sole director and shareholder of the Company, borrowed money from various non-bank sources in an attempt to tide the Company over these difficulties.', '3\\u2003Before we come to MWA\u2019s loan to the Company in July 2014, it is helpful to set out in brief the other loans extended to the Company from 2011 to 2013.', '4\\u2003On 25 May 2011, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with Evan Lim under which Evan Lim was to contribute $5,528,433.45 towards the development of the D8 Property, and the Company was to repay Evan Lim that principal amount plus an additional 40% within three years. This worked out to interest of 13.33% per year. The parties subsequently clarified in a settlement agreement concluded on 18 June 2014 between the Company, Evan Lim and Ivy Lee (\u201cthe First Settlement Agreement\u201d) that the joint venture agreement of 25 May 2011 \u201cwas intended to be a loan agreement\u201d for the sum of $5,525,020. The First Settlement Agreement also confirmed that as at 25 May 2014, the Company owed Evan Lim the sum of $7,735,028 (ie, $5,525,020 plus the 40% uplift). As part of the First Settlement Agreement, Evan Lim granted the Company two additional months to repay the accrued debt of $7,735,028 in consideration for payment of an additional sum of $773,503, which was 10% of the accrued debt. In other words, Evan Lim wanted interest at the rate of 10% for two months (or 60% per annum) in return for granting the Company a two-month extension to repay the accrued debt. Default interest at the rate of 18% per annum was also payable under the First Settlement Agreement. Ivy Lee guaranteed the performance of the First Settlement Agreement.', '5\\u2003As at 30 January 2015, the Company had paid Evan Lim only $4.6m, leaving a balance of $3,908,531 unpaid. As at 19 June 2015, interest amounting to $728,305.72 (calculated at the stipulated default interest rate of 18% per annum) was payable on this balance.', '6\\u2003On 19 June 2015, the Company, Evan Lim, Ivy Lee and one Chua Choy Soon entered into a further settlement agreement (\u201cthe Second Settlement Agreement\u201d) under which the Company agreed to pay Evan Lim the sum of $4,115,031 (ie, the unpaid $3,908,531 plus default interest of $200,000 (which was lower than the actual default interest payable under the 18% per annum default interest rate stipulated in the First Settlement Agreement) and legal costs of $6,500) in two separate tranches. Default interest at the rate of 18% per annum was similarly payable under the Second Settlement Agreement. As no further payments were received under the Second Settlement Agreement, Evan Lim\u2019s proof of debt was for the sum of $4,115,031. Evan Lim did not claim any interest under the Second Settlement Agreement.', '7\\u2003On 19 August 2011, the Company entered into a written agreement with LR Properties Pte Ltd (\u201cLR Properties\u201d) under which it was agreed that LR Properties would invest $3.29m in the Company in exchange for a 20% stake in the D8 Property. Subsequently, it became clear that this \u201cinvestment agreement\u201d was similarly a loan agreement. No interest was charged for this loan, and the loan was neither secured nor guaranteed. LR Properties\u2019 proof of debt against the Company was for the aggregate sum of $4,387,328.40.', '8\\u2003On 13 August 2013, the Company, Ivy Lee and Shirley Ong Hwee Yin (\u201cShirley Ong\u201d) entered into an agreement whereby Shirley Ong would invest $1.75m in the Company in exchange for a guaranteed return of 40% of the principal amount within 15 months, that is to say, in exchange for payment of $2.45m within 15 months. This worked out to interest at the rate of 32% per annum. Ivy Lee guaranteed the Company\u2019s obligations under this agreement. Again, whilst this agreement was couched in the language of an investment agreement, given the unconditional obligation of full repayment, it was not disputed that it was similarly a loan agreement.', '9\\u2003As can be seen from [4]\u2013[8] above, the Company had been borrowing money from various non-bank sources since 2011. In 2014, it decided to borrow $10m from MWA, a licensed moneylender, to settle some of its other debts. The contractual and default interest rates (collectively \u201cthe Interest Rates\u201d) stipulated under the MWA Loan Agreement were 5% and 8% per month respectively, and the effective interest rates were 79.59% and 151.82% per annum respectively. Under the terms of the MWA Loan Agreement, the loan was to be repaid in full within six months from 4 July 2014, the date of drawdown of the $10m.', '10\\u2003In connection with the MWA Loan Agreement, the Company executed a deed of assignment dated 4 July 2014 over the Company\u2019s rights, titles and interest in several properties, all of which were collectively known in the deed as \u201cthe D8 Property\u201d. MWA registered the deed as a charge on 10 December 2014 (\u201cthe Charge\u201d). As a registered charge, the Charge ranked behind that of the first legal mortgagee, UOB. An added security for MWA\u2019s loan was a fixed charge granted by a related company, U-Asia Pte Ltd (\u201cU-Asia\u201d), under which U-Asia assigned all of its rights, titles and interest in several units at 12 Devonshire Road to MWA. Finally, Ivy Lee also executed a personal guarantee in favour of MWA. For completeness, U-Asia and Ivy Lee eventually settled their outstanding liabilities and obligations to MWA, and they paid the sum of $1m under the settlement.', '11\\u2003On 3 January 2015, the Company defaulted on the MWA Loan Agreement. On 26 March 2015, MWA commenced Suit No 285 of 2015 (\u201cSuit 285\u201d) against the Company. It obtained summary judgment for the undisputed principal sum of $6,741,310 on 3 August 2015, with the Company being granted unconditional leave to defend MWA\u2019s remaining claims for interest and default interest under the MWA Loan Agreement.', '12\\u2003On 14 September 2015, following the Company\u2019s default on the sum due under the summary judgment made against it in Suit 285, MWA commenced winding-up proceedings against the Company. On 9 November 2015, the Company was ordered to be wound up. The Liquidators then sold the D8 Property for $25,900,000, and the net proceeds of sale available for distribution to the Company\u2019s creditors, after the redemption of UOB\u2019s legal mortgage and deductions for (amongst other things) the Liquidators\u2019 fees and legal costs, came up to $13,447,721.92 (\u201cthe D8 Proceeds\u201d).', '13\\u2003The Liquidators adjudicated MWA\u2019s revised proof of debt as at 9 November 2015 and accepted MWA\u2019s claim in the total sum of $20,617,771.41. The validity of the Charge and, hence, MWA\u2019s status as a secured creditor of the Company was no longer an issue by the time the parties were before the High Court judge (\u201cthe Judge\u201d). The prospect facing the general creditors (including Evan Lim) was that the whole of the D8 Proceeds would go to MWA.', '14\\u2003On 30 September 2016, the Liquidators applied by way of Summons No 4766 of 2016 (\u201cSUM 4766\u201d) for, inter alia, an order that they be authorised to: (a) recognise the Charge; and (b) repay monies to MWA as a secured creditor out of the D8 Proceeds. In response to the Liquidators\u2019 application, on 18 May 2017, Evan Lim filed Summons No 2281 of 2017 (\u201cSUM 2281\u201d) to reverse or modify the Liquidators\u2019 decision to affirm the Interest Rates charged under the MWA Loan Agreement. SUM 2281 was filed pursuant to s 315 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) on the grounds that the Interest Rates were \u201cexcessive and unconscionable or substantially unfair\u201d under s 23 of the MLA. Whilst LR Properties supported SUM 2281, only Evan Lim appealed against the Judge\u2019s dismissal of the summons.'"}

The Appellant claimed trial to the remaining charge against him, which states:', '6\\u2003The Appellant was jointly tried with one Shanti Krishnan (\u201cShanti\u201d), a 51-year-old female Singapore citizen.

The debt that he owed grew over the coming months. 1', 'In May 2014, he was contacted by one \u201cBoy Ahmad\u201d, a male whom the Appellant described as his friend. After the Appellant informed \u201cBoy Ahmad\u201d of his financial difficulties, \u201cBoy Ahmad\u201d suggested that he \u201cdeal with heroin to make fast cash\u201d. 2', 'The Appellant agreed.', '8\\u2003\u201cBoy Ahmad\u201d told the Appellant the role he was to play in the trafficking of diamorphine. He would send a person to the Appellant\u2019s flat to deliver diamorphine. Having received the diamorphine, the Appellant was to await \u201cBoy Ahmad\u2019s\u201d instructions. \u201cBoy Ahmad\u201d would then direct the Appellant to repack the diamorphine into small Ziplock packets and hand those packets over to \u201ccustomers\u201d who would come to the second floor lift lobby of the block of flats where the Appellant lived. Each packet prepared by the Appellant was to contain 7.8g of drugs containing diamorphine. The Appellant was to receive two \u201cbatu\u201d each time, which, as he explained, referred to a total of about one kg of drugs (thus one \u201cbatu\u201d contained about 500g of drugs). 3', '\u201cBoy Ahmad\u201d also informed the Appellant that he would be paid $300 for his efforts each time. 4', '9\\u2003On 10 May 2014, the Appellant met \u201cBoy Ahmad\u201d and they further discussed the arrangements between them. \u201cBoy Ahmad\u201d told the Appellant to buy small Ziplock packets, and passed the Appellant a digital weighing scale which he was to use to ensure that each packet of drugs weighed 7.8g. He also told the Appellant that he would be getting someone to deliver two \u201cbatu\u201d to the Appellant on 12 May 2014, and the Appellant agreed. 5', 'In addition, \u201cBoy Ahmad\u201d handed the Appellant a plastic bag containing $8,200 in cash, which was to be paid to the person who would pass the Appellant the diamorphine.

The Appellant then called Shanti, who asked the Appellant where she should meet him. The Appellant gave Shanti his block number and told her to meet him on the second floor of the block. 7', 'When they met, the Appellant handed Shanti the plastic bag containing $8,200 and received from her a plastic bag containing a bundle wrapped in newspaper.

About 15 minutes later, \u201cBoy Ahmad\u201d called the Appellant and instructed him to divide one of the two packets of diamorphine into two. Each of the two divided portions was to be placed into a Ziplock packet (each of which, according to \u201cBoy Ahmad\u2019s\u201d directions, would contain about 226g of drugs). The Appellant complied, using the weighing scale to assist him. 8', 'Upon \u201cBoy Ahmad\u2019s\u201d further instructions, the Appellant distributed the two packets and the remaining \u201cbatu\u201d to various recipients, who met the Appellant at or near his block to receive the diamorphine. 9', '11\\u2003On 13 May 2014, \u201cBoy Ahmad\u201d met the Appellant to pass him an envelope containing $8,200 in cash, as well as another payment of $300. 10', '\u201cBoy Ahmad\u201d called the Appellant in the morning of 16 May 2014, informing him that there would be a delivery of diamorphine at about 6pm that day. 11', 'This delivery led to the charge which forms the subject matter of the present appeal.

Their motorcycle collided into a lorry driven by the second respondent in CA 33 and the second appellant in CA 35, Mr Lim Chuah Heng (\u201cMr Lim\u201d). As a result, Ms Yap fractured her right elbow, right radius and ulna, right kneecap and right tibia: Judgment at [1]\u2013[2].', '6\\u2003Following the accident, Ms Yap was bedridden for a few months. Her upper limb injuries healed without complications but she continued to have problems with her tibia which required bone grafting. In August 2013, she underwent reconstructive surgery to achieve equalisation of her shortened tibia with the use of a metal frame around her leg, followed by several related surgical procedures which lasted until July 2014. The procedures succeeded in achieving equalisation of her leg lengths and correction of her right tibia\u2019s external rotation, but her tibia was again fractured two weeks after the metal frame was removed. She had to use a wheelchair and crutches to get around, but her condition has since improved: Judgment at [2]\u2013[3].', '7\\u2003Ms Yap was given a total of 1,780 days (almost five years) of medical leave from the date of the accident to June 2016. She no longer requires a wheelchair for travelling short distances but occasionally uses a walking stick and experiences pain if she walks for a prolonged duration: Judgment at [3]\u2013[4]. She was 34 years old at the time of the accident and is 41 years old now. 2', '8\\u2003At the time of the accident in 2011, Ms Yap was one of two equity partners alongside Mr Wong in a firm named Resources XP (\u201cthe Partnership\u201d). Ms Yap had joined the firm in November 2008 when it was a sole proprietorship under Mr Wong\u2019s name, and she later became a partner in February 2009. Until 2010, the firm was in the business of providing digital imaging services for Community Development Councils and SPRING Singapore. In early 2011, just months prior to the accident, the Partnership began operating under a different business model and started providing accounting and IT services instead: Judgment at [73] and [81]. 3', '9\\u2003Mr Wong handled the operations and IT aspects of the businesses while Ms Yap was in charge of accounting, human resource management, sales and business development: Judgment at [73]. In order to meet clients, Ms Yap was required to travel frequently within Singapore and occasionally overseas. 4', '10\\u2003In June 2011, just a month prior to the accident, Ms Yap and Mr Wong incorporated a separate company known as Resources XP Pte Ltd (\u201cthe Company\u201d). Each of them is a director and 50% shareholder of the Company. The Company carries on the same business as the Partnership; the only difference between the two entities is that the Company is goods and services tax (\u201cGST\u201d) registered and can bill clients with GST where required. Where appropriate, we will refer to the collective business as \u201cthe Start-up\u201d. As the Company was still in the first month of its operations, Ms Yap and Mr Wong had agreed to draw a nominal salary each so as to foster the Company\u2019s growth and meet staff payroll requirements: Judgment at [125].

{"casename":"2018_SGCA_81","fact":"'7\\u2003We begin by setting out the facts relevant to this appeal.', '8\\u2003The first appellant, Swissbourgh Diamond Mines (Pty) Limited (\u201cSwissbourgh\u201d), is a company that was incorporated on 12 November 1986 under the laws of the Kingdom by the second appellant, Mr Josias Van Zyl (\u201cMr Van Zyl\u201d), a South African national. The third and fourth appellants are, respectively, the representatives of the Josias Van Zyl Family Trust (\u201cthe JVZF Trust\u201d) and the Burmilla Trust, which are trusts constituted under the laws of the Republic of South Africa. In March 1989, the ownership of Swissbourgh was structured such that the JVZF Trust owned 95% of its shares and Mr Van Zyl held the remaining 5%. In June 1997, the JVZF Trust transferred 90% of the shares in Swissbourgh to the Burmilla Trust. Mr Van Zyl now owns 5% of the Swissbourgh shares, the JVZF Trust owns 5%, and the Burmilla Trust owns the remaining 90%.', '9\\u2003Following its incorporation, sometime in or about 1987, Swissbourgh submitted applications for prospecting and mining leases (\u201cthe Mining Leases\u201d) in five regions in the Kingdom, namely, the Matsoku, Motete, Orange, Patiseng\/Khubelu and Rampai regions. In June 1988, the Kingdom formally approved Swissbourgh\u2019s applications for the Mining Leases.', '10\\u2003The fifth to ninth appellants \u2013 Matsoku Diamonds (Pty) Limited, Motete Diamonds (Pty) Limited, Orange Diamonds (Pty) Limited, Patiseng Diamonds (Pty) Limited and Rampai Diamonds (Pty) Limited (\u201cRampai Diamonds\u201d) (collectively, \u201cthe Tributees\u201d) \u2013 were incorporated in 1988 under the laws of the Kingdom, and served as operating companies responsible for the diamond mining operations in the areas of the Kingdom that they were respectively named after. Between 15 December 1989 and 10 January 1990, the Tributees entered into and registered licensing agreements with Swissbourgh for the sub-lease of the Mining Leases (\u201cthe Tributing Agreements\u201d). Under the Tributing Agreements, the Tributees undertook to hold and exercise the mining rights under each of the Mining Leases for each of the eponymous mining areas.', '11\\u2003In September 1994, ownership of the Tributees was transferred to the Burmilla Trust (which acquired 99% of the shares in the Tributees) and the JVZF Family Trust (which acquired the remaining 1%). At various times from 1994 to 1997, Swissbourgh and the Tributees assigned to the Burmilla Trust their rights relating to any claims against the Kingdom arising out of the latter\u2019s purported interference with the Mining Leases. The PCA Tribunal found that it lacked jurisdiction ratione personae over Swissbourgh and the Tributees in the arbitration proceedings on this basis (see [42] below), and the Judge did not disagree with this finding (Judgment at [320]); however, he additionally found (at [338]) that the PCA Tribunal lacked jurisdiction ratione personae over Swissbourgh and the Tributees on the grounds that they were domestic investors (see [52(f)] below). Although this point was not taken on appeal, for convenience, we will refer not only to Mr Van Zyl and the representatives of the JVZF Trust and the Burmilla Trust, but also to Swissbourgh and the Tributees as \u201cthe Appellants\u201d collectively.', '12\\u2003The disputes that led to the PCA Arbitration and the subsequent setting-aside proceedings arise out of a protracted saga stretching over two decades. The disagreement between the parties revolves around two distinct matters: first, the Kingdom\u2019s alleged expropriation of the Appellants\u2019 Mining Leases (\u201cthe Expropriation Dispute\u201d), and second, the shuttering of the SADC Tribunal without the provision of an alternative forum to determine the pending SADC Claim (\u201cthe Shuttering Dispute\u201d).', '13\\u2003In 1986, the Kingdom embarked on the Lesotho Highlands Water Project (\u201cthe LHWP\u201d), a large-scale commercial joint venture with South Africa. The LHWP required the Kingdom to divert water from the Orange-Senqu River in the Kingdom to South Africa. In exchange, the Kingdom would receive royalties for the water and would be able to generate a significant output of hydroelectricity from hydropower stations for its own energy needs. The Lesotho Highlands Development Authority (\u201cthe LHDA\u201d), which was created in 1986 to implement, operate and maintain the LHWP, commenced construction works in the Rampai area in 1989.', '14\\u2003In April 1991, the Kingdom\u2019s military council (\u201cthe Military Council\u201d), which was the governing body of the Kingdom at that time, underwent a change in leadership.', '15\\u2003On 18 July 1991, Swissbourgh and Rampai Diamonds obtained an interim injunction from the High Court of Lesotho requiring the LHDA to cease construction works in the Rampai area. On 29 July 1991, both parties agreed to set aside the injunction, although no settlement agreement was concluded.', '16\\u2003In August 1991, the Kingdom\u2019s Commissioner of Mines (\u201cthe Commissioner\u201d) wrote to Swissbourgh, alleging that it had breached its obligations under all five Mining Leases and threatening to cancel the Mining Leases if the breaches were not remedied within 60 days. Between 10 October and 4 November 1991, notwithstanding that the Mining Leases provided for the resolution of such disputes by arbitration, the Commissioner purported to cancel all five Mining Leases and ordered Swissbourgh and the Tributees to vacate the mining areas and cease operations within 90 days.', '17\\u2003On 28 October 1991, Swissbourgh commenced arbitration proceedings in connection with the purported cancellation of the Mining Leases. On 19 November 1991, Swissbourgh and the Tributees commenced judicial review proceedings against the Commissioner in the High Court of Lesotho, seeking to annul the purported cancellations of the Mining Leases and obtain interim relief pending the outcome of the arbitration (\u201cthe 1991 Annulment Proceedings\u201d). The court granted interim relief and ordered that the Tributees be permitted to continue mining. Both parties subsequently agreed to stay the arbitral proceedings pending the substantive outcome of the 1991 Annulment Proceedings. It was subsequently revealed that on 18 November 1991, the Kingdom had granted the LHDA a lease over parts of the territories that were already subject to the Mining Leases for the purposes of water storage and generation of electric power.', '18\\u2003On 20 March 1992, the Military Council passed an order purporting to revoke the Mining Leases as well as the Tributing Agreements, discharge all pending claims brought by Swissbourgh and the Tributees in the domestic courts and arbitral tribunals, order Swissbourgh and the Tributees to vacate the mining areas, and exclude any right to compensation as well as any right to judicial or arbitral redress. On 7 April 1992, Swissbourgh and the Tributees commenced proceedings in the High Court of Lesotho, seeking the annulment of the Military Council\u2019s revocation order and an injunction to restrain the LHDA from interfering with the rights of Swissbourgh and the Tributees under the Mining Leases (\u201cthe 1992 Annulment Proceedings\u201d). While this application was pending, Swissbourgh and the Tributees terminated all of the Mining Leases, save for the Rampai lease, on 11 March 1993 on the basis that the Kingdom had breached and repudiated them. On 27 September 1994, the High Court of Lesotho found in favour of Swissbourgh and the Tributees in the 1992 Annulment Proceedings, and annulled the Military Council\u2019s revocation order. The Court of Appeal of Lesotho affirmed this decision in January 1995.', '19\\u2003On 2 March 1995, the LHDA filed an application in the High Court of Lesotho seeking a declaration that the Rampai lease \u2013 the last of the Mining Leases that had not been terminated by Swissbourgh and the Tributees \u2013 was void ab initio due to the Kingdom\u2019s failure to consult the local chiefs responsible for the Rampai area before approving the Mining Leases (\u201cthe Rampai Lease Proceedings\u201d).', '20\\u2003Subsequently, on 27 March 1995, the Commissioner consented in the 1991 Annulment Proceedings to an order of the High Court of Lesotho setting aside his purported cancellations of the Mining Leases in 1991, conceding that he had acted prematurely. The upshot of this was that both the 1991 Annulment Proceedings and the 1992 Annulment Proceedings commenced by Swissbourgh and the Tributees had concluded in their favour, but given their termination of the other Mining Leases in March 1993, only the Rampai lease remained in place (subject to the outcome of the Rampai Lease Proceedings).', '21\\u2003On 16 and 17 August 1995, the Kingdom enacted legislation that enabled it to expropriate any area that fell within the LHWP, subject to compensating the holders of valid mining leases in the affected areas (\u201cthe LHDA Acts\u201d). Pursuant to the LHDA Acts, the Kingdom expropriated areas in Rampai subject to the Rampai lease in October 1995.', '22\\u2003In May 1996, Swissbourgh and the Tributees brought a claim against the Kingdom in the High Court of Lesotho for damages suffered as a result of the Commissioner\u2019s and the Military Council\u2019s purported revocations of the Mining Leases (except the Rampai lease, which was the subject of the Rampai Lease Proceedings) and other acts of the Kingdom which had allegedly hindered Swissbourgh from exercising its mining rights, thus resulting in losses of profit (\u201cthe 1996 Proceedings\u201d). In July 1996, the Appellants filed a claim for compensation under the LHDA Acts, but the LHDA declined to consider the claim until the Rampai Lease Proceedings had been decided. In September 1998, Swissbourgh and Rampai Diamonds brought a claim against the LHDA in the High Court of Lesotho, claiming damages for the LHDA\u2019s expropriation of the Rampai lease under the LHDA Acts (\u201cthe 1998 Proceedings\u201d).', '23\\u2003On 28 April 1999, the High Court of Lesotho granted the LHDA\u2019s application in the Rampai Lease Proceedings, finding that the Rampai lease was void ab initio. The Court of Appeal of Lesotho affirmed the decision in October 2000. The Appellants discontinued both the 1996 Proceedings and the 1998 Proceedings following this development.', '24\\u2003Between 2000 and 2007, the Appellants requested the Government of South Africa to exercise diplomatic protection regarding their investments in the Kingdom. The South African Government declined to do so. The Appellants challenged the Government\u2019s decision in the South African courts, but that challenge failed.', '25\\u2003On 12 June 2009, the Appellants commenced proceedings against the Kingdom before the SADC Tribunal pursuant to Art 15 of the Tribunal Protocol, seeking damages arising from the alleged expropriation of the Mining Leases (this being the SADC Claim). The Appellants claimed damages arising from the Kingdom\u2019s alleged violations of Arts 4(c) and 6 of the SADC Treaty.', '26\\u2003In August 2010, the Summit of the Heads of State or Government of the SADC (\u201cthe SADC Summit\u201d), which comprises the heads of State of all the SADC Member States and is the SADC\u2019s supreme policy-making body, unanimously resolved that: (a) the terms of offices of five SADC Tribunal judges, which were due to expire in October 2010, would not be renewed pending a review of the SADC Tribunal\u2019s role and responsibilities; and (b) the SADC Tribunal would not hear any new cases. These developments, which left the SADC Tribunal unable to operate or function, were prompted by the SADC Tribunal having assumed jurisdiction over certain investor-State claims against the Republic of Zimbabwe and then finding against Zimbabwe in a series of decisions made at various times from 2007 to 2009 including Mike Campbell (Pvt) Ltd and others v The Republic of Zimbabwe [2008] SADCT 2 (\u201cCampbell v Zimbabwe\u201d) and William Michael Campbell and another v The Republic of Zimbabwe [2009] SADCT 1. The SADC Summit\u2019s resolution made it impossible for the Appellants to prosecute the SADC Claim.', '27\\u2003Despite these developments, the Appellants applied to the SADC Tribunal on 25 January 2011 to request the continuation of its operations at least in respect of the pending SADC Claim. The SADC Tribunal rejected the application. In May 2011, the SADC Summit endorsed the decision of the SADC Council of Ministers (comprising the Ministers for foreign affairs, economic planning or finance from each SADC Member State) to continue the suspension of the SADC Tribunal until August 2011 and not re-appoint any of the judges on the SADC Tribunal. On 22 August 2011, the Appellants sought the Kingdom\u2019s agreement to submit the pending SADC Claim to arbitration by the PCA. The Kingdom rejected this request.', '28\\u2003In August 2012, the SADC Summit resolved to dissolve the existing SADC Tribunal and negotiate a new protocol that would limit the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to inter-State disputes. This resulted in the suspension of the determination of all the claims pending before the SADC Tribunal, including the SADC Claim. The Appellants were thus left without a forum for the SADC Claim.', '29\\u2003On 7 and 8 August 2014, the SADC Justice Committee (comprising the Ministers of Justice or Attorneys-General of the SADC Member States) resolved to recommend to the SADC Council of Ministers and the SADC Summit that the dissolution of the SADC Tribunal left a \u201clegal vacuum\u201d, and that the appropriate way forward was that:', '30\\u2003On 18 August 2014, the SADC Summit unanimously adopted a new Protocol on the SADC Tribunal that restricted the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to inter-State disputes and abolished jurisdiction over cases brought by non-State entities. But this version of the protocol has not yet entered into force. As a result, the Tribunal Protocol remains valid, save that it is inoperable.', '31\\u2003In November 2014, the SADC Justice Committee recommended to the SADC Council of Ministers and the SADC Summit that \u201ceach aggrieved party may decide on an alternative forum for the resolution of a SADC Tribunal pending case of which a Member State has been named a respondent\u201d.', '32\\u2003During a meeting of the SADC Council of Ministers held on 14 and 15 August 2015, the Kingdom proposed that the Council should recommend to the SADC Summit that:', 'The Kingdom further added during its presentation at the same meeting that:', '33\\u2003On 17 and 18 August 2015, the SADC Summit approved a proposal that \u201ceach Member State of the SADC may decide on an alternative forum for the resolution of a SADC Tribunal pending case of which that Member State has been named a respondent\u201d. However, the Kingdom has taken no steps to establish any such alternative forum.', '34\\u2003In the meantime, on 20 June 2012, the Appellants had commenced the PCA Arbitration by filing a Notice of Arbitration pursuant to Art 28 of Annex 1 to the Investment Protocol (\u201cAnnex 1\u201d) which entered into force on 16 April 2010. Article 28 reads as follows:', '35\\u2003It was common ground between the parties that by virtue of Art 28(4) of Annex 1, the Expropriation Dispute (as distinct from the subsequent shuttering of the SADC Tribunal and the failure to provide an alternative forum for the pending SADC Claim) could not possibly be submitted to arbitration under Art 28 as that dispute had arisen long before the Investment Protocol entered into force. In other words, it was accepted that the Expropriation Dispute did not fall within the PCA Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction ratione temporis. However, the question remained as to whether the Shuttering Dispute, which on the face of it occurred between August 2010 to August 2012 (see [26]\u2013[28] above) and hence arose after the Investment Protocol had entered into force, was caught by Art 28.', '36\\u2003The parties elected to refer the dispute to an ad hoc arbitral tribunal for arbitration pursuant to the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (\u201cUNCITRAL\u201d) (as revised in 2010) (\u201cthe UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules 2010\u201d), which is the option specified under Art 28(2)(c) of Annex 1. The PCA Tribunal comprised three arbitrators: Mr R Doak Bishop (who was nominated by the Appellants), Mr Justice Petrus Millar Nienaber (\u201cJustice Nienaber\u201d) (who was nominated by the Kingdom), and Prof Sir David A R Williams QC (who was the Presiding Arbitrator chosen by the designated appointing authority). The PCA Tribunal chose Singapore as the place of arbitration and the hearing venue. The arbitral proceedings were bifurcated, with the first phase dealing with all issues of jurisdiction and liability, and the second phase dealing with all issues of remedies. The PCA Tribunal heard the parties for the first phase of the proceedings in Singapore from 24 to 27 August 2015, and did not reconvene for a second phase.', '37\\u2003The Appellants\u2019 claim was that by participating in the shuttering of the SADC Tribunal without providing an alternative means for the SADC Claim to be determined, the Kingdom had breached its obligations under Arts 14 and\/or 15 of the Tribunal Protocol, Arts 6(1) and 27 of Annex 1, and Art 6(1) read with Art 4(c) of the SADC Treaty. They sought such relief and compensation as could have been granted by the SADC Tribunal for the expropriation of the Mining Leases, as well as all costs incurred in the proceedings. The Kingdom challenged the jurisdiction of the PCA Tribunal on grounds which we will elaborate on below.', '38\\u2003During the oral hearing before the PCA Tribunal, the Kingdom maintained on 24 August 2015 that it \u201cstands by [the] statement\u201d that it had made on 14 and 15 August 2015, and that \u201cit is only the right thing to do to accord to aggrieved parties an alternative forum for the ventilation of their grievances\u201d (see [32] above).', '39\\u2003After the close of proceedings before the PCA Tribunal, on 6 October 2015, the Kingdom made a free-standing offer to the Appellants that the SADC Claim be submitted to arbitration before an alternative forum within a SADC Member State. This offer was subject to acceptance by the Appellants within one month from the date of the Award, failing which the offer \u201cwill fall away and will be considered withdrawn\u201d. On 13 October 2015, the Appellants rejected the Kingdom\u2019s offer.', '40\\u2003Subsequently, in the Kingdom\u2019s post-hearing brief dated 16 October 2015, the Kingdom made the following submission in respect of the appropriate remedy to be ordered in the event that the jurisdiction of the PCA Tribunal were to be established and the Kingdom found liable in respect of the Appellants\u2019 claims:', '41\\u2003On 18 April 2016, the PCA Tribunal rendered the Award. It found in favour of the Appellants (with Justice Nienaber dissenting).', '42\\u2003In relation to the jurisdictional objections raised by the Kingdom, the PCA Tribunal held that it had jurisdiction to hear and determine the claims of only Mr Van Zyl and the representatives of the JVZF Trust and the Burmilla Trust. It first held that while Art 28 of Annex 1 was broad enough to cover domestic investors, Swissbourgh and the Tributees had assigned their claims to the Burmilla Trust, which was the proper party. The claims of Swissbourgh and the Tributees were therefore dismissed on this basis. But the PCA Tribunal dismissed all the other jurisdictional objections. To this end, it made the following findings:', '(a)\\u2003The investment in question comprised: (i) the Mining Leases, (ii) the shares in Swissbourgh and the Tributees held by Mr Van Zyl and the representatives of both the JVZF Trust and the Burmilla Trust (\u201cthe Shares\u201d), (iii) the resources expended in pursuing the exploitation of the Mining Leases (\u201cthe Expended Resources\u201d), and (iv) the right to claim compensation before the SADC Tribunal.', '(b)\\u2003The investment had been \u201cadmitted\u201d, given the Kingdom\u2019s confirmation, authorisation and acceptance of the Mining Leases.', '(c)\\u2003The true dispute before the PCA Tribunal was the Shuttering Dispute, which had arisen after the entry into force of Annex 1.', '(d)\\u2003The Shuttering Dispute concerned the obligations of the Kingdom in relation to the Appellants\u2019 right to refer disputes to the SADC Tribunal, which was part of the bundle of rights comprising the Mining Leases.', '(e)\\u2003There were no local remedies for the Appellants to exhaust in respect of the Shuttering Dispute.', '43\\u2003On the merits, which do not directly concern us, save and unless the relevant obligations need to be considered to determine whether jurisdiction was properly taken, the PCA Tribunal made the following findings:', '(a)\\u2003The Kingdom had breached Arts 14 and 15 of the Tribunal Protocol by unilaterally withdrawing its consent to the SADC Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over the SADC claim.', '(b)\\u2003The Kingdom had breached Art 6(1) of Annex 1 by failing to accord fair and equitable treatment (\u201cFET\u201d) to the Appellants and their investment.', '(c)\\u2003The Kingdom had breached Art 27 of Annex 1 by failing to protect the Appellants\u2019 right of access to the SADC Tribunal, which was a judicial tribunal competent under the laws of the Kingdom, to redress the Appellants\u2019 grievances in relation to matters concerning their investment.', '(d)\\u2003The Kingdom had breached Arts 4(c) and 6(1) of the SADC Treaty by failing to uphold the rule of law.', '44\\u2003As for the relief ordered, the PCA Tribunal found that the most appropriate remedy would be for a new tribunal to be established to hear and determine the SADC claim. The new tribunal was to be seated in the Republic of Mauritius (unless the parties agreed on another seat) and comprise three independent and impartial arbitrators who were nationals of SADC Member States (\u201cthe Mauritius Tribunal\u201d). The Mauritius Tribunal would have the same jurisdiction which the SADC Tribunal had in 2009 when the Appellants first filed the SADC Claim. The arbitration would be administered by the PCA (unless the parties agreed otherwise) under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules 2010, save that the tribunal should take into account the Tribunal Protocol and the applicable rules where practicable, including in relation to jurisdiction. The parties were required to confirm in writing to the PCA Tribunal, within 30 days of the issuance of the Award, that they agreed to submit, and thereby consented, to arbitration of the Expropriation Dispute before the new tribunal.', '45\\u2003In deciding to order the parties to constitute the Mauritius Tribunal, the PCA Tribunal expressly regarded as an indication of the Kingdom\u2019s \u201cconsent\u201d, the Kingdom\u2019s offer, in its Rejoinder dated 15 June 2015, to \u201csubmit to arbitration of the dispute as set out in the [Appellants\u2019] Application instituting proceedings before the SADC Tribunal (and subject always to all jurisdictional objections that were available to the [Kingdom] in respect of that claim)\u201d. However, it is important to note that this had in fact been expressly conditioned upon the PCA Tribunal deciding against the Kingdom on issues of jurisdiction and liability.', '46\\u2003In Justice Nienaber\u2019s dissenting opinion (\u201cthe Dissenting Opinion\u201d), he disagreed with the majority and found that the PCA Tribunal lacked jurisdiction on two grounds. First, the PCA Tribunal lacked jurisdiction ratione temporis because the dispute should have been properly characterised as the Expropriation Dispute, which pre-dated the entry into force of the Investment Protocol, rather than the Shuttering Dispute. Second, the Appellants had not exhausted all local remedies as required by Art 28(1) of Annex 1 prior to commencing the arbitration. In particular, the Appellants had not pursued the remedy of what was referred to as an Aquilian action to seek compensation for economic loss caused by the Kingdom\u2019s participation in the shuttering of the SADC Tribunal.', '47\\u2003On 13 May 2016, the Kingdom sought an interpretation of the Award pursuant to Art 37 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules 2010, seeking confirmation from the PCA Tribunal that the obligation to establish the new tribunal applied to only Mr Van Zyl and the representatives of the JVZF Trust and the Burmilla Trust.', '48\\u2003On 17 May 2016, the Kingdom filed the Setting Aside Application (see [51] below).', '49\\u2003On 27 June 2016, the PCA Tribunal issued an Interpretation of the Partial Final Award on Jurisdiction and Merits. The PCA Tribunal clarified that only Mr Van Zyl and the representatives of the JVZF Trust and the Burmilla Trust, as well as the Kingdom, were ordered to establish a new tribunal given that these were the parties over whom the tribunal had jurisdiction ratione personae. Nevertheless, the new tribunal, being vested with the same jurisdiction as that vested in the SADC Tribunal in 2009 prior to its shuttering, would have the jurisdiction to accept claims from all of the Appellants, such that Swissbourgh and the Tributees could also voluntarily apply to participate in the new arbitration should they consider it necessary or desirable to do so.', '50\\u2003On 20 October 2016, the PCA Tribunal issued a final award on costs, finding that the Kingdom was to pay the Appellants the costs of the arbitral proceedings. This costs award has been the subject of a separate set of enforcement proceedings in Singapore: see Josias Van Zyl and others v Kingdom of Lesotho [2017] 4 SLR 849.'"}

{"casename":"2018_SGCA_83","fact":"'3\\u2003The background to the dispute is set out comprehensively in the Judgment. It suffices for us to set out the facts that are material to these appeals.', '4\\u2003The Husband works as a managing director in an energy company. At the age of 34, he is a man of substantial means due to his father\u2019s inheritance. He shared a close relationship with his late mother. The Wife, who is 38 years old, has been unemployed since 2012, prior to which she was a practising lawyer for a number of years. The Husband and the Wife began their romantic relationship in November 2011, and the Wife became pregnant with the Son soon after in April 2012. Notwithstanding the strong disapproval of the Husband\u2019s mother, the Husband and the Wife married in August 2012. The Son was born shortly after, in December 2012.', '5\\u2003After the couple married, the Husband lived mostly with his mother in one of her properties, which we shall refer to as \u201cthe Holland Road Property\u201d. This was save for a short period from October to November 2012, during which time the Husband stayed with the Wife and her parents in their family home, which we shall refer to as \u201cthe Stevens Road Property\u201d. The period between December 2012 and January 2014 was a difficult one for the couple because of the Husband\u2019s work and travels, but by January 2014, they had begun to discuss setting up their own home. They found an apartment that would be their family home, which we shall call \u201cthe Scotts Road Apartment\u201d.', '6\\u2003Soon after, tragedy befell the Husband\u2019s mother in March 2014. She was killed at the Holland Road Property, and her funeral was held on 23 March 2014. Because the Holland Road Property had been cordoned off by the police, the Husband moved into the Stevens Road Property to live with the Wife and her family.', '7\\u2003Three days after the funeral of the Husband\u2019s mother, on 26 March 2014, the Husband and his sister met with their mother\u2019s lawyers to read her will. Their mother had created a testamentary trust over her assets, which were valued at about $54m. Her assets comprised, among other things, the Holland Road Property and another landed property (\u201cthe Bukit Timah Property\u201d). A lawyer (\u201cthe Solicitor\u201d) was appointed to assist in the administration of their mother\u2019s estate, while the Husband and his sister were appointed the executors of their mother\u2019s will and the trustees of her testamentary trust. The testamentary trust stipulated that they could sell the properties only after the 25th anniversary of their mother\u2019s death. Until then, they were each only permitted to withdraw a sum not exceeding $10,000 per month from the estate.', '8\\u2003Thereafter, the Husband and his sister went to the Stevens Road Property to have lunch with the Wife and her mother. The siblings agreed not to reveal the contents of the will to the Wife. But the Wife knew that they had gone to read their mother\u2019s will, and thus asked about it. Upon being questioned, the Husband lied that his mother had willed all her property to charity, and they discussed the idea of converting the Bukit Timah Property into an art gallery in remembrance of her.', '9\\u2003After lunch, the Husband and his sister left the Stevens Road Property. That afternoon, the Wife drafted the DOT at issue in these appeals by hand. When the Husband returned in the evening, the Wife asked him into her bedroom to sign the DOT. In sum, the DOT provided that the Husband and Wife would hold all of the Husband\u2019s assets on trust for the Son. It read as follows:', '10\\u2003The parties dispute the precise events that took place in the Wife\u2019s bedroom that evening. In essence, the Husband claims, on the one hand, that the Wife\u2019s request for him to sign the DOT took him by surprise, and that she represented to him that the trust would only take effect upon his death. He further avers that she threatened to kick him out of the Stevens Road Property if he did not sign the DOT. On the other hand, the Wife claims that she drew up the DOT at the Husband\u2019s request, and that he signed the DOT of his own accord. This is a crucial point of contention which we will return to later. At this juncture, it suffices to note that it is undisputed that the Husband initially refused to sign the DOT, which led to an argument between the couple. It is also undisputed that the Husband eventually signed the DOT that evening, following which the Wife stored the DOT in her safe.', '11\\u2003Not long after the DOT was executed, the Husband informed the Wife in April 2014 that a second will by his mother had been discovered, and that he and his sister had inherited their mother\u2019s assets under this second will. It is undisputed that this was a lie. Subsequently, the Husband and his sister decided to exercise their right as beneficiaries under their mother\u2019s will to call in the assets under the will and apportion them between themselves.', '12\\u2003On 9 May 2014, the Husband exercised the option to purchase the Scotts Road Apartment. In this connection, the Solicitor who assisted in the administration of the Husband\u2019s mother\u2019s estate also assisted the couple in their purchase of the Scotts Road Apartment. On the same day, the Husband executed a second trust deed (\u201cthe Scotts Road Trust\u201d), in which he declared that he held the Scotts Road Apartment on trust for the Son. The Scotts Road Trust stated that the apartment was purchased \u201cout of natural love and affection for the Son\u201d. It also provided that the Husband would be entitled to receive and use the rental income for his own benefit until the Son turned 21 years old.', '13\\u2003In the same month, the Husband and the Wife went on a holiday to France as part of their attempt to reset their relationship. Around this time, the couple also started planning for a second child.', '14\\u2003Approximately a month after the Scotts Road Trust was executed, the Wife sent an e-mail to the Solicitor on 14 June 2014 without copying the Husband. In this e-mail, the Wife enclosed a copy of the DOT and sought to bring it to the Solicitor\u2019s attention. She said:', '15\\u2003Just three days later, on 17 June 2014, the Wife sent another e-mail to the Solicitor. Again, the Husband was not copied. This e-mail similarly enclosed a copy of the DOT and asked the Solicitor to take note of it when acting for the Husband\u2019s mother\u2019s estate:', '16\\u2003On 9 July 2014, the Husband and his sister entered into a deed of family arrangement, under which they agreed to exercise their rights as beneficiaries to terminate their mother\u2019s testamentary trust and to apportion their mother\u2019s assets between them. On 27 November 2014, the High Court allowed their application to do so.', '17\\u2003About two weeks after the testamentary trust was terminated, the Wife re-sent her e-mail dated 14 June 2014 to the Solicitor. And on 17 December 2014, she sent yet another e-mail to him. In this latest e-mail, the Wife requested to be kept updated about the vesting of property and funds belonging to the Husband\u2019s mother\u2019s estate. She also asked if it would be necessary for them to have a meeting with the Husband, who was again not copied in the e-mail. The e-mail reads as follows:', '18\\u2003The parties\u2019 relationship quickly fell apart thereafter. The next day, on 18 December 2014, the Solicitor replied to the Wife, copying the Husband and recommending that matters arising from the DOT be handled by his colleague. After receiving the Solicitor\u2019s e-mail, the Husband went to seek legal advice on the DOT. On 11 February 2015, the Husband resolved to leave the Stevens Road Property and wrote a letter to the Wife, explaining that he needed time to sort out his thoughts about the future of their relationship but intended to honour his obligations as a husband and a father. In the letter, reflecting on the breakdown of their relationship, he claimed that she had pressured him into signing the DOT, which he would not have done if he had been properly advised. He also claimed that the intervention of the Wife\u2019s father (\u201cthe Father\u201d) added to the pressure on him to sign it. The salient parts of the letter read as follows:', '19\\u2003The next day, on 12 February 2015, the Husband went to the Stevens Road Property to deliver the letter to the Wife. This resulted in a heated confrontation involving the Husband, the Wife and her mother. Their argument was secretly recorded by the Husband (\u201cthe Recorded Conversation\u201d), a transcript of which was admitted into evidence without objection at the trial. In gist, the Recorded Conversation revealed that the Husband and the Wife disagreed as to whether the Husband had been pressured into signing the DOT, and whether the Wife had asked the Husband to consult a lawyer before signing the DOT.', '20\\u2003In April 2015, the Husband, through his solicitors, asked the Wife to deliver up the DOT for it to be destroyed. That request was refused. In November 2015, the Wife filed for divorce. Thereafter, on 30 November 2015, the Husband commenced the present proceedings to set aside the DOT on the grounds of misrepresentation, mistake, undue influence and unconscionability.'"}

The Lin Family operated a business that was primarily focused on the petroleum industry, and which gradually diversified into properties. LSE was the driving force behind the Lin Family business.', '6\\u2003In June 1977, LSE and his wife, Mdm Tan Lay Hoon (\u201cTLH\u201d), incorporated TL Petroleum. LCM was appointed a director of TL Petroleum shortly thereafter. In January 1979, LSE and LCM incorporated TL Development, and were its founding directors and shareholders. In May 1983, LSE and LCM incorporated TL Investment, and were also its founding directors and shareholders. TL Investment is an investment holding company with the chief purpose of holding shares in TL Development \u2013 indeed, presently, the only assets that TL Investment holds are shares in TL Development. Leadership of the TL Companies was vested in the Father and three of his eldest sons, while ownership of the TL Companies resided primarily in the Father and all five of his sons. LSE was, at all times, either the joint or outright majority shareholder in TL Development and TL Investment. Following the transfer of the Father\u2019s shares in TL Development and TL Petroleum to LSE in 1991 (after the Father was diagnosed with cancer), LSE became the clear majority shareholder in the TL Companies, while LCM was a minority shareholder.', '7\\u2003The TL Companies made several significant property investments over the years. In 1986, the Father and the Mother sold a portion of a piece of property that they owned at 5 Teo Kim Eng Road to TL Development, and TL Development proceeded to redevelop the property into two semi-detached houses (ie, 25 and 27 Jalan Rimau). Whereas the Father\u2019s third son had occupied 25 Jalan Rimau from 1990 to 2000 and the youngest son has been residing there since 2000, LCM and his family moved into 27 Jalan Rimau in 1991 and resided there until 30 March 2016, when they moved out as required under cl 11 of the Settlement Agreement (see [20] and [27] below).', '8\\u2003In 1990, TL Development purchased four shophouses. TL Development sold the first in 1994 and the remaining shophouses in 2000, and part of the sales proceeds was invested in two Chinese companies: Fujian Putian Minxin Building Coating Materials Co Ltd and Fujian Putian Yongda Construction Materials Co Ltd (also referred to by the parties as Yongda Building Material Co Ltd (\u201cYongda\u201d)) (collectively, \u201cthe Chinese Subsidiaries\u201d). TL Development is the sole shareholder in both of the Chinese Subsidiaries.', '9\\u2003Sometime after 1991, TL Petroleum purchased the FEP Unit, which initially functioned as the headquarters of the TL Companies, but has been rented out since 2007.', '10\\u2003In 2000, the Father\u2019s third eldest son resigned as a director of TL Development and sold his shares in the TL Companies to LSE. In 2002, the Father\u2019s fourth eldest son sold his shares in TL Development and TL Investment to both LCM and the Father\u2019s youngest son, and sold his shares in TL Petroleum to LSE. On 7 March 2013, at the annual general meetings of both TL Development and TL Investment, LCM\u2019s term as director in both companies was not renewed, and LSE\u2019s wife (ie, TLH) was appointed as director in LCM\u2019s place in both companies.', '11\\u2003On 13 November 2014, LCM commenced the Winding Up Applications, seeking to wind up the TL Companies under s 254(1)(i) of the Companies Act on the basis that it was just and equitable to do so. LCM submitted that: (a) whereas there had been a mutual understanding that all the sons in the Lin Family would participate in the running of the TL Companies, LCM had been deliberately excluded from the management of the TL Companies; (b) the relationship of mutual trust and confidence between LCM and LSE had broken down, such that they were no longer able to work in concert in the management and conduct of the business of the TL Companies; and (c) the substrata of the TL Companies had ceased to exist, and were operating at a loss despite their significant assets.', '12\\u2003On 13 April 2015, Steven Chong J (as he then was) issued the Winding Up Judgment, in which he found that: (a) the TL Companies were \u201cfamily companies\u201d, in the sense that a relationship of mutual trust and confidence was central to the existence of those companies such that they were quasi-partnerships, and it was clear that this relationship of mutual trust and confidence between LSE and LCM had disintegrated (see the Winding Up Judgment at [74]\u2013[79]); and (b) LCM had been deliberately excluded from the management of TL Development and TL Investment, in breach of an understanding that LCM was to have a management role in the TL Companies (at [80]\u2013[81]). Accordingly, Chong J found that there was unfairness that warranted a court-ordered winding up of the TL Companies under s 254(1)(i) of the Companies Act, and granted the Winding Up Applications (at [82]\u2013[89]). However, Chong J ordered, pursuant to s 257(1) of the Companies Act, the winding up order to be stayed for 30 days to allow the parties to reach an amicable settlement (at [98]). Finally, Chong J ordered LSE to pay LCM costs fixed at S$40,000 excluding disbursements, with such costs and disbursements to be reflected solely against the value of LSE\u2019s shares in the TL Companies (ie, the Costs Order) (at [99]).', '13\\u2003The parties failed to resolve their differences within 30 days. LSE thus filed the Winding Up Appeals on 23 May 2015. On 5 June 2015, LSE applied for a stay of the orders made in the Winding Up Applications. On 23 June 2015, a stay of Chong J\u2019s orders was granted.', '14\\u2003On 23 November 2015, at the hearing of the Winding Up Appeals, the Court of Appeal suggested that parties attend mediation to resolve their differences. On 28 December 2015, the parties attended mediation and, at the conclusion of the session, entered into the Settlement Agreement.', '15\\u2003The arrangement that the parties consented to under the Settlement Agreement was for: (a) LCM\u2019s shareholding in the TL Companies to be disposed of either by LSE purchasing LCM\u2019s shareholding in those companies or by capital reduction of those companies, with the net effect being that LCM would receive the Consideration in lieu of his shares in the TL Companies; and (b) each party to bear his own costs of the Winding Up Appeals (see cll 1 and 2 of the Settlement Agreement).', '16\\u2003The Consideration was to be computed in accordance with cll 3 to 8 of the Settlement Agreement, which provide as follows:', '17\\u2003In other words, cl 3 of the Settlement Agreement provides that the Consideration comprises two main figures: first, 23.44% of the net tangible asset value (\u201cNTAV\u201d) of TL Development; and second, 14.81% of the NTAV of TL Petroleum. In relation to the NTAV of TL Development, it shall be computed in accordance with cl 4, and two of the individual components stated in cl 4 (ie, the value of 25 and 27 Jalan Rimau, and the value of the Chinese Subsidiaries) shall be computed in accordance with cll 6\u20138.

{"casename":"2018_SGCA_85","fact":"'3\\u2003We first set out the background facts which led to the dispute and the consequent applications. In 2003, the Appellant\u2019s group of companies underwent a \u201cCorporate Restructuring and Financing Arrangement\u201d under which a $225m loan was obtained from a bank. This entire sum was returned to the bank on the same day through a series of transactions. From 2004 to 2006, the Appellant filed tax returns, showing that it had incurred interest expenses for the $225m loan, and accordingly claimed certain tax refunds. Based on these claims, the Comptroller awarded the Appellant tax refunds amounting in total to approximately $9.6m (\u201cthe Tax Refunds\u201d).', '4\\u2003Around July 2007, the Comptroller reviewed cases in which significant amounts of tax refunds were paid out. As part of this review, an audit was conducted on the Appellant to determine the basis on which the Tax Refunds were made to the Appellant and whether these claims were made under a tax avoidance arrangement. Following the completion of the audit in April 2008, the Comptroller came to the conclusion that the Appellant had indeed used a tax avoidance arrangement, and wrongly claimed the Tax Refunds. The Comptroller then invoked s 33 of the Income Tax Act (Cap 134, 2008 Rev Ed) and purported to issue notices of additional assessment. This was challenged by the Appellant before the Income Tax Board of Review. Eventually, following an appeal, this court agreed with the lower court\u2019s decision that although the Appellant had claimed the Tax Refunds under a tax avoidance arrangement, the Comptroller was not entitled to recover the Tax Refunds by way of additional assessment (see Comptroller of Income Tax v AQQ and another appeal [2014] 2 SLR 847 (\u201cAQQ\u201d)). However, this court expressly left open the possibility of a common law action by the Comptroller in unjust enrichment to recover the Tax Refunds as moneys paid under a mistake (see AQQ at [162]). On 1 April 2014, the Comptroller accordingly commenced Suit No 350 of 2014 (\u201cSuit 350\u201d) against the Appellant for the recovery of the Tax Refunds.', '5\\u2003In Suit 350, the Appellant took out the Discovery Application on 31 March 2015 by way of Summons No 1465 of 2015, seeking specific discovery of certain categories of internal documents (\u201cthe Internal Documents\u201d) belonging to the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (\u201cIRAS\u201d). The Comptroller resisted the Discovery Application on grounds of irrelevance, lack of necessity, litigation privilege and legal advice privilege.', '6\\u2003On 31 January 2017, the Judge granted the Discovery Application, finding the Internal Documents to be both relevant and necessary, and not protected by any legal professional privilege: see Comptroller of Income Tax v ARW and another [2017] SGHC 16 (\u201cthe Discovery Judgment\u201d) at [19]. Pertinently, the Judge made an obiter observation in the Discovery Judgment that public interest privilege under s 126 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe EA\u201d) could not be invoked by the Comptroller as follows (at [52]):', '7\\u2003The Judge also stated that detailed directions as to the orders sought in the Discovery Application would be given separately (at [53]).', '8\\u2003Following the release of the Discovery Judgment, the Comptroller filed for leave to appeal against that judgment on 9 February 2017 by way of Summons No 661 of 2017 (\u201cthe Leave to Appeal Application\u201d). On 27 February 2017, the Comptroller filed a Notice of Change of Solicitor, from WongPartnership LLP (\u201cWongP\u201d) to Allen & Gledhill LLP (\u201cA&G\u201d). It was subsequently clarified that A&G would take over conduct of only the Discovery Application and all related applications and appeals, and that the substantive matter would remain in the conduct of WongP.', '9\\u2003On 1 March 2017, the Comptroller filed the EOT Application and the Further Evidence Application by way of Summons No 940 of 2017, in which he sought leave to file his request for further arguments in the Discovery Application out of time under s 28B(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2014 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe SCJA\u201d), and to adduce two affidavits in support of the Discovery Application and the Leave to Appeal Application (\u201cthe Two Affidavits\u201d). The further arguments sought to be made related to: (a) public interest privilege under s 126(2) of the EA (\u201cs 126(2) EA\u201d); (b) official secrecy under s 6(3) of the Income Tax Act (Cap 134, 2014 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe ITA\u201d and \u201cs 6(3) ITA\u201d); and (c) legal professional privilege. The Two Affidavits were from: (a) Mr Tan Tee How, who was, at the time, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, the Chief Executive Officer of IRAS and the Comptroller, deposing to the injury and prejudice that would be caused to the public interest if disclosure of the Internal Documents were to be ordered, and (b) Ms Christina Ng Sor Hua (\u201cMs Ng\u201d), an IRAS officer, providing the background facts relating to the internal audits previously conducted by IRAS in relation to the Appellant\u2019s tax avoidance arrangements.', '10\\u2003On 3 March 2017, the AG filed the Intervention Application by way of Summons No 987 of 2017 for leave to intervene in the Discovery Application, the Leave to Appeal Application, the EOT Application, the Further Evidence Application, and in any application or appeal with regard to the same (collectively referred to as the \u201cRelevant Applications\u201d). The main thrust of his application was that the AG, as the guardian of the public interest, is obliged and entitled to protect the public interest by intervening in the Relevant Applications to argue his position on the issue of public interest privilege.'"}

The applicant  will have to respond \nto these  assertions and the Court will make its determination of the facts  and \nexpress its view on whether the transaction is or is not in good faith on the \nfacts.\n3 The main contention  before us is that the collective sale committee\u2019s \nvaluation report  dated 23 February 2016 prepared by Mr Tan Keng Chiam of \nJones Lang LaSalle  Property Consultants Pte Ltd (\u201cthe TKC valuation report\u201d) \nwas obviously erroneous  or even fundamentally flawed on its face.   The first \nlevel units were to be valued  as individual units. The TKC valuation  report \nvalued unit #01-18  as a showroom instead of as a canteen or eatery  without \nexplanation.\n4 The trial Judge  heard oral testimony and cross-examination of the \nrelevant witnesses on the TKC  valuation report and the other valuation reports  \nput up by the two objectors before him and considered this issue at length  in \nhis GD. The appellant  is the only objector  before  us.

We have not heard \ncompelling arguments to persuade us to depart  from his findings.

It was to \nbe 90% valuation and 10% share value.  That method was adopted  in \ncomputing the entitlement  of the units to the collective sale proceeds. Like the \ntrial Judge,  we see nothing to satisfy us that the collective sale transaction was \nnot in good faith and therefore there was no reason for the Court  not to \napprove it.\n6 We will however make a few observations on the TKC valuation \nreport. We note that the trial Judge said at [78] of his GD that the TKC \nvaluation report did not explain the reasons for the individual valuation of \neach first level showroom  unit as the valuer  was not asked  by the collective  \nsale committee to provide  explanations for his valuation of the units but was \nasked only to value all the units  in Citimac. The TKC valuation report  at \nparagraph 1 states that the instruction  for the valuation report was \u201cto \ndetermine the market  value for their existing use of the selected units\u201d in \nCitimac. The words \u201cexisting use\u201d appear  again  at paragraph  12 where the unit \nrates in Singapore  dollars per square foot for all the units were listed.  In \nparagraphs 8 and 12 of the TKC valuation report, the appellant\u2019s unit #01-18 \nwas stated  to be a \u201cshowroom\u201d under  \u201cType\u201d. It was acknowledged by the \nvaluer that he was also instructed to value the units on the first level as \nindividual units.\n7 Given  this background, it would be apparent that questions will arise \nbecause the \u201cexisting use\u201d of unit #01-18 was a canteen or an eatery,  the \nowner having  obtained approval of change of use some  years ago and it was \nno longer  a showroom. To the credit  of the collective sale committee, it did \nask the marketing  agent to check whether the valuer had taken into account  \n#01-18\u2019s change of use in his valuation.  The valuer\u2019s assurance  to the \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLow Kwang  Tong v Karen Teo Mei Ling and ors     [2018] SGCA 86 \n5marketing agent  that he had done so was then conveyed to the collective sale \ncommittee. If the TKC valuation report had included a sentence or two that \nunit #01-18  was approved  for use as a canteen but the valuer decided to value \nit as a showroom because that was the best use in the circumstances and \ntherefore the highest value, that would have  obviated the clarification and \nperhaps dispel the appellant\u2019s suspicion that the subsequent explanations  were \nall afterthoughts  to try to cover up a mistake.\n8 In the result,  we are satisfied that the trial Judge was entitled to arrive  \nat the conclusions that he did and that he was correct in approving the \napplication and in granting the collective sale order.

At about 7.22pm, Fadzli was escorted to the Woodlands Checkpoint where K-9 and backscatter searches were conducted on his car. Nothing incriminating was found. At about 10.35pm, Fadzli was escorted to the Central Police Division lock-up, and placed in the custody of the officers in charge of the lock-up.', '7\\u2003Meanwhile, shortly after Fadzli\u2019s arrest, at about 4.10pm, CNB officers arrested Affandi at his workplace at the MBS Fire Command Centre. Nothing incriminating was found either at his work station or in his two lockers at work. At about 5.18pm, Affandi was escorted to his car that was parked at the MBS carpark. A search was conducted on the said car and the items recovered and seized as case exhibits include:', '(a)\\u2003from under the last row of passenger seats, eight bundles wrapped in black tape (marked as \u201cB1\u201d to \u201cB8\u201d); and', '(b)\\u2003from the middle row of passenger seats: one plastic packet (marked as \u201cA1A\u201d) containing three packets of white crystalline substance (marked collectively as \u201cA1A1\u201d) and one packet of white crystalline substance (marked as \u201cA1B\u201d).', '8\\u2003At about 6.03pm, Senior Station Inspector David Ng (\u201cSSI David Ng\u201d) recorded a contemporaneous statement (P105) from Affandi in a CNB operational vehicle (\u201cthe CNB vehicle\u201d). After the statement was recorded, Affandi was escorted to the Woodlands Checkpoint where K-9 and backscatter searches were conducted on his car. Nothing incriminating was found. Thereafter, Affandi was escorted to his flat, but again, nothing incriminating was found. Affandi was then held in the custody of the CNB.', '9\\u2003All seized substances were sent for analysis by the Health Sciences Authority (\u201cHSA\u201d), which found and certified that:', '(a)\\u2003the eight exhibits (marked as \u201cB1A\u201d, \u201cB2A1\u201d, \u201cB3A\u201d to \u201cB8A\u201d) from the eight packets wrapped in black tape and said to have been recovered from the last row of seats in Affandi\u2019s car (see [7(a)] above) contained 132.82g of diamorphine;', '(b)\\u2003the plastic packets recovered from the middle row of Affandi\u2019s car (see [7(b)] above) contained not less than 8.14g of methamphetamine.', '(c)\\u2003the four plastic packets of crystalline substance taken from Fadzli\u2019s car (see [5] above) contained 38.84g of methamphetamine.', '(d)\\u2003the two packets of tablets taken from Fadzli\u2019s flat (see [6] above) contained 560 tablets of nimetazepam.', '10\\u2003Fadzli was charged with:', '(a)\\u2003abetting by instigating Affandi to be in possession, for the purpose of trafficking, of 132.82g of diamorphine, which is an offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) and s 12 of the MDA (\u201cCharge A\u201d);', '(b)\\u2003trafficking by having in his possession, for the purpose of trafficking, 38.84g of methamphetamine, which is an offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the MDA (\u201cCharge B\u201d);', '(c)\\u2003having in his possession 560 tablets containing nimetazepam, which is an offence under s 8(a) of the MDA (\u201cCharge C\u201d); and', '(d)\\u2003abetting by instigating Affandi to be in possession, for the purpose of trafficking, of 8.14g of methamphetamine, which is an offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) and s 12 of the MDA (\u201cCharge D\u201d).', '11\\u2003Affandi was charged with:', '(a)\\u2003having in his possession, for the purpose of trafficking, 132.82g of diamorphine, which is an offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the MDA (\u201cCharge E\u201d);', '(b)\\u2003having in his possession, for the purpose of trafficking, 8.14g of methamphetamine, which is an offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the MDA (\u201cCharge F\u201d); and', '(c)\\u2003trafficking in 38.84g of methamphetamine, by delivering the same to Fadzli which is an offence under s 5(1)(a) of the MDA (\u201cCharge G\u201d).', '12\\u2003The Judge convicted Fadzli of Charges A, B and C and Affandi of Charge E. As for Charge F, the Judge convicted Affandi on the reduced charge of possession of 8.14g of methamphetamine, which is an offence under s 8 of the MDA (\u201cReduced Charge F\u201d). The Judge acquitted Fadzli of Charge G and Affandi of Charge D. Thereafter, the Prosecution sought and obtained a discharge not amounting to an acquittal in respect of the non-capital charges (Charges B and C, and Reduced Charge F). These orders were made pursuant to s 232(1)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe CPC\u201d).', '13\\u2003The two remaining charges, Charges A and E (against Fadzli and Affandi respectively), read as follows:', '14\\u2003We have emphasised in bold the seized substances that the two charges relate to at [7(a)] and [9(a)] above. We will refer to them as \u201cthe seized diamorphine\u201d, or where we refer to the diamorphine in the form of the packets or bundles, as \u201cthe eight bundles\u201d, or where we refer to them as exhibits, as B1A, B2A1, and B3A to B8A and collectively as \u201cthe exhibits\u201d.', '15\\u2003In the course of the investigations, one contemporaneous statement (in two parts) (P106A and P106B), four cautioned statements (P111\u2013P114, of which P111 pertains to Charge A), and four investigation statements (P119\u2013P122) were recorded from Fadzli. One contemporaneous statement (P105), four cautioned statements (P115\u2013P118, of which only P115 pertains to Charge E) and eight investigation statements (P123\u2013P130) were recorded from Affandi. The statements were admitted in evidence without objection.', '16\\u2003The Prosecution relies substantially on two statements given by Affandi and we will turn to these before addressing the other statements. The first is the contemporaneous statement in P105, and the second is the cautioned statement recorded in respect of Charge E, P115. We set both out in full.', '17\\u2003P105 was recorded as a series of questions and answers in English. In this statement, Affandi admitted collecting and safekeeping the seized diamorphine on the instructions of one \u201cAbut\u201d, who he identified to be Fadzli:', '18\\u2003To understand the context in which P105 was recorded, it is relevant to refer to an earlier conversation that had taken place between Affandi and Staff Sergeant Sanusir bin Othman (\u201cSSgt Sanusir\u201d) (who was in the party of officers who arrested Affandi at his workplace) about half an hour before P105 was taken. While Affandi\u2019s work lockers were being searched, Affandi told SSgt Sanusir \u201cdalam kereta ade something\u201d, which SSgt Sanusir understood to mean that there was something in the car. Then he went on to say in English \u201cIf I tell from A to Z, what will happen to me as I wanted to know the real picture\u201d. It appears that Affandi was offering to come clean and reveal all that had happened but before doing so, he wanted to have some sense of what would then transpire. SSgt Sanusir responded that if Affandi came clean, he would seek further instructions from his superiors. Subsequently, before the car was searched, SSgt Sanusir had the following exchange with him:', '19\\u2003In his cautioned statement, Affandi elaborated on what he had said in P105:', '20\\u2003Up to this point, Affandi was consistent in his evidence that the seized diamorphine belonged to \u201cAbut\u201d (by which he meant Fadzli), and that he was only in possession of the black bundles until Fadzli was ready to collect them.', '21\\u2003In the investigative statements recorded after P115, Affandi described a different version of events:', '(a)\\u2003On the night of 11 July 2013, he was contacted by one \u201cMamak\u201d, someone he had met in Johor Bahru two months earlier.', '(b)\\u2003Mamak told Affandi that his car had broken down and asked if Affandi could assist him by receiving a package. He obliged, and as directed by Mamak, went to the Mandai heavy vehicle carpark between 3.50am and 4am on 12 July 2013. There, he received a grey plastic bag containing the black bundles from an unidentified Indian male.', '(c)\\u2003While Affandi had initially claimed to have gone to the heavy vehicle carpark from home, he changed his evidence subsequently and claimed that he had first gone to Malaysia to buy petrol and to wash his car between 12am and approximately \u201c2plus to 3am\u201d on the morning of 12 July 2013, and had then proceeded directly to the heavy vehicle carpark at Mandai. The investigating officer, Inspector Ng Pei Xin (\u201cthe IO\u201d), testified that this change of position occurred after Affandi was confronted with records from the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (\u201cICA\u201d) which indicated that he was in Malaysia at that time and had only re-entered Singapore through Woodlands at 3.30am. Affandi also stated that after returning to Singapore, he \u201cdrove down Woodlands Road and made a U-turn at Ten Mile Junction\u201d before turning into the heavy vehicle carpark next to Ten Mile Junction. That area was monitored by Closed Circuit Television (\u201cCCTV\u201d). When the CCTV footage was subsequently retrieved by the investigators, Affandi\u2019s car was not captured there whether at the time the alleged U-turn had taken place or otherwise. Affandi offered no explanation for this.', '(d)\\u2003After collecting the bundles, he became afraid and decided to drive to MBS instead of going home. When he arrived, he hid all the bundles under the third row passenger seat of his car. He claimed that he had intended to hand over the eight bundles to the police if Mamak failed to contact him before he ended work on 12 July 2013. Affandi claimed that he was frightened because he did not know what was inside the bundles. He also claimed that this was the first time that he had seen such bundles.', '(e)\\u2003Affandi explained that he had implicated Fadzli instead of Mamak because he was scared and confused, \u201c[t]he CNB officer was pressurizing\u201d him, and he felt very \u201cgan jiong\u201d by which he meant that he had been nervous or harried.', '(f)\\u2003Afffandi also explained that although he had mentioned \u201cpanas\u201d to the officers in his previous statements or conversations, he was in fact \u201cguessing and [he] really did not know what was in the eight bundles\u201d. He suspected \u201cpanas\u201d to be illegal but he had no idea what type of illegal substance it was.', '(g)\\u2003On 11 July 2013, he had bought groceries. He had earlier spoken to Fadzli about some donations of food items that he, Affandi, wished to make for the season of Ramadan. On 12 July 2013, he met Fadzli to hand him the groceries that he had purchased.', '22\\u2003In his cautioned statement, Fadzli denied knowledge of the drugs or of what Affandi did. Instead, he claimed that he had met Affandi on 12 July 2013 in order to receive Affandi\u2019s groceries at Marina Bay Sands. These groceries were meant to be donated to the Darul Ma\u2019wa orphanage at Still Road.', '23\\u2003There are two other aspects of Fadzli\u2019s statements that ought to be highlighted. First, in the contemporaneous statement taken shortly after Fadzli\u2019s arrest (P106A), he was shown a \u201cdigital photo\u201d of Affandi and was asked whether he knew who the person in the picture was. Fadzli claimed not to know the person. The material portion of P106A reads as follows:', '24\\u2003However, five days later, when a subsequent statement (P120) was being recorded, Fadzli was shown two other photographs of Affandi, and Fadzli identified the person in these photographs to be Affandi. Fadzli also elaborated on the circumstances surrounding the recording of P106A:', '25\\u2003The IO followed up on this point in the next statement (P121), which was taken on the following day:', '26\\u2003The second point of note is that Fadzli, in his statement taken on 16 July 2013 (P119), inserted, by way of a handwritten amendment to the original printed version of the statement, the following line:', '27\\u2003 We will return to these two points below at [79] and it would suffice to note, at this juncture, that the Prosecution relied on these two points as lies corroborative of Fadzli\u2019s guilt.', '28\\u2003The Judge found Affandi guilty of Charge E, ie, possessing diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking. A central feature of Affandi\u2019s defence was that serious questions had been raised as to the chain of custody of the drugs such that there was a real possibility that the expert reports were not given in respect of the very same drugs that had been seized from Affandi\u2019s possession. The Judge rejected this. He found that there was no break in the chain of custody. The Judge found it insufficient for the defence to suggest that there was a real possibility of a break in the chain of custody without giving any indication as to when and how the chain of custody might have been broken (Judgment at [32]). Instead, the Judge held that the defence needed to show \u201cthat the exhibits [had] left the custody of the officers, or that unauthorised parties had access to them at some time during that period, or that the exhibits [had] been interfered with\u201d (Judgment at [34]). He also found that there was no basis for any complaint as to how the IO had handled the exhibits (Judgment at [36]).', '29\\u2003Second, the Judge also found that Affandi failed to rebut the presumption of knowledge that arose under s 18(2) of the MDA. The Judge found that Affandi\u2019s contemporaneous statement (P105) and cautioned statement (P115) were \u201cvoluntary and true statements\u201d. In the light of the conversation that Affandi had with SSgt Sanusir (detailed at [18] above), the Judge found that Affandi was in a \u201cco-operative frame of mind\u201d at the time these statements were recorded (Judgment at [70]).', '30\\u2003The Judge disbelieved Affandi\u2019s reasons for renouncing the admissions in his contemporaneous and cautioned statements. The Judge observed that several aspects of the cautioned statement (P115) went beyond what was said in the contemporaneous statement (P105), such as how Affandi stored drugs for Fadzli for about a month (Judgment at [57]). When queried on this, Affandi explained that he was \u201cjust coming out with stories\u201d to \u201csave [himself]\u201d (Judgment at [58]). But the Judge noted that if Affandi wished to save himself, Affandi could have told the IO that his contemporaneous statement was untrue, and put across to her what he later claimed was the truth (Judgment at [59]).', '31\\u2003The Judge also pointed out several unsatisfactory aspects of Affandi\u2019s defence which undermined his credibility and his attempt to rebut the presumption:', '(a)\\u2003While Affandi had initially claimed not to have Mamak\u2019s number, he later admitted that he did have Mamak\u2019s number stored in his mobile phone (Judgment at [60]);', '(b)\\u2003Affandi also changed his account about his trip to the Mandai heavy vehicle carpark. Originally, he had claimed to have come from home. Then he claimed to have gone to the vehicle park from Johor Bahru instead. ICA records showed his car entering Singapore on 12 July 2013 at 3.30am. But even this version of events was, at least in part, inconsistent with the CCTV footage (Judgment at [61]\u2013[63] and see further [21(c)] above). The Judge concluded that Affandi had gone to Johor Bahru in the early hours of 12 July 2013 and had returned to Singapore at 3.30am; however, he found that Affandi did not drive to the heavy vehicle carpark but had gone to the MBS carpark directly, had then hid the eight bundles, and gone home (Judgment at [71]).', '(c)\\u2003Affandi also gave different accounts of what he did with the bundles after he received them. In his statement on 15 July 2013, Affandi claimed to have looked into the plastic bag he had received from Mamak on the way home and then taken one bundle and looked at it. However, during the trial, he testified that he only checked the plastic bag and realised that there were eight bundles inside after he reached MBS. When cross-examined on this, Affandi\u2019s answers \u201cequivocated wildly\u201d (Judgment at [65]\u2013[67]).', '32\\u2003The Judge held that for Affandi to rebut the presumption of knowledge, he had to prove that he did not know that the bundles contained diamorphine. However, Affandi could only say that he thought the bundles contained \u201cpanas\u201d which he suspected to be illegal but he did not enquire further or examine them. Given the confusion, equivocation and falsehoods in his evidence, the Judge concluded that the presumption had not been rebutted (Judgment at [73], [75]\u2013 [76]), and convicted Affandi of Charge E.', '33\\u2003The Judge found Fadzli to be guilty of Charge A, ie, abetting by instigating Affandi to possess diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking. The Judge found that P105 and P115 were admissions that could be used against Fadzli pursuant to s 258(5) of the CPC. He accorded them substantial weight and he thought that in these statements, Affandi was telling the truth as to how he came into possession of the eight bundles and who they belonged to (Judgment at [99]). He saw no reason for Affandi to falsely incriminate his friend Fadzli when he could have said that he had collected and held the bundles for Mamak if that were true (Judgment at [96]).', '34\\u2003Aside from the statements, the Judge considered three other facts (Judgment at [98]):', '(a)\\u2003First, Fadzli and Affandi had made two calls each to the other in the morning of 12 July 2013 when the eight bundles were delivered to Affandi.', '(b)\\u2003Second, Fadzli failed to identify Affandi from his photograph when P106A, his contemporaneous statement, was recorded (see [23] above).', '(c)\\u2003Third, Fadzli lied when he said he was not known as \u201cAbut\u201d in P119, a statement he gave on 16 July 2013 (see [26] above).', 'Based on the facts at (b) and (c) above, the Judge found that Fadzli was seeking to distance himself from Affandi. He had no reason to do that if he had nothing to hide. The Judge thought in the circumstances that this indicated that he was involved in the activities with Affandi for which they were arrested. The Judge took the view that these lies acted against Fadzli. While they were not evidence of guilt, they damaged his credibility and his defence (Judgment at [108]), and he therefore found Fadzli guilty of Charge A.'"}
{"casename":"2018_SGCA_9","fact":"'3\\u2003The Appellant is a Malaysian national. At the material time, he was 28 years old, unemployed and residing in Johor Bahru, Malaysia.', '4\\u2003On 24 March 2014, the Appellant rode a motorcycle bearing the Malaysian registration number WWR 1358 (\u201cthe Motorcycle\u201d) into Singapore through the Woodlands Checkpoint at about 7.35pm. He was arrested at the Motorcycle Arrival Lane when officers from the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (\u201cICA\u201d) discovered three black bundles believed to contain controlled drugs hidden in the Motorcycle in the course of a routine search at about 7.46pm. These bundles were found concealed in a space enclosed by the fenders. When confronted with this discovery, according to the officers at the scene, the Appellant looked confused and lost, denied ownership of the bundles, and said in Malay to ICA officer Corporal Abdul Hakim bin Abdul Razak (\u201cCpl Abdul Hakim\u201d), \u201cWhat\u2019s that? That\u2019s not my bike.\u201d', '5\\u2003The search was suspended and the Central Narcotics Bureau (\u201cCNB\u201d) was contacted. CNB officers arrived shortly after this at about 8.03pm. At about 8.05pm, the Appellant was brought to the ICA Arrival Car office where CNB officer Corporal Abdul Rahim bin Muhamad recorded a contemporaneous statement from the Appellant between 8.08pm and 8.27pm. In the statement, the Appellant maintained that he did not know about the bundles in the Motorcycle and that he did not know who they belonged to. He further indicated that he had come to Singapore to meet a friend.', '6\\u2003A follow-up operation was then carried out by the CNB officers. This was aimed at apprehending any others who might be expected to collect the drugs from the Appellant. Corporal Vengedesh Raj Nainar s\/o Nagarajan (\u201cCpl Vengedesh\u201d) and Corporal Sollehen bin Sahadan (\u201cCpl Sollehen\u201d) directed the Appellant to communicate with one Ganesh, who the Appellant believed had arranged for the drugs to be placed in the Motorcycle. These communications took place under the supervision and at the direction of the CNB officers. Between 9.52pm on 24 March 2014 and 2.06am on 25 March 2014, Cpl Vengedesh and Cpl Sollehen were beside the Appellant as he contacted a few people regarding the collection of the black bundles. This was done through phone calls and text messages. The phone conversations were conducted over the speaker, so that the CNB officers could hear the conversations, which were in Tamil. Cpl Vengedesh spoke Tamil and could understand what was being said. However, Cpl Vengedesh, who gave evidence below, testified that he could not recall the contents of the conversations. As for Cpl Sollehen, he did not speak Tamil and could not understand the conversations. It subsequently emerged that regrettably, no audio recordings of the conversations were made in the course of the follow-up operation. The Prosecution, however, tendered a four-page extract of the CNB officers\u2019 investigation diary which contained some basic entries concerning the follow-up operation. We will make reference to and consider these entries in the course of this judgment.', '7\\u2003At about 9.56pm on 24 March 2014, Cpl Vengedesh informed the other CNB officers involved in the follow-up operation that the Appellant had been instructed by Ganesh to park the Motorcycle near a convenience store along Woodlands Centre Road. A team of CNB officers was deployed on this basis, but the operation was called off at about 3am on 25 March 2014 when no recipient turned up.', '8\\u2003The three black bundles found on the Motorcycle were subsequently found to contain not less than 46g of diamorphine, following an analysis conducted by the Health Sciences Authority.', '9\\u2003When arrested, Appellant was also found with RM55 and no Singapore currency. He was also carrying two mobile phones, both with Malaysian SIM cards in them, as well as an additional Singapore SIM card in his wallet. Under the seat of the Motorcycle, a scarf and a screwdriver were found on the seat compartment lid. Swabs were taken from the three bundles, the screwdriver and the four screws that held the seat compartment lid in place, but no useful DNA profiles could be generated from them. As for the DNA profile obtained from the scarf and the seat compartment lid, a complicated mixed DNA profile was obtained and this proved to be incapable of interpretation.', '10\\u2003One charge of illegal importation was brought against the Appellant under s 7 of the MDA and it read as follows:'"}
