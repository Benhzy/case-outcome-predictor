Instead he mounted the defence that his loan to F8 was not relevant to the plaintiff\u2019s investment because it had been made prior to that investment. 8', 'Even in his evidence at trial, the second defendant maintained that there had not been conversion of that loan into equity. 9', '7\\u2003However, when the second defendant\u2019s witnesses followed him onto the stand, a different story emerged. The company\u2019s external accountant and company secretary, Jovi Sen Joon (\u201cSen\u201d), and the co-founder, Daryl Lim Meng Siang (\u201cLim\u201d), both testified that the second defendant\u2019s loan to F8 had been converted into equity, together with all other existing director and shareholder loans. 10', 'While the requisite shareholders\u2019 resolution was not disclosed or adduced into evidence, the conversion is referred to in the general ledger exhibited in Lim\u2019s affidavit as having taken place on 31 August 2017. 11', 'I accept the evidence of Sen and Lim in this regard. The second defendant had indeed held up his end of the bargain by converting his loan to F8 into equity. The curiosity that the second defendant never accepted this apparently favourable fact is explained by a further point.', '8\\u2003Regardless of the conversion of his loan to F8 into equity, he still owed First Media $50,000. Though this was a personal debt, the second defendant used F8\u2019s funds towards paying it off. First, unknown to the plaintiff, on 10 August 2017 F8 paid $13,000 to First Media in part-payment of First Media\u2019s loan to the second defendant. 12', 'Second, the second defendant, again without the knowledge of the plaintiff, increased his salary and that of Lim. 13', 'The only reason for the increase was to use these additional monies to pay off his loan from First Media. 14', 'The cumulative total of these increases for the period that they were paid (September to December 2017) amounted to $35,000. 15', '9\\u2003The company\u2019s business did not take off. Suspecting mismanagement, the plaintiff asked to inspect the company\u2019s accounts in August 2018. Following his inspection, he raised with the second defendant the issue of the increased salaries. The second defendant agreed that the amount paid out in the guise of increased salaries was to be reflected instead as a loan to him. He promised to repay this loan to F8.', '10\\u2003An important question of fact arises at this juncture. That question is how much of this loan was then repaid by him. The documentary evidence at trial showed that to date he has repaid only some $13,000 of the $35,000 that was paid to him by way of the increased salaries. 16', 'The second defendant however submitted that I should only find that it is not proved one way or the other whether he repaid the balance $22,000. 17', 'I do not accept this submission. The second defendant would know how much he had repaid and would have his own documentary record of such payments. The second defendant contends that his failure to produce such documents was contributed to by the plaintiff\u2019s own failure to plead that the second defendant had not repaid the increased salaries. 18', 'However, as I explain later at [20] to [23], the question of how much the second defendant had repaid of the monies he had caused F8 to disburse had been put in issue. The second defendant is the person who knows best how much he in fact repaid, and his own bank and other personal records would be the best evidence of what he had repaid. His evidence was entirely vague and unsatisfactory on this point, and I do not believe his unsupported assertions that he had repaid more than what the documents placed before the court showed. I thus find on a balance of probabilities that the second defendant only repaid $13,000 of the $35,000. Further, I also find that none of the $13,000 paid directly to First Media by F8 on 10 August 2017 has been repaid to F8.', '11\\u2003The company ceased operations around the end of 2018. 19', 'It had run out of funds to carry on business. 20', 'Hardly any evidence was adduced on the reasons for this business failure.

This is for two reasons: \n(a) First, the 1st defendant asserted that the Lorry could not have \ncovered a distance of about 15m (from the stop line of the Tuas Bay \nDrive to the second lane of Tuas Crescent where the 2nd defendant was) \nat such a high speed that the 2nd defendant only noticed the Lorry \nmoments before the collision. This the 1st defendant submitted, must \nmean that the 2nd defendant was travelling at an excessive speed such \nthat he could not keep a proper lookout.21 \n(b) Second, the 1st defendant submitted, in reliance on the MAG, that \nas the Lorry Driver had proceeded to drive across the Cross Junction and \nwas substantially able to cross the cross junction, when the 2nd \ndefendant suddenly appeared and collided with the left of the Lorry, the \nliability of the 2nd defendant should be increased by 5-10%.22\nSummary of the 2nd defendant\u2019s case\n18 The 2nd defendant is unrepresented. His case is that he was not negligent, \nas he did keep a proper lookout and did not ride at an excessive speed: \n20 1st Defendant\u2019s Closing Submissions at [15].\n21 1st Defendant\u2019s Closing Submissions at [17]\u2013[19].\n22 1st Defendant\u2019s Opening Statement at [18].\nVersion No 1: 04 May 2021 (11:30 hrs)\nPoongothai Kuppusamy v Hua Tiong Contractor Pte Ltd[2021] SGHC 108\n9(a) The 2nd defendant testified that he did not see the speedometer \nwhen he was riding along Tuas Crescent, but thought that he was riding \nat about 50\u201355km\/h, which is his usual speed at fourth gear, before he \nbraked on seeing the Lorry move into the Cross Junction. \n(b) As his Motorcycle neared the Cross Junction, he saw that the \nLorry was stationary at the stop line. As such, he was under the \nimpression that the Lorry Driver had seen his Motorcycle and would \ngive way to him. \n(c) However, when the Motorcycle was about to enter into the Cross \nJunction, the Lorry suddenly entered the Cross Junction as well.\n(d) The 2nd defendant applied his brakes as soon as he saw the Lorry \nmove. \n(e) But he was not able to stop the Motorcycle in time and collided \nwith the left side of the Lorry, near the diesel fuel tank, which is closer \nto the front of the left side of the Lorry. \n(f) He stated that he had about 2\u20133 seconds to react. Due to shock, \nhe took no other evasive action besides pressing on the brake, as he \nwanted to stop the Motorcycle as soon as possible. \n19 His Motorcycle landed on the road, on its left side. The left handle of \nthe Motorcycle was dented and the plastic piece covering the front wheel was \nscratched, but the Motorcycle was otherwise undamaged. The 2nd defendant had \nsome scratches on the toes of his left leg but was otherwise uninjured. The \nplaintiff suffered more severe injuries, as her left leg was under the wheel of the \nLorry.\nVersion No 1: 04 May 2021 (11:30 hrs)\nPoongothai Kuppusamy v Hua Tiong Contractor Pte Ltd[2021] SGHC 108\n10Summary of the Intervener\u2019s case\n20 The 2nd defendant is uninsured against the plaintiff\u2019s claim, as the 2nd \ndefendant\u2019s Motorcycle did not have the requisite insurance coverage to cover \npillion riders. As such, any potential liability on his part would have to be \nsatisfied by the Motor Insurers\u2019 Bureau of Singapore (\u201cMIB\u201d) pursuant to their \nagreement with the Minister of Finance. The MIB thus sought and was granted \nleave to be added as intervener to this action (\u201cthe Intervener\u201d).\n21 The Intervener\u2019s case is that the Lorry Driver should be found fully \nliable for the Accident.23 The Lorry Driver failed to properly check for \noncoming traffic along the main road:\n(a) From the scene photographs, it is clear that visibility from both \nthe perspectives of the Lorry Driver and the 2nd defendant were good. \nFrom the Lorry Driver\u2019s perspective, the road to his left at the stop line \nis a straight road with no obstructions.24 \n(b) It is therefore inconceivable that the Lorry Driver did not notice \nthe presence of the 2nd defendant\u2019s Motorcycle approaching the Cross \nJunction when he had purportedly stopped and checked for oncoming \ntraffic at the stop line. This is especially given that the Lorry Driver had \na clear view of the road on his left all the way to the green signboard \nnear the entrance into Tuas Crescent,25 and he had allegedly checked for \noncoming traffic while crossing the Cross-Junction.26  \n23 Intervener\u2019s Closing Submissions dated 14 April 2021 at [46].\n24 Intervener\u2019s Opening Statement dated 6 April 2021 at [13].\n25 Intervener\u2019s Opening Statement dated 6 April 2021 at [19]; Intervener\u2019s Closing \nSubmissions dated 14 April 2021 at [21].\n26 Intervener\u2019s Closing Submissions dated 14 April 2021 at [26].\nVersion No 1: 04 May 2021 (11:30 hrs)\nPoongothai Kuppusamy v Hua Tiong Contractor Pte Ltd[2021] SGHC 108\n11(c) This means that the Lorry Driver completely failed to keep a \nproper lookout, which is why he failed to notice the Motorcycle.27\n22 The Intervener also submitted that the Lorry Driver was prone to \nembellishment and prevarication in the course of the trial, such that his evidence \nhad to be treated with circumspection. The Intervener provided three instances \nof this:\n(a) His evidence on his checks for oncoming traffic was \nincrementally extensive. \n(i) While the Lorry Driver mentioned in his affidavit of \nevidence-in-chief that he had come to a stop at the stop line to \ncheck for oncoming traffic along the main road, he stated there \nthat he done so through checking his wing mirrors only. Neither \nof the side mirrors would have enabled him to adequately check \nfor oncoming traffic along the main road, since the mirrors were \nangled more towards the back view of the Lorry.28 \n(ii) During cross-examination by the Intervener on this, the \nLorry Driver clarified that he was referring to windows of his car \nin his affidavit, and not the mirrors. \n(iii) He further added that he had checked his blind spots \nbefore moving off. \n(iv) When subsequently asked by the court on this, his checks \nfor oncoming traffic became more extensive, as he additionally \n27 Intervener\u2019s Closing Submissions dated 14 April 2021 at [28].\n28 Intervener Opening Statement dated 6 April 2021 at [15].\nVersion No 1: 04 May 2021 (11:30 hrs)\nPoongothai Kuppusamy v Hua Tiong Contractor Pte Ltd[2021] SGHC 108\n12asserted that he continued to check for traffic even while he was \ndriving into the junction.29\n(b) The Lorry Driver only mentioned that he was travelling at 7km\/h \nand that there was a GPS record during cross-examination. But it is \nsurprising that he had not mentioned this in his affidavit of evidence-in-\nchief when it was the 2nd defendant\u2019s allegation all along that the Lorry \nDriver was speeding.30 \n(c) The photograph of the position of the Lorry at the time of \ncollision shows the final resting position of the rear tyre of the Lorry \nnear a square drain cover on the road. During trial, when asked to mark \nthe location of the Lorry, his marking was nowhere near the said drain \ncover. This shows that he was merely trying to show that the Lorry had \nsubstantially crossed the Cross-Junction.31 \n23 The Intervener submitted that the 2nd defendant\u2019s evidence is, in \ncontrast, consistent and clear:  \n(a) His oral testimony is consistent that he saw the Lorry stationary \nat the stop line as he was approaching the Cross-Junction. \n(b) While he could not recall exactly how fast he was travelling at, \nhe was able to provide a good estimate of his speed, and he was able to \nmark out exactly where he first saw the Lorry and when the Lorry started \nto move. \n29 Intervener\u2019s Closing Submissions dated 14 April 2021 at [11].\n30 Intervener\u2019s Closing Submissions dated 14 April 2021 at [11(ii)].\n31 Intervener\u2019s Closing Submissions dated 14 April 2021 at [11(iii)].\nVersion No 1: 04 May 2021 (11:30 hrs)\nPoongothai Kuppusamy v Hua Tiong Contractor Pte Ltd[2021] SGHC 108\n1324 The Intervener submitted that the 2nd defendant was not negligent: \n(a) There is no basis to suggest that he was speeding, or that he did \nnot brake at all.32 Given the minor damage to the 2nd defendant\u2019s \nMotorcycle and his minor injuries, the 1st defendant could not have been \ntravelling at a high speed. The only reason why the plaintiff\u2019s injuries \nwere much more serious was because the rear tyre of the Lorry rolled \nover her left leg.33 \n(b) It was also reasonable that the 2nd defendant maintained the same \nspeed in crossing the Cross-Junction.34 The 2nd defendant had in fact \nnoticed the Lorry stationary at the stop line while he was nearing the \njunction. It was reasonable for the 2nd defendant to infer that the Lorry \nDriver had seen his approach and was stopping to give way to his \nMotorcycle. As such, 2nd defendant could not have reasonably \nanticipated that the Lorry would suddenly move off and enter into the \njunction as the 2nd defendant was entering into the same.35 \n(c) Further, there was no other evasive action the 2nd defendant \ncould have taken to avoid the Accident. As the Lorry had moved into \nthe path of the Motorcycle, there was no way the 2nd defendant could \nhave stopped in time.36 At the speed of 50\u201355km\/h, the stopping distance \nwould have been 35\u201345m, as set out in the Highway Code. \n32 Intervener\u2019s Closing Submissions dated 14 April 2021 at [29]\u2013[30].\n33 Intervener\u2019s Closing Submissions dated 14 April 2021 at [31].\n34 Intervener\u2019s Closing Submissions dated 14 April 2021 at [34].\n35 Intervener\u2019s Opening Statement dated 6 April 2021 at [21]\u2013[22].\n36 Intervener\u2019s Closing Submissions dated 14 April 2021 at [38].\nVersion No 1: 04 May 2021 (11:30 hrs)\nPoongothai Kuppusamy v Hua Tiong Contractor Pte Ltd[2021] SGHC 108\n1425 The Intervener relied on Ong Sim Moy and others v Ong Sim Hoe [1968-\n1970] SLR(R) 363 (\u201cOng Sim Moy v Ong Sim Hoe\u201d), Yap Yew Yee v \nSubramaniam & Anor [1972] 2 MLJ 53 (\u201cYap Yew Yee v Subramaniam\u201d), and \nCheung Fung (a patient) (suing by his litigation representative Goh Fun Cheng) \nv Shanmugam Thanabal [2014] SGHC 271 (\u201cCheung Fung v Shanmugam\u201d), to \nsubmit that the Lorry Driver should be found fully liable for the Accident with \nthe 2nd Defendant\u2019s Motorcycle. In all three cases, the motorist entering the \njunction from a minor road failed to stop and collided with a vehicle traveling \nalong a major road. The motorist in all three cases were found fully liable for \nthe accident. In Ong Sim Moy v Ong Sim Hoe (at [5]), the court held that the \nlorry driver on the major road was not at fault, as he had done all he could to \navoid a collision by applying his brakes and swerving to his right. In Yap Yew \nYee v Subramaniam, the Malaysian court held that the taxi driver travelling on \nthe major road was entitled to assume that the motorcyclist coming from the \nminor road would have stopped at the junction, and there was nothing the taxi \ndriver could have done to avoid the accident.\n26 The Intervener submitted that the 1st defendant\u2019s reliance on the MAG \nis misconceived. The suggestion provided in the MAG on the apportionment of \nliability presupposes that the driver along the main road was in a position to take \nevasive action. But in this case, there was nothing the 2nd defendant could have \ndone.37 \n27 The Intervener also distinguished Ng Swee Eng: \n37 Intervener\u2019s Closing Submissions dated 14 April 2021 at [42].\nVersion No 1: 04 May 2021 (11:30 hrs)\nPoongothai Kuppusamy v Hua Tiong Contractor Pte Ltd[2021] SGHC 108\n15(a) The defendant there was making a right turn across a junction \nwhen he collided with the motorcyclist who was proceeding straight into \nthe junction (with the right of way). \n(b) The apportionment there appears to be based on the \nconsideration that after turning, the lorry had driven across 1.75 lanes of \nthe opposite side of the road before the collision occurred. The deceased \nthus ought to have had sufficient time to notice the lorry and take \nprecautions. \n(c) In the present case, it would not have taken the Lorry much time \nto enter the Cross-Junction and encroach onto the 2nd defendant\u2019s path. \nHence, there was not sufficient time for the 2nd defendant to notice the \nLorry in this case and for the 2nd defendant to take precautions.\nMy Decision\n28 After going through the evidence and the submissions, I find that the 1st \nDefendant should bear 100% of the liability: \n(a) It is undisputed that there was a stop sign at Tuas Bay Drive, the \nminor road where the Lorry Driver was. \n(b) The Motorcycle travelling on the major road, clearly had the \nright of way as per para 70 of the Highway Code (Cap 276, R 11, 1990 \nRev Ed). \n(c) The onus was on the Lorry Driver to stop and check for \noncoming vehicles before entering the Cross Junction. I find that he did \nnot do so before entering the Cross Junction.\nVersion No 1: 04 May 2021 (11:30 hrs)\nPoongothai Kuppusamy v Hua Tiong Contractor Pte Ltd[2021] SGHC 108\n1629 I also find that there is no evidence that the 2nd defendant was negligent \nand thus liable to contribute: \n(a) I accept the 2nd Defendant\u2019s version of the event, that he saw the \nLorry stop behind the stop line, and so he continued to move into the \nCross Junction; \n(b) I also accept that the 2nd defendant was not speeding;\n(c) I find that it was the Lorry that moved suddenly into the Cross \nJunction as the Motorcycle was nearing it; and\n(d) the 2nd defendant did what he could in the circumstances, which \nwas to pull the brakes on his Motorcycle. \nThe Lorry Driver\u2019s evidence\n30 I did not find the Lorry Driver to be a credible witness. He made \nexaggerated allegations on several occasions during his cross-examination, \nwhich on questioning were found to be wholly unsubstantiated:\n(a) One example is his allegation that the Motorcycle was speeding. \nHe later acknowledged that he would not have known this, since his \nevidence is that he did not even see the Motorcycle. \n(b) A second example is his evidence that the pillion rider was \nthrown off the Motorcycle because of the high speed it was travelling at. \nHe later acknowledged that he would not have known this because he \ndid not see the Accident take place. In fact, his evidence is that he \ninitially thought that the sound of the impact was that of a burst tyre. \nVersion No 1: 04 May 2021 (11:30 hrs)\nPoongothai Kuppusamy v Hua Tiong Contractor Pte Ltd[2021] SGHC 108\n17(c) A third example is the Lorry Driver\u2019s claim that the 2nd \ndefendant\u2019s Motorcycle had skidded, which was denied by the 2nd \ndefendant. The Lorry Driver admitted that he did not hear or see any \nskidding. Neither did he see any marks on the road that showed that the \nMotorcycle skidded. \n(d) A fourth example is his evidence in court that he was only \ntraveling at a very slow speed of 7km\/h into the junction. This was not \nin his police report or affidavit. He was unable to produce any objective \nrecord to substantiate this claim. It is also an incredibly slow speed \nwhich most vehicles normally do not travel at. Yet, his evidence was \nthat this is the speed that he usually entered into cross junctions.\n(e) A fifth example is his evidence in court that the front of the Lorry \ncabin was already in Tuas Avenue 20, and that he had substantially \npassed the Cross Junction at the time of the Accident. This is \ncontradicted by the accident photograph enclosed in his own affidavit, \nwhich showed that the Lorry was still in the Cross Junction after the \nAccident.38 He also testified that the photograph reflects exactly where \nthe Lorry was positioned at the time of the impact.\n31 Importantly, the nub of the Lorry Driver\u2019s evidence, that he kept a \nproper lookout before he entered the Cross Junction, lacks credibility: \n(a) He maintained that he kept a lookout for oncoming vehicles, and \nin fact checked again even as he moved into the junction, and that he \nsaw no vehicles. \n38 Amirthalingam Kanmani\u2019s Affidavit of Evidence-Chief dated 14 January 2021 at p 19.\nVersion No 1: 04 May 2021 (11:30 hrs)\nPoongothai Kuppusamy v Hua Tiong Contractor Pte Ltd[2021] SGHC 108\n18(b) This was despite the fact that he had clear vision of any vehicles \napproaching. In fact, his evidence was that he could see up to the \ndistance of the green sign in Exhibit B in 2AB, which is quite far away. \n(c) Even if a vehicle was speeding, it would have taken several \nseconds to traverse the distance down Tuas Crescent towards the Cross \nJunction. \n(d) Hence, it is highly implausible that if the Lorry Driver had kept \na lookout, twice as he alleged, he would not see any vehicle. \n(e) I therefore find that he did not see the Motorcycle because he did \nnot keep a proper lookout before he moved into the Cross Junction.\n32 There is also no evidence to support the Lorry Driver\u2019s allegation that \nthe Motorcycle was speeding. Given that the 2nd defendant did not sustain \nsignificant injuries, and given the lack of major damage to his Motorcycle from \nimpact with the Lorry (the left handle was dented from falling onto the road and \nthe plastic piece covering the front wheel was scratched), it is highly unlikely \nthat the Motorcycle was traveling at a high speed when it neared the Cross \nJunction. \nThe 2nd defendant\u2019s evidence\n33 In contrast, I found the 2nd defendant to be a forthright and honest \nwitness:\n(a) His evidence that he was not speeding was supported by the \nobjective evidence which showed that neither he nor his Motorcycle \nsustained any major injury or damage.\nVersion No 1: 04 May 2021 (11:30 hrs)\nPoongothai Kuppusamy v Hua Tiong Contractor Pte Ltd[2021] SGHC 108\n19(b) When he was asked about the Lorry Driver\u2019s evidence that he \nwas driving into the junction at 7km\/h, he was candid in admitting that \nhe could not tell what speed the Lorry was moving at, but only added \nthat as the Lorry was much larger, it covered the space before him \nquickly. He said that to him it was moving at a normal speed. \n(c) He was measured and did not take the position of blaming the \nLorry Driver wherever possible. When asked whether he agreed with the \nLorry Driver\u2019s evidence that he stopped immediately upon impact, he \ntestified that it was important for him to say that the Lorry Driver was \nright in saying that he braked. He said that if the Lorry Driver had not, \nthe Lorry would have gone over more of the plaintiff\u2019s body.\n34 On the facts, I find that there was nothing more that the 2nd defendant \ncould have done to avoid the Accident: \n(a) The law only requires a road user to anticipate an act which is \nreasonably foreseeable as being within the ordinary range of human \nexperience. This duty is not an overly onerous one such that the road \nuser has to guard against every conceivable eventuality (see SBS Transit \nLtd v Stafford Rosemary Anne Jane (administratrix of the estate of \nAnthony John Stafford, deceased) [2007] SLR(R) 211 at [33]).\n(b) Further, there is no legal duty on a driver to slow down \nautomatically each time when the driver approaches a junction where \nthere is no stop sign (see Ong Bee Nah v Won Siew Wan (Yong Tian \nChoy, third party) [2005] 2 SLR(R) 455 at [95]).  \nVersion No 1: 04 May 2021 (11:30 hrs)\nPoongothai Kuppusamy v Hua Tiong Contractor Pte Ltd[2021] SGHC 108\n20(c) The 2nd defendant could not have reasonably foreseen that the \nLorry Driver would suddenly enter into the junction and collide with his \nMotorcycle. \n(d) In fact, he had done what he reasonably could by pressing on the \nbrakes of the Motorcycle and avoided further damage to the vehicles and \nhimself. Unfortunately, the plaintiff was injured. But that was not due to \nthe 2nd defendant\u2019s negligence.\n35 In line with this, the MAG\u2019s starting point of 20% liability for the \nmotorist traveling on the major road, which the 1st defendant relied on (at [ 11] \nabove), would not apply here. The MAG is a helpful guide, but its suggestions \non apportionment of liability require the court to further take into account the \nfacts of each case. The MAG\u2019s suggestion of 20% liability as a starting point, \npresupposes that the motorist along the main road is in a position to take evasive \naction to avoid the collision. Here, I have found that there was nothing that the \n2nd defendant could have done to avoid the collision. The apportionment of \nliability is premised upon the finding of liability. As I have found that the 2nd \ndefendant is not liable, the issue of apportionment does not arise. \n36 The 1st defendant also relied on Ng Swee Eng. But that case turns on \ndifferent considerations. In that case, a lorry was making a right turn at a \njunction into the main road. A motorcycle was traveling on the main road, \ncoming from the right side of the junction, towards the junction. The court held \nthat the motorcyclist was 20% liable for the accident when the motorcycle \ncollided with the lorry. On the facts there, the court found that a reasonable \nmotorcyclist would have seen the lorry and yet there was no tyre mark, \nindicating that the motorcyclist either did not see the impending collision in \ntime, or had misjudged the lorry\u2019s speed (see Ng Swee Eng at [65]). \nVersion No 1: 04 May 2021 (11:30 hrs)\nPoongothai Kuppusamy v Hua Tiong Contractor Pte Ltd[2021] SGHC 108\n2137 But here, the 2nd defendant could not have reasonably foreseen that the \nLorry would move off from its stationary position behind the stop line. The 2nd \ndefendant also pulled on the brake as soon as he saw the Lorry enter the Cross \nJunction. At this point, the Motorcycle was already very close to the junction. \nThe 2nd defendant could not have safely taken any other evasive action.  \nIntervener\u2019s late submission on the 1st defendant\u2019s lack of notice of \ncontribution\n38 After the trial and after parties had filed their closing submissions, the \nIntervener filed a supplementary submission dated 23 April 2021, relying on \nHwa Aik Engineering Pte Ltd v Munshi Mohammad Faiz and another [2021] \nSGHC(A) 1 (\u201cHwa Aik\u201d) to submit that the 1st defendant should not be permitted \nto ask the court to apportion liability between the 1st and 2nd defendants since \nthe 1st defendant had not served the 2nd defendant with any formal notice of \ncontribution under O 16 r 8 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed). \nOrder 16 r 8 refers to a notice \u201ccontaining a statement of the nature and grounds \nof his claim or, as the case may be, of the question or issue required to be \ndetermined\u201d. In Hwa Aik (at [33]), the Appellate Division of the High Court had \nadvised that:\nWe hope that, in future, solicitors will not assume that there is \nsuch a power [for the court to order contribution] and will make \nthe appropriate submissions before the court of first instance \nbut, as mentioned, it would be preferable if the situation were \nsimply avoided by the filing of a formal claim for contribution. \n39 The 1st defendant subsequently filed their reply through supplementary \nclosing submissions. The 1st  defendant submitted that in the present case, the \nnotice to seek contribution from the 2nd defendant was already given in the form \nof the 1st defendant\u2019s pleadings, where the 1st defendant had expressly served on \nVersion No 1: 04 May 2021 (11:30 hrs)\nPoongothai Kuppusamy v Hua Tiong Contractor Pte Ltd[2021] SGHC 108\n22the 2nd defendant \u201ca statement of the nature and ground of his claim\u201d.39 In \naddition, the 1st defendant had at the close of the 1st defendant\u2019s case, informed \nthe Court through their solicitors that the 1st defendant would, for the avoidance \nof doubt, be seeking contribution from the 2nd defendant. Thus, there is no doubt \nthat the 1st defendant had given notice of his claim for contribution against the \n2nd defendant. \n40 In light of my finding that the 1st defendant is 100% liable, this issue is \nnot germane. I have thus not asked for further submissions from parties on \nwhether the lack of an O 16 r 8 notice constrains the power of the court in \napportioning liability in the circumstances of this case. I note that in Singapore \nCivil Procedure 2020, vol 1 (Chua Lee Ming gen ed) (Sweet & Maxwell, 10th \ned, 2019) at [16\/8\/1], it is stated, in relation to O 16 r 8, that: \nExcept where the two defendants are sued as tortfeasors \nliable in respect of the same damage, it is necessary for a \ndefendant who claims against his co-defendant relief of any of \nthe kinds mentioned in the rule to issue and serve upon him a \nthird party notice under this rule and a summons for third \nparty directions under r.4. \n[emphasis added]\n41 Here, the two defendants are sued as tortfeasors liable in respect of the \nsame damage. I also note that in Hwa Aik, the defendants had only focused on \ntheir liability vis-\u00e0-vis the plaintiff at the trial. The third defendant (who was \nseeking leave to"}

As an EFA, PTO would have been able to sell, with PACS\u2019 agreement, products of other insurance companies that were not offered by PACS. Eventually, however, this proposal did not bear fruit and PTO did not become an EFA.', '39\\u2003On 14 September 2010, PACS issued AI No 017\/10 (the \u201cSeptember 2010 AI\u201d), which introduced the following provision (the \u201cNon-Solicitation Clause\u201d): 14', '40\\u2003As stated at [28] above, PACS came up with the Master GAM scheme in 2011. The impetus for this scheme was the fact that by March 2011, the size of PTO had exceeded the Span of Control Guidelines. To comply with the Span of Control Guidelines, some of the Tier 2 ALs in PTO had to be promoted to become Tier 3 GALs or GAMs. However, PACS regarded Peter as being central to the growth of PTO. PACS therefore wanted the Tier 2 ALs in PTO to remain as part of PTO under Peter\u2019s management, after they were promoted to become Tier 3 GAMs. The Master GAM scheme achieved this objective.', '41\\u2003The Master GAM scheme was implemented via a Memorandum of Understanding dated 30 March 2011 (\u201cthe 2011 MOU\u201d), 15', 'as amended by various addenda dated 29 April 2011, 16', '20 May 2011 17', 'and 20 September 2011. 18', 'The 2011 MOU was entered into between PACS and Peter Tan.

However, unlike Darren and Cynthia who remained within PTO, Steven\u2019s unit was spun off and became a GAM unit that operated independently of PTO.', '(d)\\u2003Peter became the Master GAM of PTO. Concurrently, he was also a GAM within PTO.', '43\\u2003As a Master GAM, Peter could no longer receive ORs from sales generated by each of the GAM units in PTO (other than his own GAM unit). Peter negotiated for and PACS agreed to pay him the following:', '(a)\\u2003special sell-out payments amounting to about $7m from PACS;', '(b)\\u2003a Master GAM growth bonus for the growth of PTO; and', '(c)\\u2003a Master GAM super bonus of up to $1m if PTO achieved certain sales targets set by PACS.', 'The Master GAM growth and super bonuses were over and above what Peter was entitled to be paid as a GAM. It was at least unclear whether the Master GAM super bonus breached MAS 306 since arguably, it could be seen as payments of overriding benefits from sales generated by agents under the other GAMs in PTO. As these payments were to be made to Peter as the Master GAM, arguably the payment of overrides involved four tiers. However, this was not an issue that I had to decide.', '44\\u2003The sell-out payments that Peter negotiated for included sell-out payments in respect of Darren\u2019s and Cynthia\u2019s GAM units. These payments were meant to compensate Peter for his loss of overrides from Darren\u2019s and Cynthia\u2019s units following their promotion to GAMs. The amounts had been fixed in 2011 with no further revisions to the amount (whether upwards or downwards) to take into account the actual performance of these units. In January 2013, Peter asked for an increase in the sell-out payments because Darren\u2019s and Cynthia\u2019s GAM units had performed much better than expected.', '45\\u2003By way of a letter dated 31 January 2013, 19', 'PACS agreed to:', '(a)\\u2003re-compute, annually, the sell-out payments in respect of Darren\u2019s and Cynthia\u2019s GAM units based on the actual sales performance of these units and the agency rank achieved by each AL in these units (\u201ctrue up adjustments\u201d); and', '(b)\\u2003pay Peter 50% of the true up adjustments in five instalments over a five-year period; conversely, PACS would also be able to claw back from Peter 50% of the true up adjustments for any underperformance.', 'The final true up exercise was to be conducted in April 2016.', '46\\u2003PTO continued to grow.

According to Peter, PACS suggested a limited FA (\u201cLFA\u201d) scheme. The LFA was similar to the EFA except that the LFA would be allowed to sell other insurance companies\u2019 products subject to a limit. However, the discussions again did not bear fruit.', '48\\u2003Although each of the GAM units within PTO had to comply with the Span of Control Guidelines, PTO itself, as a Master GAM unit, could grow beyond 176 agents, which it did, eventually comprising some 500 agents in 2016.', '49\\u2003PTO became the largest agency group in PACS, contributing approximately 10% of PACS\u2019 entire agency force sales production measured in annual premium equivalent (\u201cAPE\u201d). The APE is calculated by adding the annualised regular premiums from new policies and 10% of single premiums on new policies written during a specified period. 22', 'It reflects the value of sales of insurance products and is a sales measure used in the insurance industry. Agents in PTO were also generally more productive in terms of the amount of APE generated per agent as compared to PACS\u2019 overall agency force.', '50\\u2003On 1 July 2015, Peter entered into an agreement with PACS under which Peter would receive further payments over and above those payable to him as a Tier 3 GAM and as a Master GAM (the \u201cPegasus Agreement\u201d). 23', 'The commencement of the Pegasus Agreement was backdated to 1 January 2014.

Based on PACS\u2019 assessment at that time (around 2015), the total amount to be paid to Peter under the Pegasus Agreement at the end of the ten-year period was estimated to range from $6.2m (assuming 0% growth year-on-year during the initial six-year term) to $15.9m (assuming 30% growth year-on-year during the initial six-year term). 24', '53\\u2003The Pegasus Agreement was terminated upon Peter\u2019s summary termination from Prudential on 12 July 2016.', '54\\u2003By all accounts, Peter had done extremely well and was highly valued by PACS. Between 2006 and 2016, the total amount of remuneration (comprising commissions, bonuses, incentives and other benefits) paid by PACS to Peter was approximately $56.2m. 25', 'In 2015 alone, Peter was paid $9.7m by PACS. 26', '55\\u2003Mr Seah Cheng Chua Philip (\u201cPhilip\u201d) took over as Chief Executive Officer (\u201cCEO\u201d) of PACS in December 2015.

The second defendant also highlights Dr Lai\u2019s testimony that he was told that the purpose of the second defendant\u2019s mental assessment was the sale of the second defendant\u2019s shop, and not the signing of a guarantee. 116', '106\\u2003On the other hand, the second defendant gave evidence that the Mental Capacity Affidavit, in which he admitted to pledging the sale proceeds of the Rangoon Road Property to take the Loan from the plaintiff, is true and that his AEIC in the present suit is false: 117', 'The second defendant also asserts legal advice privilege over the reason he engaged Dr Lai\u2019s services. 118', '107\\u2003I find that the second defendant\u2019s account of having misunderstood the Guarantee is contradicted by his own evidence and is wholly unreliable. As such, his plea of non est factum cannot succeed on the basis of there being a radical difference between what was believed to be signed and what the Guarantee actually means. To successfully establish non est factum, the second defendant must instead prove that his mental incapacity impaired his understanding to such an extent that the element of consent required for contractual formation is totally lacking (Saunders at 1025; Ford (by his tutor Watkinson) v Perpetual Trustees Victoria Ltd (2009) 257 ALR 658 (\u201cFord\u201d) at [85]).', '108\\u2003However, the tests to render a contract voidable due to a party\u2019s mental incapacity (see [65] above) and void under a plea of non est factum (see [103] above) are not identical. Just because a party is mentally incapacitated does not necessarily mean that his\/her plea of non est factum will succeed. In connection with the definition of mental incapacity at common law, the English High Court in Fehily and another v Atkinson and another [2017] Bus LR 695 (\u201cFehily\u201d) at [102] made clear that mental capacity encompasses a range of cognitive functions (eg, processing and weighing information) of which understanding is merely a part. This definition of mental capacity in Fehily is consistent with the statutory one in ss 4(1) and 5(1) of Singapore\u2019s MCA. Aedit Abdullah J also confirmed in BUV v BUU and another and another matter [2019] SGHCF 15 at [31] that the absence of any one cognitive function in s 5(1) (eg, to use or weigh information to make a decision) will result in a finding of incapacity. In other words, one may be able to understand a document explained to him\/her but yet lack mental capacity.', '109\\u2003Mental incapacity may only ground a plea of non est factum if it deprives the relevant party of \u201cany real understanding of the purport of a particular document\u201d. This was held by Lord Reid in Saunders (at 1016):', '110\\u2003I make several observations in relation to Lord Reid\u2019s statement of the law. First, the party\u2019s ability to understand information is assessed in relation to the particular document in question, ie, the Guarantee in this case.', '111\\u2003Second, while Lord Reid framed the question as the party\u2019s ability to understand the document \u201cwithout explanation\u201d, this aspect of his statement should be confined to the facts of Saunders, in which no proper explanation of the deed was offered to Mrs Gallie. Where the document is actually explained to the party in question, the court should consider if such explanation imparted the requisite degree of understanding of the document such that the party\u2019s signature represents his\/her consent to the contract (Ford at [12] and [85]).', '112\\u2003Third, Lord Reid did not expound on what \u201cany real understanding\u201d entails. However, some guidance may be gleaned from Lord Pearson, who stated in Saunders (at 1034) that:', '113\\u2003With these principles in mind, the first element of non est factum (as reformulated at [107] above) turns on the determination of two issues: (a) whether the second defendant had the ability to understand the Guarantee if it was explained to him at the 22 June meetings; and (b) whether and how the Guarantee was explained to him at the 22 June meetings.', '114\\u2003I deal first with the second defendant\u2019s argument that he lacked the mental capacity to understand the Guarantee even if it was explained to him. In this regard, the medical evidence is a guide for the court (Fehily at [84]).', '115\\u2003Initially, Professor Kua\u2019s report of 27 July 2017 concluded that being mentally retarded and mentally incapacitated, the second defendant would have difficulties understanding complex financial transactions and documents. 119', 'Further, in his subsequent report of 4 January 2019, he recorded having shown the second defendant the Guarantee, in response to which the second defendant said that this was what Coco had asked him to sign for the sale of the Rangoon Road Property in mid-2017. 120', 'However, during re-examination, Professor Kua accepted that if the relevant documents (including the Guarantee) were explained to the second defendant in the \u201cproper way, he would probably understand what it means\u201d: 121', \"116\\u2003The second defendant seeks to discredit the foregoing portion of Professor Kua's testimony in re-examination by arguing that he was \u201ctalking about a hypothetical person with the level of intelligence of Yip\u201d, and not the second defendant. 122\", 'However, this interpretation over-fixates on the phrase \u201ceven if someone with\u201d. Read in its entire context, I have no doubt that Professor Kua had the second defendant in mind when he said \u201che would probably understand what it means\u201d. Mr Vincent Yeoh\u2019s (second defendant\u2019s counsel) (\u201cMr Yeoh\u201d) preceding question concerned the second defendant directly, viz, whether someone talking to the second defendant would suspect that something is amiss about his mind. It is also clear from Mr Yeoh\u2019s response, \u201cOkay, I think I know where you are coming from. What you are saying is whether or not [the second defendant] could understand, right \u2026\u201d immediately following the portion of Professor Kua\u2019s testimony in question, that Mr Yeoh interpreted Professor Kua\u2019s response as pertaining to the second defendant\u2019s understanding. 123', '117\\u2003Separately, the second defendant challenges the veracity of three portions of the Official Transcript recording Professor Kua\u2019s cross-examination (the \u201cChallenged Portions of Professor Kua\u2019s testimony\u201d). This challenge first surfaced in the second defendant\u2019s Reply Submissions of 21 January 2021, 124', 'by way of a one-page letter from Professor Kua, dated 18 January 2021, annexed to the Reply Submissions. The Challenged Portions of Professor Kua\u2019s testimony are where the Official Transcript records Professor Kua as stating that the second defendant \u201ccould\u201d understand the LOA, OTP, SD or Guarantee when he had examined the second defendant in 2017 and 2019. The second defendant argues that Professor Kua had actually said that the second defendant \u201ccouldn\u2019t\u201d understand the relevant document. The plaintiff takes the opposing view that the Official Transcript is accurate. 125', 'For ease of reference, I reproduce the Challenged Portions of Professor Kua\u2019s testimony (emphasised in italics) and their surrounding context in the Official Transcript: 126', '118\\u2003I do not accept the second defendant\u2019s belated challenge to the veracity of the Official Transcript. In the absence of any authority on the proper procedure for bringing such a challenge, I take reference from Chan Kok Kiang v Tan Swan Cheng and another [1968-1970] SLR(R) 707 (\u201cChan Kok Kiang\u201d). That case involved an application, on appeal, to amend the Notes of Evidence of the trial by adding in a note taken by one of the appellant\u2019s\/defendant\u2019s counsel at trial. The Court of Appeal\u2019s guidance on the procedure for bringing such an application is instructive for our purposes (Chan Kok Kiang at [6]):', '119\\u2003The appellant\u2019s application in that case was rejected because it was brought at a very late stage in the proceedings and the trial judge and the respondent\u2019s counsel were unable to verify whether the note sought to be introduced was an accurate verbatim record of what the trial judge had said at the trial (Chan Kok Kiang at [7]).', '120\\u2003In light of the principles in Chan Kok Kiang, the second defendant should have scrutinised the Official Transcript and given the court and opposing counsel written notice of his intention to challenge the Official Transcript at the earliest possible opportunity (\u201cWritten Notice\u201d). The Written Notice should have stated his belief that the Official Transcript was wrong and the basis for this belief, so as to enable the court to reach a decision on how to progress the matter. If the plaintiff\u2019s agreement to amend the record was not forthcoming, parties\u2019 should have, once again, written in to the court, which may then have taken the option of re-calling Professor Kua.', '121\\u2003In this case, the second defendant\u2019s failure to provide the court or opposing counsel with a Written Notice and prematurely contacting Professor Kua prior to receiving the court\u2019s directions on this issue removed the option of recalling Professor Kua as a witness. What is also inexplicable is how the second defendant was prepared to mount the present challenge before even obtaining the audio recording of the proceedings; the audio recording was only requested by the plaintiff on 30 January 2021.', '122\\u2003Having reviewed the audio transcript of the trial proceedings, and considering the Challenged Portions of Professor Kua\u2019s testimony in their context, I am unable to verify the accuracy of the second defendant\u2019s proposed alterations and dismiss his challenge to the Official Transcript.', '123\\u2003However, even if I am wrong and the Challenged Portions of Professor Kua\u2019s testimony are indeed inaccurate, this does not affect my decision. For the following reasons, I do not think that the Challenged Portions of Professor Kua\u2019s testimony have a material bearing on whether the second defendant possessed the ability to understand the Guarantee with proper explanations.', '124\\u2003First, the First and Second Challenged Portions of Professor Kua\u2019s testimony (see [117] above) do not concern the Guarantee; they concern the LOA, OTP and SD. In fact, just before the First Challenged Portion of Professor Kua\u2019s testimony, Professor Kua recounted the second defendant as saying \u201cOh, I understand, right\u201d when he was shown his signature on the LOA, OTP and SD.', '125\\u2003Second, when Professor Kua showed the second defendant the LOA on 19 July 2017, he claims to have explained it to the second defendant in Hokkien. However, no evidence was led as to how such explanations were phrased. 127', 'Similarly, when the Guarantee was shown to the second defendant on 3 January 2019, we do not have evidence of how Professor Kua\u2019s nurse attempted to translate the Guarantee to the second defendant as his nurse was not called as a witness. 128', '126\\u2003For these reasons, even if the Challenged Portions of Professor Kua\u2019s testimony are changed, they do not credibly demonstrate that the second defendant was unable to understand the Guarantee at the 22 June meetings, had proper explanations been given. I say this even though I also do not accept the plaintiff\u2019s unsupported contention that the second defendant was malingering when he was assessed by Professor Kua.', '127\\u2003For completeness, given the reasons at [123] and [124] above, I also place little weight on another part of Professor Kua\u2019s testimony where he states that second defendant \u201ccouldn\u2019t understand the content of the [LOA]\u201d (which is, naturally, unchallenged by the second defendant). 129', '128\\u2003 Instead, whether the second defendant was able to understand the Guarantee must be examined in light of the circumstances at the two meetings on 22 June 2017 where Mr Ong did explain the Guarantee.', '129\\u2003Dr Manu Lal assessed the second defendant in December 2015 and January 2016; this is before the Guarantee was signed. However, his report of', '3 February 2016 remains instructive in the following respects as both himself and Professor Kua agree that the degree of the second defendant\u2019s mental incapacity is unlikely to fluctuate. 130', 'While likewise finding that the second defendant was mentally incapacitated, Dr Manu Lal credited the second defendant with being able to do the following in relation to his property and affairs: (a) \u201cunderstand information relevant to a decision\u201d; (b) \u201cretain information long enough to make a decision\u201d; and (c) communicate this decision. However, he assessed the second defendant to be unable to \u201cweigh information\u201d in order to \u201cmake decisions in his best interest\u201d and hence mentally incapacitated. 131', '130\\u2003Further, Dr Manu Lal\u2019s record of the second defendant being able to account for how he would spend $6,000 and $1,000 shows that the latter retained the cognitive ability to make basic financial decisions (see [80] above). Dr Manu Lal\u2019s observation of the second defendant in this regard is consistent with Dr Lai\u2019s (see [86] above), as the latter recorded the second defendant\u2019s awareness of the valuation of the Rangoon Road Property and his ability to manage his daily activities. The second defendant\u2019s awareness of his financial situation (even if limited), lends support to the position that he would have been able to understand the Guarantee if it were explained in layman terms.', '131\\u2003In summary, the expert evidence leads me to conclude that the second defendant retained the ability to understand the Guarantee if properly explained to him.', '132\\u2003Having dismissed the second defendant\u2019s contention that he is unable to understand the Guarantee, I now turn to consider the adequacy of the explanations of the Guarantee provided to the second defendant; this dovetails with Professor Kua\u2019s view that the second defendant would probably have been able to understand the Guarantee had it been properly explained to him (see [115] above). Bearing in mind Professor Kua\u2019s caution that the consequences of the Guarantee must be \u201cclearly\u201d explained, and as I subsequently address at [138] and [142], in the circumstances of this case, the explanation is \u201cproper\u201d if it is clear and captures the key feature(s) of the document (Fehily at [101]).', '133\\u2003A preliminary issue that arises is whether Mr Ong explained the Guarantee in both English and Mandarin. It is not disputed that Mr Ong explained the Guarantee in English at the 22 June meetings. 132', 'The second defendant claims that the Guarantee was not explained to him in Mandarin. 133', 'I do not accept this.', '134\\u2003In respect of the First meeting, Mr Ong\u2019s testimony that he explained the Guarantee in Mandarin is corroborated by Mr Simadiputra 134', 'and Mr Quek. 135', 'Even if the latter two were unable to recall the exact words Mr Ong used to explain the Guarantee in Mandarin, 136', 'this does not mean that no such explanation was provided. Mr Koh also testified that Mr Ong had spoken in Mandarin at the First meeting. 137', '135\\u2003In respect of the Second meeting, the evidence is slightly less clear:', '136\\u2003All things considered, I find that on the balance of probabilities, the Guarantee was explained by Mr Ong in Mandarin at the Second meeting. For one, the testimonies of Mr Elangovan and Mr Koh do not forcefully challenge Mr Ong\u2019s account as neither could positively say whether or not Mandarin was used. In addition, at the First meeting, Mr Ong had established that the second defendant was more comfortable conversing in Mandarin and had addressed him in both English and Mandarin. 142', 'I see no reason for Mr Ong to have abandoned this practice at the Second meeting.', '137\\u2003Further, I accept that the second defendant understands both English and Mandarin. The second defendant testified as to being able to understand Mandarin and in fact admits this at [68(6)] of 2DCS. 143', 'In any event, the testimony of Mr Ong, 144', 'Dr Lai, 145', 'Mr Fernandez, 146', 'Dr Manu Lal 147', 'and Professor Kua 148', 'show that the second defendant understands Mandarin. Additionally, I agree with the plaintiff that the second defendant is able to understand basic English. The following witnesses confirmed that they had conversed with the second defendant in English: Professor Kua, 149', 'Dr Lai, 150', 'Mr Elangovan, 151', 'Mr Fernandez 152', 'and Dr Manu Lal. 153', '138\\u2003Turning to the adequacy of the explanation provided at the First and Second meetings proper, I find that Mr Ong\u2019s explanations of the second defendant\u2019s obligations under the Guarantee were reasonably clear and easy to follow. At the First meeting, it is unclear if Mr Ong had sight of the Guarantee. 154', 'However, he still explained, in Mandarin, the general nature of the Guarantee which was later signed at the Second meeting: 155', '139\\u2003As regards the Second Meeting, the precise wording of Mr Ong\u2019s explanation of the Guarantee was not elicited at trial. However, Mr Ong stressed that the \u201cmain point\u201d he drove across to the second defendant was that \u201che will be fully liable should Megatrucare not pay up\u201d: 156', '140\\u2003Additionally, Mr Ong\u2019s explanations of relevant parts of the Loan Agreement at the Second Meeting would have reinforced the second defendant\u2019s understanding of the Guarantee. Mr Ong explained Clause 3 of the Loan Agreement in Mandarin in these terms: 157', '141\\u2003Also, at the Second Meeting, and in English, Mr Ong stated, in relation to the Loan Agreement, that: 158', '142\\u2003While it was revealed under cross-examination that Mr Ong had misunderstood Clauses 4(b), 5(b), 6 and 8 of the Guarantee, this is irrelevant. 159', 'The second defendant need not have understood every ancillary or procedural aspect of the Guarantee. Instead, if Mr Ong\u2019s explanations were sufficient to give the second defendant an understanding of the key features of the Guarantee (Fehily at [101]), such that the second defendant would be alive to the \u201cfundamental difference between the actual document and the document as [he] had believed it to be\u201d, this would defeat the plea of non est factum (Saunders at 1034). In light of the evidence, I am satisfied that Mr Ong\u2019s explanations in English and Mandarin captured the key features of the Guarantee, namely, that the second defendant would become personally responsible to repay all outstanding amounts under the Loan Agreement if the first defendant failed to do so (Clauses 1 and 2 of the Guarantee). 160', '143\\u2003Further, even though Mr Ong said that his Mandarin is \u201cnot very good\u201d, this does not advance the second defendant\u2019s case. 161', 'Mr Ong also said that his Mandarin proficiency was suited for \u201cbasic conversation\u201d, and I further note that his Mandarin was adequate enough for the court translator to interpret; 162', 'using complex vocabulary would likely confuse the second defendant rather than lend clarity. In any event, Mr Ong also explained the Guarantee in English and, for this reason, even if I am mistaken that the Guarantee was explained in Mandarin at the Second meeting, this does not affect my conclusion.', '144\\u2003To recapitulate, I find that Mr Ong explained the key features of the Guarantee in both English and Mandarin to the second defendant in a \u201cproper\u201d manner that would have duly informed him of the consequences of the Guarantee he was signing. This is not inconsistent with my earlier finding that the Loan Agreement is a sham as the plaintiff would have sought to clothe the Guarantee with legitimacy by ensuring it was formally and appropriately executed (see [43] above).', '145\\u2003In light of the expert evidence, Mr Ong\u2019s explanations and the exceptional nature of the non est factum doctrine, I am not satisfied that the second defendant\u2019s ability to understand the Guarantee was impeded to the extent required under Saunders (see [109] and [112] above).', '146\\u2003In fact, the second defendant\u2019s Mental Capacity Affidavit affirmed on 7 July 2017 casts further doubt on his assertion that he misunderstood or was unable to understand the Guarantee, especially given Mr Fernandez\u2019s testimony that he drafted the Mental Capacity Affidavit on the second defendant\u2019s instructions (see [95] and [96] above). I also stress that the Mental Capacity Affidavit was withheld by the second defendant until less than a week before trial (see [95] above). 163', '147\\u2003While the Mental Capacity Affidavit does not make direct reference to the Guarantee, the following two paragraphs reveal an awareness that he is personally liable to repay the Loan: 164', '148\\u2003In these premises, I reject the second defendant\u2019s contention that the present facts of this case are on all fours with Ford, where a plea of non est factum succeeded because the mortgagor there could not have understood the nature of the documents he was signing due to his intellectual impairment (Ford at [90]). 165', 'The most crucial difference is that the mortgagor in Ford (at [85]):', '149\\u2003It bears emphasising that Professor Kua accepted the probability of the second defendant understanding the documents despite having found that the second defendant was mentally incapacitated in his 2017 and 2019 reports (see [115] above). In the same vein, it is implicit from Lord Reid\u2019s statement of the law in Saunders (see [109] above) that mental incapacity does not necessarily establish a plea of non est factum. Lord Pearson appears to have made the same point by pronouncing on the degree to which one\u2019s ability to understand the document signed must be impaired by \u201cpermanent or temporary reasons (not limited to blindness or illiteracy)\u201d (see [112] above) before a plea of non est factum will succeed. Indeed, the distinction between the defences of mental incapacity and non est factum should be maintained so as not to render the former otiose. It is therefore clear that the Family Justice Court\u2019s order declaring the second defendant mentally incapacitated on 30 October 2017 does not preclude a finding that he was able to understand the Guarantee sufficiently on 22 June 2017.', '150\\u2003For completeness, I did not take into consideration the reports of Dr Tan and Dr Leong, which both certified the second defendant as possessing mental capacity, when arriving at my decision on this issue as they are inadmissible hearsay evidence.', '151\\u2003Parties who seek to invoke non est factum on the basis of their innate incapacity, illness or defective education must still take \u201csuch precautions as they reasonably can\u201d (Saunders at 1016). Given my conclusion in respect of the first element, it is unnecessary for me to make a finding in respect of this second element of non est factum. Suffice to say that it does not go in the second defendant\u2019s favour that he failed to obtain independent advice on the Guarantee before signing it, despite his appointment of counsel for other affairs such as the replacement of the title deeds of the Rangoon Road Property, sale of the Rangoon Road Property, or challenging his family\u2019s MCA application (ie, FC\/OSM 214\/2017) and applying to set aside an interim injunction prohibiting the sale of the Rangoon Road Property. 166'"}

Mr H\u2019s mother, Ms Y, was then in a romantic relationship with the accused. The offences forming the subject-matter of the seven charges involving the victim all took place on the night of 24 October 2017 sometime between 9.01 pm and 10.59 pm at Kallang Riverside Park (\u201cthe Park\u201d).', '4\\u2003The victim was a virgin prior to the offences.

The victim was in great pain but she managed to send voice messages via WhatsApp to various persons pleading for help and informing them that she had been raped. The accused returned to the Park later when the victim was still lying on the ground. He again threatened her not to tell anybody before leaving once more.', '6\\u2003Mr H, together with three of the victim\u2019s friends, managed to locate her at the Park. The victim\u2019s grandparents arrived soon after and called the police. It was at this point when Mr H asked his mother (Ms Y) to go to the Park as the victim had identified the accused as her attacker. The accused had run into the search party briefly, but had subsequently returned to Ms Y\u2019s flat. Dressed in different clothes, he accompanied Ms Y to the Park, where they saw the victim together with her friends and her grandparents. The victim\u2019s grandfather had called the police to report the incident. The victim again identified the accused as her rapist before the police arrived. He denied raping her and threatened the victim\u2019s grandmother, stating that if anything were to happen to him, he would find the victim\u2019s family and harm her (ie. the victim\u2019s grandmother). He fled the scene when he saw two police officers arriving.', '7\\u2003The police arrived at Ms Y\u2019s flat at about 5.00 am on 25 October 2017. They found the accused hiding in a cupboard in a locked bedroom and placed him under arrest. He attempted to mislead the police by claiming he was wearing different clothes, so that the police would be unable to conduct CCTV screenings and forensic testing of his clothes. When interviewed, the accused lied that he was looking for Ms Y at the Park and had never met with the victim that night. A year later, the accused changed his story, claiming that the victim came onto him and requested for sex, and they only had consensual penile-vaginal intercourse and that he had never employed force on her.', '8\\u2003The victim was assessed to clearly have symptoms of trauma. She informed Dr Parvathy Pathy of the Child Guidance Clinic that she had flashbacks of the incident when she watched movies with rape scenes. She also stated that she did not want to see the accused in court as it would \u201churt\u201d her too much. She was unable to sleep well at night and had nightmares of the incident with the accused and she would cry when she woke up from the nightmares. The victim was fearful of going out alone and seeing male strangers and she could only go out with her family members.', '9\\u2003The accused was examined by Dr Tan Ming Yee Giles (\u201cDr Tan\u201d) of the Institute of Mental Health (\u201cIMH\u201d) on 14, 15 and 17 November 2017.

He was not of unsound mind at the time of the offences, and he was assessed to be fit to plead in court.', '10\\u2003In his report, Dr Tan reproduced the accused\u2019s account of the offences, where the accused denied committing the offence and claimed that he never saw the victim at all on the day of the offences until he went to the Park with Ms Y.'"}

Since their marriage, the couple have lived at the Flat \nwith the first defendant\u2019s parents and now with the second defendant after the \nfirst defendant\u2019s mother passed away.\n5 The plaintiff deposed that the defendants co-owned the Flat and she was \napplying for a division of the first defendant\u2019s 50% share in the Flat. The Flat is \nworth $540,000 (according to the plaintiff\u2019s searches on HDB\u2019s record of \ntransacted prices as of 9 August 2020).  \n6 The plaintiff pointed out that the second defendant claimed he had used \nhis Central Provident Fund (\u201cCPF\u201d) contributions to pay for the outstanding \nmortgage loan.

On 17 April 2010, the first defendant\u2019s name was \nincluded as a joint tenant of the Flat by way of a gift from his parents. Following \nthe demise of the first defendant\u2019s mother in 2016, her interest in the Flat \ndevolved to the defendants under the right of survivorship. \n8 The plaintiff deposed that apart from the use of the first defendant\u2019s CPF \nsavings to meet the initial down-payment of the Flat, the first defendant made \nno other payments for the Flat as the monthly mortgage instalments thereafter \nwere serviced by the second defendant using his CPF contributions.\n9 The plaintiff disclosed that the second defendant is employed by the first \ndefendant as a driver at the latter\u2019s company after the second defendant was \nretrenched from his last job. She had reason to believe that the CPF \ncontributions utilised in servicing the monthly mortgage instalments were paid \nby the first defendant. \n10 Consequently, the plaintiff was of the view that the first defendant has \nan equal share in the Flat as the second defendant and she wanted the court to \ngrant the declaratory relief she claimed in the Application.\n11 The defendants not unexpectedly objected to the Application.

Here, the court has to \nundertake a fact-finding process whereby evidence from both sides must be \ntendered to determine the ownership of the Flat. \n13 The defendants submitted that the Application is a frivolous and \nvexatious exercise. The plaintiff\u2019s argument was that because the first defendant \nemploys the second defendant and pays him a salary, the former is indirectly \ncontributing towards the monthly mortgage instalments of the Flat made by the \nlatter.  Therefore, the first defendant owns a 50% share in the Flat. \n14 They pointed out that if the plaintiff\u2019s argument is taken to its logical \nconclusion, it would mean that all employers who make CPF contributions for \ntheir employees would own a share in their employees\u2019 house or other \nproperties.

The two sums added up \nto $1,942.28.   Accounting for slight variations from month-to-month, the \ncourt\u2019s calculations show that the contributions made by the first defendant to \nthe second defendant\u2019s CPF ordinary account for the period May 2017 to \nDecember 2018 only totalled $1,266.86 and from January 2019 to June 2020, \nthe total was $422.76.

Instead, she is asking the court to impute an equal share \nor 50% to the first defendant, of which she wants a share in the division of the \ncouple\u2019s matrimonial assets. The defendants pointed out that apart from her bare \nassertion, the plaintiff had provided no evidence or justification in support of \nher claim.\n19 Assuming arguendo the plaintiff\u2019s argument is correct, the defendants \ntotalled up the first defendant\u2019s down-payment of $22,674.28 towards the Flat \nand his contributions of $1,942.28 to the second defendant\u2019s CPF ordinary \naccount. The sums added up to $24,616.56. However, the second defendant \npays $549 every month for the Flat through his ordinary account. He had \ncontributed $514,713.39 (inclusive of interest) towards the purchase of the Flat \nas seen in his CPF statement4 that the defendants produced. The defendants \ntherefore argued that the plaintiff\u2019s contention that the first defendant has 50% \ninterest in the Flat unsustainable. They asserted that his share, based on his \ncontributions, equates to only 4.26% of the Flat.  \n20 As for the plaintiff\u2019s alternative claim in the Application, namely, that \nthat the second defendant holds 50% of the beneficial interest in the Flat for the \nfirst defendant, she had provided no evidence as to how the trust came into \nexistence, apart from her bare assertion. In any case, under s 51(8) of the \n4 At exhibit MWSK-1 pg 1\nVersion No 1: 27 May 2021 (15:37 hrs)\nSomwonkwan Sharinrat v \nWong Hong Sang Maurice and anor[2021] SGHC 127\n7Housing and Development Act (Cap 129, 2004 Rev Ed) (\u201cHDA\u201d), any trust to \nbe created over HDB property requires the consent of the HDB.  \n21 Consequently, the defendants urged the court to dismiss the Application.\n22 The plaintiff filed two further affidavits before the hearing of the \nApplication. \n23 In her affidavit filed on 20 October 2020 (\u201cthe plaintiff\u2019s second \naffidavit\u201d), the plaintiff deposed to her marital woes which with respect, are \nirrelevant to this matter. She asserted5 that the first defendant had \u201cdeliberately \ncoined a situation\u201d of getting the second defendant to work for him, draw a \nsalary and pay for the mortgage through the second defendant\u2019s CPF \ncontributions but chose not to pay himself a regular salary with CPF \ncontributions. \n24 She claimed that the whole intention to include the first defendant as an \nowner of the Flat was because the second defendant and his wife could not \nafford to pay for the mortgage and had fallen into arrears. Yet, after he became \na co-owner, the first defendant made no contribution towards the Flat except for \nthe lump sum payment set out in [6] and [19] above. She alleged that after the \nfirst defendant became a co-owner, his and the second defendant\u2019s situations \nchanged. The second defendant could afford to pay the monthly mortgage \ninstalment from the salary he received from the first defendant whereas the first \ndefendant was unable to service the housing loan anymore. She alleged there \n5 In para 7\nVersion No 1: 27 May 2021 (15:37 hrs)\nSomwonkwan Sharinrat v \nWong Hong Sang Maurice and anor[2021] SGHC 127\n8was thus a family conspiracy to deprive her of her rightful share and interest in \nthe Flat. \n25 The plaintiff asserted that the burden of proof was on the defendants not \nher, to show that they are holding the Flat in unequal shares. She requested that \nthe striking out application be dismissed.\n26 In her third affidavit filed on 15 December 2020 (\u201cthe plaintiff\u2019s third \naffidavit\u201d), the plaintiff repeated her assertions in her first affidavit as set out at \n[7] above on the first defendant\u2019s parents giving him a share in the Flat out of \nnatural love and affection. \n27 She disagreed with the defendants\u2019 computation of the first defendant\u2019s \ninterest in the Flat being only 4.26%. She was not privy to the defendants\u2019 \nfamily arrangement but was certain that the loan repayment arrangement was to \ndeprive her of her rightful share in the Flat in the event the first defendant \ndivorced her. She alleged that he had told her repeatedly during their marriage \nthat he would make sure she would not get a share of the Flat if ever they \ndivorced.\n28 The plaintiff asserted that in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the \ndefendants were named in the title deed of the Flat as joint tenants \u2013 that meant \nthat they hold the Flat in equal shares, unlike a tenancy-in-common where \nshareholdings can be unequal. \nVersion No 1: 27 May 2021 (15:37 hrs)\nSomwonkwan Sharinrat v \nWong Hong Sang Maurice and anor[2021] SGHC 127\n9The submissions\n(i)The plaintiff\u2019s arguments \n29 In support of the Application, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel cited ss 53(5) and \n53(6) of the Land Titles Act (Cap 157, 2004 Rev Ed) (\u201cLTA\u201d) which state:\n(5)  Without prejudice to any rule or principle of law relating to \nseverance of a joint tenancy, any joint tenant may sever a joint \ntenancy of an estate or interest in registered land by an \ninstrument of declaration in the approved form and by serving \na copy of the instrument of declaration personally or by \nregistered post on the other joint tenants.\n(6)  Upon the registration of the instrument of declaration \nwhich has been duly served as required by subsection (5), the \nrespective registered estates and interests in the registered land \nshall be held by the declarant as tenant-in-common with the \nremaining joint tenants, and the declarant shall be deemed to \nhold a share that is equal in proportion to each of the remaining \njoint tenants as if each and every one of them had held the \nregistered land as tenants-in-common in equal shares prior to \nthe severance.\nShe pointed out that the defendants could have but did not sever their joint \ntenancy of the Flat. Therefore, they held the Flat in equal shares. \n30 Even if the defendants had severed their joint tenancy in the Flat, it \nwould still have resulted in the first defendant holding 50% in the Flat due to \nthe operation of s 53(6) of the LTA set out above. There could not have been a \ntrust created with the first defendant holding his interest in the Flat on trust for \nthe second defendant, due to s 51(8) of the HDA which states:\nNo trust in respect of any protected property shall be created \nby the owner thereof without the prior written approval of the \nBoard.\nVersion No 1: 27 May 2021 (15:37 hrs)\nSomwonkwan Sharinrat v \nWong Hong Sang Maurice and anor[2021] SGHC 127\n10Consequently, the plaintiff submitted that the first defendant held a 50% share \nin the Flat.\n31  The plaintiff\u2019s counsel cited certain cases in support of her client\u2019s \narguments. The cases included Calverley v Green (1984) 155 CLR 242 \n(\u201cCalverley v Green\u201d) and Lau Siew Kim v Yeo Guan Chye Terence [2008] 2 \nSLR(R) 108 (\u201cLau Siew Kim\u201d) as well as the defendants\u2019 authority Damodaran \ns\/o Subbarayan v Rogini w\/o Subbarayan [2020] 5 SLR 1409 (\u201cDamodaran\u201d). \nThe court will return to these authorities later.\n(ii) The defendants\u2019 arguments \n32 The defendants submitted that the Flat is valued at $430,000 as at 30 \nJune 2020 and it has an outstanding mortgage of $46,476.83.\n33 The defendants criticised the plaintiff\u2019s claim as being fanciful and \nentirely without substance. They contended that there is no evidence of an \nexpress or an inferred common intention that the parties should hold the \nbeneficial interest in the Flat in a proportion different from their contributions. \nAs such, the court may not impute a common intention where one did not in fact \nexist.

{"casename":"2021_SGHC_13","fact":"'9\\u2003A significant portion of the facts were undisputed at trial and are set out in the ASOF. The facts set out below comprise not only those in the ASOF, but also the facts asserted in portions of the accused\u2019s evidence (either in his testimony or recorded statements) that have not been challenged by either party.', '10\\u2003Prior to and at the time of the offences, the accused, Pei Shan and Zi Ning resided at Block 619 Woodlands Drive 52, #06-64, Singapore (\u201cthe flat\u201d). The accused was the sole breadwinner of the family. He was a committed husband and father. The accused had been previously working as a property agent for over a decade. He performed well as a property agent and was financially stable. Between 2013 and 2015, he held the position of Divisional Director at two different real estate companies. According to the accused, he had been drawing a five-figure monthly salary.', '11\\u2003In 2015, the accused\u2019s income declined significantly principally because of a downturn in the property market. His family\u2019s expenses, however, did not suffer a corresponding decline. These expenses remained high and well beyond the accused\u2019s income. The accused had to dip into his savings to meet the expenses. Unable to sustain a meaningful income as a property agent, the accused decided to switch employment. By this time, he had resorted to borrowing from friends, colleagues and various financial institutions, and was heavily in debt.', '12\\u2003In October 2016, a friend, Lim Zi Jian, Jordan (\u201cMr Jordan Lim\u201d), introduced the accused to Carpentry Design Works Pte Ltd (\u201cCDW\u201d). Mr Jordan Lim was a sales manager at CDW. The accused was offered employment by CDW as a sales coordinator at a monthly salary of about $1,500. He accepted the offer and worked under the supervision of Mr Jordan Lim. The accused was a conscientious and committed employee and was well regarded, both professionally and personally, by his colleagues and superiors. Mr Jordan Lim described his attitude as \u201cvery good\u201d; Mdm Husniyati binte Omar (\u201cMdm Husniyati\u201d, also known as \u201cSharlyn\u201d), the accused\u2019s director at CDW, described him as \u201creliable\u201d and \u201cvery hardworking\u201d. The accused kept a consistent and rigorous work schedule, the details of which I will elaborate upon later in these grounds (see [164] below). The accused was working at CDW at the time of the offences.', '13\\u2003However, the accused\u2019s income at CDW was wholly insufficient to sustain the accused\u2019s family expenses, and his financial situation continued to deteriorate. He struggled to pay Zi Ning\u2019s school fees. Also, the accused resorted to gambling which became habitual. By the end of 2016, the accused owed some $120,000 to various creditors. He even listed the flat for sale and made plans to sell his car.', '14\\u2003Creditors demanded payment from the accused and on one occasion, on 13 January 2017, a former colleague, Dickson Pang Choon Chuang (\u201cMr Dickson Pang\u201d), turned up at the flat, albeit at the invitation of the accused, to discuss settlement of the debt owed to him. This sparked heated arguments between the accused and Pei Shan over the family\u2019s finances. There were also arguments with Pei Shan over transferring Zi Ning to a less expensive school and Pei Shan\u2019s refusal to take up employment to ameliorate the family\u2019s financial difficulties.', '15\\u2003On the evening of 18 January 2017, the accused and Pei Shan had another argument over the state of the family\u2019s finances. The accused informed Pei Shan that he was $70,000 in debt, and was unable to pay Zi Ning\u2019s school fees. Also, he felt pressured because the Lunar New Year was approaching, and his friends were pressing him for repayment of his debts. He again asked Pei Shan to look for part-time employment to help with the family\u2019s expenses. According to the accused, upon hearing this, Pei Shan \u201chit the roof\u201d. Harsh words were exchanged. During this fight, in anger, the accused brought up Pei Shan\u2019s extra-marital affair with one Mark Mu which allegedly occurred in October 2014. The couple fought for a while, after which they smoked cigarettes before going to bed for the night.', '16\\u2003The next day, 19 January 2017, the accused received a text message from the principal of the school that Zi Ning attended. The principal requested payment of overdue school fees amounting to about $1,700. The accused felt \u201cvery vexed\u201d by this as he did not have the money to pay the overdue fees. This was not the first time that the accused had received such messages from the principal.', '17\\u2003The next day, 20 January 2017, at about 8.00am, the accused and Pei Shan were readying Zi Ning for school. All three of them were in the master bedroom. Zi Ning had put on her school uniform. As the accused was unable to pay the overdue school fees, he told Zi Ning to change out of her school uniform and into her home clothes. He switched on the television in the master bedroom and told Zi Ning to \u201cwatch TV\u201d. Pei Shan, who was sitting at the edge of the bed in the room, asked the accused why Zi Ning was not going to school. He told Pei Shan that he \u201c[did not] have the money to pay [Zi Ning\u2019s] overdue school fees\u201d. He feared that if Zi Ning were to go to school, she might be asked to leave, which would be \u201cvery embarrassing\u201d and \u201c[s]hameful\u201d. This again sparked a heated argument between the accused and Pei Shan over the family\u2019s financial situation.', '18\\u2003The accused described Pei Shan as \u201csuper angry\u201d. The accused claimed that Pei Shan had scolded him and \u201c[said] that [he] was a useless father and husband\u201d. The last thing he recalled Pei Shan saying (in Mandarin) was, \u201c[Zi Ning], look at how useless your father is!\u201d The accused found Pei Shan\u2019s words very \u201csarcastic and hurtful\u201d. He found the words hurtful and degrading. He testified that he had warned Pei Shan several times in the past not to belittle him in front of his daughter. The accused became \u201cvery agitated\u201d and his mind \u201cwent blank\u201d.', '19\\u2003As Pei Shan continued scolding him, the accused walked to the en suite bathroom of the master bedroom. There, he retrieved a bath towel and held it in his right hand. He walked up to Pei Shan, who remained seated at the edge of the bed, and stood in front of her. He looped the bath towel around her neck \u201cquite quickly and did not give her much time to react\u201d, and pulled it tightly at the ends forming a tight noose. In his long statement dated 3 February 2017, the accused said that when Pei Shan attempted to pull the bath towel away from her neck, he \u201cpulled with all [his] might and overpowered her\u201d. In his long statement dated 9 February 2017, the accused said that five minutes into strangling Pei Shan, his mind cleared, and he asked himself whether he should stop. He then decided to continue strangling her as he did not want Pei Shan to be saddled with his debts.', '20\\u2003The accused released his grip on the bath towel after strangling Pei Shan for about 15 minutes. He observed that she was breathing faintly and that bubbles had formed around her lips. The accused wanted to ensure that Pei Shan was dead. Thus, he removed the bath towel from around Pei Shan\u2019s neck, and proceeded to strangle her with his hands. The accused strangled her \u201cfor about ten to 15 minutes\u201d. While he was strangling Pei Shan with his hands, the accused spoke to her in Mandarin telling her to \u201cleave first\u201d, and that he and Zi Ning would \u201cjoin [her] shortly\u201d. In his long statement dated 3 February 2017, he said that at this point, he had \u201cthe intention of killing his entire family\u201d. As Pei Shan was being strangled, Zi Ning remained in the master bedroom playing with her toys and watching television. She did not appear to be aware of what was going on. The accused continued strangling Pei Shan until she stopped breathing completely and was motionless. He then moved Pei Shan\u2019s body further up the bed (as she had been lying on the edge of the bed) and rested her head on a pillow.', '21\\u2003The accused then turned his attention to Zi Ning. He reflected on Zi Ning\u2019s situation. After some deliberation, he decided that it would be best to take Zi Ning\u2019s life as well. He rationalised that with her parents gone, Zi Ning would have no one to take care of her.', '22\\u2003The accused sat down on the bed close to Zi Ning. He asked her to sit in front of him, with her back facing him \u2013 she complied. He then looped the same bath towel around Zi Ning\u2019s neck. He pulled it tight \u201cwith all [his] strength\u201d. As Zi Ning struggled \u201cfuriously\u201d, he repeatedly told her to \u201cleave first\u201d, that Pei Shan had \u201cleft already\u201d and that he would \u201cjoin [them] shortly\u201d. After about ten to 15 minutes, the accused felt Zi Ning\u2019s body go limp, and released the bath towel.', '23\\u2003The accused observed that Zi Ning was breathing faintly and \u201cwanted to end her life\u201d. He retrieved Zi Ning\u2019s pillow from her bed and rested her head on it. He then strangled her with his hands \u201cfor a short while\u201d until she stopped breathing and became motionless. The accused spoke to Zi Ning in Mandarin as he was strangling her. He told her \u201c[y]ou have to go\u2026 Daddy will join you shortly\u201d. The accused then left Pei Shan\u2019s and Zi Ning\u2019s bodies on the bed and went to the study to have a cigarette.', '24\\u2003Following the commission of the offences, on the same day, the accused attempted suicide by slitting his wrists but did not succeed. The cuts did not seem deep enough as the accused stopped bleeding \u201cafter about 15 to 20 minutes\u201d and his wounds were \u201cscabbing over\u201d by then. He then decided to commit suicide by consuming \u201cmany pills of Panadol\u201d (ie, paracetamol). He left the flat to buy Panadol pills as well as his lunch. He returned with 20 Panadol pills and his lunch. He consumed the pills later in the day (see [27] below).', '25\\u2003In order to evade his debtors, the accused used Pei Shan\u2019s handphone instead of his own. Also, the accused recalled receiving what appeared to be a text message from Zi Ning\u2019s teacher, who asked why Zi Ning did not attend school. He replied, using Pei Shan\u2019s handphone, that Zi Ning was unwell. He claimed that he did so because he \u201cdid not want [his] wife and daughter to be discovered dead before [he] had committed suicide successfully\u201d.', '26\\u2003Later that day, the accused drafted several suicide notes. He prepared a total of four handwritten notes (collectively, the \u201csuicide notes\u201d), which were seized upon his arrest and marked \u201cWDL-W001\u201d to \u201cWDL-W004\u201d respectively. The accused claimed in his long statement dated 3 February 2017 that he wrote a \u201cfew notes\u201d addressed to his parents and Pei Shan\u2019s parents, which broadly pertained to how Pei Shan\u2019s and his assets were to be divided after their deaths. He also wrote a note to Pei Shan\u2019s father \u201cposing as [Pei Shan]\u201d. It is important to note that the suicide notes either asserted or suggested that Pei Shan and the accused had agreed to commit suicide after taking Zi Ning\u2019s life. In other words, the suicide notes conveyed the impression that there was a suicide pact between the accused and Pei Shan.', '27\\u2003After writing the suicide notes, the accused consumed the 20 Panadol pills he had bought. He then lay on the bed in the master bedroom, next to Pei Shan\u2019s and Zi Ning\u2019s bodies. He claimed that he felt \u201cgroggy\u201d, and expected not to wake up. However, this suicide attempt was also not successful.', '28\\u2003The next day, 21 January 2017, the accused woke up sometime between 7.00am and 9.00am next to Pei Shan\u2019s and Zi Ning\u2019s bodies. The accused in fact continued sleeping next to Pei Shan\u2019s and Zi Ning\u2019s bodies daily until he was arrested on 28 January 2017. He said that in the days that followed (until his arrest), he \u201cmade sure that [the bodies of Pei Shan and Zi Ning] were kept in the master bedroom where the air-conditioning was switched on\u201d. He did so partly \u201cout of habit\u201d, and partly because he did not want their bodies to decompose.', '29\\u2003Between 21 January and 27 January 2017, the accused claimed that he attempted or intended to commit suicide on several occasions:', '(a)\\u2003On the morning of 21 January 2017, the accused hoped to commit suicide by consuming rat poison. However, he was unable to obtain rat poison from the shops he visited and returned home empty-handed. The accused claimed that on the same day, he \u201cresolv[ed] to commit suicide by jumping to [his] death\u201d the next day. He eventually did not do so.', '(b)\\u2003On 24 January 2017, he contemplated jumping out of his kitchen window but did not have the courage to do so. He claimed he thought of postponing it to the next day but made no attempt then either.', '(c)\\u2003On 25 January 2017, he attempted suicide by consuming 105 Panadol tablets. He felt nauseous and vomited.', '(d)\\u2003On 26 January 2017, he attempted suicide by slitting his left wrist with a penknife but failed to kill himself. On the same day, he mixed a large quantity of insecticide with water and drank the mixture. He suffered from an upset stomach and diarrhoea.', '30\\u2003During this period, various persons were looking for the accused, Pei Shan and\/or Zi Ning. Many reached out through Pei Shan\u2019s handphone and the accused responded. The accused made up multiple excuses to explain why he and his family were busy or uncontactable. He allegedly did so because he did not want Pei Shan\u2019s and Zi Ning\u2019s bodies to be discovered before he had succeeded in committing suicide. In addition to the incident involving Zi Ning\u2019s teacher (see [25] above), there were other instances of questionable conduct by the accused.

He replied saying that Zi Ning was not feeling well, and would not be going to school until 25 January 2017. At about 2.00pm on the same day, three of the accused\u2019s colleagues including Mr Jordan Lim and the accused\u2019s director, Mdm Husniyati, arrived at the flat to look for him. From outside the flat, Mdm Husniyati shouted for the accused. The accused recognised his colleagues\u2019 voices. In order to avoid detection, he lowered the television volume and remained silent. Before leaving, one of the accused\u2019s colleagues tripped the main power switch outside the flat in a bid to lure the accused out. The accused did not fall for this. As there was no response from inside the flat, Mdm Husniyati left her name card with the accused\u2019s neighbours.', '(d)\\u2003On 24 January 2017, the accused received WhatsApp messages on Pei Shan\u2019s handphone from Ms Fai, the principal of the school Zi Ning attended, and one of Zi Ning\u2019s teachers. They wanted to inform Pei Shan of matters to note in anticipation of Zi Ning\u2019s return to school the next day. There was also a WhatsApp message from Pei Shan\u2019s brother, Choong Mun Chen (\u201cGordon\u201d). Gordon sent the message to remind Pei Shan of the Lunar New Year reunion dinner that Friday (27 January 2017).

The accused\u2019s brother called Pei Shan on her handphone at about 5.00pm that day to ask what time they would arrive for the dinner at 8.00pm. The accused answered and said they would not be joining. He promised to update his family (ie, the accused\u2019s family) later on the details. At about 7.30pm, he called Gordon and lied to him that Pei Shan was not feeling well and that he would be sending her to the hospital. The accused also lied that Zi Ning would be spending the night at his sister\u2019s place. At about 8.30pm, he called Gordon again and informed him that Pei Shan was resting in the hospital. He then called Pei Shan\u2019s mother to convey the same. He did so \u201c[e]ven though [Gordon] and [Pei Shan\u2019s mother] were together at the same dinner\u201d, because he \u201cdid not want [Pei Shan\u2019s] parents to be overly worried and come visit [him] at [the flat]\u201d.

He left the flat to buy food or substances for the purpose of committing suicide.', '32\\u2003On the first day of the Lunar New Year (28 January 2017), the accused\u2019s in-laws were looking for him and his family. The accused received two phone calls from Gordon. He wanted to know when the accused and his family would be visiting his in-laws\u2019 house. The accused informed Gordon that Pei Shan was showering and \u201ccould not come to the phone\u201d, and that they would reach his in-laws\u2019 house at about 11.00am. By this time, the accused was feeling tremendous pressure as he felt that he \u201ccould no longer hide the fact that [he] had killed [his] wife and daughter\u201d. He resolved to burn the bodies of Pei Shan and Zi Ning and immolate himself in the process. He lay next to Pei Shan\u2019s and Zi Ning\u2019s bodies, poured thinner on the blanket, covered himself and them with it and set it on fire. However, after lying under the blanket for \u201cabout 5 seconds\u201d, the accused \u201c[found] the heat unbearable\u201d and rushed out of the master bedroom. He then left the flat and drove to Sembawang Beach planning to drown himself in the sea, but did not do so.', '33\\u2003At about 3.30pm that day, the accused returned to the block where the flat was located. He kept a look out for the police and officers from the Singapore Civil Defence Force (\u201cthe SCDF\u201d) as he thought that they might have turned up at the flat in light of the fire that he had started. He did not spot any police or SCDF officers. The accused used the payphone at the void deck of the block to make calls to his mother and Pei Shan\u2019s mother. He told them that as a result of an argument between Pei Shan and him, he had been chased out of the flat. He said that the lie was his \u201cexcuse to explain why [he] did not visit them\u201d. He explained in the 5 February 2017 long statement that by lying he hoped \u201cto buy [himself] more time to think about what to do next\u201d, and to avoid a situation where his mother and mother-in-law would turn up at the flat. The accused returned to the flat shortly after making the calls from the payphone. He found that the flat was very smoky. He sprayed air freshener in the master bedroom and living room before going to the study to smoke.', '34\\u2003At about 6.30pm, Gordon visited the flat, accompanied by his brother-in-law. They rang the doorbell, knocked on the door and windows, and shouted for the family. The accused did not respond. Gordon forced open one of the windows to the flat and noticed a pungent odour. He called the police and reported smelling gas from inside the flat. A short while later, the police and officers from the SCDF arrived. The police officers shouted out to the accused and told him that if he did not open the door, they would enter the flat by force. Just as the SCDF officers were about to force an entry, the accused opened the door. At the insistence of the police officers, he unlocked the metal gate of the flat. The accused then stepped out of the flat, approached Gordon and told him in a calm and soft voice that Pei Shan was dead. He then dashed past Gordon but was apprehended by him, and the police and SCDF officers present.', '35\\u2003One of the police officers, Sergeant Jonathan Low Jin Hua (\u201cSgt Jonathan\u201d), asked the accused what had happened. The accused replied that \u201c[i]t was my fault.\u201d The SCDF officers who entered the flat identified a charred body in the master bedroom. Another police officer, Senior Staff Sergeant Nur Farhana binte Mohamad Nasir (\u201cSSSgt Farhana\u201d), also confirmed the presence of a charred body in the master bedroom of the flat. However, when the accused informed her that he had set fire to the bodies of Pei Shan and Zi Ning earlier in the day, she realised that there were in fact two charred bodies in the master bedroom, which she then confirmed. She placed the accused under arrest for murder.', '36\\u2003Shortly after the accused\u2019s arrest, Assistant Superintendent Ravindra s\/o Subramaniam (\u201cASP Ravindra\u201d) from the Special Investigation Section of the police arrived at the flat. ASP Ravindra asked the accused to show him around the flat. The accused pointed ASP Ravindra to a handwritten suicide note, which was placed on the bedside drawer in the master bedroom. The accused told ASP Ravindra that the suicide note had been written by Pei Shan and was addressed to Pei Shan\u2019s father. The accused then pointed ASP Ravindra to three further handwritten suicide notes in the study, which he claimed were written by Pei Shan and him. These four notes collectively were the suicide notes forged by the accused (see [26] above). The suicide notes were seized and sent for forensic analysis.', '37\\u2003After his arrest, the accused was warded at Changi General Hospital (\u201cCGH\u201d).

The relevant portions of his autopsy reports were admitted into evidence through the ASOF.', '41\\u2003Dr Paul certified Pei Shan\u2019s cause of death as \u201cstrangulation\u201d. He observed multiple injuries on Pei Shan\u2019s neck and near her jaw. His view was that the burns on Pei Shan\u2019s body were inflicted post-mortem. Based on his observations, he concluded that Pei Shan\u2019s external injuries and the injuries to her neck structures within were a result of strangulation, and were sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature.', '42\\u2003Dr Paul also observed that the foetus in Pei Shan\u2019s uterus, which was of a gestational age of a little more than six months, was non-viable and its cause of death was the death of the mother.', '43\\u2003Dr Paul certified Zi Ning\u2019s cause of death as \u201cconsistent with smothering\u201d. He observed multiple injuries on her neck and near her jaw, and was of the view that this was suggestive of smothering. He was of the further view that Zi Ning\u2019s body showed advanced decomposition and post-mortem burn injuries. Based on this, he concluded that the injuries to Zi Ning\u2019s lower face and neck region were representative of a blunt force being applied to those areas, and were sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature by smothering.'"}

The Opus Group is an offshore drilling contractor: it owns offshore drilling rigs, constructs and owns drill ships and provides offshore drilling services to the oil and gas industry. 12', '11\\u2003As its full name suggests (see [2] above), SHSY is a shipyard incorporated in and carrying on business in Shanghai in the People\u2019s Republic of China (\u201cthe PRC\u201d). 13', '12\\u2003The Opus Tiger Companies are wholly owned subsidiaries of OOL and are all incorporated in Singapore. 14', 'Each Opus Tiger Company exists for the sole purpose of owning a single drill ship to be built by SHSY. 15', 'Each Opus Tiger Company therefore has its own shipbuilding contract with SHSY (the \u201cContracts\u201d and each a \u201cContract\u201d) under which it was to pay SHSY a substantial sum of money in exchange for a drill ship to be constructed and delivered by SHSY.', '13\\u2003In February 2017, with Reignwood\u2019s support, the Supreme Court of Bermuda made an order winding up OOL and appointing joint provisional liquidators (\u201cthe JPLs\u201d). 16', '14\\u2003Each Opus Tiger Company is entirely dependent on OOL for funding. As a result of OOL\u2019s insolvency, the Opus Tiger Companies are therefore also themselves insolvent. 17', 'Unlike OOL, the Opus Tiger Companies are not subject to any formal insolvency proceedings. But the JPLs have taken direct control of the Opus Tiger Companies by appointing their nominees to form a majority on each Opus Tiger Company\u2019s board.', '15\\u2003OOL\u2019s provisional liquidation is a light-touch provisional liquidation under Bermudan law (see In the Matter of Up Energy Development Group Limited and in the matter of the Companies Act 1981 [2016] SC (Bda) 83 Com (20 September 2016) and In the Matter of Z-obee Holdings Limited [2017] SC (Bda) 16 Com (21 February 2017)). The JPLs were therefore not appointed to liquidate OOL and its subsidiaries. The JPLs were instead appointed to take advantage of the moratorium against creditor action which OOL now enjoys in order to restructure OOL and the Opus Group\u2019s debts and business, and thereby to achieve an enhanced return for creditors. 18', '16\\u2003Soon after their appointment in February 2017, therefore, the JPLs started negotiations with the creditors of OOL and of the Opus Group. These negotiations broke down in late 2018, in large part because SHSY and Reignwood could not agree how to treat SHSY\u2019s claim against OT1 (see [18]\u2013[20] below) in the Opus Group\u2019s restructuring. 19', '17\\u2003It is now necessary to move backwards in the chronology in order to describe the Contracts in more detail.', '18\\u2003The earliest and most advanced of the Contracts between SHSY and the Opus Tiger Companies is the one between SHSY and OT1. 20', 'The OT1 Contract obliged OT1 to pay SHSY the price of the drill ship in three instalments. 21', 'OT1 was obliged to pay the third and final instalment of US$170m to SHSY when SHSY delivered the drill ship. 22', '19\\u2003SHSY\u2019s position is that OT1 breached the Contract in late 2016 when it failed to pay SHSY the final instalment under the OT1 Contract and failed to take delivery of the drill ship.', '20\\u2003Accordingly, in December 2016, SHSY served a notice to complete on OT1. 23', 'In January 2017, while the winding up petition was pending against OOL, SHSY served a notice of default on OT1.

Indeed, Reignwood\u2019s case is that SHSY\u2019s purported termination of all four of the Contracts is itself a repudiatory breach of the Contracts for which SHSY is obliged to compensate the Opus Tiger Companies.', '25\\u2003None of this background is directly relevant to SHSY\u2019s four joinder applications which are now before me. But the background does shed light on the motivations of all those involved. In particular, the background explains the proliferation of litigation since late 2018. SHSY has commenced litigation against Reignwood in England (see [22]\u2013[23] above). Reignwood commenced these four s 216A applications against the Opus Tiger Companies in Singapore. Reignwood has commenced the derivative proceedings against SHSY pursuant to the leave I granted to Reignwood on the s 216A applications. The Opus Tiger Companies have filed four applications seeking directions on the scope of the leave I granted (see [34] below). SHSY has filed these four joinder applications. And SHSY has, with my leave, filed four appeals against my dismissal of its joinder applications.', '26\\u2003What is going on is, in effect, a battle between Reignwood (who is the single largest shareholder and claims to be a substantial creditor of OOL) 28', 'and SHSY (who claims to be OOL\u2019s single largest creditor) 29', 'for influence and advantage as to how the claims and crossclaims arising from the Contracts should be treated in OOL\u2019s insolvency and restructuring. 30', '27\\u2003Be that as it may, SHSY\u2019s joinder applications must be approached and will be determined only in the terms in which they have been presented to me: by applying the principles applicable to the joinder of parties to the specific context of an application under s 216A(2) of the Act.', '28\\u2003In May 2019, as I have mentioned, I made orders under s 216A granting Reignwood leave to commence derivative proceedings against SHSY. The derivative proceedings are four arbitrations in London against SHSY, one in the name of each Opus Tiger Company. The relief sought in each arbitration is damages against SHSY for its alleged repudiatory breaches of the Contracts. Given the insolvency of the Opus Tiger Companies, I made the s 216A orders on Reignwood\u2019s undertaking to bear the costs of the arbitrations. The undertaking covers not only the Opus Tiger Companies\u2019 legal costs in pursuing the arbitrations but also: (a) any costs awarded in SHSY\u2019s favour; and (b) the JPLs\u2019 costs of rendering support in the arbitrations, eg, by reviewing and collating the Opus Tiger Companies\u2019 documents for discovery. 31', '29\\u2003I made the s 216A orders even though Reignwood is not a shareholder of the Opus Tiger Companies. In doing so, I accepted Reignwood\u2019s submission that its status as a shareholder of OOL \u2013 being the sole shareholder of the Opus Tiger Companies \u2013 makes it a \u201cproper person\u201d within the meaning of s 216A(1)(c) to apply for a s 216A order against the Opus Tiger Companies (see Hans Tjio, Pearlie Koh & Lee Pey Woan, Corporate Law (Academy Publishing, 2015) at paras 10.042 to 10.043). 32', 'Thus, the arbitrations which I gave Reignwood leave to commence against SHSY are what are commonly called \u201cdouble derivative proceedings\u201d or \u201cmultiple derivative proceedings\u201d (see Universal Project Management Services Ltd v Fort Gilkicker Ltd and others [2013] Ch 551 at [25]).', '30\\u2003The deadline for the Opus Tiger Companies to appeal against the s 216A orders expired in June 2019. They did not appeal.', '31\\u2003In June 2019, under the authority of the s 216A orders, Reignwood started the first arbitration against SHSY in the name of OT1. In its demand for arbitration, 33', 'Reignwood claimed to exercise two of OT1\u2019s rights under or arising from the OT1 Contract: (a) it exercised OT1\u2019s right to accept what it characterised as SHSY\u2019s repudiatory breach of the OT1 Contract; and (b) it exercised OT1\u2019s right under the OT1 Contract to direct SHSY to send all future notices and other communications in respect of the OT1 Contract to Reignwood\u2019s English solicitors rather than to OT1.', '32\\u2003In August 2019, SHSY informed the Opus Tiger Companies that Reignwood\u2019s demand for arbitration against OT1 had purported to exercise OT1\u2019s rights in these two ways. SHSY suggested that the Opus Tiger Companies seek directions from the court as to whether the s 216A order in respect of OT1 permitted Reignwood to exercise these rights. 34', '33\\u2003In September 2019, Reignwood started the remaining three arbitrations against SHSY in the names of the remaining three Opus Tiger Companies. 35', 'In those demands for arbitration, Reignwood did not attempt to terminate the relevant Contract for repudiatory breach. Reignwood did, however, exercise the three Opus Tiger Companies\u2019 rights to direct SHSY to send all future notices and other communications in respect of those Contracts to Reignwood\u2019s English solicitors rather than to the relevant Opus Tiger Company.', '34\\u2003On 18 October 2019, the Opus Tiger Companies filed four applications seeking directions from the court as to whether the s 216A orders permitted Reignwood to exercise these rights on behalf of the Opus Tiger Companies. I shall refer to these applications as \u201cthe Directions Applications\u201d. 36', '35\\u2003On 31 October 2019, SHSY filed the four joinder applications which are now before me. SHSY\u2019s objective in applying to be joined as a party to the s 216A applications is twofold. Its immediate objective is to be heard on the Directions Applications. But its ultimate objective is to have the s 216A orders reversed and Reignwood\u2019s leave to commence the arbitrations revoked. 37', 'It intends to achieve this by applying for an extension of time to appeal against the s 216A orders and then by pursuing such an appeal.'"}

Copies of all the fully executed Written Agreements were then delivered to Ng who received them on behalf of Zheng. According to Looi, the Written Agreements were not dated with any specific date, as they were signed separately on different dates by the Plaintiff, Zheng, and Joseph Yeo. Nevertheless, the Plaintiff and Looi, who was called as a witness, insist that all five Written Agreements were fully executed at or around the same time, which was no later than 27 January 2014. 39', '27\\u2003Subsequently, the 1st and 2nd SPA were performed in a manner that was different than that stipulated under its terms. 40', 'The Plaintiff owned a company he controlled called Estelle Success Corp (\u201cEstelle\u201d), which owned 45,999,900 SGL shares. 41', 'In performance of the 1st SPA, the Plaintiff procured the transfer of his entire shareholding of Estelle to Zheng\u2019s nominee, Simson Kwok, at a price of S$2,555,550. 42', 'This arrangement granted Zheng the beneficial ownership of 45,999,900 SGL shares.

Between 2008 and 2014, whenever TNTPL\u2019s sales revenue exceeded $1 million, Lim, with the approval of the First Appellant, would falsely reduce TNTPL\u2019s report sales revenue, by transferring the revenue to three other business entities, one of which was TAS. For failing to report TNTPL\u2019s liability to register for Goods and Services Tax (\u201cGST\u201d), TNTPL had committed an offence under s 61(a) of the GSTA. At the time of the commission of the aforesaid offence, the First Appellant was a director of TNTPL and hence, the First Appellant had committed an offence under s 61(a) read with s 74 of the GSTA. The First Appellant was fined $2,000 for the offence under the GSTA and is not appealing that sentence.', '5\\u2003In addition to the above, in 2009 and 2011, the First Appellant agreed to Lim\u2019s false reduction of TAS\u2019s net profit, so that it would fall beneath an artificially-imposed cap of $100,000. This led to the under-reporting of the First Appellant\u2019s share of TAS\u2019s trade income. In addition, the First Appellant failed to declare holiday reimbursements received from TNTPL as a \u201cperformance reward\u201d. This led to the under-reporting of the First Appellant\u2019s employment income from TNTPL. The resulting amount of tax undercharged was $34,992.26 in 2009 and $34,444.18 in 2011. The mandatory penalties the First Appellant was liable for under s 96(1)(i) of the ITA were $104,976.78 and $103, 332.54 respectively.', '6\\u2003The First Appellant pleaded guilty to the two proceeded charges under s 96(1)(b) of the ITA as well as the s 61(a) GSTA charge and was sentenced on 20 July 2020. Six similar s 96(1) ITA charges were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. Through his nine offences, the First Appellant had evaded taxes totalling $221,938.01. At the proceedings below, the DJ observed that there was no consistency in the sentences imposed for s 96(1) ITA offences save that the sentences were always under two months\u2019 imprisonment. He also observed that there was little or no correlation between the amount of tax evaded and the sentences imposed for cases decided post-Chng Gim Huat, and that the current sentencing norm did not utilise the full sentencing spectrum provided for by Parliament, which in turn undermined the seriousness of s 96(1) ITA offences. The DJ held that Chng Gim Huat did not establish a sentencing benchmark of a short custodial sentence of up to two months for s 96(1) ITA offences, and proceeded to adopt the Prosecution\u2019s proposed five-step sentencing framework based on a harm-culpability analysis.', '7\\u2003The DJ found that the harm occasioned, and the culpability of the First Appellant came within the low range. Taking into account the First Appellant\u2019s plea of guilt and the six other charges taken into consideration, the DJ imposed a sentence of six weeks\u2019 imprisonment in respect of each proceeded charge, and ordered the sentences for the two charges to run consecutively, resulting in a global sentence of 12 weeks\u2019 imprisonment for the s 96(1) ITA offences.

From 2009 to 2015, one Lim Sai Cheok (\u201cLucy\u201d) prepared the accounts of both FCC and YHFT, and filed the income tax returns of FCC and YHFT, as well as the personal income tax returns of the Second Appellant. At the material times, whenever the actual sales figures of either FCC or YHFT exceeded the $1 million threshold for GST registration, the Second Appellant would instruct Lucy to reduce the reported sales to below the $1 million threshold. At the time of the commission of the aforesaid offences, the Second Appellant was a partner of FCC and YHFT and hence, the Second Appellant had committed an offence under s 61(a) read with s 74 of the GSTA. The Second Appellant was fined $4,000 for the offence under the GSTA and is not appealing that sentence.', '9\\u2003In addition to the above, by instructing Lucy to reduce the reported sales figures for FCC and YHFT to below the $1 million threshold, the Second Appellant\u2019s reported partnership income in 2016 was correspondingly reduced, leading to her personal income being under-reported. The resulting amount of tax undercharged was $79,142.13. The mandatory penalty the Second Appellant was liable for under s 96(1)(i) of the ITA was $237,426.39.', '10\\u2003The Second Appellant pleaded guilty to one proceeded charge under s 96(1)(b) of the ITA as well as the s 61(a) GSTA charge and was sentenced on 7 August 2020.

Further, SBS\u2019s employment practice was in breach of the Ministry of Manpower\u2019s (\u201cMOM\u201d) regulated pay rate that an employer is expected to pay for work done during an employee\u2019s rest day. 1', '5\\u2003Second, Chua was underpaid for overtime work and SBS had breached s 37(3) of the EA by failing to pay him the statutorily prescribed rate for working on a rest day, breached s 38(1) of the EA by imposing a mandatory \u201cbuilt-in overtime\u201d that resulted in him working in excess of the statutorily prescribed work hours in a day\/week, breached s 38(4) of the EA by failing to pay him the statutorily prescribed rate where he was required to work beyond the prescribed hours, and breached s 88(4) of the EA by failing to compensate him at the statutorily prescribed rate for work on a public holiday. Additionally, Chua claims that SBS had breached numerous clauses in a service agreement by failing to compensate him an agreed allowance for work done on the night shift, failing to add extra time to his credit insofar as he performed the First and Last Parade tasks, and failing to pay him for a certain time period between shifts when he was engaged to wait. 2', '6\\u2003SBS essentially denies Chua\u2019s claims, and asserts that it has complied with its contractual obligations and the laws, rules or regulations pertaining to working hours, overtime pay and rest days.

In October 2012, the first defendant told the first plaintiff that he was looking for investors in the Company in a \u201cfriends and family\u201d fund-raising round. 6', 'The first plaintiff and Mr Sobers introduced the first defendant to three other friends who they thought might be interested in investing: (a) the second plaintiff; (b) Yousuf Alqabandi (\u201cMr Alqabandi\u201d); and (c) Mohammad Albader (\u201cMr Albader\u201d). 7', 'As a result of these introductions, the first and second plaintiffs, Mr Alqabandi and Mr Albader ultimately did invest in the Company.

At that time, the first defendant was the Company\u2019s sole shareholder. The evidence of the plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses is that the first defendant made four oral representations (\u201cthe Representations\u201d) during these discussions in order to induce them to invest in the Company. The Representations are: 9', '(a)\\u2003That the plaintiffs would be investing in a \u201cFriends & Family\u201d fund-raising round, and on that basis, would be kept closely informed about the management and operations of the Company (\u201cthe Information Representation\u201d);', '(b)\\u2003That the plaintiffs would obtain a guaranteed 30% return on their investments and would be able to cash out their investments at any time (\u201cthe Investment Exit Representation\u201d);', '(c)\\u2003That the first defendant would personally guarantee the plaintiffs\u2019 investment and the 30% return under the Investment Exit Representation (\u201cthe Personal Guarantee Representation\u201d); and', '(d)\\u2003That the first defendant would not do anything to dilute the plaintiffs\u2019 shareholdings or to change the shareholding structure of the Company; or do any act which would adversely impact the value of the plaintiffs\u2019 investment before their exit from the Company unless otherwise agreed (\u201cthe Non-Dilution Representation\u201d).', '12\\u2003The plaintiffs also allege that the first defendant made the Representations in his personal capacity, ie, not as a director of or agent for the Company. 10', '13\\u2003The plaintiffs\u2019 evidence is that the first defendant made the Representations on four specific occasions: 11', '(a)\\u2003In November 2012 at the first plaintiff\u2019s home in Kuwait to both plaintiffs in the presence of Mr Albader; 12', '(b)\\u2003Later in November 2012, on a boat in Kuwait to the first plaintiff in the presence of Mr Albader; 13', '(c)\\u2003In December 2012, at the first defendant\u2019s home in Singapore to the first plaintiff alone; 14', 'and', '(d)\\u2003Later in December 2012, at Mr Sobers\u2019 home in Singapore to the first plaintiff in the presence of Mr Sobers. 15', '14\\u2003Following their discussions with the first defendant, each Kuwaiti Investor entered into a separate CNSA with the Company. The plaintiffs\u2019 evidence is that they relied on the Representations in entering into the CNSAs.', '15\\u2003The CNSAs as executed are dated March 2013. That is indeed when the Company sent the CNSAs to the Kuwaiti Investors for execution. 16', 'However, it is common ground that the Kuwaiti Investors executed the CNSAs and lent money to the Company only in May 2013. 17', 'Nothing in this action turns on this two-month gap.', '16\\u2003The terms of the four CNSAs are identical save for the amount invested. 18', 'In brief, under each CNSA, each Kuwaiti Investor agreed to make an interest-free loan to the Company subject to an obligation to convert his loan into shares as soon as the Company next received fresh investment. The shares were to be allotted to each Kuwaiti Investor at the same price as they were being allotted to the investor making the fresh investment. As the upside on his investment, each Kuwaiti Investor was entitled to have every US$1.00 of his loan treated as being worth US$1.30 for the purposes of the conversion. 19', '17\\u2003The relevant clauses of the CNSAs are as follows:', '(a)\\u2003The recitals:', '(b)\\u2003Clause 1.1, which is the interpretation clause:', '(c)\\u2003Clause 3.1:', '(d)\\u2003Clause 4:', '18\\u2003The first plaintiff lent the Company US$200,000 under his CNSA, whereas the second plaintiff lent the Company US$100,000. Mr Alqabandi and Mr Albader each lent the Company US$50,000.', '19\\u2003The friendly relationship between the parties came under strain in the first quarter of 2015. The strain was either precipitated by or manifested in four events.', '20\\u2003First, in January 2015, the first defendant told the Kuwaiti Investors that the Company had commenced its Series A Funding as defined in the CNSA. If true, this was the first step to forcing the Kuwaiti Investors to convert their loans into shares. The Kuwaiti Investors were sceptical about the first defendant\u2019s claim. When they pressed him on the identity of the Series A Funder, he was evasive. 20', '21\\u2003Further, for the purposes of the Series A Funding, the first defendant ascribed to the Company a pre-money valuation (ie, a valuation before the Series A Funding) of US$35m. The Kuwaiti Investors believed this valuation to be unjustifiably high. When they pressed the first defendant to justify his valuation, he could not do so. 21', 'The higher the valuation, of course, the more disadvantageous the conversion would be for the Kuwaiti Investors. 22', '22\\u2003Second, in February 2015, the first defendant indicated that he intended to extend the Company\u2019s business model in a manner which the Kuwaiti Investors believed would expose its business model and their investments to additional and unacceptable commercial and regulatory risk. 23', '23\\u2003Third, in April 2015, the plaintiffs travelled to Singapore to discuss their investments with the first defendant. A particular concern was the first defendant\u2019s justification for valuing the Company at US$35m. During their discussions, the first defendant alleged that the second plaintiff was merely a front for other investors and had not invested his own money in the Company. The second plaintiff took offence at this allegation.', '24\\u2003Finally, also in April 2015 but after the plaintiffs\u2019 trip to Singapore, the second defendant \u2013 acting on behalf of the Company and no doubt at the behest of the first defendant \u2013 informed the Kuwaiti Investors formally that a Conversion Event under the CNSA had been triggered because the Company had received the Series A Funding as at 31 March 2015. The second defendant therefore informed the Kuwaiti Investors that the Company would be converting their loans into shares in accordance with the CNSAs. 24', 'The Kuwaiti Investors did not accept that a Conversion Event had occurred. 25', 'As a result, on 21 April 2015, they told the first defendant that they did not want their loans to be converted into shares but instead wanted to cash out their investment in the Company at 130% of their initial investment. 26', '25\\u2003On 5 June 2015, four people met the first defendant to discuss the Kuwaiti Investors\u2019 exit from the Company (\u201cthe 5 June 2015 Meeting\u201d). The four were: (a) first plaintiff; (b) Mr Sobers; (c) Mr Gurmeet Aman Bedi; and (c) his sister, Ms Simran Bedi. The 5 June 2015 Meeting took place at the home of Ms Simran Bedi. The first plaintiff had authority from the other Kuwaiti Investors to represent their interests at this meeting. 27', '\u2018', '26\\u2003Mr Gurmeet Aman Bedi was another investor in the Company who had come in on the same friends and family round as the Kuwait Investors. Mr Gurmeet Aman Bedi had also asked the first defendant to return his investment with a 30% premium. By 5 June 2015, the first defendant had done so. 28', '27\\u2003At the 5 June 2015 Meeting, the first plaintiff reiterated the Kuwaiti Investors\u2019 wish to exit their investments. The plaintiffs\u2019 case is that the first defendant agreed to buy each Kuwaiti Investor\u2019s shares in the Company after conversion at 130% of his investment. He also agreed to buy Mr Alqabandi\u2019s and Mr Albader\u2019s shares by September 2015 and then to buy the first and second plaintiffs\u2019 shares by December 2015. 29', 'But the first defendant told the Kuwaiti Investors that they were each required by Singapore law to convert their loans into shares before he could buy them out. 30', '28\\u2003Following the 5 June 2015 Meeting, and by September 2015, the first defendant returned to Mr Alqabandi and Mr Albader their investment together with a 30% premium. 31', 'In order to enable this, both men allowed the Company to convert their loans into shares. 32', '29\\u2003The first plaintiff did not accept that a Conversion Event had in fact occurred or that his loan to the Company had to be converted into shares before the first defendant could return his investment to him. The first plaintiff therefore refused to allow the Company to convert his loan into shares. 33', 'The second plaintiff, however, allowed the first defendant to convert his loan into 104,006 shares in the Company. 34', '30\\u2003The first defendant did not return either of the two plaintiffs\u2019 investments. This was despite the first plaintiff sending several reminders to the first defendant to do so in the fourth quarter of 2015. 35', '31\\u2003In December 2015, in response to one of the reminders, the first defendant took the position that he had undertaken no legal obligation to return the Kuwaiti Investors\u2019 investments at the 5 June 2015 Meeting. His position was that he had offered to do so only as a favour to them, subject to his personal financial and life circumstances. 36', '32\\u2003The plaintiffs commenced this action in March 2016.', '33\\u2003The plaintiffs advance three causes of action against the first defendant.', '34\\u2003First, the plaintiffs claim that the Representations are false, were made by the first defendant fraudulently and induced them to enter into the CNSAs with the Company. The plaintiffs accordingly claim damages against the first defendant in the tort of deceit or under the Misrepresentation Act (Cap 390, 1994 Rev Ed). 37', 'Each plaintiff accordingly seeks an order that the first defendant pay to him his investment in full plus the 30% premium under the Investment Exit Representation (\u201cthe Misrepresentation Claim\u201d). 38', '35\\u2003Second, and in the alternative, the plaintiffs claim that the Representations gave rise to a separate contract between the Kuwaiti Investors and the first defendant (\u201cthe Separate Contract\u201d). The Separate Contract obliged the first defendant to pay each Kuwaiti Investor the amount of his investment together with a 30% premium. 39', 'The first defendant breached the Separate Contract. Each plaintiff accordingly seeks damages against the first defendant for breach of the Separate Contract (\u201cthe Separate Contract Claim\u201d). 40', '36\\u2003In the final alternative, the plaintiffs claim that the first defendant entered into an oral contract with each of the Kuwaiti Investors at the 5 June 2015 Meeting under which he is obliged to purchase the Kuwaiti Investors\u2019 shares at a purchase price equal to 130% of their respective investments by September 2015 (for Mr Alqabandi and Mr Albader) and by December 2015 (for the plaintiffs) (see [25] above) (\u201cthe Repayment Contract\u201d). 41', 'The first defendant has breached the Repayment Contract in respect of the plaintiffs. 42', 'The plaintiffs accordingly seek specific performance of the Repayment Contract 43', 'or damages against the first defendant for its breach (\u201cthe Repayment Contract Claim\u201d). 44', '37\\u2003I address each of the plaintiffs\u2019 three causes of action in turn.'"}
{"casename":"2021_SGHC_140","fact":"'3\\u2003The Present Application had its origins in a complaint made to the Law Society by a former client of the Respondent (\u201cthe Client\u201d). I set out below the factual background to the complaint and the Present Application. It should be noted that this was essentially the case alleged against the Respondent, and I did not make any final findings as to any contested factual matters.', '4\\u2003The complaint had its foundation in, among other things, the fact that the Respondent did not have a practising certificate between 17 December 2016 and 30 May 2018, during which time she was an undischarged bankrupt. According to the Client, she was unaware of this when she engaged the Respondent in or around December 2016 to advise and represent her in matrimonial proceedings concerning the care and custody of her child.', '5\\u2003In November 2017, about a year after engaging the Respondent as her solicitor, the Client, on the Respondent\u2019s advice, applied to the Family Justice Courts for the care and custody of her child. The firm at which the Respondent claimed she was then practising appeared on record as the Client\u2019s solicitors, with one Mr Ee Kwong Rong Clement, instead of the Respondent, named as the solicitor in charge.', '6\\u2003The parties were directed to proceed to mediation, which was scheduled to take place on 28 December 2017. On 18 December 2017, just over a week before the scheduled mediation, the Respondent informed the Client that she was an undischarged bankrupt, and was therefore unable to represent the Client in the mediation. The Client was anxious to have the Respondent represent her. Following discussions with the Respondent, the Client purportedly agreed to lend the Respondent a sum of $40,000. According to the Client, this loan, which was reflected in a simple note naming the Respondent\u2019s husband as the borrower, was extended to the Respondent to enable her to discharge her bankruptcy so that she could continue to represent the Client. As things turned out, the mediation scheduled for 28 December 2017 did not proceed because the Respondent could not attend on behalf of the Complainant.', '7\\u2003In February 2018, the Respondent allegedly approached the Client\u2019s mother for a loan, and borrowed a further sum of $20,000 from her.', '8\\u2003In early March 2018, the Respondent informed the Client that she was leaving the firm at which she claimed she was then practising and would be joining another firm, and that the Client\u2019s matter would also be transferred to the new firm as a result. The Client told the Respondent that this was acceptable to her \u201c[a]s long as [the Respondent was] still [her] lawyer\u201d. On 20 March 2018, the new firm filed a Notice of Change of Solicitors to formally take over as the solicitors for the Client in the care and custody proceedings. Again, the named solicitor in charge was not the Respondent, but one Mr Say Chin Phang Sean (\u201cMr Sean Say\u201d). At that time, unbeknownst to the Client, the Respondent was still an undischarged bankrupt and did not have a valid practising certificate.', '9\\u2003As the mediation scheduled for 28 December 2017 had not taken place (see [6] above), the Client\u2019s care and custody application was fixed for hearing. In Whatsapp messages exchanged with the Client, the Respondent gave the impression that she had discharged her bankruptcy, and would be appearing and making submissions at the hearing as the Client\u2019s counsel. In April 2018, the hearing of the Client\u2019s care and custody application took place. The Client was apparently surprised to learn that the counsel who appeared on her behalf at the hearing was Mr Sean Say, and not the Respondent. As things turned out, the Client\u2019s application failed.', '10\\u2003In May 2018, the Respondent\u2019s bankruptcy was finally discharged. The Client had in the meantime filed an appeal in respect of her earlier unsuccessful application in the care and custody proceedings. Between June and mid-September 2018, the Client and the Respondent had various discussions concerning the appeal, and also over the repayment of the sums owed by the Respondent to the Client and her mother. The relationship between the parties deteriorated as a result of the loans, which remained unpaid, as well as the Client\u2019s unhappiness over how the Respondent had handled her care and custody application. In September 2018, the Client discharged the Respondent as her solicitor and engaged new solicitors to handle her appeal in respect of that application. Later that month, the loans that had been extended to the Respondent by the Client and her mother were finally repaid following numerous acrimonious Whatsapp exchanges between the parties and a letter of demand sent by the Client\u2019s new solicitors.', '11\\u2003In August 2019, the Client succeeded in her appeal in the care and custody proceedings. The following month, she lodged a complaint with the Law Society in connection with the Respondent\u2019s conduct concerning the matters set out above.', '12\\u2003By the time the Client lodged her complaint with the Law Society in September 2019, the Respondent had obtained a practising certificate. Because the Law Society thought that the complaint had been made against the Respondent in her capacity as a regulated legal practitioner, an Inquiry Committee (\u201cIC\u201d) was constituted in December 2019.', '13\\u2003The Respondent did not object to the constitution of the IC, and sought extensions of time to submit her written explanations in response to the complaint. She eventually informed the IC that she would not be submitting any written explanation, but wished to be heard at the IC hearing.', '14\\u2003The hearing before the IC took place in March 2020, and the Client and the Respondent each attended separately. Two months later, in May 2020, the IC issued its report with its findings and recommendations (\u201cthe IC Report\u201d). The IC\u2019s key findings were as follows:', '(a)\\u2003The Respondent did not dispute most of the background facts which led to the complaint (summarised at [4]\u2013[10] above). She claimed that at the material time, she was suffering from depression because of several emotionally draining matters that she had conduct of. However, she did not adduce any medical reports to substantiate this.', '(b)\\u2003Between December 2016 and May 2018, the Respondent did not have a valid practising certificate. She had therefore breached s 33 of the LPA by falsely pretending that she was duly authorised to practise as an advocate and solicitor during this period.', '(c)\\u2003Because the Respondent was not authorised to practise as an advocate and solicitor during this period, no further findings were made by the IC in respect of the other matters complained of by the Client, especially in relation to the purported loans extended to the Respondent by the Client and her mother (described at [6]\u2013[7] above) and the conduct of the hearing of the Client\u2019s care and custody application in April 2018 (summarised at [9] above).', '15\\u2003After the issuance of the IC Report, the Law Society realised that the crux of the Client\u2019s allegations against the Respondent related to a period when she did not have a practising certificate. The Law Society thus made the Present Application in November 2020.', '16\\u2003Following the filing of the Present Application by the Law Society, the Respondent filed HC\/SUM 123\/2021 (\u201cSUM 123\u201d) seeking leave to: (a) file an affidavit responding to the Present Application; and (b) make submissions. In her supporting affidavit for SUM 123, the Respondent contended that the Present Application was procedurally defective because the Law Society was not the proper applicant. She seemed to take the position that the Present Application could only be made by her putative client (that is to say, the Client) in respect of the matters complained of. She also indicated that she wished to be permitted to address the court in response to the Present Application.', '17\\u2003SUM 123 was not opposed by the Law Society. However, during the hearing before me, Mr Low only made submissions on the question of whether the Law Society had standing to bring the Present Application. No affidavit was filed by the Respondent on the factual matters that were presented to me. As it turned out, it was in fact unnecessary for the Respondent to have filed SUM 123 in the circumstances since, in line with the prevailing case law, I would in any event have permitted her to address me on such matters as the question of the Law Society\u2019s standing to prosecute the Client\u2019s complaint (see Law Society of Singapore v Ravi s\/o Madasamy [2015] 3 SLR 1187 (\u201cRavi\u201d) at [52]\u2013[53]; Re Parti Liyani [2020] 5 SLR 1080 (\u201cParti Liyani\u201d) at [20]\u2013[22]). Accordingly, I made no order on SUM 123.', '18\\u2003As mentioned above (at [16]), the Respondent raised a specific procedural objection to the Present Application: that it was only the Client, and not the Law Society, who could bring the Present Application. The Respondent made three points in support of her position:', '(a)\\u2003First, Parliament had intended that the Law Society would regulate only practising solicitors under s 85 of the LPA. Non-practising solicitors and Legal Service Officers were to be regulated by \u201cthe Courts\u201d (to be more precise, the Supreme Court: see s 82A(2) of the LPA) instead under s 82A. It followed that the Law Society had no disciplinary control over non-practising solicitors, and it therefore could not properly bring an application under s 82A for leave to investigate a complaint of misconduct against a non-practising solicitor.', '(b)\\u2003Second, the Legal Profession (Disciplinary Tribunal) Rules (Cap 161, R 2, 2010 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe DT Rules\u201d) clearly provided that an application under s 82A of the LPA was to be made by the putative client of the non-practising solicitor concerned (referred to hereafter as the \u201cputative client\u201d for short), and not by the Law Society. This was said to follow from various provisions of the DT Rules.', '(c)\\u2003Third, the Law Society had already conducted an investigation into the complaint against the Respondent based on s 85 of the LPA, and this lent credence to the notion that its jurisdiction was confined to those governed by that provision, meaning advocates and solicitors who had a practising certificate in force. Having convened the IC and completed the inquiry process, the Law Society could not now invoke \u201ca different and incorrect route of DT proceedings to investigate the complaint\u201d.', '19\\u2003The Law Society made five points in response and contended that it did indeed have the requisite standing to bring the Present Application:', '(a)\\u2003First, the text of s 82A of the LPA did not prescribe who could make an application under the section for leave to investigate a complaint of misconduct against a non-practising solicitor. This would therefore suggest that any interested party could make such an application.', '(b)\\u2003Second, there was nothing to indicate that Parliament had intended to prevent the Law Society from making an application under s 82A of the LPA. That the Law Society did not have \u201cdirect disciplinary control\u201d over non-practising solicitors under s 82A simply meant that the Law Society was not able to initiate disciplinary proceedings against such solicitors. That, however, was a distinct matter from the question of standing to make an application under s 82A. Indeed, the whole point of s 82A was to vest control over disciplinary proceedings against non-practising solicitors ultimately in the hands of the Chief Justice, whose leave was required before such disciplinary proceedings could be initiated. But that said nothing about who could make an application under s 82A. The Respondent had in fact erroneously conflated the concepts of jurisdiction and standing.', '(c)\\u2003Third, there were clear precedents in which the High Court had allowed applications under s 82A of the LPA for leave to convene DTs to investigate complaints of misconduct against non-practising solicitors, even where these applications were brought by the Law Society.', '(d)\\u2003Fourth, nothing in the text of the DT Rules prohibited the Law Society from bringing an application under s 82A of the LPA.', '(e)\\u2003Fifth, given that the Respondent currently held a practising certificate which was still active, the Law Society had a clear interest in taking the necessary steps to seek leave to investigate the Respondent\u2019s alleged misconduct, even though the misconduct complained of had taken place at a time when she did not have a valid practising certificate.', '20\\u2003The Law Society further submitted that leave should be granted for the Client\u2019s allegations against the Respondent to be investigated and for a DT to be convened for this purpose. The Law Society advanced two reasons in support of this submission. First, the evidence was sufficient to support a prima facie finding of misconduct on the part of the Respondent. Second, there was nothing that militated against the grant of leave, especially having regard to the severity of the allegations of misconduct and the strength of the case against the Respondent. The Law Society also took pains to emphasise that it was not relying on the IC Report for the purposes of the Present Application, but, rather, was acting on the primary evidence pertaining to the matters complained of.', '21\\u2003I agreed with the Law Society that it had standing to bring the Present Application under s 82A of the LPA. In my judgment, both the Law Society as well as the Client (the putative client in this case) had standing to bring this application. This conclusion rested on the following four prongs: (a) the text of the relevant provisions of the LPA and the DT Rules; (b) the rationale behind s 82A specifically; (c) the case law; and (d) the purpose of disciplinary proceedings under the LPA generally. I now set out my reasons in detail. I also make an additional observation on the relevance of the IC proceedings to the Present Application.', '22\\u2003I begin with s 82A(5) of the LPA, which deals with the procedure for applying for leave to investigate allegations of misconduct against non-practising solicitors. Section 82A(5) reads:', '23\\u2003As noted by the Law Society, the plain text of s 82A(5) does not preclude the Law Society from making an application under s 82A. Section 82A(5) is silent as to who may bring such an application. This would militate against any suggestion that such an application may only be made by the putative client. Faced with this obvious hurdle, the Respondent focused instead on the text of the DT Rules.', '24\\u2003The Respondent relied on the following provisions of the DT Rules in support of her contention that it was only the putative client who could bring an application under s 82A of the LPA:', '(a)\\u2003the definition of \u201ccomplainant\u201d under r 2(1);', '(b)\\u2003the procedures under r 5 that a complainant had to comply with in order to commence disciplinary proceedings against non-practising solicitors;', '(c)\\u2003the requirement under r 7(2) that a complainant had to employ a solicitor and be represented by the solicitor in the conduct of the proceedings before the DT;', '(d)\\u2003the mode of service of any letter, notice or document on the complainant provided for under r 19(5); and', '(e)\\u2003Form 2, which concerns the Statement of the Case.', '25\\u2003In my judgment, the Respondent\u2019s points did not take her very far at all. The DT Rules contemplate that an application under s 82A of the LPA shall be made by a \u201ccomplainant\u201d. I agreed with the Respondent that a \u201ccomplainant\u201d would clearly include the putative client. However, for the reasons set out below, that does not in any way mean that a \u201ccomplainant\u201d cannot include the Law Society:', '(a)\\u2003Rule 2(1) of the DT Rules defines a \u201ccomplainant\u201d as \u201ca person \u2026 who has made an application under section 82A(5) for leave for an investigation to be made into a complaint against \u2026 a non-practising solicitor\u201d. Significantly, this definition does not limit the \u201ccomplainant\u201d to the person who made the complaint, who would typically, although not necessarily, be the putative client. Instead, this definition drives me back to s 82A(5), which, as I have already noted (see [23] above), does not set any limit on who may bring an application under s 82A. Furthermore, the word \u201cperson\u201d in this definition can encompass both natural and non-natural persons, such as the Law Society.', '(b)\\u2003Rule 5(b)(i) provides that within eight days after leave is granted for a DT to be empanelled to investigate a complaint of misconduct against a non-practising solicitor, the \u201ccomplainant\u201d shall provide (among other things) the name and contact particulars of \u201chis solicitor\u201d. Rule 5(b)(i) simply contemplates that the \u201ccomplainant\u201d will be represented by a solicitor in the proceedings before the DT, and in this regard, the Law Society can and does engage solicitors to represent it in disciplinary proceedings which are commenced pursuant to an application made under s 82A.', '(c)\\u2003Rule 7(2) provides that where disciplinary proceedings are commenced pursuant to an application by a \u201ccomplainant\u201d under s 82A, the \u201ccomplainant\u201d shall \u201cemploy a solicitor and be represented by the solicitor in the conduct of proceedings before the [DT]\u201d. Once again, the Law Society, much like any putative client, can engage and be represented by a solicitor in such proceedings.', '(d)\\u2003Rule 19(5) provides that service of any letter, notice or document on a \u201ccomplainant\u201d may be effected by: (a) leaving the letter, notice or document in an envelope addressed to the \u201ccomplainant\u201d at any address for service provided by the \u201ccomplainant\u201d; (b) sending the letter, notice or document to the \u201ccomplainant\u201d at any address for service provided by the \u201ccomplainant\u201d; or (c) serving the letter, notice or document on the \u201ccomplainant\u2019s\u201d solicitor. The Law Society does have a correspondence address for the service of documents, and, again, it can and does engage solicitors to act for it in disciplinary proceedings which are commenced pursuant to an application made under s 82A.', '(e)\\u2003Rule 5(b)(ii) stipulates that within eight days after leave is granted for a DT to be empanelled to investigate a complaint of misconduct against a non-practising solicitor, five copies of the Statement of the Case (as well as the affidavit referred to in s 82A(5)) are to be furnished. The Statement of the Case, as set out in Form 2 of the First Schedule to the DT Rules, is to be signed by either the \u201c[c]omplainant\u201d or the \u201c[s]olicitor representing the [c]omplainant\u201d. Once again, there is nothing to prevent the Law Society from being the \u201c[c]omplainant\u201d or from engaging solicitors to act for it in respect of a complaint of misconduct against a non-practising solicitor.', '26\\u2003In fact, a closer examination of the text of the DT Rules shows that a person other than the putative client may bring an application under s 82A of the LPA. As I have already noted, r 2(1) defines a \u201ccomplainant\u201d in relation to such an application simply as \u201ca person \u2026 who has made an application under section 82A(5) for leave for an investigation to be made into a complaint against \u2026 a non-practising solicitor\u201d. As stipulated in s 82A(5), such an application is to be made by ex parte originating summons and supported by an affidavit setting out the non-practising solicitor\u2019s alleged misconduct. Rule 2(1), read with s 82A(5), contemplates that the \u201ccomplainant\u201d in this context is simply the person who affirms or swears the affidavit in support of the application under s 82A. Significantly, there is no requirement, either in the LPA or in the DT Rules, that the person affirming or swearing the affidavit in support of an application under s 82A must be the putative client.', '27\\u2003In a similar vein, r 2(1) defines a \u201ccomplaint\u201d for the purposes of an application under s 82A of the LPA simply as \u201ca complaint of the conduct of \u2026 a regulated non-practitioner\u201d, and states that it includes \u201cthe affidavit referred to in section 82A(5) setting out the allegations of misconduct against the \u2026 non-practising solicitor\u201d. There is nothing in this definition which indicates that the affidavit cannot be affirmed or sworn by someone other than the putative client.', '28\\u2003In sum, it appears from a plain reading of the relevant provisions of the LPA and the DT Rules that there are no limits on the categories of persons who may make an application under s 82A of the LPA; nor, specifically, is there any basis in those provisions to exclude the Law Society from making such an application. The absence of any such limitations would suggest that persons other than the putative client and the Law Society may also make applications under s 82A. This can lead to situations where such applications are brought by \u201cbusybodies\u201d who have little to no connection with the non-practising solicitor concerned, which could give rise to the potential for abuse. However, as I explain below at [39]\u2013[40], it is unnecessary for me to decide determinatively whether any limitations should be imposed to guard against such abuse, given that the present case is concerned with the narrower question of the Law Society\u2019s standing to make an application under s 82A. As to this, I am satisfied that the answer is that it has such standing.', '29\\u2003I turn to the rationale behind the enactment of s 82A of the LPA, which is my second basis for holding that the Law Society did have standing to bring the Present Application (see [21] above). The Respondent cited the following observations of the then Minister for Law, Prof S Jayakumar (\u201cthe Minister for Law\u201d), at the second reading of the Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill (Bill No 34\/1993) (see Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (12 November 1993) vol 61 at col 1163) in support of her contention that the Law Society lacked the requisite standing:', '30\\u2003The Respondent relied on the above extract to make two points: first, that the Law Society does not have disciplinary control over non-practising solicitors; and, second, that the Law Society is therefore not the proper person to make an application under s 82A of the LPA for the grant of leave for a DT to be appointed to investigate a complaint of misconduct against a non-practising solicitor.', '31\\u2003In my judgment, the Law Society was correct to say that in advancing this position, the Respondent had improperly conflated quite different concepts. I agreed with the Respondent\u2019s first point that the Law Society has no disciplinary control over non-practising solicitors. That, indeed, is why s 82A of the LPA was enacted to vest such control in the Chief Justice, whose leave is required before investigations into complaints of misconduct against non-practising solicitors may be commenced. This is consistent with the legislative intent expressed in the extract from the Minister for Law\u2019s speech quoted at [29] above. However, the Respondent\u2019s first point does not lead to her second point, which is that the Law Society is therefore barred from even applying under s 82A for leave for a DT to be appointed to investigate a non-practising solicitor\u2019s alleged misconduct.', '32\\u2003In my judgment, to say that the Law Society has no disciplinary control over non-practising solicitors means only that the Law Society cannot, of its own motion, commence disciplinary proceedings against such solicitors in the same way that it can, of its own motion, commence disciplinary proceedings against practising solicitors (for instance, by appointing an IC under s 85 of the LPA). Instead, as I have already noted, the Chief Justice\u2019s leave must be obtained before disciplinary proceedings against non-practising solicitors can be initiated.', '33\\u2003However, this is conceptually distinct from the question of the Law Society\u2019s standing to bring an application under s 82A of the LPA for leave to investigate a non-practising solicitor\u2019s alleged misconduct. In fact, that the Law Society has to make such an application is consistent with the legislative intent referred to above: it is precisely because the Law Society does not have disciplinary control over a non-practising solicitor that it must apply for leave under s 82A before it can investigate a complaint of misconduct against such a solicitor. Put differently, the Law Society\u2019s lack of disciplinary control over non-practising solicitors means only that it must, like any other \u201ccomplainant\u201d, apply for leave under s 82A before any investigation into a non-practising solicitor\u2019s alleged misconduct can be carried out.', '34\\u2003The Respondent\u2019s contention that the Law Society had no standing to bring the Present Application also ran contrary to a line of established authorities where, on the application of the Law Society under s 82A of the LPA, leave was granted for a DT to be convened to investigate a non-practising solicitor\u2019s alleged misconduct: see Ravi; Law Society of Singapore v Mahadevan Lukshumayeh and others [2008] 4 SLR(R) 116 (\u201cMahadevan\u201d); and Law Society of Singapore v Gopalan Nair (alias Pallichadath Gopalan Nair) [2011] 4 SLR 607 at [4].', '35\\u2003I note that the issue of the Law Society\u2019s standing to make an application under s 82A of the LPA was not raised in these authorities, but that suggests that it was perhaps not thought to be a point worth taking.', '36\\u2003Lastly, and, in my judgment, most significantly, the question of the Law Society\u2019s standing to make an application under s 82A of the LPA brings me to the underlying purpose of disciplinary proceedings under the LPA. In this regard, I find pertinent the following observations of the High Court in Deepak Sharma v Law Society of Singapore [2016] 4 SLR 192 (\u201cSharma\u201d) on the question of standing to make a complaint to the Law Society under s 85 of the LPA about the conduct of a practising solicitor:', '37\\u2003The High Court\u2019s observations in Sharma (which, as just mentioned, dealt with the question of who may make a complaint to the Law Society under s 85 of the LPA as regards the conduct of a practising solicitor) apply, in my judgment, with equal force to s 82A of the LPA. The goal of securing the high standards and good reputation of the legal profession undergirds disciplinary proceedings against both practising and non-practising solicitors. To that extent, there is a strong, if not overarching, public interest in having substantive complaints of misconduct by solicitors investigated. Importantly, this concerns not just the interest of the client or putative client in question, but also the public interest. It follows that the pursuit of a complaint against a legal practitioner should not be treated simply as a matter of contract, to be acted on only at the behest of the client or putative client who was or is party to a contractual relationship with the legal practitioner. As the High Court noted in Sharma, disciplinary proceedings do not come to an end simply because the client (or putative client) decides to withdraw the complaint, no matter how voluntarily or unreservedly.', '38\\u2003This consideration has particular force in the context of s 82A because it is not difficult to envisage situations where a putative client might have good reason to complain about the conduct of a non-practising solicitor, and yet be unwilling or unable to bring an application under s 82A. This is because in order to make such an application, the putative client would have to expend time and expense, which might quite reasonably be regarded by the putative client as an impediment to pursuing the matters which he or she is aggrieved about. In such a situation, if no party aside from the putative client is able to make an application under s 82A, it could result in meritorious complaints not being investigated. That is plainly not in the public interest.', '39\\u2003I return here to the point I alluded to earlier (see [28] above), namely, that adopting the position that there are no limits on the categories of persons who may make an application under s 82A of the LPA might give rise to vexatious applications by \u201cbusybodies\u201d having little to no connection with the non-practising solicitor concerned. I note that in Re Fordham, Michael QC [2015] 1 SLR 272 at [31], the High Court remarked, in relation to complaints against practising solicitors under s 85 of the LPA, that only those who are able to demonstrate \u201csufficient interest\u201d in making a complaint may properly make a complaint. Without coming to a final decision on the imposition of such a limit on applications under s 82A, I note that this would obviate any concerns of the floodgates being opened, and so ensure that applications under s 82A are not made in an oppressive manner.', '40\\u2003It is, however, not necessary for me to decide the point because the present case concerns only the narrow question of whether the Law Society has standing to make an application under s 82A. In my view, even if a requirement of \u201csufficient interest\u201d were to apply in the context of s 82A, the Law Society would undoubtedly satisfy this threshold.', '41\\u2003This is because the purposes of the Law Society, as stipulated in s 38(1) of the LPA, are (among other things):', '42\\u2003The corollary of these two important mandates must be that the Law Society may, where necessary, bring applications under s 82A of the LPA for leave to investigate complaints of misconduct against non-practising solicitors because in doing so, it would be advancing its statutory purposes of maintaining and improving the standards of conduct of the legal profession, and protecting and assisting the public in all matters relating to the law. In this regard, I consider there to be little, if any, risk of the Law Society being unduly burdened by frivolous complaints. This is because the Law Society is not compelled to bring an application under s 82A whenever it receives a complaint of misconduct against a non-practising solicitor, but, rather, has a discretion to decide whether to bring such an application.', '43\\u2003For completeness, I note that there would conceivably be others, aside from the Law Society and the putative client, who may also be taken to have a \u201csufficient interest\u201d in bringing applications under s 82A, including at least the Attorney-General, who (among other things) is mandated to uphold the public interest in all matters relating to the law.', '44\\u2003Before leaving the issue of the Law Society\u2019s standing to bring the Present Application, I address the Respondent\u2019s contention that the Law Society, \u201c[h]aving convened the IC and completed the inquiry process, \u2026 now seeks to use a different and incorrect route of DT proceedings to investigate the [Client\u2019s] complaint\u201d (see [18(c)] above). In my judgment, there was no merit in this argument for two reasons.', '45\\u2003First, the IC proceedings were separate and distinct from the Present Application. Further, as I highlighted earlier (at [20] above), the Law Society did not rely on the IC\u2019s findings in support of the Present Application. Instead, it relied on the underlying documentary evidence furnished by the Client.', '46\\u2003Second, the alleged misconduct by the Respondent took place at a time when she did not have a practising certificate. It is clear that \u201cany advocate and solicitor who does not have in force a practising certificate at the time the alleged misconduct occurs would fall within [the] purview [of s 82A]\u201d: see Mahadevan at [12]. The Law Society was thus correct to make the Present Application in order to pursue the Client\u2019s complaint. In truth, the IC proceedings were a nullity since they were initiated by mistake with no jurisdictional basis.', '47\\u2003I turn now to the question of whether leave should be granted for a DT to be empanelled to investigate the Client\u2019s complaint. The applicable test in this regard is the two-step framework that is well established in the case law (see Parti Liyani at [25] and Re Salwant Singh s\/o Amer Singh [2019] 5 SLR 1037 (\u201cSalwant Singh\u201d) at [30]):', '(a)\\u2003First, the Chief Justice must be satisfied that there is a prima facie case for an investigation into the complaint.', '(b)\\u2003Second, if a prima facie case is found, the Chief Justice should then consider any relevant factors in favour of, as well as militating against, an investigation into the alleged misconduct. In other words, the finding of a prima facie case at the first step does not entail that leave must necessarily be given for an investigation to be carried out. Instead, the Chief Justice has the discretion to decide whether to grant leave.', '48\\u2003In the present case, I was satisfied that both steps of this framework clearly led to the conclusion that leave should be granted for a DT to be empanelled to investigate the Client\u2019s complaint.', '49\\u2003A prima facie case for an investigation into a complaint of misconduct against a non-practising solicitor is made out where the evidence, if it is eventually accepted by the court, would be sufficient to prove every element of the alleged misconduct, either directly as a primary fact or inferentially as a secondary fact (see Re Nalpon Zero Geraldo Mario [2012] 3 SLR 440 at [22]\u2013[24]).', '50\\u2003I agreed with the Law Society that there was a prima facie case for an investigation into the Client\u2019s complaint in relation to two distinct acts of misconduct.', '51\\u2003The first act of misconduct related to the Respondent falsely pretending to be authorised to act as an advocate and solicitor, in contravention of s 33 of the LPA. As I mentioned earlier, the Respondent was an undischarged bankrupt, and thus disqualified from holding a practising certificate, between 17 December 2016 and 30 May 2018. Yet, during this period, she continued to represent to the Client that she was duly authorised to act as the Client\u2019s solicitor. This can be seen from the following evidence, which clearly met the threshold of a prima facie case for an investigation to be carried out:', '(a)\\u2003The Respondent appeared to have undertaken work typically carried out by solicitors, including advising the Client on substantive matters such as the filing of the Client\u2019s care and custody application in the Family Justice Courts, and discussing payment for work done in relation to that application.', '(b)\\u2003Even after the Respondent revealed to the Client on 18 December 2017 that she was an undischarged bankrupt and therefore unable to represent the Client in the mediation scheduled for 28 December 2017 (see [6] above), she appeared to have continued to discuss with the Client payment for work done in relation to the Client\u2019s care and custody application. She also appeared to have assured the Client on several occasions that she was handling the Client\u2019s matter \u201cpersonally\u201d as her lawyer, and would be attending and representing the Client at court hearings. On one occasion, the Client asked the Respondent if she would be representing the Client at a forthcoming hearing and the Respondent stated that she would be.', '(c)\\u2003Further, on two occasions, the Respondent appeared to have misrepresented to the Client the true position as regards her bankruptcy and consequent inability to act as the Client\u2019s solicitor. First, in January 2018, she sent the Client a Whatsapp message stating that the discharge of her bankruptcy was \u201csorted\u201d (the implication being that she could now hold a practising certificate), even though she was still an undischarged bankrupt at the time. Second, in March 2018, she sent the Client another Whatsapp message stating that she was \u201cin a v [sic] happy place \u2026 [w]ith [a] monkey off [her] back\u201d. When the Client replied saying that she had been \u201cso worried [the Respondent] wouldn\u2019t get [a] PC [practising certificate] in time\u201d, the Respondent did not correct the Client\u2019s mistaken impression that she could now obtain a practising certificate and had already done so.', '52\\u2003The second act of misconduct concerned the loan of $40,000 made by the Client in December 2017 ostensibly to the Respondent\u2019s husband but in reality to the Respondent, and the loan of $20,000 made by the Client\u2019s mother in February 2018 to the Respondent (see [6]\u2013[7] above). These loans were allegedly made by the Client and her mother to enable the Respondent to discharge her bankruptcy so that she could continue representing the Client in the care and custody proceedings. The Respondent did not seem to contest the loan from the Client\u2019s mother. As for the loan from the Client, there was some supporting documentary evidence of this.', '53\\u2003The taking of loans by a solicitor from his or her client would ordinarily be a contravention of r 23 of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 (Cap 161, S 706\/2015) (\u201cthe PCR\u201d), which prohibits a legal practitioner from (among other things) borrowing money from a client and procuring his or her immediate family member(s) to borrow money from a client. The question arises as to whether r 23 of the PCR applies to the loans to the Respondent from the Client and her mother, given that they were extended at a time when the Respondent did not have a practising certificate.', '54\\u2003However, it is not necessary for me to resolve this issue. That can be addressed by the DT, or by the Court of Three Judges in due course if this matter reaches that court. Further, even assuming that r 23 of the PCR does not apply to the loans made to the Respondent by the Client and her mother, the Respondent\u2019s acceptance of these loans would nonetheless be a prima facie case of misconduct under s 83(2)(h) of the LPA. Section 83(2)(h) is a catch-all provision that covers \u201csuch conduct as would render [a solicitor] unfit to remain as a member of an honourable profession\u201d: see Law Society of Singapore v Ahmad Khalis bin Abdul Ghani [2006] 4 SLR(R) 308 at [79], citing In re Weare, a Solicitor; In re the Solicitors Act, 1888 [1893] 2 QB 439. It applies to misconduct by a solicitor in both his or her professional and private capacities: see Law Society of Singapore v Heng Guan Hong Geoffrey [1999] 3 SLR(R) 966 at [25]. In the present case, the Respondent appeared to have told the Client that unless her bankruptcy were discharged, she would not be able to focus completely on representing the Client. This suggests that the Respondent exerted some \u201cpressure\u201d on the Client and her mother to provide the loans outlined at [6]\u2013[7] above. Further, while the loans were received in December 2017 and February 2018, the Respondent\u2019s bankruptcy was only discharged in May 2018. Despite this, the Respondent appeared to have misrepresented to the Client in January 2018 that her bankruptcy had been discharged, and in March 2018 that she had a valid practising certificate (see [51(c)] above). It appears therefore that there might also have been a lack of candour on the Respondent\u2019s part. These actions by the Respondent were sufficient to establish a prima facie case that her conduct rendered her \u201cunfit to remain as a member of an honourable profession\u201d.', '55\\u2003Accordingly, I was satisfied under the first step of the two-step framework that there was a prima facie case for an investigation into the Client\u2019s complaint.', '56\\u2003Turning to the second step of the two-step framework, I likewise agreed with the Law Society that leave should be granted for an investigation to be made into the Respondent\u2019s alleged misconduct. I came to this conclusion for the following four reasons.', '57\\u2003First, the severity of the allegations of misconduct and the strength of the evidence against the Respondent weighed in favour of granting leave (see Ravi at [55] and Salwant Singh at [67]):', '(a)\\u2003The allegations levied against the Respondent were serious. In Mahadevan at [12], the High Court considered that the wilful misrepresentation by a person of his or her authorisation to act as an advocate and solicitor in breach of s 33 of the LPA would constitute \u201cmisconduct unbefitting \u2026 an advocate and solicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession\u201d for the purposes of s 82A(3)(a) of the LPA.', '(b)\\u2003Further, the allegations levied against the Respondent were supported by objective documentary evidence.', '58\\u2003Second, there was no delay on the Law Society\u2019s part in taking out the Present Application (as to the relevance of delay in this regard, see Salwant Singh at [31]). To recapitulate, the Client discharged the Respondent as her solicitor in September 2018 after her care and custody application failed at first instance. The Client then engaged new solicitors for her appeal in respect of that application, which appeal concluded successfully in August 2019. It was only after the successful conclusion of the appeal that the Client made a complaint to the Law Society, which then initiated the process leading to the Present Application (see [10]\u2013[11] above).', '59\\u2003The only possible \u201cdelay\u201d, if any, would pertain to the one-year period between the Client\u2019s discharging of the Respondent as her solicitor in September 2018 and her lodging of her complaint with the Law Society in September 2019. As to this, I agreed with the Law Society that it was not at all unreasonable for the Client to have awaited the outcome of her appeal in respect of her care and custody application before lodging a formal complaint, since her complaint, at least in part, arose out of the Respondent\u2019s conduct in connection with that application at first instance. To that extent, the findings on appeal might have been relevant to her complaint: see Parti Liyani at [45].', '60\\u2003Third, the prior IC proceedings in no way prejudiced the Respondent. I have already observed that the Present Application was separate and distinct from the IC proceedings, and that for the purposes of the Present Application, the Law Society relied on primary documents and evidence furnished by the Client, and not on the IC\u2019s findings (see [20] and [45] above). Further, and in any event, the DT which is to be empanelled to investigate the Respondent\u2019s alleged misconduct will hear the matter afresh: see Parti Liyani at [48]. To that extent, the Respondent will have an opportunity to explain her position and put forward her case during the proceedings before the DT.', '61\\u2003Fourth, the Respondent\u2019s purported medical condition did not militate against the grant of leave. The significance of this condition should be left to be decided by the DT when it is empanelled: see Ravi at [54].

Mr O K Lim is the patriarch of the Lim Family. The Lim Family are the sole shareholders of OTPL and HLT. At all material times, the Lims were also the directors of both companies.

First, Shafiq knowingly possessed the drugs.  \nSecond, he knew the nature of the drugs in his possession, ie, that the drugs in \nquestion were methamphetamine.  Third, and this element is not in dispute, the \nmethamphetamine has been brought into Singapore without prior authorisation.  \n11 For the first element of the offence, the Prosecution\u2019s primary case is \nthat the presumption of possession in s 18(1)(a) of the MDA is satisfied in this \ncase, as it is undisputed that Shafiq was in possession of the blue milk powder \nbox and the orange biscuit packet that contain the methamphetamine, and that \nShafiq is unable to rebut the presumption.  Alternatively, the Prosecution argues \nthat Shafiq was wilfully blind to the existence of the methamphetamine in the \nblue milk powder box and the orange biscuit packet.  \n12 For the second element of the offence under s 7 of the MDA, the \nProsecution\u2019s case is that Shafiq knew the nature of the drugs in his possession, \nie, that the drugs were methamphetamine.  The Prosecution relies on the \npresumption in s 18(2) of the MDA to establish such knowledge because they \nsay that it has been proven or presumed that Shafiq knowingly possessed the \nfour packets of methamphetamine in the blue milk powder box and the packet \nof methamphetamine in the orange biscuit packet.   \nThe Defence\u2019s case\n13 Shafiq admits to having knowingly possessed and imported the small \nplastic packet of methamphetamine in the orange biscuit packet.

His counsel contends that he has rebutted the \npresumption under s 18(1)(a) of the MDA that he was in possession of the \nmethamphetamine in the blue milk powder box because, for the reasons \nelaborated below, he has shown that he had no knowledge that those drugs were \nin the blue milk powder box.\n14 As for the Prosecution\u2019s alternative case that he was wilfully blind to the \nexistence of the drugs in the blue milk powder box, Shafiq\u2019s counsel contends \nthat he had no basis to suspect that the blue milk powder box would contain the \nfour plastic packets of methamphetamine.  \nThe applicable law and issues \n15 The elements of a charge under s 7 of the MDA for the offence of drug \nimportation are well established: the legal burden is on the Prosecution to prove \nthat (a) the accused person was in possession of the drugs; (b) the accused \nperson had knowledge of the nature of the drugs; and (c) the drugs were \nintentionally brought into Singapore without prior authorisation.

It is not necessary to show that the accused knew that \nthe thing was in fact a controlled drug in order to establish the element of \npossession: see Adili at [31].  Knowledge of the \u201cnature of the drug\u201d refers to \nknowledge of the actual controlled drug referred to in the charge: see \nNagaenthran a\/l K Dharmalingam v Public Prosecutor [2011] 4 SLR 1156 at \n[24].  \nVersion No 1: 22 Jun 2021 (17:53 hrs)\nPP v Muhammad Shafiq bin Shariff[2021] SGHC 150\n916 It is equally trite that the Prosecution may either prove the elements of \npossession and knowledge of the nature of the drugs beyond a reasonable doubt \nor rely on the statutory presumptions under ss 18(1) and 18(2) of the MDA \nrespectively to presume these two elements, so that the burden of proof shifts to \nthe accused to rebut the statutory presumption on a balance of probabilities: see, \neg, Ilechukwu Uchechukwu Chukwudi v Public Prosecutor [2021] 1 SLR 67 \n(\u201cIlechukwu\u201d) at [171]; Gobi a\/l Avedian v Public Prosecutor [2021] 1 SLR 180 \n(\u201cGobi\u201d) at [57] and [98(b)]; Obeng Comfort v Public Prosecutor [2017] 1 SLR \n633 (\u201cObeng Comfort\u201d) at [35]\u2013[37].  \n17 Sections 18(1) and 18(2) of the MDA provide as follows:\nPresumption of possession and knowledge of controlled \ndrugs \n18.\u2014(1)  Any person who is proved to have had in his \npossession or custody or under his control \u2014\n(a) anything containing a controlled drug; \n(b) the keys of anything containing a controlled drug; \n(c) the keys of any place or premises or any part thereof \nin which a controlled drug is found; or \n(d) a document of title relating to a controlled drug or \nany other document intended for the delivery of a \ncontrolled drug, \nshall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have had \nthat drug in his possession. \n(2)  Any person who is proved or presumed to have had a \ncontrolled drug in his possession shall, until the contrary is \nproved, be presumed to have known the nature of that drug. \n18 The element of knowledge \u2013 whether for the element of possession or \nthe element of knowledge of the nature of the drug \u2013 can be satisfied by either \nactual knowledge or wilful blindness.  An accused person is wilfully blind when \nhe did not in fact know the true position but sufficiently suspected it and \ndeliberately refused to investigate, even though he could have done so, in order \nVersion No 1: 22 Jun 2021 (17:53 hrs)\nPP v Muhammad Shafiq bin Shariff[2021] SGHC 150\n10to avoid confirmation of his own suspicions.  Wilful blindness is thus a mental \nstate that, factually, falls short of actual knowledge, but which is treated as its \nlegal equivalent: see Adili at [41]\u2013[50]; Gobi at [98(c)].\n19 The main contest between the Prosecution and the Defence is whether \nthe element of possession is satisfied in this case.  In particular, the parties \ndispute whether Shafiq has successfully rebutted the s 18(1)(a) presumption that \nhe knowingly possessed the methamphetamine in the blue milk powder box and \nwhether he was wilfully blind as to the existence of the methamphetamine in \nthe blue milk powder box.  If the element of possession is satisfied, the other \nissue is whether Shafiq has successfully rebutted the s 18(2) presumption that \nhe knew the nature of the drug, ie whether he knew that the \u201cthings\u201d in the blue \nmilk powder box were methamphetamine.\n20 I should also add that Shafiq accepts that he knowingly imported the \necstacy tablets into Singapore.  But that is the subject of a separate charge of \nimportation under s 7 of the MDA, which has been stood down, pending the \ntrial of the present charge.  Shafiq also accepts that he knowingly imported the \n0.97g of methamphetamine in exhibit \u201cA1A1-A1\u201d (the small packet of ice) in \nthe orange biscuit packet into Singapore.  \nShafiq\u2019s evidence\n21 Shafiq elected to give evidence in his own defence.  He explained in his \nevidence that the blue milk powder box, which contained the four packets of \nmethamphetamine, belonged to one Husir Khan bin Fidah Hussein (\u201cHusir\u201d), \nwhom he referred to as \u201cBaba\u201d, someone with whom he had been acquainted \nVersion No 1: 22 Jun 2021 (17:53 hrs)\nPP v Muhammad Shafiq bin Shariff[2021] SGHC 150\n11for about six months.  He had met Husir for the first time sometime in mid-2017 \nat a mutual friend\u2019s flat.19  \n22 One of Shafiq\u2019s hobbies is playing online jackpot games on his mobile \nphone.  He started with a gaming application called \u201cACE333\u201d, but then moved \non to another one called \u201cSCR888\u201d.  It was Husir who introduced Shafiq to \n\u201cSCR888\u201d and taught him how to use it.  Husir told him that SCR888 was easy \nto \u201chack\u201d, and that one could win large sums of money from SCR888 \nregularly.20       \n23 In his evidence, Shafiq described how SCR888 worked.  Husir had put \nShafiq in contact with a person, described as an \u201cagent\u201d, who then sent Shafiq \na link.  With that link, Shafiq could download the SCR888 application to his \nmobile phone.  Shafiq then created an account on the SCR888 application, and \nobtained a user ID and password to log on to the application.21\n24 The \u201cagent\u201d also added Shafiq to a WhatsApp chat group. To start \ngambling using SCR888, Shafiq needed credits in his account.  He would \ninform the \u201cagent\u201d via WhatsApp that he wanted to deposit money to obtain \ncredits.  Shafiq would then transfer money to a bank account, the details of \nwhich had been provided by the \u201cagent\u201d via WhatsApp.  Following this, his \nSCR888 account would be topped up with credits.  If he won on his gambling \non SCR888, his credits in his account would increase.  But, if he lost, his credits \nwould be depleted.22  \n19 Transcript, 12 August 2020, p 5 lines 1\u20133 and p 6 lines 15\u201326.\n20 Transcript, 12 August 2020, p 6 line 32\u2013p 7 line 3.\n21 Transcript, 12 August 2020, p 7 line 9\u2013p 8 line 13.\n22 Transcript, 12 August 2020, p 8 line 14\u2013p 10 line 6.\nVersion No 1: 22 Jun 2021 (17:53 hrs)\nPP v Muhammad Shafiq bin Shariff[2021] SGHC 150\n1225 To withdraw his winnings from his SCR888 account, Shafiq gave \nevidence that he would have to inform the \u201cagent\u201d via WhatsApp that he wished \nto withdraw a specified sum, and he would also provide the \u201cagent\u201d with the \nreceiving bank account details.  The credits in his account would be deducted, \nand correspondingly, the money would then be deposited into his bank \naccount.23               \n26 Shafiq\u2019s evidence is that he played jackpot games on the SCR888 \napplication.  This was consistent with his statements to the CNB.  But, in his \noral evidence, Shafiq claims that it was also possible to play \u201clive casino\u201d games \non the application.24  The significance of this evidence will be elaborated upon \nlater.    \n27 It is not disputed that Husir had left Singapore on 26 October 2017 and \nhas not returned since then.  Husir had informed Shafiq that he was wanted by \nthe CNB, and that was why he decided to live in Malaysia instead.  In November \n2017, Husir was living with his family in a rented condominium unit in Danga \nBay, Johor, Malaysia.25 \nThe first trip to Johor\n28 On 11 November 2017, Shafiq had travelled to Johor to meet up with \nHusir.

It was open-concept in the sense that there was no physical wall \nbetween the living room, dining area and the kitchen, but there was a door \nleading to the bedroom and the toilet.28  There, Shafiq met Rahilme Khan bin \nHusir Khan (\u201cRahilme\u201d), Husir\u2019s oldest son, for the first time.29  Rahilme was \n18 years old at the time of the trial.30  \n30 Husir and Shafiq played the jackpot game on SCR888 until about \n10.41am.31  Shafiq then took his leave to return to Singapore.

Husir asked Shafiq \nto bring these items back to Singapore and hand them to Husir\u2019s friend.

During the second trip, \nHusir had given him these pills and asked him to bring them to Singapore to \npass them to Alan.  Shafiq agreed to do so.  He hid the ecstacy pills in his \njacket.50  \n43 At about 5.45pm later that day, Alan contacted Shafiq and arranged to \nmeet with him.  When they met, Shafiq handed the 100 ecstacy pills to Alan.  \nShafiq\u2019s evidence is that he was handed cash by Alan, but he could not recall \nhow much.  He also could not recall whether the money was for him or whether \nhe had to pass the cash to Husir.51\n44 Shafiq was in possession of Husir\u2019s ATM card at this time.

As it turned out, \nthe market was closed.  Rohaizat then drove them to a convenience store \nbecause he wanted to buy milk for his son.  When they arrived at the store\u2019s \nlocation, Rohaizat and Aidil alighted and went inside to get the milk.  Shafiq \nand Husir remained in the car.  Shafiq then saw Rohaizat and Aidil exiting the \nstore with a red plastic bag.  When they got into the car, Shafiq saw a blue Nestle \n\u201cLactogen\u201d milk powder box in the red plastic bag, which looked like the one \nhe had in his possession when he was later arrested.  However, he cannot be \nsure that it was the very same milk powder box because he was focused on \nplaying jackpot while he was in the car.68     \n64 Transcript, 19 October 2020, p 59 lines 1\u201325; AB p 259 at [65].\n65 Transcript, 14 August 2020, p 68 lines 11\u201314.\n66 Transcript, 20 October 2020, p 28 line 2\u2013p 29 line 30; Transcript, 14 August 2020, \np 68 line 18\u2013p 70 line 12.\n67 Transcript, 20 October 2020, p 64 lines 20\u201321.\n68 AB pp 203\u2013204 at [13]\u2013[14]; Transcript, 12 August 2020, p 23 line 1\u2013p 24 line 30.\nVersion No 1: 22 Jun 2021 (17:53 hrs)\nPP v Muhammad Shafiq bin Shariff[2021] SGHC 150\n2154 The four men returned to Husir\u2019s condominium unit at about 9.00am.69  \nAidil placed the plastic bag containing the milk powder box near the kitchen \ncabinet.  All of them continued to play jackpot and casino on SCR888 in the \nliving room.70  They also consumed methamphetamine again.71\n55 Then, Husir called Shafiq to the dining table.  He asked Shafiq whether \nhe would bring some ecstacy pills to one of his friends in Singapore.  Husir said \nthat they should get in touch with each other after Shafiq arrives in Singapore \nso that Husir can inform Shafiq of where and how Shafiq should pass the ecstacy \npills to Husir\u2019s \u201cfriend\u201d.  Husir did not mention if Shafiq was supposed to collect \nany money in exchange for the ecstacy pills.  Shafiq agreed.  Shafiq saw that \nthe ecstacy pills were packed in a small plastic packet, which was placed in \nanother slightly larger plastic packet.  Husir then said that he was giving Shafiq \n1g of methamphetamine as his \u201cration\u201d for bringing his share of the SCR888 \nwinnings to Johor, and for helping him bring the ecstacy pills to Singapore.  This \nwas in another small plastic packet, which Husir placed within the slightly larger \nplastic packet, which held the small packet of ecstacy pills.72  It is not in dispute \nthat these drugs were the ones that were eventually found in exhibit \u201cA1A\u201d that \nShafiq had in his possession when he was arrested (see [ 8] above).\n56 Shafiq wanted to conceal the slightly larger packet containing the small \npacket of ice and the packet of ecstacy pills somewhere in his jacket.  However, \nHusir told him that there might be a \u201cspot check\u201d, and said that he would help \nShafiq conceal the small packet of ice and the ecstacy pills.  He took the drugs \n69 Transcript, 14 August 2020, p 75 line 32\u2013p 76 line 1.\n70 Transcript, 12 August 2020, p 25 lines 1\u20133.\n71 Transcript, 19 October 2020, p 30 lines 1\u201312; AB p 259 at [65].\n72 Transcript, 12 August 2020, p 25 lines 19\u201327 and p 30 line 3\u2013p 31 line 9; AB pp 259\u2013\n260 at [60]\u2013[65].\nVersion No 1: 22 Jun 2021 (17:53 hrs)\nPP v Muhammad Shafiq bin Shariff[2021] SGHC 150\n22back from Shafiq.  At this point, Shafiq then left the dining table and went back \nto the living room sofa to continue consuming ice and playing on SCR888.73           \n57 According to Shafiq, Rohaizat then left the unit.  Shafiq\u2019s evidence is \nthat Husir was at the kitchen, but he did not know or pay attention to what Husir \nwas doing there.  He was not involved in, and did not see, the packing of the \necstacy pills and the small packet of ice.  He also did not see any other drugs in \nthe apartment.74\n58 At around 10.45am, Chan arrived with his car at the condominium to \npick up Shafiq and Aidil.75  This had been arranged by Shafiq that morning.  \nWhen Shafiq was leaving the condominium unit with Aidil, Husir took a big \nred plastic bag from the top of the kitchen cabinet and passed it to Shafiq.  This \nbag contained the blue milk powder box and the orange biscuit packet.  Shafiq \nasked Husir where the ecstacy pills and methamphetamine were, and Husir \nreplied, \u201cthe things are already inside\u201d.  By this, Shafiq understood that the \necstacy pills and methamphetamine were in the plastic bag.76  \n59 According to Shafiq, he only took a quick look at the contents of the \nplastic bag.  He did not examine or check the blue milk powder box and\/or the \norange biscuit packet because he was in a rush to get downstairs as Chan was \nwaiting.77  In his statements to the CNB and in his oral evidence, Shafiq gave \ninconsistent versions as to whether he believed that the ecstacy pills and \n73 Transcript, 12 August 2020, p 25 lines 29\u201331.\n74 Transcript, 12 August 2020, p 26 line 2\u2013p 30 line 8.\n75 AB p 175 at [7].\n76 Transcript, 19 October 2020, p 20 lines 4\u201311; Transcript, 12 August 2020, p 31 \nline 10\u2013p 32 line 17; AB p 259 at [61].\n77 Transcript, 12 August 2020, p 5 line 12, p 26 lines 12\u201330 and p 32 lines 20\u201323.\nVersion No 1: 22 Jun 2021 (17:53 hrs)\nPP v Muhammad Shafiq bin Shariff[2021] SGHC 150\n23methamphetamine were inside or outside the blue milk powder box and\/or the \norange biscuit packet.  The Prosecution describes Shafiq\u2019s evidence on this \npoint as a \u201ckey inconsistency\u201d.  I will explore this later in the course of this \njudgment.\n60 When he left the condominium unit, Shafiq also took Rahilme\u2019s luggage \nbag with him.  This luggage bag, the red plastic bag handed to him by Husir, \nand the rest of his and Aidil\u2019s belongings were placed in the boot of Chan\u2019s car.  \nWhile on the way, he asked Chan to stop at a mini-mart.  There, Shafiq bought \na packet of instant noodles and a packet of biscuits.  These were in another \nsmaller red plastic bag that was also placed in the boot of the car (see [ 5] above).\n61 As already described (at [ 6] above), Shafiq was arrested at the \nWoodlands Checkpoint.\nShafiq\u2019s statements to the CNB\n62 In the course of investigations, Shafiq gave a total of 14 statements to \nthe CNB.  There were three contemporaneous statements, eight long statements \nand three cautioned statements.  The Prosecution relies on these statements to \nshow that Shafiq has changed his version of events along the way, as more and \nmore incriminating evidence was presented to him.  As such, the Prosecution \nsays that he has shown himself quite capable of lying to the CNB and is not a \nperson who has credibility.\n63 Shafiq does not challenge the voluntariness of all his statements to the \nCNB, as explicitly stated in the Agreed Statement of Facts.  In the Agreed \nStatement of Facts, Shafiq also agreed that all the statements were recorded \nVersion No 1: 22 Jun 2021 (17:53 hrs)\nPP v Muhammad Shafiq bin Shariff[2021] SGHC 150\n24accurately.78  However, when he was cross-examined, Shafiq tried to explain \naway some of the inconsistencies between his statements and his oral evidence \non the basis that the recorder of the statements, who was the investigating \nofficer, IO Parthiban, had misunderstood him.\nContemporaneous statements on 14 November 2017\n64 In his contemporaneous statements recorded on 14 November 2017,79 \nShafiq claimed that the blue milk powder box contained \u201cSusu C\u201d (ie, milk \npowder) and that it belonged to \u201cHelmi\u201d (ie, Rahilme).  Shafiq claimed that \nRahilme asked him to bring Rahilme\u2019s clothes and a red plastic bag containing \n\u201cinfant powder\u201d into Singapore to pass to Rahilme.  Shafiq took the red plastic \nbag from \u201cBaba\u201d, Helmi\u2019s father (ie, Husir), at Rahilme\u2019s unit in Johor, \nMalaysia.  Husir told Shafiq to bring a luggage (containing Rahilme\u2019s clothes) \nand the red plastic bag with \u201cbaby formula\u201d to Singapore, and that either \nRahilme or someone else would collect the red plastic bag.  In the \ncontemporaneous statements, Shafiq was not asked about the orange biscuit \npacket and the ecstacy contained in it.\nThe first seven long statements from 15 November 2017 to 28 May 2018\n65 In gist, the first seven long statements recorded from Shafiq set out the \nfollowing version of events.  Shafiq and Rahilme \u2013 who Shafiq referred to as \n\u201cAbang\u201d in the statements \u2013 went to Rahilme\u2019s house in Johor Bahru the night \nprior to the offence to \u201cslack\u201d and play a jackpot game, and for Shafiq to pass \n$9,200 cash to Rahilme\u2019s father, Husir.  Shafiq and Rahilme went to Rahilme\u2019s \nhouse from Shafiq\u2019s flat in Singapore at about 3am (on 14 November 2017) by \n78 ASOF at [12]\u2013[13], [16] and [33].\n79 AB pp 142\u2013146.\nVersion No 1: 22 Jun 2021 (17:53 hrs)\nPP v Muhammad Shafiq bin Shariff[2021] SGHC 150\n25a \u201cprivate taxi\u201d \u2013 driven by Chan \u2013 arranged by Husir.  Aidil also came along \nwith Shafiq and Rahilme.  After arriving at Rahilme\u2019s house and having some \nfood, Rahilme left with Rahilme\u2019s uncle, Rohaizat, to the latter\u2019s house.  \n66 Subsequently, at about 7\u20138am, Shafiq and Aidil accompanied Husir and \nRohaizat to a nearby Indian \u201cmama\u201d shop.  There, Husir asked Aidil to help buy \n\u2018Lactogen\u2019 milk, which was for Rohaizat\u2019s son.  Shafiq and Husir stayed in the \ncar while Aidil and Rohaizat went to buy milk.  They came back in about 10 \nminutes and Aidil was carrying a small red plastic bag with the milk box inside.  \nAfter arriving back at Rahilme\u2019s house, Aidil put the milk box in the kitchen \ncabinet, and they continued to play the jackpot game.  \n67 At about 9am, Aidil and Shafiq wanted to go back home.  While Husir \ntried calling for a \u201cprivate taxi\u201d again, \u201cno one picked up\u201d, so Shafiq called the \nnumber on the name card which Chan had given him.  Chan then called Shafiq \nback to make the transport arrangements.  Shafiq then saw Rahilme\u2019s luggage \n\u201cof dirty clothes\u201d in Rahilme\u2019s home, so Shafiq asked Husir if he could bring \nRahilme\u2019s clothes to his house in Singapore to wash.  Husir agreed but also \nasked Shafiq to bring the red plastic bag containing the blue milk powder box \nand the orange biscuit packet with him to Singapore.  Shafiq could tell that the \nred plastic bag was different from the red plastic bag that Aidil had before, but \nShafiq \u201cwas rushing\u201d and so \u201cnever think so much\u201d.  Shafiq could also see the \ncontents of the red plastic bag.  Shafiq opened the boot of the car and put the \nred plastic bag in the boot.80 Shafiq was not paid by Husir to help him.81 \n80 AB pp 202\u2013205; AB pp 240\u2013242.\n81 AB p 243 at A27.\nVersion No 1: 22 Jun 2021 (17:53 hrs)\nPP v Muhammad Shafiq bin Shariff[2021] SGHC 150\n2668 Shafiq stated that he \u201cnever touch\u201d the orange biscuit packet and that he \nthought that exhibit \u201cA1A1-A1\u201d (the small packet of ice) in the orange biscuit \npacket contained methamphetamine, though he was \u201cnot sure\u201d.  He did not \nknow what exhibit \u201cA1A1-A2A\u201d (the plastic packet of ecstacy pills) from the \norange biscuit packet was.82  Shafiq also had \u201cnot touched\u201d the blue milk \npowder box before.  He knew that the \u201cwhite thing\u201d in the packets in the blue \nmilk powder box were methamphetamine, but he claimed they were not his and \nhe did not see them until his arrest.83  He did not suspect that there were drugs \nin the orange biscuit packet and blue milk powder box.84\n69 Shafiq did find it suspicious that Husir asked him, and not Rahilme, to \nbring the blue milk powder box and orange biscuit packet to Singapore, and \nShafiq did question Husir about this.  Husir explained to Shafiq that Rahilme \n\u201cwill be coming back late to Singapore\u201d.85  Shafiq is \u201cnot close\u201d to Rahilme and \nhad only known him for \u201ca few months\u201d.  Shafiq got to know Rahilme through \na mutual friend called \u201cFaris\u201d who plays in the same soccer team as Shafiq.  \nShafiq does not know if Rahilme is involved in drugs.

Shafiq gave his cautioned \nstatement that same day from 5.17pm to 5.30pm.  In that statement, he stated \nthat he wanted to \u201cask for leniency from the judge if [he] was \u2018sabo\u2019 by \u2018Baba\u2019\u201d \n(ie, Husir).  He is \u201cnot the person who will smuggle drugs into Singapore\u201d.  He \n\u201creally thought that it was milk and biscuits in the red plastic bag and did not \nknow there were drugs inside\u201d.89\nSecond cautioned statement on 1 June 2018\n72 However, after the first seven long statements were given, in his \ncautioned statement recorded on 1 June 2018 in response to a charge of \nimporting not less than 10.88g of MDMA, Shafiq admitted that he \u201ckn[e]w \nabout the packet of 105 tablets and the 1 gram of Ice that was inside the orange \nbiscuit packet\u201d.  He \u201cwas supposed to pass the Ecstacy tablets to someone who \nwill come to [his] house to pick it up \u2026 The 1 gram of Ice is for [his] own ration \nbecause [he] help Abang father bring the cash from Singapore to Malaysia and \n87 AB p 251 at A5.\n88 AB p 252 at A7.\n89 AB p 214.\nVersion No 1: 22 Jun 2021 (17:53 hrs)\nPP v Muhammad Shafiq bin Shariff[2021] SGHC 150\n28also to bring the Ecstacy tablet from Malaysia.\u201d  In that cautioned statement, \nShafiq also stated that he is \u201csorry\u201d, regretful, and pleaded for leniency.90\nEighth long statement on 2 June 2018\n73 Shafiq\u2019s eighth long statement recorded after his admission regarding \nthe drugs in the orange biscuit packet is critical in that it is largely consistent \nwith his oral evidence in court outlined above.  In gist, Shafiq stated the \nfollowing in this eighth long statement.\n(a) Husir was the one who asked him to bring the ecstacy tablets into \nSingapore to pass to \u201csomeone\u201d as a \u201cfavour\u201d.  Husir said that he would \ncall Shafiq and tell him who to pass them to when Shafiq reached his \nhouse in Singapore.  This was the same as what Husir told Shafiq when \nShafiq brought food items for Husir on 11 November 2017.  Shafiq did \nnot admit this in his previous investigative statements as he \u201cwas \nshocked\u201d and \u201cwas really scared at that time\u201d.\n(b) Husir said that he would pack the ecstacy tablets, and Shafiq did \nnot know or see how Husir packed them.  Husir simply passed the red \nplastic bag to Shafiq and informed Shafiq that \u201cthe things are already \ninside\u201d.  From this, Shafiq knew that the ecstacy tablets and the 1g of \nice were inside but he did not know whether \u201cit was in the [blue] milk \npowder box or the [orange] biscuit packet\u201d.  Shafiq did not open and \ncheck the blue milk powder box and orange biscuit packet since they \nwere already packed by Husir.  \n(c) Shafiq\u2019s DNA was found in the packet because he \u201ch[e]ld the \npackets to see what it is\u201d.  At the time, he did not know what it was as \n90 AB p 255.\nVersion No 1: 22 Jun 2021 (17:53 hrs)\nPP v Muhammad Shafiq bin Shariff[2021] SGHC 150\n29he had never taken ecstacy tablets before.  It was Husir who told Shafiq \nthat they were ecstacy tablets before Shafiq passed the packet back to \nHusir.  \n(d) Husir also told Shafiq that he would give him a \u201cgift\u201d of 1g of \nice as a reward for bringing the ecstacy tablets into Singapore and for \nhelping him to bring his cash from Singapore to Malaysia.  \n(e) Shafiq helped Husir to bring the ecstacy tablets into Singapore \nbecause he helped Shafiq with the jackpot game and taught him how to \nplay and win money with it. \n(f) This was \u201cthe only time\u201d Shafiq had helped Husir import drugs \ninto Singapore. \n(g) Shafiq knew that drug importation is a \u201cserious offence\u201d, but he \ndid it for Husir \u201cas a favour as [Husir] helped [Shafiq] before\u201d.\n74 I will deal with the inconsistencies in Shafiq\u2019s statements and his \nexplanations for these inconsistencies when I deal with the contested issues of \nfact below.\nHas the s 18(1)(a) presumption been rebutted?\nRequirements of s 18(1)(a)\n75 As mentioned at [ 16] above, the legal burden is on the accused person \nto adduce sufficient evidence to rebut the s 18(1) presumption on a balance of \nprobabilities.  In this regard, it is well established that an accused person\u2019s bare \ndenial is insufficient to rebut the statutory presumptions in the MDA or cause \nthe evidential burden to shift to the Prosecution: see, eg, Beh Chew Boo at [64].  \nHowever, the \u201cinherent difficulties of proving a negative\u201d must also be borne in \nVersion No 1: 22 Jun 2021 (17:53 hrs)\nPP v Muhammad Shafiq bin Shariff[2021] SGHC 150\n30mind so that the burden of rebutting the relevant presumption \u201cshould not be \nmade so onerous that it becomes virtually impossible to discharge\u201d: Harven a\/l \nSegar v Public Prosecutor [2017] 1 SLR 771 at [2].  \n76 It is also well established that, while the legal burden remains on one \nparty throughout, the evidential burden on any specific factual issue can shift to \nthe opposing party once it has been discharged by the proponent. The opposing \nparty must then call evidence or take the consequences, which may or may not \nbe adverse.  The Prosecution\u2019s failure to a call a material witness may mean that \nit had failed to discharge its evidential burden to rebut an accused person\u2019s \ndefence or may justify the court drawing an adverse inference against it under \ns 116 illustration (g) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (\u201cEA\u201d): see \nMuhammad Nabill bin Mohd Fuad v Public Prosecutor [2020] 1 SLR 984 \n(\u201cNabill\u201d) at [67]\u2013[72].  Thus, if I find, on an assessment of Shafiq\u2019s evidence, \nthat his contention that he did not know that the blue milk powder box contained \nmethamphetamine is plausible, then the evidential burden would shift to the \nProsecution to rebut Shafiq\u2019s evidence.  \n77 It was also stressed by the majority of the Court of"}

Accordingly, I shall outline the relationship between the defendants, Mr Lee Wan Hoi (\u201cMr Lee\u201d), and Mr Yip Wui Kuen (\u201cMr Yip\u201d) which started off well, until they liquidated their joint property investment in Australia in 2000. Thereafter, disputes between the defendants and Mr Lee arose. Mr Choo submits that he offered his consultancy services to the defendants in this context.', '9\\u2003Most of the background facts were set out by Belinda Ang Saw Ean J (as she then was) in Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd v Ding Pei Chai and others [2004] 3 SLR(R) 489 (Originating Summons No 902 of 2002) (\u201cANZ v Ding\u201d), a related case. Thus, I shall refer to the relevant paragraphs of ANZ v Ding where appropriate.', '10\\u2003The defendants and Mr Lee were initially business associates and friends. In 1993 and 1994, they collaborated to invest in and develop several properties in Melbourne, Australia (the \u201cMelbourne Properties\u201d). The Melbourne Properties were held through two trust companies incorporated in the British Virgin Islands (the \u201cBVI\u201d). These were SEAA Enterprises Pty Limited Trust (\u201cSEPLT\u201d) and SEAA Properties Trust (\u201cSPT\u201d) (collectively, the \u201cTrusts\u201d). The Trusts were managed by SEAA Enterprises Pty Limited, a company incorporated in Australia (the \u201cTrustee Company\u201d). Mr Lee held 60% of the beneficial interest in the investment and the defendants each held 20%. 16', 'At all material times, Mr Lee was the managing director and chairman of the Trustee Company, while the defendants were passive investors (see ANZ v Ding at [4] and [7]).', '11\\u2003In or around June 1998, the defendants and Mr Lee agreed to contribute working capital for the investments in the Melbourne Properties in the same proportions as their beneficial interests: 60% from Mr Lee, and 20% each from the defendants. 17', '12\\u2003To raise funds for his 60% share of the working capital, on or around 17 June 1998, Mr Lee entered into an agreement to sell 14 million ordinary shares and 4 million options of Atech to Mr Yip and his nominees, Mr Xiao Yongle and Tartan Capital Limited, for A$3.65m (the \u201cYip Atech Shares Transaction\u201d). Ms Mei Leong, a lawyer at M\/s Mei Leong, Lam & Co (\u201cM\/s Mei Leong\u201d), which was then a law firm in Hong Kong, acted for Mr Yip and his nominees. 18', 'Under this agreement, Mr Yip and\/or his nominees paid A$750,000 to Phillip Securities to be held as a deposit for the Yip Atech Shares Transaction. 19', '13\\u2003Subsequently, in or around December 1998, Mr Yip and his nominees agreed to accept 3.4 million Atech shares (the \u201c3.4 million Yip Atech Shares\u201d) as part-performance of the Yip Atech Shares Transaction, in exchange for an advance payment of A$820,000 from Mr Yip (the \u201cA$820,000 Advance\u201d). Accordingly, in or around January 1999, the scrips for the 3.4 million Yip Atech Shares were delivered to M\/s Mei Leong and Mr Yip paid the A$820,000 Advance to Mr Lee. 20', 'However, M\/s Mei Leong were unable to effect the transfer of the 3.4 million Yip Atech Shares because, around that time, the Atech shares became scripless and could only be transferred electronically. 21', 'At this point, Mr Phua got involved in this transaction. and executed two letters of indemnity dated 15 January 1999 and 8 July 1999 in favour of Mr Yip and his nominees in relation to the delivery of the 3.4 million Yip Atech Shares and the return of the A$820,000 Advance (the \u201cLetters of Indemnity\u201d). 22', '14\\u2003The Yip Atech Shares Transaction was eventually aborted in or around December 1999. 23', 'Subsequently, on 15 October 2001, Mr Phua and M\/s Mei Leong (acting on behalf of Mr Yip and his nominees) entered into a settlement agreement regarding the Letters of Indemnity (the \u201c2001 Mei Leong Settlement Agreement\u201d). 24', 'Under cll 1\u20133 of the 2001 Mei Leong Settlement Agreement Mr Phua was relieved of his obligations under the Letters of Indemnity; a settlement sum of A$900,000 was to be paid to Mr Yip; and the physical scrips of the 3.4 million Yip Atech Shares were to be returned to Mr Phua. With regard to the settlement sum of A$900,000, A$820,000 had already been set aside by the defendants and Mr Lee to repay Mr Yip (as I shall explain further at [18] below), and the balance of A$80,000 was to be paid by the defendants. 25', 'However, as I shall elaborate on shortly, the actual repayment of the A$820,000 did not go smoothly.', '15\\u2003The sum of A$750,000, which was initially paid by Mr Yip and\/or his nominees to Phillip Securities pursuant to his agreement with Mr Lee (see [12] above), eventually became the subject of interpleader proceedings before the High Court in Originating Summons No 601786 of 2001 (the \u201cOS 601 Interpleader Proceedings\u201d). The OS 601 Interpleader Proceedings were commenced on 30 November 2001. On the advice of Mr Choo, the defendants were represented by JC Ho & Kang LLC (\u201cJCHK\u201d) in the OS 601 Interpleader Proceedings. 26', 'I shall describe how Mr Choo came to be involved at [28] below. The OS 601 Interpleader Proceedings were eventually settled in February 2004 with the A$750,000 being fully returned to Mr Yip and\/or his nominees. 27', '16\\u2003At this point, I return briefly to the year 2000. The Melbourne Properties were sold in or around July 2000 for about A$15m, and the sale was completed on 28 September 2000. 28', 'On or around 3 October 2000, Mr Lee made unauthorised transfers of about A$8.4m from the sale proceeds of the Melbourne Properties to various accounts under his control. 29', 'Thereafter, from 25 to 27 October 2000, Mr Lee returned A$5.25m out of the A$8.4m to the defendants and himself in the proportion of 20%, 20%, and 60% respectively. This was the return of the capital that they had invested in the Melbourne Properties. 30', '17\\u2003The defendants were initially unaware of the unauthorised transfers made by Mr Lee at the time the transfers were made. The defendants only found out about these transfers one or two months later, after their capital had been returned to them. 31', 'Even after the return of the capital, there were still moneys under Mr Lee\u2019s control which he refused to remit to the Trustee Company (see ANZ v Ding at [13]). This gave rise to disputes between the defendants and Mr Lee who refused to disclose the accounting records showing the expenses and sale proceeds from the Melbourne Properties. 32', '18\\u2003On 8 December 2000, the defendants and Mr Lee entered into an agreement to set aside A$1.8m of the sale proceeds from the Melbourne Properties to meet various contingent liabilities arising from their investments in the Melbourne Properties and the Yip Atech Shares Transaction. In or around January 2001, this sum of A$1.8m was deposited in an Asian Currency Unit account (the \u201cACU Account\u201d) placed with the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited, Singapore branch (\u201cANZ Bank\u201d). I shall refer to the moneys in the ACU Account as the \u201cACU Account Moneys\u201d. The accountholder of the ACU Account was Gracedale Technology Limited (\u201cGracedale\u201d), a BVI company. 33', 'The original authorised signatories of the ACU Account were Mr Lee and his wife in one group, and Mr Ding\u2019s nominee and Mr Phua in the other (see ANZ v Ding at [11]).', '19\\u2003Out of the ACU Account Moneys, a sum of A$820,000 was set aside to meet any potential claims by M\/s Mei Leong or its clients in connection with the Yip Atech Shares Transaction. 34', 'Specifically, Mr Yip had a potential claim against Mr Phua under the 8 July 1999 Letter of Indemnity for the return of the A$820,000 Advance he had paid to Mr Lee in January 1999 (see ANZ v Ding at [14]). The remaining A$1m of the ACU Account Moneys was set aside for capital gains and related taxes 35', 'as well as other miscellaneous expenses such as foreign exchange losses and legal costs (see ANZ v Ding at [14]). 36', '20\\u2003On 8 December 2000, Mr Lee also agreed to make available to the defendants the financial accounts of the two Trusts. In December 2001, Mr Ding requested the auditing of these financial accounts and the inspection of the financial records of the Trustee Company. However, Mr Lee was not forthcoming with the audited accounts and the financial records. This led the defendants to assert control over Gracedale and the ACU Account in March 2002 by removing Mr Lee\u2019s wife as a director of Gracedale and withdrawing Mr Lee and his wife as authorised signatories of the ACU Account (see ANZ v Ding at [9] and [15]\u2013[29]).', '21\\u2003Subsequently, around June 2002, the defendants instructed ANZ Bank to remit A$820,000 of the ACU Account Moneys to M\/s Mei Leong and A$150,000 to Mr Choo for his consultancy services. However, these instructions were countermanded by Mr Lee\u2019s wife. These conflicting instructions led ANZ Bank to file for interpleader relief in Originating Summons No 902 of 2002 (the \u201cOS 902 Interpleader Proceedings\u201d) on 1 July 2002. 37', 'On the advice of Mr Choo, the defendants were also represented by JCHK in the OS 902 Interpleader Proceedings. 38', '22\\u2003The issue to be decided in the OS 902 Interpleader Proceedings was who had the authority to act for and on behalf of Gracedale in operating the ACU Account. The defendants\u2019 position was that Mr Lee had agreed to relinquish control of Gracedale and the ACU Account to them. Hence, they had the authority to act for and on behalf of Gracedale in operating the ACU Account. Therefore, they had the authority to pay the A$820,000 to M\/s Mei Leong as Mr Lee had previously agreed to this payment (see ANZ v Ding at [10]). On the other hand, Mr Lee\u2019s wife argued that she and Mr Lee had never agreed to cede control of Gracedale and the ACU Account to the defendants (see ANZ v Ding at [11]).', '23\\u2003The OS 902 Interpleader Proceedings culminated in the judgment of Ang J (as she then was) in ANZ v Ding, which was delivered on 30 June 2004. In that judgment, Ang J found that there was indeed an agreement by Mr Lee to entrust control of Gracedale and the ACU Account to the defendants, such that they had authority to act for and on behalf of Gracedale in operating the ACU Account. However, Ang J ordered that the ACU Account Moneys were to be retained in the ACU Account until further order. This was because there were other unresolved issues which had to be determined with reference to Gracedale\u2019s articles of association and the laws of the BVI, which were outside the scope of those proceedings. In particular, whether 144 Gracedale bearer shares had been properly issued on 24 July 2001 (see ANZ v Ding at [57]\u2013[58] and [61]). 39', '24\\u2003Subsequently, in or around 2007, the defendants commenced proceedings against Mr Lee in the Federal Court of Australia to compel Mr Lee to produce the audited financial accounts of the two Trusts (the \u201cAustralian Proceedings\u201d). On the advice of Mr Choo, the defendants were represented by M\/s Harding & Co in the Australian Proceedings. The Australian Proceedings concluded in or around March 2008 with a court order for Mr Lee to produce the accounts sought by the defendants. 40', '25\\u2003On or around 18 October 2012, the defendants commenced proceedings against Mr Lee and Gracedale in the High Court of the BVI to seek ratification of the issuance of the 144 Gracedale bearer shares (the \u201cBVI Proceedings\u201d). On the advice of Mr Choo, the defendants were represented by M\/s Farara Kerins in the BVI Proceedings. The BVI Proceedings concluded on or around 9 July 2013, when the defendants and Mr Lee agreed to stay these proceedings and have their disputes determined by the Singapore courts. 41', '26\\u2003On or around 16 April 2014, the defendants commenced Suit No 420 of 2014 in the High Court against Mr Lee (\u201cS 420\u201d). S 420 was the defendants\u2019 claim against Mr Lee for, inter alia, breach of fiduciary duties and for the recovery of the ACU Account Moneys.

The TOP was issued on 29 July 2020.', '48\\u2003On 15 October 2020, Exklusiv informed the Club\u2019s members that, among other things: 44', '(a)\\u2003The Club would be resuming operations at the Laguna Club\u2019s premises in December 2020 and the memberships would be extended to 15 December 2040.', '(b)\\u2003The usual transfer and administrative fees for the transfer or sale of memberships would be waived for two years following the Club\u2019s resumption of operations.', '(c)\\u2003The Club had secured a lease at 30SR and there was a plan to convert the space into a \u201csatellite clubhouse\u201d.', '49\\u2003On 16 October 2020, Exklusiv and Oxley Gem entered into a tenancy agreement for a three-year lease of the first floor (with a floor area of 523 sq m) of the now two-storey building on 30SR with an option to renew the lease for another three years. 45', 'The second floor was converted into a gym after Exklusiv decided not to use the building for the Club. 46', 'It was anticipated that the satellite clubhouse would \u201clikely commence operations in the first quarter of 2021\u201d. 47', 'The plan was that the satellite clubhouse would house a bar, library, lounge, karaoke rooms, games\/function room, meeting room and a business centre. 48', '50\\u2003Subsequently, Exklusiv secured complimentary access for the Club\u2019s members to the following facilities at 30SR: the swimming pool and gym (150 members per month), tennis courts (60 bookings per month), and carpark (500 slots per month plus during lunch time and dinner time). 49', 'As these were shared facilities and given the COVID-19 safe distancing measures, these facilities were available to the Club\u2019s members on a first come first served basis.

{"casename":"2021_SGHC_156","fact":"the facts may also fit the other claims.\n16 Yim\u2019s claim is a straightforward one. She gave $300,000 in two cheques \nto Hua to hand to Sovereign Sands as her investment, in return for what Hua \nhad represented as a fixed return of $90,000. Yim did not receive the returns nor \nVersion No 1: 29 Jun 2021 (11:56 hrs)\nYim Lok Foong Elsie v Asia First Star Capital Pte Ltd[2021] SGHC 156\n7her capital. The parties have used the word \u201cguarantee\u201d although it is not found \non any document except the WhatsApp messages between Yim and Hua. It \nseems to me that this was used in a colloquial rather than a legal sense, but for \nthe purposes of this case, I am of the view that it is not relevant because I find \nthat the representation made to Yim was that there would be a fixed return of \n$60,000 and $30,000 for the two Loan Agreements, or investments as Yim \nthought they were. There is no dispute that this is what the two Loan \nAgreements that Hua handed to Yim say, although Hua is now disputing that \nshe had any connections with the Loan Agreements, and that it was a transaction \nbetween Isaac Koo and Yim.\n17 If we accept, as I do, that Yim\u2019s evidence is true, then Hua\u2019s evidence \nmust be examined against Yim\u2019s to see if it is capable of either exonerating her \nfrom the allegations of fraudulent intent on her part, or alternatively, that she \nwas an innocent go-between who was exploited by Isaac Koo. \n18 After several exasperating minutes at trial, Mr Joseph, counsel for Yim, \nfinally understood that I wanted to see the original Loan Agreements for the \n$100,000 and $200,000. Mr Joseph then informed the court that Yim was only \ngiven photocopies of the two Loan Agreements (exhibits P1 and P2). \nMr Selvaraj, counsel for Hua, leapt up and protested that he had all along \nassumed that Yim had the original Loan Agreements. Confusion erupted \nbecause it was not clear then what agreements were signed and who had them. \nConsidering the evidence as a whole, I am now convinced that confusion arose \nbecause Hua was making up a story on the witness stand. \n19 Distilled, Hua\u2019s evidence under cross-examination by Mr Joseph and my \nquestions to understand the evidence, is as follows. Hua met Yim on Friday, \nVersion No 1: 29 Jun 2021 (11:56 hrs)\nYim Lok Foong Elsie v Asia First Star Capital Pte Ltd[2021] SGHC 156\n829 February 2008, at Hua\u2019s house. She was surprised that Yim brought not one \ncheque but two. Hua had only one Loan Agreement and so she asked Yim to \nsign that. Hua also signed it and then kept this for Isaac Koo to sign as well. \nNext, Hua told Isaac Koo that Yim had brought two cheques. Isaac Koo, who \nwas living in the same condominium as Hua, then went to Hua\u2019s house with \nanother Loan Agreement. Hua made a photocopy of this. She then had to \n\u2018blanco\u2019 that photocopy, which does not have Yim\u2019s signature. By that, she \nmeant that she erased the typewritten amount of $100,000 so that $200,000 \ncould be handwritten on it, because all of Isaac Koo\u2019s agreements were \n\u201cstandard\u201d for $100,000. She and Isaac Koo then signed on the Loan \nAgreements. She then gave these two Loan Agreements, signed only by Isaac \nKoo and Hua, to Yim several days later. Both Loan Agreements were issued to \nYim. The first Loan Agreement, with Yim\u2019s wet-ink signature, was kept by \nIsaac Koo\/Sovereign Sands.\n20 A host of questions arose from Hua\u2019s evidence here that were \nunanswerable and thus unanswered. If Hua\u2019s evidence at trial is true, then why \ndid Hua previously say in her Amended Defence that she handed over the two \nLoan Agreements to Yim on the evening of 29 February 2008? And why did \nshe say in her evidence-in-chief that the two Loan Agreements given to Yim \nwere two new Loan Agreements given to her by Isaac Koo, when she said at \ntrial that they were photocopies? Did Hua intend the court to believe that Yim \nleft her two cheques for a total of $300,000 on 29 February 2008 and was given \nnothing as proof of receipt? If Isaac Koo went down to Hua\u2019s place that night, \nwhy did she not ask Yim to wait? If Isaac Koo\u2019s agreements were all \u2018standard\u2019 \nfor $100,000, why was the return of $130,000 for the $100,000 Loan Agreement \nhandwritten and not typed like the rest of the agreement? Why did Hua have to \nVersion No 1: 29 Jun 2021 (11:56 hrs)\nYim Lok Foong Elsie v Asia First Star Capital Pte Ltd[2021] SGHC 156\n9give Yim the photocopied Loan Agreement and the Loan Agreement brought \ndown by Isaac Koo when she could have given Yim two signed duplicates of \nthe Loan Agreements? Hua gave an unconvincing answer as to why she did not \nissue a single Loan Agreement to Yim for $300,000. Since Hua denies knowing \nthat the $100,000 cheque was from Yim\u2019s mother (though the cheque is clearly \nunder Yim\u2019s mother\u2019s name) and issued both the Loan Agreements in Yim\u2019s \nname, she could have issued one Loan Agreement for $300,000 instead since \nshe had plenty of time.\n21 When further pressed, and confronted with the exchange of WhatsApp \nmessages, Hua began to conflate the two Loan Agreements with the previous \ntransactions concerning Global Ariel. Nothing in the evidence supports her \nclaim that the \u2018investment money\u2019 in the messages refers to Global Ariel and \nnot the two Loan Agreements. It is clear to me that Yim was pressing Hua for \nher (Yim\u2019s) $300,000 and profits, and not money due from the Global Ariel \ntransactions which had been paid. Yim also referred to her mother\u2019s money in \nthe WhatsApp messages, which could only have been in relation to Sovereign \nSands, but Hua unpersuasively insisted at trial that she did not know Yim\u2019s \nmother had invested and thought that it was \u2018just a polite excuse\u2019 for Yim to ask \nHua for her Global Ariel investment.\n22 Hua\u2019s conflation of the $390,000 due under the two Loan Agreements \nwith Sovereign Sands with the $154,000 under Global Ariel is intentionally \nmade to explain Hua\u2019s admissions in the WhatsApp messages. The problem was \nthat if Hua was under the impression that Yim was pressing her for the $154,000 \nand not the $390,000, it follows that this was an admission that the $154,000, \non Hua\u2019s own evidence, had not been paid. That is why, in my view, Hua claims \nVersion No 1: 29 Jun 2021 (11:56 hrs)\nYim Lok Foong Elsie v Asia First Star Capital Pte Ltd[2021] SGHC 156\n10that she only knew that Yim was claiming in respect of the Sovereign Sands \nLoan Agreements and not Global Ariel when she (Hua) was at the police station \nin 2015. I do not believe her at all. Yim might have been fooled into thinking \nthere was money to be made investing in a company investing in a coal mine, \nbut I do not think that she was that foolish to part with $300,000 when she had \nnot been paid the $154,000.\n23 It is also not disputed that Yim never met Isaac Koo. Hua, on the other \nhand, was close to him on her own admission, though she claimed a few minutes \nafter saying he was a \u2018good friend\u2019 that she had not called him as her witness as \nthey had fallen out. They had known each other when they were teachers and \nhad registered several companies together. Hua was involved in the transactions \nthat Yim had with Isaac Koo and Sovereign Sands, at the very least, as Isaac \nKoo\u2019s or Sovereign Sands\u2019 agent. Was her involvement more than that? That is \nthe question I will now consider.\n24 Hua knew at all times that Yim does not know either Isaac Koo or \nSovereign Sands. Yim has no information other than what Hua told her. No one \nhands over $300,000 for no reason, and yet Hua denies that she had anything to \ndo with the transaction evidenced by the two documents purporting to be Loan \nAgreements. If, as I have found, Yim\u2019s evidence is true, then I would expect at \nleast a plausible explanation for what Hua did. None was given.\n25 Hua\u2019s evidence is not only incoherent at times, it is also unconvincing. \nHer denial that Yim was asking for the $390,000 in her WhatsApp chat with \nHua, and her attempt to change that into a conversation about the Global Ariel \ntransactions, seems very much an act of desperation. I will not repeat Hua\u2019s \nunconvincing follow-up act claiming that by \u2018funds\u2019 Yim meant the Global \nVersion No 1: 29 Jun 2021 (11:56 hrs)\nYim Lok Foong Elsie v Asia First Star Capital Pte Ltd[2021] SGHC 156\n11Ariel investments, save to make one more point. Under cross-examination, Hua \nsaid that the moment Yim mentioned investments, \u201cI knew straightaway that \n\u201cYes, it\u2019s Global Ariel\u201d, because this is the only investment I signed with her\u201d. \nLater on, she was confronted with the inconvenient truth that if Yim was asking \nfor the Global Ariel money, it must mean that the $154,000 had not been paid. \nThat was when Hua tried to extricate herself by saying that it was only at the \npolice station in 2015 that she realised that Yim had been paid. I am unable to \ngive any credence to Hua\u2019s evidence. She is, now that she has been caught out, \nless wily today than she was in 2008.\n26 Yim\u2019s account requires at least a modicum of honest, plausible \nexplanation from Hua for me to dismiss Yim\u2019s claim against Hua for fraudulent \nmisrepresentation. However, Hua has not only failed to help herself by offering \nthat, but has offered evidence that only fortifies Yim\u2019s claims.\n27 First, Hua claims she went to the police station in 2015 and only then \nlearned that Yim\u2019s messages all concerned Sovereign Sands. Yet, she did not \nimmediately call Yim to clarify their WhatsApp correspondence, despite her \ninsistence that, in her mind, \u2018everything [was] about Global Ariel\u2019. She said at \ntrial that she only spoke to Isaac Koo about this, before repeating she had \nnothing to do with the Sovereign Sands Loan Agreements. She also claims the \ninvestigating officer at the police station had \u2018pull[ed] out a cheque\u2019 to show her \nthat Yim made money from Global Ariel. If that were true, Hua would certainly \nhave been able to say who the payor was, given that she insists it is not her. \nSecond, when Yim\u2019s solicitors wrote a letter of demand to Hua dated 6 April \n2015 claiming $390,000, they did not even mention Sovereign Sands, Asia First \nStar Capital or any Loan Agreements. However, Hua\u2019s lawyers replied on \nVersion No 1: 29 Jun 2021 (11:56 hrs)\nYim Lok Foong Elsie v Asia First Star Capital Pte Ltd[2021] SGHC 156\n127 April 2015, saying that Hua merely collected the cheques on behalf of \nSovereign Sands. They did not object and say that Yim\u2019s only investment with \nHua was her $140,000 investment in Global Ariel, ask what $390,000 sum \nYim\u2019s solicitors were referring to, or correct Yim\u2019s solicitors to say it was a \nloan, rather than an investment. Clearly, Hua always knew exactly what Yim \nwas talking about.\n28 The transactions were ostensibly with Sovereign Sands and thus, in so \nfar as a contract claim is concerned, neither Hua nor Isaac Koo would be liable \nfor breach. It is possible that Hua acted merely as an innocent go-between for \nIsaac Koo; however, if that were the case, she would have joined him as a third \nparty, but she did not. She continued to shield him from having to face legal \naction. As for Yim, it is a mystery why, having pleaded conspiracy, she had not \njoined Isaac Koo as a defendant, despite referring to him in her Statement of \nClaim. In her evidence-in-chief, she says that Isaac Koo was declared bankrupt \nin 2017 and so she was \u201cdenied the opportunity to make any meaningful claim\u201d \nagainst him for his part in the conspiracy. But his evidence would have been \nhighly relevant to this suit.\n29 Nonetheless, the evidence showing that Hua was colluding with Isaac \nKoo is sufficiently strong, and without any evidence to the contrary, I find that \nshe and Isaac Koo acted in conspiracy to deprive Yim of her $300,000 with no \nintention of paying her that or the $90,000 interest (or profit). However, since \nYim did not join Isaac Koo as a defendant, I cannot make an order against him \nto pay her damages. Sovereign Sands\/Asia First Star Capital did not enter an \nappearance or file its defence. I thus find Yim\u2019s claim against the first defendant \nas proved. In summary, I hold that Hua is liable for fraudulent misrepresentation \nVersion No 1: 29 Jun 2021 (11:56 hrs)\nYim Lok Foong Elsie v Asia First Star Capital Pte Ltd[2021] SGHC 156\n13and unlawful means conspiracy, and I hold that Asia First Star Capital is liable \nfor breach of contract, fraudulent misrepresentation, and unlawful means \nconspiracy. As both Hua and Asia First Star Capital caused the \u201csame and \nindivisible damage\u201d to Yim, I hold that they are jointly and severally liable to \nYim for damages of $390,000 (Crest Capital Asia Pte Ltd and others v OUE \nLippo Healthcare Ltd (formerly known as International Healthway Corp Ltd) \nand another and other"}

The plaintiffs\u2019 case is that the defendant executed the AOD because the PT Entities had failed, refused and\/or neglected to pay the monies due and owing to the plaintiffs under the Interim Arrangements Clause of the Term Sheet.

However, following the execution of the AOD, the PT Entities failed to pay the fees due to the plaintiffs under the Interim Arrangements Clause. 10', 'As such, the plaintiffs took the position that the PT Entities were guilty of breaching the Term Sheet and proceeded to terminate the same on 28 September 2018.

In those circumstances, the plaintiffs then sought to enforce the guarantee given by the defendant under the AOD. A demand was sent by the plaintiffs\u2019 solicitors, Tan Kok Quan Partnership (\u201cTKQP\u201d), to the defendant on 6 March 2019 demanding payment from the defendant of the sum of IDR 8,221,181,489 (\u201cOutstanding Balance\u201d) said to be due to the plaintiffs as at the date of the letter. 12', 'However, the defendant refused to make payment of the Outstanding Balance and through her solicitors, Rajah & Tann Singapore LLP (\u201cR&T\u201d), denied any liability under the AOD for the reasons which had been articulated in an earlier letter from R&T (sent on behalf of the PT Entities) on 15 February 2019. 13', 'Among the reasons given was the contention that the \u201coperational commencement of the new PT entity\u201d, which was a condition for when any payment would become due under the AOD, never came to pass. 14', 'The defendant\u2019s position was that the \u201cnew PT\u201d entity envisaged in the AOD, namely, PT Asia Prima Pratama (\u201cPT APP\u201d), never commenced operations and thus any liability of the defendant under the AOD was not triggered.

{"casename":"2021_SGHC_160","fact":"Background\n3 The proceedings in the District Court were commenced by the applicant \nunder s 12(1) of the POHA. In those proceedings, the applicant seeks orders \nthat, amongst other things, the respondents be prohibited from harassing the \napplicant, stalking the applicant using tracking devices, and hacking the \napplicant\u2019s social media accounts.1 The applicant filed a number of applications \nin the District Court, three of which are relevant for present purposes. \n4 The first was an application to amend the applicant\u2019s name by deed poll. \nThe Deputy Registrar made an order permitting the applicant to amend \u201chis \nname\u201d as stated in the cause papers to \u201cBalqis-Maimon Abd Rahman\u201d (the \n\u201cDecember 2020 Order\u201d).2 There is no dispute that this order was correctly \nmade, as it was supported by an affidavit annexing the applicant\u2019s national \nregistration identity card (\u201cNRIC\u201d), bearing that name, as well as a deed poll \nreflecting a change in name from \u201cMohd Bakhit Bin Abd Rahman\u201d to \u201cBalqis-\nMaimon Abd Rahman.\u201d3 \n5 The applicant thereafter filed an ex parte application seeking leave to \namend \u201cher name from Mohd Bakhit Bin Abd Rahman to Balqis-Maimon Abd \nRahman\u201d [emphasis added]. The Deputy Registrar granted the order sought \n1 Record of Proceedings (\u201cROP\u201d) at p 1.\n2 ROP at p 58.\n3 ROP at pp 36 to 40.\nVersion No 1: 28 Jun 2021 (12:38 hrs)\nBalqis-Maimon Abd Rahman v Soekiman bin Parjo[2021] SGHC 160\n3(\u201cthe March 2021 order\u201d).4 The A-G submits that the March 2021 order can be \ninterpreted in two ways. Specifically, it can be interpreted as being limited to \npermitting the applicant\u2019s name to be amended, or alternatively, as implicitly \nrecognising the applicant as a female. According to the A-G, the former \ninterpretation would mean that the order was \u201centirely superfluous and should \nnot have been made\u201d, whereas the latter interpretation would mean that the \nDeputy Registrar lacked jurisdiction, as well as the factual and procedural basis, \nto make the March 2021 Order.5 In my view, the latter or \u201cwider\u201d interpretation \nis more consonant with both the terms of the order, which used the female \npronoun, as well as the affidavit filed in support of the application, which \nprovided the basis for the order to be granted. In particular, the supporting \naffidavit annexed medical reports from doctors whose opinions were that the \napplicant was a male to female transgender individual. In these reports, the \ndoctors also asked that the applicant be treated as a female as this was what the \napplicant desired.6 In this context, the order made implicitly endorsed or \nrecognised a change in the gender of the applicant from male to female, and was \nnot merely limited to granting leave to change the applicant\u2019s name in the \nproceedings. \n6 On 30 March 2021, the applicant filed a further ex parte application \nseeking \u201c[l]eave \u2026 to change the gender of the applicant from Male to Female\u201d. \nThe Deputy Registrar similarly granted an order in terms of this application \n(\u201cthe April 2021 Order\u201d).7 The applicant subsequently brought the April 2021 \nOrder to the Immigration and Checkpoint Authority (\u201cICA\u201d) and asked for a \n4 ROP at p 59.\n5 A-G\u2019s submissions at paras 19 to 26.\n6 ROP at pp 45 to 47.\n7 ROP at p 60.\nVersion No 1: 28 Jun 2021 (12:38 hrs)\nBalqis-Maimon Abd Rahman v Soekiman bin Parjo[2021] SGHC 160\n4change in the gender reflected on the applicant\u2019s NRIC. At a pre-trial conference \non 13 April 2021, the applicant sought the Deputy Registrar\u2019s assistance to \nrequire the ICA to change what was reflected on the applicant\u2019s NRIC. The \napplicant told the Deputy Registrar: \u201cnow the court recognises me as a woman, \nI went to the ICA\u201d. The applicant recounted that \u201cthey [meaning the ICA] need \na stronger reference from the court\u201d. The applicant thus asked the Deputy \nRegistrar: \u201cmaybe the court order, you want to address to [the] ICA\u201d. The \nDeputy Registrar rejected the request and explained that the courts had \nrecognised the applicant as a female \u201cjust for the purposes of [the POHA] \nproceedings.\u201d8 \n7 Under ss 24 and 27(2) of the SCJA, the General Division of the High \nCourt (\u201cGeneral Division\u201d) may call for the records of any matter or proceeding \nin the State Courts on its own motion. Sections 25 and 27(2) then provide that \nthe General Division may, having called for the record, remove the matter or \nproceeding into the General Division, give to the subordinate court such \ndirections as to the further conduct of the matter or proceeding as justice may \nrequire, or give such orders as seem necessary to secure that substantial justice \nis done. On a perusal of the letter from the Deputy Registrar, it was clear to me \nthat there were serious questions as to whether or not the Orders had been \ncorrectly made. I therefore called for the record of proceedings in respect of \nwhich the Orders were made. Having reviewed the record, it appeared that the \nOrders might have to be set aside in the exercise of my revisionary powers as a \nJudge sitting in the General Division. \n8 Given that s 28(2) of the SCJA provides that no final order shall be made \nto the prejudice of any person unless that person has had the opportunity of \n8 ROP at pp 73 and 74.\nVersion No 1: 28 Jun 2021 (12:38 hrs)\nBalqis-Maimon Abd Rahman v Soekiman bin Parjo[2021] SGHC 160\n5being heard, I invited submissions on the questions as to whether there was any \nlegal basis for the Deputy Registrar to grant the Orders and whether the Orders \nshould be set aside by the General Division. Submissions were invited not only \nfrom the applicant, but also from the A-G, as it represents the ICA, which could \npotentially be prejudiced by any orders made in these revisionary proceedings. \nMy decision\n9  In my view, two main questions arise for determination in the present \ncase. First, whether there was any basis for the Deputy Registrar to grant the \nOrders; and second, whether the Orders should be set aside. I will address each \nof these issues in turn.\nWhether there was any basis for the Orders to be made\n10 For the purposes of the present proceedings, the applicant tendered \ndocuments such as medical reports and a letter from a Member of Parliament \n(\u201cthe MP\u201d) to the ICA, in which the MP stated that the applicant was requesting \na change of gender on the applicant\u2019s NRIC and on the \u201crecords\u201d. The \nsubmissions made by the applicant, who is unrepresented, are directed at \npersuading me that it would be prejudicial to set aside the Orders, that the \napplicant should be recognised as a female, and that various other individuals \nand organisations have done so as well. These, however, do not address the key \nquestion as to whether there was any legal basis for the Orders to be made.\n11 Aside from the argument that the March 2021 order was superfluous, \nthe A-G also argues that the Orders were legally defective as: \n(a) The courts do not have the power or jurisdiction to decide issues \nrelating to a change of the applicant\u2019s gender, which instead lies with \nVersion No 1: 28 Jun 2021 (12:38 hrs)\nBalqis-Maimon Abd Rahman v Soekiman bin Parjo[2021] SGHC 160\n6the \u201cregistration officer\u201d pursuant to reg 10 of the National Registration \nRegulations (Cap 201, Rg 2, 1990 Rev Ed) (\u201cNRR\u201d). \n(b) There was no factual basis upon which to make such an order as \nthe applicant\u2019s NRIC stated the applicant\u2019s sex to be \u201cmale\u201d, and there \nwas no evidence that this had been changed to \u201cfemale\u201d in accordance \nwith the law. There was also no explanation provided regarding the \nexhibits to the supporting affidavit.\n(c) The applications did not fall under any of the categories of \ninterlocutory applications permitted under O 109 of the Rules of Court \n(Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (\u201cROC\u201d), were not connected to the main \nPOHA action, and were improper or an abuse of process. \n12 It is useful to begin by considering the nature of the orders made, which \npresents some difficulty. I readily accept that these cannot be properly \ncharacterised as interlocutory orders, in that they were not peripheral to the main \nhearing, nor did they deal with procedural matters that prepared the case for \nhearing (see Dorsey James Michael v World Sport Group Pte Ltd [2013] 3 SLR \n354 at [58] and [59]). As I have noted above, while the March 2021 Order, on \nits face, gave the applicant leave to amend \u201cher\u201d name, it is clear both from the \nplain language of the order made, as well as from the supporting affidavit which \nprovided the basis for the order, that this was not an ordinary application to \namend, for instance, the ex parte originating summons. Equally, however, while \nit implicitly recognised the applicant as being a female, it stopped short of being \na declaratory order. The March 2021 Order did not, for instance, purport to \nmake a binding declaration of contested legal rights of the parties represented \nin the litigation (see Salijah bte Ab Latef v Mohd Irwan bin Abdullah Teo [1995] \n3 SLR(R) 233 at [17]). In this connection, I note also that the Court of"}

Some further correspondence was exchanged on the various demands made. Thereafter, the year 2018 was fairly uneventful in relation to the Respondent\u2019s conduct. This was subsequently explained by Shyller Tan on the basis that (a) she had become the sole breadwinner for her three young children following ST\u2019s passing, (b) she became the person in charge of the company TNS following her father being taken into custody, (c) she had to focus on ensuring that a performance guarantee payable by TNS to another company was not triggered, (d) she was involved with setting up a new project with SATS in 2018, and (e) she was involved in the care and conduct of her father\u2019s criminal defence. 47', '25\\u2003In 2019, the issue of the Alphard and Loans arose again when JYGL commenced HC\/S 217\/2019 (\u201cSuit 217\u201d) on 25 February 2019 against the Estate.', '26\\u2003This application (and in fact the Complainant\u2019s entire complaint) could be said to have arisen most directly out of the Respondent acting for JYGL against the Estate in Suit 217. Broadly, JYGL sought S$166,000 as the sum of a loan she had allegedly extended to ST to purchase the Alphard, and S$3,403,161 as the sum of the Loans she claimed to have extended to ST. 48', '27\\u2003The Estate filed a Defence and Counterclaim on 18 March 2019. By then, ACBP was practising with JHT Law Corporation (\u201cJHT\u201d) and represented the Estate. The Defence and Counterclaim put JYGL to strict proof of the loans alleged, and counterclaimed for (a) conversion of the Alphard by JYGL to her own use, and (b) the \u201cdelivery up of valuable chattels belonging to [ST] which were acquired by him, and of which [JYGL] [had] possession of \u2026 at the time of his demise\u201d. 49', 'The first paragraph of the Defence and Counterclaim expressly stated as follows:', '28\\u2003On 20 March 2019, JHT wrote to the Respondent to state that he was acting in conflict of interest by his representing JYGL.

{"casename":"2021_SGHC_171","fact":"the facts of the case warrant it. The Defendants submit that \nby reason of the fact that at the time of the accident the wife was working, the \nconventional percentage deductions of 25% and 33% attributable to the \nhusband\u2019s exclusively personal expenditure should be replaced by significantly \nhigher percentages ranging from 40% to 50%.8 The effect is to reduce the \nquantum attributable to dependency. No explanation was offered as to how \nthese higher percentages were derived. We shall return to this when dealing with \nthe multiplicand.\n13 The Deceased died at the age of 40 in the accident, leaving behind three \ndependants, namely, his wife and two daughters aged 45, 20 and 10 years at the \ntime of the accident. The Deceased had been working as a Cell Leader in \nHoneywell Aerospace Singapore Pte Ltd (\u201cHoneywell\u201d) at its factory in Jurong.\n14 He was a hardworking man whose life revolved around his family and \nhis job with little time for other pursuits. Moreover, he was a frugal man who \nspent very little on himself. His wife managed his finances as she held the ATM \ncard for the account into which his salary was paid. She gave him $50 each time \nfor his personal expenditure and when that ran out after a few days she would \ngive him $50 more. He ate breakfast and lunch at the Honeywell canteen at \n8 Defendants\u2019 written submissions at para 107 to para 108.\nVersion No 2: 12 Aug 2021 (09:35 hrs)\nPuspa Sinnappa v Balasingam s\/o Rengasamy[2021] SGHC 171\n6subsidised prices. For example, breakfast cost only $1.20 and lunch, about $3.9 \nApart from expenses related to the motorcycle he used, there was little else he \nspent money on as he did not have any hobby and drank only very occasionally, \nsuch as during Deepavali with his brothers, but even then consumed little. He \ndid not drink at home. It is little wonder that $50 would last him a few days. \nEven for his haircut, he would want the wife to be with him. They did their \nshopping together in Malaysia for which she would exchange Singapore dollars \nwithdrawn with his ATM card for Malaysian currency. In contrast to his meagre \nexpenses, the two daughters cost much more to maintain because of their \neducational expenses. Prior to the accident, the elder daughter, the 2nd Plaintiff, \nwas given $500 each month to cover her meal expenses. In 2019, she enrolled \nfor a part-time course of study leading to a Bachelor of Arts with Honours \ndegree in Accounting and Finance with Coventry University in collaboration \nwith PSB Academy. This cost $20,186 in fees.10 The 1st Plaintiff gave evidence \nthat the deceased would certainly have supported her through tertiary education. \nI have no reason to doubt that. In addition, the parents were paying a total of \napproximately $190 in insurance premium on her behalf.11 \n15 The second daughter, Darshana, had tuition in three subjects costing \n$320 per week.12 Her School Fees and Miscellaneous fees were $400 per \n9 NB: I am assuming that when the 1st Plaintiff said \u201c\u2026the lunch is in his own company \nwhich is subsidised. We only spend about $3 a day\u201d, she was referring to $3 for one \nperson (Notes of Evidence (28 October 2020) page 16 line 22 to line 23).\n10 Plaintiffs\u2019 Bundle of Documents (Vol 1) at page 234.\n11 Plaintiffs\u2019 Bundle of Documents (Vol 1) at page 255. \n12 Notes of Evidence (28 October 2020) page 21 line 18.\nVersion No 2: 12 Aug 2021 (09:35 hrs)\nPuspa Sinnappa v Balasingam s\/o Rengasamy[2021] SGHC 171\n7month.13 She also had a daily allowance of $6 (which increased to $10 when she \nreached Primary 5).14 \n16 The 1st Plaintiff and her husband had also taken out a residential \nproperty loan for which monthly instalments were $1,475 per month for years \n1 to 3 before increasing to $1,556 in year 4. From documentary evidence \nproduced, there was payment to Singapore Power of approximately $149 per \nmonth and payment to Singtel of approximately $330 per month.15 The latter \nseems high to me, but it might be for a package. In any case, this was not queried \nby the Defendants. One other item of expenditure which emerged in the cross \nexamination of the 1st Plaintiff was the $12,000 annual premium for an \ninsurance policy which was purchased in Malaysia covering the Deceased, the \n1st Plaintiff and the two daughters.16 The 1st Plaintiff did clarify that once the \nfamily acquired permanent residence status in Singapore, they would have to \ngive up the policy. However, she also testified that they would have to take up \ninsurance in Singapore once that happened.17\n17 The foregoing is of course not a comprehensive itemisation, the \nPlaintiffs having sensibly opted to adopt the Percentage Deduction method. \nThey largely came out in evidence as a result of cross-examination of the 1st \nPlaintiff. Nevertheless, they show that the household expenses and children\u2019s \neducational expenses were such that it was unlikely that on account of the wife\u2019s \nincome, the Deceased could have spent more on himself even if he were so \n13 Plaintiffs\u2019 Bundle of Documents (Vol 1) at page 249.\n14 Notes of Evidence (27 October 2020) page 84 line 19 to line 21.\n15 Plaintiffs\u2019 Bundle of Documents (Vol 1) at pages 254 and 256.  \n16 Notes of Evidence (28 October 2020) page 23 line 6.\n17 Notes of Evidence (27 October 2020) page 53 line 27 to line 29.\nVersion No 2: 12 Aug 2021 (09:35 hrs)\nPuspa Sinnappa v Balasingam s\/o Rengasamy[2021] SGHC 171\n8inclined. Moreover, his frugality, the long hours that he spent at work and his \nlack of a hobby meant that he would not have required more than the \nconventional 25% for his exclusive use. Even the petrol and maintenance \nexpenses for the motorcycle were family expenses, the vehicle being for the \ntransportation of other family members as well. I am therefore of the view that \nat least until the elder daughter became financially independent the appropriate \ndeduction is 25%. For subsequent dependency periods the wife\u2019s income should \nbe taken into account, leading to increased percentage deduction as we shall see.\n18 The Plaintiffs computed the working life of the Deceased as ending at \nage 70, whereas the Defendants submit that it should be only until age 65. I \nagree with the Plaintiffs for the reasons which follow.\n19 In his 2019 National Day Rally speech on 18 August of that year, the \nPrime Minister announced that the retirement age and re-employment age will \nbe raised by gradual steps to 65 and 70 respectively by the year 2030. This \nincrease would have been implemented well before the Deceased would have \nreached retirement age. The evidence of Ms Chong Wan Juen (\u201cMs Chong\u201d), \nthe Human Resource Manager at Honeywell, was that Honeywell currently \noffers re-employment beyond the statutory retirement age of 62 up to the age of \n67, subject to a health check and a performance rating of 5. It is reasonable to \nassume that Honeywell\u2019s re-employment policy would in due course be \nadjusted in line with later Government policy. It is also reasonable to assume \nthat the Deceased, who had consistently attained a performance rating of at least \n5, would qualify.\n20 There is no basis to question his ability to pass a health check, there \nbeing no evidence to suggest otherwise. Indeed his wife testified that he was in \ngood health. In any case, any possibility that he might in the future fall into ill \nVersion No 2: 12 Aug 2021 (09:35 hrs)\nPuspa Sinnappa v Balasingam s\/o Rengasamy[2021] SGHC 171\n9health would already be taken into account in the multiplier for the vicissitudes \nof life. A further consideration which suggests that, but for the accident, the \nDeceased would have worked for as long as he was permitted to is the reality \nthat, given the life expectancy in Singapore, not many people can confidently \nretire and depend for the rest of their lives on their CPF savings. I therefore \naccept that it is not unreasonable to assume that the Deceased would have \nworked until he attained the age of 70 years.\n21 The remaining working life of the Deceased had he not suffered the \nwrongful death is therefore 30 years. However, to arrive at the multiplier, this \nfigure has to be discounted to take into account the benefit of receiving a lump \nsum payment in advance and the vicissitudes of life. With the introduction of \nactuarial tables in amendments to the Supreme Court Practice Directions, \nmultipliers can be arrived at which more realistically reflect the discounted \nvalue of an accelerated receipt of compensation and the vicissitudes of life. If \nthe actuarial tables were to apply in the present case, the multiplier would be \n21.6 years. However, the tables may only be used in proceedings that are heard \non or after 1 April 2021. Unfortunately for the Plaintiffs, the present case falls \non the wrong side of that cut off date.\n22 The plaintiffs submit that an 18-year multiplier should apply whereas \nthe defendants propose 15 years. I am of the view that 18 years would be fair. \nIt implies an embedded rate of return of nearly 4% per annum which, though \nhigh would be closer to reality than the annual rate of return of more than 5% \nwhich the multiplier of 15 years implies.\nVersion No 2: 12 Aug 2021 (09:35 hrs)\nPuspa Sinnappa v Balasingam s\/o Rengasamy[2021] SGHC 171\n10Multiplicand\n23 The multiplicand is based on the available annual income post-tax and \nafter deduction of employee\u2019s CPF contributions for the year, as this is the \nincome from which the dependants would receive their financial support. From \nthis resultant figure, there has to be deducted a percentage thereof representing \nexpenditure exclusively personal to the deceased.\n24 As the annual income would not be static throughout the putative \nworking life of the deceased, salary increments and promotions (if any) would \nalso have to be taken into account.\n25 I have studied the Plaintiffs\u2019 computation of the annual income which \nthe Deceased may reasonably be expected to earn had he not died prematurely \nas a result of the accident and have the following comments:\n(a) The computation builds in an annual increment of 3% in the base \nsalary. This is supported by the evidence of Ms Chong, the Human \nResource Manager. On the other hand, the Defendants\u2019 suggestion of \n2.7% is not supported by the evidence. Referring to Plaintiffs\u2019 Exhibit \nP7 at page 6 (on guidelines for the recommended variable bonus and \nmerit increment range for employees), counsel for the Defendants \nsuggested that the increment should be the mean between 2.1% and \n3.3% i.e. 2.7%.18 However that same chart also showed that the \n\u201cAverage Guidance\u201d would be 95% of the country merit increment \nbudget. On the basis of a modest budget of 3% taken as an example, the \ndeceased\u2019s increment would already be 95% of 3% ie, 2.85%. (It should \nbe noted that for the years 2015 to 2019 the country merit increment \n18 Defendant\u2019s written submissions (9 December 2020) at para 63. \nVersion No 2: 12 Aug 2021 (09:35 hrs)\nPuspa Sinnappa v Balasingam s\/o Rengasamy[2021] SGHC 171\n11budget ranged from 3% in 2018 and 2019 to 4% in 2015 with 2016 and \n2017 having a budget of 3.5%. The budget for 2020 was 0% but this was \nan exceptional year caused by the COVID-19 pandemic). If the country \nbudget was just a little higher at 3.16%, the increment that the Deceased \nwould get would be 3%. Hence the estimate of 3% given by the \nemployer\u2019s representative is reasonable.\n(b) Ms Chong also opined that the Deceased would be eligible for a \npromotion in the course of his career with the employer. However, if the \nDeceased opted for such promotion, he would have to forgo earning \novertime pay. Since overtime pay constitutes a large part of the annual \nincome, and on the basis that the Deceased would have preferred to \ncontinue earning overtime to support the family and to pay mortgage \ninstalments for the HDB apartment that they had moved into just about \na month before the fatal accident, the Plaintiffs\u2019 computation omits any \nreference to a promotion. In contrast, the Defendants assume that the \nDeceased would be promoted by year 2023,19 thereby very substantially \nreducing the income which the Deceased would be expected to earn \nduring his working life. In my view, this is an unreasonable assumption. \nThe Deceased cannot be expected to opt for a promotion which would \nin effect drastically cut down his earnings such that his ability to support \nthe family would be seriously compromised. However, I do not consider \nit reasonable to assume that the Deceased would continue to clock up \nthe same overtime hours throughout his career. Accordingly, I would \nbuild in a \u2153 reduction in his overtime hours at, say, age 55 years and a \nfurther \u2153 reduction at say age 60. I do not apply a final \u2153 reduction at \n19 Defendant\u2019s written submissions at para 78.\nVersion No 2: 12 Aug 2021 (09:35 hrs)\nPuspa Sinnappa v Balasingam s\/o Rengasamy[2021] SGHC 171\n12age 65 because by then the wife will have retired, having attained 70 \nyears of age, leaving him as the sole bread winner.\n(c) Another item that requires determination is the variable bonus. \nVariable bonuses for the years 2016 to 2020 can be derived from actual \nsite achievements in the years 2015 to 2019, using the chart at the \nPlaintiffs\u2019 Exhibit P7 at page 6. For the years 2021 to 2025, the \nDefendants propose an average site achievement of 30%.20 On that basis, \nthe Deceased would be credited with a variable bonus of 30% of the \nmaximum of 2.5 months\u2019 bonus ie, 0.75 months. Whilst I accept that the \nCOVID-19 pandemic would have an impact on the employer\u2019s \nperformance, it is overly pessimistic to assume that the pandemic would \nhave an adverse effect throughout the 5-year period. I would increase \nthe average achievement to 40%.\n(i) For years 2026 onwards, possibly erring on the side of \ncaution, I would allow an average achievement of 60% on the \nassumption that for every good year which achieves 90%, there \nwill be a bad year which achieves 30% performance.\n26 I now consider the 1st Plaintiff\u2019s income. She earned much less than the \nDeceased. This was estimated by the Defendants to be 39.4% of the Deceased\u2019s \ntake-home pay at the time of the accident.21 From 2000 to 2006 the 1st Plaintiff \nwas working for STATS ChipPAC Industries. Sometime in 2006 she joined \nHoneywell as a quality technician, but from 2010 to 2011 she stayed home to \nlook after the second daughter because of difficulty in employing a helper. In \n2012 she joined Leica for about 13 months doing documentation for incoming \n20 Defendant\u2019s written submissions at para 89.\n21 Defendant\u2019s written submissions at para 98.\nVersion No 2: 12 Aug 2021 (09:35 hrs)\nPuspa Sinnappa v Balasingam s\/o Rengasamy[2021] SGHC 171\n13parts. In 2013 she left to join Ciba Vision but left after 4 months to undergo \nknee surgery in Malaysia followed by a break of 8 months for recuperation. In \n2014 she joined Eaton Industries as a quality technician.22 Owing to injuries she \nsustained in the accident which took her husband\u2019s life, she lost her job in 2016. \nIn August 2018 she managed to secure a job in SATS Ltd (\u201cSATS\u201d) but owing \nto COVID-19 which severely affected the aviation industry, the number of \nhours she worked at SATS were reduced. To supplement her income, she found \nemployment at Sim Ley Pte Ltd as a Quality Inspector. Unfortunately, that did \nnot last long. She then took up a job at the Singapore Expo to look after COVID-\n19 patients so as to provide for the family as the sole breadwinner. \n27 Under cross-examination the 1st Plaintiff was asked whether she agreed \nthat once the children became independent in the future, there would be less \nmotivation for the Deceased to work the same long hours. She disagreed and \nreiterated that she would become a full-time housewife at some point.23 She had \nearlier testified that just two weeks before the accident, she had discussed with \nher husband the question of her retirement and he had promised her that he \nwould make her a housewife. The Defendants suggested to her that to enjoy the \nlater years of their lives the husband would then not work as many hours as he \ndid before. Her reply was that if he did not, they would not be able to \u201cafford to \ngo for holiday\u201d. Moreover, with everything becoming more expensive and their \nhaving to take up insurance in Singapore, if the husband did not work hard, they \nwould not be able to afford \u201call those thing[sic] in Singapore\u201d (referring to \nmedical bills and insurance).24 Counsel for the Defendants persisted and sought \nthe 1st Plaintiff\u2019s agreement that the husband would work a reduced number of \n22 Notes of Evidence (27 October 2020) pages 21 to 24. \n23 Notes of Evidence (28 October 2020) page 41 line 15 to line 16. \n24 Notes of Evidence (27 October 2020) page 53 line 25 to line 31. \nVersion No 2: 12 Aug 2021 (09:35 hrs)\nPuspa Sinnappa v Balasingam s\/o Rengasamy[2021] SGHC 171\n14hours. She replied in effect that unlike in the past when commuting between \nMalaysia and Singapore each day would entail three hours of travelling time, \nfrom their flat in Singapore it would take only five minutes to get to work.25 She \nalso mentioned that previously they had to leave home at 5.30am, arriving at the \nfactory at 7.00am. In short, therefore, living in Singapore near the place of work \nmeant not only that the husband spent much less time travelling to work, but \nalso that he did not have to wake up at before 5.30am.\n28 I stated earlier that after the elder daughter became independent, the \nwife\u2019s income should be taken into account when determining the percentage \ndeduction attributed to the deceased husband\u2019s personal expenses. Although the \nwife gave evidence of her intention of eventually becoming a full-time \nhousewife, I am disinclined to believe that she would stop working given the \nfinancial needs of the family.

The accused also wrote down his 12-digit \nMalaysian ID and appended his signature to acknowledge his statement. \n15 After the locker was opened and searched, the accused was shown the \nrespective packets containing the drugs. As recorded by Sgt Yogaraj in P160, \nthe accused knew that these were packets of \u201csaapadu\u201d and \u201cice\u201d, and he kept \nthe \u201csaapadu\u201d and \u201cice\u201d in two separate red plastic bags in the locker. He \nadmitted that he knew that \u201csaapadu\u201d means \u201cheroin\u201d in English. He also stated \nthat the red plastic bag containing the \u201csaapadu\u201d was originally in the other red \nplastic bag with the \u201cice\u201d. The accused separated the two red plastic bags (with the \n\u201csaapadu\u201d in one plastic bag and \u201cice\u201d in the other plastic bag) before keeping them \nin his locker.21 In his third long statement recorded 13 April 2018 (ie, P178), the \naccused further admitted that he knew that the packets in one of the red plastic bags \ncontained \u201cice\u201d.22\n16 It was not disputed that the street names for diamorphine were \u201cheroin\u201d \nand \u201cchocolate\u201d, and the street name for methamphetamine was \u201cice\u201d. The \naccused admitted having consumed \u201cice\u201d before in Malaysia and was familiar \nwith it.23\n17 The Prosecution submitted accordingly that the totality of the evidence \nshowed that the accused had possession and knowledge of the five packets of \n20 AB421 (the translated version of P161 in English).\n21 P160.\n22 AB496 at paragraph 27.\n23 NE, 28 January 2021, p 14, ln 28\u201329. \nVersion No 1: 08 Jul 2021 (07:50 hrs)\nPP v Arun Ramesh Kumar[2021] SGHC 172\n8diamorphine and four packets of methamphetamine.

His defence focused on the question of possession and \nknowledge of the five packets of diamorphine. He claimed that he did not know \nthe contents of the red plastic bag with the five plastic bags each containing one \npacket of diamorphine.25 \n19 The Defence was premised on two main arguments. The accused\u2019s first \nargument was that the Prosecution had not proven that he knew that he was in \npossession of the five packets of diamorphine.26 His second set of arguments \nwas premised on alleged threats by a Malaysian male that he only knew as \n\u201cSara\u201d. \u201cSara\u2019s\u201d handphone number was saved in the accused\u2019s list of phone \ncontacts under the name \u201cS2\u201d.27 He had been in contact with \u201cSara\u201d to obtain a \nloan, but they had never met. In this context, the accused argued the defence of \nduress as he was allegedly threatened by \u201cSara\u201d to receive and keep the drugs.28 \nHe also contended that he had only intended to return the drugs to \u201cSara\u201d and \nwas therefore not intending to traffic in the drugs ie, he was only holding the \n24 Prosecution\u2019s Written Submissions dated 19 March 2021 (\u201cPWS\u201d) at para 13. \n25 NE, 28 January 2021, p 19, ln 24-25.\n26 DWS at para 26. \n27 AB605.\n28 DWS at paras 28\u201343.\nVersion No 1: 08 Jul 2021 (07:50 hrs)\nPP v Arun Ramesh Kumar[2021] SGHC 172\n9drugs as a bailee as per the Court of"}

The DJ reinforced this by stating that this prima facie case would only be displaced, if there were something beyond \u201ca reasonable explanation for ceasing business\u201d.'"}

She was a secondary school student at the time. The accused was, at the material time, 22 years old, and was a student in university at that time. The victim became acquainted with the accused sometime in early-April 2017. Both the accused and victim were alumni from a school group at their primary school. The victim returned to her alma mater once or twice a week to help with the group. During one such session, she was introduced to the accused by a fellow student. The accused explained that he had also been from the group previously, and was there to help out. The accused informed the victim that he was a student at university, while the victim shared that she was a Secondary 2 student. The accused and victim exchanged handphone numbers.', '6\\u2003Thereafter, a few days prior to 25 April 2017, the accused contacted the victim for the first time, via Instagram messages. The accused and victim exchanged correspondence, and the accused called the victim at about midnight. They spoke for four hours, and in the course of their conversation, they started talking about sex. The accused told the victim about his previous sexual experiences. At the end of the conversation, the accused asked the victim if she wanted to meet up. He suggested that they could hang out. Thinking that the accused was interested in her and that they might get into a relationship, the victim agreed to meet the accused on 25 April 2017. However, the relationship never materialised.', '7\\u2003In the course of their conversations before they met on 25 April 2017, the victim and accused also shared their respective dates of birth with each other. The accused was aware of the victim\u2019s age at the material time. The accused also told the victim that he had exchanged nude photos with other girls in the past, and asked to do the same with her. To facilitate this, he requested that she download an application called \u201cTelegram\u201d, and forwarded a photograph of his erect penis to the victim. He then asked her to reciprocate by sending a nude photograph of herself. The victim complied with the accused\u2019s request.', '8\\u2003Subsequently, the accused requested that the victim make her way to a bus stop after school in the afternoon of 25 April 2017. The victim complied. The accused then met the victim at the bus stop and brought her back to his residence. He brought her into his room, where the parties subsequently kissed and undressed themselves. While both of them were naked on the bed, the accused began rubbing the victim\u2019s vagina and penetrated her vagina with his finger repeatedly. Shortly thereafter, the victim stroked his penis with her hand. The accused also persuaded the victim to fellate him, and she again complied. Parties then showered, got dressed, and the victim left while the accused remained at his residence. These acts on 25 April 2017 formed the basis for, inter alia, the First Proceeded Charge.', '9\\u2003After their meeting on 25 April 2017, the accused continued to stay in touch with the victim, with the parties continuing to exchange messages. On 29 April 2017, in the afternoon, the accused invited the victim to come over to his university hostel room. The victim made her way to the accused\u2019s hostel room. At all material times, the accused and victim were alone in the hostel room. Whilst there, they started to watch the movie \u201cFifty Shades of Grey\u201d. When a sex scene in the movie started, the parties started to kiss each other. They undressed themselves and the accused began rubbing the victim\u2019s vagina area before digitally penetrating her vagina. The victim also masturbated the accused. Shortly thereafter, the accused penetrated the victim\u2019s mouth with his penis and moved his penis in and out of her mouth. Thereafter, both parties cleaned themselves up and chatted for a while in the hostel room before going their separate ways. These acts on 29 April 2017 formed the basis for, inter alia, the Second Proceeded Charge.', '10\\u2003The parties continued to chat with each other over WhatsApp for the next few days, while the victim was at a school camp. They arranged to meet at the accused\u2019s residence again after the victim\u2019s camp ended. On 5 May 2017, in the afternoon, the victim made her way to a mall near the accused\u2019s residence, where she met the accused. After purchasing some groceries, the accused took the victim back to his residence. The victim and accused had lunch in the accused\u2019s room, after which the accused asked the victim to massage him. The accused took off all his clothing apart from his underwear, and the victim proceeded to massage his back. Thereafter, the accused turned the victim over such that she lay on her back. He mounted her and started to kiss her. The parties then undressed themselves completely, and the accused began digitally penetrating the victim\u2019s vagina. After doing so for a while, the accused asked the victim whether he could penetrate her vagina with his penis. The victim indicated that she was still a virgin and that she was not comfortable with having sexual intercourse at this point. However, the victim eventually relented, presumably after further persuasion from the accused. The accused then penetrated the victim\u2019s vagina with his penis. He did not wear a condom. Shortly afterwards, the victim asked the accused to stop as she was in pain because of the intercourse.', '11\\u2003Shortly thereafter, the accused requested that the victim masturbate and fellate him. She complied with his requests. Parties then washed up and the victim left the accused\u2019s residence thereafter. These events of 5 May 2017 formed the basis for the Third Proceeded Charge.', '12\\u2003After the aforementioned events on 5 May, the accused informed the victim that he was going to start working as a relief teacher at her school. The parties stopped seeing each other thereafter. They did not meet up privately again after 5 May 2017. After the accused started working at the victim\u2019s school and began teaching her class, the victim confided in her friends that she had had sex with the accused and regretted it. Sometime in July 2017, the victim confided in her form teacher about what had happened with the accused. The victim\u2019s parents were informed, and a police report was subsequently made.', '13\\u2003After the police report was made, the accused was confronted by his head of department and the school principal. He denied the allegations that he had had sexual relations with the victim, and was suspended from his job as a relief teacher. The accused subsequently deactivated his Instagram account and deleted all of the chats and photographs with the victim.', '14\\u2003It was only later in the course of investigations that the accused eventually admitted to his acts with the victim.'"}

Similarly, the appellants and\/or the proxy likely considered that item (c) required a special resolution either under s 32 of the BMSMA by virtue of being a by-law relating to common property, or under s 29(1)(d) as it pertained to the removal of structures from common property.

Cpl Kok was then serving his National Service (\u201cNS\u201d) with the SCDF at the Fire Station.', '', '6\\u2003The factual background was largely undisputed. Much of what had transpired was substantially captured on mobile phone video footage as well as CCTV footage from the Fire Station. On 13 May 2018, the servicemen had gathered in the watch room of Tuas View Fire Station to celebrate Cpl Kok\u2019s impending completion of full-time National Service. Lta Chong and SWO Nazhan were both present at his pre-Operationally Ready Date (\u201cORD\u201d) celebration, where Cpl Kok was presented with a plaque and a cake. After the celebration ended at about 9 pm, Cpl Kok was carried by four of the servicemen to the pump well to perform a \u201ckolam\u201d activity (\u201ckolam\u201d). This essentially involved Cpl Kok being submerged inside a 12-metre-deep pump well with a diameter of 1.8 metres. At the material time, the water in the pump well was filled to 11 metres.', '7\\u2003Lta Chong remained in the watch room and saw the servicemen at the pump well from his window. He shouted at the servicemen not to film what they were doing. SWO Nazhan was with the servicemen at the pump well initially, but he walked away as Cpl Kok was removing his polo T-shirt, boots and socks, as well as his handphone and wallet.', '8\\u2003After SWO Nazhan left the scene, Cpl Kok sat on the edge of the pump well, while the remaining servicemen continued goading him to get inside the well. It was at this time when Staff Sergeant Mohammad Nur Fatwa bin Mahmood (\u201cSSgt Fatwa\u201d) suddenly pushed Cpl Kok from behind into the pump well. Cpl Kok was a non-swimmer. When Cpl Kok failed to surface, a few servicemen entered the well but were unable to locate him. They only managed to do so after a sufficient amount of water was pumped out of the well. Cpl Kok was brought to a hospital where he was pronounced dead at 11.02 pm on 13 May 2018.', '9\\u2003In the proceedings below, the Prosecution contended that there was evidence adduced to show that the servicemen had committed a rash act by making Cpl Kok enter the pump well either by himself or through the use of physical force. The servicemen expected and intended for this to happen, as demonstrated by their conduct in carrying him to the pump well and taunting him and egging him on to enter the pump well.', '10\\u2003The intended act of making Cpl Kok enter the pump well was an act of ragging which was achieved through SSgt Fatwa\u2019s push. As a result, grievous hurt was caused to Cpl Kok. Even if Cpl Kok had entered the pump well himself, there was undisputed expert evidence from the forensic pathologist, Dr George Paul, who had opined that there was a substantial risk of drowning since Cpl Kok was a non-swimmer.', '11\\u2003By omitting to intervene when the servicemen were carrying out the \u201ckolam\u201d, the accused persons had therefore abetted by intentionally aiding the servicemen in their commission of the rash act, as they had been subjectively conscious of the risk associated with the \u201ckolam\u201d. Alternatively, it was argued that the risk was so obvious that they ought reasonably to have known of it, adopting the test in Jali bin Mohd Yunos v Public Prosecutor [2014] 4 SLR 1059 (\u201cJali\u201d) at [32].', '12\\u2003As Cpl Kok\u2019s commanders, the accused persons had breached their legal obligation to keep him safe. They ought to have intervened to put a stop to the \u201ckolam\u201d and would have been able to do so. However, they intended that the rash act should be committed or were at least indifferent as to whether it was committed or not, through their conscious decision not to intervene and to allow the ragging to continue.', '13\\u2003Both Lta Chong and SWO Nazhan were familiar with previous \u201ckolam\u201d activities, which were undertaken as a welcome or celebratory ritual. They themselves had personally experienced the \u201ckolam\u201d as a rite of passage in the SCDF.', '14\\u2003Lta Chong knew that the \u201ckolam\u201d was a prohibited as a form of ragging in the SCDF. He knew that what the servicemen was doing was wrong, but he did not want to spoil their celebratory mood. His defence was that the servicemen had not intended any malice, and had only meant to tease and \u201cscare\u201d Cpl Kok as part of his pre-ORD celebration. The servicemen had not planned to do anything to Cpl Kok at the end of the celebration in the watch room. He himself had not heard any mention of \u201ckolam\u201d in the watch room.', '15\\u2003Lta Chong had also not expected that Cpl Kok would be pushed into the pump well, and the \u201ckolam\u201d was not deemed by most of the servicemen to be a form of ragging or a dangerous activity. He believed that Cpl Kok would enter the pump well on his own, in which case it would have been a voluntary act and the risk of harm would be \u201cvery low\u201d. If Cpl Kok had resisted, Lta Chong did not expect that the servicemen would have persisted and resorted to physical force. The push by SSgt Fatwa was the cause of the grievous hurt suffered by Cpl Kok, which broke the chain of causation. The push was sudden and unanticipated by the servicemen, and much less by Lta Chong himself as he was not at the scene. As Lta Chong\u2019s failure to prevent the \u201ckolam\u201d was not an illegal omission amounting to a rash act, the charge under s 338(a) was not made out and a more probable offence would be one under s 336(b) of the Penal Code.', '16\\u2003SWO Nazhan\u2019s defence was similar in many respects to Lta Chong\u2019s. However, he denied that \u201ckolam\u201d was forbidden in the SCDF as a form of ragging. He thought that the servicemen were only teasing Cpl Kok about entering the pump well. They had not actually intended to make him enter the pump well if he was unwilling to do so. In SWO Nazhan\u2019s view, Cpl Kok was observed to be smiling and laughing and he did not look nervous. SWO Nazhan felt that the servicemen were only playing a prank as \u201cboys will be boys\u201d and they often played pranks on each other.', '17\\u2003After joining the servicemen at the pump well, SWO Nazhan had left them there and returned to his office as he thought Cpl Kok would not be going into the pump well and the servicemen were not doing anything to force him inside. SSgt Fatwa\u2019s subsequent act of pushing Cpl Kok was unexpected and not reasonably foreseeable. As SWO Nazhan had been absent when this occurred, he could not have intentionally aided the commission of the rash act. From his own experience, not a single \u201ckolam\u201d activity had resulted in any fatalities and thus no grave risk was involved. In any event, he himself had undergone a \u201ckolam\u201d as a non-swimmer without any risk.', '18\\u2003At the conclusion of the joint trial, the SDJ found that there was no general consensus as to what the \u201ckolam\u201d activity would involve, and that the reasonable expectation of the servicemen was for Cpl Kok to enter the pump well voluntarily. The SDJ also found that SSgt Fatwa\u2019s sudden push of Cpl Kok into the pump well was the proximate and efficient cause of the grievous hurt suffered by Cpl Kok, applying the substantial cause test laid down in Ng Keng Yong v Public Prosecutor and another appeal [2004] 4 SLR(R) 89 (\u201cNg Keng Yong\u201d). In this connection, the SDJ found that SSgt Fatwa\u2019s act constituted the primary offence under s 338(a). Consequently, he found that both Lta Chong and SWO Nazhan did not have the necessary mens rea for the abetment charge. There was \u201cno concrete plan\u201d to carry out any \u201ckolam\u201d activity on Cpl Kok, and the accused persons did not expect that Cpl Kok would be pushed or physically forced into the pump well against his wishes.', '19\\u2003The SDJ found that most crucially, at the time of the push, Lta Chong and SWO Nazhan were not physically present at the pump well. They did not witness SSgt Fatwa\u2019s push, and had no opportunity to intervene or actively prevent the push from happening. As such, the SDJ concluded that there was insufficient evidence to prove that the accused persons had knowledge of the essential circumstances of the primary offence (ie, the pushing of Cpl Kok into the pump well). He found that there was nonetheless a dereliction of duty on the part of the accused persons in failing to ensure that Cpl Kok\u2019s life and safety was not endangered when he was on duty. Their failure to prevent the \u201ckolam\u201d activity from taking place was an illegal omission.', '20\\u2003As there was sufficient evidence to establish a charge under s 336(b) against each of the accused persons, the SDJ framed amended charges against them pursuant to s 128 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (\u201cCPC\u201d). The amended charges averred that by their illegal omissions to prevent the servicemen from carrying out the \"kolam\", they had done a negligent act which endangered human life.', '21\\u2003Lta Chong pleaded guilty to and was convicted on the amended charge. SWO Nazhan pleaded not guilty and elected not to recall any witnesses. The SDJ found that SWO Nazhan was in a position of command and remained responsible for ensuring the safety of the servicemen under him, irrespective of whether he was the highest-ranking officer at the Fire Station. As he had failed to stop the \u201ckolam\u201d, the SDJ found him guilty of the amended charge under s 336(b).', '22\\u2003Citing the dominant sentencing principle of general deterrence and the high degree of harm caused, the SDJ sentenced both the accused persons to ten weeks\u2019 imprisonment. At the conclusion of the trial, the Prosecution and SWO Nazhan indicated their intention to appeal against the SDJ\u2019s decision. However, Lta Chong elected to serve his sentence, having acknowledged the possibility that the sentence might be enhanced on the Prosecution\u2019s appeal, and undertook not to raise the argument that he would be prejudiced should he have to serve any additional prison term.'"}

He claimed that the Statements were \u201cpre-prepared\u201d and \nfabricated and the contents were all untrue. Essentially, he was informed that if \nhe signed the Statements, he would be granted station bail to take care of B and \nhis mother (\u201cMdm An\u201d) who suffered from health issues.8 \n7 PB at pp 9, 10\u201315, 16\u201320, and 28\u201332.\n8 18\/11\/20 NE 12, 15\u201316, 23, 37\u201339, 43\u201344, 48.\nVersion No 1: 28 Jul 2021 (17:49 hrs)\nPP v BQD[2021] SGHC 183\n712 D attested that when he was arrested on 21 November 2017, he was first \ninterviewed by Supt Burhan in Malay in an interview room. Supt Burhan told \nD that he knew what D had done, and told D not to lie and to repent. Supt Burhan \nalso told D that if he were to confess, he would be given station bail and be \nallowed to see his mother. During this time, IO Xu was present. As D was \nworried about Mdm An and he wanted to be released on station bail, he agreed \nto admit to various acts that V had purportedly alleged against him.9 \n13 Supt Burhan and IO Xu then left the interview room, and IO Xu returned \nshortly with a pre-prepared statement (P28), held it in front of D, asked him a \nfew questions and told him to sign the statement. D did not know the contents \nof, and did not read, P28 but he signed it as IO Xu told him that if he did so he \nwould be released on station bail.10 \n14 To show that P28 was pre-prepared, Mr Shafiq submitted as follows. \nFirst, P28 could not have been recorded within a mere 12 minutes. Second, a \nword \u201cA-N\u201d on P28 was crossed out, because IO Xu had intended to write \n\u201canal\u201d or \u201canus\u201d but cancelled it as he realised that D would not have used such \na word as he does not speak fluent English. IO Xu\u2019s explanation as to how the \namendment came to be made also called into question his credibility. Third, P28 \nwas recorded in English when IO Xu knew that D preferred to speak in Malay. \nFourth, the contents in P28 (and in P29 and P30) could have been obtained by \nIO Xu from Supt Burhan or V whom IO Xu had interviewed the day before.11 \n9 19\/11\/20 NE 31\u201335.\n10 19\/11\/20 NE 35\u201336, 39\u201342; 20\/11\/20 NE 25\u201326, 46, 51\u201352, 55.\n11 18\/11\/20 NE 12, 19, 21\u201323; 24\/11\/20 NE 9\u201310, 19\u201320, 23, 28.\nVersion No 1: 28 Jul 2021 (17:49 hrs)\nPP v BQD[2021] SGHC 183\n815 In the afternoon of 21 November 2017, ASP Razak met D in the \ninterview room with a pre-prepared cautioned statement (P31) which he told D \nto sign. D said he did not agree with the charge of sexual assault by digital \npenetration (which ASP Razak had read out to him) contained in P31, \nwhereupon ASP Razak informed him that P31 was merely \u201cfor \nacknowledgment in court\u201d and that if he wanted to obtain station bail he should \nsign it. ASP Razak spoke to him in Malay. Mr Shafiq alleged that 20 minutes \nwas too short for ASP Razak to read the charges to D, make sure that he \nunderstood the nature of the charges and record his statement.12\n16 As for P29, Mr Shafiq alleged that D disagreed with its contents when it \nwas interpreted to him by the interpreter (\u201cSapiahtun\u201d), but IO Xu promised him \nthat if he signed P29 he would be allowed to go on bail and take care of his \nmother and B. D alleged that P29 was pre-prepared. He did not provide IO Xu \nwith, or agree to, the contents of P29. He signed on P29 because IO Xu told him \nthat he would be released on station bail and go home.13 \n17 After a site visit to the Yishun Flat on 24 November 2017 (\u201cthe Site \nVisit\u201d), D was brought into an interview room at the Police Cantonment \nComplex, where he claimed that IO Xu asked him to sign P30 which had been \npre-prepared. D told IO Xu that he did not agree with its contents but IO Xu told \nhim that if he wanted to obtain bail he had to sign the statement, whereupon he \ndid so. Mr Shafiq submitted that 70 minutes was insufficient for IO Xu to pose \nquestions to D, for D to reply in Malay and for Sapiahtun to do the \ninterpretation.14 \n12 18\/11\/20 NE 130; 19\/11\/20 NE 42\u201345; 20\/11\/20 NE 67\n13 18\/11\/20 NE 44, 47; 20\/11\/20 NE 2\u20134, 21, 76\u201377, 107.\n14 18\/11\/20 NE 39, 79, 88; 20\/11\/20 NE 20\u201321, 94, 97.\nVersion No 1: 28 Jul 2021 (17:49 hrs)\nPP v BQD[2021] SGHC 183\n918 Finally, Mr Shafiq submitted that various indulgences given by IO Xu \nthroughout the investigative process, such as allowing D to make phone calls to \nMdm An and his girlfriend on 22 November 2017, allowing him to speak to \nMdm An on 23 November 2017 after P29 was recorded, and allowing him to \nspeak to Mdm An and drink coffee and smoke during the Site Visit, further \ninduced D to believe that by cooperating with the authorities and signing the \nStatements, he would be released on station bail.15\nProsecution\u2019s case\n19 The Prosecution submitted that the Statements were voluntarily made \nby D. IO Xu, ASP Razak and Supt Burhan had denied having made any \ninducement or promise of releasing D on bail if he signed the Statements.\n20 Supt Burhan was the officer in charge of the team. He had, on 21 \nNovember 2017, first interviewed D to assess the case and when D revealed that \nhe had penetrated V\u2019s vagina with his finger, Supt Burhan then left it to IO Xu \nto record a statement and lock down D\u2019s admission. During the interview, Supt \nBurhan observed D to be remorseful and appeared forthcoming in his version \nof events.16 IO Xu stated that although he was present, he did not understand the \nconversation between Supt Burhan and D as they were conversing in Malay.17\n21 IO Xu attested that after Supt Burhan spoke to D, Supt Burhan told him \nthat D had made an admission and to record D\u2019s statement. He then tried to \nobtain a Malay interpreter but none was available that day. Upon ascertaining \nfrom D that he was comfortable speaking in English, IO Xu proceeded to record \n15 24\/11\/20 NE 30\u201331, 48.\n16 18\/11\/20 NE 99, 101\u2013103, 110, 112, 116.\n17 17\/11\/20 NE 13. \nVersion No 1: 28 Jul 2021 (17:49 hrs)\nPP v BQD[2021] SGHC 183\n10P28. IO Xu also observed that D was able to understand him fairly well in \nEnglish. IO Xu conducted the interview by asking D questions and recorded his \nanswers concurrently. He then read P28 back to D and invited him to sign on it. \nD gave his statement voluntarily and IO Xu did not tell him that if he signed \nP28 he would be let out on bail or to see his family.18\n22 After P28 was recorded, IO Xu sought ASP Razak\u2019s assistance to record \nthe cautioned statement (P31). ASP Razak testified that he read the charge to D \nin Malay and asked him if he wanted to say anything, whereupon D requested \nASP Razak to write his response for him (\u201cD\u2019s Response\u201d). D spoke in Malay \nand ASP Razak recorded D\u2019s Response in P31 in English, and thereafter \ninterpreted it in Malay to D and invited D to make any amendments. D did not \ndo so and ASP Razak then invited him to sign on P31 which he did.

NTUC \nIncome pointed out that the plaintiff had used his average income extracted from \nhis notices of assessment for the years 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2014 as the basis \nfor calculating his pre-trial earnings. Yet, he skipped his 2011 income in his \ncalculation and offered no explanation for the omission.177 It should be noted \nthat the law does not compute loss of earnings in the manner that the plaintiff \ndid. \n124 In any case, it was NTUC Income\u2019s case that the plaintiff\u2019s figure of \n$19,000 as his earned income was inflated as it did not reflect what he was paid \nwhile he was employed by Basler.

There is however a distinction between the 2 categories of \nclaims. The court can do no better than to refer to Shaw Gillian where the \nappellate court said:179\n19 \u2026as Lord Denning MR clearly pointed out in Fairley \n([12] supra), loss of future earnings must be \u201creal assessable \nloss proved by evidence\u201d (at 42). Therefore, if a plaintiff should \nfail to provide sufficient evidence of loss of future earnings, his \nor her claim for loss of future earnings cannot succeed.\n20 Secondly, in the event that there is a lack of sufficient \nevidence proving loss of future earnings, this cannot, by itself, \nconvert a claim for loss of future earnings into a claim for loss \nof earning capacity. These two heads of damages are meant to \ncompensate for different losses \u2013 loss of future earnings \ncompensates for the difference between the post-accident and \npre-accident income or rate income, while loss of earning \ncapacity compensates for the risk or disadvantage, which the \nplaintiff would suffer in the event that he or she should lose the \njob that he or she currently holds, in securing an equivalent job \nin the open employment market.

There is nothing in principle which bars a plaintiff \nfrom being entitled to claim for both loss of future earnings and \nloss of earning capacity, provided that the necessary evidence \nis present...\n25 We reiterate again, loss of future earnings and loss of \nearning capacity compensate different losses. We can best \nillustrate the point by an example. Suppose an injured person \nwas taken back by his pre-accident employer to do a less \ndemanding job due to his disabilities but at a lower pay. If the \nemployer cannot guarantee how long he will be so employed but \nwill do so as long as possible, it seems to us that the injured \nvictim should be entitled to awards based on both heads of \ndamages.       \n126 NTUC Income had submitted that the plaintiff should not be given any \naward for loss of earning capacity or at best, he should be awarded a nominal \nsum of $20,000.180\n127 Whether it is a claim for pre-trial loss of earnings ($861,800) or loss of \nearning capacity or future earnings ($2,052,000) it is incumbent on the plaintiff \nto produce the necessary supporting evidence which unfortunately he did not.  \n128 It is therefore the finding of this court that the plaintiff has not suffered \nany actual loss of future earnings or loss of earning capacity.

Boy would instruct his runner to drop drugs at certain specified locations and Isham would pick up the drugs. Isham would then deliver the drugs according to Boy\u2019s instructions, and Isham would be paid for each delivery. Prior to his arrest on 26 October 2016, Isham had collected and delivered drugs for Boy on two occasions.', '19\\u2003 In the 2nd long statement, Isham provided details of the two earlier occasions where he collected and delivered drugs for Boy. The first transaction was on 17 October 2016 whilst the second transaction was on 20 October 2016.', '20\\u2003In the 3rd long statement, Isham elaborated further on the second transaction on 20 October 2016. In that transaction, he had collected three \u201cstones\u201d of heroin which had been left in a paper bag at his doorstep. He delivered two \u201cstones\u201d to a customer on Boy\u2019s instructions without incident. However, on his way to delivering the last \u201cstone\u201d of heroin, Isham saw CNB officers around the drop-off location. He then left the area and disposed of the last \u201cstone\u201d of heroin. He called Boy to inform him of what happened and asked if he was being set up. Boy denied this, whereupon Isham said that he would compensate Boy $3,500 for the \u201cstone\u201d of heroin he had thrown away.', '21\\u2003In his 3rd long statement, Isham also gave details of the delivery he was supposed to make on the day of his arrest on 26 October 2016. According to Isham, he spoke with Boy over the phone in the afternoon of 26 October 2016 and agreed to deliver four \u201cstones\u201d of heroin for Boy on that particular occasion. Isham was out with Aslinda at Far East Plaza at the time. It was thus agreed that Boy would arrange for the drugs to be left underneath Isham\u2019s Black Fiat car, which was parked at the FEP Carpark. Isham would then pick the drugs up from there.', '22\\u2003At about 6.15pm, Boy informed Isham over the phone that the four \u201cstones\u201d of heroin had been dropped off under Isham\u2019s Black Fiat car. Boy also asked that Isham pay the $3,500 which the latter owed and Isham agreed. At 6.40pm, Boy called Isham to inform him that the \u201cmoney collector\u201d would reach the FEP Motorcycle Bay at around 6.45pm. Isham told Aslinda to return to the Black Fiat car first, whilst he headed to the FEP Motorcycle Bay. At the FEP Motorcycle Bay, Isham met a male Indian and passed him a red packet containing the money. The male Indian was later identified to be Thamotharan (see [1] above).', '23\\u2003Isham then returned to the Black Fiat car, where he saw a white plastic bag and a yellow plastic bag underneath the car. He checked that the four Drug Bundles were in the white plastic bag, and found another similar bundle in the yellow plastic bag. He partially unwrapped the Drug Bundles to confirm that they contained heroin, and then placed them in the blue bag A1. Isham then called Boy to demand an explanation as to why there were more drugs than they had agreed upon. Boy explained that he simply needed Isham\u2019s help to pass the yellow plastic bag to another of Boy\u2019s workers, who would arrive shortly in a car. Whilst on the line with Boy, Isham placed the blue bag A1 containing the Drug Bundles in the boot of the Black Fiat car. A blue Honda then drove by Isham and Isham passed the yellow plastic bag to the person sitting in the front passenger seat. Isham ended the call with Boy and drove off with Aslinda in the Black Fiat car to Cairnhill Carpark, where they were arrested.', '24\\u2003In the 4th long statement, Isham expounded on the second delivery he carried out for Boy. As for the drugs he collected on the day of his arrest, he explained that he touched the bundle in the yellow plastic bag left underneath the Black Fiat car.', '25\\u2003In the 5th long statement, Isham explained that he got to know Boy around 2000 when he was working in Malaysia as a bartender. With respect to the transaction on 26 October 2016, Isham clarified that the white and yellow plastic bags he picked up from underneath the Black Fiat car were placed behind the parking lot kerb and that they could only be seen if he walked to the back of the car. He further stated that the four Drug Bundles were not meant for him to sell, but only to deliver.', '26\\u2003In the 6th long statement, Isham clarified certain details about what happened on 26 October 2016 and stated that Aslinda did not know anything about his drug activities.', '27\\u2003In the 7th long statement, Isham was shown screen-captures from CCTV footage of the FEP Carpark on 26 October 2016. He was asked what was in a white plastic bag he was seen carrying after meeting the male Indian (ie, Thamotharan) at the FEP Motorcycle Bay. Isham insisted that Thamotharan did not pass him anything at the FEP Motorcycle Bay and that he had simply picked up the white plastic bag containing clothes on the way back to the Black Fiat car because he needed to give Aslinda an excuse for taking so long to return. Isham further confirmed that he had picked up the Drug Bundles from underneath his car.', '28\\u2003In the 8th long statement, Isham implicated Thamotharan for the first time. He stated that it was in fact Thamotharan who had passed him the Drug Bundles at their brief meeting at the FEP Motorcycle Bay on 26 October 2016. Isham explained that he was only incriminating Thamotharan at that juncture because he was previously afraid of what Boy could do to him if he betrayed Boy. However, since Boy did not want to protect him (by allegedly paying for Thamotharan\u2019s legal fees but not his), Isham felt that he no longer had any reason to protect Boy.', '29\\u2003In the 9th long statement, Isham said that he would like an offer to reduce his charge to one of trafficking in 14.99g of diamorphine or for a certificate of substantive assistance to be issued to him as a \u201ccourier\u201d.', '30\\u2003It is also relevant to note that a few hours after Isham\u2019s arrest on 26 October 2016, Thamotharan was arrested at Tuas checkpoint around 10.30pm.

The Deceased retreated to the back of the kitchen where she was subjected to more physical abuse, part of which formed the subject-matter of a separate charge in DAC-902771-2018 for voluntarily causing hurt. 13', '11\\u2003On 24 June 2016 at about 7.51am, while the Deceased was ironing clothes, the Accused knocked the Deceased on her head once with her hand. The Accused returned later and took the heated steam iron and pressed it against the Deceased\u2019s forehead, whilst scolding the Deceased for having presumably burnt the Accused\u2019s items. She then pressed the iron onto the Deceased\u2019s right forearm. 14', '12\\u2003On 22 other occasions, the Accused had voluntarily caused hurt to the Deceased, or had abetted Prema to voluntarily cause hurt to the Deceased, or had voluntarily caused hurt to the Deceased together with Prema in furtherance of the common intention of them both. 15', 'These 22 charges were summarised and tabulated at paragraph 21 of the Statement of Facts.', '13\\u2003Among the acts enumerated in the 22 charges, the Accused had on various occasions punched, slapped and kicked the Deceased. She had also hit the Deceased on multiple occasions on the body using her bare hands as well as with implements such as clothes hangers, a plastic bottle, a broomstick, a metal ladle or other household items. In some instances, the Deceased was assaulted on vulnerable parts of her body, such as her head, neck and groin.', '14\\u2003Notably, on numerous occasions, the Accused had grabbed the Deceased by her hair and shaken her back and forth or from side to side and spun her head around, followed by hitting and\/or kicking the Deceased as well as stamping on her body after she had fallen to the floor. She had also dragged the Deceased by her hair across the floor.', '15\\u2003On 15 July 2016 from 12.26am to 5.41am, the Accused used a piece of string to tie the Deceased\u2019s hand to the window grille, in order to prevent the Deceased from leaving the bedroom at night. When the Deceased begged the Accused not to tie her up, the Accused hit her and scolded her, and told her she deserved to be tied up as she had been sneaking out at night to take food. The Deceased was tied to the window grille for the 12 nights preceding her death on 26 July 2016. The Accused had disposed of the piece of string after the Deceased\u2019s death before the police arrived as she was worried that her act of tying up the Deceased would be discovered. 16', '16\\u2003For at least the 35 days preceding the Deceased\u2019s death, the Accused had not provided the Deceased with sufficient food. The Deceased\u2019s meals often comprised only sliced bread soaked in water, cold food from the refrigerator or some rice at night. The Deceased weighed 39 kg when she was first employed on 28 May 2015. She lost 15 kg during the 14 months she was employed in the Accused\u2019s household, weighing a mere 24 kg at the time of her demise. 17', '17\\u2003In the autopsy on the Deceased which was conducted on 27 July 2016 by Dr George Paul (\u201cDr Paul\u201d), the forensic pathologist, the Deceased was noted to be emaciated and in a poor nutritional state. In Dr Paul\u2019s opinion, if the Deceased was subjected to further starvation, it would have resulted in severe and debilitating starvation changes which would lead to progressive multi-organ failure and, if left untreated, death. There was no evidence that the Deceased had any chronic or debilitating illness, pre-existing infection or disease which would result in her poor nutritional state of emaciation. 18', '18\\u2003On 25 July 2016, at about 11.40pm, the Deceased was doing laundry in the kitchen supervised by the Accused, when the Accused felt that the Deceased was working too slowly and proceeded to assault her by hitting her once on her neck with a clenched fist and pulling her hair. When the Accused noticed the Deceased swaying at the entrance to the kitchen toilet from the impact of the blows, the Accused told the Deceased not to \u201cdance\u201d and hit her on the head with a detergent bottle, causing the Deceased to fall backwards and become disorientated. When the Deceased attempted to stand, her legs gave out from under her. 19', '19\\u2003The Accused ordered the Deceased to get up from the toilet floor but she was unable to stand. The Accused called Prema over, who again ordered the Deceased to get up. Prema and the Accused then proceeded to pour a basin of water on the Deceased and sprayed water at her from the toilet hose in an attempt to wake her up. Prema told the Deceased to change out of her wet clothes, but as the Deceased was too weak to stand, Prema dragged her from the kitchen floor to the bedroom. In the bedroom, the Accused kicked the Deceased in her stomach, while Prema punched the Deceased\u2019s neck and strangled her. 20', 'The Deceased asked for dinner, but she was denied food. 21', '20\\u2003At about 11.58pm, the Accused used a piece of string to tie the Deceased\u2019s hand to the window grille. As she was doing so, she kicked the Deceased on the stomach, before leaving the Deceased to lie on the floor in her wet clothes. 22', '21\\u2003On 26 July 2016 at about 12.11am, the Accused entered the bedroom and kicked the Deceased once, telling her to wake up when the alarm rang. 23', 'Between 4.57am and 5.00am, the Accused became angry with her failed attempts to wake the Deceased up. She proceeded to kick the Deceased and stomp on her head and neck area repeatedly, lifting up her body and grabbing her by her hair, extending the Deceased\u2019s neck backwards repeatedly, as well as strangling her intermittently. 24', 'Prema was in the bedroom and also tried to wake the Deceased up. As the Deceased remained unresponsive, both the Accused and Prema became concerned. At about 5.02am, the Accused poured a bottle of water over the Deceased\u2019s face in a further attempt to wake her up. 25', '22\\u2003At about 7.28am, the Accused and Kevin came to check on the Deceased as she had remained motionless. Kevin then left for work. At about 9.22am, Prema propped the Deceased up against the bed and attempted to feed her some \u201cNestum\u201d cereal drink and tried to warm her hands and legs to revive her. As the Deceased remained motionless, Prema suggested that they call a doctor. 26', '23\\u2003Between 9.30am to 9.45am, the Accused called a nearby general practitioner (\u201cGP\u201d) clinic, to request for the GP to make a house call. The GP in question was Dr Grace Kwan Wai Chee, and she had seen the Deceased at the GP clinic when the Accused brought her there for a medical check-up on 23 May 2016. The Accused falsely told the clinic nurse that she found the Deceased on the kitchen floor when she woke up and believed that the Deceased may have fallen. She claimed that the Deceased was in and out of consciousness and was still moving. She was told that the GP would not be available for at least the next 30 to 45 minutes, and was advised to call for an ambulance instead. However, the Accused insisted on waiting for the GP to attend to the Deceased. 27', '24\\u2003The Accused and Prema changed the Deceased out of her wet clothes while waiting for the GP. At about 10.08am, they carried the Deceased out of the bedroom and lay her on the sofa in the living room. 28', '25\\u2003At about 10.50am, the GP arrived at the flat, and found that the Deceased did not exhibit any signs of life. The GP informed the Accused and Prema that the Deceased was dead. 29', 'They expressed shock and claimed that the Deceased had been moving minutes before the GP arrived. The GP advised them to call the police to report the Deceased\u2019s death, but they asked if they could call an ambulance instead. The GP insisted that they should call the police and said that she would remain in the flat until the police arrived. The Accused remained hesitant. She called Kevin and informed him what had happened and Kevin said that he would return home immediately. 30', '26\\u2003The GP asked the Accused if she had beaten the Deceased but the Accused denied having done so. The GP then decided to call the emergency services herself. She asked Prema if the Deceased had been fed as she appeared very thin and appeared to have lost weight compared to when she was last seen at the GP clinic on 23 May 2016. Prema replied that the Deceased ate a lot. The paramedics arrived at about 11.26am, and pronounced the Deceased dead at 11.30am on 26 July 2016. 31', '27\\u2003The police arrived shortly after at 11.31am. The Accused told the police that she had found the Deceased lying on the kitchen floor that morning and had called Prema to help carry the Deceased to the sofa. When asked why she did not call an ambulance, the Accused said that the Deceased\u2019s condition was not serious, but she was only weak, and hence they decided to call the GP instead. 32', '28\\u2003 An autopsy was performed by Dr Paul on 27 July 2016 at 11.44am at the mortuary, and the cause of the Deceased\u2019s death was documented as hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy following severe blunt trauma to the neck. In addition, 31 recent scars and 47 external injuries were found on all parts of the Deceased\u2019s body. 33', 'In particular, the autopsy found that the Deceased\u2019s neck region was extensively emaciated with loss of contours of neck muscles. There were multiple abrasions and bruises to various parts of the neck, including crescentic shaped abrasions consistent with those from fingernails, as well as a recent fracture of the hyoid bone. 34', '29\\u2003According to Dr Paul, the injuries to the body ranged from fresh or very recent injuries to those which were more than a month old. All the injuries were the result of some blunt force, save for those on the right forearm which were related to contact with a heated steam iron. Dr Paul opined that the injuries to the neck as well as the other injuries sustained by the Deceased were collectively sufficient, in the ordinary course of nature, to cause death in the manner described. 35', '30\\u2003In particular, Dr Paul opined in his further report dated 10 November 2017 that the manner in which the Deceased was held by the neck by the Accused on 26 July 2016, with her head pulled back by the hair and being shaken \u201clike one shakes a rag doll\u201d, would appear to be the most likely assault that resulted in the fracture of the Deceased\u2019s hyoid bone. Such a fracture would not be fatal by itself but would indicate a very violent compression or blow to the upper front and side of the neck. The extensive force could have led to irreversible damage changes in the Deceased\u2019s brain, and her poor nutritional state compounded her inability to tolerate the repeated trauma to her neck, leading to hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy which resulted in death. 36', '31\\u2003After the Accused\u2019s arrest, she was assessed by several psychiatrists who diagnosed her to have suffered from major depressive disorder (\u201cMDD\u201d) with peripartum onset of moderate severity, as well as obsessive compulsive personality disorder (\u201cOCPD\u201d). 37', 'It was agreed by both the Prosecution and the Defence that the findings of Dr Derrick Yeo in his psychiatric report of 14 July 2019 were reflective of the Accused\u2019s mental state. 38', 'Both her psychiatric conditions of MDD and OCPD were deemed to have had a substantial contribution to the commission of the offences. 39', '32\\u2003Nevertheless, Dr Derrick Yeo opined that the Accused was not of unsound mind at the time of the offences and was fit to plead. She was cognisant of her actions and purposeful in her conduct. She did not lack capacity to comprehend what she was doing. Although Dr Derrick Yeo found that her mental responsibility was partially impaired, she was assessed to be able to exercise conscious deliberation and volitional control throughout the commission of her offences. 40', 'Accordingly, in Dr Derrick Yeo\u2019s view, the defence of diminished responsibility under Exception 7 to s 300 of the Penal Code was applicable to the accused. 41', 'Although the Accused had initially faced a murder charge, the Prosecution eventually proceeded on a charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder.'"}

{"casename":"2021_SGHC_189","fact":"'7\\u2003The background facts have been set out in detail in the Liability Judgment (HC). I shall, therefore, summarise only the most salient facts which are relevant to these assessment of damages proceedings.', '8\\u2003Clause 5.0 of the LOI provided that the commencement date of the construction of Biopolis 3 was 23 July 2008 and the date on which Biopolis 3 was to reach \u201csubstantial completion\u201d was 22 January 2010 (18 months from 23 July 2008). The contract period was the period from 23 July 2008 to 22 January 2010. Biopolis 3 was certified to be completed on 12 January 2011. The parties agreed that the contractual completion date was 22 January 2010, 7', 'but disagreed on the meaning of \u201csubstantial completion\u201d in cl 5.0.', '9\\u2003In the Liability Judgment (HC), I found that contractual completion was reached when Biopolis 3 was ready for Temporary Occupation Permit (\u201cTOP\u201d) application and inspection, and not when the TOP was granted. The BCA had directed the SO to apply for the TOP on 22 December 2010. Hence, under cl 5.0 of the LOI, Biopolis 3 was deemed to be completed on 22 December 2010 (see the Liability Judgment (HC) at [223]\u2013[244]). 8', 'Therefore, the completion of Biopolis 3 was delayed by a total of 334 days, from 22 January 2010 to 22 December 2010. 9', '10\\u2003In the Liability Judgment (HC), I found that the plaintiff had committed several acts of prevention which caused the completion of Biopolis 3 to be delayed by a total of 173 days (see the Liability Judgment (HC) at [351]\u2013[352]). 10', 'I also found that the plaintiff had embarked on a subtle campaign to slow down the completion of Biopolis 3 while attempting to avoid having to bear any financial responsibility for doing so. This was largely because the global financial crisis (\u201cGFC\u201d) in late 2008 moderated construction prices and threw a pall of uncertainty over the demand for space in Biopolis 3 at that time (see the Liability Judgment (HC) at [378]\u2013[385]).', '11\\u2003I shall now briefly outline each of the acts of prevention committed by the plaintiff.', '12\\u2003On 23 December 2008, the plaintiff terminated the Resident Engineer without providing an immediate replacement. Without a Resident Engineer on site for any period of time, piling works could not proceed. This caused a delay of six days, from 26 to 31 December 2008 (see the Liability Judgment (HC) at [255]\u2013[268]).', '13\\u2003In emails dated 13 December 2008 and 19 December 2008, the plaintiff directed the defendant not to award any more trade contracts without the plaintiff\u2019s endorsement and approval. This instruction was not revoked by the plaintiff (see the Liability Judgment (HC) at [271]\u2013[290]).', '14\\u2003Further, on 7 January 2009, at the last stage of the tender process, the plaintiff introduced Chang Hua Pte Ltd as a tenderer for the reinforced concrete works (\u201cRC works\u201d). The defendant required additional time of about a month to consider Chang Hua Pte Ltd\u2019s tender submissions (see the Liability Judgment (HC) at [291]\u2013[294]).', '15\\u2003 Subsequently, after the defendant submitted its tender report and recommendation to the plaintiff for approval on 5 February 2009, the plaintiff sat on it and did not give its approval notwithstanding reminders by the defendant that there would be cost and time implications arising from the plaintiff\u2019s delay in approving the tender recommendation. In the light of the delay, the plaintiff asked the defendant whether the short-listed tenderers for the RC works could re-submit their tenders based on a shorter project duration. The tenderers re-submitted their revised tender bids on 24 April 2009. At this point, the plaintiff introduced Tien Rui Pte Ltd and Shanghai Construction Co Pte Ltd\u2019s joint tender submissions on 24 April 2009. The defendant then went through the entire tender process again to consider these new joint tender submissions. The defendant\u2019s final tender recommendation was issued on 1 June 2009 and the plaintiff accepted this recommendation. The RC works trade contract was awarded on the same date (see the Liability Judgment (HC) at [295]\u2013[303]).', '16\\u2003But for the plaintiff\u2019s delaying actions, the RC works trade contract could have been awarded on 4 January 2009 (see the Liability Judgment (HC) at [308]). If the RC works trade contract had been awarded on 4 January 2009, the Biopolis 3 site would have been ready for the RC works trade contractor to start work (see the Liability Judgment (HC) at [326]).', '17\\u2003Therefore, I found that the plaintiff had caused 147 days of delay in the award and subsequent commencement of the RC works, for the period from 4 January 2009 to 1 June 2009 (see the Liability Judgment (HC) at [327]).', '18\\u2003On 4 November 2010, the Registered Inspector (\u201cRI\u201d) conducted a mechanical, electrical and architectural inspection of the Biopolis 3 site. On 9 November 2010, the SO informed the defendant that certain follow-up works had to be done, enclosing a list of the RI\u2019s comments. In particular, the defendant was instructed to fabricate and install additional signage.', '19\\u2003I found that the fabrication and installation of the additional signage were additional works outside the scope of the defendant\u2019s work under the LOI, as the defendant had followed the architectural drawings provided by the SO. Further, I found that a reasonable time to complete the additional signage works was seven days (see the Liability Judgment (HC) at [341]\u2013[344]).', '20\\u2003Therefore, I found that the plaintiff had caused seven days of delay in relation to the fabrication and installation of additional signage following the RI inspection (see the Liability Judgment (HC) at [345]).', '21\\u2003On 9 December 2010, the BCA conducted a pre-TOP inspection of Biopolis 3. On the same date, the SO wrote to the defendant enclosing a list of the BCA\u2019s comments for the defendant to follow up on. In particular, the defendant was instructed to install additional railings.', '22\\u2003I found that the installation of additional railings, like the fabrication and installation of additional signage, were additional works outside the scope of the defendant\u2019s work under the LOI as the defendant had constructed the building pursuant to the architectural drawings prepared by the SO. I also found that the delay caused by the additional railing works was 13 days (see the Liability Judgment (HC) at [346]\u2013[349]).', '23\\u2003Therefore, I found that the plaintiff had caused 13 days of delay in relation to the additional railing works following the BCA inspection.', '24\\u2003Clause 6.0 of the LOI provided that, in the event of a delay in completing the construction and maintenance of Biopolis 3, the defendant would be liable to pay the plaintiff liquidated damages for late completion. The applicable rates of liquidated damages were $30,000 per day for the first 30 days that the works remained incomplete after the contract period; $70,000 per day for the next 30 days that the works remained incomplete after the contract period; and $50,000 per day for each day that the works remained incomplete beyond the 60th day after the contract period. 11', '25\\u2003However, as the plaintiff was responsible for 173 days of delay due to its acts of prevention, the defendant was no longer bound to complete Biopolis 3 within 18 months as stipulated under cl 5.0 of the LOI. Consequently, the plaintiff\u2019s right to claim liquidated damages under cl 6.0 of the LOI no longer applied (see the Liability Judgment (HC) at [353]\u2013[354]).', '26\\u2003In view of the plaintiff\u2019s acts of prevention, the Court of Appeal found that a reasonable time for the completion of Biopolis 3 was 18 months and 173 days from the commencement date of 23 July 2008. 12', 'Hence, for Biopolis 3 to be completed within a reasonable time, it should have been completed by 14 July 2010. However, Biopolis 3 was in fact only completed on 22 December 2010. Therefore, the delay attributable to the defendant was 161 days (see the Liability Judgment (CA) at [17]\u2013[20]). 13'"}
{"casename":"2021_SGHC_19","fact":"'3\\u2003The plaintiff is a Singapore-incorporated company in the business of providing electrical and engineering services and materials to its customers. DJS Solutions Engineering Sdn Bhd (\u201cDJS Malaysia\u201d) is a Malaysia-incorporated company. At the material time, it was a wholly owned subsidiary of the plaintiff. Mr David Harmer (\u201cMr Harmer\u201d) is a director of both companies and is described in the SOC as their \u201cdirecting mind and will\u201d. Mr Harmer is an Australian citizen holding a Singapore employment permit. He has been residing in Singapore since 2012. The defendant is a Hong Kong company. Its director is Mr John David Harrison (\u201cMr Harrison\u201d), a British citizen.', '4\\u2003Sometime in 2018, the defendant became interested in building a greenhouse in Malaysia to farm vegetable produce for distribution (ie, the Project). Mr Harrison approached Mr Harmer for assistance in undertaking the said endeavour. Between mid-2018 and mid-2019, Mr Harrison and Mr Harmer communicated extensively over WhatsApp in connection with this Project. As will be seen shortly, the parties dispute whether a contract was eventually reached between them and if so, what the terms of the contract are. According to the plaintiff, it was agreed, inter alia, that the plaintiff and DJS Malaysia would assist the defendant in setting up the Project in Malaysia and any expenses\/liabilities they incurred upfront in the course of doing so would be paid for by the defendant. The defendant would also supposedly pay the plaintiff an additional fee equivalent to 7% of the said expenses (\u201cService Fee\u201d). The defendant, however, denies that any contract was reached at all. It is said that the plaintiff\/DJS Malaysia had incurred the said expenses on their own account.', '5\\u2003Whichever is the case, the plaintiff and DJS Malaysia, under the direction of Mr Harmer, went on to incur various expenses and liabilities in connection with the Project. In particular, DJS Malaysia entered into two leases in Malaysia \u2013 one for land over which the greenhouse was to be built (\u201cSenai Land\u201d) and another for residential land on which Mr Harrison could live for 12 months as the defendant\u2019s representative (the \u201cCasa Anda Home\u201d). According to the plaintiff, its head office in Singapore directly\/indirectly funded all the work undertaken in relation to the Project.', '6\\u2003On 29 March 2019, there was allegedly a WhatsApp call between Mr Harrison, Mr Harmer, one Mr Seven Rivera and one Mr Daniel Currie in relation to the Project (the \u201c29 March 2019 Call\u201d). Mr Rivera works for the defendant and Mr Currie is the defendant\u2019s other director (besides Mr Harrison). The contents of the 29 March 2019 Call are disputed. The defendant produced a screenshot of a WhatsApp message between Mr Rivera and Mr Currie which supposedly recorded the point made during the call \u2013 namely, that if the defendant did not raise sufficient funding for the Project, Mr Harmer (ie, as the plaintiff\u2019s and DJS Malaysia\u2019s representative) would be \u201cfully exposed on his own\u201d for all the expenses incurred in connection therewith. The plaintiff, however, rejects the defendant\u2019s allegation that it was to be responsible for the said expenses. On the contrary, the plaintiff claims that the parties agreed during the 29 March 2019 Call that the plaintiff would undertake work for the defendant and that the latter would \u201creimburse [it] for the work done\u201d and pay the additional Service Fee.', '7\\u2003The plaintiff further claims that on 21 May 2019, the defendant incorporated a Malaysian company, Agricultural Growing Revolutionised SDN BHD (\u201cAGRM\u201d), for the purpose of taking over the Project in Malaysia. It alleges, however, that AGRM has yet to take any steps in this regard. This was not denied by the defendant.', '8\\u2003On 22 July 2019, a manager of the plaintiff and DJS Malaysia emailed the defendant to ask for the immediate payment of MYR 212,437.37 to DJS Malaysia. This amount comprised various expenses apparently incurred in relation to, inter alia, the Senai Land and the Casa Anda Home. On 26 July 2019, Mr Harrison replied to deny that the defendant owed the said amounts (\u201c26 July 2019 Email\u201d). Further, he asked for the return of a sum of \u201cUSD21,350.00 provided [to the plaintiff]\u2026[as] a deposit on the green house\u201d because the defendant had not achieved its funding target and was not going ahead with the Project. No further response was received.', '9\\u2003On 11 September 2019, the solicitors acting for the plaintiff and DJS Malaysia wrote to the defendant to ask for payment within seven days of various expenses\/liabilities the two companies had allegedly incurred in relation to the Project (\u201c11 September 2019 Letter\u201d). These alleged expenses\/liabilities related to, inter alia, the rental of the Senai Land and the Casa Anda Home, as well as various goods and services supplied by the two companies. The said expenses\/liabilities totalled MYR 656,997.36. However, as the defendant had already paid USD 21,750 (approximately MYR 88,952.50) earlier, the outstanding amount was MYR 568,044.86. On 4 October 2019, Mr Harrison replied via email to state that the defendant \u201creject[ed] all claims\u201d made in the 11 September 2019 Letter.', '10\\u2003The dispute over the defendant\u2019s refusal to pay for the expenses\/liabilities allegedly incurred by the plaintiff and DJS Malaysia in connection with the Project eventually came to a head. DJS Malaysia executed a deed (dated 16 January 2020) to assign to the plaintiff all its claims against the defendant for the expenses\/liabilities it had incurred (\u201cDeed of Assignment\u201d). The defendant was subsequently given notice of the Deed of Assignment. Shortly thereafter, on 21 January 2020, the plaintiff commenced the present Suit against the defendant.', '11\\u2003On 6 February 2020, the plaintiff was granted leave to serve the Writ and SOC on the defendant outside of jurisdiction in Hong Kong (ie, the Leave Order mentioned earlier). The defendant then entered an appearance but omitted to file a Defence. As a result, the plaintiff obtained the Default Judgment against the defendant on 31 March 2020. The defendant was ordered to pay the plaintiff MYR 609,241.03 plus interest at 5.33% per annum from the date of Writ to the date of judgment and costs of $4,949.03.', '12\\u2003In July 2020, the defendant obtained an extension of time to make an application to set aside the Default Judgment.

At that time, she and Mr Huang were also unaware that \nthe plaintiff might be the beneficial owner of the Shares and not Mr Li\u2019s \nPurported Chinese Investors.29\n27 DCC at para 6(c).\n28 DCC at para 6(d) and 6(e).\n29 DCC at para 13(c)(ix).\nVersion No 1: 25 Aug 2021 (16:42 hrs)\nXia Zheng v Lee King Anne[2021] SGHC 199\n1228 In February 2021, the defendant came to understand why Mr Li needed \nher to be the nominee of the Shares for the Purported Chinese Investors as \notherwise Mr Tanoto\u2019s combined shareholding, including the Shares, would \nhave thus exceeded the 30% threshold under r 14.1 of the Code and he would \nhave been obliged to extend a Mandatory Offer to the shareholders of USP. \nHowever, the problem here is that, unknown to the defendant at the time that \nshe signed the two IFLAs, Mr Tanoto was Mr Li\u2019s nominee. The defendant \nsubsequently realised in February 2021 that she was holding onto the Shares on \nbehalf of the plaintiff. The plaintiff is a person \u201cacting in concert\u201d with Mr Li \nunder r 14.1, so Mr Li would therefore be \u201cdeemed\u201d30 to have the plaintiff\u2019s \nshareholding in USP (which the defendant holds in name) since the time that \nthe two IFLAs were executed. Hence, Mr Li\u2019s combined shareholding would \nhave indeed exceeded the 30% threshold under the r 14.1 after the defendant \nhad signed the two IFLAs. Accordingly, the defendant claims that she was and \ncontinues to be exposed to a real risk of enforcement measures undertaken by \nthe Securities Industry Council (\u201cSIC\u201d) for being a person acting in concert.31 \nHence, she presently seeks a declaration that the beneficial owners of the Shares \nare the Purported Chinese Investors, so that she could avoid such measures by \nthe SIC.

The \nquotation stated that the repairing cost of the PVD Machine was for the sum of \nSouth Korean won (\u201cKRW\u201d) 139,260,000,  and that a further KRW 50,000,000 \nwould be chargeable as \u201ctravel worker expense\u201d for each PVD machine special \nmechanic if repairs were to be done in Singapore.\n84 Mr Park explained in his AEIC that when he sent the October 2016 \nquotation, he had mistakenly reflected the figures in the quotation as Singapore \ndollars when in fact they were denominated in KRW. He also explained that the \nexchange rate then was $1 to KRW 809.42.64 With that exchange rate, the repair \ncost of KRW 139,260,000 worked out to $172,049.12, and the additional KRW \n50,000,000 for repairing in Singapore worked out to $61,772.63, making a total \nof $233,821.75.\n62 ABOD at pp 115, 118\u2012119. \n63 ABOD at pp 118\u2012119.\n64 Mr Park\u2019s AEIC at para 63. \nVersion No 1: 02 Feb 2021 (18:21 hrs)\nNambu PVD Pte Ltd v UBTS Pte Ltd [2021] SGHC 20\n2685 On 3 January 2017, Mr Park prepared an internal report on the accident,65 \na translated version of which he shared with Mr Yen.66 In that report, Mr Park \nsaid that there was \u201cpartial damage of equipment due to a fire\u201d and set out the \namount of damages as \u201c[a]bout 170,199,900 KRW (SGD 205,060)\u201d.\n86 On 23 January 2017, another quotation for the repairs was sent by \nNambu to UBTS, this time in the form of a tax invoice (\u201cthe January 2017 \nquotation\u201d).67 The cost of repair was stated as $213,309 before 10% VAT, \n$234,639.90 inclusive of 10% VAT (which is very close to the figure from the \nOctober 2016 quotation from Dream Heavy). There were slight arithmetical \nerrors in items nine, 15 and 16 of the January 2017 quotation, as Mr Heng \nnoted.68\n87 Unlike the October 2016 quotation,69 however, the January 2017 \nquotation included, in items 22 and 23 respectively, the cost of air tickets and a \n\u201cresident charge\u201d for two Korean repairmen. This contemplated that the repairs \ncould, and would, be carried out in Singapore. Another new item in the January \n2017 quotation was item 24, an administration charge of $25,000.\n88   A further quotation from Dream Heavy was obtained on 31 August \n2017 (\u201cthe August 2017 quotation\u201d)70 for $583,309 excluding tax (which was \n65 ABOD at p 136.\n66 ABOD at p 137; Mr Park\u2019s AEIC at para 67.\n67 ABOD at pp 141\u2012144.\n68 Mr Heng\u2019s AEIC at para 13. \n69 ABOD at pp 118\u2012119.\n70 ABOD at pp 158\u2012159.\nVersion No 1: 02 Feb 2021 (18:21 hrs)\nNambu PVD Pte Ltd v UBTS Pte Ltd [2021] SGHC 20\n27then stated as 15% whereas previously it was 10%). The administration charge \n(item 26) had risen from $25,000 to $180,000 (being 12 times of $15,000). That \ndid not appear to be Dream Heavy\u2019s charge for carrying out the repairs \u2013 rather, \nit was a claim by Nambu itself for a period of 12 months. In similar vein was \nitem 25, opportunity cost in the sum of $12,500 for 12 months totaling \n$150,000. There was also an item 24 for legal management in the sum of \n$65,000. If those items 24\u201326 were removed, what would then remain (in \nrelation to the repairs proper) is $183,309. That is the same as the figure in the \nJanuary 2017 quotation (in the sum of $213,309) less the $25,000 administration \ncharge.\n89 These quotations ([ 82], [ 86] and [ 88] above) were all premised on it \nbeing possible to repair the PVD Machine in Singapore.\n90 In this suit, however, Nambu asserted that it was not possible to repair \nthe PVD Machine, and that if repairs were possible those could not be carried \nout in Singapore \u2013 instead, the PVD Machine would have to be shipped to and \nfrom Korea, at great cost.\n91 Nambu\u2019s damages expert, Mr Robert Khan Yeow Wai (\u201cMr Khan\u201d), \nstated in his AEIC that \u201c[t]he PVD machine was completely destroyed and is \nnot capable for [sic] repair\u201d.71 In his report, however, Mr Khan relied on the \nviews of third party representatives (from JP Nelson) that due to the severity of \nthe fire damage, their company was unable to carry out the repairs and that it is \nunlikely that any repair yard in Singapore would undertake to carry out such \n71 Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief of Robert Khan Yeow Wai (\u201cMr Khan\u2019s AEIC\u201d) at \npara 10(a). \nVersion No 1: 02 Feb 2021 (18:21 hrs)\nNambu PVD Pte Ltd v UBTS Pte Ltd [2021] SGHC 20\n28repair works.72 However, JP Nelson was not saying that the PVD Machine could \nnot be repaired by anyone. Mr Khan annexed a quotation dated 31 August 2017 \nfrom FM Electro-Hydraulic (\u201cFM\u201d),73 the manufacturers of the PVD Machine, \nfor the repair of the PVD Machine (\u201cthe FM quotation\u201d). That was for the sum \nof $197,460, inclusive of a \u201crepair management fee\u201d of $20,000\u201d. Evidently the \nmanufacturers of the PVD Machine considered that it could be repaired.\n92 The FM quotation was essentially the same as the January 2017 \nquotation and the August 2017 quotation that Nambu had earlier put forward, \nsave that it did not have the arithmetical errors (present in the other quotations) \nin relation to the boom cylinders, battery and hydraulic oil, and the FM \nquotation did not include the total of $6,160 for air tickets and resident charge \nfor two Korean repairmen. The FM quotation also bore the same date (31 \nAugust 2017) as the August 2017 quotation from Dream Heavy.\n93 Reading Mr Khan\u2019s report by itself, one would not get the impression \nthat the PVD Machine could not be repaired; that assertion was put more \nstrongly by Mr Khan in his AEIC than in his report.\n94 I did not accept that the PVD Machine could not be repaired, given: (a) \nthe series of quotations that Nambu had obtained for the machine to be repaired \nafter Nambu\u2019s representatives had inspected the PVD Machine (see [ 89] above); \nand (b) the FM quotation, which showed that the manufacturers of the PVD \nMachine considered that it was capable of being repaired. I am fortified in this \nconclusion by the opinion of UBTS\u2019 damages expert Mr Melvin Lum Kah \n72 Mr Khan\u2019s AEIC at pp 19\u201220; Plaintiff\u2019s Closing Submissions (\u201cPCS\u201d) at para 265. \n73 Mr Khan\u2019s AEIC at pp 18 and 73\u201275; ABOD at pp 538\u2012540.\nVersion No 1: 02 Feb 2021 (18:21 hrs)\nNambu PVD Pte Ltd v UBTS Pte Ltd [2021] SGHC 20\n29Whye (\u201cMr Lum\u201d) that the PVD Machine can be repaired.74 Moreover, if \nNambu truly believed that the PVD Machine could not be repaired, it would \nhave made no sense to incur charges storing it indefinitely.\n95 The question remained whether it would be uneconomical to repair the \nPVD Machine. Mr Khan suggested that that would be the case, because the \nrepairs would cost more than the cost of replacing the PVD Machine with one \nthat was equivalent in age and extent of depreciation (\u201creplacement cost\u201d). But \nthis conclusion is premised on the expense of shipping the PVD Machine to \nKorea to be repaired there, rather than for it to be repaired in Singapore.75\n96 The first three quotations Nambu put forward (see [89] above) recognise \nthat the PVD Machine could be repaired in Singapore, and indeed, the cost of \ndoing so was quoted for. It was also the opinion of Mr Lum, which I accept, that \nthe PVD Machine can be repaired in Singapore.76\n97 In his report, Mr Lum used Nambu\u2019s January 2017 quotation in the sum \nof $213,309 (although this was reflected as $213,307 in Mr Lum\u2019s report due to \narithmetic error) before 10% VAT as a base, from which he made various \ndeductions:77\n74 Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief of Melvin Lum Kah Whye (\u201cMr Lum\u2019s AEIC) at pp \n33\u201234 and 39\u201240.\n75 Mr Khan\u2019s AEIC at p 25; Transcript, 21 July 2020, p 65 lines 31\u201232; p 66 lines 1\u20124.\n76 Mr Lum\u2019s AEIC at pp 38 and 45. \n77 Mr Lum\u2019s AEIC at pp 33\u201234 and 53\u201256. \nVersion No 1: 02 Feb 2021 (18:21 hrs)\nNambu PVD Pte Ltd v UBTS Pte Ltd [2021] SGHC 20\n30(a) reducing the amount for boom cylinders to $4,800 on the basis \nthat they could be repaired or overhauled and did not need to be \nreplaced;\n(b) excluding the $3,457 for the centre joint set which he considered \ncould be reused;\n(c) excluding the $3,086 for the air conditioner which he considered \ncould be reused;\n(d) reducing the amounts quoted for the wages of a mechanic, \nelectrician and general worker; and\n(e) reducing the administration charge from $25,000 to $500 to \nallow for sundries.\n98 On a part by part basis, he arrived at a total of $142,684 and then reduced \nthat by 20% to accommodate for betterment, yielding a figure of $114,147.20.\n99 In its pleadings, Nambu claimed (as an alternative to its claim for \nreplacement of the PVD Machine) $197,460 as the estimated cost of repair (the \nsame figure as that in the FM quotation).78 Nambu also claimed $126,495 for \nfreight and shipping related costs to and from Korea.79\n100 I found that the PVD Machine could be repaired in Singapore at a cost \nbelow its replacement cost.\n78 SOC at para 7(a). \n79 SOC at para 7(g).\nVersion No 1: 02 Feb 2021 (18:21 hrs)\nNambu PVD Pte Ltd v UBTS Pte Ltd [2021] SGHC 20\n31101 Using the FM quotation as a base, I accepted Mr Lum\u2019s opinion that \nonly $4,800 should be allowed for boom cylinders, and nothing for the center \njoint set, or the air conditioner. Mr Lum had inspected the damaged PVD \nMachine and critically considered whether each item of the proposed repair \ncosts was justified.80 I decided, however, not to reduce the amounts quoted for \nworkers\u2019 wages, on the basis that those aspects of the FM quotation were \nreasonable.\n102 As for the repair management charge for which $20,000 was quoted, the \nOctober 2016 quotation (see [ 82] above)81 had no such item; the January 2017 \nquotation had an administration charge of $25,000 (see [ 86] above);82 the \nAugust 2017 quotation had an administration charge of $180,000 (see [ 88] \nabove),83 apparently $15,000 per month for 12 months (which is how Mr Heng \nunderstood it).84 Nambu did not satisfy me that the repairs would have required \nthe payment of an administration charge or repair management charge to Dream \nHeavy or FM, as distinct from Nambu itself wanting to recover something in \nthat regard from UBTS. Accordingly, I did not allow that charge. Instead, I \nallowed $500 for sundries as suggested by Mr Lum.\n103  Additionally, I allowed the total of $6,160 for air tickets and resident \ncharge for two Korean repairmen, which was set out in the January 2017 \n80 Mr Lum\u2019s AEIC at pp 53\u201254. \n81 ABOD at pp 118\u2012119.\n82 ABOD at pp 141\u2012144.\n83 ABOD at pp 158\u2012159.\n84 Mr Heng\u2019s AEIC at para 17. \nVersion No 1: 02 Feb 2021 (18:21 hrs)\nNambu PVD Pte Ltd v UBTS Pte Ltd [2021] SGHC 20\n32quotation, and the August 2017 quotation from Dream Heavy, but was missing \nfrom the FM quotation.\n104 On the evidence and submissions in this case, I did not reduce the figures \nto accommodate for alleged betterment. UBTS did not satisfy me that, in \nprinciple, there should be a discount for betterment; or on the evidence as to \nwhat betterment would result from repairing the damaged PVD Machine. Mr \nLum had simply applied a 20% discount based on what he described as the \nstandard industry practice in Singapore of applying such a discount to repaired \nvehicles and equipment that are two years or older, and the PVD Machine was \nsome six years old.85\n105 In Harbutt\u2019s \u201cPlasticine\u201d Ltd v Wayne Tank and Pump Co Ltd [1970] 1 \nQB 447 (\u201cHarbutt\u2019s\u201d), a factory was destroyed by the defendants\u2019 negligence \nand it was reasonable for plaintiffs to rebuild a new one. The court allowed the \nplaintiffs to recover the cost of replacement, without any allowance to the \ndefendants for any benefit to the plaintiffs from having a new factory in place \nof the old.\n106 Lord Denning MR said (at 468): \u201c[The plaintiffs] replaced [the factory] \nin the only possible way, without adding any extras. I think they should be \nallowed the cost of replacement. True it is that they got new for old; but I do not \nthink the wrongdoer can diminish"}

The DJ has set out the evidence fully in his 112-page GD. I will refer to only the salient portions of the evidence.', '9\\u2003Rajendran and Sasikumar were directors of Nine Silver Pte Ltd (\u201cNine Silver\u201d), a company which operated the Club. Initially, Sasikumar was running the Club by himself. Rajendran joined him in the business later in November 2015 as an equal shareholder and a co-director.', '10\\u2003V1 and V2 were employed by the Club as performing artistes who danced and entertained its customers. V1 arrived in Singapore on 7 September 2015 and V2 arrived here on 16 January 2016. The Club\u2019s performing artistes, including V1 and V2, were housed in an apartment in the Bukit Merah housing estate (\u201cthe apartment\u201d).', '11\\u2003The performing artistes had a monthly earning quota of around $6,000. They had to meet this quota by entertaining customers at the Club and earning \u201ccollections\u201d in the form of tips and payments by the customers. For their work at the Club, the performing artistes were promised a monthly salary of 100,000 Takas (Bangladeshi currency). According to V2 and V1, they were not paid the full amount of their promised salary.', '12\\u2003The alleged first instance of prostitution occurred in early January 2016. V1, Sasikumar and Roky were seated in the Club. Sasikumar spoke to Roky in English and Roky translated to V1 in Bengali, stating that Sasikumar wanted V1 to have sex with a customer. V1 refused but Sasikumar persisted. Roky told V1 that \u201cBoss has told --- His friend has given you lot of collection, so you go out with him\u201d. \u201cCollection\u201d, as explained earlier, was a reference to tips and payments given by the Club\u2019s customers.', '13\\u2003V1 was worried that Sasikumar would withhold her salary. Previously, she was not paid her full salary. She therefore agreed reluctantly to Sasikumar\u2019s request. V1 returned to the apartment. Roky then called her to go downstairs. Sasikumar was waiting there next to a taxi. He asked V1 to board the taxi and go with the customer who was inside the taxi. They proceeded somewhere where they had sex.', '14\\u2003After the session of sex, the customer offered V1 $500 but she refused to take the money. The customer then sent her back in a taxi to the apartment. Sasikumar was waiting there. There, the customer again offered V1 $500. Sasikumar gestured to her to take the money and she did so. V1 then passed the $500 to Sasikumar.', '15\\u2003The alleged second instance of prostitution also occurred in January 2016, after a party at the Club. V1, Sasikumar and Roky were again seated together in the Club. Sasikumar spoke to Roky, following which Roky said to V1, \u201cBoss is asking you to go out with customer again\u201d. When V1 refused, Roky told V1 to go, saying that \u201cBoss said he will pay you salary\u201d. V1 gave in because she wanted to receive her salary. She returned to the apartment. She was then told by Roky to go downstairs. There, she was led by the disc jockey of the Club to a car where a man was waiting in the driver\u2019s seat. She recognised him as someone who had danced with her on the stage at the Club. She left with the customer to a separate location where they had sex.', '16\\u2003The customer gave V1 $500 which she accepted. When she returned to the Club later that evening, she handed the money to Sasikumar and Rajendran. Roky was present as well.', '17\\u2003V2 was the alleged victim in Charge 3. The relevant events occurred at the Club sometime in late January 2016, about two weeks after V2\u2019s arrival in Singapore on 16 January 2016. On that occasion, Rajendran told V2, through Roky, that one of his friends, Anwar, wished to have sex with her. Roky also said that Anwar was willing to pay $2,000 and V2 could keep half the money while \u201cthe boss\u201d would keep the other half. V2 refused.', '18\\u2003After Roky conveyed V2\u2019s refusal to Rajendran, Roky informed V2 that \u201cBoss is getting very angry, he wants you to go\u201d. V2 refused again and she observed that Rajendran appeared \u201cvery angry\u201d. Rajendran then asked V2, through Roky, to go into the smoking room in the Club. There, Rajendran closed the door and spoke to V2 in English, which she did not understand. Only two of them were in the smoking room. Rajendran then gestured to V2 by holding bundles of $50 and $100 notes in his hands and conveyed that some of the money would be hers, while the rest of the money would be his. While doing this, he mentioned Anwar\u2019s name repeatedly. V2 refused again by shaking her hand.', '19\\u2003Rajendran got very angry, raised his voice and scolded V2 in English. He slapped her on her cheek with his right hand, leaving a mark. He then raised his left hand and was about to hit her again but V2 held onto his wrist and then ran out of the smoking room. She headed to the disc jockey\u2019s location in the Club, where she told two of her fellow performing artistes that \u201cBoss is asking me to go out with customer to have sex. I refuse, I don\u2019t want to go\u201d. She also told them that she was slapped and that she wished to return to Bangladesh.', '20\\u2003Rajendran gripped V2 from behind by her neck and said something in English that she did not understand. She freed herself and went into the makeup room in the Club. She did not report the matter to the authorities as she \u201chad no knowledge of what to do\u201d.', '21\\u2003Subsequently, on 10 February 2016, sometime between 10.00am and 10.30am, Rajendran and Sasikumar went to the apartment with food and drinks. Rajendran apologised to V2 and said, \u201cWhatever happen has happened, I---please forgive me\u201d. This was said in English and it was interpreted to V2 by a fellow performing artiste. Alcoholic drinks were then offered to the performing artistes present. V2 refused initially but relented subsequently upon Rajendran\u2019s and Sasikumar\u2019s insistence.', '22\\u2003In the early morning of the next day (11 February 2016), at about 3.00am, V2, along with V1 and two other performing artistes from the Club, left the apartment. They went to Mustafa Centre by taxi and met an unnamed Bangladeshi who brought them to the Ministry of Manpower (\u201cMOM\u201d). There, they reported that they had not been paid their salaries and also informed the officer about the instances of prostitution.', '23\\u2003Later that day, in the evening of 11 February 2016, Sasikumar called Roky and asked to meet him at the back lane behind the Club. When Roky arrived, Rajendran and Sasikumar were already there.', '24\\u2003Sasikumar informed Roky that \u201cthe dancers had [run] away from the lodging house\u201d and told Roky to \u201creturn back to [his] country\u201d. Rajendran \u201calso asked [Roky] to return back too\u201d. Sasikumar then informed Roky that his friend would pick Roky up and drive to Malaysia. Sasikumar would hand Roky\u2019s passport to that friend. They were to stay in Malaysia for two days and Rajendran and Sasikumar would let Roky \u201cknow the outcome\u201d. Rajendran then passed $200 to Roky.', '25\\u2003On the same night, Sasikumar\u2019s friend picked Roky up and drove him to Malaysia. A few days later, Roky called Rajendran and asked whether he could return to Singapore because he did not have much money left. Rajendran told Roky that his work permit had been cancelled and asked Roky to return to Bangladesh. Roky complied and left for Bangladesh on 23 February 2016. In Bangladesh, Roky called Rajendran again. Rajendran informed Roky that \u201che had been banned and [was] not able to return to Singapore\u201d.', '26\\u2003On 8 November 2016, Roky returned to Singapore.

It then forwarded its recommendations together with the Contested Statements to AGC. It is evident, in our judgment, that the CAD\u2019s principal concern was with investigating any possible criminal offences. This is a point that we will return to later in this judgment.', '10\\u2003On 2 July 2018, the Attorney-General (\u201cAG\u201d) made a complaint concerning the respondent\u2019s conduct to the applicant. After several exchanges, the AGC also forwarded Ng\u2019s Statement and the Contested Statements (collectively, the \u201cStatements\u201d) to the applicant in connection with and in support of the complaint.', '11\\u2003As alluded to earlier, the Statements comprise the key evidence against the respondent in the present disciplinary proceedings. According to the applicant, the Statements revealed the following:', '(a)\\u2003Between 2014 and 2015, Ng referred four clients to the respondent in exchange for referral fees. These clients are referred to as \u201cClient 1\u201d, \u201cClient 2\u201d, \u201cClient 3\u201d and \u201cClient 4\u201d (being Woo) respectively. Ng was paid $800 for each of his referrals of Clients 1, 2 and 4 and $600 for his referral of Client 3.', '(b)\\u2003In early 2016, Ng referred a fifth client (\u201cClient 5\u201d), to the respondent and was paid $800 for the referral.', '(c)\\u2003At the time that each of the Clients signed their respective WTAs, neither the respondent nor anyone else from the Firm was present. Instead, the signing of each WTA was witnessed only by Ng, who would subsequently deliver the document to the respondent at a later time when the Clients were not present.', '12\\u2003Arising from the AG\u2019s complaint, the applicant brought the four main Charges as well as corresponding alternative charges against the respondent. Based on the applicant\u2019s case, the WTAs for Clients 1 to 4 were signed (and the relevant referral fees were paid) between March 2014 and July 2015. As such, the charges relating to Clients 1 to 4 are brought under the version of the LPA and the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules (2010 Rev Ed) which were in force prior to legislative amendments made on 18 November 2015. We refer to these as the \u201cLPA 2011\u201d and \u201cPCR 2011\u201d respectively. On the other hand, the matters relating to Client 5 occurred in 2016 and are thus dealt with by charges brought under the version of the LPA and the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 which were in force subsequent to the amendments of 18 November 2015. We refer to these as the \u201cLPA 2015\u201d and \u201cPCR 2015\u201d respectively.', '13\\u2003The 1st Charge against the respondent deals with the payment of referral fees for Clients 1 to 4. The 2nd Charge deals with the payment of referral fees for Client 5. The said charges (and their alternatives) are summarised as follows:', '14\\u2003The 3rd Charge deals with the respondent\u2019s alleged failure to communicate directly with Clients 1 to 4 to obtain or confirm their instructions in the process of providing advice and at all appropriate stages of the matter, including:', '15\\u2003The 4th Charge deals with the respondent\u2019s alleged failure to do the same with Client 5. Both the 3rd and 4th Charges (as well as their alternatives) are summarised below:', '16\\u2003The respondent commenced two originating summonses prior to the disciplinary hearing (\u201cDT Hearing\u201d), as follows:', '(a)\\u2003On 16 August 2019, the respondent filed HC\/OS 1030\/2019 (\u201cOS 1030\/2019\u201d). As subsequently amended, this was an application for the disciplinary proceedings against him to be held in abeyance pending the resolution of another application that he had filed by the time of the amendment, namely HC\/OS 1206\/2019 (\u201cOS 1206\/2019\u201d).', '(b)\\u2003On 27 September 2019, the respondent filed OS 1206\/2019 to seek declarations to the effect that, amongst other things, the Contested Statements:', '17\\u2003OS 1030\/2019 was heard and dismissed by a High Court Judge (\u201cJudge\u201d) on 11 March 2020. The respondent did not appeal against that decision. On 2 April 2020, the Judge also heard and dismissed OS 1206\/2019: see Shanmugam Manohar v Attorney-General and another [2021] 3 SLR 600 (\u201cShanmugam Manohar v AG\u201d). OS 1206\/2019 is especially pertinent for present purposes because some of the arguments raised by the respondent against the admissibility of the Contested Statements in the present OS had been raised before and were ruled on by the Judge in OS 1206\/2019. We will return to this point later in addressing whether any of these arguments are barred by operation of the doctrine of res judicata. At this stage, it suffices to note that although the respondent initially appealed against the Judge\u2019s decision in OS 1206\/2019, he eventually withdrew the said appeal shortly after the DT Hearing had concluded.', '18\\u2003The DT Hearing took place on 18 and 19 August 2020. The disciplinary tribunal hearing the matter (\u201cDT\u201d) determined on the first day that all four Statements were admissible in evidence and the hearing proceeded on that footing. The applicant called three factual witnesses \u2013 namely, SIO Lie, Mr K Gopalan (the director of the applicant\u2019s Conduct Department) and Ng (who was subpoenaed). The respondent chose not to give any evidence in his defence or to call any witnesses.', '19\\u2003Relying mainly on the strength of the Contested Statements, the DT eventually found that all the Charges were proved beyond a reasonable doubt and held that cause of sufficient gravity existed for disciplinary action under s 83 of the LPA. The DT\u2019s decision dated 20 October 2020 is reported as The Law Society of Singapore v Shanmugam Manohar [2020] SGDT 9 (\u201cDT Decision\u201d). The DT\u2019s findings included the following:', '(a)\\u2003The Statements were admissible in evidence (see DT Decision at [37]\u2013[42]). Contrary to the respondent\u2019s arguments, the Statements were \u201crecorded in the proper exercise of [SIO] Lie\u2019s powers of investigation\u201d and although they were confidential, their disclosure was nonetheless permitted in the public interest.', '(b)\\u2003Given the admissions in the respondent\u2019s Statement and the corroboration from Krishna\u2019s Statement and Ng\u2019s Further Statement, the 1st and 2nd Charges were proved beyond a reasonable doubt (see DT Decision at [43]\u2013[52]). Under s 93(1)(c) of the LPA, there was cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action under s 83 of the LPA.', '(c)\\u2003As to the 3rd and 4th Charges, the WTAs signed by the Clients were admissible in evidence (contrary to the respondent\u2019s submission). Based on the admissions in the respondent\u2019s Statement and his failure to explain this or to adduce any contrary evidence, the respondent was found to have failed to communicate with each of his Clients at the outset of the solicitor-client relationship. The 3rd and 4th Charges were thus also proved beyond a reasonable doubt (see DT Decision at [53]\u2013[63]). Under s 93(1)(c) of the LPA, there was cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action under s 83 of the LPA.', '(d)\\u2003Furthermore, the respondent had failed to give evidence himself and did not provide a reasonable explanation for this despite his evidence being material to his defence. The respondent also failed to produce documents or call witnesses in his defence. As such, an adverse inference was drawn against the respondent to the effect that any evidence he might have given would have shown that he had paid referral fees to Ng and had failed to communicate and meet with the Clients at all appropriate times (see DT Decision at [64]).', 'This led to the filing of the OS.', '23\\u2003The respondent\u2019s second ground was initially described as an argument about \u201cconfidentiality\u201d. He developed this in the following manner:', '(a)\\u2003The Contested Statements are confidential in nature and should not have been disclosed by the CAD and the AGC to the applicant.', '(b)\\u2003As the Contested Statements were recorded pursuant to a statute, their admissibility should be strictly governed by the statute itself. To be specific, the Contested Statements were recorded under s 22 of the CPC. They may therefore only be used in the manner contemplated by s 259 of the CPC (meaning, they may not be admitted as evidence unless they fall within the exceptions specifically stated in that provision). Section 22, read with s 259 of the CPC is, in other words, determinative of when the statements are admissible in evidence and this is the position not only in criminal proceedings, but also in any other type of proceedings including disciplinary proceedings. Whilst it may be the general rule under the EA that all relevant evidence is admissible, the statute under which the Contested Statements were recorded (which is the CPC) specifically provides that the statements may only be admitted under specific exceptions based on certain provisions in the EA. Hence, it is only these specific provisions in the EA that may be invoked even in the context of disciplinary proceedings. On the present facts, none of the exceptions under s 259 of the CPC are applicable.', '24\\u2003It may be noted that the respondent\u2019s second ground encompasses what are, in fact, two distinct arguments. The argument relating to the \u201cconfidentiality\u201d of the Contested Statements at [23(a)] is in fact concerned with the permissibility of the disclosure of the Contested Statements by the CAD and the AGC to the applicant (hereinafter, the \u201cConfidentiality Argument\u201d). On the other hand, the respondent\u2019s argument outlined at [23(b)] above is a distinct argument to the effect that where a statement is recorded under s 22 of the CPC, its use including its admissibility (not just in criminal proceedings, but also in disciplinary proceedings) is circumscribed by s 259 of the CPC (hereinafter, the \u201cCPC Argument\u201d). It was only during the oral hearing before us that the respondent\u2019s counsel developed the CPC Argument as a standalone argument that was advanced on its own.', '25\\u2003The respondent thus has three strings to his bow, as it were \u2013 the Ultra Vires Argument, the Confidentiality Argument and the CPC Argument (collectively, the \u201cArguments\u201d). He submits that the Contested Statements are inadmissible in the present disciplinary proceedings on account of these three arguments and that if any one of them is accepted and the Contested Statements excluded, there would be insufficient evidence to prove the Charges. He does not, however, put forward any alternative version of events to refute the substance of the Charges against him.', '(a)\\u2003Whether s 259 of the CPC governs the admissibility of police statements in criminal proceedings only or all proceedings generally (\u201cApplicability Question\u201d, which was identified at [3] above).', '(b)\\u2003How s 259 of the CPC is to be construed in light of the decisions in Phyllis Tan and Rayney Wong (\u201cInterface Question\u201d).', '(a)\\u2003The respondent\u2019s Arguments against the admissibility of the Contested Statements have already been raised and ruled upon by the Judge in OS 1206\/2019. The respondent is therefore precluded by issue estoppel and\/or the doctrine of abuse of process from raising the same arguments in the present OS.', '(b)\\u2003On the Applicability Question, the Narrow Interpretation of s 259 of the CPC is to be preferred.', '(c)\\u2003Given that s 259 of the CPC is not applicable to disciplinary proceedings, the admissibility of the Contested Statements is governed only by the EA pursuant to r 23(1) of the DT Rules (see [20(a)] above). As to the Interface Question, the court in Phyllis Tan and Rayney Wong held that under the EA, the general rule is that \u201call relevant evidence is admissible\u201d subject to the discretion of the court to exclude evidence if its prejudicial effect exceeds its probative value. The overarching test of relevance under the EA along with this exclusionary discretion provides sufficient safeguards to ensure the reliability of evidence in non-criminal proceedings. Applying the general rule under the EA to the Contested Statements, the Contested Statements are admissible for the purposes of the disciplinary proceedings.', '(d)\\u2003In the event, however, that the Contested Statements are found to be inadmissible, this court should make an order under s 98(8)(b)(ii) of the LPA for a new disciplinary tribunal to hear and investigate the complaint against the respondent. The public interest weighs in favour of the matter being fully heard and investigated in a fresh hearing, instead of the respondent being acquitted.', '(a)\\u2003In answer to the Applicability Question, s 259 of the CPC should be construed as applying only to (i) criminal proceedings; and (ii) such other proceedings as may be prescribed by any relevant statutes (that is to say where the statute specifies that the CPC applies to proceedings brought under that statute).', '(b)\\u2003As to the Interface Question, the decisions in Phyllis Tan and Rayney Wong recognise the court\u2019s discretion to exclude evidence where its probative value is outweighed by its prejudicial effect. This exclusionary discretion serves as a sufficient safeguard in disciplinary proceedings to ensure fairness to a respondent solicitor so that unduly prejudicial or unreliable evidence is not admitted. Such a construction of s 259 of the CPC is fair and will not lead to any absurdity or undermine the purpose of s 259, which is to protect accused persons from unfair prejudice arising from the use of witness statements.', '(a)\\u2003In OS 1206\/2019, the Judge did not decide on the admissibility of the Contested Statements in disciplinary proceedings. The Ultra Vires Argument and Confidentiality Argument were, however, raised before and ruled upon by the Judge. While this generally would mean that the latter two arguments might be precluded by the doctrine of issue estoppel, it is nonetheless appropriate for this court to re-examine them because there is \u201cfresh evidence\u201d available in the form of the witnesses\u2019 evidence that was adduced during the DT Hearing. Further, there is no bar at all to this court considering the CPC Argument.', '(b)\\u2003As to the Applicability Question, the Broad Interpretation of s 259 of the CPC is the correct one.', '(c)\\u2003As for the Interface Question, the decisions in Phyllis Tan and Rayney Wong are not inconsistent with the Broad Interpretation of s 259 of the CPC. Neither decision had to deal with the scope of s 259 of the CPC nor did they lay down an absolute rule that all relevant evidence is admissible. Instead, Phyllis Tan held (at [126]) that under the EA, \u201call relevant evidence is admissible unless specifically expressed to be inadmissible\u201d (emphasis added). In the instant situation, the Contested Statements have in fact been \u201cspecifically expressed to be inadmissible\u201d by reason of s 259 of the CPC.', '(d)\\u2003Applying the Broad Interpretation of s 259 of the CPC, the Contested Statements are inadmissible in the present disciplinary proceedings as none of the exceptions in s 259 apply. In the circumstances, there is no evidence to prove the applicant\u2019s case. This court should not make an order under s 98(8)(b) of the LPA that a fresh hearing be conducted because (i) the applicant should not be afforded a fresh chance to mount its case against the respondent; (ii) the respondent deserves finality and should not be put through the ordeal of a second disciplinary hearing; and (iii) a fair trial is in any case impossible because the contents of the incriminatory Contested Statements are discussed in the DT Decision, which is already in the public domain.'"}
{"casename":"2021_SGHC_202","fact":"'6\\u2003The plaintiff, Mah Kiat Seng, (\u201cMr Mah\u201d) is unrepresented and a litigant in person. The first defendant is the Attorney-General (\u201cAG\u201d) representing the Singapore Police Force (\u201cSPF\u201d) sued pursuant to the Government Proceedings Act (Cap 121, 1985 Rev Ed) (\u201cGPA\u201d) s 19(3). The second defendant is the police officer who took Mr Mah into custody on 7 July 2017 under s 7 of the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) Act (Cap 178A, 2012 Rev Ed) (\u201cMHCTA\u201d), while the third defendant is a police officer who was at the Central Police Division Regional Lock-Up (\u201cRLU\u201d), to which Mr Mah was taken. Following information received via the SPF emergency call line from the complainant, the second defendant was dispatched to the incident location (ie, Suntec City). He interviewed the complainant before speaking to Mr Mah. In the course of doing so, he formed the view that Mr Mah was mentally disordered and by reason of that disorder posed a danger. Consequently, he proceeded, with the assistance of two more police officers, to arrest him under s 7 of the MHCTA.', '7\\u2003The claim arises from Mr Mah\u2019s allegation that he was wrongfully arrested and falsely imprisoned. He says he was subjected to assault and suffered physical and mental trauma. He also claims that his personal property, namely his bag and mobile phone, were negligently damaged.', '8\\u2003This action was commenced by Mr Mah pursuant to leave granted by the Court of Appeal on 5 March 2020 under s 25 of the MHCTA.', '9\\u2003Mr Mah sought discovery of various recordings made by closed-circuit television cameras (\u201cCCTV\u201d) and body-worn cameras (\u201cBWC\u201d). Mr Mah took the position that, while the government was entitled to invoke the doctrine of public interest immunity, the public interest in the administration of justice in this case outweighed any public interest in non-disclosure.', '10\\u2003The AG argued that both the CCTV and BWC recordings were absolutely protected from disclosure by virtue of s 126 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (\u201cEA\u201d). Section 126 of the EA provides:', '11\\u2003The AG relied on the Court of Appeal decision in Zainal bin Kuning and others v Chan Sin Mian Michael and another [1996] 2 SLR(R) 858 (\u201cZainal Kuning\u201d) at [32] to [33], to support its argument that while it is for the court to decide whether the communication in question was made to the public officer in official confidence, the determination by that public officer that the public interest would suffer by the disclosure is conclusive pursuant to s 126 of the EA. 1', 'In short, the AG contended that there is no room for the balancing by the court of the public interest in the administration of justice against the public interest in the efficient and confidential functioning of the public service. However, seeking a compromise that would in their view accommodate the interests of justice, the AG agreed to permit inspection by viewing of the footage at the Police Cantonment Complex, but not the taking of copies, and, in the case of the BWC recordings, that they be pixelated prior to inspection so as to protect the identity of the complainant. 2', 'The AG also confirmed that at any trial of this matter it would make the footage available for admission into evidence by viewing in camera pursuant to s 8 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) (\u201cSCJA\u201d). 3', '12\\u2003The assistant registrar agreed with the submissions of the AG and made an order that the defendants were to file and serve a supplemental list of documents on Mr Mah listing: (i) all CCTV footage of Mr Mah\u2019s entire imprisonment in the RLU; and, (ii) BWC recordings showing the second defendant interviewing the complainant. However, Mr Mah was limited to having inspection of these recordings rather than being permitted to have copies of them. Further, in relation to the BWC recordings, the defendants were permitted to \u201cpixelate\u201d the images in order to conceal the identity of the complainant.', '13\\u2003 Mr Mah, being dissatisfied, appealed, seeking to have copies of the CCTV and BWC, without any pixelation being permitted.

The defendant\u2019s ash wastes would be disposed into a different skip bin because the ash would be \u201csent to another location\u201d (ie, the Pulau Semakau landfill) and not the NEA incineration plant. 32', 'That skip bin, according to the plaintiff and which was not contested by the defendant, was labelled \u201cB\u201d 33', '(whereas the plaintiff contends that Skip Bin A10 was deployed exclusively at the Defendant\u2019s Premises for the disposal of general waste at the material time 34', '). The skip bin provided by the plaintiff for the defendant\u2019s disposal of ash wastes is not the subject matter of the present dispute.', '15\\u2003After a careful review of the CCTV footage, I have tabulated below a timeline of the key events that occurred after the contents of Skip Bin A10 were unloaded onto the floor of the Sorting Yard at the Premises at about 6.23pm (ie, 18:17 hours CCTV time). 35', 'As the CCTV timestamps are represented in the 24-hour clock format, I have used the same format.', '16\\u2003As a point of clarification, whilst in the tabulation above I have referred to fires F1 to F6, the parties\u2019 experts disagree on whether there were six fires, as the defendant\u2019s expert contends, or only one fire as the plaintiff\u2019s expert contends. The plaintiff\u2019s expert\u2019s disagreement is on the basis that the \u201cspots of fires on the waste piles in the sorting area were not new fires. They were the result of fire spread from the initial fire\u201d. 36', 'The respective expert witnesses do not dispute that some of the \u201cspots of fires\u201d were the result of \u201cfire spread\u201d. This is unsurprising since the material events at the Sorting Yard are recorded by the plaintiff\u2019s CCTV. Hence, in substance, the respective expert witnesses are describing the same series of events. In any case, in my view, the difference is of no material significance to the issues in the present case. 37', '17\\u2003In this judgment, I refer to the fires as F1 to F6 respectively for ease of reference and to be more precise. A summary of the various fires at the Sorting Yard is set out below:', '18\\u2003From the CCTV footage as summarised above, several of the earlier fires, namely F1 to F3, appear to have been successfully extinguished by the plaintiff\u2019s own firefighting efforts. It is also undisputed that the Plaintiff\u2019s Premises were fitted with a water mist system; this system, when activated, sprays water mist downwards from the ceiling of the Sorting Yard to reduce dust generated from the waste sorting operations. It is not in dispute, and is quite apparent from the CCTV footage, that the plaintiff\u2019s water mist system was activated at the Sorting Yard in the course of the plaintiff\u2019s firefighting efforts as one of the firefighting measures the plaintiff undertook. According to the Fire Investigation Report of the Singapore Civil Defence Force (\u201cSCDF\u201d), the water mist system was activated at about 6:37:11pm. 39', 'Ms Lim, on the other hand, notes that the water mist system was activated at about 18:34:37. This is, however, not a material difference and none of the issues in the present case turns on precisely what time the water mist system was activated. For purposes of my decision and having reviewed the CCTV recordings, I estimate that the water mist system was activated at about 6.35pm, approximately three minutes before the large explosion referred to at S\/No. 22 in the tabulation of key events at [15] above.', '19\\u2003Mr Cai called the SCDF at about 6.40pm. The first SCDF firefighting unit arrived at the Plaintiff\u2019s Premises some five minutes and 37 seconds after the call. Five fire engines and other rescue vehicles were subsequently dispatched as reinforcement. 40', 'Using water and foam to fight the fire, 41', 'the SCDF managed to bring the fire under control at about 10pm. Damping down operations continued until the following morning. 42', '20\\u2003In its investigations, the SCDF observed burnt \u201cremnants of cylindrical objects among the pile of waste\u201d and similar cylindrical objects \u201cat multiple points across the floor\u201d of the Sorting Yard. Several unaffected light-coloured packages were recovered and submitted to the Forensic Chemistry and Physics Laboratory of the Health Sciences Authority (the \u201cHSA\u201d) for chemical analysis. 43', 'Photographs of the unaffected light-coloured packages show that the packages were labelled. The labels on those packages indicate that there were at least four types of unfinished and unsealed lithium batteries present at the Plaintiff\u2019s Premises. Photographs of the four differently labelled packages are at Annexures 3 and 4 respectively of this judgment. 44', 'To appreciate the number of light-coloured packages containing the Lithium Batteries that were unloaded from Skip Bin A10 on the day in question, I have reproduced, at Annex 5 of this judgment, two screenshots from the CCTV footage at approximately 6.23pm (from Camera 2) and approximately 6.24pm (from Camera 13). It is not disputed that these light-coloured packages were among the last of the contents unloaded from Skip Bin A10 onto the floor of the Sorting Yard.', '21\\u2003During the clean-up efforts after the incident, \u201chundreds of batteries\u201d were found \u201con the floor at many parts of the Plaintiff\u2019s Premises including the workshop, the weighbridge area and the open area beside the weighbridge\u201d. 45', 'The plaintiff was required by the authorities to \u201cdispose of the batteries found at the Plaintiff\u2019s Premises\u201d after the fire and requested the defendant to \u201cprovide a quotation to dispose of such batteries\u201d, which the defendant did. 46', 'In an invoice from the defendant dated 15 August 2017 and received by the plaintiff on 21 August 2017, the defendant invoiced the plaintiff a sum of $139.10 for the \u201cDISPOSAL OF SOLID WASTE (WASTE BATTERY)\u201d amounting to \u201c200.00KGS\u201d. 47', 'The defendant did collect the Lithium Batteries from the plaintiff and disposed of them on or about 21 August 2017. According to the defendant, it treated these batteries as used or exhausted batteries which it could collect and dispose of as toxic waste, as opposed to lithium batteries which it was not licenced to collect. 48', '22\\u2003In its report, the SCDF concluded that the \u201cgeneral waste materials usually collected by the company, such as wood, paper and plastics were unlikely to create such effects as the ignition fuel, as they do not support spontaneous combustion\u201d. The fuel for the fire was the \u201ccylindrical objects containing lithium\u201d and there were \u201cno other possible ignition sources at the determined area of fire origin\u201d. 49', 'The defendant\u2019s expert, Ms Lim (a chemist and forensic scientist), opined that \u201cthe unsealed lithium batteries and bare jelly rolls\u201d found at the Sorting Yard posed \u201csignificant fire and explosion hazards.\u201d 50', 'Both the plaintiff\u2019s expert, Mr Tan Jin Thong (a former Deputy Commissioner of the SCDF) and Ms Lim, were in agreement that the source of the fires and explosion were the Lithium Batteries. 51', 'However, notwithstanding this agreement, it was a major bone of contention between the parties whether the presence of the Lithium Batteries at the Sorting Yard was, in fact and in law, the proximate cause of the fires and eventual explosion, and in respect of which the defendant should bear legal liability to the plaintiff. I consider all of these issues in greater detail later in this judgment.'"}

Her responsibility was to ensure the smooth \noperation of some food and drink stalls at one such food court and in \nthis capacity she was entrusted with money from two safes. One of these \ncontained the daily cash proceeds from the stalls, which was kept in a \nsafe box (\u201cSales Safe\u201d) until they were handed over to a security \ncompany. The other was a safe box which contained a cash float of \n$20,000 (\u201cFloat Safe\u201d).

As for the appellant\u2019s ill health, \nthe DJ held that \u201cthere was no evidence to suggest that there was any causal link \nbetween [her] illnesses and her commissioning [sic] of the offences\u201d (GD at \n[67]). The DJ was \u201cconfident that the Singapore Prison Services would have the \nnecessary and proper medical facilities to deal [with] and take care of the \n[appellant\u2019s] medical conditions during the period of her incarceration\u201d (GD at \n[69]). There were no \u201cexceptional circumstances from which humanitarian \nconsideration had arisen which outweighed public interest to warrant a discount \nin the [appellant\u2019s] sentence\u201d so as to justify the court exercising judicial mercy \nin this case (GD at [70]).\n7 Finally, the DJ noted from the sentencing precedents tendered by both \nparties that the sentencing range for a first-time offender who had committed \nVersion No 1: 26 Aug 2021 (17:59 hrs)\nChua Ya Zi Sandy v PP[2021] SGHC 204\n4criminal breach of trust as an employee for sums involving $30,000 to $50,000 \nwould be in the range of between 9 and 15 months\u2019 imprisonment (GD at [71]). \nHaving considered the foregoing factors and the sentencing precedents, the DJ \nsentenced the appellant to 10 months\u2019 imprisonment (GD at [79]).\n8 In my judgment, this was a fair assessment of the aggravating and \nmitigating circumstances in this case; it also correctly identified the sentencing \nrange for a case such as the present. I make one observation on the question of \nrestitution. This can be relevant from a number of perspectives. Restitution may \nbe relevant because it reduces the harm suffered by the victim; or it may \nevidence genuine remorse on the part of the offender. The lack of restitution \nwould typically be a neutral factor, save in the case of an offender who fails to \nmake restitution despite having the means to do so. Such an offender would \nseem intent on benefiting from his crime and this would often, if not invariably, \nbe an aggravating factor: see for instance the observations of Tay Yong Kwang \nJ (as he then was) in Goldring, Timothy Nicholas v Public Prosecutor and other"}

I will refer to those findings as necessary.', '15\\u2003The background to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim against PNGSDP goes back to 1976. That was when the State and an Australian multinational mining company now known as BHP Group Limited (\u201cBHP Group\u201d) incorporated OTML to own and operate the Mine.', '16\\u2003OTML shares were held as follows for most of its existence.

That background need not be repeated here. It suffices for present purposes to say that a key part of the exit plan was for BHP Minerals to divest its entire 52% shareholding in OTML to a special purpose vehicle.', '21\\u2003PNGSDP was incorporated in Singapore in October 2001 to be that special purpose vehicle. 26', 'PNGSDP\u2019s corporate constitution is set out in three documents: (a) its Memorandum of Association (\u201cthe Memorandum\u201d); (b) its Articles of Association (\u201cthe Articles\u201d); and (c) a schedule to the Articles called the \u201cProgram Rules\u201d. 27', '22\\u2003Clause 3 of the Memorandum sets out PNGSDP\u2019s three objects (\u201cthe Objects\u201d).

I analyse PNGSDP\u2019s contractual obligations under the Program Rules in greater detail at [77]\u2013[79] below. For now, it suffices to note the following two points.', '24\\u2003First, the central provision of the Program Rules obliges PNGSDP to establish a fund known as the Long Term Fund. The purpose of the Long Term Fund is to hold, broadly speaking, two thirds of all Distributions and the accumulated investment income earned on the Long Term Fund. 29', 'Under the Program Rules, PNGSDP undertook express contractual obligations to its members as to how it was to apply: (a) Distributions; (b) the Long Term Fund; and (c) investment income earned on the Long Term fund.', '25\\u2003Second, cl 9 of the Program Rules, among other things, both permits and obliges PNGSDP to apply the Distributions for the benefit of two classes of people: (a) the people of the Western Province; and (b) the people of Papua New Guinea (see [78]\u2013[79] below). 30', 'Both of these classes include, but are not confined to, members of Affected Communities. This is because not all of the communities in the Western Province were affected by the environmental damage caused by the Mine.

Four of those steps are relevant for present purposes.', '27\\u2003First, BHP Group, OTML and OTML\u2019s four shareholders (including the State and BHP Minerals) entered into a contract known as The Ok Tedi Mine Continuation (Ninth Supplemental) Agreement (\u201cNinth Supplemental Agreement\u201d). 33', 'By this contract, BHP Group confirmed its intention to exit OTML and agreed that BHP Minerals should transfer the Shares to PNGSDP. 34', '28\\u2003Second, PNGSDP entered into a contract known as the \u201cMaster Agreement\u201d with BHP Group, OTML and OTML\u2019s shareholders (including the State and BHP Minerals). 35', 'By cl 3.1 of the Master Agreement, BHP Minerals agreed to transfer the Shares to PNGSDP. 36', 'The consideration for this transfer was PNGSDP\u2019s contractual undertaking in cl 3.2 of the Master Agreement to comply with the Program Rules. 37', 'PNGSDP gave this undertaking expressly for the benefit of four entities: BHP Minerals, BHP Group, the State and OTML. PNGSDP thereby gave each of these four entities a direct right to enforce the Program Rules against it, separate from and independent of its obligation to the members of PNGSDP for the time being to comply with the Program Rules as a component of PNGSDP\u2019s corporate constitution.', '29\\u2003Third, PNGSDP executed two deeds of indemnity: one in favour of BHP Group (\u201cBHP\u2019s Indemnity\u201d) 38', 'and another in favour of the State (\u201cthe State\u2019s Indemnity\u201d). 39', 'Under BHP\u2019s Indemnity, PNGSDP agreed to indemnify BHP Group, its subsidiaries (including BHP Minerals but not OTML) and all of those subsidiaries\u2019 directors, officers and employees for any and all liability arising from any future environmental damage caused by the Mine, including BHP\u2019s liability to the State. Under the State\u2019s Indemnity, PNGSDP agreed to indemnify the State, its political subdivisions, instrumentalities and authorities and any Minister or officer of such instrumentality and authority acting in that capacity against all liability arising from any environmental damage caused by the Mine.', '30\\u2003Finally, in February 2002, as security for the punctual performance of its obligations under BHP\u2019s Indemnity and the State\u2019s Indemnity, PNGSDP entered into a security deed (\u201cthe Security Deed\u201d), 40', 'an equitable mortgage over the Shares (\u201cthe Equitable Mortgage\u201d) 41', 'and a security trust deed (\u201cthe Security Trust Deed\u201d. 42', 'I shall refer to these three contracts collectively as \u201cthe Security Arrangements\u201d. 43', '31\\u2003The parties to the Security Deed are PNGSDP, OTML and the Security Trustee. 44', 'By the Security Deed, PNGSDP created an equitable mortgage over Distributions and a fixed and floating charge over virtually all of PNGSDP\u2019s present and future assets in favour of the Security Trustee for the benefit of the State and BHP as security for the punctual performance of its obligations under BHP\u2019s Indemnity and the State\u2019s Indemnity.

The Security Trust Deed sets out the rights, duties, powers and immunities of the Security Trustee and, in particular, how it is to enforce its security rights under the Security Deed and the Equitable Mortgage and how it is obliged to distribute the proceeds of any such enforcement as between the many persons for whose ultimate benefit PNGSDP had granted the security.', '34\\u2003In 2013, during an intractable dispute between the State and PNGSDP over control of PNGSDP which led to the earlier litigation in Singapore (see [11]\u2013[13] above), the State expropriated PNGSDP\u2019s 52% shareholding in OTML without compensation. 47', 'It did this by enacting legislation 48', 'which cancelled the Shares and obliged OTML to issue to the State new shares equivalent to 52% of its issued and paid-up share capital.', '35\\u2003As a result of this legislation, PNGSDP ceased to be a shareholder of OTML in 2013. PNGSDP therefore ceased receiving any Distributions in and from 2013.

Article 5.3 read with GC 26.2 further cemented the position that liquidated damages would only start to accrue if Mechanical Completion was not achieved within this extended time.', '17\\u2003In essence, GC 40 allowed for the extension of time for Mechanical Completion and hence a reduction in the amount of liquidated damages payable upon any delay. The extension of time for Mechanical Completion was subject to three contractual conditions: (a) that the delay on CAJ\u2019s or CAK\u2019s part was attributable to B; (b) the submission of a notice of claim justifying the extension as soon as reasonably practicable; and (c) CAJ or CAK was to use its reasonable efforts to minimise any delay in the performance of their obligations. As will be seen later in this judgment, GC 40 is a central feature of CAI\u2019s application.', '18\\u2003In OS 1103, CAI asks that the Tribunal\u2019s decision to grant the defendants a 25-day extension of time in respect of delays that occurred in the mechanical completion of the Plant be set aside. The granting of the extension of time resulted in a corresponding reduction of 25 days\u2019 worth of liquidated damages (amounting to 2.5% of the contract price) that were adjudged by the Tribunal to be payable by the defendants to the Arbitration Claimants. The Arbitration Claimants were hence granted only 74 days\u2019 worth of liquidated damages by the Tribunal, instead of the 99 days\u2019 worth of liquidated damages sought.', '19\\u2003Although the contract prices were expressed in a number of different foreign currencies, 9', 'I use the Singapore dollar as a neutral currency (based on current exchange rates) to preserve confidentiality in this judgment. At a rate of 0.1% of the respective final contract prices for each day of liquidated damages, 10', 'the difference between 99 days\u2019 worth of liquidated damages and 74 days\u2019 worth of liquidated damages was approximately S$20 million. Consequently, CAI also asks that the liquidated damages payable to it be increased correspondingly. 11', '20\\u2003The defendants ran into a gamut of problems during the construction of the Plant. Mechanical Completion was delayed due to: (a) the failure of the hydrogen unit (\u201cH2 unit\u201d) of the Plant to produce the required purity of hydrogen necessary for the production of polysilicon; and (b) excessive vibrations in compressors located in the H2 unit. Only the second vibration related problem is relevant to OS 1103, and I will refer to it as the \u201cVibration Issue\u201d.', '21\\u2003In summary, 12', 'the Plant included a H2 unit with six compressors. These compressors would sufficiently pressurise hydrogen before forcing it through a multi-stage purification apparatus that would allow the H2 unit to produce purified hydrogen gas for the production of polysilicon. On 25 January 2013, CAK informed the manufacturer of the compressor motors that the compressors were exhibiting abnormal and excessive vibrations (\u201cAbnormal Vibrations\u201d), far exceeding any levels of vibrations that were deemed safe by the International Organisation for Standardisation.', '22\\u2003For context, the Abnormal Vibrations were impermissible as they could damage the compressors and any connected systems, as well as render the Plant unsafe and\/or inoperable, particularly given the highly combustible and explosive properties of hydrogen. 13', 'On 27 February 2013, a day before the deadline for Mechanical Completion, CAK apologised to B for the \u201csignificant trouble caused by the delay in the hand-over\u201d of the H2 unit and requested that B proceed to issue the Notice of Mechanical Completion by 28 February 2013 despite acknowledging that the Abnormal Vibrations remained. 14', '23\\u2003On 1 March 2013, B rejected CAK\u2019s request to issue the Notice of Mechanical Completion and suggested that in respect of the Abnormal Vibrations in the H2 unit, parties agree on \u201cpermanent measures based on an investigation into the causes and a schedule for the measures, and make sure that the schedule does not impact [B\u2019s] commissioning schedule\u201d [emphasis added] 15', '(\u201c1 March 2013 Email\u201d).', '24\\u2003On the same day, the Abnormal Vibrations caused a high-voltage power cable connection to break and melt a steel plate in the terminal box of one of the compressors. On 3 March 2013, the Abnormal Vibrations had still not been rectified. From about 5 March 2013, B and CAK began to discuss the implementation of temporary countermeasures to rectify the issue and began implementing them. However, not only did these temporary countermeasures fail to resolve the Vibration Issue, they instead caused the vibrations to increase.', '25\\u2003On 11 March 2013, the defendants prepared a schedule for the implementation of proposed permanent countermeasures (\u201cPiecemeal Rectification Schedule\u201d), which contemplated that the countermeasures to reduce the Abnormal Vibrations would be implemented in a piecemeal fashion. It envisaged that the rectification works would be performed on two out of six compressors at a time (\u201cPiecemeal Rectification Works\u201d). 16', 'Each tranche of the Piecemeal Rectification Works was projected to take 23 days.', '26\\u2003Meanwhile, the Abnormal Vibrations worsened further and even caused an operational shut down of the Plant on 18 March 2013.', '27\\u2003On 2 April 2013, CAK provided an updated schedule to B on the implementation of permanent countermeasures (\u201cUpdated Rectification Schedule\u201d) 17', '. This schedule too provided for Piecemeal Rectification Works.', '28\\u2003On or about 12 April 2013, CAK began the process of implementing its proposed permanent countermeasures; this process was completed by 21 June 2013. 18', 'On 22 July 2013, it was confirmed that the permanent countermeasures had succeeded in reducing the vibration levels of the compressor motors to acceptable levels. 19', '29\\u2003The crucial point to note about the 1 March 2013 Email is that it formed the basis on which B instructed the defendants to carry out piecemeal rectification of the compressors, ie, only two at a time, as opposed to concurrent rectification which would have required all six compressors to be shut down. 20', 'This was so that the rectification works would not affect the Plant\u2019s commissioning schedule. 21', 'This was admitted by the Arbitration Claimants in the Arbitration. As will be seen below, the 1 March 2013 Email played a significant role in the Tribunal\u2019s eventual decision to allow a 25-day extension of time to the defendants (see below at [53]). 22', 'The piecemeal nature of the rectification works had the effect of occasioning further delays to the defendants\u2019 work schedule and thus contributed to the delay in Mechanical Completion. I refer to B\u2019s instruction based on the 1 March 2013 Email as the \u201cAdmitted Instruction\u201d.', '30\\u2003It is undisputed that the defendants never requested an extension from B of the deadline for Mechanical Completion, nor complied with the notice provision in GC 40.2. As such, no extension of time was ever granted to the defendants by B. 23', '31\\u2003The crux of CAI\u2019s case in OS 1103 is that the Tribunal had wrongly considered and accepted the defendants\u2019 \u201centirely new defence\u201d that they were entitled to an ex post facto extension of time under GC 40 to achieve Mechanical Completion of the Plant. The basis of the extension was that the Admitted Instruction had occasioned further delays to the defendants\u2019 work schedule and thus contributed to the delay in Mechanical Completion. To fully appreciate the issues in play and the gravamen of CAI\u2019s complaint in OS 1103 as summarised above, it is necessary to lay out the procedural history of the Arbitration in some detail, focussing on the pleadings of the parties, the issues that they had submitted for the Tribunal\u2019s decision, and the course the Arbitration took until the Award was rendered by the Tribunal.', '32\\u2003On 10 June 2016, B commenced the Arbitration by filing its request for arbitration (\u201cRequest for Arbitration\u201d) with the International Court of Arbitration of the ICC pursuant to the 2012 ICC Rules (\u201cICC Rules\u201d). 24', 'On 27 July 2016, the defendants provided their answer to the Request for Arbitration (\u201cAnswer to the Request for Arbitration\u201d).', '33\\u2003On 8 March 2017, B submitted a request for the joinder of CAI to the Arbitration with the mutual consent of the defendants. This request was allowed by the ICC Court on 10 March 2017. 25', '34\\u2003Pursuant to Art 23 of the ICC Rules, the parties submitted an amended terms of reference on 10 March 2017 which included a summary of the parties\u2019 claims, defences and a list of issues to be determined by the Tribunal (\u201cTerms of Reference\u201d). 26', 'In respect of the Vibration Issue, the Arbitration Claimants sought liquidated damages amounting to approximately S$80m under both Agreements. 27', 'They alleged that the defendants had caused a 144-day delay in Mechanical Completion due to the Abnormal Vibrations in the compressors within the H2 unit. 28', '35\\u2003The defendants\u2019 response was two-fold. First, no liquidated damages were payable because the defendants had achieved Mechanical Completion prior to the grace period ending on 14 March 2013. They argued that the Abnormal Vibrations did not materially affect the operation or safety of the Plant such that the rectification was not in fact required. The defendants also contended that, in the alternative, any delay to Mechanical Completion was a result of the Admitted Instruction, such that the Arbitration Claimants had waived their right to insist on the completion of the rectification work as a requirement for Mechanical Completion and to seek liquidated damages. Alternatively, they were estopped from doing so. 29', 'In the Final Award, the Tribunal understood the former to be the main defence put forth by the defendants in respect of the Vibration Issue. 30', '36\\u2003In the defendants\u2019 amended statement of defence and counterclaim dated 13 April 2017 (\u201cAmended Defence and Counterclaim\u201d), the defendants responded to the Vibration Issue as follows: 31', '37\\u2003The defendants elaborated on the portion in bold at paragraph 20.9 of the Amended Statement of Defence and Counterclaim by pleading that \u201c[a]s a result of B\u2019s instructions to carry out work on a piecemeal basis, rectification (which could have been completed within 24 days) was instead completed on 21 June 2013\u201d. Paragraph 20.9 was accompanied by footnote 116, which referred to the date on which rectification works were completed as follows:', '38\\u2003The defendants then used the next footnote 117 to introduce a defence of waiver and estoppel, framed as follows: 32', 'For clarity, I adopt CAI\u2019s terminology in OS 1103 and refer to the waiver and estoppel defence collectively as the \u201cEstoppel Defence\u201d. The point worth noting here is that the defendants remained silent as to, and did not plead, any contractual entitlement to an extension of time under GC 40. 33', '39\\u2003The Arbitration Claimants\u2019 response in their amended reply and defence to counterclaim dated 25 November 2017 (\u201cAmended Reply and Defence to Counterclaim\u201d) was that \u201cthe reference to 24 days in paragraph 20.9 is not supported by any evidence, and the [defendants] are put to proof of the same\u201d. 34', 'They pointed out that the \u201csimple answer\u201d to the Estoppel Defence was that GC 3.9 required that any \u201cwaiver\u201d of a party\u2019s rights had to be in writing and that the right and extent of such waiver had to be specified. The Arbitration Claimants added that no such signed written waiver had ever been provided by them, nor would a waiver of such extensive scope have been authorised. They categorically denied the presence of any representations that could ground such an estoppel or waiver. 35', '40\\u2003In a similar vein to [39] above, the Arbitration Claimants expressly pleaded at paragraph 217 of their Amended Reply and Defence to Counterclaim in relation to another aspect of the dispute that the defendants had not advanced any claim for a contractual extension of time under GC 40 in response to the Arbitration Claimants\u2019 claims for liquidated damages against the defendants. The Arbitration Claimants also conceded that B had given CAK specific instructions to carry out the Piecemeal Rectification Works on the compressors so as to reduce further disruption to the commissioning of the Plant, ie, the Admitted Instruction. 36', '41\\u2003Parties exchanged draft lists of issues in early February 2018 but were unable to arrive at a consensus on a consolidated list. 37', 'Nevertheless, it remains undisputed by the parties that the various lists of issues did not include any express reference to whether the defendants were entitled to an extension of time in accordance with GC 40. Nor was there any mention, in the draft lists, of how long the rectification works would have taken if they had been carried out concurrently on all six compressors (\u201cConcurrent Rectification Works\u201d) as opposed to on a piecemeal basis.', '42\\u2003In or about late February 2018, the parties filed their respective written opening submissions. Both parties reiterated their previously pleaded positions in respect of the Vibration Issue and the Estoppel Defence. 38', 'In particular, the defendants argued that their estimate of 24 days for Concurrent Rectification Works to be completed (or 30 days allowing for initial detailed design and procurement) was based off the Rectification Work Schedule of 11 March 2013 prepared for the Piecemeal Rectification Works. 39', 'As such, but for the Admitted Instruction to carry out Piecemeal Rectification Works, permanent concurrent rectification works could have been completed within 30 days from 11 March 2013. Again, at this point, there was no mention in the defendants\u2019 opening submissions of any reliance on GC 40 to seek a contractual extension of time.', '43\\u2003The oral hearing in the Arbitration was conducted from 5 to 13 March 2018. 40', 'Prior to the filing of written closing submissions, both parties presented oral closing arguments before the Tribunal on 13 March 2018. More will be said about the oral closing hearing later in this judgment (see [121] and [206] onwards) as certain parts of the exchanges between the Tribunal members and the parties\u2019 counsel are of relevance to the positions taken by the parties in OS 1103. Thereafter, the defendants filed their written closing submissions on 6 April 2018 (\u201cDefendants\u2019 Closing Submissions\u201d). The defendants recognised that the Vibration Issue was the \u201cprimary basis on which [the Arbitration Claimants] argue that [the defendants] failed to achieve Mechanical Completion on time\u201d 41', 'and thus maintained their primary defence that the Abnormal Vibrations had not materially affected the operation or safety of the Plant. 42', 'The defendants also put forth two further alternative defences of note: (a) the doctrine of waiver and\/or promissory estoppel prevented the Arbitration Claimants from insisting on any entitlement to be paid liquidated damages (ie, the Estoppel Defence); 43', 'and (b) for the first time, the defendants raised GC 40 and sought an extension of time of 71 days (\u201cEOT Defence\u201d).', '44\\u2003The EOT Defence as raised and elucidated in the Defendants\u2019 Closing Submissions played a central role in the Award on the Vibration Issue, and in OS 1103. It is thus worth reproducing it in full. The defendants argued that they were entitled to a 71-day extension of time to perform their obligation under the Agreements to achieve Mechanical Completion because: 44', 'Leveraging on this, the defendants then submitted that they would, if at all, be liable for only 28 days\u2019 worth of liquidated damages from 25 May to 21 June 2013, ie, excluding the period starting from 28 February 2013, the 14-day grace period plus 71 days.', '45\\u2003It is common ground between the parties that the EOT defence was introduced for the first time in the Defendants\u2019 Closing Submissions in the Arbitration. 45', '46\\u2003The Arbitration Claimants then filed their written closing submissions 21 days later on 27 April 2018 (\u201cArbitration Claimants\u2019 Closing Submissions\u201d). There, the Arbitration Claimants, inter alia, objected to several arguments that had been raised in the Defendants\u2019 Closing Submissions which were not pleaded, including the EOT Defence. With regard to the EOT Defence specifically, the Arbitration Claimants objected to the EOT Defence in the following terms: 46', '47\\u2003The paragraphs quoted above also feature centrally in OS 1103 and I consider them later in this judgment.', '48\\u2003Further correspondence was subsequently exchanged between the parties and the Tribunal (see below at [139]) on other matters that did not involve the EOT Defence. The Tribunal declared the proceedings to be closed on 10 September 2018. At that point in time, the admissibility of the EOT Defence which the Arbitration Claimants had objected to had not yet been ruled on by the Tribunal.', '49\\u2003Some six months later, the Tribunal rendered its final award on 11 March 2019 (\u201cFinal Award\u201d) and an Addendum to the Final Award on 30 May 2019. 47', 'I shall refer to them collectively as the \u201cAward\u201d. Where reference is made in this judgment to paragraphs of the Award, this should be taken as referring to the relevant paragraphs within the Final Award unless otherwise stated.', '50\\u2003The Tribunal found that the defendants had failed to resolve the Abnormal Vibrations in the H2 unit and therefore failed to achieve Mechanical Completion before the liquidated damages provisions came into play. It therefore found in favour of the Arbitration Claimants in respect of liability on the Vibration Issue. 48', '51\\u2003The Tribunal also rejected the Estoppel Defence. The Tribunal found that the Arbitration Claimants had not waived their rights to rely upon the liquidated damages provisions \u201cby way of any express written statement\u201d as required under GC 3.9 (Award at paragraph 235). GC 3.9 required several prerequisites to be fulfilled before any waiver of the Agreements could have contractual effect and it was common ground that none of these prerequisites had been completed. The Estoppel Defence had also not been sufficiently pleaded or particularised (Award at paragraph 240).', '52\\u2003The Tribunal then turned to the EOT Defence. With regard to the objections raised by the Arbitration Claimants (see [46] above), this was the Tribunal\u2019s response: 49', '290. \\u2003However, the Tribunal regards the [defendants\u2019] \u2018new\u2019 argument as being perfectly capable of consideration by the Tribunal because:', '53\\u2003The Tribunal thus went on to consider the substance of the EOT Defence. The Tribunal found that while the defendants had caused Mechanical Completion to be delayed by 99 days (after factoring in the 14-day grace period), it was \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d (using the language of GC 40) to extend time by a period of 25 days. Consequently, the Arbitration Claimants were only entitled to receive liquidated damages for 74 days (Award at paragraph 269), ie, 99 days less an extension of time of 25 days. In connection with this, the Tribunal made five key findings and\/or observations germane to OS 1103:', '(a)\\u2003it was common ground between the parties that the defendants had not complied with the notice provisions under GC 40.2 and that the Arbitration Claimants had never formally granted an EOT to CAK under the Onshore Agreement (Award at paragraph 285);', '(b)\\u2003compliance with the notice provisions in GC 40.2 was not a condition precedent for the Tribunal to grant an EOT to the defendants pursuant to GC 40.1 (Award at paragraphs 286, 292, 304\u2013306);', '(c)\\u2003the Tribunal had a \u201cwide discretion in determining the length of any EOT granted under [GC 40.1]\u201d as the provision provides that any EOT must fairly and reasonably \u201cin all the circumstances\u201d reflect the delay or impediment suffered by CAK (Award at paragraph 312);', '(d)\\u2003if there had been no Piecemeal Rectification Works, CAK would have fixed the Vibration Issue more promptly than the actual time taken for the permanent countermeasures to be implemented, ie, via concurrent rectification works on all six compressors simultaneously (Award at paragraphs 314\u2013316); and', '(e)\\u2003the defendants had carried out Piecemeal Rectification Works upon the Admitted Instruction. The piecemeal nature of the works was to the \u201cdirect advantage\u201d of B who would otherwise have had to wait to commence the commissioning of the Plant. This also compromised the defendants\u2019 ability to use their concerted efforts to fix the Abnormal Vibrations (Award at paragraphs 314\u2013324, in particular paragraph 322).', '54\\u2003The Tribunal acknowledged that detailed evidence concerning how CAK would have gone about rectifying the Abnormal Vibrations but for the Piecemeal Rectification Schedule, was not before it (Award at paragraphs 313, 333 and 335). It accepted that there was no precise expert or factual evidence establishing the difference in time for rectification but found that such evidence would have only amounted to circumstantial evidence of CAK\u2019s intention in the early months of 2013. The Tribunal did not think that this evidence would have been of much assistance as it would still have to form its own view on the extent to which B\u2019s actions increased the time taken for the rectification of the Vibration Issue (Award at paragraph 314).', '55\\u2003Even though there was \u201cno direct evidence\u201d before it \u201cestablishing how long permanent counter-measures would have taken to be implemented, absent B\u2019s involvement in the issue\u201d, the Tribunal saw itself as being capable of fairly and reasonably determining a time period which reflected the delay or impediment suffered by CAK, as required under GC 40.1 (Award at paragraph 327).', '56\\u2003The Tribunal then concluded that taking into account \u201call the evidence and its experience in these matters\u201d [emphasis added], a 25-day extension of time would be an appropriate EOT to grant to CAK, to reflect the delay occasioned by B by its insistence that rectification works be carried out on a piecemeal basis (Award at paragraph 334).', '57\\u2003Finally, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, the period of 25 days reflected the Arbitration Claimants\u2019 own culpability, which the Tribunal assessed at \u201caround 25%\u201d.', '58\\u2003On 29 August 2019, CAI filed OS 1103.'"}

Kong\u2019s Letter reiterated JustCo\u2019s Response, insisted that the Membership Agreement remained in effect and binding, that JustCo did not agree to its termination and it did not accept that the Membership Agreement was frustrated.', '42\\u2003On 22 July 2020, Dathena\u2019s solicitors sent a letter of demand (\u201cDathena\u2019s Letter of Demand\u201d) to JustCo requiring refund of the Deposit within 14 days. 49', '43\\u2003On 27 July 2020, Song responded on JustCo\u2019s behalf to Dathena\u2019s Letter of Demand reiterating JustCo\u2019s Response and added in paras 4 and 5: 50', '44\\u2003The comment in the first sentence in para 4(d) seems to suggest that no one in JustCo had apprised Song of the fact that JustCo had been informed by Dathena on 10 April 2020 that its lease at OGS expired on 5 May 2020 and it needed to have a new office immediately thereafter (as mentioned at [20(b)]). Indeed, it was Sian-Tzu\u2019s testimony that from the outset (in November 2019), she knew that Dathena\u2019s lease at OGS would expire in May 2020. 51', '45\\u2003The last sentence in 4(d) above seemed to imply that it was Dathena\u2019s financial situation or difficulties that motivated the Notice of Termination and its need to reduce its headcount and office space. This was a reliance by JustCo on the notes that Sian-Tzu purportedly made of the meeting on 10 April 2020 with Dathena but, as noted earlier at [20], Aida had contested those comments. In any case, Song\u2019s surmise is at odds with the fact that Dathena\u2019s lease at No 43 Niven Road and No 11 Blair Road (as mentioned at [40]) was for space that was even larger than the OCBC Premises. Moreover, in its closing submissions, 52', 'JustCo disclosed its \u201cbusiness was badly hit by the financial pressures brought about by the pandemic\u201d. Indeed, JustCo\u2019s conduct throughout its dealings with Dathena suggests it was operating under financial pressures.', '46\\u2003Dathena took the view that JustCo\u2019s reply in [43] was wholly unfounded. In his AEIC, Muffat referred to his and Aida\u2019s telephone conversation with Sian-Tzu on 10 April 2020. He felt that Song\u2019s response in [43] demonstrated that JustCo had never really listened to Dathena\u2019s concerns and was attempting to force Dathena to choose one of two equally unviable options. 53', '47\\u2003On 1 September 2020, Sheena suddenly sent an email to Dathena stating Dathena had not responded to JustCo\u2019s letter of 27 July 2020 at [43] and that the Membership Agreement and Allocated Office Space for the OCBC Premises would be available from 9 September 2020 to 30 April 2022. 54', '48\\u2003As Dathena considered the Lease to have been terminated\/frustrated by the Notice of Termination in [29], Aida immediately replied to Sheena\u2019s email as follows: 55', '49\\u2003Even so, Aida (on Muffat\u2019s instructions) visited the OCBC Premises on 4 September 2020 as a matter of courtesy to ascertain if JustCo was lying again. Aida went alone as Muffat was busy. In her AEIC, Aida deposed that she felt \u201cambushed\u201d as JustCo at the site inspection kept insisting that it assumed Dathena would continue with the Membership Agreement as the OCBC Premises were ready for occupation on 9 September 2020. According to Aida, JustCo wanted to strike a deal even though Muffat was not present and she was told that JustCo would keep the Deposit which would be set-off against the rent if Dathena moved in. Aida responded that she had no authority to make any decision as she was not part of the management of Dathena. 56', '50\\u2003Aida took issue with JustCo\u2019s Defence and Counterclaim 57', 'that alleged that she \u201chad conveyed to [JustCo\u2019s] representatives during the site inspection. amongst others, that [Dathena] intended to significantly reduce its staff size, and that [Dathena] is open to explore options to resolve the issues relating to the Membership Agreement amicably\u201d. Aida contended that the allegation was misleading. She had only said that Dathena was downsizing an overseas office. She pointed out JustCo would have been aware of this fact as Dathena did not renew its Bangkok lease with JustCo. She asserted that Dathena did not intend to downsize its Singapore office and she never told JustCo it would do so. 58', '51\\u2003Aida briefed Muffat on the outcome of the site inspection. 59', 'Muffat felt that the parties were at an impasse. Accordingly, he instructed Dathena\u2019s solicitors to and they did, commence this suit on that day itself (ie, 4 September 2020). 60', '52\\u2003In the SOC, Dathena relied, inter alia, on cl 2 in the Membership Agreement which states:', 'Dathena further referred to provisions in the Membership Agreement relating to payment of the Membership Fees and refundable Security Deposit, as mentioned at [7].', '53\\u2003Dathena then averred that JustCo had breached the Membership Agreement by referring to the timelines that JustCo provided at [17], [22] and [24] but which it breached. Dathena contended that it did not accept and\/or acquiesce to the delays proposed in JustCo\u2019s emails of 22 April 2020 at [23] and 18 May 2020 at [25]. Dathena added that as a result of JustCo\u2019s breaches, Dathena was unable to use the OCBC Premises from the commencement date of 1 May 2020. This amounted to a repudiatory breach of the Membership Agreement and a breach of a fundamental term and\/or a breach depriving Dathena of the whole or substantial benefit of the Membership Agreement and\/or it evinced JustCo\u2019s intention to no longer be bound by the Membership Agreement. 61', '54\\u2003Dathena said it was therefore entitled to and did, terminate the Membership Agreement on 29 May 2020 by the Notice of Termination. As a result, Dathena had suffered loss and damage by the claim amount (as set out at [29]). 62', '55\\u2003In the reliefs set out in the SOC, Dathena claimed a declaration that the Membership Agreement was terminated with effect from 29 May 2020 and prayed for a refund of the Deposit.', '56\\u2003JustCo not only put up a blanket denial of Dathena\u2019s allegations in the SOC but also countered with a substantial counterclaim.', '57\\u2003In the Defence, JustCo relied heavily on provisions in the Membership Agreement to assert that Dathena did not have a claim of any nature against JustCo. In particular, JustCo relied on: 63', '(a)\\u2003Clause 2(c), to say this gave JustCo the right to replace the Allocated Office Space (as defined in the Membership Agreement) with any other premises of comparable size in the event where it may be necessary due to JustCo\u2019s operational requirements;', '(b)\\u2003Clause 8(c)(i) to assert that Dathena is liable to JustCo for the Membership Fee for the remainder of the membership term;', '(c)\\u2003Clause 12(b)(i) to say that Dathena has no claim whatsoever against JustCo;', '(d)\\u2003Clause 11 to say that Dathena has to indemnify JustCo against all claims, demands, actions etc; and', '(e)\\u2003the absence of a termination provision in the Membership Agreement to assert that the Notice of Termination is invalid.', '58\\u2003Relying on the CB Measures (as well as their extension to 1 June 2020) and the emails set out earlier at [21] and [25], JustCo asserted that it did its best to offer alternative arrangements in the continued performance of the Membership Agreement. JustCo further referred to its email of 13 April 2020 in [21] above to contend that it was prepared to \u201crenegotiate the commercial terms\u201d of the Membership Agreement. JustCo also referred to its email of 16 April 2020 where it offered Dathena alternative temporary space from 6 to 31 May 2020 given that no construction works were allowed at OCBC Premises during the period the CB Measures were in force. 64', 'JustCo added that it was prepared to push back the commencement date of the Lease to 1 June 2020.', '59\\u2003JustCo added that it had offered Dathena alternative space for immediate occupation at the Bras Basah Premises which Dathena did not accept.', '', '60\\u2003JustCo also asserted it had offered Dathena two options namely either:', '(a)\\u2003occupy the Bras Basah Premises; or', '(b)\\u2003occupy the OCBC Premises at a later date of 9 September 2020.', '61\\u2003However, Dathena rejected both options on 7 July 2020. JustCo had informed Dathena that its rejection of both options did not amount to a termination of the Membership Agreement.

Dathena requested to visit the said premises. The site inspection took place on 4 September 2020 during which Dathena\u2019s representative Aida conveyed to the JustCo\u2019s representatives that (a) Dathena intended to significantly reduce its staff size and (b) Dathena wanted to resolve amicably the issues relating to the Membership Agreement. However, in bad faith, Dathena commenced this suit on the same day.', '64\\u2003JustCo sought a declaration that Dathena had repudiated the Membership Agreement and that it was entitled to terminate the same.

Dathena averred that the parties had a pre-existing relationship since 2019 as Dathena had used JustCo\u2019s office space Bangkok between February 2019 and January 2020. In December 2019, Dathena had also taken office space from an entity related to JustCo at Ocean Financial Centre #16-01 (presumably the Verizon Premises). Dathena pleaded that after the Notice of Termination was issued, Dathena continued to engage JustCo in good faith and without prejudice to Dathena\u2019s termination of the Membership Agreement, as the OCBC Premises were not ready for Dathena\u2019s use by the commencement date. Dathena referred to the first timeline in [17] that Dathena failed to meet in regard to the IT works.', '66\\u2003Dathena averred that the Membership Agreement was based on JustCo\u2019s standard written terms of business. It contended that cl 2(c) is unenforceable by reason of ss 3 and 11 of the Unfair Contracts Terms Act (Cap 396, 1994 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe UCTA\u201d). In the alternative, cl 2(c) ought to be read contra proferentum against JustCo.', '67\\u2003As for JustCo\u2019s Counterclaim, Dathena alleged that JustCo was obliged to take all reasonable steps but failed, to mitigate its losses and is not entitled to recover the Membership Fees in full or in part. 65', '68\\u2003JustCo filed a Rejoinder where it joined issue with JustCo\u2019s Defence and Counterclaim. JustCo averred that the server room was set up prior to 6 April 2020 (including installation of an internet router by M1 Dathena\u2019s ISP). IT testing and commissioning, clearing and preparation works were disrupted by the CB Measures as the period during within which they were to take place fell with the CB Measures period. JustCo added that it went above and beyond what was required in the Membership Agreement to render assistance and suggest alternatives for housing Dathena\u2019s servers. 66', 'JustCo further alleged that by its conduct, Dathena showed unequivocally that the Membership Agreement could still be performed and that it was still willing to perform the same after 1 May 2020. 67', '69\\u2003In response to JustCo\u2019s Rejoinder, Dathena filed a Surrejoinder in which it asserted that the server room was still not ready by 6 April 2020.

Neither was the requirement included in the Appendix to the Membership Agreement. 69', 'However, Aida\u2019s email to Sharlene of 25 March 2020 stated (albeit for the first time) that Dathena required to move in and set up its equipment (servers) in the OCBC Premises between 27\u201330 April 2020. 70', 'Counsel for JustCo, Mr Leong, pointed out to Aida that JustCo did not promise to meet this timeline. 71', 'Even so, a day earlier on 24 March 2020, 72', 'Aida had been given timelines by Sharlene in graph format which included setting-up the server room between 30 March\u20136 April 2020. 73', 'It should be noted that on 9 January 2020, 74', 'Dathena had apprised JustCo of its IT requirements but did not indicate a deadline.', '73\\u2003In his cross-examination of Aida, 75', 'Mr Leong sought to make a distinction. He said there was a difference between housing the staff of Dathena at the OCBC Premises which was, and housing Datherna\u2019s servers which was not, JustCo\u2019s contractual obligation. Aida disagreed stating it was for both purposes. She further disagreed with Mr Leong\u2019s suggestion that after the CB Measures were implemented, Dathena\u2019s priority shifted from wanting office space to wanting server space. 76', '74\\u2003Because of JustCo\u2019s delays and\/or failure to give any updated timelines with regard to the OCBC Premises to Dathena, Aida testified Dathena moved its servers to a third party data centre provider, Voiden Internet Solutions Pte Ltd (\u201cVodien\u201d) located in Changi because Dathena\u2019s space at the Verizon Premises could not house its servers. 77', '75\\u2003Mr Leong further suggested to Aida (who disagreed) that it was Dathena\u2019s responsibility not JustCo\u2019s, to arrange with M1 to set up the internet service line at the OCBC Premises. She testified that JustCo should but did not apply for M1 as an \u201cessential service\u201d to be allowed to do the installation. 78', 'She further disagreed that it was Dathena\u2019s not JustCo\u2019s responsibility to apply to the relevant authorities for exemption so that M1 could set up the internet connection. She pointed out that JustCo was the tenant not Dathena, of the OCBC Premises. 79', '76\\u2003Mr Leong had also put it to Aida (who disagreed) that the Verizon Premises were a real option and alternative for Dathena to move to, when the OCBC Premises were not ready by 1 May 2020. 80', 'He drew her attention to the fact that JustCo even introduced Dathena to a third party (\u201cKDDI\u201d) on 5 May 2020 who could provide Dathena with server racks and a data centre to house its servers temporarily until the OCBC Premises were ready for occupation. 81', 'On 18 May 2020, in accordance with Dathena\u2019s request, JustCo cancelled the rental for the server racks. 82', '77\\u2003As for the Bras Basah Premises, JustCo\u2019s case was that Dathena used the excuse that it lacked storage space to reject it as a real option. Not surprisingly, Aida disagreed pointing out that those premises were too small to house all staff of Dathena as well as the fact that although it is not in as prime a location as the OCBC Premises, it was more expensive on a per square foot basis. 83', '78\\u2003Aida testified that JustCo\u2019s offer to Dathena to lease the OCBC Premises for two years starting in September 2020 with two months\u2019 rent waiver was not a viable option because Dathena had already issued the Notice of Termination and JustCo kept pushing back the commencement date. Aida also disagreed with Mr Leong\u2019s suggestion that Dathena backed out of the Membership Agreement for the OCBC Premises because it no longer made financial sense to Dathena as its expansion plans were put on hold due to the pandemic. 84', '79\\u2003Jeremie was, at all material times, Dathena\u2019s head of its IT team. His role, as his designation suggests, was to take charge of the internet and computers set-up for Dathena at the OCBC Premises. 85', 'In his AEIC, 86', 'Jeremie explained the importance of Dathena\u2019s IT requirements at the OCBC Premises.', '80\\u2003For security reasons and in their interests, Jeremie deposed that Dathena stored their clients\u2019 data in Dathena\u2019s servers rather than on the cloud. In addition, Dathena\u2019s operations in Singapore and overseas rely on Dathena\u2019s servers in Singapore. Jeremie therefore had to ensure that Dathena\u2019s servers ran smoothly and without interruption for both its clients and employees (both local and overseas). If there was any outage on the data centres hosting the servers and\/or downtime on the servers, there would be severe disruption to Dathena\u2019s operations globally as their clients would face downtime and Dathena as well as its overseas offices, may be unable to work. It was therefore undesirable for Dathena to relocate its servers often, as frequent moves would lead to service disruption and heighten business continuity risks.', '81\\u2003Jeremie was aware that Aida handled negotiations with JustCo on the lease for the OCBC Premises and would have conveyed to the latter the IT requirements of Dathena. If the OCBC Premises could not accommodate Dathena\u2019s IT requirement, he doubted that Dathena would have considered leasing the same. Jeremie deposed that Dathena required a dedicated server room with certain hardware specifications. 87', 'He referred to and relied on Aida\u2019s email to Sian-Tzu dated 9 January 2020 88', '(sent after consulting him) where Dathena\u2019s IT requirements were clearly spelt out.', '82\\u2003On or about 23 January 2020 (as mentioned at [16]), Jeremie, along with Aida, Sai Tun and Lylian Kieffer, met up with JustCo\u2019s representatives. 89', 'On Dathena\u2019s side there were concerns regarding the date when the server room at the OCBC Premises could be set up as well as when Dathena could have early access to those premises. Jeremie deposed it was crucial for Dathena to move its servers into the OCBC Premises before it moved its staff out of OGS, to ensure business continuity and minimise disruptions to Dathena\u2019s operations. He recalled he had emphasised the importance of the server set-up to JustCo\u2019s representatives many times in their interactions after 23 January 2020. In particular, Jeremie stated he had highlighted Dathena\u2019s need for power, air-conditioning and networks to be installed early. Dathena also requested early access to the server room so that its ISP could complete connecting its internet line and Dathena could ensure smooth installation of its equipment and servers.', '83\\u2003In response to JustCo\u2019s email (from Sharlene) dated 30 January 2020 requesting IT requirements and port-mapping, 90', 'Jeremie replied on 5 February 2020 setting out in detail Dathena\u2019s requirements for (a) network; (b) physical set-up and (c) office arrangement as well as providing a network diagram by way of illustration. 91', 'Sian-Tzu replied to Jeremie\u2019s queries on 7 February 2020. 92', 'In answer to his following question:', 'Sian-Tzu replied:', '84\\u2003After further toing and froing, Sharlene requested Jeremie to confirm on 12 February 2020 the additional chargeable works for additional quotes for JustCo\u2019s assistance with IT-related installation set-up. 93', 'Aida responded on 19 February 2020 to confirm Dathena\u2019s requirements and the charges payable. 94', '85\\u2003Between end-February and end-March 2020, Jeremie and\/or Sai Tun corresponded with Sian-Tzu, Sharlene and Raymond Ow (\u201cOw\u201d) as well as KDDI\u2019s David Hen on Dathena\u2019s IT requirements and logistical set-up. 95', '86\\u2003Jeremie referred to Sharlene\u2019s email of 24 March 2020 (as mentioned at [17]) which showed that the original timeline of 10\u201320 March 2020 for IT works was shifted to 23 March\u201324 April 2020.', '87\\u2003Due to the CB Measures which required employees to telecommute from home, Jeremie deposed in his AEIC that Dathena required a static Internet Protocol (\u201cIP\u201d), not the dynamic IP that JustCo had. 96', 'This was to ensure that Dathena\u2019s employees working from home or overseas could remotely access Dathena\u2019s internet domain.', '88\\u2003Jeremie linked Ow up with M1 in mid-March 2020 so that JustCo could grant M1 inspection of and access to the OCBC Premises to prepare for internet connection. 97', 'On 13 March 2020, M1 emailed Dathena and provided the following timelines: 98', '(a)\\u2003Site survey: 17\u201319 March 2020;', '(b)\\u2003Fibre cabling: 19\u201323 March 2020;', '(c)\\u2003Fibre router installation: 23\u201327 March 2020.', '89\\u2003For all three installations, M1 needed to liaise with the \u201cbuilding management\u201d of OCBC CE.

Jeremie\u2019s response was to point out that JustCo should have made some efforts to arrange for Dathena to move forward. 114', '99\\u2003Ms Chai further suggested to Jeremie that Ow\u2019s email of 8 April 2020 set out earlier at [90] was to safeguard JustCo\u2019s interest. Ms Chai\u2019s cross-examination of Jeremie placed the burden on Dathena to request JustCo to apply for exemption from the Ministry of Manpower (\u201cMOM\u201d) to grant access to the OCBC Premises for M1\u2019s technicians to activate the internet connection. 115', 'The court rejects JustCo\u2019s position for the reason set out at [115] below.', '100\\u2003Muffat was Dathena\u2019s third and last witness. His evidence-in-chief very much echoed Aida\u2019s testimony which has been dealt with above at [5] to [51]. Hence, the court turns to Muffat\u2019s testimony during cross-examination.', '101\\u2003JustCo\u2019s case put to Muffat in cross-examination was identical to that put to Aida \u2013 that Dathena never informed JustCo prior to the execution of the Membership Agreement that its server room had to be put up by a certain date. 116', '102\\u2003It was also suggested to Muffat that as a cybersecurity company, its staff need not be physically present at the location of its servers or where a cybersecurity issue arises; Muffat disagreed. 117', 'He explained that Dathena has two activities: (a) it develops software or artificial intelligence which can be done remotely but with high collaboration; 118', '(b) servicing its clients which requires Dathena to have confidential information from its clients\u2019 data centre. 119', 'For activity (b), working remotely may be complicated from time to time for security reasons. 120', 'It was Dathena\u2019s preference to have its staff physically near its servers in case there is an outage. 121', 'He added that while he had not experienced an outage during his years in Singapore, Dathena had experienced outage internally due to hardware deficiency and it require quick intervention on Dathena\u2019s part. 122', '103\\u2003Mr Leong went further to suggest to Muffat that because Dathena was cash-strapped, it did not accept any of the alternative proposals put forth by JustCo. Not surprisingly, Muffat disagreed. He said he gave Aida a budget to set up the new office at the OCBC Premises and compared with the Bras Basah Premises, the former was cheaper on a per seat basis. 123', '104\\u2003Mr Muffat\u2019s attention was drawn to the fact that the Membership Agreement had no termination clause. 124', '105\\u2003Notwithstanding the Notice of Termination, it has been noted earlier at [37] that JustCo had emailed Dathena on 18 June 2020 offering the Bras Basah Premises at a reduced monthly rate of $38,000 instead of the original asking price of $48,000. 125', '106\\u2003As stated earlier at [70], Sian-Tzu and Sheena were JustcCo\u2019s witnesses. Both their AEICs were not particularly helpful as they were purely narrative in content with no personal input. Sian-Tzu, JustCo\u2019s first witness, reports to Sheena who is her manager. For expediency, the court will review her testimony in cross-examination as her chronology of events did not differ from Dathena\u2019s version.', '107\\u2003In her AEIC and oral testimony, 126', 'Sian-Tzu confirmed that JustCo\u2019s lease at the Verizon\u2019s Premises was a temporary measure to house 22 employees until a larger permanent office could be found. In cross-examination, Sian-Tzu said she also knew by 9 January 2020 that Dathena needed to house its servers in a server room and its other equipment in a storeroom. 127', 'In fact, JustCo had invoiced Dathena on 19 March 2020 $5,000 for the server room\u2019s server rack. 128', 'This was followed by Sharlene\u2019s email 24 March 2020 giving timelines of 30 March\u20136 April 2020 and 1\u201324 April 2020 respectively, for the setting up of the server room and Dathena\u2019s equipment and installation respectively. 129', '108\\u2003Sian-Tzu was also aware from her and Sharlene\u2019s conference call with Muffat and Aida on 10 April 2020 that Dathena may have to vacate OGS by 5 May 2020. 130', 'In her AEIC, 131', 'Sian-Tzu deposed that both Muffat and Aida in that call had requested for JustCo to waive the Membership Fee for a few months or reduce the same temporarily because Dathena\u2019s business had been affected by Covid-19. She was told Dathena intended to reduce its headcount to about 65\u201370 from the original figure of 120. She added that JustCo could not accede to Dathena\u2019s request and informed Dathena accordingly in her email dated 13 April 2020. 132', 'As pointed out earlier at [20], Aida disputed Sian-Tzu\u2019s version of the conversation in that conference call.', '109\\u2003Sian-Tzu confirmed that by 13 April 2020, JustCo had billed Dathena $18,350 for \u201cTelecommunications & IT\u201d as well as \u201cWorkspace Services\u201d. 133', 'The provision of these services would come under the ambit of \u201cAdditional Services\u201d in cl 2(a)(iii) of the Membership Agreement alluded to earlier at [7(c)] above.', '110\\u2003On the issue of giving Dathena early access to the server room after 6 April 2020, Sian-Tzu was not sure it was a contractual obligation; she said JustCo was just giving Dathena a helping hand. 134', '111\\u2003It was during her cross-examination that Sian-Tzu acknowledged that besides its limited capacity (for only 64 persons) to accommodate all the staff of Dathena, the Verizon Premises were also not exclusive to Dathena, unlike the OCBC Premises. 135', 'This can be seen when the floorplan of the OCBC Premises is compared with that of the Verizon Premises. 136', 'Further, the Verizon Premises did not have server or storage space. Sian-Tzu conceded that the Verizon Premises was only a temporary solution that was offered to Dathena. 137', 'In answer to the court\u2019s questions, 138', 'Sian-Tzu agreed that the OCBC Premises had more exclusivity than the Bras Basah Premises. Notwithstanding those negative factors, not only was JustCo very insistent in Dathena\u2019s moving to the Verizon Premises but it further expected Dathena to bear the costs of moving there and from there, move again to the OCBC Premises when the latter premises were ready as mentioned at [93].', '112\\u2003Cross-examined, Sian-Tzu disagreed that it was \u201cunfair\u201d to expect Dathena to bear two sets of moving costs, one from OGS to the Verizon Premises and the second set from the latter to the OCBC Premises in order to accommodate JustCo. She said that \u201ceveryone was just trying to manage the situation\u201d. 139', 'The court reminded her that, in relation to the parties\u2019 respective obligations under the Membership Agreement, Dathena was not the party at fault as it was JustCo that was late and failed to meet the timelines \u2013 why then should Dathena bear the additional moving charges? Sian-Tzu\u2019s explanation was that the delay was not caused by JustCo per se \u2013 it could not continue with construction due to the pandemic. As will be elaborated below, her excuse is not tenable in the light of the court\u2019s findings below at [113]\u2013[116].', '113\\u2003Sian-Tzu\u2019s attention was drawn by counsel for Dathena, Mr Tay, to JustCo\u2019s revised timelines showing it had re-scheduled the setting-up of Dathena\u2019s server room to 14\u201318 May 2020 when the earlier timeline was 30 March\u20136 April 2020. 140', 'Mr Tay pointed out 6 April 2020 was the eve of the implementation of CB Measures. Had JustCo adhered to its own earlier timeline, Dathena\u2019s servers could have been installed and internet connectivity activated before 7 April 2020 if there had been power supply. Sian-Tzu opined that the May 2020 timelines were an error. 141', 'However, as the revised schedule was prepared by Sharlene who did not testify, her answer did not advance JustCo\u2019s case.', '114\\u2003Sian-Tzu disclosed that she relied on information from JustCo\u2019s own IT team to say that the building control authorities would not have allowed access to the OCBC Premises during the CB Measures period. She did not conduct her own independent checks to verify whether IT works constituted essential services that were exempted from CB Measures restrictions. 142', 'She was not even aware of Time Limited Exemptions from CB Measures until Aida brought it up and she then checked with her IT team. Again, Sian-Tzu took her team\u2019s word that Time Limited Exemption was strictly disallowed without verifying the information independently. In fact, JustCo\u2019s IT team made no attempts to apply for such exemption. 143', 'In the light of JustCo\u2019s inaction, Sian-Tzu\u2019s answer during cross-examination that \u201cwe are always looking to help\u201d rings hollow. 144', '115\\u2003Further, Sian-Tzu deposed that: 145', 'This ignored the realities of the situation and the legal niceties \u2013 that JustCo as the tenant (and not Dathena) had the locus standi to gain access to OCBC Premises if it had made efforts to obtain a Time Limited Exemption for M1 from MOM to activate the internet connectivity.', '116\\u2003Sian-Tzu had also informed Aida that: 146', 'This clearly showed that JustCo was unaware of Time Limited Exemptions to Covid-19 restrictions on work activities and JustCo\u2019s misapprehension of what was lacking in relation to Dathena\u2019s internet connectivity. All that was required was for the internet line to be activated, not installed. This was made even clearer when the court questioned Sian-Tzu. 147', '117\\u2003Despite repeatedly being asked in cross-examination, Sian-Tzu would not agree that JustCo\u2019s attempts on 18 June 2020 to have Dathena sign a new agreement pertaining to either taking up (a) the OCBC Premises or (b) the Bras Basah Premises amounted to a new agreement. 148', 'She maintained it was an amendment to the Membership Agreement. 149', 'To make matters worse for Dathena, should it opt for the Bras Basah Premises, Sian-Tzu\u2019s email of 18 June 2020 150', 'stated that it had to pay JustCo $13,050 for reinstatement and other costs JustCo had apparently incurred at OCBC Premises even though such costs were attributable to JustCo\u2019s actions.', '118\\u2003During her re-examination Sian-Tzu sought to suggest that the delay in delivering to Dathena the OCBC Premises was a blessing as Dathena could not in any event have used the space during the CB Measures period thereby saving rent. Further, even after the CB Measures ended on 1 June 2020, only half of Dathena\u2019s workforce would have been allowed to resume working at its office. Hence, a smaller office like the Verizon Premises would have suited Dathena better and result in costs savings in rent. 151', 'Such self-justification does not detract from the fact that the four months\u2019 delay in commencement of Dathena\u2019s lease was simply not what parties had agreed to under the terms of the Membership Agreement.', '119\\u2003The same observation would apply to Sian-Tzu\u2019s testimony that the fact that JustCo offered Dathena the OCBC Premises at reduced rental rates meant that it was \u201cnot relevant to bring anything about comparable space\u201d, 152', 'and that it was also not relevant to talk of a substitute space for Dathena in the light of its reduced workforce at its office. 153', '120\\u2003It would be appropriate at this stage to point out that JustCo\u2019s allegation that Aida had, at the Bras Basah Premises site meeting on 1 July 2020, said Dathena did not want the OCBC Premises because they downsized their operations and needed less office space requirements is contradicted by Dathena\u2019s act in taking bigger premises at No 43 Blair Road and No 11 Niven Road. Yet, when she was confronted with this fact, Sin-Tzu disagreed that she must have misheard what Aida said. 154', '121\\u2003Sian-Tzu disclosed that by the time of the trial, JustCo had found a replacement tenant for the OCBC Premises for six months; the lease signed in December 2020 commenced on 1 February 2021. 155', 'Despite that fact, JustCo did not amend its Counterclaim filed on 28 September 2020, to reduce its claim for $2,399,796 which was the Membership Fee for the entire Lease period from 1 May 2020 to 30 April 2022 (ie, 24 months). 156', 'Although the rent JustCo received is about 6% lower than Dathena\u2019s under the new contract, 157', 'JustCo sought to claim the full value of the Membership Fee, which \u2013 on JustCo\u2019s own evidence \u2013 could not have been an accurate estimation of its damages caused by the plaintiff\u2019s alleged breach.', '122\\u2003Sian-Tzu repeatedly mentioned that the Covid-19 pandemic rendered it impossible for JustCo to fulfil its contractual obligations to Dathena (which is addressed at [194]). That is the test for frustration under s 2(2) of the Frustrated Contract Act (Cap 115, 2014 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe FCA\u201d) and it contradicts the stand taken in JustCo\u2019s Response mentioned at [30] as well as by Sheena, that there was no frustration of the Membership Agreement.', '123\\u2003Although cl 2(c) of the Membership Agreement gave JustCo the right to provide alternative premises to Dathena to replace the OCBC Premises, Sian-Tzu admitted that JustCo did not invoke that clause when she offered Dathena the alternatives of the Bras Basah and Verizon Premises. It had already been noted earlier (at [32] and [35]) that neither premises could be considered comparable in terms of size, which Sian-Tzu admitted was JustCo\u2019s obligation to provide under that clause. 158', '124\\u2003I move now to look at Sheena\u2019s testimony. She deposed that she was not involved in direct communication with Dathena until she participated in the conference call with Muffat and Aida on 26 May 2020 although she was in the email loop for communication between both parties. 159', 'Neither was Sheena present when Aida made a site visit to the Bras Basah Premises on 1 July 2020 despite which, Sheena deposed to what transpired thereat. 160', '125\\u2003In her email to Muffat on 7 July 2020, 161', 'Sheena stated that the OCBC Premises \u201cwill now be ready on 9 September 2020\u201d. This was more than four months after the agreed commencement date of 1 May 2020 for Dathena\u2019s lease. The court had pointed out to Sian-Tzu that four months equated to \u00b9\/6 of the 24 months\u2019 term under the Membership Agreement. 162', 'Further, despite the 4 months\u2019 delay in commencement of the lease, Dathena\u2019s lease would still terminate on 30 April 2022 which meant that the lease could have only been for 20 months in any event, not 24 as JustCo counterclaimed.', '126\\u2003Sheena\u2019s involvement in the dispute after the Notice of Termination on 29 May 2020 is also largely irrelevant. Her version of the teleconference on 16 July 2020 between herself and Sian-Tzu with Muffat and Aida did not differ very much from Dathena\u2019s version. 163', '127\\u2003However, for Sheena to depose 164', 'that Muffat\u2019s email of 7 July 2020 did not state that the Membership Agreement was terminated is to conveniently overlook the Notice of Termination as well as Muffat\u2019s email to Song on 1 June 2020 which stated: 165', '128\\u2003Despite the above message and Dathena\u2019s Letter of Demand, 166', 'Sheena opined in her AEIC that she believed Dathena had accepted that the Membership Agreement remained operational because it did not respond to JustCo\u2019s letter dated 27 July 2020 signed by Song. 167', '129\\u2003In this regard, it is to be noted that Dathena\u2019s Letter of Demand clearly stated that \u201cDathena reiterates its position that the Agreement has been terminated and the Refund is due and owing\u2026\u201d [emphasis in original].', '130\\u2003The material portions of JustCo\u2019s response letter dated 27 July 2020 have already been set out earlier at [43] save for paras 2 and 5 which state: 168', 'It is noteworthy that apart from the above brief reference to s 16 of the Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) (Amendment) Act 2020 (the \u201cCovid-19 (Amendment) Act\u201d), no evidence was presented by JustCo that it invoked that provision either with Dathena and\/or more pertinently, with the landlord of OCBC CE to obtain waiver and\/or reductions in rent.', '131\\u2003Sheena\u2019s assumption that the Membership Agreement continued is not credible as counsel for Dathena put to her, in the light of the very clear language used in Dathena\u2019s Letter of Demand to which JustCo\u2019s letter dated 27 July 2020 was a reply. 169', 'The court said as much to Sheena and likened JustCo\u2019s attitude to that of an ostrich putting its head into the sand, not wanting to know what was going on in the world outside. 170', '132\\u2003In respect of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, the issues the court needs to decide in this case are:', '(a)\\u2003Was Dathena entitled to and\/or justified in giving the Notice of Termination?', '(b)\\u2003If the Notice of Termination was valid, did Dathena waive its rights of termination by viewing\/considering the Verizon and Bras Basah Premises as alternatives to the OCBC Premises?

Dathena\u2019s position was that the start date of 1 May 2020 was a condition of the contract with time being of the essence.', '137\\u2003Dathena submitted that it was undisputed that as at 26 May 2020, the situation was that the delays were indefinite (as mentioned at [27]). It was only well after the Notice of Termination had been issued (ie, 29 May 2020) that by Sian-Tzu\u2019s email of 6 July 2020, 171', 'JustCo gave a definite date of 9 September 2020 for Dathena to move into the OCBC Premises.', '138\\u2003Dathena added that JustCo\u2019s fundamental breach extended to its inability to provide the server room, the benefit of which Dathena was substantially deprived. 172', '139\\u2003As an alternative, Dathena\u2019s position was that the Additional Services to be provided by JustCo as part of the Membership Agreement included the supply of a server room which was confirmed by JustCo\u2019s issuance of a quotation dated 19 March 2020 (mentioned at [17]). 173', '140\\u2003Consequently, Dathena argued that JustCo was in repudiatory breach of the Membership Agreement for its inability to deliver the OCBC Premises for more than four months (1 May to 9 September 2020). Dathena submitted that the repudiatory breach occurred from 8 April 2020 onwards when JustCo first informed Dathena that it could not deliver the OCBC Premises on time (as mentioned at [19]). 174', '141\\u2003Dathena also submitted that JustCo bore the responsibility for M1\u2019s inability to complete the internet installation. 175', 'It added that JustCo\u2019s proposed alternative third party data centre at KDDI to store Dathena\u2019s servers was not a viable alternative not to mention that JustCo expected Dathena to pay for the same. 176', '142\\u2003Dathena further submitted that it neither waived JustCo\u2019s delays nor varied the Membership Agreement 177', '\u2013 neither its conduct nor communication prior to this suit indicated that the Lease was continuing. Its Notice of Termination was irrevocable at law.', '143\\u2003Dathena added that JustCo did not offer comparable alternative premises by way of the Verizon and Bras Basah Premises. Even if the alternative premises were of comparable sizes in terms of square footage, other factors other than square footage must be considered such as (a) the location of the premises; (b) the exclusivity of the space to Dathena\u2019s use without the need to share the space with another entity; and (c) the provision of a server room and other amenities. In any case, the alternative premises were \u201cnot even comparable in terms of size\u201d to the OCBC Premises. 178', '144\\u2003As against JustCo\u2019s Counterclaim, Dathena submitted that JustCo failed to take all reasonable steps to mitigate its loss, 179', 'assuming Dathena was in breach.

Dathena also submitted that the quantum that JustCo sought in its Counterclaim was \u201cpreposterous\u201d as it was an overestimation of the alleged damages suffered as a result of Dathena\u2019s alleged breach. 180', '145\\u2003The court will later address Dathena\u2019s submissions that cl 2(c) of the Membership Agreement is unenforceable under ss 3 and 11 of the UCTA and that JustCo cannot rely on cl 2(c) of the Membership Agreement in relation to the Verizon Premises.', '146\\u2003In the alternative, Dathena submitted that the Membership Agreement was frustrated, relying on s 2(2) of the FCA (which will be elaborated at [183]).', '147\\u2003Not surprisingly, JustCo\u2019s submissions contended that Dathena is not entitled to a refund of the Deposit as the Membership Agreement was not frustrated and there was no basis for the Notice of Termination. 181', '148\\u2003JustCo accused Dathena of leading it by the nose for over three months during which time it signed lease agreements for office space at No 43 Niven Road and No 11 Blair Road with third party landlords without notifying JustCo.

Even after Dathena\u2019s Letter of Demand, Dathena\u2019s representatives continued to provide JustCo with inconsistent messages. 182', '149\\u2003JustCo denied it had breached the Membership Agreement by not providing a server room. 183', 'It asserted that it had no contractual obligation to allow Dathena to move its servers into the OCBC Premises by 6 April 2020. There was nothing in the Appendix to the Membership Agreement which imposed this obligation on JustCo. Neither did the parties agree, subsequent to the signing of the Membership Agreement, as to when Dathena should be able to move its servers into the OCBC Premises. Further, the dates in the construction timelines provided by JustCo to Dathena were always subject to change.', '150\\u2003Additionally, at no point before the imposition of the CB Measures did Dathena inform JustCo that it was imperative that the former be allowed to move in its servers by 6 April 2020. 184', 'On the contrary, Aida\u2019s emails to Sharlene of 19 February 2020 185', 'and 25 March 2020 186', 'talked of moving Dathena\u2019s equipment (servers) into the OCBC Premises by late April 2020.

Temporary power had been installed in the server room by the start of April 2020 but JustCo would not allow its clients to move their servers into the OCBC Premises without permanent electricity supply being installed because (according to Sian-Tzu) \u201cif the temporary power supply were to be disrupted, then it would be very detrimental to the information kept within the server\u201d. 188', '152\\u2003In any case, Dathena could not have moved its servers into the OCBC Premises by 6 April 2020 because Dathena\u2019s ISP failed to activate the fibre router before 7 April 2020 when the CB Measures were imposed. 189', '153\\u2003JustCo alleged that Dathena had informed JustCo in early April 2020 that it had stopped its expansion plans and it wanted \u201crental reliefs\u201d to lower its expenditure on office space. Prior to the purported Notice of Termination, JustCo understood from its communications with Dathena that the latter\u2019s main concern was with costs. Hence, the purported Notice of Termination came as a surprise to JustCo \u2013 Dathena\u2019s concerns over the temporary arrangements offered by JustCo (at the Verizon and Bras Basah Premises) had never been communicated to JustCo. 190', '154\\u2003JustCo submitted that the Membership Agreement continued to subsist post the commencement date, because of cl 2(c) of the Membership Agreement. 191', 'In any case, JustCo argued that Dathena had waived its right in respect of the commencement date \u2013 it did not terminate the Membership Agreement based on JustCo\u2019s failure to meet the commencement date and in that regard, accepted that the commencement date had to be postponed. 192', 'As indicated earlier at [145], the court will return to cl 2(c) later when it makes its findings.', '155\\u2003In regard to Dathena\u2019s reliance on ss 3 and 11 of the UCTA, JustCo submitted those provisions do not render cl 2(c) of the Membership Agreement unenforceable. 193', 'JustCo also submitted that the Membership Agreement was not frustrated by the implementation of the CB Measures. 194', '156\\u2003As for its Counterclaim, JustCo maintained it was entitled to claim the Membership Fees for the full term of the Lease. 195', 'It however conceded it should deduct the Membership Fees received from the replacement tenant of the OCBC Premises amounting to $87,843 per month for a period of six months. Less what it received from the replacement tenant, JustCo reduced its Counterclaim to $1,585,846.50. In the alternative, it claimed damages to be assessed. 196', '157\\u2003It is noteworthy that although the Membership Agreement clauses favoured JustCo, there was no provision that gave JustCo the right to deliver the OCBC Premises to Dathena after 1 May 2020. Earlier at [125], the court had observed that the four months\u2019 delay (ie, 1 May to 9 September 2020) in the commencement of the Lease amounted to \u00b9\/6 or approximately 17% of the duration of the Lease. Moreover, in the telephone call between parties on 26 May 2020 mentioned at [27], JustCo could not state with any certainty when Dathen could occupy the OCBC Premises. It was this lack of clarity and the uncertainty attendant thereto that prompted Muffat to issue the Notice of Termination three days later. 197', '158\\u2003It is also to be noted that it was JustCo\u2019s own evidence that the parties had a pre-existing relationship before 2019 as Dathena had rented office space from JustCo\u2019s Bangkok office with Sian-Tzu being Dathena\u2019s main point of contact for that transaction. 198', 'Consequently, JustCo\/Sian-Tzu were cognisant of the nature of Dathena\u2019s business and its IT requirements.', '159\\u2003Mr Leong\u2019s attempts during cross-examination to extract from Aida and Muffat an admission that JustCo\u2019s contractual obligation was to provide office (and not server space) to Dathena is misconceived. 199', 'Because of their previous business relationship, JustCo well knew that Dathena as a cybersecurity company cannot operate without servers and internet connectivity, be it in an office or a home setting. Moreover, as Dathena pointed out in its Reply Submissions, 200', 'JustCo had issued a quotation and invoice to Dathena for the server room (which was mentioned at [17]) and, it was thus contractually obligated to deliver such Additional Services under the Membership Agreement. It was not a mere moral obligation as JustCo sought to argue, relying on the case of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp Ltd v Jurong Engineering Ltd and Others [2000] 1 SLR(R) 204; 201', 'the case is not relevant.', '160\\u2003It had earlier been noted at [7] that there is no clause in the Membership Agreement that allows Dathena to terminate the contract, unlike JustCo which can do so under cl 8, which will be addressed at [171] and [179]. That cannot be right as a matter of contract law in a commercial context.', '161\\u2003Clause 16 of the Membership Agreement is an entire agreement clause. 202', 'According to the appellate court\u2019s decision in Ng Giap Hon v Westcomb Securities Pte Ltd and Anor [2009] 3 SLR(R) 518 that Dathena cited, 203', 'such a law does not preclude the implication of terms into a contract. Even if an entire agreement clause might be able to exclude the implication of terms into a contract, if in substance it is an exception clause, the clause would be subject to both the common law constraints on exclusion clauses as well as the UCTA, which legislation the court turns now to consider.', '162\\u2003The court finds that Dathena was justified in issuing the Notice of Termination for the Membership Agreement due to JustCo\u2019s failure to deliver the OCBC Premises for its occupation on 1 May 2020.', '163\\u2003As Dathena submitted in its reply submissions, 204', 'it does not lie in JustCo\u2019s mouth to accuse Dathena of seeking to get out of its contractual obligations (as it did in its closing submissions) 205', 'when it was JustCo that failed to deliver on its contractual obligations.', '164\\u2003The evidence adduced from Aida and Muffat clearly showed that neither the Verizon nor Bras Basah Premises were of \u201ccomparable size\u201d to OCBC Premises as required under cl 2(c) of the Membership Agreement. The court finds it hard to appreciate JustCo\u2019s insistence conveyed through Sian-Tzu, that Dathena should move to the Verizon Premises as a \u201ctemporary compromise\u201d in order to suit JustCo\u2019s convenience and from there move to the OCBC Premises when the same were ready. 206', 'If JustCo was in breach of the Membership Agreement, then as the defaulting party, it is in no position to dictate terms to Dathena as it repeatedly sought to do. The same comment would apply to JustCo\u2019s attempts to have Dathena take the Bras Basah Premises in lieu of the OCBC Premises.', '165\\u2003The court therefore finds that JustCo\u2019s offers to Dathena of the two alternatives to the OCBC Premises did not come within the definition of alternative \u201cAllocated Office Space of comparable size\u201d under cl 2(c) of the Membership Agreement.', '166\\u2003A repeated refrain in JustCo\u2019s submissions was that JustCo had no contractual obligation to allow Dathena to move its servers into the OCBC Premises by 6 April 2020. 207', 'The short answer to that submission is that JustCo should not then have led Dathena to believe that it could move in its servers earlier, let alone invoiced Dathena on 19 March 2020 based on that date. It bears mentioning that Sian-Tzu was aware, even before the execution of the Membership Agreement, from a meeting with Dathena on 15 January 2020, of Dathena\u2019s IT requirements and timelines. 208', '167\\u2003For JustCo\u2019s counsel to put to Muffat that it was Dathena\u2019s not JustCo\u2019s responsibility to obtain the requisite approval from MOM to enable M1 technicians to enter the OCBC Premises is again to ignore the fact that the master lessee of the OCBC Premises with the landlord was JustCo not Dathena. 209', 'Dathena would have had no locus standi vis-\u00e0-vis the landlord to make such an application which if made, would likely not have been entertained. In this regard, it is noteworthy that JustCo\u2019s invoice dated 19 March 2020 for \u201cAdditional Services\u201d included a charge of $500 for \u201cISP-JustCo Coordination fee for survey and installation\u201d (as highlighted at [17]) which invoice Dathena promptly signed the day after on 20 March 2020. JustCo did not deliver what it invoiced to Dathena. Despite the signed invoice, Ow\u2019s response in his email on 8 April 2020 on the same issue of internet connectivity (when pressed by Dathena) was wholly unhelpful (as noted at [90]).', '168\\u2003Equally, there was no duty on the part of Dathena to inform JustCo that it had successfully applied for Jeremie and Sai Tun to enter the OGS Premises under MOM\u2019s Time Limited Exemptions to Covid-19 restrictions. 210', 'With due respect, it is not relevant to Dathena\u2019s SOC or JustCo\u2019s Defence. Indeed, the court found it surprising that Sian-Tzu was not even aware of such an exemption until Aida told her (as highlighted at [114]).', '169\\u2003The court must consider the UCTA in conjunction with the terms in the Membership Agreement upon which JustCo relied in its Defence and Counterclaim (as summarised at [57]). Earlier, the court had commented at [7] how the terms and conditions of the Membership Agreement are heavily skewed in favour of JustCo and how Dathena is disadvantaged as a \u201cmember\u201d.', '170\\u2003Relevant extracts of cl 2 of the Membership Agreement were set out earlier at [52]; the clause also contained the following extracts:', '171\\u2003Next is cl 8(c)(i) which states:', '172\\u2003Then there is cl 11 which states:', '173\\u2003Finally, there is cl 12(b)(i) which states:', '174\\u2003It was Dathena\u2019s pleaded case that cl 2(c) of the Membership Agreement is unenforceable under ss 3 and 11 of the UCTA. JustCo however had argued in its closing submissions that ss 3 and 11 of the UCTA would not apply as Dathena was not dealing as a \u201cconsumer\u201d with JustCo and in any case, cl 2(c) of the Membership Agreement satisfies the test of \u201creasonableness\u201d under s 11(1) of the UCTA.', '175\\u2003 The relevant portions of ss 3 and 11 of the UCTA states:', '176\\u2003Under the Second Schedule to the UCTA, the guidelines for application of the \u201creasonableness\u201d test include:', 'Under s 12(3) of the UCTA, the burden is on JustCo to prove that Dathena is not a \u201cconsumer\u201d.', '177\\u2003The court is of the view that Dathena is indeed a \u201cconsumer\u201d', 'within the meaning of s 3 of the UCTA. Assuming arguendo that JustCo is correct and Dathena is not a \u201cconsumer\u201d, Dathena would still come under the second disjunctive limb of s 3(1) as dealing with JustCo \u201con the other\u2019s written standard terms of business\u201d.', '178\\u2003In its closing submissions, 211', 'JustCo sought to show that although the initial draft agreement was provided by JustCo, the executed Membership Agreement was a product of negotiations between the parties and JustCo would have been open to changes in the contract terms if Dathena had requested. Therefore, the terms were \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d within the ambit of s 11(1) of the UCTA. The court is sceptical of this submission. It is quite apparent that the Membership Agreement terms are JustCo\u2019s standard terms and conditions applicable to all its clients or \u201cmembers\u201d. No evidence was presented that there was room for negotiation of those standard terms. What was in evidence was that Dathena signed a similar agreement for its Bangkok office. Contrary to JustCo\u2019s submissions, 212', 'Sian-Tzu\u2019s evidence at trial, which JustCo referred the court to in its submissions, did not suggest that JustCo was open to negotiating the standard terms of the Membership Agreement. Quite to the opposite, Sian-Tzu testified that the Membership Agreement is \u201cjust a standard agreement that it was -- is generated from the system\u201d. 213', 'In that regard, Sian-Tzu confirmed multiple times at the trial that the Membership Agreement is a standard contract used by JustCo for its clients \u201cuntil the appendix page\u201d. 214', '179\\u2003The court views the terms in the Membership Agreement set out earlier at [170]\u2013[173] as grossly unfair and disadvantageous to Dathena and an affront to the UCTA. Those provisions are unenforceable.', '180\\u2003Once the Membership Agreement was validly terminated as the court finds, it was Dathena\u2019s prerogative (not obligation), to decide whether it would waive the Notice of Termination and accept any alternatives proposed by JustCo to replace the OCBC Premises. As the court pointed out to Sian-Tzu, 215', 'Dathena cannot be forced to accept the alternatives of the Verizon and Bras Basah Premises just because it suits JustCo\u2019s purpose to do so.', '181\\u2003The evidence does not show that Dathena waived the Notice of Termination. Dathena\u2019s willingness after 29 May 2020 to look at alternative premises offered by JustCo (including the OCBC Premises on 4 September 2020) was on the basis that it was without prejudice to the Notice of Termination. Further, having given the Notice of Termination, the court cannot comprehend how Dathena, as JustCo alleged, 216', 'can be said to have repudiated the contract on 4 September 2020 by filing this suit.', '182\\u2003Sheena\u2019s assumption that the Membership Agreement continued because of Dathena\u2019s conduct after 29 May 2020 is not credible (as counsel for Dathena said to her), in the light of the very clear language used in Dathena\u2019s Letter of Demand. The court said as much to Sheena and likened JustCo\u2019s self-denial to that of an ostrich putting its head into the sand, not wanting to know what was going on in the world outside. 217', '183\\u2003Dathena\u2019s alternative case had relied on the FCA and s 2 in particular which states:', '184\\u2003It bears noting that JustCo repeatedly insisted that the Membership Agreement was not frustrated as Dathena asserted. 218', 'However, the doctrine of frustration of contracts and the operation of the FCA is not dependant on parties\u2019 agreement. It is the law that determines that a contract is frustrated if it is, regardless of the parties\u2019 views. Once a supervening event occurs after the formation of the contract without the default of either party which renders the contractual obligation radically fundamentally different from what was agreed or, a contract becomes impossible to perform (as set out under s 2(1) of the FCA at [183]), a contract is frustrated. The result is that both parties are automatically discharged from their contract by operation of law (Allied Concrete Singapore Pte Ltd v Sato Kogyo (S) Pte Ltd [2014] 3 SLR 857). It is not JustCo\u2019s prerogative to decide that the Membership Agreement was not frustrated if indeed it was.', '185\\u2003Under s 2(2) of the FCA, sums paid under the frustrated contract must be refunded, which was what Dathena claimed.', '186\\u2003Did JustCo\u2019s four month\u2019s delay in delivering the OCBC Premises to Dathena and its inability to provide alternative comparable premises during that period render the Lease and the Membership Agreement frustrated? Was JustCo\u2019s contractual obligation radically fundamentally different from what was agreed to?', '187\\u2003Looking at the facts, it is this court\u2019s finding that the answers must be in the affirmative to the foregoing two questions. Nothing could be more telling of the termination (whether via operation of law or by the Notice of Termination) of the Membership Agreement than JustCo\u2019s own attempts to persuade Dathena to sign a new agreement to replace the Membership Agreement. Despite Sian-Tzu\u2019s valiant attempts (as elaborated at [117]) and disagreement when questioned by the court, the court is not persuaded that the new agreement was only to amend the existing contract \u2013 it was a fresh agreement altogether for entirely different premises (ie, the Bras Basah Premises) being the subject of the new lease. It was meant to supersede the Membership Agreement dated 16 January 2020. JustCo\u2019s own conduct thus indicated that at the material time, it was aware that it could not perform its contractual obligations as previously agreed to in the Membership Agreement.', '188\\u2003Consequently, JustCo\u2019s repeated attempts to replace the Lease of the OCBC Premises with a new lease first of the Verizon Premises and subsequently, of the Bras Basah Premises amounted to a fundamentally different contract than what the parties bargained for. This is especially so in the circumstances where it was not disputed that the sizes of the alleged alternative premises were not comparable to the OCBC Premises and other factors (such as location and exclusivity to use the premises) also clearly distinguished the alternative premises from the OCBC Premises. In short, the Verizon Premises, the Bras Basah Premises, additional moving costs incurred, and significantly delayed commencement dates were simply not what parties had agreed to.', '189\\u2003A related and disputed issue was JustCo\u2019s allegation of Dathena\u2019s change of business plans and its intended reduction of workforce and workspace. The court notes that as early as 15 November 2019, 219', 'JustCo\u2019s own email from Sian-Tzu to Aida clearly stated that the latter required an open plan office for 120 persons. Consequently, it was an exercise in futility for JustCo\u2019s counsel to suggest to Muffat repeatedly that the requirement to accommodate 120 staff was an afterthought on his part used to reject the Bras Basah Premises. It therefore also did not matter what Dathena\u2019s headcount in Singapore was, between the execution of the Membership Agreement (ie, 16 January 2020) and the Notice of Termination (ie, 29 May 2020). Further, it is undisputed that Dathena rented larger space at No 43 Niven Road and No 11 Blair Road than what it contracted at the OCBC Premises.', '190\\u2003There was no basis for JustCo to surmise that during and after, the imposition of CB Measures, Dathena\u2019s priority shifted from wanting an office space to wanting a server space. What the court does note from the evidence is, how quick JustCo was, first in pressing Dathena to execute the Membership Agreement and subsequently in invoicing Dathena for payments under the Membership Agreement even when those payments were not yet due (eg, the June 2020 rent mentioned at [33]\u2013[34]). In this regard, Song\u2019s surmise in para 4(d) of JustCo\u2019s letter dated 27 July 2020 that \u201cbusiness considerations\u201d motivated Dathena\u2019s change of heart on renting the OCBC Premises (as mentioned at [45]) is unfounded, in the light of Dathena\u2019s lease of alternative and larger premises at No 43 Niven Road and No 11 Blair Road after the Notice of Termination was issued.', '191\\u2003As an aside, JustCo\u2019s letter of 27 July 2020 as set out at [130] had relied on s 16 of the Covid-19 (Amendment) Act. Section 16 therein actually refers to an insertion of s 36 into the main legislation, namely the Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) Act (the \u201cCovid-19 Act\u201d).', '192\\u2003The entire s 36 (which is under Part 8) of the Covid-19 Act is headed \u201cContracts affected by delay in the performance or breach of a construction contract, supply contract or related contract\u201d. It applies where certain requirements are met, such that under s 36(1)(a)(iii) as parties entering into a contract that:', '193\\u2003Under Schedule 2 Part 2(2) of the Covid-19 Act. \u201cEssential Services\u201d include services related to (a) fixed telephony services; (b) mobile telephony services; (c) broadband internet access services; and (d) national domain name registry services.', '194\\u2003Based on Sian-Tzu\u2019s testimony as mentioned at [117], the court finds that JustCo could have but failed to take steps (as the tenant of OCBC CE) to assist M1 to activate Dathena\u2019s internet connection at the OCBC Premises.', '195\\u2003JustCo\u2019s repeated refrain in its closing submissions that it was never given an opportunity to address Dathena\u2019s concerns (regarding KDDI, the Verizon and Bras Basah Premises) does not sit well with the evidence that was adduced. Aida had WhatsApp 220', 'to JustCo that the Verizon Premises were unsuitable while Muffat\u2019s email of 7 July 2020 221', 'said the same of the Bras Basah Premises, as stated earlier at [37] and [39]. As JustCo was not knowledgeable of IT, the court does not see why Dathena was obliged to update JustCo on KDDI\u2019s unsuitability (as explained at [95]), bearing in mind that by mid-May 2020, Dathena was forced to contract with Vodien to host its servers as it had vacated its previous premises at OGS by early May 2020 (of which Sian-Tzu was informed much earlier on 10 April 2020, at [20]).', '196\\u2003In the light of the above findings, the court rules in favour of Dathena on its claim.', '197\\u2003Sheena\u2019s testimony on when JustCo stated looking for tenants to take over the space leased to Dathena was highly unsatisfactory. Taking into consideration that the date of the Notice of Termination was 29 May 2020, JustCo could have done more earlier to find a replacement tenant. Her explanation during re-examination did not improve the court\u2019s opinion of JustCo. 222', 'Sheena testified that even if JustCo wanted to look for a replacement tenant, it \u201cwould not have been easy\u201d, given that \u201coffice was actually especially customised for the Dathena size\u201d. The court also notes that JustCo intended to charge Dathena for reinstatement costs to reinstate a certain wall at the OCBC Premises in any case so the fact that the office was customised for Dathena\u2019s use is a lame and unacceptable excuse for failing to be more proactive in looking for replacement tenants. JustCo\u2019s lack of effort in this regard adversely affects its Counterclaim.', '198\\u2003JustCo\u2019s reliance on cl 8(c)(i) to claim the full balance of the Membership Fee for the 24 months\u2019 duration of the Lease 223', 'in its Counterclaim is in complete disregard of a contracting party\u2019s duty at law to take reasonable steps to mitigate its loss (see, eg, The \u201cAsia Star\u201d [2010] 2 SLR 1154). The court finds that JustCo failed to take more pro-active steps to mitigate its loss for the reasons expounded at [197]. However, nothing more needs to be said in this regard as, following upon the court\u2019s earlier findings in favour of Dathena, JustCo\u2019s Counterclaim is dismissed.'"}
{"casename":"2021_SGHC_22","fact":"the facts pertaining to \nRoszaidi\u2019s offence which are relevant to the experts\u2019 dispute. Roszaidi\u2019s \nevidence at trial was that he had been trafficking drugs for person known as \u201cIs \nCangeh\u201d. Roszaidi claimed that he had agreed do so because (a) he wanted to \nbe paid for each job; (b) Is Cangeh was his \u201cfriend\u201d and he trusted him; and \n(c) he would be able to satisfy his drug addiction by \u201csteal[ing] [drugs] from the \npacket[s]\u201d that he was trafficking. On the day of his arrest, Roszaidi had, as per \nusual, collected the Drugs on Is Cangeh\u2019s instructions. Upon receiving the \nDrugs, Roszaidi realised that the bundle was very heavy and he became \n\u201cconfused and scared\u201d. He then asked his wife, Azidah, who was pregnant at \nthe time, to \u201ctake the [Drugs] and keep [them] for [a]while for [him]\u201d. Roszaidi, \nAzidah and several others who had been involved in the transaction were \narrested by Central Narcotics Bureau officers shortly afterwards. \n12 Dr Rajesh testified that it was evident that Roszaidi suffered from \nimpaired rational judgment because he undertook the dangerous activity of \ntrafficking simply so that he could consume the drugs that he was asked to \ndeliver. With respect, however, I agree with Dr Saluja that this choice was in \nfact the consequence of an exercise of rational judgment on Roszaidi\u2019s part. \nRoszaidi\u2019s evidence \u2014 both in his statements as well as in his testimony in court \n\u2014 revealed that he was aware of the legal penalties of trafficking, but had \nnevertheless made a conscious decision to continue trafficking for Is Cangeh \nVersion No 2: 05 Feb 2021 (12:30 hrs)\nPP v Roszaidi bin Osman[2021] SGHC 22\n7because he believed that its risks were outweighed by its rewards. That Roszaidi \nhad made such a reasoned choice was evident from his testimony that he was \n\u201cwilling to take the risk of collecting drugs from strangers because [he]\u2026 \nwanted to be able to consume a portion of the drugs that [he] collected\u201d. \n13 Dr Rajesh also laid emphasis on Roszaidi\u2019s evidence that he had agreed \nto help Is Cangeh traffic the Drugs because he was \u201cconfused and scared that \n[he] [would] be framed], and that Is Cangeh \u201cwould ask his gang to beat [him] \nup\u201d. Dr Rajesh opined that in this \u201cpanic[ked] state\u201d, Roszaidi may have \noverestimated the dangers of trafficking and felt \u201chelpless\u201d and overwhelmed \nby his drug addiction and his fear of retribution. In my view, Roszaidi\u2019s fear of \nthe threat that Is Cangeh posed to his safety was again the result of rational \nthinking on his part. In his long statements, Roszaidi explained that he was \naware that Is Cangeh was a member of the \u2018369\u2019 gang. Moreover, there had \nbeen a previous incident where Roszaidi had angered Is Cangeh by throwing \naway a heavy drug consignment. This resulted in Is Cangeh deducting S$8,000 \nfrom Roszaidi\u2019s payment. In these circumstances, it was not illogical for \nRoszaidi to assume that Is Cangeh would react more strongly \u2014 perhaps even \nwith physical violence \u2014 if Roszaidi were to throw his consignment away for \nthe second time. \n14 In addition, there was nothing to show that Roszaidi\u2019s MDD had caused \nor contributed to Roszaidi\u2019s \u201cpanic[ked] state\u201d. Given that Roszaidi knew of the \ntrafficking penalties, it was only natural that he would have felt immense fear \nupon realising that the drugs were heavy enough to warrant capital punishment. \nIndeed, the fact that Roszaidi had experienced such emotions underscored his \ncapacity to comprehend and weigh the risks of his conduct. \nVersion No 2: 05 Feb 2021 (12:30 hrs)\nPP v Roszaidi bin Osman[2021] SGHC 22\n815 Finally, Dr Rajesh also interpreted Roszaidi\u2019s decision to give the Drugs \nto his innocent, heavily-pregnant wife as a sign of his inability to think and act \nrationally. However, in my view, this fact alone was not so \u201cextraordinarily \nabsurd\u201d as to demonstrate that Roszaidi was suffering from impaired rational \njudgment. It was equally plausible that Roszaidi passed the Drugs to his wife \nbecause (a) he assumed that she would not get caught; or (b) he had mistakenly \nbelieved that she would get a lighter sentence because she was pregnant. Indeed, \nRoszaidi explained in his statements that he had passed the drugs to his wife \nbecause \u201c[h]e thought it was safer than [him] carrying the drugs and driving \naround Singapore\u201d. \n16 For the above reasons, I do not find Dr Rajesh\u2019s evidence, as well as the \nDefence\u2019s submissions, to be persuasive. \n17 I turn to consider Dr Saluja\u2019s evidence. Counsel for the Defence, \nMr Eugene Thuraisingam, asserts that Dr Saluja\u2019s evidence \u201cf[ell] short of the \nrigour required of experts\u201d because of his failure to provide comprehensive \nreasons for the conclusions drawn in his reports. Mr Thuraisingam also argued \nthat Dr Saluja had taken an excessively narrow approach in assessing Roszaidi\u2019s \nmental state by focusing exclusively on Roszaidi\u2019s cognisance of the nature and \nwrongness of his acts. Finally, Mr Thuraisingam submits that Dr Saluja\u2019s \nreasoning proceeded on the faulty premise that Roszaidi\u2019s previous drug \noffences were completely uninfluenced by any mental disorders. \n18 I am unable to agree with Mr Thuraisingam\u2019s submissions. First, \nalthough Dr Saluja\u2019s reports were brief and his medical conclusions lacked \nexplanation at times, Dr Saluja well-able to defend and justify his views during \ncross-examination. I thus find that the gaps in Dr Saluja\u2019s medical reports were \nnot so detrimental to his credibility as to render his evidence unreliable as a \nVersion No 2: 05 Feb 2021 (12:30 hrs)\nPP v Roszaidi bin Osman[2021] SGHC 22\n9whole. Second, I disagree that Dr Saluja had failed to undertake a holistic \nassessment of Roszaidi\u2019s conduct. To the contrary, Dr Saluja had looked at \nmatters \u201clongitudinally\u201d and had even considered Roszaidi\u2019s psychiatric history \nand history of substance abuse in arriving at a view on whether Roszaidi\u2019s \njudgment had been impaired at the material time. Dr Saluja also explored the \nmotivations behind Roszaidi\u2019s decisions and, in so doing, went beyond merely \nascertaining Roszaidi\u2019s capacity to understand the nature of his acts and to \ndifferentiate right from wrong. Finally, as regards Mr Thuraisingam\u2019s third \ncontention, I note that there was no dispute between the experts that Roszaidi \nhad only begun to exhibit symptoms of MDD about seven months prior to his \narrest (see [ 9] above). In fact, it appeared that the source of this information was \nRoszaidi himself, as Dr Saluja\u2019s understanding of Roszaidi\u2019s psychiatric history \nwas derived from his interviews with Roszaidi while Roszaidi was in remand. \n19 Having considered the evidence before me in its totality, I agree with \nDr Saluja that Roszaidi\u2019s ability to execute the tasks that Is Cangeh required of \nhim evidenced his ability to think in a logical and organised manner. The fact \nthat Roszaidi may have felt fear and, eventually, remorse as a result of his \nactions has no bearing on the question of whether his judgment was impaired at \nthe material time.\n20 In Nagaenthran, the Court of"}
{"casename":"2021_SGHC_220","fact":"facts concerning the purported Sale Agreement \nare largely undisputed. Parties have not spoken to each other, and only \ncorresponded through their lawyers. The only question before me is whether an \nagreement has crystallised, which can be addressed within the four corners of \nthe correspondence, without the need to cross-examine parties.\n7 In the 27 August 2018 letter, the defendant\u2019s solicitors stated that they \nwere instructed that the defendant would \u201cbuy over [the plaintiff]\u2019s 66% share \nin the property at [the plaintiff]\u2019s valuation of $4,500,000.\u201d Two days later, the \ndefendant\u2019s solicitors wrote to the plaintiff\u2019s solicitors the following: \n1. our client and\/or our client\u2019s nominee proposes to buy your \nclient\u2019s share in the property known as 16 Sennett Road \nSingapore 466794 at the price of $3,234,000.00, being 66% of \n$4,900,000.00;\n2. in the event of such sale to our client and\/or our client\u2019s \nnominee, the following terms shall apply:\na. the sale is to proceed by way of a Sale and Purchase \nAgreement;\nb. legal completion is to take place in 24 weeks, as our \nclient requires time to raise funds and arrange for \nfinancing;\nc. your client\u2019s claim against our client for the sum of \n$14,980.28, as well as our client\u2019s claim for the sum of \n$16,055.57 against your client shall both be crossed-\nout against the other and neither party shall claim \nagainst the other for the same under HC\/ \nOS 1426\/2017, nor shall such sums be provided for, \nfrom the sale proceeds.

The completion of the sale would therefore be \n20 February 2019.\n4. The other terms in paragraph 2 of your letter are accepted.\n5. Attached is a copy of the Sale and Purchase Agreement. The \ndeposit payable at the time of signing the Sale and Purchase \nAgreement is 10% of the purchase price ie. $323,400.00, to be \nmade payable to our client.\n6. As you know the hearing has been adjourned to \n19 September 2018. Please have your client or nominee sign \nthe Sale and Purchase Agreement and return it to us together \nwith the deposit by 14 September 2018.\n9 The draft SPA attached to the 5 September 2018 letter states that upon \nthe signing of the draft SPA, the defendant is to pay the plaintiff $323,400.00 \nas a deposit. No deposit was paid, and no SPA signed or executed. The draft \nSPA also included other terms such as the incorporation of the Law Society of \nSingapore\u2019s Conditions of Sale 1999, and the usual \u201csubject-to\u201d clauses in \nproperty transactions. \nVersion No 1: 27 Sep 2021 (12:51 hrs)\nTan Ngiap Tong v Tan Ngep Hong[2021] SGHC 220\n610 On 5 September 2018, the parties\u2019 solicitors exchanged further e-mails. \nThe defendant\u2019s solicitor noted that the draft SPA did not provide for a sale to \nthe defendant, or the defendant\u2019s nominee. The plaintiff\u2019s solicitor replied that \nthe plaintiff would be agreeable to the sale to be made to a nominee, and further \nstated that the plaintiff \u201cmay amend the SPA accordingly\u201d. \n11 In my view, the issue, however, is whether parties intended to enter into \na binding agreement without having signed or executed any formal agreement. \nWhether there is a binding contract depends on whether parties have the \nrequisite intentions to enter into a binding contract. It could be said that the \ndefendant\u2019s solicitor, by stating that the sale is to proceed by way of a sale and \npurchase agreement, prefaced the offer with a \u201csubject to contract\u201d term in the \ncorrespondence, which means that there was no intention to enter into a binding \nagreement until a formal document is executed. But it could also be said that the \ndefendant\u2019s solicitor was only anticipating a subsequent written contract, which \ndoes not preclude the formation of an oral agreement. \n12 Whether an agreement is \u201csubject to contract\u201d is a matter of substance \nand not form. Even if there is no express \u201csubject to contract\u201d, the court may \nstill construe parties\u2019 intention as such. The inquiry is whether the execution of \na further contract is a condition precedent, or it is merely an expression of \nparties\u2019 desire for the transaction to proceed in a certain manner. In the latter \nscenario, the lack of a formal document does not preclude the formation of a \ncontract. The key is whether parties expect to be immediately bound to perform \non the agreed terms (see OCBC Capital Investment Asia Ltd v Wong Hua Choon \n[2012] 2 SLR 311). Based on the incontrovertible evidence in the \ncorrespondence in this case, it could not have been parties\u2019 intention to be \nimmediately bound to perform based on the plaintiff\u2019s solicitor\u2019s letter dated \n5 September 2018, without finalising and executing the draft SPA.\nVersion No 1: 27 Sep 2021 (12:51 hrs)\nTan Ngiap Tong v Tan Ngep Hong[2021] SGHC 220\n713 Looking at the broader context in which the correspondence took place, \nparties were engaging in negotiations because of the plaintiff\u2019s prior application \nfor the Property to be sold. This was due to the acrimony and deadlock between \nthe plaintiff and defendant. The operative word in the defendant\u2019s solicitor\u2019s \nletters is \u201cpropose\u201d, followed by a few scenarios depending on the plaintiff\u2019s \nresponse. That this was a negotiation to settle a long-standing dispute between \ntwo siblings shows that it could not have been the defendant\u2019s intent to be \nimmediately bound should the plaintiff accept his proposal, without finalising \nthe terms of the purchase. Hence, the defendant\u2019s solicitor\u2019s proposal to proceed \nwith the sale by way of a sale and purchase agreement is not just an expression \nof a desire to proceed with the transaction in a certain manner; it should be \nconstrued as a \u201csubject to contract\u201d condition. Without a formal document, the \nagreement to purchase the shares in the Property has yet to be crystallised. \n14 Furthermore, in addition to the price and the completion date, there were \nother terms to be finalised in the sale and purchase agreement, such as the \namount of deposit payable upon the signing of the draft SPA. These were new \nterms proposed by the plaintiff\u2019s solicitors, which the defendant\u2019s solicitors \nhave yet to communicate their client\u2019s acceptance. The facts of Reindeer \nDevelopments Inc v Mindpower Innovations Pte Ltd [2007] SGHC 170, a case \nreferred to by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, are distinguishable. In that case, parties \nagreed on the terms of sale, including the purchase price, the option fee and \noption period. The defendant purchaser wrote on the back of the cheque for the \noption money some of these terms. The cheque was then handed to the plaintiff \nseller. The court thus found that there was a contract. But here, the terms of the \ndraft SPA have only been communicated for the first time by the plaintiff\u2019s \nsolicitors to the defendant\u2019s solicitors. As of 5 September 2018, the defendant \nhad not communicated acceptance of the terms of the draft SPA, let alone signed \nVersion No 1: 27 Sep 2021 (12:51 hrs)\nTan Ngiap Tong v Tan Ngep Hong[2021] SGHC 220\n8it or made any deposit to confirm the agreement. I thus find that there was no \nenforceable agreement to purchase the plaintiff\u2019s shares in the Property as of \n5 September 2018. \n15 The plaintiff\u2019s claim for expenses incurred between the purported Sale \nAgreement and the actual sale of the Property is dismissed for the same reason \nthat there was no contract concluded as of 5 September 2018. As for the sum \nheld by Mr Choo Kwun Kiat as the stakeholder, this is to be paid to the plaintiff \nand defendant in the ratio of 66:34, being their respective shares in the Property.\n16 I will hear parties on cost at a later date if they are unable to agree costs.\n      - Sgd -\nChoo Han Teck\nJudge of the High Court\nSee Tow Soo Ling, Zheng Yangyou (CNPLaw LLP) for the plaintiff;\nYee May Kuen Peggy Sarah, Audrey Liaw Shu Juan (Liao Shujuan) \nand Chua Ru En Rachel (PY Legal LLC) for the defendant.\nVersion No 1: 27 Sep 2021 (12:51 hrs)"}

At the material time, the Plaintiff and his wife owned 890m shares in Ming Lam (\u201cthe ML shares\u201d) with the Plaintiff holding 90% and his wife holding 10% thereof.', '3\\u2003The Defendant who is a Chinese national, is the sister-in-law of one Ding Lei (\u201cDing\u201d), as she is married to his younger brother. Ding was a business associate of the Plaintiff at the material time. At one time, the Defendant worked with\/for the Plaintiff.', '4\\u2003According to the affidavit of evidence-in-chief (\u201cAEIC\u201d) of Ding, 1', 'he was approached by the Plaintiff in Hong Kong in or about September 2018 and asked how the Plaintiff could raise cash on an urgent basis using the ML shares.', '5\\u2003Ding suggested that one option would be for the Plaintiff to engage in margin financing by pledging the ML shares to a securities company and drawing cash based on a percentage of the market value of the pledged ML shares. Ding also informed the Plaintiff that a margin financing account with a securities company can be operated easily online and trading could be done, using a login code and a password.', '6\\u2003However, Ding told the Plaintiff that there was a drawback on margin financing from securities companies in Hong Kong. It was usually not available to foreigners. Ding advised the Plaintiff that a bank account also needed to be opened in the name of the margin account holder, who would have to pre-sign cheques to enable the Plaintiff to withdraw funds from the bank account.', '7\\u2003The Plaintiff inquired if Ding could assist him to find a trustworthy Hong Kong local or a Chinese national, who could hold some of the ML shares for him. However, the Plaintiff would operate and control the margin account himself.', '8\\u2003In the course of their discussions, Ding learnt that the Plaintiff was indebted to various creditors and had also furnished personal guarantees to banks in Singapore that had extended loans to his companies in Singapore. One such personal guarantee was for about S$50m for loan facilities extended to MEP Logistics Pte Ltd (\u201cMEP\u201d).', '9\\u2003Subsequently, the Plaintiff told Ding he needed someone to hold 300m of the ML shares (\u201cthe 300m shares\u201d) for him. Around 20 September 2018, Ding contacted the Defendant and inquired if she could oblige the Plaintiff. Out of goodwill as the Plaintiff was her former employer, the Defendant agreed. As the ML shares would only be held by the Defendant on the Plaintiff\u2019s behalf, it was agreed that no payment would be made by the Defendant to the Plaintiff for the 300m shares.', '10\\u2003Accordingly, the Defendant signed all the requisite forms and the 300m shares were transferred to her. The Defendant also opened a bank account with HSBC (\u201cthe HSBC account\u201d) as required by the Plaintiff.', '11\\u2003On Ding\u2019s recommendation, the Plaintiff opened an account with Grand China Securities Ltd (\u201cGrand China\u201d) to hold the 300m shares and for margin trading, based on the 300m shares as collateral. Ding was not involved with the account opening process at Grand China, which arrangements were made by the Plaintiff himself, although it was Ding who put the parties in touch. Ding deposed that the internet banking login details and\/or bank token and pre-signed books of cheques were delivered to a contact in Hong Kong as instructed by the Plaintiff.', '12\\u2003In his AEIC, 2', 'the Plaintiff alleged that he flew to Hong Kong with his wife on or about 21 September 2018. There, Ding obtained blank documents addressed to various securities companies in Hong Kong and asked him to sign them; those companies included Grand China. The Plaintiff added that Ding then arranged for him to meet the representative of the securities companies and for him (and his wife) to open a bank account with the Bank of China (\u201cthe Bank of China account\u201d) so that sale proceeds of the ML shares that he sold could be deposited into the account.', '13\\u2003Subsequently, on or about 2 November 2018, when the Defendant was in Hong Kong, Ding deposed that he received a telephone call from the Plaintiff\u2019s wife who requested that Ding contact the Defendant to remit S$200,000 from the HSBC account to Singapore as the Plaintiff needed money urgently.', '14\\u2003Ding did contact the Defendant and inquired if she could effect the remittance requested by the Plaintiff. The Defendant agreed and remitted S$200,000 (\u201cthe remittance\u201d) to the Plaintiff in Singapore. The Plaintiff received S$199,980 and the shortfall of S$20.00 was probably due to bank charges deducted from the remittance.', '15\\u2003It was the Plaintiff\u2019s case 3', '(which the Defendant and Ding denied), that the remittance represented a part-payment by the Defendant for the 300m shares that the Plaintiff alleged he sold to her. The Plaintiff referred to a contract note 4', 'issued by Grand China dated 17 June 2019 which showed that 100m of the 300m ML shares were sold to the Defendant at Hong Kong Dollar (\u201cHKD\u201d) 0.255 per share for HKD 7,650,000.', '16\\u2003The Plaintiff deposed he found out subsequently that the 300m shares were sold to the Defendant at HKD 0.265 per share for HKD 79,500,000. The Plaintiff used an exchange rate of HKD 1.00 to S$0.18 to convert the HKD 79,500,000 to S$14,310,000 (\u201cthe purchase price\u201d). The Plaintiff produced no documents to substantiate this allegation.', '17\\u2003The Plaintiff alleged in his AEIC 5', 'that the Defendant failed, neglected and\/or refused to pay him the balance of the purchase price amounting to S$14,110,00 (S$14,310,000 less the remittance).', '18\\u2003The Plaintiff claimed he was unaware of any arrangements made between Ding and the Defendant. He further denied there was any agreement made between him and the Defendant to hold any of the ML shares on trust for him.', '19\\u2003For a claim of the magnitude of S$14,110,000, the Plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim (\u201cSOC\u201d) consisted of six short paragraphs contained in one page.', '20\\u2003The Defendant\u2019s defence was slightly longer. The Defendant repeated what Ding said in his AEIC as set out earlier at [4] to [14]. Basically, the Defendant denied the Plaintiff\u2019s allegation that she purchased the 300m shares or owed him the sum he claimed. She contended she merely held the 300m shares on trust for him.', '21\\u2003In his Reply, the Plaintiff repeated what was set out earlier at [15] and averred that Ding had agreed to help him sell the ML shares of which 300m were sold to the Defendant.', '22\\u2003The Plaintiff was the only witness for his case. Like his SOC, the Plaintiff\u2019s AEIC was brief. Hence, the court has to look at his oral testimony extracted in the course of his cross-examination and re-examination to obtain more details of his claim.', '23\\u2003The Plaintiff disclosed that he first became acquainted with Ding in 2016 or 2017 because Ding was an investor in a then listed company, Lorenzo International Ltd (\u201cLorenzo\u201d), in which the Plaintiff and his partner were shareholders. He claimed that Ding\u2019s wife was the majority shareholder of Ming Lam.', '24\\u2003Despite Ding only being a business acquaintance, the Plaintiff testified he trusted Ding enough to leave ML shares worth HKD 79m with him. Questioned by counsel for the Defendant as well as the court, the Plaintiff was unable or unwilling to explain why he trusted Ding to such an extent.', '25\\u2003Apart from the contract note in [15] and apart from his bare assertions, the Plaintiff did not produce a single document to evidence the forms he signed with Grand China or any other securities company in Hong Kong. Neither did he produce any document to prove that he opened an account with the Bank of China bank in Hong Kong. When asked by the court 6', 'for his copies of the documents that the securities company asked him to sign and his Bank of China account particulars, the Plaintiff replied he did not produce them because \u201c[m]y lawyer did not ask me to\u201d. This was an absurd\/unacceptable answer.', '26\\u2003Questioned by the court, 7', 'the Plaintiff claimed he was not even sure that he signed any documents until he was confronted by counsel for the Defendant with his signature on a sale note dated 9 October 2018 (\u201cthe Sale Note\u201d) stating he had sold 300m Haijing shares to the Defendant at HKD 0.265 and the consideration paid was HKD 79,500,000. 8', 'The Plaintiff then claimed that he was in Singapore on 9 October 2018 and he had pre-signed the Sale Note. He added that the sale note was probably \u201cpart of a pile of documents that the securities company gave [him] to sign\u201d. 9', 'He said he left the signed blank documents in Ding\u2019s office.', '27\\u2003The Plaintiff testified that when he was not paid for the 300m shares, he chased Ding, looked for him in Hong Kong and was told by Ding to look for the buyer. That was the reason the Plaintiff sued the Defendant.', '28\\u2003It was also during cross-examination that the Plaintiff disclosed 10', 'the Defendant was not his subordinate in MEP but a fellow director.', '29\\u2003However, it was only during re-examination 11', 'that the true position of the Plaintiff\u2019s relationship with Ding came to light. Apparently, the Plaintiff used to own a company called Manufacture Element Prefabricate Pte Ltd (\u201cMEPPL\u201d) of which MEP was a subsidiary. He claimed he wanted to sell MEPPL as it had a lot of assets (which claim is not credible, see below at [44]) and approached Ding who was his fellow shareholder in Lorenzo.', '30\\u2003Ding suggested that the Plaintiff sell MEPPL to Ding\u2019s wife\u2019s company, Ming Lam and which the Plaintiff did. The sale price was S$90m which included Ming Lam\u2019s taking over and repaying MEPPL\u2019s loan from United Overseas Bank Ltd (\u201cUOB\u201d) of around S$50m (\u201cthe UOB loan\u201d) of which the Plaintiff was a personal guarantor. However, the Plaintiff did not receive cash for the net sale price of S$40m. Instead, he was paid in shares of Haijing (before its name change to Ming Lam). Hence, the Plaintiff ended up with 890m ML shares.', '31\\u2003After the Plaintiff sold off his MEPPL shares to Ding, the latter became the company\u2019s major and controlling shareholder. Ding then appointed the Defendant to the board of its subsidiary MEP.', '32\\u2003Saddled with 890m shares in a Hong Kong listed company by Ding or Ding\u2019s wife, the Plaintiff not surprisingly wanted to liquidate the said shares for cash. That transaction was the genesis for the Plaintiff\u2019s turning to Ding for help.', '33\\u2003Unlike the dearth of documents on the Plaintiff\u2019s part, the Defendant produced copious documents to support her version of the facts\/events. The documents included (a) the account opening forms and standing authority letters (two such letters) of Grand China dated 27 September 2018 12', 'that she signed; (b) the settlement instructions form of Grand China dated 9 October 2018; (c) numerous HSBC statements; and (d) a statement of Grand China of the Defendant\u2019s margin account for the period 2 January 2018 to 18 June 2019. 13', 'In addition, there was a letter from Grand China dated 18 June 2019 14', 'addressed to the Defendant demanding payment of HKD 624,400.81 that it was owed by her.', '34\\u2003It is noted from Grand China\u2019s account opening form 15', 'that the Defendant\u2019s annual income exceeded HKD 1m (approximating S$172,413, at the conversion rate of HKD 5.80 to S$1.00). However, as the Defendant herself pointed out, 16', 'a person of her means is unlikely to be able to afford to purchase shares worth HKD 79m.', '35\\u2003The Defendant\u2019s AEIC mirrored her defence. In addition, the Defendant deposed to the following additional facts:', '(a)\\u2003In accordance with what Ding told her, she was contacted by someone when she was in Hong Kong and the person accompanied her on 27 September 2018 to Grand China\u2019s office and to HSBC\u2019s branch (at East Ocean Centre) to open accounts (she did not date Grand China\u2019s forms);', '(b)\\u2003the email address and mobile phone number stated in her account opening forms with Grand China did not belong to her (in cross-examination, the Defendant could not say who they belonged to); 17', '(c)\\u2003while she was on holiday in Hong Kong with her family in November 2018, she received Ding\u2019s message on or about 2 November 2018, requesting her to send money to the Plaintiff via telegraphic transfer, which she did. Apart from that one transaction, none of the other transactions in the HSBC account were carried out by her;', '(d)\\u2003apart from the fact that there was no sale and purchase agreement between them, the Plaintiff did not state when the alleged purchase price of HKD 79m was supposed to be paid by the Defendant; and', '(e)\\u2003she believed the value of the ML shares the Plaintiff pledged to Grand China must have plummeted leading the company to liquidate all his shares and leaving a shortfall of HKD 624,400.81 (between the Plaintiff\u2019s margin loan(s) and the sale proceeds) which Grand China sought to claim from her (see above at [33]).', '36\\u2003In cross-examination, 18', 'the Defendant disclosed why she did not question Ding and\/or the Plaintiff when she was approached for help. She explained that the three of them had a very good relationship and if they did not tell her, she would not ask them anything as she considered both of them as her bosses. She trusted both of them unquestioningly. According to what Ding told her, she believed that the Plaintiff wanted the margin trading account to hide the ML shares from UOB because of his personal guarantee to the bank.', '37\\u2003In cross-examination, the Defendant revealed that she did not insert her income details in the account opening forms and she certainly did not have a net worth of HKD 15m as stated therein. 19', 'Neither did she have liquid assets of HKD 1m to 5m. 20', 'It appeared that the Defendant neither read nor understood what she signed at the office of Grand China. However, she recalled that when she signed the Bought Note 21', 'as transferee, only the Plaintiff\u2019s signature was on the document but not his name. There were no entries or stamps on the document and her name was not inserted.', '38\\u2003As for the bank statements she received from HSBC, the Defendant explained she did not pay attention to the transactions stated therein as Ding told her she was not responsible for those transactions. Similarly, she ignored the statements sent to her by Grand China until she received its letter in [33] demanding payment from her of HKD 624,400.81. When she asked Ding about it, he said he had no idea.', '39\\u2003As Ding\u2019s AEIC was in line with the Defendant\u2019s, the court turns to his testimony adduced during cross-examination. Ding testified he did tell the Plaintiff that selling the ML shares was difficult; it would be a long and tedious process and the Plaintiff could only go through securities companies to obtain margin financing.', '40\\u2003Ding stated that apart from recommending certain securities companies to the Plaintiff, he left it to the Plaintiff to make direct contact with the securities companies which the Plaintiff did. Further, after telling Grand China (when he was contacted and asked) that the account would be opened in the name of the Defendant, Ding was not aware of the specifics and what sort of account was opened until much later. Neither was Ding aware of who controlled the account that the Defendant opened at Grand China as that was an agreement between the Plaintiff and Grand China. In addition. it was only after the Defendant had opened the HSBC account that Ding became aware of the same (the Defendant had testified someone (whom she could not identify) accompanied her to HSBC to open the account).', '41\\u2003Notwithstanding the Sale and Bought Notes, Ding said there was no sale transaction regarding the ML shares. Ding who seemed to be fairly familiar with the Hong Kong securities industry, explained that a purported sale and purchase was the only method in Hong Kong 22', 'by which the Defendant could hold shares on the Plaintiff\u2019s behalf.', '42\\u2003Ding confirmed that the modus operandi as regards bank accounts for margin financing purposes was to have the person who opened the margin account and related bank account to relinquish all rights and control over the margin and bank accounts in favour of the beneficial owner by signing standing letters of authority, settlement instruction forms listed at [33], pre-signing cheques and handing over bank tokens and login passwords for internet banking, to either the beneficial owner or his authorised representative or the securities company with which the margin account was opened.', '43\\u2003Ding insisted that the 300m shares were held by the Defendant on behalf of the Plaintiff and she never bought those shares. He accused the Plaintiff of lying in contending otherwise. He was aware that the Defendant never traded on the ML shares. In fact, she had never purchased or traded in any shares. Ding denied he told the Plaintiff to go after the buyer of his shares when the Plaintiff allegedly chased him for payment. He said he could not, as the Defendant is his sister-in-law and in trying to help the Plaintiff, he got her into trouble.', '44\\u2003Ding also denied that Ming Lam is owned by his wife as a majority shareholder, contrary to what the Plaintiff claimed. His wife owned less than 20% of Ming Lam\u2019s shares and does not control Ming Lam. Ding alleged that when Ming Lam bought over MEPPL, the Plaintiff hid a lot of his own debts from Ming Lam. The Plaintiff had by then defaulted on the UOB loan and could not even afford to pay the interest. That was why the Plaintiff was in a hurry to transfer that debt to someone else. The court was therefore sceptical of the Plaintiff\u2019s claim that he sold off MEPPL as it had a lot of assets (see above at [29]). It seems more likely than not that the company was debt-ridden. A shareholder of a company which is asset rich is highly unlikely to want to get rid of it as the Plaintiff did in regard to MEPPL.', '45\\u2003The only issue the court has to decide in this case is, did the Plaintiff sell 300m of the ML shares to the Defendant as he alleges or, did she merely hold the shares on his behalf as she and Ding contend?'"}

Unexpectedly, for Mr Ong at least, Mr Manu suddenly secured a deal with F&BCo which resulted in the deposit of US$2,764,104.53 into the SCB Account on 25 August 2017. 16', 'Prior to a small deposit of US$7.22 into the SCB Account on 23 August 2017, the account balance had been zero. 17', '9\\u2003The deal AMG did with F&BCo is unusual. F&BCo apparently requested that AMG receive an irrevocable confirmed documentary letter of credit (the \u201cDLC\u201d) in the sum of US$2,860,000 issued by Kasikornbank Public Company Limited of Bangkok, Thailand (\u201cKasikornbank\u201d) pursuant to a discounting\/monetizing agreement and memorandum of understanding dated 21 June 2017 between AMG and F&BCo (the \u201cMOU\u201d). 18', 'Under the terms of the MOU, AMG was to pay 75% of the value back to F&BCo \u2013 ie, the sum of US$2,145,000 \u2013 within three business days. 19', 'A further 5% of the value, namely US$143,000, was to be paid to White Lotus Cosmetics Limited (\u201cWhite Lotus\u201d), described as a service fee in the MOU. 20', 'The balance 20% of the value \u2013 ie, US$572,000 \u2013 was \u201cnon-recourse payment for AMG\u201d. 21', '10\\u2003A documentary letter of credit is an instrument which facilitates the sale of goods. It is a contract by which an issuing bank agrees upon the application of the buyer to pay the seller of goods upon presentation of specified documents evidencing that the goods have been shipped by the seller to the buyer (usually internationally). On the expiry of a specified period, usually after he receives the goods, the buyer pays the issuing bank. The issuing bank also charges the buyer a fee for this facility. This arrangement, which underpinned the development of modern cross-border commerce, typically has these three participants of buyer, seller and issuing bank, the last of whom may appoint another bank to negotiate the presentation of documents for payment in the country where the seller is located.', '11\\u2003In more recent times, a fourth participant is sometimes added, and plays a purely financing role. This fourth participant discounts or monetizes the documentary letter of credit by paying the seller an agreed percentage of the face value of the letter of credit before the presentation of documents by the buyer to the issuing bank. He is known as the discounter or monetizer. The monetizer would then receive payment from the issuing bank in place of the seller. This allows the seller to receive earlier in time a substantial part of the payment. The monetizer\u2019s reward is the difference between his discounted payment to the seller and the face value subsequently paid by the buyer via the negotiating and issuing banks.', '12\\u2003Under the arrangement between AMG and F&BCo, AMG was, at least on paper, the seller of 1,000 metric tons of aluminium sheets to F&BCo and would receive its payment via the DLC issued by Kasikornbank. 22', 'However, under the MOU, AMG also took on the role of discounter or monetizer, blending that role with its other role of seller. 23', '13\\u2003Under the terms of the arrangement between AMG and F&BCo, AMG retained 20% of the sale price (ie, US$572,000), as its \u201cnon-recourse payment\u201d. The balance 80% of what flowed from Kasikornbank to AMG was to be paid to White Lotus (5%) and F&BCo (75%). Ultimately, F&BCo would have to pay Kasikornbank the full face value of the DLC (and any associated interest or other fees applicable under its facility with Kasikornbank, which was not before me). AMG\u2019s counsel confirmed that this was the structure of the arrangement between AMG and F&BCo, while simultaneously asserting from the Bar that these terms were known to Kasikornbank. 24', 'I consider it more likely, however, that this was a transaction primarily intended to facilitate the flow of money, and am not persuaded and do not make any finding that its true nature was known to Kasikornbank or SCB.', '14\\u2003Indeed, the only logical inference is that Mr Manu on behalf of AMG presented false delivery documents in order to receive payment of US$2,860,000 from Kasikornbank via the negotiating bank (ie, SCB). Had Mr Manu then caused AMG to perform its role under the MOU of paying 75% to F&BCo and 5% to White Lotus, AMG would have retained the balance 20% making a profit of US$572,000.', '15\\u2003AMG did not supply F&BCo with the 1,000 metric tons of aluminium sheets 25', '(although, as I have said, it must have presented purported delivery documents to Kasikornbank in order to obtain payment). Neither did AMG pay the agreed-upon US$2,145,000 to F&BCo. F&BCo opted to pursue the payment of the US$2,145,000 through the issue of the statutory demand on 22 November 2017. 26', '16\\u2003There is an additional background aspect that it is helpful to sketch, namely AMG\u2019s shareholding over the years. The full picture was not provided by parties, but a rough outline emerges. First, as a result of three allotments taking place in September and October 2006, Mr Ong originally held 100,000 shares, 27', 'while Mr Koh was the registered owner of 1,080,000 shares, of which 1,079,996 shares were allotted to Mr Koh as a nominee holding on trust for a company called Weeds Natural Remedies Pte Ltd (\u201cWeeds\u201d), in consideration of the provision by Weeds of certain formulae for natural health supplements and an eight-year licence to exclusive use of certain registered trade marks. 28', 'Lastly, 100,000 shares were held by a third person, who has since ceased to have any association with AMG. 29', '17\\u2003Mr Ong gave no clear evidence of what became of his shareholding, but a directors\u2019 resolution dated 21 September 2017 shows that at the time, 640,000 shares were registered in his name. 30', 'As for Mr Koh, although his evidence was that he had entrusted all his shares to Mr Ong when he left AMG in 2014, 31', 'a director\u2019s resolution dated 25 September 2017 records a transfer of 640,000 shares from him to Mr Manu. 32', 'What is clear is that by 23 January 2018, at least, Mr Manu had become the 100% owner of AMG. 33', '18\\u2003A third point is also material by way of background. AMG seems to have had no assets other than the balance in the SCB Account. 34', 'Nor does it seem to have had any business that might be the source of revenue. 35', 'The significance of this is that once the balance in the SCB Account fell below the US$2,145,000 AMG owed to F&BCo, AMG would no longer have been able to pay that debt, and would have been insolvent. AMG reached this state on or about 29 August 2017. 36', 'Further large payments and withdrawals continued to take place after that. 37', '19\\u2003While AMG is represented, both Mr Ong and Mr Koh are litigants-in-person. At the start of trial, Mr Ong had not filed any affidavit of evidence-in-chief. I nonetheless allowed him to give evidence, notwithstanding AMG\u2019s objection. Mr Ong\u2019s decision to give evidence followed my explanation to him that only statements made by him in the witness box would be relied on by me, but that if he gave evidence he would be subject to cross-examination. I considered my intervention to be necessary to ensure a just and fair trial, but I remained mindful that any leeway given to the defendants should not mean that they could act without regard to the court\u2019s rules and procedures. In this case, I found that, upon my providing the defendants with some explanation of the process, both acted responsibly and respectfully. I also sought to ensure \u2013 and was satisfied \u2013 that the plaintiff was not prejudiced in its conduct of the case by any indulgence given to the defendants as litigants-in-person.'"}

Mr Millsopp\u2019s conversion claim involved those very \nconcepts:\n(a) \u201c[T]he 1st Defendant has committed the tort of conversion by \nwrongfully withdrawing the Funds in cash from the 4th Defendant\u2019s \nUOB Account and applying the proceeds to his own use and\/or keeping \nsuch proceeds\u201d [emphasis added] (para 32, SOC);\n(b) \u201cThe Funds were wrongfully withdrawn by the 1st Defendant \nsome time shortly after the Funds were received in the 4th Defendant\u2019s \nUOB Account\u201d [emphasis added] (para 33(a), SOC); and\n(c) \u201cThe 1st Defendant acted in a manner which was repugnant to \nthe terms of the FX Agreement by causing the 3rd and 4th Defendants to \nwrongfully withdraw the Funds in cash and\/or utilise or transfer the \nFunds, thereby terminating the FX Agreement ...\u201d [emphasis added] \n(para 33(b), SOC).\n61 Paragraph 33(b) of the SOC makes it clear that the withdrawal, \nutilisation, transfer, and conversion of the Funds in Ling Capital\u2019s GBP account \nis said to be wrongful because it was contrary to the terms of the FX Agreement. \nVersion No 1: 28 Oct 2021 (11:04 hrs)\nMillsopp, Michael Joseph v Then Feng[2021] SGHC 228\n24As pleaded in para 30 of the SOC, the FX Agreement was allegedly breached \nbecause:\n(a) The 1st Defendant failed, refused and\/or neglected to \nconvert the Funds from GBP to USD after they were received in \nSingapore.\n(b) The 1st Defendant failed, refused and\/or neglected to \nremit the Funds in USD to the UK within 48 to 72 hours after \nthe Funds were received in Singapore.\n62 In the context of the SOC as a whole, the allegation in para 38(b) that \nMr Then had \u201cwrongfully withdrawn and\/or utilised or transferred and \nconverted to his own use\u201d the Funds in Ling Capital\u2019s GBP account is based on \nhim not converting the Funds to USD, and not remitting the converted Funds \n(in USD) to the UK. That takes us full circle to the Agreement being an FX \nAgreement.\n63 If Mr Millsopp had intended to claim on the alternative basis of the \nAgreement being a remittance agreement (rather than an FX Agreement), one \nwould expect him to say so, especially after Mr Then filed his defence asserting \nthat the Agreement was for a loan to be repaid in GBP. Instead, Mr Millsopp \nfiled a reply that disputed Mr Then\u2019s version of the Agreement, without \nembracing any part of it (not even remittance in GBP) for an alternative claim. \nMr Millsopp simply maintained that the Agreement was an FX Agreement.\n64 Further, if Mr Millsopp had framed his unjust enrichment claim to cover \ntwo possibilities \u2013 FX Agreement, and remittance agreement \u2013 why did he not \ndo likewise with his breach of contract and conversion claims (which are \nadmittedly based on the Agreement being an FX Agreement)? After all, if the \nAgreement were a remittance agreement whereby Mr Then was to pay the \nbalance of the Funds in Ling Capital\u2019s account to the UK:\nVersion No 1: 28 Oct 2021 (11:04 hrs)\nMillsopp, Michael Joseph v Then Feng[2021] SGHC 228\n25(a) Mr Then would have breached that remittance agreement by not \nmaking that payment to the UK; and\n(b) the withdrawal of the balance of the Funds (instead of their \nremittance to the UK) would have been conversion.\n65 Mr Millsopp did not frame his breach of contract and conversion claims \non the alternative basis of the Agreement being a remittance agreement, because \nhe had not put forward that alternative basis at all \u2013 not even for his unjust \nenrichment claim.\n66 Mr Then says he understood Mr Millsopp\u2019s claims to be premised on \nthe Agreement being an FX Agreement; and that Mr Then\u2019s decision to submit \n\u201cno case to answer\u201d, his cross-examination, and indeed his entire strategy, was \nbased on that.\n67 If I were to allow Mr Millsopp to claim on the alternative basis of the \nAgreement being a remittance agreement (belatedly mentioned for the first time \nin oral closing submissions), that would be prejudicial to Mr Then. In the \ncircumstances, I hold Mr Millsopp to his pleaded case that the Agreement was \nan FX Agreement, which I have found he has failed to prove.\nThe unjust enrichment claim \u2013 evidence\n68 If, however, Mr Millsopp were allowed to pursue his unjust enrichment \nclaim on the alternative basis of the Agreement being a remittance agreement, \nwas that supported by the evidence?\n69 Mr Millsopp and his witnesses (in particular Mr Atkins) gave no \nevidence that the Agreement was a remittance agreement. Nor was this what \nVersion No 1: 28 Oct 2021 (11:04 hrs)\nMillsopp, Michael Joseph v Then Feng[2021] SGHC 228\n26Mr Then had pleaded the Agreement was, such that Mr Millsopp could rely on \nany admissions in that regard.\n70 Mr Millsopp did say that the use of the Funds in Ling Capital\u2019s GBP \naccount was restricted, but that restriction was said to be in relation to the Funds \nhaving to be converted to USD and then remitted to the UK, ie, on the basis that \nthe Agreement was an FX Agreement. Moreover, that is an unusual restriction \n\u2013 it would mean that Mr Then had to convert the very Funds in Ling Capital\u2019s \nGBP account to USD. If Mr Then had USD on hand, he could not simply remit \nthat to Mr Millsopp \u2013 on Mr Millsopp\u2019s case, that would be a breach of the FX \nAgreement: Mr Then had to convert the Funds in Ling Capital\u2019s GBP account \nto USD, he could not pay Mr Millsopp the USD equivalent from another source. \nIt is strange for a party seeking to get USD in return for his GBP, to care whether \nthe USD he receives was converted from his GBP, or comes from another \nsource. Mr Millsopp never explained why this should matter to him.\n71 On Mr Millsopp\u2019s case, it would be a breach of the FX Agreement (or \nremittance agreement) if the Funds in Ling Capital\u2019s account were used for any \npurpose other than to perform the Agreement. Yet the contemporaneous \nWhatsApp messages do not show Mr Millsopp checking on whether the Funds \nwere still in that account; he simply sought to check on the remittance to the \nUK.\n72 Mr Millsopp acknowledged under cross-examination that it did not need \nto be Ling Capital making the payment to the UK \u2013 payment could come from \na third party, or indeed, multiple third parties:47 \nMike, I just want to clarify, when you sent the sterling to Ling \nCapital, what was your understanding as to how the US dollars \n47 Transcript, 17 August 2021, p 119 line 2 to p 120 line 16.\nVersion No 1: 28 Oct 2021 (11:04 hrs)\nMillsopp, Michael Joseph v Then Feng[2021] SGHC 228\n27would reach your Barclays account in the UK?

My understanding was it could be any of the above. We were \ngoing to determine how that was going to happen. I -- I wasn't \n-- I wasn't bothered how. It was \u2013 that was all to be controlled \nby you.\nQ. Got it. So you didn't -- so it was not -- it was not the case \nwhere you had -- you had sent the money to Ling Capital and \nyou had expected Ling Capital to send the money back. You \nwere more than happy for third-party payments from a single \nor multiple sources in the aggregate amount of the US dollars \nthat were supposed to be received, correct?\nA. Yeah, because that was -- you were going to determine that. \nIt didn't bother me. What -- what you did at your business end \nwas up to you. I wasn't concerned with that.\nQ. Okay, that's helpful, because that -- that was my \nunderstanding, that you were not looking purely at Ling Capital \nto return the sterling to you. If you could just look on 1BA 107, \nat the bottom of the page, the text message that I sent on 13 \nFebruary.\nA. Yeah.\nQ. I guess the key bit was: \"Look forward to any comments \nbefore we finalise the entity to use on our side.\"\nA. Yeah.\nQ. So it's -- you know, there is no confusion here, right? You \nhad agreed with me that you would be -- that you would receive \n-- that you would receive the US dollar -- you would receive the \nfunds from any third party. It didn't necessarily have to be from \nLing Capital?\nA. Correct.\n73 In establishing those points in cross-examination, Mr Then had posed \nsome questions to Mr Millsopp about payment in USD, but that was no \nadmission by Mr Then that the Agreement was an FX Agreement. Mr Then\u2019s \nfocus there was on Mr Millsopp being amenable to accepting payment to his \nVersion No 1: 28 Oct 2021 (11:04 hrs)\nMillsopp, Michael Joseph v Then Feng[2021] SGHC 228\n28UK account from parties other than Ling Capital.

Mr Millsopp did not; as he said \nunder cross-examination, he was not bothered or concerned, and what Mr Then \ndid on his end was up to him.\n76 As I noted above (at [ 33]), on 28 February 2019 Mr Then offered to \narrange for his own funds from the US to be sent to Mr Millsopp, if the \nremittance supposedly from UOB to Mr Millsopp\u2019s UK account were further \n48 Transcript, 17 August 2021, p 90 line 18 to p 91 line 2.\n49 AB 171\u2013172.\nVersion No 1: 28 Oct 2021 (11:04 hrs)\nMillsopp, Michael Joseph v Then Feng[2021] SGHC 228\n29delayed. Again, Mr Millsopp did not say that it would be a breach of the \nAgreement if the payment came from a source other than the Funds in Ling \nCapital\u2019s account.\n77 Similarly, when Mr Gaillard entered the picture in March 2019, and both \nMr Gaillard and Mr Then told Mr Millsopp that he could expect payment from \nMr Gaillard, Mr Millsopp did not object to that arrangement, although on his \ncase it would be a breach for him to be paid from a source other than the Funds \nin Ling Capital\u2019s account.\n78 In truth, Mr Millsopp did not care about the source of the payment back \nto the UK. The evidence does not establish that the same Funds in Ling Capital\u2019s \naccount had to be paid back to the UK (whether in USD or GBP).\n79 There is evidence that Mr Then was involved in what became of the \nFunds after they were transferred to Ling Capital, but that does not advance \nMr Millsopp\u2019s case unless Mr Millsopp can establish that any use of the Funds \nother than to perform the Agreement (on his case, an FX Agreement) would be \nwrongful.\n80 For completeness, I briefly review the evidence on this. Mr Ling\u2019s \nevidence was that the whole amount was either taken by Mr Then, or paid out \nat his direction. It is common ground between Mr Ling and Mr Then that \nS$1.7m was withdrawn in cash from the Hougang MRT branch of UOB, when \nthey were both present. Mr Ling took a photograph of Mr Then leaving with the \ngreen bag containing the cash, which Mr Ling says Mr Then handed to one \nMr Daniel Ng. The evidence also includes a photograph of the cash in the bag \n(which Mr Ling opportunistically used to fend off his own creditors). These \nphotographs are reproduced below:\nVersion No 1: 28 Oct 2021 (11:04 hrs)\nMillsopp, Michael Joseph v Then Feng[2021] SGHC 228\n3081 Mr Gaillard gave evidence that Mr Then had told him the cash was used \nto pay one Mr Huang, a client of Mr Then\u2019s.50\n82 Mr Then\u2019s position, however \u2013 as put by him in cross-examination of \nMr Ling \u2013 is that Mr Ling was the one who eventually left with the cash in the \nbag, and that Mr Then only held the bag for a short while at Mr Ling\u2019s request.\n83 It is unnecessary for me to make specific findings as to what became of \nthe money in Ling Capital\u2019s account. That may yet be the subject of future \nproceedings. \n84 For present purposes, what matters is that Mr Millsopp\u2019s alternative \nclaim on the basis of the Agreement being a remittance agreement is unpleaded; \n50 Transcript 20 August 2021, p 89 line 18 to p 91 line 8.\nVersion No 1: 28 Oct 2021 (11:04 hrs)\nMillsopp, Michael Joseph v Then Feng[2021] SGHC 228\n31and it is also unsupported by the evidence.

Had Mr \nMillsopp pleaded that alternative, Mr Then may have approached his cross-\nexamination, indeed, his entire strategy, differently \u2013 he might even have \ndecided not to submit \u201cno case to answer\u201d, but instead to lead evidence to prove \nthat the Agreement was for a loan, that Mr Millsopp agreed that he would look \nto Mr Gaillard for the repayment of the loan, and what became of the Funds in \nLing Capital\u2019s account.\n85 Mr Millsopp relies on an authority he describes as highly analogous: Lyu \nYan v Lim Tien Chiang and others [2020] SGHC 145 (\u201cLyu Yan\u201d), affirmed on"}
{"casename":"2021_SGHC_229","fact":"'4\\u2003The plaintiff is a company incorporated in Taiwan while the defendant is a company incorporated in Singapore. 1', 'The parties had, from May 2018 to September 2018, an \u201camicable working relationship\u201d during which six sale and purchase agreements for gasoil of various quantities, ranging from 9,588.743 metric tons (\u201cMT\u201d) to 13,930.843 MT, were executed without any problems. The plaintiff thus decided \u201cto increase the volume of gasoil to be ordered under the seventh and eighth agreements\u201d dated 8 October 2018 (the \u201cFirst Contract\u201d) and 19 October 2018 (the \u201cSecond Contract\u201d) respectively (collectively, the \u201cContracts\u201d). 2', 'Each of the Contracts concerned the sale by the defendant to the plaintiff of 20,000 MT (+\/\u2013 10% at the seller\u2019s option) of gasoil with 500ppm sulphur content, with delivery on free on board (or \u201cFOB\u201d) Taichung basis. 3', 'Under the First Contract, delivery of the gasoil was to be effected between 28 September to 30 October 2018 (ie, a 33-day loading period) while under the Second Contract, the delivery period was between 1 and 30 November 2018. Delivery of the contracted quantities could be effected by way of \u201cmultiple liftings\u201d with a minimum quantity of 2,000 MT per lifting to be loaded onboard the nominated vessel. 4', '5\\u2003Clause 26 of the Contracts is identical, and I reproduce below the pertinent parts which parties referred to (\u201cClause 26\u201d): 5', '6\\u2003On 30 October 2018 and under the First Contract, 1,994.862 MT of gasoil was loaded at the port of Taichung onboard the motor tanker \u201cOSLO\u201d nominated by the plaintiff as the FOB buyer (the \u201cOSLO Parcel\u201d), and for which the plaintiff paid the defendant a sum of USD 1,425,003.37. The plaintiff alleged that there were quality issues with the OSLO Parcel, and in respect of which it had to eventually compensate the third-party buyer to whom it had on-sold the cargo. 6', 'Save for the OSLO Parcel, the plaintiff failed to take delivery of any of the remainder of the cargo it had contracted to buy from the defendant under the Contracts because of the alleged quality concerns. 7', 'The defendant subsequently sent two letters dated 28 November 2018 to the plaintiff purporting to terminate the Contracts and stated that it would claim \u201closses, damages, costs and expenses\u201d against the plaintiff. 8', '7\\u2003By a Notice of Arbitration filed with the SIAC on 21 December 2018, the plaintiff commenced two arbitrations against the defendant, one under each of the Contracts. 9', 'Both arbitrations were subsequently consolidated by the SIAC on 15 February 2019. The arbitral tribunal was constituted on 23 April 2019 (\u201cTribunal\u201d) with the appointment by the SIAC of a sole arbitrator (\u201cArbitrator\u201d). 10', '8\\u2003In the arbitration proceedings, the plaintiff claimed, inter alia, for a refund of \u201c[a]ll sums that have actually been received by the [defendant] from the [plaintiff]\u201d in relation to the First Contract. 11', 'The plaintiff also sought a declaration that the Second Contract had \u201cnot been validly formed\u201d and a declaration that the defendant \u201cis not entitled to any payment\u201d under the Contracts. 12', 'The defendant in turn counterclaimed, inter alia, for the plaintiff\u2019s breach in its failure and\/or refusal to \u201ctake delivery of the cargo as agreed\u201d. Instead, the plaintiff \u201conly took delivery of 1,994.862MT of cargo under [the First Contract] on 30 October 2018, and took no further deliveries thereafter\u201d. 13', 'The defendant also counterclaimed for the plaintiff\u2019s breach in respect of the Second Contract, with damages for breach of the Contracts to be calculated based on s 50(2) of the Sale of Goods Act (Cap 393, 1999 Rev Ed) (\u201cSOGA\u201d). 14', 'As will be elaborated below, the defendant subsequently changed tack and proceeded on the basis that the damages, if any, due to the defendant were to be calculated based on s 50(3) of the SOGA instead. Section 50(3) of the SOGA provides that:', '9\\u2003In the arbitral proceedings, the plaintiff advanced two arguments relating to the aforementioned issues (the \u201cArguments\u201d). According to the plaintiff, the defendant \u201chad failed to adduce evidence of actual losses (the \u201cNo Actual Losses Argument\u201d)\u201d and \u201chad no goods [ie, the requisite gasoil to supply] for the majority of the [33-day loading period] and therefore suffered no losses (the \u201cNo Goods No Losses Argument\u201d)\u201d. 15', 'In summary, the plaintiff\u2019s No Actual Losses Argument was that the defendant \u201chad failed to adduce evidence of actual losses and accordingly, had not suffered any actual losses despite [the plaintiff\u2019s] breach of contract\u201d and thus claimed for \u201cforecasted\u201d losses which \u201cwere never incurred\u201d. 16', 'The plaintiff\u2019s No Goods No Losses Argument was that the defendant \u201cdid not have sufficient [g]asoil to supply to [the plaintiff] under the [Contracts] and therefore could not have suffered any losses\u201d. In that regard, the plaintiff argued that the defendant\u2019s own documents \u201cshowed that they did not have the necessary goods to meet [the required volume of gasoil] all the way until 24 October, just a week left until the end of the loading period\u201d under the First Contract. 17', '10\\u2003Lastly, I noted that parties had initially disputed whether there was an available market and hence a number of the arguments made and evidence tendered in the arbitration proceedings revolved around the issue of hedging and whether the defendant had failed to mitigate its alleged loss. The plaintiff contended that the defendant ought to have mitigated its losses by entering into gasoil hedging contracts on or shortly after 30 October 2018 and 6 November 2018 for the First and Second Contracts respectively, when the defendant had initially denied that there was an available market for the gasoil. 18', 'However, about a week prior to the evidentiary hearing, the defendant conceded that there was an available market. Thereafter, the question of whether there was an available market was no longer a contentious issue or contemplated in parties\u2019 submissions in the arbitration. Consequently, the issue of hedging became irrelevant and s 50(2) of the SOGA was no longer the focus. 19', 'At the hearing before me, counsel for the defendant, Mr Siraj Omar SC, confirmed that while the defendant had initially advanced its case on the basis of there being no available market, it subsequently dropped that claim and instead advanced its claim on the basis that there was an available market, and relied on s 50(3) of the SOGA instead. 20', '11\\u2003In the arbitral proceedings, the defendant also counterclaimed for the plaintiff\u2019s breach of Clause 26 of the Contracts, the relevant portions of which have been reproduced at [5]. The defendant submitted that the plaintiff had breached Clause 26 of the First Contract by: (a) failing to ensure that its own sale contract with its buyer, Great Sign Ltd (\u201cGreat Sign\u201d), regarding the OSLO Parcel contained the same or equivalent Restricted Destination clause (as required by Clause 26.6); and (b) failing to provide documentation verifying the final destination of the OSLO Parcel (in breach of Clause 26.3). Clause 26.8 thus entitled the defendant to an indemnity from the plaintiff for any fines or penalties imposed on it. 21', '12\\u2003The plaintiff responded that Clause 26 could not be relied on by the defendant following the defendant\u2019s termination of the First Contract. In particular, it was not stipulated in either of the Contracts that Clause 26 would survive termination. As such, the plaintiff sought to adduce expert evidence on whether Clause 26 would survive termination as a matter of industry practice. This forms the contextual backdrop to the second ground of objection which the plaintiff raised in OS 51 (see [19] below). The plaintiff also submitted that, in any case, Clause 26.8 is a compensatory indemnity and not a preventive indemnity. In that regard, the defendant has not suffered any losses as a result of any alleged breach of Clause 26 which the plaintiff ought to indemnify. 22', '13\\u2003On 17 November 2020, the Tribunal issued the Award in favour of the defendant. The Tribunal held, inter alia, that: 23', '(a)\\u2003the plaintiff was in breach of the First Contract by failing to lift the remaining gasoil within the loading period, and such breach entitled the defendant to terminate the First Contract, which it did by way of letter on 28 November 2018; 24', '(b)\\u2003the plaintiff was in breach of the Second Contract by failing to provide a letter of credit by 9 November 2018 and by failing to lift any gasoil within the loading period, and such breaches entitled the defendant to terminate the Second Contract, which it did by way of letter on 28 November 2018; 25', 'and', '(c)\\u2003the plaintiff was in breach of Clause 26 of the First Contract by failing to ensure that its sale contract with Great Sign regarding the OSLO Parcel contained the same or equivalent Restricted Destination clause in the First Contract and by failing to provide documentation verifying the final destination of the OSLO Parcel. The Tribunal therefore granted a declaration that the plaintiff was required to indemnify the defendant in the event that any fines or penalties are imposed on the latter by reason of the final destination of the OSLO Parcel. 26', '14\\u2003Flowing from the findings as set out at [13(a)] and [13(b)], the Arbitrator found that the defendant was entitled to be compensated for any loss and damage it had suffered by reason of the plaintiff\u2019s breaches of the Contracts for non-acceptance of gasoil, with damages to be assessed by reference to s 50 of the SOGA as follows: 27', '(a)\\u2003concerning the First Contract, the difference between the contract price and the market price on the next business day after the expiry of the loading period (ie, 31 October 2018), rounded to the nearest dollar; and', '(b)\\u2003concerning the Second Contract, the difference between the contract price and the market price on the next business day after the expiry of the loading period (ie, 3 December 2018).', '15\\u2003The Arbitrator made three dispositive orders against the plaintiff: 28', '(a)\\u2003in respect of the First Contract, the Arbitrator awarded the defendant damages in the sum of USD 303,555.00 plus (i) interest at the rate of 6.30688% per annum from 31 October 2018 (inclusive) until the date of payment (exclusive) and (ii) costs and expenses in the amount of S$504,407.09 and costs of the arbitration pursuant to Clause 20 of the First Contract;', '(b)\\u2003in respect of the Second Contract, the Arbitrator awarded the defendant damages in the sum of USD 3,055,096.00 plus (i) interest at the rate of 6.37888% per annum from 3 December 2018 (inclusive) until the date of payment (exclusive) and (ii) costs and expenses in the amount of S$504,407.09 pursuant to Clause 20 of the Second Contract; and', '(c)\\u2003an indemnity for any fines or penalties imposed on the defendant by reason of the final destination of the parcel of 1,994.862 MT of gasoil delivered to the plaintiff aboard the MT OSLO on 30 October 2018 pursuant to Clause 26.8 of the First Contract.'"}

Two charges were eventually brought against the Defendant under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (\u201cMDA\u201d) for trafficking in diamorphine. On 27 August 2013, the Defendant was convicted by the High Court of both charges. On 24 October 2013, the High Court judge (the \u201cJudge\u201d) also found that the Defendant was a courier for the purpose of s 33B(2)(a) of the MDA. A criminal reference was then filed to the Court of Appeal. In its decision, the Court of Appeal provided guidance on the meaning of a courier for the purpose of the aforementioned provision and set aside the Judge\u2019s finding. The case concerning the Defendant was then remitted to the Judge. On 4 February 2015, the Judge decided that the Defendant was not a courier for the purpose of s 33B(2)(a) of the MDA and passed the death sentence on the Defendant.

In the OS, the PP sought, in substance, the same orders which I eventually granted (as set out at [1(a)]\u2013[1(e)] above). The PP\u2019s two main arguments were as follows:', '(a)\\u2003Between 2005 and 2010, the Defendant had accumulated wealth of $360,794.08, for which only $193,364.57 came from known sources of income. Under s 4(4) of the CDSA, the remaining $167,429.51 was presumed to be benefits derived by the Defendant from his drug dealing activities. The Defendant had, however, failed to satisfactorily explain his holding of this sum of $167,429.51. As such, a confiscation order under s 4 of the CDSA ought to be made against the Defendant for the amount of $167,429.51.', '(b)\\u2003The Defendant had \u201crealisable property\u201d, as defined in s 2(1) of the CDSA, of $237,647.77. The court should hence order that the amount of $167,429.51 be recovered from the Defendant and that certain specified \u201crealisable property\u201d be applied to satisfy the confiscation order sought.', '5\\u2003On the other hand, the Defendant contested the PP\u2019s submission as regards his net worth and the property that could be \u201crealised\u201d for the purpose of satisfying any confiscation order against him. In particular, the Defendant claimed that, contrary to the PP\u2019s submission, a sum of $60,000 held in his mother\u2019s bank account belonged to her rather than him. More generally, he argued that his income was greater than what the PP had indicated and that he had fully explained the wealth he accumulated between 2005 and 2010. The Defendant hence took the position that the court should refuse to make the confiscation order and the other orders sought by the PP.'"}

It was also the Prosecution\u2019s case that the appellant had been in control of the entire process of submitting the application forms together with either BL080 or AN080. 6', '6\\u2003In respect of the actus reus, the defence argued that there was no evidence that the appellant had submitted the applications for invoice financing with copies of BL080 or AN080, or that he had known or directed his staff to do so. The defence\u2019s position was that it was the administrative duty of his staff (namely one Ms Cheah Yin Li and\/or Ms Nah Xin Ying) to prepare the documents for either himself or Mdm Neo to sign. 7', 'The defence further argued that there was no evidence that the banks had been indeed been deceived into delivering the monies stated in the invoices from the suppliers, as the specific officers processing the applications were not called or identified, and that the banks\u2019 terms and conditions did not require either BL080 or AN080 to be provided as evidence of shipment. 8', 'A key plank to the defence\u2019s arguments at trial was the alleged practice of transhipment described by the appellant, whereby suppliers would ship goods from one country to another via a third country without physically passing through Singapore, and as no transport documents were provided, the applications for financing would have been submitted without any transport documents attached nor would it have been required. 9', 'In respect of the mens rea, the defence\u2019s argument was quite simply that the appellant did not have the requisite knowledge that the submitted documentation was false. 10', '7\\u2003At the conclusion of the trial below, the District Judge (\u201cDJ\u201d) found that the appellant had been the main decision maker at Intraluck and the person whom the banks recognised and negotiated with. 11', 'In this regard, the DJ found that the loan facilities extended to Intraluck by the banks required the provision of transport documents in the form of either BL080 or AN080, 12', 'and that the appellant had the knowledge of or had specifically agreed to the requirement that the transport documents be provided as part of the application process. 13', 'The appellant\u2019s attempts to argue that the requirement for the transport documents were a mere guideline, was contradicted by the oral and documentary evidence adduced in court, 14', 'in particular the fact that the appellant had certified true copies of the transport documents was consistent with the finding that the documents were required to obtain the funds disbursements from the banks. 15', '8\\u2003The DJ also found that the four statements recorded from the appellant pursuant to s 22 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (\u201cCPC\u201d) were voluntarily made, and gave a detailed account of how the appellant went about directing the applications to the various banks in order to draw down on the facilities provided. 16', 'In the DJ\u2019s view, it was clear from the various statements that the appellant was the one who had chosen and included the transport documents in the applications, and had submitted or directed the applications appending those transport documents to be submitted to the banks. 17', 'While the appellant contended that the statements were inaccurately recorded, the DJ found that there was nothing objective to indicate otherwise, and that the necessary safeguards were in place to ensure the accuracy of the recording. 18', '9\\u2003The DJ further found that the appellant was aware that the banks would only grant a loan if they obtained a transport document, and being unable to produce a genuine transport document, the appellant had chosen to submit either BL080 or AN080 to banks. 19', 'These transport documents were in turn considered and relied upon by the banks as part of the approval process for the invoice financing. 20', 'The DJ agreed with the Prosecution that the transport documents were an essential requirement for the application for invoice financing, the banks would have checked for this documents, the documents were indeed provided for, and the funds were accordingly disbursed. 21', 'As all the elements of the six charges were proven beyond a reasonable doubt, the appellant was convicted. 22', '10\\u2003The DJ agreed with the Prosecution that the primary sentencing consideration was that of deterrence, in view of the need to safeguard the integrity of Singapore\u2019s financial services and reputation. 23', 'The DJ also agreed with the Prosecution that the large sums involved, extent of planning, clear profit motive, difficulty in detecting such schemes, and the lack of remorse, indicated that a substantial sentence was appropriate. 24', '11\\u2003Having considered the precedent cases, the DJ found that the appropriate starting sentence was a global sentence of about 42 months\u2019 imprisonment. 25', 'However, as the appellant was suffering from chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (\u201cCMML\u201d), which is a rare form of blood cancer, the DJ turned to consider the guidelines set out by the High Court in Chew Soo Chun v Public Prosecutor and another appeal [2016] 2 SLR 78 (\u201cChew Soo Chun\u201d), on considering the impact of ill health on sentencing. In the DJ\u2019s view, this was not an appropriate case for the exercise of judicial mercy as the need for deterrence in the present case weighed in favour of punishment, that the present case was not an exceptional one, and the Singapore Prison Services (\u201cSPS\u201d) had made it clear that it was able to adequately manage the appellant\u2019s medical condition. 26', '12\\u2003Notwithstanding, the DJ found that the appellant\u2019s medical condition was a mitigating factor as it was shown in the various medical reports that the appellant would have likely faced serious difficulties in incarceration, and the SPS had not definitively stated whether being imprisoned would cause disproportionate suffering to the appellant. 27', 'Accordingly, the DJ reduced the sentence by six months, and sentenced the appellant to a global sentence of 36 months\u2019 imprisonment. 28'"}

This company was previously owned by Mr Laszlo. It held 70% of what has been described as the ICE Group, comprising a Malaysian company, ICE Mobile Sdn Bhd and a Singapore company, ICE Messaging Pte Ltd. Mr Lazlo sold his shares in Skantek to Mr Logan under an oral contract made some time in 2013, with the second defendant holding legal title to these shares. The alleged debt arises from this sale and I shall refer to it as the Skantek debt. As the trust has been apparently terminated in January 2014, such that Mr Logan became the legal owner of the Skantek shares, 1', 'the second defendant has ceased to play any substantive role in these proceedings.', '5\\u2003There are other persons whom it is helpful to identify at this stage. The first is Dutt Devika Maria (\u201cMs Devika\u201d), whom Mr Laszlo married in 2011 when Mr Logan apparently was the best man. She did not give evidence in these proceedings. The other four whom I shall mention were witnesses. Balamurali Balasubramaniam, who testified on behalf of Dr Vas and Mr Laszlo, was formerly the CEO of the ICE Group. He was replaced in 2014 by Suresh Kumar (\u201cMr Suresh\u201d), who testified on behalf of Mr Logan.', '6\\u2003Mr Allahverdi Mohammad Reza attended a meeting on 15 January 2018 that included Dr Vas and Mr Logan, which followed shortly after the alleged assignment of the Skantek debt. I shall refer to him as Mr Reza. There was a fourth participant in the meeting, one Shervin Sharghy (\u201cMr Shervin\u201d), who came with Dr Vas. Lastly, Mr Tan Siew Bin Ronnie testified on behalf of Mr Logan. I shall refer to him as Mr Tan.

It is the unpaid balance which is said to be the Skantek debt. When Mr Laszlo pressed for payment of the balance in 2014, Mr Logan claimed that Mr Laszlo had misrepresented its value. There followed a telephone conversation between Mr Laszlo and Mr Tan about the Skantek debt, during which Mr Laszlo is said by Mr Tan to have accepted that neither party had or should have any claim against the other. After this telephone call, neither Mr Laszlo nor Mr Logan took any steps against the other for a full three years.', '9\\u2003In the interim, Mr Logan started having some dealings with Dr Vas. Mr Logan lent US$350,000 to Clarity. I will refer to this as the \u201cClarity debt\u201d.

Dr Vas relied on a deed of assignment dated 14 January 2018 13', 'but in fact executed much later in 2019. 14', 'It recorded that Mr Laszlo had a \u201ccause of action\u201d against Mr Logan for US$2,400,000 which he thereby assigned to Dr Vas in return for 7,000 MyDoc shares held on trust for him, valued by agreement at US$3,000,000.', '15\\u2003Dr Vas also executed another trust deed dated 1 November 2019. 15', 'Under this deed, having recorded that he owned 100,000 MyDoc shares, he declared a trust over 4,000 of those shares in favour of Ms Devika, Mr Laszlo\u2019s wife.', '16\\u2003Dr Vas successfully set aside the statutory demand on the ground that he might be owed a debt larger than that demanded from him. Dr Vas then commenced these proceedings.', '17\\u2003While Dr Vas contended that he had taken a valid legal assignment of the Skantek debt, he joined Mr Laszlo as second plaintiff on the alternative basis that there had been an equitable assignment. An equitable assignee must sue in the name of the assignor.', '18\\u2003Following service of Mr Logan\u2019s defence, Dr Vas successfully applied to join Mr Logan\u2019s brother-in-law as the second defendant, because he had originally been the registered legal owner of the shares in Skantek.

According to the Oxford English Dictionary, \u201cbroadcast\u201d means to \n\u201cscatter widely abroad\u201d or to \u201cwidely disseminate\u201d.54 Even further still, \nSheppard J noted that for radio and television broadcasts, the Oxford English \nDictionary states that broadcast means (at 306):\n\u2018to disseminate (a message, news, a musical or dramatic \nperformance, or any audible or visible matter) from a radio or \ntelevision transmitting station to the receiving sets of listeners \nand viewers...\u2019\n[emphasis added]\n56 Based on the foregoing, one interpretation of \u201cbroadcast\u201d is that the \nwork must be transmitted directly to the general public or a part thereof (\u201cthe \nFirst Interpretation\u201d). But, on another view, the plain meaning of \u201cbroadcast\u201d \ndoes not shut out the conceptual possibility of the PTP transmission being \ndownlinked to numerous intermediate broadcasters which together form a part \nof the general public (\u201cthe Second Interpretation\u201d). This is especially so if I am \nwrong about persons overseas not forming part of the \u201cpublic\u201d under s \n26(1)(a)(iv) of the Copyright Act (see [ 107] below). Under this latter \ninterpretation, uplinking in the context of PTP transmissions may amount to a \nbroadcast.\n57 However, when determining the ordinary meaning of a word or \nprovision, courts should also have due regard to the context of that text within \nthe written law as a whole (Attorney-General v Ting Choon Meng and another"}

In these, he had admitted that he was aware that the five \n\u201cbooks\u201d contained cannabis, and that they were in his backpack, which he had \nthrown into the canal while being pursued by the CNB officers.43  Ramendra \nhad also taken the position in these statements that he only intended to keep one \nof the \u201cbooks\u201d for himself, and that he had been asked by Joe to deliver four \n\u201cbooks\u201d to someone else.44\n17 A discrepancy emerged in Ramendra\u2019s sixth statement recorded on \n17 March 2018 and his seventh statement recorded on 7 January 2020, both \nunder s 22 of the CPC.  In those statements, Ramendra provided a different \naccount of events: he claimed that it was Sherryl who was collecting the five \n\u201cbooks\u201d from Joe, and Ramendra was only accompanying her in the taxi.  \nHowever, in his oral testimony, Ramendra unequivocally recanted these two \nstatements.45  He explained that he had made them because he was \u201cangry with \nthe whole situation\u201d that he was in.46  Put simply, the two statements contained \nuntrue assertions.

Such \nprejudice arises from the accused person\u2019s lack of a sufficient opportunity to \nmeet and to rebut the amended charges against him (Goh Chin Soon v Public \nProsecutor [2021] 4 SLR 401 at [79]).  In the present case, the Prosecution\u2019s \napplication to amend the existing charge and to frame new charges came \nrelatively late in the day, only after the close of the accused\u2019s defence.  \nHowever, the substance of the proposed charges was substantially similar to the \noriginal charge, save that two separate charges of trafficking, and one for \npossession, were being framed now in respect of the \u201cbooks\u201d of cannabis, \ninstead of just a single charge of trafficking all five \u201cbooks\u201d.  This was in line \nwith the evidence Ramendra had given on the stand in relation to what he would \ndo with the five \u201cbooks\u201d he received from Lavinder.  Further, the Defence was \nextended the opportunity to supplement its case to meet the proposed charges \nthrough fresh evidence or the recalling of witnesses, though this was not taken \nup.  As such, I was satisfied that no prejudice would be occasioned to the \naccused, and I exercised my powers under s 128(1) of the CPC to alter the \nexisting charge and to frame the additional two charges.\n23 Ramendra\u2019s plea was taken in relation the amended first charge, the \nsecond charge, and the third charge.  He pleaded not guilty to all three charges.55\n53 Transcript, 29 June 2021, p 3 lines 17\u201331.\n54 Transcript, 29 June 2021, p 3 lines 17\u201331.\n55 Transcript, 29 June 2021, p 4 line 19 to p 5 line 28.\nVersion No 1: 26 Oct 2021 (10:30 hrs)\nPP v Ramendra Krishnan[2021] SGHC 242\n11The law\n24 The elements necessary to make out a charge under s 5(1)(a) of the \nMDA are (Muhammad Ridzuan bin Md Ali v Public Prosecutor and other \nmatters [2014] 3 SLR 721 at [59]):\n(a) possession of a controlled drug;\n(b) knowledge of the nature of the drug; and\n(c) proof that possession of the drug was for the purpose of \ntrafficking which was not authorised.\n25 In a similar vein, the elements necessary to make out a charge under \ns 8(a) of the MDA are (see Adili Chibuike Ejike v Public Prosecutor \n[2019] 2 SLR 254 at [35]\u2013[40]):\n(a) possession of a controlled drug;\n(b) knowledge of the nature of the drug; and\n(c) the accused\u2019s possession of the drug was not authorised.\n26 For both sections, proving the element of possession of a controlled drug \nencompasses not only the fact of physical possession but also an element of \nknowledge, in that the accused knew that the drug was in fact in his possession, \ncustody or control (Adili at [34]\u2013[35]).  This is often referred to as \u201cknowing \npossession\u201d.\nThe Prosecution\u2019s case\n27 The Prosecution argues that the elements of the charges under s 5(1)(a) \nand s 8(a) of the MDA have been established.  \nVersion No 1: 26 Oct 2021 (10:30 hrs)\nPP v Ramendra Krishnan[2021] SGHC 242\n1228 Ramendra was found in possession of the five \u201cbooks\u201d of cannabis, \nwhich are the subject of the charges.  They were in his backpack, which he threw \ninto the canal.  Cannabis is a controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to \nthe MDA.  Ramendra has admitted in his statements and his testimony in court \nthat he knew that all five \u201cbooks\u201d were in his backpack, and that they were \npackaged blocks of cannabis.  This satisfies the elements of knowing possession \nand knowledge of the nature of the drug for each of the three charges.56\n29 For the amended first charge relating to exhibits A1A1A, A1B1A, \nA1C1A and A1E1A, Ramendra admitted that he intended to deliver four \n\u201cbooks\u201d to someone in Jalan Kayu, on the instructions of Joe.  On the basis that \nthese four exhibits were the four \u201cbooks\u201d that would have been delivered by \nRamendra, the Prosecution submits that the offence of trafficking has been \nmade out, and as such, Ramendra should be convicted of the amended first \ncharge.57\n30 For the second charge relating to trafficking in 389.84g of cannabis \n(80% of 487.3g, which is the amount of cannabis in exhibit A1D1A), Ramendra \nadmitted that he intended to keep one of the five \u201cbooks\u201d for himself, and that \nhe would sell 80% of that \u201cbook\u201d to his friends by repackaging the cannabis \ninto smaller packets or bundles.  Proceeding on the basis that exhibit A1D1A \nwould have been the \u201cbook\u201d kept by Ramendra, the Prosecution submits that it \nhas shown that Ramendra was in possession of 389.84g of cannabis for the \npurposes of trafficking.  Hence, the Prosecution submits that Ramendra should \nbe convicted of the second charge.58\n56 Prosecution\u2019s closing submissions at paras 15\u201319.\n57 Prosecution\u2019s closing submissions at paras 20\u201323.\n58 Prosecution\u2019s closing submissions at paras 24\u201326.\nVersion No 1: 26 Oct 2021 (10:30 hrs)\nPP v Ramendra Krishnan[2021] SGHC 242\n1331 For the third charge relating to possession of 97.46g of cannabis (20% \nof 487.3g, which is the total amount of cannabis in exhibit A1D1A), Ramendra \nadmitted that he planned to consume 20% of the \u201cbook\u201d that he would retain for \nhimself.  Again, on the basis that exhibit A1D1A would have been the book \nretained, the Prosecution submits that it has shown that Ramendra was in \npossession of that amount of cannabis, and he should thus be convicted of the \nthird charge.59\nThe defence\n32 The Defence accepts that Ramendra was in knowing possession of the \ncannabis at the time of his arrest and that he had actual knowledge that the \n\u201cbooks\u201d contained cannabis.60  The Defence accepts that Ramendra intended to \ndeliver four of the five \u201cbooks\u201d to someone in the Jalan Kayu area on Joe\u2019s \ninstructions, and to consume 20% of the last \u201cbook\u201d and sell the remainder to \nhis friends.61  The Defence also accepts the position taken by the Prosecution \nthat of the five \u201cbooks\u201d, Ramendra would have retained the \u201cbook\u201d marked as \nexhibit A1D1A for his own consumption and for selling to his friends.62  In other \nwords, the Defence accepts the Prosecution\u2019s case in relation to each of the \nelements of all three charges.  \n33 What the Defence has sought to do is to submit that, pursuant to \ns 33B(1)(a) read with s 33B(2) of the MDA, Ramendra \u201cis now able to avail \nhimself of the courier exception in relation to [the amended first charge]\u201d that \n59 Prosecution\u2019s closing submissions at paras 24\u201326.\n60 Accused\u2019s closing submissions at para 15; hearing of 11 October 2011.\n61 Accused\u2019s closing submissions at para 54; hearing of 11 October 2011.\n62 Hearing of 11 October 2011.\nVersion No 1: 26 Oct 2021 (10:30 hrs)\nPP v Ramendra Krishnan[2021] SGHC 242\n14deals with exhibits A1A1A, A1B1A, A1C1A and A1E1A.63  During the oral \nsubmissions, the Prosecution accepted Ramendra\u2019s evidence that his \ninvolvement in respect of these four \u201cbooks\u201d was to transport, send and\/or \ndeliver them to a person in Jalan Kayu, at the direction of Joe \u2013 ie that his role \nwas that of a courier.64  In fact, it was pointed out by the deputy public \nprosecutor that there was no evidence to suggest that Ramendra\u2019s role was \nanything but this.65  The Prosecution therefore did not dispute that Ramendra\u2019s \nfunction was that of a courier in relation to the four \u201cbooks\u201d that are the subject \nof the amended first charge.  Nonetheless, I should add that, strictly speaking, \nthe fact that Ramendra was a courier is not a defence to liability under the \namended first charge, but a submission that may go towards sentencing.  It \ntherefore has no bearing on my analysis as to whether Ramendra should be \nconvicted of the amended first charge.\nMy findings\n34 In light of Ramendra\u2019s unequivocal testimony, and the submissions by \nboth the Prosecution and the Defence, I find that the elements of all three \ncharges have been established beyond any reasonable doubt.\n35 For the first charge, I find that Ramendra did knowingly possess four of \nthe \u201cbooks\u201d (ie exhibits A1A1A, A1B1A, A1C1A and A1E1A) for the purpose \nof trafficking, in that he intended to deliver the drugs to someone in Jalan Kayu, \non the instructions of Joe.

The plaintiff was left with weakness and partial paralysis after the \nsurgery. This action, however, is not concerned with the surgery itself nor \nagainst the surgeon Dr David Choy. Counsel for the plaintiff, Mr VK Rai \nconfirmed at trial that the plaintiff is not pursuing any action in respect of the \nsurgery or the surgeon.\n16 March 2011\n4 The plaintiff\u2019s case in this action is built around the five visits to the \nNUH referred to in paragraph 2 above. His first visit (on 16 March 2011) was \nprompted by chest pains and various discomforts that he experienced at 5.30am. \nHis wife Sio Seok Har (\u201cSio\u201d) accompanied him to the A&E where he was \nattended by DW1, Dr Wu Pang Hung (\u201cDr Wu\u201d). The medical notes of Dr Wu \nand the nursing notes showed that the plaintiff complained of non-radiating left-\nsided chest discomfort, and that he had been having palpitations on and off for \nabout two weeks, and that he felt a lump in his throat. The notes recorded by \nDr Wu show that the symptoms were precipitated by stress at work. The notes \nrecorded by the triage nurse show that the plaintiff felt a lump in his heart (not \nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2021 (18:00 hrs)\nSoh Keng Cheang Philip v[2021] SGHC 243\nNational University Hospital (S) Pte Ltd\n3the throat) but this was not an issue at trial, and in itself, the discrepancy does \nnot affect my findings of fact.\n5 Dr Wu ordered X-ray of the chest and that did not reveal any \nabnormalities of the chest. Dr Wu then consulted his colleague, DW3, Dr Peng \nLi, a Senior Consultant on duty in the Emergency Department. She thought that \nthe chest pains might be stress related but had the plaintiff admitted overnight \nat the Extended Diagnostic Treatment Unit (\u201cEDTU\u201d) for further investigations.\n6 Later that afternoon, the plaintiff was attended by DW4, Dr Kuan Win \nSen. The evidence of Dr Kuan was that the plaintiff complained about left-sided \nchest pain occasioned by stress at work. The pain was non-radiating. It was \nrecorded by the doctor in the medical notes that the plaintiff said that he had \ntingling sensation over his right arm, but did not have any numbness or \nweakness nor any vomiting. He told the doctor that he slept with two pillows \nbecause he wanted to have proper neck support and not because of shortness of \nbreath (orthopnea). The examination showed that his neck was supple and he \nhad a full range of movement with no tenderness (pain) or deformity. \n7 The plaintiff was examined by DW2, Dr Lee Sock Koon at 9.25am the \nnext day, 17 March 2011. His chest pain had improved, and he completed a \ntreadmill test during which he ran at a maximum speed of 5.5kmph and was \nable to achieve the maximum heart rate. He was thus diagnosed as having \natypical chest pain, and discharged with a prescription for analgesic (painkiller).\nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2021 (18:00 hrs)\nSoh Keng Cheang Philip v[2021] SGHC 243\nNational University Hospital (S) Pte Ltd\n420 March 2011\n8 A few days later, on 20 March, the plaintiff had severe difficulty \nbreathing at 3am. He went alone to the A&E where he was attended by DW5, \nDr Michael Ebuna. The plaintiff complained of a recurrence of his heart \npalpitations which he said arose after an argument with his wife. The main issue \nwith Dr Ebuna was that the plaintiff claims that he had told Dr Ebuna that he \nhad numbness, tingling sensations, and pain at the back of the neck, but \nDr Ebuna did not note these down in the record. Dr Ebuna denies that the \nplaintiff had complained of those symptoms. The medical notes support \nDr Ebuna\u2019s version and Mr Rai was obliged to point out some typographical \nerrors in Dr Ebuna\u2019s notes as well as a contradiction in which the notes initially \nstated that the patient had no known drug allergies, but further down the notes \nit was recorded that the plaintiff is allergic to ampicillin. Counsel therefore put \nto Dr Ebuna that the notes did not show the plaintiff\u2019s complaints about neck \npain and numbness because Dr Ebuna did not record them because he recorded \nhis notes only at the last two minutes of the consultation, as the electronic \nmedical records system was down during the consultation and was only up \nduring the last two minutes of the consultation. Dr Ebuna denies counsel\u2019s \ncharge.\n9 The plaintiff says that he \u201cfelt something was amiss\u201d after the two visits \nto the A&E because he felt numbness, tingling sensations, and weakness in his \nlimbs, and so he went to a polyclinic on 4 April 2011 to consult the doctor there. \nHe was given a referral by the doctor on duty to see a specialist in the \nDepartment of Neurology at NUH. The appointment was classified as \u201croutine\u201d \nand fixed for 24 May 2011. \nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2021 (18:00 hrs)\nSoh Keng Cheang Philip v[2021] SGHC 243\nNational University Hospital (S) Pte Ltd\n510 Although the plaintiff says that he \u201cfelt something was amiss\u201d as the \nreason for going to the polyclinic, the clinic\u2019s medical notes show that his \ncomplaint was mainly for pain in the neck, tingling sensations, and that he was \n\u201cconcerned about heart++\u201d. The doctor\u2019s examination found \u201cmild tenderness \nover lower cervical spine with reduced flexion\u201d but no weakness in the limbs \nwhich were found to have \u201cfull power\u201d.\n11 About a month later, on 7 May 2011, the plaintiff had breathing \ndifficulties and went to the Central 24-HR Clinic where he was told by the \ndoctor that he had \u201cnerve dystrophy\u201d and that it was a condition that could \ndeteriorate rapidly. He told the doctor that he had an appointment at the \nDepartment of Neurology on 24 May, and the doctor told him that he should go. \nThe plaintiff decided to ask for the appointment to be brought forward to \n20 May 2011.\n13 May 2011\n12 The plaintiff says that a week before the new appointment at the NUH, \nhe felt his limbs weakened and his walking became wobbly and unstable while \nhe was on his way to work. He was unable to type and was told by his supervisor \nto resign from his job on the spot because of his physical condition, which he \ndid. The reason and circumstances for his resignation was not verified, but I can \naccept that the plaintiff resigned from his job.\n13 In the afternoon of 13 May 2011, the plaintiff went back to the A&E of \nNUH and was attended by Dr Ranjeev Kumar. He told Dr Ranjeev that he \npreviously saw Dr Ebuna and had told Dr Ebuna that he was unable to dress \nhimself, ride a bicycle, or even hold utensils. He told Dr Ranjeev that he had \nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2021 (18:00 hrs)\nSoh Keng Cheang Philip v[2021] SGHC 243\nNational University Hospital (S) Pte Ltd\n6tingling sensations in the right hand from March 2011, and in the left hand that \nfirst occurred on the day itself. He said that there were no feelings of numbness.\n14  Dr Ranjeev testified that on examination, he found the plaintiff\u2019s neck \nto be supple with no cervical tenderness. He found the power and tone of the \nupper limbs to be normal as were the lower limbs, and the gait was steady. \nDr Ranjeev concluded that the plaintiff might have \u201caltered sensation of the \nupper limbs\u201d with a need to rule out myelopathy. An x-ray was done that \nshowed no fracture or dislocation but there were degenerative changes to the C5 \nto C7 cervical discs which seemed to be due to normal wear and tear. \nNonetheless, Dr Ranjeev discussed the plaintiff\u2019s condition with Dr Peng and \nthe two doctors concluded that the plaintiff\u2019s condition might be due to \u201ccervical \nradiculopathy\u201d (which is a condition in which the nerve is compressed) as that \nwould be consistent with the radiological results. As there was no indication of \nurgency, as there was no objective acute deterioration observed, Dr Ranjeev \nadvised the plaintiff to keep his appointment at the Department of Neurology.\n15 Three days later, on 16 May 2011, the plaintiff consulted his psychiatrist \nPW8, Dr Roger Ho with the same complaints, but added that he had a cramping \npain in his lower back. Dr Ho wrote a memo for the plaintiff to show the \nneurologist, stating that he (Dr Ho) suspected peripheral neuropathy and \nsuggested that a nerve conduction test be performed. Again, as there seemed to \nbe no urgency, there was no suggestion for a change of the appointment at the \nDepartment of Neurology.\nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2021 (18:00 hrs)\nSoh Keng Cheang Philip v[2021] SGHC 243\nNational University Hospital (S) Pte Ltd\n720 May 2011\n16 The patient on his own, requested the appointment at the Department of \nNeurology be brought forward from 24 May to 20 May, when he was seen by \nDW8, Dr Leonard Yeo. The plaintiff complained of tingling sensation and \nnumbness, and had difficulty dressing himself. He did not complain of neck \npain. After examining the plaintiff and perusing the results of clinical tests, \nDr Yeo made the provisional diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy. Dr Yeo \ntestified that he did not think that the plaintiff had \u201ccervical spondylosis with \nmyelopathy\u201d because he did not exhibit symptoms typical of that condition. He \narranged for the plaintiff to undergo a neurophysiological test on 27 May 2011, \nand for a follow-up examination on 3 June 2011. Dr Yeo noted that the plaintiff \nhad normal muscle power except for a \u201cvery mild proximal weakness in the \nlegs\u201d, he therefore did not think that the plaintiff required hospitalisation on \n20 May. He noted that there was no acute decline of the plaintiff\u2019s conditions, \nas he complained of the same symptoms, namely tingling and weakness, on both \nvisits dated 13 May and 20 May 2011. Further tests were ordered with a follow-\nup on 27 May 2011. However, the plaintiff decided to return to NUH on 24 May \n2011, a few days before the appointment.\n24 May 2011\n17 On 24 May 2011, the plaintiff experienced another episode of breathing \ndifficulties and so he went to the NUH A&E, accompanied by Sio. The plaintiff \nwas seen by DW2, Dr Lee Sock Koon. Although Dr Lee found that the plaintiff \nhad full power in all four limbs, he admitted the plaintiff reported a worsening \nof his condition. Dr Lee was of the view that the plaintiff probably had \nperipheral neuropathy, but had in any event decided to admit the plaintiff into \nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2021 (18:00 hrs)\nSoh Keng Cheang Philip v[2021] SGHC 243\nNational University Hospital (S) Pte Ltd\n8the Department of Neurology so that a specialist neurologist could attend to \nhim.\n18 The plaintiff was reviewed at 8.50am on 25 May 2011 by DW9, \nDr Rahul. On examination, Dr Rahul found that the plaintiff had \u201ca lack of co-\nordination\u201d and \u201cunable to tandem gait\u201d which he could do, just a few days \nbefore, on 20 May 2011. It appeared that on 25 May, the plaintiff had exhibited \nmore extensive symptoms. Dr Rahul\u2019s working diagnosis was that of cervical \nmyelopathy. An MRI scan was thus carried out on the plaintiff on 26 May 2011. \nIt showed \u201cossification and thickening of the posterior longitudinal ligament \nand osteophytic disc complex with significant canal stenosis and cord \nimpingement from C3\u20134 to C5\u20136 level\u201d. \n19 The plaintiff was therefore referred to the neurosurgery team led by \nDr Chou Ning. Upon advice the plaintiff underwent a \u201ccervical decompression \nlaminectomy from C3 to C6\u201d levels of the vertebrae on 3 June 2011. The \nplaintiff was eventually discharged from NUH on 27 June and transferred to the \nTan Tock Seng Hospital for rehabilitation. The plaintiff claims that he was left \nseverely immobilised after the surgery. Ordinarily, a plaintiff ought to have \npleaded the injury and damage suffered by him before particulars of negligence \nmight be levied against the defendant. The statement of claim pleaded that his \nmotor and sensory functions have been adversely affected, his pain and \nsuffering was prolonged, and his prognosis was poor.\n20 Against the background of the above facts, with some other allegations \nby the plaintiff (which I will refer shortly), the plaintiff claims that the NUH \nwas negligent. The negligence against the defendant was directed against the \nfailure by the A&E doctors and the doctors at the Department of Neurology for \nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2021 (18:00 hrs)\nSoh Keng Cheang Philip v[2021] SGHC 243\nNational University Hospital (S) Pte Ltd\n9not diagnosing his illness correctly. Under this claim, he alleges that the doctors \ndid not investigate his symptoms and consider alternative diagnosis, that they \ndid not examine him physically properly, and to refer him to the appropriate \nspecialist for further investigations.\n21 As to his loss and damage, the plaintiff claims that his condition would \nhave been diagnosed earlier and he would have had \u201ca better prognosis\u201d. He \nsays that the doctors\u2019 negligence caused him to suffer increased and chronic \npain, and he relies on the evidence of his expert, PW9 - Dr Keith Goh Yu-Ching \n(\u201cDr Goh\u201d).\n22 The plaintiff first consulted Dr Goh on 17 June 2013, two years after his \nsurgery on 3 June 2011. Dr Goh reported in his specialist medical report of \n22 June 2018 that the plaintiff\u2019s main complaints were \n(a) chronic neck pain \n(b) stiffness and weakness of the muscles of the arms and legs, \nespecially the fingers of his right hand, and right leg \n(c) generalized numbness and \u2018tingling\u2019 sensations, especially of the \nright arm \n(d) generalized muscle spasms affecting the whole body \n(e) unsteady gait, requiring a walking stick \n(f) chronic constipation \n(g) sexual (erectile) dysfunction.\nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2021 (18:00 hrs)\nSoh Keng Cheang Philip v[2021] SGHC 243\nNational University Hospital (S) Pte Ltd\n10Dr Goh also noted that the plaintiff, then 54, suffered from schizophrenia since \nhe was 20 years old, and had been having seizures since 2016.\n23 Dr Goh recorded the plaintiff as saying that his symptoms began in \nMarch 2011 with neck pains, numbness, and tingling sensations especially of \nthe arms and hands, and weakness of the arms and legs. Dr Goh also noted that \nthe plaintiff had surgery on the C3\u2013C6 levels of the cervical spine on 3 June \n2011 and that an MRI of the spine after the surgery showed \u201cspinal cord oedema \nand a possible contusion at the C4\u2013C5 level\u201d.\n24 Dr Goh\u2019s evidence in support of the plaintiff\u2019s case was that the \ndiagnosis of \u201cSpondylosis, Myelopathy or Radiculopathy, was not made at the \ntime of his first two visits to the Emergency Department on 16 March 2011 and \n20 March 2011\u201d. He is of the opinion that this diagnosis was eventually made \non 13 May 2011. He is of the opinion that \u201c[a] correct diagnosis at the first visit \nto the Emergency Department on 16 March 2011 could have resulted in earlier \ntreatment, and hence improved outcome\u201d, compared to his present clinical \ncondition. He testified that urgent referral on 13 May 2011 could also have \nresulted in earlier treatment and hence improved outcome. \n25 Two preliminary points should be made regarding Dr Goh\u2019s testimony \nnow, and the crux of his evidence later, below. First, Dr Goh was presented as \nthe plaintiff\u2019s expert, but his credentials as an expert was not presented to the \ncourt until after the trial was over. Secondly, Mr V K Rai, counsel for the \nplaintiff, submitted a further report of Dr Goh, dated 29 July 2021 on the last \nday of the trial when the evidence had concluded. I am ignoring this report \nbecause the introduction of irrelevant evidence from Dr Goh had been denied at \nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2021 (18:00 hrs)\nSoh Keng Cheang Philip v[2021] SGHC 243\nNational University Hospital (S) Pte Ltd\n11trial. This further report dated the day of Dr Goh\u2019s testimony in court is therefore \nan attempt to introduce evidence that I had ruled irrelevant and inappropriate.\n26 I will return to Dr Goh\u2019s main evidence after I deal with the crux of the \nplaintiff\u2019s case. The plaintiff had his surgery on 3 June 2011, an important event \nand one that I shall have to return to shortly, but for the moment, that marks the \npoint where the plaintiff\u2019s claims against the defendant ends because his basic \nclaim is that had the defendant\u2019s doctors diagnosed his condition correctly, he \nwould have a better prognosis and not suffer the pain he has.\n27 The entirety of the plaintiff\u2019s claim is based on his claims that the \ncondition that he had that ultimately led to his surgery was peripheral \nneuropathy. I had set out each of the instances that the plaintiff was attended by \nthe doctors from the NUH. The evidence on the whole \u2014 and that includes the \nplaintiff\u2019s own evidence \u2014 does not support the plaintiff\u2019s claims. The four \nimportant dates were 16 March, 20 March, 13 May, and 20 May 2011. \n28 On the first two dates the plaintiff woke up in the early morning (before \ndawn) in a state of alarm because he thought he might be having heart problems. \nThat was what took him to the A&E at NUH. The medical and nursing notes all \nbear the defendant\u2019s account that the plaintiff\u2019s complaint on those dates related \nto his chest pains. The medical notes specifically recorded that there were no \nweakness or numbness of the limbs; this was done pursuant to Dr Wu\u2019s \nscreening of the plaintiff for neurological condition. Since the complaint \nconcerned chest pains, the plaintiff was admitted to the NUH\u2019s EDTU for \nfurther examination relating to his complaint. It was then that the plaintiff \nmentioned a tingling sensation over his right upper limb, but he said that he did \nnot have any numbness or weakness in the limbs, and that he did not have any \nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2021 (18:00 hrs)\nSoh Keng Cheang Philip v[2021] SGHC 243\nNational University Hospital (S) Pte Ltd\n12neck pain. He successfully completed the treadmill test in the EDTU, which \nlasted seven minutes and 24 seconds, and included him running on the treadmill. \nWhen the doctors were satisfied that there was no sufficient cause for concern, \nhe was discharged and given an appointment to see a cardiologist.\n29 On the second date, 20 March 2011, the plaintiff returned to the A&E of \nNUH after having heart palpitations. He was examined by Dr Ebuna, who \ndischarged the plaintiff after satisfying himself that there was no cause for \nconcern of any critical cardiac problems. There was some careless note-taking \nby Dr Ebuna in this instance, but considering them as a whole, I am of the view \nthat the errors do not support the plaintiff\u2019s claim that he had informed Dr Ebuna \nof sufficient neurological symptoms to warrant a fuller neurological \nexamination and diagnosis.\n30 For instance, Mr Rai submitted that the recording that the plaintiff had \nno known drug allergy was contradicted by the entry on another page of the \nnotes that the plaintiff was allergic to ampicillin. I am of the view that this was \na sloppiness arising from not correcting the previous entry after a later \ninformation was received, but it does not indicate that the plaintiff had told \nDr Ebuna the neurological symptoms that would have led to a full neurological \nexamination. The focus during this visit was, like the first, on the acute chest \npains. The plaintiff\u2019s complaints of chest pain were corroborated by Dr Ho\u2019s \nclinical documentation on 21 March 2011 as well. Dr Ho, likewise, did not note \nany symptoms the plaintiff allegedly suffered. Dr Ho noted that the plaintiff was \nnot at fall risk and was not in pain. \n31 The next two visits, namely, 13 May and 20 May were the ones that \nconcerned more neurological than cardiac complaints. The plaintiff was \nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2021 (18:00 hrs)\nSoh Keng Cheang Philip v[2021] SGHC 243\nNational University Hospital (S) Pte Ltd\n13examined by Dr Ranjeev specifically for the symptoms of tingling sensation, \nweakness, and some pain. Dr Ranjeev then consulted Dr Peng and they \nconcluded that the plaintiff might have cervical radiculopathy, but there were \nno signs of acute deterioration. Dr Ranjeev therefore advised the plaintiff to \nkeep his appointment at the Department of Neurology scheduled for 20 May \n2011, and as mentioned, the plaintiff did not wait till 27 May but returned on \n24 May when he was admitted. He was examined by Dr Rahul on 25 May. On \nreview the next day after a Nerve Conduction Study, the plaintiff was observed \nto be feeling well and comfortable. He had no new complaints but still \ncomplained of weakness in the limbs although he said they were not worsening. \nAn MRI scan was done and the plaintiff reviewed by the surgical team on \n28 May 2011, and surgery was performed about a week later, on 3 June 2011.\n32 The plaintiff\u2019s first two visits to the A&E were primarily because of his \nconcern over his heart palpitations. In retrospect, he probably had cervical \nmyelopathy then but the symptoms were minor and not sufficient to alarm him. \nThe condition was noted to have been a chronic one, rather than an acute \ncondition that required immediate treatment. The A&E doctors had kept \ncontemporaneous notes, none of which shows sufficient neurological \ncomplaints for the emergency doctors to respond to. The A&E department\u2019s \nprimary role as the defendant\u2019s experts explain, is to respond to emergencies \nand that means all life-threatening conditions or any dangerous situations that \nrequire immediate or prompt action. DW11 - Associate Professor Mohan \nTiruchittampalam, an emergency physician was called as the first of two experts \nby the defendant. He has an impressive credential in this field of practice, and \nin his report, he expressed the view that the emergency doctors at the A&E had \nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2021 (18:00 hrs)\nSoh Keng Cheang Philip v[2021] SGHC 243\nNational University Hospital (S) Pte Ltd\n14acted appropriately. His reasons are lucidly set out in his report and not shaken \nunder cross-examination.\n33 I agree with A\/Professor Mohan that the evidence does not indicate that \nthe emergency doctors in March 2011 had reason to exclude cervical \nmyelopathy at that stage. There were, in A\/Professor Mohan\u2019s words, \u201cno red \nflag signs\u201d even as at 20 May 2011. One of the red flags would have been \nobjective weakness or sensory disturbance, but Dr Ranjeev, after performing a \nphysical examination, found no such objective loss in power or function. I \naccept his view that \u201cthere were no objective findings on physical examination \nto indicate an urgent MRI or neurosurgical consult\u201d although he thought that \nimmediate admission to the neurology department for further investigations \nwould have been appropriate. The plaintiff was admitted on 24 May 2011. I am \nof the view that there was no undue delay. A\/Professor Mohan as well as \nDW12 - Associate Professor Umapathi Thirugnanam, a senior consultant \nneurologist with the National Neurology Institute, are of the opinion that there \nwas no undue delay in diagnosing the plaintiff\u2019s condition. I accept their \nopinions. Surgery was performed soon after the diagnosis but there is no \nevidence that the plaintiff had to have that surgery at that time, nor is there \nevidence that surgery was the only option although the evidence suggests that \nsurgery would be the best solution in most cases. When the surgery should be \nperformed is a matter for the surgeon and the patient. No evidence was led as to \nwhat the surgeon had advised the plaintiff. \n34 A\/Professor Umapathi is firmly of the view that the outcome of the \nsurgery was not due to a delay in the treatment. A\/Professor Umapathi is of the \nview that the plaintiff\u2019s poor prognosis (oedema) after his surgery is a known \nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2021 (18:00 hrs)\nSoh Keng Cheang Philip v[2021] SGHC 243\nNational University Hospital (S) Pte Ltd\n15complication after such surgery. Although the plaintiff\u2019s case is that the delay \nin diagnosis caused his present condition, there is no evidence to show in what \nway the delay led to it. There is nothing to suggest that the outcome of the \nsurgery would have been any different had it been performed two months \nearlier. A\/Professor Umapathi reports that he disagrees \u201cthat the outcome was \ndue to any \u2018delay\u2019 in the treatment. The disease had been present for a while and \nthe deficits were mild. So the described \u2018delay\u2019 would not have impacted on the \noutcome significantly.\u201d\n35 Another complaint raised by Mr Rai is that the notes taken by the A&E \ndoctors, namely Dr Ebuna and Dr Wu, were not sufficiently contemporaneous. \nA\/Professor Mohan testified that the notes were adequate in spite of persistent \nquestioning by Mr Rai. A\/Professor Mohan maintains that it is not only \nacceptable but recommended that the examining doctor records his notes after \nthe examination of the patient is over. Mr Rai suggests that recording the notes \nin that way is not sufficiently contemporaneous because one should be writing \ndown the notes as one listens, instead of recording after the complaints have \nbeen elicited. I do not think that that way of recording in this case had led to a \nloss of information, or as Mr Rai suggests, an incomplete record. As \nA\/Professor Mohan testified, and I accept, that it might be bad bedside manners \nfor doctors to be speaking to the patient and recording notes in a computer at \nthe same time. They should focus on talking to the patient, conducting physical \nexamination and then enter their clinical notes. Unlike a judge or a lawyer who \nmight take notes while the others are speaking, a doctor needs to conduct \nphysical examination of the patient, and engage the patient, rather than tapping \naway at the keyboard. Moreover, aside from Dr Ebuna and Dr Wu, the absence \nof any contemporaneous notes regarding any serious signs of a neurological \nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2021 (18:00 hrs)\nSoh Keng Cheang Philip v[2021] SGHC 243\nNational University Hospital (S) Pte Ltd\n16disorder is not peculiar to one doctor but the notes of all the doctors involved in \nthe plaintiff\u2019s visits to the A&E were consistently similar in this regard.\n36 Dr Goh\u2019s evidence is based on his examination of the plaintiff a couple \nof years after the event, and on the medical and nursing notes recorded by others, \nas did the defendants\u2019 experts. As it turned out, there were some notes that \nDr Goh had not seen before he wrote his expert report. Mr Rai and Miss Kuah \nhave taken all the experts through every page of the nursing and medical notes. \nThose notes represent the contemporaneous record of the events. Mr Rai\u2019s idea \nthat a note is contemporaneous only if it were written as the doctor examines \nthe patient is an unreasonable view if only because in many situations, it would \nbe a physical impossibility. Mr Rai rejects the evidence that the notes as \ncontemporaneous because they were written about two minutes after the \nphysical examination of the patient. I must respectfully reject this view.\n37 The notes were written by different doctors (and nurses) on different \noccasions. Together, they support the conclusion that the plaintiff probably had \ndeveloped cervical myelopathy in March 2011 but in a mild form. It was not the \ncondition that worried him when he visited the A&E in March 2011. He must \nhave felt his symptoms of tingling sensation and mild numbness in his May \nvisits to the NUH but the doctors examined him and found the symptoms \ninsufficiently severe to warrant an immediate admission. I accept that on the \nevidence, the appointment for him to be examined by the neurologist on 20 May \n2011 was not an unreasonable delay.\n38 Hospitals, both private and public, have limited resources and time. How \nthey allocate them to a patient depends on the problem at hand, and in this case, \nthe examining doctors were of the view that the clinical evidence did not warrant \nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2021 (18:00 hrs)\nSoh Keng Cheang Philip v[2021] SGHC 243\nNational University Hospital (S) Pte Ltd\n17an immediate hospitalisation for the plaintiff. I accept the evidence of \nA\/Professor Mohan and A\/Professor Umapathi that the appointments fixed were \nreasonable in this case. In assessing the duty of care owed by doctors in an A&E \ncontext, the court held in Noor Azlin bte Abdul Rahman v Changi General \nHospital Pte Ltd and others [2019] 3 SLR 1063 at [85] that it is reasonable for \nA&E doctors to adopt a specific approach to treatment, ie, to be primarily \nconcerned with diagnosing the treating the immediate cause of a patient\u2019s acute \ndeterioration in health rather than providing a general health screening of the \npatient. A&E doctors are still expected to make reasonable enquiries, take a \nhistory from the patient, conduct basic investigations and take reasonable care \nin reaching their diagnosis, especially when diagnosing and treating a patient\u2019s \npresenting complaint. When doctors taking that approach reasonably suspect \nthat the patient has underlying health problems they are unable to fully \ninvestigate, they should send the patient or advise the patient to go for follow-\nup consultations. In this case, I am satisfied that the doctors had made \nreasonable enquiries and taken the plaintiff\u2019s medical history and found no life-\nthreatening or acute conditions that called for immediate attention. They \nreasonably referred the plaintiff to have a follow-up appointment with the \nDepartment of Neurology. \n39 Although the plaintiff and Dr Goh assert that the delay in the surgery \nhad caused his present condition, they have not explained how the surgery, if \nperformed a month or two earlier would have yielded better results. The plaintiff \ndid not call any evidence to the effect that the surgery should have been done in \nMarch or April 2011. He also did not call his surgeon to testify as to whether \nthere were other options besides surgery, whether the surgery could be deferred \npending other alternative treatment, and whether the surgery itself led to the \nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2021 (18:00 hrs)\nSoh Keng Cheang Philip v[2021] SGHC 243\nNational University Hospital (S) Pte Ltd\n18present condition. It was A\/Professor Umapathi who testified that the plaintiff\u2019s \ncondition was a known complication of this sort of surgery.\n40 I find that the plaintiff\u2019s evidence-in-chief to be incongruous with the \nmedical notes. It is also noted that the plaintiff also visited the Clementi \nPolyclinic on 4 April 2011, and to the Central 24-HR Clinic on 7 May 2011. On \nneither occasion did the doctors note that he complained of symptoms of \nweakness and inability to walk steadily and etc, and yet he maintained at trial \nthat he had told the doctors, Dr Seet and Dr Lee, that he had such symptoms. \nThere is no record to show that the plaintiff had complained about weakness, \npain, and any functional difficulties from 13 March to 24 May 2011. In the \nresult, there is no evidence that supports his claim that the NUH doctors were \nnegligent in their management of his complaints in any of the visits from \n13 March to 24 May 2011. It seems to me that the plaintiff was scarred by his \nown discontent and had closed his mind to a more reasonable appraisal of his \ncase.\n41 Mr Rai is on record as having expressed the sentiment, on a couple of \noccasions, that he was engaged as counsel only close to trial. Nothing he said \nshould reflect darkly on the plaintiff\u2019s previous counsel Mr Fong Wei Li \nbecause now that I have received and considered the evidence, I am of the view \nthat Mr Fong did what was right. It cannot therefore be said that, by that same \ntoken, that Mr Rai is wrong, because the tokens may not be the same after all. \nWhat I can gather from this trial, is that Mr Rai had argued the plaintiff\u2019s case \ncomprehensively, although not persuasively. \n42 Shortly after the trial ended, the plaintiff sent letters to the court and to \ncounsel for the defendant, airing his private grievances against Mr Rai. Those \nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2021 (18:00 hrs)\nSoh Keng Cheang Philip v[2021] SGHC 243\nNational University Hospital (S) Pte Ltd\n19matters do not concern the defendant, and are not relevant to my consideration \nof the merits of this case. The letters are inappropriately copied to the defendant \nand the court, but seeing that they were probably written without advice, I will \nnot take this up further.\n43 For the reasons above, I am of the opinion that the plaintiff has not \nproved his case against the defendant. His claim is therefore dismissed with \ncosts. I will hear arguments on costs if parties are not able to agree costs between \nthemselves.\n     - Sgd -\nChoo Han Teck\nJudge of the High Court\nVijay Kumar Rai, Gursharn Gill Singh s\/o Amar Singh and Jasleen \nKaur (Arbiters Inc Law Corporation) for the plaintiff;\nKuah Boon Theng SC, Samantha Oei Jia Hsia and Cheong Le Yue \nJess (Legal Clinic LLC) for the defendant;\nLim Wan Ting Tracia and Tay Kai Lin Brenda (Charles Lin LLC) \n(watching brief).\nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2021 (18:00 hrs)"}

As it turned out, Westpac did not negotiate the LCs, presumably because BComm Tokyo subsequently rejected the documents as being non-compliant (see [12] below). In these circumstances, Westpac HK only acted as a \u201ccollecting bank\u201d in transmitting and presenting the documents to BComm Tokyo on Sinopec SG\u2019s behalf and as Sinopec SG\u2019s agent (see Jack at para 7.2). 14', '9\\u2003Notwithstanding that the documents were transmitted by Westpac HK to BComm Tokyo, and it was at BComm Tokyo where the documents were examined and found to be discrepant, the place where the documents were presented under the LCs would still be Westpac HK, ie, Hong Kong. This is so, for two reasons:', '(a)\\u2003Art. 6(d)(ii) of the UCP 600 provides that the place for presentation of documents under a letter of credit is the bank at which the credit is available. In this case, since the LCs were available at any bank by negotiation, Sinopec SG would have been authorised by the terms of the credit to present documents at any bank of its choice (see Grains at [50]), in addition to the issuing bank (see Art. 6(d)(ii) of the UCP 600). The place of presentation would therefore be any bank where Sinopec SG chose to present its documents, in this case, Westpac HK.', '(b)\\u2003The liability of the issuing bank under Art. 7(a) of the UCP 600 is engaged as long as the beneficiary makes a valid and complying presentation to a bank at which the credit is available, irrespective of whether that bank has agreed to honour or negotiate a complying presentation (Grains at [54]-[55(a)]). It is also the presentation at that bank that is the point of reference for determining the time at which the presentation of documents under the credit was made (Grains at [51]). In this case, if the documents presented were compliant, it would have been the Presentation at Westpac HK (and not any subsequent receipt of documents by BComm Tokyo) that would have rendered BComm liable under the LCs.

These allegations rest largely on what it had been informed of by officers of the Shanghai PSB at a meeting on 24 September 2019 (\u201cthe 24 Sep Meeting\u201d). 56', 'BComm\u2019s account of that meeting is that the officers said that the Cargo (to which the BLs and the Sale Contracts relate) had been the subject of previous contracts of sale between Sinopec SG and entities within the Zhong Tuo Group (\u201cthe Alleged Prior Contracts\u201d). 57', 'The Cargo had also been discharged to the respective Zhong Tuo Group entities in May and June 2019 pursuant to Sinopec SG\u2019s performance of its obligations as seller under the Alleged Prior Contracts. 58', '28\\u2003However, by July 2019, it became clear that the Zhong Tuo Group had fallen into financial difficulty, and that Sinopec SG would not be able to recover any payment for the Cargo from the Zhong Tuo Group. 59', 'Accordingly, Sinopec SG decided to alter the documentation for the Alleged Prior Contracts into a sequence of deals involving Sinopec SG, SIH and HKZT, where Sinopec SG and SIH entered into the Sale Contracts, while SIH entered into the Downstream Contracts with HKZT. 60', '29\\u2003The alleged fraud therefore stemmed from how the Sale Contracts had been contrived by Sinopec SG as a means of obtaining payment (by way of letters of credit) for the Cargo that Sinopec SG had already sold and released to the Zhong Tuo Group entities under the Alleged Prior Contracts, and which it no longer had title to. 61', 'According to BComm, Sinopec SG was seeking to sell the Cargo and obtain payment for it twice - first from the Zhong Tuo Group entities, and when it failed to do so, from BComm (as an issuer of the LCs on the application of SIH). 62', 'Apparently, the officers of the Shanghai PSB had also stated at the 24 Sep Meeting that they had advised Sinopec SG not to take legal action against BComm to claim compensation under the LCs. 63', '30\\u2003Sinopec SG disputes BComm\u2019s allegations of fraud. It provides a very different characterisation of the Sale Contracts. It explains that it had first purchased the Cargo from suppliers (\u201cthe Supply Contracts\u201d) on behalf of Shanghai Jinshan. 64', 'In doing so, Sinopec SG was only acting as a \u201ccredit facilitator\u201d on behalf of Shanghai Jinshan, given that Shanghai Jinshan did not have banking facilities that allowed it to apply for letters of credit, which were the prescribed mode of payment under the Supply Contracts. 65', '31\\u2003There were four of these Supply Contracts: 66', 'one was dated 25 March 2019 (for the shipment on board the Southern Jaguar originating from Oman), 67', 'another was dated 19 April 2019 (for the shipment on board the Korea Victory originating from South Korea), 68', 'and the remaining two were dated 21 May 2019 (for each of the two shipments on board the Fairchem Forte originating from Georgia, USA). 69', 'The Cargo was in turn to be sold to Sinopec Jiangsu pursuant to \u201cExport Contracts\u201d entered into between Sinopec SG and Sinopec Jiangsu. 70', 'While the Export Contracts have been formalised in writing, they were never signed due to an administrative oversight. 71', 'In its affidavits, Sinopec SG exhibited four of these Export Contracts, which it appears (given the country of origin of the Paraxylene specified in each of these contracts) correspond to each of the Supply Contracts. According to the dates on these Export Contracts, it appears that, save for one of them, they were all formalised shortly after the corresponding Supply Contract was entered into. 72', '32\\u2003According to Sinopec SG, the LOIs (against which the Discharge took place) had been issued \u201con the instructions of Sinopec Jiangsu \u2026 [as] the buyer of [the Cargo] under the Export Contracts\u201d. 73', 'These LOIs were dated 30 April 2019 (in respect of the shipment on board the Korea Victory), 74', '14 May 2019 (in respect of the shipment on board the Southern Jaguar), 75', 'and 27 May 2019 (in respect of the shipments on board the Fairchem Forte). 76', 'While not stated in explicit terms, this can only mean that the Discharge had taken place on the instructions of Sinopec Jiangsu at around the relevant times when the respective LOIs were issued.', '33\\u2003Some two months after the Export Contracts had been entered into, Sinopec Jiangsu informed Sinopec SG that the Export Contracts were to be \u201cnovated\u201d to the end receivers of the Cargo, HKZT and HZHS, ie, the Zhong Tuo Group entities (see [12] above). 77', 'According to the dates of the email correspondence apparently recording these instructions from Sinopec Jiangsu, the novation would have taken place on or around 27 June 2019. 78', 'I should add that it is not possible to pinpoint the precise date on which the novation took place and the terms on which it occurred because Sinopec SG has thus far not disclosed all the documents in relation to the novation.', '34\\u2003A \u201cnovation\u201d refers to the process by which the contract between the original contracting parties is discharged through mutual consent and substituted with a new contract between the same parties to the original contract or between different parties (Fairview Developments Pte Ltd v Ong & Ong Pte Ltd and another appeal [2014] 2 SLR 318 at [46]). As such, the expected result of the novation in this case would have been the replacement of Sinopec Jiangsu by the respective Zhong Tuo Group entities as a party to each of the novated Export Contracts. However, it appears that never happened because SIH entered the picture to act as a credit facilitator for the Zhong Tuo Group entities, which had to make payment for the Cargo, but which did not have access to banking facilities that allowed them to apply for letters of credit to do so. Under this arrangement, SIH was to apply for letters of credit (ie, the LCs) in favour of Sinopec SG to enable the Zhong Tuo Group entities to make payment for the Cargo 79', 'and thereby take on the credit risk of the Zhong Tuo Group entities.', '35\\u2003According to Sinopec SG, the Sale Contracts were executed for this very purpose. 80', 'Sinopec SG also states that it had only been aware that SIH was acting as a credit facilitator and expected that SIH would directly or indirectly receive payment from the Zhong Tuo Group for performing this role, and then use such funds to reimburse BComm Tokyo, which issued the LCs. 81', 'It will therefore appear that, at the time when the Sale Contracts were entered into, Sinopec SG was not aware of any precise arrangements relating to the Cargo between SIH and the Zhong Tuo Group, such as the Downstream Contracts.', '36\\u2003Therefore, the effect of the novation was the interposition of a set of back-to-back contracts: the Sale Contracts between Sinopec SG and SIH, and some other contractual arrangement between SIH and the Zhong Tuo Group, the precise details of which Sinopec SG was not aware of but under which it expected SIH to obtain reimbursement for acting as a credit facilitator. Hence, Sinopec SG\u2019s position is that it has never been a party to any contract relating to the Cargo with the Zhong Tuo Group. 82', 'Prior to the novation, the only such contract to which it had been a party were the Export Contracts with Sinopec Jiangsu. Following the novation, Sinopec SG was a party to the Sale Contracts with SIH.', '37\\u2003Sinopec SG says that SIH (by virtue of its role as a \u201ccredit facilitator\u201d) would have known, at the time of entering into the Sale Contracts, that the Cargo had already been discharged in May and June 2019. 83', 'In particular, it says cl 11 of the Sale Contracts, which specified the delivery dates as \u201cANY [APRIL 2019] ARRIVAL\u201d, would have made that clear. 84', 'Otherwise, SIH would not have requested that the LCs contain the Additional Condition. 85', 'Sinopec SG also says that, in light of SIH\u2019s request for the Additional Condition, and the fact that BComm Tokyo had been provided with copies of the Sale Contracts by SIH when it applied for the LCs, 86', 'and so would have had sight of cl 11, BComm would also have known, or ought to have known, that the Cargo had already been discharged at the time when it agreed to issue the LCs. 87', '38\\u2003Responding to that contention, BComm says that SIH had been in the dark as to the whereabouts of the Cargo from the time when it applied for the LCs with BComm Tokyo. 88', 'BComm also denies that it knew or ought to have known that the Cargo had been discharged, 89', 'presumably from the time when the LCs were issued, since BComm\u2019s knowledge would have been limited to whatever the applicant for the LCs (SIH) provided BComm Tokyo with. Also, BComm says that cl 11 of the Sale Contracts cannot impute SIH with the knowledge that the Cargo had already been discharged to HKZT or HZHS. 90', 'Further, BComm also says that the inclusion of the Additional Condition as a term of the LCs only shows that BComm Tokyo could accept bills of lading issued prior to the issuance date of the LCs, but it cannot impute BComm with the knowledge that the Cargo had already been discharged prior to the issuance of the LCs. 91', '39\\u2003BComm also refers to a letter provided by SIH to BComm Tokyo dated 26 May 2021 (\u201cthe SIH 26 May Letter\u201d), in which SIH claimed that it did not know, at the time of entering into the Sale Contracts, that: (a) Sinopec SG and HKZT had previously entered into separate sale contracts relating to the Cargo; and (b) the Cargo under the Sale Contracts had been discharged in May and June 2019. 92', 'Sinopec SG disputes the authenticity of the SIH 26 May Letter, 93', 'but also claims its contents showed that SIH knew that it was acting as a credit facilitator. 94', '40\\u2003From the parties\u2019 respective cases, it appears to me that BComm and Sinopec SG are in contention over two main issues. First, what were the Sale Contracts for? BComm says that the contracts involved the physical sale and purchase of the Cargo, and that SIH was not acting as a \u201ccredit facilitator\u201d as Sinopec SG claims. 95', 'On the other hand, Sinopec SG maintains that the Sale Contracts had been interposed in the chain transaction for the Cargo (beginning with the purchase of the Cargo under the Supply Contracts, the subsequent sale to Sinopec Jiangsu, and then the eventual novation involving SIH and the Zhong Tuo Group entities) to facilitate payment by the Zhong Tuo Group, and so the Sale Contracts per se were not meant to involve any actual dealings in goods.', '41\\u2003Second, were Sinopec SG and the respective Zhong Tuo Group entities in any contractual relationship relating to the Cargo at the time of the Discharge? Sinopec SG says they were not - the Zhong Tuo Group entities and itself only become parties to the separate back-to-back contracts with SIH in July 2019, after the Discharge had already taken place in May and June 2019. BComm alleges that Sinopec SG and the respective Zhong Tuo Group entities were in such a contractual relationship, and in particular, they had already entered into the Alleged Prior Contracts by then.', '42\\u2003BComm makes four applications in SUM 4431 and SUM 1899: (a) the Declaration Application; (b) the Stay Application; (c) the Amendment Application; and (d) the CMS Application.', '43\\u2003For the Declaration Application, BComm argues that there has been no proper service of originating process as the Writ had only been served on BComm SG. BComm argues that, for the purposes of the dispute over the LCs, BComm Tokyo, as the branch which issued the LCs, should be regarded as a distinct legal entity, and since there has been no proper service on BComm Tokyo, the Singapore courts have no jurisdiction over BComm. In reply, Sinopec SG argues that service of the Writ on BComm SG constitutes effective service on BComm, and is sufficient to found jurisdiction over it, even though it had been BComm Tokyo which issued the LCs.', '44\\u2003For the Stay Application, BComm argues that the various connecting factors - identified by reference to the governing law of the LCs, the witnesses and documentary evidence which it says is necessary to establish its fraud defence to Sinopec SG\u2019s claim in the Suit and the PRC Civil Proceedings overlapping with the Suit - all point toward jurisdictions other than Singapore, specifically, the PRC, Hong Kong and\/or Japan (collectively, the \u201cAlternative Fora\u201d), as the more appropriate forum, and so the Suit should be stayed on grounds of forum non conveniens.', '45\\u2003On the other hand, Sinopec SG argues that little if no weight should be placed on these purported connections. First, the witnesses which BComm has identified as necessary for its defence do not appear relevant, and there is no evidence as to where they are located, and whether they are unwilling to testify in Singapore. Second, it identifies the governing law of the LCs as Singapore law. But it says, even if it is Hong Kong law, as argued by BComm, that would not be a significant factor in favour of Hong Kong as the more appropriate forum, since both Singapore and Hong Kong law are similar in respect of the fraud defence to a claim under letters of credit. Third, it argues that no weight should be given to the PRC Civil Proceedings in the forum non conveniens analysis as they were commenced for strategic reasons by BComm, well after the Suit was started in Singapore. In the alternative, a stay should nevertheless be refused even if a more appropriate forum than Singapore can be identified because Sinopec SG will be deprived of a legitimate juridical advantage if the dispute were tried in the PRC, given the fact that the Shanghai Court will only apply PRC law, and the scope of the fraud defence under PRC law is broader as compared to Singapore law. It also points to substantial prejudice arising from delay and procedural differences if the dispute were tried in the PRC as reasons for refusing a stay.', '46\\u2003For the Amendment Application, BComm argues that its prayer for the CMS Application should be amended to take into account the PRC Civil Proceedings as it will allow the real controversy between parties to be determined. Sinopec SG opposes the Amendment Application on grounds that the PRC Civil Proceedings had been commenced for strategic reasons, and also because of how late in time the application was made.', '47\\u2003In the event that I am minded to grant the Amendment Application, BComm argues that the CMS Application should be allowed so that it can adduce all relevant evidence it requires for its fraud defence on the basis of findings from the PRC Criminal Proceedings and the PRC Civil Proceedings; and the Singapore courts can also have the benefit of those findings to avoid traversing the very same grounds. Sinopec SG argues that the CMS Application should not be granted because the PRC Criminal Proceedings do not appear relevant to the issues in dispute in the Suit, and also because doing so would render the Singapore proceedings otiose and result in a substantial delay in the resolution of the dispute.'"}

If the Purchase Moneys were loans (as Mdm Ho argues), Mdm Ho \n7 P-AEIC, at paras 22\u201324, 36 and 63. \n8 Plaintiff\u2019s Opening Statement, at para 2B. \n9 Defence, at para 3. \n10 Defence, at para 4. \n11 Defence, at para 8; D-AEIC, at para 18. \nVersion No 1: 04 Feb 2021 (18:31 hrs)\nTay Amy v Ho Toh Ying[2021] SGHC 25\n4would be entitled to keep the Sum as partial repayment of the loans, \nnotwithstanding that the Sum was transferred to Mdm Ho without Mdm Tay\u2019s \nconsent. On the other hand, if the Purchase Moneys were gifts (as Mdm Tay \ncontends), Mdm Ho would not be entitled to keep the Sum and she would have \nto return the Sum and the interest accrued to the pool of matrimonial assets of \nMdm Tay and CTH in the divorce proceedings. The burden lies on Mdm Tay, \nthe plaintiff in this Suit, to prove on a balance of probabilities that the Purchase \nMoneys were indeed gifts from Mdm Ho.  \n8 After hearing both parties\u2019 evidence and submissions at the trial, I am of \nthe view that Mdm Tay\u2019s claim against Mdm Ho has not been made out on a \nbalance of probabilities. Hence, Mdm Ho is not required to return the Sum \namounting to A$849,990.33 to the pool of matrimonial assets of Mdm Tay and \nCTH. I shall now briefly furnish the reasons for my decision. \nWhether the Purchase Moneys were loans or gifts \n9 It is important to note that the Australian Property was in the sole name \nof CTH and that the Purchase Moneys were provided by Mdm Ho to CTH, \nie, from a mother to her son. Hence, one would expect a high degree of \ninformality between Mdm Ho and CTH.\n10 In my view, Mdm Tay\u2019s argument that the Purchase Moneys were gifts \nbecause she was not told that they were loans from Mdm Ho is not persuasive. \nMdm Ho testified that, during a family dinner in early 2010 before the purchase \nof the Australian Property, she had told CTH and Mdm Tay that she would be \nlending CTH a large sum of money to purchase the Australian Property. \nMdm Tay has stated that she does not recall this conversation taking place. \nNeither party has called CTH himself, or any other persons present at this family \nVersion No 1: 04 Feb 2021 (18:31 hrs)\nTay Amy v Ho Toh Ying[2021] SGHC 25\n5dinner, to corroborate their respective accounts. However, even assuming that \nthis conversation did not take place (as Mdm Tay claims), the mere fact that \nCTH and Mdm Ho did not indicate or suggest to Mdm Tay that the Purchase \nMoneys were loans does not show that the Purchase Moneys were gifts. The \nagreement or arrangement relating to the transfer of the Purchase Moneys would \nhave been made between Mdm Ho and CTH. Whether or not they \ncommunicated this agreement to Mdm Tay would be, at best, inconclusive of \ntheir actual intentions. Mdm Tay\u2019s argument that CTH would have informed \nher if they had taken loans amounting to such a large sum of money, as these \nloans would impose a significant financial burden on their family, also loses \nmuch of its force in the context of friendly loans from mother to son. Unlike, \nfor example, a bank or commercial loan, Mdm Ho would not have charged \ninterest on the principal sum or demanded adherence to a fixed repayment \nschedule.  \n11 Mdm Tay further argues that the presumption of advancement enables \nher to establish that the Purchase Moneys were gifts instead of loans from \nMdm Ho to CTH. A mother-child relationship may give rise to the presumption \nof advancement in certain circumstances. However, as the Court of"}

She would not admit that she was an active investor \nin the Nanning Scheme in China. She was also not forthright and prevaricated \nwhen questioned whether the Nanning Scheme was profitable (it was) until the \ncourt pressed her for an answer.156 She would not even admit that it was her \ninvestment, trying to distance herself from it by claiming her long-time \naccountant Shanice requested her to invest $50,000 and leave it to Shanice, who \nwould \u201ctake care of everything\u201d.157 Her evidence was contrary to the WhatsApp \nmessages exhibited in the Defendant\u2019s AEIC that showed the Plaintiff\u2019s heavy \ninvolvement in the Nanning Scheme.158 The court accepts the Defendant\u2019s \ncharacterisation that the methodology of the Nanning Scheme was that of a \n\u201cPonzi\u201d or multi-level marketing scheme.159 It appears, in fact, the Plaintiff \nrecruited the Defendant as her \u201cdownline\u201d in that scheme.160\n81 The Plaintiff\u2019s scheming in that project extended to her not wanting the \nDefendant and Shanice to meet while they were in Nanning.161 This was most \nlikely because she did not want Shanice to get to know the Defendant and find \nout she had recruited him as her \u201cdownline\u201d. \n156 Transcript, 17 March 2021, p 18 line 4 to p 19 line 17.\n157 Transcript, 17 March 2021, p 22 line 12 to p 24 line 11.\n158 Defendant\u2019s AEIC at pp 144\n159 Defendant\u2019s AEIC at para 44.\n160 Transcript, 17 March 2021, p 29 lines 18\u201325.\n161 Defendant\u2019s AEIC at p 148.\nVersion No 1: 02 Nov 2021 (11:24 hrs)\nYe Huishi Rachel v Ng Ke Ming Jerry[2021] SGHC 250\n3082 It was evident from those WhatsApp messages that the Plaintiff first \ncommunicated with the Defendant on 29 August 2016,162 well before the period \nshe began investing in agarwood, which she had claimed in her AEIC was when \nshe first met him.163 She had also omitted mention in her AEIC of the fact that \nCedric was in direct communication with her by 6 February 2017.164 She was \nshown to have directly transferred funds to Cedric for her first investment,165 \ncontrary to her claim that her fund transfers were always made through and\/or \nby the Defendant. \n83 The Plaintiff\u2019s cross-examination166 also revealed that it was Cedric who \nprovided his bank account particulars to the Plaintiff, not the Defendant, as \npleaded in her Reply.167 \n84 It was during cross-examination that the Plaintiff disclosed she first met \nCedric on or about 17 February 2017, when the Defendant introduced him at \nher restaurant at Punggol Settlement.168 \n85 The Plaintiff did not disclose in her AEIC that while she was chasing the \nDefendant, she was simultaneously chasing Cedric for payment.

The banks then looked \nto the Defendant as the guarantor to repay the loans and when he could not, he \nwas made bankrupt.\n90 It was at this juncture that he met Cedric and was drawn into investing \nin agarwood, believing that the 10% commission which Cedric would pay for \nintroducing investors would be a way out of his bankruptcy.176 Indeed, the \nDefendant managed to repay the banks\u2019 loans and annul his bankruptcy, using \nhis earnings from Cedric.177 The Defendant was impressed with Cedric\u2019s \nlifestyle of changing motorcars multiple times.178 However, he clarified he did \nnot aspire to have the same lifestyle, but rather wanted to have funds to launch \nhis own start-up, hoping it would be as successful as Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla Motors, \nMark Zuckerberg\u2019s Facebook and Singaporean Tan Min-Liang\u2019s Razer.179 \n91 The Defendant disclosed that when the Plaintiff was hounding him \nrelentlessly, he was already under great stress as he was being questioned by the \npolice arising out of his association with Ng and Lee.180 Apparently, they were \ninvolved in a syndicate\u2019s cheating scam involving $40m of SkillsFuture \nfunds.181 In re-examination, the Defendant\u2019s counsel clarified it was in fact the \nDefendant who lodged a police report against Ng and Lee.182 \n176 Transcript, 18 March 2021, p 226 line 11 to p 227 line 10.\n177 Transcript, 18 March 2021, p 227 line 25 to p 228 line 3.\n178 Transcript, 18 March 2021, p 232 lines 23\u201325.\n179 Transcript, 18 March 2021, p 232 line 29 to p 233 line 13.\n180 Transcript, 18 March 2021, p 236 line 20 to p 240 line 5.\n181 Transcript, 18 March 2021, p 229 lines 21\u201323.\n182 Transcript, 18 March 2021, p 274 lines 4\u20135.\nVersion No 1: 02 Nov 2021 (11:24 hrs)\nYe Huishi Rachel v Ng Ke Ming Jerry[2021] SGHC 250\n3392 Arising out of the police investigations that followed the Defendant\u2019s \npolice report, charges were brought against Ng and Lee and resulted in the \nDefendant being charged as a co-conspirator.

In the 2nd \nStatement, Munusamy claimed that a Malaysian man (or \u201cthe Boy\u201d) had put the \nRed Bag and the Items in the Box and told him that they were \u201cpanas\u201d items  \nand that one Saravanan (\u201cSara\u201d) an Indian Malaysian would call Munusamy and \ntell him what to do with them.29 Munusamy claimed that a \u201cpanas\u201d item meant \na \u201cstolen item\u201d, although defence counsel (Mr Lukshumayeh) did not dispute \nthat \u201cpanas\u201d as a term could also refer to illegal drugs.30 Finally, there was \nintention to traffic the Drugs as they were not for Munusamy\u2019s consumption but \nwere intended to be moved into the possession of another person. \nClose of the Prosecution\u2019s case\n20 At the close of the Prosecution\u2019s case, I found that there was sufficient \nevidence against Munusamy for him to be called upon to give evidence in his \ndefence. Munusamy chose to testify but did not call other witnesses.\nThe Defence\n21 I set out Munusamy\u2019s testimony in court. Munusamy was working as a \ncleaning supervisor at Tower 2 and had worked in Singapore for about 14 years. \nHe came to know Sara, who resides in Malaysia, for about a year before his \n28 Prosecution\u2019s Closing Submissions (\u201cPCS\u201d) at [28].\n29 AB 262 (2nd Statement, Answers 5 and 6).\n30 6\/5\/21 NE 87.\nVersion No 1: 16 Nov 2021 (11:12 hrs)\nPP v Munusamy Ramarmurth[2021] SGHC 255\n10arrest. Sara first asked Munusamy to collect money on his behalf in 2017, and \nMunusamy would receive RM200 to RM300 payment from him. Since July \n2017 Sara had stopped entering Singapore as he was involved in criminal \nactivities. However, Munusamy claimed that Sara was not a drug supplier.31\n22 In July 2017, Sara and the Boy had visited Munusamy\u2019s workplace and \nasked him for space to place a plastic bag of \u201cpanas\u201d items. Munusamy told \nthem about his Bike Box and brought them to the Carpark to view his Bike. He \nthen asked Sara and the Boy what the \u201cpanas\u201d items were, and Sara told him \nthat they were \u201cstolen items\u201d. Munusamy then asked Sara to open the plastic \nbag to show him the contents, and when it was opened he saw a \u201cbungkus\u201d \n(Malay word for \u201cpackage\u201d) of items. Munusamy asked Sara and the Boy to \nopen up the \u201cbungkus\u201d and he saw handphone boxes which contained \nhandphones. The plastic bag was then tied up and Sara and the Boy left the bag \ninside the Box. In the evening of the same day, Sara called Munusamy to inform \nhim that he had removed the plastic bag, and Munusamy assumed it was Sara \nand the Boy who had done so.32 I will refer to this as the July 2017 Incident. \n23 On 26 January 2018, Munusamy rode his Bike to the Carpark and parked \nit at about 11.50am. At that time, the Box was not locked. He then took out his \npersonal belongings from the Box and closed the Box without locking it and \nwent off to work.33\n24 Around 12 noon, Sara phoned him and asked for help to place an item \nwith him and take it later, just like the \u201cprevious incident\u201d, which Munusamy \n31 27\/7\/21 NE 36\u201337, 62; 29\/7\/21 NE 24\u201325, 55; AB 297 (7th Statement at [28]\u2013[29]).\n32 27\/7\/21 NE 51\u201354, 62.\n33 27\/7\/21 NE 49, 54\u201357.\nVersion No 1: 16 Nov 2021 (11:12 hrs)\nPP v Munusamy Ramarmurth[2021] SGHC 255\n11understood to mean the July 2017 Incident. Sara told him that it would be \n\u201cpanas\u201d items.34 At about 1.00pm, Sara called Munusamy to inform him that an \nitem had been placed in the Box \u2013 this was the first time he knew that the Red \nBag was inside the Box of the Bike.35 Sara had also earlier told Munusamy that \nthe Boy would place the item in the Box and take it later; but Munusamy was \nnot present to witness the Boy putting the Red Bag in the Box.36 Munusamy \nwould always leave the Box unlocked so that it would be easier for the Box to \nbe checked by the Customs officers when he entered Singapore. Sara also \ninformed him on that call that there was a \u201cbungkus\u201d for him and that the Boy \nhad locked the Box. Munusamy assumed that the Boy must have pushed down \nthe cover of the Box hard, causing the Box to be locked.37\n25 Hence at about 1.40pm, Munusamy went to the Bike to unlock the Box \nso that the Boy could return to collect the Red Bag and to retrieve the \u201cbungkus\u201d \n(the White Package) that Sara had left for Munusamy. When he unlocked the \nBox with one of the Keys, he saw the Red Bag and the White Package. He took \nthe White Package and then closed the lid of the Box but did not lock the Box. \nHe did not check what was in the Red Bag because Sara had already informed \nhim that it contained \u201cpanas\u201d items just like in the previous incident. Munusamy \nsubsequently found out that the White Package contained a handphone when he \nreturned to the cleaners\u2019 room at Tower 2 and opened it.38\n34 27\/7\/21 NE 54, 56, 61\u201362; 29\/7\/21 NE 2.\n35 27\/7\/21 NE 48, 55\n36 27\/7\/21 NE 50\u201351.\n37 27\/7\/21 NE 57; 28\/7\/21 NE 2.\n38 27\/7\/21 NE 58\u201362, 65\u201367; 28\/7\/21 NE 2; 29\/7\/21 NE 3, 34.\nVersion No 1: 16 Nov 2021 (11:12 hrs)\nPP v Munusamy Ramarmurth[2021] SGHC 255\n1226 At about 3.30pm, Munusamy met with the Boy. Sara had earlier \ninstructed him to collect money from another person to hand over to the Boy, \nand Munusamy had collected $8,000 from \u201cAbang\u201d (subsequently established \nto be one Mustaqim). When the Boy took the $8,000 from Munusamy, he told \nMunusamy that the Red Bag contained \u201cpanas\u201d items and that he would hand \nover the money to Sara in Malaysia and thereafter return to Singapore to take \nthe \u201cpanas\u201d items. Munusamy stated that Sara had also earlier informed him of \nthat arrangement.39\n27 Munusamy thought that the Red Bag contained illegal\/stolen items or \nstolen handphones as Sara had told him that it contained \u201cpanas\u201d items. He \nallowed Sara to store the Red Bag temporarily in the Box because Sara told him \nthat the Boy would return to collect it. He did not receive any reward for helping \nSara.40 When Munusamy was first arrested, he did not know what offence he \nwas being arrested for. He came to know that the Red Bag contained drugs when \nhe was read a charge for drug trafficking before recording the 5th Statement.41 \nIn the 7th Statement, Munusamy claimed that he came to know that the Red Bag \ncontained drugs when the CNB officers mentioned that word when he was at \nWoodlands Checkpoint, where he was brought to after his arrest.42\nApplicable law\n28 The elements to be proved for a charge of drug trafficking under s \n5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the MDA are: (a) possession of a controlled drug; (b) \n39 27\/7\/21 NE 63; 28\/7\/21 NE 65; 29\/7\/21 NE 34, 38, 43\u201344.\n40 27\/7\/21 NE 62; 29\/7\/21 NE 53\u201355.\n41 27\/7\/21 NE 44; 28\/7\/21 NE 39; 29\/7\/21 NE 17.\n42 AB 294 (7th Statement at [20]); AB 292 (6th Statement at [11]).\nVersion No 1: 16 Nov 2021 (11:12 hrs)\nPP v Munusamy Ramarmurth[2021] SGHC 255\n13knowledge of the nature of the drug; and (c) that the possession of the drugs was \nfor the purpose of trafficking which was not authorised.\n29 To prove the fact of possession, the Prosecution must prove that the \naccused was in possession of the container or package and knew that it \ncontained something, which may later be established to be the drugs in question. \nThere is no need to prove that the accused specifically knew that he was in \npossession of drugs or even something that turns out to be contraband. To prove \nknowledge, the accused must be shown to know not only of the existence of the \nthing which is later found to be a drug, but also knowledge of the specific drug. \n(See Adili Chibuike Ejike v Public Prosecutor [2019] 2 SLR 254 at [32], [34] \nand [35]; Beh Chew Boo v Public Prosecutor [2020] 2 SLR 1375 at [54].)\n30 The Prosecution also relied on the presumptions of knowledge and \npossession under ss 18(2) and 21 of the MDA. In particular, s 18(2) provides as \nfollows:\nPresumption of possession and knowledge of controlled \ndrugs \n18.\u2014(2)   Any person who is proved or presumed to have had a \ncontrolled drug in his possession shall, until the contrary is \nproved, be presumed to have known the nature of that drug. \n31 To rebut the presumption under s 18(2), the accused must prove on a \nbalance of probabilities that he did not know of the nature of the drug. The \npresumption may be rebutted by proving that the accused genuinely believed \nthat he was in possession of something innocuous or of some contraband item \nor drug other than the specific drug in possession. He has to adduce sufficient \nevidence disclosing the basis upon which he claims to have arrived at that \nsubjective state of mind (Gobi a\/l Avedian v Public Prosecutor [2021] 1 SLR \n180 (\u201cGobi\u201d) at [58]\u2013[59]). However, an accused who is indifferent to what he \nVersion No 1: 16 Nov 2021 (11:12 hrs)\nPP v Munusamy Ramarmurth[2021] SGHC 255\n14is carrying cannot be said to believe that the nature of the thing in his possession \nis something other than or incompatible with the specific drug he is in \npossession of. Where he is in a position to ascertain the nature of what he is \ncarrying but chooses not to do so, he may be said to be indifferent to the nature \nof what he is carrying: (a) where he is in fact wholly indifferent to what he is \ncarrying; or (b) where he knows that what he is carrying is a contraband item, \nbut does not care to find out what that item is or is not (Gobi at [65] and [67]).\nWhether element of possession of the Drugs made out\n32 I found that possession was made out. Munusamy accepted that he was \nin possession of the Red Bag which contained the Drugs and did not dispute the \nchain of custody of the Items. He did not challenge the presumption under s 21 \nof the MDA.43 He agreed to Sara leaving the Red Bag in the Box, he saw the \nRed Bag when he opened the Box to retrieve the White Package, and he knew \nthat it contained \u201cpanas\u201d items or stolen\/illegal goods.44\nThe Statements\n33 I deal here with the 1st to 4th Statements, as they would be material to \nMunusamy\u2019s knowledge of the contents of the Red Bag and to his defence that \nit was stored temporarily in the Box for the Boy to collect. Munusamy had, at \nthe commencement of the trial, agreed that all the Statements were made \nvoluntarily and there was no threat, inducement or promise made to him in \nrecording the Statements.45 At trial, Munusamy then claimed that the 1st, 2nd \n43 Defence\u2019s Reply Submissions (19 October 2021) at [10]\u2013[11].\n44 27\/7\/21 NE 48\u201349, 57\u201358.\n45 ASOF at [27]\u2013[28].\nVersion No 1: 16 Nov 2021 (11:12 hrs)\nPP v Munusamy Ramarmurth[2021] SGHC 255\n15and 3rd Statements were inaccurately recorded and the 4th Statement was a \nfabrication.\n1st Statement \n34 Munusamy admitted to signing the 1st Statement but claimed that it did \nnot capture all the questions and answers that took place in the cleaners\u2019 room \nbetween Tony and him. He claimed that Tony had also asked him where his \npassport and work permit were, whether there was anything in his locker, and \nwhether he had passed anything to someone earlier; and he had answered these \nquestions. Pertinently, for the last answer in the 1st Statement (see [ 8] above), \nhe claimed that he told Tony that someone would put a bag inside the Box and \nthat person said that he would take it away, but he did not check.46 It was \nundisputed that the conversation between Munusamy and Tony was in English \nand they could understand each other.47 Munusamy further claimed that whilst \ninside the CNB car at the Carpark, Tony handed the field diary (where the 1st \nStatement was recorded) to Nasrulhaq and it was Nasrulhaq who had asked him \nto sign on it; that he signed without reading it; that no one read the contents to \nhim; and that he was never informed that he could make amendments to it.48\n35 I rejected Munusamy\u2019s assertions. I disbelieved that no one had read the \ncontents of the field diary (containing the 1st Statement) to Munusamy before \nhe signed it or that the statement was inaccurate as he claimed. In particular, I \nrejected Munusamy\u2019s claim that he had informed Tony that the man who put \nthe bag in the Box would return to collect it.\n46 5\/5\/21 NE 109, 128; 27\/7\/21 NE 38\u201340; 28\/7\/21 NE 41\u201342.\n47 28\/7\/21 NE 1, 38.\n48 5\/5\/21 NE 127\u2013128; 27\/7\/21 NE 42\u201343; 28\/7\/21 NE 43.\nVersion No 1: 16 Nov 2021 (11:12 hrs)\nPP v Munusamy Ramarmurth[2021] SGHC 255\n1636 I accepted Tony\u2019s evidence. He stated that at the Carpark, he narrated to \nJames the conversation that he had with Munusamy in the cleaners\u2019 room and \nwhich James recorded in his field diary. Although the 1st Statement was not \nimmediately recorded when Tony and Munusamy were in the cleaners\u2019 room, \nit was nevertheless a fairly contemporaneous record made shortly after they had \nthe Conversation and Munusamy was then brought to the Carpark. Tony had \nexplained that he did not record the Conversation immediately because he did \nnot have a field book with him at that time. In any event, I accepted Tony\u2019s \naccount that after James had recorded the Conversation in his field diary, James \nhanded the diary to Tony, and Tony read it back to Munusamy and asked him \nif he wished to make any amendments to which Munusamy declined. \nMunusamy then acknowledged the contents and signed on the field diary.49 \n37 What transpired in relation to the recording of the 1st Statement was \ncorroborated by James, who was beside Tony and Munusamy at that time.50 I \nhad no reason to disbelieve Tony\u2019s and James\u2019 accounts. I did not believe that \nMunusamy would have signed on the 1st Statement without knowing its \ncontents; and it was also not put to Nasrulhaq in his cross-examination that it \nwas he who had asked Munusamy to sign on the 1st Statement. \n2nd Statement\n38 The 2nd Statement was recorded by Nasrulhaq in the CNB car, and the \nconversation took place in Malay. I set out the questions (\u201cQ1\u201d to \u201cQ7\u201d) and \nanswers (\u201cA1\u201d to \u201cA7\u201d), as translated into English:51\nQ1: Before you were arrested earlier, what were you doing?\n49 AB 209 (Tony\u2019s Statement at [7]); 5\/5\/21 NE 122, 130.\n50 AB 231 (James\u2019 Statement at [6]); 5\/5\/21 NE 83\u201384.\n51 28\/7\/21 NE 70; AB 262\u2013263.\nVersion No 1: 16 Nov 2021 (11:12 hrs)\nPP v Munusamy Ramarmurth[2021] SGHC 255\n17A1: Today, in the evening, I met with a Malay man who I \ncalled \u2018abang\u2019. \u2018Abang\u2019 called me using the number \n\u201882535802\u2019, instructed me to bring the package and \nmeet him near the men toilet at tower two.

It was not disputed that \u201cAbang\u201d was Mustaqim, and \nMunusamy claimed that the \u201cMalaysian man\u201d was the Boy.53  In relation to A7, \nhe identified Abang as the person in a photo (\u201cPhoto 13\u201d) from a photo board \nthat Nasrulhaq showed him, and next to that photo, Nasrulhaq had recorded \nMunusamy\u2019s answer in Malay which is \u201cIni \u2018abang\u2019 yang tadi saya kasi itu \nbungkusan\u201d.

Pertinently, Munusamy\u2019s assertion that he only signed \nthe 2nd Statement at the CNB office when Nasrulhaq told him to do so, was not \nput to Nasrulhaq in his cross-examination although Nasrulhaq had testified that \nit was signed in the CNB car.62 \n43 An examination of the contents of the 2nd Statement and Munusamy\u2019s \nexplanations as to the alleged inaccuracies therein, also showed that his \nassertions could not be believed. \n44 First, his claim that the \u201cpackage\u201d referred to in Q2 and his answer to it \nwas the Red Bag, was unconvincing and did not make sense. \n(a) Munusamy claimed that he understood Q2 about a \u201cpackage\u201d \npertained to the Red Bag because Nasrulhaq was only referring to the \nRed Bag when he asked questions about a \u201cpackage\u201d (or \u201cbungkusan\u201d \nin Malay).63 But this was not borne out by Q2 itself (which Munusamy \ndid not challenge as inaccurate). Pertinently, it was Munusamy who first \nreferred to and used the word \u201cbungkusan\u201d in A1, which he agreed was \n61 AB 215\u2013216 (Nasrulhaq\u2019s Statement at [9]\u2013[10]); 6\/5\/21 NE 100.\n62 27\/7\/21 NE 53; 28\/7\/21 NE 36, 70.\n63 28\/7\/21 NE 61.\nVersion No 1: 16 Nov 2021 (11:12 hrs)\nPP v Munusamy Ramarmurth[2021] SGHC 255\n21not a reference to the Red Bag.64  It can be seen from Q2 that Nasrulhaq \nwas asking a follow-up question about the \u201cbungkusan\u201d or \u201cpackage\u201d \nthat Munusamy had mentioned in A1; this was attested to by \nNasrulhaq.65 That Q2 pertained to a \u201cpackage\u201d that was referred to in A1 \nby Munusamy can also be seen from Q3 where Nasrulhaq then asked \nabout a \u201cMalaysian man\u201d which Munusamy had mentioned in A2.66\n(b) It was only when the court asked Munusamy whether he had \nunderstood that the \u201cpackage\u201d in Q2 referred to the Red Bag because \nNasrulhaq had pointed to the Red Bag when asking that question, that \nhe then claimed that Nasrulhaq had pointed to the back of the CNB car \ntowards the boot (where he claimed the Red Bag was placed) when Q2 \nwas posed.67 \n(c) I found Munusamy\u2019s claim that Nasrulhaq had pointed to the \nback of the car when Q2 was posed to be a fabrication and an attempt to \nexplain how he understood that Q2 referred to the Red Bag. It was never \nput to Nasrulhaq in his cross-examination that he had pointed to \nanything (let alone the back of the car) when Q2 was asked. In fact, Mr \nLukshumayeh had put to Nasrulhaq that he had pointed to the rear or the \nboot of the CNB vehicle when he asked Q5.68\n(d) Munusamy\u2019s assertion above and his instructions to Mr \nLukshumayeh (for the purposes of cross-examining Nasrulhaq) were \n64 28\/7\/21 NE 17, 61\u201362.\n65 23\/7\/21 NE 33\u201335.\n66 6\/5\/21 NE 91.\n67 28\/7\/21 NE 62.\n68 6\/5\/21 NE 92; 23\/7\/21 NE 60\u201361.\nVersion No 1: 16 Nov 2021 (11:12 hrs)\nPP v Munusamy Ramarmurth[2021] SGHC 255\n22also inconsistent. Munusamy stated in examination-in-chief that no one \npointed to anything when Q5 was asked.69 This was inconsistent with \nthe position that Mr Lukshumayeh had earlier put to Nasrulhaq at least \ntwice. Then in cross-examination, Munusamy claimed that Nasrulhaq \nhad pointed to the back of the CNB car when he asked Q2 and Q5 and \nhad pointed \u201ca few times\u201d while they were conversing in the car.70 \n(e) Munusamy\u2019s inability to give a coherent account of when \nNasrulhaq had pointed to the rear or boot of the CNB car showed that \nhis testimony could not be believed and that he was attempting to justify \nwhy he had answered A2 the way he did. \n(f) I accepted Nasrulhaq\u2019s testimony that it was only at Q5 that he \npointed to the items in the Red Bag which were all placed in the Duffel \nBag at the centre console of the CNB car and not in the boot.71\n45 Second, I disbelieved that Munusamy had not said the words in bold and \nitalics in A1, A4 and A6. There was no reason for Nasrulhaq to have fabricated \nMunusamy\u2019s answers. In particular, Munusamy claimed that he did not say the \nfirst sentence in A6, whereas Mr Lukshumayeh had put it to Nasrulhaq that \nMunusamy had answered the first sentence as \u201c[a]ll these things belonged to an \nIndian Malaysia man, his name is Saravanan\u201d but did not then say that Sara \n\u201cwould call me and tell me what to do with the things\u201d.72 Mr Lukshumayeh also \nput to Nasrulhaq that Munusamy had used the word \u201cbarang\u201d (meaning \u201cthing\u201d \nor \u201citem\u201d) instead of \u201cdrugs\u201d (or \u201cdadah\u201d in the original Malay version) in the \n69 28\/7\/21 NE 21.\n70 28\/7\/21 NE 64, 66\u201367.\n71 23\/7\/21 NE 39\u201341.\n72 23\/7\/21 NE 43; 28\/7\/21 NE 22.\nVersion No 1: 16 Nov 2021 (11:12 hrs)\nPP v Munusamy Ramarmurth[2021] SGHC 255\n23last sentence of A6.73 When asked to clarify whether Munusamy had said the \nlast sentence in A6 except that he used the word \u201cthing\u201d or \u201citem\u201d and not \n\u201cdrugs\u201d, he initially confirmed that position but later said that he never uttered \nthe entire sentence at all.74 Munusamy\u2019s inability to make up his mind as to what \nhe had or had not told Nasrulhaq in the 2nd Statement showed up his lack of \ncredibility in relation to what happened during the statement taking.\n46 Third, Munusamy claimed that the Sentence recorded next to Photo 13 \nwas wrong, in that he said that Abang gave him the package (\u201ckasi saya\u201d in \nMalay) whereas Nasrulhaq had recorded it as Munusamy gave Abang the \npackage (\u201csaya kasi\u201d).75 I disbelieved that the Sentence was wrongly recorded. \nMunusamy did not dispute that he signed next to the Sentence which was a very \nshort one and he could read simple Malay. \n47 In the round, I found that Munusamy\u2019s claims in relation to how the 2nd \nStatement was recorded and its inaccuracies were not made out. I was satisfied \nthat the 2nd Statement was accurately recorded.\n3rd Statement\n48 The 3rd Statement was recorded in Malay by Nasrulhaq at the CNB \noffice at the Woodlands Checkpoint (see [ 12]\u2013[ 13] above) as follows:76\nQ8: How much did you give \u2018abang\u2019 before you were arrested \nat the men toilet of tower two?\nA8: I only remembered one package.

I \naccepted Nasrulhaq\u2019s testimony that after recording the 3rd Statement he read \nit back to Munusamy in Malay; that Munusamy affirmed the statement to be \ntrue and correct; and that Munusamy did not wish to make any changes to the \nstatement. In fact, Mr Lukshumayeh did not put to Nasrulhaq in cross-\nexamination that Q8 was wrongly recorded, but only claimed that Munusamy\u2019s \nreply in A8 was \u201cone package, I\u2019m not sure\u201d and that A8 was not in answer to \nQ8.78 I found that Munusamy\u2019s claim that Q8 was actually about how many \npackages the Abang had handed to Munusamy was an attempt to align to his \nearlier assertion that his answer in A1 (in the 2nd Statement) was about Abang \nhanding a package to him; as otherwise Q8 and A8 (as reflected in the 3rd \nStatement) would not make sense in light of his claim pertaining to A1.\n4th Statement\n51 Nasrulhaq attested that the 4th Statement was recorded at about 9.30 pm \nin the CNB car when he, Tony, James and Munusamy were on their way to CNB \nHeadquarters (see [ 14] above). Munusamy claimed that this never happened as \nhe was sleeping in the CNB car at that time, and that the 4th Statement was thus \nfabricated.79 He had signed on the 4th Statement at the CNB office and whilst \nhaving his meal. He claimed that Nasrulhaq asked him to sign on a notebook \nbut he did not know what he was signing and did not bother to read its contents \n77 28\/7\/21 NE 24.\n78 23\/7\/21 NE 46.\n79 23\/7\/21 NE 51, 62\u201363; 28\/7\/21 NE 10, 12, 78.\nVersion No 1: 16 Nov 2021 (11:12 hrs)\nPP v Munusamy Ramarmurth[2021] SGHC 255\n25or ask Nasrulhaq about it. He claimed that at that time he was very worried and \nstressed as he had by then discovered that drugs were found on him.80\n52 I rejected Munusamy\u2019s assertions above and found that the 4th \nStatement was a record of the conversation between Nasrulhaq and Munusamy \nwhen they were in the CNB car. This was corroborated by Tony who was in the \nsame car and who had given Nasrulhaq instructions to further question \nMunusamy. Tony attested that he did not pay attention to the conversation \nbetween Nasrulhaq and Munusamy in the CNB car but he knew that Nasrulhaq \nwas at that time recording a statement from Munusamy.81 Whilst Mr \nLukshumayeh had questioned Tony at some length regarding the recording of \nthe 4th Statement, he did not suggest to Tony that there was no such recording \ntaking place in the CNB car or that there was no conversation with Munusamy \nbecause he was asleep. Pertinently, in the ASOF filed at the commencement of \nthe trial, Munusamy had stated that the 4th Statement (as with all the \nStatements) had been given voluntarily. Hence, I agreed with the Prosecution \nthat Munusamy\u2019s claim in court that it was fabricated was an afterthought.\nWhether presumption of knowledge rebutted\n53 I turn to the element of knowledge. Having considered all the evidence, \nI found that Munusamy had failed to rebut the presumption of knowledge under \ns 18(2) of the MDA. Munusamy claimed that he thought the Red Bag contained \nillegal items or stolen goods which were handphones because of the July 2017 \nIncident. He also claimed that he was merely helping Sara to store the stolen \n80 28\/7\/21 NE 10, 12\u201313, 76\u201377.\n81 AB 211 (Tony\u2019s Statement at [16]); 5\/5\/21 NE 99, 119\u2013120.\nVersion No 1: 16 Nov 2021 (11:12 hrs)\nPP v Munusamy Ramarmurth[2021] SGHC 255\n26goods temporarily as the Boy would return to collect the Red Bag. However, I \nfound that his assertions were not credible.\nJuly 2017 Incident\n54 Munusamy claimed that he believed the Red Bag contained stolen \nhandphones because of the July 2017 Incident where Sara had asked for his help \nto store stolen handphones. He also claimed that when he saw the Red Bag for \nthe first time at around 1.40pm on 26 January 2018, that it looked like a packet \nof the same size and was tied in the same way as the package that was stored in \nthe Box in July 2017 and hence the Red Bag did not seem suspicious to him.82\n55 I disbelieved Munusamy\u2019s account for the basis of his belief that the Red \nBag contained stolen handphones. I found that he had made up the July 2017 \nIncident to support his purported belief. He did not show any evidence of the \noccurrence of the July 2017 Incident and that incident was never mentioned in \nany of the Statements despite him having had multiple opportunities to do so. I \nfound his claim that he thought the Red Bag contained handphones or stolen \nhandphones was an afterthought which emerged only at the trial.\n56 In the 2nd Statement when Nasrulhaq asked Munusamy what the items \nin the Red Bag were (in Q5), he did not reply that he thought they were \nhandphones but instead said that he did not know what they were. Munusamy \naccepted that his answer in A5 was correctly recorded.83 Indeed, Munusamy \nclaimed that his answer in A2 also pertained to the Red Bag (which I had \ndisbelieved). Even if that were true, he similarly failed to mention that he \nthought the Red Bag contained handphones but instead said that he did not know \n82 29\/7\/21 NE 34\u201335, 54\u201355.\n83 28\/7\/21 NE 21-22.\nVersion No 1: 16 Nov 2021 (11:12 hrs)\nPP v Munusamy Ramarmurth[2021] SGHC 255\n27what was in the package. In both A2 and A5, he merely said that he was told by \nthe Boy that they were \u201cpanas\u201d items. According to Munusamy, when the 2nd \nStatement was recorded, he did not know that the Red Bag contained drugs,84 \nhence there was no reason why he could not have informed Nasrulhaq that he \nthought it contained handphones. \n57 Munusamy claimed that he did not mention to Nasrulhaq in the 2nd \nStatement that he thought the items in the Red Bag were handphones because \nhe \u201cwas not asked\u201d about it. But this was untrue, given that Q5 was a specific \nquestion about what the contents of the Red Bag were, and going by \nMunusamy\u2019s case so was Q2. Munusamy could even say that he thought they \nwere \u201cpanas\u201d items. I found that Munusamy had failed to mention that he \nthought the contents of the Red Bag were handphones because he had no real \nbasis for that belief at that time.\n58  In the 5th Statement, Munusamy again failed to mention that he thought \nthe items in the Box were handphones. Munusamy confirmed that the contents \nof the 5th Statement were accurate.85 His explanation that he did not inform IO \nYang at the recording of the 5th Statement of this was because he already came \nto know by then that they were drugs, was unconvincing. By that time, he knew \nhe was facing a capital charge for drug trafficking and that the Red Bag \ncontained drugs as he had seen the contents.86 Yet he did not explain that he \nbelieved the Red Bag contained handphones, despite mentioning in the \nstatement both Sara\u2019s and the Boy\u2019s involvement in the Red Bag (of the Drugs).\n84 28\/7\/21 NE 32\u201334.\n85 28\/7\/21 NE 5\u20136.\n86 28\/7\/21 NE 7\u20138, 18.\nVersion No 1: 16 Nov 2021 (11:12 hrs)\nPP v Munusamy Ramarmurth[2021] SGHC 255\n2859 In the 6th Statement, Munusamy had narrated about how Sara had \ninstructed him on 26 January 2018 to collect $8,000 to pass to the Boy. He did \nnot further mention that Sara had also asked for his assistance to store stolen \nitems in his Box on that day, much less that he agreed to this because he thought \nthe items were handphones due to the July 2017 Incident. Instead, he reiterated \nthat he did not know what was in the Red Bag.87\n60 Likewise, in the 7th Statement, Munusamy narrated at some length \nabout how he came to know Sara and helped Sara to collect money in the past, \nand how he collected $8,000 for Sara on 26 January 2018. Despite mentioning \nhow he had assisted Sara to collect money, he did not mention that he had also \nassisted Sara to store stolen items or handphones previously or in July 2017. \nSpecifically, he stated in the 7th Statement that he did not know who the items \nin the Red Bag belonged to, which he acknowledged in court was inconsistent \nwith his claim that they belonged to Sara.88 \n61 I disbelieved Munusamy that he failed to mention that the Red Bag and \nitems therein belonged to Sara or that he thought it contained handphones \nbecause he was \u201cemotional\u201d or \u201cconfused\u201d during the recording of the \nStatements.89 After all, he was able to narrate and describe in some detail his \nrelationship with Sara and provide information on Sara, what he did for Sara in \nthe past, and how he came to collect $8,000 for Sara on 26 January 2018. \n62 His failure to mention in the Statements of what he thought the Red Bag \ncontained or of the July 2017 Incident led me to conclude that he had made up \n87 AB 292 (6th Statement at [10]).\n88 29\/7\/21 NE 11.\n89 AB 294 (7th Statement at [20]); 29\/7\/21 NE 7, 11\u201312, 29\u201330.\nVersion No 1: 16 Nov 2021 (11:12 hrs)\nPP v Munusamy Ramarmurth[2021] SGHC 255\n29a story that he thought the Red Bag contained handphones and of the July 2017 \nIncident to support his purported belief. Indeed, he initially claimed that Sara \nhad expressly told him that the Red Bag contained handphones, then changed \nhis evidence to state that Sara did not tell him as such and that he had merely \nassumed they were handphones because of the July 2017 Incident.90\nFailure to check the contents of the Red Bag\n63 On the contrary, I found that Munusamy knew what was in the Red Bag. \nFirst, based on his own account, he claimed that Sara wanted his help to place \n\u201cpanas\u201d items in the Box, and he knew that \u201cpanas\u201d items were illegal items or \nstolen goods. Second, he knew that Sara was involved in illegal or criminal \nactivities.91 Third, I found that Munusamy knew that Sara was involved in drug \nactivities. In the 2nd Statement (at A6), Munusamy stated that Sara had told him \nthat Sara \u201calways instructs his man to bring drugs into Singapore\u201d. I had earlier \nfound that the 2nd Statement was accurately recorded. In court, Munusamy \nstated that Sara was not a drug supplier which I disbelieved and it was \ninconsistent with the 2nd Statement. I found that he was trying to disassociate \nhimself from being incriminated in any drug dealings.92 \n64 Yet, Munusamy did not check the contents of the Red Bag when he saw \nit at about 1.40pm on 26 January 2018; this is despite that he was told that it \ncontained \u201cpanas\u201d items but was not told what these \u201cpanas\u201d items were. He \nadmitted he could and should have checked the contents of the Red Bag and that \nhe did not care what was in it despite knowing that it contained illegal or stolen \n90 27\/7\/21 NE 61\u201362; 29\/7\/21 NE 2, 53\u201354.\n91 29\/7\/21 NE 24\u201325.\n92 29\/7\/21 NE 55.\nVersion No 1: 16 Nov 2021 (11:12 hrs)\nPP v Munusamy Ramarmurth[2021] SGHC 255\n30items and that Sara was involved in criminal activities.93 Munusamy\u2019s claim that \nhe did not give much thought as to why he would help Sara to keep stolen \ngoods,94 was unconvincing. I inferred that he did not care to check the contents \nof the Red Bag because he knew what was in it. At the very least, given his \nindifference, he could not be said to believe that the nature of the items in the \nRed Bag was something other than the specific drug that was in it (see [ 31] \nabove). Hence the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA was not rebutted.\n65 Indeed, Munusamy\u2019s failure to find out the contents of the Red Bag is \nto be contrasted with what he claimed he had done during the July 2017 \nIncident. Assuming the July 2017 Incident occurred (which I had rejected), \nMunusamy claimed that he had insisted on checking what was in the \u201cbungkus\u201d \nthat Sara had intended to store in the Box then. Munusamy\u2019s deliberate failure \nto check the contents of the Red Bag must also be looked in the light that on 26 \nJanuary 2018, Sara did not mention what the \u201cpanas\u201d items were but Munusamy \nmerely assumed they were handphones.95\nWhether the Red Bag would be retrieved by the Boy\n66 I also rejected Munusamy\u2019s claim that Sara had informed him that the \nRed Bag would be stored in the Box temporarily and would be collected by the \nsame person (the Boy) who put it there. I found this claim to be a fabrication. \nMunusamy did not mention in any of the Statements that the Red Bag or items \ntherein would be collected by someone later.\n93 29\/7\/21 NE 24\u201326.\n94 27\/7\/21 NE 62; 29\/7\/21 NE 35.\n95 29\/7\/21 NE 2, 53\u201354.\nVersion No 1: 16 Nov 2021 (11:12 hrs)\nPP v Munusamy Ramarmurth[2021] SGHC 255\n3167 In the 1st Statement, Munusamy mentioned that a person put a plastic \nbag inside the Box but did not go further. Munusamy knew as much, which was \nwhy in court he then claimed that the 1st Statement had omitted certain words \nthat he had said to Tony, namely that \u201cthe person said that he would take it \naway\u201d and which I had disbelieved (see [ 34]\u2013[ 37] above).\n68 In the 2nd Statement at A5, Munusamy stated that it was the Boy who \nplaced the Red Bag in his Bike. Munusamy then went on to say (in A6) that \nSara would call him and tell him what to do with the things; and again reiterated \nin the 4th Statement that Sara did not say anything with regard to the items in \nthe Box but that he was to \u201cwait for [Sara] to call\u201d. His statements directly \ncontradicted his claim in court that Sara had informed him that the Boy would \nreturn to retrieve the items after placing them in the Box. Again, in court \nMunusamy sought to challenge the accuracy of the 2nd and 4th Statements, \nwhich I had rejected. I found that he was attempting to refute their contents \nbecause he knew it would run contrary to his defence in court that Sara had said \nthat the Boy would return to retrieve the Red Bag.\n69 As for the 5th Statement, he again did not mention that the Boy would \nreturn to collect the Red Bag although he had mentioned the Boy having left it \nin the Box. By this time, Munusamy knew he was facing a very serious charge \nof drug trafficking and yet he omitted to inform IO Yang of such a material \npoint, if indeed it were true. I disbelieved Munusamy\u2019s explanation that he could \nhave forgotten to mention this because by that time he knew that it contained \ndrugs and he was very \u201cemotional\u201d.96 He could explain in that statement who \nhad put the drugs in the Box, he could even say that the Box was not locked, \nand he could narrate about collecting money and passing it to Sara and even \n96 29\/7\/21 NE 29\u201330.\nVersion No 1: 16 Nov 2021 (11:12 hrs)\nPP v Munusamy Ramarmurth[2021] SGHC 255\n32explain Sara\u2019s relationship to the Boy. Even if Munusamy had forgotten to \nmention in the 5th Statement that the Boy would retrieve the Red Bag because \nhe was at that time very emotional, he had opportunities to do so in the 6th, 7th \nand 8th Statements, where he narrated matters pertaining to Sara, the Boy and \neven Mustaqim, and where the Red Bag or its contents were also mentioned. \nYet he never once mentioned that the Boy would return to retrieve the Red Bag.\n70 Munusamy\u2019s failure to mention that the Boy would retrieve the Red Bag \nfrom the Box, in any of his Statements and until he testified in court, led me to \nconclude that his story in this regard was made up.\nWhether the Box of the Bike was locked or unlocked\n71 That Munusamy\u2019s claim that the Boy would return to retrieve the Red \nBag was a fabrication was supported further by the fact that the Box was locked \nwhen Nasrulhaq first attempted to open it after Munusamy\u2019s arrest.\n72 During the trial, Munusamy claimed that he had left the Box of the Bike \nunlocked when he arrived at the Carpark on 26 January 2018 and went to work. \nMunusamy claimed that the Boy had locked the Box after he put the \u201cpanas\u201d \nitem (the Red Bag) inside it, and Munusamy went to the Bike at about 1.40pm \nto unlock it for the Boy to be able to retrieve the Red Bag. Hence after taking \nout the White Package from the Box, he closed the lid of the Box but did not \nlatch the lid to the Box much less lock the Box.97 \n73 A relevant issue was thus the mechanics of locking the Box. During an \nexamination of the Bike and Box in the course of the trial, the following were \n97 30\/7\/21 NE 25.\nVersion No 1: 16 Nov 2021 (11:12 hrs)\nPP v Munusamy Ramarmurth[2021] SGHC 255\n33undisputed.98 Essentially, the Box is not necessarily locked when it is closed or \nwhen the lid is latched. Whether the Box can be locked depends on the position \nof the keyhole of the Box, and one must insert the key into the keyhole to change \nthe keyhole position. The following were observed:\n(a) For the Box to be completely closed, some pressure must be \napplied to push the lid of the Box downwards until it is latched to the \nBox. \n(b) For the Box to be locked after the lid is latched to it, the keyhole \nmust be in a vertical position, either before or when the lid of the Box is \nlatched to the Box or by turning the keyhole from a horizontal to vertical \nposition after latching the lid to the Box. \n(c) The Box is not locked even if the lid is closed and latched, if the \nkeyhole is in a horizontal position. In this scenario, the Box can be \nopened by unlatching the lid and lifting the lid up. The lid is unlatched \nby pressing the red button (\u201cthe Button\u201d) above the keyhole. \n(d) If the Box is locked (ie, the lid is latched with the keyhole in a \nvertical position) it cannot be opened by merely unlatching the lid or \npressing the Button. To open the Box, it must first be unlocked by \ninserting the key into the keyhole to turn the keyhole to the horizontal \nposition. \n74 The Prosecution claimed that Munusamy had locked the Box after he \ntook out the White Package and that his assertion that he left the Box unlocked \nwas made up to support his defence that the Boy would return to collect the Red \n98 30\/7\/21 NE 7\u201316.\nVersion No 1: 16 Nov 2021 (11:12 hrs)\nPP v Munusamy Ramarmurth[2021] SGHC 255\n34Bag.99 I found Munusamy\u2019s claim that he left the Box unlocked (after retrieving \nthe White Package) to allow the Boy to retrieve the Red Bag to be a fabrication \nand contradicted by the evidence. \n75 Nasrulhaq attested that the Box was locked because when he first \nattempted to pry open it, he found it locked; and thus he had to insert a key into \nthe keyhole, turn the keyhole and then open the Box. I accepted Nasrulhaq\u2019s \ntestimony. This is supported by James and Tony who attested that they saw \nNasrulhaq use a key to open the Box.100 Nasrulhaq would not have needed to \nuse the key to turn the keyhole if the Box was indeed unlocked.101 If the Box \nwas unlocked but latched, it could be open just by pressing the Button and lifting \nthe cover of the Box. But that was not even Munusamy\u2019s case. Munusamy \nclaimed that after retrieving the White Package, he had closed the lid down \n\u201clightly\u201d and did not even latch the lid to the Box. If that were true, Narsulhaq \nwould have had even less difficulty opening the Box because (and it was \nundisputed) little strength would be required to do so as the lid could be easily \nlifted off the Box with one finger.102\n76 Mr Lukshumayeh suggested that Nasrulhaq could have accidentally \npushed the lid down and caused the Box to be locked, when he first attempted \nto pry open the Box.103 I rejected this suggestion as it was without basis. It was \nunlikely that Nasrulhaq would have pushed the lid downwards (which would \nalso have required some pressure to latch the lid to the Box and cause it to lock) \n99 28\/7\/21 NE 80.\n100 AB 209 (Tony\u2019s Statement at [9]); AB 231 (James\u2019 Statement at [7]); 5\/5\/21 NE 76.\n101 6\/5\/21 NE 50\u201351, 80\u201381; 23\/7\/21 NE 14\u201315.\n102 30\/7\/21 NE 16\u201317, 25.\n103 23\/7\/21 NE 15; 30\/7\/21 NE 31.\nVersion No 1: 16 Nov 2021 (11:12 hrs)\nPP v Munusamy Ramarmurth[2021] SGHC 255\n35whilst attempting to move the lid upwards to open the Box.  In any event, if \nMunusamy claimed that he had not even latched the Box, Nasrulhaq would have \nhad little, if any, difficulty lifting the lid off the Box. Yet, Nasrulhaq had attested \nthat when he first attempted to lift the lid, he could not.\n77 Next, for Munusamy to unlock the Box at around 1.40pm, he would have \nhad to turn the keyhole from vertical to horizontal position. If the keyhole had \nbeen in a horizontal position, the Box could have been opened merely by \nunlatching the lid. The keyhole would have remained in the same position as \nMunusamy left it, as there would have been no reason for it to be turned back \nto vertical position, given his claim that he did not even latch the Box let alone \nlock it after he removed the White Package. \n78 However, the photographs taken of the Box showed otherwise \u2013 that the \nBox was locked when Munusamy was arrested and first brought to the Bike. \nTony attested that before Nasrulhaq attempted to open the Box, he took a photo \n(Photo 68) of the Box.104 Photo 68 showed the lid of the Box to be closed and \nthe keyhole in a vertical position. Tony attested that after Nasrulhaq had \nunlocked and opened the Box, he took another photo (Photo 69). Photo 69 \nshowed the key inserted into the keyhole, which is in a horizontal position. The \nDefence did not challenge Tony\u2019s evidence on the condition of the Box and \nkeyhole before and after Nasrulhaq inserted the key to unlock and open the Box.\n79 In support of his claim that the Box was unlocked when he first parked \nthe Bike at the Carpark and also after he retrieved the White Package and closed \nthe Box, Munusamy claimed that he always left the Box unlocked as it would \n104 AB 209 (Tony\u2019s Statement at [9]).\nVersion No 1: 16 Nov 2021 (11:12 hrs)\nPP v Munusamy Ramarmurth[2021] SGHC 255\n36be easier for Customs officers to do checks when he entered Singapore.105 \nHowever, his testimony that he always left the Box unlocked was inherently \ninconsistent. In court, Munusamy claimed that after he had parked the Bike at \nthe Carpark, he opened the Box by unlocking it to take out his personal \nbelongings and then he closed the Box without locking it.106 He also stated that \nhe would keep the Box unlocked unless there was an item inside the Box.107 \nStrangely, Munusamy\u2019s claim that he would always leave the Box unlocked to \nfacilitate checks by Customs officers did not seem to apply to another box at the \nfront of the Bike which he claimed he would lock.108\n80 I thus found that, contrary to his claim, Munusamy had locked the Box \nafter he had retrieved the White Package. The evidence, particularly Photo 68, \nshowed that the Box was locked at the time the CNB officers sought to search \nthe contents. This would thus demolish his defence that the Boy (or someone \nelse) would return to retrieve the Red Bag. If Munusamy had locked the Box, \nno one else would have been able to open it to retrieve the Red Bag.\n81 It also bears mentioning that Munusamy\u2019s credibility in relation to the \nmechanics of the Box left much to be desired. He claimed that he did not know \nthat he could open the Box (if latched but the keyhole was in horizontal position) \nmerely by pressing the Button without using a key, and he claimed that he only \nknew this during the examination conducted of the Box at trial. He further \nclaimed that he did not know that if the lid was latched to the Box and it was \nlocked (because the keyhole is in vertical position) that it could not be opened \n105 27\/7\/21 NE 57; 28\/7\/21 NE 49.\n106 27\/7\/21 NE 55\u201356.\n107 28\/7\/21 NE 54.\n108 AB 294 (7th Statement at [21]).\nVersion No 1: 16 Nov 2021 (11:12 hrs)\nPP v Munusamy Ramarmurth[2021] SGHC 255\n37without using a key (to turn the keyhole to the horizontal position).109 This was \nunbelievable and contradicted by his own evidence that he had to use a key to \nunlock the Box (at about 1.40pm on 26 January 2018) after he claimed the Boy \nhad accidentally locked it. Also, Munusamy had had the Bike for around six \nmonths prior to his arrest, he rode it regularly to work, and I had found that he \nwould sometimes lock the Box (see [ 79] above). I found that he attempted to \nfeign ignorance of the mechanics of the Box to support his story that he closed \nthe Box without latching so as to enable the Boy to open it subsequently.  \nPossession of the Drugs for the purpose of trafficking\n82 I was also satisfied that the Prosecution had proved beyond a reasonable \ndoubt that Munusamy was in possession of the Drugs for the purpose of \ntrafficking. The Drugs were not for Munusamy\u2019s consumption and Munusamy \nhimself stated that he did not consume diamorphine.110 Prosecution submitted \nthat in any event, the intention to traffic could be inferred from the sheer amount \nof the Drugs (diamorphine) found in Munusamy\u2019s possession.111 \n83 The definition of \u201ctraffic\u201d under s 2 of the MDA means \u201cto sell, give, \nadminister, transport, send, deliver or distribute\u201d or to offer to do anything as \nsuch.

{"casename":"2021_SGHC_26","fact":"'2\\u2003The second defendant in the Suit, K P Builder Pte Ltd (\u201c2D\u201d), was engaged as the main contractor for a construction project at 22 Grove Crescent (\u201cProject\u201d). At the material time, the 2D engaged the first defendant, Interpro Construction Pte Ltd (\u201c1D\u201d), as its sub-contractor to carry out general construction works, including certain excavation works, at the Project\u2019s worksite. The two companies share a common director.', '3\\u2003The plaintiff was a construction worker in the employment of the 1D. The 1D also appointed one Panchanathan Santhosh Kumar (\u201cSanthosh\u201d) as the foreman and site safety supervisor for the Project. Santhosh reported to one Ong Siaw Meng (\u201cOng\u201d), the Project\u2019s project manager and an employee of the 1D. In respect of the excavation works for the Project, the 1D deployed Santhosh as the site supervisor and foreman and five other workers (including the plaintiff) to work under Santhosh\u2019s supervision.', '4\\u2003For the excavation works at the Project\u2019s worksite, the 2D also engaged the third defendant, Hwa Aik Engineering Pte. Ltd. (\u201c3D\u201d), to supply an excavator and a trained and qualified excavator operator at a daily rate of $300. Pursuant to this arrangement, the 3D provided an excavator and an excavator operator, that being Sujan. Sujan was to work under the directions of the 1D at the worksite. Outside of this arrangement, the 3D was Sujan\u2019s general employer.', '5\\u2003Before turning to the accident, it is helpful to explain the \u201cbanksman system\u201d which was allegedly put in place by the 1D during the excavation works. As explained by Santhosh in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief (\u201cAEIC\u201d), the \u201cbanksman system\u201d is a simple system of signals meant to direct the movement of an excavator. A person on the ground, known as a \u201cbanksman\u201d, would be responsible for giving signals to the person operating the excavator. For example, upon the banksman blowing his whistle once and showing the appropriate hand-signal to the excavator operator, the latter would stop the excavator and bring the excavator\u2019s bucket to rest on the ground. The operator was to ensure that the excavator remained stationary until the banksman blew the whistle twice and showed the appropriate hand-signal for the excavator operator to move the excavator again.', '6\\u2003Based on the DJ\u2019s Grounds of Decision (\u201cGD\u201d), the DJ pieced together the following version of events in respect of the accident on 31 May 2016. Around 4.30pm that day, a certain area at the Project\u2019s worksite had just been excavated. At that time, only Santhosh (ie, the foreman), the plaintiff and Sujan (ie, the excavator operator) were in the immediate vicinity of the excavated pit. The DJ accepted that Santhosh had first instructed the plaintiff to direct Sujan to stop the excavator. The plaintiff accordingly blew his whistle once and gave the appropriate hand-signal to Sujan. Sujan then brought the excavator\u2019s bucket to rest on the ground and stopped operating the excavator. The DJ stated that Santhosh then went into the excavated pit and noted that there was \u201cstill [some] earth in the innermost parts within the pit which had to be removed by the use of a spade\u201d. Hence, \u201cSanthosh\u2026instructed [the plaintiff] to fetch a spade from the toolbox near the entrance of the Project\u2019s worksite\u201d. Thereafter, the plaintiff went to fetch the spade. He walked near the excavator on his way to fetching the spade, at which point the excavator (operated by Sujan) moved and collided into him. The plaintiff was pinned under the metal wheel-track of the excavator and suffered various personal injuries including a spinal fracture.', '7\\u2003At the hearing below, the plaintiff claimed that the 1D and 2D were directly liable to him for negligence and breach of various statutory duties. The plaintiff also claimed that all three defendants were vicariously liable for Santhosh\u2019s and\/or Sujan\u2019s negligence during the accident.'"}

When he noticed a police roadblock along Crawford Street, he stopped his motorcar about 50m before the \u201cPolice Stop\u201d sign and then made a three-point turn in an attempt to evade the roadblock. Wu then travelled against the flow of traffic for at least 140m. The police officers on duty gave chase and eventually caught up with him.', '5\\u2003When Wu was apprehended, the officers observed that he reeked of alcohol. A preliminary breath test was administered and, having failed that test, Wu was arrested at the scene. The Breath Analysing Device test conducted at the Traffic Police Headquarters revealed that he had 46 microgrammes of alcohol per 100ml of breath, which was above the prescribed limit of 35 microgrammes of alcohol per 100ml of breath.', '6\\u2003As a consequence, Wu was charged with one count of drink driving under s 67(1)(b) read with s 67(2)(a) of the RTA, as well as one count of reckless driving under s 64(1) punishable under s 64(2C)(a) read with ss 64(2C)(c) and 64(2D)(i) of the RTA.', '7\\u2003Wu pleaded guilty to both charges on 30 October 2020. In respect of each of the charges, he was sentenced to 17 days\u2019 imprisonment and disqualified from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of 42 months. The disqualification period for the drink driving charge, however, took effect from the date of his release while the disqualification period for the reckless driving charge took effect from 30 October 2020. I note that pursuant to s 64(8) of the RTA, the disqualification period for the latter offence should also have taken effect from the date of his release from imprisonment, although this did not, in the event, make a difference in relation to Wu given that disqualification periods were imposed for each of the two offences.', '8\\u2003The pertinent portions of s 64 of the RTA provide as follows:', '9\\u2003Section 67 of the RTA provides as follows:', '10\\u2003Because of the complex architecture of these sections of the RTA, I consider it appropriate to begin with the principal changes that were effected by the amendments that I have referred to at [2] above and the legislative intent behind them. The present iteration of the offence under s 64 of the RTA was enacted on 1 November 2019, following the passing of the Road Traffic (Amendment) Act 2019 (Act 19 of 2019) (the \u201cAmendment Act\u201d). Under the Amendment Act, two changes were effected that are relevant to my decision. First, the Amendment Act amended the punishments applicable under ss 64(1) and 67(1) of the previous version of the RTA (the \u201c2019 RTA\u201d). Second, it substituted ss 64(2)\u2013(3) and 67(2) of the 2019 RTA, with ss 64(2)\u2013(3) and 67(2)\u2013(2A) respectively, and inserted ss 64(6)\u2013(8) and 67(4), as reproduced above.', '11\\u2003Sections 64 and 67 of the 2019 RTA had provided as follows:', '12\\u2003The Amendment Act arose out of what was described as a \u201ctimely\u201d review of the RTA, and it aimed to provide stronger deterrence against irresponsible driving, according to the explanation presented by the Second Minister for Home Affairs, Mrs Josephine Teo (the \u201cMinister\u201d) to Parliament on 8 July 2019 (Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (8 July 2019), vol 94). The reforms enhanced the penalties for irresponsible driving and tightened the regulatory regime against irresponsible driving. The overarching object of the amendments was the consolidation and streamlining of the offences pertaining to irresponsible driving. The Minister set this out in clear terms as follows:', '13\\u2003Specifically, the Minister explained the amendment to s 64 as follows:', '14\\u2003The Amendment Act also affected the provisions dealing with drink driving. The Minister\u2019s explanation of this was as follows:', '15\\u2003Three aspects of these amendments bear emphasis. First, the Amendment Act envisaged a new scheme of penalties for reckless or dangerous driving in a tiered structure calibrated according to the degree of hurt caused (as set out in the Minister\u2019s explanation, above at [12]). This scheme is now set out in ss 64(2) to 64(2C) of the RTA, calibrated according to whether the harm caused is death, grievous hurt or hurt and then any other case, which includes cases of non-personal injury or potential harm. By doing so, Parliament has expressly taken into consideration the broad range of actual and potential consequences arising from reckless or dangerous driving. Specific ranges of punishments are prescribed for each category of harm; the more serious the harm caused, the harsher the penalties naturally are. This is most evident in s 64(2)(a), which is the provision that applies when death is caused, and under which the prescribed punishment for an offender is an imprisonment term of not less than two years and not more than eight years. In comparison, where simple hurt is caused, pursuant to s 64(2B)(a), the offender is liable for a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment of up to 2 years or both.', '16\\u2003Second, Parliament also intended to prescribe stiffer penalties for the offence of drink driving, as reflected in the passage from the Minister\u2019s explanation set out at [14] above. Third, the penalties were further enhanced where drink driving occurred in conjunction with reckless or dangerous driving, through the introduction of the \u201cserious offender\u201d provisions. Specifically, this is provided for in subsection (c) of each of ss 64(2), (2A), (2B) and (2C) read with s 64(8), the latter of which defines a serious offender as one who has also been convicted of certain other offences including drink driving under s 67. As the Minister made clear, the enhanced punishment provision also applies in instances where no hurt is caused, which is now provided for in s 64(2C)(c) of the RTA.', '17\\u2003This wide range of changes underscored Parliament\u2019s aim to deter acts of reckless or dangerous driving and drink driving, and to reduce the \u201cdeadly consequences\u201d of such acts. The increased penalties were designed to \u201cmake our roads safer\u201d, as the Minister stated at the outset of her speech, and which was reiterated by the Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Home Affairs, Ms Sun Xueling, at the end of her speech.'"}

She was the sole proprietor of C Paglar & Co (\u201cCPC\u201d) at all material times.', '5\\u2003On or around 5 October 2017, one Lim Beng Heng Bernard (\u201cMr Lim\u201d) engaged CPC to make a claim for damages for personal injuries he had sustained in a road traffic accident. On 21 March 2018, CPC issued a letter of demand to India International Insurance Pte Ltd (\u201cIII\u201d), the insurer of the motor vehicle that was involved in the accident, for a sum of $9,418.05, inclusive of $2,996 as costs.', '6\\u2003Between 20 April 2018 and 7 June 2018, CPC and III exchanged three settlement offers. For present purposes, it is not necessary to delve into the details of each of those settlement offers. It suffices for us to highlight that those settlement offers all contained a breakdown of the specific sums being offered for general damages, medical expenses, transport expenses, costs and disbursements. In other words, those settlement offers were not negotiated on a purely global basis.', '7\\u2003In particular, III had, on 7 June 2018, made a settlement offer of $3,281.35, which sum was inclusive of $1,605 in costs and disbursements (\u201cthe 7 June Proposal\u201d). By way of a letter dated 11 June 2018, the respondent informed Mr Lim of the 7 June Proposal and advised him that the aforementioned proposal was \u201creasonable\u201d and ought to be \u201cseriously considered for acceptance\u201d. She also explained to him that, should he accept the 7 June Proposal, he would be entitled to $1,552 in damages and that he would receive a net amount of $1,017 after legal costs had been deducted. On 13 June 2018, Mr Lim instructed the respondent to accept the 7 June Proposal on his behalf.', '8\\u2003The respondent, however, did not communicate Mr Lim\u2019s acceptance of the 7 June Proposal to III. Instead, she proceeded to make a settlement offer to III for a global sum of $4,000 on 21 June 2018 (\u201cthe 21 June Offer\u201d). III then made a counter-offer of a global settlement sum of $3,800 (\u201cthe Final Offer\u201d), which CPC accepted on 26 June 2018. Crucially, the respondent did not inform Mr Lim that she had made the 21 June Offer or that she had accepted the Final Offer. The 21 June Offer also marked the first time that either CPC or III had made a settlement offer on a purely global basis; as mentioned above at [6], the prior settlement offers all had accompanying breakdowns of the sums being offered.', '9\\u2003The respondent explained that while III had offered what she regarded as a reasonable quantum of damages in its 7 June Proposal, she felt that III\u2019s offer of $1,605 in costs and disbursements was unreasonably low and was not in line with the costs guidelines for personal injury claims. She had thus made the 21 June Offer in an attempt \u201cto bring [III\u2019s] offer on party-and-party costs and disbursements in line with the costs guidelines\u201d.', '10\\u2003Following CPC\u2019s acceptance of the Final Offer, III sent CPC a discharge voucher for the sum of $3,800 (\u201cthe Discharge Voucher\u201d). The respondent then forwarded the Discharge Voucher to Mr Lim for his signature but did not provide an explanation or breakdown of the sum of $3,800.', '11\\u2003Upon receipt of the Discharge Voucher, Mr Lim noticed that the settlement sum stated therein was $3,800 instead of $3,281.35 per the 7 June Proposal, but there had not been a corresponding increase in the compensation sum awarded to him. He contacted CPC to request a breakdown of the figure of $3,800, only to be rebuffed by CPC\u2019s staff. Mr Lim was particularly concerned that the respondent could have negotiated a higher settlement sum without his authorisation and\/or fabricated the 7 June Proposal, and pocketed the difference of $518.65. Frustrated that no explanation for the settlement sum of $3,800 was forthcoming, he did not sign the Discharge Voucher and subsequently filed a complaint against the respondent with the Council of the Law Society.'"}

They were the owners of a group of companies (the \u201cGroup\u201d) of which the second plaintiff, BTO, is the principal holding company. BTO is an online travel agency incorporated in Malaysia. On 26 September 2012, the defendants, along with two other owners of the Group entered into the SPA with the first plaintiff, BTN. BTN is a publicly listed company incorporated in Mauritius. Pursuant to the SPA, BTN acquired 100% ownership and control of the Group at both the shareholder and board level.', '11\\u2003 The consideration to be paid to the defendants for the acquisition comprised two elements: a \u201cGuaranteed Minimum Consideration\u201d of US$25m and the Earn Outs. The Earn Outs element depended on, among others, the financial performance of the Group in the financial years 2013, 2014 and 2015, calibrated based on different levels of \u201cEarn Out Targets\u201d for each financial year as specified in the SPA, up to a maximum amount of US$35m.', '12\\u2003The SPA also stipulated that the defendants had to be employed by BTO. The employment of the defendants was governed by the respective \u201cPromoter Employment Agreements\u201d (the \u201cPEAs\u201d), unsigned versions of which were annexed to the SPA. Pursuant to the PEAs signed in November 2012, BTP, the first defendant, was employed as the Chief Executive Officer and BTQ, the second defendant, as the Chief Technical Officer. The PEAs were signed by the respective defendants as employees, by BTO as the employer and by BTN as the confirming party; the PEAs were governed by Malaysian law.', '13\\u2003The SPA and PEAs contained materially identical provisions with regard to the defendants\u2019 \u201cWith Cause\u201d and \u201cWithout Cause\u201d termination. Clause 15.1.2 in both PEAs, governing Without Cause termination, stated:', '14\\u2003The effect of cl 12.9.2 of the SPA (referred to in cl 15.1.2 of the PEAs set out above) read with cl 12.10.1(a) of the SPA was that:', '(a)\\u2003 if the dismissals of the defendants were Without Cause, they would (subject to compliance with certain conditions precedent) be entitled to a maximum of US$35m in Earn Outs; and', '(b)\\u2003if the dismissals of the defendants were With Cause, then they would not be entitled to any Earn Outs.', '15\\u2003Upon completion of the sale of the Group, the defendants ceased to be directors of BTO. In their place, three senior executives of BTN were appointed as directors, a Mr [K] being one of the three. Mr [K] was the Group Chief Financial Officer and a director of BTN. He was also a director of BTO at all material times.', '16\\u2003On 8 January 2014, BTO issued termination letters to the defendants, dismissing them from their posts \u201cpursuant to Clause 15.2.1 of the [PEAs] and Clause 12.9.1 of the [SPA]\u201d (the \u201cTermination Letters\u201d), citing various grounds of With Cause termination.', '17\\u2003The defendants took the view that they had been wrongfully dismissed and decided to take action against BTO by invoking certain remedies that Malaysian law makes available to disgruntled employees. On 13 February 2014, the defendants made representations to the Director General of Industrial Relations, Malaysia (the \u201cDirector General\u201d), pursuant to the procedure prescribed under s 20 of the Industrial Relations Act 1967 (No 177 of 1967) (M\u2019sia) (\u201cIRA\u201d). Where a workman considers that he has been dismissed without just cause or excuse by his employer, the procedure under s 20 of the IRA allows the workman to make representations to the Director General, who may in turn notify the Malaysian Minister for Industrial Relations. Under s 20(3) of the IRA, the Minister may, if he thinks fit, refer the representations to the Malaysian Industrial Court (\u201cMIC\u201d) for an award.', '18\\u2003The Director General then sent letters dated 7 March 2014 to BTO (at its registered address in Malaysia) and the defendants, requesting them to attend a conciliation meeting. An e-mail was sent on the same day to BTO\u2019s manager, one Mr [C], and two other BTO employees, inviting them to the conciliation meeting. According to the plaintiffs, Mr [C] was then the only employee at BTO\u2019s office in Malaysia. All its other employees were based in, and operated out of, Thailand and India. Correspondence to BTO was sent to its registered address and collected from this address by Mr [C]. He was responsible for keeping BTO\u2019s senior management apprised of this correspondence as well as keeping them aware of all developments in Malaysia.', '19\\u2003The conciliation meeting was attended by the defendants, and by Mr [C] and Mr [K] as representatives of BTO. While Mr [K] was representing BTO at that meeting, he still occupied his position on the BTN board. No settlement was reached at the conciliation meeting, and the cases were referred to the MIC on 8 August 2014 (collectively, \u201cthe MIC Proceedings\u201d). The defendants and BTO were copied in on the referral letters. From October 2014 to January 2015, the MIC fixed and then adjourned the hearings of the cases before it multiple times due to the non-attendance of BTO. In the process, numerous notices of the MIC Proceedings and various related documents were sent to BTO via registered post to its registered office. In the end, the hearings in respect of the defendants\u2019 cases proceeded, in BTO\u2019s absence, in March and May 2015.', '20\\u2003Following the hearings, two Awards were issued by the MIC against BTO on 6 April 2015 and 29 July 2015 respectively in favour of the defendants (collectively, the \u201cMIC Awards\u201d). The MIC found that the defendants\u2019 dismissals had been \u201cwithout just cause or excuse\u201d under s 20 of the IRA, and accordingly awarded them compensatory remedies based on their monthly salaries. The reasoning in the MIC Awards was essentially that the burden of proof was on BTO to justify the defendants\u2019 dismissals based on the allegations in the Termination Letters. Given that BTO elected not to appear, the evidence of the defendants on the wrongfulness of their dismissals remained unrebutted and their dismissals were accordingly held to be unjustified and without just cause or excuse.', '21\\u2003Subsequent to the MIC Awards, repeated letters from the defendants to BTO demanding payment of the compensation awarded were ignored. On 19 November 2015, the defendants commenced non-compliance proceedings under the IRA against BTO. Both sets of non-compliance proceedings were fixed for a mention hearing on 30 December 2015. Notice of the same was sent to BTO but BTO did not attend either mention hearing. The hearing of the non-compliance applications was fixed on 17 February 2016 and notice of the same was also served on BTO.', '22\\u2003According to BTO, it was only on 16 February 2016, a day before the non-compliance hearing, that Mr [C] notified the relevant BTO senior personnel, for the first time, of the hearing notices. Up till then, although he had collected the same from BTO\u2019s registered office, Mr [C] had kept all the correspondence away from BTN\u2019s senior management. On 17 February 2016, BTO appeared at the hearing through its counsel. BTO does not dispute that all the various notices mentioned above were validly served on it at BTO\u2019s registered address in Malaysia.', '23\\u2003By two further awards dated 1 March 2016, the MIC ordered BTO to pay the defendants the sums ordered under the MIC Awards within 30 days. The MIC also stated that at the 17 February 2016 hearing, BTO\u2019s counsel had initially requested an adjournment of the hearing. After hearing the defendants\u2019 grounds for objecting to the adjournment, namely, that the time to file any judicial review applications against the MIC Awards had long lapsed, BTO\u2019s counsel agreed that there was no point in having the adjournment and conceded that any adjournment would further delay proceedings.', '24\\u2003On 21 April 2016, BTO wrote to the President of the MIC (copying the defendants\u2019 solicitors) to inform the MIC that BTO had complied with the MIC Awards and effected full payment as required. BTO also conveyed its apologies for its absence at the MIC Proceedings and explained that \u201cthe fact of the said proceedings have [sic] been inexplicably withheld from [BTO], [which was] an internal\/domestic issue which [BTO was] currently addressing\u201d.', '25\\u2003On 31 May 2016, the defendants\u2019 solicitors wrote to the plaintiffs demanding payment of sums alleged by the defendants to be due to them as Earn Outs, totalling US$35m. No payment was made by the plaintiffs. On 12 July 2016, the defendants commenced arbitration proceedings against the plaintiffs under the SPA, claiming that they were dismissed Without Cause and were therefore entitled to receive Earn Outs in the sum of US$35m. The Tribunal was constituted to conduct the arbitration.', '26\\u2003In the arbitration proceedings, the plaintiffs took the position that the dismissals were With Cause and put forward various bases in support of this. Apart from defending the claim, the plaintiffs also filed a counterclaim against the defendants. The defendants responded that issues dealing with cause of termination were res judicata by virtue of the MIC Awards (\u201cthe Res Judicata Issue\u201d) and that as a matter of construction of the SPA and the PEAs, a determination under the PEAs by the MIC that the dismissals of the defendants were Without Cause was binding for the purposes of the SPA (\u201cthe Construction Issue\u201d).', '27\\u2003In a procedural order issued on 13 March 2017, the Tribunal set out the timetable for the arbitration, which included timelines for the filing of pleadings and the production of documents. It also fixed the hearing dates of the arbitration to take place from 6 December 2017 to 8 December 2017. In early November 2017, certain events occurred as a result of which the defendants applied for an adjournment of the hearing. On 27 November 2017, the Tribunal informed the parties that it was inclined to adjourn the hearing on evidentiary or factual issues but was willing to proceed with a hearing on legal issues alone if the parties were agreeable. The evidentiary hearing was formally adjourned on 28 November 2017. Thereafter, parties were able to agree on the legal issues to be determined, and on 29 November 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 5 setting out the agreed list of legal issues as follows:', '28\\u2003The Tribunal further explained that the hearing was meant to \u201chear discrete issues on points of law insofar that they could be entirely divorced from factual matters\u201d, and it had become apparent that \u201cthere were potentially determinative points of law capable of resolution in this way, that the parties were aware of those points of law and were fully prepared to argue them\u201d.', '29\\u2003The Tribunal duly conducted the hearing on legal issues on 6 and 7 December 2017. Queen\u2019s Counsel appeared at the hearing for both parties. They made submissions in two rounds and in response to questions from the Tribunal. Further, expert evidence on Mauritian law was presented and each party\u2019s expert was cross-examined by counsel. At the close of the hearing, all counsel agreed that there should be no post-hearing memorials.', '30\\u2003In the First Partial Award, the Tribunal dealt with the Construction Issue and the Res Judicata Issue. On the Construction Issue, the Tribunal considered the characteristics of the SPA and the PEAs and concluded that \u201cthe PEAs and the SPA \u2026 [were] closely interconnected parts of the same transaction\u201d. The Tribunal further decided that termination Without Cause under the PEAs meant the same thing as termination Without Cause under the SPA, and vice versa. On the Res Judicata Issue, the Tribunal held that both the plaintiffs were prevented from arguing that the defendants were terminated With Cause under the SPA and PEAs by the doctrine of issue estoppel under Singapore law, as the question of whether this had occurred was essentially the same as the issue that the MIC had already determined.', '31\\u2003The effect of the First Partial Award was that the plaintiffs would not be able to adduce evidence in the arbitration proceedings to make out their assertion that the defendants were terminated With Cause and therefore, among others, were not entitled to the Earn Outs. In OS 683, the plaintiffs sought the following:', '(a)\\u2003a declaration, pursuant to s 10(3)(b) of the International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (\u201cIAA\u201d), that the Tribunal had jurisdiction to determine whether the defendants were terminated Without Cause for the purposes of the SPA;', '(b)\\u2003in the alternative, a setting aside of the First Partial Award with respect to both the plaintiffs pursuant to:', '(c)\\u2003in the further alternative, a setting aside of the First Partial Award with respect to BTN only.', '32\\u2003On 16 September 2019, Ang J delivered the Judgment and dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 application entirely. In brief, the learned Judge held that the First Partial Award was not a ruling on jurisdiction, because neither the Construction Issue nor the Res Judicata Issue was a jurisdictional issue (Judgment at [45], [52], [78] and [79]). The learned Judge also held that there was no breach of natural justice, nor did the Tribunal breach the parties\u2019 agreed arbitral procedure or exceed its jurisdiction (Judgment at [92]\u2013[99]). All that occurred was that there was a disagreement between the parties as to the ambit of the requirement of identity of subject matter, and the Tribunal had preferred the defendants\u2019 position on issue estoppel (Judgment at [101]\u2013[102]). The Tribunal was tasked with determining whether the findings of the MIC were contractually binding and had res judicata effect, and the Tribunal decided the very matters submitted to it, namely, the Construction Issue and the Res Judicata Issue (Judgment at [108]). Ang J further held that the First Partial Award was not contrary to the public policy of Singapore, as the plaintiffs were not prevented from having their case heard and there was no wrongdoing on the part of the defendants in commencing proceedings in the MIC (Judgment at [116] and [117]). The argument that the First Partial Award should be set aside with respect to BTN was also rejected (Judgment at [119]).', '33\\u2003On 20 September 2019, the plaintiffs sought leave, pursuant to s 10(4) of the IAA, to appeal against Ang J\u2019s finding that the Tribunal\u2019s rulings on the Construction Issue and the Res Judicata Issue were not jurisdictional decisions. On 9 January 2019, the learned Judge refused leave to appeal. On 26 September 2019, the plaintiffs appealed against the rest of the Judgment.', '34\\u2003In the appeal, the plaintiffs submitted that Ang J erred in dismissing their application to set aside the First Partial Award. Before the Court of Appeal, the plaintiffs advanced the same arguments that had been canvassed before the High Court, namely: that there had been a breach of natural justice which had prejudiced them; that it would be contrary to public policy to enforce the First Partial Award, because it deprived the plaintiffs of the right to put forward their defence to the defendants\u2019 claim and to make their own claim against the defendants; and that the Tribunal failed to decide matters contemplated by and\/or falling within the submission to arbitration. On 23 October 2020, the Court of Appeal, in the Appeal Judgment, dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal.', '35\\u2003As I indicated at [5] above, the arbitration was ongoing even while OS 683 was being heard. In July 2018, the Tribunal conducted a procedural hearing to decide (a) whether to stay the proceedings pending the outcome of OS 683, (b) the scope of the remaining issues to be determined after the First Partial Award and (c) the defendants\u2019 application to bifurcate the remaining claim issues and the counterclaim issues. Parties filed their respective position papers, inter alia, identifying the issues remaining for determination on the claim and counterclaim. Following the procedural hearing on 31 July 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 7 dated 24 August 2018 (\u201cPO No 7\u201d) and ordered the following: 3', '36\\u2003On 3 December 2018, two days before the start of the second oral hearing, a pre-hearing telephone conference was conducted. In their written submissions, the plaintiffs\u2019 defence to the defendants\u2019 claim to the Earn Outs under the SPA was that the defendants had not duly complied with their obligations under the SPA. At the pre-hearing conference, the plaintiffs stated that they would abandon this defence save for the pleaded allegation that the defendants had breached their confidentiality obligations by disclosing confidential information to one Mr [X], a third-party consultant whom the defendants had engaged to advise them on BTO\u2019s business and operations. 4', 'As such, one of the conditions precedent in cl 12.6(ii) of the SPA was not satisfied. The defendants objected to this defence being advanced on the basis that this allegation or defence was not pleaded and was a new allegation.', '37\\u2003Parties agreed that the Confidentiality Pleading Issue would be addressed as a preliminary matter at the start of the hearing on 5 December 2018. The oral hearing was duly conducted on 5 and 6 December 2018. After hearing parties\u2019 submissions on the Confidentiality Pleading Issue on the first day, the Tribunal stood the hearing down, conferred and then proceeded to dismiss the Confidentiality Pleading Issue. Consequently, the Tribunal disallowed the plaintiffs from pursuing this defence at the oral hearing. The Tribunal then proceeded to continue hearing the parties\u2019 cases on the remaining issues for the claim and the counterclaim. On 23 September 2019, the Tribunal formally closed the record for this phase of the proceedings. It also alerted parties that it intended to issue the Second Partial Award and thereafter the Final Award, including the Tribunal\u2019s decision on costs. The Tribunal also indicated that it intended to consult with the parties concerning the remaining issues for submission and the scope of the Final Award. 5', '38\\u2003On 11 October 2019, the Tribunal issued the Second Partial Award. The Tribunal decided that the defendants had satisfied the conditions precedent in cll 12.6(i) and (ii) of the SPA. It concluded that the requirement for an Earn Out Compliance Certificate in cl 12.7 of the SPA was not relevant to a termination of employment Without Cause. Thus, the defendants were entitled to the Earn Outs under the SPA, including the Earn Outs in respect of the 2013 financial year.', '39\\u2003As regards the Counterclaim Preclusion Issue and the plaintiffs\u2019 counterclaim in the arbitration, the defendants contended that the plaintiffs were precluded from arguing that the defendants were terminated With Cause under the SPA and the PEAs or from raising the counterclaim allegations because of the operation of issue estoppel. The Tribunal agreed with the defendants on this. It found that save for a single allegation of misconduct concerning a payment gateway known as Euroline (the \u201cEuroline Counterclaim\u201d) which predated the SPA, all of the other allegations relied upon by the plaintiffs in support of their counterclaim against the defendants were, as a result of the MIC Awards, precluded by the doctrine of issue estoppel applied under Singapore law. The Tribunal also found that there were no special circumstances in the case that would warrant a departure from the application of the doctrine of issue estoppel.', '40\\u2003In its dispositive orders, the Tribunal ordered the plaintiffs to pay the defendants a sum of US$30,796,624, which was the sum of US$35 million claimed by the defendants for the Earn Outs less a sum of US$4,203,376, representing the value of the Euroline Counterclaim which the Tribunal held in reserve pending the substantive determination of the Euroline Counterclaim.', '41\\u2003Following the Second Partial Award, the Tribunal heard arguments on the Euroline Counterclaim and the question of costs on 21 and 22 January 2020. The Tribunal then issued the Final Award on 9 June 2020, in which it dismissed the Euroline Counterclaim. Essentially, the Tribunal found that while the plaintiffs were not time-barred from bringing the Euroline Counterclaim, the Tribunal did not have jurisdiction over the Euroline Counterclaim as it was not pleaded.

In gist, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendant\u2019s acts of, inter alia, importing and selling photocopiers and other printing equipment under each of those marks to members of the public in Singapore, when these were not unmodified photocopiers or other printing equipment, amounted to a misrepresentation to members of the public and was likely to cause confusion to the relevant public by leading them to believe that machines affixed with those marks and sold by the defendant were those manufactured by the plaintiffs or connected to\/associated with the plaintiffs. 66', '35\\u2003The plaintiffs referred to the defendant\u2019s sale of three machines (Offending Machines 4, 5 and 6), bearing the \u201cDocuCentre\u201d mark, as \u201cBRAND NEW\u201d in 2014.

{"casename":"2021_SGHC_273","fact":"'4\\u2003The Appellant, a 39-year-old male, was an insurance agent in his father\u2019s insurance company at the time of the offences. As alluded to above, the Appellant\u2019s multi-faceted and multi-victim scheme was essentially a scam for free sex. Not wanting to pay the rates for commercial sex that he saw online, the Appellant advertised on the website \u201cLocanto\u201d that he was an agent who provided \u201csugar babes\u201d to his wealthy clients. To capture their interest, he told each of the eleven known victims that he had clients who could pay them sums ranging between S$8,000 and S$20,000 a month for companionship, before telling them that in order to successfully secure a \u201csugar daddy\u201d arrangement with one of his clients, they had to send him (the Appellant) their nude photographs. This escalated to the Appellant demanding, again in the name of meeting the requirements of his fictitious wealthy clients, that the victims perform sexual acts with and for him. The Appellant also insisted that he had to record these various acts on a number of different occasions, and demanded to take further nude photographs of a number of the victims. All of these acts were represented to the victims as being \u201cnecessary\u201d so that the victims could be evaluated by the Appellant and his \u201cclients\u201d to determine their \u201csuitability\u201d for the \u201csugar daddy\u201d arrangement. In truth, however, the Appellant did not have any such clients, and all of these representations to the victims were utterly false.', '5\\u2003In furtherance of his deception, the Appellant did the following:', '(a)\\u2003He created (falsified) chat conversations which appeared to be between himself and his clients in order to convince the victims of the veracity of his narrative. Moreover, when he wanted to dupe one particular victim into providing him with free oral sex, he created false chat conversations and sent screenshots of them to that victim. These screenshots depicted his client(s) asking questions about whether that victim was \u201cgood [at] giving oral sex\u201d. The falsified chat conversations were thus directed towards the particular acts the Appellant sought to convince the victim(s) in question to provide him.', '(b)\\u2003He showed the victims photos of nude women and claimed that those women had in fact complied with his demands to send him nude photos of themselves. The Appellant also showed the victims videos of women having sex with him. By doing so, the Appellant would highlight that the victims would be at a disadvantage when seeking to be \u201csugar babes\u201d because the \u201csugar daddies\u201d would not have seen their nude photographs when deciding which \u201csugar babe\u201d to pick, and because he would not be able to tell the \u201csugar daddies\u201d about the victims\u2019 sexual abilities. The Appellant thus used photos and videos of women he alleged were \u201csugar babes\u201d he had linked with his wealthy clients to further his scheme.', '(c)\\u2003The Appellant also made time-specific enticements to the victims if they expressed any reluctance or hesitancy. When a number of his victims expressed reluctance, he falsely represented that a client was travelling to Singapore in a matter of days, and that the said client was eager to meet the potential \u201csugar babe\u201d in question. However, the Appellant would then claim that he had to provide an assessment of the potential \u201csugar babe\u2019s\u201d sexual performance before the client would be willing to meet her. On occasion, the Appellant would also falsely claim that the client in question, who was shortly travelling to Singapore, had paid large sums of money \u2013 in one case S$16,000 \u2013 to his former \u201csugar babes\u201d. These specific enticements and deceptions were aimed at overcoming any reluctance on the part of the victims.', '6\\u2003In addition, the Appellant undertook the following measures to avoid detection:', '(a)\\u2003First, the Appellant made sure to use a false name in order to avoid detection. He went by the pseudonyms \u201cKel\u201d, \u201cDon\u201d, and \u201cOnisac\u201d in order to avoid detection and to prevent his true identity from being known to his victims.', '(b)\\u2003Second, the Appellant pressured at least one of his victims to shift from communicating over WhatsApp to using WeChat, saying \u201cit was safer\u201d to use WeChat.', '(c)\\u2003Third, the Appellant exploited the fact that he held nude photos and\/or videos of the victims to deter any of them from going to the police. The Appellant also seemed to be entirely comfortable with threatening the victims over the potential use (or further abuse) of these photos and\/or videos if they did not comply with his demands. Among other things, the Appellant threatened one particular victim that he was \u201cgoing to flood the Internet with your photo stating that u are looking for sugardaddy [sic]\u201d.

Mr Ravi\u2019s First Affidavit stated that Mr Zuhairi had \nevidence of how the CNB management had discriminated against Malay \npersons generally, and that the particulars of this evidence were as follows:\n(a) CNB officers \u201chave always been arresting more Malays in \ncapital drug trafficking cases disproportionately as compared to other \nraces such as Chinese\u201d.20 \n18 Mr Suhail\u2019s 1st Affidavit at Annex C, p 18.\n19 Mr Suhail\u2019s 1st Affidavit at Annex A, p 9.\n20 Mr Suhail\u2019s 1st Affidavit at Annex D (Mr Ravi\u2019s 1st Affidavit) at para 7(a).\nVersion No 1: 02 Dec 2021 (12:21 hrs)\nSyed Suhail bin Syed Zin v AG [2021] SGHC 274\n8(b) The majority of CNB officers were Malay and spoke the Malay \nlanguage more frequently, and \u201cwould therefore find it easier to \ncommunicate with people of the same race and with the same frequency \nof communication\u201d.21\n(c) Flowing from (b) above, \u201ca substantial number of informers who \ntipped off the CNB officers are Malays, and they would generally report \nagainst Malay drug trafficking suspects\u201d.22\n(d) CNB officers \u201ctend to seek out Malay informers who can provide \ninformation on Malay drug trafficking suspects, and did not put in \nproportionate effort to seek out Chinese informers to request for \ninformation on Chinese drug trafficking suspects\u201d.23 \n(e) The majority of the higher-ranking members of the CNB were \nChinese, and Mr Zuhairi \u201chad seen instances where Chinese drug \ntrafficking suspects were given favourable treatment as compared to \nMalay drug trafficking suspects, as these high-ranking officers also find \nit easier to speak with people of the same race (ie, Chinese) and with the \nsame frequency of communication\u201d.

In the Eighth \nPolice Report (which was the third report filed by Mr Zuhairi on 24 September \n2021), Mr Zuhairi denied having made the statements set out at [ 12(a)], [ 12(d)], \n[12(e)] and [ 12(f)] above.26 Mr Zuhairi said that the statement at [ 12(e)], that \n\u201cChinese drug trafficking suspects were given favourable treatment as \ncompared to Malay drug trafficking suspects\u201d, was only a partial truth as he had \nnot specifically mentioned the word \u201ctrafficking\u201d.27 More fundamentally, this \nassertion was in any event general and unparticularised, and did not show that \nMr Zuhairi was able to provide any concrete evidence on the specific matters \nraised by the plaintiffs in OS 825. The statements that Mr Zuhairi did not deny \nrelated only to the majority of CNB officers finding it easier to communicate \nwith Malay persons ([ 12(b)] above) and informers reporting against Malay drug \ntrafficking suspects ([ 12(c)] above), neither of which went towards \nsubstantiating the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations in OS 825. Further affidavits were filed \nby Mr Ravi, his paralegal, and his knowledge manager to contradict \nMr Zuhairi\u2019s Eighth Police Report, but these did not inject any relevance into \nthe general assertions made in the earlier statements.\n14 Associated with the issue of relevance was the reliability of Mr Zuhairi \nas a witness, in the light of his denials. At the hearing of this summons, Mr Ravi \nsuggested that it was more likely that Mr Zuhairi, who was already reluctant to \n25 Mr Suhail\u2019s 1st Affidavit at Annex D (Mr Ravi\u2019s 1st Affidavit) at para 7(e).\n26 Ms Lim\u2019s Affidavit at Exhibit LSMR-5, pp 2\u20133.\n27 Ms Lim\u2019s Affidavit at Exhibit LSMR-5, p 2.\nVersion No 1: 02 Dec 2021 (12:21 hrs)\nSyed Suhail bin Syed Zin v AG [2021] SGHC 274\n10give evidence in OS 825, became \u201cscared\u201d and attempted to protect himself by \nfiling the Eighth Police Report.28 Mr Ravi also emphasised that Mr Zuhairi had \nnot denied making the statements at [ 12(b)] and [ 12(c)] above;29 that \u201cdrug \nsuspects\u201d must logically include \u201cdrug trafficking suspects\u201d;30 and that \nMr Zuhairi\u2019s denials in the Eighth Police Report were \u201cmerely self-serving and \ncontradictory in view of what he had not denied\u201d.31 At the hearing, Mr Ravi \nseemed to envisage that he would impeach his own witness. Nevertheless, the \nissue at hand was not what Mr Zuhairi had already said \u2013 which would be \nirrelevant for the reasons explained above \u2013 but what Mr Zuhairi knew. His \nusefulness as a witness and the relevance of his evidence depended on whether \nhe had specific knowledge or evidence of arbitrariness, discrimination, bias or \nthe taking into account of irrelevant considerations by the AG or the CNB in \nrelation to the 17 plaintiffs, which were"}

{"casename":"2021_SGHC_278","fact":"'44\\u2003The background to this matter comprises six events or series of events which I will describe chronologically: (a) the formation of the 2014 DA; (b) the disputes which arose during the 2014 DA; (c) the apparent resolution of these disputes by the SCA and the concurrent formation of the 2016 DA; (d) the disputes which continued into or arose during the 2016 DA; (e) the Plaintiff\u2019s decision to terminate the 2016 DA in light of these disputes; and (f) the events after the Plaintiff\u2019s First Termination Notice.', '45\\u2003On the Defendant\u2019s account, from around September of 2006, it was the \u201csole and exclusive\u201d distributor for Haribo Group\u2019s products in South Korea. 72', 'The parties, however, did not have a formal written agreement until they entered into the 2014 DA. On Mr Hahn\u2019s account, there was never a need for the parties to have a written agreement, as their contractual relationship had been a good one even without such formalities (at least until the disputes raised at [57] below arose). 73', 'The 2014 DA therefore, according to him, was not entered to address any lack of clarity as between the parties. Rather, it was needed because of the presence of a significant number of parallel imports into South Korea, which made it necessary for the Defendant to assure its customers that it was still Haribo Group\u2019s official distributor in South Korea. 74', '46\\u2003On the Plaintiff\u2019s side, Mr Karpozov was not involved in negotiating or executing the 2014 DA. On that basis, he accepts that he is not in a position to give evidence on why the parties entered into the 2014 DA. 75', 'Nevertheless, this is not a significant gap in the narrative because the Plaintiff does not dispute that it had business dealings with the Defendant since 2006; 76', 'nor are the terms of the 2014 DA (save for the one discussed immediately below) in issue. As such, the circumstances surrounding the formation of the 2014 DA, as well as the terms of the 2014 DA need not be scrutinised extensively.', '47\\u2003The only matter which needs to be examined somewhat closely is the Defendant\u2019s assertion that it was the \u201csole and exclusive\u201d distributor for the Haribo Group\u2019s products in South Korea under the 2014 DA and before. 77', 'The Plaintiff does not accept this. Its position is there was no exclusivity under the 2014 DA, 78', 'and that the Defendant was only appointed the \u201csole and exclusive\u201d distributor for South Korea under the 2016 DA, 79', 'where such words were expressly used in cl 1.1 for the first time. 80', '48\\u2003At trial, the parties made much of this. During his cross-examination of Mr Karpuzov, counsel for defendant, Mr Vijayendran SC, took pains to suggest, by referring him to the correspondence between the parties, that exclusivity had existed since 2006 or at least under the 2014 DA. 81', 'Mr Chou, counsel for plaintiff, placing emphasis on the text of the 2014 DA \u2013 or more accurately, the absence of the words \u201csole and exclusive\u201d \u2013 did the opposite during his cross-examination of Mr Hahn. 82', '49\\u2003This dispute about the facts was not made easier to resolve by Mr Chou erroneously conceding in his lead counsel\u2019s statement that the Defendant was the exclusive distributor under the 2014 DA. 83', 'His error led to a discussion on the status of lead counsel\u2019s statements, during which Mr Chou essentially contended that parties are free to renege from concessions made, and positions taken in such statements, as they do not amount to pleadings. 84', 'Although I agree that lead counsel\u2019s statements do not supersede pleadings, I must emphasise that the role of counsel is to assist the court in arriving at a decision, not to add unnecessary layers of dispute. In fact, counsel hold a unique position. Where they state the factual positions of parties by reference to evidence admitted or to be admitted, especially those of their own client, the court generally accepts the accuracy of such statement. The court\u2019s trust in counsel, however, cannot be taken for granted. I therefore take this opportunity to remind counsel to take particular care in ensuring the accuracy of their statements. I would also add that there may well be circumstances in which a statement made in the lead counsel\u2019s statement or an opening statement may have been relied upon by the other party in such a manner that it would be unjust to permit the first party to resile from it. I hasten to add, however, that such was not the case here.', '50\\u2003In any case, despite the parties\u2019 efforts, my view is that the attention paid to the issue of exclusivity of the 2014 DA \u2013 principally, by the Defendant \u2013 was slightly misplaced. Ultimately, its exclusivity is at best, a loosely relevant fact on which nothing really turns. To appreciate why I have taken this view, we first need to understand the Defendant\u2019s purpose in contending that the 2014 DA was also an exclusive agreement.', '51\\u2003An allegation the Defendant makes in this case (cross-reference [17(a)] above and [89] below), is that a member of the Haribo Group, Haribo GmbH & Co KG (\u201cHaribo GmbH\u201d) (which deals largely with the sales and administration of the Group), had been supporting parallel imports into South Korea from as early as 2012. 85', 'Relying on certain clauses in the 2016 DA, 86', 'the Defendant claims that the Plaintiff was obliged to support its investigation into these parallel imports. However, the Plaintiff failed to do so and thus acted in breach of the 2016 DA. 87', 'It is specifically with respect to this claim, that the Defendant characterises the exclusivity of the 2014 DA as a relevant fact. 88', '52\\u2003This characterisation, however, overstates its relevance. The crux of the Defendant\u2019s allegation is that the Plaintiff failed to assist it in investigating Haribo GmbH\u2019s alleged support of parallel imports. Such assistance was only sought after the Defendant discovered that Haribo GmbH had been supporting and supplying parallel importers in August 2016, 89', 'three months after the 2016 DA had been entered into. As such, the existence and breach of such a duty should plainly be determined by reference to the 2016 DA, which the Plaintiff accepts was an exclusive agreement.', '53\\u2003From this, it is clear that, the issue of whether the parties\u2019 agreements prior to the 2016 DA were also exclusive, is not particularly salient. Even if the Defendant proves that its relationship with the Plaintiff was exclusive before the 2016 DA, to make anything of this, it will also need to show that the Plaintiff breached the relevant pre-2016 DA agreement. Even then, this would still not be directly relevant to the actual issue stated above. It would only be indirectly relevant to the extent that it informs the Plaintiff\u2019s motives behind its alleged refusal \u2013 in late 2016 \u2013 to assist the Defendant\u2019s investigation.', '54\\u2003Indeed, this is precisely how the Defendant proposes to make use of the evidence. It suggests that the Plaintiff \u201chistorically courted other distributors in South Korea\u201d, and points to a portion of Mr Karpuzov\u2019s testimony 90', 'where he stated that, because the 2014 DA was not exclusive, he had asked his colleagues to \u201cfind a way to work with\u201d other distributors. 91', 'This, Mr Karpuzov said, was a way to increase the volume of sales made by the Plaintiff and thus, its profits. Relying on this, the Defendant submits that the Plaintiff, \u201cin the pursuit of greater profits, was ready to engage with other distribution companies\u201d. 92', 'In fact, given its \u201cdemonstrable readiness to breach the exclusive distribution agreement it had with [the Defendant] and polyamorous approach towards parallel distributors, it is thoroughly unsurprising that [the Plaintiff] was in the same spirit unwilling to provide any assistance to [the Defendant]\u201d. 93', '55\\u2003I will return to the question of whether the Plaintiff wrongfully failed to support the Defendant in its investigations of Haribo GmbH\u2019s alleged conduct at [88] below. For now, I will simply observe that, ultimately, the Defendant\u2019s allegation needs to be proven by contemporaneous evidence from the time it requested the Plaintiff\u2019s assistance in its investigations. For example, Mr Hahn\u2019s evidence is that on 30 August 2016, he met with Mr Karpuzov and raised the Defendant\u2019s problems with parallel importers. 94', 'Later, in September and October 2016, he continued to correspond with the Plaintiff\u2019s representatives, to no avail. 95', 'These exchanges are most significant as they directly concern how the Plaintiff responded to the Defendant\u2019s request for assistance, and thus, whether it breached its contractual duty to cooperate.', '56\\u2003Whether the Plaintiff\u2019s response is also \u201cthoroughly unsurprising\u201d in the light of past conduct, is entirely ancillary. References to the Plaintiff\u2019s past conduct alone is not sufficient to show that it specifically refused to support the Defendant\u2019s investigations in late 2016. The evidential value of the Plaintiff\u2019s alleged past conduct is, as such, minimal. It will only be of some significance if the contemporaneous evidence is equivocal, but not so equivocal that such past conduct cannot do anything to sway the conclusion either way. For these reasons, I do not find it necessary to determine whether the 2014 DA \u2013 or the parties\u2019 unwritten contractual relationship before the 2014 DA \u2013 were exclusive agreements.', '57\\u2003I turn next to the period following the parties\u2019 execution of the 2014 DA in October 2014. For approximately six months thereafter, their relationship as supplier and distributor carried on smoothly. However, sometime in April 2015, one of two issues arose which would ultimately lead to the parties terminating the 2014 DA, executing the SCA (the \u201csettlement and contribution agreement\u201d: see [3] above), and entering into the 2016 DA.', '58\\u2003I will refer these two issues as the: (a) \u201cMisrepresentation Issue\u201d; and (b) \u201cMisdescription Issue\u201d. They relate to certain food safety concerns which arose in respect of the Haribo Group\u2019s products. Before I set them out, however, it bears noting that \u2013 though these were issues which arose whilst the 2014 DA was still in force, and before the parties executed the SCA \u2013 they nevertheless form a part of the Defendant\u2019s counterclaim based on the 2016 DA.', '59\\u2003Briefly, the Defendant\u2019s case is that these issues went unresolved even after the SCA and 2016 DA were executed; that the Plaintiff remained obliged to resolve them under the 2016 DA, notwithstanding the SCA; and thus, that the Plaintiff acted in breach of the 2016 DA. 96', 'The Plaintiff refutes these claims on two bases. First, given that they arose during the 2014 DA, they were settled by the SCA. 97', 'Second, in any event, even if such claims were not compromised by the SCA, the Plaintiff did not breach the 2016 DA. 98', 'With the relevance of these two issues broadly in mind, I now set them out.', '60\\u2003Early in April 2015, a consumer purchased the Haribo Group\u2019s products from a Costco outlet in South Korea (\u201cCostco\u201d), which was the Defendant\u2019s largest customer at the time. The consumer complained that a wood contaminant had been found in one packet of the Haribo Group\u2019s products, and threatened to file a formal complaint with the South Korean authorities. Costco informed the Defendant about the complaint, and concurrently enquired about the measures the Haribo Group\u2019s production factory had put in place to prevent such occurrences. In particular, it queried whether x-ray screenings were conducted to identify contaminants. The Defendant then conveyed this query to the Plaintiff, which in turn, extended it to the manufacturer of the Group\u2019s products, Haribo Produktions GmbH & Co KH (\u201cHaribo Produktions\u201d). 99', '61\\u2003Haribo Produktions responded to the Defendant by way of a letter dated 8 April 2015, stating that it did conduct x-ray screenings \u201cto sort out any foreign pieces\u201d (the \u201cRepresentation\u201d). 100', 'The Defendant claims that this assurance was shared with individuals in the South Korean government, businesses, as well as consumers for a period of \u201cnearly one year\u201d, before it discovered \u2013 in or around March 2016 \u2013 that the Representation was false. 101', '62\\u2003The Plaintiff accepts that the Representation was false, and that no x-ray screenings were conducted on the Group\u2019s products. Its explanation, however, is that the employee who prepared the Representation was mistaken as to the screening process, and that optical sorters were (and still are) used instead of x-ray screenings. Mr Karpuzov\u2019s evidence is that optical sorters are more effective for the purpose of detecting foreign objects in the products. 102', '63\\u2003Nevertheless, irrespective of the claimed effectiveness of optical sorters as compared with x-ray screenings, the pertinent fact is that the Representation was inaccurate. This inaccuracy forms the foundation of the Misrepresentation Issue. It is important to note, however, that the issue is not concerned with this inaccuracy per se. Rather, it relates to the Plaintiff\u2019s alleged failure to cooperate with and support the Defendant\u2019s efforts to correct the Representation. 103', '64\\u2003This brings me to the Misdescription Issue. Separately, sometime in or around February 2016, the Defendant learnt that large quantities of the Haribo Group\u2019s products had been made with a \u201cnew recipe\u201d but packaged with foils which did not accurately describe the ingredients used. More specifically, the description was provided in both Korean and German, and although the ingredients were correctly described in Korean, the German description was inaccurate. 104', 'As a consequence, these products could not be lawfully sold in South Korea. 105', '65\\u2003On the Defendant\u2019s account, when it informed the Plaintiff that its only option was to return the products, a representative for the Plaintiff asked that it falsify its declarations of the products\u2019 ingredients. 106', 'Naturally, the Defendant claims to have refused this alleged request, and instead issued a voluntary recall of the products with the South Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (\u201cMFDS\u201d). This led to the Defendant being placed under investigation by the MFDS, 107', 'the fact of which is not in dispute. 108', 'To add straws to the commercial camel\u2019s back, the Defendant claims around this time, also to have discovered the Plaintiff contacting two of its customers, in what it believed to be attempts at making direct sales. 109', '66\\u2003These issues, coupled with its later discovery of the inaccuracy of Haribo Produktion\u2019s Representation in March 2016, were what eventually led the Defendant to terminate the 2014 DA with immediate effect on 5 April 2016. 110', 'In its notice of termination, the Defendant cited the Plaintiff\u2019s: (a) instigation and perpetration of illegal food distributorship activities; (b) improper handling of food safety claims in South Korea; (c) approaching of the Defendant\u2019s customers in South Korea; and\/or (d) instigation of a breach of cl 3.7 of the 2014 DA. 111', 'For completeness, cl 3.7 of the 2014 DA simply provides that the Defendant is responsible for ensuring products do not infringe any South Korean regulations or trademarks in South Korea. 112', '67\\u2003Following the issuance of this notice of termination, the parties entered into negotiations to resolve their disputes under the 2014 DA, as well as discuss the future of their commercial relationship. 113', 'The negotiations and discussions were successful, and as stated at [3], they resulted in the SCA and the 2016 DA, both executed on 23 May 2016. 114', 'These two documents lie at the heart of the present dispute, but I will only set out their key terms from [70] below, when I describe the disputes that arose during the 2016 DA.', '68\\u2003As stated at [4] above, even after the parties entered into the fresh 2016 DA, their working relationship remained strained. I will begin by explaining how the Misdescription and Misrepresentation Issues \u2013 which led to the termination of the 2014 DA \u2013 continued to be sources of tension. Thereafter, I will describe three further issues which arose during the 2016 DA: the \u201cMFDS Inquiry Issue\u201d; the \u201cParallel Imports Issue\u201d; and the \u201cProduct Delivery Issue\u201d.', '69\\u2003From the Defendant\u2019s point of view, notwithstanding the SCA, the Misrepresentation and Misdescription Issues had not been resolved. The food safety Representation (see [61] above) had not been corrected, and the MFDS investigation resulting from the Misdescription Issue (see [65] above) had not been closed.', '70\\u2003As such, early in September 2016, the Defendant wrote to the Plaintiff, asking for a representative to attend in South Korea to assist it in addressing the MFDS\u2019s investigation into the Misdescription Issue. 115', 'These investigations, Mr Hahn admits, were \u201cnot major\u201d, and would likely result in the MFDS finding the Defendant to have inadvertently put out products which could not lawfully be sold. However, he claims that there was a small chance that the Defendant could have been found to have acted wilfully. 116', '71\\u2003The bases on which the Defendant made such request, were cll 3.7, 8.8, and 8.9 of the 2016 DA. These clauses provide:', '72\\u2003In the Plaintiff\u2019s response to the request, it cited the SCA and stated that it had no obligation to \u201ctake any further liability\u201d for issues which arose during the 2014 DA. 117', 'This led to the parties engaging in quarrels over correspondence. On 14 September 2016, the Plaintiff wrote \u2013 in a letter to the Defendant \u2013 that their contractual relationship was in such a state where they ought to \u201cseriously discuss exit scenarios and reasonable ways to unwind [their] partnership\u201d. 118', 'This in turn, caused the Defendant\u2019s Mr Hahn to respond rather angrily in an email on 15 September 2016, where he harshly criticised the conduct of the Plaintiff\u2019s representative handling this exchange. 119', '73\\u2003Ultimately, no assistance was rendered by the Plaintiff to the Defendant in resolution of this issue. The former\u2019s explanation for this is that the latter did not show any evidence that the MFDS had made further inquiries as regards the Misdescription Issue, after the execution of the SCA and 2016 DA. 120', 'Therefore, there was nothing which required its intervention or assistance, insofar as its duties under the 2016 DA were concerned. Indeed, during cross-examination, Mr Hahn accepted that the MFDS did not ask further questions relating to the Misdescription Issue after mid-April 2016. 121', 'It was an entirely unrelated matter which triggered the Defendant\u2019s request on 14 September 2016. 122', '74\\u2003On this basis, I accept the Plaintiff\u2019s account that there was \u201cno real or live issue\u201d 123', 'in respect of which it needed to support the Defendant, be it under cl 3.7, 8.8, or 8.9 of the 2016 DA. I emphasise, however, the narrowness of my finding. The parties\u2019 relationship was, at this point, quite acrimonious and I do not ascribe any blame for that state of affairs. All I find is that the Plaintiff could not have breached its duties of cooperation under cl 3.7 or 8.9 given the absence of an issue in respect of which its cooperation was needed to solve. Correlatively, I also find that there was no breach of cl 8.8. If the Misdescription Issue was not a live one at the time the Defendant made its request for assistance, the Plaintiff\u2019s failure to provide assistance surely cannot be construed as conduct that is \u201clikely to destroy or seriously damage or undermine the relationship of trust and confidence\u201d.', '75\\u2003At around the same time the parties butted heads over the Misdescription Issue, grievances regarding the Misrepresentation Issue were also being aired. The Defendant claims to have met with the Plaintiff\u2019s representatives in April 2016 (before the formation of the 2016 DA), where it requested that the Plaintiff correct the Representation in its 8 April 2015 letter (see [61] above). 124', 'No follow-up action was taken, and on 20 September 2016, the Defendant sent an email asking that the Representation be corrected. 125', 'Again, no action was taken, and the Defendant sent another request on 3 October 2016. 126', '76\\u2003The Plaintiff\u2019s inaction was a sore point for the Defendant. In an email on 3 October 2016, the latter remarked that it considered the Plaintiff\u2019s failure to reply, \u201cvery negligent and a sign of bad faith\u201d. 127', 'Ultimately, on the Defendant\u2019s case, the Plaintiff did not act on the Defendant\u2019s request until 23 January 2017, 128', 'quite sometime after it had issued its First Termination Notice on 25 October 2016.', '77\\u2003In response, similar to its position in respect of the Misdescription Issue, the Plaintiff avers that there was simply no need for it to have taken any action to correct the Representation. In support of this, it relied on two key points. First, contrary to the Defendant\u2019s claim (see [61] above), there was no evidence that it used the Plaintiff\u2019s 8 April 2015 letter to assure the MFDS, South Korean businesses, and consumers, of the safety of the Haribo Group\u2019s products. 129', 'Second, the MFDS had not requested the correction of the Representation. 130', 'Accordingly, the Misrepresentation Issue was not a live one which required the Plaintiff\u2019s intervention or assistance. 131', '78\\u2003In respect of these challenges, Mr Hahn could not state definitively during cross-examination that the Defendant had shared the Plaintiff\u2019s 8 April 2015 letter with anyone other than Costco, which made the original query giving rise to this issue (see [60] above). 132', 'Further, Mr Hahn also accepted that the MFDS had not made any request for correction. Rather, the Defendant wished for the Plaintiff to correct the Representation voluntarily. 133', 'On these bases, I accept the Plaintiff\u2019s account that the Misrepresentation Issue was not a live one in respect of which the Defendant actually required their assistance. Thus, the Plaintiff did not act in breach of cll 3.7, 8.8, and 8.9 of the 2016 DA by failing to issue a letter of correction upon request.', '79\\u2003Two further points support this finding. First, even on Prof Grigoleit\u2019s reading of cl 3.7, the Plaintiff was only obliged \u201cto cooperate in any way necessary to resolve food safety issues\u201d. 134', 'The necessary implication of this is that there must have been a food safety issue to resolve. The fact that a false statement was made to the Defendant is not, in my view, sufficient to give rise to such an issue. Based on the wording of cl 3.7, the Defendant would need to show that the misrepresentation caused it to infringe \u201cfood safety laws and regulations\u201d (see [71] above). Thereupon, the Plaintiff would be obliged to provide support to ensure compliance. Without positive proof that the Representation had been used inadvertently to mislead the public, or that the MFDS had specifically requested a correction, I cannot find that the Plaintiff\u2019s specific obligation in cl 3.7 was engaged.', '80\\u2003Second, in any event, although the Plaintiff does not contest that it only formally addressed the Defendant\u2019s request on 23 January 2017, 135', 'it did issue letters on 26 February 2016 136', 'and 15 March 2016 137', 'which correctly stated that an \u201coptical sorting machine\u201d was used, rather than \u201cx-ray screenings\u201d. These letters were issued in response to other customer complaints that foreign bodies were found in the Haribo Group\u2019s products. The Defendant does not dispute that these letters were sent, and that they constitute an \u201cupdated version\u201d of the food safety screening process. 138', 'As such, by the time the Defendant made its request for assistance on 20 September 2016 (see [75] above), it is unclear what more assistance the Defendant required in correcting the earlier 8 April 2015 letter. It could simply have utilised these newer letters.', '81\\u2003Before moving to the next section, I should also state clearly that the reasons above apply equally to cll 8.8 and 8.9 of the 2016 DA. One, as regards cl 8.8, I do not find that the Plaintiff\u2019s conduct was \u201clikely to destroy or seriously damage or undermine the [parties\u2019] relationship of trust and confidence\u201d. If the Misrepresentation Issue was not a live one as on 20 September 2016, I cannot see how the Defendant\u2019s trust and confidence in the Plaintiff to fulfil its obligations would have been damaged by its inaction. Two, cl 8.9 obliges the parties to \u201ccooperate in good faith with each other in order to fulfil their obligations under \u2026 the [2016 DA]\u201d. Clause 3.7 prescribes the more specific obligation to cooperate in good faith to ensure compliance with food safety laws and regulations. If there is no breach of cl 3.7, it follows that cl 8.9 would also not have been breached.', '82\\u2003It is clear from the foregoing that the matters which led to the termination of the 2014 DA \u2013 namely, the Misrepresentation and Misdescription Issues \u2013 were still areas of friction between the parties. However, they alone did not cause the parties\u2019 eventual falling out. This brings me to the three new issues which only arose during the course of the 2016 DA: the \u201cMFDS Inquiry Issue\u201d; the \u201cParallel Imports Issue\u201d; and the \u201cProduct Delivery Issues\u201d.', '83\\u2003In sum, as regards the MFDS Inquiry Issue, the Defendant\u2019s case is that early in October 2016, it learnt that the MFDS was investigating a complaint made by a South Korean customer earlier in August 2016. The complaint was that a metallic dental filling had been found in a packet of the Haribo Group\u2019s product. 139', 'The MFDS was, accordingly, requesting an official explanation as to the screening process Haribo Produktions uses to identify foreign contaminants. On this basis, the Defendant wrote to the Plaintiff on 4 October 2016, seeking its assistance in responding to the MFDS. 140', 'Although this bears resemblance to the Misrepresentation Issue earlier described, it is distinct both in its basal facts as well as the Defendant\u2019s precise complaint.', '84\\u2003As regards the Misrepresentation Issue, the Defendant\u2019s averment is that the Plaintiff failed, persistently, to cure the Representation (see [75] above). On the MFDS Inquiry Issue, the Defendant\u2019s case is that the Plaintiff did not assist it in responding to the MFDS\u2019s inquiry, but rather took over the management of the inquiry, and cut it out of the loop. 141', 'This, the Defendant claims, was contrary to the terms of the 2016 DA \u2013 which provided that it was the Defendant\u2019s role to communicate with the South Korean authorities 142', '\u2013 and also indicative of bad faith. The Defendant avers 143', 'that it is indicative of bad faith because it was one of a number of steps the Plaintiff took to cut it off from its functions as a distributor, in preparation for its unlawful termination of the 2016 DA. Another step arises from the Product Delivery Issues (from [93] below).', '85\\u2003The Plaintiff\u2019s response is fourfold. First, that it attempted to cooperate with the Defendant to address the MFDS Inquiry, but that the Defendant did not provide the information needed for such cooperation. 144', 'Second, that it had sent a statement to the Defendant to address the MFDS\u2019 inquiry, but this statement was rejected. 145', 'Third, given the Defendant\u2019s response, the Plaintiff was justified in communicating with the MFDS directly. 146', 'Lastly, that the Plaintiff had kept the Defendant apprised of its communications with the MFDS. 147', '86\\u2003Having considered their respective cases, I find that the Plaintiff did not \u2013 through its conduct in respect of the MFDS Inquiry Issue \u2013 breach cl 3.7, 8.8, or 8.9 of the 2016 DA. My decision is based broadly on the Plaintiff\u2019s first three responses.', '(a)\\u2003First, the parties exchanged emails between 4 and 12 October 2016, and these exchanges show that the Plaintiff asked persistently about the product which formed the subject of the inquiry, ie, the name of the product as well as its batch number. 148', 'This, to me, is indicative that the Plaintiff was attempting to cooperate.', '(b)\\u2003Second, on 5 October 2016, the Defendant provided the Plaintiff with the relevant contact point in the MFDS. 149', 'Although the Plaintiff could have, at this point, cut off the Defendant from the inquiry, it did not. On 7 October 2016, it sent the Defendant a response to the complaint. 150', 'In fact, after the Defendant expressed concerns about the phrasing of the response, 151', 'the Plaintiff followed-up with another response on 11 October2016. 152', 'This suggests to me that the Plaintiff was not trying to \u201cusurp\u201d 153', 'the Defendant\u2019s role. To the contrary, it seemed to be cooperating with the Defendant\u2019s request.', '(c)\\u2003Third, it was only on 23 January 2017 that the Plaintiff directly communicated with the MFDS to address its inquiry. 154', 'By this point, the Plaintiff had already issued its First Termination Notice, and seeing as how the MFDS\u2019s Inquiry had still not been resolved, it was not in my view, unreasonable for the Plaintiff to take it upon itself to issue a letter to correct any misconceptions about the process its factories use to detect foreign substances. While the Defendant was the appointed distributor for the Haribo Group\u2019s products in South Korea, the reputation of the Haribo brand was, ultimately, the Plaintiff\u2019s to protect. Further, though cl 3.7 provides that it is the Defendant\u2019s responsibility to ensure compliance with food safety requirements, it does not positively exclude the Plaintiff from taking steps in that direction. In fact, the clause obliges the Defendant to \u201cconsult the [Plaintiff] prior to any correspondence with authorities, and any public statements or communication to the press\u201d (see [71] above). This statement, in my view, makes it difficult to construe the imposition of responsibility on the Defendant, as excluding the Plaintiff\u2019s involvement.', '87\\u2003Before turning to the Parallel Imports Issue, however, I will explain why I do not accept the Plaintiff\u2019s last response. The document on which it relies in support of its claim that it kept the Defendant apprised of communications with the MFDS merely states that it would keep the Defendant informed. 155', 'It does not actually show that it kept the Defendant so informed.', '88\\u2003In relation to the Parallel Imports issue, the Defendant\u2019s case as stated at [45] above, is that it was the sole and exclusive distributor for the Haribo Group\u2019s products in South Korea since 2006. As an exclusive distributor, it was naturally concerned about parallel, unauthorised imports of the Haribo Group\u2019s products into South Korea since such imports would affect its business operations. As such, the Defendant regards the Plaintiff\u2019s conduct in relation to the Parallel Imports Issue, as a significant breach. 156', '89\\u2003Sometime in August 2016, the Defendant claims to have discovered that Haribo GmbH (cross-reference [51] above) had been positively supporting and supplying parallel importers from as early as 2012. 157', 'It must be emphasised that the allegation is not that the Plaintiff was itself providing such support, but rather its associate in the Haribo Group.', '90\\u2003In light of this discovery, the Defendant sent an email to the Plaintiff on 20 September 2016, highlighting that such an issue existed. 158', 'Thereafter, on 3 October 2016, the Defendant asked that the Plaintiff investigate the parallel imports apparently supported by Haribo GmbH. 159', 'No investigation was ultimately ever conducted into this matter. On the Defendant\u2019s case, this was because of the Plaintiff\u2019s lack of willingness, predicated on bad faith. 160', 'On the Plaintiff\u2019s case, there was simply no evidence that Haribo GmbH had been supporting parallel imports into South Korea, and there was thus no basis for an investigation to be commenced. 161', '91\\u2003Having considered the evidence, I accept the Plaintiff\u2019s account for two reasons. One, the Defendant\u2019s request for assistance was premised on its rather bare claim that Haribo GmbH had been supporting parallel importers. It is unclear how it made this discovery, whether there was supporting evidence, or whether its source was even reliable. Accordingly, I agree that more was required to engage the Plaintiff\u2019s duty of cooperation. The existence of a duty of cooperation (here, under cll 8.8 and 8.9, but not cl 3.7 as that pertains only to food safety) cannot mean that the obligor must cooperate with all requests, whether grounded or not.', '92\\u2003Two, as mentioned at [54] above, the Defendant avers that the Plaintiff \u201chistorically \u2026 actively courted other distributors in [South] Korea\u201d. 162', 'Even if this were true, it is not alone sufficient to prove that the Plaintiff refused to abide by its duty of cooperation for ulterior motives, in breach of contract. I have explained this at [55] and [56] above. For these reasons, I find that there is no evidence that the Plaintiff breached its duty of cooperation under the 2016 DA in respect of the Parallel Imports Issue.', '93\\u2003I turn finally, to the Product Delivery Issue. As stated at [17(b)] above, the Defendant\u2019s case is that, in response to its requests for assistance for the above-discussed issues, the Plaintiff deliberately halted product deliveries and cancelled production of goods it had ordered. In particular, the Defendant avers that its orders for the months of June to December 2016 (the \u201cOrders\u201d) went entirely unfulfilled, or, if they were partially fulfilled, that they were delayed (the \u201cUndelivered Portions\u201d). 163', 'On the Defendant\u2019s case, the orders were each supposed to be delivered from October 2016 to April 2017. 164', 'Before going further, however, I highlight for clarity that the Order for June \u2013 despite being described as such \u2013 was placed on 14 July 2016 with the Defendant\u2019s Order for July. 165', '94\\u2003These failures to deliver or delays in deliveries, the Defendant claims, were breaches of cl 9.3 of the 2016 DA, and therefore, that it is entitled to damages for the profits it lost from being unable to fully fulfil its customer\u2019s orders by reason of its shortage of inventory. Clause 9.3 provides:', '95\\u2003The Defendant\u2019s allegation raises a whole host of alternative claims and defences. They can, fortunately, be grouped around two simpler, overarching issues. First, whether the Plaintiff was obliged, in the first place, to deliver the Orders. Second, if it was obliged to deliver, whether it has any alternative basis for its failure to do so.', '96\\u2003In respect of the first issue, the Plaintiff chiefly relies 166', 'on the procedure by which the Defendant is supposed to place orders for products. The minutiae of the ordering process are not salient. That which is crucial, is the application or non-application of appendix 2, condition 2 of the 2016 DA:', '97\\u2003Relying on this condition, the Plaintiff avers that it had not given any written confirmation, and therefore, it was not obliged to deliver the Orders. The Defendant has two responses. First, that condition 2 is invalid as a matter of German law; and second, that in any event, the orders had been confirmed in writing by the Plaintiff.', '98\\u2003Having considered the matter, I find that condition 2 is not invalid under German law, and consequently that written confirmation is required. However, the evidence, in my view, shows that the Plaintiff had confirmed the Orders. I will address each finding in turn.', '99\\u2003The Defendant relies on two provisions of the BGB to make its case that condition 2 was invalid, sections 308 and 307(1). 167', 'They provide:', '100\\u2003In respect of section 308, Profs Lehmann 168', 'and Grigoleit 169', 'agree that its application does not directly extend to transactions between businesses (\u201cB2B\u201d transactions). The Defendant\u2019s argument can therefore be rejected on this basis alone. Indeed, Prof Grigoleit does not even suggest that it should apply, rather, his view is that a violation of this provision indicates that the term in question unreasonably disadvantages the other party, contrary to section 307(1). 170', '101\\u2003This brings me then to section 307(1). The Defendant\u2019s argument is that condition 2 fails the requirements of clarity and comprehensibility. Specifically, such failure stems from fact that the condition empowers the Plaintiff to: (a) take an indefinite period of time to issue a written confirmation; and (b) vary descriptions and images of products, even after written confirmation has been issued. This, the Defendant says, is not tolerable because it is left \u201changing on potentially indefinitely\u201d. 171', '102\\u2003While I can appreciate the Defendant\u2019s position, I do not agree that the effect of the condition is quite as dramatic as it suggests. In this regard, I accept Prof Lehmann\u2019s view that condition 2 should be read with cl 9.3 of the 2016 DA (text at [94] above). The latter obliges the Plaintiff to use reasonable best endeavours to deliver goods in a timely manner in accordance with the sales reports produced by the Defendant. The result of this, Prof Lehmann states, is that the Plaintiff \u201cdoes not reserve to itself the right to unreasonably long or insufficiently specific periods of time for acceptance or rejection of an offer or for rending performance\u201d. 172', 'Viewed in this light, it does not appear to me that condition 2 unreasonably disadvantages the Defendant.', '103\\u2003As regards the Plaintiff\u2019s right under condition 2 to vary the description or image of products in a confirmed order, I find this right to be rather limited. Professor Lehmann suggests that this right is necessary for the Plaintiff to update and modernise its packaging. 173', 'This, in my view, is not a sufficiently wide power to unreasonably disadvantage the Defendant. As such, for these reasons, I find that condition 2 is not invalidated by sections 308 or 307(1) of the BGB.', '104\\u2003I turn then to whether the Orders were confirmed. The Orders can be sub-grouped into those placed in July to October 2016, and those placed in November and December 2016. In respect of the orders from July to October 2016, the Plaintiff accepts that when the Defendant placed its orders, pro forma invoices were issued. 174', 'Its position, however, is that such invoices do not amount to written confirmation of the Defendant\u2019s orders. Rather, they merely acknowledge receipt of the order, prior to the Plaintiff\u2019s internal checks as to what can be produced and delivered. 175', '105\\u2003I do not accept this. Condition 2 states that \u201cwritten confirmation\u201d is required, but does not specify a particular form such confirmation must take. It is perfectly possible for written confirmation to take the form of the pro forma invoice. If the Plaintiff merely wanted to acknowledge but not confirm the Defendant\u2019s order, it could have done so by saying as much. There was no need to issue an invoice in the manner it did. As an aside, I note that the literal meaning of \u201cpro forma\u201d \u2013 \u201cfor the sake of form\u201d \u2013 may appear to support the Plaintiff\u2019s position. However, I do not think much of this label. The parties were free to title their documents with anything they wished. Their chosen title will not change the underlying inquiry, which is whether the written confirmation was given. In fact, contrary to its label, Mr Karpuzov\u2019s own evidence suggests that pro forma invoices effected confirmation: 176', '106\\u2003This appears quite patently to be a concession that the Orders from July to October 2016 were confirmed in writing, by way of the pro forma invoices. This is further supported by two contemporaneous pieces of evidence.', '(a)\\u2003One, the pro forma invoices themselves state at the bottom that the Defendant is to pay for the products ordered by the \u201c3rd working day of [the] next month\u201d. 177', 'If the invoice is not a confirmation of the order, it is odd that it sets out instructions to pay. On the Plaintiff\u2019s case, this line would not only be meaningless, but it might also lead the Defendant to pay when it is not obliged to. Suppose the Plaintiff is correct, and that the Defendant places an order on 14 July 2016. It receives a pro forma invoice and on 3 August, it proceeds to make payment. At this point, the Plaintiff has not given what it considers \u201cwritten confirmation\u201d, and it ultimately decides not to give such confirmation. If so, it then needs to return the sum paid. This begs the question, why ask the Defendant to make such payment in the first place? This is commercially illogical, and it supports the conclusion that a pro forma invoice must have been the Plaintiff\u2019s written confirmation of an order.', '(b)\\u2003Two, in an email from Mr Karpuzov on 23 January 2017, he states, \u201cPlease note that we have issued [pro forma invoices] for all the orders until order 2016-TEN#4 and we will deliver all the ordered quantities\u201d. 178', 'This, in my view, speaks for itself.', '107\\u2003Accordingly, for the above reasons, I find that the parties entered into binding contracts within the framework of the 2016 DA, 179', 'and that the Plaintiff was obliged to make delivery on the Orders placed in July to October 2016.', '108\\u2003In respect of the Orders for November and December 2016, no pro forma invoices were issued. However, the evidence suggests that the Plaintiff did not issue such invoices because the parties\u2019 payment terms had changed. On 14 December 2016, the Defendant wrote to Mr Karpuzov, highlighting that it had not received a pro forma invoice for its November 2016 order. Mr Karpuzov responded on 19 December 2016, querying, \u201cSince the payment terms have been changed from advance payment can you please elaborate why do you need pro forma invoices?\u201d On 20 December, the Defendant replied, stating that \u2013 on that basis \u2013 it would simply take it that the Plaintiff has acknowledged its orders for November and December 2016. Mr Karpuzov did not respond. 180', '109\\u2003The Plaintiff submits that Mr Karpuzov\u2019s response shows that he merely acknowledged the orders placed. He did not confirm them. 181', 'It further relies on an email from the Defendant which stated, \u201cWe want [pro forma invoices] as a sort of acknowledgment\u201d. 182', 'I do not accept this characterisation in light of Mr Karpuzov\u2019s 23 January 2017 email (see [106] above). There, Mr Karpuzov draws a connection between the issuance of pro forma invoices and the delivery of ordered quantities. This suggests that the Plaintiff viewed such invoices as the \u201cwritten confirmation\u201d required for the purposes of condition 2. Thus, when he asked in December 2016 why the Defendant wanted pro forma invoices when they were no longer needed, there seems only to be two possible ways to interpret his statement. One, that pro forma invoices were no longer needed and, in any case, that the Defendant\u2019s orders were not confirmed. Or two, that the pro forma invoices were no longer needed, and the Defendant need not ask for them because their orders had, in any case, been confirmed.', '110\\u2003In my view, the second interpretation of Mr Karpuzov\u2019s email is more natural. If he wished specifically to state that the Defendant\u2019s orders had not been confirmed, one would expect him to have stated so. By merely asking why the Defendant needed pro forma invoices, it seems implied that the orders had been confirmed save without said invoices. The fine distinction which the Plaintiff draws between an \u201cacknowledged\u201d order and a \u201cconfirmed\u201d order, in my view, does not hold in this context. On this basis, I find that the Orders for November and December 2016 had also been confirmed, that a binding contract had arisen, and that the Plaintiff was obliged to deliver.', '111\\u2003Having found that the Plaintiff was obliged to deliver the Orders, I need then to consider the Plaintiff\u2019s defences to its late and non-deliveries. Before I do so, however, I note as an aside, that the Defendant sought to rely on a doctrine in German law called \u201celoquent silence\u201d in respect of Mr Karpuzov\u2019s lack of a reply to the Defendant\u2019s 20 December 2016 email (see [108] above). 183', 'This is an exception to the general rule that silence cannot be interpreted as acceptance, and the Defendant raised it to make the argument that his lack of response constituted confirmation. However, given my analysis in the paragraphs above, reliance on this doctrine is unnecessary.', '112\\u2003From the foregoing analysis, the Plaintiff had confirmed the Orders and was therefore obliged to deliver the Undelivered Portions to the Defendant. The question following this is whether it had been absolved from these delivery obligations by any defences. Four were raised by the Plaintiff.', '(a)\\u2003First, that the Defendant had sufficient stock to cover its usual orders until 30 April 2017, ie, the date on which the 2016 DA would have ended if the Plaintiff\u2019s First Termination Notice was valid (the \u201cSufficient Stock Defence\u201d). 184', '(b)\\u2003Second, that the Orders for October, November, and December 2016 far exceeded usual sales volumes, and as such, the Plaintiff was not obliged to fulfil them as the Defendant would only have been able to complete sales of the goods after 30 April 2017 (the \u201cUnusual Volumes Defence\u201d). 185', '(c)\\u2003Third, that the Plaintiff was not obliged to fulfil the Orders for October, November, and December 2016 on the basis that they were not in accordance with the sales report provided by the Defendant pursuant to cl 9.3 of the 2016 DA (the \u201cSales Reports Defence\u201d). 186', '(d)\\u2003Fourth, that the Plaintiff had a right of retention which arose as a result of the Defendant\u2019s default in payments, and its failure to return the products recalled in connection with the Misdescription Issue (cross-reference [65] above) (the \u201cRight of Retention Defence\u201d). 187', '113\\u2003For the following reasons, I find that none of these defences apply. As a preliminary point, it should be noted that the burden of proof to establish these defences lies on the Plaintiff. It is not for the Defendant to disprove them. Even though the parties\u2019 agreement is governed by German law, it is trite that matters of procedure are governed by the lex fori (see, eg, Star City Pty Ltd (fka Sydney Harbour Casino Pty Ltd) v Tan Hong Woon [2002] 1 SLR(R) 306 at [8] to [14]). It is plain that rules of evidence are matters of procedure, as such, given that the Plaintiff asserts the facts underlying its defences, it bears the burden of proving those facts (s 105 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed); Cooperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank BA (trading as Rabobank International), Singapore Branch v Motorola Electronics Pte Ltd (\u201cCooperatieve Centrale\u201d) [2011] 2 SLR 63 at [31]).', '114\\u2003The essence of the Sufficient Stock Defence is that the Defendant had enough inventory to last it until 30 April 2017, and it had no justification for placing more orders which it would not have been able to sell before the end of the 2016 DA. On this basis, the Plaintiff claims it was under no obligation to fulfil the Orders. To make out this defence, the Plaintiff needs to show that the Defendant in fact had sufficient stock, and that, under German law, it had the legal right to withhold deliveries on this basis.', '115\\u2003The Plaintiff\u2019s submissions were focused on the latter. 188', 'In this regard, it made two key points. One, that the extent of its obligation under cl 9.3 of the 2016 DA was only to ensure that deliveries were made in accordance with the timelines set out in the Defendant\u2019s sales report, or as the parties mutually agreed. It was not to make any and all deliveries at a time requested by the Defendant.', '116\\u2003Two, that in determining the scope of the Plaintiff\u2019s obligation under cl 9.3, the court ought to take into account: (a) the fact that the 2016 DA was coming to an end; and (b) that it is not commercially sensible to allow the Defendant to stock up on products towards the end of the 2016 DA at the expense of the Plaintiff\u2019s interests. As regards (a), the Plaintiff suggested, more specifically, that the impending termination of the 2016 DA meant that it was only obliged to deliver products that the Defendant would have been able to sell by the date on which the contract was going to end.', '117\\u2003In my view, the second point is flawed. Commercially, principals and distributors are in business for themselves. The former earns from sales to the latter, and the latter earns from sales to wholesalers and retailers. It is therefore strange for the Plaintiff to argue that it was not commercially sensible for it to sell to the Defendant, the stock it wished to purchase, because the 2016 DA was coming to an end. Whether the Defendant would have been able complete its sales is its own concern. So long as the Plaintiff fulfils its end of the transaction, it is entitled to payment on the goods delivered. If the Defendant is unable thereafter to complete sales before the end of the 2016 DA, it would no longer be entitled to sell the goods pursuant to cl 7.7, and the Plaintiff would not even be obliged to repurchase the balance goods as cl 5.2 provides. Further, if the Defendant attempted to sell its products after the 2016 DA had ended, injunctive relief could be sought.', '118\\u2003For context, cll 5.2 and 7.7 provide:', '119\\u2003I am bolstered in my view by Mr Karpuzov\u2019s own evidence that, after the 2016 DA actually ended, it had \u201c1.2 million products for [the Defendant]\u201d 189', 'which it ended up having to sell at a bulk discount because it faced difficulty in finding a buyer for such large quantities. 190', 'As I mentioned at [37] above, in December 2016 and January 2017, the Defendant issued notices under cl 7.5 of the 2016 DA, demanding that the Plaintiff make deliveries on some of the Orders. It was only after the Plaintiff failed to do so that the Defendant issued its own Termination Notice on 3 February 2017. Accordingly, if the Plaintiff had simply acted on the demands for delivery, it would not have needed to sit on goods tailor-made for the South Korean market which had not been spoken for. It could have passed on the burden of finding customers to the Defendant. It was by their failure to deliver, that they took on that onus.', '120\\u2003I therefore do not think these points support the Plaintiff\u2019s position that cl 9.3 of the 2016 DA should be construed as conferring on it the right to withhold delivery from the Defendant. Such an interpretation is neither commercially sensible for the Plaintiff, nor the Defendant.', '121\\u2003In support of the Plaintiff\u2019s position, Prof Lehmann cites a case heard by the Oberlandesgericht Frankfurt am Main (the Court of Appeal of Frankfurt) which he says decided that \u201cwhere a distribution contract is coming to an end, the principal is \u2018at the most\u2019 obliged to deliver products that can be sold until this moment\u201d. 191', 'This may well have been the court\u2019s view. However, German cases do not create binding precedent, and without an accompanying provision of the BGB which suggests this rule, or at least a closer analysis of the court\u2019s reasons for its conclusion \u2013 which Prof Lehmann does not provide \u2013 I do not accept this as being an appropriate way to construe cl 9.3. Indeed, there is nothing about the text of cl 9.3 which suggests that the Plaintiff\u2019s obligation should be relieved in this manner. The ordinary principles of interpretation in German law can simply be applied, and I will turn to them momentarily, after I address a point of expert evidence raised by the Plaintiff.', '122\\u2003In its written reply submissions, the Plaintiff argues that, since Prof Grigoleit has not contested the above-mentioned Frankfurt Court of Appeal case, this point of undisputed German law \u201cmust be accepted by this Court\u201d. 192', 'I reject this submission. First, Mr Chou did not question Prof Grigoleit on this case. 193', 'Second, it is well-established that the court does not blindly accept an expert\u2019s evidence simply because it is not contradicted (see Saeng-Un Udom v PP [2001] 2 SLR(R) 1 at [26] and [27]; Sakthivel Punithavathi v PP [2007] 2 SLR(R) 983 at [76]; and Poh Soon Kiat v Desert Palace Inc (trading as Caesars Palace) [2010] 1 SLR 1129 at [22] and [23]). Although the court ought not to substitute its own view for that of an uncontradicted expert, it is entitled to scrutinise the premises adopted by and analytical reasoning of the expert. Here, Prof Lehmann\u2019s view that the Plaintiff was, \u201cat the most\u201d, obliged to deliver goods which the Defendant would have been able to sell by the end of the 2016 DA, stands on rather shaky ground.', '123\\u2003His report does not set out the reasoning of the Frankfurt Court of Appeal; whether it stated its decision to be a general rule thereafter applicable to all distribution contracts; the specific words of the principal\u2019s delivery obligations in that case, or even what the facts of that case were. Though Prof Lehmann refers to the German courts\u2019 decisions as \u201ccase law\u201d, 194', 'Prof Grigoleit\u2019s evidence is that judicial decisions \u201care not qualified as elements of the law\u201d. 195', 'I therefore cannot simply accept that the Frankfurt Court of Appeal\u2019s decision has the legal effect Prof Lehmann suggests. Thus, without more details about the case, it seems that the only suitable course is to interpret cl 9.3 of the 2016 DA using the principles the experts have set out.', '124\\u2003Before I leave the issue of foreign law, I make one final observation. Although the Plaintiff may not appreciate the significance of its submission that the court must accept the uncontradicted evidence of a foreign law expert, it is one which goes to the very heart of how one sees the court\u2019s role vis-\u00e0-vis such an expert. To explain this, I can do no better than quote Evans LJ in MCC Proceeds Inc v Bishopsgate Investment Trust plc [1999] CLC 417 at [13] (followed by the Court of Appeal in Pacific Recreation Pte Ltd v S Y Technology Inc [2008] 2 SLR(R) 391, though this passage was not referenced there):', '125\\u2003The notion that the Frankfurt Court of Appeal may have relieved principals of their contractual obligations to deliver when their distributorship agreements with their distributors are approaching an end, is not a concept beyond the grasp of this court. I can fully appreciate how this would operate. What I require from Prof Lehmann, is not his bare assertion of such a rule, but rather his proof that the court did in fact lay down such a rule. Such proof could have come in the form of an explanation as to the basis on which such rule overrides the express obligations in the parties\u2019 contract, the rationale for the rule (especially in light of my observations at [117] above), and so on. Without this, I cannot accept that such rule applies contrary to the plain words of cl 9.3.', '126\\u2003Having addressed the Plaintiff\u2019s argument on proof of foreign law, I now return to cl 9.3, the full text of which is set out at [94] above. Saliently, it provides that the Plaintiff \u201cshall ensure timely delivery of the Products \u2026 in accordance with the timelines as stated in the ongoing and updated Sales Reports \u2026 or as mutually agreed upon in writing\u201d. The latter half of this sentence can be ignored; it is not either parties\u2019 case that they had agreed to any specific delivery dates in writing. We are only concerned with the statement in the first half of the clause.', '127\\u2003From the evidence, despite cl 9.3, it does not seem that the expected delivery dates were ever stated expressly in the sales reports. Those tendered to the court only contained difficult-to-decipher sales volumes and percentages. 196', 'In cross-examination, Mr Karpuzov similarly testified that delivery timelines had never been strictly agreed upon or set out. However, he accepted that it was \u201ca rule of thumb\u201d for the Defendant to submit its purchase orders four months in advance of the expected delivery. Although he suggests that this timeframe was not strict, it was \u201cmore or less\u201d followed. Further, he also accepted that the Defendant \u201cmore or less\u201d placed orders in accordance with quantities forecasted in its sales reports. 197', 'The question which arises from this, is whether the parties\u2019 practice affects how cl 9.3 should be read.', '128\\u2003Professor Lehmann explains that the \u201cmost important rules of interpretation for private contracts are laid down in [sections] 133 and 157 [of the] BGB. German courts must interpret the parties\u2019 declarations in light of their intent. \u2018Declarations\u2019 are, in particular, offer and acceptance, which together amount to a contract. According to [section] 157 [of the] BGB, contracts must be interpreted in line with the requirements of good faith and any custom existing between the parties\u201d [emphasis added]. 198', 'This, in my view, squarely addresses how cl 9.3 should be interpreted.', '129\\u2003The Defendant did not, over the course of their agreement, seem to have expressly set out the expected date of delivery in its sales reports. However, they did eventually come to an understanding that orders would be placed \u201cmore or less\u201d four months in advance. Mr Karpuzov\u2019s evidence shows that the Plaintiff also regarded this as customary. Accordingly, I find that cl 9.3 obliged the Plaintiff to deliver the Defendant\u2019s confirmed orders within approximately four months from the date of the order. It was therefore obliged to deliver the Orders \u2013 which were placed from July to December 2016 \u2013 from October 2016 to April 2017 respectively.', '130\\u2003This obligation is a strict one \u2013 as contractual obligations are \u2013 and the Plaintiff must make timely deliveries (as prescribed by cl 9.3), bearing in mind the four-month custom. A failure to do so, subject to the Plaintiff\u2019s other defences considered below, amounts to a breach of contract. However, an issue which arises \u2013 given the slight ambiguity in the word \u201ctimely\u201d, coupled with the fact that the four-month timeline is described as applying \u201cmore or less\u201d of the time \u2013 is how far off from four months would be considered \u201cuntimely\u201d.', '131\\u2003In my view, a period of four months to the end of the month is reasonable. That is, if the Defendant placed its order sometime in August 2016, the Plaintiff would have had to make delivery by 31 December 2016. This is consistent with the custom of the parties. All seven Orders were placed around the middle of the month, with the Defendant requesting that most deliveries be made four months later, but without any particular date. For example, the Order for August 2016 was placed on the 18th that month, and the request was for it to be delivered by \u201cDecember 2016\u201d. 199', '132\\u2003In sum, for the reasons above, I find that the Sufficient Stocks Defence fails, and the Plaintiff was obliged under cl 9.3 of the 2016 DA to deliver within a period of four months to the end of the month from the date on which the Order was placed. On the evidence, that means:', '(a)\\u2003The Orders for June and July 2016, both placed on 14 July 2016, were to be delivered by 30 November 2016;', '(b)\\u2003The Order for August 2016, placed on 18 August 2016, was to be delivered by 31 December 2016;', '(c)\\u2003The Order for September 2016, placed on 13 September 2016, was to be delivered by 31 January 2017;', '(d)\\u2003The Order for October 2016, placed on 14 October 2016, was to be delivered by 28 February 2017;', '(e)\\u2003The Order for November 2016, placed on 18 November 2016, was to be delivered by 31 March 2017; and', '(f)\\u2003The Order for December 2016, placed on 19 December 2016, was to be delivered on 30 April 2017.', '133\\u2003On this last delivery, I note that 30 April 2017 is the same day on which the 2016 DA would have ended if the Plaintiff\u2019s First Termination Notice was valid. However, as I have stated at [121] above, there is nothing about cl 9.3 which suggests that the Plaintiff\u2019s obligation to deliver should be limited by the 2016 DA coming to an end. If the Defendant was willing to place and pay for an order it may not have been able to sell, and for which the Plaintiff was under no obligation to buy back, it was free to take that risk. However, liability and quantum are distinct issues. The Plaintiff could have breached its obligation to deliver by 30 April 2017 (subject to my consideration of the other defences below), but that does not necessarily mean the Defendant should be entitled to any damages if it cannot show that it would have been able to profit from this final order within the day. I will return to this at [200] below.', '134\\u2003Before I turn to the next defence, I make a further observation about the Plaintiff\u2019s case. Even if I had preferred their interpretation of cl 9.3, I was not satisfied that the Defendant in fact had sufficient stock. Two points in particular suggest this. One, the Plaintiff relies on its own stock calculations of the Defendant\u2019s stock levels in March 2017. 200', 'However, it is not clear how these calculations were derived, and whether they are accurate. Mr Karpuzov testifies that the numbers were taken from the Defendant\u2019s sales reports, 201', 'but he does not explain how they correspond to the underlying sales reports. 202', 'I am therefore hesitant to accept that the quantities accurately reflect the Defendant\u2019s actual stock levels.', '135\\u2003Two, even if these alleged stock levels are accepted as true and accurate, they only explain the Plaintiff\u2019s failure to deliver, at the earliest, from January 2017. The Plaintiff did not put forth evidence of the Defendant\u2019s stock levels from October 2016. To the contrary, the Defendant points to contemporaneous evidence showing that they had, in November 2016, brought to the Plaintiff\u2019s attention that they were short on stock. 203', '136\\u2003The Unusual Volumes Defence \u2013 which only relates to the Orders for October, November and December 2016 204', '\u2013 is quite closely connected to the Sufficient Stock Defence. Under this defence, the Plaintiff claims that the Defendant\u2019s orders for these months increased by anywhere between 38% and 19900%. Relying on the prima facie force of these percentage increases, the Plaintiff suggests that it is \u201cundeniable\u201d that the Defendant\u2019s orders for these three months was \u201cunusually high\u201d. 205', '137\\u2003On this basis, the Plaintiff claims not to be obliged to make deliveries because the delivered stock \u201ccould only be sold off after the end of the 2016 DA\u201d. 206', 'Apart from the Frankfurt Court of Appeal case discussed at [121] above, the Plaintiff also specifically relies on Prof Grigoleit\u2019s \u201cconcession\u201d that, if an order is \u201c100 times as much\u201d as can be expected from previous dealings, then it is \u201cprobably a fair reason\u201d for the Plaintiff to reject an order. 207', '138\\u2003I have already analysed the Frankfurt Court of Appeal\u2019s decision above. I do not accept that it creates a rule which allows a principal to refuse to fulfil orders for this reason. In this regard, I do not think Prof Grigoleit\u2019s \u201cconcession\u201d meaningfully assists the Plaintiff. If the principal had not wished to accept such an order, it was free to do so upon the distributor\u2019s offer to purchase being made. However, once it is accepted \u2013 and I have found that the Plaintiff did accept the Orders in this case (see [104] to [110] above) \u2013 the parties ought to be bound by their contractual obligations. The Plaintiff has not pointed to any clear rule or principle in German law which suggests otherwise.', '139\\u2003Apart from the legal difficulty, which is enough to dispose of the matter, the Plaintiff\u2019s case also lacks the necessary factual grounding. Similar to the issue I discussed at [134] in respect of the Sufficient Stock Defence, the Plaintiff does not prove how its calculations of the \u201cunusually high\u201d volumes were derived. These values are stated to be based on its \u201cown internal calculation[s]\u201d with no reference to primary documents. 208', 'Their failure to prove the increase, in fact, is rather curious. The Defendant\u2019s monthly sales reports were marked and admitted, 209', 'yet, it was not explained how these spreadsheets were to be read, whether the Plaintiff\u2019s calculations relied on them, and if so, how. I therefore cannot see how its suggestion that the Defendant ordered usually high volumes, is \u201cundeniable\u201d. Given that the burden lies on the Plaintiff to establish its defence, I do not accept its assertion as to the percentage increases in the Defendant\u2019s Orders.', '140\\u2003Connectedly, the Plaintiff also attacks the Defendant\u2019s explanation as to why there was an alleged increase in the volume of its orders. 210', 'Namely, that the Defendant was anticipating growth as a result of new marketing strategies; 211', 'that increases in the size of orders were meant to accommodate Valentine\u2019s and White Day; 212', 'and that the Defendant had outstanding, unfulfilled orders which it could complete \u2013 these stemming from the shortage of goods the Defendant faced when it had to issue a voluntary product recall (see [65] above). 213', 'These attacks may well be valid, but I need not consider them because it is not even clear to me, in the first place, the exact extent of the increase in the volume of the Defendant\u2019s orders (if any). That needs to be established before I can meaningfully consider whether the Defendant\u2019s explanations should or should not be accepted.', '141\\u2003By its Sales Report Defence, the Plaintiff claims to have no obligation to fulfil the Orders for October, November, and December 2016, to the extent they were not in accordance with the sales reports provided by the Defendant. The basis of this claim is cl 9.3. 214', 'I cannot accept this. As set out at [94], the reference to \u201csales reports\u201d in the clause plainly relates to \u201ctimelines\u201d, not quantities. There is no basis to read in a right to refuse to make full delivery for confirmed orders (as I have found on the facts), when appendix 2, condition 2 of the 2016 DA expressly states that offers are \u201csubject to change until the time that [they are] confirmed\u201d [emphasis added]. Such a reading would create an odd inconsistency within the 2016 DA.', '142\\u2003Lastly, I turn to the Right of Retention Defence. For this, the Plaintiff relies on two provisions: appendix 2, condition 11 of the 2016 DA; and section 273(1) of the BGB. These provide:', '143\\u2003I begin with condition 11. Preliminarily, the Defendant objects to its consideration on the basis that it was not pleaded, 215', 'and that the Plaintiff only raised section 273(1) of the BGB. 216', 'I agree that it was not pleaded, and given that: (a) section 273(1) also raises a right of retention; (b) the Plaintiff amended its Reply and Defence to Counterclaim four times without thinking to plead the application of condition 11; 217', 'and (c) the litany of claims and defences already put into issue, I decline to consider whether the condition applies. In fact, given that condition 11 and section 273(1) prescribe different requirements for the right of retention to be invoked, it is incumbent on the Plaintiff to plead each provision on which it relies. For completeness, I highlight that the Plaintiff does not address its failure to plead condition 11 in its reply submissions. 218', '144\\u2003As regards section 273(1) of the BGB, the applicability of the defence can be dismissed on the grounds that the Plaintiff did not expressly invoke it at the time it purported to exercise its right of retention. Professor Lehmann\u2019s position, which the Plaintiff accepted in a bid to bolster its unpleaded case on condition 11, 219', 'is as follows: 220', '145\\u2003Here, the Professor is saying that while the right under section 273(1) of the BGB needs to be expressly invoked, that under condition 11, need not be. It is not the Plaintiff\u2019s case that it expressly invoked section 273(1), so on the evidence of its own expert, this defence fails.', '146\\u2003I return now to the chronology of the parties\u2019 dispute. It can be seen from the section above that the Misdescription, Misrepresentation, MFDS Inquiry, and Parallel Imports Issues came to a head sometime in early October 2016. The Defendant had raised these issues in an email sent on 3 October 2016. 221', 'Thereafter, board members of the Plaintiff communicated internally that its relationship with the Defendant \u201c[had] reached the end of the road\u201d (the \u201cEnd of the Road Pronouncement\u201d). 222', '147\\u2003Shortly after this pronouncement, the following also took place \u2013 the Plaintiff: (a) halted delivery of the Haribo Group\u2019s products to the Defendant, as well as cancelled planned production of products ordered by the Defendant (this being connected to Product Delivery Issue discussed above); 223', 'and (b) instructed its employees to cease communications with the Defendant. 224', 'Then, on 25 October 2016, these issues and disputes culminated in the Plaintiff issuing its First Termination Notice.', '148\\u2003Given the Defendant\u2019s interpretation of the 2016 DA \u2013 that cl 8.7 operated as a precondition to the right of termination under cl 7.2 \u2013 at the time the First Termination Notice was issued, it refused to accept the validity of such notice. Instead, on 31 October 2016, it wrote to the Plaintiff and demanded its retraction. 225', 'The Plaintiff responded with its position that the notice was effective, and that it was not willing to rescind it. 226', '149\\u2003Unsurprisingly, given the acrimony between the parties at this stage, the Defendant maintained its position.

As the phrase, \u201cbusiness obligations, debts and investment losses\u201d is slightly ambiguous, I thought it necessary for it to be seen in that light. That said, I hasten to add that, whether Dr Goh was being truthful as to the fact that all \u201cS$18 million worth of RMB\u201d in the HSBC-GZ Account had been lost to gambling, was not an issue I needed to determine for the purposes of finding him in contempt.', '12\\u2003I return then to the chronology of events after D&N learnt of Dr Goh\u2019s response to the OA\u2019s office on 27 August 2020.

They would not indicate the identities of these \u201cChinese businessmen\u201d. Second, given the minimal utility of such statements, that Dr Goh was to file a further affidavit \u2013 no later than 30 September 2020 \u2013 identifying the \u201cChinese businessmen\u201d and providing documentary proof of the financial obligations owed to them. 15', 'On 5 October 2020, Dr Goh responded by email stating, essentially, that he was not able to remember, nor did he have any relevant documents. 16', '16\\u2003In light of this unhelpful response, on 12 October 2020, the Plaintiff filed an application to commence the present contempt proceedings against Dr Goh.

During these proceedings, Dr Goh said that the \u201cChinese businessmen\u201d referenced in his earlier 22 September 2020 email were, in fact, casino junkets. He claimed to be a very big gambler, and that he had lost the Funds in the HSBC-GZ Account on gambling in Macau. Specifically, he stated that both amounts of \u00a539,428,736 and \u00a546,720,151.01 \u2013 forming the subject of the HSBC Orders \u2013 were completely lost in this way. 17', 'This was first time Dr Goh raised his gambling habit (cross-reference [11] above), and it was a position he maintained during the contempt proceedings.', '18\\u2003In summary, in July and August 2020, Dr Goh affirmed two affidavits in which he stated unequivocally that he could not remember what had happened to the Funds in his HSBC-GZ Account. These two affidavits were prepared pursuant to ORC 3219 and served on the Plaintiff. However, in August 2020, Dr Goh informed the OA\u2019s office that the Funds had been used to pay off \u201cbusiness obligations, debts and investment losses incurred in China\u201d. When questioned further by the Plaintiff in September 2020, he then departed from his position that he \u201ccould not remember\u201d, and told the Plaintiff that the Funds had been paid to \u201cChinese businessmen\u201d, though he claimed to be unable to remember who these individuals were. Finally, in April 2021, Dr Goh sought to clarify in the Examination Proceedings that the \u201cChinese businessmen\u201d he mentioned in September 2020 were, in fact, casino junkets.', '19\\u2003With this sequence of events in mind, I turn to the contempt proceedings which took place before me on 30 August and 19 October 2021.'"}

{"casename":"2021_SGHC_284","fact":"'5\\u2003The underlying facts of this matter are set out in my judgment. I summarise them briefly here.', '6\\u2003On 28 October 2011, Shanmugam and Suief (collectively, the \u201cCouriers\u201d) trafficked in not less than 28.50g of diamorphine in furtherance of their common intention. After a joint trial in 2014 (the \u201c2014 trial\u201d), they were convicted; Shanmugam was sentenced to life imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane, while Suief was sentenced to death. Their convictions and respective sentences were upheld on appeal.', '7\\u2003In the course of investigations, Shanmugam implicated the accused as the mastermind behind the drug transaction on 28 October 2011. The accused was arrested in Malaysia and extradited to Singapore in 2016.', '8\\u2003The accused was tried on the Charge in 2018. Following the trial (the \u201c2018 trial\u201d), I convicted him of the Charge. In my judgment, I found inter alia that the Prosecution had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had indeed introduced Shanmugam to Suief at West Coast McDonald\u2019s on 12 October 2011 for the purpose of facilitating an impending drug transaction (at [111]\u2013[112]). I considered that the Couriers\u2019 accounts were consistent in all material aspects, including the timing and location of the meeting, the purpose of the meeting and how the introduction took place (at [89]).', '9\\u2003The accused filed two criminal motions seeking leave to adduce fresh evidence for his appeal, which the Court of Appeal granted. The new evidence thus adduced consists of: 3', '(a)\\u2003Statements made by Suief in 2011, namely:', '(b)\\u2003Statements made by Shanmugam in 2011, namely:', '(c)\\u2003The SingTel Call Trace Report for \u201cB2-HP2\u201d (ie Suief\u2019s mobile phone 98944870) (the \u201cCall Trace Report\u201d); and', '(d)\\u2003Travel movement records from the Immigration Checkpoint Authority (\u201cICA\u201d), for:', '10\\u2003At the appeal hearing before the Court of Appeal on 30 June 2021, the Court of Appeal remitted the matter to me to consider the two questions set out at [2] above. 4', '11\\u2003For the remittal, both the Defence and the Prosecution tendered substantially the same submissions that they had made to the Court of Appeal, notwithstanding that the questions posed by the Court of Appeal were specific and limited in scope. I heard oral submissions from the Defence and the Prosecution on 30 July 2021. To facilitate the evidential analysis and a comparison of the new evidence with the trial evidence, I requested the parties to prepare an agreed Excel spreadsheet based on a specific format containing all the evidence material to the questions to be answered. The parties\u2019 Agreed Table of Evidence was submitted to me on 14 September 2021.', '12\\u2003Although the first question posed by the Court of Appeal asks me to evaluate whether the new evidence affects my finding concerning the Alleged Introductory Meeting, the Defence has woven that new evidence together with the trial evidence which was previously before me into a number of arguments against my finding. I will therefore consider each of these arguments in turn, taking into account both the previously available and the new evidence.', '13\\u2003The arguments made by the Defence in relation to the Alleged Introductory Meeting may be summarised as follows:', '(a)\\u2003My finding that the Alleged Introductory Meeting had taken place on 12 October 2011 ran against the grain of the evidence, as both Suief and Shanmugam had testified that the Alleged Introductory Meeting had taken place in the afternoon or evening. 5', 'Yet, in the afternoon and evening of 12 October 2011, the accused and Shanmugam were not even in Singapore. 6', 'The Alleged Introductory Meeting could not have taken place then.', '(b)\\u2003Instead, the evidence indicates that the meeting at which the Couriers first met each other must have been around 24 October 2011 instead, a time when the accused was not in Singapore. 7', '(c)\\u2003Further, it is extremely unlikely that the Alleged Introductory Meeting could have taken place on 12 October 2011 as recounted by the Couriers, as Shanmugam was only in Singapore on that day for a relatively brief period (from 7.24am to 9.36am). 8', '14\\u2003The Defence points out that the Couriers had consistently stated that the Alleged Introductory Meeting took place in the afternoon or the evening. The Agreed Table of Evidence 9', 'sets out the positive statements made by the Couriers in relation to the time of day at which the Alleged Introductory Meeting was said to have taken place. I set out below an extract from that table:', '15\\u2003The Defence places particular emphasis on the newly adduced 2011 statements from the Couriers. It argues that these statements were recorded within three weeks of the alleged 12 October 2011 meeting. At such close proximity, the time of day would have been fresh in the Couriers\u2019 minds. There was also no reason at the time for Shanmugam and Suief to admit to the Alleged Introductory Meeting but lie about the timing. 17', '16\\u2003I do not think that these statements are as \u201cextremely critical\u201d and dispositive as the Defence makes them out to be in relation to the time of the Alleged Introductory Meeting. 18', 'At the outset, I observe that the 2011 statements suffer from the same issues of credibility that I attributed to the Couriers\u2019 evidence at the 2014 trial (see [71]\u2013[73] of my judgment). In 2011, as in 2014, the Couriers would have been attempting to avoid incriminating themselves. These statements must be taken with the proverbial pinch of salt.', '17\\u2003However, even if I were to take the 2011 statements at face value, I note that there is a considerable difference between Shanmugam\u2019s evidence and Suief\u2019s evidence in relation to the time of the Alleged Introductory Meeting. If the time of the Alleged Introductory Meeting were to be so fresh in their minds, I would have expected their evidence to be much more similar. Moreover, neither Suief nor Shanmugam were individually consistent in the times they gave, from their 2011 statements up to the 2018 trial.', '18\\u2003Accordingly, I do not find Suief and Shanmugam\u2019s evidence in relation to the time of the Alleged Introductory Meeting to be reliable. What I do find to be entirely consistent and reliable is their evidence before me at the 2018 trial of a meeting sometime in October 2011 at the West Coast McDonald\u2019s carpark where the accused was present and had personally introduced Shanmugam to Suief. It is not surprising that the Couriers might have correctly remembered these facts while misremembering the time of the Alleged Introductory Meeting: memories of a meeting\u2019s location, participants and purposes are more likely to stay with a person and for far longer than the time and actual date of the meeting. Unless there was a particular reason for the date and time of the Alleged Introductory Meeting to be seared into the Couriers\u2019 memories, or unless they kept some form of documentary evidence, inconsistencies and inaccuracies in this respect are to be expected. As matters stand, the 2018 trial evidence of Suief and Shanmugam indicates that the Alleged Introductory Meeting did indeed take place between the two of them and the accused. Based on the ICA travel movement records of the accused and Shanmugam, the only possible time and date for that meeting was the morning of 12 October 2011. I therefore consider my finding that the Alleged Introductory Meeting took place then to be undisturbed by the Defence\u2019s argument, which was based on a certain apparent consistency concerning the time of day for the meeting (which, as explained above, is not in fact as consistent as made out to be).', '19\\u2003I conclude my analysis of this issue with two observations.', '20\\u2003The first relates to my reliance on the Couriers\u2019 evidence at the 2018 trial that the accused was the one who introduced the two of them. The Defence suggests that this is undermined by Suief\u2019s 30 October 2011 statement, in which he did not identify the accused as being present at the meeting between himself and Shanmugam. 19', '21\\u2003However, as stated at [16] above, the 2011 statements were made while the Couriers were fighting to avoid liability. The Prosecution rightly points out that Suief may have been attempting to obfuscate the truth to distance himself from both Shanmugam and the accused. 20', 'In all other instances, Suief was consistent in identifying \u201cPuni\u201d as having been present. 21', 'I therefore give no weight to Suief\u2019s failure to identify the accused in his 30 October 2011 statement.', '22\\u2003The second observation I make is that if I were to accept the Defence\u2019s submissions on this time-of-day issue, that would entail finding that in truth, the Couriers were introduced at an afternoon or evening meeting, which could not have been on 12 October 2011 and which the accused could not have been part of, but then each Courier decided \u2013 for reasons unknown \u2013 to identify the accused as having been the person who was present at the meeting to introduce them.', '23\\u2003To shore up this version of events, the Defence has put forth a theory for why Suief may have wanted to falsely incriminate the accused. It suggests that \u201c[i]t is also possible that the [accused], being a debt collector, had offended someone in the drug syndicate who had placed pressure on Suief to set the [accused] up\u201d. 22', 'In support of this, the Defence cites the evidence of a prison inmate, Tamil Alagan a\/l Gunasekaran (\u201cTamil\u201d), who testified at the trial before me that Shanmugam had passed a message to him via an intermediary asking him to falsely incriminate the accused.', '24\\u2003However, I specifically rejected Tamil\u2019s testimony in my judgment, because he had no way of knowing whether the message had come from Shanmugam (at [81(c)]). There is little else the Defence has raised in support of this speculation. As the Prosecution notes, there was nothing from the accused himself during the trial to suggest that he had in the course of his debt collection offended someone to the point where that person might induce the Couriers to frame him. 23', 'I therefore do not accept this speculation.', '25\\u2003Quite apart from why the Couriers might have framed the accused, there is also the need to examine the probability of the Defence\u2019s false incrimination theory being true. The Defence\u2019s false incrimination theory, if true, implies a number of highly unlikely coincidences. First, in his 31 October 2011 statement, five years before the accused\u2019s arrest, Shanmugam identified the person who introduced him to Suief as \u201cPuni\u201d, 24', 'which happens coincidentally to correspond partially to the accused\u2019s name, Punithan a\/l Genasan.', '26\\u2003Second, neither Shanmugam nor the accused (both Malaysians living in Malaysia) spent much time in Singapore in the weeks leading up to Shanmugam\u2019s arrest. In the month of October 2011, Shanmugam entered Singapore six times 25', '(being arrested on his sixth visit), while the accused entered Singapore twice. 26', 'A quick calculation from their travel records shows that Shanmugam was in Singapore for only about 3.21% of the time from the start of October 2011 to his arrest, while the accused was in Singapore for only about 1.95% of that time. 27', 'The sole period of overlap in their visits \u2013 the morning of 12 October 2011 \u2013 accounts for only a sliver of time. If the accused had indeed met Shanmugam and Suief (a Singaporean living in Singapore) in Singapore in October 2011, then the fact that there was an overlap comes as no surprise. If, however, there was in fact no arrangement whatsoever between Shanmugam and Suief on the one hand, and the accused on the other hand, for any meeting in Singapore at the West Coast McDonald\u2019s carpark in October 2011 (which is what the Defence\u2019s false incrimination theory is largely premised on), then the chance or probability for the two independent events (ie Shanmugam entering Singapore for his own purposes; and the accused entering Singapore for his own purposes unrelated to Shanmugam) to have an overlap is most unlikely. One can imagine spinning two separate roulette wheels, each with 28 numbered slots, one slot for each day in October up to the date of arrest of Shanmugam and Suief. But that metaphor understates how unlikely an overlap is, because they would have had to share not just a common date, but an overlapping time on that common date. This strongly suggests that it was not a mere coincidence but a pre-arrangement for both Shanmugam and the accused to meet Suief in Singapore.', '27\\u2003Third, when Shanmugam and Suief were individually emphatic in their evidence or statements \u2013 dating back to the 2014 trial \u2013 that the accused was present at the West Coast McDonald\u2019s carpark to introduce them sometime in October, they were, without first having any clear idea of what the ICA records might eventually reveal, indirectly predicting the certainty of an overlap in both the date and time of entry into Singapore of Shanmugam and the accused. This was in fact subsequently borne out by the ICA records. I do not believe it was a case of both Shanmugam and Suief being very lucky to have guessed it right. It was more a case that their \u201cluck\u201d came from their knowledge that they had in fact met the accused at the West Coast McDonald\u2019s carpark. Were it to be the case of false evidence being given against the accused by both Shanmugam and Suief (ie the accused had not factually met Shanmugam and Suief at the West Coast McDonald\u2019s carpark), then Shanmugam and Suief would each be playing a very risky game of roulette to predict with absolute confidence the existence of an overlap. In other words, if there was truly no such meeting with the accused, how would Shanmugam and Suief be so sure that the overlap existed?', '28\\u2003It is worth reiterating at this point that the accused\u2019s own case is that he had never known the Couriers. The accused\u2019s own case must be premised on Shanmugam\u2019s and the accused\u2019s entries into Singapore being random independent events. They have to rely on sheer coincidence that there was an Overlap as shown by the ICA records. As explained, the chance of that happening is objectively remote for two independent events, but not if it is a case of a pre-arranged meeting. It also follows that Suief\u2019s and Shanmugam\u2019s foreknowledge of that very unlikely event of an overlap could not simply be explained as the framing of an acquaintance, but by actual knowledge of a meeting that had taken place at the West Coast McDonald\u2019s carpark during which the accused, Shanmugam and Suief were present. In the absence of a plausible explanation as to why the Couriers would wish to frame the accused, I do not find the Defence\u2019s version of events to be credible in the least for the reasons stated.', '29\\u2003I turn now to the Defence\u2019s submission that any introductory meeting between Shanmugam and Suief was more likely to have taken place sometime from 24 October 2011 at 3.57pm to 25 October 2011 at 1.50am, when Shanmugam was in Singapore with his mother and daughter. However, during this time, the accused was not present in Singapore, and so could not have been part of any introductory meeting.', '30\\u2003This submission as to the date of the introductory meeting rests on two planks. The first consists of certain statements from Shanmugam and Suief:', '(a)\\u2003In Shanmugam\u2019s statement recorded on 31 October 2011, Shanmugam appears to state that the meeting took place on 23 or 24 October 2011; 28', '(b)\\u2003In Suief\u2019s statement recorded on 30 October 2011, Suief stated that he first met Shanmugam on 27 October 2011; 29', 'and', '(c)\\u2003At the 2014 trial, Suief testified that he first met Shanmugam on 25 October 2011. 30', '31\\u2003I do not accept that these statements indicate with any strength that the introductory meeting between Shanmugam and Suief took place during Shanmugam\u2019s visit from the afternoon of 24 October 2011 to the early hours of 25 October 2011. A closer inspection immediately reveals that Suief\u2019s statement recorded on 30 October 2011 could not possibly be accurate: Shanmugam was not in Singapore on 27 October 2011. 31', 'Similarly, Suief\u2019s testimony in this respect at the 2014 trial cannot be relied on. Taking into account the time of day he attributed to the meeting (which the Defence has quite readily relied on for their earlier argument as to the time of day of the Alleged Introductory Meeting), Suief\u2019s evidence at the 2014 trial was that the first meeting between himself and Shanmugam was on 25 October 2011 at 4pm to 5pm. Again, Shanmugam was not in Singapore during this window: on 25 October 2011, he left Singapore at 1.52am, and came back at 9.53pm. 32', 'All that is left, then, from this set of statements highlighted by the Defence is Shanmugam\u2019s statement of 31 October 2011, which stands alone and uncorroborated. In truth, the Defence\u2019s focus on these statements strikes me as less of a coherent argument and more of an opportunistic attempt to seize on a vague temporal similarity between the contents of those statements.', '32\\u2003Even if I were to accept that I should regard these statements as collectively \u2013 albeit imprecisely \u2013 gesturing towards an introductory meeting having been held during Shanmugam\u2019s visit to Singapore from 24 October 2011 to 25 October 2011, the question remains whether this version of events raises any reasonable doubt as to my finding that the Alleged Introductory Meeting took place on 12 October 2011. I am of the opinion that it does not. At the trial before me, Suief testified that the meeting occurred \u201c2 to 3 weeks\u201d prior to Deepavali (which fell on 26 October 2011), while Shanmugam said that this meeting took place \u201cabout 3 weeks before the arrest\u201d on 28 October 2011 (see my judgment at [89(a)]). This was consistent with the additional police statements they had given during further police investigations, which took place after they had been sentenced at the 2014 trial (and the relevant appeals had been heard in 2016) but prior to the 2018 trial.', '33\\u2003The Defence emphasises the fact that Suief\u2019s further police statement was given just six days before the 2018 trial. 33', 'Pointing to his plea for a \u201clifer\u201d sentence and his stated fear of death within that same statement, 34', 'the Defence suggests that Suief was a desperate man hoping to gain favour with the police and the Prosecution. Suief thus had to lie about the accused being present at the West Coast McDonald\u2019s carpark to introduce him to Shanmugam. I do not agree. There is no evidence of any threat, inducement or promise of any kind made to Suief to falsely implicate the accused as being present at a meeting at West Coast McDonald\u2019s carpark to introduce them. Whilst the spectre of death may lead one to craven falsehood to invent false facts to assist in investigations, it does not foreclose honesty on the part of Suief telling the true facts to assist in the investigations when he was giving his 2018 statement. As I noted at [74] of my judgment, Suief was a frank and forthright witness. I did not and do not believe that he was merely singing the Prosecution\u2019s tune to falsely implicate the accused, in his own self-induced hope of mercy. If so, Suief would run the risk of displeasing the police and committing another serious criminal offence of falsely accusing the accused in a capital offence should he be found out later to be lying, which would surely extinguish any hope of mercy.', '34\\u2003Consequently, I do not think that the 2011 statements relied upon by the Defence support a finding that the introductory meeting took place on 24 October 2011. Neither do they disturb my finding that the Alleged Introductory Meeting took place on 12 October 2011, which was based on the ICA travel records together with the reliable and consistent evidence of Shanmugam and Suief (which I accepted) that the accused was indeed physically present at the West Coast McDonald\u2019s carpark sometime in October 2011 and had personally introduced Shanmugam to Suief.', '35\\u2003The second plank of the Defence\u2019s argument on this issue consists of the phone records between Shanmugam\u2019s mobile phone, Suief\u2019s mobile phone and the number \u201c+60164978192\u201d (the \u201cMobile Phone Number\u201d). However, to fully consider the significance of these phone records, I have to first deal with the related issue of the ownership of the Mobile Phone Number.', '36\\u2003In my judgment, I found that the Mobile Phone Number belonged to the accused (at [56]\u2013[59]). However, in its appeal, the Defence has challenged this finding. Its main substantive argument involves the newly adduced Call Trace Report. The Defence makes two points: 35', '(a)\\u2003First, the Call Trace Report does not show any calls between Suief\u2019s mobile phone and the Mobile Phone Number prior to 12 October 2011 at 3.58pm. However, Suief\u2019s testimony was that he had received several calls from the accused via the Mobile Phone Number in connection with prior drug deliveries.', '(b)\\u2003Second, Suief testified that the next occasion on which the accused contacted him after 12 October 2011 was 28 October 2011. However, the Call Trace Report demonstrates that there were almost 40 calls between Suief\u2019s mobile phone and the Mobile Phone Number from 12 October 2011 and 28 October 2011.', '37\\u2003These contradictions, the Defence argues, indicate that Suief\u2019s evidence that the Mobile Phone Number belonged to the accused cannot be trusted, and that the Mobile Phone Number did not in fact belong to the accused.', '38\\u2003I do not think that the Defence\u2019s submissions serve to discredit Suief\u2019s testimony in this regard. In relation to its first point, the Call Trace Report was only for the period of 28 September 2011 to 28 October 2011. 36', 'It is not unknown for masterminds and co-ordinators for drug couriers to have several mobile phones and also to change their mobile phone numbers over a period of time to avoid detection. I further note that the Call Trace Report indicates about 1,000 calls from 28 September 2011 to 11 October 2011 to and from Suief\u2019s phone. 37', 'In particular, there were numerous calls between a Malaysian number (60194607771) and Suief\u2019s phone in that time, which ceased after the morning of 12 October 2011 38', '(though no submissions were made in respect of this number). Given the massive number of calls in this time, it remains possible that any one of these could have been an alternate number used to contact Suief. As for the Defence\u2019s second point, it may be that Suief had forgotten about these intervening phone calls. The passage of years often wears memory down to its sharpest and most well-defined features. It would be understandable if Suief, in remembering his arrest on 28 October 2011 and the meeting on 12 October 2011 which led to that arrest, had elided the intervening days and events.', '39\\u2003As I put it in my judgment (at [59]), the crux of the matter is that there must have been a common thread that pulled the Couriers together and coordinated their actions. The Mobile Phone Number was clearly one part of that, and both Shanmugam and Suief testified that the Mobile Phone Number belonged to the accused. I do not think that the new evidence raised by the Defence in the form of the Call Trace Report undermines that testimony in any significant manner.', '40\\u2003I return to the main issue at hand, which is the Defence\u2019s submission that the phone records between Shanmugam\u2019s phone number, Suief\u2019s phone number and the Mobile Phone Number suggest that the introductory meeting between Suief and Shanmugam took place on 24 October 2011. The Defence points out that on that day, there was a flurry of exchanges between the three phone numbers: 39', '(a)\\u2003Four calls and a text between Shanmugam and the Mobile Phone Number; 40', '(b)\\u2003Twenty-one calls between Suief and the Mobile Phone Number; 41', 'and', '(c)\\u2003Six calls between Shanmugam and Suief. 42', '41\\u2003However, the Defence has not explained how this burst of activity over the phone suggests in any way a physical meeting between Shanmugam and Suief on this date. There might have been any number of reasons for these calls; for instance, as the Prosecution pointed out, they might have related to other drug transactions. 43', 'In any case, even if there was a meeting between Shanmugam and Suief on this date, that does not mean that Shanmugam and Suief had not been physically introduced to each other by the accused on 12 October 2011, at the West Coast McDonald\u2019s carpark.', '42\\u2003Put simply, bearing in mind my finding that (a) the Alleged Introductory Meeting took place on 12 October 2011 between the Couriers and the accused, and (b) the Mobile Phone Number belonged to the accused, there is nothing surprising or unexpected about this flurry of exchanges on 24 October 2011. In other words, this flurry of exchanges on 24 October 2011 does not in any discernible way challenge my finding. If anything, given my finding that the Mobile Phone Number belonged to the accused, the Call Trace Records appear to confirm that the accused was the common thread pulling the Couriers together.', '43\\u2003My analysis above of the Defence\u2019s case on the 2011 statements and the phone records suffices for me to reject the Defence\u2019s theory that the introductory meeting between Suief and Shanmugam, if there was one, actually took place on 24 October 2011.', '44\\u2003Finally, the Defence argues that there was simply not enough time for the Alleged Introductory Meeting to have taken place during Shanmugam\u2019s visit to Singapore in the morning of 12 October 2011, from 7.24am to 9.36am. The Defence suggests that it is implausible for the following sequence of events to have fitted in that window of time: 44', '(a)\\u2003Extensive checks were conducted on Shanmugam\u2019s car at Woodlands Checkpoint;', '(b)\\u2003Shanmugam would then have had to drive from Woodlands Checkpoint to the Woodlands McDonald\u2019s car park to meet the accused;', '(c)\\u2003Shanmugam would then have had to drive to the West Coast McDonald\u2019s car park during peak hour traffic;', '(d)\\u2003The Alleged Introductory Meeting between Shanmugam, Suief and the accused would have had to take place;', '(e)\\u2003Thereafter, Suief drove the car with license plate number JLT 8467 (the \u201cKenari car\u201d) away for about 45 minutes; and', '(f)\\u2003Shanmugam would finally have had to drive from the West Coast McDonald\u2019s car park to Woodlands Checkpoint during peak hour traffic.', '45\\u2003I do not agree with the Defence that it was extremely unlikely for all of the above to have taken place during Shanmugam\u2019s visit. It would be a mistake to focus too much on how tightly the above sequence of events had to fit in the two-hours-and-twelve-minutes window of Shanmugam\u2019s visit. The better way to think about this would be from Shanmugam\u2019s perspective: he came to Singapore specifically for this meeting and had no reason to tarry. It stands to reason that he would take precisely and only as much time as he needed at each step before making a speedy departure.', '46\\u2003In any case, it is not at all clear that each and every one of the events listed above must have happened during the 7.24am to 9.36am window of Shanmugam\u2019s visit:', '(a)\\u2003Although Shanmugam testified that immigration officers had performed a \u201cthorough check\u201d on his car at Woodlands Checkpoint, 45', 'he did not mention how long this check took. It is also not clear whether this check was performed before or after Shanmugam was registered as having entered Singapore at 7.24am.', '(b)\\u2003I considered the possibility that Shanmugam might have been telling the truth about Suief taking away the Kenari car for 45 minutes in my judgment at [113]\u2013[115]. However, I did not make a finding on whether this had truly happened, because it was not necessary for the purposes of the Charge (at [90(b)]). In any event, even if the Kenari car had been taken away in this manner, it is possible that Shanmugam could have overestimated the period of time involved.', '47\\u2003In short, I do not consider the Defence to have raised a reasonable doubt as to whether the Alleged Introductory Meeting could have taken place on 12 October 2011.'"}

The Buyer asserted that the Preforms were generic,9 so \nthere was an available market for the Preforms,10 and s 50(3) of the SOGA \nwould apply.11 The Buyer further contended that damages claimed by the Seller \nwould be kept at a minimum as it had not acted reasonably to mitigate its losses; \nand if it had chosen not to sell any preforms at all in the relevant period, it would \nnot have suffered any loss.12\n6 Statement of claim, paras 84\u201387 (ABOD 161).\n7 Defence (ABOD 166), paras 68\u201373 (ABOD 189\u2013191).\n8 Defence, para 177 (ABOD 222).\n9 Defence, paras 9, 46 (ABOD 171, 184).\n10 Defence, paras 48\u201350 (ABOD 184).\n11 Defence, paras 108\u2013111 (ABOD 203\u2013204).\n12 Defence, para 111 (ABOD 204).\nVersion No 1: 28 Dec 2021 (11:29 hrs)\nCNQ v CNR [2021] SGHC 287\n6The Seller\u2019s reply\n17 In its reply to the Buyer\u2019s defence, the Seller elaborated on why the \nPreforms were not generic,13 and reiterated its claim for damages pursuant to the \nmeasure of damages under s 50(2), not s 50(3), of the SOGA.14\nThe Seller\u2019s use of s 50(3) of the SOGA\n18 Although the Seller\u2019s pleaded case was that s 50(3) of the SOGA did not \napply as there was no available market for the Preforms, the Seller sought to \nclaim damages under s 50(2) using a measure of damages similar to that under \ns 50(3).\n19 Specifically, the Seller contended that it should be awarded damages on \nthe basis of the contract price for the Preforms, less a \u201cHypothetical Market \nPrice\u201d derived using the market price of optical fiber as a comparable product. \nThe tribunal awarded damages against the Buyer on this basis.\n20 Although the Seller took reference from s 50(3) of the SOGA in \nformulating the measure of damages claimed, its pleaded position was that \ns 50(3) did not apply as there was no available market for the Preforms.\nThe Seller\u2019s witness statements\n21 In the first witness statement of the Seller\u2019s witness Mr [X],15 he stated \nat para 62 that the Preforms supplied to the Buyer under the Agreement are \ntailor-made, and it was difficult to sell them to any other company without re-\n13 Reply (ABOD 233) paras 104\u2013112 (ABOD 276\u2013279).\n14 Reply, paras 95\u201397 (ABOD 273\u2013274).\n15 ABOD 346.\nVersion No 1: 28 Dec 2021 (11:29 hrs)\nCNQ v CNR [2021] SGHC 287\n7processing, and therefore \u201cin the strict sense of the term, there is no \u2018market \nprice\u2019 of such products to speak of.\u201d16\n22 In para 69 of that witness statement, Mr [X] then referred to s 50(3) of \nthe SOGA, saying he had been advised that if there is an available market for a \nproduct, the difference between the market price and the contract price was \nconsidered to be the prima facie amount of damages. He said that the Seller thus \nregarded the difference between (a) the \u201cmarket\u201d price of preforms (calculated \nby adjusting the contract price of the Preforms by the rate of decrease in the \nprice of optical fiber) \u2013 the \u201cHypothetical Market Price\u201d; and (b) the contract \nprice of the Preforms, to be \u201can indicator of damages incurred\u201d by the Seller.\n23 In Mr [X]\u2019s second witness statement,17 he maintained that there was no \navailable market for the Preforms under the Agreement. At paras 21\u201327,18 he \nsaid that the Preforms manufactured for the Buyer cannot be considered to be \ngeneric products. At para 25 he said, \u201cthe preforms [the Seller] supplies to [the \nBuyer] are different from the preforms [the Seller] supplies to other optical fiber \nmanufacturers. Accordingly, the preforms [the Seller] manufactures for [the \nBuyer] cannot simply be sold to other customers as they are without any re-\nprocessing\u201d. At para 27 he then said, \u201c[the Buyer\u2019s witness] further states that \nthere is an available market for preforms. Insofar as [the Buyer\u2019s witness] is \nsuggesting that the preforms which [the Buyer] has refused to accept could be \nsold to other optical fiber manufacturers, I disagree.\u201d\n16 ABOD 372.\n17 ABOD 423.\n18 ABOD 431\u2013434.\nVersion No 1: 28 Dec 2021 (11:29 hrs)\nCNQ v CNR [2021] SGHC 287\n8The lists of issues\n24 In the Seller\u2019s list of issues,19 it did not cite s 50(3) of the SOGA.

[The Seller\u2019s] position is that there is an \u201cavailable \nmarket\u201d for preforms as a class of goods that is used to produce \noptical fiber and fiber cables, such that section 50(3) of the \nSOGA applies in determining [the Seller\u2019s] measure of damages.\n177. [The Seller] has applied the measure of loss under \nsection 50(3) of the SOGA as comprising the price of preforms \nunder the Agreement less the hypothetical market price of \npreforms (\u201cHypothetical Market Price approach\u201d) \u2026\n[emphasis in original in bold; emphasis added in italics]\n31 The Seller\u2019s para 176 submission that there was an available market for \npreforms generally, contradicted its counsel\u2019s earlier oral submission (in his oral \n24 ABOD 883.\nVersion No 1: 28 Dec 2021 (11:29 hrs)\nCNQ v CNR [2021] SGHC 287\n11opening and oral closing) that there was no available market for preforms, even \ngenerally (as noted in the preceding section).\n32 Moreover, taking at face value the Seller\u2019s submission that \u201csection \n50(3) of the SOGA applies\u201d, that was not the position it had pleaded and \nmaintained till that point, which was: s 50(3) did not apply; but it could, in \nclaiming under s 50(2), use an approach similar to that under s 50(3).\n33 The Seller nevertheless continued to assert that the Preforms under the \ncontract were not generic.25 This position, which the Seller maintained \nthroughout the arbitration, would mean that there was no available market for \nthe Preforms under the Agreement (and consequently no market price for those \nPreforms) and so s 50(3) of the SOGA would not apply. Consistent with this, \nthe Seller\u2019s para 176 submission referred to an available market for \u201cpreforms \nas a class of goods\u201d, rather than to an available market for the Preforms under \nthe Agreement.\n34 The Seller concluded that part of its written submissions as follows: \u201cIn \nconclusion, the only two components that are relevant for determining [the \nSeller\u2019s] claim for damages are (a) the contract price of preforms under the \nAgreement and (b) the hypothetical market price of such preforms.\u201d26 [emphasis \nadded]\n35 Given the Seller\u2019s position that there was no available market for the \nPreforms under the Agreement, it used the Hypothetical Market Price \u2013 a \nhypothetical price, from a hypothetical market. That is not the measure of \ndamages under s 50(3) of the SOGA, which requires \u201can available market for \n25 ABOD 934, para 184; see also ABOD 943, para 211(a).\n26 ABOD 935, para 187.\nVersion No 1: 28 Dec 2021 (11:29 hrs)\nCNQ v CNR [2021] SGHC 287\n12the goods in question\u201d, ie, the Preforms under the Agreement, and compares the \n\u201ccontract price and the market or current price of the goods\u201d [emphasis added].\n36 It thus appears that the Seller was still maintaining its claim under \ns 50(2) of the SOGA using an approach similar to that under s 50(3), rather than \nmaking some claim directly under s 50(3) whilst taking the inconsistent position \nthat there was no available market for the goods in question, ie, the Preforms \nunder the Agreement. I shall return to this when I review the award, for the \ntribunal essentially accepted the Seller\u2019s contentions in awarding damages (see \n[47]\u2013[ 68] below).\nThe Buyer\u2019s written closing submissions\n37 In the Buyer\u2019s written closing submissions27 (which were put in \nconcurrently with the Seller\u2019s written closing submissions),28 the Buyer \nsubmitted at para 212:29\nIn the present dispute [the Seller] has sought the relief of price \nof monthly shipments of 3000kg. of [Preforms] from February \nto December 2019 under Section 49(2) of USD [XYZ] and in the \nalternative, damages under Section 50(3) of SOGA of USD [ABC] \nbased on the computation of loss of profit on the basis of a \nhypothetical market price of preform ([Preform]).\n38 The Buyer described the Seller\u2019s claim based on the Hypothetical \nMarket Price as being for \u201cdamages under Section 50(3) of SOGA\u201d, and \nresponded to that.\n27 ABOD 818.\n28 ABOD 883.\n29 ABOD 869.\nVersion No 1: 28 Dec 2021 (11:29 hrs)\nCNQ v CNR [2021] SGHC 287\n1339 Why was the Buyer referring to the Seller\u2019s claim in those terms, when \nthe Seller\u2019s position hitherto had been that it was claiming under s 50(2) of the \nSOGA, but using an approach similar to that under s 50(3)? The Buyer had yet \nto see the Seller\u2019s para 176 submission that \u201csection 50(3) of the SOGA \napplies\u201d, yet it characterised the Seller\u2019s damages claim as being for \u201cdamages \nunder Section 50(3) of SOGA\u201d. Furthermore, the Buyer did not say that such a \nclaim was not open to the Seller on its pleaded case.\n40 Perhaps the Buyer was simply referring to the Seller\u2019s claim under \ns 50(2) of the SOGA using an approach similar to that under s 50(3), as a claim \nfor \u201cdamages under Section 50(3) of the SOGA\u201d. If so, might the Seller have \ndone likewise, in saying \u201csection 50(3) of the SOGA applies\u201d in its para 176 \nsubmission?\n41 In any event, it is clear that the Buyer had the opportunity to respond to \na claim for \u201cdamages under Section 50(3) of SOGA\u201d, as the Buyer put it in its \nwritten closing submissions.\nThe Buyer\u2019s rebuttal submissions\n42 There was also a round of written reply\/rebuttal submissions.\n43 In the Buyer\u2019s rebuttal,30 it did not say that paras 176\u2013177 of the Seller\u2019s \nwritten submissions articulated a claim that was not open to the Seller on its \npleaded case.\n44 Instead, the Buyer responded to paras 161\u2013187 of the Seller\u2019s written \nclosing submissions (which included paras 176\u2013177) by saying, \u201c[the Buyer] \n30 ABOD 947.\nVersion No 1: 28 Dec 2021 (11:29 hrs)\nCNQ v CNR [2021] SGHC 287\n14has already explained numerous flaws relating to irrelevant market, imperfect \ncorrelation, etc. in the computation of damages provided by [the Seller] in the \nclosing submissions.\u201d31 At para 86 of the Buyer\u2019s rebuttal,32 the Buyer \nspecifically addressed the Seller\u2019s para 176 submission by reiterating that there \nwas an available market for Preforms under the Agreement, and submitting that \nthe Buyer\u2019s reliance on legal authorities in cases where there was no available \nmarket, was inapplicable and misplaced. Evidently the Buyer did not understand \nthe Seller\u2019s para 176 submission to mean that the Seller was claiming under s \n50(3) of the SOGA (which requires an available market for the Preforms) \u2013 the \nBuyer knew the Seller maintained that there was no available market for those \nPreforms.\nThe tribunal\u2019s findings\n45 The tribunal found the Buyer to be in breach of contract, for non-\nacceptance of the Preforms under the Agreement for the period from February \nto December 2019.\n46 The tribunal awarded the Seller damages based on the Seller\u2019s proposed \nmeasure: contract price of the Preforms, less the Hypothetical Market Price.\nThe tribunal\u2019s references to s 50(3) of the SOGA\n47 At para 137 of the award, the tribunal set out a list of issues, including \n\u201c[w]hether [the Seller] has suffered any loss directly and naturally resulting \nfrom [the Buyer\u2019s] wrongful non-acceptance [under s 50(2) of the SOGA]\u201d.33 \n31 ABOD 967, para 84.\n32 ABOD 968.\n33 Award, para 137(e)(v) (ABOD 1033).\nVersion No 1: 28 Dec 2021 (11:29 hrs)\nCNQ v CNR [2021] SGHC 287\n15The tribunal addressed this issue at paras 222\u2013258 of the award.34 In doing so, \nhowever, the tribunal cited s 50(3) of the SOGA at paras 230\u2013231, 234, 254\u2013\n257, and 258(d) of the award. I set out paras 230\u2013234, 252\u2013258 of the award \nbelow:\n230. I accept that the measure of loss under Section 50(3) of \nthe SOGA is the Price of Preforms under the Agreement less the \nmarket price of preforms, what [the Seller] describes as the \nHypothetical Market Price. [The Seller\u2019s] position is that there is \nan available market for preforms as a class of goods that is used \nto produce optical fiber and fiber cables, but even if there is no \navailable market, [the Seller] is free to compute what it \nconsiders to be the value of those goods to it, including by \nreference to comparable products. [The Buyer] also submits \nthat there is a market for preforms, but does not agree with \neither [the Seller\u2019s] Hypothetical Market Price or that [the Seller] \nput forward its own evidence of market price. I accept both \nParties\u2019 common position that there is an available market for \npreforms. I do not find it helpful to go by [the Seller\u2019s] alternative \nargument that [the Seller] is free to compute what it considers \nto be the value of those goods to it, given the lack of information \nand evidence on what this might be. The case cited by [the \nSeller], Avra Commodities Pte Ltd v China Coal Solution \n(Singapore) Pte Ltd, is a case where the High Court found that \nthere was a market for the goods in question, and used the \nmarket price of a comparable product as evidence. I shall return \nto this case below.\n231. Some adjustments have to be made. First, the contract \nPrice for Preforms under the Agreement is the price for preforms \nmanufactured according to the specifications in the Agreement. \nI accept [the Seller\u2019s] evidence that, once the preforms are \nmanufactured for [the Buyer], they are customised for [the \nSeller\u2019s] requirements. They were specially designed by [the \nSeller] for [the Buyer] and can no longer be considered generic, \nonce they are manufactured. However, where they have not \nbeen manufactured for [the Buyer], the raw materials can be \nmade into preforms to meet any customer\u2019s requirements. In \nthat sense, [the Seller] says, there is a market for preforms \ngenerally. I quote [the Seller\u2019s] explanation in"}
{"casename":"2021_SGHC_288","fact":"facts as I find are that, the fourth defendant, DW-3, \nMr Maroju (\u201cMr Maroju\u201d), who was then a client manager with Standard \nChartered Bank, told Mr Sharma that the first defendant, Raffles Asset \nManagement (S) Pte Ltd (\u201cRAM\u201d) could invest (a euphemism for \u201clend\u201d) \nUS$5m to Mr Sharma for his Lotus Group\u2019s coal mining business in Indonesia. \nThe plaintiff was incorporated at the suggestion of Mr Maroju in 2016 for the \nconvenience of receiving the loan. The plaintiff was also intended to hold shares \nin PT Lotus Indonesia. RAM was a S$20 company owned by DW-1, the third \ndefendant, Mr Kamil bin Jumat (\u201cMr Kamil\u201d), who lives at Pasir Ris. Mr Jumat \nis also a shareholder and director of the AKS Consultants Pte Ltd (\u201cAKS\u201d), the \nsecond defendant.\n3 Mr Maroju subsequently represented to Mr Sharma that the investor was \nwilling to increase the loan to US$10m. However, the preconditions were that \nhe, Mr Maroju, wanted US$100,000 as a commission for finding the lender, and \nhe expected the commission to be paid straightaway because, he said that the \ndeal \u201cwas as good as secured\u201d. Mr Sharma also had to pay US$500,000 as a \ndeposit of good faith. This sum was to be paid to a stakeholder, then identified \nas the second defendant, AKS. Sharma has also to transfer US$100,000 to be \nused for the purposes of a due diligence exercise. This sum was also to be paid \nto AKS. It was suggested that the plaintiff be incorporated because the lender \npreferred to deal with a Singapore company.\n4 The idea thus, was simple and straightforward. Maroju would find a \nlender to lend US$10m to Mr Sharma (or the Lotus companies) through the \nplaintiff. Mr Sharma was to arrange a payment of a deposit of US$500,000 to \nAKS to be held as a stakeholder as \u201cmargin money\u201d. There is no evidence as to \nhow this margin may be called, but that did not arise as an issue before me. \nVersion No 1: 20 Dec 2021 (12:10 hrs)\nEpoch Minerals Pte Ltd v[2021] SGHC 288\nRaffles Asset Management (S) Pte Ltd\n3Another US100,000 was to be paid (and was paid) to Mr Maroju for a job as \ngood as done \u2013 but in fact, was not. There was no loan of any amount, and when \nMr Sharma eventually asked that his deposit be returned, he was told that the \nmoney was no longer with AKS. \n5 The payments amounting to US$700,000 to RAM and Mr Maroju were \nmade between 4 October 2016 and 3 November 2016. But sometime in \nDecember, Mr Maroju told Mr Sharma that he was unable to obtain the US$10m \nby the end of the year. A disappointed Mr Sharma wrote to Mr Maroju on \n16 December telling him to find a confirmed loan by 19 December. That was \nwhen Mr Maroju began a teasing manoeuvre of dangling a \u201cTerm Sheet\u201d \n(eventually described as the \u201cInvestment Agreement\u201d) before Mr Sharma, a \ndocument which they needed to finalise with RAM. At the same time, \nMr Sharma was told that AKS was finalising its due diligence report, which, it \nnow seems, was part of the tease to buy time for Mr Maroju, whose \u201calmost as \ngood as done\u201d deal was nowhere near as good or as done. On the Term Sheet \ndated 2 January 2017, the lender, now revealed by Mr Maroju to Mr Sharma as \nRAM, proposed to disburse the US$10m in two tranches, one on 31 January \n2017 and the second 30 days later. The time-delaying dance thus began, \ncontinued as Mr Maroju must have hoped \u2014 Mr Sharma found clauses that \nwere contrary to what Mr Maroju had orally promised. Thus, the Term Sheet \nbecame the subject of negotiation, but after receiving Mr Maroju\u2019s email of \n13 January 2017 promising that RAM \u201cwill commence the investment process \nupon receipt of the [Term Sheet]\u201d. This was forwarded to Mr Amarpreet by \nMr Sharma, and Mr Amarpreet signed the Term Sheet on 13 January 2017. \nDespite both RAM and the plaintiff signing the Term Sheet, not a cent was \nadvanced by RAM. \nVersion No 1: 20 Dec 2021 (12:10 hrs)\nEpoch Minerals Pte Ltd v[2021] SGHC 288\nRaffles Asset Management (S) Pte Ltd\n46 On 26 and 27 January 2017, Mr Kamil visited Lotus Indonesia\u2019s offices \nin Jakarta on the pretext of conducting due diligence. No due diligence report \nwas in fact produced. By March 2017, the loan had still not been made, so \nMr Sharma asked Mr Maroju to cancel the purported funding promised under \nthe Term Sheet and demanded for a refund of the margin money. Mr Maroju \nsubsequently told Mr Sharma that the transaction was cancelled, and their \nmargin money would be refunded. Separately, in a letter dated 17 March 2017 \nfrom RAM, Mr Kamil informed Mr Amarpreet that they were unable to proceed \nwith the investment because they were \u201cunable to arrive at a favourable \nconclusion to the due diligence process\u201d. From the e-mail communications from \nMarch 2017 onwards, it was clear that Mr Sharma and Mr Amarpreet persisted \nin seeking a refund, albeit in vain. \n7 By an e-mail dated 4 April 2017, Mr Kamil claimed that the principal \nwas an iron ore mining company operating in Switzerland, but this principal had \nnot refunded the margin. In the course of discovery, AKS disclosed an \nagreement with one Clear Point Enterprises Inc (\u201cClear Point\u201d), under which \nClear Point agreed to pay AKS a sum of US$1.75m per week for 40 weeks in \nreturn for AKS transferring US$500,000 to an escrow agent named \nMichael J Schiff (\u201cSchiff\u201d), under the auspices of a \u201cHumanitarian Project \nProgram\u201d (\u201cthe Humanitarian Contract\u201d). Mr Kamil signed off on the \nHumanitarian Contract on behalf of AKS on 4 November 2016. Monies were \ntransferred from ASK to Schiff on 9 November 2016. In January 2017, AKS \nentered into a separate contract with Clear Point and a Swiss Company, named \nSalt Lake Ore AG (\u201cSLO\u201d), under which AKS and Clear Point would transfer \nUS$500,000 to secure up to US$13.5m funding from SLO. This time, the \n\u201cescrow agent\u201d was one \u201cH. Cy Schaffer Attorney at Law\u201d (\u201cSchaffer\u201d). The \nmargin money was therefore transferred from Schiff to Schaffer around January \nVersion No 1: 20 Dec 2021 (12:10 hrs)\nEpoch Minerals Pte Ltd v[2021] SGHC 288\nRaffles Asset Management (S) Pte Ltd\n52017. All this transpired without the knowledge or consent of the plaintiff, \nMr Sharma, or Mr Amarpreet.\n8 The purpose for paying the US$600,000 to AKS was therefore untrue. \nIt also appears that the untruth was based on a lie. Where there is a lie, there is \na liar. Who is he (or they if there were more than one)? The plaintiff\u2019s claim is \nbased on a conspiracy to defraud. The plaintiff has to show that first, there was \na combination of two or more persons to do certain acts; secondly, the \nconspirators had the intention to cause damage or injury to the plaintiff by those \nacts; thirdly, those acts were unlawful; fourthly, the acts were performed in \nfurtherance of the agreement; and lastly, the plaintiff suffered loss as a result of \nthe conspiracy: EFT Holdings, Inc and another v Marinteknik Shipbuilders (S) \nPte Ltd and another [2014] 1 SLR 860 at [112]. \n9 The plaintiff\u2019s case is that the defendants conspired to induce the \nplaintiff to transfer a total sum of US$700,000 to AKS and Mr Maroju by giving \nthe plaintiff the false impression that RAM\u2019s principal would provide funding \nof US$10m to the plaintiff, causing the margin money of US$500,000 to be \ntransferred out of AKS\u2019s custody for their wrongful use. Mr Kamil carried out \na cursory question and answer session with Mr Amarpreet which he later claims \nto be a due diligence exercise, followed up by some requests for documents. \nThereafter, pretending that the margin money would be placed with the escrow \nagent to divert liability from himself and the other defendants. The other causes \nof action pleaded by the plaintiff include fraudulent misrepresentations by the \ndefendants, breach of trust or breach of contract by Mr Kamil, RAM and AKS \nas trustees of the margin money, dishonest assistance by Mr Kamil, RAM and \nMr Maroju to assist AKS in the breach of its fiduciary duties, and the breach of \nduties owed by Mr Maroju as an agent of the plaintiff.  \nVersion No 1: 20 Dec 2021 (12:10 hrs)\nEpoch Minerals Pte Ltd v[2021] SGHC 288\nRaffles Asset Management (S) Pte Ltd\n610 Neither Mr Sharma nor Mr Amarpreet knew what the defendants were \ndoing in the background. All they knew was the promise of a US$10m loan and \nall that they needed to do was to incorporate the plaintiff and deposit \nUS$600,000 with AKS, and pay US$100,000 outright to Mr Maroju. They knew \nno principal funding the plaintiff. The defence of all the defendants is that some \ncrook somewhere took the money and none of the defendants, essentially, just \nMr Kamil and Mr Maroju, knew anything about it. They say that they have \nnothing to do with the crook.\n11 Almost immediately after the US$500,000 was deposited into AKS (by \n3 November 2016) it was transferred out, first to a Mr Schiff on 9 November \n2016, less than a week later, and from him to a Mr Schaffer, on 17 April 2017. \nSchaffer was described as a lawyer in the United States of America, acting as \nan escrow agent. Incredibly, none of the defendants could find out where \nSchaffer (and the money) had gone. This Schiff-Schaffer sleight of hand was \njust a way of adding more layers to the onion of fraud.\n12 AKS, and the two individual defendants, Mr Kamil and Mr Maroju are \nall separately represented. RAM was not represented because the plaintiff did \nnot proceed against it on the ground that they were bound by an arbitration \nclause in the \u201cthe Term Sheet\u201d. AKS is represented by Mr Andrew Goh. \nMr Kamil is represented by Mr Derek Kang and Mr Ashok Rai, and Mr Maroju \nis represented by Mr Christopher Chong and Mr Josh Tan. Mr Jeremy Gan and \nMr Kevin Tan are counsel for the plaintiff.\n13 Mr Maroju, an Indian national, who lives in Hyderabad, was working as \na private banker with the Standard Chartered Bank when this US$10m loan \nopportunity came up. Mr Chong, his counsel may be hoping to turn a vice into \nVersion No 1: 20 Dec 2021 (12:10 hrs)\nEpoch Minerals Pte Ltd v[2021] SGHC 288\nRaffles Asset Management (S) Pte Ltd\n7a virtue when he submitted that it is absurd for the plaintiff to suggest that a \nStandard Chartered private banker would have breached his duties as agent, \ncommit conspiracy, and assisted in a breach of trust for merely US$100,000. \nOne of the pleasures and challenges of a litigation lawyer is the opportunity to \ninvestigate facts and chase down suspicious claims. Checking with the Standard \nChartered Bank regarding Mr Maroju\u2019s role in this financial transaction might \nhave yielded useful information, especially when he says in his affidavit of \nevidence-in-chief that he often gets requests such as the plaintiff\u2019s, to connect \nthem with other clients. We do not know the position the Standard Chartered \nBank takes in these situations, or for their private bankers to be engaged in other \ncompanies. But we need not digress over what might have been.\n14 I find the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, Mr Sharma and Mr Amarpreet to be \nintelligent, rational, and both impressed me as experienced businessmen. If they \nhad anything to hide, I did not detect it. Given that the US600,000 was being \nheld by a stakeholder, and that the US$100,000 commission to Mr Maroju was \npaid on"}
{"casename":"2021_SGHC_289","fact":"'2\\u2003The facts set out hereinafter below are the Plaintiff\u2019s version. Where his version differed from the Defendant\u2019s version, that will be addressed when the court considers the parties\u2019 pleadings as well as the evidence for the Defendant\u2019s case.', '3\\u2003The Plaintiff was in the employment of the Defendant as a director of sales from 15 January 2018 to 30 September 2019 (a period of 20\u00bd months) pursuant to an employment contract dated 12 December 2017 (\u201cthe Employment Contract\u201d). 1', 'He holds a master\u2019s degree in business administration 2', 'and commercial contract negotiations is one of his specialties.', '4\\u2003Prior to joining the Defendant, the Plaintiff worked for Cisco Systems Pte Ltd (\u201cCisco\u201d) for around ten years holding various positions with the post of sales team manager (global accounts \u2013 ASEAN\/ANZ) being his last appointment. According to the Plaintiff\u2019s Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief (\u201cAEIC\u201d), 3', 'he was one of the top performers during his employment with Cisco. He consistently met his targets and contributed greatly to its growth in sales for global accounts.', '5\\u2003In or about August 2017, the Plaintiff deposed he was approached by a recruitment company TekSystems (Allegis Group Singapore Pte Ltd) (\u201cTekSystems\u201d) in particular by Daniel Wentworth-Sheilds Boyd (\u201cBoyd\u201d) who informed him of an available position as sales director in the Defendant\u2019s organisation. The Plaintiff however had reservations about taking up the post for the reason which is set out below at [7].', '6\\u2003Around 7 September 2016, the Defendant was acquired by Dell Technologies Inc (\u201cDell\u201d), an entity incorporated in the United States. Following Dell\u2019s acquisition, the Defendant underwent internal restructuring and there were resultant employee redundancies. 4', '(Henceforth references to the \u201cDefendant\u201d would, where appropriate, also include references to \u201cDell\u201d).', '7\\u2003In his AEIC, the Plaintiff deposed 5', 'that he was reluctant to leave Cisco because if he did, he stood to lose Restricted Stock Units (\u201cRSUs\u201d) that had been granted to him and were vesting and also future RSUs which would be granted to him if he continued in Cisco\u2019s employment. The value of the RSUs was substantial and it would be foolish of the Plaintiff not to factor such benefits into any future employment offer that he received.', '8\\u2003Consequently, the Plaintiff informed Boyd of his potential loss in RSUs should he leave Cisco. Boyd advised the Plaintiff to attend the Defendant\u2019s hiring interviews and address the Plaintiff\u2019s concerns in subsequent negotiations, if he was offered employment by the Defendant.', '9\\u2003The Plaintiff accepted Boyd\u2019s advice. When the Plaintiff was later informed by Boyd that he had been selected from the five shortlisted candidates for the Defendant\u2019s post of sales director, the Plaintiff commenced negotiations 6', 'through Boyd with the Defendant\u2019s Ms Ambu Arun (\u201cAmbu\u201d) a senior adviser of the Defendant\u2019s talent acquisition team.', '10\\u2003The Plaintiff deposed he shared his concerns with Ambu and Boyd on the stability of employment with the Defendant in view of Dell\u2019s takeover. 7', 'It was at this juncture that the Plaintiff\u2019s version differed from the Defendant\u2019s as to what actually transpired in the negotiations between the parties.', '11\\u2003According to the Plaintiff, in his telephone and (mainly) WhatsApp messages) with Ambu and\/or Boyd, he understood from them that:', '(a)\\u2003the position to be filled played a critical role in the Defendant\u2019s operations. The Defendant\u2019s practice was to retain high performing employees by rotating them internally 8', ';', '(b)\\u2003the Defendant would provide redundancy benefits to the Plaintiff which consisted of three months\u2019 salary if redundancy took place within the first year of employment. Thereafter, redundancy benefits would be an additional month\u2019s salary for every year of employment with the Defendant 9', ';', '(c)\\u2003the Defendant would compensate the Plaintiff for his loss of RSUs in leaving Cisco. 10', '12\\u2003In regard to the Defendant\u2019s compensation for the Plaintiff\u2019s loss in value of RSUs in leaving Cisco\u2019s employment, the Plaintiff\u2019s version also differed from the Defendant\u2019s (which will be set out in the Defence and in the testimony of its witnesses).', '13\\u2003The Plaintiff claimed he wanted to be compensated by the Defendant for RSUs that would have vested in him over three years had he stayed with Cisco. Those RSUs were equivalent to US$109,000 or S$150,000 in value. For the RSUs that formed a component of his annual bonus, the Plaintiff told the Defendant that he wanted that to be built into his base salary as part of the On-Target Earnings (\u201cOTE\u201d) component. 11', 'It was the Plaintiff\u2019s case that the Defendant agreed to his request. 12', 'The Plaintiff deposed that in 2017, Cisco paid him around S$460,000 divided equally between fixed and variable elements. 13', '14\\u2003According to the Plaintiff, he expected the OTE component at the Defendant to be around S$580,000 comprising of the fixed and variable elements as follows 14', ':', '(a)\\u2003S$530,000 being a 15% increase on the Plaintiff\u2019s compensation at Cisco;', '(b)\\u2003S$50,000 being an acceptable compensation for the value of the RSUs that he lost in leaving Cisco.', '15\\u2003On or around 7 November 2017, Ambu conveyed the Defendant\u2019s employment offer to the Plaintiff, comprising of an annual OTE component of S$495,000, an annual car allowance of S$30,000 and a proposed sign-on bonus of S$30,000 meant to compensate the Plaintiff for the loss in value of RSUs that were granted and would vest over three years. The Plaintiff rejected 15', 'the offer as it was below his expectations and he told Ambu his reasons.', '16\\u2003It was the Plaintiff\u2019s case 16', 'that during his conversation with Ambu, she represented to him that she would work on increasing the OTE component in the Defendant\u2019s offer and the Plaintiff would be compensated for his loss in value of the RSUs by an alternative method. This would be done by way of the Defendant\u2019s long term cash award (\u201cLTCA\u201d) scheme \u2013 instead of the Plaintiff\u2019s receiving a lump sum at the commencement of his employment, his payment would be staggered over a period of three years. However, no specifics were provided to him over how the LTCA worked. It should be noted that in communication between the parties namely the Plaintiff, the Defendant\u2019s representatives and Boyd, the words \u201clong term incentives\u201d abbreviated to LTI were used interchangeably to refer to LTCA.', '17\\u2003On 9 November 2017, the Plaintiff discussed with Boyd the lack of developments regarding his employment offer from the Defendant, repeating his expectations of the Defendant\u2019s employment offer. 17', 'He referred to his WhatsApp exchanges with Boyd on that day. Boyd indicated he would be meeting Ambu\u2019s superior Kurt Bridge (\u201cKurt\u201d) and would find out the Plaintiff\u2019s position. 18', '18\\u2003Boyd met Kurt on the same day. Boyd then updated the Plaintiff by WhatsApp on what transpired at the meeting. Boyd informed the Plaintiff that the Defendant was looking to compensate the Plaintiff for his loss in value of the RSUs that had already vested in the Plaintiff but the amount would be two not three years\u2019 worth of RSUs and would be paid over three years. 19', '19\\u2003On 10 November 2017, Ambu requested the Plaintiff to provide supporting details of the value of his RSUs with Cisco. The Plaintiff provided the requested details to Ambu 20', 'as well as an explanation of how the amount worked out to be about US$83,559, excluding the bonus RSUs that the Plaintiff expected to receive that month.', '20\\u2003Through Boyd, the Plaintiff received a revised offer from the Defendant on 14 November 2017 which terms he informed Boyd 21', 'still did not satisfy him because the Plaintiff was offered US$60,000 as compensation for his loss in value of the RSUs which worked out to US$20,000 per year for three years against his estimated loss of US$83,559.', '21\\u2003On 15 November 2017, in a telephone conversation, Ambu briefed the Plaintiff on the progress of the Defendant\u2019s employment offer. 22', 'She also explained to the Plaintiff how the Defendant\u2019s WorkDay online system operated. She told the Plaintiff he needed to create an account on WorkDay through which the Defendant would provide him with a soft copy of his letter of offer.', '22\\u2003The Plaintiff received as part of his annual bonus from Cisco, further RSUs on or about 17 Nov 2017 which he estimated to be worth US$28,800. 23', 'He informed both Boyd and Ambu of that fact. 24', 'Boyd and Ambu apparently discussed the issue on 21 November 2017. 25', 'On 27 November 2017, Ambu telephoned the Plaintiff to inform him that she was working on his employment offer. She also informed him that she was waiting for word from the Defendant\u2019s US team on the amount of compensation for his loss of RSUs. Pending that, she told him she would upload onto the WorkDay system a letter of offer from the Defendant containing the previous offer of US$60,000 as compensation for the loss in value of his RSUs. She added that once the approved amount of compensation was made known to her, she would update the Defendant\u2019s letter of offer. 26', '23\\u2003On 28 November 2017, Boyd informed the Plaintiff that the Defendant had agreed to offer him USD82,300 for the LTI. 27', 'On or around 4 December 2017, the Plaintiff received from the Defendant the employment contract. He resigned from Cisco on the following day. The Plaintiff noted from the employment contract that the Defendant offered him US$82,300 as compensation for loss in value of RSUs at Cisco but termed it as a LTCA. He further noted there was a reference to a \u201cLong Term Cash Incentive and Retention Award Agreement\u201d 28', '(\u201cLTCA Agreement\u201d) on which he sought clarification from Ambu, both by WhatsApp 29', 'and by email 30', '.', '24\\u2003Ambu responded 31', 'stating that there were no terms and conditions attached to the Defendant\u2019s compensation for his loss in value of RSUs at Cisco that was termed a LTCA.

She confirmed his understanding and added that there were no other terms and conditions that the Plaintiff needed to comply with. 32', '26\\u2003On 12 December 2017, the Plaintiff countersigned the Defendant\u2019s letter of offer dated 30 November 2017 which became the Employment Contract. It was a replacement for the first contract the Plaintiff signed on or about 4 December 2017 as that contained the incorrect commencement date of 1 January 2018 instead of 15 January 2018 33', ', and a notice period of one month instead of three months 34', '.', '27\\u2003It was the Plaintiff\u2019s case that as of 12 December 2017, he had no knowledge of the contents of the LTCA agreement and had neither seen nor received a copy of that document. He deposed 35', 'that it was only around 26 March 2018 that he was made to log into the Defendant\u2019s online system \u201cFidelity\u201d to review the compensation for his loss in value of RSUs at Cisco. The Plaintiff alleged that it was because of Ambu\u2019s representation in [24] that there were no other terms and conditions in his Employment Contract, that he assumed the LTCA was a standard company document that the Defendant requested him to sign. 36', '28\\u2003At this juncture, it would be appropriate to set out the relevant clauses in the Employment Contract 37', ':', '', '29\\u2003The Plaintiff received from the Defendant around February 2019 the sum of US$27,433 (being one-third of US$82,300) that being the first tranche of payment of the compensation for the loss in value of his RSUs at Cisco. He did not receive the subsequent two payments. He found out much later (after he left the Defendant\u2019s employment) that what he understood of the LTCA and what he received was radically different. 38', '30\\u2003The Plaintiff commenced his employment with the Defendant on 15 January 2018 but deposed it was not a happy experience. He complained of repeated changes of his reporting lines within short time spans. In his AEIC 39', ', he set out a chronology (between December 2017 and July 2019) of those reporting line changes due to the Defendant\u2019s internal restructuring.', '', '31\\u2003Notwithstanding the reporting line problems, the Plaintiff deposed 40', 'he worked diligently and exceeded the quota targets set by the Defendant. Hence, the Defendant increased his monthly salary from S$21,666.67 to S$22,394.67 in October 2018. 41', 'If he met his quota targets in full (which he did), the Defendant paid the Plaintiff commission which was the same amount as his salary.', '32\\u2003As recognition of the Plaintiff\u2019s high performance, the Defendant invited him to join the President\u2019s Club (\u201cthe Club\u201d) around 4 May 2019 and to attend an exclusive company event in Bali. It was apparently a very prestigious event within the Defendant\u2019s organisation which was reserved for very few elite performing sales members. 42', '33\\u2003On 13 August 2019, without warning and which shock caused him to lose consciousness momentarily, the Plaintiff was told in person and by a letter dated the same day (\u201cthe Termination Letter\u201d) 43', 'from the Defendant\u2019s Human Resource Manager, that his employment with the Defendant would be terminated on 1 September 2019.

The net outcome was that at the end of the exercise, the Plaintiff took the position that the Defendant had failed to pay him his dues including the outstanding sum of US$54,866 for the loss in compensation of his RSUs.', '35\\u2003In the Termination Letter, the Defendant had given as the reason for his termination that the Plaintiff\u2019s \u201crole ha[d] become redundant\u201d. The Plaintiff questioned the validity of that reason as the Defendant hired an Australian the week after the Plaintiff was given his notice 44', 'and part of the Plaintiff\u2019s role was filled by the Australian. Subsequently, the Defendant hired other staff who to some extent filled the Plaintiff\u2019s role.', '36\\u2003The Plaintiff received a letter dated 9 September 2019 45', '(\u201cthe 9 September letter\u201d) from the Defendant informing him that his last day of employment would be 30 September 2019.

The Plaintiff averred he was neither furnished with the LTCA Agreement nor apprised of its terms prior to the execution of the Employment Contract.

In cross-examination he disagreed that because the Employment Contract did not contain a redundancy clause, it meant the Plaintiff was not entitled to redundancy benefits, pointing out 97', 'that the Defendant may well have a redundancy policy outside an employee\u2019s contract of employment that is applicable to all its employees.', '72\\u2003Nothing turns on the testimony of the Defendant\u2019s other two witnesses Cecilia and Verena as neither were involved in the negotiations between the Plaintiff and the Defendant and both joined the Defendant\u2019s services well after the Plaintiff.

If the HR department was so minded, she stated that the departing employee would be given goodwill payments of an additional month\u2019s salary for every year of completed service that he served. Since she was aware of this goodwill practice, she would not have promised the Plaintiff he was entitled to goodwill payments.', '78\\u2003The Plaintiff had relied on Boyd\u2019s WhatsApp message to him dated 27 November 2017 108', 'which stated:', 'Ambu noted that Boyd\u2019s message in any event referred to \u201cretrenchment clause\u201d and not \u201credundancy benefit\u201d or a \u201credundancy agreement\u201d. 109', '79\\u2003Ambu then referred to Boyd\u2019s earlier WhatsApp message to her on 24 November 2017 110', 'which said:', 'She opined that it was clear therefrom that parties were negotiating a written term that could potentially be part of the Plaintiff\u2019s terms of employment.

In their respective submissions, the parties gave their own interpretation of the WhatsApp exchanges between the Plaintiff, Boyd and\/or Ambu. As the court will address the relevant communication between the parties in the course of its findings, it would not be necessary to review the parties\u2019 submissions in this regard.', '84\\u2003The Plaintiff\u2019s submissions were highly critical of the Defendant\u2019s choice of witnesses and the evidence they presented. He asserted 114', 'that Verena and Cecilia were \u201cwholly irrelevant witnesses\u201d as they were never involved in his negotiations with the Defendant and joined the company after him. On the other hand, he criticised 115', 'the Defendant for not calling Kurt and Peter Hanna to testify even though they were involved in the Plaintiff\u2019s pre-contractual negotiations with the Defendant.', '85\\u2003The court notes that Ambu confirmed 116', 'during cross-examination that Kurt has left the Defendant but she was uncertain about Peter Hanna. Neither Verena nor Cecilia were cross-examined on either gentleman. As they are still the Defendant\u2019s employees, it would have been more appropriate for the Plaintiff to inquire of Verena and Cecilia as to the present whereabouts and availability as witnesses of either gentleman than to ask Ambu, an ex-employee of the Defendant. The court does not think it is right therefore for the Plaintiff to make any adverse comment(s) on the absence of Kurt and Peter Hanna as the Defendant\u2019s witnesses when no evidence was adduced in that regard.', '86\\u2003The Plaintiff also criticised the fact that Boyd was called as his witness and not the Defendant\u2019s. He added 117', 'that Boyd delivered a truthful account of events, amplifying his strong sense of justice and at the expense of him being engaged by the Defendant in the future for similar assignments. The court notes that no evidence was adduced at the trial to support the submission that Boyd testified at the expense of future work from the Defendant. Moreover, it is trite law that no litigant has a proprietary right to any witness. The Defendant was not obliged to call Boyd to testify. Indeed, the fact that Boyd was the Plaintiff\u2019s witness gave the Defendant the advantage of cross-examining him.', '87\\u2003Ambu was not spared from the Plaintiff\u2019s criticisms either. She was said to be an unwilling witness as the Defendant had to subpoena her 118', '. Then in the next breath 119', ', Ambu was criticised for doing a 180 degrees turn in affirming an AEIC for the Defendant. The Plaintiff\u2019s ambivalence brings to mind the idiom \u201cDamned if you do and damned if you don\u2019t\u201d. The Plaintiff then went on to say that he could only \u201chazard guesses as to why Ms. Ambu had a change of mind to depose to an AEIC and testify at trial for the Defendant.\u201d 120', 'For added measures, the Plaintiff criticised 121', 'Ambu for being an unreliable witness with a highly selective and biased memory \u2013 she was accused of fitting into the Defendant\u2019s strategy to stonewall the Plaintiff.', '88\\u2003In his submissions 122', ', the Plaintiff submitted that there are differences between stock options and RSUs. Instead of relying on a textbook authority raised only at the submissions stage by the Plaintiff (Steven M Bragg, The New CFO Financial Leadership Manual (Wiley, 3rd Ed, 2011), the court would have found it more helpful if the Plaintiff and\/or Ambu had been questioned on the differences the Plaintiff has now raised after trial.', '89\\u2003The Plaintiff submitted 123', 'that a collateral contract came into being based on Ambu\u2019s promise of redundancy benefits to the Plaintiff which enticed him to join the Defendant and for which he provided separate consideration by entering into the Employment Contract. In support of this submission, the Plaintiff cited Goldzone (Asia Pacific) Ltd (formerly known as Goldzone (Singapore) Ltd) v Creative Technology Centre Pte Ltd [2011] SGHC 103 (\u201cGoldzone\u201d) 124', 'and the following criteria set out by Andrew Ang J (as he then was) at [45] for the formation of an oral collateral contract:', '(a)\\u2003The statement must be promissory in nature or effect rather than representational (Lemon Grass v Peranakan Place Complex Pte Ltd [2002] 2 SLR(R) 50 at [116]\u2013[117]);', '(b)\\u2003There must be certainty of terms;', '(c)\\u2003There must be separate consideration; and', '(d)\\u2003 Existence of animus contrahendi, ie, a statement must be intended to be legally binding (Inntrepreneur Pub Co (GL) v East Crown Ltd [2000] 2 Lloyd\u2019s Rep 611 at [614]).', '90\\u2003The Plaintiff also submitted 125', 'that a term of trust and confidence was to be implied into the Employment Contract.', '91\\u2003However, nothing was said in the Plaintiff\u2019s submissions regarding the Entire Agreement clause set out earlier in [28(e)].', '92\\u2003The Defendant\u2019s Closing Submissions (\u201cDCS\u201d) did not criticise the witnesses in the manner the Plaintiff did.

It should be noted however that during her cross-examination 128', ', counsel for the Plaintiff put it to Ambu (who disagreed) that as an experienced recruiter, Boyd could not possibly have mistaken the notice provision in the Employment Contract to be the Plaintiff\u2019s entitlement for redundancy. To Ambu, redundancy was part of termination 129', '. However she did eventually concede that the termination clause in the Employment Contract did not address the Plaintiff\u2019s rights in redundancy 130', '.', '93\\u2003The Defendant also submitted 131', 'that even if one accepts the Plaintiff\u2019s testimony that the alleged Redundancy Agreement was confirmed in his telephone conversation with Ambu on or about 27 November 2017, such evidence would be inadmissible under s 94(b) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe Evidence Act\u201d) which states:', 'It was submitted 132', 'that s 94(b) of the Evidence Act precludes the Plaintiff from asserting any separate oral Redundancy Agreement which terms are inconsistent with the terms of the Employment Contract.

The Defendant argued that the facts in this case do not remotely support the Plaintiff\u2019s allegation of fraud 134', '.', '96\\u2003The Defendant further submitted 135', 'that the Plaintiff\u2019s claim based on an implied term of trust and confidence is a red herring \u2013 if a legally relevant promise of redundancy benefits had made to him, that would be enforceable independent of any implied term of trust and confidence. In any case, a duty to pay redundancy benefits is not an element of the implied duty of trust and confidence because such a duty is concomitant with the continuation of the employment contract and has no relevance when an employment relationship is not to continue. The Defendant added that the implied term is intended to address conduct and behaviour during the course of employment (citing Cheah Peng Hock v Luzhou Bio-Chem Technology Ltd [2013] 2 SLR 577 (\u201cCheah Peng Hock\u201d) at [56]).', '97\\u2003It is telling that the Plaintiff had sent to Ambu on 12 July 2017 136', 'the message below:', 'The message contradicted the Plaintiff\u2019s claim that he was unaware of the existence of the LTCA Agreement before he joined the Defendant.', '98\\u2003The court finds it incredible that the Plaintiff can claim 137', ', despite signing the Employment Contract which contained the LTCA clause set out earlier at [28(c)], that he was unaware of the need for him to sign another agreement.

Boyd did not have a WhatsApp chatgroup with the Plaintiff which included Ambu. Hence, Ambu did not know what message Boyd conveyed to the Plaintiff on 27 November 2017. In any case, it was clear from Boyd\u2019s and Ambu\u2019s evidence at [70] and [79] that the former had no authority to propose terms on the Defendant\u2019s behalf to the Plaintiff.', '106\\u2003It is the court\u2019s finding that Ambu would not have made the representations the Plaintiff alleged at [46]. The five elements to found fraudulent misrepresentation as set out in [94] are absent in this case. The court has already noted above that there were no WhatsApp messages from Ambu to the Plaintiff that evidenced such representations. For the Plaintiff to submit that Ambu\/the Defendant would be bound by whatever representations Boyd made to the Plaintiff is to ignore the evidence of his own witness that Boyd had no authority to make representations on the Defendant\u2019s behalf and to ignore the Entire Agreement clause set out earlier at [28(e)]. Broadley does not assist the Plaintiff\u2019s case.', '107\\u2003As for the Plaintiff\u2019s claim based on a collateral contract (see [89] above), it is the court\u2019s view that the claim fails in limine. One of the requirements of a collateral contract as with any contract is consideration. The Plaintiff\u2019s submission that the Plaintiff provided consideration by entering into the Employment Contract is flawed. The consideration for the Employment Contract was the Plaintiff\u2019s services in exchange for salary and other benefits from the Defendant. For a collateral contract to come into existence, the Plaintiff had to provide fresh consideration (see [89] above); he did not.', '108\\u2003Earlier at [90], the court had alluded to the Plaintiff\u2019s submission that 144', 'an implied term of mutual trust and confidence in law applied to his claim for redundancy benefits, citing Malik v Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA (in compulsory liquidation) [1998] AC 20 (\u201cMalik\u2019s case\u201d). The Defendant also referred to Malik\u2019s case albeit indirectly. The Defendant had referred to Cheah Peng Hock where Quentin Loh J (as he then was), at [56]\u2013[59], cited Malik\u2019s case and in particular the following extract from Lord Nicholls\u2019 judgment where he said (at 34\u201335):', '109\\u2003The Plaintiff\u2019s claim is misconceived as it related to a post-termination benefit by which time the implied term of mutual trust and confidence no longer existed. Malik\u2019s case makes it clear that such a duty is part and parcel of an existing contract of employment. The court accepts the Defendant\u2019s submission 145', 'that a duty to pay redundancy benefits (if it existed) is in any case not an element of the implied duty of trust and confidence \u2013 the Plaintiff quite rightly did not make such an assertion. Such a claim would also be inconsistent with the Entire Agreement clause spelt out earlier at [28(e)] above.', '110\\u2003The Defendant\u2019s submission 146', 'had referred to the following extract from Boyd\u2019s cross-examination 147', ':', 'to submit that since ultimately no redundancy clause was included in the Employment Contract in any event, the Plaintiff\u2019s claim must fail. The court agrees.', '111\\u2003Ambu\u2019s view on the other hand 148', 'was that Boyd could have mistaken the possibility of goodwill payment of one month\u2019s salary for every year of service (which it was the Defendant\u2019s practice to pay and which she did disclose to him) with the three months\u2019 notice provision in the Employment Contract.', '112\\u2003Even if Boyd was not confused as he and the Plaintiff both asserted, the court accepts the Defendant\u2019s submission 149', 'that the Entire Agreement clause (read with the Confirmation of Acceptance clause: see [28(f)] above) and s 94 of the Evidence Act (see [93] above) precludes the court\u2019s recognition of the Redundancy Agreement. Apart from his bald assertion, the Plaintiff did not produce an iota of evidence to support the alleged oral agreement. He had alleged that Ambu represented to him that he would receive redundancy benefits (see [46] above) but this was denied by Ambu who said during cross-examination 150', 'that it was outside her jurisdiction\/authority to make such an offer. Consequently, the court finds that the Redundancy Agreement did not exist.', '113\\u2003Assuming arguendo that there was indeed a Redundancy Agreement, the court turns to the sums the Plaintiff was paid as at 30 September 2019 (see [36] above). For the early termination of the Employment Contract, the Plaintiff received severance pay amounting to S$38,294.88 (see [36] above). Based on his monthly salary of S$22,394.67 (as at September 2019), his severance pay equated to 1.71 times his last drawn monthly salary (S$38,294.88 \u00f7 S$22,394.67). The Oxford English Dictionary Online (Oxford University Press, 2021) (\u201cOED Online\u201d) defines \u201cseverance pay\u201d as \u201cmoney paid in compensation to one whose contractual employment is terminated\u201d.', '114\\u2003 In the court\u2019s view, there is very little difference between redundancy and severance payment. The OED Online defines \u201credundant\u201d (of an employee) as \u201c[a] person who is no longer needed in a particular job or place of employment \u2026 [and] who leaves or loses his or her job for this reason\u201d. \u201cRedundancy\u201d is \u201c[t]he condition of being surplus to an organization\u2019s staffing requirements; (hence) the state or fact of losing a job for this reason\u201d. The Defendant had referred to the severance payment as a \u201cgratuitous\u201d sum (see [57] and [58] above). The court disagrees. The amount of S$38,294.88 was stated to be severance pay both in the 9 September letter (see [36] above) and in the Defendant\u2019s email dated 30 September 2019 at [41] to the Plaintiff and that was exactly what it was.', '115\\u2003The Plaintiff worked for 20.5 months for the Defendant and received severance pay of S$38,294.88 equivalent to 1.71 times his last drawn salary. He should have received only 1.71 times his salary (20.5 \u00f7 12 months = 1.71). He had therefore received precisely the amount of redundancy benefits that he was entitled to if indeed there was a Redundancy Agreement. He cannot therefore complain.', '116\\u2003The Plaintiff\u2019s claim in his SOC (see [50(d)] above) was for US$54,866 being the balance of his unvested LTCA on the basis that Ambu had falsely represented to him that the agreed LTCA of US$82,300 was an outright entitlement to compensate him for the loss in value of his unvested Cisco RSUs. He claimed 151', 'this was to be inferred from:', '(a)\\u2003An email chain of 10 November 2017 between himself and Ambu 152', ';', '(b)\\u2003A series of text and telephone exchanges between himself and Ambu on or about 17 November 2017; and', '(c)\\u2003A series of text, telephone and email exchanges between himself, Ambu and Boyd from around 7 November to 4 December 2017 153', '.', '117\\u2003If the Plaintiff (as he asserted) understood from Ambu he was entitled to the RSUs by way of the LTCA without conditions, he would not have requested the Defendant to make an exception in his case, as seen in the email from Nikhil Dhawan (\u201cNikhil\u201d) to Verena 154', 'dated 29 August 2019 which was also addressed to him. The relevant extract reads:', 'Cross-examined on a later email dated 5 September 2019 in which the Plaintiff repeated his request for an \u201cexception approval request to pay out the outstanding LTI\u201d 155', ', the Plaintiff claimed he used the word \u201cexception\u201d because Nikhil 156', 'told him that was what it was \u2013 Nikhil needed to get an exception approval. I should point out that the Plaintiff went to the extent of saying 157', 'that even if he resigned one week after signing the Employment Contract let alone during the three years thereafter, he was still entitled to his RSUs payout. That is an absurd contention which the court dismisses outright.', '118\\u2003In her re-examination, Ambu\u2019s attention was drawn 158', 'to the WhatsApp messages on 7 November 2017 159', 'between the Plaintiff and Boyd where there was reference to her having to seek \u201capprovals\u201d on the issue of the Plaintiff being compensated for his Cisco RSUs. Surely that should\/would have been a clear indication to the Plaintiff that Ambu did not have the final say and she could not bind the Defendant to whatever terms she offered to him without clearance from her superiors.', '119\\u2003Ambu had informed Boyd on 28 November 2017 via WhatsApp 160', 'that the Plaintiff\u2019s LTCA would be increased to US$82,300 but that it needed to be approved by the Defendant\u2019s US team. The need for such approval was reinforced by the following WhatsApp exchange between Ambu (A) and Boyd (B) on 28 and 29 November 2017 161', ':', '120\\u2003The Plaintiff knew by his inquiry of Ambu via email on 5 December 2017 162', 'that the LTCA was a separate document. As the Defendant submitted 163', ', there was no evidence that the alleged representations regarding the LTCA were made to the Plaintiff. In fact, during cross-examination 164', ', the Plaintiff himself agreed Ambu never told him he was entitled to payment of the US$82,300 over three years unconditionally. The relevant extracts of that evidence that the Defendant relied on are set out below:', '121\\u2003Nothing could be clearer than the Plaintiff\u2019s above answers \u2013 he understood that the payouts under the LTCA over three years were not unconditional but were dependant on his continued employment by the Defendant for three years. This is reinforced by the Payment Schedule Clause in the LTCA set out earlier at [66].', '122\\u2003If there were still doubts on this issue, they were resolved by Boyd\u2019s evidence in cross-examination 165', 'when he was questioned on the following WhatsApp messages 166', 'he sent to the Plaintiff on 9 November 2017 after he had met Kurt:', 'The portion of Boyd\u2019s cross-examination 167', 'on the above WhatsApp messages reads as follows:', '123\\u2003In regard to the issue of the Cisco RSUs that had not vested in the Plaintiff after he left the company, the court accepts the Defendant\u2019s submission 168', 'that there can be no \u201closs\u201d to the Plaintiff as those RSUs were not earned by\/vested in him when he left Cisco\u2019s services. The Plaintiff unreasonably claimed his RSUs in full (including those that had yet to accrue) and at the same time disavowed the terms and conditions in the LTCA attendant to the payouts. The law does not allow the Plaintiff to approbate and reprobate at his own convenience as he tried to do.', '124\\u2003Ambu\u2019s evidence and her WhatsApp exchanges which were reinforced by Boyd\u2019s testimony, showed that no representations on the LTCA were made to the Plaintiff as he alleged in the SOC. Consequently, the Plaintiff\u2019s claim for the balance LTCA amounting to US$54,866 fails.', '125\\u2003In regard to the car allowance, the Plaintiff had accepted 169', 'in cross-examination that he was not entitled to the car allowance he had claimed. In this regard, the Defendant\u2019s car allowance policy 170', 'states the following definition in item 3:', 'As the Plaintiff did not travel to visit any customers after 30 September 2019, he was not entitled to any car allowance after that date. As the Defendant submitted 171', ', the car allowance (as well as sales commission) and the salary are separate\/different components in the Plaintiff\u2019s remuneration and it was so reflected in his payslips 172', '.', '126\\u2003Additionally, the definition of \u201cgross salary\u201d (ie, \u201cgross rate of pay\u201d) under s 2(e) of the Employment Act excludes \u201ctravelling, food or housing allowances\u201d.', '127\\u2003Similarly, the Plaintiff was not entitled to any sales commission after 30 September 2019. The court is puzzled by the Plaintiff\u2019s explanation \u2013 he claimed his employment was forcibly terminated on 30 September 2019 even though he wanted to continue working throughout his notice period. Therefore he insisted, he was entitled to claim for sales commission and pro-rated leave until 30 November 2019 even though he was paid his salary for doing no work for two months (October\u2013November 2019). It should be noted that under the Employment Termination clause set out earlier at [28(d)], it is the Defendant that has the sole discretion to decide whether the Plaintiff can serve out his notice period of three months or be paid his salary in lieu thereof.', '128\\u2003Indeed, as the Defendant pointed out 173', ', the Defendant\u2019s contractual right of termination is also to be found in s 11 of the Employment Act which states:', '129\\u2003In paying the Plaintiff three months\u2019 salary in lieu of notice, the Defendant fully complied with the Employment Termination clause as well as s 11 of the Employment Act. Consequently, the Plaintiff\u2019s SOC (see [50(b)] above) alleging he was entitled to damages for breach of s 11 of the Employment Act is without merit.', '130\\u2003The court therefore rejects as illogical the basis for the Plaintiff\u2019s claim set out at [127]. Common sense dictates that if the Plaintiff did not work and did not make sales, he is not entitled to any sales commission.', '131\\u2003In the light of the court\u2019s findings on his car allowance claim at [125] and his sales commission claim at [130], it follows that the Plaintiff\u2019s claim for 7.5 days for unutilised leave is also unmeritorious and is also dismissed.', '132\\u2003Unlike Boyd, the court did not find the Plaintiff to be a convincing witness. Notwithstanding the Plaintiff\u2019s criticisms, the court found Ambu to be truthful. Granted she could not recall many events in detail but her failing in that regard, due to having left the Defendant\u2019s services more than three years did not make her any less a credible witness.'"}

Furthermore, as investigations were still ongoing, the Prosecution considered that the disclosure of the applicant\u2019s identity would risk the identification of other victims in respect of whom charges might be tendered in the future. District Judge Adam Nakhoda (\u201cDistrict Judge Nakhoda\u201d) accordingly granted a gag order prohibiting the publication of the victims\u2019 identities as well as the applicant\u2019s identity and university.', '8\\u2003On 8 January 2020, the Prosecution preferred 18 additional charges against the applicant.

{"casename":"2021_SGHC_291","fact":"the facts \nVersion No 1: 27 Dec 2021 (10:46 hrs)\nHaribo Asia Pacific Pte Ltd v Aquarius Corp[2021] SGHC 291 \n5of this case, to terminate the contractual interest at an earlier \ndate for the following reasons. First, the contractual interest \nrate of 15.12% is rather high, and in the context of the present-\nday interest rate environment, it behoves this court to be \ncautious in making any such award. Second, I have found that \nthe Defendant is entitled to a counterclaim that is of a similar \norder of magnitude to the Plaintiff\u2019s claim. After setting off the \ncounterclaim, the sum for which the Defendant is indebted to \nthe Plaintiff would be greatly diminished. In these \ncircumstances, I am minded to exercise the discretion vested in \nme under s 12(1) of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed) to \norder the Defendant to pay the contractual interest rate on the \nPlaintiff\u2019s claims up to 30 August 2018, the date of filing of the \nDefence and Counterclaim, with interest thereafter to run at \n5.33%. I also order interest at 5.33% on the sum ordered under \nthe Counterclaim to run from the same date, 30 August 2018.\n11  In light of the error and the correction of the rate of interest down to \n7.12%, the Plaintiff submits that there is basis for me to reconsider not \nterminating the applicable contractual interest on 30 August 2018. Having \nconsidered the submission, I agree that difference between the Plaintiff\u2019s \ncontractual rate of 7.12% and the court-ordered rate of 5.33% is not as to engage \nthe same considerations set out above. Indeed, apart from being almost three \ntimes the usual rate of 5.33%, 15.12% was, in my view, in and of itself bordering \non usurious. The same cannot be said of 7.12% and the reason for not awarding \nthe contractual rate no longer applies. I therefore change this aspect of my \norders.\nConsequential changes to the Judgment\n12 Using the correct interest rate of 7.12%, and with the change stated in \nthe paragraph above in mind, I set out the amendments to the following \nparagraphs of the Judgment:\n9 The parties tendered their written closing and reply \nsubmissions on 13 August and 3 September 2021 respectively. \nNo further oral replies were heard. Having considered these \nsubmissions and the evidence put before me, I allow the \nPlaintiff\u2019s claim for the principal sum of \u20ac1,526,224.76 and its \nVersion No 1: 27 Dec 2021 (10:46 hrs)\nHaribo Asia Pacific Pte Ltd v Aquarius Corp[2021] SGHC 291 \n6claim for contractual interest in full. I allow the counterclaim \nin part, and order that the Plaintiff pay the Defendant \n\u20a91,969,018,000 with judgment interest of 5.33% from the date \nof the Defence and Counterclaim, 30 August 2018. I also find \nthat the requirements for set off have been satisfied, and I will \nexplain how the set off is to be applied from [236] to [240] below.\n\u2026\n12 The Plaintiff pleads that the \u201cbase interest rate\u201d \nprescribed by section 247 of the B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch (the \n\u201cBGB\u201d) \u2013 the German Civil Code \u2013 is -0.88% and that it is \nentitled from 1 July 2016 until the date of full payment. \nApplying this rate and starting date, as at 13 August 2021 \u2013 the \ndate on which closing submissions were filed \u2013 the Plaintiff \ncalculates that it is entitled to \u20ac519,074.76 in interest.\n13 The Defendant does not dispute that the Plaintiff is \nentitled to 8% over the rate of -0.88% (ie, 7.12%). It contends, \nhowever, that the Plaintiff has no basis to claim interest from 1 \nJuly 2016. In support of this, the Defendant highlights that \ninterest is only payable \u201cfrom the expiration of the time provided \nfor payment\u201d (see [11] above). The earliest invoice on which the \nPlaintiff\u2019s claim is based is dated 1 November 2016, and the \ninvoice states that payment is to be made by the \u201c3rd working \nday of [the] next month\u201d. That is, 5 December 2016 \u2013 the 3rd \nand 4th of December being non-working days.\n\u2026\n228 As such, I find that the Plaintiff is entitled to 7.12% \ninterest on each of their invoices, starting from the day after the \namount fell due on that particular invoice. The following table \nsets this out: \u2026\n\u2026\n236 [This paragraph is deleted]\n237 For the foregoing reasons, I allow the Plaintiff\u2019s claim for \nthe principal sum of \u20ac1,526,224.76 and its claim for \ncontractual interest of 7.12% for the following sums from the \nfollowing dates: (a) \u20ac1,390,464.86 with interest payable from 4 \nFebruary 2017 until the date of this judgment, 2 December \n2021; and (b) \u20ac135,759.90 with interest payable from 4 March \n2017, also until the date of this judgment. In respect of (a), \nthere are 1762 days between 4 February 2017 and 2 December \n2021 (this takes into account the Leap Day in 2020), both \ndates inclusive. As such, interest amounts to \u20ac477,917.63. For \n(b), there are 1734 days and interest payable amounts to \n\u20ac45,920.62. Thus, in total, as of the date of this judgment, \nVersion No 1: 27 Dec 2021 (10:46 hrs)\nHaribo Asia Pacific Pte Ltd v Aquarius Corp[2021] SGHC 291 \n7the Plaintiff is awarded the sum of \u20ac2,050,063.01. I will \ndenote this sum (P 1).\n238 [This paragraph is deleted]\n\u2026\n240 With sums (P 1) and (D) in mind, I turn then to the issue \nof set off involving a complication concerning currency \nexchange rates. The starting point is that I order that the parties \ndetermine the applicable exchange rate and set off their \nrespective judgment debts on the date of this judgment. That is, \n(D) should be converted to Euro based on the exchange rate on \n2 December 2021 and deducted from (P 1). As such, as of this \ndate, the Defendant would only owe the Plaintiff (P 1 \u2013 D), a sum \nin Euro, which I will denote (P 2). Thereafter, the Plaintiff would \nbe entitled to 7.12% interest only on (P 2) \u2013 as opposed to (P 1) \u2013 \nfrom the day after this judgment, 3 December 2021, to the date \nof full payment.\n\u2026\n255 It is for these reasons that I held (at [240]) that the \nparties set off their claims on the date of this judgment, and \nconsequently, that the Plaintiff is entitled to receive 7.12% \ninterest only on (P 2) from the day after this judgment.\n[Amendments emphasised]\n13 For the avoidance of doubt, my amended orders as set out above shall \ntake effect from 2 December 2021, the date of the Judgment. As I explained at \n[240]\u2013[253] of the Judgment, there are issues of set off and currency conversion \narising in this matter, and there is a principled basis on which I decided to order \nthe necessary conversion and set off to be effected on that date. This subsequent \ncorrection of the precise sums which form the subject of my orders does not \njustify a departure from the basis on which I made that decision. \n14 With these clarifications, the parties may proceed to effect the set off of \ntheir respective judgment debts using the relevant exchange rate on \n2 December 2021, and the Plaintiff may then proceed to enforce payment of the \nbalance owing thereafter.\nVersion No 1: 27 Dec 2021 (10:46 hrs)\nHaribo Asia Pacific Pte Ltd v Aquarius Corp[2021] SGHC 291 \n8Lee Seiu Kin\nJudge of the High Court\nChou Sean Yu, Oh Sheng Loong Frank, Daniel Lee Wai Yong, and Eve \nDana Ng Shi Ying (WongPartnership LLP) for the Plaintiff;\nGregory Vijayendran SC, Kevin Tan, Devathas Satianathan, Low Weng \nHong, and Ng Shu Wen (Rajah & Tann Singapore LLP) for the \nDefendant.\nVersion No 1: 27 Dec 2021 (10:46 hrs)"}

The facts of the case are set out in Public Prosecutor v Syed Suhail bin Syed Zin [2016] SGHC 8 (\u201cSyed Suhail (HC)\u201d). On 18 October 2018, the applicant\u2019s appeal in CA\/CCA 38\/2015 against his conviction and sentence was dismissed by the Court of Appeal.', '4\\u2003On 5 July 2019, the applicant was notified that his petition for clemency had been rejected. On 20 January 2020, the President of the Republic of Singapore (the \u201cPresident\u201d), acting pursuant to s 313(f) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (\u201cCPC\u201d), ordered the sentence of death imposed on the applicant to be carried out on 7 February 2020. On 5 February 2020, the President ordered a respite of the execution pending any further order. This order was made pending the outcome of a separate application for judicial review in relation to an alleged unlawful method of execution. This application was dismissed in Gobi a\/l Avedian and another v Attorney-General and another appeal [2020] 2 SLR 883 (\u201cGobi (JR)\u201d) on 13 August 2020 and the scheduling of execution of sentences of death resumed thereafter. Following the resolution of Gobi (JR), on 8 September 2020, the President issued a new order for the applicant to be executed on 18 September 2020.', '5\\u2003Shortly before his scheduled date of execution, the applicant (through his counsel Mr Ravi s\/o Madasamy (\u201cMr Ravi\u201d)) made two applications. First, on 16 September 2020, he commenced OS 891\/2020 seeking leave to apply for a prohibiting order for the stay of his execution pending the outcome of the application (the \u201cJudicial Review Leave Application\u201d). Second, on 17 September 2020, he commenced CA\/CM 28\/2020, seeking leave under s 394H of the CPC to review his conviction as well as to reopen his case for resentencing (the \u201cCriminal Review Application\u201d). I will briefly set out the proceedings of these applications.', '6\\u2003The Judicial Review Leave Application was accompanied by a statement made pursuant to O 53 r 1(2) of the ROC and an affidavit filed on the applicant\u2019s behalf by Mr Ravi (\u201cMr Ravi\u2019s 1st affidavit\u201d). Leave was sought on two grounds:', '(a)\\u2003First, the President\u2019s power to grant clemency under Art 22P(1) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1985 Rev Ed, 1999 Reprint) (\u201cConstitution\u201d) had fallen into disuse and had been extinguished. Further, due to a blanket policy to deny clemency petitions for all drug-related matters, the applicant\u2019s petition had not been individually considered. Therefore, the applicant\u2019s right under Art 9 of the Constitution had been violated.', '(b)\\u2003Second, the scheduling of executions should follow the sequence in which offenders had been sentenced to death. The failure to follow this sequence deprived the applicant of time to adduce new evidence to seek to have his conviction reopened. Further, the applicant had been discriminated against on the ground of his nationality as a Singaporean, as the execution of non-Singaporeans had been halted until the re-opening of Singapore\u2019s borders due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, the applicant\u2019s rights to equal protection under both Art 12(1) and (2) of the Constitution had been violated (the \u201cscheduling ground\u201d).', '7\\u2003I dismissed the Judicial Review Leave Application on 17 September 2020 and granted a stay of execution pending the applicant\u2019s appeal against my decision.', '8\\u2003The applicant\u2019s appeal against my refusal to grant leave was heard by the Court of Appeal in CA 155\/2020 (the \u201cJudicial Review Leave Appeal\u201d) on 22 September and 23 October 2020. After the hearing on 22 September, the court posed several questions for the parties to address before it would come to a decision on whether to grant leave to commence judicial review proceedings. One such question was whether a prisoner awaiting capital punishment had a legitimate legal expectation that the date on which his sentence is to be carried out will not result in his being treated differently as compared to other prisoners who are not similarly situated. Both parties filed further submissions in respect of the questions posed by the court. The respondent also filed an affidavit affirmed by Mr Lim Zhi Yang (\u201cMr Lim\u201d), a Senior Director in the Policy Development Division of the Ministry of Home Affairs (\u201cMHA\u201d), on 29 September 2020 (\u201cMr Lim\u2019s 1st affidavit\u201d) in support of their submissions.', '9\\u2003On 23 October 2020, after hearing the parties\u2019 submissions, the Court of Appeal granted the applicant leave to commence judicial review proceedings solely on the scheduling ground. The court\u2019s full grounds of decision were issued on 23 December 2020 in Syed Suhail bin Syed Zin v Attorney-General [2020] SGCA 122 (\u201cSyed Suhail (Judicial Review Leave Appeal)\u201d). For present purposes, two salient points from that decision need to be set out here. The first pertains to the legal principles applicable when assessing a potential breach of Art 12(1), and the second to a comparator raised by the applicant who had been sentenced to death before him, but whose execution had not yet been scheduled at the time he was slated to be executed (ie, 18 September 2020).', '10\\u2003First, in relation to whether there was a breach of Art 12(1), the court stated that the right to equal protection is \u201cbased on impermissible differential treatment\u201d (Syed Suhail (Judicial Review Leave Appeal) at [49]). In determining whether differential treatment is impermissible, the court held that the test to be applied is \u201cnot as high as deliberate and arbitrary discrimination\u201d (at [60]\u2013[61]), thus clarifying passages in Eng Foong Ho and others v Attorney-General [2009] 2 SLR(R) 542 (\u201cEng Foong Ho\u201d) at [30] and Muhammad Ridzuan bin Mohd Ali v Attorney-General [2015] 5 SLR 1222 (\u201cRidzuan\u201d) at [49]. Instead, the applicant would need to show that he \u201ccould be considered to be equally situated\u201d as the person with whom comparisons are made such that differential treatment would require justification. If the applicant can discharge this evidential burden, the respondent would then be called upon to justify the differential treatment (at [61]):', '11\\u2003The court further stated at [62] that:', '12\\u2003The court went on to explain that in respect of the first limb, prisoners may prima facie be regarded as equally situated once their clemency petitions had been rejected and before their executions had been scheduled (Syed Suhail (Judicial Review Leave Appeal) at [64] and [66]). The court held that \u201cprisoners have a legitimate legal expectation under Art 12(1) that they be treated equally in the scheduling of their executions, and any departure from equal treatment ought to be justified by legitimate reasons\u201d. As for what would constitute \u2018equal treatment\u2019, the court accepted the position advanced by the MHA in Mr Lim\u2019s 1st affidavit, that being, \u201call else being equal, prisoners whose executions arise for scheduling should be executed in the order in which they were sentenced to death\u201d. In respect of the second limb, the court made no conclusive determination as to what legitimate reasons would justify differential treatment. It did however, recognise that some flexibility would be necessary in the scheduling of executions, but that such flexibility must be lawfully exercised (at [72]).', '13\\u2003In addition, the court rejected the applicant\u2019s attempt to establish a right under Art 12(1) on the basis that new evidence might emerge thus enabling him to file a further challenge to reopen his conviction. The court made clear that the applicant\u2019s legal expectation under Art 12(1) in relation to the scheduling of his execution \u201cderived from a much more concrete interest\u2026 of not having his death sentence carried out on a date which was decided without due regard to his constitutional rights\u201d (at [68]).', '14\\u2003Second, I now turn to a comparator raised by Mr Ravi only before the Court of Appeal. It was stated in Mr Lim\u2019s 1st affidavit at [11] that the applicant was the first offender whose execution was scheduled to be carried out following the resolution of Gobi (JR). This scheduling was also stated to have been done in accordance with certain prerequisites and supervening policy considerations, including \u201cthe dates on which the sentences of death were pronounced on offenders\u201d (Mr Lim\u2019s 1st affidavit at [6]\u2013[9]). However, the court highlighted an unexplained inconsistency between Mr Lim\u2019s 1st affidavit and the known facts. In Mr Lim\u2019s 1st affidavit, he averred at [12] that:', 'Contrary to this, and in support of the scheduling ground, Mr Ravi orally submitted that one Datchinamurthy a\/l Kataiah (\u201cDatchinamurthy\u201d) had been sentenced to death before the applicant, but his date of execution had yet to be fixed at the time of the applicant\u2019s then-scheduled date of execution of 18 September 2020. Mr Ravi did not raise this fact in the Judicial Review Leave Application before me and had only done so at the hearing on 22 September 2020 before the Court of Appeal (Syed Suhail (Judicial Review Leave Appeal) at [16]). Datchinamurthy\u2019s death sentence had been upheld on appeal and his clemency petition had also been rejected. As Datchinamurthy was one of the prisoners who brought the application which was rejected in Gobi (JR), the scheduling of executions of the applicant and Datchinamurthy would have arisen at the same time following the resolution of Gobi (JR).', '15\\u2003As such, it appeared that Datchinamurthy and the applicant were equally situated, and Datchinamurthy should have been scheduled for execution earlier than the applicant. There was thus an apparent inconsistency on the face of the record between the MHA\u2019s assertion that the applicant was the \u201cfirst to be sentenced to death\u201d amongst all equally situated prisoners and the fact that Datchinamurthy\u2019s execution had not been scheduled. As no other differentiating factors were put forth by the respondent to justify the differential treatment of the applicant and Datchinamurthy (Syed Suhail (Judicial Review Leave Appeal) at [75] and [76]), the court held that the applicant had met the low bar of showing a prima facie case of reasonable suspicion that he had been treated differently from another equally situated prisoner without any legitimate reasons. Leave was therefore granted for the applicant to commence judicial review proceedings solely on the scheduling ground.', '16\\u2003The Court of Appeal heard the Criminal Review Application on 22 September 2020 together with the Judicial Review Leave Appeal. On 16 October 2020, the court dismissed the Criminal Review Application. Its full reasons are set out in Syed Suhail bin Syed Zin v Public Prosecutor [2020] SGCA 101 (\u201cSyed Suhail (Criminal Review)\u201d).', '17\\u2003The two grounds on which the applicant made the Criminal Review Application (Syed Suhail (Criminal Review) at [11]) are not particularly relevant to the issues before me, save that: (a) they both turned on whether new evidence could be adduced as well as their materiality; and consequently (b) they did not rely on any change in the law that could impact the applicant\u2019s present case. I will return to these points when I consider whether the applicant is equally situated with Datchinamurthy as well as another comparator Mr Ravi raised in the hearing before me on 30 November 2020.'"}
{"casename":"2021_SGHC_32","fact":"'5\\u2003The liquidator seeks the court\u2019s directions on these questions under s 273(3) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe Act\u201d). This application poses the following questions to me:', '6\\u2003The defendant in the litigation which the liquidator must now decide whether to adopt or discontinue is Metax Eco Solutions Pte Ltd. I shall refer to this company for convenience as \u201cthe defendant\u201d, even though it is not a defendant in this application. The defendant was permitted to intervene in this application in order to present written and oral submissions on the questions posed. Not surprisingly, the defendant opposed the liquidator\u2019s position on those questions.', '7\\u2003Having heard the submissions and reviewed the authorities, I have held in favour of the defendant. In my view, the estate costs rule encompasses both litigation which a liquidator commences and litigation which she adopts. It is also my view that the estate costs rule accords priority to the company\u2019s entire liability under an adverse costs order, because that liability is incapable of being resolved in a legal sense into a pre-liquidation component and a post-liquidation component.', '8\\u2003The liquidator then invites me to apply my discretion under s 283(3) of the Act to disapply the estate costs rule on the facts of this case. I do not consider that that would be a proper exercise of my discretion under that section. I find it impossible to distinguish in any principled way this Company\u2019s litigation against this defendant from the general type of litigation which typically falls within the scope of the estate costs rule. Accepting the liquidator\u2019s invitation would amount to an unprincipled and illegitimate circumvention of the estate costs rule.', '9\\u2003The liquidator has appealed against my decision. I now set out my reasons in full.', '10\\u2003The underlying facts are not in dispute and are not material other than as background or context.', '11\\u2003The Company commenced suit against the defendant at the end of 2012 claiming about $3.6m in damages. The defendant rejected the claim and counterclaimed about $2.1m from the Company. The fact that the Company is the plaintiff in the suit is significant. It means that the parties\u2019 dispute cannot be resolved simply by the liquidator adjudicating a proof of debt. The adjudication procedure operates only to resolve claims against the Company. It has no application to claims by the Company. The fact that the defendant has a counterclaim in the suit is also significant. It means that each party is simultaneously in the position of a plaintiff and a defendant in the suit.', '12\\u2003The claim and counterclaim were tried before me over eight days in 2015. After the trial, parties filed and exchanged written closing submissions and written reply submissions in the usual way. A date was fixed in September 2015 for both parties to make their oral closing submissions. 1', '13\\u2003It appears, however, that the Company was in severe financial difficulties well before trial. 2', 'In September 2015, before I could hear the parties\u2019 oral closing submissions, the Company secured an order under s 210(10) of the Act staying all litigation against it 3', 'in anticipation of proposing a scheme of arrangement to its creditors under s 210(1) of the Act. In January 2016, the Company secured leave to propose a scheme of arrangement to its creditors 4', '(see Re Sembawang Engineers and Constructors Pte Ltd [2016] 3 SLR 1057).', '14\\u2003The scheme failed. 5', 'In February 2016, the Company applied to place itself in judicial management. 6', 'In June 2016, a judicial management order was made. 7', 'The applicant was appointed as one of the Company\u2019s judicial managers.', '15\\u2003The judicial management failed. In August 2017, the judicial managers applied for and secured their discharge. 8', 'The Company was immediately placed in compulsory liquidation. 9', 'The liquidator immediately took office as one of the Company\u2019s liquidators.', '16\\u2003The defendant\u2019s counterclaim in the suit against the Company has been automatically stayed, first under s 210(10) of the Act, then under ss 227C(c) and 227D(4)(d) of the Act and finally under s 262(3) of the Act. The plaintiff\u2019s claim against the defendant in the suit was, however, not stayed. That is because the automatic stays apply only to suits against the Company and not to suits by the Company. But because the Company\u2019s claim cannot proceed to judgment separately from the defendant\u2019s counterclaim, its claim against the defendant has been adjourned in parallel with the counterclaim.', '17\\u2003In September 2017, the defendant lodged a proof of debt for $2.7m. 10', 'That sum comprises the full value of the defendant\u2019s counterclaim of $2.1m and a further $0.6m in legal costs incurred thus far in defending the Company\u2019s claim and advancing the defendant\u2019s counterclaim. The liquidator has yet to adjudicate upon the defendant\u2019s proof of debt.', '18\\u2003The defendant has little prospect of recovering any meaningful dividend on its proof, even if the liquidator admits it. That is because the Company is deeply insolvent. It has assets estimated to be worth $24m but owes over 700 creditors $191m and owes contingent creditors a further $177m. 11', '19\\u2003The Company\u2019s deeply insolvent position means that the questions which the liquidator poses in this application (see [5] above) are not academic. They are of practical significance. The defendant\u2019s pre-liquidation costs of the litigation are virtually the whole of the costs of the litigation. These costs arise ab initio, and include receiving the writ and the statement of claim, drafting the defence and the counterclaim, conducting discovery and the trial, and run right up to filing the written closing submissions. The defendant\u2019s post-liquidation costs, by contrast, are confined virtually to the costs of and incidental to presenting and responding to the oral closing submissions. The defendant\u2019s post-liquidation costs are therefore nominal by comparison to its pre-liquidation costs. The liquidator candidly concedes that, if she adopts the litigation and the Company loses, its assets are insufficient to pay the defendant\u2019s pre-liquidation costs in full. 12', 'But it appears that the Company does have enough assets to pay the defendant\u2019s post-liquidation costs in full.', '20\\u2003Before answering the questions posed to me, I should point out that the issues which this application raises are confined to how our insolvency law treats discretionary costs awarded against a company in insolvent liquidation, ie costs which the court awards under para 13 of the First Schedule to the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) (\u201cSCJA\u201d) and O 59 r 2(2) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe Rules\u201d). The issues which this application raises do not touch on costs which are payable as of right, ie costs which a litigant has a legal right to recover from the counterparty, whether by reason of contract (see, eg, Gomba Holdings (UK) Ltd and others v Minories Finance Ltd and others (No 2) [1993] 1 Ch 171 or more recently Chee Kheong Mah Chaly and others v Liquidators of Baring Futures (Singapore) Pte Ltd [2003] 2 SLR(R) 571 (\u201cBaring Futures\u201d) at [49]) or (in limited circumstances) as damages for a legal wrong (see British Racing Drivers\u2019 Club Ltd and another v Hextall Erskine & Co [1996] PNLR 523 and more recently Hermann v Withers LLP [2012] EWHC 1492 (Ch)).', '21\\u2003I make two points about the nature of discretionary costs.', '22\\u2003First, discretionary costs are awarded on the indemnity principle. The indemnity principle dictates that a successful party ought to recover an indemnity \u2013 no less, but also no more \u2013 for the costs which it has had to incur as between solicitor and client in order to vindicate its legal rights in the litigation (see Then Khek Koon and another v Arjun Permanand Samtani and another and other suits [2014] 1 SLR 245 at [153]\u2013[160] and Harold v Smith (1860) 5 II & N 381 at 385). For that reason, the discretion to award costs is to be exercised ordinarily so that costs follow the event (see O 59 r 3(2) of the Rules). A court will award discretionary costs in the course of litigation as and when the event to which those costs relate becomes known. Thus, the court typically awards costs for an interlocutory application when the application is decided. And the court typically awards costs for the overall litigation ab initio together with or immediately after judgment. In both instances, the costs are awarded when the event which they follow becomes known by judicial determination.', '23\\u2003Second, the indemnity principle yields only a partial indemnity to the receiving party for the solicitor and client costs it has incurred to secure the event in its favour. The indemnity principle dictates that a receiving party recovers only a reasonable amount for the costs which it has reasonably incurred as between solicitor and client to secure its success in the litigation. Who bears the burden of proving reasonableness or unreasonableness, as the case may be, depends on whether the costs are awarded on the standard basis or on the indemnity basis. But even where costs are awarded on the indemnity basis, the costs ordered are not a full indemnity to the receiving party, ie precisely equal to its actual solicitor and client costs (see Maryani Sadeli v Arjun Permanand Samtani [2015] 1 SLR 496 at [13]). In our system, there will always be a gap between the costs which the receiving party has actually incurred as between solicitor and client and the costs which the court holds it ought reasonably to have incurred as between party and party.', '24\\u2003Before going further, I make four points on terminology.', '25\\u2003First, when this application was filed and decided, the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act 2018 (Act 40 of 2018) (\u201cIRDA\u201d) had been passed but was not yet in force. I therefore refer to the relevant legislative provisions as they stood in the Act at the time of this application and not to their current counterparts in the IRDA. Having said that, I do not consider that the questions posed on this application would be answered any differently had the IRDA been in force at the material time.', '26\\u2003 Second, I assume for ease of exposition that a company\u2019s liquidation commences on the day that the court orders it to be wound up and appoints a liquidator (contrary to the position deemed by s 255(2) of the Act). I also assume that a liquidator will take a decision whether to adopt or discontinue the litigation as soon as she is appointed (contrary to the practical realities). I therefore use the terms \u201cpre-liquidation\u201d and \u201cpost-liquidation\u201d as convenient albeit inaccurate shorthand to refer to each side of the scintilla temporis on which the issues in this application turn.', '27\\u2003Third, and following from my second assumption, I shall use \u201cpre-liquidation costs\u201d to refer to legal costs which the opponent of a company in liquidation incurs as between solicitor and client before the commencement of the liquidation (as I have defined it at [26] above). \u201cPost-liquidation costs\u201d thus means the solicitor and client legal costs which the litigation opponent incurs after the commencement of the liquidation.', '28\\u2003Finally, when I use the term \u201ccosts order\u201d, I mean a costs order which a court makes against a company after it goes into formal liquidation. A costs order made against a company before it goes into formal liquidation is simply a provable debt and is, of course, outside the scope of the estate costs rule. And when I use the term \u201cliquidation\u201d, I mean an insolvent liquidation.

The third and fourth batches, together with an additional 20 drums that Globchem had, were also shipped to Karl Rapp on 6 February 2015 on the First Defendant\u2019s instructions. In total, 240 drums were directed for shipment to Karl Rapp, with each drum weighing 16 tons.', '26\\u2003Following the First Defendant\u2019s termination, the plaintiffs ordered a test on these relevant drums (collectively, the \u201cGlobchem-Karl Rapp shipments\u201d). It was then discovered that eight of the nine samples contained water instead of Kovryal and the remaining appeared to be heavily contaminated. 22', '27\\u2003The plaintiffs claimed that amongst the drums of genuine Kovryal held by Globchem, the First Defendant had caused 30 tons to be sold to Mr Sheth, through Luxepack. These sales occurred in two tranches, amounting to US$170,800 and US$195,200. Concurrently, the First Defendant had supposedly arranged for the 240 drums of genuine Kovyral to be switched to water in order to \u201cdeceive Karl Rapp\u201d. 23', '28\\u2003On 20 March 2016, the First Defendant had instructed the plaintiff\u2019s associate company, O\u2019Laughlin Industries Inc to ship certain products for sale to Singapore customers. To this end, the First Defendant also suggested the use of local freight forwarder, AGX Logistics, which had a new warehouse and had purportedly offered to store the goods for free in return for future business.', '29\\u2003On 16 May 2016, 228 drums of products termed \u201cTonalid\u201d, which were worth US$102,600, were therefore delivered to the warehouse of AGX Logistics. The products were further transferred as consignment goods to Karl Rapp on 11 September 2016. On 6 October 2016, however, the plaintiffs received an email from a representative of Karl Rapp, Ms Marja Versteeg (\u201cMs Versteeg\u201d). In that email, Ms Versteeg claimed that the drums that were supposed to have contained the Tonalid had been repacked with sea salt instead.', '30\\u2003The plaintiffs also claimed that the 228 drums of genuine Tonalid had been sold to Mr Sheth\u2019s company on 20 June 2016, through Pegasus. The purchase price of US$71,250 was subsequently remitted to Pegasus\u2019 UOB bank account on 26 September 2016. 24', '31\\u2003On board the shipment to Karl Rapp was also seven drums of Kovyral, which were worth US$13,300. Upon arrival, however, it was discovered that the drums were damaged and rusty. The plaintiff\u2019s solicitors subsequently discovered from AGX Logistics that the latter had been instructed to pick up the seven drums from Nardev Chemie Pte Ltd (\u201cNardev Chemie\u201d) and to deliver them to Lam Seng Hang Co Pte Ltd, together with one empty container. 25', 'Nardev Chemie was a customer of the plaintiffs and appeared to have rejected the seven drums earlier. 26', '32\\u2003The plaintiffs\u2019 evidence was that both the Globchem-Karl Rapp shipments and the AGX Logistics\u2013Karl Rapp shipments were no longer fit for purpose. The products hence had to be disposed of in order to mitigate losses.', '33\\u2003The extent of losses suffered in relation to both shipments were listed by MFO in his AEIC as such: 27', '34\\u2003It bears noting also that on 27 February 2019, upon an application by the plaintiffs before me, an interim judgment was entered into as against the First Defendant and Pegasus (see also O\u2019Laughlin Industries Co Ltd and another v Tan Thiam hock and others [2020] SGHCR 6 at [7]). The First Defendant and Pegasus were ordered to pay the plaintiffs the sum of US$1,677,040, which can be further broken down as follows: 28', '(a)\\u2003Losses suffered as a result of the sale to Pegasus, amounting to US$704,040.', '(b)\\u2003Losses suffered as a result of the First Defendant\u2019s deception in relation to Tonalid, amounting to US$102,600.', '(c)\\u2003Losses suffered as a result of the First Defendant\u2019s deception in relation to Kovyral, amounting to US$870,400.'"}

Kannan \nlater passed Exhibit E1 to Vinod. Exhibit E1, which was found in Pravin\u2019s car, \nhad originated from Exhibit B2A, which was the block of cannabis which had \nbeen cut open and found under Ashvin\u2019s bed.20 The case hinged primarily on \nthe evidence of Ashvin and Arun, and was supported by communication \nrecords, as well as the evidence of Pravin and Vinod.\nAshvin\u2019s evidence \n16 Ashvin testified that he had been close friends with Kannan since \nprimary school.21 On 2 June 2016, at about 8.00pm, Kannan asked Ashvin over \nthe phone whether he could leave some \u201cstuff\u201d at Ashvin\u2019s flat (ie, the Unit). \nAshvin understood \u201cstuff\u201d to mean cannabis. Ashvin disagreed and said that he \nwould call Kannan later.22 Kannan subsequently went to the Unit at about \n9.00pm to 10.00pm. While in Ashvin\u2019s room, Kannan asked Ashvin again \nwhether he could help to keep the \u201cstuff\u201d. Although Ashvin was reluctant to \nhelp, he neither agreed nor disagreed to Kannan\u2019s request.23 He was \u201calmost \nagreeable\u201d because the \u201cpressure upon [him] was too much\u201d.24 He testified that \nit was easy to reject Kannan\u2019s request over the phone, but when he saw Kannan \n20 Prosecution\u2019s Closing Submissions (\u201cPCS\u201d) at para 18 \n21 NE (27 August 2020) at p 6 ln 32\u201333\n22 NE (27 August 2020) at p 9 ln 8\u201317 \n23 NE (27 August 2020) at p 9 ln 22 to p 10 ln 17 \n24 NE (27 August 2020) at p 47 ln 20\u201327\nVersion No 1: 16 Feb 2021 (08:14 hrs)\nPP v Kannan s\/o R Kumaran[2021] SGHC 36\n8in person, he felt \u201cobliged\u201d to do him a favour as a friend.25 Arun then arrived \nat the Unit. When Ashvin went to open the gate of the Unit for Arun, Arun told \nAshvin that Kannan had requested that Arun help him collect drugs, that Kannan \nwas \u201cvery persistent\u201d and that he had \u201cno choice\u201d. In Ashvin\u2019s room, Kannan \ntold Arun not to worry, that it would be a \u201cfast pickup\u201d and that the drugs only \nweighed 500g.26 Arun was eventually agreeable to Kannan\u2019s request. Kannan \nthen took Ashvin\u2019s phone to book a \u201cGrab\u201d car for Arun to collect the drugs. \n17 After a while, Kannan and Arun left the Unit. Ashvin then received a \nphone call from his friend asking him to meet downstairs. Ashvin took this \nopportunity to leave the Unit to avoid having to help Kannan keep the drugs. \nHe locked the bedroom window and window grilles so that Kannan would not \nbe able to put the drugs through his window. Ashvin then went downstairs.27 \nWhen Kannan subsequently saw Ashvin downstairs, he told Ashvin to wait for \nArun to come back. Ashvin testified that he had \u201cno choice\u201d because Kannan \nwas already there in person, and that \u201cin person, the pressure was different\u201d.28 \nSometime later, Kannan told Ashvin that Arun was already outside the Unit but \nwas unable to slide the drugs through the window as the windows were locked. \nAt this point, Ashvin also received a call from Arun. Ashvin then went up to the \nUnit and entered it to unlock the window, before coming out of the Unit.

Ashvin joined his \nfriends and Arun left.29\n18 While Ashvin was with his friends, Kannan went over to him again and \ntold him that he needed to go up to the Unit to pack some drugs to pass to his \ncustomers. While Ashvin and Kannan were in the lift on the way up to the Unit, \nAshvin told Kannan that the amount of drugs looked to be more than 500g, to \nwhich Kannan responded, \u201cIf I told you all it was more, you all wouldn\u2019t do \nit\u201d.30 Ashvin testified that he felt \u201ccheated\u201d and wanted Kannan to clear all the \ndrugs from the Unit.31\n19 Ashvin then entered the Unit and Kannan passed a red plastic bag which \ncontained a weighing scale (identified by Ashvin as Exhibit C4A)32 through the \nwindow to Ashvin. A few minutes later, Kannan went into Ashvin\u2019s bedroom \nand asked for some plastic bags. Ashvin found a roll of plastic bags in his \nkitchen (identified by Ashvin as Exhibit C6),33 which he passed to Kannan. \nAshvin saw Kannan unpacking one block of cannabis and attempting to break \nit up.

As such, the Prosecution further applied to refresh his memory by \nshowing him other statements recorded from him.40 The statements shown to \nArun were:\n(a) a long statement recorded under s 22 of the CPC by Senior \nStation Inspector Adam Ismail (\u201cSSI Ismail\u201d) on 7 June 2016 at about \n8.45am (\u201cArun\u2019s first long statement\u201d);\n(b) a long statement recorded under s 22 of the CPC by SSI Ismail \non 7 June 2016 at about 2.20pm (\u201cArun\u2019s second long statement\u201d); and\n(c) a long statement recorded under s 22 of the CPC by SSI Ismail \non 13 October 2016 at about 9.30am (\u201cArun\u2019s third long statement\u201d).\n23 Despite being shown the statements, Arun maintained that he could not \nrecall the events leading to his arrest on 3 June 2016. The Prosecution thereafter \napplied to cross-examine Arun on these statements, as well as a cautioned \nstatement recorded from Arun under s 23 of the CPC by SSI Ismail on 3 June \n2016 (\u201cArun\u2019s cautioned statement\u201d), which was shown to him in the course of \ncross-examination. The Prosecution also applied to admit the four statements as \nsubstantive evidence under s 147(3) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) \n(\u201cEvidence Act\u201d). I set out the key details in the statements recorded from Arun \nbelow.\n24 In Arun\u2019s contemporaneous statement, he stated that Kannan had told \nhim to collect a brown bag.

Kannan had directed him over the phone to \nwalk towards a block near 256 Punggol Way and to collect a bag that was near \nthe electrical box. Kannan had told him to place the bag in Ashvin\u2019s Unit. Arun \ncalled Ashvin when he reached the Unit and Ashvin came up from the void deck \nto take the bag from him.\n25 In Arun\u2019s cautioned statement, he stated that Kannan had been pestering \nhim to collect some \u201cstuff\u201d over the past two weeks. He initially refused but \nrelented as Kannan was persistent. He then collected the \u201cstuff\u201d beside the \nelectrical box in an open field beside Block 256 Punggol. The \u201cstuff\u201d was inside \na brown bag and covered by a red plastic bag. Kannan told him to take a cab \nand head to the Unit to pass the bag to Ashvin, which he did. Kannan had \ninstructed Arun what to do over the phone when Arun was collecting the \n\u201cstuff\u201d.41 \n26 Arun\u2019s first long statement was materially similar to his cautioned \nstatement. He stated that Kannan had been asking him to help to collect \u201cweed\u201d, \nwhich he understood to mean cannabis, for the past two weeks.42 Arun \neventually agreed to his request. On 2 June 2016, Arun followed Kannan to the \nUnit. Arun subsequently left the Unit for Punggol in a \u201cGrab\u201d car that Ashvin \nbooked with his phone. While on his way to Punggol, Kannan called Arun and \ntold him that he was to pick up a small bag located at an electrical box and bring \nit to the Unit. After Arun had picked up the brown bag, he called a \u201cGrab\u201d car \nand proceeded to the Unit. \n41 P200\n42 P197 at para 2 \nVersion No 1: 16 Feb 2021 (08:14 hrs)\nPP v Kannan s\/o R Kumaran[2021] SGHC 36\n1327 Upon reaching the Unit, Arun called Kannan and told him that no one \nwas inside the Unit.

They left the Unit thereafter.\n28 On 3 June 2016 at about 12.30am, Arun returned to Block 327 Yishun \nto meet with Ashvin and Naveen. They went up to the Unit where Ashvin passed \nsome \u201cweed\u201d wrapped in white paper to Naveen through his bedroom window. \n29 In Arun\u2019s second long statement, he identified the brown bag that he \ncollected \u201cbeside the electrical box at Block 256 or 259 [Punggol]\u201d. At the \nmaterial time, he saw that there was a red plastic bag in the brown bag but did \nnot check what was inside. He was anxious and had started to panic when he \ncollected the bag.

Arun was shown an extract of \n\u2018WhatsApp\u2019 messages from Kannan\u2019s phone, which Arun identified as \nmessages sent at the time when Kannan told him to collect the \u201cthings\u201d for him. \nIn particular, the message \u201c822261 opposite the big field\u201d sent to him from \nKannan gave the \u201clocation that [he was] supposed to go to collect \u2018Kannan\u2019s\u2019 \nthings\u201d.45\n43 P198 at para 9\n44 P198 at para 14\n45 P199 at para 19 \nVersion No 1: 16 Feb 2021 (08:14 hrs)\nPP v Kannan s\/o R Kumaran[2021] SGHC 36\n14Pravin\u2019s evidence\n31 Pravin testified that sometime after 10.00pm on 2 June 2016, Vinod \ncalled Kannan to ask if the cannabis which they had ordered from a him a few \ndays before was ready for collection.

Dilip also called and asked him where he, \nAshvin and Arun were. Kannan told Dilip that Ashvin and Arun would be at the \n\u201cpondok\u201d, which Kannan described as a \u201csmall shelter with chairs and table\u201d, \nor a \u201chut\u201d. 65 Kannan further told Dilip that he was also reaching the \u201cpondok\u201d \nsoon and would pass his phone to them so that Dilip could communicate with \nthem. Dilip then told Kannan to send the postal code to Arun.66 \n40 When he reached his block, he saw Ashvin, Arun and some other friends \nat the said \u201cpondok\u201d. Kannan told Ashvin and Arun that Dilip had called and \nwanted to speak to them. He then passed his phone to Ashvin and Arun, who \ncalled Dilip using Kannan\u2019s phone. After using the phone, they left it on the \ntable at the \u201cpondok\u201d.67 Thereafter, Arun left. Kannan then lent his phone to \nAshvin again as the latter asked for it, before going upstairs to his own flat. \nWhen he returned downstairs after about 15 minutes, he saw that Ashvin was \nstanding outside the \u201cpondok\u201d speaking on the phone.68\n41 Thereafter, Vinod called Kannan saying that he was coming over to the \nshelter of a block, which was a separate location from the \u201cpondok\u201d, so that \nKannan could give him his gambling winnings of $100.69 Arun then called \nKannan and asked the latter to pass the phone to Ashvin, as he had tried to call \nAshvin but the call did not go through.

Kannan passed his phone to Ashvin and told Ashvin to \ncharge his phone for him as its battery was running low.70 \n42 Arun then came and said that he was going for a party and that he would \nreturn thereafter. About 10 to 15 minutes after Arun left, Kannan went up to the \nUnit as Ashvin had been \u201cmissing for a long time\u201d. According to Kannan, he \nwent up sometime near midnight. He went into the Unit and knocked on the \ndoor of Ashvin's bedroom. When Ashvin opened the door, he was holding onto \nthe \u201cinstrument\u201d used for consuming \u201cice\u201d in his hand, and he looked panicky. \nHe appeared to be \u201chyper\u201d and was perspiring.71\n43 Kannan saw his phone at the corner of Ashvin\u2019s bed. As he was taking \nhis phone, he \u201cbumped\u201d into a block on the floor. He then asked Ashvin, \u201cYou \nare still doing this?\u201d, to which Ashvin responded by giggling and saying that it \nwas just for casual smoking. Kannan testified that he shook his head and moved \nthe block to the side as it was in his path. Kannan told Ashvin that he was going \ndownstairs first to pass money to Vinod, and Ashvin said that he would go down \nto see Vinod later. Kannan was in Ashvin\u2019s bedroom for about 5 to 10 minutes. \nAlleged false implication by Vinod \n44 Kannan testified that he met Vinod at a shelter, where he gave Vinod his \ngambling winnings of $100, but Vinod only took $50 and told him to transfer \nthe balance $50 to an account. Pravin was also present near the car.72 Kannan \nfurther testified that Vinod did not order any cannabis from him and denied \n70 NE (16 September 2020) at p 19 ln 12\u201327\n71 NE (16 September 2020) at p 19 ln 30 to p 21 ln 13 \n72 NE (16 September 2020) at p 21 ln 28 to p 23 ln 24 \nVersion No 1: 16 Feb 2021 (08:14 hrs)\nPP v Kannan s\/o R Kumaran[2021] SGHC 36\n19handing Exhibit E1 to Vinod.73 He alleged that Vinod was implicating him \nbecause of Vinod\u2019s friendship with Ashvin.74 \nAlleged false implication by Ashvin and Arun\n45 Kannan denied having gone to Ashvin\u2019s Unit between 9.00 to 10.00pm \nor asking Ashvin to help to keep drugs for him.  He testified that he believed \nthat Ashvin had chosen to implicate him instead of \u201c[telling] the truth that it was \nArun who gave [the drugs to him]\u201d. He stated that Ashvin and Arun consumed \ncannabis together and would \u201ctend to protect their own community\u201d. Since \nKannan was under urine supervision by the CNB, it would be \u201cconvenient for \n[Ashvin] to shift the blame\u201d to Kannan. Kannan was also the last to leave \nAshvin\u2019s Unit and he had seen the block of cannabis when he went up to the \nUnit to take his phone. Ashvin and Arun had also used his phone to make calls \nto Malaysia to contact Dilip. Ashvin had also consumed \u201cice\u201d and might \ntherefore have become \u201cparanoid\u201d and \u201coverstretch[ed] [his] thinking\u201d.75\n46 Kannan also denied having directed Arun to an electrical box near \nPunggol field to collect a bag, or that he had directed Arun to pass the bag to \nAshvin.76 The message containing the postal code \u201c822261\u201d sent from Kannan\u2019s \nphone to Arun was forwarded from Dilip, who told Kannan to send the message \nto Arun.77 Most of his calls made and messages sent between him and Arun on \n31 May, 1, 2 and 3 June 2016 exhibited in the prosecution\u2019s summary table of \n73 NE (16 September 2020) at p 25 ln 8\u201320\n74 NE (16 September 2020) at p 26 ln 10\u201321\n75 NE (16 September 2020) at p 35 ln 31 to p 36 ln 27 \n76 NE (16 September 2020) at p 39 ln 31\u201332; p 40 ln 26 to p 41 ln 8\n77 NE (16 September 2020) at p 42 ln 7\u20139; p 43 ln 21\u201324\nVersion No 1: 16 Feb 2021 (08:14 hrs)\nPP v Kannan s\/o R Kumaran[2021] SGHC 36\n20telecommunication records were in relation to the collection of gambling money \nfrom Oscar.78 He ventured various reasons as to why Arun would implicate him, \nincluding his belief that Arun and Ashvin belonged to one \u201cteam\u201d and one \n\u201ccommunity\u201d who consumed cannabis. He stated that Ashvin and Arun had a \nclose relationship, whereas he was not close to Arun. He testified as follows:79\nWhat I think is before I---what I feel is that before I entered into \ntheir lives, they were very happy consuming cannabis. Arun has \nalso sold cannabis. And they are using my phone to talk to \nDilip. They are one community. We can say that they are one \nteam. Except for the team itself, who else knows that they are \nhaving this cannabis? That\u2019s what I can think of, I can\u2019t think \nof anything else. Even the phone calls, they have used my \nphone to make calls to Malaysia. And when CNB was arresting \nArun, they had shown my photo to Arun, they had shown both \nmy photo and Ashvin\u2019s photo to Arun. In the contemporaneous \nstatement, Arun had used the word \u201cthey\u201d, so who is he \nreferring to? And after that, he had said that he\u2019s referring to \none cousin Kanna. This is what I feel, but I myself did not \nunderstand.\n47 He further testified that Ashvin and Arun had \u201cjoined together\u201d and \n\u201cteamed up\u201d, stating:80\n78 NE (16 September 2020) at p 45 ln 18\u201321\n79 NE (16 September 2020) at p 49 ln 3\u201312\n80 NE (16 September 2020) at p 49 ln 19\u201332\nVersion No 1: 16 Feb 2021 (08:14 hrs)\nPP v Kannan s\/o R Kumaran[2021] SGHC 36\n21I know that both of them consumed cannabis, but I do not know \nif they sell cannabis. That has got nothing to do with me. It\u2019s \nonly after I saw the thing in Ashvin\u2019s room that I felt one kind. \nI think that both of them, Ashvin and Arun, are up to \nsomething, they are doing something. They have cannabis to \nconsume every day, where are they getting it from? That\u2019s what \nI myself do not understand. This is a death penalty case. Both \nof them are always consuming cannabis and the journey is a \nvery smooth journey. And I am not sure if they got arrested \nbecause of my phone, because they used my phone. I can\u2019t \nthink of anything else, I do not know. Both of them have joined \ntogether, both of them have teamed up.\n48 When asked by his counsel Mr Ram Goswami (\u201cMr Goswami\u201d) to \nelaborate as to what he meant by Ashvin and Arun having \u201cteamed up\u201d, Kannan \ntestified that although he was scared when he was shown the \u201cnotice saying that \nif you cooperate, you can be spared the death penalty\u201d, he told the CNB officers \nthe truth. However, Ashvin and Arun had lied in their statements to the CNB.81 \nAs to why Ashvin and Arun would \u201cteam up\u201d against him, Kannan testified that \nthey had done so \u201c[f]or their lives to be spared [and to] escape the gallows\u201d, \nwhich was \u201cwhy they [had] already been sentenced\u201d and did not even go for \ntrial.82\n49 Kannan testified that when he was brought to the CNB Headquarters \nafter his arrest, he saw Arun, Ashvin, Pravin and Vinod in the room where he \nwas taken to give his urine specimen. He testified that he did not hear them talk \nbut saw them signalling to each other. However, he also testified that he asked \nAshvin and Arun why his name was being mentioned, to which they shrugged \ntheir shoulders in response.83 \n81 NE (16 September 2020) at p 50 ln 11\u201329\n82 NE (16 September 2020) at p 51 ln 24\u201326\n83 NE (16 September 2020) at p 52 ln 19\u201329\nVersion No 1: 16 Feb 2021 (08:14 hrs)\nPP v Kannan s\/o R Kumaran[2021] SGHC 36\n2250 Further, Kannan testified that a \u201cChinese guy\u201d (later identified by the \nProsecution as Wong), who was in the same cell as Kannan at the Police \nCantonment Complex (\u201cPCC\u201d), had been brought for drug withdrawal \nassessment and back in the same van as Ashvin and Arun. This Chinese male \ntold Kannan that Arun and Ashvin were talking to each other and that they had \nconspired to frame him.84 Finally, Kannan claimed that after Vinod had given \nhis testimony in court on 26 August 2020, Vinod and Pravin had told Ashvin \nand Arun about what they had testified in court in the lock-up.85\nOscar\u2019s evidence \n51 The Defence called Oscar as the second Defence witness. Oscar testified \nthat he placed bets with Kannan, and that Arun had collected money from him \non behalf of Kannan. He testified that he owed Kannan about $2000 at the time \nfor \u201cbetting money\u201d before Kannan was arrested.86\nWong\u2019s evidence \n52 Following from Kannan\u2019s evidence that one Chinese male had told him \nthat he heard Ashvin and Arun conspire to falsely implicate him, further \ninvestigations were conducted by the CNB after the Defence case was closed. \nWong\u2019s identity was ascertained based on CNB\u2019s records showing that he had \nshared the same van as Ashvin and Arun on the way to the Changi Medical \nComplex (\u201cCMC\u201d) and was placed in the same cell as Kannan at the PCC. A \nwritten statement was recorded from Wong and disclosed to the Defence.

After \nthis interview, the Defence confirmed their position that they would call Wong \nas a Defence witness.\n53 Wong testified that he was in the same van as two Indian males on the \nway to the CMC. During the ride, he heard them say that they wanted to \u201cpush \nthe blame to someone\u201d and \u201cpush everything to\u2026[someone]\u201d.88 Wong was later \nplaced in the same cell as Kannan at the PCC. When they were discussing their \ncases, Wong thought that Kannan\u2019s case sounded similar to the case that the two \nIndian males were speaking about in the van. Wong testified that he did not \nknow who the two males were referring to when they said that they wanted to \n\u201cpush everything to him\u201d, but assumed that \u201chim\u201d referred to Kannan since they \nwere apparently speaking about the same case as Kannan.89 \nMy decision\nElements of the charge \n54 Kannan was charged with abetment by entering into a conspiracy with \nArun and Ashvin for Arun to traffic 829g of cannabis to Ashvin by instructing \n87 Prosecution\u2019s Submissions dated 6 November 2020 at paras 4\u20138\n88 NE (23 November 2020) at p 4 ln 29 to p 5 ln 27 \n89 NE (23 November 2020) at p 7 ln 10\u201332 \nVersion No 1: 16 Feb 2021 (08:14 hrs)\nPP v Kannan s\/o R Kumaran[2021] SGHC 36\n24Arun to deliver the drugs to Ashvin at the Unit on 2 June 2016 at about 9.00pm. \nThe Prosecution would need to show that Kannan (a) had engaged in a \nconspiracy for Arun to deliver the drugs to Ashvin, and (b) that an act was \ncommitted in pursuance of the aforementioned conspiracy, ie, that Kannan had \ninstructed Arun to deliver the drugs (Public Prosecutor v Tangaraju s\/o Suppiah \n[2018] SGHC 279 at [49]). \n55 The mens rea for abetment by conspiracy is that the abettor must have \n(a) intended to be party to an agreement to do an unlawful act; and (b) known \nthe general purpose of the common design, and the fact that the act agreed to be \ncommitted is unlawful (Ali bin Mohamad Bahashwan v Public Prosecutor and \nother"}

The arrangement was proposed \u201cin order to comply with [Malaysia\u2019s rules on] non-solicitation of investment\u201d. 53', '23\\u2003The Proposed Conversion, however, was never implemented, and the parties recognise this. 54', 'In other words, the plaintiff\u2019s investment was never altered along the lines of the Proposed Conversion. It is hence immaterial, and I will not canvass further details relating to the same.

The plaintiff would then be investing in the Chinamall Project through the first defendant by way of a trust deed (the \u201cTrust Deed\u201d), wherein the first defendant would hold its shareholder loan amounting to the Investment Sum on trust for the plaintiff. The Conversion would replace the Convertible Loan Note. 60', 'This was to be the arrangement with respect to the other 12 investors in the Chinamall Project as well. The first defendant would then hold 80% of the shares in Midas, and hold its shareholder loan to Midas on trust for the respective investors to the extent of their investment sums that were previously structured as convertible loan notes. 61', '27\\u2003Ms Tiolani sent the second defendant queries relating to the Conversion in an email dated 4 August 2014.

He also gave evidence that \u201c[n]evertheless, [he] was not troubled by the change in the form \/ structure of [his] investment\u201d, because he trusted the second defendant to \u201cact in [his] best interest\u201d.

Further, it is the second defendant\u2019s evidence that at or around this time, the Chinamall Project was experiencing delays and Midas was facing financial difficulties \u2013 I will elaborate more on this in the course of this Judgment (see [201] and [202] below).', '30\\u2003On or about 3 September 2014, the second defendant sent Ms Tiolani the Trust Deed, which was dated 31 August 2014. 65', 'The parties to the Trust Deed, as indicated on the instrument, were the plaintiff and the first defendant; the Trust Deed states, inter alia, as follows: 66', '(a)\\u2003the first defendant was the legal owner of a US$1.6m shareholder loan to Midas; and', '(b)\\u2003the first defendant held the said loan and all interest accrued or to accrue on the same on trust for the plaintiff.', '31\\u2003Attached to the Trust Deed sent to the plaintiff was a key document \u2013 a letter dated 30 June 2014 from the first defendant to Midas (the \u201cOT Letter\u201d). 67', 'This was the first time the OT Letter was brought to the plaintiff\u2019s attention (ie, in the second defendant\u2019s email dated 3 September 2014). 68', 'The OT Letter provided that the first defendant would provide shareholder loans to Midas in the aggregate sums of S$9.5m and US$4.94m on the following conditions: 69', '(a)\\u2003The purpose of the loans was to finance the purchase of \u201cPandan Perdana Safari Lagoon Shopping Complex\u201d in Ampang, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, ie, the Mall.', '(b)\\u2003The status of the loans was stated as \u201c[u]nsecured and subordinated\u201d.', '(c)\\u2003The final maturity date of the investment (by way of the loans) was \u201c[u]ntil further notice from [Midas]\u201d.', '(d)\\u2003Repayment of the loans would be \u201cat any time and in any amount as permitted by the project financing bank for the acquisition of [the Mall]\u201d.', '(e)\\u2003The applicable interest rate was 20% per annum on an uncompounded basis, payable after project completion. Revision to the interest rate shall be subject to agreement between the first defendant and Midas.', '(f)\\u2003The appendix to the OT Letter also stated the breakdown of the various loans provided by the 13 investors (including the plaintiff). 70', 'It also indicated that these \u201c[r]emittances\u201d to Midas were on behalf of the first defendant (which put the first defendant in the shoes of a loan holder or creditor).', '32\\u2003Seen in context of the Trust Deed and the OT Letter, it is clear that the 26 July 2014 MOA and the 18 August 2014 Letter were steps taken by the defendants to implement the Conversion. The plaintiff was, of course, unaware as at 3 September 2014 (when he received the Trust Deed and the OT Letter) that such steps had in fact been taken.', '33\\u2003Initially, the plaintiff did not sign and return the Trust Deed to the defendants. 71', 'This appeared to be because of his concern over the lack of security over his investment if the Conversion was to take effect. 72', 'This concern had two facets. First, the plaintiff \u201cunderstood that the terms of the OT Letter\u2026 would seriously prejudice [his] investment\u201d, due to the \u201c[u]nsecured and subordinated\u201d nature of the loan extended to Midas. 73', 'He nevertheless, in these proceedings, adopts the position that he is not bound by the OT Letter, given that he is not a party to the OT Letter, and because the second defendant had issued it to Midas without his (the plaintiff\u2019s) consent, knowledge or approval. Second, Ms Tiolani pointed out to the plaintiff that the Trust Deed made no reference to the Security Documents, 74', 'which as mentioned formed the basis of the plaintiff\u2019s security in the Investment Agreement (see [20(b)] and [20(c)] above). The plaintiff was concerned as a result, as he understood the significance of the Security Documents, and stated that these were \u201cimportant\u201d to him.', '34\\u2003In this regard, in an email dated 17 November 2014, the second defendant expressly stated that no collateral would be provided by Midas. 75', 'In this email, the second defendant also asserted that all the investors except the plaintiff had signed the relevant trust deeds. As a result, the plaintiff instructed Ms Tiolani to seek clarification from the second defendant regarding the Security Documents. 76', 'Thus, on 18 November 2014, Ms Tiolani sent the second defendant an email, wherein she highlighted that the Trust Deed made no mention of the Security Documents, and sought clarification in this regard. 77', '35\\u2003On 19 November 2014, the second defendant sent Ms Tiolani an email, wherein he explained, inter alia, that the Security Documents had \u201cbeen voided, as per the spirit of our note certificate agreement since the majority investors (represented by One Tree, Wang Yingde and other investors behind us) have taken over the 80% shares to speed up our project\u201d. 78', 'In other words, the second defendant confirmed that the Security Documents no longer had effect and that the arrangement pursuant to the Trust Deed did not involve any security for the plaintiff\u2019s investment.', '36\\u2003The plaintiff alleges that subsequently, there was a phone call between him and the second defendant on 20 November 2014. 79', 'The defendants do not admit that there was such a phone call. 80', 'For reasons that will be made clear, I am persuaded that the phone call occurred. In this phone call, the second defendant allegedly conveyed or expressed the following: 81', '(a)\\u2003The second defendant confirmed what he had stated in the email dated 19 November 2014, specifically that the Security Documents were voided when the Convertible Loan Note was changed to a shareholder\u2019s loan pursuant to the Conversion.', '(b)\\u2003The second defendant requested the plaintiff to sign the Trust Deed before the maturity date of the Convertible Loan Note, ie, 28 November 2014.', '(c)\\u2003The plaintiff was assured that the Mall was valuable and that it could be sold (and the investors paid back) if necessary. 82', '(d)\\u2003The second defendant requested a three-month extension of time for repayment of the Investment Sum and the plaintiff\u2019s returns on his investment, ie, by 28 February 2015. The second defendant represented that the interest\/return on the Investment Sum would continue to accrue at a rate of 20%, as per the CLN T&Cs, until the end of the period of extension.', '37\\u2003Based on what the second defendant had represented in the alleged phone call on 20 November 2014, along with the other information on the Chinamall Project that had been conveyed to the plaintiff via, inter alia, the email correspondence and the Term Sheet, the plaintiff agreed to sign the Trust Deed. 83', 'Thus, on the same day, ie, 20 November 2014, Ms Tiolani emailed the second defendant informing him that the plaintiff had signed the Trust Deed. This email states, in material part: 84', '38\\u2003The plaintiff emphasised in his affidavit evidence that he signed only the Trust Deed and not the OT Letter, chiefly because he did not consider himself to be a party to the OT Letter (which had been executed without his knowledge), and because he was not satisfied with the terms in the OT Letter, namely the lack of a fixed repayment date for his investment. 85', '39\\u2003Despite the email sent by Ms Tiolani on 20 November 2014, the plaintiff did not receive confirmation on the extension of the maturity period from the second defendant. 86', '40\\u2003In 2015, things took a turn for the worse. As of 28 February 2015 (the date on which the plaintiff expected to see some returns given the second defendant\u2019s three-month extension request), the plaintiff had not received any payouts from his investment.', '41\\u2003On 20 April 2015, the defendants emailed Ms Tiolani, informing her that Midas was experiencing difficulties paying its investors, because funds were required in matters pertaining to the Mall, including (a) renovation funds; (b) funds to build a slip road from the nearby highway to the Mall; and (c) funds to acquire the remaining units in the Mall. 87', '42\\u2003On or around 30 September 2015, Badan Pengurusan Bersama Komplek Pandan Safari Lagoon (\u201cthe Midas Creditor\u201d) filed a winding up application against Midas in Malaysia on the ground of Midas\u2019 failure to make payment of the sum of RM1,269,347.03 for outstanding maintenance and services charges, quit rent and insurance premiums related to the Mall. The application succeeded, and on or around 4 December 2015, Midas was ordered to be wound up. 88', '43\\u2003The defendants attempted to challenge to winding up order and filed an appeal. Around March 2016, the first defendant and another investor in the Chinamall Project reached an agreement with the Midas Creditor. This agreement stipulated that in exchange for a payment of RM1.3m in settlement of the sum claimed by the Midas Creditor in its winding up petition, the Midas Creditor would agree to consent to the appeal to the winding up order. 89', '44\\u2003Despite these efforts that were targeted at addressing the very root of the winding up petition, the appeal to the winding up order was dismissed by the Malaysian Court of Appeal on or around 11 October 2016. 90', 'The liquidation of Midas thus proceeded, and a liquidator had been appointed to that effect.', '45\\u2003Following this, the defendants were advised by their solicitors to apply to remove Midas\u2019 liquidator. The second defendant gave unchallenged evidence that the liquidator was attempting to sell the Mall for RM54m, and that the defendants were attempting to resist the liquidator\u2019s efforts. 91', '46\\u2003Thereafter, on or around 6 January 2017, the first defendant engaged Malaysian solicitors to assist in lodging a proof of debt with regard to the shareholder loan extended to Midas pursuant to the Conversion. 92', 'This proof of debt encompassed the value of the plaintiff\u2019s and other investors\u2019 investments in the Chinamall Project. 93', 'However, on 17 July 2017, Midas\u2019 liquidator rejected the proof of debt in its entirety. 94', 'The rejection was premised on, inter alia, grounds that the first defendant was not the party that extended the various loans to Midas \u2013 it was the investors (including the plaintiff) who directly remitted money to Midas, and accordingly the first defendant lacked locus standi to lodge a proof of debt of this nature. 95', '47\\u2003The defendants persisted and appealed against Midas\u2019 liquidator\u2019s rejection of their proof of debt. 96', 'The defendants grounded this appeal on the fact that Midas\u2019 liquidator was the vendor who sold properties to the defendants and had dealings with them. In rejecting the proof of debt, Midas\u2019 liquidator relied on \u201cbare allegations\u201d, 97', 'and ignored, inter alia, the fact that the investors\u2019 loans had been held by the first defendant pursuant to the Conversion. In other words, the defendants questioned the integrity of the liquidator. 98', 'This appeal was likewise dismissed. 99', '48\\u2003Shortly thereafter, on 16 August 2017, the plaintiff commenced proceedings against the defendants. To date, the plaintiff has not been repaid the Investment Sum or any returns on the said sum. 100', '49\\u2003Apart from the arranger fee that the defendants stood to gain from the success of the Chinamall Project (see [14] above), they had also directly invested in the project and, in this sense, had skin in the game. In the course of the events detailed above, the defendants made significant investments in the Chinamall Project. 101', 'The second defendant invested a sum of approximately S$0.5m through the subscription of a convertible loan note issued by Midas under the Investment Agreement, which was eventually re-documented as an investment through a shareholder\u2019s loan. The investment was made in the name of the second defendant\u2019s wife. These payments were:', '(a)\\u2003a payment of S$150,000 made on 10 December 2013;', '(b)\\u2003a payment of S$174,995 made on 8 January 2014; and', '(c)\\u2003a payment of S$174,990 made on 18 February 2014.', '50\\u2003The first defendant also injected RM5m as equity into Midas in order to expedite the Chinamall Project and secure the rights of all the investors. This payment was made sometime on or around 23 September 2014, 102', 'which coincided with the period during which Midas was facing financial difficulties according to the second defendant (see [29] above). Thereafter, on 4 November 2014, the first defendant invested a further sum of S$2.3m in Midas by way of a shareholder\u2019s loan.', '51\\u2003Subsequently, as mentioned, sometime in or around March 2016, the first defendant also reached an agreement with the Midas Creditor to pay the sum of RM1.3m in settlement of the sum claimed in the winding up petition filed by the Midas Creditor against Midas.

Some facts which are disputed \nmay not be relevant to my decision, but are relevant to provide a clearer \nnarrative of this action. I will set out the narrative and point out where the \nrelevant issues of fact are before I set out my findings and reasons so as to render \nthis complicated story with many participants and versions comprehensible. The \ndetailed descriptions of the events which unfolded can be found in the closing \nsubmissions of all counsel, Mr Ong for the plaintiff, Ms Melanie Ho (\u201cMs Ho\u201d) \nfor the defendants, and Mr Zhuo Jiaxiang for the third parties, all of which are \nVersion No 1: 19 Feb 2021 (08:37 hrs)\nPOA Recovery Pte Ltd v Yau Kwok Seng[2021] SGHC 41\n4clearly and comprehensively set out in under 150 pages each in spite of the \nvoluminous oral and documentary evidence before me.\n7 The defendants challenge this action in law and in fact. Although the \ndefendants have set out several \u2018preliminary legal issues\u2019 for the court\u2019s \nconsideration, the primary defence in law, as I see it, is that the plaintiff has no \nlegal standing to bring an action because its attempt to sue on behalf of the \nInvestors amounts to the illegal practice of maintenance, that is, an unconnected \nperson lending assistance (eg, financial support) to the real aggrieved parties or \nencouraging them to sue. I will elaborate on this later on in the judgment.\n8 The defendants challenge the factual basis of the plaintiff\u2019s claim by \nasserting that the investments were genuine commercial transactions and not a \nPonzi scheme as alleged by the plaintiff. The defendants say that after the crisis \nof the drop in oil prices, POA and COGI or some of their officers might have \ncommitted fraud that included forgery against the Investors, but that such fraud \n(if any) was perpetrated against not only the Investors but also the defendants.\n9 The defendants joined 68 individuals as third parties in a third-party \naction. Notably, the defendants have a separate case against two of the third \nparties, namely, Joseph Li (\u201cLi\u201d) and Thomas Luong (\u201cLuong\u201d). Luong is a \nHong Kong businessman who was an Investor. Luong introduced the crude oil \ninvestments to Li, a trained accountant and an authorised representative of Luck \nHock Watch Company Limited (\u201cLuck Hock\u201d) and Enoch International \nCompany Limited (\u201cEnoch\u201d). Li personally invested in the scheme and got \nLuck Hock and Enoch to become Investors as well. The defendants\u2019 claim \nagainst Li and Luong is based on the allegation that when the investment failed, \nLi and Luong financially mismanaged CAGOM Canada and POA, and depleted \nthe underlying assets of the crude oil investments, leaving the Investors with \nVersion No 1: 19 Feb 2021 (08:37 hrs)\nPOA Recovery Pte Ltd v Yau Kwok Seng[2021] SGHC 41\n5less than 1% of the principal investment amounts from the crude oil \ninvestments. The defendants further assert that, in order to mask their own \nwrongdoing, Li and Luong became active in galvanising the Investors to take \nremedial action, both in Canada as well as here in Singapore. The other 66 third \nparties were joined in this suit on the ground that they were sales agents \nappointed by AMCs who over-promised or misrepresented the investments to \nthe other Investors. These 66 third parties, like Yau, marketed the investment \nscheme and also invested their own money in the scheme.\n10 It is an undisputed fact that, for the early projects, the Investors were \npaid the agreed 3% quarterly and obtained full capital refunds after the \nexpiration of each project term. By October 2015, three projects had \nsuccessfully exited, meaning that the Investors had received both their capital \nrefunds as well as their guaranteed returns. Five projects had partially exited, \nmeaning that the majority of the Investors for those projects had been paid their \n3% payments and their exit payments in full. But the 2015 trouble in POA and \nCOGI meant that they could no longer continue to pay the Investors, and so \npayments of both the 3% returns and the capital invested could not be made.\n11 In November 2015, officers from POA including one David Crombie \ncame to Singapore to brief the Investors on the situation in Canada, and assure \nthem that the contracts would be performed. David Crombie was the president \nof COGI. He was also the president of POA from 2011 until his resignation in \nMarch 2016.\n12 Unfortunately, COGI\u2019s financial troubles in Canada continued when oil \nprices fell below US$40 per barrel at the end of October 2015. On 26 October \n2015, COGI was forced into receivership when its bank creditor, Alberta \nTreasury Branches, called on COGI\u2019s loan. A Canadian court appointed MNP \nVersion No 1: 19 Feb 2021 (08:37 hrs)\nPOA Recovery Pte Ltd v Yau Kwok Seng[2021] SGHC 41\n6Ltd as the receiver and manager of COGI. David Crombie notified CAG of \nCOGI\u2019s receivership three days later and, according to the defendants\u2019 \nevidence, CAG stopped marketing POA projects immediately. COGI was \nunable to transfer any money to POA. POA was itself enjoined by an order of a \nCanadian court on 27 November 2015 from disposing of its oil and gas leases \nand assets.\n13 The receivers of COGI then applied to put POA under receivership. \nAlarmed, Ms Fong and Tan Choon Hua (\u201cPaul Tan\u201d), the Chief Operating \nOfficer of CAG, went to Canada to instruct lawyers to challenge the application. \nThe COGI receivers failed in their attempt to put POA under receivership, but \nby this time, there were alarms and frantic action in Canada as well as in \nSingapore, Malaysia, and Hong Kong among the Investors and the AMCs in the \nrespective countries. CAGOM Canada successfully took over 99% of POA and \nCOGI was left with 1%. Richard Orman (\u201cRick Orman\u201d) and Paul Tan were \nappointed directors of POA, and they formed a new management team that \nincluded one Greg Busby to manage POA in January 2016. Rick Orman was a \nformer Minister of Energy in Alberta, and the chairman of a listed company, \nWesCan Energy Corp, an oil exploration company.\n14 Sometime in June 2016, the POA management team met the Investors \nin Kuala Lumpur to discuss how the Investors could recover their investments \n\u2014 or as much of them as they could. This led to the formation of the June \nAgreement (\u201cthe June Agreement\u201d) in which the Investors were given shares in \nCAGOM Canada in proportion to the outstanding money due to them under the \ncrude oil investments. In return, the Investors would receive dividends from \nPOA, which was by then 99% owned by CAGOM Canada. It was agreed that \nany disposal of POA\u2019s assets would require the approval of 60% of its \nshareholders. The investors who signed the June Agreement also agreed to forgo \nVersion No 1: 19 Feb 2021 (08:37 hrs)\nPOA Recovery Pte Ltd v Yau Kwok Seng[2021] SGHC 41\n7their rights under the original contracts governing their purchase of crude oil \nfrom POA, and accepted that their recourse would lie in their rights as \nshareholders of CAGOM Canada instead. Since CAGOM Canada was the 99% \nshareholder of POA, profits from POA\u2019s restructuring, if successful, would be \ndistributed as dividends to the signatories pro rata. 85% of the Investors signed \nthe June Agreement. The remaining 15% had their rights held in trust for them. \nThat is not an issue in this action.\n15 In April 2017, the management and control of CAGOM Canada fell to \na new management committee, known as the \u2018Interim Advisory Board\u2019, that \nincluded Yau, Luong, Li, and four other Investors. Li was the chairman. In \nNovember 2017, the members of the Interim Advisory Board were appointed as \nfull directors of CAGOM Canada and formed CAGOM Canada\u2019s \u2018Executive \nBoard\u2019. \n16  At this juncture, I pause from the largely undisputed narrative of the \nstory to elaborate on the nature of CAG\u2019s role in the crude oil investments, \nwhich I will loosely refer to as \u2018the scheme\u2019. As mentioned at [ 3] above, CAG \nwas the exclusive marketing agent for POA and COGI. It sells the investments \nby getting each interested buyer to sign a \u2018Buyer\u2019s Purchase Order\u2019 (\u201cBPO\u201d). \nCAG earns a commission from POA for each BPO it procures for POA. CAG \nalso enlists sub-agents from its AMCs such as \u2018Blessed One\u2019. These agents are \nthemselves Investors who were minded to play a role in marketing the scheme \nso that they too could earn a portion of the commissions that POA paid. Some \nof those Investors, including Luong, Li, Chan Tai Suan and Candice Lee, were \ninvited to POA and COGI installations in Alberta, Canada to see their rigs and \nproduction lines. These witnesses returned satisfied with what they saw, and \npassed on what they had observed not just by word of mouth, but also by \nproducing a video of their trip. All this added to the hype of the scheme. The \nVersion No 1: 19 Feb 2021 (08:37 hrs)\nPOA Recovery Pte Ltd v Yau Kwok Seng[2021] SGHC 41\n8full list of Investors who travelled to Canada at various times can be found in \nAnnex D of Ms Ho\u2019s closing submissions. \n17 One of the allegations made by the plaintiff is that CAG fraudulently \nreceived secret commissions from POA. At the trial, many of the plaintiff\u2019s \nwitnesses complained that they had not been apprised of the fact that CAG\u2019s \ncommissions were deducted upfront from the capital raised from the Investors, \nwith only about 80% of the Investors\u2019 capital going upstream to POA. In my \nview, these allegations are without merit. As the defendants point out, it is both \nlegally and commercially acceptable for sales agents to operate on a commission \nbasis; indeed, the AMCs and sales agents also received commissions for their \nsales of the crude oil investments. In so far as the plaintiff takes issue with \nCAG\u2019s non-disclosure of (a) the quantum of its commissions as well as (b) the \nmode of their distribution, these were both matters that were strictly between \nPOA and CAG. CAG did not have a legal obligation to report either of these \nmatters to the Investors. \n18 I now refer to the Statement of Claim since the action proceeds from \nwhat is pleaded there. The Statement of Claim contains too much evidence, and \nif the plaintiff had just pleaded those facts it intended to prove, its claims would \nhave been clearer. The only clear causes of action are those based on fraud and \nfraudulent misrepresentations. As the plaintiff did not plead that the allegedly \nfraudulent representations constituted terms of a contract between the Investors \nand CAG, the plaintiff has no action in breach of contract.\n19 The plaintiff also pleaded that by the matters set out before paragraph 16 \nof the Statement of Claim, the defendants \u201cstood as fiduciaries and\/or trustees\u201d \nof the Investors \u201cin relation to the Crude Oil Investments, the funds remitted by \nthe [Investors] to the POA Subsidiaries for the Crude Oil Investments, the \nVersion No 1: 19 Feb 2021 (08:37 hrs)\nPOA Recovery Pte Ltd v Yau Kwok Seng[2021] SGHC 41\n9Security Interests and\/or any security in respect of the Crude Oil Investments \nthat were held by CAGOM SG on trust for the [Investors]\u201d. The plaintiff went \non to plead, at paragraph 33.1 of the Statement of Claim, several actions by the \ndefendants which purportedly show that they had \u201cacted fraudulently and\/or in \nbreach of trust and\/or their fiduciary duties\u201d. However, this paragraph is not \nspecific enough since fraud, breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty are all \ndistinct causes of action with different elements. On the whole, I find that the \nplaintiff\u2019s claims for breach of trust and fiduciary duty are not adequately \npleaded. \n20 Furthermore, the plaintiff pleaded most of its causes of action, strangely, \nright at the end, at paragraph 33 of the Statement of Claim, under the heading \n\u2018Liability of the Defendants\u2019. In this way, many causes of action were slipped \nin almost by the way. For example, at paragraph 33.8 the plaintiff pleaded \n\u201cfurther and\/or alternatively, the Defendants breached their duty to the \n[Investors] to take reasonable care to ensure that the Scheme was conducted in \naccordance with the Marketing Representations\u201d. This appears to be a reference \nto the tort of negligence. The plaintiff also pleaded at paragraph 33.3 that the \ndefendants had \u201cwrongfully, and with intent to injure the [Investors] and\/or to \ncause loss to [the Investors] by unlawful means, conspired and combined \ntogether to defraud [the Investors]\u201d. Had the plaintiff wanted to plead \nnegligence and unlawful means conspiracy as causes of action, it ought to have \ndone so clearly at the start. Nonetheless, the case pursued during the trial was \nbased primarily on the defendants\u2019 fraudulent misrepresentations and their \nparticipation in a fraud in tandem with POA and COGI. I will thus focus on \nthese claims in my analysis below. \nVersion No 1: 19 Feb 2021 (08:37 hrs)\nPOA Recovery Pte Ltd v Yau Kwok Seng[2021] SGHC 41\n1021 In a long, rambling Defence, the defendants returned favour to the \nplaintiff by pleading evidence and submissions in their defence. In summary, \ntheir key contentions are as follows:\n(a) the plaintiff has no legal standing to commence this action;\n(b) this action should be struck out for being contrary to public \npolicy;\n(c) the defendants are not parties to any fraud;\n(d) the defendants are not liable for the alleged fraudulent \nmisrepresentations; and\n(e) the Investors entered into valid and proper contracts in a \ncommercial venture that failed.\n22 I now continue with the plaintiff\u2019s case. The plaintiff claims that the \nInvestors were misled by the misrepresentations (set out in paragraphs 13 and \n14 of the Statement of Claim) into signing the contracts to purchase crude oil \nfrom POA. Many of the alleged misrepresentations sound like promotion puffs. \nOne example is found in paragraph 13.1: \u201cCOGI is one of the fastest growing \noil and gas companies in Canada\u201d. Some may be serious representations of fact \nbut have not be proven to be false, such as"}

On 20 July 2020, notice of the show cause order was given to Ms Tay through her counsel, Providence Law Asia LLC.', '5\\u2003In a letter dated 24 July 2020, SCB informed Mr Tay that it had placed restrictions on the following amounts in the SCB accounts he held:', '(a)\\u2003S$8,384.46 in Mr Tay\u2019s account with account number ending in 0666;', '(b)\\u2003US$812.54 in Mr Tay\u2019s account with account number ending in 9603;', '(c)\\u2003S$178,277.70 in Mr Tay\u2019s joint account with Ms Tay, with account number ending in 4885 (the \u201c4885 account\u201d); and', '(d)\\u2003S$10,028.64 in Mr Tay\u2019s joint account with Ms Tay, with account number ending in 4259 (the \u201c4259 account\u201d).', '6\\u2003It appears that it was only after having had sight of SCB\u2019s letter of 24 July 2020 that the appellant realised that only two of the four accounts Mr Tay held with SCB were joint accounts. In fact, two were accounts in Mr Tay\u2019s own name. This was at odds with Mr Tay\u2019s answers to the questionnaire in the examination of judgment debtor process (the \u201cEJD process\u201d), in which he had stated that all four accounts he held with SCB were joint accounts. I note that Mr Tay had also indicated at the EJD hearing on 19 June 2020 that his four accounts with SCB were joint accounts. At any rate, it appears that SCB\u2019s letter of 24 July 2020 has since clarified this inaccuracy.', '7\\u2003The hearing for the garnishee to show cause in SUM 1320 took place before an Assistant Registrar on 20 August 2020. Reply affidavits were filed by both Mr and Ms Tay prior to the hearing. At the hearing, both written and oral submissions were made. Judgment was reserved, and was eventually released on 1 September 2020.'"}

{"casename":"2021_SGHC_52","fact":"'5\\u2003The evidence in the Application was adduced by way of the affidavits of Mr Lim\u2019s children; their assertions therein have not been tested in cross-examination. Unsurprisingly, the children offer dissonant accounts of what occurred, and level multiple scathing allegations at one another. Mr Lim, who would have best known of the precise circumstances surrounding the acquisition of the Property and the subsequent transfers of title to his children, was unable to give evidence as he had passed on as at the time of the Application. I set out in this section what is apparent, to me, to be the actual events that took place. In so far as either party has disputed aspects of these facts in its case, I will explain why the version of events set out herein is to be preferred.', '6\\u2003Mr Lim was the father of eight children. Seven are daughters and the third child, a son. In order of seniority, they are: Ms Lim Geok Eng (\u201cLGE\u201d), the eldest child; Ms Lim Mei Ying (\u201cLMY\u201d); Mr Lim Kwong Yin (\u201cLKY\u201d); Ms Lim Kay Eng (\u201cLKE\u201d); the respondent; Ms Lim Suet Eng (\u201cLSE\u201d); Ms Lim Lan Eng; and the applicant, the youngest child. 1', '7\\u2003Prior to the purchase of the Property in 1976, the family lived in the upper floor of a two-storey shophouse at 8 Jalan Batu #01-07, Singapore 430008 (\u201cthe Shophouse\u201d). The Shophouse had been rented by Mr Lim using his corporate entity, Sin Wah Bee Permanent Wave Saloon (\u201cSWB\u201d), under which he ran a barbershop\/salon business. 2', 'In 2000, Mr Lim, LKY, LSE, the applicant and the respondent purchased the Shophouse under the HDB Tenants Priority Scheme. They held the Shophouse as tenants-in-common in equal shares. 3', '8\\u2003The Property was purchased under a sale and purchase agreement dated 7 November 1975, at a purchase price of $23,500. Completion was in February 1976, at which point the purchase price was fully paid. The Property was registered in Mr Lim\u2019s sole name at the time of purchase. Notably, the parties are in disagreement as to who paid the purchase price; it would appear (for reasons that will be made clear) that it was Mr Lim who paid for the Property.', '9\\u2003Upon completion in 1976, Mr Lim and his wife moved in and lived at the Property. The four younger children (which included the applicant and the respondent) continued residing at the Shophouse; the four elder children, who were married, had their own homes. According to the applicant, \u201c[p]eriodically\u201d and \u201cthrough the years\u201d, the four elder children and their families were allowed to occupy the Property when they required accommodation. 4', '10\\u2003Mr Lim\u2019s wife passed on sometime in March 1981. Around this time, on 1 April 1981, the respondent was registered as a joint owner of the Property (\u201cthe 1981 transfer\u201d). 5', 'This was a gratuitous transfer; the respondent did not pay any consideration to Mr Lim at the time of transfer, albeit it is her case (and the applicant does not dispute) that she subsequently contributed to the upkeep of the Property, and paid for inter alia renovation costs. The parties have not challenged the validity of the transfer, and the relevant documentary evidence (ie, transfer instruments) have been introduced into evidence via the parties\u2019 affidavits.', '11\\u2003The parties have provided diametrically opposed accounts of what the arrangement was at this point in time, and why the 1981 transfer occurred.', '(a)\\u2003According to the applicant, Mr Lim\u2019s elder children arranged to relocate him from the Property to the Shophouse, so that the children would be better able to look after his needs. He was grieving over the loss of his wife and was on the verge of retirement. Mr Lim thereon resided primarily at the Shophouse. 6', 'The 1981 transfer was part of the arrangement to move Mr Lim to the Shophouse. It was done in order to allow the respondent to \u201chelp [Mr Lim] administratively to look after and manage [Mr Lim\u2019s] ownership \u2026 in the Property\u201d. It was also to \u201c[safeguard] \u2026 the sole ownership interest of [Mr Lim] in the Property from being exposed to any risk of re-possession by HDB\u201d. 7', 'Mr Lim feared that HDB would re-possess the Property if \u201cas its sole owner, he was found not to be in personal use and occupation of the Property\u201d. 8', 'To address this concern, at or around the time of the 1981 transfer, the respondent and LSE (ie, the sixth child of Mr Lim) moved into the Property. Further, according to the applicant, the respondent was the only one of Mr Lim\u2019s children who met the eligibility requirements under prevailing HDB regulations. 9', 'The other children were either ineligible or were unable to help Mr Lim to look after the Property. This was why the respondent, and not the other children, was registered as joint owner of the Property.', '(b)\\u2003The respondent provides a rather different account. She claims that Mr Lim never moved out of the Property, and that they resided together at the Property from 1981 onwards. The 1981 transfer was in recognition of this arrangement, as well as the fact that the respondent contributed to the purchase price\/upkeep of the Property.', '12\\u2003Two decades later, in 2001, Mr Lim arranged for the applicant\u2019s name to be added to the Property as another joint owner (\u201cthe 2001 transfer\u201d). This, again, was a gratuitous transfer. 10', 'According to the applicant, the 2001 transfer was on \u201ca similar understanding as the [1981 transfer]\u201d, meaning it was for the applicant to assist Mr Lim in managing and looking after the Property. 11', 'The respondent has not given evidence explaining the circumstances behind the 2001 transfer. Then, on 6 September 2013, the applicant removed her name from the Property \u201cin order to be eligible to purchase another HDB flat\u201d. 12', 'A corresponding change was reflected on the title deed of the Property, and the relevant transfer instruments were lodged in January 2014 (\u201cthe 2014 transfer\u201d). 13', '13\\u2003The applicant accepts (consistent with the respondent\u2019s evidence) that in 2013 or 2014, Mr Lim resided at the Property permanently. This was in the light of the impending sale of the Shophouse (see [15] below). Following this, in August 2014, the respondent moved out of the Property, and left for the United Kingdom. 14', 'At or around this time, the applicant and LKY moved into the Property to live with Mr Lim. 15', '14\\u2003According to the applicant, in 2014, after the respondent moved out of the Property, Mr Lim \u201crepeatedly informed family members that he wanted [the respondent\u2019s] name removed from the Property\u201d. 16', 'Despite Mr Lim\u2019s (and his children\u2019s) attempts to seek the applicant\u2019s cooperation on this matter, the respondent did not comply. She first informed LKY, in an alleged telephone conversation in November 2014, that she could not attend to the matter as she was living in the suburbs in the United Kingdom, and it was inconvenient for her to travel. Thereafter, she was allegedly uncontactable and\/or unresponsive on the issue. 17', 'In the round, the respondent\u2019s name was never removed from the property register, and she remained a co-owner of the Property. These were the first signs of disquiet in the Lim family. Unfortunately, they were not the last.', '15\\u2003The present dispute was preceded by another fractious event. As noted, Mr Lim had plans to sell the Shophouse sometime in 2013 or 2014. Sale of the Shophouse was completed in December 2014. During this period, a dispute surfaced between Mr Lim, LKY, LSE, the applicant and the respondent over the apportionment and distribution of the sale proceeds of the Shophouse. 18', 'As such, upon sale in December 2014, the proceeds of the sale of the Shophouse were held by conveyancing solicitors. It was only in 2018 that HC\/OS 1555\/2018 was filed, and following a mediation that took place in 2019, the dispute was resolved and the proceeds were apportioned and distributed.', '16\\u2003In the midst of the dispute over the Shophouse, the present dispute began taking root. Prior to his passing on 4 September 2015, Mr Lim executed a will on 27 April 2015 (\u201cthe Will\u201d). Under the Will, the applicant was named as the sole executrix. Mr Lim also bequeathed his share in the Property to LKY. After Mr Lim passed on, Grant of Probate was obtained on 21 November 2016 in FC\/P 4350\/2016. The applicant, in line with the Will, was appointed as sole executrix.', '17\\u2003The applicant furnished the respondent with copies of the Grant of Probate and the Will on 1 October 2017. She also provided the respondent with documentation to be used for the removal of the respondent\u2019s name from the property register.', '18\\u2003Then, on 3 October 2017, the respondent filed the Notice of Death of Mr Lim over the Property, for the Property to be transferred under her sole name as the surviving joint tenant. 19', 'The HDB records indicate the respondent to be the sole owner of the Property from that date. 20', 'Thereafter, according to the applicant, sometime in November 2017, the respondent instructed a real estate agent to \u201ctake steps to prevent use and occupation of the Property by LKY and LMY\u201d. 21', '19\\u2003The Notice of Death filed by the respondent was discovered by the applicant in February 2019, who then lodged a caveat against the Property on 26 March 2019. What followed was a series of letters exchanged between the parties via their solicitors. On 3 May 2019, the respondent\u2019s solicitors wrote to the applicant, demanding withdrawal of the caveat on grounds that it was without legal basis. They threatened legal action against the applicant for wrongful lodgement of the caveat. On 16 May 2019, the applicant\u2019s solicitors responded, maintaining that the caveat was not wrongful, and reiterating the Estate\u2019s claim over the beneficial ownership in the Property.', '20\\u2003Following this, on 6 February 2020, the applicant filed the Application.'"}

Lison (\u201cLison\u201d) on 12 August 2020 (\u201cLison\u2019s second affidavit\u201d). Lison\u2019s second affidavit detailed the defendants\u2019 breaches as set out at [9] and [10] above as well as the facts and reasons that led to the Committal Application being filed.', '12\\u2003I should state at this juncture that the plaintiff\u2019s claims against ECPL, VXT and D&N were inter alia for unlawful conspiracy alleging that the three defendants chartered the plaintiff\u2019s vessel, the motor tanker Christina (\u201cthe vessel\u201d), to smuggle cargo in particular gasoil, into Vietnam. As a result, the vessel was implicated in a criminal act under Vietnamese law. The vessel was detained in Vietnam for three years from 30 January 2016 to 28 January 2019 causing loss and damage to the plaintiff of at least USD10m. In fact, the vessel\u2019s master was prosecuted and convicted of giving false information in the cargo import declaration form that was prepared by ECPL\u2019s local shipping agent. The plaintiff contended that the master was duped into signing the aforesaid form.', '13\\u2003The plaintiff\u2019s claim against Dinh was on the basis that she held funds and assets that in truth and in fact belonged to the other three defendants or any of them. The plaintiff therefore sought inter alia a declaration against her that all her assets or a substantial part thereof are liable to execution by the plaintiff if it succeeds in its claim against VXT.', '14\\u2003In the course of the criminal proceedings in Vietnam, a Vietnamese court had issued a decision on 21 December 2018 detailing how a Vietnamese company called Duong Dong Hoa Phu Joint Stock Company (\u201cDDHP\u201d) had been smuggling gasoline from foreign companies like ECPL and D&N into Vietnam from October 2015 to January 2016 and had paid D&N approximately USD9m for the smuggled gasoil. In this regard, the ex-general manager of DDHP (\u201cthe ex-GM\u201d) had been convicted and imprisoned for his role in the smuggling operation. The ex-GM had admitted that for cargo declared to the Vietnamese customs authorities, payment by DDHP to D&N would be by letters of credit and bank transfers but for cargo that was not so declared but smuggled into Vietnam, DDHP would pay D&N in cash.', '15\\u2003Because of what the ex-GM revealed, the plaintiff sought discovery from ECPL, VXT and D&N of all their correspondence with DDHP and their payment records. The plaintiff discovered that the few documents provided to the plaintiff by VXT were discrepant with payments received by VXT, ECPL and D&N from DDHP for the gasoil sold to DDHP.', '16\\u2003It was the plaintiff\u2019s case that the dealings between the first to third defendants and DDHP were neither arm\u2019s length nor bona fide and that their contracts with DDHP were sham documents intended to conceal the smuggling.', '17\\u2003Consequently, the plaintiff mounted a rigorous specific discovery process against the first three defendants (essentially against VXT as the alter ego of the two corporate entities) for documents and details of contract amendments and discussions between the three defendants and DDHP that would explain the true nature of their dealings and the discrepancies in the payments.', '18\\u2003However, VXT continued to be evasive and obstructive when it came to the further discovery sought despite two court orders that required the first three defendants to disclose their handphones, computer hard drives and email accounts for forensic examination. According to the plaintiff, the first three defendants went to great lengths and concocted (through VXT) the most absurd excuses to avoid giving disclosure.', '19\\u2003As the various defendants\u2019 unconvincing responses were one of the reasons that prompted this court to grant the Committal Application, it would be appropriate at this stage to look at some of the reasons\/excuses that VXT (and subsequently Dinh) gave for not complying with the defendants\u2019 discovery obligations:', '(a)\\u2003To avoid giving discovery of his computer hard drives, VXT claimed that he does not use a computer to run his multi-million dollar business. Instead, he claimed that he \u201coutsources\u201d even basic office functions such as printing and typing; 1', '(b)\\u2003When he was ordered to provide details of his outsourcing arrangements, VXT claimed there were none as everything was done verbally \u2013 he had engaged a foreign student called Jason to do the typing and printing and that person had (conveniently) left Singapore;', '(c)\\u2003To avoid giving discovery of his handphone, VXT claimed it was damaged and hence discarded;', '(d)\\u2003To avoid giving disclosure of his email databases, VXT claimed that he had forgotten the passwords to most of his accounts. There were two email accounts that were eventually disclosed and examined by the plaintiff\u2019s computer experts. The experts found no \u201chits\u201d when they looked for emails between VXT and DDHP. VXT claimed that the five emails or so that were disclosed represented the entirety of his exchanges with DDHP as the rest of their communication was verbal and that was the reason why there were no \u201chits\u201d in his email accounts as he had deleted the emails after disclosing them to the plaintiff;', '(e)\\u2003To avoid giving discovery of ECPL\u2019s and D&N\u2019s accounting ledgers, records, books, journals, receipts and invoices relating to the DDHP sales contracts, VXT claimed that he did not retain any such records and depended\/relied upon bank statements as his records. The bank statements were listed in VXT\u2019s 18th affidavit filed jointly with Dinh on 15 June 2020 (\u201cVXT\u2019s 18th affidavit\u201d). However, as ECPL is registered with ACRA and at the material time was a GST-registered business, the plaintiff submitted it must comply with the tax authorities\u2019 e-Tax Guide which requires records to be kept of all business transactions. Consequently, VXT\u2019s excuse for not providing discovery was not bona fide.', '(f)\\u2003To avoid giving discovery of D&N\u2019s OCBC account that was specifically mentioned in the sales contracts, ie, OCBC Account No. ending 7301, VXT claimed that he had reached agreement with DDHP to make payments into the account of ECPL. When the plaintiff finally received the bank statements of D&N directly from OCBC, the plaintiff discovered that in January 2016 alone, D&N received six payments totalling USD1,221,757.00 from unidentified sources.', '20\\u2003In regard to [19(f)] above, VXT subsequently changed his tune and claimed that initially, the vendor of the gasoil was D&N, hence DDHP paid the deposit to D&N. However, the vendor was later changed to ECPL and hence payments from DDHP were transferred from D&N to ECPL\u2019s bank account.', '21\\u2003Contrary to his earlier stance in [19(e)] that he had no records, VXT was later able to recall and set out in his 20th affidavit filed on 11 September 2020 (\u201cVXT\u2019s 20th affidavit\u201d) 2', 'other parties who paid ECPL for petrol purchased from D&N.', '22\\u2003The plaintiff further alleged that both VXT and Dinh failed to comply with their disclosure obligations under the First and Second Mareva Orders (see [4] above).', '23\\u2003In the case of VXT, the plaintiff asserted that he breached the First Discovery Order by falsely claiming that D&N\u2019s OCBC Account No. ending 7301 did not fall within the ambit of the order despite the clear wording. The plaintiff was prompted to obtain the Third Discovery Order before it was able to obtain directly from OCBC the account statements of the said OCBC account. The account statements of the said OCBC account revealed 156 transactions with deposits totalling around USD76m in value while withdrawals amounted to around USD54m. VXT claims that those transactions were \u2018unrecorded\u2019 while there were another 58 transactions that he \u2018could not recall\u2019.', '24\\u2003The bank statements that VXT originally disclosed were primarily loan servicing or \u201cconduit\u201d accounts through which large sums were deposited for 1\u20132 days and then withdrawn leaving a small balance on each occasion. The plaintiff applied for discovery contending that VXT and\/or ECPL and D&N had not disclosed bank accounts where they kept their income or savings.', '25\\u2003VXT claimed that he, ECPL and D&N have no or negligible assets. This claim did not sit well with the fact that VXT had declared that his personal\/household expenses exceeded SGD25,000.00 a month. 3', 'Realising his error subsequently, VXT then did a volte face and claimed that his\/household expenses were paid by his wife Dinh. He deposed in his 11th affidavit filed on 24 March 2019 (\u201cVXT\u2019s 11th affidavit\u201d) 4', 'that he sold off his shares in TUTP Pte Ltd and his 1% interest in the couple\u2019s matrimonial home at 33 Leonie Hill Road (\u201cthe Leonie Hill property\u201d) to Dinh for SGD103,000.00 allegedly in order to pay off his debts.', '26\\u2003It was VXT\u2019s above actions that prompted the plaintiff to add Dinh to these proceedings as the Fourth defendant and thereafter to apply for and obtain the Second Mareva Order against her.', '27\\u2003VXT\u2019s breaches were blatant. Despite selling his two assets listed in [25] to Dinh, VXT denied that he had breached the First Mareva Order, claiming that he did it as he was in financial trouble.', '28\\u2003In his 12th affidavit filed on 29 May 2019, he deposed to what has been set out at [19(d)] above. He did not deny that he had deleted emails between the first to third defendants and DDHP as the plaintiff alleged. He claimed that he deleted those emails because he had already forwarded those messages to his part-time assistant Emily and he knew she would have a soft copy thereafter.', '29\\u2003VXT disclosed that ECPL held five bank accounts in Singapore (with UOB, OCBC and DBS) none of which had balances that exceeded USD5,000.00. He himself only had an account with UOB, ie, UOB Account No. ending 5135, which had a credit balance of SGD16,951.86. VXT disclosed that a sum of SGD16,251.68 in this account belongs to ECPL. This sum had been remitted to his personal account by Food Republic Pte Ltd, the food court operator for the stall that he operated. He blamed the First Mareva Order as the cause for his not being able to continue running the stall. VXT added that he has a joint OCBC Account No. ending 2001 with Dinh which had a balance of SGD9,385.00.', '30\\u2003It was only in VXT\u2019s 18th affidavit that he finally decided to comply with the terms of the discovery order made against him and filed his supplemental list of documents. In Schedule 1 therein, he listed Dinh\u2019s bank statements with Eximbank for 2013\u20132018 together with the bank statements of ECPL\u2019s accounts with UOB, DBS and OCBC.', '31\\u2003Initially, after the plaintiff obtained the Second Mareva Order, Dinh went to great lengths to claim that she was a woman of substance\/wealth who could afford to maintain her family and VXT in style. Her claims included having her own business with Vietnamese associates who paid her large amounts in cash which were hand-carried to Singapore and hence not reflected in her bank statements.', '32\\u2003In Dinh\u2019s first affidavit filed on 22 April 2019 to set aside the Second Mareva Order (\u201cthe setting aside affidavit\u201d), she had inter alia deposed that:', '(a)\\u2003She had owned 99% of the Leonie Hill property since she purchased it in 2016. She paid SGD549,726.00 for the Leonie Hill property from her life savings, gifts from relatives, a bank housing loan and using her CPF savings. She alone serviced the housing loan instalments;', '(b)\\u2003She bought over VXT\u2019s 1% interest in the Leonie Hill property as well as his shares in TUTP Pte Ltd in cash as he was in financial difficulties. The price she paid for his shares of SGD94,000.00 approximated the net book value of the company based on its balance sheets. However, she allowed him to continue running the company;', '(c)\\u2003To avoid the need to re-execute a fresh mortgage for the lending bank\u2019s housing loan, she did not disclose to the lender the 1% interest in the Leonie Hill property that she purchased from VXT and neither was her purchase told to the Singapore Land Authority (\u201cSLA\u201d) nor was it reflected in their records.', '33\\u2003In her second affidavit filed on 14 May 2019 in response to the plaintiff\u2019s affidavit of Jesper Harum filed on 6 May 2019, Dinh claimed 5', 'that she is a university graduate and has income not only from her businesses in Singapore but also from ad hoc projects with her partners in Vietnam. Her partners would bring to Singapore her share of the profits in cash. She also has rich relatives in Vietnam who are very generous with her and similarly gave her cash as gifts.', '34\\u2003Dinh deposed that she was able to lend at least USD200,000.00 to ECPL on 5 January 2016 at the beginning of ECPL\u2019s transactions with DDHP.', '35\\u2003She disclosed 6', 'that she had sold her shares in TUTP Pte Ltd on 19 March 2019 to one Le Ba Ngoc as the company was suffering losses and was paid the proceeds in Vietnam. The sale was after the First Mareva Order was granted (on 15 March 2019).', '36\\u2003In her 7th affidavit filed on 17 June 2019 in support of her application for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal (against this court\u2019s refusal to set aside the Second Mareva Order), Dinh deposed 7', 'that she had found a bank statement that showed that she received SGD370,000.00 on 5 October 2016 from a business partner in Vietnam that enabled her to make the lump sum payment for the Leonie Hill property. This fact is not relevant to the issue of VXT\u2019s purported transfer of his interest in the Leonie Hill property to her in breach of the First Mareva Order.', '37\\u2003In her application under Summons No 5069 of 2019 to vary the Second Mareva Order (that the Order be limited to VXT\u2019s 1% interest in the Leonie Hill property and to his shares in TUTP Pte Ltd), Dinh filed her 8th affidavit on 8 October 2019 (\u201cDinh\u2019s 8th affidavit) in which she deposed that she received at least SGD326,345.00 on or about 15 April 2016 from her sale of a previous flat she owned at Dunman Road. Again, this fact is irrelevant to the issue of VXT\u2019s breach of the First Mareva Order by attempting to transfer his assets to Dinh.', '38\\u2003For the first time in Dinh\u2019s 8th affidavit, 8', 'she deposed that her mother Hoang Thi Cham (\u201cthe Mother\u201d) was paying the monthly mortgage instalments and household expenses as she was not doing well.', '39\\u2003The plaintiff subsequently applied in Summons No 5267 of 2019 (\u201cSummons 5267\u201d) on 22 October 2019 for a discovery order against all four defendants in aid of the two Mareva Orders. The plaintiff wanted discovery from Dinh of all her income\/funds, her income sources, details of all her businesses, her accounts with OCBC, UOB and Exim Bank etc. It was a very comprehensive discovery request.', '40\\u2003On 15 November 2019, Dinh filed her 9th affidavit in response to Summons 5267 where she inter alia deposed 9', 'that:', '(a)\\u2003her employer (TPDN where she is a director since 2017) does not pay her a salary but only her CPF contributions;', '(b)\\u2003she no longer had businesses in Vietnam and had closed her Vietnamese bank account;', '(c)\\u2003she did not keep track of money she received from her rich relatives;', '(d)\\u2003the source of money for her expenses was\/is the Mother. Before the Second Mareva Order, the Mother would pass the money to her. After the Second Mareva Order, the Mother paid the expenses directly or passed the money to Dinh\u2019s children, niece and nephew;', '(e)\\u2003she had already given discovery to the plaintiff of her bank account(s);', '(f)\\u2003she did not have a safe deposit box;', '(g)\\u2003she had given discovery of her income tax returns;', '(h)\\u2003she would not give discovery of her CPF account as the money therein belongs to her and cannot be seized by her creditors;', '(i)\\u2003her company TPDN is dormant and has no bank account\/statements;', '(j)\\u2003she does not own shares and hence does not have a Central Depository (\u201cCDP\u201d) account;', '(k)\\u2003she has no rental income and does not own credit cards;', '(l)\\u2003it was the Mother who paid the plaintiff the costs of SGD6484.40 ordered against her after the Second Mareva Order took effect.', '41\\u2003It is noteworthy that when she was faced with Summons 5267 (see [39] above), Dinh suddenly became impecunious overnight and the Mother became the financier of her family\u2019s household expenses and housing loan.', '42\\u2003In VXT\u2019s 20th affidavit, he had deposed 10', 'that he was unable to furnish more details of D&N\u2019s payments from unidentified sources or unrecorded transactions because they were not inter-company transactions. In his earlier affidavit filed on 13 June 2018, 11', 'VXT deposed in regard to the discrepancies the plaintiff had noted between payment records and proforma invoices, that sometimes DDHP paid less than the amounts in the proforma invoices. Because of the shortfall in payments, he claimed that DDHP still owed money to the first three defendants.', '43\\u2003VXT added (in VXT\u2019s 20th affidavit) that he was unable to provide his CPF statements which were more than 15 months old as the CPF system did not allow for such earlier retrieval. Both VXT and the Fourth defendant initially took the position (presumably on legal advice) that they were not obliged to disclose their CPF balances as the law stipulated that their CPF funds were not available for satisfaction of judgment creditors\u2019 claims.', '44\\u2003At the hearing on 23 October 2020 (\u201cthe first hearing\u201d), counsel for the plaintiff (\u201cMr Yap\u201d) informed the court 12', 'that contrary to what VXT claimed in VXT\u2019s 20th affidavit, he had applied online to obtain his own CPF statements for a ten year period and he encountered no difficulties in retrieving his CPF statements for the years going back to 2010. Hence, Mr Yap submitted that VXT and Dinh both lied in their respective affidavits filed on 11 September 2020.', \"45\\u2003Mr Yap\u2019s action in [44] as well as the contents in Lison\u2019s second affidavit (which set out VXT's and Dinh\u2019s breaches of the various orders of court) galvanised VXT and Dinh into action. The couple hastily filed a joint affidavit on 26 October 2020 (before the second hearing the following day) where they deposed that they were indeed able to retrieve their CPF statements (which they exhibited) for the years 2016 to 2019. VXT added that although he had sold his 1% interest in the Leonie Hill property to Dinh, he nevertheless continued to allow his CPF contributions to be used to service the housing loan. VXT treated it as an advance to Dinh, knowing that his CPF contributions would be refunded to him when the Leonie Hill property is sold. VXT and Dinh concluded the joint affidavit on 26 October 2020 by stating in paragraph 8:\", '46\\u2003Mr Yap submitted that VXT had been lying in all his previous affidavits where he said that no payments were ever made into D&N\u2019s bank account by DDHP. In VXT\u2019s 11th affidavit, he had stated at paragraph 13:', 'Mr Yap pointed out that the OCBC bank statements of D&N that the plaintiff obtained directly from the company\u2019s bankers 13', 'showed \u201cstaggering amounts\u201d withdrawn including USD290,000.00 and USD300,000.00 on 4 and 11 January 2016 respectively. In a joint affidavit filed on 25 June 2020, VXT and Dinh had deposed that the aforesaid two sums were deposited into ECPL\u2019s bank account. While there appeared to be corresponding deposits into ECPL\u2019s DBS Account No. ending 5022, 14', 'VXT and Dinh deposed that those deposits into ECPL\u2019s account were from DDHP and not D&N. When the plaintiff pointed out this inconsistency in Lison\u2019s second affidavit, 15', 'VXT deposed 16', 'in VXT\u2019s 20th affidavit that payments by DDHP were made into D&N\u2019s bank account, before being transferred to ECPL\u2019s bank account. In so deposing, VXT contradicted his original statement in VXT\u2019s 11th affidavit that all payments by DDHP went into ECPL\u2019s bank account (see also [19(f)] and [20] above).', '47\\u2003Indeed, the plaintiff\u2019s skeletal submissions 17', 'pointed out that more than USD250m flowed through just three (out of 21) bank accounts which VXT operates\/operated from 2016 to 2019 namely ECPL\u2019s DBS Account No. ending 5022, D&N\u2019s OCBC Account No. ending 7301 and TUTP\u2019s DBS Account No. ending 6022.', '48\\u2003In Lison\u2019s affidavit filed on 8 October 2020 (\u201cLison\u2019s third affidavit\u201d), he had exhibited VXT\u2019s tax returns for the Year of Assessment 2017. 18', 'It was noted therefrom that VXT earned SGD166,000.00 in 2016. VXT had initially resisted producing his 2020 tax returns but did so after the plaintiff filed the Committal Application. His tax returns for 2018 19', 'showed that he earned SGD156,000.00 in 2017 whilst his 2020 tax returns 20', 'showed that he earned SGD99,393.00 in 2019. Yet, throughout his affidavits, VXT claimed to be \u201cimpecunious\u201d. Moreover, the living\/household expenses of VXT and the Fourth defendant were inconsistent with his professed impecuniosity. Indeed, the expenses served to support the plaintiff\u2019s contention that VXT had failed to disclose hidden sources of income.', '49\\u2003In VXT\u2019s 20th affidavit, he further deposed 21', 'that he had been employed by a Vietnamese company called Investment Mining Port Joint Stock Company (\u201cIMPJSC\u201d) since 1 May 2019 but of his salary of SGD8,000.00, he was only paid his CPF contributions of SGD2,220.00 and not the difference of SGD5,780.00. VXT claimed that it was due to the fact that he had not been able to develop the businesses of IMPJSC or find investors for them in port management, mining and manufacturing of gloves. He deposed that he expected to be paid his outstanding salary once he concluded a \u2018deal\u2019 for his employer with a Malaysian glove manufacturer.', '50\\u2003In the same vein, the Fourth defendant deposed 22', 'that her employer (between 1 July 2019 and May 2020) a shipping company called Vietnam Gas and Chemicals Transportation Corporation, did not pay her monthly salary of SGD6,000.00 but only her CPF contributions of SGD2,220.00 each month using AXS machines.', '51\\u2003Similarly, Dinh refused to produce her 2020 tax returns before the Committal Application was filed.

If the plaintiff fails to reject the vessel within those 48 hours, it is deemed by Art 7.3.4 of the Contract to have accepted the vessel. 39', '61\\u2003Finally, Art 20 of the Contract provides that it is governed by Singapore law and that disputes arising out of or in connection with the Contract shall be referred to and resolved finally by arbitration in Singapore at the SIAC. 40', '62\\u2003In December 2012, the parties varied the Contract by entering into the first of four supplemental agreements. 41', 'The terms of this first supplemental agreement are not relevant for present purposes.', '63\\u2003The defendants failed to deliver the vessel by the Delivery Date, ie 31 May 2014.

It also denies that the vessel was ready for delivery in December 2014. 44', '67\\u2003In February 2015, the parties entered into a second supplemental agreement (\u201cSA2\u201d). 45', 'SA2 amended the Contract to achieve two purposes.

The significance of the Cancelling Date is that Art 12 of SA2 52', 'provides that, if the defendants fail to deliver the vessel by the Cancelling Date, the plaintiff is entitled either to: (i) reject the vessel and terminate the Contract; or (ii) accept delivery of the vessel and claim liquidated damages at the rate of US$50,000 per day from the Cancelling Date to the date of actual delivery, capped at US$5m.', '72\\u2003Third, Art 3 of SA2 53', 'provides that Annex I of SA2 supersedes, amongst others, Annexes I and III of the Contract (see [54] above). In exchange, the plaintiff agrees to pay the defendants a US$10.46m \u201cModification Fee\u201d for all of the work done or to be done on the vessel to upgrade its specifications to meet those set out in Annex I of SA2. Article 3 of SA2 also obliges the defendants \u201cto comply with all technical requirements based on [Annex I of SA2], in accordance with the Classification Society\u2019s [ie the ABS\u2019s] rules and regulations\u201d.', '73\\u2003Fourth, Art 6 of SA2 54', 'supplements the inspection plan under Art 5 of the Contract (see [59] above). Article 6 of SA2 obliges the defendants: (i) to permit the End-Buyer\u2019s inspection agency, ModuSpec, to inspect and test the vessel in the course of construction; and (ii) to remedy and rectify any non-conformity that ModuSpec may discover and convey to the defendants through the plaintiff. 55', '74\\u2003Fifth, Art 15 of SA2 56', 'varies the \u201cPermissible Delay\u201d provisions in cl 9.3 of the Contract. 57', 'Article 15 provides that, if the defendants fail to deliver the vessel by the 30 April 2015, but the failure is caused by the defendants\u2019 efforts to remedy or rectify non-conformities raised by the End-Buyer or by ModuSpec before 15 April 2015, that delay is a \u201cPermissible Delay\u201d. If, but only if, the defendants give notice of Permissible Delay to the plaintiff, the plaintiff is obliged to extend both the Delivery Date and the Cancelling Date for the period of the Permissible Delay, but no further than a long-stop date of 15 July 2015.', '75\\u2003Finally, SA2 deals expressly with the protection of the vessel\u2019s generators from the ingress of water. The international standard for the protection of electrical and electronic equipment (such as the generators) from the ingress of water and foreign objects is an \u201cIP\u201d rating. \u201cIP\u201d stands for \u201cIngress Protection\u201d. 58', 'The higher the IP rating, the higher the degree of protection which is required in order to earn that rating. 59', 'As mentioned (at [58] above), the Contract did not expressly specify an IP rating for the generators. It merely obliged the defendants in general terms to comply with the regulatory requirements of the ABS as to ingress protection for generators. Section 15.2 of the SA2 Technical Agreement now expressly requires the generators to \u201cgenerally\u201d be \u201cWaterproof grade IP44\u201d. 60', 'But the SA2 Minutes of Negotiations (like the Contract) are silent on the IP rating of the generators. The SA2 Minutes of Negotiations merely oblige the defendants in general terms to submit to the plaintiff documents about the \u201cIP grade of the generator, which shall meet the requirement of Construction Specification and Classification\u201d. 61', '76\\u2003The effect of SA2 was not only to extend the Delivery Date from 31 May 2014 to 30 April 2015 but also to give the defendants a further two-month grace period, after 30 April 2015 and up to the Cancelling Date, within which they would face no contractual consequence for having failed to deliver the vessel by 30 April 2015. But if the defendants failed to deliver the vessel by the Cancelling Date, and the plaintiff elected not to terminate the contract, SA2 gave the plaintiff the right to recover liquidated damages from the defendants starting from the Cancelling Date up to the date of actual delivery, subject to the cap of US$5m.', '77\\u2003Following SA2, but also in February 2015, the plaintiff entered into a contract with the End-Buyer to sell the vessel to the End-Buyer. 62', '78\\u2003In April 2015, the parties entered into a third supplemental agreement. 63', 'The terms of this supplemental agreement are not relevant for present purposes.', '79\\u2003In late April 2015, the End-Buyer informed the plaintiff that the generators already installed in the vessel did not conform to the End-Buyer\u2019s specifications for protection against the ingress of water because they were rated IP23 instead of IP44. The plaintiff duly informed the defendants of the non-conformity. 64', 'The defendants informed the plaintiff that it would take 11 months to upgrade the generators from IP23 to IP44. 65', '80\\u2003The defendants proved unable to deliver the vessel by the Delivery Date of 30 April 2015 or even by the Cancelling Date of 30 June 2015. 66', 'On 1 July 2015, the plaintiff put the defendants on notice in writing that the defendants had: (i) failed to deliver the vessel in accordance with Art 8 of SA2; and (ii) failed to give notice of Permissible Delay under Art 15 of SA2. 67', 'But the plaintiff did not exercise its right under SA2 to terminate the Contract. It chose to keep the Contract on foot.', '81\\u2003On 2 July 2015 and 1 September 2015, the ABS issued two interim class certificates for the vessel. 68', 'A class certificate is a certificate from the ABS confirming that the vessel complies with ABS standards for vessels of that particular class. These two class certificates were interim because the ABS was unable to certify a particular component of the vessel as a result of the plaintiff\u2019s failure to provide required information on Owner Furnished Equipment (\u201cOFE\u201d). 69', '82\\u2003Between 3 July 2015 and 17 July 2015, ModuSpec carried out an inspection of the vessel. As a result of the inspection, ModuSpec raised a list of non-conformities for the defendants to remedy. 70', 'The defendants duly set about remedying them.', '83\\u2003On 12 September 2015, the parties entered into a fourth supplemental agreement (\u201cSA4\u201d). SA4 contains two provisions which are relevant for present purposes.', '84\\u2003First, Art 3 71', 'extends the Delivery Date (as already extended by Art 8 of SA2) to \u201con or around 21 September 2015, but in no case later than 23 September 2015\u201d. 72', '85\\u2003Second, Art 4 of SA4 fixes technical acceptance of the vessel for 12 September 2015. 73', 'As a result, Art 4 also provides that \u201c\u2026 the calculation of all Liquidated Damages payable from one Party to the other under the terms and conditions of the [Contract], including but not limited to Art 12 of [SA2], shall cease on 11 September 2015\u201d.', '86\\u2003Although SA4 expressly extended the Delivery Date, it is silent about any extension of the Cancelling Date. The significance of the Cancelling Date is that it is the starting date for calculating liquidated damages under Art 12 of SA2.', '87\\u2003Subject to the terms of SA4, the plaintiff allowed the Contract to remain on foot and allowed the defendants to work towards delivering the vessel under the Contract as varied by the supplemental agreements.', '88\\u2003The defendants delivered the vessel to the plaintiff on 22 September 2015, one day before the long stop date in SA4 (see [84] above). The plaintiff duly accepted the vessel and made full payment of the final instalment due under the Contract, of the Modification Fee and of all other payments due under SA2. 74', 'The plaintiff also delivered the vessel to the End-Buyer on the same day. 75'"}

Mr Xu faces one charge of criminal defamation under s 500 of the Penal Code. Both claimed trial, which commenced in November 2019.

For present purposes, three interlocutory applications may be noted.', '3\\u2003The first is Mr Augustin\u2019s application made to District Judge Christopher Tan (\u201cDJ Tan\u201d) for the disclosure of his s 22 CPC statements. This was dismissed on three grounds. First, disclosure was not mandated by statute since the parties had opted not to proceed under the statutory criminal case disclosure regime. Second, disclosure was not mandated by the common law either. The disclosure obligations in Muhammad bin Kadar v Public Prosecutor [2011] 3 SLR 1205 (\u201cKadar\u201d) require the disclosure of \u201cunused material\u201d that was thought to be prima facie credible and relevant to the guilt or innocence of the accused. DJ Tan took the view that the statements did not come within the definition of \u201cunused\u201d material. Since the applicants had not yet testified in court, it was uncertain whether the Prosecution might eventually use the statements to cross-examine or impeach the testimony of the applicants or possibly even of other witnesses. DJ Tan considered that in such circumstances, where it was not yet certain that the statement would not be used, it could not be regarded as part of the unused material to which the Kadar disclosure obligations applied. The Defence had also, in DJ Tan\u2019s view, failed to establish how the statements could have helped to strengthen the case for innocence or undermine the case for guilt. The Defence on the other hand contended that such disclosure would ensure \u201cregularity\u201d and prevent any \u201cdisparity\u201d between the testimony given on the stand and the position reflected in the recorded statements. As to this, DJ Tan took the view that those were not the objectives of the disclosure contemplated in Kadar.', '4\\u2003The second and third applications, respectively brought by Mr Augustin and Mr Xu, were made at the same time and sought the same disclosure of the s 22 CPC statements. These applications were heard by District Judge Ng Peng Hong (\u201cDJ Ng\u201d), who adopted DJ Tan\u2019s reasoning and dismissed these applications as well.', '5\\u2003Following this dismissal, the applicants brought the present criminal motions seeking the disclosure of their s 22 CPC statements.'"}

The Debtors made a proposal for a joint voluntary arrangement on 10 November 2017. 3', 'Apart from seeking to avoid bankruptcy, they hoped to achieve a higher recovery for their creditors than under a bankruptcy scenario, prevent a scramble for assets and maintain Mr Mangat\u2019s chartered accountant licence. A key part of the proposal was to sell the Property by 31 December 2018. They anticipated a sale price of $25 million that would allow for a surplus of about $8 million for the unsecured creditors. 4', '9\\u2003OCBC was naturally looking to its security in the Property. By a letter dated 13 March 2018, OCBC notified the Debtors that it would proceed with a writ of possession unless the Debtors adhered to the repayment schedule. 5', 'The repayment schedule had been set out in a letter dated 1 February 2018. 6', '10\\u2003Against this background, a creditors\u2019 meeting was held on 15 March 2018. 7', 'The chairman of the meeting (the \u201cChairman\u201d) was a professional insolvency practitioner who was the nominee for the intended voluntary arrangement. Towards the end of the meeting, he raised a new point. He informed the creditors at the meeting that a third party was prepared to pay the monthly instalments of $100,000 to OCBC. The aim was to obtain OCBC\u2019s indulgence for the Property to be sold by the end of 2018. The unnamed third party was Mr Sutherland. The Chairman noted that under this arrangement, the third party would be paid in priority to the unsecured creditors from the sale proceeds. The Chairman took the view that this would benefit the unsecured creditors, provided that the third party did not charge interest. Interest was already accruing on the outstanding mortgage repayments in accordance with the terms of the OCBC mortgage.', '11\\u2003By this stage of the creditors\u2019 meeting, some of the creditors had already left. It was too late to modify the joint proposal to include this newly suggested arrangement. So, no vote was taken on it. However, one creditor is noted as objecting. He thought that it might amount to an undue preference. The Chairman disagreed with him. The relevant paragraph in the minutes reads: 8', '12\\u2003The next day, Mr Sutherland and his business advisor met Mr Mangat. Mr Sutherland described what happened in the following terms: 9', '13\\u2003The Debtors gave the applicant a letter dated 17 March 2018. It read in part: 10', '14\\u2003The letter did not mention that an assignment agreement would follow.

The facts of the relationship between the accused and Yati were also not contentious for the most part. I will first set out the key elements of the factual narrative, which are primarily based on the Agreed Statement of Facts filed jointly by the parties and, where necessary, supplemented by the evidence adduced at trial.', '4\\u2003At the material time, the accused was employed as a painter by Ferh International Pte Ltd (\u201cFerh\u201d) and stayed at a dormitory at 500 Old Choa Chu Kang Road, Sungei Tengah Lodge, Singapore 698924 (\u201cthe Dormitory\u201d). Yati, a female Indonesian national, was working as a domestic helper at the material time. 1', '5\\u2003The relationship between the accused and Yati began sometime in May 2012. They met on alternate Sundays and had sex about once a month. 2', 'The accused\u2019s evidence was that he would give Yati about $50\u2013$100 every month; and in addition, he bought her various things and even helped to pay off her debts and loans. 3', 'In his words, \u201c[t]he clothes she was wearing, all the things she had in her room, everything was given by me, bought with my money \u2026 whatever a person gives to his wife, I did the same\u201d. 4', '6\\u2003The relationship between the accused and Yati developed and, in November 2017, they agreed to get married in December 2018. 5', 'Although they had not yet gotten married, the accused testified that he regarded his relationship with Yati as that of \u201chusband and wife\u201d and that they had promised to be faithful to each other. 6', '7\\u2003Sometime in May or June 2018, Yati started dating one Shamim Shamizur Rahman (\u201cShamim\u201d), a Bangladeshi plumber working in Singapore. They would meet about once a month on Sundays. As the accused would call Yati every day, 7', 'he began to suspect that she was seeing someone else when she became uncontactable one Sunday. He confronted her and she admitted that she was in a relationship with Shamim. Following the confrontation, the accused asked his mother and his friend to help him look for a wife in Bangladesh. His mother found him a potential wife and arranged for his marriage in Bangladesh in February 2019. 8', '8\\u2003The accused and Yati reconciled sometime in July or August 2018 and resumed their meetings on alternate Sundays. They continued dating each other even after the accused informed Yati about his upcoming arranged marriage. Both of them continued to argue over Yati\u2019s relationship with Shamim. On one occasion, when they argued over Yati\u2019s relationship with Shamim, the accused pressed a towel over Yati\u2019s mouth. He released the towel when she started to struggle. Frightened, Yati apologised to the accused. 9', '9\\u2003Sometime in late October 2018 and early November 2018, Yati got to know one Hanifa Mohammad Abu (\u201cHanifa\u201d) on Facebook. Hanifa was a Bangladeshi working in Singapore as a general fitter. About a week later, he and Yati started meeting each other every Sunday morning; and they had sex within three weeks of getting to know each other. Yati admitted to Hanifa that she was in a relationship with the accused and told him that the accused had an arranged marriage in Bangladesh. She also sent Hanifa a screenshot of the accused\u2019s WhatsApp profile. Yati promised Hanifa that she would end her relationship with the accused, and she and Hanifa continued dating. 10', '10\\u2003On 9 December 2018, the accused once again suspected Yati of seeing someone else when he could not contact her. That night, Yati called the accused. She revealed to him that she had a new boyfriend (ie, Hanifa) and told him to return to Bangladesh for his arranged marriage. The accused asked to meet Yati on 23 December 2018 and she agreed. 11', '11\\u2003On 23 December 2018, the accused and Yati checked into a room at the Hotel. Yati told the accused that she did not meet Hanifa in person and that she would continue to meet the accused. However, this was untrue as she had met Hanifa in the morning prior to meeting the accused on 23 December 2018. 12', 'She also repaid a loan of $500 to the accused. After they parted ways, Yati called the accused that same evening to break up with him. He persuaded her to meet him at the Hotel for a final time on 30 December 2018. 13', '12\\u2003On the morning of 30 December 2018, the accused withdrew nearly all of his savings from a teller machine near the Dormitory, leaving only $37 in his bank account. 14', 'He had a rope with him in the pocket of the trousers that he wore to meet Yati, 15', 'but as will be seen, the Prosecution and the Defence provided sharply differing reasons for this.', '13\\u2003The accused met Yati at the block where she stayed with her employer at around 4pm. They took a taxi to Paya Lebar for Yati to collect facial cream from her friend. They then took a train from the Paya Lebar Mass Rapid Transit (\u201cMRT\u201d) station to Aljunied MRT station and made their way to the Hotel. 16', '14\\u2003After paying $40 for a three-hour stay, the accused and Yati checked into room 307 of the Hotel (\u201cthe Room\u201d) at around 5.15pm. They had sex for the first time that night and remained naked thereafter. The accused attempted to convince Yati to break up with Hanifa but to no avail. She also refused to let the accused check her mobile phone. 17', 'The accused wrapped a bath towel around her neck for the first time that night and threatened to kill her if she continued dating Hanifa and if she did not allow him to check her phone. 18', 'However, he then released the towel and they had sex again.', '15\\u2003The accused provided starkly different accounts in his statements and in his oral testimony as to what happened thereafter. According to his statements and his interviews with the psychiatrist from the Institute of Mental Health (\u201cIMH\u201d) Dr Christopher Cheok (\u201cDr Cheok\u201d), after he and Yati had sex for the second time, Yati told him that it would be the last time that they would meet. He then wrapped the towel around her neck for the second time that night. Yati was not cowed by the accused\u2019s threat to kill her and told him: \u201cIf you want to kill me, kill me. With you, this is my last meet. I don\u2019t want to see you again and I will not leave [Hanifa].\u201d 19', 'Upon hearing this, the accused tightened the towel around her neck.', '16\\u2003At trial, however, the accused said that after they had had sex for the second time that night, Yati told him: \u201cYou do sex with me \u2026 means you do sex with your mother.\u201d He allegedly responded by wrapping a towel around his hand and pressing the towel against Yati\u2019s mouth. He then removed his hand and told Yati: \u201cBecause of \u2026 a man, you are saying all these bad things about me and my mother. Then let me call [Hanifa].\u201d He tried to get Yati\u2019s phone in order to check the contents thereof and to call Hanifa. 20', '17\\u2003The accused also testified at trial that it was at this juncture that Yati told him: \u201c[Hanifa] is better than you. He is better than you in the hotel \u2026 he is better in bed \u2026 he is better financially. If you don\u2019t believe \u2026 next week I will go with him, will make a video and show you\u201d 21', '(\u201cthe Humiliating Words\u201d). According to the accused\u2019s testimony at trial, he was provoked by the Humiliating Words and lost his self-control; and this was why he proceeded to strangle Yati.', '18\\u2003The Prosecution disputed that Yati had uttered these Humiliating Words to the accused on 30 December 2018 and pointed out, inter alia, that these words had never once been mentioned in the accused\u2019s statements.', '19\\u2003In any event, the accused did not (for the most part) dispute the account he had given in his investigative statements of the acts he had carried out in killing Yati. He wrapped the towel around Yati\u2019s neck and tightened it. He then stepped on one end of the towel and pulled at the other end. 22', 'Yati became motionless soon after and the accused removed the towel from her neck. The accused then retrieved the rope which had been in his trouser pocket and tied it around Yati\u2019s neck. 23', 'He tightened the rope and tied \u201cabout two or three knots\u201d with it. 24', '20\\u2003Thereafter, the accused also pressed a towel over Yati\u2019s mouth for about ten to 15 seconds with considerable force 25', 'and observed that her face had turned blackish. 26', 'Finally, he twisted her head from left to right with \u201ca force of about 6\u20137, out of the spectrum [to] 10 where 1 [was] the least force used and 10 [was] the most force used\u201d. 27', 'It should be noted that in his investigative statements, the accused explained that he had strangled Yati with the rope and twisted her head from left to right in order to ensure that she would not survive. 28', 'In his oral testimony at trial, however, the accused\u2019s account was that he did so purely to stop a sound that he heard coming out from Yati\u2019s mouth. 29', '21\\u2003The accused proceeded to take a shower as he was sweating. 30', 'He also put Yati\u2019s clothes back on her body as he did not want anyone else to see her naked. He then placed her on her left side, covered her with a blanket and left the Room. 31', '22\\u2003At around 8.15pm, the accused went to the Hotel reception to extend the room booking. He haggled with the hotel staff over the price of extending the room booking and eventually paid $30 for a two-hour long extension. 32', 'Thereafter, he left the Hotel and bought a can of \u201cRed Bull\u201d at a provision shop nearby. 33', '23\\u2003The accused then returned to the Room. He observed that Yati was in the same position that he had left her. He took all her cash amounting to around $30, her mobile phone and her ez-link card, switched off the air-conditioner and lights in the Room, and left the Hotel. 34', '24\\u2003That night, the accused also spoke to Hanifa on the phone several times. 35', 'Hanifa testified that he had tried to call both Yati\u2019s and the accused\u2019s phone numbers that night, and that he knew that the accused was holding onto Yati\u2019s phone. 36', 'In these exchanges, the accused persistently interrogated Hanifa about his relationship with Yati. Hanifa testified that the accused sounded \u201cangry\u201d and that he \u201ctalked in a loud voice\u201d. 37', '25\\u2003The accused called his colleague and roommate, Khalik Md Abdul (\u201cKhalik\u201d), twice at about 8pm and 8.45pm, to ask for Khalik\u2019s whereabouts. Khalik informed the accused that he was at a provision shop within the Dormitory. 38', 'Shortly thereafter, the accused returned to the Dormitory and bought some food at the canteen. He then handed $1,000 in cash to Khalik, who agreed to help the accused remit the money to the accused\u2019s father in Bangladesh. 39', 'The accused told Khalik that he had killed someone. 40', '26\\u2003The accused then told his roommates that he would be returning to Bangladesh and offered them the food that he had earlier bought at the canteen. He also offered food to others in the neighbouring room. After talking to his colleagues, the accused took a shower and left the Dormitory. He loitered around Geylang before checking into Kim Tian Hotel (Han) located at 29 Lor 4 Geylang, Singapore 399281, at around 2am the next morning. He checked out of the hotel at around 5am and loitered in a park at Boon Lay. 41', '27\\u2003At around 9am, the accused sent a WhatsApp message to one Zoe Lau (\u201cZoe\u201d), who was in charge of human resource matters at Ferh. He told Zoe that he needed to return to Bangladesh that very day as he had some problems back at home. At Zoe\u2019s direction, the accused called Ferh\u2019s owner, Fadhillah bin Sahamat (\u201cFadhillah\u201d), and requested to return to Bangladesh that day. Fadhillah told the accused to go to the Ferh office to discuss the matter. 42', 'Unbeknownst to the accused, the police had already been in touch with Fadhillah by then. When the accused arrived at the Ferh office at around 10.45am, he was arrested by the police officers who were waiting in the office. 43', '28\\u2003At about 10.15pm on 30 December 2018, Mr Lee Peng Yuan (\u201cMr Lee\u201d), the Hotel receptionist, called the Room as the two-hour extension had expired. As nobody answered the call, Mr Lee went to the Room. He knocked on the door but received no response. He then unlocked the door and entered the Room with a duplicate key. 44', '29\\u2003Mr Lee saw Yati lying on the bed. He tried waking her up but she remained unresponsive. He then left the Room and called the police at around 10.45pm.', '30\\u2003Paramedics from Paya Lebar Fire Station were dispatched to the Hotel. At about 10.53pm, the paramedics arrived at the Hotel and went to the Room. One of the paramedics, Paramedic Sergeant Nabilah binte Sadali (\u201cW\/Sgt Nabilah\u201d), saw Yati lying on her side on the bed, covered in a blanket up to her shoulders. When the paramedics removed the blanket, they observed Yati to be unresponsive. There was a towel stained with blood next to her. W\/Sgt Nabilah checked Yati\u2019s body and observed that there was blood coming out of her nose and left ear, and that her face was swollen. She also felt the rope tied around Yati\u2019s neck. 45', 'Yati was pronounced dead at 11.02pm.', '31\\u2003On 31 December 2018, Dr Lee Chin Thye (\u201cDr Lee\u201d), a Consultant Forensic Pathologist with the Health Sciences Authority, conducted an autopsy on Yati.

On 12 September 2017, Mr Chua and B1 met a Vietnamese lady (\u201cB2\u201d) at W KTV (\u201cKTV\u201d), and the three of them later left for Hotel 81 Violet (\u201cthe Hotel\u201d). Mr Chua and B2 checked into the Hotel and were given the keys to Room 301 (\u201cthe Room\u201d). They entered the Room at 9.23pm, followed by B1 a minute later. Through the Hotel\u2019s closed circuit television (\u201cCCTV\u201d) system, the employee at the front desk of the Hotel (\u201cthe Employee\u201d) noticed B1 entering the Room. This was contrary to the Hotel\u2019s occupancy policy that only two people could be accommodated in a room. The Employee tried to call the Room using the telephone. As she received no answer, the Employee went up to the Room and knocked on the door. Mr Chua answered the door, and the Employee informed him of the occupancy limit. Mr Chua, however, denied that B1 was in the Room. A few minutes later, B1 exited the Room and approached the Employee to ask whether he could book a room for three people. The Employee told him that he could not do so. Angered by the Employee\u2019s response, B1 left the Hotel by the rear door. He stopped to smoke a cigarette at the rear of the Hotel, where he noticed some of the Hotel\u2019s towels in a crate. At 9.49pm, B1 set fire to the towels and left the scene. Subsequently, a passer-by informed the Hotel\u2019s staff of the fire and the police were called.', '7\\u2003Thereafter, the IO arrived at the Hotel and learnt that B1, the person who had set fire to the towels, had been in the Room where Mr Chua was staying.

The IO informed Mr Chua that B1 \u201chad set fire to Hotel towels\u201d and showed him a screenshot from the Hotel\u2019s CCTV footage capturing B1\u2019s presence. Mr Chua replied that he did not know B1. The IO then informed Mr Chua that he would record a statement from him. He told Mr Chua to speak the truth, and warned him that providing false information was an offence. Mr Chua acknowledged this. The IO then recorded a statement from him (\u201cthe First Statement\u201d) under s 22 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (\u201cCPC\u201d). In the First Statement, Mr Chua maintained that he did not know the identity of the person who had entered the Room at about 9.25pm, and further claimed that he had not allowed that person to enter the Room. Mr Chua also stated that he had visited KTV on his own. In making these assertions, Mr Chua intentionally provided false information to the IO.', '8\\u2003Given Mr Chua\u2019s lack of assistance, the IO proceeded to commence investigations into the identity of B1. Police officers reviewed the Hotel\u2019s CCTV footage and conducted ground inquiries there. They also made inquiries at KTV and reviewed the CCTV footage recorded there. Five police officers spent a combined total of 21.9 man-hours in their efforts to uncover the identity of B1. On reviewing the CCTV footage recorded at KTV, the police officers realised that Mr Chua and B1 had arrived at KTV together and had left within three minutes of each other. B1\u2019s identity was eventually established through the credit card and phone details that had been used to pay for the room charges incurred at KTV. The police then made arrangements to interview Mr Chua again on 20 September 2017. On that day, Mr Chua gave a further statement under s 22 of the CPC (\u201cthe Second Statement\u201d), in which he recanted the false information that he had provided in the First Statement.

For context, s 353 of the Penal Code sets out an aggravated form of the offence and it concerns the use of criminal force to deter a public servant from discharging his duty, whereas s 352 of the Penal Code concerns the use of criminal force simpliciter.

DPP Lum, on the other hand, contended that he had only observed to Mr Nevinjit that the sentence for such offences would ordinarily involve a custodial term.', '6\\u2003Mr Singh elected not to plead guilty at the hearing on 29 July 2020. Instead, he took the position that there was an enforceable plea agreement between him and the Prosecution. Accordingly, he made an oral application to enforce the alleged plea agreement. This was dismissed by the District Judge who considered that he had no jurisdiction to make such an order. Mr Singh then filed the present application by way of a criminal motion in the High Court.'"}

The appellant was a delivery driver driving his Toyota Hiace commercial van along the Kranji Expressway (\u201cKJE\u201d) on 30 November 2018 at about 4.10pm. He was heading towards the Bukit Timah Expressway (\u201cBKE\u201d).

{"casename":"2021_SGHC_75","fact":"'4\\u2003The arbitration, conducted under an agreed expedited procedure, concerned a long-term contract for the supply over time of a specified quantity of clinker at a fixed price. The approximate size of shipments was agreed, as well as the total period. That period was subsequently extended. Five shipments were made and paid for, leaving almost half of the originally contracted quantity still to be delivered. There was a second contract that featured in relation to a defence that is not in issue in this challenge, and there is no need to say more about it in this judgment.', '5\\u2003CIN submitted a notice of arbitration to the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (\u201cSIAC\u201d) under the applicable arbitration clause. In its notice of arbitration and its statement of claim (the \u201cStatement of Claim\u201d), CIN sought to hold CIM liable for non-delivery of the remaining contracted quantity of clinker under the first contract, claiming damages to be assessed in accordance with s 51 of the Sale of Goods Act 1979 (c 54) (UK) (the \u201cEnglish Sale of Goods Act\u201d). 1', '6\\u2003In its statement of defence (the \u201cStatement of Defence\u201d), CIM contended, among other defences, that it was a condition precedent that, in respect of each shipment, parties had to agree a laycan, and thereafter CIN had to nominate a vessel. As no laycans had been agreed for the balance of the clinker, nor had any vessel been nominated by CIN, CIM was not obliged to deliver. 2', '7\\u2003CIN\u2019s primary response in its statement of reply (the \u201cStatement of Reply\u201d) to this part of CIM\u2019s defence was to deny that there were any conditions precedent to delivery. 3', 'However, CIN\u2019s Statement of Reply then went on to add that \u201c[i]n any event, [CIM was] relying on its own failures to agree on the shipment loading laycan\u201d. 4', 'Pleading that CIM was \u201cevidently unwilling to proceed with a contract which price changes had made unfavourable to it\u201d, 5', 'CIN concluded that \u201c[a]s such, without agreement on laycan [CIN] was unable to proceed with nominating the performing vessel \u2026 It is quite unrealistic for [CIM] to suggest otherwise\u201d. 6', '8\\u2003This passage seems to have in mind the principle that a party to a contract is not entitled to rely on the non-fulfilment of a condition precedent as a defence to an action for a breach of a contractual obligation, when it is the cause of that non-fulfilment. For convenience, I will refer to this as the \u201cprevention principle\u201d, because it is one application of that principle, which is well known to common lawyers. It is a doctrine summed up in the legal maxim that no man shall take advantage of his own wrong. However, while this passage seems to have in mind the prevention principle, the Statement of Reply did not plead that CIM was on this basis not entitled to rely on non-fulfilment of the condition precedent. It only said that it was \u201cunrealistic\u201d for CIM to suggest that CIN was able to proceed with nominating the performing vessel.', '9\\u2003CIN\u2019s written opening submissions still did not clearly state that CIN was invoking the prevention principle. Indeed, CIN said: 7', 'This can be read as urging the Tribunal to steer clear of any inquiry into who was at fault for non-fulfilment of the condition precedent, a stance inimical to the invocation of the prevention doctrine.', '10\\u2003Further in its written opening submissions, CIN added: 8', '11\\u2003Without yet being completely clear about the legal significance of the facts mentioned, CIN went on to say: 9', '12\\u2003From the two extracts set out at [10] and [11] above, CIN was plainly reaching toward the prevention principle, while not identifying it in plain language. In these two extracts, CIN identified that it was CIM\u2019s unwillingness to deliver that was the real problem, yet stopped short of stating that, as a result, CIM could not rely on the non-fulfilment of condition precedent.', '13\\u2003CIM\u2019s written opening submissions, submitted at the same time as CIN\u2019s written opening submissions, if taken at face value, seem to show that its counsel understood CIN\u2019s position hitherto on this aspect differently from any invocation of the prevention principle. She understood CIN\u2019s position as alleging that CIM never intended to perform the contract and so was in anticipatory breach, such that CIN could accept and consequently be excused from further performance (including nominating the vessel) and claim damages. She identified a fatal flaw in this position that she attributed to CIN, namely that CIN had never purported to accept any anticipatory repudiation. 10', '14\\u2003In oral opening on the first day of the evidentiary hearing, CIN\u2019s counsel asserted that CIM was relying on its own failures, describing this stance as having \u201can air of unreality\u201d and being \u201can artificial position to take\u201d. 11', 'However, as with CIN\u2019s description of CIM\u2019s case as \u201cunrealistic\u201d in its Statement of Reply (see [7]\u2013[8] above), describing a position as artificial or unreal is not the same as identifying the legal basis on which it is untenable or rebutted. Instead, such language generally relates more to persuading a tribunal to the proponent\u2019s view of the facts and how they connect to each other.', '15\\u2003CIM\u2019s counsel must by now be taken to have read CIN\u2019s written opening submissions. Nonetheless, in her oral opening she continued to view CIN\u2019s position as resting on an anticipatory breach by CIM, and took the position she would not need to deal with it because it was not pleaded: 12', '16\\u2003CIN\u2019s counsel did not at this juncture point out that the view CIM\u2019s counsel took of his position was wrong.', '17\\u2003Witness evidence then proceeded, and CIN\u2019s counsel did question witnesses about why laycans were not agreed, and about CIM\u2019s willingness to perform only if the price were higher than contracted. Such questions no doubt had more than one purpose, and likely also related to the defence of force majeure that CIM had raised. That defence was rejected by the Tribunal and is not relevant to this setting aside application. Nonetheless, this line of questioning certainly traversed the issue of who was at fault, and elicited a concession by CIM\u2019s witness that CIM\u2019s position was that if the price did not \u201cwork\u201d, the discussion between CIM and CIN would not proceed to the question of laycan dates, 13', 'a point that supported CIN\u2019s case that the real problem was CIM\u2019s difficulty with the contracted price. However, nowhere did CIN\u2019s counsel put to the witness that because CIM\u2019s stance on price meant they could not get to the next step of agreeing laycans, and so also could not get to the following step of CIN nominating the vessel, CIM could not rely on the non-fulfilment of conditions precedent, namely agreement on laycans and nomination of a vessel, to excuse its breach of the obligation to deliver.', '18\\u2003Closing submissions were directed to be sequential. Given the expedited character of the arbitration, time frames were compressed. CIN\u2019s counsel in his written closing submissions contended that CIM was \u201cnot entitled to rely on such a defence [ie, non-fulfilment of conditions precedent] when it is relying on its own failures to excuse its breach of the Contract\u201d. 14', 'This clearly set out CIN\u2019s reliance on the prevention principle. To support this contention, CIN elaborated on what CIM\u2019s alleged failures were, namely that CIM failed to engage with CIN even though CIM was obliged to act in good faith and work with CIN to discuss the laycan. References were made to the cross examination of witnesses, legal authorities and correspondences between the parties. 15', '19\\u2003Shortly thereafter, CIM filed its written closing submissions. It devoted a section of these submissions to \u201c[t]he allegation that [CIM] \u2018crashed\u2019 performance and is relying on its own wrongdoing\u201d. It began this section as follows: 16', '20\\u2003CIM summed up its response as follows: 17', '21\\u2003In its written closing submissions, therefore, CIM did address the allegation that it was frustrating or preventing agreement on laycans, including by reference to the evidence. However, it continued to view this point as requiring a claim of breach and damages for that breach, neither of which was pleaded, although the concern about what was not pleaded seems to have changed focus from anticipatory breach to breach of a good faith obligation to agree on laycans. CIM thus urged the Tribunal to disregard this allegation as unpleaded and academic.', '22\\u2003CIN then filed its written reply submissions. Its response to the relevant section of CIM\u2019s written closing submissions began with the statement that \u201c[t]his section of [CIM\u2019s] Closing is not entirely understood.\u201d 18', 'CIN then went on as follows: 19', '23\\u2003Thus, CIN\u2019s written reply submissions were the first occasion on which counsel for CIN corrected what he considered to be counsel for CIM\u2019s misunderstanding of CIN\u2019s case. There was, again, reliance on the prevention principle, but this time, it was more clearly and fully articulated with Mackay v Dick (1881) 6 App Cas 251 (\u201cMackay v Dick\u201d) being cited for the first time in a footnote at the end of para 3.4 in CIM\u2019s written closing submissions. CIN contended that CIM had an obligation to say what it could do and when, but CIM failed to do so because it was not willing to deliver at the contracted price. This was the reason that there was no agreement concerning laycans and no nomination of vessels. As the cause of the non-fulfilment of the conditions precedent, CIM could not rely on their non-fulfilment to excuse its non-delivery. CIN did not refer to CIM\u2019s obligation as a standalone duty, a breach of which sounded in damages; rather, reference to that obligation was part of a broader contention as to why CIM could not rely on the non-fulfilment of the conditions precedent.', '24\\u2003There was no provision for CIM to respond to CIN\u2019s written reply submissions. Nor did CIM write in to request the opportunity to respond to them, whether generally or specifically to the citation of new authorities. CIM was content to rest on its own written closing submissions, apparently believing that the Tribunal would accept its stance that this aspect of CIN\u2019s case was unpleaded and so had to be disregarded.', '25\\u2003The Tribunal issued its Award on 19 September 2020. The Award accepted CIN\u2019s case that CIM would not supply at the contracted price, and so would not agree laycans. It also accepted the principle set out in Mackay v Dick as applying to the facts. The relevant parts of the Award, which I will term the \u201cCooperation Finding\u201d, are as follows: 20', '26\\u2003The nub of the Cooperation Finding is this: the conditions precedent that CIM relied on entailed a mutual obligation to engage in good faith and attempt to agree reasonable laycans; however, CIM breached this obligation and thus, it could not rely on the non-fulfilment of these conditions precedent to excuse its breach of the obligation to deliver. The Cooperation Finding rested on the prevention principle.', '27\\u2003In concluding that there was a duty to cooperate to agree laycans, the Tribunal spelled out its reasoning in ways that counsel for CIN had not. One such way was to read into the mutuality of the obligation to agree laycans an express element of cooperation. Another was to add the words \u201cin good faith\u201d. A third was to put the obligation on the basis of an implied term to cooperate. In addition, the Tribunal described the consequence of CIM\u2019s breach of this duty in terms of waiver, stating that CIM had thereby waived the right to rely on the conditions precedent. It is fair to infer that in these parts of its Award the Tribunal read a little more deeply into the prevention principle and particularly its modern juridical basis and terminology. Counsel for CIN had adopted a more broad-brush approach, had been content with the language used in Mackay v Dick and had appealed particularly to \u201creality\u201d.', '28\\u2003The Tribunal went on to rule that CIN was entitled to recover damages assessed according to s 51(3) of the English Sale of Goods Act. 21', 'In its calculation of damages (the \u201cCalculation of Damages Finding\u201d), the Tribunal considered, inter alia, four scenarios submitted by CIN as to when the remaining goods ought to have been delivered. 22', 'In so doing, it noted that \u201c[CIM] did not enter into this debate.\u201d 23', 'Eventually, however, the Tribunal adopted none of CIN\u2019s submitted scenarios, choosing instead to assess damages on the assumption that there would have been five evenly spaced shipments, \u201cif [CIM] had complied with its obligation to engage and had attempted to agree laycans with [CIN]\u201d. 24', 'On this basis, the Tribunal ordered CIM to pay CIN damages in the sum of US$949,543.09, 25', 'along with attendant sums of interest and costs. 26'"}
{"casename":"2021_SGHC_76","fact":"'3\\u2003The plaintiffs and the defendant in this case are siblings of the Ong family. Mr Ong Chen Kiat and Mdm Ang Mong Kwa had six children, four daughters and two sons, who are the parties in this action (collectively, the \u201cOng siblings\u201d), as follows. The defendant is the oldest son of the family. 1', '4\\u2003The six siblings grew up in the family home in a kampong at Lorong Gemilap which is located in Yio Chu Kang. This was one of the last surviving kampongs in Singapore, until the kampong land was compulsorily acquired in the late 1980s. While they were living in the kampong, their father carried out several trades on their land: first, pig farming, and then later, poultry slaughtering. He also planted fruit trees throughout the kampong and sold the fruits. 2', '5\\u2003The plaintiffs and defendant attended school but also helped in the father\u2019s poultry slaughtering business. Most of them dropped out of school at a young age, with KG being the only one managing to qualify to take the exams at secondary four level. She went on to attend a vocational institute where she learnt hairdressing. She then worked as a hairdresser at a beauty salon in Ang Mo Kio. 3', '6\\u2003After dropping out of school, the other plaintiffs also worked. When their father switched from pig farming to poultry slaughtering, the land where the pig sty once stood was converted to a space where SK carried out a hairdressing business of her own, which was named after her, called Sor Kim Unisex Hairdressing & Beauty Salon. SA worked as a live-in domestic helper outside of the kampong, while SM worked as a seamstress. CK was an apprentice to a carpenter before he entered national service. After that, he worked in a furniture upholstery business where he made cushions, while at the same time helping in the father\u2019s poultry slaughtering business. 4', '7\\u2003The defendant was the only one who did not pick up a trade of his own but continued to help the father in the poultry slaughtering business. Their uncle was also involved in the business, for which he was paid by the elder Mr Ong. It is disputed whether CK and the defendant were also paid by their father for helping out in the business, with the defendant insisting that he was, but CK denying that the two sons were ever paid.', '8\\u2003The plaintiffs all gave evidence that they would hand over their earnings to their mother, who would manage the finances of the Ong family from a communal family fund. 5', 'The defendant, on the other hand, claims that he kept whatever he was paid by his father for helping in the poultry slaughtering business. 6', '9\\u2003In 1988, the kampong land was compulsorily acquired by the Government. A significant sum was paid in compensation, which was kept and managed by the mother. It is not disputed that the father did not handle the finances of the family because he was a gambler. 7', 'Parties were in dispute as to the size of the compensation payment. The defendant\u2019s counsel put to the plaintiffs that it was only S$100,000, but the defendant testified that it was \u201cabout\u201d S$110,000. 8', 'The plaintiffs\u2019 figures ranged from S$100,000 to S$176,000 (the plaintiffs pleaded that it was \u201cover S$100,000.00\u201d, which was also SK\u2019s testimony; KG attested that it was S$150,000 but also testified that it was S$176,000; CK testified that it was S$150,000). 9', '10\\u2003However, it is not in dispute that the Ong family was offered the chance to buy two adjoining three-room HDB flats in Yishun to assist in their resettlement, and for which approximately S$60,000 of the compensation moneys was used to pay for one flat (\u201cUnit 172\u201d) and the other flat (\u201cUnit 174\u201d) was completely financed by a loan from the HDB. 10', 'Unit 172 was registered in the joint names of the parents, while Unit 174 was registered in the joint names of CK and the defendant. 11', 'The housing loan for Unit 174 was paid over the years, but it is common ground that the defendant did not make any financial contributions to the payment of the loan. 12', '11\\u2003In February 1989, a tender for a two-storey HDB shophouse at Block 698 Hougang Street 61 #01-06 (\u201cthe Hougang shophouse\u201d) was made in the name of the defendant. That tender was successful and a tenancy agreement dated 31 March 1989 between the HDB and the defendant was executed. 13', 'Parties are in dispute as to the circumstances leading to the tender for the tenancy of the Hougang shophouse and who made the initial payments for that tenancy, but that will be dealt with later in this judgment.', '12\\u2003The Hougang shophouse had a commercial space on the ground floor and a residential unit on the second floor. While it contains a residential unit, HDB shophouses are commercial properties, so the eligibility criteria set by HDB for their ownership is different (and less stringent) than HDB flats. I will come back to this point on whether the plaintiffs are eligible to own the Hougang shophouse later. The evidence before me is that the commercial space on the first floor was sub-divided into four separate spaces and let to various sub-tenants. One of those spaces was occupied by a hairdressing salon known as \u201cRed Point Hair Beauty and Trading\u201d (\u201cRed Point\u201d), which was a sole proprietorship registered in the name of the defendant. Again, the circumstances under which Red Point started and how it was managed and run are matters of dispute. However, it is not disputed that SK, SM and KG worked at Red Point from its inception until 2018, when this dispute started between the plaintiffs and the defendant.', '13\\u2003The HDB offered the Hougang shophouse for sale to the existing tenant, the defendant, in 1995. The offer was taken up, and the purchase price was S$782,000, which was completely financed by a loan from Hong Leong Finance. The defendant was registered as the owner of the Hougang shophouse, and he remains the sole registered owner up to this day. 14', '14\\u2003As for the two Yishun flats, they went through changes in the registered owners. In 1994, the elder Mr Ong passed away from an illness and the mother became the sole owner of Unit 172. SM was added as a joint owner of that flat the following year. She became the sole registered owner of Unit 172, when their mother passed away in 2016. 15', '15\\u2003In 1999, CK got married and wanted to apply for an HDB flat of his own. To do this, his name was withdrawn as a registered co-owner of Unit 174, and he was replaced by SK. To date, the defendant and SK are the registered joint owners of Unit 174. 16', '16\\u2003With the exception of KG, who got married in 1989, most of the Ong family resided in the two Yishun flats after they moved out of the kampong. In the mid-1990s, SA moved out and got a resale flat of her own. CK moved out not long after he got married in 1999. While the defendant maintained a room at Unit 174, he usually stayed at a room on the second floor of the Hougang shophouse.', '17\\u2003SK and SM, who were unmarried, stayed with their mother at Unit 172. But sometime after the passing of the elder Mr Ong, the three of them moved to live at the second floor of the Hougang shophouse in 2003. 17', 'The Yishun flats were then rented out and the rental proceeds were used to pay for the Ong family expenses.', '18\\u2003For the last nine years of her life, their mother became ill, was bedridden and needed medical care. A domestic helper was employed to help care for her and also to handle the household chores. She passed away in 2016, while living at the Hougang shophouse. SK and SM continued to live there until they were forced to move out by the defendant in 2018. They then moved back to Unit 174 and presently reside there. Only Unit 172 is rented out now. 18', '19\\u2003The unchallenged evidence before me is that the relationship between the defendant and his siblings had always been quite strained. For some of his siblings, such as SM and CK, their relationship was barely cordial. After their mother\u2019s death in 2016, the defendant started acting in a way which caused the plaintiffs to believe that he would attempt to claim beneficial ownership over the Hougang shophouse. In their view, this was wrong because the property was beneficially owned by all six siblings in equal shares, as it was always the intention of all the members of the Ong family that it would be their \u201cretirement fund\u201d and it was in any event paid for with funds which were family moneys.', '20\\u2003The differences between them eventually led to a family meeting on 25 June 2017 held at the Hougang shophouse. There is an audio recording of the meeting, which lasted more than two and a half hours. 19', 'For most of the meeting, things were fractious, and there was plenty of shouting and arguing. Many longstanding family issues were raised. Towards the end of the meeting, the defendant signed a document in English where he acknowledged that the Hougang shophouse and Unit 174 were to be shared equally between all the Ong siblings. 20', '21\\u2003Sometime after the meeting, the defendant sought legal advice. He then made a police report on 2 July 2017 claiming that he was forced by threats of physical violence to sign a document at a family meeting which required him to share, inter alia, the Hougang shophouse, which he claimed to own entirely. 21', 'About six months later on 25 January 2018, the defendant started to demand that KG, SK and SM, who worked at Red Point, pay him rent for use of the premises. They refused and Red Point\u2019s business ceased shortly after. 22', 'Then, in or around 25 June 2018, the defendant also applied to the Family Justice Courts for a personal protection order (\u201cPPO\u201d) against his siblings. 23', 'This PPO application was concluded by a settlement agreement in which the parties agreed, inter alia, that the plaintiffs \u201cwill not visit\u201d the defendant at the Hougang shophouse, and this was \u201cwithout admission of liability by any of the parties\u201d. 24', '22\\u2003The plaintiffs then commenced these proceedings against the defendant on 27 December 2018.'"}

The contested heads of loss are listed at Annex B. 7', 'The two largest and most contentious heads of loss are losses which extend into the future: loss of future earnings and future medical expenses.

{"casename":"2021_SGHC_78","fact":"'7\\u2003First, I reject the submission that the aggravating factors were accorded disproportionate weight.', '8\\u2003In my view, the DJ was entitled to regard the appellant\u2019s use of the internet to contact the victim as an aggravating factor. Befriending the victim through the internet was not an aggravating factor on the particular facts of AQW v PP [2015] 4 SLR 150 (\u201cAQW\u201d) because there was nothing to suggest that the appellant in that case had \u201cused the Internet with the intent of committing the offence\u201d (AQW at [60]).', '9\\u2003In contrast, the appellant in this case used the internet with the intention of committing sexual offences. In the Statement of Facts (\u201cSOF\u201d), the appellant admits to using a Facebook account with the moniker \u201cPeter Teo\u201d to look for females to befriend. 7', 'Once the victim accepted his friend request, the appellant used the Facebook Messenger app to: (a) initiate conversations of a sexual nature (including asking her to fellate him); and (b) send lewd photographs and procure the same from the victim. In the 21 July IMH Letter, the appellant also admits to pursuing \u201csexual relations with females he met over the internet.\u201d 8', 'I take this opportunity to signal the court\u2019s contempt for such predatory behaviour in the digital realm and accordingly find that general deterrence is a dominant consideration in this case.', '10\\u2003I am also satisfied that the DJ was entitled to regard the falsity of the appellant\u2019s Facebook moniker as an aggravating factor. The usage of a false moniker, when seen alongside the appellant lying about his true age to the victim and meeting her in a multi-storey carpark instead of his home, reveals an intention to \u201cconceal [his] identity and avoid detection\u201d (AQW at [61]). Such intention is not displaced by the fact that the appellant\u2019s car, where the offences were committed, bore a licence plate number or that the appellant drove the victim to school. The appellant may have regarded the likelihood of the victim recalling his licence plate number, or being noticed by her peers, as being negligible. In this case, the appellant\u2019s speedy arrest is also a testament to the efficacy of our law enforcement agencies, and should not be credited to the appellant.', '11\\u2003As regards premeditation, I uphold the DJ\u2019s finding that the offence involving vaginal penetration was premeditated. The court in Ng Jun Xian v PP [2017] 3 SLR 933 at [42] held that the offences of sexual assault by digital penetration of the vagina and attempted rape were committed with \u201csome degree of premeditation and planning\u201d as the accused \u201cat the very least\u2026had sought to set the stage by sending the victim to the hotel\u2026and \u2026took the opportunity when it presented itself to commit the sexual assault\u201d. Even if the appellant did not specifically intend to commit vaginal penetration before the meeting, he had deliberately set the stage for such an opportunity to arise by making repeated advances on the victim, arranging to meet the victim in the early hours of the morning and offering to send her to school so as to coax her into meeting him. When the opportunity presented itself, he penetrated the victim\u2019s vagina twice within a span of 40 minutes.', '12\\u2003Further, while I agree that sexual grooming is not a distinct aggravating factor from premeditation (Ng Kean Meng Terence v PP [2017] 2 SLR 449 (\u201cTerence Ng\u201d) at [44(c)]), it still enhances the degree of premeditation in this case. As such, the weight accorded to the evidence of sexual grooming is not so disproportionate as to invite appellate intervention.', '13\\u2003As to whether he had acted with persistence, the appellant denies this on the basis of evidence raised in the Mitigation Plea in the court below. Namely, he claims that he did not press the matter when the victim cancelled their meeting two days prior to the agreed date and that it was the victim who broached the topic of meeting again. 9', 'However, even if I accept the appellant\u2019s evidence in his Mitigation Plea, I am not prepared to disturb the DJ\u2019s finding. The SOF clearly reveals that the appellant made repeated advances despite being initially rebuffed: when the victim failed to respond to the appellant\u2019s invitation to \u201ctry\u201d fellating him, the appellant proceeded to ask if she wanted to \u201cmeet\u201d and repeated this latter request notwithstanding the victim\u2019s refusals. 10', '14\\u2003At this juncture, it is convenient for me to address the respondent\u2019s submission that some of the appellant\u2019s arguments involve victim-blaming and thus demonstrate his lack of remorse. The appellant\u2019s arguments in question are that: (a) the victim initiated sexual intimacy after having originally said that she was unable to meet the appellant (see [13] above); and (b) that the victim expected more than simply penile-oral penetration given that she showed up without panties (\u201cthe Impugned Arguments\u201d). 11', '15\\u2003However, I am not minded to hold the Impugned Arguments against the appellant. The type of arguments which drew the court\u2019s criticism in GCM v PP and another appeal [2021] SGHC 18 (\u201cGCM\u201d) at [91]\u2013[95] were those that attacked the victim\u2019s character and\/or morality. Insofar as the Impugned Arguments go to the issues of the victim\u2019s consent and\/or the appellant\u2019s persistence in persuading the victim to meet him, the appellant is entitled to make his case.', '16\\u2003Finally, in relation to the degree of fear and emotional harm inflicted on the victim, the DJ rightfully highlighted the appellant\u2019s failure to use a condom and the attendant risk of an unwanted pregnancy as being aggravating (PP v Lee Ah Choy [2016] 4 SLR 1300 at [50]). This factor distinguishes the present case from some precedents such as PP v Len Teck Guan DAC-936149-2017 & Ors and underscores the importance of retribution as a sentencing consideration (GCM at [59]).', '17\\u2003For completeness, I should also address the following points raised by the parties.', '18\\u2003First, it is unclear whether the DJ regarded the age disparity of the appellant and victim as an aggravating factor. 12', 'Insofar as he did, I do not regard the weight placed on it to be so disproportionate as to render the sentence manifestly excessive. The age disparity forms part of the backdrop against which the sentence must be decided. In any case, AQW at [24] does not shut out the possibility of the age disparity carrying some weight as an aggravating factor.', '19\\u2003Second, the SOF does not bear out the victim\u2019s consent to vaginal penetration. In fact, she was \u201cunder the impression that she was meeting the [appellant] only to [fellate him]\u201d [emphasis added]. 13', 'The absence of such consent aggravates the severity of the appellant\u2019s criminal conduct (Terence Ng at [44(f)] and [45(b)]).'"}

On 26 January 2021, Mr Kuoh appointed \nMs Luo Ling Ling (\u201cMs Luo\u201d) to act on his behalf, and when parties appeared \nbefore me on 8 February 2021, I granted leave to Mr Kuoh to withdraw \nAAS 479.\n12 As Mr Tan continued to object to Mr Kuoh\u2019s application for admission \nto the Bar, I directed parties to file their affidavits and submissions regarding \nthe application under AAS 718, and I adjourned the matter to 5 April 2021 for \nmy decision regarding AAS 718.\n13 On 5 April 2021, I was informed that Mr Tan had withdrawn his \nobjections to Mr Kuoh\u2019s application under AAS 718.

This meant that even if Mr Tan had not objected to AAS 479, Mr Kuoh \ncould not have been admitted under that application.\n16 Mr Kenii Takashima, who appeared on behalf of Mr Tan, did not refute \nMs Luo\u2019s discovery, but he objected to paying costs to Mr Kuoh. He sought two \nweeks to file his submissions on costs. I granted him the time and will decide \non the question of costs in due course, but I am now releasing my grounds for \nAAS 718 because from the matter arising in it, some inquiries may have to be \nconducted urgently by the relevant authorities.\n17 Specifically, it appears that Mr Kuoh was not Mr Tan\u2019s only practice \ntrainee at the material time (of AAS 479). This came to light when Mr Kuoh \nstated in an affidavit that Mr Tan had insisted on him (Mr Kuoh) accompanying \nhim to Cambodia for a work trip.

What this was all about may be interesting if more facts are known, but \nthe significance lies in the reference to another practice trainee in the firm. \nMr Tan had stated in his Notice of Objection dated 14 August 2019 that he was \nthe sole proprietor of his firm. This means that at least one person might have \nbeen admitted to the Bar when he had not received supervision from a qualified \nperson. At the subsequent hearing before me on 8 April 2021, Mr Tan said that \nhe had only supervised Mr Kuoh and one other practice trainee at the material \ntime, and had no other trainees before or after that. Despite this, in Mr Tan\u2019s \nsecond Notice of Objection dated 7 September 2019 adduced in Mr Tan\u2019s \naffidavit of 22 February 2021, Mr Tan made reference to a \u201cnew trainee\u201d under \nhis supervision who had joined his firm in July 2019. Who these practice \ntrainees are, and how many more there were, is a matter that should be swiftly \nand vigorously pursued by the Supervising Authorities.\n19 I mentioned at the outset that many questions remain unanswered. \nAmong them, were the reasons given by Mr Tan for objecting to Mr Kuoh\u2019s \napplication the true or only reasons? Have these other practice trainees of \nMr Tan since been admitted to the Bar? These are questions outside the scope \nof this application, and I make no findings, nor do I draw any inferences from \nthem.

Under the terms of the 2014 MOU, the parties \u201c[agreed] and [confirmed]\u201d that, \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d the terms of the NYC\/Luxe SPA, their \u201ctrue and mutual intentions\u201d was for the Tendcare shares to be issued thereunder to be free \u201cin consideration for services rendered to BJTJ and its intended group of restructured companies\u201d. The 2014 MOU further provided that the total consideration for the shares of US$36,436,597.47 would be \u201cfully funded\u201d by Mr Gong instead of being paid by NYC and Luxe. To this end, the parties entered into a waiver agreement dated 5 June 2013 to reduce the Initial Payment from US$810,000 to US$10,000. Mr Yit asserts that the waiver agreement should be dated 5 June 2014 instead. Mr Sim paid the sum of US$10,000 to Tendcare on 6 June 2014.', '18\\u2003Subsequently, in 2014, Tendcare, Luxe and NYC entered into a \u201cSupplement to the Ordinary SPA\u201d (\u201cthe Supplemental Agreement\u201d). The Supplemental Agreement was executed by Mr Gong, Mr Gwee and Mr Sim on behalf of Tendcare, Luxe and NYC respectively. Under the terms of the Supplemental Agreement, the price per share stated in the NYC\/Luxe SPA was reduced from US$27,540.89 to US$14,603.17, thereby reducing the total consideration for the shares from US$36,436,597.47 to US$19,320,000.', '19\\u2003Mr Miao asserts that he found out about Luxe and NYC from Mr Gong in early December 2014. Mr Miao was told that the 6% of the undiluted ordinary shares of Tendcare that were promised to Mr Gwee, Mr Sim and himself under the September 2013 MOU had been issued to NYC and Luxe under the NYC\/Luxe SPA. Mr Miao became angry as a result and felt that his trust in Mr Gwee and Mr Sim had been \u201cmisplaced\u201d. Shortly thereafter, pursuant to a shareholder\u2019s resolution dated 15 December 2014, Mr Miao dismissed Mr Gwee as CEO of HXG and terminated the services of Mr Sim with immediate effect. By a termination agreement dated 17 December 2014, HXG terminated the 2013 HXG LOE with BJTJ. The agreement was signed by Mr Miao on behalf of HXG and Mr Gong on behalf of BJTJ.', '20\\u2003Following a meeting on 26 January 2015 (\u201cthe 26 January 2015 Meeting\u201d), Mr Gong, Mr Miao, Mr Gwee and Mr Sim entered into an agreement dated 26 January 2015 (the \u201cTermination Agreement\u201d). The Termination Agreement provided for the termination of the 2014 MOU and all related agreements, including the NYC\/Luxe SPA and the Supplemental Agreement. Under the Termination Agreement, each party agreed to release and absolve the other from any unsatisfied debts, responsibilities or obligations arising out of or in connection with inter alia the September 2013 MOU and the 2014 MOU. Mr Gwee and Mr Sim also agreed to relinquish all their rights and interests in Luxe and NYC in favour of Gongs Global. As a result of the Termination Agreement, the shares in Tendcare held by NYC\/Luxe reverted to Gongs Global. Mr Gwee and Mr Sim therefore did not each receive the 2% undiluted ordinary shares in Tendcare that had been promised under the September 2013 MOU.', '21\\u2003With the Termination Agreement, Mr Gwee and Mr Sim ceased to be involved in the Tendcare IPO. Following Mr Gwee\u2019s disengagement, Mr Cheung took over as the new CEO of HXG.', '22\\u2003Subsequent to the Termination Agreement, Mr Gong (on behalf of Tendcare) and Mr Miao (on behalf of HXG) entered into three agreements (the \u201cPost-Termination Agreements\u201d), viz:', '(a)\\u2003A Success Fee Agreement dated 1 February 2015 under which HXG agreed to provide assistance on pre-IPO fund raising in return for a success fee of 5.5% of the pre-IPO funding raised. This was an increase from the 4.5% success fee agreed under the September 2013 MOU.', '(b)\\u2003An IPO Shares Agreement and a Retainer Agreement both dated 1 February 2015 under which HXG agreed to provide assistance on the reorganisation of Tendcare\u2019s medical business in preparation for the Tendcare IPO, in return for (i) Gongs Global issuing 3% of the undiluted ordinary shares in Tendcare to either QHC or Mr Miao (as opposed to the 2% which Mr Miao was to receive under the September 2013 MOU), and (ii) HXTJ paying QHC a monthly retainer fee of HK$300,000 until Tendcare was listed (as opposed to the S$100,000 that BJTJ was to pay to HXG under the September 2013 MOU).', '23\\u2003In anticipation of the Tendcare IPO, Easom Limited (\u201cEasom\u201d) entered into a SPA dated 4 February 2015 to subscribe for 1,686 new ordinary shares in Tendcare at US$29,648.60 per share (\u201cthe Easom SPA\u201d). On 31 March 2015, Mari Mundi III Limited (\u201cMMIII\u201d), a unit of China Merchant Capital, extended a loan of US$40m to Tian Jian HK as pre-IPO financing. The MMIII loan was secured by inter alia charges over Mr Gong\u2019s shares in Gongs Global and Tendcare\u2019s shares in Tian Jian HK, following the pre-IPO restructuring of the Tian Jian Group as noted above at [14]. Six months later, OCA agreed to provide a US$19,978,280 loan to Tendcare via a Convertible Note Subscription Agreement (\u201cOCA CNSA\u201d) dated 10 September 2015.', '24\\u2003In the event, the Tendcare IPO did not take place. Also, the shares that were issued to Luxe and NYC under the NYC\/Luxe SPA and subsequently transferred to Gongs Global were not fully paid up despite the 2014 MOU providing that Mr Gong would pay for them (see [17] above).'"}

IL in turn stopped paying hire to the plaintiff under the main charterparties, also with effect from February 2016. 13', 'It is common ground that IL has been dormant since 2013 and that it has had no source of revenue or other cash flow at any time other than these two subcharterparties with BMI. IL\u2019s only means of paying the hire due to the plaintiff under the main charterparties was therefore BMI\u2019s payments of hire due to IL under the subcharterparties.', '9\\u2003In July 2016, the plaintiff commenced an arbitration against IL under each charterparty to recover damages for breach of contract, including but not limited to the unpaid hire. 14', 'IL participated in the constitution of the tribunal 15', 'but withdrew from the arbitrations after that. 16', 'In November 2017, the plaintiff secured two awards against IL. The awards required IL to pay the plaintiff over $900,000 plus compound interest at 6% per annum together with the plaintiff\u2019s costs. These costs were subsequently quantified at over $120,000. 17', 'There is no doubt that the plaintiff has suffered a substantial loss as a result of IL\u2019s breach of the main charterparties.', '10\\u2003IL did not satisfy the arbitration awards, in whole or in part. In January 2018, the plaintiff commenced enforcement proceedings under s 46 of the Arbitration Act (Cap 10, 2002 Rev Ed) read with O 69 r 14 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed). In February 2018, the plaintiff duly secured leave to enforce both awards against IL in the same manner as judgments of the High Court to the same effect. 18', '11\\u2003In March 2018, the plaintiff secured an order to examine the second defendant as director and company secretary of the judgment debtor, ie, IL. 19', 'In April 2018, the plaintiff secured a similar order against the first defendant. 20', 'The first defendant ignored the order for examination. A warrant was accordingly issued for his arrest. He was eventually found in contempt of court. He was fined $8,000 or eight days\u2019 imprisonment in default and ordered to pay the costs of the committal proceedings to the plaintiff on the indemnity basis. The first defendant avoided imprisonment by paying the fine. The first defendant did, however, cooperate in that he gave IL\u2019s financial documents to the second defendant, who produced them to the plaintiff in the enforcement proceedings. Those documents disclosed that IL had nothing of value against which the plaintiff could levy execution. There is no doubt that the plaintiff has suffered a significant amount of aggravation in attempting to recover its judgment debt from IL.', '12\\u2003The plaintiff commenced this action in February 2019. The principal relief which the plaintiff seeks in this action is a declaration under s 340(1) of the Act that each defendant is personally liable to the plaintiff for the full value of IL\u2019s judgment debt. 21', '13\\u2003The trial of this action took place in November 2020. This judgment is delivered in April 2021. Section 340(1) of the Act was in force when the plaintiff commenced this action. With effect from 30 July 2020, however, s 340(1) of the Act was repealed and replaced by s 238(1) of the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act 2018 (Act 40 of 2018) (\u201cthe IRDA\u201d). The plaintiff\u2019s claim for relief is therefore being decided at a time when s 340(1) of the Act is no longer in force. The question which arises is whether it is s 340(1) of the Act or s 238(1) of the IRDA which applies to the plaintiff\u2019s claim.', '14\\u2003The IRDA makes transitional provisions for corporate insolvency in s 526 and s 527. These transitional provisions allow the Act to continue to apply in specified circumstances to certain applications, orders, windings up and persons as though the IRDA had not been enacted. An application under s 340(1) of the Act does not come within either s 526 or s 527 of the IRDA. That suggests on its face that the parties\u2019 rights and liabilities in issue in this action are governed with effect from 30 July 2020 by s 238(1) of the IRDA instead of s 340(1) of the Act. But it would be in principle wrong for rights and liabilities which arose in or around July 2015 to be governed retrospectively by legislation which was not to come into effect until more than five years later. \u201cSimple fairness\u201d is the basis for the presumption against the retrospective application of legislation: ABU v Comptroller of Income Tax [2015] 2 SLR 420 at [73], citing L\u2019Office Chefifien Des Phosphates v Yamashita-Shinnihon Steamship Co Ltd [1994] 1 AC 486 at 525.', '15\\u2003Fortunately, s 16(1)(c) of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed) operates to ensure that s 340(1) of the Companies Act continues to apply to this action. That section provides as follows:', 'I do not consider that Parliament\u2019s omission of any specific reference to s 340(1) of the Act in s 526 and s 527 of the IRDA manifests a contrary intention within the meaning of s 16(1)(c) of the Interpretation Act with respect to the effect of the repeal of s 340(1) of the Act.', '16\\u2003I therefore proceed on the basis that the parties\u2019 rights and liabilities in issue in this action continue to be governed by s 340(1) of the Companies Act despite its repeal. Even if that is not the case, the potential for retrospectivity has no practical significance in this action. Section 340(1) of the Act and s 238(1) of the IRDA are identical in all respects which are material to the rights and liabilities in issue in this action.', '17\\u2003For convenience, I shall proceed as though I am deciding the plaintiff\u2019s claim in February 2019, when the plaintiff commenced this action, at a time when s 340 of the Act was still in force.', '18\\u2003Section 340(1) of the Act provides as follows:', 'As convenient shorthand, I shall use the interchangeable terms \u201cfraudulent trading\u201d or \u201ctrading fraudulently\u201d to refer to the carrying on of any of a company\u2019s business \u201cwith intent to defraud creditors of the company or creditors of any other person or for any fraudulent purpose\u201d within the meaning of s 340(1) of the Act.', '19\\u2003The plaintiff\u2019s case is as follows. IL was trading fraudulently when it entered into the main charterparties. Each defendant was knowingly a party to IL trading fraudulently. 22', 'IL was insolvent in or around July 2015, at the time it entered into the charterparties. This is circumstantial evidence from which to draw inferences against both the defendants under s 340 of the Act.', '20\\u2003The first defendant\u2019s case is as follows. IL was not trading fraudulently when it entered into the main charterparties. It arranged back-to-back subcharterparties with BMI at a profit. This meant that IL had an honest belief that it would be able to pay the plaintiff the sums due under the main charterparties out of the sums which IL was due to receive from BMI under the subcharterparties. 23', 'The first defendant also denies that IL was insolvent in or around July 2015. The subcharterparties provided IL with the revenue to pay the hire due to the plaintiff under the main charterparties as the hire fell due. 24', '21\\u2003The second defendant\u2019s pleaded case is as follows. The second defendant was not involved in IL\u2019s day-to-day operations. 25', 'He was not therefore involved in or aware of its decision to enter into the main charterparties. He was also not aware of the arbitrations and enforcement proceedings which followed them. 26', 'IL was not insolvent in or around July 2015. 27', 'Even if it was insolvent, he had no reason to believe that it was insolvent. 28', 'Therefore, the second defendant did not behave dishonestly or fraudulently in connection with IL\u2019s entry into the main charterparties. 29', '22\\u2003The second defendant elected to call no evidence at trial to establish his pleaded defence. He submits, however, that the plaintiff\u2019s case against him is so weak that it ought to be dismissed despite this election.', '23\\u2003The second defendant, in addition, takes a preliminary, procedural objection. He submits that the plaintiff\u2019s action should be dismissed in limine because the plaintiff has failed to comply with the procedural requirements for invoking the court\u2019s declaratory jurisdiction under s 340(1) of the Act.', '24\\u2003Given the manner in which the parties have presented their cases, there are four issues which I must determine:'"}

I recount the facts briefly here.', '4\\u2003The applicant claimed trial to three charges:', '(a)\\u2003Consuming monoacetylmorphine, a Specified Drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (\u201cMDA\u201d), without authorisation under the said Act, an offence under s 8(b)(ii) of the MDA (\u201cCharge 1\u201d).', '(b)\\u2003Consuming methamphetamine, a Specified Drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the MDA, without authorisation under the said Act, an offence under s 8(b)(ii) of the MDA (\u201cCharge 2\u201d).', '(c)\\u2003Possession of one straw containing not less than 0.22g of diamorphine, a controlled drug specified in Class A of the First Schedule of the MDA, without authorisation under the said Act, an offence under s 8(a) of the MDA (\u201cCharge 3\u201d).', 'The offences in Charges 1 and 2 were punishable under s 33A(2) of the MDA as the applicant had a previous conviction in DAC-53787-2006 for consumption of buprenorphine for which he was punished under s 33A(1) of the MDA.', '5\\u2003The drugs that formed the subject matter of Charge 3 were in the applicant\u2019s possession on 28 March 2018. The applicant was at Block 541 Bedok North Street 3 #03-1232 and was searched by officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (\u201cCNB\u201d). The CNB officers found a straw containing diamorphine in the right pocket of the applicant\u2019s trousers.', '6\\u2003The applicant was arrested and brought to the CNB office where his urine sample was procured. The applicant\u2019s urine samples were sealed and correctly identified with his particulars. The applicant challenged the urine procurement process but the District Judge (\u201cthe DJ\u201d) rejected his allegations and found that \u201cthe urine samples of the [applicant] were procured in accordance with the requirement for the procurement of urine procedure set out in MDA and the Regulations\u201d: GD at [17]. The DJ also found that there was no leakage in the applicant\u2019s urine samples. The applicant\u2019s urine samples were analysed and found to contain monoacetylmorphine and methamphetamine, the drugs that formed the subject matter of Charges 1 and 2 respectively.', '7\\u2003In several statements made during the investigations, the applicant admitted that he had possession of the straw of diamorphine (Charge 3) and that he had consumed heroin and ice (a street name for methamphetamine). At the trial, the applicant attempted to challenge the voluntariness of these statements. However, at the end of the ancillary hearing, the DJ found that the applicant\u2019s challenge was baseless. The DJ thus admitted the statements into evidence and placed full weight on the admissions therein.', '8\\u2003Based on the above, the DJ convicted the applicant on all three charges. On the question of sentence, the DJ imposed seven years\u2019 imprisonment and six strokes of the cane each for Charges 1 and 2 and eight months\u2019 imprisonment for Charge 3. The sentences for Charges 2 and 3 were ordered to run consecutively. The aggregate sentence for the applicant was therefore seven years and eight months\u2019 imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane.', '9\\u2003In MA 9309, the applicant appealed against his conviction and sentence. The applicant\u2019s position at the appeal was essentially the same as that which he took at the trial. In summary, the applicant argued that the DJ erred in (a) finding that he had given the statements voluntarily; (b) failing to hold against the Prosecution its failure to produce \u201cmissing\u201d CCTV footage of the urine procurement process; (c) finding that there was no impropriety in the urine procurement process; and (d) finding that the applicant was in possession of the straw of diamorphine.', '10\\u2003On 24 July 2020, I affirmed the DJ\u2019s decision and dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal against his conviction and sentence.', '11\\u2003About six months later, on 11 January 2021, the applicant filed a criminal motion (\u201cthe first CM\u201d). In the first CM, the relief sought by the applicant was unclear.

At the CMC, the applicant confirmed that he was seeking a review of the decision in MA 9309 and that he would refile his application. The first CM was therefore rejected administratively with the applicant\u2019s consent.', '12\\u2003On 5 March 2021, the applicant filed the present application.

Mr Han and the defendant eventually agreed terms on a series of investments in the Biomax Group. 5', '8\\u2003The plaintiff and Mr Han decided that the plaintiff would be the contracting party for this series of investments. It is not in dispute, however, that the money which the plaintiff lent to the Biomax Group ultimately came from Mr Han.

The plaintiff\u2019s case is that the defendant made the following four oral representations (\u201cthe Representations\u201d) to Mr Han and to her during these discussions:', '(a)\\u2003That BT required more money to manufacture enzyme digestor machines (\u201cthe Funding Representation\u201d); 8', '(b)\\u2003That BT would use any money which the plaintiff and Mr Han lent to BT for the sole purpose of manufacturing enzyme digestor machines (\u201cthe Sole Use Representation\u201d); 9', '(c)\\u2003That: (i) with additional money, BT would be able to manufacture a significant number of enzyme digestor machines; (ii) BT had secured orders for enzyme digestor machines but was unable to meet those orders only because it lacked money; and therefore (iii) BT could sell at least ten enzyme digestor machines in 2015 (\u201cthe Sales Representation\u201d); 10', 'and', '(d)\\u2003That BT was making profits and that its projected profits for 2016 would be even higher than its profits in 2015 (\u201cthe Profitability Representation\u201d). 11', '14\\u2003At trial, Ms Chua gave evidence for the plaintiff as to her recollection of what was said at the July 2015 meeting. She gave evidence under subpoena, but after having affirmed an affidavit of evidence in chief. 12', '15\\u2003The plaintiff initially pleaded that the defendant had made four additional representations. The plaintiff has clarified that these representations are pleaded by way of background and not as actionable representations in their own right. I shall therefore refer to them as \u201cthe Background Representations\u201d. Some of the Background Representations contain specific figures. For example, one of the Background Representations alleges that the defendant made a representation specifying the cost, sale price and manufacturing lead time of the enzyme digestor machines. 13', 'Another Background Representation alleges that the defendant specified the interest rate that BT was willing to pay and the percentage of shares in BT that the Biomax Group would transfer to the plaintiff in return for additional loans. 14'"}
{"casename":"2021_SGHC_85","fact":"'2\\u2003The facts of the present case are heavily disputed, with each parties\u2019 case drawing support from the perceived nature of their pre-existing relationship. Essentially, the plaintiff claims that the background facts show that: (a) the parties had a pre-existing close friendship, and (b) the defendant was the controlling mind of Univen. The defendant denies both claims and argues that: (a) the parties were not friends and merely shared a commercial relationship, and (b) the plaintiff was the controlling mind of Univen. Wherever possible, I will first set out the agreed facts and then present each parties\u2019 version of the facts. Also, while I have considered both parties\u2019 versions of the facts, parties often delved extensively into facts that are irrelevant to the issues at hand. Where that is the case, I find it unnecessary to set them out in my reasoning here.', '3\\u2003The plaintiff and the defendant are both businessmen. They were introduced to each other by a mutual acquaintance in 2013. 1', 'At that time, the defendant was the director and shareholder of Agrocon (S) Pte Ltd (\u201cAgrocon\u201d), which was in the business of trading commodities. 2', 'Subsequently, one of the plaintiff\u2019s companies, Boeki Auto & Marine Pte Ltd (\u201cBoeki\u201d), had business dealings with Agrocon. 3', 'The plaintiff was appointed a director of Boeki on 23 February 2004 and he owned half the total shares in Boeki. 4', '4\\u2003The background facts relating to Agrocon and Agrocon\u2019s business dealings are disputed. The plaintiff claims that Agrocon had owed a debt of about S$200,000 to Boeki. 5', 'The plaintiff contends that, because the defendant needed monies for Agrocon\u2019s business, the defendant requested a loan of S$160,000 from the plaintiff (the \u201cAlleged S$160,000 Loan\u201d) sometime in November 2013. 6', 'The plaintiff claims that the defendant repaid this loan. 7', 'In contrast, the defendant denies having obtained the Alleged S$160,000 Loan from the plaintiff. Instead, the defendant claims that this sum was the plaintiff\u2019s investment in Agrocon at that time.', '5\\u2003The plaintiff also claims that the defendant had requested a loan of S$50,0000 (the \u201cAlleged S$50,000 Loan\u201d) on 5 March 2014 as the defendant needed money for his business in Agrocon, and Boeki granted that loan. 8', 'Again, the defendant claims that this sum was the plaintiff\u2019s investment in Agrocon. 9', '6\\u2003In March 2014, the defendant went to Batam for a few months 10', '. The parties dispute the reason for his trip. The plaintiff claims that the defendant fled to Batam due to Agrocon\u2019s debts and legal troubles. 11', 'The plaintiff then went to Batam to help the defendant resolve Agrocon\u2019s issues so that he could recover Agrocon\u2019s debts owing to Boeki. 12', 'The defendant denies that he fled to Batam or that he had any financial or legal problems; instead, he claims that he travelled to Batam to attend to his company in Indonesia, PT Maxal Management. 13', 'The defendant subsequently returned to Singapore from Batam on 25 August 2014. 14', 'Parties contest the circumstances of the defendant\u2019s return. The plaintiff claims that the defendant was arrested upon his arrival in Singapore. Because of their alleged friendship, the plaintiff purportedly helped the defendant in his bail arrangements and accompanied the defendant to the police station every month. 15', 'The plaintiff further claims that, because the defendant had asked him for help with finding accommodation in Singapore, the plaintiff arranged for the defendant to stay at a condominium apartment owned by the plaintiff\u2019s sister-in-law. 16', 'The defendant denies that he was arrested upon his arrival in Singapore, that he requested for help in finding accommodation, and that the plaintiff had made the housing arrangements out of goodwill or friendship. In respect of the last point, the defendant claims that the plaintiff had insisted that he rent the apartment and he had to pay rent in any case. 17', '7\\u2003On 3 October 2014, Univen was incorporated. At the time of incorporation, the plaintiff was both a director and a shareholder of Univen (holding one of two shares) and the defendant was a director with no shareholding in Univen. 18', 'The defendant\u2019s wife was a director and a shareholder (holding one of two shares). 19', 'Like Agrocon, Univen was in the business of trading commodities. 20', '8\\u2003Parties dispute the motive behind the setting up of Univen. The plaintiff claims that the defendant had proposed to set up a business so that he could be gainfully employed and to earn money to pay off his existing debts. 21', 'The plaintiff asserts that, because of their friendship and trust, he agreed to set up Univen with the defendant. 22', 'The defendant claims instead that the purpose of incorporating Univen was so that the plaintiff could channel funds that were meant to go to Agrocon into Univen, so that Agrocon could evade paying its creditors. 23', 'In this way, Boeki could recoup their loss of investment in Agrocon, and to profit from this new business venture. 24', '9\\u2003Parties vigorously dispute who the controlling mind of Univen was. In this regard, parties seek to introduce a voluminous amount of background facts.', '10\\u2003The plaintiff claims that, despite the defendant not being a shareholder of Univen, the defendant had total control of Univen and had ran its day to day operations. 25', 'In support of this claim, the plaintiff claims that \u201c[a]ll the material Univen cheques issued were signed by the Defendant\u201d, and referred the court to three sums that were \u201capplied to resolve the Defendant\u2019s dealings\u201d. 26', 'I pause to note that it is unclear as to what the plaintiff meant, and in any case, the evidence referred to by counsel was only Univen\u2019s bank account transaction details without more. The plaintiff also relies on the testimony of two witnesses to corroborate his claim that the defendant was the controlling mind of Univen. Firstly, Mark Sivaraj (\u201cMark\u201d) testified that the defendant had interviewed and hired him as an operations executive of Univen in 2015. 27', 'Mark stated that he reported to the defendant and took instructions from him. Secondly, Nikhil Singh (\u201cNikhil\u201d) testified that as the head trader of Gautam Vanijya Private Limited (\u201cGautam\u201d), he dealt with the defendant on the basis that the defendant had represented to him that the defendant was the sole controlling mind and sole representative of Univen. 28', 'The plaintiff further seeks to rely on the defendant\u2019s admission that Univen had paid for the loan instalments of a car (SKP1319K) that the defendant had used, but which was owned by Wang Lai Construction Engineering Pte Ltd (\u201cWang Lai\u201d). 29', '11\\u2003Unsurprisingly, the defendant denies that he was the controlling mind of Univen and contends instead that he merely executed the plaintiff\u2019s instructions in Univen, despite being a director in name. 30', 'The defendant raises the following points in support. 31', 'Firstly, the plaintiff was a director of Univen during the period in which the Sums were transferred, from 2015 to 2017. Secondly, during this period, the plaintiff had increased his shareholding to 299,999 shares, with the remaining one share being held by the defendant\u2019s wife. Thirdly, the plaintiff went on multiple overseas business trips for Univen, which was confirmed by Chiu Chee Beng (\u201cChiu\u201d), a former business development manager of Univen, and Mark. Lastly, the plaintiff had interviewed Chiu and offered him a job in Univen, which evidences his control of Univen.', '12\\u2003The plaintiff further alleged that the defendant had set up other corporate entities that begin with the letter \u201cU\u201d, and in all these entities, the defendant had managed these businesses despite not being a shareholder. 32', 'Accordingly, Univen, being a similar company beginning with the letter \u201cU\u201d, was also managed by the defendant. The defendant points out that the plaintiff did not specify what the other such entities are. In any case, the defendant claims that: (a) there are only two other such entities, (b) the plaintiff was also involved in their incorporation, and (c) the plaintiff was both a director and a shareholder of these entities while the defendant was merely a director. 33', '13\\u2003The plaintiff claims that apart from the Sums (which the plaintiff claims are loans to the defendant), the Alleged S$160,000 Loan, and the Alleged S$50,000 Loan, the defendant had requested a loan of S$84,000 on 10 November 2016 from the plaintiff (\u201cAlleged S$84,000 Loan\u201d). 34', 'The plaintiff asserts that he granted this loan but the defendant had subsequently repaid this loan. 35', '14\\u2003Again, the defendant disputes that this Alleged S$84,000 Loan was a personal loan granted by the plaintiff to him. The defendant claims that this sum was disbursed by the plaintiff to Univen and was applied solely for Univen\u2019s business. 36', 'The defendant had merely helped the plaintiff to cash out the cheque of S$84,000 and to deposit the cash into Univen\u2019s bank account. 37', '15\\u2003As set out above, the plaintiff claims that he and the defendant were close friends, which was why he had: (a) arranged for the defendant\u2019s bail arrangements upon his return to Singapore from Batam, (b) accompanied the defendant to the police station, (c) set up Univen for the defendant, and (d) had a prior history of granting personal loans to the defendant, viz, the Alleged S$160,000 Loan, the Alleged S$50,000 Loan, and the Alleged S$84,000 Loan. In response, the defendant rejects these points as being factually inaccurate and claimed that there was no such friendship.', '16\\u2003In addition to the above disputed points, the plaintiff and the defendant raise further facts in support of their arguments regarding whether they had a pre-existing friendship. Again, I note only the relevant facts. Among other things, the plaintiff claims that, on 1 May 2015, the defendant had invited him and his wife to attend the defendant\u2019s child\u2019s baptism. 38', 'The defendant does not dispute this. Conversely, the defendant claims, inter alia, that when the defendant was married on 25 March 2014, he did not invite the plaintiff to his wedding and the plaintiff did not know about the wedding. 39', 'The plaintiff admits that this was the case. 40', '17\\u2003On 12 May 2015, a cash cheque of S$100,000 was signed on behalf of Wang Lai. The defendant needed to transfer this S$100,000 Sum urgently on that day to Thangavelu LLC, the law firm of the defendant\u2019s former solicitor, as the sum was required for one of the defendant\u2019s legal proceedings. 41', 'The transfer was done on that day. Save for a payment voucher that the plaintiff adduces, there are no written documents evidencing a loan agreement. 42', 'These facts are not disputed.', '18\\u2003However, parties dispute the circumstances before and after the transfer of the S$100,000 Sum and the motive for the transfer of the sum.', '19\\u2003The plaintiff claims that the defendant had asked him for a loan of S$100,000 and the plaintiff granted him the S$100,000 Sum as a personal loan, on account of their friendship. 43', 'The plaintiff avers that he signed the cash cheque of S$100,000 on behalf of Wang Lai, as one of Wang Lai\u2019s authorised signatories. 44', 'The plaintiff claims that the defendant\u2019s then solicitor, Mr Thangavelu from Thangavelu LLC, had contacted him on the morning of 12 May 2015 and told him that the $100,000 Sum had to be transferred to Thangavelu LLC\u2019s client account by 12.00pm. 45', 'Given the urgency of the matter, the plaintiff used Wang Lai to effect the transfer of S$100,000 Sum because he knew that both Wang Lai and Thangavelu LLC had United Overseas Bank (\u201cUOB\u201d) accounts, 46', 'and such an intra-bank transfer would be faster. 47', 'The plaintiff also claims that he personally effected the transfer of the S$100,000 Sum at a UOB branch, and his staff member, Ms Cuevas Annabelle Molina (\u201cAnn\u201d), prepared a payment voucher. 48', 'Subsequently, the plaintiff transferred S$100,000 from his personal bank account to Wang Lai\u2019s bank account. 49', '20\\u2003The defendant rejects the above narrative and presents the following version of events. The S$100,000 Sum was a gift by Wang Lai that does not have to be repaid. 50', 'The transfer of this S$100,000 Sum was allegedly arranged by Mookkiah Rajanayagam (\u201cMookkiah\u201d), a director of Wang Lai since its incorporation. 51', 'On 12 May 2015, Mookkiah called the defendant to collect the cheque from Wang Lai\u2019s office, and the defendant did so. The plaintiff did not sign the cash cheque for the S$100,000 Sum. 52', 'Thereafter, the defendant, not the plaintiff, went to UOB to deposit the cheque into Thangavelu LLC\u2019s client account. After doing so, the defendant immediately took a photograph of the deposit slip and emailed it to Mr Thangavelu on the same day at 1.47pm. The defendant then went to Wang Lai\u2019s office to pass the original carbon copy of the deposit slip to a staff member. The defendant alleges that this gift was motivated by a pre-existing \u201cgood and mutually beneficial business relationship, which existed even before Univen\u2019s incorporation\u201d [emphasis in original] between the defendant and Wang Lai. 53', '21\\u2003On 31 August 2015, the plaintiff issued a cash cheque for the sum of S$62,677.50. 54', 'The cheque was prepared by Ann and passed to the defendant. 55', 'Ann also prepared a payment voucher dated on the same day. 56', 'There were no written documents evidencing a loan agreement. These facts are not disputed.', '22\\u2003Parties dispute the purpose of issuing the cash cheque for the S$62,677.50 Sum.', '23\\u2003The plaintiff claims that sometime earlier in August 2015, the defendant requested for the plaintiff to loan him funds to carry out business transactions. The plaintiff then agreed to lend the S$62,677.50 Sum to the defendant. 57', '24\\u2003The defendant claims that the S$62,677.50 Sum was not a personal loan, but a capital injection into Univen so that Univen could pay one of its suppliers in Vietnam, Vinafood. On 29 July 2015, the defendant sent an email titled \u201cVietnam Suppliers link\u201d to the plaintiff, which contained a link that purports to be Vinafood\u2019s website. 58', 'Univen then placed an order with Western Union for the electronic transfer of US$44,375, equivalent to S$62,677.50. 59', 'According to the defendant, the breakdown of the S$62,677.50 was as follows: the amount due from Univen to Vinafood was US$44,375, which was equivalent to S$62,657.50, and there was additional S$20 fee charged by Western Union for the transfer. 60', 'Subsequently, the plaintiff then instructed the defendant to cash out the cheque for the S$62,677.50 Sum on 1 September 2015 and to deposit the cash into Univen\u2019s bank account on the same day. 61', '25\\u2003On 29 June 2017, the plaintiff issued a cheque in his own name to the defendant for the sum of S$131,376. 62', 'Ann issued a payment voucher for that sum on the same day. 63', 'There were no written documents evidencing a loan agreement.

Third, how to divide the property at 38 Oxley Road (\u201cthe Oxley property\u201d) in the most practical manner.', '8\\u2003In the second section of the 4 June 2015 Email, Ms Kwa then listed three points on the Oxley property. First, that all six wills provided for the Oxley property to be given to Mr LHL. Second, that Dr LWL\u2019s right to stay at the Oxley property changed between the First and Fourth Wills. In the Fifth and Sixth Wills, Dr LWL had a right to stay at the Oxley property subject to Mr LHL\u2019s consent, and Mr Lee had instructed Ms Kwa to insert a specific paragraph that stipulated that Dr LWL had no life interest in the Oxley property. Third, that a clause providing for the Oxley property to be demolished either upon Mr Lee\u2019s passing or after Dr LWL had moved out, whichever was later (\u201cthe Demolition Clause\u201d), was removed in the Fifth and Sixth Wills. 5', '9\\u2003In this same section, Ms Kwa stated: 6', '10\\u2003Finally, Ms Kwa gave a chronological account of events from 7 December 1995 to 2 November 2012, taking the form of a ten-point summary, (a) to (j). 7', '11\\u2003Subsequently, and after receipt of further queries from Mr LHL and Dr LWL, Ms Kwa wrote another email on 22 June 2015 to the three beneficiaries (the \u201c22 June 2015 Email\u201d). This email carried the subject header \u201cEstate of Lee Kuan Yew\u201d and read as follows: 8', '12\\u2003On 24 June 2015, the executors\u2019 solicitors wrote to Ms Kwa to note that the documents and information relating to the past wills of Mr Lee were the subject of attorney-client privilege and confidential.

The defendant alleges that these \nEOTs should not have been granted and were only granted due to the conspiracy \nbetween the plaintiff and the third party to injure him.\n(1) EOT 1\n16 The defendant asserts that the plaintiff and the third party conspired to \ninjure him in relation to EOT 1, which concerned the delay in marble delivery.27 \nHe alleges that the third party would have proceeded to grant EOT 1 but for the \nintervention of Mr Cheung, one of the defendant\u2019s Assistants,28 when he \nenquired during a site meeting whether the delay in marble delivery was on the \ncritical path, ie, an event that may delay the completion of the Project. Since the \ndelay in marble delivery was a non-critical activity, it did not contractually \nentitle the plaintiff to an EOT. Faced with Mr Cheung\u2019s objections, the third \nparty had no choice but to reject EOT 1. Thus, the defendant submits that EOT 1 \nsupports his allegation that the third party had conspired with the plaintiff to \ngrant EOTs.\n25 18AB11628.\n26 Joint List of Agreed Facts at para 7c; 18AB11629.\n27 NEs, 30 January 2019 at p 101, lines 7\u20139.\n28 NEs, 30 January 2019 at p 101.\nVersion No 1: 19 Jan 2021 (15:48 hrs)\nGTMS Construction Pte Ltd v Ser Kim Koi[2021] SGHC 9\n10(2) EOT 2\n17 In relation to EOT 2, the defendant submits that the third party had no \nbasis to grant EOT 2. Among other things, this was because the plaintiff had \nfailed to exercise due diligence, a pre-condition required by cl 23(1) of the SIA \nConditions and, thus, was not entitled to any EOT.29 While the third party took \ninto account SPPG\u2019s delay in electrical turn-on, it failed to consider the \nplaintiff\u2019s own delay in the electrical installation works which had to be done \nbefore SPPG could connect the incoming power supply. Pursuant to the \nProject\u2019s Master Programme, the plaintiff was required to complete the \nconstruction of the electrical meter compartments by or prior to 9 July 2012.30 \nHowever, the electrical meter compartment doors for Units 12 and 12B were \nonly installed on or around 1 December 2012.31 Due to this delay of more than \nfour and a half months, the defendant claims that the plaintiff should not have \nbeen given any EOT. \n18 The defendant also relies on the circumstances surrounding EOT 2 \nwhich, in his view, suggested that the result of EOT 2 was pre-determined. \nThese circumstances were as follows:\n(a) The third party had \u201cdirected\u201d the plaintiff to include further \ndetails in its request in EOT 2 and had also given the plaintiff \u201cfurther \ndirections to regularise various errors made in its substantiation of the \nsaid EOT request\u201d.32 \n29 DWS at para 194.\n30 Defendant\u2019s Consolidated Third Party Statement of Claim (Amendment No 2) \n(\u201cDTPSOC\u201d) at para 13A(c).\n31 NEs, 21 November 2018 at p 115, lines 4\u201313; NEs, 2 June 2020 at p 117, lines 22\u201324.\n32 DTPSOC at para 17(e).\nVersion No 1: 19 Jan 2021 (15:48 hrs)\nGTMS Construction Pte Ltd v Ser Kim Koi[2021] SGHC 9\n11(b) When the plaintiff\u2019s request in EOT 2 was circulated to CCA for \n\u201cconfirmation\u201d, a pre-drafted approval was enclosed and CCA was only \ngiven one day to respond to the plaintiff\u2019s request.33\n(c) Prior to the third party\u2019s grant of EOT 2, F+G had recommended \nin its cost report an estimated $65,000 additional costs due to the \nplaintiff on the basis of EOT 2.34\n19  In court, the defendant further alleged that the plaintiff, CCA and the \nthird party had colluded or conspired to grant EOT 2. The defendant also alleged \nthat the plaintiff had applied improper pressure on or interfered with the third \nparty.35\n(3) EOT 3\n20 In relation to EOT 3, the defendant likewise submits that the third party \nhad no basis to grant EOT 3. Prior to electrical turn-on, SPPG had to conduct \ntesting and inspection on-site. The first round of testing and inspection was \nconducted on 14, 20 and 21 March 2013 (the \u201cFirst Testing and Inspection\u201d) for \nUnits 12B, 12 and 12A respectively.36 The Project failed the First Testing and \nInspection. The defendant\u2019s position is that the reasons for the failure were due \nto construction-related issues caused by the plaintiff.37 Consequently, the \nplaintiff had to rectify these construction-related issues before the Project \npassed the second round of testing and inspection conducted on 27 March, \n33 DTPSOC at para 17(h).\n34 DTPSOC at para 17(h).\n35 NEs, 18 February 2020 at p 27, line 9 to p 31, line 15.\n36 Joint List of Agreed Facts at paras 14\u201315; SKK at para 51.\n37 DTPSOC at para 13A(l)(iv).\nVersion No 1: 19 Jan 2021 (15:48 hrs)\nGTMS Construction Pte Ltd v Ser Kim Koi[2021] SGHC 9\n122 April and 8 April 2013 (the \u201cSecond Testing and Inspection\u201d).38 Accordingly, \nthe plaintiff had again failed to exercise due diligence and was not entitled to \nany EOT.39 \n21 As with EOT 2, the defendant also relies on the circumstances \nsurrounding EOT 3 to claim that the result of EOT 3 was pre-determined. In \ncourt, the defendant similarly alleged that the plaintiff, CCA and the third party \nhad colluded or conspired to grant EOT 3. The defendant further alleged that \nthe plaintiff had also applied improper pressure on or interfered with the third \nparty. These circumstances were as follows:\n(a) The plaintiff made its request for EOT 3 on 1 April 2013 and the \nthird party had immediately issued an \u201cin-principle\u201d entitlement the next \nday without prior consultation with CCA.40\n(b) CCA had initially refused the plaintiff\u2019s request for EOT 3. \nHowever, the third party eventually managed to persuade CCA to \nchange its recommendation.41\nCompletion certificate\n22 The defendant submits that the third party and the plaintiff had conspired \nto issue the completion certificate (\u201cCC\u201d) to the plaintiff.\n38 Joint List of Agreed Facts at paras 16\u201318.\n39 DWS at para 499.\n40 DTPSOC at para 17(k).\n41 DTPSOC at para 17(l); DWS at para 542.\nVersion No 1: 19 Jan 2021 (15:48 hrs)\nGTMS Construction Pte Ltd v Ser Kim Koi[2021] SGHC 9\n1323 On 15 May 2013, the third party issued a CC certifying completion of \nthe Project on 17 April 2013 pursuant to cl 24(4) of the SIA Conditions.42 \nClause 24(4) of the SIA Conditions states that the CC \u201cshall be issued by the \n[third party] when the Works appear to be complete and to comply with the \nContract in all respects\u201d.43 Further, cl 24(4) must also be read with the all-\nimportant Item 72 of the \u201cPreliminaries\u201d. The relevant portion of Item 72 of the \nPreliminaries states as follows:44 \nPursuant to the provisions of the Agreement and Conditions of \nContract, a Completion Certificate will not be issued until:\n(a) All parts of the Works are in the Architect\u2019s opinion \nready for occupation and for use.\n(b) All services are tested, commissioned and operating \nsatisfactorily as specified in the Contract or the relevant \nSub-Contract including handing over all test \ncertificates, operating instructions and warranties.\n(c) All works included in the Contract are performed \nincluding such rectification as may be required to bring \nthe work to the completion and standards acceptable to \nthe Architect.\n24 The defendant submits that all three preconditions in Item 72 of the \nPreliminaries were not satisfied when the third party issued the CC. The CC was \nissued prematurely and without basis. Accordingly, this gives rise to an \ninference that the CC was issued by the third party pursuant to a conspiracy \nbetween the third party and the plaintiff.45 \n42 Joint List of Agreed Facts at para 8.\n43 5AB02953.\n44 5AB02574.\n45 DTPSOC at para 21.\nVersion No 1: 19 Jan 2021 (15:48 hrs)\nGTMS Construction Pte Ltd v Ser Kim Koi[2021] SGHC 9\n1425 In relation to Item 72(a) of the Preliminaries, the defendant argues that \nthe Project was not \u201cready for occupation and for use\u201d as the temporary \noccupation permit (\u201cTOP\u201d) for the Project had not been obtained. According to \nthe defendant, it is an implied term of the Contract that the TOP must be \nobtained before the third party can issue the CC.46\n26 Furthermore, the Project failed the TOP inspection conducted by the \nBuilding and Construction Authority (\u201cBCA\u201d) on 30 April 2013 (\u201cTOP \nInspection 1\u201d).47 This was prior to the date the CC was issued on 15 May 2013. \nThe Project had also failed the BCA\u2019s second TOP inspection on 18 June 2013 \n(\u201cTOP Inspection 2\u201d).48 Although the TOP for the Project was eventually \nobtained on 16 September 2013 by way of photographic submissions,49 the \ndefendant alleges that this was the result of the plaintiff\u2019s and the third party\u2019s \nfraud and\/or misrepresentation.50 In particular, the steps and risers in the Project \nremain non-compliant with statutory requirements and the Project is therefore \nstill not \u201cready for occupation and for use\u201d as of today. \n27 As for Item 72(b) of the Preliminaries, the defendant submits that this \nwas not satisfied as the operating instructions and warranties were only handed \nover by the plaintiff to the defendant on 22 June 2014, while the test certificates \n46 DTPSOC at para 22.\n47 Joint List of Agreed Facts at para 12.\n48 Joint List of Agreed Facts at para 13.\n49 DTPSOC at para 23(a).\n50 DWS at para 13.\nVersion No 1: 19 Jan 2021 (15:48 hrs)\nGTMS Construction Pte Ltd v Ser Kim Koi[2021] SGHC 9\n15have not been handed over at all.51 In addition, the T&C for gas,52 electricity,53 \nair conditioning and mechanical ventilation (\u201cACMV\u201d)54 and swimming pool \nservices55 had not been carried out as of the date when the Project was certified \nto be complete. \n28 Finally, with regard to Item 72(c) of the Preliminaries, the defendant \nasserts that there were many outstanding defects as of the date the Project was \ncertified to be complete. These defects were identified and described in the \nreports prepared by Building Appraisals Pte Ltd (\u201cBAPL\u201d), whom the defendant \nengaged sometime in October 2013. These defects were as follows:\n(a) The gas pipe along the driveway at the front gate of Unit 12A of \nthe Project was punctured.56\n(b) There were numerous cracks, scratches, and other forms of \ndamage to the Volakas marble flooring in the Project.57\n(c) There were numerous cracks and splinters in the ironwood used \nfor the installation of the timber decking in the Project.58\n51 DWS at para 156.\n52 DWS at paras 144\u2013146.\n53 DWS at paras 141\u2013143.\n54 DWS at paras 147\u2013152.\n55 DWS at paras 153\u2013155.\n56 DWS at paras 273\u2013287.\n57 DWS at paras 332\u2013370.\n58 DWS at paras 371\u2013390.\nVersion No 1: 19 Jan 2021 (15:48 hrs)\nGTMS Construction Pte Ltd v Ser Kim Koi[2021] SGHC 9\n16(d) There were dents and tonality differences in the Indian rosewood \ntimber floor finish.59\n(e) The aluminium cappings on the rooftops of all three units of the \nProject were dented, scratched and finished with patchy and splotchy \npaintwork.60\n(f) The steps and risers of the Project were non-compliant with the \nstatutory and contractual requirements.61\n(g) The swimming pools in the Project were leaking.62\n(h) There were only seven trellis beams constructed at Unit 12B of \nthe Project, instead of eight as required by the Contract.63\n(i) The coating of the intumescent paint on the steelworks at the \nProject did not have a fire resistance of two hours, as required by the \nContract.

In support of this argument, the defendant points to the following: \n(a) Firstly, the defendant was allegedly only given three days by the \nthird party to prepare his list of outstanding defects.72 \n(b) Secondly, the third party also failed to issue the \u201cSchedule of \nDefects\u201d within 14 days of the expiry of the maintenance period, in \naccordance with cl 27(2) of the SIA Conditions.73 \n(c) Thirdly, although the defendant submitted photographs of the \ndefects to the third party on or around April 2014 and 27 July 2014, the \nplaintiff allegedly wrote to the third party to urge them not to accept \nthese photographs.74\n(d) Finally, the third party issued the MC without having regard to \nBAPL\u2019s report.75\n72 DTPSOC at para 35(a).\n73 DTPSOC at para 35(a).\n74 DDCC at para 48b.\n75 DDCC at para 48c.\nVersion No 1: 19 Jan 2021 (15:48 hrs)\nGTMS Construction Pte Ltd v Ser Kim Koi[2021] SGHC 9\n19Payment certificates\n32 The defendant also alleges that the three payment certificates were \nissued by the third party pursuant to the conspiracy between the plaintiff and the \nthird party. These three certificates were issued after the issuance of the CC:\n(a) Interim Certificate No 25 dated 3 September 2013 (\u201cIC25\u201d) was \nissued pursuant to the plaintiff\u2019s Payment Claim No 25, certifying a sum \nof $390,951.96 (excluding goods and services tax (\u201cGST\u201d)).76\n(b) Interim Certificate No 26 dated 6 November 2013 (\u201cIC26\u201d) was \nissued pursuant to the plaintiff\u2019s Payment Claim No 26, certifying a sum \nof $189,250.21 (excluding GST).77 \n(c) Final Certificate dated 22 June 2015 (\u201cFC\u201d) was issued pursuant \nto the plaintiff\u2019s final payment claim of $451,494.54 (excluding GST).78 \nThis sum is the balance between the final measurement and valuation of \nthe Works in accordance with the Statement of Final Account and the \nsums that were previously certified by the third party.\n33 The defendant alleges that the third party failed to independently verify \nthat the Works claimed by the plaintiff had been executed in accordance with \nthe Project\u2019s contractual requirements. In particular, the third party failed to \nwithhold the costs of outstanding works stated in the schedule of the CC until \nsuch time as the outstanding works were completed (see cl 24(5) of the SIA \n76 24AB15391; Joint List of Agreed Facts at para 4.\n77 27AB16885; Joint List of Agreed Facts at para 6.\n78 39AB24980.\nVersion No 1: 19 Jan 2021 (15:48 hrs)\nGTMS Construction Pte Ltd v Ser Kim Koi[2021] SGHC 9\n20Conditions).79 The third party also ought to have certified liquidated damages in \neither IC25 or IC26 given the outstanding works and unrectified defects.80 The \nthird party also should have taken into account in the FC the sums that the \ndefendant was entitled to deduct from the moneys due to the plaintiff because \nof the outstanding works and unrectified defects.81 \n34 The defendant also asserts that the release of the first half of the retention \nmoneys in IC25 was certified by the third party without basis, given that the \nplaintiff had not satisfied the requirements in cl 24(4) of the SIA Conditions and \nItem 72 of the Preliminaries for the issuance of the CC.82\n35 Finally, the defendant argues that the third party failed to properly \naccount for the Prime Cost Sums (the \u201cPC Sums\u201d) and Prime Cost Rate items \n(the \u201cPC Rate items\u201d) claimed by the plaintiff under the Project.

As a result, the intervener claims to have a beneficial interest in the Property. She also claims that the applicant has no beneficial interest in the Property. Taking these claims together, an affirmative determination of the applicant\u2019s interest in the Property may result in the dilution of the intervener\u2019s interest. Hence, the learned Assistant Registrar granted her leave to intervene in this matter in HC\/SUM 5511\/2019. 10', '8\\u2003Parties seek to introduce facts pertaining to a few irrelevant issues, including: (a) whether the intervener is entitled to the sale proceeds of the Tampines Flat, (b) whether there was an agreement between the respondent and the intervener that the respondent will purchase another property for their family using the sale proceeds of the Tampines Flat, and (c) whether the respondent used the sale proceeds of the Tampines Flat to purchase the Property. I pause to state that these issues are irrelevant to the present proceedings. While they may be relevant to the division of matrimonial assets in the divorce proceedings between the respondent and the intervener (see above at [4]), they are clearly irrelevant to the determination of the applicant\u2019s share in the Property. I therefore find it unnecessary to set out these facts in my reasoning here.', '9\\u2003The crux of the matter is whether the applicant has a beneficial interest in the Property, and if so, what the extent of that interest is.

Conversely, the respondent will not own any property after selling the Tampines Flat. The applicant claims that, at that time, she was worried about \u201cspeculation that the government may impose second property stamp duties\u201d. 14', 'She also claims that if she were to hold the Property jointly with the respondent, an additional property tax of 3% would be levied on the Property as it would be her second property. 15', 'Since the Property was purchased as an investment, they decided that it was more commercially sound for the respondent to hold the Property in his sole name. 16', '13\\u2003Secondly, when the selling price of the Property rises to S$3,500,000, the Property is to be sold and the sale proceeds are to be shared between them according to the contributions made by each party towards the Property\u2019s purchase and related expenses. 17', '14\\u2003Thirdly, the applicant and respondent were to contribute to the initial payments for the Property\u2019s purchase, and the applicant was to pay for the Property\u2019s mortgage loan repayments and related expenses. 18', 'Such related expenses include insurance premiums, property tax, and general upkeep (eg pest control, grass cutting, pond maintenance, and gutter cleaning). 19', 'To this end, the applicant claims that she has been transferring approximately S$7,000 to S$10,000 every month to the respondent and she is currently still doing so. 20', 'The respondent does not dispute this claim. 21', '15\\u2003The alleged contributions by the applicant and the respondent are summarised in the table below: 22', 'Pursuant to the Alleged Oral Agreement (see [13] above), the applicant\u2019s and the respondent\u2019s beneficial interest in the property are calculated according to their total contributions to the Property\u2019s purchase and related expenses, and this yields the ratio of 73:27.

However, as the difference is not a significant amount, and the effect is to reduce the applicant\u2019s share rather than to increase it, in the circumstances of the case where the intervener may be entitled to part of the respondent\u2019s share, it would be appropriate to accept the applicant\u2019s stated amounts.', '17\\u2003The intervener disputes the existence of the Alleged Oral Agreement.', '18\\u2003In respect of the initial payments towards the Property\u2019s purchase, the intervener claims that the applicant did not contribute (a) the sum of S$30,000 24', 'and (b) the sum of S$45,600 for the payment of stamp duty (see the table at [15]). 25', '19\\u2003In respect of the monthly transfers of moneys from the applicant to the respondent, the intervener rejects the applicant\u2019s and the respondent\u2019s claim that they were used for the Housing Loan repayments.

{"casename":"2021_SGHC_98","fact":"'5\\u2003According to Bernard\u2019s AEIC and the plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim, 2', 'sometime in early 2016, Martin approached Bernard with a business proposition (\u201cthe Vietnam Project\u201d). A Vietnamese party wanted to buy a large quantity of marine gas oil (\u201cMGO\u201d or \u201ccargo\u201d), but Martin did not have the resources to sell it to the Vietnamese buyer. Martin was in fact then on the brink of bankruptcy. (In cross-examination 3', 'Bernard also claimed Martin\u2019s company then owed the plaintiff $500,000.) Martin requested Bernard\u2019s help with the Vietnam Project.', '6\\u2003After due consideration, Bernard decided to participate in the Vietnam Project using vessels belonging to the plaintiff. He would use the plaintiff\u2019s funds to purchase the MGO to sell to the Vietnamese buyer. 4', '7\\u2003Bernard then approached Soo Yong Chieg, known to him as Jack (\u201cJack\u201d), of Bunkers Marine Pte Ltd (\u201cBunkers Marine\u201d) for supply of the MGO. Jack did not trust Martin\u2019s financial standing and he wanted the plaintiff to stand as guarantor for the Vietnam Project should Bunkers Marine agree to be the supplier. After discussions, Bunkers Marine agreed to be the supplier for the Vietnam Project. Martin and Bernard agreed that the plaintiff and the defendant would share the profits on a 50:50 basis. 5', '8\\u2003At the material time, Ong Teck Beng (\u201cDerrick\u201d) was a mutual friend of Bernard and Martin. Derrick operated a company called Searights Maritime Services Pte Ltd (\u201cSearights\u201d), which was then facing financial difficulties and in fact eventually ceased operations. At the time of its closing down, Searights owned several vessels, including the \u201cEustance\u201d, the \u201cSea Frontier\u201d and the \u201cVictoria Strike\u201d (collectively \u201cthe vessels\u201d). The vessels were apparently sold or mortgaged to a company called RS Marine Investments Pte Ltd (\u201cRS Marine\u201d). 6', '9\\u2003Derrick approached Martin to take over the vessels from RS Marine. After a discussion with Martin, Bernard agreed that the vessels would be taken over by the defendant and the plaintiff in equal ownership. 7', 'Martin\u2019s role was to procure the vessels while Bernard would manage the vessels and provide the facilities for the vessels\u2019 operations through Shipmate. Martin was assisted by Lee Cheng Guan (known as \u201cTony\u201d) in the Vietnam Project. Tony was in charge of accounts for the defendant. 8', '10\\u2003Because of the mutual trust between them arising from their decades-long friendship and cooperation on many projects over the years, not to mention that Bernard had known Martin\u2019s father (David Chua) for 30 to 40 years, Martin and Bernard decided it would not be necessary to have Bernard\u2019s name in the agreements made with RS Marine. 9', '11\\u2003Bernard and Martin further agreed that, once full payment was made for the vessels, their ownership would be transferred to a new company jointly owned by them. Towards that intent, a company called MB Marine Pte Ltd (\u201cMB Marine\u201d) was eventually incorporated with Bernard holding 50% of the shares. 10', '12\\u2003Martin managed to persuade the MGO buyer to advance a portion of its payment for the Vietnam Project to procure the vessels. Martin then paid RS Marine the first instalment for the purchase price of the vessels. However, all subsequent instalments save the last two were paid by the plaintiff from the plaintiff\u2019s account. Funds received from the MGO buyer were also taken into the plaintiff\u2019s account and applied towards the purchase of MGO from Bunkers Marine. 11', '13\\u2003Operation of the vessels commenced after Shipmate sourced and hired crew for the vessels. Bernard, however, never had direct contact with the MGO buyer throughout the Vietnam Project. As agreed between them, Martin was the sole point of contact with the buyer, and he updated Bernard on any information or payments from the buyer. 12', '14\\u2003Initially, for any purchase of MGO, the end-buyer would transfer the required funds directly to the plaintiff. Subsequently, this arrangement was changed by Martin such that payment was made to Bunkers Marine by the defendant after the end-buyer had paid the defendant. The change in payment was made on 8 March 2017 without Bernard\u2019s knowledge or consent. 13', '15\\u2003Bernard was disappointed by Martin\u2019s conduct. The two held discussions after which it was agreed as a compromise and moving forward, that the two would incorporate MB Marine to manage the accounts and receive the funds from the Vietnam Project. It was also agreed that upon full payment, the ownership of the vessels would be transferred to MB Marine. Hence, MB Marine was incorporated even before full payment had been made for the purchase price of the vessels. 14', '16\\u2003In the course of the Vietnam Project, Martin introduced a member of his staff called Christine to Bernard. Christine requested that Bernard and the plaintiff support the defendant\u2019s businesses of the retail and supply of oil as she wanted to improve the defendant\u2019s revenue; Bernard agreed. 15', '17\\u2003Consequently, from 2016 onwards, the plaintiff supplied MGO or marine fuel oil (\u201cMFO\u201d) or both to the defendant. Christine would pass to Bernard orders that she received and Bernard would fulfil the orders. Upon delivery of the cargo ordered, the plaintiff would bill the defendant. Documentation for the trades included WhatsApp communications, emails, invoices and delivery orders. These orders were described as retail orders by Bernard. 16', '18\\u2003Without first giving notice or obtaining the plaintiff\u2019s consent, Martin used the defendant\u2019s account to make payment of the last two instalments for the bareboat charter of the vessels. Martin went further and subsequently transferred the vessels to parties other than MB Marine, in breach of his agreement with Bernard. 17', '19\\u2003Disappointed, Bernard decided he did not want to have any more dealings with Martin or the defendant. He requested the defendant to pay all the outstanding sums then due to the plaintiff forthwith. This (according to Bernard) prompted Martin to come up with baseless and unjustified claims against the plaintiff. 18', '20\\u2003Bernard and Martin met on 31 July 2018 (\u201cthe 31 July meeting\u201d) in the presence of Bernard\u2019s brother, Tony and Tan Hock Lian (\u201cTHL\u201d), who is a shareholder of Singaport. At the 31 July meeting, Martin presented Bernard with a financial statement containing, inter alia, management salaries, office rental, loading adjustment and interest owed to RS Marine. The various items totalled USD691,483.77; Bernard was shocked. He deposed that some items listed pertained to allegedly outstanding sums in respect of which the defendant had never issued and delivered valid invoices (contemporaneous or otherwise) to the plaintiff. 19', '21\\u2003Bernard added that the defendant continued to charge such unfounded sums to the plaintiff even after the plaintiff commenced these proceedings in Suit 11 of 2019 (\u201cthe Suit\u201d) on 2 January 2019. 20', '22\\u2003On 12 July 2019, the defendant rendered the following invoices to the plaintiff for bareboat charters and supply of marine lubrication oil: 21', '23\\u2003It was the plaintiff\u2019s case that, prior to 12 July 2019, the defendant had never raised to the plaintiff the issue of bareboat charters, whether in meetings, WhatsApp messages or emails. In any case, the defendant had no basis to charge the plaintiff for chartering any of the vessels. Bernard pointed out that if the alleged claims were true, it would not make sense and it was out of character for the defendant to leave the alleged claims unaddressed for more than a year in view of the significant sums involved. 22', '24\\u2003Bernard contended that the bareboat invoices were in reality monies owed by Martin or the defendant to the plaintiff. Martin had used the vessels to supply smaller vessels with cargo meant for the Vietnam Project. The plaintiff was entitled to deduct the invoice amounts for those supplies as the plaintiff had paid the supplier for the oil. Bernard accused Martin of usurping and stealing the joint venture business of the parties even though Bunkers Marine invoiced the plaintiff for the fuel supplies it provided. 23', '25\\u2003To substantiate the plaintiff\u2019s contention that the defendant\u2019s claims were not genuine, Bernard referred to the defendant\u2019s financial statements for the years ended 2017 and 2018. He pointed out that if the bareboat charter claims were genuine, the amounts would have been reflected as revenue in the defendant\u2019s financial statements, but they were not. 24', '26\\u2003Bernard also noted that the alleged bareboat charters\u2019 periods took place during the Vietnam Project. Further, the \u201cVictoria Strike\u201d was drydocked between May and October 2016, while the \u201cEustance\u201d was drydocked from about April to June 2017. In addition, as far as Bernard knew, the defendant\u2019s Maybank account did not exist at the time the defendant raised the purported invoices for the alleged bareboat charters, which included details of the defendant\u2019s Maybank account. 25', 'At the material time, the defendant maintained a DBS account.', '27\\u2003Bernard criticised other claims raised by the defendant which form the subject matter of the defendant\u2019s counterclaim. These will be dealt with when the court addresses the defendant\u2019s counterclaim and the evidence presented by the parties.', '28\\u2003When the trial of the Suit first commenced on 13 July 2020, Bernard was not scheduled to testify as one of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, and he had not filed any AEIC. The plaintiff\u2019s witness who took the stand that day was Ng Guat Hoon, known as Doris (\u201cDoris Ng\u201d). She is a director of the plaintiff and is Bernard\u2019s wife. In his AEIC, Bernard deposed 26', 'that initially, Doris Ng stood in for him as a witness as she knew how much he trusted Martin not only as a business partner but also as a very good friend. Doris Ng took it upon herself to confront the defendant so as to save Bernard from having to face Martin, whom he once called a friend.', '29\\u2003However, in the course of Doris Ng\u2019s cross-examination, it became evident to the court that Bernard\u2019s testimony was crucial to the plaintiff\u2019s case. Consequently, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel (i) applied first to adjourn the trial and (ii) subsequently obtained leave from this court for Bernard to be called as the plaintiff\u2019s witness and for his AEIC to be filed. 27', '30\\u2003Not surprisingly, the defendant (in particular its witness Martin) disputed the plaintiff\u2019s and Bernard\u2019s version of events.', '31\\u2003In the statement of claim, the plaintiff claimed from the defendant invoices priced in SGD as well as USD. 28', 'There were only four invoices issued in 2016 and 2017 totalling SGD5,804.50 whilst for the USD invoices, the invoices commenced from 21 February 2016 and ended on 21 June 2018 totalling USD5,910,436.51. The plaintiff alleged that by its employee Lee Kar Mun (\u201cCarmen\u201d), it had sent numerous emails to the defendant\u2019s representative Kammy Choo (\u201cKammy\u201d) since 6 September 2018 to demand payment of the outstanding invoices to no avail. 29', '32\\u2003In its defence and counterclaim, the defendant admitted that the parties had a long-standing business relationship and that Bernard and Martin had been close friends for many years. 30', '33\\u2003The defendant denied that it was agreed that the parties would jointly own the vessels. Instead, the defendant contended that the defendant entered into a Novation Agreement dated 29 March 2016 (\u201cthe Novation Agreement\u201d). Under the Novation Agreement, the defendant took over the vessels by taking over the benefit of a Memorandum of Agreement dated 25 February 2016 (\u201cthe MOA\u201d), which had been executed by RS Marine, Searights and New Finley Assets Limited (\u201cNew Finley\u201d). The defendant asserted that, upon full payment of the purchase price of the vessels to RS Marine, the vessels rightfully belonged to the defendant. 31', '34\\u2003The defendant admitted that the funds from the Vietnam Project were paid to the plaintiff but denied that MB Marine was incorporated to own the vessels and\/or that it was jointly owned by Bernard and Martin. 32', 'The defendant denied that it changed the manner of paying for supplies of MGO ordered by buyers in the Vietnam Project as alleged by Bernard (see [14] above). 33', '35\\u2003The defendant averred that it had no knowledge of Shipmate and\/or of Shipmate\u2019s role in the Vietnam Project, including its role in crewing and paying the vessels\u2019 expenses. 34', '36\\u2003In essence, the defendant denied all the material allegations made by the plaintiff and the latter\u2019s role in the Vietnam Project as well as in the purchase of the vessels.', '37\\u2003The defendant also raised a setoff against the plaintiff\u2019s claim. The setoff was for \u201cservices and goods sold to the [p]laintiff at the [p]laintiff\u2019s request\u201d for invoices variously dated 2016, 2017 and 2018. The earliest invoice was dated 30 June 2016 and the most recent was dated 21 June 2018. There were 31 invoices in total amounting to SGD1,587,000.00 (\u201cthe SGD counterclaim\u201d) and USD4,484,129.84 (\u201cthe USD counterclaim\u201d). 35', '38\\u2003The defendant also asserted that the plaintiff\u2019s claim failed to take into account the following sums paid by the defendant. 36', '39\\u2003It was the defendant\u2019s case that the above sum of USD200,000 paid on 8 September 2017 was made to a third party, Far East Shipping & Trading Pte Ltd (\u201cFar East\u201d), at Bernard\u2019s behest as the plaintiff owed the amount to Derrick whose wife owns Far East.', '40\\u2003The defendant added that, using the exchange rate of SGD1.00 to USD0.74 as at the date of the writ (2 January 2019), the defendant\u2019s SGD claim would be equivalent to USD1,174,380. After the setoff of the sums listed in [37] and [38] above from the plaintiff\u2019s claim, the defendant asserted that the plaintiff owed the defendant USD904,707.00. 37', '41\\u2003In the plaintiff\u2019s reply and defence to the counterclaim, the plaintiff disputed six of the defendant\u2019s invoices for the USD counterclaim and all of the defendant\u2019s invoices for the SGD counterclaim. 38', 'The amounts in the disputed USD invoices total USD428,496.99. The largest sums, however, were the six SGD invoices for bareboat charter hire which the plaintiff claimed it never received.', '42\\u2003The plaintiff had two other witnesses besides Bernard and Doris Ng, namely, Carmen, who is the plaintiff\u2019s accountant, and Jack of Bunkers Marine (see [7] above). The defendant also had four witnesses, namely, Martin, Derrick, THL and Tony (see [9] and [20] above).', '43\\u2003In her AEIC, Carmen deposed that she took over duties from the plaintiff\u2019s former accountant Irene when the latter left the plaintiff\u2019s services in May 2018. Carmen\u2019s duties included chasing the plaintiff\u2019s debtors to recover outstanding sums owed to the plaintiff. In reviewing the plaintiff\u2019s accounts, Carmen realised that the defendant owed sums to the plaintiff (\u201cthe defendant\u2019s outstanding debts\u201d). 39', '44\\u2003Carmen reviewed Irene\u2019s files and records of correspondence between Irene and Kammy, who was the defendant\u2019s accountant at the material time. Carmen noted from Irene\u2019s records that there were email exchanges between Irene and Kammy and WhatsApp exchanges between Irene and Tony on the defendant\u2019s outstanding debts. 40', '45\\u2003Following her perusal of the plaintiff\u2019s records, Carmen started liaising with Kammy. When Carmen first emailed Kammy about the defendant\u2019s outstanding debts, Kammy requested that Carmen send to her relevant or corresponding statements of account of the plaintiff. Carmen obliged even though she noted from the files that Irene had sent Kammy various statements of account on many prior occasions. These included the \u201cAccounts payable\u201d and \u201cAccounts receivable\u201d pertaining to the Vietnam Project. 41', '46\\u2003Carmen tabulated some of her exchanges of communication with the defendant as follows:', '(a)\\u2003On 18 September 2018, Carmen received an email from Tony attaching handwritten accounts which were purportedly a record of the defendant\u2019s statements of accounts. The handwritten records were dated 29 June 2018 and showed an alleged outstanding sum of SGD414,101.10 due from the plaintiff to the defendant. This was inconsistent with the plaintiff\u2019s accounting records. Further, the handwritten records made no reference to any invoices; 42', '(b)\\u2003On 19 September 2018, Carmen attached the following documents in an email to Kammy and Tony:', 'In the email, she informed Kammy that the defendant\u2019s invoice S1804-026 did not tally with the defendant\u2019s statement and that Kammy had failed to include in her statement of accounts the plaintiff\u2019s invoice 8207\/18; 43', '(c)\\u2003On 20 September 2018, Kammy requested Carmen to do a contra between the parties\u2019 accounts. Although this required Martin\u2019s approval, Kammy told Carmen that she could follow Tony\u2019s records of the accounts to expedite the process. 44', '47\\u2003Carmen\u2019s AEIC then repeated the plaintiff\u2019s defence to the defendant\u2019s counterclaim set out at [41] above. She deposed that the plaintiff disputed the following invoices presented to the plaintiff on 12 July 2019, as these had never appeared in the plaintiff\u2019s records prior thereto. 45', '48\\u2003Carmen added that invoice 1804-020 (see S\/N 6 in [41] above), dated 12 April 2018, was a double-billing \u2013 it was also billed to and paid by a related company of the plaintiff called GSM Maritime Pte Ltd (\u201cGSM\u201d). 46', '49\\u2003During cross-examination, Carmen demonstrated her familiarity with the plaintiff\u2019s accounts \u2013 she had no difficulties explaining to the defendant\u2019s counsel how the plaintiff\u2019s statements in the agreed bundles 47', 'added up to the amount claimed in the statement of claim. This included an advance of SGD180,000 made to the defendant in two payments. The first payment of SGD120,000 was made on 14 November 2016, and the second payment of SGD60,000 was made on 26 January 2017. 48', '50\\u2003Carmen drew to the court\u2019s attention the fact that the first five of the defendant\u2019s invoices listed in [47] above contained particulars of the defendant\u2019s Maybank account. Those invoices were variously dated 2016 or 2017. However, the plaintiff\u2019s records of the defendant\u2019s invoices from 2016 to 2018 showed that the Maybank account was never used. During those years, the defendant\u2019s invoices gave its DBS account for payment purposes. 49', 'Carmen referred to Bernard\u2019s AEIC 50', 'where he had deposed that the defendant\u2019s Maybank account did not exist until 2019. 51', '51\\u2003When cross-examined on why this piece of evidence was missing from her AEIC, Carmen explained that as it was in the AEIC of her \u201cboss\u201d Bernard, it was not necessary to include it in her written testimony. 52', '52\\u2003Bernard\u2019s testimony as it appears in his AEIC has already been set out earlier (see [4]\u2013[26] above). The court turns to the evidence that was adduced from him during cross-examination.', '53\\u2003Bernard was not familiar with the statements of accounts between the plaintiff and the defendant. He requested that questions on the same be directed to Carmen, particularly on the contra arrangement between the two parties\u2019 accounts.', '54\\u2003Counsel for the defendant made much of the fact that the plaintiff\u2019s auditor\u2019s confirmation statement of the balance position between the parties as at 31 December 2018 was not countersigned by the defendant. The audit confirmation stated as follows: 53', '55\\u2003Bernard explained that Bunkers Marine was not the sole but a main supplier of MGO for the Vietnam Project. 54', 'For such service, Bernard testified that Bunkers Marine would be paid USD3.00 per tonne of oil as commission. 55', 'On its part, the plaintiff would act as guarantor in case the buyer failed to pay for Bunkers Marine\u2019s cargo. By that Bernard explained (during re-examination) that the plaintiff was required to honour the price quoted by Bunkers Marine for its supply of MGO for the Vietnam Project even if the market price for the cargo fell after Bunkers Marine gave its quotation but before it supplied. 56', '56\\u2003Bernard did not dispute the fact that he had no documents to substantiate his claim that the vessels were meant to be co-owned by the plaintiff and the defendant. 57', 'He said it was a matter of trust between Martin and himself due to Bernard\u2019s friendship with Martin\u2019s father. MB Marine was incorporated for the plaintiff and the defendant to co-own the vessels.', '57\\u2003As Bernard knew nothing of the plaintiff\u2019s accounts, he was unaware of Martin\u2019s alleged unhappiness with the plaintiff\u2019s accounts. 58', 'That was the reason (according to the defendant\u2019s counsel) 59', 'that Martin eventually bypassed the plaintiff and paid Bunkers Marine directly for the MGO supplied for the Vietnam Project. Martin further arranged for the Vietnamese buyer to pay the defendant directly.', '58\\u2003It was Bernard\u2019s evidence that his other company Shipmate was the vessels\u2019 manager and took care of the crewing arrangements, maintenance and repairs of the vessels. Bernard testified during re-examination that, at the time of this trial, the defendant still owed sums to Shipmate for its management of the vessels. 60', '59\\u2003Bernard was shown the plaintiff\u2019s bunker delivery notes in the plaintiff\u2019s supplementary bundle of documents 61', 'for bunkers supplied to the \u201cEustance\u201d on various dates in 2016. These (according to Bernard) related to retail trades in fuel supply sales to other vessels. 62', 'The defendant\u2019s staff Christine brokered these trades for the defendant, and the plaintiff fulfilled them (see [16]\u2013[17] above).', '60\\u2003Nothing turns on Jack\u2019s testimony, which was brief and non-controversial. Jack\u2019s AEIC confirmed Bernard\u2019s version of the facts set out earlier at [5]-[7] and [14].', '61\\u2003During cross-examination, Jack testified that, to him, the expenses incurred for the joint venture Vietnam Project between the plaintiff and the defendant would include bareboat charges. 63', 'He explained that Bunkers Marine would only do business with the plaintiff at the material time because he knew Bernard long before he knew Martin and the plaintiff was in a better financial position than the defendant. 64', 'However, operations-wise, because he had to deal with the end-user of the cargo, Jack testified he dealt more with Martin and Tony for co-ordination reasons with regard to loading and payment of the cargo supplied by Bunkers Marine. 65', '62\\u2003Jack testified that Bunkers Marine would invoice the plaintiff for the cargo it supplied to the Vietnam Project. Sometimes, when Martin urgently required the cargo, the defendant would pay on behalf of the plaintiff but Bunkers Marine always billed the plaintiff. 66', 'For the Vietnam Project, Bunkers Marine received USD66,949,840.00 in total from the defendant. 67', 'Contrary to Bernard\u2019s testimony at [55] above, Jack testified he was paid $2 per tonne as commission for the supplies of MGO by Bunkers Marine.', '63\\u2003Jack confirmed Bernard\u2019s evidence (see [0] above) that, by guarantee from the plaintiff, he meant that the plaintiff must honour and accept the price(s) he had quoted to the plaintiff whenever there was an order placed for MGO under the Vietnam Project. He explained that Bunkers Marine would have booked the quantity of MGO ordered by the plaintiff from its own suppliers at a certain price based upon which he gave a quotation to the plaintiff. Bunkers Marine would still be liable to its supplier(s) based on the price provided to it, even if the price fell after it placed its order for the plaintiff\u2019s cargo \u2013 Jack needed the plaintiff\u2019s commitment to the price he had quoted to the plaintiff to avoid incurring any loss for Bunkers Marine. 68', '64\\u2003As indicated earlier (see [42] above), the defendant also had four witnesses. The court will first address the testimony of Martin, who was the defendant\u2019s most important witness. In his AEIC, 69', 'Martin deposed that the oral agreement between himself and Bernard was that:', '(a)\\u2003the plaintiff and the defendant would purchase oil from one another to fulfil the requirements of their respective customers;', '(b)\\u2003they would provide each other with services such as de-bunkering and de-slopping;', '(c)\\u2003the plaintiff would sell and deliver oil to the defendant\u2019s customers and would invoice the defendant accordingly; and', '(d)\\u2003the plaintiff\u2019s and the defendant\u2019s invoices would be set off against one another.', '65\\u2003Martin claimed he does not know Carmen and has only dealt with her predecessor Irene. 70', 'He added that Kammy, whom Carmen said she liaised with by way of emails in September 2018, is not an employee, agent or representative of the defendant but rather an external accountant engaged by the defendant. He deposed that Kammy also dealt with Irene and not Carmen. 71', '66\\u2003Referring to the defendant\u2019s payments set out in [38] above which the plaintiff disputed, Martin claimed that, at Bernard\u2019s request, the defendant paid on his behalf USD200,000 and USD250,000 to Derrick on 8 September 2017 and on 20 April 2018 respectively. Martin deposed that Bernard owed monies to Derrick. 72', 'Derrick deposed that both sums were paid to his wife\u2019s company, Far East. 73', 'I should point out that this important fact was not pleaded by the defendant in either its defence or counterclaim.', '67\\u2003According to Martin, not only did the defendant not owe money to the plaintiff, but also the plaintiff owed the defendant the sums claimed in the defendant\u2019s counterclaim.', '68\\u2003During his cross-examination, it was elicited from Martin that there was no charter documentation to evidence the defendant\u2019s alleged charter of the vessels to the plaintiff. He testified it was a matter of trust between him and Bernard. In the past, he had also chartered vessels to Bernard without documentation. 74', 'He said the defendant purchased the vessels from RS Marine by instalment payments. 75', 'At one stage 76', 'Martin testified that the plaintiff paid the charter hire for the vessels, which the defendant paid in turn to RS Marine.', '69\\u2003When questioned why he invoiced the plaintiff for charter hire for usage of the vessels to deliver MGO in the Vietnam Project, Martin explained that it was because the vessels belonged to him notwithstanding that the Vietnam Project was a joint venture between the parties. He testified that he provided the vessels to carry the cargo whereas the plaintiff did not provide \u201canything\u201d. 77', 'In addition, the Vietnamese buyer sent payment to Singapore before buying the cargo. 78', 'The defendant charged the plaintiff different amounts for the purported hire of the vessels \u2013 SGD120,000 per month for the \u201cSea Frontier\u201d, SGD100,000 per month for the \u201cEustance\u201d and SGD45,000 per month for the \u201cVictoria Strike\u201d. Martin explained it was due to the vessels being of different sizes. 79', 'There was no documentation to support the defendant\u2019s different rates of hire for the vessels.', '70\\u2003Questioned further why he purchased the MGO for the Vietnam Project through the plaintiff instead of going directly to Bunkers Marine, Martin\u2019s illogical answer was that Jack and the plaintiff were partners and the plaintiff wanted to pay commission of $3.00 per tonne of cargo to Bunkers Marine, to which he agreed. 80', '71\\u2003As regards the Novation Agreement referred to earlier (see [33] above), it is noteworthy that the plaintiff was not a party thereto. Hence, it would not know the contents. According to cll 3 and 4 of the Novation Agreement, Searights\u2019s obligations to buy the vessels from RS Marine were novated to the defendant, but Searights remained a guarantor to ensure that the defendant honoured the obligations it took over from Searights.', '72\\u2003Martin had exhibited to his AEIC the Novation Agreement. Schedule 1 of the Novation Agreement had a payment schedule of eight instalment payments to RS Marine totalling $240,037.92 for the payment of the bareboat charter of the vessels as stated under cl 3.2 therein. Martin relied on the payment schedule in his testimony, but nothing in the document proved that the defendant paid the instalments to become the vessels\u2019 owner. Martin denied the plaintiff\u2019s suggestion that the parties eventually agreed to jointly own the vessels through MB Marine. However, he admitted that eventually it was MB Marine that purchased cargo from Bunkers Marine for the Vietnam Project. 81', '73\\u2003Separately, on the same day the Novation Agreement was executed, Searights, the defendant and RS Marine entered into another novation agreement (\u201cthe Second Novation Agreement\u201d) for the defendant to take over the six-month bareboat charterparty dated 26 February 2016 made between Searights and RS Marine. 82', 'Indeed, the defendant was described as \u201cthe new charterer\u201d in the Second Novation Agreement. The Second Novation Agreement had a payment schedule of eight instalments totalling SGD2,240,354.08.', '74\\u2003Martin\u2019s AEIC further exhibited the MOA executed by New Finley, RS Marine and Searights that provided that, once Searights had paid the monthly charter hire of USD425,600 for six months, RS Marine would then transfer ownership of the vessels to Searights for a token payment of USD10.', '75\\u2003It seemed to the court that the charter hire agreed to be paid by the defendant pursuant to the Second Novation Agreement was actually hire purchase instalments \u2013 once the defendant made the six payments, RS Marine would transfer ownership of the vessels to the defendant for a nominal sum of USD10.', '76\\u2003What was noteworthy from Martin\u2019s cross-examination was the fact that, despite being the defendant\u2019s director and its main witness, he knew nothing about the accounts upon which the defendant relied heavily for its counterclaim and setoff against the plaintiff\u2019s claim. At one point, he went to the extent of not accepting the accounts that were prepared by the defendant as shown in the agreed bundle marked 2AB. 83', '77\\u2003However, despite repeatedly stating that Kammy was in charge of, and he was unable to answer questions on, the accounts, 84', 'the defendant did not call Kammy as a witness and provided no explanation for her absence.', '78\\u2003In addition, it was only when Martin was confronted with the defendant\u2019s own invoice 85', 'dated 31 December 2016 to the plaintiff showing a deduction of SGD480,000 that Martin conceded that the charter hire due to RS Marine for the vessels (in this case for October to December 2016) was paid by the plaintiff. Martin further agreed that the instalment payments for the vessels were paid by the plaintiff but disagreed that the money came from the profits of the Vietnam Project. 86', 'He further disagreed that it was part of the plaintiff\u2019s obligations under the joint venture to bear the instalment payments. 87', '79\\u2003Martin\u2019s AEIC did not mention the Vietnam Project. Bernard dealt with it at length in his AEIC but Martin did not refer to it at all. Pressed repeatedly by counsel for the plaintiff and the court for the reason, Martin\u2019s lame explanation was that there was \u201cno black and white\u201d on the Vietnam Project. 88', 'He added that the plaintiff also did not refer to the Vietnam Project \u201cright from the beginning [and] it was only towards the end that they mentioned this\u201d. 89', '80\\u2003Martin\u2019s assertion is incorrect. In his affidavit filed on 11 August 2020 (the \u201cAugust affidavit\u201d) to oppose the plaintiff\u2019s application to call Bernard, Carmen and Jack as witnesses and file their AEICs, Martin had deposed that the Vietnam Project and the vessels are not issues in these proceedings. 90', 'Yet, in the next breath, 91', 'Martin deposed that the 31 July meeting, the bareboat charter invoices and the sums of USD200,000 and USD250,000 set out in [38] above are live issues. Martin\u2019s stand is inconsistent. The bareboat charter invoices are disputed by the plaintiff, and they arose from the purported charters of the vessels to the plaintiff under the Vietnam Project. Hence, the Vietnam Project and the vessels cannot be \u201cirrelevant\u201d to these proceedings as Martin contended in the August affidavit.', '81\\u2003The court also notes that the AEICs of the plaintiff\u2019s additional witnesses, Bernard and Carmen, were filed on 27 August 2020 and copies were extended to the defendant thereafter. The defendant had every opportunity before the trial dates to file further AEICs to address the issue of the Vietnam Project if it wanted to, and this court would have granted the necessary leave to do so. Further, the Vietnam Project was pleaded in the plaintiff\u2019s Statement of Claim (Amendment No 1) 92', 'filed on 4 September 2020.', '82\\u2003Notwithstanding the omission of the Vietnam Project from the AEICs of the defendant\u2019s witnesses, Martin agreed that the Vietnam Project was a 50:50 joint venture between the parties and that the vessels were used in the joint venture. Despite making that concession, Martin unreasonably asserted that the plaintiff had to bear the expenses of the joint venture and that division of profits was based on gross not net profit. 93', 'Martin claimed he knew nothing of Shipmate\u2019s role in managing, maintaining and crewing the vessels, which in any case was not his concern. He maintained that the plaintiff had to pay charter hire because they made use of the vessels sometimes \u201cto do some of [Bernard]\u2019s other things\u201d. 94', 'Martin had no documentation to prove this allegation but asserted that THL could corroborate his evidence. 95', 'However, he also agreed during cross-examination 96', 'and confirmed in re-examination 97', 'that the plaintiff paid all the expenses for the vessels.', '83\\u2003One concession that Martin did make (after considerable prevarication and after being pressed by the court) was that the defendant could not charge the plaintiff for charter hire when any of the vessels were in drydock. 98', 'That means that the defendant\u2019s claim for charter hire for the vessel \u201cVictoria Strike\u201d between 4 July and 19 October 2016 is unsustainable and so too is its claim for charter hire for the vessel \u201cEustance\u201d when she was dry-docked between 24 April and 9 June 2017.', '84\\u2003Another concession made by Martin was his late acknowledgment that the plaintiff did send him accounts. He conflated the issue that he did not accept the plaintiff\u2019s accounts with the fact that the plaintiff sent the accounts to the defendant. 99', '85\\u2003Many of the points raised by Martin during cross-examination were not pleaded in either the defendant\u2019s defence or its counterclaim or even stated in his AEIC. These included an allegation that it was at the plaintiff\u2019s behest that he requested more and more deposit(s) from the buyer in the Vietnam Project because the plaintiff was short of cash. 100', 'Hence, it serves little purpose for the court to address those (unsubstantiated) allegations.', '86\\u2003After intense cross-examination, it was adduced from Martin that deliveries of the cargo to buyers other than under the Vietnam Project were made on the instructions of his employee Christine, who brokered such transactions for which she was paid commission. Notwithstanding that fact, Martin asserted that the defendant could and did charge the plaintiff for using the vessels to deliver the cargo to buyers sourced by Christine. 101', '87\\u2003What was common ground between the parties was that the contra arrangement of the accounts between the parties required both parties\u2019 agreement. The contra exercise took place first between Irene and Tony representing the plaintiff and the defendant respectively. After Irene left the plaintiff\u2019s employment, Carmen succeeded her. It was also clear from the evidence (which Martin attempted to dispute) that the contra arrangement extended to the Vietnam Project.', '88\\u2003As for the two payments allegedly made to Far East by the defendant at Bernard\u2019s request (see [66] above), Martin had no evidence of such requests \u2013 he claimed Bernard made those requests by way of telephone calls. 102', '89\\u2003It was Martin\u2019s own evidence that the defendant\u2019s counterclaim for bareboat charges from the plaintiff does \u201cnot have much evidence, because everything was done verbally\u201d. 103', 'It is noteworthy that, unlike the plaintiff, the defendant did not even send an audit confirmation statement to the plaintiff to sign on the counterclaim amount of USD1,587,000.', '90\\u2003Next, the court turns to Tony\u2019s testimony. His evidence related to the accounts. In his AEIC, Tony supported Martin\u2019s claim that the defendant had settled all the plaintiff\u2019s invoices for sums owed by the defendant. 104', '91\\u2003However, under cross-examination, it was adduced from Tony that he was unaware that some invoices claimed by the defendant to be outstanding had already been paid. One example was invoice S1702-11 (see S\/N 1 in [41] above) for which payment was made by way of a Citibank cheque 105', 'for SGD72,552, which was equivalent to USD51,492.16. Evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s payment of the defendant\u2019s invoices S1704-004 and 1706-007 was also shown to Tony whilst invoice 1710-008 was contra\u2019d with the plaintiff\u2019s invoice 7998. 106', '92\\u2003Tony had deposed at para 10 of his AEIC that the 17 invoices therein mentioned were handed over to either Irene or Yvonne or Carmen or Bernard. He claimed that Bernard would visit the defendant\u2019s office 3 to 4 times a week and Tony would pass the invoices to Bernard whenever he saw Bernard but there was no acknowledgment. 107', 'One such invoice was S1807-017 dated 17 January 2017 for USD214,576.24, which the plaintiff disputed. Tony hazarded he would have handed that invoice to Bernard around that date. He recalled the occasion distinctly because Bernard apparently tore up the invoice. When cross-examined why the defendant did not follow-up on the non-payment until after the suit was commenced, Tony explained it was because the defendant would include it in the contra exercise (but it never did). 108', '93\\u2003Tony\u2019s attention was drawn to para 18 of Martin\u2019s AEIC (repeated at para 29 of the Defence) where the latter had deposed:', 'According to Martin\u2019s AEIC, the payments of USD200,000.00 and USD250,000.00 were made to Far East by the defendant at Bernard\u2019s request.', '94\\u2003The evidence adduced from Tony proved that Martin\u2019s above assertion was not borne out. Indeed, the evidence adduced from Tony proved that the defendant\u2019s accounts were wholly unreliable. For example, the defendant had issued invoice S1804-020 dated 12 April 2018 for USG49,065.08 to GSM 109', 'and it was paid. Despite such evidence of payment, Tony maintained the defendant did not receive payment of this invoice. 110', '95\\u2003The plaintiff produced a list of 111', 'and the invoices that had been contra\u2019d between the parties for a total sum of USD150,849.73. Tony would not confirm the invoices that had been contra\u2019d, using the excuse that he could not remember due to too many invoices being contra\u2019d. However, he could not dispute the plaintiff\u2019s figures and calculation for the contra\u2019d items. 112', 'Indeed, after counsel for the plaintiff took Tony through the lengthy and tedious exercise of looking at the invoices in the plaintiff\u2019s documents in the bundle marked 2AB, Martin\u2019s contention that the plaintiff failed to account to the defendant for the amounts totalling USD1,153,633.89 (see [93] above) was refuted.', '96\\u2003As for the sum of USD450,000, which the defendant purportedly transferred to Far East at Bernard\u2019s request, not only the plaintiff\u2019s counsel but also the court questioned Tony 113', 'why he would act on the instructions (even if it was true) of someone who is not his employer or from his company to transfer such substantial sums to a third party. Tony had no evidence to substantiate Bernard\u2019s alleged requests. The court further addresses this claim when it refers to Derrick\u2019s testimony (see [102]\u2013[104] below).', '97\\u2003Even more interesting was Tony\u2019s admission that the six invoices totalling USD1,153633.89 (see [93] above) were never the subject of the parties\u2019 contra arrangement. Questioned on this omission, Tony\u2019s unconvincing explanation was that the invoices were from \u201ca long time ago\u201d. 114', 'That would have been all the more reason (the court told Tony) why those invoices should have been part of the contra arrangement between the parties.', '98\\u2003It was equally noteworthy that the defendant\u2019s counterclaim for SGD1,587,000.00 for charter hire (which included supply of marine lubrication oil) was not reflected in the audited accounts of the defendant for the financial years ended 31 July 2017 115', 'and 31 July 2018. 116', 'In those accounts, 117', 'the \u201ctrade receivables\u201d item had a figure of SGD$668,317 and SGD240,100 for 2017 and 2016 respectively. Both years\u2019 figures excluded the alleged outstanding charter hire. The court\u2019s inquiry of Tony for such a significant omission drew an unsatisfactory response that \u201cKammy was the one who prepared [the accounts]\u201d. 118', '99\\u2003The same omission was reflected in the 2018 accounts 119', 'of the defendant, where the item for \u201ctrade receivables\u201d of SGD1,398,516 again excluded the claim for outstanding charter hire. When cross-examined on the omission, Tony explained it was because \u201c[b]oth bosses were in an argument. Monies were not paid, so we didn\u2019t include it\u201d. 120', '100\\u2003An even more significant omission from the defendant\u2019s annual accounts, be it for 2017 or 2018, was its counterclaim against the plaintiff of USD5,637,763,.73 \u2013 it was not recorded as a trade receivable or debt due from the plaintiff. Neither did the defendant send audit statements to the plaintiff for confirmation that the counterclaimed sums of USD5,637,763.73 and SGD1,587,000 were due and owing from the plaintiff. As with the defendant\u2019s charter hire claim, Tony could not or did not provide any satisfactory explanation for this omission.', '101\\u2003In summary, at the close of Tony\u2019s testimony, the plaintiff had shown that the following invoices of the defendant had been paid.', 'The plaintiff had also shown that the following payments by the defendant had been taken into account in the parties\u2019 contra exercise.', '102\\u2003The testimony of the defendant\u2019s two remaining witnesses can be disposed of quickly. Derrick\u2019s evidence was solely to confirm that the defendant had repaid on Bernard\u2019s behalf the two sums of USD200,000 and USD250,000 Bernard allegedly borrowed from Derrick. Apart from deposing that Bernard orally requested the two loans (which Bernard denied), Derrick\u2019s evidence of the two loans was only a bare assertion and questionable. The first sum of USD200,000 was transferred from the defendant\u2019s DBS account to that of Far East on 8 September 2017. 121', '103\\u2003The second sum of USD250,000 was not even extended by the defendant but was a cheque numbered 621185 issued from MB Marine\u2019s DBS account 122', 'on 20 April 2018. It was accompanied by a payment voucher addressed to Derrick and approved by Bernard. 123', 'There was nothing on record to prove that the first remittance had anything to do with Bernard or the plaintiff. Doris Ng had testified 124', 'that Martin called Bernard when Martin was away in Vietnam and requested Bernard to issue a cheque for the amount on Martin\u2019s behalf to Far East to help Derrick who (Martin said) was in financial trouble. On his part, Bernard had deposed in his AEIC 125', 'that he signed DBS cheque numbered 621185 for the amount in blank and it was undated. Bernard corroborated his statement by exhibiting in his AEIC 126', 'a copy of the undated and blank cheque. Neither Bernard nor Doris Ng knew the actual purpose of the cheque. Derrick\u2019s testimony that he repeatedly chased Bernard to return the two alleged loans was also unsupported.', '104\\u2003As the plaintiff\u2019s counsel suggested to Derrick, the appropriate witness should have been Derrick\u2019s wife since Derrick claimed in his AEIC that his wife owns Far East, he owed her money and the alleged payment of US200,000 she received from the defendant was to clear his debt to her as well as the defendant\u2019s debt(s) owed to the plaintiff. 127', 'It was disclosed by Derrick when questioned by the court 128', 'and subsequently in cross-examination 129', 'that he is employed as a manager of Far East. The court is therefore a little sceptical of Derrick\u2019s financial ability to advance such substantial loans to Bernard.', '105\\u2003Finally, the court turns to the testimony of THL, who is a mutual friend of both Bernard and Martin. THL\u2019s AEIC referred to his attendance at two meetings in May and August 2018 to which he was invited by Bernard\u2019s brother. He deposed that the meetings were held to resolve the accounts between the parties; the outcome was that Bernard allegedly agreed that the plaintiff owed sums to the defendant. However, the parties were unable to agree on how much the plaintiff owed the defendant. 130', '106\\u2003THL deposed to what Martin told him 131', 'as well as to a telephone conversation he overhead between Martin and Bernard. 132', 'When he was asked the reason for his attendance at the two meetings, THL said he was to \u201cbe a witness to the dispute\u201d as for \u201c1-plus years to 2 years\u201d, the plaintiff had not given any documents to the defendant on the Vietnam Project despite the latter\u2019s chasing the former. 133', 'Nothing turns on THL\u2019s testimony, which was largely hearsay.'"}
