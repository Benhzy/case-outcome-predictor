{"casename":"2022_SGCA_1","fact":"'4\\u2003On 29 November 2012, the appellants entered into a ship-building contract with the respondent (\u201cthe Contract\u201d). Under the Contract, the appellants undertook to, in accordance with the standards of the American Bureau of Shipping (\u201cABS\u201d), construct and deliver a vessel with the specifications contained in the Contract to the respondent by 31 May 2014. The parties subsequently varied the Contract several times.', '5\\u2003The appellants failed to deliver the vessel by 31 May 2014. At the end of 2014, while the vessel was still under construction, the respondent entered into discussions with a third party (\u201cthe Buyer\u201d) to on-sell the vessel. The Buyer met the respondent (along with the appellants), in December 2014 and January 2015, to agree on changes to the existing technical requirements to be met by the vessel for the purpose of meeting the Buyer\u2019s unique demands.', '6\\u2003On or around 22 December 2014, the ABS conducted tests on the vessel. The appellants regarded these tests as \u201cAcceptance Tests\u201d under the Contract and, under Art 7.3.1 of the Contract, notified the respondent of completion. As the respondent did not reject the vessel within 48 hours thereafter, the appellants were of the view that, pursuant to Art 7.3.4 of the Contract, the vessel was deemed to be accepted. Thus, the appellants\u2019 position was that these tests established that they were ready to deliver the vessel in December 2014. In the arbitration, the respondent denied that the ABS tests were \u201cAcceptance Tests\u201d under Art 7 of the Contract or that the vessel was ready for delivery in December 2014.', '7\\u2003On 2 February 2015, the parties entered into a variation agreement called the second supplemental agreement (\u201cSA2\u201d), which amended the Contract to incorporate the Buyer\u2019s requirements. The relevant aspects of SA2 are set out below:', '(a)\\u2003Article 8 of SA2 extended the delivery date of the vessel from 31 May 2014 to 30 April 2015 and further established 30 June 2015 as the cancelling date.', '(b)\\u2003Article 12 of SA2 provided that, after the cancelling date, the respondent was entitled either to: (i) reject the vessel and terminate the Contract; or (ii) accept delivery of the vessel and claim liquidated damages, at a rate of US$50,000 per day, capped at US$5m.', '(c)\\u2003Article 15 of SA2 varied Art 9.3.1 of the Contract such that, if the appellants failed to deliver the vessel by the new delivery date of 30 April 2015 because of its efforts to remedy non-conformities raised by the Buyer or ModuSpec (the Buyer\u2019s inspection agency) before 15 April 2015, such delay would be \u201cPermissible Delay\u201d. Only if the appellants gave notice of Permissible Delay would the respondent be obliged to extend the delivery date and the cancelling date for the same period of time, subject to a long-stop date of 15 July 2015.', '(d)\\u2003SA2 incorporated Annex I, which set out the Buyer\u2019s technical requirements. Two subdivisions within Annex I were relevant: (i) Annex I-1, which was the technical agreement for the vessel (\u201cSA2 Technical Agreement\u201d); and (ii) Annex I-12, which was a document signed by the respondent and the appellants recording the main points agreed between the respondent and the Buyer in the meetings mentioned at [5] above (\u201cSA2 Minutes of Negotiations\u201d).', '8\\u2003On 16 February 2015, after the signing of SA2, the respondent entered into an agreement with the Buyer for the sale of the vessel to the Buyer. On or around 23 April 2015, the Buyer informed the respondent that the generators installed in the vessel did not conform to the Buyer\u2019s specifications for protection against the ingress of water because they were rated IP23 rather than the contractually specified IP44 rating. When the respondent informed the appellants of this issue on 30 April 2015, the appellants responded that it would take 11 months to upgrade the generators to the IP44 rating.', '9\\u2003The appellants were unable to deliver the vessel by the new delivery date of 30 April 2015 or the cancelling date of 30 June 2015. On or around 1 July 2015, the respondent put the appellants on notice in writing that the appellants had failed: (a) to deliver the vessel in accordance with Art 8 of SA2; and (b) to give notice of \u201cPermissible Delay\u201d under Art 15 of SA2. However, the respondent did not exercise its right under Art 12 of SA2 to terminate the Contract.', '10\\u2003On 2 July 2015 and 1 September 2015, respectively, the ABS issued interim class certificates attesting that the vessel complied with ABS standards. These certificates were of an \u201cinterim\u201d nature because the respondent had yet to provide information about \u201cOwner Furnished Equipment\u201d (ie, drilling equipment) (\u201cOFE\u201d). Between 3 July 2015 and 17 July 2015, ModuSpec inspected the vessel and raised a list of non-conforming features for the appellants to remedy. The appellants then set out to remedy these defects.', '11\\u2003On 12 September 2015, the parties entered into a fourth supplemental agreement (\u201cSA4\u201d) which, by Art 3, extended the new delivery date to no later than 23 September 2015. Article 4 of SA4 fixed the technical acceptance of the vessel on 12 September 2015. However, SA4 did not provide for any new cancelling date, a notable omission as the cancelling date was the start date for the calculation of liquidated damages under Art 12 of SA2 (see [7(b)] above).', '12\\u2003On 22 September 2015, the appellants delivered the vessel to the respondent, who accepted the vessel and made full payment as stipulated under the Contract. That same day, the respondent delivered the vessel to the Buyer. Notwithstanding the delivery and acceptance of the vessel, the respondent asserted the Delay Claim and the Rating Claim against the appellants and sought liquidated damages for the first and damages for breach of contract for the second. Although a separate claim was brought in the arbitration concerning the IP rating of the vessel\u2019s cranes, this stood or fell with the Rating Claim (see [90] of the Judgment).', '13\\u2003With regard to the Delay Claim, the respondent argued that Art 12 of SA2 entitled the respondent to liquidated damages from the cancelling date to the actual date on which the appellants delivered the vessel. Since Art 8 of SA2 fixed the cancelling date as 30 June 2015 and the appellants only delivered the vessel on 22 September 2015, the respondent claimed to be entitled to liquidated damages for the intervening 84 days, which totalled US$4.2m. It was later accepted, however, that as Art 4 of SA4 provided that the calculation of liquidated damages could only extend until 11 September 2015, the respondent\u2019s entitlement at most was to US$3.65m for 73 days of delay between 30 June 2015 and 11 September 2015.', '14\\u2003As the Judge noted at [96] of the Judgment, in the arbitration the appellants pleaded seven alternative defences to the Delay Claim:', '(a)\\u2003First, the appellants delivered the vessel before the delivery date of 23 September 2015 in Art 3 of SA4 and there was therefore no breach of contract.', '(b)\\u2003Second, the appellants invoked the Permissible Delay provision which entitled them to an extension of time for delivery.', '(c)\\u2003Third, the appellants relied on the \u201cprevention principle\u201d to the effect that the time for the appellants to perform their contractual obligation to deliver the vessel was set at large (and then subject only to a broader requirement of a \u201creasonable period of time\u201d) by the respondent\u2019s own acts of prevention, which included: (i) the respondent\u2019s delay in registration caused by its failure to provide the appellants information concerning the OFE; (ii) the respondent\u2019s delay in securing the class certificate from the ABS; and (iii) the delay of the respondent\u2019s inspector ModuSpec in inspecting the vessel.', '(d)\\u2003Fourth, the starting date for calculating the appellants\u2019 liability to pay liquidated damages shifted from the cancelling date of 30 June 2015 to the date on which SA4 terminated the appellants\u2019 liability to pay liquidated damages (ie, after 11 September 2015).', '(e)\\u2003Fifth, the appellants\u2019 liability to pay liquidated damages had lapsed because Art 4 of SA4 provided that \u201ccalculation of liquidated damages \u2026 shall cease on 11 September 2015\u201d.', '(f)\\u2003Sixth, Art 12 of SA2 was a penalty clause.', '(g)\\u2003Seventh, the respondent had waived any right to claim liquidated damages by making full payment on delivery of the vessel.', '15\\u2003In relation to the Rating Claim, the respondent contended that cl 15.2 of the SA2 Technical Agreement read with Art 3 of SA2 obligated the appellants to equip the vessel with generators rated IP44. Given that the appellants delivered the vessel installed with generators only rated IP23, the appellants were in breach of contract.', '16\\u2003The appellants\u2019 defences to the Rating Claim were:', '(a)\\u2003First, the Contract only required the generators installed in the vessel to meet the ABS requirements and did not specify a particular rating for generators.', '(b)\\u2003Second, the respondent was estopped from asserting that the appellants were under an obligation to upgrade the vessel\u2019s generators from IP23 to IP44. This was because the appellants had informed the respondent in December 2014 that: (a) the generators installed were rated IP23; (b) it was not practical to upgrade the said generators to the IP44 rating; and (c) the generators rated IP23 were fit for purpose. Furthermore, the respondent had expressly asked the appellants not to raise this issue with the Buyer so as not to jeopardise the negotiations to on-sell the vessel to the Buyer. As the appellants complied with the respondent\u2019s own request, they argued that the respondent was estopped from asserting the Rating Claim.', '(c)\\u2003Third, the SA2 Minutes of Negotiations, which were signed by the parties, superseded any specific obligations in the SA2 Technical Agreement and permitted the appellants to deliver the vessel with generators rated IP23.', '17\\u2003The appellants counterclaimed, among other things, for additional works to the vessel that the respondent had required the appellants to carry out. The appellants sought approximately US$2.5m for the additional works. In the main, the respondent\u2019s defence to the counterclaim was that the appellants had failed to comply with the conditions precedent for payment in respect of additional works, as stipulated in the Contract.', '18\\u2003On 9 October 2015, the respondent commenced arbitration proceedings against the appellants. The Tribunal, comprising Dr Colin Ong QC (presiding), Mr David Bateson and Mr Goh Kok Leong (\u201cMr Goh\u201d), was constituted in January 2016. In May 2017, the evidential hearing took place over nine days. On 25 October 2018, the Tribunal issued the award (\u201cthe Award\u201d), which dismissed both the respondent\u2019s claims and the appellants\u2019 counterclaims.', '19\\u2003In summarising the Tribunal\u2019s decision in the Award, the Judge observed that \u201c[i]t is \u2026 impossible on the face of the award to distinguish between those findings which form part of the tribunal\u2019s chain of reasoning on the [D]elay [C]laim and those which form part of its chain of reasoning on the [Rating Claim]\u201d: at [109] of the Judgment. Accordingly, he found it necessary to \u201cextract the tribunal\u2019s findings from the first eight subsections of Section G running from [199] to [261] of the award \u2026 and then attempt with generosity to arrange those findings into a coherent chain of reasoning\u201d: at [110] of the Judgment. Having reviewed the Award, we agreed with the Judge\u2019s characterisation of the same and considered his approach to have been apropos and even charitable. As the Judge noted at [111]\u2013[123] of the Judgment, the Tribunal \u201crested its decision to dismiss both the plaintiff\u2019s [Delay] and [Rating] claims on the following eleven findings\u201d:', '(a)\\u2003The vessel was not ready for delivery by the appellants on the dates on which ModuSpec inspected the vessel in July 2015: at paras 208\u2013209 of the Award.', '(b)\\u2003The appellants were responsible for helping the respondent deal with technical aspects of the Buyer\u2019s tender in December 2014 and January 2015: at para 216 of the Award.', '(c)\\u2003The respondent\u2019s own representative, one Mr Tan, provided supporting documents in December 2014 showing that generators rated IP23 were fit for purpose: at paras 220\u2013222 of the Award.', '(d)\\u2003The Buyer required the vessel\u2019s generators to be rated IP44. The respondent\u2019s additional payment of US$10.46m under SA2 was very possibly in part to pay the appellants to upgrade the generators to IP44, but this was academic given the \u201c[respondent\u2019s] own witness evidence that [the] IP23 rating was fit for purpose\u201d: at para 223 of the Award.', '(e)\\u2003The tests which the ABS conducted on the vessel in December 2014 were \u201cAcceptance Tests\u201d within the meaning of Art 7 of the Contract and these tests had been successful, with ABS signing off on the test report subject to certain defects which the appellants were required to remedy: at paras 227\u2013228 of the Award.', '(f)\\u2003The appellants were not in breach of the Contract by delivering the vessel with generators rated IP23 because the respondent itself had confirmed that generators rated IP23 were fit for purpose: at para 234 of the Award.', '(g)\\u2003The respondent had not responded to the appellants\u2019 complaint that the respondent withheld vessel registration information and OFE information, all of which prevented the appellants from obtaining a class certificate. Thus, it was the respondent\u2019s own fault for failing to co-operate with the appellants to obtain the class certificate: at para 238 of the Award.', '(h)\\u2003The respondent wrongfully prevented the appellants from obtaining a class certificate: at para 240 of the Award.', '(i)\\u2003It was not necessary to resolve the factual dispute as to whether the appellants knew that the Buyer required generators that were rated IP44 because the Tribunal had already found as a fact that generators rated IP23 were fit for the respondent\u2019s purpose. As such, it was not material that: (i) the respondent failed to adduce expert evidence that generators rated IP44 were different from those rated IP23; (ii) the appellants understood that they had to upgrade the generators; and (iii)  it was common ground that the appellants delivered vessels with generators only rated IP23: at paras 245\u2013246 of the Award.', '(j)\\u2003It was not unusual for a vessel to be delivered even if it had minor defects because the vessel would be under warranty and such defects could be rectified during the warranty period: at para 250 of the Award.', '(k)\\u2003The respondent failed to prove that any defect in the vessel was so serious that it rendered the vessel obsolete: at para 255 of the Award. The respondent\u2019s interests were protected by the appellants\u2019 contractual obligation to remedy any defective workmanship during the warranty period.', '20\\u2003Although the Tribunal by a majority dismissed the Rating Claim, Mr Goh issued a brief dissenting opinion on this claim. Mr Goh would have held that the appellants were obligated to deliver the vessel with generators rated IP44 because this was consistent with the commercial purpose of SA2. Nevertheless, he agreed with the majority\u2019s decision on the dismissal of the respondent\u2019s Delay Claim and the dismissal of the appellants\u2019 counterclaim.', '21\\u2003In dismissing the appellants\u2019 counterclaim, the Tribunal held that: (a) the appellants had indeed delayed in delivering the vessel under the Contract (at para 282 of the Award); (b) SA4 did not extend either the delivery date or the cancelling date (at para 295 of the Award); and (c) the appellants were not entitled to rely on the Permissible Delay clause because they had failed to comply with the contractual conditions precedent for invoking that provision (at paras 301\u2013303 of the Award). As the Judge noted (Judgment at [126]), the respondent argued that these findings were irreconcilable with the Tribunal\u2019s decision to dismiss the Delay Claim.', '22\\u2003On 27 November 2018, the respondent submitted a request for correction of the Award. The Tribunal responded by issuing a decision and addendum dated 16 January 2019 (\u201cthe Decision\u201d). Relevant to the present appeal was the respondent\u2019s specific request regarding para 220 of the Award, which stated that \u201c[the respondent\u2019s Mr Tan] provided supporting documents to show that IP23 was fit for purpose\u201d. As the respondent pointed out in its request for correction, Mr Tan was not the respondent\u2019s representative but, in fact, the appellants\u2019 representative. In the Decision, the Tribunal accordingly reworded para 220 of the Award to state: \u201c[t]he Tribunal has noted that [the appellants\u2019 Mr Tan] provided supporting documents to show that IP23 was fit for purpose\u201d. On 15 February 2019, the respondent made a further request under Art 33(1)(b) of the Model Law for an interpretation of the Award, but this request was rejected on 9 April 2019 on the ground that it had been made out of time.', '23\\u2003On 15 April 2019, the respondent filed an originating summons (\u201cOS 488\u201d) in the High Court seeking to set aside the Award save for that part in which the Tribunal dismissed the appellants\u2019 counterclaim. The respondent did not, however, file a supporting affidavit at the same time as it filed the application. The supporting affidavit was only filed on 30 April 2019 (the \u201c30 April Affidavit\u201d). OS 488 and the 30 April Affidavit were both served on the appellants on 24 May 2019.'"}
{"casename":"2022_SGCA_10","fact":"'3\\u2003The facts pertaining to the appellant\u2019s alleged offences are largely undisputed and are set out in comprehensive detail in the judgment of the High Court Judge (the \u201cJudge\u201d) in Public Prosecutor v Teo Ghim Heng (Zhang Jinxing) [2021] SGHC 13 (the \u201cJudgment\u201d). For present purposes, it will suffice for us to briefly recapitulate the facts which are material to the present appeal. It should be recognised that the account of the crimes and the appellant\u2019s motivations come largely from the appellant himself, as there were no witnesses to what happened.', '4\\u2003The appellant was the sole breadwinner of his family. Prior to 2015, he had been a successful property agent, earning (on his own account) a five-figure monthly income. However, from 2015 onwards, a downturn in the property market caused the appellant\u2019s income to decline significantly. Despite this, the appellant\u2019s family\u2019s expenses remained high and the appellant, who was an avid gambler, continued to spend a few hundred dollars a week on gambling. As a result, the appellant quickly depleted his savings and had to resort to borrowing money from his friends, colleagues and various financial institutions in order to meet his family\u2019s expenses.', '5\\u2003In October 2016, the appellant joined an interior design firm, Carpentry Design Works Pte Ltd (\u201cCDW\u201d), where he worked as a sales coordinator under the supervision of Mr Lim Zi Jian, Jordan (\u201cMr Lim\u201d). The appellant earned a monthly salary of about $1,500 at CDW and continued to work part time as a property agent. Notwithstanding his efforts, the appellant continued to accumulate debts and, by the end of 2016, owed his creditors at least $120,000.', '6\\u2003On 19 January 2017, the principal of the playschool that Zi Ning attended sent the appellant a text message requesting payment of Zi Ning\u2019s overdue school fees amounting to $1,700. The appellant felt vexed by this request as he did not have the ability to pay the overdue fees. The next morning, when Pei Shan, Zi Ning and the appellant were sitting together in the master bedroom of their flat (the \u201cFlat\u201d), the appellant informed Pei Shan that he did not wish to send Zi Ning to school that day as her school fees were overdue and he was worried that she might be asked to leave the school, which would be \u201cvery embarrassing\u201d. This enraged Pei Shan, who started berating the appellant for being a \u201cuseless\u201d father and husband.', '7\\u2003The appellant averred that upon hearing this, his mind became a \u201ccomplete blank\u201d. The appellant proceeded to retrieve a bath towel from the bathroom, loop it around Pei Shan\u2019s neck, and pull it tightly at the ends to strangle her. After about five minutes, the appellant\u2019s mind cleared, but he continued strangling Pei Shan. The appellant claimed that he had done so with the intention of killing his entire family and then committing suicide thereafter, as he felt that there was no way for his family to repay the debts that he owed. After about 15 minutes, the appellant let go of the bath towel and strangled Pei Shan with his bare hands until she stopped breathing completely. At the time of her death, Pei Shan was pregnant with her and the appellant\u2019s second child.', '8\\u2003The appellant then considered whether to kill Zi Ning as well. He reasoned that, with her parents gone, Zi Ning would not have anyone to take care of her. He also did not want to leave Zi Ning behind to suffer the consequences of the debts that he owed. As such, the appellant asked Zi Ning to sit down in front of him, with her back facing him. When Zi Ning complied, the appellant looped the same bath towel around Zi Ning\u2019s neck and pulled both ends of the towel to strangle her. After about 10 to 15 minutes, the appellant released the bath towel and strangled Zi Ning with his bare hands until she, too, stopped breathing completely.', '9\\u2003Immediately after killing Pei Shan and Zi Ning, and in the days that followed, the appellant allegedly contemplated or attempted suicide on various occasions:', '(a)\\u2003On 20 January 2017, after strangling Pei Shan and Zi Ning, the appellant attempted suicide by slitting his wrists with a penknife. However, this attempt was unsuccessful as the cuts were not deep enough.', '(b)\\u2003Later that same day, the appellant decided to commit suicide by overdosing on Panadol. The appellant consumed 20 Panadol pills before lying on the bed next to Pei Shan\u2019s and Zi Ning\u2019s bodies. However, this attempt was also unsuccessful.', '(c)\\u2003On 21 January 2017, the appellant decided to commit suicide by consuming rat poison and went out to buy the poison. However, he was unable to purchase it and returned home empty-handed. The appellant then resolved to commit suicide by jumping to his death the next day. The next day, however, he failed to go through with this plan.', '(d)\\u2003On 24 January 2017, the appellant again contemplated committing suicide by jumping, but put it off again as he did not have the courage to jump.', '(e)\\u2003On 25 January 2017, the appellant attempted suicide by consuming 105 Panadol tablets. He vomited and lay down hoping to pass away in his sleep but woke up at about 9.00am the next day.', '(f)\\u2003On 26 January 2017, the appellant attempted to slit his left wrist again using a penknife blade, but his wound stopped bleeding after a while. On the same day, the appellant sprayed a large quantity of insecticide into his water and drank the mixture. He suffered from diarrhoea but did not die.', '(g)\\u2003On the morning of 28 January 2017, the appellant resolved to burn Pei Shan\u2019s and Zi Ning\u2019s bodies, immolating himself in the process. However, after pouring thinner on the blanket and setting the blanket on fire, the appellant \u201cchickened out\u201d and got out of the bed as he found the heat \u201cunbearable\u201d. Thereafter, the appellant formulated a plan to drown himself in the sea at Sembawang Park, but again failed to see this plan through to completion.', '10\\u2003The appellant also employed different tactics to avoid the various individuals who attempted to communicate with or look for the appellant, Pei Shan and Zi Ning. These tactics included the following:', '(a)\\u2003switching off his handphone and using Pei Shan\u2019s handphone instead so that his creditors could not contact him;', '(b)\\u2003informing Zi Ning\u2019s teacher that Zi Ning could not attend school as she was not feeling well;', '(c)\\u2003making excuses as to why he and his family could not attend family dinners with his parents and parents-in-law;', '(d)\\u2003pretending that he was not at home when his CDW colleagues visited his house to look for him; and', '(e)\\u2003accessing Pei Shan\u2019s Facebook and changing her cover photo, thereby giving the impression that she was active on social media.', '11\\u2003Between the killings and his arrest, the appellant spent the rest of his time in the Flat watching television and YouTube videos, playing games on his handphone, consuming pornography on the Internet, surfing the Internet on methods of committing suicide, and smoking in the study.', '12\\u2003Pei Shan\u2019s and Zi Ning\u2019s deaths were finally discovered on the evening of 28 January 2017. On that day, Pei Shan\u2019s brother, Choong Mun Chen (\u201cMr Choong\u201d), and Mr Choong\u2019s brother-in-law paid a visit to the Flat, whereupon they noticed a pungent odour coming from the windows of the Flat. Mr Choong called the police and the appellant was arrested shortly thereafter. He was ultimately charged with two counts of murder under s 300(a) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (\u201cPC\u201d).'"}
{"casename":"2022_SGCA_11","fact":"'6\\u2003The factual background leading to the arrest of the appellant is largely undisputed and has been detailed at [3]\u2013[12] of the GD. We briefly highlight the salient facts.', '7\\u2003On 3 April 2018 at about 4.29pm, the appellant entered Singapore from Malaysia on a motorcycle, with a pillion rider whom he claimed was his relative. They were arrested by several officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (\u201cCNB\u201d) at about 6.45pm, after leaving a multi-storey carpark in Alexandra Road on the motorcycle.', '8\\u2003Several keys were seized from the appellant, one of which was later used to open a drawer in the appellant\u2019s locker in the cleaners\u2019 room at Basement One of Harbourfront Tower One. The following items were seized:', '9\\u2003The appellant testified that he had placed all three plastic bags in his locker. He testified that he had been asked by one \u201cSara\u201d (initially identified as \u201cS2\u201d) to do a favour for him, in exchange for a RM1,500 loan from \u201cSara\u201d. On \u201cSara\u2019s\u201d instructions, he had gone to collect a plastic bag inside a dustbin at Tuas. He was told to wait for someone to collect the plastic bag from him but nobody showed up, so he thought of putting it in his workplace locker. There, he opened the plastic bag and saw the three plastic bags inside.', '10\\u2003He knew that the first plastic bag contained methamphetamine, as he looked inside the bag and had previously consumed the drug. However, he testified that he was not aware of the contents of the second plastic bag which contained diamorphine. The drugs were subsequently analysed by the Health Sciences Authority and certified to contain a total of not less than 79.07g of diamorphine and 324.41g of methamphetamine. The appellant did not challenge the integrity and custody of the exhibits seized by the CNB officers.', '11\\u2003A total of 13 statements recorded from the accused were admitted into evidence. These included three contemporaneous statements recorded at about 8.02pm, 10.45pm, and 11.48pm on 3 April 2018; three cautioned statements recorded under s 23 of the CPC on 4 April 2018 at about 1.53pm, 2.22pm and 2.53pm; and seven long statements recorded under s 22 of the CPC between 10 April 2018 and 23 October 2018. Significantly, in the appellant\u2019s second contemporaneous statement recorded just before the locker was opened, the appellant had stated as to the contents of the locker, that: \u201cThere are 5 packets of chocolate, same like the one I gave to the person just now and 4 packets of ice and one weighing scale\u201d. The appellant also did not challenge the testimony given at trial by several CNB officers that \u201cchocolate\u201d and \u201cice\u201d were street names for diamorphine and methamphetamine, respectively.', '12\\u2003The appellant additionally stated, in his third contemporaneous statement recorded after the locker was opened and searched, that the locker was his and only he had the keys to it. He identified the packets as consisting of \u201cice\u201d and \u201csaapadu\u201d, the latter of which he stated meant heroin.

{"casename":"2022_SGCA_14","fact":"'2\\u2003OS 32 is an application by Mr Tan Hock Keng (\u201cMr Tan\u201d) for leave to appeal from the decision of the AD in Tan Hock Keng v Malaysian Trustees Bhd and another matter [2021] SGHC(A) 18 (\u201cthe Judgment\u201d). In the Judgment, the AD upheld the decision of a judge in the General Division of the High Court (\u201cthe Judge\u201d) in Malaysian Trustees Bhd v Tan Hock Keng [2021] SGHC 162 (\u201cthe GD\u201d) on a Registrar\u2019s Appeal. The background facts have been set out in the Judgment and the GD and we only summarise the main points in so far as they are relevant for present purposes.', '3\\u2003Mr Tan had entered into a settlement agreement with the respondent, Malaysian Trustees Bhd (\u201cMTB\u201d), in connection with disputes between MTB and another Malaysian company, Pilecon Engineering Bhd (\u201cPEB\u201d). Mr Tan is a director of PEB and he had provided a guarantee in respect of PEB\u2019s debts to MTB in 2015. On 8 November 2019, the Kuala Lumpur High Court (\u201cKLHC\u201d) granted a consent judgment pursuant to a settlement agreement between Mr Tan and MTB for the sum of RM 60m with interest thereon (\u201cthe Consent Judgment\u201d). The Consent Judgment provided that its enforcement was to be withheld on terms.', '4\\u2003In the event, those terms were not fully performed. In August 2020, MTB filed an application in the KLHC (which was allowed) for certification of a true copy of the Consent Judgment under the Malaysian Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments Act 1958. In September 2020, Mr Tan filed an application (\u201cMalaysia OS 455\u201d) in the KLHC, seeking, amongst other things, a declaration that the Consent Judgment is \u201cvalid and binding\u201d on the parties and a reasonable extension of time for himself and the other parties to the Consent Judgment to comply with their obligations under the Consent Judgment.', '5\\u2003In November 2020, MTB registered the Consent Judgment in the Singapore courts under the Reciprocal Enforcement of Commonwealth Judgments Act (Cap 264, 1985 Rev Ed) (\u201cRECJA\u201d). In December 2020, Mr Tan applied to set aside MTB\u2019s registration on the grounds of there being, inter alia, an \u201cappeal\u201d within the terms of s 3(2)(e) of the RECJA, citing Malaysia OS 455. The assistant registrar (\u201cAR\u201d) allowed Mr Tan\u2019s application.', '6\\u2003MTB filed an appeal (\u201cRA 83\u201d) against the AR\u2019s decision. For RA 83, Mr Tan similarly relied on Malaysia OS 455 as the \u201cappeal\u201d. He also argued that the word \u201cappeal\u201d in s 3(2)(e) of the RECJA should be given an extended definition like that found in s 2(1) of the Reciprocal Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act (Cap 265, 2001 Rev Ed) (\u201cREFJA\u201d), as including \u201cany proceedings by way of discharging or setting aside a judgment or an application for a new trial or stay of execution\u201d (\u201cthe Extended Meaning\u201d). The Judge held that Malaysia OS 455, which affirmed the validity and binding nature of the Consent Judgment, could not amount to an \u201cappeal\u201d, even if that word were given the Extended Meaning contended for by Mr Tan (see the GD at [16]). The Judge therefore allowed RA 83 and upheld the registration of the Consent Judgment. In the circumstances, it was unnecessary for the Judge to decide if the word \u201cappeal\u201d should indeed be given the Extended Meaning, but he considered that it should not (see the GD at [17]).', '7\\u2003After RA 83 was allowed in MTB\u2019s favour, Mr Tan filed a suit (\u201cMalaysia Suit 437\u201d) in the KLHC against MTB seeking, inter alia, rectification of the Consent Judgment so that it properly reflected the intention of the parties. Mr Tan also filed an appeal (\u201cCA 54\u201d) against the Judge\u2019s decision, which was heard by the AD. For CA 54, Mr Tan relied, not on Malaysia OS 455, but on Malaysia Suit 437, as the proceeding constituting an \u201cappeal\u201d within s 3(2)(e) of the RECJA. In connection with his attempt to rely on Malaysia Suit 437, Mr Tan also filed an application (\u201cSUM 26\u201d) to adduce in evidence before the AD the cause papers relating to Malaysia Suit 437.', '8\\u2003At the outset, the AD dismissed SUM 26. It considered that the requirements in BNX v BOE and another appeal [2018] 2 SLR 215 (\u201cBNX\u201d) for receiving further evidence on appeal as to matters occurring after the date of the hearing below were not satisfied. The AD held that it was not sufficient that the further evidence notionally affects the basis of the decision of the court below; it must \u201cat the very least relate to the decision that is appealed against\u201d (see the Judgment at [11]). The AD considered that evidence of Malaysia Suit 437 did not relate to the Judge\u2019s decision at all because the Judge\u2019s decision had been entirely premised on Malaysia OS 455 and not on Malaysia Suit 437, which offered an entirely new basis for the legal inquiry into what would qualify as an \u201cappeal\u201d for the purposes of s 3(2)(e) of the RECJA (see the Judgment at [12]).', '9\\u2003With the dismissal of SUM 26, the only question remaining before the AD was whether Malaysia OS 455 constituted an \u201cappeal\u201d. The AD held that it did not. That was because Malaysia OS 455, which only sought to affirm the Consent Judgment rather than challenge or correct anything about that judgment before a court of superior jurisdiction, did not amount to an \u201cappeal\u201d within the ordinary meaning of the word (see the Judgment at [19]-[21]). The AD also affirmed the Judge\u2019s decision and considered that the word \u201cappeal\u201d in s 3(2)(e) of the RECJA should not be given the Extended Meaning, because while the word \u201cappeal\u201d appears in both the RECJA and REFJA, they are respectively couched in a different inquiry unique to the concerns animating the registration regime underlying each statute, and are not used in the same sense even though the context in both statutes are identical, namely, the setting aside of the registration of a foreign judgment (see the Judgment at [25] and [28]). The AD also considered that, even if the Extended Meaning applied, that did not assist Mr Tan, because any extended meaning associated with the word \u201cappeal\u201d cannot displace the natural meaning of the word (see the Judgment at [30]). Therefore, Malaysia OS 455 would still not amount to an \u201cappeal\u201d within s 3(2)(e) of the RECJA, even if the Extended Meaning applied (see the Judgment at [31]).'"}

We briefly highlight the following facts.', '4\\u2003The appellant is a 29-year-old Malaysian male. At the material time, he was a production worker at Nelco Products Pte Ltd (\u201cNelco\u201d). On 25 July 2018 at 7.35am, the appellant rode a motorcycle bearing Malaysian registration number JRV1017 (\u201cthe Motorcycle\u201d) and entered Singapore from Malaysia via the Tuas Checkpoint. There, he was subjected to a routine check, and was taken into custody by the Central Narcotics Bureau (\u201cCNB\u201d) officers, and escorted to the A3 Garage at Tuas Checkpoint (\u201cthe Garage\u201d).', '5\\u2003At the Garage, the appellant told one Sgt Muhammad Fadhil Bin Amar Tugiman (\u201cSgt Fadhil\u201d) that there was something in the front storage box of the Motorcycle, and stated that there were items on his body. The drugs in relation to the Charge were one block of vegetable matter (later marked \u201cB1A\u201d) which was wrapped in a pair of folded raincoat pants and found in the front storage box, and four blocks of vegetable matter that were strapped onto the appellant\u2019s body (marked as \u201cBW-F1\u201d, \u201cBW-F2\u201d, \u201cBW-B1\u201d and \u201cBW-B2\u201d). These five bundles were found to contain not less than 1,475.3g of cannabis (\u201cthe Drugs\u201d). In addition, two packets containing granular and\/or powdery substance were found underneath the Motorcycle seat. These do not form the subject of the charge.', '6\\u2003During the investigation, a forensic analysis was performed on the appellant\u2019s phone, which revealed the details of his communications with one Pandian and one Jo, with whom he made and received several phone calls from after his arrest, between 8.45am and 4.06pm on 25 July 2018.', '7\\u2003In his first contemporaneous statement recorded at 9.45am on the day of his arrest, the appellant stated that the one block of vegetable matter wrapped in his raincoat pants was \u201cganja\u201d, and that he had used the raincoat pants to wrap around the block to hide it. For the four blocks of \u201cganja\u201d that were found on the appellant\u2019s body, he admitted that he had hidden \u201c2 blocks of \u2018ganja\u2019 on [his] back and 1 block on the front\u201d, and the last block was hidden underneath his left armpit.', '8\\u2003In his interviews with the psychiatrist from the Institute of Mental Health, Dr Stephen Phang (\u201cDr Phang\u201d), the appellant informed Dr Phang that one Pandian had asked him to do a delivery job, which he understood was \u201csomething related to drugs\u201d. While Pandian told the appellant that he had given the appellant \u201cbook\u201d and \u201cfood chocolate\u201d, the latter did not believe that what Pandian gave him was a real book and chocolate, because he thought \u201cit looked like ganja\u201d, having previously seen the drug on Whatsapp and on his phone. He accepted the job because he was in need of money. While he did not know the exact contents of the blocks, he knew that it was \u201cdrugs, and something illegal\u201d.'"}
{"casename":"2022_SGCA_16","fact":"'16\\u2003We begin by setting out the relevant background to these appeals. Section 377A was enacted by the Legislative Council of the Straits Settlements (\u201cthe Legislative Council\u201d) in 1938 by way of s 3 of the Penal Code (Amendment) Ordinance 1938 (SS Ord No 12 of 1938) (\u201cthe 1938 Penal Code (Amendment) Ordinance\u201d), and provides as follows:', '17\\u2003On 22 October 2007, a petition to repeal s 377A was presented to Parliament. Although no vote was taken on that petition, s 377A was debated extensively in Parliament during the second reading of the Penal Code (Amendment) Bill (Bill No 38\/2007) (\u201cthe 2007 Penal Code (Amendment) Bill\u201d): see Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (22 and 23 October 2007) vol 83. For ease of reference, we hereafter denote these debates collectively as \u201cthe s 377A Debates\u201d. Of especial note is that while s 377A was retained, the Prime Minister made clear that this was on the terms that it would not be proactively enforced (see the 23 October 2007 Debates at col 2402). In his speech during the s 377A Debates, the Prime Minister emphasised the need to forge a consensus gradually and stated that the Government had decided to \u201ckeep the status quo on section 377A\u201d (see the 23 October 2007 Debates at col 2405).', '18\\u2003The issue of the constitutionality of s 377A first came before our courts in Tan Eng Hong v Attorney-General [2013] 4 SLR 1059, in which the High Court held that s 377A was constitutional and did not offend Arts 9 and 12 of the Constitution. That decision was upheld on appeal in Lim Meng Suang and another v Attorney-General and another appeal and another matter [2015] 1 SLR 26 (\u201cLim Meng Suang (CA)\u201d). In the intervening years since our decision in Lim Meng Suang (CA), s 377A has remained a controversial and socially divisive issue, with calls both for and against its repeal intensifying in recent years.', '19\\u2003Amidst the ongoing discussion on the retention or repeal of s 377A, Attorney-General Mr Lucien Wong SC (\u201cAG Wong\u201d), in his capacity as the Public Prosecutor (\u201cthe PP\u201d), clarified in 2018 the prosecutorial policy in respect of offences falling under that provision. In a press release dated 2 October 2018 (\u201cthe 2018 AGC Press Release\u201d), AG Wong acknowledged the Government\u2019s position that \u201cthe Police will not proactively enforce [s 377A], for instance by conducting enforcement raids\u201d (see para 3 of the 2018 AGC Press Release). He clarified, however, that the police would investigate reported offences under s 377A if the surrounding circumstances so warranted (for instance, if minors were involved). He concluded by stating (at para 6 of the 2018 AGC Press Release):', 'AG Wong reiterated this position in a letter published under his name in The Straits Times on 6 October 2018 (\u201cthe 2018 Straits Times article\u201d). These statements contemplate the non-prosecution of a subset of acts that may be caught under s 377A, namely, sexual acts between two consenting adult men in private (\u201cthe Subset\u201d).'"}

The second and third appellants are companies affiliated with the first appellant and they agreed to guarantee the latter\u2019s obligations under the Agreement.', '3\\u2003The Agreement was for an initial term of 24 months but the first appellant purported to terminate it on 30 September 2019 alleging breach of contract by the respondent. The respondent asserted that the termination was wrongful. It then commenced arbitration proceedings against the appellants on 14 October 2019, pursuant to the arbitration clause in the Agreement, which provided for arbitration in Singapore in accordance with the rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (the \u201cSIAC\u201d) \u2013 the applicable version of the rules being the 6th Edition dated 1 August 2016 (the \u201cSIAC Rules\u201d). Significantly, however, the Agreement provided for English law to be the governing law of the contract.', '4\\u2003The respondent\u2019s main claim was against the first appellant for alleged breaches of the Service Agreement. The respondent also claimed against the second and third appellants as guarantors\/indemnitors. At some point in the arbitration however, these two appellants ceased to participate in it, leaving the first appellant as the active defendant.', '5\\u2003Clause 10.2 of the Agreement provided that if it was terminated during the initial term, the first appellant would be liable to pay the respondent a \u201cMake-Whole Amount\u201d (\u201cthe Make-Whole Clause\u201d). Clause 11 provided that if the first appellant failed to meet its payment obligations, the respondent would be entitled to simple interest of 5% per month on the unpaid amount until the date of actual payment (\u201cthe Interest Clause\u201d). The respondent\u2019s claim in the arbitration was for payment of US$2.8m allegedly due under the Make-Whole Clause and interest thereon at 5% per annum in accordance with the Interest Clause.', '6\\u2003The arbitration was commenced under the expedited procedure provided for in the SIAC Rules which meant that it was intended to be completed within six months. On 2 January 2020, the SIAC appointed Ms Maria Chedid as the sole arbitrator (\u201cthe Tribunal\u201d). On 2 October 2020, the Tribunal issued her final Award (\u201cthe Award\u201d) in which she dismissed the respondent\u2019s claim on the sole basis that the Make-Whole Clause was unenforceable in that it imposed an \u201cunconscionable penalty that [was] unenforceable as [being] against public policy under English law.\u201d The respondent\u2019s claim for recovery under the Make-Whole Clause was thus denied (Award at [124]). The Tribunal further found that the Interest Clause was similarly an unenforceable penalty clause, although the question of whether the interest amount was a penalty had been rendered moot since the Tribunal had already dismissed the respondent\u2019s claim under the Make-Whole Clause (Award at [125]).'"}

Nothing turns on CA 114 in the present application.', '15\\u2003Turning to CA 113, although SUM 4933\/2017 had included a prayer for relief relating to the Judgment and all other orders obtained to enforce the Judgment (see [12] above), the Lao Appellants\u2019 case in CA 113 only made reference to the setting aside of the Leave Order and ORC 6397\/2016. The appeal, therefore, centred on that specific relief, and we were not addressed on any other consequential matters. We return to the significance of this fact below.', '16\\u2003In CA 113, we found that the wrong choice of seat in Singapore as opposed to Macau was a sufficient basis on which to conclude that the SIAC Award could not be enforced, without there being need for proof of prejudice, and allowed the appeal. At [109] of ST Group (CA), our conclusion was stated as follows:', 'SUM 44 concerns, in essence, what else should be done as a consequence of this conclusion in CA 113.', '17\\u2003There are four particular developments after our decision in CA 113 which are relevant to our determination of SUM 44. These pertain to: (a) the drafting of the order of court for CA 113; (b) the pending applications in OS 890\/2016; (c) the application for the return of the Garnished Sums in the High Court; and (d) subsequent arbitral proceedings. We set out the material facts concerning each of these in turn.', '18\\u2003After CA 113 was allowed on 18 November 2019, the Lao Appellants\u2019 counsel, Haridass Ho & Partners (\u201cHaridass\u201d), wrote to Sanum\u2019s counsel, WongPartnership LLP (\u201cWongPartnership\u201d) on 27 November 2019 seeking a return of the Garnished Sums together with interest thereon. 4', 'WongPartnership replied that its Primary Position was that the application in SUM 4933\/2017 was out of time and the question of whether an extension of time should be granted was pending, and the request was therefore premature. 5', 'On 6 January 2020, WongPartnership offered not to pursue the Primary Position if, inter alia, the Garnished Sums were placed in escrow instead. 6', 'The Lao Appellants did not agree. 7', '19\\u2003The Lao Appellants then attempted to introduce various consequential orders into the order of court. As this is of some significance to the background of SUM 44, we set out the relevant parts of the draft orders that were exchanged by the parties. The material parts of the draft order proposed by the Lao Appellants on 19 February 2020 read as follows: 8', '20\\u2003In response, Sanum proposed a draft order on 21 February 2020, the relevant parts of which read as follows: 9', '21\\u2003This disagreement was notified to the court on 12 March 2020. A Case Management Conference was held on 27 July 2020 to deal with the drafting of the order of court. The learned Assistant Registrar communicated to the parties this court\u2019s indication that \u201cthe draft orders of court should only contain matters that were placed before the Court of Appeal and that were addressed by the Court of Appeal in their judgment of 18 November 2019\u201d. She went on to note that the matters relating to the release of the garnished sums, the return of the share certificate, and the reservation of Sanum\u2019s rights had not been dealt with by this court in CA 113. The parties took this indication and subsequently agreed on an order of court, which was extracted as CA\/ORC 133\/2020 on 20 August 2020, on the following terms:', 'As can be seen, this order reflected our conclusion in ST Group (CA) at [109], and did not touch on the status of the Judgment, the FGOs, or the Garnished Sums.', '22\\u2003On 21 February 2020, the Lao Parties filed HC\/SUM 846\/2020 (\u201cSUM 846\/2020\u201d) for leave to withdraw the three outstanding applications referred to at [9] above. The Lao Parties also brought HC\/SUM 2318\/2020 (\u201cSUM 2318\/2020\u201d) on 5 June 2020 to apply for the Sheriff\u2019s release of the shares that were seized under WSS 77\/2016 (see [8] above). These applications were fixed to be heard by the Judge on 30 July 2020.', '23\\u2003On 29 July 2020, the parties reached an agreement that Sanum would no longer pursue its Primary Position, and that SUM 846\/2020 and SUM 2318\/2020 would be resolved by consent. 10', 'On 30 July 2020, the parties indicated to the Judge that they had agreed to the disposal of these applications with no order as to costs. The orders were granted by consent (see HC\/ORC 4140\/2020 and HC\/ORC 4141\/2020). Hence, of all the enforcement orders obtained in OS 890\/2016, only the FGOs remained.', '24\\u2003Subsequently, on 13 August 2020, Haridass wrote to WongPartnership seeking the return of the Garnished Sums. 11', 'On 20 August 2020, WongPartnership responded that they were taking their client\u2019s instructions and would endeavour to respond by 1 September 2020. 12', 'On 1 September 2020, however, WongPartnership indicated that they were still taking their client\u2019s instructions. 13', '25\\u2003In the absence of a response, Mr Sithat applied to the High Court on 4 September 2020 for the return of the Garnished Sums in HC\/SUM 3785\/2020 (\u201cSUM 3785\/2020\u201d). SUM 3785\/2020 sought return of the Garnished Sums with interest of 5.33% per annum from the date of the respective FGOs until payment to Mr Sithat.', '26\\u2003Mr Sithat\u2019s position was essentially that Sanum had no legal basis for retaining the Garnished Sums. Sanum\u2019s position in the application was that the order should not be granted as the Lao Appellants had failed to seek the necessary orders in CA 113 and could not now seek to improve their position in SUM 3785\/2020. 14', 'Sanum also argued that the correct forum for seeking the consequential orders was the Court of Appeal. Further, or in the alternative, it was not just or equitable for the court to order the return of the Garnished Sums as it would render any potential award or order made by an International Chamber of Commerce (\u201cICC\u201d) tribunal in Sanum\u2019s favour in the Macau-seated arbitration against the Lao Appellants nugatory. 15', '27\\u2003The application was heard on 9 and 12 November 2020 by the Judge. On 12 November 2020, the Judge held that under O 92 rr 4 and 5 of the ROC, she did not have the power to make the consequential orders sought in SUM 3785\/2020, and dismissed the application.', '28\\u2003Alongside these developments in Singapore, on 11 December 2019, Sanum had filed a mediation request with the Macau office of the ICC International Centre of Alternative Dispute Resolution. The request to mediate was refused by the Lao Appellants. On 29 January 2020, Sanum commenced a Macau-seated arbitration with the ICC International Court of Arbitration (\u201cthe ICC Arbitration\u201d). On 9 November 2020, in those proceedings, Sanum filed an application to the tribunal (\u201cthe ICC Tribunal\u201d) for interim measures, to enable it to retain the Garnished Sums pending the resolution of the ICC Arbitration. This was withdrawn without prejudice in the light of the dismissal of SUM 3785\/2020 (see [27] above). However, when the Lao Appellants renewed their request before this court for the Garnished Sums to be returned in November 2020 by way of correspondence (see [30] below), Sanum renewed its application to the ICC Tribunal for interim measures on 30 November 2020 (\u201cthe Interim Measures Application\u201d). 16', '29\\u2003On 25 January 2021, the Interim Measures Application was heard by the ICC Tribunal. On 26 March 2021, the ICC Tribunal granted the following interim measures (\u201cthe Interim Measures\u201d): 17', '(a)\\u2003Sanum would retain the Garnished Sums unless and until a Singapore court ordered them to be returned to Mr Sithat.', '(b)\\u2003If and when a Singapore court ordered the Garnished Sums to be returned, the moneys would be placed in an escrow account pending a final award in the ICC Arbitration, less any amounts that Sanum might have by then paid to the ICC towards the Lao Appellants\u2019 costs deposits and fees and the sum of S$7,224.50 awarded as costs in SUM 3785\/2020.'"}
{"casename":"2022_SGCA_20","fact":"background of mental disturbance less than a \nformally diagnosed mental disorder could provide a \nreason not to impose the death penalty.\n9 On examination, it was plain that the four \u201creasons\u201d for the judicial \nreview application were almost identical to the four grounds that had been stated \nin the motion papers in CM 6 as the grounds on which leave to commence \ncriminal review proceedings should be granted. The only significant difference \nbetween the two was the sentence in para (c) of the reasons: \u201cWhereas the first \nPlaintiff, Pausi bin Jefridin\u2019s IQ was assessed at 67\u201d. This sentence was not \npresent in the CM 6 motion papers.\n10 Mr Yeo also stated in his affidavit that court proceedings involving one \nMr Nagaenthran a\/l K Dharmalingam (\u201cMr Nagaenthran\u201d) which concerned \nVersion No 1: 09 Mar 2022 (12:39 hrs)\nRoslan bin Bakar v AG[2022] SGCA 20\n6issues regarding the imposition of the death penalty, similar to those raised in \nrespect of the appellants, was pending in this court and would come up for \nhearing on 1 March 2022. The implication was that the application should not \nbe heard until this court had dealt with Mr Nagaenthran\u2019s case which is \nCA\/CA 61 of 2021 (\u201cCA 61\u201d).\n11 It should be noted that the affidavit did not contain any factual material \nwhatsoever. In particular, there was no material relating to the alleged mental \nimpairment of the appellants or either of them. Nor was there any material to \nsupport the prayer for a declaration that the execution of the appellants would \nbe in breach of an internal policy of the Singapore Prisons not to execute \nmentally disabled persons.\n12 The Judge, as stated, dismissed OS 139. In his oral grounds of decision, \nhe noted that the requirements for leave to commence judicial review \nproceedings are that:\n(a) The subject matter of the complaint has to be susceptible to \njudicial review;\n(b) The applicants need to have sufficient interest in the matter; and\n(c) The materials before the court must disclose an arguable or \nprima facie case of reasonable suspicion in favour of granting \nthe remedies sought by the applicants.\nIn the case before him, only the third requirement was in dispute.\n13 The Judge noted that the fundamental factual assertion on which the \napplication was based was that the appellants suffered from an abnormality of \nmind by reason of their alleged low IQs. In court, Mr Yeo clarified that the \nVersion No 1: 09 Mar 2022 (12:39 hrs)\nRoslan bin Bakar v AG[2022] SGCA 20\n7ground being advocated was that, by reason of their alleged low IQs, carrying \nout the sentence of death on them would be in breach of Arts 9 and 12 of the \nConstitution. This ground was predicated on the submission that executing a \nperson who has a low IQ is against customary international law, which ought to \nbe part of Singapore law. The Judge observed that this ground before him was \nthe same as that ventilated before us in CM 6. CM 6 had been dismissed because \nthere was no new material, in terms of both evidence and legal arguments, that \nwarranted leave being granted to the appellants to make an application to review \nthis court\u2019s earlier decisions in CCA 59 and CCA 26. He noted also that in those \ndecisions, this court had agreed with the trial judge that the appellants did not \nsuffer from any abnormality of mind.\n14 It therefore appeared to the Judge that the application before him was an \nattempt to re-open issues which had already been dealt with in the re-sentencing \napplications which had culminated in CCA 59 and CCA 26 and, more recently, \nin CM 6. This attempt to re-open issues that had already been decided, led to \nthe conclusion that the third requirement was not satisfied in relation to the first \nground. Further, there was no evidence of any rule of customary international \nlaw prohibiting the execution of intellectually disabled persons or that the \nexecution of such persons amounted to inhuman punishment. Therefore, the \nargument based on Arts 9 and 12 of the Constitution and customary \ninternational law did not satisfy the third requirement for leave to be granted.\n15 The Judge observed that, as regards the second ground relating to the \nalleged internal policy of the Singapore Prison Service, there was no evidence \nin the supporting papers to support the existence of such a policy. As there was \nno evidential basis for it, the Judge could not consider that ground. It should be \nnoted that before the Judge, counsel for the respondent drew the court\u2019s \nattention to the fact that in CA 61 in relation to Mr Nagaenthran, the Singapore \nVersion No 1: 09 Mar 2022 (12:39 hrs)\nRoslan bin Bakar v AG[2022] SGCA 20\n8Prison Service had categorically refuted the existence of such a policy. Mr Yeo \ndid not challenge that refutation. As regards the third ground, the Judge rejected \nit on the basis that it was settled law that the principle of judicial mercy applies \nat the stage of sentencing. The matter before the Judge was well past that stage \nand there was no reference to that ground in the supporting papers. Therefore, \nthat ground was also of no assistance to the appellants."}
{"casename":"2022_SGCA_21","fact":"'3\\u2003On the afternoon of 23 February 2015, one Dzulkarnain bin Khamis (\u201cDzulkarnain\u201d) collected a brown box from a bus stop near Tuas Checkpoint (\u201cthe Tuas Bus Stop\u201d). He then drove to Lorong 37 Geylang (\u201cLorong 37\u201d) where he dropped the brown box near a green dustbin before driving off. Shortly after Dzulkarnain had driven away, Sanjay drove to Lorong 37 and retrieved a box from near the same green dustbin. After doing so, he returned to his car and left. He was apprehended by a team of Central Narcotics Bureau (\u201cCNB\u201d) officers at around 4.35pm. At about the same time, Dzulkarnain was also arrested by another team of CNB officers.', '4\\u2003During the course of investigations, the box which was recovered from Sanjay (referred to for convenience as \u201cthe SKP Box\u201d) was found to contain not less than 2375.1 grams of cannabis (\u201cthe Drugs\u201d). Investigative statements were taken from Sanjay. Relevant to the present case, at the time of his arrest, Sanjay gave a contemporaneous statement (\u201cSanjay\u2019s contemporaneous statement\u201d) stating that he did not know the contents of the SKP Box. He later gave a cautioned statement to the Investigation Officer, Senior Staff Sergeant Ranjeet s\/o Ram Behari (\u201cIO Ranjeet\u201d) on 24 February 2015 (\u201cSanjay\u2019s cautioned statement\u201d) in which he asserted that he was told by \u201ca guy called Malaysia Boy\u201d that the contents of the SKP Box \u201cwas illegal cigarettes\u201d. We observed that Sanjay did not sign the cautioned statement, though the Judge was satisfied that it was an accurate record of what Sanjay had said to IO Ranjeet.', '5\\u2003Both Dzulkarnain and Sanjay claimed trial, and were convicted by the Judge. The Judge explained her reasons for doing so: see Public Prosecutor v Dzulkarnain bin Khamis and another [2021] SGHC 48 (the \u201cGD\u201d). The Judge found that there was no break in the chain of custody, and thus Sanjay did possess the Drugs: GD at [75]. It was also undisputed that Sanjay knew that the SKP Box contained items, and thus the element of knowing possession was established: GD at [80]. She also found that Sanjay had intended to effect onward delivery of the Drugs, and so she was satisfied that he had been in possession of the Drugs for the purposes of trafficking: GD at [113]. This left the question of whether Sanjay knew that the SKP Box contained the Drugs.', '6\\u2003Sanjay\u2019s position was that he thought that the SKP Box contained hunting knives and possibly illegal cigarettes. The Judge rejected this contention for multiple reasons. One of her reasons was that Sanjay\u2019s position as to what he thought the SKP Box contained had evolved overtime. In particular, she made reference to Sanjay\u2019s cautioned statement, where he only mentioned cigarettes, and Sanjay\u2019s contemporaneous statement, where he stated that he did not know what was in the SKP Box. Sanjay had argued that his cautioned statement was not recorded properly. However, the Judge found that there was no reason for any of the CNB officers including IO Ranjeet to record any of the statements improperly, including Sanjay\u2019s cautioned statement: GD at [84].', '7\\u2003As we have noted above, Sanjay was convicted and sentenced to death on one charge of trafficking in 2375.1 grams of cannabis. Dzulkarnain was also found guilty of trafficking in the same and was sentenced to life imprisonment.'"}
{"casename":"2022_SGCA_22","fact":"'6\\u2003Ms Kwa, as the Testator\u2019s solicitor, prepared a total of six wills (\u201cthe Wills\u201d) for the Testator between 20 August 2011 and 2 November 2012. Ms Kwa was not involved in the preparation of the Testator\u2019s last will (\u201cthe Seventh Will\u201d). That was prepared for execution by the Testator, by or under the supervision of Ms Lee Suet Fern, who was the Testator\u2019s daughter-in-law and wife of one of the Executors, Mr Lee Hsien Yang. The Seventh Will was executed on 17 December 2013. The Testator passed away on 23 March 2015. The executors of the Testator\u2019s estate (\u201cthe Estate\u201d) are two of his three children, Dr Lee Wei Ling and Mr Lee Hsien Yang (as the appeal against Dr Lee has been withdrawn, we shall refer to Mr Lee Hsien Yang as the Respondent). The Executors, along with the Testator\u2019s other child, Mr Lee Hsien Loong, are the beneficiaries of the Estate. On 5 September 2019, the Executors lodged four complaints with the Law Society against Ms Kwa\u2019s conduct in connection with the preparation of the Wills.', '7\\u2003The four complaints alleged as follows:', '(a)\\u2003The First Complaint: Ms Kwa failed to comply with the Testator\u2019s specific instructions to destroy the Wills;', '(b)\\u2003The Second Complaint: Ms Kwa had wrongfully disclosed privileged and confidential documents to Mr Lee Hsien Loong without the approval of the Executors, by way of her letters dated 4 and 22 June 2015 to all the Beneficiaries;', '(c)\\u2003The Third Complaint: Ms Kwa failed to keep proper contemporaneous records of all the instructions that were given by the Testator to her and all the advice that she rendered to the Testator; and', '(d)\\u2003The Fourth Complaint: Ms Kwa had given the Executors a false and misleading impression in her letters dated 4 and 22 June 2015, by omitting to mention certain discussions between her and the Testator in November and December 2013.', '8\\u2003The Law Society convened the IC to examine these complaints. The IC found unanimously, in the First IC Report dated 8 May 2020, that:', '(a)\\u2003the First and Second Complaints had been made out on a prima facie standard, and should be referred to a DT for further investigations; and', '(b)\\u2003 the Third and Fourth Complaints were not made out on a prima facie standard and should be dismissed.', '9\\u2003Following the IC\u2019s recommendations, the Council considered that it was empowered to remit the matter to the IC for reconsideration and so, pursuant to s 87(1)(d) of the LPA, it remitted the matter to the IC for further consideration on 3 July 2020, raising the following queries in respect of the First and Second Complaints:', '(a)\\u2003The First Complaint: The Council inquired whether \u201cthe IC considered if there is a distinction between destruction of a will and something that goes towards invalidation of a previous will\u201d. The Council also asked that the IC \u201cconsider the subject of the solicitor keeping a record of that will for the purposes of their own file copy\u201d, and whether there would be any wrongdoing by a solicitor who had complied with the client\u2019s intention to revoke a will, but had not complied with an instruction to destroy all copies of that will if the solicitor wished to maintain a file copy of the same for the solicitor\u2019s own records.', '(b)\\u2003The Second Complaint: The Council asked if the IC had considered whether there was a \u201cwaiver of privilege by reason of the [Executors\u2019] making Facebook\/social media posts\u201d.', '10\\u2003The IC subsequently issued its Second IC Report dated 3 August 2020, maintaining by a majority its original position that the Second Complaint be referred to a DT. In respect of the First Complaint, the IC held a hearing on 22 July 2020 to hear Ms Kwa\u2019s responses to certain matters raised with her. The IC then concluded unanimously in the Second IC Report that the First Complaint be dismissed on the basis that the documentary evidence failed to demonstrate that the Testator had \u201cexpressly intended for all of his prior Wills to be physically destroyed or torn apart by [Ms Kwa]\u201d.', '11\\u2003The Law Society then wrote to the Executors on 7 September 2020, informing them of the Council\u2019s acceptance of the IC\u2019s findings, and its recommendation that a formal investigation by a DT was not necessary save in respect of the Second Complaint.', '12\\u2003The Executors, being dissatisfied with the dismissal of the First, Third and Fourth Complaints, sought an order in the High Court to direct the Law Society to apply to the Chief Justice for the appointment of a DT for a formal investigation into the conduct of Ms Kwa in relation to each of those complaints. As stated above at [5], the present appeal centers around the First Complaint.', '13\\u2003The key issue of this appeal revolves around the interpretation of s 87 of the LPA, which provides as follows:', '14\\u2003Notably, there had been several earlier amendments to this provision. In the original iteration of s 87 of the LPA, which was then s 88 of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 217, 1970 Rev Ed) (\u201cLPA 1970\u201d), there was no provision corresponding to s 87(1)(a) or s 87(2). In 1979, the LPA was amended by the Legal Profession Act (Amendment) Act 1979 (Act 11 of 1979) (\u201cthe LPA 1979 amendments\u201d) to introduce the predecessor of s 87(2), which was then s 88(1A):', '15\\u2003In the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 1990 Rev Ed), s 88(1A) was renumbered as s 87(2). The current iteration of s 87(1A) was introduced by way of the Legal Profession (Amendment) Act 2008 (Act 19 of 2008) (\u201cthe 2008 amendments\u201d), as were the words \u201cread with any response or further report submitted under subsection (1A)(b)\u201d in ss 87(2) and (3). Section 87(1A) sets out the timeline for the IC to respond after the Council has made a determination to refer a matter back to the DT. The significance of these amendments is a point of contention in this appeal.', '16\\u2003The Judge allowed the Executors\u2019 application in respect of the First and Fourth Complaints. With respect to the First Complaint, the Law Society contends, among other things, that the Judge erred in her interpretation of s 87 of the LPA. The Judge held that the Council had no power to pose further queries to the IC once the IC had determined in its First IC Report that a prima facie case has been made out. This was based on the Judge\u2019s interpretation of s 87 of LPA (Lee Wei Ling HC at [55]).', '17\\u2003The Judge first considered the possible interpretations of s 87, applying the framework set out in Tan Cheng Bock v Attorney-General [2017] 2 SLR 850 (\u201cTan Cheng Bock\u201d). The Judge found that the plain text of s 87 of the LPA could support both interpretations advanced by the parties. The Judge considered that the plain reading of s 87(2) circumscribes s 87(1), and on this view, the Council would be bound to follow the IC\u2019s recommendation, once it recommended that there be a formal investigation. However, the Judge also recognised that the plain text of s 87(2) could also support the interpretation advanced by the Law Society: indeed, there appears to be nothing in the section that disables the Council from exercising its power under subsection (1)(d) to refer the matter back to the IC for reconsideration. Further, if the IC\u2019s report was to be \u201cread with any \u2026 further report\u201d as stated in subsection (2), it would follow that the Council has the power to refer the matter back to the IC for reconsideration and for the issuance of a further report as provided for in s 87(1)(d), even where the IC had initially recommended a formal investigation in its first report (Lee Wei Ling HC at [43]).', '18\\u2003Having identified the possible interpretations of the provision, the Judge then sought to apply the second step of the Tan Cheng Bock framework which calls for the court to examine the legislative purpose or object of the statute. In this context, the Judge examined the historical development of the LPA and noted that the original iteration of s 87 in LPA 1970 (see above at [14]) afforded the Council a general discretion to refer the matter back to the IC for reconsideration, as provided in s 88(1)(d) of the LPA 1970. However, there was no provision in the LPA 1970 that corresponded to the present s 87(2). The LPA 1979 amendments inserted the equivalent of s 87(2), which was then numbered as s 88(1A). Pursuant to what was then s 88(1A)(a), the Council became obliged to determine \u201caccordingly\u201d where the IC recommended a formal investigation. This constrained the powers of the Council by removing the discretion it previously had, not to advance a matter to the next stage of the disciplinary process in certain circumstances; thus, where the IC recommends a formal investigation, the Council has no choice but to refer the matter to a formal investigation. The Judge thought that this meant that the Council was no longer empowered to invoke subsection (1)(d) where an IC had concluded that a formal investigation was necessary (Lee Wei Ling HC at [49]).', '19\\u2003The Judge then considered the 2008 amendments and concluded that these did not revive the Council\u2019s previously existing power to refer a matter back to the IC for reconsideration where that power had been taken away based on her conclusion as to the effect of the 1979 amendments. First, the addition of subsection (1A) was purely of procedural significance in that it provides for a stipulated timeline once the Council has referred a matter back to the IC. This was designed only to expedite the process. Second, since the addition of subsection (1A) was merely procedural in effect, the addition of the words \u201cread with any response or further report submitted under subsection (1A)(b)\u201d in subsection (2) must have been an ancillary harmonising amendment to accommodate the timelines under subsection (1A). It could not have the effect of granting the Council a fresh power to refer the matter back to the IC. Further, the Judge noted that there is no express provision in subsection (2) empowering the Council to refer a matter back to the IC (Lee Wei Ling HC at [53]).', '20\\u2003The Judge then sought to apply the third step of the Tan Cheng Bock framework, which is to compare the possible interpretations of the text against the purpose or object of the statute, preferring the interpretation that furthers the purpose of the statute. The Judge concluded that the Executors were correct in their interpretation. The Judge thought that the effect of the 1979 amendments to the LPA was to circumscribe the Council\u2019s power by enacting what is now s 87(2). She thought that by virtue of this, the Council no longer had the power to refer a matter back to the IC for reconsideration in circumstances where the IC had determined that the matter should proceed to a formal investigation before a DT. She also considered the 2008 amendments to the LPA, which included the insertion of the words \u201cread with any response or further report\u201d, in subsections (2) and (3) and concluded that this did not empower the Council to refer the matter back to the IC, but only dealt with the situation where the Council retained the power to refer the matter back to the IC even after the 1979 amendments (Lee Wei Ling HC at [54]). The Council was therefore obliged to accept the IC\u2019s recommendation in the First IC Report to refer the First Complaint to the DT, and it was procedurally defective for the Council to have referred the matter back to the IC in the present case (Lee Wei Ling HC at [55]).', '21\\u2003In any case, even if the Council was empowered to refer the matter back to the IC for reconsideration in this case, the Judge was of the view that the First Complaint should have been referred to the DT. In relation to the queries raised by the Council in connection with the First Complaint, the Judge found that the IC did not address these queries in the Second IC Report, but instead made some factual findings there to the effect that there was insufficient evidence of the Testator having instructed the solicitor to physically destroy his former wills. The Judge considered that such factual issues should have been referred to the appropriate fact-finding body, namely, the DT. These factual findings also departed from the recommendation in the First IC Report that there was a prima facie question as to whether the Testator had instructed Ms Kwa to destroy any of the wills. Given that the Second IC Report gave a conflicting view in contrast to the First IC Report, the Council should not have accepted the findings in the Second IC Report (Lee Wei Ling HC at [62]). The Judge accordingly directed that the First Complaint be referred to a DT (Lee Wei Ling HC at [94]).'"}

Hydralift is a company incorporated in Norway while KFELS is a company incorporated in Singapore. The Contract is governed by Singapore law and contains an agreement for disputes to be resolved by arbitration in Singapore.', '9\\u2003A dispute under the Contract arose between KFELS and Hydralift in 1999 in relation to certain alleged defects in the works by Hydralift and the parties tried in vain to resolve this until sometime in 2007. KFELS commenced the arbitration against Hydralift on 27 June 2007, seeking the equivalent of $5.5m in damages for breach of contract.', '10\\u2003However, by this time, Hydralift was no longer in existence. In 2002, it became a wholly owned subsidiary of a Norwegian company called National Oilwell-Hydralift AS (\u201cNOH\u201d). On 6 October 2004, it merged with NOH and was struck off the Norwegian register of companies. Then, on 15 October 2004, NOH merged with National Oilwell Norway AS (which is the predecessor of NOV Norway), a company incorporated in Norway. We refer to the two mergers hereafter as the \u201c2004 mergers\u201d. In 2010, National Oilwell Norway AS changed its name to NOV Norway.', '11\\u2003NOV Norway, in the name of Hydralift, defended the claim and mounted a counterclaim for the equivalent of $1.2m in damages against KFELS for alleged breach of contract.', '12\\u2003KFELS knew that Hydralift had been acquired around 2002 but it denies knowledge of the 2004 mergers or the fact that Hydralift ceased to exist as a result of the merger. It claims that it only learnt in 2019 that Hydralift ceased to exist. NOV Norway for its part accepts that it did not disclose to KFELS that Hydralift had ceased to exist, but maintains that KFELS must have been aware of the mergers.', '13\\u2003An arbitral tribunal was constituted in 2008 (the \u201cTribunal\u201d). In 2015, KFELS filed three originating summonses (HC\/OS 168\/2015 (\u201cOS 168\u201d), HC\/OS 223\/2015, and HC\/OS 680\/2015) in the High Court to remove one or more members of the Tribunal on grounds of alleged impartiality. In these applications, KFELS named the Tribunal members and Hydralift as defendants. The Judge dismissed the applications and awarded $50,000 in costs, ostensibly in favour of Hydralift. In 2016, KFELS filed another originating summons, CA\/OS 15\/2016, before this court seeking leave to appeal against the Judge\u2019s refusal to grant leave for KFELS to appeal to this court against the dismissal of its application for the proceedings in OS 168 to be continued as if it had been commenced by writ under O 28 r 8(1) of the Rules of Court. The originating summons again named the Tribunal members and Hydralift as defendants. The leave application was dismissed and we awarded $2,000 in costs again, in favour of Hydralift. For convenience, we refer to these applications as \u201cthe related litigation\u201d.', '14\\u2003The Tribunal issued the Award on 4 September 2019, dismissing the claim by KFELS and allowing the counterclaim by Hydralift.

Interlocutory judgment for damages to be assessed was entered against PT Trikomsel in both suits. Among other things, the judgments made it liable for fraudulent misrepresentations contained in offering circulars for two tranches of \u201cSenior Fixed Rate Notes\u201d which the applicants had purchased. Damages then had to be assessed.', '3\\u2003By the time of the assessment of damages hearings, the writs of summons against the other defendants in the suits had either expired without being served or had been set aside. The only remaining defendant in both suits was PT Trikomsel. At the assessment hearings, the applicants were awarded damages on the normal compensatory basis against PT Trikomsel. The applicants were dissatisfied, however, as they had failed to obtain punitive and aggravated damages. The High Court Judge (\u201cJudge\u201d) rejected the latter claims as they were not specifically pleaded. AD 4 and AD 5 are the applicants\u2019 appeals against the Judge\u2019s dismissal of their claims for punitive and aggravated damages.', '4\\u2003The sequence of events that gave rise to SUM 4 and 5 is as follows. OS 2 and OS 3 (collectively, \u201cthe Transfer Applications\u201d), were filed on 26 January 2022. The applicants seek to transfer the appeals to this court on the basis that a decision of this court, Noor Azlin bte Abdul Rahman and another v Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd [2021] SGCA 111 (\u201cNoor Azlin\u201d), is implicated in the appeals (see s 29D(2)(c)(ii) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1969 (2020 Rev Ed) read with O 56A r 12(3)(d) of the Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed) (\u201cROC\u201d)). Briefly, the applicants seek to persuade this court to reverse its holding in Noor Azlin that punitive and aggravated damages must be specifically pleaded. By letters dated 27 January 2022 (\u201c27 Jan letters\u201d) from the Registry of the Supreme Court, PT Trikomsel was directed to file its papers in the Transfer Applications by 7 February 2022. However, at a Case Management Conference on 8 February 2022 it came to light that the applicants had not served the Transfer Applications on PT Trikomsel. In addition, it appears that the 27 Jan letters were dispatched, but not to PT Trikomsel\u2019s last known address in Central Jakarta (\u201cAddress 2\u201d). The 27 Jan letters were only sent to PT Trikomsel\u2019s previous address in Jakarta (\u201cAddress 1\u201d). This was because Address 1 was the address stated by the applicants in the Transfer Applications. In a letter to the court dated 10 February 2022, the applicants claimed that Address 1 was stated in the Transfer Applications because they had learnt that PT Trikomsel had changed its registered address to Address 2 only after issuing those proceedings.', '5\\u2003Pertinently, for the purpose of this judgment, the applicants were granted leave to serve the Writs of Summons (\u201cWrits\u201d) in Suits 564 and 565 on PT Trikomsel at Address 1 in January 2019.

On 12 May 2020, the Judge placed OTPL under interim judicial management and appointed the IJMs over OTPL. After their appointment, the IJMs of both the Companies retained the legal services of R&T.', '6\\u2003At the material time, the Lims were directors of both the Companies. On 9 and 21 July 2020, the Lims caused the Injunction Applications to be commenced in the names of the Companies.

Likewise, neither of the Lims sought the consent of the JMs to proceed with the Injunction Applications following the court order placing the Companies under judicial management. Rather, the Lims purported to act unilaterally on behalf of the Companies in filing and proceeding with the Injunction Applications. The significance of this fact shall become apparent.', '8\\u2003On 5 October 2020, R&T filed the Striking Out Applications seeking to strike out the Injunction Applications in their entirety.

He dismissed the Joinder Applications but allowed the Striking Out Applications. In respect of the latter, he considered that neither Mr CM Lim nor Ms HC Lim possessed managerial powers qua directors to commence the Injunction Applications in the names of the Companies. They consequently had no standing and the Injunction Applications were taken out without due authority. In making this finding, the Judge rejected the Lims\u2019 argument that notwithstanding the Companies having been placed under interim judicial management, the Lims continued to possess residual powers of management as directors under common law that empowered them to commence the Injunction Applications in the Companies\u2019 names (see the Striking Out Judgment at [45]).', '10\\u2003On 27 and 30 November 2020, the present appeals against the Judge\u2019s decision allowing the Striking Out Applications were filed on behalf of the Companies.', '11\\u2003Subsequently, on 5 February 2021, the JMs of HLT filed an application for HLT to be wound up.

Given the interconnectedness of HLT\u2019s and OTPL\u2019s businesses, OTPL too engaged R&T to advise on available restructuring options. Up until 17 April 2020, the Lims were the sole directors and shareholders of the Companies. On that date, Mr OK Lim stepped down as a director amidst admissions on affidavit made in support of the Companies\u2019 applications for interim moratoriums to be granted under s 211B of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (the \u201cAct\u201d) for both Companies. These affidavits stated that HLT and OTPL were both in parlous financial positions, owing to, among other things, Mr OK Lim\u2019s own conduct in having instructed that HLT\u2019s financial statements not disclose approximately US$800m in future losses. Mr CM Lim and Ms HC Lim, however, remained directors of the Companies.', '7\\u2003As stated above, on 17 April 2020, HLT and OTPL filed HC\/OS 405\/2020 (\u201cOS 405\u201d) and HC\/OS 406\/2020 (\u201cOS 406\u201d) respectively.

This step was in part spurred on by significant creditor resistance to, and the absence of any relevant creditor support for, the proposed debt restructuring. On 27 April 2020, the Judge granted HLT leave to withdraw OS 405 and appointed IJMs over HLT, in the face of significant creditor resistance to a debtor-in-possession restructuring.', '9\\u2003On 6 May 2020, OTPL took a similar step.

Whilst they contested the Striking Out Applications, the response of the Lims was to file the Joinder Applications a week later, on 12 October 2020. The purpose of the Joinder Applications was to procure the joinder of the Lims as applicants to the Injunction Applications.', '14\\u2003On 4 November 2020, the Judge heard the Striking Out Applications and the Joinder Applications together.

The Judge dismissed the Mukherjees\u2019 claim in respect of returns on the investments in Swajas and Farmlands (see the Judgment at [112] and [208], respectively).', '9\\u2003In 2014, the Mukherjees brought S 1270 against Mr Biswas.

IOGPL owned the single share in IOEL. In July 2012, IOEL made two remittances to the Mukherjees\u2019 UOB account, amounting to US$1.6m. IOGPL\u2019s case was that these were loans as Mrs Mukherjee needed funds for her business. Mrs Mukherjee refuted this, taking the position that the transfers of US$1.6m were the Mukherjees\u2019 own funds and the transfers were made pursuant to their instructions (see the Judgment at [275]\u2013[279]).', '11\\u2003The two suits were heard together and disposed of collectively. On 11 December 2018, the Judge found Mr Biswas to be in breach of fiduciary duties owed to the Mukherjees. Mr Biswas was made liable to pay the Mukherjees US$3.45m for the Investments (see the Judgment at [273]). The Judge dismissed S 417, finding that the US$1.6m was indeed the Mukherjees\u2019 funds which they had given to Mr Biswas to manage (see the Judgment at [274]\u2013[294]). The Judge ordered that costs be taxed if not agreed. Parties were unable to agree on costs.', '12\\u2003Mr Biswas and IOGPL appealed against the Judge\u2019s decision in the Judgment vide CA 2 and CA 3, respectively.

The appellant provided the CNB with what he believed to be Anand\u2019s full name, identification number, present and previous addresses, vehicle description and registration number, pictures and other related information. According to the appellant, this information could not have been furnished any earlier as it was only uncovered post-appeal through the efforts of the appellant\u2019s family (see the GD at [58]).', '7\\u2003After the dismissal of his appeal against conviction and sentence, the appellant, his family and his solicitors at the time submitted petitions for clemency to the President.

The stated reason as selected from a drop-down menu was \u201c[i]nterview inmate who may become a defence witness\u201d. At this time, Zamri had been convicted on a capital charge and was awaiting execution.', '10\\u2003On 11 June 2019, the Attorney-General\u2019s Chambers (\u201cAGC\u201d) wrote to the appellant\u2019s solicitors requesting \u201cfull particulars as to how, and why, any evidence that Zamri may provide would be relevant to [the appellant\u2019s] intended application\u201d. The appellant\u2019s solicitors replied that they were unable to provide the information requested as (a) they had not yet interviewed Zamri; (b) they were unable to disclose the appellant\u2019s instructions as they were confidential; and (c) the contents of the interview with Zamri would be protected by litigation privilege. Further correspondence was exchanged by the parties between 11 June 2019 and 14 June 2019. In this exchange, the AGC took the position that no privilege attached to the information sought. By 14 June 2019, the request to interview Zamri had not been approved, so the appellant\u2019s solicitors did not interview him on that date.', '11\\u2003On 19 June 2019, the appellant\u2019s solicitors wrote to the AGC stating that the appellant had authorised them to disclose the relevance of Zamri\u2019s potential evidence. Specifically, Zamri was the person identified as Jimmy in the appellant\u2019s statements to the CNB, and the appellant believed that the information he provided regarding Jimmy had led to Zamri\u2019s arrest. The appellant\u2019s solicitors also set out the contents of what Zamri had informed the appellant, explaining that they wished to interview Zamri in order to confirm this information and reduce Zamri\u2019s evidence into an affidavit. On this basis, the appellant\u2019s solicitors inquired whether the SPS would approve their request to interview Zamri.', '12\\u2003On 20 June 2019, the AGC again refused the appellant\u2019s request on the basis that the appellant was already able to plead his case in respect of his application for leave to commence judicial review.', '13\\u2003On 24 June 2019, the appellant filed HC\/OS 807\/2019 (\u201cOS 807\u201d) seeking the leave of the court to commence judicial review proceedings. The appellant\u2019s application was based on three main grounds.', '14\\u2003First, the decision of the PP not to issue him a CSA (\u201cthe PP Decision\u201d) was contested. The appellant argued that as he had not been served with a notice informing him of the possibility that he could avoid the death penalty by providing substantive assistance (the Mandatory Death Penalty Notice, hereafter abbreviated \u201cthe MDP Notice\u201d), the PP Decision was unconstitutional and\/or tainted by procedural impropriety. Furthermore, given that he had substantively assisted the CNB by providing information about Jimmy and Anand, the PP Decision was illegal and\/or irrational. The appellant also argued that the question of the grant of the CSA to him had to be reviewed by the sitting AG at the time that the appellant was due to be sentenced.', '15\\u2003Second, the appellant contested the Cabinet\u2019s action in advising the President not to commute his death sentence (\u201cthe Cabinet Advice\u201d). The appellant contended that the Cabinet had failed to take into account the substantive assistance he had rendered to the CNB.', '16\\u2003Third, the SPS\u2019s refusal to grant him access to interview Zamri (\u201cthe SPS Decision\u201d) was impugned. The appellant alleged that such refusal was irrational, procedurally improper and motivated by the improper purpose of seeking the premature disclosure of privileged information and frustrating the appellant\u2019s preparation for his case.', '17\\u2003On 25 June 2019, the AGC informed the appellant that since he had filed OS 807 and had stated on affidavit his case in relation to Zamri, the SPS had no objections to the appellant\u2019s solicitors interviewing Zamri.

To date, the appellant and SK are the registered joint owners of Unit 174.', '11\\u2003Similarly, the occupancy of the Yishun Flats and the Property changed several times over the years (see the Judgment at [16]\u2013[18]):', '(a)\\u2003Except for KG who was married in 1989, most of the Ong family resided in the Yishun Flats after moving out of the kampong.

The respondents claimed that the Property was a family asset held by the appellant on a common intention constructive trust for each of the Ong siblings, who were entitled to equal beneficial shares. Further, they claimed that the doctrine of proprietary estoppel precluded the appellant from denying that he held the Property for the benefit of all the siblings in equal shares.'"}

OS 1185 was an application by Mr Seow for an order for taxation of a bill of costs under s 120 of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 2009 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe LPA\u201d).', '3\\u2003The background to OS 1185 was as follows. Sometime in April 2020, Rajah & Tann Singapore LLP (\u201cR&T\u201d) was engaged by Hin Leong Trading Pte Ltd (\u201cHLT\u201d) to carry out some corporate restructuring work. R&T required HLT to provide funds of S$2m as a deposit for the engagement. HLT duly provided a cheque for the deposit. At the request of his wife (a director of HLT), Mr Seow also provided a cheque to R&T. The parties had intended for Mr Seow\u2019s cheque to be deposited in place of HLT\u2019s own cheque if the latter could not be cleared. In the event, HLT\u2019s own cheque did not clear and Mr Seow\u2019s cheque was deposited into HLT\u2019s client account with R&T. R&T then proceeded to carry out the restructuring work.', '4\\u2003In November 2020, R&T issued an invoice to HLT (which by then had come under the care of judicial managers) for the sum of S$908,955.68 in respect of HLT\u2019s restructuring work done between 8 April 2020 and 27 April 2020. R&T then informed HLT\u2019s judicial managers that it proposed to set off those fees against the sum of S$2m in HLT\u2019s client account (representing the funds from Mr Seow\u2019s cheque) and return the balance to Mr Seow. It does not appear that HLT\u2019s judicial managers objected to the same. R&T then proceeded to debit S$908,955.68 from HLT\u2019s client account and returned the balance to Mr Seow. Mr Seow was however dissatisfied with the quantum of the fees that had been debited and so he sought an order under s 120 of the LPA for R&T\u2019s bill of costs to HLT to be taxed. HLT has since been wound up.', '5\\u2003A preliminary issue stands in the way of this court considering the leave application proper. Sections 29C(1) and (2) of the SCJA provide that an appeal against a decision of the General Division in the exercise of its original or appellate civil jurisdiction is to be made to the Appellate Division and not to the Court of Appeal, unless provided for by the Sixth Schedule to the SCJA or any other written law. Mr Seow considers the Court of Appeal as the appellate court to which an appeal from the Judge\u2019s decision is to be made, and accordingly with which OS 5 should be filed, on the basis that his intended appeal comes within para 1(d) of the Sixth Schedule, which provides as follows:', '6\\u2003It appears that Mr Seow has taken this position for two reasons. First, it is because R&T\u2019s engagement (which gave rise to the disputed bill for which Mr Seow seeks an order for taxation) had arisen in the factual context of HLT\u2019s judicial management and subsequent winding-up. Second, he found it significant that the words in parentheses in para 1(d) of the Sixth Schedule provide for an appeal which did not itself raise any issue relating to the law of insolvency as nevertheless coming within the scope of para 1(d). Presumably, Mr Seow thought that buttressed the first reason because it meant that it did not matter that his intended appeal itself raised no issue relating to HLT\u2019s insolvency and the legal principles or rules which it engaged.'"}

First, there was Z Co, which initially transacted with the respondent, a state-owned company. Then, the appellant, a company in the business of providing business and management consultancy services came onto the scene at the request of one Mr PM, who is the person who controls Z Co and the appellant.', '6\\u2003On or around 7 September 2012, the respondent and Z Co entered into a consultancy agreement (the \u201cConsultancy Agreement\u201d). Pursuant to the Consultancy Agreement, Z Co was to provide consultancy services to the respondent in relation to mergers and acquisitions of oil and gas fields around the world. In exchange, the respondent would pay Z Co a fee (\u201cSuccess Fee\u201d) upon the latter\u2019s presentation of an \u201cOpportunity\u201d and the respondent\u2019s completion of an acquisition of an interest in an oil field pursuant to a sale and purchase agreement or similar document (\u201cSPA\u201d).', '7\\u2003On or around 21 October 2013, the respondent, Z Co and the appellant executed a Deed of Novation, pursuant to which the Consultancy Agreement was novated to the appellant and the respondent and its term extended from 31 December 2012 to 31 December 2013. By the Deed of Novation, the appellant undertook to perform the terms of the Consultancy Agreement as if it were Z Co, and the respondent agreed to perform the terms of the Consultancy Agreement as if the appellant had been an original party thereto in place of Z Co. Additionally, the appellant and the respondent entered into an Assignment, Amended and Restated Consultancy Agreement (the \u201cAmended Agreement\u201d). The terms of the Amended Agreement were, in substance, the same as those of the Consultancy Agreement and, like the Consultancy Agreement, it was to expire at the end of 2013. The three contracts all provided for disputes to be finally resolved by arbitration before the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (\u201cSIAC\u201d).', '8\\u2003Thereafter, a dispute arose over whether the appellant was entitled to payment of Success Fees under the Amended Agreement. The appellant sought payment for the following opportunities which it contended it had presented to the respondent:', '9\\u2003The respondent rebuffed the appellant\u2019s claim on the basis that the Consultancy Agreement and the Amended Agreement had expired and nothing was due thereunder.', '10\\u2003By way of a Notice of Arbitration dated 17 April 2018, the appellant commenced arbitration proceedings against the respondent in the SIAC. The appellant alleged that \u201c[d]espite the successful completion of the Opportunities, and repeated requests \u2026 [the respondent] ha[d] failed, refused, and\/or neglected to pay [it] the corresponding Success Fees under Article 2\u201d of the Consultancy Agreement. The three-member Tribunal was constituted on 1 October 2018. It comprised Mr Lok Vi Ming SC, Mr Christopher Lau SC and Mr VK Rajah SC (Presiding Arbitrator).', '11\\u2003In order to appreciate the respective cases put forward by the parties in the arbitration, one must be familiar with the provisions of the Consultancy Agreement that were in issue. We therefore set out the relevant articles below:', '12\\u2003In its Statement of Claim in the arbitration, the appellant claimed damages in the form of Success Fees as provided for in Article 2 of the Consultancy Agreement. It pleaded that there was an \u201cAgreement\u201d between it and the respondent comprising the Deed of Novation, the Consultancy Agreement and an oral agreement between the parties\u2019 representatives. This reference to an \u201cAgreement\u201d which was partly oral and partly written allowed the appellant to further plead that despite the expiration of the Consultancy Agreement the Success Fees were still payable because:', '(a)\\u2003It was orally agreed between parties that the Consultancy Agreement would be extended for a further period and that it would continue providing the services in question to the respondent as agreed in the Consultancy Agreement. The respondent had also promised it that the said agreement would be reflected in a written contract to be executed in due course.', '(b)\\u2003Further or in the alternative, there was an implied contract between parties on the same terms as the Consultancy Agreement, which governed the interim period between the expiry of the Deed of Novation and the execution of a new written contract.', '(c)\\u2003In any event, the respondent was estopped from denying that the Consultancy Agreement was no longer valid by virtue of the fact that the Deed of Novation had expired. This was because:', '13\\u2003The appellant further mounted an alternative claim. It averred that, in the event the Tribunal did not find that there was such a subsisting agreement beyond the expiry date stated in the Deed of Novation, the appellant was entitled to a reasonable sum based on the law of unjust enrichment. Although the appellant referred only to the Consultancy Agreement and the Deed of Novation in its Notice of Arbitration and its Statement of Claim, no issue arose out of this. In its Response to the Notice of Arbitration, the respondent accepted that the dispute in relation to the Deed of Novation and the Amended Agreement had been referred to arbitration.', '14\\u2003In its Defence, the respondent denied the existence of any subsisting agreement after the Amended Agreement expired on 31 December 2013. It pleaded that:', '(a)\\u2003There was no oral agreement as alleged by the appellant, or any such agreement for a renewal or extension of the Amended Agreement, or a fresh agreement to appoint the appellant as its consultant after 31 December 2013. The appellant also could not satisfy the basic requirements to establish a contract.', '(b)\\u2003There was no implied contract.', '(c)\\u2003It was not estopped as claimed by the appellant. It had repeatedly informed the appellant that the Amended Agreement had expired on 31 December 2013, and there was no shared assumption of any agreement between parties after 31 December 2013.', '(d)\\u2003The appellant\u2019s claim was time-barred, as Article 12 of the Amended Agreement provided that no action or proceeding arising out of the Amended Agreement could be brought by either party more than three months after the expiry of the same. The appellant was additionally not entitled to any reasonable sum for work done, as such a claim would be precluded by the terms of the Amended Agreement during its pendency, and no unjust enrichment took place after the expiry of the Amended Agreement.', '15\\u2003The arbitration was heard by the Tribunal over three days in October 2019. By way of the Award dated 25 September 2020, the Tribunal upheld the appellant\u2019s claims in part. It should be noted that in the Award, for the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal specifically stated that any reference to the Consultancy Agreement included the Amended Agreement and vice versa; and any reference to the appellant included Z Co and vice versa, unless the context clearly indicated otherwise.', '16\\u2003In the Award at [238]\u2013[246], the Tribunal rejected the appellant\u2019s assertion of an \u201cAgreement\u201d that was partly oral and partly written. It found that nothing on the facts or in the terms of the Amended Agreement obliged the respondent to extend the duration of the Amended Agreement during or after its pendency. Further, there was no extension by mutual agreement after 31 December 2013. Nor was there any implied contract as such would be contrary to the terms of the Amended Agreement. Instead, the Tribunal treated the parties\u2019 contract as being entirely contained in the Consultancy Agreement, the Deed of Novation and the Amended Agreement and rendered its decision in favour of the appellant on the basis of its interpretation of those documents and parties\u2019 obligations thereunder.', '17\\u2003The following summary of the findings of the Tribunal make its reasoning clear:', '(a)\\u2003After setting out parties\u2019 respective positions in the Award, the Tribunal stated that it considered that the \u201creal matter at the heart of the proceedings [was] not whether the [Amended Agreement] was extended and\/or a new contract came into existence after it expired\u201d, but rather whether the appellant could maintain claims in respect of the Opportunities proposed by it (or Z Co) which had been accepted by the respondent before the expiry of the Amended Agreement (Award at [247]). The determination of that issue turned on the interpretation of the material terms of the Amended Agreement (Award at [249]).', '(b)\\u2003The appellant had performed all the services requested of it by the respondent (Award at [256]\u2013[257]).', '(c)\\u2003As the Opportunities were introduced by Z Co and thereafter accepted and acted upon by the respondent before the Consultancy Agreement was formally entered into, the formal notice requirements did not apply to them (Award at [267]). This was based on a construction of the Consultancy Agreement and the term \u201cOpportunity\u201d in Article 1.1 in a common-sense way, to give business efficacy and meaning to what the parties as reasonable business entities would have contemplated when the Consultancy Agreement was entered into (Award at [264]). After it was entered into, both parties regarded these two transactions as Opportunities that were already embraced by the Consultancy Agreement and consistently acted on that basis (Award at [267]).', '(d)\\u2003A SPA need not be entered into and\/or completed before the expiry of either the Consultancy Agreement or the Amended Agreement (Award at [274], [275] and [279]). The Tribunal came to this conclusion because it found that:', '(e)\\u2003Once it was recognised that a SPA may be entered into or negotiations in relation to an Opportunity could continue even after the expiry of the Amended Agreement, it was plain that Article 12 did not preclude the arbitration proceedings from being brought. However, Article 12 with its short timeframe was not without meaning or effect, and would apply, for example, if either party were to dispute a termination by the other (Award at [275]).', '(f)\\u2003Under the terms of the Consultancy Agreement and the Amended Agreement and due to the very complex nature of the transactions they encompassed, unless expressly circumscribed by explicit clauses, the right to recover Success Fees was not lost as long as a clear link to the successful completion of the Opportunity was shown. The appellant\u2019s claims for Success Fees were not time barred by Article 12 (Award at [279]).', '(g)\\u2003The requirements concerning the Success Fee claims stipulated by Articles 2.1, 2.3.1, 2.3.2 and 2.3.5 of the Consultancy Agreement were satisfied (Award at [284]).', '(h)\\u2003The appellant\u2019s claim for Success Fees as regards the X Opportunity was allowed, as the subject of an acquisition in 2016, namely, shares in X Co, was exactly the same as in an earlier transaction that Z Co and the appellant had worked on previously and which was later aborted (Award at [301] and [312]). However, the appellant\u2019s claim for Success Fees as regards the Y Opportunity failed as the eventual transaction did not fall within the scope of the Amended Agreement (Award at [319]\u2013[321]).', '18\\u2003On 9 December 2020, the respondent applied to the High Court seeking a setting aside of the parts of the Award relating to the US$5,066,106.86 awarded in favour of the appellant, being its Success Fee as regards the X Opportunity. It relied on s 24(b) of the International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) and Art 34(2)(a)(iii) of the UNICTRAL Model Law of International Commercial Arbitration (the \u201cModel Law\u201d) to contend that the following findings of the Tribunal should be set aside:', '(a)\\u2003The Tribunal\u2019s finding that the appellant had the right to recover Success Fees even after the Consultancy Agreement or the Amended Agreement had expired;', '(b)\\u2003The Tribunal\u2019s finding that the appellant\u2019s right to recover Success Fees was not lost as long as a clear link to the successful completion of the Opportunity could be shown, even after the Consultancy Agreement or the Amended Agreement had expired; and', '(c)\\u2003The Tribunal\u2019s finding that Article 12 of the Consultancy Agreement or the Amended Agreement did not curtail the appellant\u2019s right to claim for Success Fees more than three months after the Consultancy Agreement or the Amended Agreement had expired.'"}

{"casename":"2022_SGCA_44","fact":"facts to support raising those issues and questions before the court. In the present \ncase, there is simply no relevant substratum of facts. \nVersion No 1: 27 May 2022 (09:41 hrs)\nNagaenthran a\/l K Dharmalingam v AG[2022] SGCA 44\n716 Aside from this, in our Judgment, we had also traced the timeline of \nevents which led us to find that the proceedings constituted a blatant and \negregious abuse of the court\u2019s processes (see the Judgment at [8]\u2013[24]). This is \nnot the occasion to repeat all that we have said. But we do observe, for example, \nthat instead of putting their best case forward at the first instance, Mr Ravi and \nMs Netto each drip-fed the supposed evidence and arguments. For instance, \nupon the court declining his request on 9 November 2021 for an adjournment, \nMr Ravi then sought to file two expert reports dated 5 November 2021 and 7 \nNovember 2021 respectively. To date, Mr Ravi has also failed to provide a \nsatisfactory explanation as to why the evidence of Mr Navinkumar was not \nprovided to the court earlier when the same could have been provided to the \nappellant\u2019s expert days before. As for Ms Netto, no explanation was provided \nfor her tendering of a speaking note and further expert report at the last possible \nmoment, during the hearing on 1 March 2022 itself. As we observed in the \nJudgment at [24]: \n\u2026 when every single action on the part of one party is done in \na manner that is contrary to the applicable rules and contrary \neven to basic expectations of fairness to the other party and of \ncourtesy to the court, it becomes difficult to accept that there is \nan innocent explanation for this. This is heightened when either \nno explanations are offered, or explanations that are offered are \nshown to be untrue.\n17 In this light, it is simply impossible to contend that the AGC did not \nincur unnecessary costs.\n18 This leads to the question of whether it is just to make the order. Mr Ravi \nfirst contended that such an order could not be made against a solicitor who is \nno longer practising. No authority was cited and we think this is because it is a \nplainly bad point. The court imposes a personal costs order to reprobate the \nunsatisfactory conduct of counsel appearing before it. The fact that counsel \nVersion No 1: 27 May 2022 (09:41 hrs)\nNagaenthran a\/l K Dharmalingam v AG[2022] SGCA 44\n8subsequently ceases or is unable to practice cannot affect the ability of the court \nto make such an order.\n19 Mr Ravi also made some general comments and submissions to the \neffect that this would constitute a reprisal against the Bar and claimed that both \nadvocates and forensic psychiatrists were being chilled and discouraged from \ntaking on engagements to act for accused persons if such orders were made. \nWith respect, this was a baseless submission. No person, psychiatrist or lawyer, \nhas a licence to appear before a court and act improperly; and if the making of \nan adverse costs order would deter such conduct, then that is precisely what the \npower is there for.\n20 We turn finally to the quantum of costs. We have outlined the AGC\u2019s \ncosts submissions, but we do not accept this as it stands. Although AGC has \nreferenced the Costs Guidelines and asked for costs of $30,000 for CA 61 which \nfalls at the lower end of those guidelines, and $10,000 for CM 30, we consider \nthat costs orders of $15,000 for CA 61 and $5,000 for CM 30 are appropriate \nbecause the facts in this case were not complex (as can be seen from the short \nreply affidavits tendered by AGC) and the applications in CA 61 and CM 30 \nconcerned the same factual matrix and essentially made very similar arguments, \nwhich was in fact a point we noted in explaining that there was an abuse of \nprocess.  \n21 We also disagree with AGC\u2019s submission that Mr Ravi and Ms Netto \nshould be jointly and severally liable for the costs incurred in the proceedings. \nAGC does not contend that Ms Netto was involved in the commencement and \nconduct of CA 61 and CM 30 prior to 17 January 2022. It is not clear then, why \nshe should bear responsibility or the attendant consequences for actions in \nwhich she played no part. Conversely, for conduct which took place after 17 \nVersion No 1: 27 May 2022 (09:41 hrs)\nNagaenthran a\/l K Dharmalingam v AG[2022] SGCA 44\n9January 2022, notwithstanding Mr Ravi\u2019s plainly substantial role (such as in \ndrafting the consolidated submissions and in apparently giving instructions to \nMs Netto throughout the course of the hearing; see the Judgment at [22]), it was \nMs Netto who was the solicitor on record. In short, and without more, we do not \nthink that Mr Ravi\u2019s and Ms Netto\u2019s conduct of the proceedings, when they \nwere each the solicitor on record at different points in time, can or should be \nattributable to the other.\n22 In the circumstances, we consider that Mr Ravi and Ms Netto should \neach be liable only for the costs incurred and wasted as a result of their personal \nconduct during their respective periods acting as the appellant\u2019s solicitor on \nrecord. AGC has provided a breakdown of the work it undertook for CA 61 and \nCM 30 and it appears that the majority of the work undertaken by AGC took \nplace before the change in solicitor, and is therefore attributable to Mr Ravi\u2019s \ninitiation and conduct of the proceedings, rather than to Ms Netto\u2019s subsequent \ncontinuance of the proceedings. \n23 In all the circumstances, we hold that: \n(a) For CA 61, a costs order of $15,000 is appropriate. Mr Ravi and \nMs Netto should be liable for 75% of the costs ($11,250) and 25% of the \ncosts ($3,750) respectively. \nVersion No 1: 27 May 2022 (09:41 hrs)\nNagaenthran a\/l K Dharmalingam v AG[2022] SGCA 44\n10(b) For CM 30, a costs order of $5,000 is appropriate.

Raj was expected to be driving a Mitsubishi car bearing registration number SFW 3916X (the \u201cMitsubishi\u201d).', '8\\u2003At around 12.30pm on 21 September 2015, Ramadass drove the Lorry into Singapore through the Woodlands Checkpoint. The Lorry was owned by Ramadass\u2019s employer, and it was used to deliver bricks from Johor Bahru to customers in Singapore. At around 1pm, the Lorry turned into 10 Senoko Loop, where its cargo of bricks was unloaded. The Lorry then left 10 Senoko Loop at around 1.15pm and was observed by CNB officers following a route around Senoko Loop and Senoko Drive, stopping intermittently along the road. This lasted for around half an hour.', '9\\u2003At around 1.45 pm, Raj was spotted by Station Inspector Tay Cher Yeen (\u201cSI Jason\u201d) using the toilet at Min Lock Eating House (\u201cthe Canteen\u201d), which was located at 22 Senoko Loop. Raj was subsequently observed getting into the driver\u2019s seat of the Mitsubishi, while Noorul was in the passenger seat. The Mitsubishi left the carpark at around 1.50pm.', '10\\u2003At around this time, the Lorry drove onto Senoko Drive and parked some way ahead of an unmarked CNB vehicle. Ramadass was seen alighting from the Lorry and speaking to the drivers of two other cars that were parked behind the Lorry. Shortly after this, Raj drove the Mitsubishi to Senoko Drive and parked it behind the two other cars and the Lorry, just in front of the CNB vehicle. The two other cars drove off. Raj was observed making a gesture to Ramadass by Staff Sergeant Norizan binte Merabzul before driving off again. At around 2pm, Raj returned to the area and on this occasion, he parked the Mitsubishi in front of the Lorry. Ramadass then alighted from the Lorry, retrieved a red plastic bag from the passenger side of the Lorry and walked to the Mitsubishi. He opened its rear left passenger door and placed the red plastic bag inside. He then walked in between the Mitsubishi and the Lorry towards the driver\u2019s side of the Lorry. At around 2.03 pm, Raj drove off in the Mitsubishi, followed shortly by Ramadass in the Lorry.', '11\\u2003At around 2.18 pm, the Lorry was stopped at Woodlands Checkpoint and Ramadass was arrested. One of the arresting officers, Sergeant Meenambikhai Arul Molzi Thevar (\u201cSgt Meena\u201d), had a brief conversation with Ramadass, which was recorded in the field diary (\u201cRamadass\u2019s First Statement\u201d). The translated transcript of Ramadass\u2019s First Statement is set out here:', 'Sgt Meena testified that the Tamil word she had recorded Ramadass as using, could be transliterated as \u201cyellai\u201d. According to her, \u201cyellai\u201d was the Tamil word for \u201cleaf\u201d.', '12\\u2003At around 2.30pm, Sgt Meena served the Mandatory Death Penalty Notice (\u201cMDP Notice\u201d) on Ramadass in a CNB vehicle. It was not disputed that the MDP Notice was served on Ramadass before the Drugs were seized, and before any charges were served on him. She then recorded a second contemporaneous statement from Ramadass (\u201cRamadass\u2019s Second Statement\u201d) at around 2.50pm in the field diary. In Ramadass\u2019s Second Statement, Ramadass was recorded as having said that he had gone to Senoko to send \u201cjama\u201d, which meant drugs; that there were drugs inside the red plastic bag, and that the white \u201cbungkus\u201d, a Malay word meaning parcel, was packed with \u201cganja\u201d; that he threw the \u201cjama\u201d into the silver car (meaning the Mitsubishi) and recognised one of the male Indians in the car as he had passed him \u201cjama\u201d previously. He specifically identified the \u201cbaldie\u201d, who was the one who gave him hand signals from the car, and stated that he did not send \u201cjama\u201d to anyone else.', '13\\u2003At around 3.40pm, Ramadass was escorted to the Lorry by the CNB officers to conduct a search. The following items were found in the Lorry:', '(a)\\u2003from the flap above the driver\u2019s seat, one white \u201cStar Mart\u201d plastic bag containing a stack of $50 notes (later established to amount to $7,000); and', '(b)\\u2003from in between the driver\u2019s seat and the front passenger seat, one blue bag containing notes tied in a bundle using rubber bands (later established to amount to $4,300).', 'Two handphones were also seized from Ramadass and marked \u201cR-HP1\u201d and \u201cR-HP2\u201d respectively.', '14\\u2003At around 7.35pm, Sgt Meena recorded a third contemporaneous statement from Ramadass (\u201cRamadass\u2019s Third Statement\u201d) while they were in a CNB vehicle. In Ramadass\u2019s Third Statement, Ramadass was recorded as having said that he had brought \u201cdrugs into Singapore\u201d in the Lorry. Ramadass was not sure who put the drugs there, but was told the night before by someone known to him as \u201cMuruga\u201d that the Drugs were placed under the rear passenger seat, and that Muruga would call him to tell him who to deliver the drugs to.', '15\\u2003Three subsequent statements were recorded from Ramadass during the course of investigations. In Ramadass\u2019s cautioned statement (\u201cRamadass\u2019s Fourth Statement\u201d) recorded on 22 September 2015 at around 4.16pm, he denied knowledge of the nature of the Drugs, and stated that Muruga had placed the Drugs in the Lorry without his knowledge. In Ramadass\u2019s fifth statement recorded on 24 September 2015 by Inspector Teh Chee Sim Karlson (\u201cInsp Karlson\u201d) (\u201cRamadass\u2019s Fifth Statement\u201d), Ramadass gave an account of how the items came to be placed in the Lorry. He also said that he had been told by Muruga that the substance placed in the Lorry was \u201cchemically sprayed tobacco\u201d. In Ramadass\u2019s sixth statement recorded on 26 September 2015 by Insp Karlson (\u201cRamadass\u2019s Sixth Statement\u201d), Ramadass stated that he did not know what \u201cganja\u201d was and had never seen \u201cganja\u201d before. He also sought to clarify some of the responses recorded by Sgt Meena in Ramadass\u2019s First and Second Statements. In particular, he sought to explain that the words \u201cjama\u201d and \u201cganja\u201d recorded in Ramadass\u2019s Second Statement actually meant \u201cthing\u201d and \u201cchemical[ly] sprayed tobacco\u201d respectively, and that he had repeated what Sgt Meena had told him.', '16\\u2003After Raj left Senoko Drive in the Mitsubishi, he drove to Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1 and turned into a petrol station at 793 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1. Raj and Noorul alighted from the Mitsubishi and were arrested by CNB officers at around 2.30pm. At around 2.47pm, the Mitsubishi was searched. The items that were recovered included the following:', '(a)\\u2003from the floor between the front seats, one plastic bag (later marked \u201cB1\u201d) containing (i) miscellaneous items; and (ii) one colourful pouch (\u201cB1B\u201d) containing one red plastic bag (\u201cB1B1\u201d), which contained a plastic packet (\u201cB1B1A\u201d), and which in turn contained three packets (\u201cB1B1A1\u201d). The said three packets each contained vegetable matter described by Raj as \u201cButterfly\u201d. We elaborate on this below;', '(b)\\u2003from the rear passenger seat, one red plastic bag (later marked \u201cC1\u201d), containing five rectangular blocks, each wrapped in red-and-white \u201cSky Net\u201d packaging (\u201cC1A\u201d, \u201cC1B\u201d, \u201cC1C\u201d, \u201cC1D\u201d and \u201cC1E\u201d respectively), under which was another layer of plastic followed by gold-coloured paper, and each of which contained a block of vegetable matter (\u201cC1A1A1\u201d, \u201cC1B1A1\u201d, \u201cC1C1A1\u201d, \u201cC1D1A1\u201d and \u201cC1E1A1\u201d respectively).', 'Some of the CNB officers present later testified that they detected a smell of cannabis, and that one of the blocks wrapped in the \u201cSky Net\u201d packaging was found with a hole in the wrapping, through which vegetable matter could be seen.', '17\\u2003A total of five statements were taken from Raj by various CNB officers. In all five statements, Raj gave the same response, to the effect that he was \u201cnot being uncooperative, but [he] would like to consult [his] lawyer to seek legal advise [sic] before [giving his statement]\u201d.', '18\\u2003A total of seven statements were also recorded from Noorul. However, as the Prosecution did not proceed against Noorul on a capital charge, he was neither called to testify at the trial nor were his statements disclosed. Following this court\u2019s decision in Muhammad Nabill bin Mohd Fuad v Public Prosecutor [2020] 1 SLR 984 on the Prosecution\u2019s disclosure obligations, Noorul\u2019s statements were disclosed to both Raj and Ramadass on 23 December 2020. This was after the Judgment had already been released. Prior to the hearing of these appeals, both Raj and Ramadass confirmed that they would neither be relying on Noorul\u2019s statements, nor would they be making applications to call Noorul as a witness.'"}

We will therefore only highlight the salient facts pertinent to the appeal.', '7\\u2003The appellant and the respondents are siblings. Through his eldest son and litigation representative Lee Kai Teck Roland (\u201cRoland\u201d), the appellant sued his eldest sister Lee Gin Hong (\u201cthe first respondent\u201d) and youngest sister Lee Gim Moi (\u201cthe second respondent\u201d) to recover half of the Partnership\u2019s liability under an overdraft facility. The respondents are sued personally as well as in their capacities as the executors of the estate of their late mother Ng Ang Chum (\u201cthe late mother\u201d) who passed away in December 2014.', '8\\u2003The appellant was incapacitated by a severe stroke in July 2014 and Roland became his litigation representative in February 2016. Shortly before the appeal was scheduled to be heard in March 2021, the appellant passed away. The appeal was adjourned, and an application was later made (and granted) at the hearing to change the appellant\u2019s name to reflect his wife as the administratrix and trustee of his estate.', '9\\u2003The Partnership first commenced business as a sole proprietorship by the appellant\u2019s late father in 1958. The Partnership was a retailer of motorcycles, motor scooters, spare parts and accessories. It also operated a workshop. The appellant subsequently joined the business as a partner in 1975. After his father\u2019s death in 1981, the appellant\u2019s late mother was registered as a partner.', '10\\u2003The respondents started working for the Partnership in the 1980s as administration clerks until they resigned in August 2016. They lived with their late mother at No 75 Chua Chu Kang Road (\u201c75 CCK\u201d) for over 30 years until her passing. The respondents\u2019 late mother bequeathed 75 CCK to them in her will.', '11\\u2003In or around 1994, the appellant decided to set up LH Motor Pte Ltd (\u201cLHMPL\u201d), in which he held 70% of the shares while his late mother and the respondents held 10% of the shares each. The Partnership\u2019s business in the sale and purchase of new motorcycles was then moved to LHMPL. The appellant used the Partnership\u2019s moneys for the initial capital investment in LHMPL and when LHMPL made sales, the money was either collected directly by the Partnership, or repaid by LHMPL to the Partnership.', '12\\u2003The parties disputed the details of how the Partnership was managed. According to the respondents, their late mother was illiterate, and the business of the Partnership was conducted and managed by the appellant. Their late mother had no say in the management or running of the business, and apart from performing simple tasks such as sweeping the floor, cooking and making beverages, she took no part in the Partnership\u2019s business. The appellant also did not share the profits of the Partnership and only gave his late mother a monthly allowance of about $1,000. After the appellant was incapacitated, his second son Lee Kai Leong Jeffrey (\u201cJeffrey\u201d) managed the Partnership.', '13\\u2003The appellant did not admit that his late mother was illiterate. Instead, his position was that she was a savvy businesswoman who was smart and well versed with every aspect of the Partnership, of which she was a cheque signatory. She would handle the cashier\u2019s machine, collect payments from customers and gave them change as well as make payment to vendors. The appellant\u2019s late mother took part in the management of the Partnership and the appellant therefore did not manage the Partnership solely. In fact, after the appellant\u2019s incapacitation in July 2014, his late mother retained control of the Partnership while the respondents, from whom Jeffrey took instructions, ran the entire business.', '14\\u2003After the appellant\u2019s mother passed away, the appellant, through Roland sued the respondents for half of the liability due and owing under an overdraft facility of $1.5m extended to the Partnership by United Overseas Bank (\u201cthe UOB overdraft facility\u201d) in 2018. The respondents counterclaimed against the appellant, alleging that he withdrew moneys from the UOB overdraft facility and other bank accounts of the Partnership for, inter alia, his own real estate purchases and for investments in businesses unrelated to the Partnership. They also contended that the appellant was liable to account for private profits he withdrew from the Partnership. The parties\u2019 respective cases will be set out in greater detail below.', '15\\u2003The respondents, as part of their counterclaim, alleged that the appellant had withdrawn the following sums for his personal use:', '16\\u2003The above sums are the aggregate of various transactions detailed in Annexures A and B to the Defence and Counterclaim, as well as various withdrawals by the appellant detailed in Appendix 21 of the report of the appellant\u2019s expert, Tee Wey Lih (\u201cTee\u201d and \u201cTee\u2019s report\u201d).', '17\\u2003It was not disputed that the appellant withdrew moneys from the Partnership for purposes unrelated to the Partnership. The appellant\u2019s response to the counterclaim was essentially that the withdrawals were approved by his late mother and\/or he had deposited more moneys into the Partnership\u2019s accounts than he had withdrawn. His expert, Tee, accepted the accuracy of the items listed in Annexures A and B. However, his position was that withdrawals prior to 2002 need not be taken into account.

However, it is difficult to see how this is in any way a mitigating circumstance. What matters in the present case is that ORC 3219 was persistently breached. The appellant did not avail himself of the numerous opportunities available to him to come clean. Further, as the Judge found, the contempt was deliberate and has not been purged (see the Judgment at [40] and [42]).', '21\\u2003Third, he states that he had not missed any court hearings in respect of ORC 3219 and that he had always appeared in court when required, whether by himself or through counsel. Court attendance is an obligation, and the fact that a litigant shows up in court should not in any way discount the severity of any other disobedience of the court\u2019s orders on his part.', '22\\u2003Fourth, the appellant states that he was not legally represented at the time he prepared the July 2020 and August 2020 affidavits. The respondent argues that this is untrue, in so far as the July 2020 affidavit is concerned: the appellant\u2019s legal team only discharged itself on 12 August 2020. Nonetheless, even if the appellant had indeed ceased consulting his legal team even for the July 2020 affidavit, we do not see how this would be relevant. This was not a case of a confused and inexperienced litigant failing to comprehend a complicated court order, resulting in inadvertent disobedience. Rather, as the Judge found, the appellant had deliberately lied in the face of a direct order of court (see the Judgment at [42]).', '23\\u2003Fifth, the appellant suggests that the delay in his response to the respondent was due to delays on the bank\u2019s end in relaying information on the Account to him. However, as the respondent rightly points out, the issue at the heart of the appellant\u2019s contempt was his failure to disclose all the information available to him at the earliest possible time.

{"casename":"2022_SGCA_5","fact":"'3\\u2003In the Judgment, we assessed the value of the disclosed assets of the parties, for which we could determine a value of $13,667,860.72 (see the Judgment at [94]). We initially apportioned the assets 85:15 in the Husband\u2019s favour. We adjusted this ratio in the light of an adverse inference which we drew against him for failing to provide full and frank disclosure of his assets and further valuation in some instances. The adjustment resulted in a final ratio of 75:25 in favour of the Husband, ie, an increase for the Wife from 15% to 25%.', '4\\u2003The Wife\u2019s share meant that she was entitled to 25% of $13,667,860.72, ie, $3,416,965.18. As the value of the assets held in her sole name amounted to $1,123,657.45, we ordered the Husband to pay her the balance, ie, $2,293,307.73 within six months from the date of the Judgment. He was allowed to set-off against this sum, $20,000 which we awarded to him as legal costs of his appeal and two interlocutory applications. We ordered that he pay the net balance (\u201cthe Balance Sum\u201d) to her with interest at 3% per annum from 1 December 2018 until the date on which full payment is made.', '5\\u2003We also ordered each party to remove caveats they lodged against any property owned by the other within 14 days from the date of the Judgment, except for the one on a property which we referred to as the Lorong Pisang Raja property. The Wife was ordered to remove the caveat on that property within 14 days after receipt of the Balance Sum and interest.', '6\\u2003In the Application, the Husband seeks the following primary reliefs:', '(a)\\u2003That the sale proceeds of a property referred to as the Eng Kong Place property be used to satisfy the Balance Sum.', '(b)\\u2003That the amount he is to pay the Wife be reduced to take into account an alleged loss of $1.1m arising from the sale of the Eng Kong Place property.', '(c)\\u2003That he be permitted to set-off a sum of $14,399.40 being alleged outstanding legal costs said to be owing by the Wife to him against any sums he is to pay her.', '(d)\\u2003Waiver of interest that he was ordered to pay on the Balance Sum.', '(e)\\u2003That the Wife be ordered to transfer shares she holds in two private and family companies to him at an agreed consideration.', '(f)\\u2003That the Wife be ordered to transfer to him her interest in a property which we referred to as Liang Feng Mansion, Shanghai, China.', '(g)\\u2003That the award to the Wife of 25% of the matrimonial assets be reduced to 15% by rescinding the 10% award to her arising from the adverse inference drawn against the Husband.', '(h)\\u2003That the Wife is to remove the caveat on the Lorong Pisang Raja property within 14 days after receipt of the full Balance Sum.', '7\\u2003The last relief for the removal of the caveat on the Lorong Pisang Raja property is unnecessary because it was already part of the orders we had made in the Judgment.

{"casename":"2022_SGCA_50","fact":"'3\\u2003The appellant, Chong Hoon Cheong, claimed trial to a capital charge (the \u201cCharge\u201d) of having in his possession for the purpose of trafficking 27 packets containing granular\/powdery substances (weighing a total of 848.69g), which was analysed and found to contain a total of 25.01g of diamorphine (the \u201cDrugs\u201d), an offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the MDA. The Drugs contained in the 27 packets, that were exhibited in Exhibits \u201cA1A\u201d, \u201cA2\u201d, \u201cA4A\u201d and \u201cD1A2\u201d were recovered from the appellant\u2019s rented room at Room 7 of 26B Hamilton Road, Singapore (\u201cRoom 7\u201d). Under the Second Schedule to the MDA, the mandatory punishment for trafficking more than 15g of diamorphine is death.', '4\\u2003It is trite that three elements must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt to make out an offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the MDA (Muhammad Ridzuan bin Md Ali v Public Prosecutor and other matters [2014] 3 SLR 721 at [59]; Zainal bin Hamad v Public Prosecutor and another appeal [2018] 2 SLR 1119 at [49]):', '(a)\\u2003possession of a controlled drug (\u201cPossession Element\u201d) \u2013 which may be proved or presumed under s 18(1) of the MDA, or deemed under s 18(4) of the MDA;', '(b)\\u2003knowledge of the nature of the drug (\u201cKnowledge Element\u201d) \u2013 which may be proved or presumed under s 18(2) of the MDA; and', '(c)\\u2003such possession of the drug was for the purpose of trafficking which was not authorised (\u201cPurpose Element\u201d) \u2013 which must be proved if either or both of the Possession and Knowledge Elements have been presumed, or which may otherwise be presumed under s 17 of the MDA if both the Purpose and Knowledge Elements are proved.', '5\\u2003At the trial below, the Possession and Knowledge Elements of the Charge were not in dispute and were therefore proved beyond a reasonable doubt. This meant that the respondent could have relied on the statutory presumption under s 17 to establish the Purpose Element, which the appellant challenged in part in that he denied that all of the Drugs had been in his possession for the purposes of trafficking. Instead, the appellant alleged that he had in his possession Exhibit D1A2, which contained 14.08g of diamorphine (also known as \u201cheroin\u201d in English, \u201cBai Fen\u201d in Mandarin and \u201cPei Hoon\u201d in Hokkien), for the purpose of his personal consumption (the \u201cConsumption Defence\u201d). The significance of the appellant\u2019s Consumption Defence, if it is made out, is that only the remaining 10.93g of diamorphine would have been in his possession for the purpose of trafficking \u2013 which would be well under the statutory threshold of 15g for the imposition of the mandatory death penalty.', '6\\u2003At the trial below, the respondent ran two cases. The respondent\u2019s primary case was that the evidence proved, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the appellant possessed the drugs in Exhibit D1A2 for the purpose of trafficking. In support of its primary case, the respondent relied only on the appellant\u2019s statements to submit that he had essentially admitted that Exhibit D1A2 was meant for repacking and delivery in his statements. In the alternative, the respondent ran a secondary case that the appellant was presumed to have possessed not less than 25.01g of diamorphine for the purposes of trafficking under s 17(c) of the MDA.', '7\\u2003The High Court judge (the \u201cJudge\u201d) who tried the matter rejected the respondent\u2019s primary case, disagreeing with the respondent that the appellant\u2019s statements could sustain the weight of his conviction. The Judge held that two factors \u2013 the possibility of the appellant having experienced drug intoxication when making his first statement together with a reasonable doubt as to the proper interpretation of the appellant\u2019s statements \u2013 combined to raise a reasonable doubt as to the appellant\u2019s guilt: Public Prosecutor v Chong Hoon Cheong [2021] SGHC 211 (the \u201cJudgment\u201d) at [74]. On that basis, the Judge concluded that the appellant had successfully discharged his burden by raising a reasonable doubt within the respondent\u2019s primary case. But stated thus, it can be argued \u2013 as the appellant argues before us at the appeal \u2013 that the Judge erred in then convicting (and consequently sentencing) the appellant on the respondent\u2019s secondary case. If the appellant had successfully raised a reasonable doubt, he contends that he should then have been acquitted instead.', '8\\u2003As it turned out, because of the way the respondent ran its case at trial, the Judge was constrained to consider whether the respondent succeeded on its secondary case. The Judge noted that the respondent \u201cmust therefore rely on the presumption under s 17(c) of the MDA\u201d to succeed in proving the Charge against the appellant (Judgment at [74]). The appellant sought to rebut the statutory presumption by relying on his Consumption Defence. This did not turn on the contents or interpretation of his statements. The Judge, after a meticulous review of the evidence in respect of the appellant\u2019s allegations, found that the appellant failed to establish his Consumption Defence (Judgment at [192]). The statutory presumption under s 17(c) of the MDA thus remained unrebutted and the respondent succeeded in proving the appellant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.', '9\\u2003On 8 December 2015, officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (\u201cCNB\u201d) positioned themselves at about 4.10pm in the vicinity of 26B Hamilton Road acting on information pertaining to drug-related activities. At about 6.50pm, a 47-year-old Malaysian national, Eng Kok Seng (\u201cMr Eng\u201d) entered the door leading to 26B Hamilton Road and left at about 7.25pm. The CNB officers arrested Mr Eng at a traffic junction at about 7.35pm. The appellant knows Mr Eng as \u201cHeng Dai\u201d.', '10\\u2003The appellant too was arrested on 8 December 2015 at 7.35pm at 26B Hamilton Road. On that day, the appellant had consumed both diamorphine and methamphetamine (also known as \u201cice\u201d), prior to the arrest. Upon a search by CNB officers, the following packets of granular\/powdery substance were retrieved from Room 7 which were analysed and found to contain diamorphine:', '11\\u2003In the course of investigations, seven statements were recorded from the appellant between 8 and 16 December 2015:', '(a)\\u2003On the day of the arrest, Inspector Eng Chien Loong Eugene (\u201cInsp Eng\u201d) recorded the appellant\u2019s two contemporaneous statements pursuant to s 22 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (\u201cCPC\u201d) at 9.30pm (the \u201cFirst Contemporaneous Statement\u201d) and at 11.20pm respectively (and referred to collectively as the \u201cContemporaneous Statements\u201d). The appellant made these Contemporaneous Statements in Hokkien, which was translated into English by Insp Eng upon recording, at Room 7.', '(b)\\u2003The following day, on 9 December 2015 at 5.23pm, Insp Desmond Liang Duanting (\u201cInsp Liang\u201d) recorded a cautioned statement pursuant to s 23 of the CPC (the \u201cCautioned Statement\u201d). The appellant spoke in Mandarin and this was translated by the interpreter, Mr Wong Png Leong (\u201cMr Wong\u201d).', '(c)\\u2003Inspector Liang subsequently recorded four long statements pursuant to s 22 of the CPC (the \u201cLong Statements\u201d). On 15 December 2015, Insp Liang recorded two long statements from the appellant at 10.54am (the \u201cFirst Long Statement\u201d) and at 3.10pm (the \u201cSecond Long Statement\u201d) respectively. On 16 December 2015, Insp Liang recorded two further long statements from the appellant at 11.34am (the \u201cThird Long Statement\u201d) and at 4.16pm (the \u201cFourth Long Statement\u201d) respectively. For all the Long Statements, the appellant spoke in Mandarin and these were translated by Mr Wong. Photos were shown to the appellant and appended to the Long Statements, including photos of Exhibits \u201cA1A\u201d, \u201cA2\u201d, \u201cA4A\u201d and \u201cD1A2\u201d.', '12\\u2003According to the appellant, he agreed to work for a Malaysian known to him as \u201cAh Kiat\u201d in or around October 2015. The work involved the appellant collecting diamorphine, repacking it and then waiting for \u201cpeople to come and collect them\u201d. This work arrangement is not disputed by the parties.', '13\\u2003The trial took place over several tranches between 13 August 2019 and 2 March 2021. The respondent adduced the evidence of the relevant persons involved in the investigations. At the close of its case, the Judge found that there was a case to answer and called upon the appellant to enter his defence. Apart from relying on his own testimony, the appellant also called four other witnesses:', '14\\u2003The appellant made no mention of the Consumption Defence in the Cautioned Statement. The appellant\u2019s Consumption Defence was instead first noted expressly in a medical report dated 15 July 2019 prepared by Dr Julia Lam (\u201cDr Lam\u201d and \u201cDr Lam\u2019s Medical Report\u201d respectively). Dr Lam\u2019s Medical Report also records the appellant saying that he consumed four to five straws or up to a gross weight of 8g of heroin per day. However, Dr Lam was not called as a witness and her report was not formally admitted into evidence, although it is in the parties\u2019 Agreed Bundle (Judgment at [135] and [140]).', '15\\u2003Relatedly, it bears emphasising that the appellant reported an ever-increasing rate of consumption from the time of his arrest to the trial (Judgment at [139] and [141]\u2013[143]):', '(a)\\u2003In December 2015, the appellant stated in the First and Third Long Statements that he consumed about half a packet of heroin (or, about 4g of heroin) each day. A full packet contains 7.8\u20138g of heroin.', '(b)\\u2003In 2015, after the Long Statements were recorded, the appellant was examined by Dr Kenneth Koh (\u201cDr Koh\u201d) on 24, 28 and 31 December 2015. Dr Koh\u2019s medical report dated 5 January 2016 (\u201cDr Koh\u2019s Medical Report\u201d) records the appellant as claiming to have taken about 5 to 6g of heroin a day. The appellant, however, contended that Dr Koh inaccurately recorded the appellant\u2019s consumption rate (as 5 to 6g of heroin per day instead of per consumption) due to a miscommunication potentially arising from the appellant\u2019s lack of proficiency in speaking and understanding Mandarin.', '(c)\\u2003Dr Winslow first examined the appellant on 2 December 2019. Dr Winslow\u2019s medical report dated 31 January 2020 (\u201cDr Winslow\u2019s Medical Report\u201d) records that at the \u201cheight of his addiction in 2015, prior to his arrest for the index offences,\u201d the appellant stated that he would \u201cconsume about two packs, which approximated five to six long straws (with each straw containing about five to six grams) of heroin \u2026 per day\u201d.', '(d)\\u2003During his evidence-in-chief in March 2020, the appellant testified that at the time of his arrest, he consumed 16\u201320g of heroin per day, or about two packets of 7.8\u20138g each. During his cross-examination in November 2020, he claimed his consumption rate was at least 20g but less than 25g of heroin per day.', '16\\u2003On 13 September 2021, the Judge delivered his decision and convicted the appellant of the Charge.

Charges D7A and D9 correspond to charges C5A and C6.', '12\\u2003All the foregoing offences were committed in Azlin and Ridzuan\u2019s home. We shall refer to the charges against Azlin and Ridzuan, besides the Murder Charges, collectively as the \u201cAbuse Charges\u201d. It is undisputed that, prior to the offences, the Deceased had lived with a friend of Azlin\u2019s, [Z], since March 2011, when the Deceased was an infant.', '13\\u2003The Abuse Charges occurred from July 2016 until the time covered by the Murder Charges between 15 and 22 October 2016. The Judge acquitted Azlin and Ridzuan of charges C4 and D4. The Judge convicted Azlin and Ridzuan of the remaining Abuse Charges. The convictions, sentences, and acquittals of the Abuse Charges are not in issue in these appeals.', '14\\u2003As for the Murder Charges, the roles played by Azlin and Ridzuan in the four scalding incidents were largely not disputed (see GD at [61]). As both parties elected to remain silent and not give evidence in court, the primary source of evidence for the scalding incidents was what they disclosed in their respective investigative statements. The sequence of events involving the Abuse and Murder Charges unfolded as follows.', '15\\u2003The abusive acts began in July 2016. Ridzuan first used pliers to hurt the Deceased twice in July 2016 (charges D2 and D3). This was followed in August 2016 by Azlin hitting the Deceased with a broomstick so hard that he was limping thereafter (charge C2). Later that same month, Azlin pushed the Deceased so hard that he fell, hitting his head on the edge of a pillar. As a result, he bled from the head (charge C3).', '16\\u2003In October 2016, Ridzuan used a heated spoon on the Deceased\u2019s palm (charge D5), flicked ash from a lighted cigarette on him, and hit him with a hanger (charge D6).', '17\\u2003Incident 1 was committed by Azlin alone and occurred sometime between 15 and 17 October 2016. It was around noon when Azlin was in the kitchen and noticed that their milk powder had dwindled in quantity. Azlin then called the Deceased to the kitchen. Right after the Deceased arrived in the kitchen, Azlin grabbed him by his right ankle. While still holding onto him, Azlin filled a glass mug to around one-quarter full with hot water from the water dispenser and poured it onto his right leg. The Deceased started crying and Azlin repeated this two or three times before letting go of the Deceased. The Deceased then ran into the toilet, and Azlin questioned him over her suspicion that he had consumed some milk powder but he denied this. Azlin then took hold of him, refilled the mug with hot water and poured it on the Deceased\u2019s hand four or five more times. When the Deceased got free of Azlin\u2019s grip, she refilled the mug and splashed it over his left arm, and some also splashed onto his chest. She stopped when Ridzuan woke up and shouted for them to keep quiet.', '18\\u2003Following that incident, Azlin saw that the Deceased was limping and that skin was peeling from his hands, arms and chest. The Deceased also told Azlin that he was in pain. She purchased some cream for the skin injuries, and thought the Deceased was walking normally by the next day. Ridzuan, on the other hand, claimed that he did not observe any peeling skin, but that the Deceased\u2019s skin was \u201creddish\u201d, and that the Deceased was able to \u201cwalk normally and run and play with his brother.\u201d', '19\\u2003Incident 2 was committed by Azlin and Ridzuan jointly. Sometime between 17 and 19 October 2016, Azlin splashed the Deceased\u2019s body with hot water. Azlin stated in her investigative statement that she could not remember why she did so. In response, the Deceased shouted, \u201cKau gila ke apa\u201d (translated by Azlin in her statement as \u201cAre you crazy or what\u201d). Azlin became angry and re-filled the glass mug with hot water and splashed the Deceased on his face. She then re-filled the glass mug and splashed the Deceased at least five and up to seven times, on his face, body, arms, and legs. Ridzuan also participated in this incident. When he heard the Deceased shout at Azlin, Ridzuan picked up a green mug and splashed hot water at the Deceased, and it landed on the Deceased\u2019s face and body. On Ridzuan\u2019s account, there was more splashing of the Deceased with hot water after the Deceased had bathed, but, according to Azlin, at some point, Ridzuan told Azlin \u201cto stop and cool down\u201d.', '20\\u2003After Incident 2, both Azlin and Ridzuan noticed that the Deceased suffered significant injuries. This included white patches of raw skin that appeared on his face and chin, on his stomach and body, and on his left shoulder; pus was oozing from his forehead, and from his back and left shoulder; and skin was peeling from his back, face, hands, thighs and legs. Azlin also said she \u201ccould see the whitish flesh\u201d [emphasis added] below the outer skin surface. The Deceased also became noticeably \u201cweak\u201d after Incident 2, and was \u201cnot able to move [as] usual\u201d, needing assistance from his brother even to get food to eat.', '21\\u2003In another incident, seemingly after Incident 2, Azlin pushed the Deceased, causing him to hit his head against the wall, and Ridzuan punched the Deceased on the face so hard that his nasal bone was fractured (charges C5A and D7A). Although this happened during the fateful week in question, the Prosecution does not rely on this incident in connection with the alternative s 300(c) charge.', '22\\u2003Incident 3 was committed by Azlin alone. On 21 October 2016 at about 9pm, Azlin became angry with the Deceased when he kept asking for a drink. Azlin splashed the Deceased with a glass mug filled with hot water. In all, she splashed water at the Deceased nine or ten times, though on some of these attempts, she missed the Deceased. Azlin subsequently went to sleep.', '23\\u2003On 21 and 22 October 2016, the respondents locked the Deceased in a cat cage (charges C6 and D9). He was only let out of the cage to be fed. The cat cage measured 0.91m in length, 0.58m in width, and 0.70m in height, while the Deceased was 1.05m tall at the material time. The cat cage was made of metallic bars, and Dr Chan Shijia, who performed the autopsy on 24 October 2016, testified that it was possible that the lacerations on the Deceased\u2019s face and scalp might have been a result of being confined in the cage and being scratched by the sharper metallic parts when the Deceased tried to move in the cage (see GD at [49]). Based on the photograph of the cat cage, it does not appear that there was any mattress or soft padding in the cat cage. The Deceased was in the cage from around 7pm until about 10pm on 21 October 2016, and from around 4am until about noon on 22 October 2016. By this time, the Deceased was clearly unwell, with a fever and with skin peeling off his face, hands, back, thighs and the back of his legs (see GD at [48] to [49]). Again, this incident is not relied on by the Prosecution in connection with the alternative s 300(c) charge.', '24\\u2003Incident 4 was committed by Azlin and Ridzuan jointly on 22 October 2016. Azlin instructed the Deceased to bathe, but he had not removed his shorts when he came to the kitchen. Azlin got upset and woke Ridzuan up and, as the Judge had found, told him to deal with the Deceased (GD at [128]). She then started bathing her two daughters. Ridzuan asked the Deceased to remove his shorts and when he refused, Ridzuan used the handle of a broom to beat the Deceased two or three times on his legs. Both Azlin and Ridzuan again asked the Deceased to remove his shorts. Ridzuan then filled half a glass mug with hot water from the dispenser and threw the hot water on the floor beside the Deceased as a warning. Some of the water touched the Deceased\u2019s leg. The situation escalated with more scolding before Ridzuan refilled the mug with hot water and splashed the Deceased on the left side of his body. When the Deceased again refused to remove his shorts, Ridzuan refilled half the mug with hot water yet again and poured this on the Deceased\u2019s back. Ridzuan then refilled the mug a fourth time and splashed hot water on one or both of the Deceased\u2019s calves. The Prosecution\u2019s case was that Azlin was present throughout the incident. Ridzuan\u2019s account in his investigative statement is that Azlin was \u201cshouting\u201d at the Deceased and was \u201cbeside\u201d Ridzuan during this incident. Azlin on the other hand asserted that she was busy with her daughters. The Judge found that, while Azlin was not beside Ridzuan throughout this incident, her investigative statement made it clear that she saw and acquiesced in Ridzuan\u2019s actions, including his repeatedly splashing the Deceased with hot water (GD at [67]). The Deceased finally fell and lay on his side. Ridzuan then summoned Azlin and together they rinsed the Deceased with cold water.', '25\\u2003After the Deceased collapsed, Ridzuan carried him into the bedroom and laid him on the floor. The skin on the Deceased\u2019s face, trunk, arms and legs was peeling badly, and some areas had turned white. His eyes were open, but he was weak and, according to Azlin, was unable to move. The Deceased also complained that he felt cold. Seeing the Deceased in this state, both Azlin and Ridzuan became \u201cvery scared\u201d, as stated in Ridzuan\u2019s investigative statement. Ridzuan contemplated sending the Deceased to the hospital, but did not want to call the ambulance because he was afraid the police would come as well. Azlin suggested that they wait to see if the Deceased\u2019s condition would improve.', '26\\u2003At around 6pm that evening, Azlin and Ridzuan left the Deceased alone in the flat. Accompanied by their other children, they went to fetch Ridzuan\u2019s aunt, Kasmah binte Latiff (\u201cKasmah\u201d), from her home. Prior to going to Kasmah\u2019s house to seek help, Ridzuan told Azlin to lie about the injuries and to say that the Deceased had accidentally pulled the electrical cord of the kettle and the water had splashed on him as a result. They then returned to the flat, and brought the Deceased to KK Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Hospital (\u201cKKWCH\u201d). The Deceased was admitted to the emergency department on the same day (22 October 2016) at around 7.57pm. At the emergency room, Ridzuan told the nursing staff that he was disciplining the Deceased when the Deceased accidentally pulled on the kettle, splashing hot water on himself. Ridzuan repeated this story to the police officers who first spoke with him.', '27\\u2003The Deceased received emergency intensive care, but was pronounced dead on 23 October 2016 at 9.13am. The extent of the Deceased\u2019s total body surface area (\u201cTBSA\u201d) covered by burns was estimated by Dr Gavin Kang Chun-Wui, the burn specialist who performed debridement to clean the Deceased\u2019s wounds on the evening of 22 October 2016, at 67%, and by Dr Chan Shijia, who performed the autopsy on 24 October 2016, at 75% after debridement; this consisted of mid and deep dermal burns (see GD at [72]) and included sensitive parts of the Deceased\u2019s body, including his face and genital area.'"}
{"casename":"2022_SGCA_53","fact":"the facts in Abdul Kahar at some length to \nemphasise how fact-specific our decision in that case to not order personal costs \nagainst counsel had been. Although counsel\u2019s belief in the merits of a \nconstitutional challenge to s 33B of the MDA had been misplaced, we were \npersuaded, given the circumstances in which he came to represent the applicant \nin the application, that he had acted in good faith. \n13 In this case, a mere good faith belief by Mr Chen in the merits of CM 3 \ndoes not assist him because quite clearly, that belief had been held without \nreasonable basis. The circumstances of this case also do not lend the impression \nthat Mr Chen had acted in good faith. This is because CM 3 had not merely been \nunmeritorious; it was entirely without basis and so Mr Chen must have known \nthat it was nothing but a waste of the court\u2019s time. As explained in the Judgment, \nnone of the materials for which disclosure had been sought was in the possession \nof the respondent, a position which Mr Chen must have been aware of (see the \nJudgment at [13]\u2012[14]). We were also left with no option except to dismiss the \napplication for leave to adduce further evidence because the alleged further \nVersion No 1: 15 Jul 2022 (15:41 hrs)\nGaiyathiri d\/o Murugayan v PP[2022] SGCA 53 \n8report by Dr Rajesh had not even been put before us (see the Judgment at [21]). \nWe are therefore not persuaded that Mr Chen had acted in good faith in \nfacilitating the filing of CM 3. \n14 Finally, we address two other points which Mr Chen has urged us to \nconsider in his subsequent correspondence to the court. First, he says that he \nhad been helping the applicant \u201cfrom a humanitarian perspective\u201d and \u201cfrom \n[the applicant\u2019s] children\u2019s point of view\u201d because a custodial sentence of \n30 years imposed on the applicant means that she could not be with them during \ntheir formative years. We do not see how this has any bearing on our decision \nto impose a personal costs order against Mr Chen. Whatever reasons counsel \nmight have for taking on their client\u2019s case, it does not excuse them from their \nduty as officers of the court to assess the merits of their client\u2019s case before \ninvoking the court\u2019s processes (see the decision of this court in Miya Manik v \nPublic Prosecutor and another matter [2021] 2 SLR 1169 at [87]). Indeed, if \nMr Chen truly took up his appointment in order to help the applicant \u201cfrom a \nhumanitarian perspective\u201d, then he should, all the more, have properly advised \nthe applicant on the merits of CM 3 and ensure that the reliefs therein had been \nproperly sought and that all relevant materials like the alleged further report had \nbeen put before the court for the hearing of CM 3; quite clearly, Mr Chen has \nnot done any of that. \n15 Second, Mr Chen raises a somewhat cryptic point that \u201cthe applicant \ncannot afford to pay the costs\u201d. If what Mr Chen meant by this is that a personal \ncosts order should not be made because of the applicant\u2019s impecuniosity, then \nwe have no hesitation to reject this point, because the costs order is made against \nMr Chen personally and not the applicant. If what Mr Chen meant by this is that \nhe only came to represent the applicant because of her impecuniosity, we do not \nsee that it has much bearing on our decision to impose a personal costs order. \nVersion No 1: 15 Jul 2022 (15:41 hrs)\nGaiyathiri d\/o Murugayan v PP[2022] SGCA 53 \n9Even if Mr Chen came to represent the applicant out of goodwill, it does not \nexcuse him from his duty as an officer of the court to consider the merits of the \napplicant\u2019s case before invoking the court\u2019s processes. It is one thing if counsel \nhad considered the merits of his client\u2019s case and erred in his assessment (for \nexample, like in Abdul Kahar ([ 11] above)) but quite another if counsel simply \ngave no such consideration to the case concerned at all (as appears to have been \nthe case here).\n16 For the foregoing reasons, we order Mr Chen to pay costs of $3,000 (all-\nin) to the respondent.

However, the Parent continued to retain ownership of the Site.', '8\\u2003In March 2014, the first appellant supplied the respondent with additional equipment worth F$49,000 and additional services worth approximately F$31,000. This equipment was subsequently used in or incorporated into the Plant. The appellants received no compensation from the respondent for providing these additional services and equipment.', '9\\u2003About two months later, in May 2014, the appellants and the respondent entered into a service agreement (\u201cService Agreement\u201d) whereunder the first appellant assigned to the second appellant the first appellant\u2019s obligation under the Contact to provide supervision and training services to the respondent.', '10\\u2003Unfortunately, there were delays in the construction of the Plant and the completed Plant never achieved its production target. The respondent purported to terminate the Contract. So, in August 2016, the appellants commenced an arbitration against the respondent. Some three weeks later, the respondent commenced its own arbitration against the appellants. In October 2016, the two arbitrations were consolidated into the Arbitration by consent. The claimants and respondent in the Arbitration were the appellants and the respondent, respectively. By November 2016, the Tribunal was constituted comprising Dr Michael Moser (President of the Tribunal), Prof Mauro Bussani and Mr Alan J Thambiayah.', '11\\u2003The Arbitration was commenced under both the Contract and the Service Agreement.

Article 6.2 of the Service Agreement incorporated Art 26 of the Contract.', '12\\u2003On 3 January 2017, in accordance with Art 23 of the ICC Rules, the parties and the Tribunal signed the terms of reference (\u201cTerms of Reference\u201d) setting out the parties\u2019 claims in the Arbitration.', '13\\u2003Based on the Terms of Reference, the reliefs sought by the appellants in the Arbitration included the following:', '14\\u2003The respondent, for its part, stated in the Terms of Reference that it was seeking the following reliefs:', '15\\u2003On 28 November 2019, the Tribunal issued the Award. The majority of the Tribunal found that the respondent had been induced to enter into the Contract by the appellants\u2019 misrepresentations, and that the respondent was therefore entitled to rescission of both the Contract and the Service Agreement. The Tribunal made various orders including the following:', '(a)\\u2003The appellants were to pay the respondent the contract price of F$92.7m, less F$15m (to account for two loans which the first appellant had previously extended to the respondent) and F$54.5m (to account for the respondent\u2019s use of the Plant after it had been completed and the diminution in value of the Plant) (the \u201cRepayment Order\u201d).', '(b)\\u2003The respondent was to \u201ctransfer the title to the Plant, including the additional equipment installed\u201d to the appellants in return for payment under the Repayment Order (the \u201cTransfer Order\u201d). In this connection, the Tribunal noted that \u201c[w]hile [the appellants] did not request the transfer of title to the Plant in their request for relief, such transfer of the title is the natural (i.e. legal) consequence of the rescission of the Contract, as specifically acknowledged by [the respondent] and not challenged by [the appellants]\u201d.', '(c)\\u2003The appellants were to pay the respondent sums denominated in Ruritanian currency totalling R$176,245,250 as damages under the Misrepresentation Act (Cap 390, 1994 Rev Ed) (the \u201cMisrepresentation Act\u201d) to compensate the respondent for five heads of loss and\/or expenses which it would not have incurred but for the first appellant\u2019s misrepresentations (the \u201cDamages Order\u201d). The Tribunal only permitted the respondent to recover 25% of the damages it had sought under each of the five heads as it found the respondent\u2019s evidence of the quantum of the loss it had suffered under each head to be deficient.', 'It should be noted that the Co-Arbitrator Prof Mauro Bussani disagreed with and dissented from certain findings and conclusions of the majority of the Tribunal on the respective liability of the parties as well as the quantum of relief awarded by the majority.'"}

On 19 August 2020, the Minister refused the application. On 2 September 2020, the SDP filed the OS, seeking to set aside the CD on various grounds under s 17 of the POFMA. In particular, the SDP argued that the Subject Statement was a statement of opinion which was not covered by the POFMA and, in the alternative, that it was not a false statement of fact. 6', 'Initially, the SDP also contended that the CD breached Art 14 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1985 Rev Ed) (see the Judgment at [7]).', '11\\u2003At the first hearing of the OS on 11 September 2020, the Judge ordered the matter to be adjourned pending the outcome of two appeals before this court where substantially similar arguments regarding the constitutionality of the POFMA had been made. The Judge also dismissed the SDP\u2019s preliminary oral application for the OS to be heard in open court. The Judge directed that it be heard in chambers. 7', '12\\u2003The judgment in respect of the said pending appeals, The Online Citizen Pte Ltd v Attorney-General and another appeal and other matters [2021] 2 SLR 1358 (\u201cTOC\u201d), was delivered on 8 October 2021. In that judgment, this court upheld the constitutionality of the POFMA and ruled on the applicable burden and standard of proof in applications under s 17 of the POFMA. Consequently, counsel for the SDP indicated that it would not be pursuing its arguments on these points (see the Judgment at [7]). In TOC (at [163]), this court also set out a five-step analytical framework for determining whether a direction made under Part 3 of the POFMA (which includes CDs issued under s 11 of the POFMA) may be set aside under ss 17(5)(a) and\/or 17(5)(b) of the POFMA (\u201cthe TOC Framework\u201d):', '(a)\\u2003First, the court should determine the Minister\u2019s intended meaning in respect of the subject statement that he has identified in the relevant direction.

An objective approach applies in this regard.', '(d)\\u2003Fourth, the court should determine (on an objective approach) whether the identified subject statement is \u201cfalse\u201d in the sense explained in s 2(2)(b) of the POFMA.', '(e)\\u2003Fifth, the court should consider whether the identified subject statement has been, or is being, communicated in Singapore.', '13\\u2003On 28 March 2022, the Judge heard the OS on its merits.', '14\\u2003In his Judgment issued on 10 May 2022, the Judge first set out his reasons for dismissing the SDP\u2019s preliminary application for the OS to be heard in open court. The Judge noted that the default starting position for all originating summonses, as set out in O 28 r 2 of the Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe ROC 2014\u201d), was that they should be heard in chambers. The POFMA did not exclude the application of this provision or specify a different starting position for applications under s 17 of the POFMA. The question was therefore whether special reasons existed to warrant an open court hearing. The Judge found that no such reasons existed. Accordingly, the Judge dismissed this preliminary application (see the Judgment at [15], [26] and [27]).', '15\\u2003The Judge then applied the TOC Framework to the SDP\u2019s substantive application to set aside the CD under s 17(5) of the POFMA. The Judge\u2019s findings in respect of the first, second and fifth steps of the TOC Framework are not in issue here. For the purposes of this application, the key portions of the Judge\u2019s decision relate to the third and fourth steps of the TOC Framework. At the third step, the Judge found that both sentences of the Subject Statement purported to be a report of Dr Cheong\u2019s Statement and that both were statements of fact (see the Judgment at [60] and [63]). At the fourth step, the Judge held that the Subject Statement was false for two reasons (see the Judgment at [67] and [73]\u2013[83]):', '(a)\\u2003First, the SDP had chosen to steer away from Mr Aw\u2019s Letter which made clear that the figures in Dr Cheong\u2019s Statement pertained to living density (which took into account only the land available for urban areas) and not population density. The Judge inferred from the evidence before him that the SDP was aware of Mr Aw\u2019s Letter at all material times and had deliberately substituted \u201cliving density\u201d in Dr Cheong\u2019s Statement with \u201cpopulation density\u201d in the SDP Article and applied Dr Cheong\u2019s figures for living density to Singapore\u2019s total land area.', '(b)\\u2003Second, the SDP must have known that the density in Dr Cheong\u2019s Statement could not simply be applied over Singapore\u2019s total land area because, on a \u201cback of the envelope\u201d calculation, applying this figure to Singapore\u2019s total land area would yield a figure of 7.92 million persons at the time of the IPS Lecture. At that time, however, Singapore\u2019s population was not even 6.9 million persons.', '16\\u2003Accordingly, the Judge dismissed the OS and declined to set aside the CD (see the Judgment at [93]).

{"casename":"2022_SGCA_6","fact":"'2\\u2003The material facts were largely undisputed by the parties and were set out in an Agreed Statement of Facts, which the Judge relied on heavily (see Public Prosecutor v Ahmed Salim [2021] SGHC 68 (\u201cGD\u201d) at [3]\u2013[32]). The key facts were also admitted to by the appellant in his police statements, as well as in what he said to Dr Christopher Cheok Cheng Soon (\u201cDr Cheok\u201d), an IMH psychiatrist who assessed him in January 2019 and who was called as a witness by the Prosecution. While there was initially some dispute over the accuracy of certain facts recorded in the appellant\u2019s police statements, counsel for the appellant, Mr Eugene Thuraisingam (\u201cMr Thuraisingam\u201d), conceded at the outset of his oral submissions before us that the appellant was no longer contesting the accuracy of the facts recorded in the appellant\u2019s police statements. We therefore accept the facts recorded in these statements as true and rely on them in setting out the salient facts, as follows.', '3\\u2003The appellant and the deceased, one Nurhidayati Bt Wartono Surata (\u201cYati\u201d), had been in an intimate relationship from around May 2012. In November 2017, they decided to get married. However, sometime in May or June 2018, Yati started seeing someone else. This led to an initial confrontation with the appellant, but the two reconciled after that and continued dating from sometime in July or August 2018. This proved to be short-lived, however, and by late October or early November 2018, Yati began seeing yet another person, one Hanifa Mohammad Abu (\u201cHanifa\u201d).', '4\\u2003On 9 December 2018, Yati admitted to the appellant that she had a new boyfriend, referring to Hanifa. The appellant was so upset by this that he decided he would kill Yati. He made plans for this, first by choosing his murder weapon. To this end, he searched for and found a rope with which he planned to strangle Yati to death. He decided on the rope as his potential murder weapon because it was soft and easy to keep hidden in his pocket until it was needed and yet strong enough that he could kill her with it. He also knew that it was against the law to carry sharp weapons in public and so ruled out using a knife, presumably because of the risk of his plan being discovered and derailed. As he often used to take Yati to a hotel when they met, he decided that he would bring the rope with him once he knew that they would be going there. He decided that the hotel would be suitable as the murder location because of the privacy it offered, since it would not be as easy to strangle her in other public locations.', '5\\u2003The appellant arranged to meet Yati on 23 December 2018. They checked into a room at the Golden Dragon Hotel (\u201cthe Hotel\u201d). The appellant had brought the rope with him. Yati lied to the appellant that day that she had not met with Hanifa, and convinced the appellant that she would continue to meet the appellant as they had been doing. The appellant therefore decided not to proceed with his plan to kill her. However, after they parted ways, Yati called the appellant later the same evening and told him that she wanted to end their relationship. The appellant was again very upset by this and decided that he would kill her when they next met. The appellant persuaded her to meet him at the Hotel again on 30 December 2018 and she agreed.', '6\\u2003On 30 December 2018, the appellant intentionally wore the same clothes he had worn on the previous occasion because he knew the rope was still in his pocket. That morning, he withdrew nearly all the money in his bank account, in order to remit this to his family in Bangladesh.', '7\\u2003The appellant and Yati later checked into a room at the Hotel. There, he warned her to break off her relationship with Hanifa and threatened to kill her if she did not. He then took a bath towel and circled it around her neck twice in order to frighten her. However, Yati refused to break up with Hanifa and replied that as far as she was concerned, the appellant could kill her. The appellant then \u201cdecided to kill her\u201d and tightened the towel. He saw blood flowing out of one of Yati\u2019s ears and he realised that Yati would call the police if he let go and she survived. He therefore decided to kill her and pulled the towel even tighter using all his strength, by stepping on one end of the towel and pulling at the other end. Yati initially struggled but slowly lost consciousness and stopped moving. The appellant then removed the towel. However, the appellant heard a sound coming from her mouth and was unsure whether she was still alive. The appellant took the rope that he had brought along and circled it around her neck two to three times, \u201cin order to ensure that she died\u201d. He then tightened the rope using strength he described as \u201c7 out of 10\u201d and secured the rope with two or three knots. The appellant noticed that Yati was not moving. However, he continued to hear a very low sound coming from her mouth or nose. In order to \u201cmake sure that she was dead\u201d, he placed a towel over her face and used his hand to press the towel down around the area of her mouth and nose with all his strength for 10 or 15 seconds. The sound ceased, and the appellant observed that Yati\u2019s face had become discoloured. He proceeded to twist Yati\u2019s head from the left to right with a force he described as \u201c6 or 7\u201d on a scale of 10, \u201cto ensure that [even] if [a] doctor came, she also would not survive\u201d.', '8\\u2003Shortly after he killed Yati, the appellant took several steps that evidenced his intention and attempt to escape from Singapore. He informed his dormitory mates that he was returning to Bangladesh, left his dormitory, and changed his location multiple times (GD at [146]). He also handed the money which he had withdrawn that morning to a friend, and asked him to help remit the money to the appellant\u2019s family in Bangladesh. He avoided the attempts of his supervisor to contact him and instead called a staff member who was not familiar with him and told her that he wanted to cancel his work permit and collect his passport. He even volunteered to pay for his own flight ticket even though this was not the usual practice (GD at [147]). He was eventually apprehended by the police when he showed up at his employer\u2019s office to discuss his repatriation arrangements. But even then, he struggled, and force had to be used to effect the arrest (GD at [149]).'"}

He noted that a plaintiff bringing an action under s 32(1) must show (a) contravention of one or more of the provisions in Parts IV, V or VI; and (b) that he has suffered loss or damage directly as a result of such contravention. The Judge accepted that the respondent had contravened ss 13 and 18 of the PDPA (which fall within Part IV) in respect of the appellant\u2019s data but held that the appellant had not suffered any \u201closs or damage\u201d within the meaning of s 32(1). While the appellant\u2019s case was that he suffered loss of control of his personal data and emotional distress, the Judge held that neither of these two types of losses was recognised under s 32(1).

{"casename":"2022_SGCA_62","fact":"facts. It is to these \nundisputed and objective facts which we now turn as we describe how the \nVenture panned out. \nPart 2: How the Venture panned out\n13 Shortly after the Second Meeting, on 10 October 2011, WBL entered \ninto a sale and purchase agreement to purchase a 7,000m2 plot in Phnom Penh \nfor US$11,854,100 (\u201cPlot A\u201d). The particulars of this purchase are set out in the \nVersion No 1: 28 Sep 2022 (11:51 hrs)\nTan Teck Kee v Ratan Kumar Rai[2022] SGCA 62\n7Judgment at [7]\u2013[10] and we need not restate them here. We will only highlight \nfour salient points. First, in addition to the persons present at the First and \nSecond Meetings, there were three others who contributed to the purchase of \nPlot A: Lee Eng Ngee (\u201cMr LEN\u201d), Tan Loo Lee (\u201cMr TLL\u201d) and Lee Teck \nLeng (\u201cMr LTL\u201d). Mr Seah admits that these three men were his \u201cbusiness \npartners\u201d, but the evidence of Mr TLL and Mr LTL (Mr LEN did not give \nevidence) suggests that their relationship with Mr Seah (and that of Mr LEN) \nwas more akin to that of close friends. That said, it is not unequivocally clear \nthat Mr Seah was the one who invited them to invest in the Venture. Mr TLL \ngave evidence that he heard about the opportunity from Mr LEN, who could \nhave been told of the opportunity by Mr Seah. Mr LTL\u2019s evidence was that he \ncame to know about the Venture from Mr Seah. The latter\u2019s evidence clearly \nsupports Mr Rai\u2019s claim, but what is more pertinent to highlight is that neither \nMr TLL nor Mr LTL gave evidence that they had learnt of the Venture from \nWBL directly. The importance of this point should be clear in light of the \nfundamentally opposing cases of the parties.\n14 Returning then to the remaining three salient points in respect of the \npurchase of Plot A: the second is that Mr Rai\u2019s contribution was a significant \nsum of US$1,904,000. The third is that, part of this sum, amounting to \nUS$974,000 was transferred by Mr Rai to Esun International Pte Ltd (\u201cEsun\u201d), \na company controlled by Mr Seah (see the Judgment at [10]) rather than to WBL \ndirectly. Esun sent the money to Mr Tan\u2019s personal bank account, and it was \nthen used to complete the purchase. The last is that, not long after the purchase \nof Plot A, Mr Tan issued a document to the contributing investors on \n1 December 2011. This document was not issued on WBL\u2019s letterhead and was \nsimply titled \u201cCambodian Investment Funds\u201d. It recorded the contributions of \neach investor, and, more importantly, included the following two terms (the full \ndocument is set out in the Judgment at [11]):\nVersion No 1: 28 Sep 2022 (11:51 hrs)\nTan Teck Kee v Ratan Kumar Rai[2022] SGCA 62\n82. The decision on investment opportunities and the amount of \ninvestments for each projects [sic] will be solely decided by \n[Mr Tan] \u2026 director of [WBL], the company handling these \nfunds.\n3. To protect the interests of all subscribers, these funds will be \nlogged in for a minimum period of two years. At the maturity of \nthe investment funds, 10% of the net profit (after deducting \nall cost and tax) will be paid to the director, [Mr Tan] as the \ndirector fees.\n[emphasis added]\n15 The next milestone in the Venture took place on 29 March 2012. On this \ndate, WBL entered into another sale and purchase agreement to purchase a \nfurther 3,000m2 plot adjacent to Plot A (\u201cPlot B\u201d). The price of Plot B was \nUS$5,424,700 and although the group of investors who contributed to the \npurchase of Plot B differed from that in respect of Plot A (see the Judgment at \n[12]\u2013[15]), Mr Rai remained a substantial contributor. He paid US$3,490,252 \ntowards the purchase price of Plot B, all of which was transferred to Mr Tan\u2019s \npersonal bank account instead of to WBL\u2019s bank account. Nothing equivalent \nto the \u201cCambodian Investment Funds\u201d document was issued to the contributors \nfollowing this second acquisition.\n16 The final milestone of the Venture took place sometime between late \n2012 and early 2013. By this time, Plots A and B had appreciated substantially \nin value. The investors determined that it would be more profitable for them to \ndevelop rather than to sell the land. After meetings with potential land \ndevelopers and subsequent negotiations, a joint venture agreement (\u201cJVA\u201d) was \nentered between WBL and Oxley Holdings Limited (\u201cOxley Holdings\u201d) \u2013 a \ncompany listed on the Mainboard of the Singapore Exchange \u2013 to construct a \n45-storey twin tower, mixed-use development called \u201cThe Bridge\u201d on Plots A \nand B. The JVA was signed on 15 July 2013. \nVersion No 1: 28 Sep 2022 (11:51 hrs)\nTan Teck Kee v Ratan Kumar Rai[2022] SGCA 62\n917 Mr Seah and Mr Tan did not adduce any objective evidence of \ncommunications from WBL seeking the investors\u2019 consent to enter into the JVA \n(see the Judgment at [80]). Instead, Mr TLL testified to the effect that it was \nMr Tan, acting in his capacity as a director of WBL, who had sought his consent. \nMr LTL testified that Mr Seah was the one who likely informed him about the \nJVA and conveyed the opportunity to exit the Venture, though he was unable to \nrecall this as a fact. Although neither account was supported by \ncontemporaneous or objective evidence, one would expect Mr TLL\u2019s account, \nif correct, to be supported by objective, written correspondence emanating from \nWBL. On the other hand, given that Mr LTL\u2019s account was premised on \ninformality, the absence of written documentation was not unexpected. \n18 In any event, whatever the circumstances under which it came to be \ndrafted and executed, the JVA provided that the vehicle of the joint venture was \nanother Cambodian company called Oxley Diamond (Cambodia) Co Ltd \n(\u201cOxley Diamond\u201d). WBL and Oxley Holdings each held 50% of the shares in \nOxley Diamond; Mr Tan and Mr Rithy were appointed to Oxley Diamond\u2019s \nboard as WBL\u2019s nominees, and the Chief Executive Officer of Oxley Holdings, \nChing Chiat Kwong (\u201cMr Ching\u201d) was its nominee on Oxley Diamond\u2019s board \n(see the Judgment at [16]\u2013[17]). The JVA provided that WBL and Oxley \nHoldings would each contribute an initial sum of US$35 million to the \ndevelopment of The Bridge, this sum being the valuation of Plots A and B \nagreed upon by the parties. Therefore, to put the JVA simply, WBL was to \ncontribute US$35 million in land, and Oxley Holdings was to pay for the \ndevelopment costs up to the same value.\n19 After the JVA was signed, nothing of particular significance took place \nuntil 31 December 2013. On or around this date, Mr Tan sent a document \nbearing WBL\u2019s letterhead to the investors who remained invested in the Venture \nVersion No 1: 28 Sep 2022 (11:51 hrs)\nTan Teck Kee v Ratan Kumar Rai[2022] SGCA 62\n10after the JVA was signed. This document, titled \u201cInvestment Agreement for \n\u2018The Bridge\u2019\u201d (the \u201cInvestment Agreement\u201d), recorded each investor\u2019s \ncontribution to the Venture (ie, the sums they each contributed to the purchase \nof Plots A and B) and, thus, their share of the profits which WBL stood to earn \nfrom the JVA. Mr Rai\u2019s total contribution was recorded as US$5,394,252 and \nthis entitled him to a share of 31.2% of the profits (see the Judgment at [99]). \nThree further points about this document, are also worth noting.\n20 First, the Investment Agreement states that WBL entered into the JVA \n\u201cwith the consent of all the subscribers to this fund\u201d (see the Judgment at [19]). \nThis statement pulls into even sharper focus the curious total absence of \nobjective evidence demonstrating that formal requests for investors\u2019 consent \nhad in fact emanated from WBL (see [ 17] above). Second, the Investment \nAgreement also provided that 10% of the net profit would be paid to WBL as \nmanagement fees, \u201cafter deducting all costs and tax\u201d (see the Judgment at [19] \nand [97]). This contradicts the terms of the \u201cCambodian Investment Funds\u201d \ndocument which provided that Mr Tan was the one entitled to 10% of the profits \nas his \u201cdirector fees\u201d (see [ 14] above). Third, after 15 July but before \n31 December 2013, the investors in the Venture were not issued any formal \nwritten document recording their interest in the profits which WBL stood to \nearn from the JVA. On Mr Rai\u2019s case, he was the one who asked for this \ndocument because he was critically ill at that time and he wanted to ensure that \nhis wife would be able to handle his affairs should something untoward happen \nto him. Mr Tan\u2019s version of events is that he procured the Investment \nAgreement to ensure that, should anything happen to him (ie, Mr Tan), the \ninvestors would be able to prove the extent of their investments (see the \nJudgment at [80]). It is pertinent to note that, on either account, the Investment \nAgreement was not a document created contemporaneously to capture ongoing \nchanges in the investors\u2019 position vis-\u00e0-vis the Venture. Instead, it was a \nVersion No 1: 28 Sep 2022 (11:51 hrs)\nTan Teck Kee v Ratan Kumar Rai[2022] SGCA 62\n11retrospective document aimed at formalising the informal understanding of the \nVenture among the parties. Therefore, even if Mr Tan\u2019s account is preferred, it \nis not entirely clear how it supports his and Mr Seah\u2019s claim that the Venture \nwas WBL-led.\n21 The foregoing paragraphs adequately capture how the Venture broadly \npanned out. Thus, we turn next to the third segment of the parties\u2019 dispute. This \nconcerns the period after the Venture had become profitable and when profit \ndistributions started to be made to (or withheld from) the investors. In particular, \nwe are concerned with: (a) four payments made to Mr Rai, the first of which he \nreceived in 2015 and the balance three in 2018 (see the Judgment at [24]); and \n(b) US$35 million which WBL received from Oxley Diamond as dividends \nunder the JVA, in respect of which no distribution has, to-date, been made to \nthe investors. In respect of (a), Mr Rai also alleged that Mr Tan had made \nwrongful deductions prior to issuing the distributions.\nPart 3: Distributions made and withheld by WBL; deductions\n22 In July 2015, WBL and Oxley Holdings agreed to amend the JVA to \naccount for the latter\u2019s reduced contribution from US$35 million to \nUS$20 million as the land development costs were lower than initially \nestimated. As a consequence, WBL\u2019s contribution to the joint venture outvalued \nthat of Oxley Holdings by US$15 million. Accordingly, it was agreed that Oxley \nHoldings would reimburse WBL to the tune of US$15 million, which it did on \n17 July 2015. WBL, in turn, apportioned this US$15 million amongst the \nremaining investors in the Venture on or around 11 August 2015. For his 31.2% \nshare in the Venture, Mr Rai received the sum of US$4,672,009 (the \u201cFirst \nPayout\u201d) (see the Judgment at [22] and [24(a)]). With respect to the First Payout, \nno wrongful deduction has been alleged by Mr Rai (see the Judgment at [115]).\nVersion No 1: 28 Sep 2022 (11:51 hrs)\nTan Teck Kee v Ratan Kumar Rai[2022] SGCA 62\n1223 From the date of the First Payout until January 2018, nothing of interest \noccurred in relation to dividends from Oxley Diamond and payment to the \ninvestors. On 17 January 2018, Mr Tan informed Mr Rai that WBL would be \nreceiving dividends from Oxley Diamond pursuant to the JVA, and that these \nfunds would be distributed to the investors once received. On 27 March 2018, \nMr Tan confirmed that US$10 million had been received from Oxley Diamond, \nand that Mr Rai would receive $2,840,892 (converted from US to Singapore \ndollars at the rate of US$1 is to S$1.30) for his 31.2% share, after deductions. \nOn 2 April 2018, two cheques amounting to $2,840,000 were issued to Mr Rai \nby Mr Seah (see the Judgment at [24(b)]) (the \u201cSecond Payout\u201d). \n24 Before turning to the next payout, we should state that it was Mr Rai\u2019s \ncase that two improper deductions were made by Mr Tan from the dividends \nbefore the Second Payout. The first was the deduction of 20% allegedly made \non account of capital gains tax. Mr Rai contends no capital gains tax was \npayable at the time. The second was a deduction of 15% for withholding tax \nwhen the correct deduction would have been of 14%. At the trial, Mr Rai called \nVanessa Sok (\u201cMs Sok\u201d), a Cambodian lawyer, as his expert witness. She \nconfirmed that WBL did not need to pay capital gains tax at the material time, \nand that the applicable withholding tax rate was 14% (see the Judgment at \n[116]\u2013[117] and [119]\u2013[120]). Mr Seah and Mr Tan\u2019s Cambodian law expert \nwas not asked to provide his opinion on these issues (see the Judgment at [115]). \nThere was thus no serious dispute that Ms Sok\u2019s opinion was accurate. \n25 Following communications between Mr Tan and Mr Rai in June 2018, \nMr Rai was informed that WBL would be receiving further dividends of \nUS$10 million from Oxley Diamond. For his 31.2% interest in the Venture, \nMr Rai received a cheque for the sum of S$2,539,555 on 12 June 2018 (the \n\u201cThird Payout\u201d). The cheque for this sum was, again, issued by Mr Seah and \nVersion No 1: 28 Sep 2022 (11:51 hrs)\nTan Teck Kee v Ratan Kumar Rai[2022] SGCA 62\n13not by WBL. In respect of the Third Payout, like the Second Payout, Mr Rai \nclaimed that Mr Tan had wrongfully deducted capital gains tax and excessive \nwithholding tax (see the Judgment at [116] and [119]). Further, even though the \ndividends received from Oxley Diamond in respect of the Second and Third \nPayouts were the same (ie, US$10 million), we note that the sums actually paid \nto Mr Rai on the two occasions were curiously different. \n26 Finally, on 17 October 2018, Mr Tan informed Mr Rai that there would \nbe a further distribution of US$10 million. On 15 November 2018, Mr Tan sent \na further message to inform Mr Rai that the total amount, after deductions, \nwould be US$7,650,000, and that Mr Rai would be receiving US$2,368,800 for \nhis 31.2% share. Four days later, Mr Rai received a cheque for this sum and \nagain, the payment was from Mr Seah (the \u201cFourth Payout\u201d). In respect of the \nFourth Payout, Mr Rai only claimed that Mr Tan had wrongfully deducted \nexcessive withholding tax; unlike the Second and Third Payouts, he did not \nallege that there was wrongful deduction for capital gains tax (see the Judgment \nat [116] and [119]).\n27 At the trial, Mr Tan explained that the calculations for the deductions \nwere carried out by the staff of WBL, and not by him personally, though he did \nnot adduce any written documentation to evidence such calculations. Under \ncross-examination, he accounted for the lack of written evidence with the \nexplanation that the calculations were conveyed to him verbally at a meeting. \nHowever, Mr Tan subsequently changed his evidence under cross-examination \nand claimed that the staff of WBL had given him a thumb drive containing the \ncalculations, which he had subsequently lost. Mr Tan did not, however, attempt \nto obtain a duplicate copy of these calculations. He claimed that there was \nsimply no reason for him to doubt the correctness of the calculations prepared \nby WBL\u2019s staff (see the Judgment at [122]\u2013[123]). Of course, whether it was \nVersion No 1: 28 Sep 2022 (11:51 hrs)\nTan Teck Kee v Ratan Kumar Rai[2022] SGCA 62\n14reasonable for Mr Tan to have taken this course depends on a variety of \nconsiderations. Even so, however, it should be noted that a specific discovery \norder compelling him to disclose his correspondence with WBL\u2019s finance staff \nwas made on 5 July 2021, three weeks before the start of the trial. By this stage \nof the proceedings, it was clear that Mr Rai had made allegations of wrongful \ndeductions against Mr Tan. Yet, no explanation was proffered by Mr Tan as to \nwhy he did not take basic steps to answer these allegations.\n28 Finally, we turn to the last important facet of the case in relation to the \npayouts. There is no dispute that, between April 2018 and August 2019, WBL \nreceived a further sum of US$35 million from Oxley Diamond which was \nretained without consulting the investors, including Mr Rai (see the Judgment \nat [125] and [129]). In fact, Mr Rai and the other investors were not even \ninformed that this large sum had been received by WBL. It was only by way of \na subpoena for documents served on Mr Ching that this came to be discovered \nby Mr Rai on the second day of the trial (see the Judgment at [125]). \n29 When questioned about WBL\u2019s receipt of these dividends from Oxley \nDiamond, Mr Tan asserted that WBL \u2013 and, by extension, he (as a director of \nWBL at the time) \u2013 did not owe any duty of disclosure to the investors (see the \nJudgment at [127]). Further, such money had to be retained by WBL because it \nmay be required for a \u201cguaranteed rental scheme\u201d (\u201cGRR Scheme\u201d) promised \nby Oxley Diamond to purchasers of units in The Bridge. By this scheme, \npotential purchasers were allegedly incentivised to buy units in The Bridge \nbecause they were guaranteed rental earnings for a specified duration (see the \nJudgment at [130]). In due course, we will turn to the appropriate inferences to \nbe drawn from these explanations. Nevertheless, it bears highlighting at this \npoint: (a) that the latter explanation was maintained despite Mr Tan conceding \nthat Oxley Diamond did not actually impose any conditions on the use of the \nVersion No 1: 28 Sep 2022 (11:51 hrs)\nTan Teck Kee v Ratan Kumar Rai[2022] SGCA 62\n15US$35 million which was distributed to WBL (see the Judgment at [131]); and \n(b) the assertion that such funds needed to be retained for the GRR Scheme was \nnot pleaded.\nPart 4: Commencement of Suit 160\n30 Whatever one makes of the foregoing events, what is plainly evident is \nthat the Venture was successful. Indeed, on 29 April 2018, Oxley Holdings \nissued a press release which reported that sales from The Bridge had garnered a \n\u201cgross profit of S$140.8 million with a gross profit margin of 38%\u201d. This came \nto the attention of Mr Rai, who claimed that he turned to Mr Seah and Mr Tan \nfor more information. No record of these requests exists and Mr Rai\u2019s \nexplanation for this was that they were made orally, in person. In any case, \nMr Rai claimed that the information was not forthcoming from them, and so, on \n4 February 2019, he commenced Suit 160 against them for an account. WBL \nwas added as a third defendant on 4 December 2019, but, as stated at [ 3] above, \nit did not participate in the trial.\nThe decision below\n31 Drawing together all of the facts, circumstances and explanations put \nforth by the parties (as summarised above), the Judge found that Mr Seah and \nMr Tan were fiduciaries to Mr Rai. In respect of Mr Seah, she found that his \nrole was more limited and, accordingly, ordered that a relatively narrow \ncommon account be taken (see the Judgment at [133]\u2013[134]) in relation to his \ninvolvement. As Mr Seah did not"}

We only set out the material facts for present purposes.', '7\\u2003On 17 June 2016, various Central Narcotic Bureau (\u201cCNB\u201d) officers were deployed in the vicinity of Block 350, Anchorvale Road, Singapore as part of a covert operation. At about 3.35pm, one Muhammad Haikal Bin Abdullah (\u201cHaikal\u201d) rode a motorcycle (\u201cthe Motorcycle\u201d) into the carpark of Block 350. After parking, Haikal retrieved a white plastic bag from the Motorcycle and took the lift of Block 350 up to the 17th floor. There, he met Saridewi and handed a white plastic bag over to her. In exchange, Saridewi handed him an envelope with the marking \u201c10.000\u201d. After the exchange, they parted ways.

{"casename":"2022_SGCA_66","fact":"'6\\u2003The respondent, Banque Cantonale de Geneve (\u201cBCG\u201d), is a Swiss bank in the business, inter alia, of trade financing. In May 2020, by way of a letter of credit, BCG financed a transaction for the purchase of 2,000 metric tons of Lube Base Oil 150BS (\u201cthe Cargo\u201d) by its customer, one GP Global APAC Pte Ltd (\u201cGP Global\u201d). GP Global in turn chartered the Vessel from JIL to carry the Cargo.', '7\\u2003A set of original bills of lading was issued in respect of the Cargo (\u201cthe Original BL\u201d). The Original BL named BCG as the consignee, and it was provided by GP Global to BCG under the terms of the letter of credit. However, it was undisputed that, sometime in late-June 2020, BCG had released and endorsed the Original BL to GP Global pursuant to the latter\u2019s request. According to BCG, GP Global had requested for the return of the Original BL, in order to procure the delivery of the Cargo to its buyer, one Prime Oil Trading Pte Ltd (\u201cPrime Oil\u201d)', '8\\u2003Between July and August 2020, BCG became concerned that several shipments involving GP Global (including the Cargo) for which it had provided financing appeared questionable. BCG also learnt sometime in July 2020 that the Cargo had been discharged without production of the Original BL, a fact which it apparently verified following further investigations. On 10 October 2020, BCG commenced HC\/ADM 256\/2020 (\u201cADM 256\u201d). The writ in ADM 256 (\u201cthe Writ\u201d) contained the following endorsement of claim:', '9\\u2003On 10 October 2020, BCG obtained a warrant of arrest for the Vessel (\u201cWA 39\u201d). WA 39 contained an endorsement of claim that was identical to the one in the Writ. At the hearing of the application for WA 39, BCG claimed to be the \u201cholder\u201d of the Original BL. Quite clearly, that was incorrect because BCG had by then already released and endorsed the Original BL to GP Global (see [7] above).', '10\\u2003On 11 October 2020, WA 39 was executed, and the Vessel was arrested. At that time, however, JIL was already in possession of the Original BL. This was because, by 29 June 2020, the Original BL had been surrendered by GP Global to JIL, and a set of switched bills of lading (\u201cthe Switched BL\u201d) was issued in place of the Original BL, pursuant to GP Global\u2019s request. According to JIL, GP Global had made this request sometime on or around 16 June 2020, and the Original BL that was surrendered to it contained a stamped and signed endorsement by BCG on its reverse side, with the words \u201c[d]eliver to the order of GP Global APAC Pte Ltd\u201d. Thus, by the time the Writ was issued, JIL and not BCG was in possession of the Original BL.', '11\\u2003Immediately after the arrest of the Vessel, JIL instructed their solicitors to seek BCG\u2019s confirmation that it (BCG) was still in possession of the Original BL. On 13 October 2020, BCG\u2019s solicitors replied, stating that they were \u201cinstructed to inform \u2026 that [BCG] holds the original 3\/3 Bills of Lading\u201d. In the event, on 19 October 2020, JIL furnished security by way of payment into court in the sum of S$2.1m (\u201cthe Security\u201d) to secure the release of the Vessel, and the Vessel was eventually released on 21 October 2020.', '12\\u2003On 4 November 2020, BCG filed its statement of claim in ADM 256 (\u201cthe SOC\u201d). Then, on 10 November 2020, JIL instructed its solicitors to file a Notice to Produce, requesting to inspect, amongst other things, the Original BL that BCG claimed was still in its custody. On 16 November 2020, BCG\u2019s solicitors filed a Notice of Inspection wherein they stated that they did not have the Original BL in their possession and hence it was not available for inspection. The Notice further added that the solicitors had requested BCG to send the Original BL to them and, once received, they would notify JIL\u2019s solicitors to arrange for the inspection to take place. It is not disputed that BCG\u2019s solicitors did not follow up with JIL\u2019s solicitors as regards the inspection of the Original BL.', '13\\u2003On 30 November 2020, JIL filed its defence & counterclaim in ADM 256 (\u201cthe D&CC\u201d). JIL averred in the D&CC the abovementioned facts relating to the switching and the cancellation of the Original BL (see [10] above). JIL further averred that the Cargo had been properly discharged into the possession of one Standard Asiatic Oil Company Ltd, which was the consignee of the Switched BL and thus entitled to take delivery of the Cargo. BCG claimed that it was only upon reviewing the D&CC that it came to its attention that the Original BL had been switched and that it no longer had possession of the Original BL. BCG claimed that it was also only through subsequent internal investigations that it learned that the Original BL had been delivered to GP Global in late-June 2020 pursuant to the latter\u2019s request to facilitate the delivery of the Cargo to Prime Oil (see [7] above).', '14\\u2003On 15 January 2021, BCG filed its reply and defence to counterclaim (\u201cthe Reply\u201d). In the Reply, BCG acknowledged that it had, in late-June 2020, voluntarily released the Original BL to GP Global pursuant to the latter\u2019s request, but averred that it was unaware that GP Global had requested the Original BL for the purpose of switching the Original BL. It added that if it had known that GP Global had intended to switch the Original BL, it would have denied GP Global\u2019s request.', '15\\u2003On 4 February 2021, BCG filed HC\/SUM 586\/2021 to amend the SOC. The amendment abandoned BCG\u2019s original claim for misdelivery of the Cargo. The amended claim was instead based on an alleged wrongful switch of the Original BL without BCG\u2019s knowledge or consent. BCG pleaded that the wrongful switch was, amongst other matters, a breach of the contract of carriage as evidenced by the Original BL, a breach of JIL\u2019s duty to BCG to take reasonable care of the Cargo which resulted in loss and damage to BCG, as well as a breach of JIL\u2019s duty as bailee of the Cargo for reward. A day later, on 5 February 2021, JIL filed HC\/SUM 599\/2021 (\u201cSUM 599\u201d) to set aside WA 39, and also to strike out the Writ and ADM 256 pursuant to O 18 r 19 of the Rules. SUM 599 also sought the return of the Security, and an order for BCG to pay damages for wrongful arrest. It should be noted that, in addition, JIL has pursued a counterclaim for wrongful arrest against BCG.'"}

Azlin and Ridzuan started to abuse the Deceased some three months prior to the week in which the four scalding incidents occurred. These acts of abuse were the subject of other charges brought against Azlin and Ridzuan. Among other things, Ridzuan had used pliers to hurt the Deceased twice in July 2016 (charges D2 and D3). This was followed in August 2016 by Azlin hitting the Deceased with a broomstick (charge C2). Later that same month, Azlin pushed the Deceased and caused him to fall and hit his head on the edge of a pillar and this caused him to bleed from the head (charge C3). In October 2016, Ridzuan applied a heated spoon on the palm of the Deceased (charge D5), flicked ash from a lighted cigarette on him, and hit him with a hanger (charge D6).', '7\\u2003In another incident in October 2016, Azlin pushed the Deceased, causing him to hit his head against the wall, and Ridzuan punched the Deceased on the face so hard that his nasal bone was fractured (charges C5A and D7A).

He was only let out of the cage to be fed (charges C6 and D9).', '8\\u2003The four scalding incidents occurred in the period from 15 to 22 October 2016 and may be summarised as follows.', '(a)\\u2003Incident 1: Between 15 and 17 October 2016, Azlin suspected that the Deceased had consumed some milk powder, and she poured hot water on the Deceased several times.', '(b)\\u2003Incident 2: Between 17 and 19 October 2016, Azlin poured hot water on the Deceased (though she does not remember why she did so). This caused the Deceased to shout at Azlin in response saying some words that were translated as, \u201cAre you crazy or what?\u201d. This angered both Azlin and Ridzuan and, as a result, they both splashed several cups of hot water on the Deceased.', '(c)\\u2003Incident 3: On or around 21 October 2016, Azlin became angry with the Deceased when he kept asking for a drink, and poured nine or ten cups of hot water on the Deceased, though on some of these attempts, she missed the Deceased.', '(d)\\u2003Incident 4: On 22 October 2016 at about noon, Azlin asked the Deceased to remove his shorts so that he could have his bath, but the Deceased did not do so.

The customers would place orders for drugs with Ahmad, and Ahmad would use the appellant as a courier to bring the drugs from Malaysia to Singapore. The appellant may also be contacted directly by Ahmad\u2019s customers to arrange for delivery of the drugs.

{"casename":"2022_SGCA_69","fact":"'5\\u2003Much of the factual background has been helpfully recounted by the Judge in the GD, and we restate only the facts material to the present appeal. As there are several overlapping categories and classifications of the 76 vessels which are the subject of the parties\u2019 dispute, we also make reference where appropriate to a table which summarises the relevant facts in relation to each of these vessels (\u201cthe Table of Vessels\u201d). This Table of Vessels is contained in the Annex to our judgment.', '6\\u2003Mr Lim Oon Kuin had procured the incorporation of various companies including OTPL, Xihe Holdings (Pte) Ltd (\u201cXH\u201d), Xihe Capital (Pte) Ltd (\u201cXC\u201d) and Hin Leong Trading (Pte) Ltd (\u201cHLT\u201d). XH and XC were part of the Xihe Group. Some of XH\u2019s subsidiaries owned vessels, and 40 such subsidiaries are relevant to the present appeal (\u201cthe XH Companies\u201d).', '7\\u2003Prior to the entry into insolvency processes of OTPL, HLT and certain companies in the Xihe Group, their businesses were connected. In particular, the XH Companies (as shipowners) chartered their vessels to OTPL, principally under bareboat charters. OTPL would then sub-charter those vessels to, or enter into contracts of carriage with, various other parties (including HLT) on time or voyage charters. This formed a significant part of OTPL\u2019s business of ship chartering and ship management (see [2] of the GD).', '8\\u2003In late April 2020, HLT filed an application to be placed under judicial management. OTPL filed a similar application on 6 May 2020, and the OTPL JMs were appointed as interim judicial managers of OTPL on 12 May 2020 pursuant to an order of court (\u201cthe OTPL IJM Order\u201d) (see [4] of the GD). OTPL\u2019s judicial management had the following objectives:', '9\\u2003On 18 May 2020, a meeting took place between the OTPL JMs and the management of the Xihe Group (\u201cthe Meeting\u201d) regarding vessels that OTPL had chartered from the XH Companies (see [6] of the GD). In their presentation slides (\u201cthe Slides\u201d) for the Meeting, the OTPL JMs stated that due to the market\u2019s loss of confidence in the trading ability of OTPL\u2019s fleet, OTPL was unable to continue servicing its bareboat charter obligations to the XH Companies, and as such wished to consensually terminate the bareboat charters. In this connection, the OTPL JMs proposed arrangements for the physical redelivery of the chartered vessels to the XH Companies, or alternatively for ship management agreements to be entered into between OTPL and the XH Companies.', '10\\u2003From 20 May 2020 to 3 June 2020, notices of termination (\u201cthe Termination Notices\u201d) were issued by the XH Companies in respect of bareboat charters for 41 vessels, 30 of which are relevant to this appeal. These 30 vessels are identified in Column A of the Table of Vessels.', '11\\u2003On 27 May 2020 and 30 May 2020, these Termination Notices were accepted by the OTPL JMs, who agreed to redeliver the vessels subject to payment of the cost of bunkers \u201cremaining on board\u201d (\u201cROB\u201d) as provided for under the charterparties. The OTPL JMs and the XH Companies then discussed redelivery for 28 of these 30 vessels. However, redelivery of these vessels did not take place (see [7]\u2013[8] of the GD).', '12\\u2003According to the XH Companies, the OTPL JMs had initially proceeded on the basis that they could redeliver the 37 vessels to the relevant XH Companies without an order of court. However, at a meeting on 22 June 2020, the OTPL JMs said that they needed an order of court, and that either they or the XH Companies should apply for such an order.', '13\\u2003On 6 July 2020, the relevant XH Companies filed HC\/OS 652\/2020 (\u201cOS 652\u201d) seeking leave of court to take redelivery of 37 vessels that were the subject of bareboat charters with OTPL. They also sought a declaration that the XH Companies (upon taking delivery of their respective vessels) were entitled to take over and pay for various expenses for their vessels (ie, outstanding ROB) by way of set off against the bareboat charterhire due and payable by OTPL to the XH Companies. As the Judge noted, it is unclear why leave of court for redelivery was not sought for all 41 vessels (see [9] of the GD), but this is not material for present purposes. Of the 37 vessels that were in issue in OS 652, nine were not included in HC\/SUM 2085\/2021 (\u201cSUM 2085\u201d) (viz, the \u201cOcean Gar\u201d, the \u201cReliance\u201d, the \u201cOcean Buri\u201d, the \u201cOcean Seal\u201d, the \u201cOcean Clover\u201d, the \u201cOcean Moray\u201d, the \u201cOcean Dolphin\u201d, the \u201cOcean Cod\u201d and the \u201cOcean Bass\u201d) and the owners of these vessels are not parties to the present dispute. The Judge\u2019s decision in respect of SUM 2085 is the subject of the present appeal. Hence, only 28 of the vessels in issue in OS 652 are relevant to the present proceedings (identified in Column B of the Table of Vessels). It should, however, be noted that the XH Companies\u2019 supporting affidavit stated that their view was that the OTPL JMs (then interim judicial managers), with all the powers of judicial managers pursuant to the OTPL IJM Order, could redeliver the 37 vessels without an order of court.', '14\\u2003No hearing date was fixed for OS 652 as the consent of the mortgagees of the vessels to the termination of the bareboat charters had yet to be obtained, and the terms of redelivery had yet to be worked out between the XH Companies and the OTPL JMs. The discussions on the terms of redelivery did not reach any conclusion (see the GD at [9]\u2013[10]).', '15\\u2003Concurrently, from 12 May 2020 to 8 September 2020, the OTPL JMs marketed some of the XH Companies\u2019 vessels for hire in the lists of vessels in OTPL\u2019s fleet which were sent to brokers and charterers. Some of these marketed vessels (though not all) were then successfully deployed on sub-charters. The facts pertaining to these vessels are discussed in more detail at [95]\u2013[104] below.', '16\\u2003On 7 August 2020, the OTPL JMs were appointed as judicial managers of OTPL pursuant to an Order of Court (\u201cthe OTPL JM Order\u201d) (see the GD at [4]).', '17\\u2003On 13 August 2020, XH and four of the XH Companies were placed in interim judicial management, and the XH JMs were appointed as interim judicial managers (\u201cthe XH IJM Order\u201d) (see the GD at [10]).', '18\\u2003From 31 August 2020 to 3 September 2020, the OTPL JMs sent notices to the relevant XH Companies electing not to adopt the bareboat charters in respect of 74 out of the 76 vessels (\u201cthe Notices of Non-Adoption\u201d) (identified in Column C of the Table of Vessels). No Notices of Non-Adoption were necessary for the remaining two vessels because these had been on time charters which had already been terminated, and they had already been redelivered by OTPL prior to the OTPL JM Order (see the GD at [11]).', '19\\u2003On 1 and 2 September 2020, the XH JMs issued notices to the OTPL JMs retracting the Termination Notices. In response to the Notices of Non-Adoption, between 10 and 15 September 2020, the XH JMs issued notices to the OTPL JMs affirming the bareboat charters. The XH JMs also sought leave to discontinue OS 652 (their application for leave of court for the redelivery of vessels), and this was granted on 28 September 2020 (see the GD at [12]).', '20\\u2003On 1 October 2020, the OTPL JMs applied for leave to disclaim and terminate various bareboat charters as unprofitable contracts in HC\/SUM 4257\/2020 (\u201cSUM 4257\u201d). On 23 November 2020, the Judge granted such leave in respect of the bareboat charters for 52 vessels, on the basis that the leave was to be deemed to have taken effect on 10 November 2020. All 52 of those vessels were among the 76 vessels in issue in SUM 2085. The 52 vessels are identified in Column D of the Table of Vessels. The order made by the Judge also contained consent orders pertaining to how redelivery of the specified vessels (save for three of the vessels) was to be effected, and stipulated that the XH Companies would bear all costs for crewing, maintenance and upkeep that might be reasonably incurred from 10 November 2020 until redelivery (albeit that this was without prejudice to the XH Companies\u2019 rights to claim such costs from OTPL) (see the GD at [13]\u2013[14]).', '21\\u2003Before the OTPL JMs were granted leave to disclaim the bareboat charters in SUM 4257, they presented their First Judicial Managers\u2019 Report to the court on the progress of OTPL\u2019s judicial management on 6 November 2020. This report stated that, as the OTPL JMs \u201cha[d] been unable to find meaningful employment for nearly all of the vessels in order for them to provide a benefit to OTPL\u201d, in early September 2020, they had sought to repudiate the bareboat charters for these vessels and arrange redelivery. However, seven specified vessels owned by the XH Companies had not been included in SUM 4257 because they were to be retained and employed by OTPL for an interim period in order to generate a benefit for OTPL. The OTPL JMs issued Notices of Adoption in respect of these vessels (see the GD at [59]).', '22\\u2003On 13 November 2020, the XH JMs were appointed judicial managers (see the GD at [10]).', '23\\u2003A dispute subsequently arose between the parties regarding whether the XH Companies\u2019 claims against OTPL for charterhire and various costs (such as costs for crewing, maintenance, upkeep, insurance, surveys and the repair of the vessels) incurred in relation to the vessels were priority claims in OTPL\u2019s judicial management or winding up. This began with the XH JMs\u2019 solicitors\u2019 letter to the OTPL JMs\u2019 solicitors on 2 December 2020, in which they reserved the XH JMs\u2019 right to lodge proofs of debt in OTPL\u2019s judicial management for claims amounting to over US$156m and asserted that these were priority claims ranking pari passu with the OTPL JMs\u2019 remuneration and expenses. The XH JMs\u2019 solicitors also stated that, pending the adjudication of these proofs of debt and the determination of their priority, the OTPL JMs should preserve sufficient funds to meet these claims and should not make any distributions to other priority claimants. The XH Companies\u2019 proofs of debt were filed on 18 December 2020 (see the GD at [15]\u2013[22]).', '24\\u2003On 1 May 2021, the OTPL JMs filed SUM 2085 seeking the court\u2019s directions regarding these claims arising out of OTPL\u2019s bareboat charters of the 76 vessels owned by the XH Companies. These claims fell within two categories: (a) charterhire for the period of use (ie, the period of sub-charter or carriage entered into by OTPL with various parties), and (b) ancillary liabilities (ie, sums other than charterhire payable or to be borne by OTPL under the bareboat charters) incurred during the period of use (see the GD at [23]). The former category of claims will be referred to as \u201cCharterhire Claims\u201d while the latter category will be referred to as \u201cAncillary Claims\u201d, and both categories of claims arising out of or in connection with the bareboat charters will be collectively referred to as \u201cthe Claims\u201d. The OTPL JMs were prepared to admit the Claims (to the extent that the amounts were agreed) as OTPL\u2019s debts, but argued before the Judge that the Principle did not apply to confer priority on them because the OTPL JMs did not choose to retain possession of the vessels for the benefit of the judicial management; they had wanted to return these vessels and had taken steps to do so, and it was the XH Companies\u2019 refusal to take possession of their vessels that had forced them to remain in OTPL\u2019s hands. Accordingly, the OTPL JMs contended that the Claims should be treated as ordinary unsecured debts ranking pari passu with OTPL\u2019s other unsecured debts. The XH JMs, on the other hand, argued before the Judge that the Principle applied to elevate the Claims to priority expenses in OTPL\u2019s judicial management which should be paid in priority to OTPL\u2019s unsecured debts, because the OTPL JMs had retained the vessels for the benefit of OTPL\u2019s creditors and judicial management, and they thereby took a calculated risk that this could lead to the XH Companies having preferential claims against OTPL.', '25\\u2003After the filing of SUM 2085, the XH Companies\u2019 solicitors asked whether OTPL had put the vessels on the market or advertised their availability for charter, with the intention of chartering the vessels to generate income for OTPL. OTPL\u2019s solicitors responded via e-mail on 3 July 2021 (\u201cthe OTPL Solicitors\u2019 E-mail\u201d), stating that it was part of the OTPL JMs\u2019 duties as interim judicial managers to assess initially whether OTPL\u2019s vessels could be redeployed in a commercially viable way, as part of their consideration of the options available for OTPL\u2019s ship management and chartering business. The OTPL Solicitors\u2019 E-mail also stated that, as was common in the ship chartering industry, enquiries from potential customers would be received by OTPL, and suitable vessels would be identified for further discussion. The OTPL chartering team had also telephoned brokers and potential clients to seek new business and\/or to make them aware that OTPL remained open to chartering business.', '26\\u2003To put the practical significance of the parties\u2019 dispute in context, the quantum of the Claims is very large. As we noted in An Guang Shipping Pte Ltd (judicial managers appointed) and others v Ocean Tankers (Pte) Ltd (in liquidation) [2022] 1 SLR 1232 (\u201cAn Guang Shipping (SUM 89)\u201d) at [4], treating the Claims as preferred debts would result in applying all of OTPL\u2019s assets towards them, leaving nothing for OTPL\u2019s unsecured creditors. That said, we note that (as OTPL points out) the XH Companies have not provided any figures to quantify the specific Claims they are pursuing in the present appeal.', '27\\u2003Separately, OTPL also highlights that there are ongoing proceedings in which the XH JMs assert that they are not obliged to pay the sums that they had undertaken to bear (which were expenses incurred by the OTPL JMs in respect of the vessels) as a priority payment in the XH Companies\u2019 judicial management.', '28\\u2003On 20 September 2021, the Judge delivered his brief oral grounds in respect of SUM 2085 (\u201cthe Oral Judgment\u201d), in which he held that the Principle would generally not apply to the XH Companies\u2019 claims. The Judge set out the detailed reasons for his decision in the GD issued on 14 March 2022. We summarise the key aspects of the Judge\u2019s reasoning at [31]\u2013[34] below.', '29\\u2003 On 19 October 2021, the XH Companies filed their Notice of Appeal against the Judge\u2019s decision. As the Judge\u2019s decision was in respect of a summons (namely, SUM 2085), a two-Judge coram of the Court of Appeal was constituted to hear the appeal pursuant to para 4(i) of the Seventh Schedule to the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed).', '30\\u2003While not material to the present appeal, we mention by way of background that on 1 November 2021, OTPL applied in CA\/SUM 89\/2021 to strike out the Notice of Appeal on the ground that the XH Companies had not obtained leave of court before filing the appeal, which OTPL argued was required under s 133(1) of the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act 2018 (Act 40 of 2018) (\u201cthe IRDA\u201d). We dismissed this application on 21 February 2022, with our full reasons set out in An Guang Shipping (SUM 89).'"}
{"casename":"2022_SGCA_7","fact":"'2\\u2003In April 2021, a dispute between the parties arose as a result of Dongah\u2019s alleged failure to make progress payments to Jungwoo under a subcontract. Jungwoo served a payment claim on Dongah pursuant to the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act 2004 (2020 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe SOPA\u201d), and on 15 July 2021, the adjudicator rendered his adjudication determination, holding that Dongah was liable to pay Jungwoo a sum of $2,428,690.04 (\u201cthe Adjudicated Sum\u201d).', '3\\u2003On 16 August 2021, Dongah filed HC\/OS 831\/2021 to, amongst other matters, set aside the adjudication determination and seek a stay of enforcement in the alternative. The High Court Judge delivered his judgment on 22 October 2021 dismissing Dongah\u2019s application to set aside the adjudication determination. However, he ordered a partial stay in respect of the enforcement of the adjudication determination and granted a partial release of the Adjudicated Sum to Jungwoo.', '4\\u2003On 28 October 2021, Dongah filed Civil Appeal No 112 of 2021 (\u201cAD\/CA 112\/2021\u201d) before the Appellate Division of the High Court (\u201cAppellate Division\u201d). On the same day, Dongah filed AD\/SUM 28\/2021 seeking a stay of the order for the partial release of the Adjudicated Sum.', '5\\u2003Even though Dongah had filed the appeal before the Appellate Division, Jungwoo filed a cross-appeal before the Court of Appeal on 2 November 2021. A case management conference was held on 10 November 2021 (\u201cthe 10 November CMC\u201d) for the purpose of understanding Jungwoo\u2019s reasons for doing so. There, Jungwoo\u2019s counsel submitted that Jungwoo\u2019s cross-appeal was properly made to the Court of Appeal because an application to set aside an adjudication determination under the SOPA is a case relating to administrative law. While Jungwoo took the position that Dongah should not have filed AD\/CA 112\/2021 before the Appellate Division, it declined to make an application for the transfer of AD\/CA 112\/2021 to the Court of Appeal. Following the 10 November CMC, Jungwoo\u2019s filing was accepted, and its cross-appeal assigned as CA\/CA 62\/2021.', '6\\u2003On 15 November 2021, the parties were informed by the court that pursuant to s 29E of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1969 (2020 Rev Ed) (\u201cSCJA\u201d), CA\/CA 62\/2021 had been identified for possible transfer from the Court of Appeal to the Appellate Division on the ground that it was not made in accordance with s 29C read with the Sixth Schedule of the SCJA.', '7\\u2003On 22 November 2021, Jungwoo filed another cross-appeal to the Appellate Division which was identical to its cross-appeal in CA\/CA 62\/2021. By a letter to court dated 24 November 2021, Jungwoo\u2019s counsel explained that Jungwoo had raised a \u201cjurisdictional\u201d objection in AD\/SUM 28\/2021 on the ground that the proper forum for the appeal should be the Court of Appeal and not the Appellate Division, but AD\/SUM 28\/2021 had yet to be determined by the court. As there was a \u201creal dispute as to the proper forum for the appeal\u201d and the decision of the Court of Appeal to transfer CA\/CA 62\/2021 might not be made on or before 22 November 2021, which was the deadline for Jungwoo to file an appeal, Jungwoo filed a second cross-appeal to the Appellate Division to \u201cpreserve [its] right [to] appeal\u201d to the Appellate Division.', '8\\u2003Due to this somewhat inexplicable turn of events, another case management conference was held on 26 November 2021 (\u201c26 November CMC\u201d), during which Jungwoo\u2019s counsel persisted with this course of action despite the Assistant Registrar\u2019s explanation that it was unnecessary for Jungwoo to file a second notice of appeal to the Appellate Division to preserve its right to appeal. Jungwoo\u2019s filing was subsequently accepted and assigned as AD\/CA 120\/2021.', '9\\u2003On 29 November 2021, Dongah took out the present application to strike out CA\/CA 62\/2021.'"}
{"casename":"2022_SGCA_70","fact":"'2\\u2003The facts of the present case were recounted in detail by the High Court Judge (\u201cthe Judge\u201d) in Public Prosecutor v Munusamy Ramarmurth [2021] SGHC 255 (\u201cthe Judgment\u201d). We provide a brief summary.', '3\\u2003On 26 January 2018, sometime after 11am, the appellant parked his motorcycle (\u201cthe Motorcycle\u201d) at an open-air carpark (\u201cthe Carpark\u201d) located along Harbourfront Avenue and proceeded to Harbourfront Centre, Tower 2, to take up his duties as a cleaner. At some point thereafter he opened the rear box of the Motorcycle and thereafter closed it before leaving the Carpark. Sometime after 1pm, officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (\u201cCNB\u201d) were positioned at Harbourfront Avenue. They located the Motorcycle in the Carpark and thereafter kept an eye on it. No one approached the Motorcycle while it was under observation.', '4\\u2003Several hours later, at around 4.05pm, the appellant was arrested by the CNB officers in a cleaners\u2019 room at Harbourfront Centre, Tower 2. He was then escorted to the Carpark and a search of the Motorcycle was conducted in his presence. A red plastic bag (\u201cthe Red Bag\u201d) was recovered from the rear box of the Motorcycle. Packages inside the Red Bag were analysed and found to contain not less than 57.54g of diamorphine (\u201cthe Drugs\u201d).', '5\\u2003During investigations, the appellant voluntarily gave nine statements (\u201cthe Statements\u201d) to the CNB. These included four contemporaneous statements on the day of his arrest (the 1st to 4th Statements individually; the \u201cContemporaneous Statements\u201d collectively); a cautioned statement one day later (the 5th Statement); and four long statements on 31 January and 2 February 2018 (the 6th to 9th Statements individually; the \u201cLong Statements\u201d collectively). In the Statements, the appellant alleged that he had not seen the Red Bag prior to his arrest; that he did not know what it contained; and that his involvement with a man called Saravanan, a Malaysian who could not enter Singapore, was limited to collecting money on Saravanan\u2019s behalf.', '6\\u2003The appellant was charged with possession of the Drugs for the purpose of trafficking under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the MDA. He claimed trial in the High Court. At the trial, contrary to his earlier position, he did not dispute that he had known that the Red Bag was in the rear box of the Motorcycle. Instead, he argued that he did not know that it contained the Drugs and that he did not possess it for the purpose of trafficking.', '7\\u2003In his testimony, the appellant claimed that on the day of his arrest, Saravanan had called him and had told him that a person (referred to as \u201cBoy\u201d) had placed the Red Bag in the rear box of the Motorcycle. During the conversation, Saravanan also referred to a previous incident in July 2017 (\u201cthe July 2017 Incident\u201d) in which Saravanan had asked him to store stolen handphones which were later retrieved by Boy and Saravanan. Thereafter the appellant had returned to the Carpark to unlock the rear box of the Motorcycle. When he did so, he saw the Red Bag inside the box but did not open it to check its contents. He alleges that he then closed the rear box without locking it.', '8\\u2003Thus, the appellant\u2019s defence was that he thought that the Red Bag contained stolen handphones and that Boy would retrieve them later. On the latter point, he did not assert that the Drugs were for himself. Instead, his defence was that since he thought the Red Bag would be retrieved by Boy, he did not possess it with the intention that it would be moved along any supply or distribution process, ie, he invoked the \u201cbailment\u201d defence.', '9\\u2003The Judge rejected the appellant\u2019s version of events, primarily on the basis that it never appeared in any of the Statements \u2013 he was thus unable to rebut the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA and was also found to have possessed the Drugs for the purposes of trafficking. Accordingly, he was convicted and sentenced as stated.'"}
{"casename":"2022_SGCA_71","fact":"'11\\u2003On 28 October 2011, officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (\u201cCNB\u201d) saw Suief carrying a haversack to a bus stop outside the Haw Par Villa at Pasir Panjang Road at about 11.25am. About five minutes later, Shanmugam drove a vehicle bearing Malaysian registration number JLT8467 (\u201cKenari car\u201d) to the bus stop and Suief got into the Kenari car. Shanmugam drove along Pasir Panjang Road, stopped at a hilltop car park at the National University of Singapore, before proceeding to an Esso petrol station along Pasir Panjang Road. The Kenari car left the petrol station at about 12.12pm and went along Pasir Panjang Road and West Coast Highway. It arrived and stopped at Block 405 Pandan Gardens (\u201cBlock 405\u201d) (Trial Judgment on the Couriers at [3]\u2013[5]).', '12\\u2003Suief was seen leaving the Kenari car and walking to Block 405, carrying a black plastic bag. Subsequently, CNB officers arrested both Suief (who was then outside his mother\u2019s apartment at Block 405) and Shanmugam (who was still in the Kenari car). The haversack that Suief carried when he first entered the Kenari car was found on the floor mat of the front passenger seat. It contained three black plastic bundles, two plastic bags and one bundle wrapped in newspaper. The bundles were found to contained granular substances. The black plastic bag that Suief carried when he went up Block 405 was found among some flowerpots on the staircase landing between the seventh and eighth floors. It contained three newspaper wrapped bundles containing granular substances. The granular substances in all of the drug exhibits were analysed and found to contain a total of not less than 28.50g of diamorphine (Trial Judgment on the Couriers at [6]\u2013[7]).', '13\\u2003The Couriers were charged with trafficking in diamorphine in furtherance of their common intention (Appellate Judgment on the Couriers at [10]):', '14\\u2003The charges against the Couriers related solely to the circumstances surrounding the transaction on 28 October 2011. The \u201ccommon intention\u201d stated in the charges referred to the Couriers\u2019 common intention. The \u201ccommon intention\u201d did not include the appellant in the present case and he was not mentioned in the charges against the Couriers. Our judgment in the present appeal therefore has no bearing on the findings in the earlier Appellate Judgment on the Couriers or the Trial Judgment on the Couriers.', '15\\u2003At the trial, the Couriers raised the defence of ignorance. Shanmugam claimed that he did not know that the plastic bags contained drugs and that he had no common intention to traffic in drugs with Suief. His case was that the drug transaction was carried out by Suief and coordinated by one \u201cPuni\u201d (that is, the appellant in the present case). Shanmugam claimed that he had accepted the appellant\u2019s offer to deliver the Kenari car to the appellant\u2019s friend because his friend needed it to deliver some personal documents. According to Shanmugam, when he asked the appellant about the documents, the appellant showed Shanmugam documents seemingly related to property transactions. On 28 October 2011, the appellant showed him the documents and said that they were illegal and that was why they had to be hidden behind the speakers of the Kenari car. Shanmugam was told that his job was to drive the Kenari car from Malaysia to Singapore and pass the documents to \u201cAh Boy\u201d (that is, Suief) and then wait for Suief to return the Kenari car to him. At the Esso petrol station, after buying drinks at the convenience store, he saw \u201csome black coloured bundles on the front passenger seat\u201d which he put into the haversack for Suief at Suief\u2019s request to do so. Suief then asked Shanmugam to drive to Block 405 (Trial Judgment on the Couriers at [11] and [12]).', '16\\u2003Similarly, Suief raised the defence of ignorance. He had taken a ride from an Indian man (that is, Shanmugam) and when they arrived at Block 405, Shanmugam took out a black plastic bag and passed it to Suief. He was instructed to leave it at the staircase of the sixth or seventh floor. According to Suief, he met Shanmugam on 28 October 2011 with the intention of having lunch with him. The Couriers had only met once prior to 28 October 2011 (Trial Judgment on the Couriers at [13]).', '17\\u2003Choo J in the 2014 Trial rejected the Couriers\u2019 defence of ignorance and found them guilty on their respective charges (Trial Judgment on the Couriers at [20]). Shanmugam, who was found to be only a courier and who was issued a certificate of substantive assistance, was sentenced to the mandatory life imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane. Suief, who was also found to be only a courier but who was not issued a certificate of substantive assistance, was sentenced to the mandatory death penalty (at [24]).', '18\\u2003Shanmugam\u2019s appeal against his sentence was dismissed as his sentence was the mandatory minimum of life imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane (Appellate Judgment on the Couriers at [2]). On appeal, Suief conceded that the defence of ignorance was bound to fail and instead submitted that he had no common intention with Shanmugam to traffic in all ten bundles of drugs. Rather, he only had an individual intention to traffic in three bundles of drugs which he had taken with him in the black plastic bag (at [15] and [17]\u2013[18]).', '19\\u2003This Court noted that Suief\u2019s defence on appeal was \u201cwholly inconsistent with the defence which had been proffered\u201d at the trial (which was an \u201coutright denial of knowledge that all the black plastic bags contained the drugs\u201d) (at [34]). This Court held that Suief\u2019s alternative defence was not reasonably available to him based upon the evidence at the trial and was instead a mere afterthought (at [35]\u2013[36]). Rather, the relevant evidence was \u201ccompletely contrary to this particular argument\u201d that he had only intended to traffic in three bundles of drugs [emphasis in original] (at [42]). Suief\u2019s appeal against conviction and sentence was dismissed accordingly (at [43]).', '20\\u2003The determination of the Couriers\u2019 trial and their appeal clearly did not depend on the Alleged Introductory Meeting. However, Choo J remarked that it was Shanmugam\u2019s case that the transaction on 28 October 2011 was \u201ccoordinated by one Puni\u201d (Trial Judgment on the Couriers at [11]). Choo J also found that the appellant had \u201cpreviously hidden documents in the speakers\u201d (at [17]).', '21\\u2003On appeal from the 2014 Trial, this Court noted that Shanmugam had driven the Kenari car \u201con the instructions of one Puni\u201d and that the Couriers were \u201cintroduced to each other through Puni\u201d. Before 28 October 2011, the Couriers had \u201conly met each other once at the carpark of the McDonald\u2019s outlet located at West Coast\u201d (Appellate Judgment on the Couriers at [3]). This Court also found that the appellant appeared to be using the phone number \u201c+60164978192\u201d, which was saved on Suief\u2019s phone as \u201cBoyz\u201d, to communicate with Suief on 28 October 2011. On that day, Suief had \u201cnumerous short phone conversations with Puni prior to his arrest\u201d (at [41]). Suief\u2019s evidence that he \u201cmerely had \u201ccasual talks\u201d and was only joking with Puni\u201d on that day appeared to be \u201cimplausible\u201d given that 13 phone calls were made in under two hours, with the duration of each call being relatively short. This Court instead found that Suief had been \u201ccommunicating with Puni directly for the purposes of discussing the drug deal and potentially to receive instructions from Puni in that regard\u201d (at [41]). There was no finding concerning the date on which the Couriers were introduced to each other at the McDonald\u2019s West Coast outlet carpark in the earlier judgments.', '22\\u2003In the course of investigations prior to the 2014 Trial, Shanmugam implicated the appellant as being the mastermind behind the drug transaction on 28 October 2011. On 25 February 2014, the Investigating Officer, Assistant Superintendent Xie Junhao, applied for a warrant of arrest for the appellant. The appellant was eventually arrested in Malaysia on 16 January 2016, extradited to Singapore on 21 January 2016 and arrested by CNB officers at the Woodlands Checkpoint (Judgment at [8]). The appellant\u2019s trial in the High Court started in 2018.', '23\\u2003The Prosecution\u2019s case was that the appellant was the mastermind who introduced Shanmugam to Suief on 12 October 2011 to facilitate an impending drug transaction and who directed Shanmugam to drive the Kenari car into Singapore on 28 October 2011 to meet up with Suief (Judgment at [14]). The appellant\u2019s case was that he \u201cdid not even know [the Couriers]\u201d and thus could not have coordinated the drug transaction that took place on 28 October 2011 (Judgment at [16] and [19]). The appellant claimed that he entered Singapore on 11 and 12 October 2011 to collect payments for debts due to a Malaysian registered moneylending company called \u201cPinjaman Berlesen Wang\u201d. He asserted that he did not go to the McDonald\u2019s West Coast outlet on 12 October 2011 because he was pre-occupied with such debt collection (at [18]).', '24\\u2003The Judge rejected the appellant\u2019s case. Both Couriers had provided detailed and cogent accounts of their respective relationships with the appellant. The Judge concluded that the appellant had a relationship with each of the Couriers but the Couriers did not have any relationship with each other prior to the appellant\u2019s personal introduction on 12 October 2011. The Alleged Introductory Meeting led to the Couriers\u2019 second meeting with each other 16 days later on 28 October 2011 when they were arrested for drug trafficking activities. The appellant asserted that he had no connection to them but was unable to explain how the Couriers knew personal details about him (Judgment at [43]). The Judge held that the appellant had proved on a balance of probabilities that he was in Singapore on 12 October 2011 to collect debt payments but that did not assist him to prove that he was not present at the Alleged Introductory Meeting. This was because the appellant had \u201cample time on 12 October 2011 to meet the Couriers and collect the debt moneys\u201d (at [108]\u2013[109]).', '25\\u2003The ICA travel movement records showed that both the appellant and Shanmugam were in Singapore on 12 October 2011. The appellant entered Singapore at 7.04am and left at 12.19pm (5 hours and 15 minutes) while Shanmugam entered Singapore 20 minutes later at 7.24am and left at 9.36am (2 hours and 12 minutes) (Judgment at [87] and [109]). The Judge reasoned that, even assuming that the appellant left the McDonald\u2019s West Coast outlet only after Shanmugam had left Singapore at 9.36am that day, the appellant would have about 2 hours and 43 minutes to travel to Ang Mo Kio (where he collected the debt payments) and then to the Woodlands Checkpoint. The Judge added that if he assumed that the appellant and Shanmugam left the McDonald\u2019s West Coast outlet at about the same time and Shanmugam needed about 36 minutes to travel to the Woodlands Checkpoint, both of them would have left the McDonald\u2019s West Coast outlet at around 9am. On this assumption, the appellant would have some 3 hours and 19 minutes to collect the debt payments and to travel to the Woodlands Checkpoint. Factoring in the possibility of adverse traffic conditions, the entire journey by car should take no longer than 2 hours. Even after taking into consideration the defence witnesses\u2019 evidence about the approximate timing of the various events that took place that morning, the Judge was of the view that there would have been ample time for the appellant to be at the Alleged Introductory Meeting at the McDonald\u2019s West Coast outlet during the entire period that Shanmugam was there and to collect the debt payments thereafter (Judgment at [109]).', '26\\u2003The Judge believed that when the appellant entered Singapore on 12 October 2011 for his work assignment to collect the debt payments, it would be very convenient to use that opportunity to introduce Shanmugam to Suief. This was because if the appellant had travelled to Singapore just to introduce the Couriers to each other, it \u201cwould be a complete waste of time, effort and petrol\u201d (at [110]).', '27\\u2003The Judge also found (Judgment at [89]) that the Couriers gave \u201cconsistent accounts of the material aspects\u201d of the Alleged Introductory Meeting:', '(a)\\u2003the timing of the meeting (being \u201c2 to 3 weeks\u201d prior to Deepavali which fell on 26 October 2011 according to Suief and \u201cabout 3 weeks before the arrest\u201d which occurred on 28 October 2011 according to Shanmugam) and the location at the McDonald\u2019s West Coast outlet;', '(b)\\u2003the purpose of the meeting (which was to introduce the Couriers to each other because Shanmugam would be taking over the task of driving the Kenari car from the previous driver, the appellant\u2019s brother Mathan, to send diamorphine into Singapore); and', '(c)\\u2003the manner in which the introduction took place (specifically, that Shanmugam arrived later and was driving the Kenari car and the Couriers introduced themselves).', '28\\u2003In contrast, the Judge considered the inconsistencies in the Couriers\u2019 testimonies \u201cimmaterial\u201d and did \u201cnot go to the heart of the matter\u201d (Judgment at [90]). In his view, the most obvious inconsistencies were:', '(a)\\u2003whether Shanmugam had brought his foster mother and foster daughter to the Alleged Introductory Meeting;', '(b)\\u2003whether Suief took the Kenari car for 45 minutes before returning it after the Alleged Introductory Meeting; and', '(c)\\u2003whether the appellant came into Singapore on a motorcycle or in a car.', 'The Judge concluded on the totality of the evidence that the Couriers\u2019 relationship began with the Alleged Introductory Meeting on 12 October 2011 which was for the purpose of linking up the Couriers to form the courier chain for the appellant (at [112]).', '29\\u2003Apart from the findings in relation to the circumstances on 12 October 2011, the Judge made other findings in relation to the events that took place on 27 and 28 October 2011. Although such findings gave a fuller picture of the events leading up to the drug transaction on 28 October 2011 involving the Couriers, they were not material to the issue squarely before us, which was whether the appellant was at the Alleged Introductory Meeting of 12 October 2011.', '30\\u2003The Judge found that the Prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was complicit in the drug transaction on 28 October 2011 by: (a) recruiting Shanmugam and Suief to be his drug couriers; (b) introducing the Couriers to each other on 12 October 2011 for the purpose of facilitating an impending drug transaction; (c) providing the Kenari car containing the diamorphine to Shanmugam on 27 October 2011; and (d) coordinating the transport and delivery of the diamorphine on 28 October 2011 by giving instructions to the Couriers. Accordingly, the Judge convicted the appellant on the Charge (Judgment at [163]). As the appellant was found not to be a courier and he did not receive a certificate of substantive assistance, the Judge sentenced him to the mandatory death penalty.', '31\\u2003On 22 May 2020, the appellant appealed against the Judge\u2019s decision in respect of both conviction and sentence. 4', 'The evidence as to the date and time of the Alleged Introductory Meeting', '32\\u2003As the matter stood at that stage of the proceedings, there were discrepancies in the evidence regarding the date and the time of the Alleged Introductory Meeting. In respect of the date of the Alleged Introductory Meeting, the Couriers\u2019 evidence was inconsistent individually (when each was asked at different points in time) and when their evidence was compared with each other\u2019s. The table below shows their various accounts: 5', '', '33\\u2003The Couriers\u2019 evidence as to the time that the Alleged Introductory Meeting took place was also inconsistent: 19', '', '34\\u2003As mentioned earlier, before the substantive hearing of CCA 12, the appellant filed two criminal motions to adduce the New Evidence for the appeal. On 10 May 2021, we heard both applications and allowed the New Evidence to be adduced for the appeal. To reiterate, the New Evidence related to: (a) the Couriers\u2019 investigation statements given in 2011; (b) a call trace report for Suief\u2019s mobile phone 98944870; and (c) the ICA\u2019s travel movement records of Shanmugam, Shanmugam\u2019s foster mother, Shanmugam\u2019s foster daughter and Mathan for the material period.', '35\\u2003On 30 June 2021, we remitted the matter to the Judge to consider: (a) whether his finding that the Alleged Introductory Meeting took place (in the morning of 12 October 2011) was affected by the New Evidence; and (b) if so, whether that affected the appellant\u2019s conviction. We also directed that, in addressing these questions, the Judge was free to decide what evidence he wished to reconsider (if any). By that time, it was abundantly clear to both parties that the focus of the inquiry was whether the Alleged Introductory Meeting really took place in the morning of 12 October 2011. This was because the appellant and Shanmugam were in Singapore for only the specified periods of time according to the ICA\u2019s travel movement records and, in contrast, the Couriers\u2019 2011 investigation statements (given soon after the Alleged Introductory Meeting and very soon after their subsequent arrest) all pointed to the Alleged Introductory Meeting having taken place sometime in the afternoon or in the evening. It can be seen from the tables above that such timing was reinforced by the Couriers\u2019 testimony during the 2014 Trial and the 2018 Trial.', '36\\u2003A pre-trial conference (\u201cPTC\u201d) was called on 9 July 2021. At that PTC, counsel for the appellant proposed that the Judge could decide whether to assess the New Evidence on the face of the documents or whether there was a need to recall the witnesses. The Prosecution stated that the Judge could decide the matters in the remitted questions after looking at the documents comprising the New Evidence and the documents submitted in CCA 12. At that time, both Couriers were in custody and were available to testify if the need arose. Eventually, counsel for the appellant took the view that \u201cthe witnesses need not be called subject to Judge\u2019s consideration\u201d. The Prosecution agreed with this position.', '37\\u2003At the remittal hearing before the Judge on 30 July 2021, the parties agreed that they need not call any witnesses and would merely make submissions on the available evidence. Accordingly, the Couriers were not called to give further testimony. The Judge therefore merely heard further submissions by the parties, with particular focus on whether the Prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt that the Alleged Introductory Meeting took place in the morning of 12 October 2011. The appellant emphasised that 12 October 2011 was the only \u201coverlapping\u201d date on which both the appellant and Shanmugam were in Singapore. 29', 'The Prosecution accepted that \u201cthe reason why the 12th October was chosen was because it\u2019s objective facts that all three of them were there at the same time\u201d. 30', '38\\u2003For the remittal hearing, the parties tendered substantially the same submissions that they had made to this Court for the appeal notwithstanding that the questions posed by this Court to the Judge were specific and limited in scope. The Judge found that the appellant\u2019s arguments did not raise a reasonable doubt as to whether the Alleged Introductory Meeting took place on 12 October 2011. The Judge\u2019s earlier finding about the Alleged Introductory Meeting was therefore unaffected by the New Evidence and it followed that the appellant\u2019s conviction was also unaffected (Remittal Judgment at [3], [11] and [48]).', '39\\u2003The Judge rejected the appellant\u2019s submissions that the newly adduced 2011 statements from the Couriers were \u201cextremely critical\u201d and dispositive [emphasis in original]. 31', 'The appellant had argued that these statements were recorded within three weeks of the Alleged Introductory Meeting and that the time of that meeting would have been fresh in the Couriers\u2019 minds then. The appellant submitted there was no reason for the Couriers to admit to the Alleged Introductory Meeting but lie about its timing. However, the Judge was of the view that these statements suffered from the same issues of credibility that he had attributed to the Couriers\u2019 evidence given at the Couriers\u2019 2014 Trial. This was because in 2011 and 2014, the Couriers would have been attempting to avoid incriminating themselves and their statements \u201cmust be taken with the proverbial pinch of salt\u201d. Even if the 2011 statements were taken at face value, the Judge noted that there was a considerable difference between Shanmugam\u2019s evidence and Suief\u2019s evidence in relation to the time of day of the Alleged Introductory Meeting (Remittal Judgment at [15]\u2013[17]). \u201cIf the time of the Alleged Introductory Meeting were to be so fresh in their minds\u201d, the Judge would have expected their evidence to be much more similar. Moreover, neither Courier was individually consistent about the time of that meeting in their respective evidence from their 2011 statements up to the 2018 Trial. Accordingly, the Judge did not find the Couriers\u2019 evidence in relation to the timing of that meeting to be reliable.', '40\\u2003However, the Judge found that the Couriers were \u201centirely consistent and reliable\u201d in their evidence at the 2018 Trial of a meeting sometime in October 2011 at the West Coast McDonald\u2019s outlet carpark where the appellant was present and personally introduced Shanmugam to Suief. It was not surprising to the Judge \u201cthat the Couriers might have correctly remembered these facts while misremembering the time of the Alleged Introductory Meeting\u201d. Based on the ICA travel movement records of the appellant and Shanmugam, \u201cthe only possible time and date for that meeting was the morning of 12 October 2011\u201d (Remittal Judgment at [18]). The Judge rejected the appellant\u2019s argument that any introductory meeting between the Couriers was more likely to have taken place sometime between 24 and 25 October 2011 because the appellant was not present in Singapore then and so could not have been part of any such meeting (at [29]).', '41\\u2003The Judge also rejected the appellant\u2019s argument that there was simply not enough time for the Alleged Introductory Meeting and the events related to it to have taken place between 7.24am and 9.36am on 12 October 2011 (Remittal Judgment at [44]). These events would include Shanmugam having to drive from the Woodlands Checkpoint to the West Coast McDonald\u2019s outlet car park, the period of about 45 minutes when Suief was said to have driven the Kenari car away (which Suief denied) and Shanmugam then having to drive the same car back to the Woodlands Checkpoint during peak hour traffic. We reiterate that, as seen from the ICA travel movement records, the only window of time when both the appellant and Shanmugam were in Singapore was between 7.24am and 9.36am on 12 October 2011 because Shanmugam was recorded as having entered Singapore at 7.24am and having left Singapore by 9.36am that morning. These 2 hours and 12 minutes were therefore the only window of time for the Alleged Introductory Meeting involving the appellant, Shanmugam and Suief to have taken place.', '42\\u2003In the Judge\u2019s view, it would be a mistake to focus too much on how tightly the various events had to fit into the said window of time in the morning of 12 October 2011. The Judge stated that the \u201cbetter way to think about this would be from Shanmugam\u2019s perspective: he came to Singapore specifically for this meeting and had no reason to tarry\u201d. He would therefore have taken \u201cprecisely and only as much time as he needed at each step before making a speedy departure\u201d. The Judge reiterated his earlier decision where he considered the possibility that Shanmugam might have been telling the truth about Suief taking the Kenari car away for about 45 minutes. He explained that he did not make a finding on whether this happened because it was not necessary for the purposes of the Charge against the appellant. He opined that even if this event did take place, it was possible that Shanmugam had overestimated the period of time involved (Remittal Judgment at [44]\u2013[46]). He therefore concluded that the appellant did not raise a reasonable doubt as to whether the Alleged Introductory Meeting took place on 12 October 2011 (Remittal Judgment at [47] and [48]).'"}

The EMSU is a 24-hour service provided by Town Councils \nto attend to residents\u2019 maintenance and emergency requests. \n23 The Contracts comprise two contracts for MA services and two contracts \nfor EMSU services:  \n(a) a contract for the provision of MA and project management \nservices from 15 July 2011 to 14 July 2012 (the \u201cFirst MA Contract\u201d);\n(b) a contract for the provision of MA and project management \nservices from 15 July 2012 to 14 July 2015 (the \u201cSecond MA Contract\u201d);\n(c) a contract for the provision of EMSU services from 1 October \n2011 to 30 June 2012 (the \u201cFirst EMSU Contract\u201d); and \n(d) a contract for the provision of EMSU services from 1 July 2012 \nto 30 June 2015 (the \u201cSecond EMSU Contract\u201d). \n24 In addition to the Contracts, Mr Loh, trading as FMSI, also provided \nEMSU services to HTC (and subsequently AHTC) under a contract that was in \nVersion No 1: 09 Nov 2022 (12:09 hrs)\nHow Weng Fan v Sengkang Town Council[2022] SGCA 72\n20place from 15 October 2007 to 14 October 2014 (the \u201cFMSI EMSU Contract\u201d). \nThe FMSI EMSU Contract was entered into by HTC prior to the 2011 GE, and \nwas subsequently assigned to AHTC following the amalgamation of HTC and \nATC (see [ 10] above). Thereafter, services were rendered pursuant to the FMSI \nEMSU Contract for residents of the Hougang precinct, which was under the \nmanagement of AHTC.\n25 Prior to the Contracts, MA and EMSU services for ATC (and briefly for \nAHTC after the 2011 GE) were provided by CPG Facilities Management Pte \nLtd (\u201cCPG\u201d) and EM Services Pte Ltd (\u201cEM Services\u201d). The details of these \ncontracts were as follows:\n(a) CPG provided MA services to ATC (or AHTC, as the case may \nbe) under a contract dated 8 June 2010 covering the period that \ncommenced on 1 August 2010 and that was, at the material time, due to \nexpire on 31 July 2013, with an option exercisable at the sole discretion \nof AHTC to extend the contract for a further period of three years (the \n\u201cCPG MA Contract\u201d). \n(b) CPG also provided EMSU services to ATC (or AHTC, as the \ncase may be), with the exception of the Kaki Bukit precinct and the \nestates covered by the FMSI EMSU Contract. The EMSU services for \nthe Kaki Bukit precinct were provided by EM Services under a separate \ncontract. Both CPG\u2019s and EM Services\u2019 contracts for the EMSU services \nwere due to expire on 30 September 2011.  \n26 These contracts form an important backdrop to AHTC\u2019s subsequent \ndecision to award the contracts for the provision of MA and EMSU services to \nFMSS. Of particular note here is Mr Jeffrey Chua, who was CPG\u2019s Managing \nDirector and its key representative dealing with AHTC at the material time. Mr \nVersion No 1: 09 Nov 2022 (12:09 hrs)\nHow Weng Fan v Sengkang Town Council[2022] SGCA 72\n21Jeffrey Chua had previously served as ATC\u2019s Secretary and General Manager. \nAfter the 2011 GE, he served as AHTC\u2019s General Manager from May 2011 to \nAugust 2011, and as AHTC\u2019s Secretary from June 2011 to July 2011. \nThe waiver of tender for the first contract for MA services\n27 The first act sought to be impugned by the Plaintiffs concerns AHTC\u2019s \nwaiver of the requirement to call tenders for the first contracts for the provision \nof MA and EMSU services to AHTC, resulting in the award of the First MA \nContract and the First EMSU Contract to FMSS. The tender for the contract for \nMA services was waived under the following circumstances.\n28 On 9 May 2011, two days after the 2011 GE, the Ministry of National \nDevelopment (\u201cMND\u201d) wrote to all newly elected MPs, informing them that \nthe TCA provided that the \u201creconstituted Town Councils [would] assume \nresponsibility for the new areas under their charge with effect from 1 August \n2011\u201d. For present purposes, this meant that the soon-to-be constituted, WP-led \nAHTC had to be operational by 1 August 2011. On the same day, Mr Low e-\nmailed Ms Lim, Mr Singh, Mr Faisal and Mr Chen (and copying Mr Yaw and \nMs How), following a discussion they had the same morning, setting out their \nplans to merge HTC with ATC; to \u201cappoint [a] managing agent to manage the \ntown instead of self management\u201d; and noting that Ms Lim had been chosen \namong the elected members to be Chairman of AHTC (the \u201c9 May 2011 E-\nmail\u201d). \n29 On 13 May 2011, one \u201cT T Tan\u201d, who claimed to have some access to \nCPG\u2019s plans with respect to the management of the reconstituted Town Council, \nwrote to Mr Low, conveying his belief that CPG allegedly intended to cease \nproviding to the reconstituted Town Council the services which it had until then \nbeen providing to ATC. \nVersion No 1: 09 Nov 2022 (12:09 hrs)\nHow Weng Fan v Sengkang Town Council[2022] SGCA 72\n2230 On 15 May 2011, Mr Loh incorporated FMSS. On 27 May 2011, AHTC \nwas gazetted (see [ 10] above). \n31 On 30 May 2011, an informal meeting took place, at which the elected \nmembers of AHTC, Ms How, and representatives from CPG comprising \nMr Jeffrey Chua, then-Secretary of ATC, his personal assistant Ms Pan \nWanjing, and the Deputy General Manager of ATC, Mr Seng Joo How, were \npresent (the \u201c30 May 2011 Meeting\u201d). This was a critical meeting and it is \nundisputed that at this meeting, the CPG representatives orally confirmed that \nCPG did not wish to serve as MA for AHTC and sought to be released from the \nCPG MA Contract. This was in advance of the contractual expiry date of 31 \nJuly 2013 under the CPG MA Contract (see [25 25(a)] above). The Judge found \nthat the correspondence from 9 May 2011 to 30 May 2011 between the Town \nCouncillors and Ms How showed that the Town Councillors had decided early \non to replace CPG with FMSS as the MA for AHTC, even though CPG only \nformally communicated its withdrawal from the CPG MA Contract at the 30 \nMay 2011 Meeting. We will examine the correspondence in detail below. \n32 On 2 June 2011, Ms Lim, Mr Low and Mr Faisal met Mr Loh. Mr Loh \nmade a presentation, on behalf of FMSS, relating to the provision of MA and \nEMSU services to AHTC. \n33 The first AHTC meeting was held on 9 June 2011 (the \u201cFirst Town \nCouncil Meeting\u201d). It was attended by all the elected members of AHTC, along \nwith Ms How, Mr Chua, Mr Foo and several representatives from CPG, \nincluding Mr Jeffrey Chua. The meeting minutes recorded the following: \nVersion No 1: 09 Nov 2022 (12:09 hrs)\nHow Weng Fan v Sengkang Town Council[2022] SGCA 72\n23(a) In respect of MA services, Mr Jeffrey Chua reported that CPG \nwould facilitate a handover by 1 August 2011 and the parties would sign \na deed of mutual release and termination on the same date. \n(b) In respect of EMSU services, Mr Jeffrey Chua informed that \nCPG would provide the services for AHTC up to the end of the contract \non 30 September 2011. For the Kaki Bukit precinct, EM Services would \ncontinue to provide the services until 30 September 2011.\n34 On 15 June 2011, Mr Loh, in his capacity as Managing Director of \nFMSS, wrote to Ms Lim attaching a draft letter of intent for the appointment of \nFMSS as the MA for AHTC (the \u201cLOI\u201d). The LOI stated that:\n(a) FMSS would \u201ctake-over the management of the former [ATC] \non 15 July 2011 at the prevailing [MA\u2019s] fees and fees structure as per \nthe existing [MA] contract between [ATC] and [CPG] made on 8 June \n2010\u201d.\n(b) FMSS would also \u201ctake-over all the existing staff of the former \n[HTC] at their existing salary and terms of appointment on 15 [July] \n2011 for preparation of takeover\u201d. \n(c) FMSS\u2019s \u201cscope of work for [AHTC] shall follow the \nspecifications stipulated under the [MA\u2019s] contract of the former \n[ATC]\u201d.\n(d) FMSS\u2019s \u201cappointment shall be for a period of one year with \neffect from 15 July 2011 to enable the Town Council to call for a tender \nof the [MA] contract\u201d. \nVersion No 1: 09 Nov 2022 (12:09 hrs)\nHow Weng Fan v Sengkang Town Council[2022] SGCA 72\n2435 The terms in the LOI broadly tracked the proposed terms that were \ncanvassed in the course of Mr Loh\u2019s presentation on 2 June 2011 (see [ 32] \nabove). On 6 July 2011, Ms Lim e-mailed the rest of the elected members, \nattaching a copy of the LOI and intimating her intention to sign the same. \n36 The LOI was signed on behalf of AHTC by Ms Lim on 8 July 2011 and \nMr Yaw on 18 July 2011. This was the basis of the First MA Contract. On \n3 August 2011, the day before the rescheduled second AHTC meeting (the \n\u201cSecond Town Council Meeting\u201d), Ms Lim forwarded to Mr Low and Mr Yaw \na draft report and recommendation to be presented at the meeting (the \u201cMA \nAppointment Report\u201d). The MA Appointment Report sought AHTC\u2019s approval \n(a) to waive the calling of a tender for MA services from 15 July 2011 to 14 July \n2012 in view of the urgent need to secure the services and the manifest necessity \nto do so in the public interest, and (b) to appoint FMSS as the MA for AHTC \nfrom 15 July 2011 to 14 July 2012. Ms Lim also copied Mr Loh and Ms How \nin that e-mail and sought their \u201ccomments on whether it will pass the auditors\u2019 \neyes \u2013 esp re waiver of tender\u201d. Both Mr Yaw and Mr Low responded, \ncommenting on the need to disclose the fact that Ms How and Mr Loh were \nmarried. \n37 The Second Town Council Meeting was held on 4 August 2011. All the \nelected members, save for Mr Faisal, were present as were Mr Foo, Ms How \nand Mr Loh. Ms How and Mr Loh were present as representatives of FMSS. At \nthis meeting, Mr Loh made a presentation on behalf of FMSS, as to its proposal \nfor the provision of MA services to AHTC. After the presentation, Mr Loh and \nMs How were excused from the meeting to facilitate a discussion amongst the \nmembers of AHTC. The minutes recorded the following:\nVersion No 1: 09 Nov 2022 (12:09 hrs)\nHow Weng Fan v Sengkang Town Council[2022] SGCA 72\n25(a) AHTC\u2019s members noted that CPG \u201chad indicated their desire to \nbe released from the agreement as soon as practicable\u201d. They further \nnoted that, \u201c[g]iven the tight time frame and urgency, there was no time \nto call any tender for [MA] services which would take several weeks \naway from critical preparation time\u201d, so that \u201c[i]t was in the public \ninterest that the calling of a tender be waived\u201d [emphasis added]. \n(b) Ms Lim had consulted the elected members and signed the LOI \nearlier in June 2011 \u201cto facilitate preparation works\u201d. \n(c) The \u201cCouncil was then requested to waive the calling of a tender \nfor [MA] services and to make the official appointment of [FMSS] for a \none year period commencing 15 July 2011, after which a tender would \nbe called\u201d. \n(d) Ms Lim informed that she had appointed Mr Loh as Secretary of \nAHTC with effect from 1 August 2011 and sought AHTC\u2019s ratification \nof this appointment.\n(e) After this discussion, Mr Loh and Ms How were invited back \ninto the meeting and were informed of AHTC\u2019s decision to award the \nFirst MA Contract to FMSS as well as to waive the calling of a tender \nfor the MA services for a period of one year.\n(f) Mr Loh declared to the meeting that he was the Managing \nDirector of FMSS and that Ms How was a Director\/General Manager of \nFMSS. The meeting \u201cnoted the \u2026 declaration of interest\u201d and \u201cagreed \nto ratify the appointment of Mr Danny Loh as the Secretary\u201d. Mr Loh \nthus took over this position from Mr Jeffrey Chua. Ms How, who had \nVersion No 1: 09 Nov 2022 (12:09 hrs)\nHow Weng Fan v Sengkang Town Council[2022] SGCA 72\n26already been appointed as Deputy Secretary of AHTC (with effect from \n8 June 2011), remained in the same appointment.\n38 On 5 August 2011, AHTC released a media statement announcing the \nappointment of FMSS as the MA as well as AHTC\u2019s decision to waive the \ntender for the initial period (the \u201cMedia Statement\u201d). The decision not to call a \ntender for MA services was explained on the basis of the \u201curgency of the \ntimelines \u2026, and the overriding concern that Town Council services should not \nbe disrupted to the detriment\u201d of the residents [emphasis added], and that there \nwas \u201cinsufficient time\u201d to do so. The Media Statement also stated that \u201c[n]o \nWorkers\u2019 Party member has any interest in FMSS\u201d, and that \u201cAHTC [did] not \nincur additional MA fees from appointing FMSS as FMSS has agreed to assume \nthe scope of works and pricing of the former MA [for ATC]\u201d.\n39 On 11 August 2011, AHTC and CPG entered into a deed of mutual \nrelease with effect from 1 August 2011, which stated that \u201cboth parties [were] \ndesirous to be released and discharged from the further performance\u201d of the \nCPG MA Contract and that \u201cthey ha[d] mutually agreed to release and discharge \neach other\u201d from further performance of the same [emphasis added]. At this \npoint in time, CPG was still the contractor for the provision of EMSU services \nto AHTC (with the exception of the Kaki Bukit precinct (see [ 33(b)] above)), as \nthe existing contract was only due to expire on 30 September 2011.  \nThe waiver of tender for the first contract for EMSU services\n40 On 26 August 2011, Ms How, as General Manager of AHTC, wrote to:\n(a) Mr Jeffrey Chua to request an extension of CPG\u2019s existing \ncontract to provide EMSU services to AHTC that was set to expire on \nVersion No 1: 09 Nov 2022 (12:09 hrs)\nHow Weng Fan v Sengkang Town Council[2022] SGCA 72\n2730 September 2011 \u201cfor another 6 months for the period 1 October 2011 \nto 31 March 2012 on the same terms and conditions\u201d; and \n(b) EM Services, the provider of EMSU services for the Kaki Bukit \nprecinct (see [ 25(b)] above), seeking an extension of the contract for \nprovision of EMSU services for the same period up to 31 March 2012. \nOn 7 September 2011, EM Services declined the request and indicated \nthat the contract would therefore end on 30 September 2011. \n41 On 8 September 2011, the third AHTC meeting was held (the \u201cThird \nTown Council Meeting\u201d) with all the Town Councillors, except Mr Singh, \npresent. Mr Loh and Ms How were also in attendance as representatives of \nFMSS, along with Mr Koh and Mr Chng. At the meeting, FMSS reported that \nthe incumbent EMSU service providers, CPG and EM Services, had contracts \nthat would be expiring on 30 September 2011 (see [ 25(b)] above). The minutes \nof the meeting recorded the following:\n(a) CPG \u201chad indicated interest to renew for a further period of 6 \nmonths\u201d but had yet to confirm officially \u201cin writing on the proposed \nextension despite several reminders\u201d. EM Services was not agreeable to \nthe proposed extension. \n(b) The meeting noted \u201cthe lack of EMSU service providers in the \nmarket that would be willing to provide their services to [AHTC]\u201d and \nthat they therefore needed to consider FMSS\u2019s proposal to also \u201cprovide \nthe EMSU services in case [CPG] decided not to extend\u201d [emphasis \nadded].\n(c) In view of the short time frame and anticipating difficulties with \nsecuring the continuation of the incumbent EMSU service providers, the \nVersion No 1: 09 Nov 2022 (12:09 hrs)\nHow Weng Fan v Sengkang Town Council[2022] SGCA 72\n28meeting thus decided to appoint a committee comprising Ms Lim, \nMr Chen, Mr Faisal and Mr Anthony Teo (the \u201cEMSU Committee\u201d) as \nrequired under r 76(4) of the TCFR to enable AHTC to consider a \nproposal from FMSS.\n42 On 14 September 2011, following a telephone conversation on the same \nmorning, Mr Jeffrey Chua, in response to Ms How\u2019s e-mail (see [ 40(a)] above), \nconfirmed that CPG was not willing to extend the contract beyond its expiry on \n30 September 2011. He stated in that correspondence that it would \u201cnot be \nappropriate for [them] to continue providing the EMSU services to your Town \nCouncil when the current extended contract ends on 30 Sept 2011\u201d [emphasis \nadded] and informed Ms How that AHTC \u201cmay wish to explore other avenues \nto render these services to [its] residents\u201d.\n43 On 16 September 2011, Ms Lim conveyed these developments to the \nother elected members of AHTC and stated her belief that CPG \u201cha[d] been \n\u2018spoken to\u2019 about not helping [them] and ha[d] made a business decision\u201d. Thus, \nMs Lim stated that they \u201cmust make immediate provision to have continuity of \nEMSU services beyond 30 Sep for all Divs in Aljunied GRC\u201d [emphasis added].\n44 The first meeting of the EMSU Committee, formed at the Third Town \nCouncil Meeting (see [41 41(c)] above), was held on 18 September 2011 (the \n\u201cEMSU Meeting\u201d). \n(a) At that meeting, the EMSU Committee compared the EMSU \ncontracts of some of the existing providers of EMSU services in the \nmarket, which included CPG and EM Services. \n(b) The EMSU Committee also considered that there were some \nadvantages in awarding the MA contract and the EMSU contract at the \nVersion No 1: 09 Nov 2022 (12:09 hrs)\nHow Weng Fan v Sengkang Town Council[2022] SGCA 72\n29same time and for the same period, such as \u201chaving a clean decision and \nnot feeling obliged to award the MA contract to the existing EMSU \ncontractor\u201d. \n(c) The EMSU Committee determined that it was necessary to come \nto an interim solution. It therefore recommended that the EMSU contract \nbe awarded to FMSS for an initial period of nine months from 1 October \n2011 to 30 June 2012. In the EMSU Committee\u2019s view, tenders for the \nsubsequent MA and EMSU contracts could then subsequently \u201cbe called \nat about the same time\u201d. \n(d) As the existing EMSU contracts were due to expire on \n30 September 2011, Ms Lim stated that it would be imperative for \nAHTC to \u201cmake certain decisions by email circulation now, as our next \nAHTC meeting is only on 13 Oct which is too late\u201d.\n45 Accordingly, Ms Lim e-mailed all the elected and appointed members \nof AHTC (including the Town Councillors) on the same day stating that both \nCPG and EM Services had confirmed that they were unwilling to extend their \nrespective contracts for EMSU services beyond 30 September 2011. Ms Lim \ndescribed CPG\u2019s decision on 14 September 2011 to reject AHTC\u2019s request as a \n\u201csurprise\u201d and one that was \u201ccontrary to the verbal agreement that they were \nwilling to extend for 6 months till March 2012\u201d (see [ 41(a)] above). She further \nstated that as EMSU was a critical service for the residents, a waiver of tender \nfor EMSU services was required by reason of the urgency. She sought AHTC\u2019s \napproval on two matters: (a) first, to waive the tender for EMSU services from \n1 October 2011 to 30 June 2012; and (b) second, to award the contract for \nEMSU services to FMSS for the same period, following which an open tender \nwould be called. This was unanimously approved by the Town Councillors by \nVersion No 1: 09 Nov 2022 (12:09 hrs)\nHow Weng Fan v Sengkang Town Council[2022] SGCA 72\n30e-mail circulation. The First EMSU Contract was consequently awarded to \nFMSS. \nAward of the Second MA Contract and the Second EMSU Contract\n46 The Second MA Contract and the Second EMSU Contract were awarded \npursuant to open tenders, but the Plaintiffs nevertheless challenge the awards of \nthese contracts arising from tenders for which FMSS was the sole bidder. The \ncircumstances surrounding the award of these contracts were as follows.\n47 Another AHTC meeting was held on 8 March 2012. By this time, \nFMSS\u2019s provision of services under the First MA Contract and the First EMSU \nContract was due to expire within a few months on 14 July 2012 and 30 June \n2012 respectively. Open tenders for the provision of these services were to be \ncalled soon. The meeting decided to appoint a committee to vet and approve the \ndocuments for both the MA and EMSU tenders. This committee comprised the \nsame members making up the Tenders Committee referred to above at [ 15] and \nso for ease of reference, we shall also refer to it also as the Tenders Committee. \n48 The next AHTC meeting was held on 12 April 2012. The meeting noted \nthat the Tenders Committee had since met twice and vetted the tender \ndocuments and specifications adopted by ATC previously for the appointment \nof MA and EMSU services. These tender documents would be used for the \ncalling of tenders the next day. The minutes of the meeting also noted that the \nrepresentatives of FMSS, including Mr Loh and Ms How, had been excused \nfrom the meeting during the deliberation on matters pertaining to the tenders. \nAfter they were invited back to the meeting, they were informed that AHTC \nwould call for quotations to appoint a firm to audit the process of appointment \nof the MA.\nVersion No 1: 09 Nov 2022 (12:09 hrs)\nHow Weng Fan v Sengkang Town Council[2022] SGCA 72\n3149 On 13 April 2012, a tender notice for the provision of MA and EMSU \nservices to AHTC, each for a term of three years, was published in The Straits \nTimes. The notice stated that both tenders would close on 4 May 2012. \n50 By the time the tenders closed on 4 May 2012, FMSS had submitted a \nbid for both contracts to provide MA services and EMSU services. In respect of \nthe contract for MA services, three sets of tender documents had been collected \n(by FMSS, EM Services and CBM Pte Ltd) but only FMSS had submitted a \ntender. In respect of the contract for EMSU services, two sets of tender \ndocuments had been collected but only FMSS had submitted a tender. \n51 The next AHTC meeting was held on 10 May 2012. The meeting \nminutes recorded that by the time of the tender deadline, FMSS had submitted \nthe sole bid for provision of MA and EMSU services to AHTC. In addition, the \nminutes of the meeting recorded that the Tenders Committee had \u201cappointed \nM\/s RSM Ethos at [a fee of] $6,000 as the firm to audit the process of the \nappointment of the Managing Agent\u201d. \n52 On 19 June 2012, Ms Lim e-mailed Ms How and Mr Loh, as FMSS\u2019s \nrepresentatives, asking that they attend a meeting scheduled for 21 June 2012 \nwith the Tenders Committee and be prepared to address questions that the \nTenders Committee was likely to raise as to the difference between the pricing \nunder the initial contracts and the pricing proposed in their tender. On the same \nday, Mr Loh replied to Ms Lim, revising his calculations on FMSS\u2019s rates. The \nrevised calculations showed FMSS\u2019s proposed rates for 2012 to have increased \nfrom $5.96 per equivalent dwelling unit (\u201cEDU\u201d) in 2010 to $7.00 per EDU in \n2012, representing a 17.28% increase in MA fees. \nVersion No 1: 09 Nov 2022 (12:09 hrs)\nHow Weng Fan v Sengkang Town Council[2022] SGCA 72\n3253 On 21 June 2012, the Tenders Committee convened a meeting to \nevaluate FMSS\u2019s tenders for the provision of MA and EMSU services to AHTC. \nThe Tenders Committee noted that FMSS was the sole tenderer for both sets of \nservices: \n(a) In respect of the tender for MA services, the Tenders Committee \nobserved that compared with the prices tendered in 2010 by CPG, as the \nformer MA for ATC, the rates tendered by FMSS \u201crepresented an \nincrease of 17.3% when averaged out over the respective 3-year contract \nperiods\u201d and \u201cexpressed concern about the marked increase and its \nimpact on the AHTC\u201d. The Tenders Committee thus asked FMSS for \njustification. In response, Mr Loh showed presentation slides to explain \nFMSS\u2019s pricing strategy and pointed to other costs which FMSS had to \nbear, including (i) lift testing fees; (ii) additional number of offices \nrequiring more administrative staff; (iii) additional staffing for \ntechnicians and the contracts department; and (iv) that as FMSS\u2019s \nbusiness was focused on town management for AHTC, it did not have \nthe same economies of scale as others who may have several towns to \nmanage or have other business arms. Ms How also added that provision \nof information technology maintenance services was done by FMSS in-\nhouse at no extra cost, which provided savings of more than $30,000 per \nmonth. Concerned about the impact of the proposed prices on AHTC\u2019s \nbottom-line, and in particular whether the residents\u2019 service and \nconservancy charges would have to be raised, the Tenders Committee \nasked for a possible three-year projection. Ms How responded that the \nbudget for FY2012 showed a surplus of over $100,000, and that it was \n\u201cnot possible to accurate[ly] project for the next 3 years due to the \nunpredictable external environment, changing manpower policies and \nrising costs\u201d. The minutes of meeting also reflected that whereas \nVersion No 1: 09 Nov 2022 (12:09 hrs)\nHow Weng Fan v Sengkang Town Council[2022] SGCA 72\n33FMSS\u2019s tender for the Second MA Contract specified project \nmanagement fees at a rate of 3.5% for the first two years and 4% for the \nthird year, Mr Loh indicated that FMSS was willing to hold the rates at \n3.5% for all three years. \n(b) In respect of the tender for EMSU services, the Tenders \nCommittee evaluated the price tendered, and noted that compared with \nthe current price being paid by AHTC to FMSS for EMSU services \nunder the First EMSU Contract, there was a proposed increase of 8.5%. \nThe Tenders Committee asked FMSS for its justification. The minutes \nof meeting recorded that, in response, Mr Loh highlighted that the \u201cprice \n(unit rates) were fixed for the 3 year period (2012 to 2015), with no \nallowance for annual increases in between\u201d and indicated that \u201ccost and \nsalary increases were expected, especially in the current inflationary \nenvironment \u2026 and tight manpower situation\u201d. \nThe Tenders Committee subsequently closed the meeting and deferred \ndeliberations to a later date. \n54 On 21 July 2012, the Tenders Committee reconvened to evaluate \nFMSS\u2019s tender for the contract to provide MA services. The Tenders Committee \nasked FMSS to elaborate on why it was not pricing in any reduction in rate for \nlarger projects. In response, Mr Loh stated that different companies had \ndifferent pricing strategies and since FMSS focused on managing only one \ntown, it did not enjoy the economies of scale in project management enjoyed by \nother companies.\n55 A further AHTC meeting was held on 2 August 2012. The meeting \ndiscussed FMSS\u2019s tenders for the contracts to provide MA and EMSU services \nVersion No 1: 09 Nov 2022 (12:09 hrs)\nHow Weng Fan v Sengkang Town Council[2022] SGCA 72\n34to AHTC, at which point FMSS\u2019s representatives left the meeting. The members \nof the meeting considered tender evaluation reports submitted by the Tenders \nCommittee and accepted the Tenders Committee\u2019s recommendations to award \nFMSS the Second MA Contract and the Second EMSU Contract at the tendered \nprices. \n56 On 3 and 7 August 2012 respectively, Ms Lim sent letters of acceptance \nto FMSS, communicating AHTC\u2019s acceptance of FMSS\u2019s tender for the \ncontract to provide MA services for the period from 15 July 2012 to 14 July \n2015, and AHTC\u2019s acceptance of FMSS\u2019s tender for the contract to provide \nEMSU services for the period from 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2015. The Second \nMA Contract and the Second EMSU Contract were awarded to FMSS on those \nrespective dates. \nThe pleaded breaches\n57 The Plaintiffs pleaded that the following breaches of duties occurred \narising from the award of the First MA Contract and the First EMSU Contract \nwithout tender.\n58 They emphasise in their pleadings that r 74(1) of the TCFR provides that \n\u201ctenders shall be invited for the execution of works or for any single item of \nstores or services estimated to cost more than $70,000\u201d, \u201c[u]nless waived\u201d under \nr 74(17) of the TCFR.

Consequently, PRPTC pleaded that the \nTown Councillors and Employees acted in breach of their fiduciary duties, duty \nof care and skill qua fiduciary, and\/or their tortious duty of care and skill to \nAHTC, and also their duties owed under the TCA and the TCFR outlined above \nat [21]. AHTC made similar claims, except that, regarding the tortious duties, \nAHTC only made claims against Ms Lim and Mr Low \u2013 pleading that Ms Lim \nand Mr Low breached their duties of care to AHTC by awarding the contracts \nwithout tender.\n60 As for the Second MA Contract and Second EMSU Contract, these were \nawarded to FMSS after a tender that was invited by AHTC on 13 April 2012, \nwhich was prior to the expiry of the First MA Contract on 14 July 2012. FMSS \nwas the sole tenderer for both contracts. PRPTC pleaded that the Town \nCouncillors and Employees breached the same duties outlined at [ 21] above by \n\u201ccausing and\/or procuring and\/or authorising and\/or permitting AHTC to enter \ninto\u201d the Second MA Contract and Second EMSU Contract \u201cin the \ncircumstances set out\u201d above where the waiver of tender for the First MA \nContract and First EMSU Contract were not justified, and FMSS was the sole \ntenderer for both the Second MA Contract and the Second EMSU Contract. The \nspecific reason as to why this constitutes a breach in relation to the Second MA \nVersion No 1: 09 Nov 2022 (12:09 hrs)\nHow Weng Fan v Sengkang Town Council[2022] SGCA 72\n36Contract and the Second EMSU Contract is not clearly stated in PRPTC\u2019s \npleadings, though PRPTC developed this in its submissions at the trial below \nby submitting that the breach arose because the reasons and motives which \ndrove the Town Councillors and the Employees to waive tenders and appoint \nFMSS under the First MA Contract and First EMSU Contract made FMSS\u2019s \nappointment under the Second MA Contract and Second EMSU Contract a fait \naccompli. It was contended that because the Town Councillors and the \nEmployees had manipulated events in 2011 to oust CPG and install FMSS, it \nwas a foregone conclusion that no other company would take the tender for the \nSecond MA Contract and Second EMSU Contract seriously. Although \nPRPTC\u2019s case was run in this way in its closing submissions at trial, however, \nPRPTC\u2019s case was not explicitly pleaded in these terms.\n61 AHTC was even less precise in its pleadings regarding the breaches \nflowing from the Second MA Contract and the Second EMSU Contract, as \nAHTC did not make any distinction between the first and second MA and \nEMSU Contracts. Rather, AHTC pleaded that Ms Lim and Mr Low\u2019s entry into \nand\/or authorisation and approval of, or acquiescence in, all the MA and EMSU \nContracts constituted breaches of their fiduciary duties, without specifying \nwhether there were any differences between the contracts, despite the fact that \nno tenders were called for the First MA Contract and First EMSU Contract, \nwhereas a tender was held for the Second MA Contract and the Second EMSU \nContract. In any event, the Judge held that no breaches arose from the Second \nMA Contract and the Second EMSU Contract, and AHTC and STC have not"}

He was a member of a syndicate (\u201cSyndicate 1\u201d) that controlled the sale of contraband cigarettes at a field at Tuas South Avenue 1 in the latter half of 2016. Other members of Syndicate 1 included one \u201cAziz\u201d and one \u201cMitho\u201d. The deceased, Munshi Abdur Rahim (\u201cthe Victim\u201d) was a member of another contraband cigarette syndicate (\u201cSyndicate 2\u201d) which was vying for control over contraband cigarette sales at the same field. The Victim was 32 years old at the time of the incident.', '4\\u2003The Victim\u2019s tragic death occurred as a result of an incident during the night of 24 September 2016 between members of the two rival syndicates, with Syndicate 1 seeking to monopolise the illegal trades at the said field. After a meeting at a canteen at around 7.00pm that night, members of Syndicate 1 proceeded towards the field, many of them armed with choppers. When they had reached the field, one of them approached the Victim and asked him why he was selling cigarettes in that area. Manik knew the Victim from a previous construction project that he had worked in. Manik went to speak to the Victim and shook his hand. One of the members of Syndicate 1 suggested that they talk at Tuas South Avenue 6 and the group of men started moving in that direction.', '5\\u2003At this point, confusion erupted. The source of the confusion was unclear. According to one member of Syndicate 1, all of a sudden, another member, Aziz, wielded a knife and shouted: \u201cLet\u2019s chop hard this son of a bitch.\u201d He testified that Aziz was \u201clike that\u201d, and that he \u201cgets into [a] fight before everybody \u2026 else\u201d. According to other members of Syndicate 1, there were shouts warning about police presence, following which people started running.', '6\\u2003The Victim started running away. The evidence was that Aziz, Mitho, Manik and a few others (all members of Syndicate 1) started chasing the Victim who stumbled and fell. Aziz, Mitho, Manik caught up with the Victim and Mitho kicked the Victim. The three men then attacked the Victim with choppers while he was struggling and kicking on the ground. There were chopping motions made by the three attackers. Somehow, the Victim managed to get up and ran away from his attackers. The attackers did not give chase this time but turned to run towards where they came from. This incident from the time the Victim ran and fell up to the time he hobbled away was recorded fortuitously by a camera installed in a bus parked nearby (the \u201cVideo Footage\u201d). This incident was recorded as having happened at 9.47pm for about nine seconds. As the area was not well lit, the Video Footage could not provide clear images.', '7\\u2003The Victim managed to run some distance away before he phoned the police to report that \u201c[p]eople chopped me with knife\u201d. When the police and the ambulance arrived, the Victim was lying on his back in a pool of blood, with most of the bleeding coming from his lower left leg. He was pronounced dead at the hospital.', '8\\u2003It was not disputed that the cause of death was acute haemorrhage due to incised wounds at the left leg and the back of the Victim. The incised wound at the left leg was identified as the fatal injury (\u201cthe Fatal Injury\u201d) as it could have caused significant haemorrhage individually sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature. The wound at the Victim\u2019s back resulted in significant haemorrhage that contributed to death. The other injuries were relatively superficial and did not have a significant bearing on the death of the Victim.', '9\\u2003In the meantime, Manik and several other Syndicate 1 members left in a taxi. Several of them went to the East Coast Park to discuss the events that happened earlier. Instead of returning to their dormitories, Manik and a few others went to stay in a hotel in Geylang. Thereafter, Manik stayed with a friend until his arrest on 30 September 2016 at a construction site in Tampines.'"}

Dr Rajesh also records that Roszaidi started consuming erimin and dormicum tablets from the age of 12, and he consumed these once or twice a week. However, nothing turns on this difference because on either account, it is clear that Roszaidi was a heavy user of drugs from a young age.', '8\\u2003A perusal of Roszaidi\u2019s treatment records at the Drug Rehabilitation Centre (\u201cDRC\u201d) and his criminal records reveals that he was subsequently plagued by drug-related problems for most of his adult life. These criminal records were tendered by the Prosecution on 26 April 2022, upon our request and without objection from either party.', '9\\u2003On 1 March 1990, when Roszaidi was around 18 years old, he was ordered to undergo treatment at the DRC for six months on account of his drug consumption. On 28 May 1990, he was placed under drug supervision for 24 months. On 26 June 1990, he was again ordered to undergo treatment at the DRC for six months. On 14 June 1991, when he was around 19 years old, he was again placed under drug supervision for 24 months. On 24 January 1992, when Roszaidi was around 20 years old, he was yet again ordered to undergo treatment at the DRC for six months. And on 16 January 1995, when Roszaidi was around 23 years old, he was once again placed under drug supervision for 24 months.', '10\\u2003Just over a week later in the same year, on 24 January 1995, Roszaidi was convicted on a charge of unauthorised possession of a controlled drug and sentenced to six months\u2019 imprisonment. A few months later, on 24 July 1995, he was again ordered to undergo treatment at the DRC for six months.', '11\\u2003On 16 July 1997, when Roszaidi was around 25 years old, he was placed under drug supervision for 24 months. On 4 October 1997, he was ordered to undergo treatment at the DRC for six months for his consumption of morphine. In 1999, when Roszaidi was around 27 years old, he started injecting heroin. This went on until 2006 (see [13] below).', '12\\u2003On 23 February 2000, when Roszaidi was around 28 years old, he was convicted on another charge of unauthorised possession of a controlled drug (morphine), as well as a charge of smoking, self-administering or consuming morphine. For these two offences, he was sentenced to two years\u2019 imprisonment and five years and three weeks\u2019 imprisonment respectively, both to run concurrently. A further charge of consumption of cannabinol derivatives was taken into consideration.', '13\\u2003On 28 July 2003, when Roszaidi was around 31 years old, he was placed under drug supervision for 24 months for his consumption of morphine. In 2006, when Roszaidi was around 34 years old, he stopped injecting heroin when he had to undergo an operation. He went to the Institute of Mental Health (\u201cIMH\u201d)\u2019s addiction department for the \u201cSubutex\u201d (or buprenorphine) programme. However, even then, he continued to smoke heroin regularly. The longest period for which Roszaidi had held a job until this point was three years from 2003 to 2006, when he was between the ages of 31 and 34. During this time, he worked as a Production Officer in Jurong Island.', '14\\u2003On 2 February 2007, when Roszaidi was around 35 years old, he was convicted of trafficking in a controlled drug (buprenorphine) and sentenced to five years\u2019 imprisonment with five strokes of the cane. He was also convicted of smoking, self-administering or consuming buprenorphine and was sentenced to seven years and six months\u2019 imprisonment with six strokes of the cane. These two sentences ran concurrently. Two further charges were taken into consideration: one charge of trafficking in buprenorphine, and one charge of smoking, self-administering or consuming buprenorphine. It is likely that it was when Roszaidi was serving this imprisonment term that he became acquainted with one \u201cIs Cangeh\u201d. In Roszaidi\u2019s third long statement dated 17 October 2015 (\u201cRoszaidi\u2019s 3rd Long Statement\u201d), he stated that he \u201csaw [Is Cangeh] in prison when [he] was serving [the] sentence for [his] Subutex trafficking offence\u201d.', '15\\u2003After his release from prison in 2011, Dr Rajesh\u2019s 2nd Report records that Roszaidi \u201cstayed away from drugs for 1 year until 2012, when he was arrested for possession of heroin\u201d. It is likely that this period of abstinence from drugs in fact ended before the end of 2011, given that \u2013 on 3 December 2011, when Roszaidi was around 39 years old \u2013 he was placed under drug supervision for 24 months for his consumption of buprenorphine. Some months later, on 24 August 2012 (when Roszaidi was around 40 years old), he was convicted on a charge of being in unauthorised possession of diamorphine and was sentenced to three years\u2019 imprisonment.', '16\\u2003In 2014, while Roszaidi was in prison, his father passed away.', '17\\u2003Sometime in 2014, when Roszaidi was around 42 years old, he was released from prison. Thereafter, he worked at a chemical company for a few months under the prison\u2019s Work Release Scheme. Sometime in 2015, Roszaidi changed jobs and began working at a flour company. While the date of this change in employment cannot be ascertained with precision based on the materials presently before us, it can be surmised that he began working at the flour company in November or December 2014 or in early 2015, given that he stated that he had worked for the company that had contracted him out to the flour company for \u201cnearly 6 months\u201d, and he quit this job in May 2015.', '18\\u2003It is not clear precisely when Roszaidi began consuming drugs again after his release from prison in 2014. Dr Saluja\u2019s 1st Report records that Roszaidi\u2019s longest period of remaining drug-free in the community (meaning other than when he was in prison) was for about one and a half years prior to his last relapse. This would have brought him to about five months before his arrest in October 2015 for the offence with which we are presently concerned. Based on this, Roszaidi would have resumed consuming drugs in or around May 2015. Dr Rajesh\u2019s 2nd Report corroborates this to the extent that it records that Roszaidi\u2019s longest period of abstinence from drugs was \u201cslightly more than a year after his release from prison in 2014\u201d, but differs from Dr Saluja\u2019s account in stating that Roszaidi relapsed into drug use around February 2015 when he resumed smoking heroin, and that it was the escalation of his drug use which took place in May 2015 following the passing of his mother and grandmother.', '19\\u2003Notwithstanding this point of uncertainty, it can be taken that Roszaidi largely abstained from consuming drugs for a year or more immediately after his release from prison in 2014, but either resumed or escalated his drug consumption in May 2015. In May 2015, Roszaidi suffered two bereavements: his grandmother passed away, and his mother passed away two weeks later. Roszaidi\u2019s grandmother and mother had raised him, and he lived with them at the time of their passing. It is possible that he resumed his drug consumption earlier, in February 2015, a few months before they passed. However, in this connection, it bears highlighting that prior to the passing of Roszaidi\u2019s mother, it seems that she suffered from a period of serious illness. It was noted in Dr Rajesh\u2019s 2nd Report that Roszaidi\u2019s mother \u201cused to have regular dialysis for her kidney issues prior to her passing away\u201d from kidney failure.', '20\\u2003Shortly after these bereavements, Roszaidi quit his job at the flour company. Both experts diagnosed that Roszaidi started to suffer from depression at or around this time. Indeed, it is uncontested that the bereavements triggered his MDD. Dr Saluja\u2019s 1st Report noted that Roszaidi had been depressed since around April or May 2015 and that his depression was \u201ctriggered by\u201d the death of his mother and his grandmother, while Dr Rajesh\u2019s 2nd Report opined that the \u201conset\u201d of Roszaidi\u2019s MDD was in May 2015 after these bereavements. After Roszaidi suffered these bereavements, his rate of drug consumption (of heroin, methamphetamine and dormicum) escalated. Importantly, although only Dr Rajesh recorded this as an escalation (in his 2nd Report), the fact of this escalation in May 2015 is common ground between the experts in so far as Dr Saluja\u2019s 1st Report recorded that Roszaidi\u2019s drug consumption resumed in May 2015, which in turn would necessarily have entailed an even sharper escalation in his rate of consumption from a base of no consumption. Roszaidi also stated that he resumed smoking cannabis in May 2015 and would then smoke cannabis whenever he felt like it.', '21\\u2003In July 2015, Roszaidi began delivering drugs for Is Cangeh. From that point until his arrest, he completed five or six jobs for Is Cangeh. He told Dr Saluja that he \u201cnever bought heroin\u201d because he \u201cnever had money to buy for [him]self (for [the] last 5 months)\u201d. Instead, as he explained in his second long statement dated 16 October 2015 (\u201cRoszaidi\u2019s 2nd Long Statement\u201d) and in his testimony at trial, he took various drugs from the consignments that he delivered for Is Cangeh for his personal consumption and to feed his drug addiction. This was corroborated by Dr Rajesh, both in his third report dated 31 August 2020 (\u201cDr Rajesh\u2019s 3rd Report\u201d) and in his testimony at the remittal hearing. It was not disputed that Roszaidi did not have the means to afford his escalating drug consumption after the onset of his MDD and that he obtained his supply (or at least a significant part thereof) from the drugs he was to deliver for Is Cangeh.', '22\\u2003On 6 October 2015, at or around noon, Roszaidi was shopping at the Jurong Point shopping mall (\u201cJurong Point\u201d) with Azidah and their daughter. He had brought with him a red pouch containing a packet of heroin and approximately 50g of ice, as well as utensils for smoking both. He went into a toilet to smoke some of the heroin for about half an hour while Azidah and their daughter were elsewhere in Jurong Point. While he was at Jurong Point, Roszaidi received a call from Is Cangeh who told him to stand by for a job later that day.', '23\\u2003Roszaidi left Jurong Point with Azidah and their daughter at around 2.00pm. They then travelled to his younger brother\u2019s house, where they spent time with Roszaidi\u2019s younger brother and his family. At around 6.00pm, Roszaidi received a further call from Is Cangeh instructing him to go to Jurong West Avenue 2, locate a lorry with a \u201cTiong Nam\u201d logo and collect the Drugs. Roszaidi then called his friend, one Mr Mohammad Azli bin Mohammad Salleh (\u201cAzli\u201d), to pick him up and drive him around for the job, as he had done on previous occasions.', '24\\u2003Sometime before 7.00pm that evening, Azli picked Roszaidi up from his younger brother\u2019s house and Roszaidi told Azidah that he needed to \u201cgo out for a while\u201d. Roszaidi told Azli to drive to Jurong West Avenue 2. While inside the car with Azli, Roszaidi smoked heroin for the second time that day. On the way to their destination, one Mr Muhammad Mirwazy bin Adam (\u201cMirwazy\u201d) called Roszaidi asking for some methamphetamine. Roszaidi arranged to pick Mirwazy up from the Pioneer MRT station on the way to Jurong West Avenue 2. After picking Mirwazy up, Roszaidi and Mirwazy took turns to smoke methamphetamine inside Azli\u2019s car. Roszaidi himself smoked \u201cmore than 10 puffs\u201d of methamphetamine.', '25\\u2003Sometime after 7.00pm, Roszaidi, Azli and Mirwazy arrived at Jurong West Avenue 2. While looking out for the lorry with the \u201cTiong Nam\u201d logo, Roszaidi received a call from \u201csomeone\u201d, not Is Cangeh, instructing him to go to the Shell petrol station beside Jurong Point. The group did so, only for Roszaidi to later be told by Is Cangeh to return to their previous location. The group duly did so and, there, they found the lorry in question. After confirming with Is Cangeh that this indeed was the vehicle from which the drugs were to be collected, Roszaidi told Is Cangeh to tell the lorry driver to \u201cdrive forward a bit\u201d. The lorry then drove past Azli\u2019s car and Roszaidi told Azli to follow it. The group followed the lorry for some distance before both vehicles stopped. Roszaidi then alighted from Azli\u2019s car and collected two packets of diamorphine (ie, the Drugs) and three packets of methamphetamine in a red plastic bag from one Mr Aishamudin bin Jamaludin (\u201cAishamudin\u201d) and one Mr Suhaizam bin Khariri (\u201cSuhaizam\u201d), who were waiting in the cabin of the lorry. For the avoidance of doubt, as the offence that Roszaidi was convicted of only involves the two packets of diamorphine, any reference in this judgment to \u201cthe Drugs\u201d should be understood to refer only to the diamorphine. While it is not clear precisely what time the collection of the Drugs took place, it seems this would have been around or shortly after 9.30pm.', '26\\u2003After returning to the car and inspecting the consignment of drugs he had just collected, Roszaidi realised that the drugs seemed of a larger quantity than he expected, and he called Is Cangeh to ask why there was so much heroin and ice in the consignment (\u201cthe Phone Call\u201d). Is Cangeh told him to hold on to the drugs for a while and to complete the delivery.', '27\\u2003Roszaidi then directed Azli to drive off and they dropped Mirwazy off at the JCube shopping mall. After waiting for some time for a call from the person to whom he was meant to deliver the drug consignment, Roszaidi decided to call Azidah, who was still at Roszaidi\u2019s younger brother\u2019s house with their daughter. Roszaidi told Azidah that he needed her to \u201ccome down to take something\u201d from him, without telling her that he was handing her drugs, and told her to bring along a plastic bag. Roszaidi then told Azli to drive to Jurong West Street 91, where Azidah would be waiting. On the way there, Roszaidi removed the Drugs and two of the packets of methamphetamine from the red plastic bag and placed them in a \u201cStarmart\u201d plastic bag. When Roszaidi and Azli reached Jurong West Street 91, Azidah was waiting along the road with a yellow paper bag. Roszaidi wound down the car window, took the yellow paper bag from Azidah, placed the \u201cStarmart\u201d plastic bag inside the yellow paper bag, and handed it back to her through the car window. This took place at around 10.22pm. This transfer of the Drugs to Azidah forms the actus reus of the drug trafficking offence of which Roszaidi was convicted.', '28\\u2003Azidah then returned to Roszaidi\u2019s younger brother\u2019s house, while Roszaidi and Azli drove off. Shortly thereafter, Roszaidi, Azli and Azidah were arrested by Central Narcotics Bureau (\u201cCNB\u201d) officers. At the time of his arrest, Roszaidi was 43 years old.'"}
{"casename":"2022_SGCA_76","fact":"'3\\u2003The facts have been set out exhaustively at [3]\u2013[36] of the GD and we do not propose to restate them in any detail. Briefly, the background to this dispute reached back to 1976 when The Independent State of Papua New Guinea (\u201cthe State\u201d) and an Australian multinational mining company now known as BHP Group Limited (\u201cBHP Group\u201d) incorporated a company in Papua New Guinea, known as Ok Tedi Mining Limited (\u201cOTML\u201d), to own and operate the Mine. BHP Group held 52% of OTML\u2019s shares (\u201cthe Shares\u201d) through its wholly owned subsidiary, BHP Minerals Holdings Pty Ltd (\u201cBHP Minerals\u201d). Apart from BHP Minerals, there were three other shareholders of OTML: the State, Inmet Mining Corporation and Mineral Resources Ok Tedi No 2 Limited (collectively \u201cthe Shareholders\u201d). Whilst the Mine was exceptionally lucrative, it was also exceptionally harmful to the environment in which the Affected Communities were situated (GD at [15]\u2013[17]).', '4\\u2003In late 2000, BHP Group announced its intention to divest its shares in OTML. OTML\u2019s stakeholders then engaged in extensive negotiations as to the arrangements that would facilitate BHP Group\u2019s exit from OTML. A key part of the exit plan was for BHP Minerals to divest its entire 52% shareholding in OTML to a special purpose vehicle. The respondent was incorporated in Singapore in October 2001 to be that special purpose vehicle (GD at [20]\u2013[21]).', '5\\u2003The substance of the arrangements, through which BHP Group was to exit OTML, was subsequently recorded in a suite of written contracts, to which members of the Affected Communities (and for that matter, the appellants) were not party, including (GD at [26]\u2013[33]):', '(a)\\u2003The Ok Tedi Mine Continuation (Ninth Supplemental) Agreement entered into between BHP Group, OTML and the Shareholders;', '(b)\\u2003A master agreement entered into between the respondent, BHP Group, OTML and the Shareholders setting out the parties\u2019 primary obligations (\u201cMaster Agreement\u201d). By cl 3.1 of the Master Agreement, BHP Minerals agreed to transfer the Shares to the respondent. The consideration for this transfer was the respondent\u2019s contractual undertaking in cl 3.2 of the Master Agreement to comply with a schedule to the respondent\u2019s articles of association (\u201cthe Articles\u201d) called the \u201cProgram Rules\u201d. The respondent gave this undertaking expressly for the benefit of four entities: BHP Group, BHP Minerals, the State and OTML, thereby giving each of these four entities a direct right to enforce the Program Rules against it. This is separate from and independent of the respondent\u2019s obligation to its members for the time being to comply with the Program Rules as a component of the respondent\u2019s corporate constitution (see [7] below);', '(c)\\u2003Two deeds of indemnity which the respondent executed in favour of BHP Group (\u201cBHP\u2019s Indemnity\u201d) and the State (\u201cthe State\u2019s Indemnity\u201d) respectively; and', '(d)\\u2003Three contracts, namely a security deed, an equitable mortgage over the Shares and a security trust deed (\u201cSecurity Trust Deed\u201d), collectively referred to as \u201cthe Security Arrangements\u201d which the respondent entered into as security for the punctual performance of its obligations under BHP\u2019s Indemnity and the State\u2019s Indemnity. Under the Security Arrangements, TMF Trustees Singapore Ltd (\u201cthe Security Trustee\u201d) held very broad security interests over virtually all of the respondent\u2019s present and future assets.', 'The transfer of BHP Minerals\u2019 shareholding in OTML to the respondent was effected on 7 February 2002.', '6\\u2003We digress to observe that the various agreements were negotiated over a considerable period of time; and although the Affected Communities were not party to the agreements that the respondent was subject to, it appeared that the Affected Communities were concerned parties and had interactions with some of the other parties. This was unsurprising since these communities were among those affected by the operations of the Mine. For example, certain members of the Affected Communities entered into contracts, known as Community Mine Continuation Agreements (\u201cCMCAs\u201d), with OTML. While the appellants said that the CMCAs showed, among other things, the said members releasing OTML, BHP Minerals and BHP Group from all claims arising from the operation of the Mine, the appellants did not say and indeed they accepted that the CMCAs did not set out the respondent\u2019s purported obligations to the members of the Affected Communities. This was unsurprising given that the respondent is not party to the CMCAs. 1', 'For the avoidance of doubt, and as we will come to later, we did not accept that any obligations were owed by the respondent to the members of the Affected Communities.', '7\\u2003The respondent\u2019s corporate constitution is set out in the (a) memorandum of association (\u201cthe Memorandum\u201d); (b) the Articles; and (c) the Program Rules. Its objects are set out in cl 3 of the Memorandum, and these are, among other things, to apply the income from the Mine to \u201cpromote sustainable development within, and advance the general welfare of the people of, [PNG], particularly those of the Western Province of [PNG]\u201d. Rules 9 to 10 of the Program Rules set out a contractual framework as to how the respondent was to apply the income from the Mine. This framework, among other things, both permits and obliges the respondent to apply the income from the Mine for the benefit of two classes of people: (a) the people of the Western Province of PNG; and (b) the people of PNG. As the Judge noted, the Affected Communities or their members are not referred to specifically, much less exclusively, in the respondent\u2019s corporate constitution (GD at [21]\u2013[25]). The Affected Communities were encompassed within both the generic categories of people mentioned as beneficiaries, and likely, more particularly, in the first of those categories.', '8\\u2003Suit 628 was preceded by an earlier suit, Suit No 795 of 2014, between the State and the respondent, in which the State sought, among other things: (a) an order that it had the right to appoint directors to the respondent\u2019s board, and (b) a full account of the respondent\u2019s dealings with its assets. The State failed in that earlier litigation, both at first instance and on appeal (see respectively Independent State of Papua New Guinea v PNG Sustainable Development Program Ltd [2019] SGHC 68 and Independent State of Papua New Guinea v PNG Sustainable Development Program Ltd [2020] 2 SLR 200 (GD at [12]\u2013[13]).', '9\\u2003In Suit 628, the appellants\u2019 case was premised on the respondent having \u201cvoluntarily [undertaken] to act in the interest of the members of the Affected Communities in circumstances giving rise to a relationship of trust and confidence\u201d even though, as we have already highlighted at [5]\u2013[6] above, none of the members of the Affected Communities \u2013 whether then or now \u2013 were or are a party to any of the suite of written contracts the respondent entered into and even though, as we have already highlighted at [7] above, neither the objects for which the respondent was established nor the Program Rules identify the members of the Affected Communities as a distinct class. The appellants contended that the respondent breached its fiduciary duties to the members of the Affected Communities when it failed to administer its assets in compliance with the Program Rules.', '10\\u2003The Judge patiently addressed the arguments before him and set out his reasoning in considerable detail. In summary, he found that the respondent gave no undertaking whatsoever \u2013 voluntary or otherwise, express or implied, in respect of any of its assets \u2013 to the members of the Affected Communities at any time. It certainly did not do so in the Master Agreement; nor did it do so in any other way. The only undertakings which the respondent gave in respect of its assets to anyone at any time were those set out in the suite of written contracts it entered into following its incorporation and it gave them only to the counterparties to those contracts (GD at [73]\u2013[74]). To suggest that the respondent gave a non-contractual undertaking to members of the Affected Communities was plainly and obviously unsustainable because such an undertaking would be wholly inconsistent with both the express contractual obligations which the respondent undertook and the express discretionary powers which the respondent acquired under the suite of written contracts it entered into. It followed that there could be no fiduciary duties owed by the respondent to the members of the Affected Communities which was pleaded to arise \u201cby virtue of the [respondent\u2019s] voluntary undertaking to act in the interests of the members of the Affected Communities\u201d (GD at [75]\u2013[86]). Flowing from these findings, the Judge dismissed the pleaded breaches of the respondent\u2019s fiduciary duties (GD at [102]\u2013[105]). The focus of the present appeal was on those findings of the Judge. While the Judge also dismissed the appellants\u2019 claims on the basis of a remedial constructive trust, lawful and unlawful means conspiracy and unjust enrichment, these were outside the scope of this appeal as the appellants no longer pursued them. 2'"}
