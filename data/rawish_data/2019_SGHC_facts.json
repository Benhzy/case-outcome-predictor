{"casename":"2019_SGHC_102","fact":"'6\\u2003It is, in our view, of the first importance to commence with the overall medical condition of the Patient himself \u2013 stated in its unadorned essence. This is the basic starting point and will help this Court to focus on the various arguments proffered by both parties, thereby avoiding any irrelevant arguments that distract from this central focus.', '7\\u2003Put simply, the Patient had a serious fall and fractured his right clavicle (collarbone). He also suffered fractures to two to four (lower) ribs as well as a 1cm laceration to his head and a contusion to his wrist. Viewed holistically, the Patient had suffered from multiple injuries that emanated from one and the same accident. This was the medical condition of the Patient which faced Dr Yip. It is essential to bear this condition in mind when considering Dr Yip\u2019s conduct vis-\u00e0-vis the Patient (together with the reasons he furnished for such conduct). It was decided that surgical fixation of the clavicle fracture was necessary, and to that end, the Patient underwent surgery in the late hours of that same day, and the procedure was completed in the early hours of the next. After a period of convalescence, the Patient was discharged later in the morning. He was given hospitalisation leave for the surgery (spanning those two days), and was certified fit for light duties thereafter. No additional sick leave was given. These were the essential facts before us.', '8\\u2003In essence, the DT found that Dr Yip\u2019s conduct in failing to prescribe any sick leave and instead certifying the Patient fit for light duties fell below the standards expected of him as a medical practitioner in two separate and distinct respects. The first applicable standard of conduct was that, given the medical condition of the Patient in light of the available expert evidence, Dr Yip ought to have granted the Patient sick leave (instead of light duties). In failing to do so, Dr Yip had intentionally and deliberately departed from this applicable standard and was therefore guilty of professional misconduct. The DT also held that Dr Yip had also intentionally and deliberately departed from another (and second) applicable standard of conduct in not proactively ensuring that there were adequate conditions for rest and rehabilitation for the Patient before prescribing light duties for him. Unfortunately, the DT did not explain how these two standards were related (if at all) and we return to this point at [65] below.', '9\\u2003Following the DT\u2019s analysis of the two standards, Dr Yip\u2019s case on appeal consists of two major planks. The first plank is that the first applicable standard of conduct did not, having regard to the medical condition of the Patient and in light of the available expert evidence, necessarily require the grant of sick leave to the Patient and that, even if it did, Dr Yip had not intentionally and deliberately departed from that standard. The second plank is that, in relation to the second applicable standard (which, unlike the first applicable standard of conduct, he did not controvert), he had discharged his duty to establish that there were adequate conditions for rest and rehabilitation by discussing the existence and types of light duties with the Patient, and obtaining the Patient\u2019s agreement to try light duties.', '10\\u2003We would like to pause at this juncture to note that although the DT appeared to accept that there were two applicable standards of conduct as just set out above, it could be said that the second (viz, ensuring proactively that there were adequate conditions for rest and rehabilitation for the Patient before prescribing light duties) was not only inextricably linked to but (instead of comprising a separate applicable standard of conduct) could be considered to be an integral part of the first applicable standard (requiring the grant of sick leave) inasmuch as it qualified the first applicable standard by providing that light duties may be prescribed in lieu of sick leave if \u2013 and only if \u2013 the doctor first ascertains and satisfies himself that there would be adequate conditions for rest and rehabilitation. In our view, it might be preferable in future cases for the DT to adopt the approach just mentioned so that, instead of considering two applicable standards of conduct, it should focus on just one applicable standard of conduct in the manner set out above.', '11\\u2003Dr Yip was at the material time an orthopaedic surgeon who practised at his own medical clinic, the Singapore Sports and Orthopaedic Clinic (\u201cthe Clinic\u201d) located at the Gleneagles Medical Centre. The Patient was a 47-year-old Chinese national employed as a bricklayer by Soon Tat Construction Engineering Private Limited (\u201cSoon Tat\u201d).', '12\\u2003On 7 July 2011, the Patient fell from a scaffolding platform at a worksite and was brought to the Clinic. He was accompanied by his supervisor, Mr Krishnan Muthukannan (\u201cMr Muthukannan\u201d). Mr Lin Sheng (\u201cMr Lin\u201d), the boss of Soon Tat, arrived some time later. Dr Yip examined the Patient and found that he had fractured his right clavicle and his 7th to 9th right ribs, and suffered a 1cm head laceration, among other injuries. Dr Yip recommended surgical treatment for the clavicle fracture and conservative (ie, non-surgical) treatment for the rib fractures. The appropriateness of these two treatment orders is not in issue before us.', '13\\u2003On that same day, Dr Yip performed an Open Reduction Internal Fixation (\u201cORIF\u201d) surgery on the Patient\u2019s right clavicle. The procedure commenced at about 10.55pm on 7 July 2011 and was completed at around 12.12am on 8 July 2011. Following a period of rest, the Patient was then discharged on the same day at around 10.10am. Dr Yip gave the Patient sick leave for 7 to 8 July 2011, and certified the Patient fit for light duties from 9 to 11 July 2011 (ie, from the first post-operative day).', '14\\u2003On 11 July 2011, the Patient attended at the Clinic for a scheduled follow-up appointment (\u201cthe first follow-up review\u201d), accompanied by Mr Lin. The Patient\u2019s clavicle fracture was assessed to be stable, and, in relation to the rib fractures, he had not developed any chest infection or pneumothorax. A fracture of the 6th right rib, which had likely gone undetected by the previous radiologist, was detected upon examination of a further X-ray report, but Dr Yip was of the view that there was no material change in the Patient\u2019s condition. Dr Yip certified the Patient fit for light duties from 12 to 18 July 2011.', '15\\u2003On 18 July 2011, the Patient attended at the Clinic (\u201cthe second follow-up review\u201d), again accompanied by Mr Lin. Dr Yip found the Patient to be recovering well, and certified the Patient fit for light duties from 19 to 25 July 2011.', '16\\u2003A third follow-up review was scheduled for 25 July 2011, but the Patient did not turn up for the appointment. Instead, on 22 July 2011, the Patient went to the Tan Tock Seng Hospital (\u201cTTSH\u201d) Emergency Department complaining of persistent giddiness, nausea and right pleuritic chest pain, and was hospitalised. On 23 July 2011, he was discharged with hospitalisation leave from 22 to 28 July 2011 and was referred to the National Neuroscience Institute (\u201cNNI\u201d) and the TTSH Orthopaedic Surgery Department for follow-up.', '17\\u2003The Patient subsequently approached the Humanitarian Organisation for Migration Economics (\u201cHOME\u201d) for assistance with wage compensation issues. On 24 October 2011, a complaint was lodged with the SMC (\u201cthe Complaint\u201d) by one Mr Jolovan Wham (\u201cMr Wham\u201d), a social worker at HOME. The nub of the Complaint was that Dr Yip should not have given only two days\u2019 sick leave to the Patient \u2013 none of which was of a post-operative nature (see also [13] above).', '18\\u2003On 22 May 2012, Dr Yip was informed about the Complaint by the Investigation Unit of the SMC, and, just over a month later on 29 June 2012, Dr Yip gave his Explanation to the Complaints Committee (\u201cExplanation\u201d).', '19\\u2003On 2 April 2015, Dr Yip was notified by the Complaints Committee that a formal inquiry would be convened, and a Notice of Inquiry (\u201cNOI\u201d) was subsequently issued on 3 November 2015.', '20\\u2003A total of three charges (\u201cthe Charges\u201d) and three alternative charges (\u201cthe Alternative Charges\u201d) were brought against Dr Yip under s 53(1)(d) of the Medical Registration Act (Cap 174, 2014 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe MRA\u201d).', '21\\u2003For context as to how the charges were framed, this Court in Low Cze Hong v Singapore Medical Council [2008] 3 SLR(R) 612 (\u201cLow Cze Hong\u201d) accepted that the \u201cprofessional misconduct\u201d sanctioned under s 53(1)(d) of the MRA can be made out in at least two situations (at [37]):', '(a)\\u2003where there is an intentional, deliberate departure from standards observed or approved by members of the profession of good repute and competency (\u201cthe first limb\u201d); or', '(b)\\u2003where there has been such serious negligence that it objectively portrays an abuse of the privileges which accompany registration as a medical practitioner (\u201cthe second limb\u201d).', '22\\u2003The Charges and Alternative Charges were based on exactly the same factual substratum, the difference being that the Charges were brought under the first limb, whereas the Alternative Charges were brought under the second limb.', '23\\u2003The essence of the first, second and third Charges was that Dr Yip, on each of the three occasions he had examined the Patient (ie, 8, 11 and 18 July 2011), (a) had failed to ensure that adequate sick leave was given to the Patient in light of his condition and the nature of his occupation, and (b) had inappropriately certified the Patient as fit for light duties.

The three accused persons and the Complainant had met for the first time on the evening prior, on 25 January 2014, at a birthday party for Mr Muhammad Elmi Ching bin Aman (\u201cElmi\u201d) which was planned by his then-girlfriend, Ms Ros Izzati Atiqah binte Mohd Zulkifli (\u201cIzzati\u201d). This party was held in the Room, which was internally divided into two floors. On the first floor was the living room, which comprised a seating area with tables, sofas and a television. The main door, which was the only entrance and exit out of the Room, was located on this floor. A spiral staircase connected the first floor to the mezzanine level, which I shall refer to as \u201cthe second floor\u201d. On this second floor was a bedroom containing a double bed and a cabinet, and the Room\u2019s only bathroom, which some witnesses also referred to as the \u201ctoilet\u201d. The bathroom layout was rectangular and on entering it, one would see a bathtub on the right, a water closet on the left, and the sink with a counter-top in front of the door. Above the sink was a mirror that faced the bathroom door.', '8\\u2003The Complainant did not know and had not met the accused persons, Elmi, or Izzati prior to 25 January 2014. Her original plan for that evening was to meet some friends and then visit a nightclub. Shortly after 10pm, however, Mr Muhammad Fadly bin Abdull Wahab (\u201cFadly\u201d) messaged her and invited her to have drinks at Elmi\u2019s birthday party. Although Fadly repeatedly urged her to come alone, 1', 'the Complainant insisted on bringing along her friend, Mr Mohamed Affandi bin Ibrahim (\u201cAffandi\u201d), and Fadly eventually agreed. 2', 'Evidence showed that, at that time, Fadly was planning to get the Complainant drunk at the party and had brought along a bottle of vodka for that purpose. 3', 'The three accused persons were Elmi\u2019s friends and were also invited to the party.', '9\\u2003The Complainant and Affandi arrived at the Duxton Hotel close to or slightly after midnight on 26 January 2014. 4', 'By the time they joined the party, all three accused persons, together with Elmi, Izzati, and the other attendees, were already in the Room and were engaging in casual conversations at the first floor while consuming alcohol. 5', 'The Complainant sat next to Fadly on a sofa. 6', 'Conversations continued and, save for Izzati, all the attendees consumed alcohol. 7', 'The Complainant behaved normally at the time of her arrival, 8', 'and she subsequently interacted mostly with Fadly and Affandi. 9', 'According to the Complainant, she had not consumed any alcohol earlier that evening prior to arriving at the party. 10', 'I will elaborate later on the evidence on the type and amount of alcohol that she consumed at the party (see below at [141]).', '10\\u2003After some time, an impromptu plan was made for the attendees of the party to head to a nightclub named Zouk. 11', 'At around 1am on 26 January 2014, as the attendees were preparing to leave the Room for Zouk, 12', 'the Complainant tried to stand up on her own but had difficulty doing so. 13', 'She collapsed onto the ground, 14', 'and some evidence suggested that she vomited on the floor. 15', 'Fadly then brought the Complainant to the bathroom on the second floor. 16', 'When it became clear that the Complainant would not be able to go to Zouk, Fadly and Mr Muhammad Hazly Bin Mohamad Halimi (\u201cHazly\u201d) elected to stay behind with her while the other attendees made their way to the nightclub. 17', 'I shall refer to those who left for Zouk collectively as \u201cthe Group\u201d.', '11\\u2003After the Group had left the Room, Fadly and\/or Hazly brought the Complainant out of the bathroom and placed her on the bed on the second floor. The two men then took a photo of themselves with the Complainant partially undressed and her breasts exposed. 18', 'At this point, the Complainant was still unconscious. 19', 'Fadly then sent the photo to his friend at around 1.58am.', '12\\u2003At around 2.20am, Elmi returned to the Room to pick up Izzati\u2019s identification card (\u201cIC\u201d). 20', 'He testified that, upon his return, he saw that the Complainant was fully dressed by that time, 21', 'but she was in an unconscious state on the ground of the second floor of the Room. Fadly tried to wake the Complainant and asked if she was alright, 22', 'but she did not respond. 23', 'As Elmi was in a rush, he left quickly thereafter 24', 'and estimated that he had only spent around one to two minutes in the Room. 25', '13\\u2003After Elmi left, Fadly and Hazly raped the Complainant in the bedroom of the second floor while she was unconscious. 26', 'As at the time of this trial, they have pleaded guilty to charges of rape and have been convicted and sentenced by another court.', '14\\u2003Meanwhile, at Zouk, Asep got into an altercation. His shirt was torn and thus he had to return to the Room. 27', 'He returned alone. 28', 'According to Asep, he initially sat on the sofa on the first floor. 29', 'He then went to the bathroom on the second floor. He said that he saw the Complainant seated in the bathtub, 30', 'and that she was leaning back and her legs were straight. 31', 'He soon left the bathroom and returned to the first floor. 32', 'Sometime later, Ridhwan and Faris also returned to the Room. 33', 'At this point, the persons in the Room were the three accused persons, as well as Fadly, Hazly, and the Complainant.', '15\\u2003It was undisputed that, at some point after returning from Zouk, Faris went to the bathroom on the second floor and had sexual intercourse with the Complainant. 34', 'However, issues relating to the Complainant\u2019s consent and her capacity to do so remain in contention. 35', 'In essence, the Complainant could recall little about what had occurred in the bathroom that morning, and the Prosecution\u2019s case was that she had neither the capacity to consent, nor had she in fact consented to sexual intercourse with Faris. On the other hand, Faris\u2019 account was that the Complainant had propositioned him for sex while he was in the bathroom with her, and thereafter consented to penile-vaginal intercourse with him. These events form the basis of the 4th Charge (see [3(a)] above).', '16\\u2003Subsequently, after Faris exited the bathroom alone, Asep went to use the bathroom. 36', 'Similarly, while issues relating to the Complainant\u2019s consent and her capacity to do so remain in dispute, it was not contested that, while in the bathroom with the Complainant, Asep had inserted his penis into the Complainant\u2019s mouth, and that he had also attempted to insert his penis into her vagina although he did not eventually manage to do so as he lost his erection. These events form the basis for the 6th and 7th Charges (see [4(a)] and [4(b)] above).', '17\\u2003Elmi and Izzati returned to the Room at around 5.04am while Asep and the Complainant were in the bathroom. They made their way to the second floor to use the bathroom. 37', 'They saw that the bathroom door was partially closed and one of them gave it a slight push, 38', 'causing it to swing open at a wider angle. 39', 'Elmi testified that although the bathroom was dark, he could see a reflection of Asep and the Complainant in the mirror. 40', 'According to him, the two persons were standing near the sink and facing the mirror with Asep standing behind the Complainant. 41', 'Both were topless, 42', 'though Elmi could not see if the bottom half of their bodies were also exposed. 43', 'Izzati\u2019s evidence was that from where she stood near the bathroom door, she could not see anything because the bathroom lights were switched off. 44', '18\\u2003When Elmi pushed the door open, Asep quickly pushed the door shut. 45', 'A few minutes later, Asep emerged from the bathroom alone. 46', 'Izzati then entered the bathroom. She saw the Complainant and asked Elmi to get Fadly to help the Complainant out of the bathroom. 47', 'Fadly, who was initially on the first floor, then went to the second floor, assisted the Complainant out of the bathroom, and brought her to the first floor. 48', 'The witnesses\u2019 observations of the Complainant\u2019s condition at this time are material, and I will revisit them later in the analysis (see [160]-[164] below).', '19\\u2003Eventually, the Complainant ended up lying down on the first floor near the main door of the Room. 49', 'At this point, the three accused persons, as well as Fadly and Hazly, were also on the first floor where they slept for the night. 50', 'Elmi, Izzati and another individual slept on the bed on the second floor. 51', '20\\u2003It was not in dispute that, sometime later that morning, Ridhwan, who initially slept near the spiral staircase 52', 'and later moved to sleep next to the Complainant, 53', 'had penile-vaginal intercourse with the Complainant and also sucked her nipples. These events form the basis for the 2nd and 3rd Charges (see [2(b)] and [2(c)] above), and in this regard, the contested issues again relate to the Complainant\u2019s consent and her capacity to do so. In essence, the Complainant\u2019s account was that she could remember some of these events that transpired in the living room that morning, but that she did not consent and had been too weak and confused to resist or scream at that time. On the other hand, Ridhwan claimed that the Complainant had consented to such intercourse and sexual activity with him, and had in fact initiated such activity. In addition, the 1st Charge against Ridhwan accuses him of digitally penetrating the anus of the Complainant at around the same time and location (see [2(a)] above). Ridhwan\u2019s explanation was that he had done so by mistake while trying to locate the Complainant\u2019s vagina.', '21\\u2003In addition to the charges relating to events that occurred in the bathroom, Faris was also accused of inserting his finger into the Complainant\u2019s vagina in the living room around the same time that morning as when Ridhwan committed the alleged offences mentioned above. This forms the basis of the 5th Charge against Faris (see [3(b)] above). Faris disputed that such penetration had in fact occurred. 54', '22\\u2003According to the Complainant, after the events that transpired with Ridhwan and Faris in the living room, the next thing she remembered was waking up later that morning and hearing one male person, whom she subsequently identified as Ridhwan, saying \u201cI pity her\u201d in Malay (\u201caku kesian tengok dia\u201d), and a male person whom she identified as Faris agreeing. She testified that she had pretended to sleep for a period because she wanted to know what the others were talking about, and because she felt shy, embarrassed, and disappointed. 55', 'Sometime later, she sat up and made her way to the bathroom on the second floor of the Room on her own. By that time, most of the persons in the Room were awake. The Complainant soon left the Duxton Hotel with Fadly and Hazly, who sent her to a nearby MRT station in a taxi. 56', 'From there, she made her own way home by public transport to Johor Bahru, Malaysia. 57', '23\\u2003In the ensuing period, the Complainant exchanged WhatsApp messages with some of her friends about what had allegedly happened in the morning of 26 January 2014 in the Room. Meanwhile, the accused persons and other attendees of Elmi\u2019s birthday party also exchanged messages regarding these events. These messages are material and I will elaborate on them later.', '24\\u2003Two days later, on 28 January 2014, the Complainant filed a police report 58', 'which led to the separate arrests of the three accused persons on or around 29 January 2014. 59'"}

As Aavanti\u2019s request for the trust receipt loan contains a fax header with the timestamp \u201c26-Apr-2016-13:18\u201d, the Defendant suggested that the request was made on 26 April 2016. 19', 'This is incorrect. Aavanti\u2019s request for the loan was made by way of a handwritten annotation on OCBC\u2019s request to Aavanti for payment instructions. The fax header with the 26 April 2016 timestamp states that it is from \u201cOCBC TFD\u201d and to \u201c65382183\u201d (which is Aavanti\u2019s fax number \u2013 see the letterhead on Aavanti\u2019s LOI referred to at [7] above).

First, Wham might not have  held himself  \nout as a professional journalist, blogger, commentator or authoritative news \nsource, but he did submit that he was a social activist (see Wham  Kwok Han \nJolovan at [83]). It was not Wham\u2019s  case that he had, or would have had, little \nor no influence and reach  through his Facebook profile.\n33 Second,  I do not accept  the AG\u2019s submission that the extent of \ndissemination of Wham\u2019s post was further  amplified by the two further posts \nthat Wham published  on his Facebook  profile  on 8 October 2018 and 9 October \n2018 respectively (see [10] above). While  Wham  republished the contemptuous \ncontent of Wham\u2019s post in these  two further posts, it appears to me that these \nfurther posts were for the purposes of informing the public of the status\/outcome \nof the proceedings against him for scandalising  contempt.\n34 In this case, I accept that Au Wai Pang serves as a useful  reference  for \ndetermining the appropriate sentence for Wham, since the contemptuous \nmaterial in Au Wai Pang had also been published on the Internet.\n35 In Au Wai Pang, the contemnor  was a first-time offender for \nscandalising contempt. Likewise, this is the first time that Wham is convicted \nfor scandalising contempt.\n36 However,  I am of the view that Wham\u2019s culpability and the gravity of \nhis scandalising contempt were clearly  less than the culpability of the contemnor \nin Au Wai Pang and the gravity of that scandalising contempt.  Wham\u2019s post \ncontained a bare statement  impugning the integrity and impartiality  of \nSingapore\u2019s judges (see Wham Kwok Han Jolovan at [96]). In great contrast,  \nthe contemptuous article  in Au Wai Pang  was 16 paragraphs long and was by \nfar a more targeted and detailed attack on certain  members of the judiciary. The \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nAG v Wham Kwok Han Jolovan [2019]  SGHC  111\n13entire thrust  of the article was to allege, with specificity, certain vested  and \nimproper interests on the part of these members  (see Au Wai Pang  at [48]).  \nThese allegations were also carefully  crafted  to take the form of insinuations as \nopposed to express  views,  thereby making the article even more insidious (see \nAu Wai Pang  at [48], [54]).\n37 On the other hand, Wham did not show any remorse for his post as he \nrefused to remove  it from his Facebook profile  and refused to apologise  for his \npost even after conviction. In Au Wai Pang , the contemnor apparently removed \nhis contemptuous article  from his blog after the court granted leave to the AG \nto apply for an order of committal against him. The contemnor  there also \napologised (see Au Wai Pang at  [10]).\n38 In Au Wai Pang, the contemnor was  sentenced  to a fine of $8,000.\n39 In my view, a sentence of a fine of $5,000, with one week\u2019s \nimprisonment in default,  would be appropriate for Wham for the offence  of \nscandalising contempt under s 3(1)(a) of the Act in the circumstances. The fine \nis to be paid within  eight  days from and including the date of this  judgment.\nNotice to apologise\n40 In addition  to any punishment imposed under  s 12(1) of the Act, the \ncourt may also make an order under  s 12(3) that a contemnor publish  a notice \nto apologise for his contemptuous publication.  The relevant provisions in \nrelation to an apology are  ss 12(2) to 12(5) which state:\nPunishment for contempt of court\n\u2026\n(2) In addition to any punishment imposed under \nsubsection (1), where  a person has committed contempt in \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nAG v Wham Kwok Han Jolovan [2019]  SGHC  111\n14relation to the proceedings before a court, the court may refuse \nto hear the person until the contempt is purged or the person \nsubmits to the order  or direction of the court  or an apology is \nmade to the satisfaction of the court.\n(3) In addition to any punishment imposed under \nsubsection (1), the court may, on its own motion or on \napplication by the applicant in the contempt  proceedings, make \nan order that the person  who has committed contempt must  \npublish such notice, and in such manner,  as the court  thinks \nnecessary to apologise for the contemptuous  publication.\n(4) An order  under subsection  (3) may be made  subject to such \nexceptions or conditions (including the duration for which  the \nnotification must be made accessible to members of the public)  \nas may be specified in the order.\n(5) Despite subsection (1), the court may discharge the person \nwho has committed contempt or remit the punishment or any \npart of it on his or her purging  of the contempt, submission to \nthe order or direction of the court or on apology being  made to \nthe satisfaction  of the court.\n\u2026\n41 Where a contemnor refuses  to purge  his contempt, whether in refusing \nto apologise or in refusing to remove his contemptuous publication, a question \nmay arise as to whether  the court should make  an order under s 12(3) for him to \npublish a notice to apologise.  It is clear  that the purpose of making such an order \nis not to extract  a sincere apology from such a contemnor since if he were \nsincere about it, he need not be compelled to apologise. The question then is \nunder what  circumstances  the court should make such an order.\n42 I do not agree with the AG\u2019s submission  that there should be a general  \napproach to order a contemnor  to publish  a notice to apologise to purge  his \ncontempt if he failed to do so voluntarily. Just because the court now has the \npower to make such an order  under s 12(3) does not mean that the court should \ngenerally exercise it as long as the contemnor does not apologise.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nAG v Wham Kwok Han Jolovan [2019]  SGHC  111\n1543 Seen in this light, whilst purging the contempt of a contemnor  may be \none of the intended effects  of an order under s 12(3), I do not think that the \noverriding concern of s 12(3) is to purge  such contempt. Prior to the Act, there \ndid not seem to have been a need for a contemnor to purge his scandalising \ncontempt by apologising for it. The AG did not refer the court to the \nparliamentary debates to show  that Parliament considered  that there  was such a \nnecessity when enacting  the Act, or that Parliament generally intended  for a \ncontemnor to purge his scandalising  contempt  by apologising for it.\n44 After all, a contemnor\u2019s failure  to purge  his scandalising  contempt,  \nwhich also evidences  his lack of remorse,  is a factor the court takes  into account  \nwhen sentencing him.\n45 In so far as a notice to apologise published  in the same manner as the \ncontemptuous publication may be efficacious  in informing that target  audience \nthat the contemptuous publication is scandalising  contempt, this has to be \nweighed against the factor that the contemnor  has refused  to purge his \nscandalising contempt. It seems meaningless to order  a contemnor to apologise  \nwhen the apology would not be sincere.\n46 Furthermore,  if a contemnor refused to publish a notice  to apologise as \nordered by the court, he might further be liable  for an act of contempt of court, \nand more time and resources may have to be spent to commence proceedings \nagainst him again.  This may result in a disproportionate use of such time and \nresources as compared with the original offence.\n47 In Re Ouellet (Nos 1 and 2) (1977) 72 DLR (3d) 95 at 100, \nTremblay CJQ (in the Quebec Court of"}

The Conditions of Contract for the Bishopsgate project included the following cl 2.3.1:', '17\\u2003On 20 May 2010, the plaintiff issued a letter of award to CCM, confirming \u201cacceptance of [the] company as the Sub-Contractor to design, carry out, bring to [completion] & maintain the proposed condominium housing development \u2026 for the sub-contract sum of $51,343,900.00\u201d. According to Mr Lim Soon Hock, the plaintiff\u2019s contracts manager, the difference between the subcontract sum of approximately $51m and the tender price of $58.5m represented the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cprofit margin and the costs for providing our management staff and other expenses required for the successful completion of the project.\u201d', '18\\u2003On 2 July 2010, Mr Gen Yasuda of Kajima (\u201cMr Yasuda\u201d) sent a letter to the second defendant, reiterating that the plaintiff was not allowed to subcontract the whole of the works for the Bishopsgate project, referring to the aforementioned cl 2.3.1 (see [16] above). This letter was prompted by a prospectus that CCM had lodged with the Monetary Authority of Singapore and SGX, and released to the general public for the purpose of its proposed listing, which Mr Yasuda described as \u201cwritten in such a manner that everybody would be made to believe CCM is the main contractor of our project\u201d. Mr Yasuda said that the \u201cimpression of letting our main contractor sub-contract the whole of the Works is detrimental to our business in terms of reputation and sales, amongst other aspects\u201d. Mr Yasuda went on to say that \u201cthe only way to stop the rumours and control the damage is to totally disconnect CCM from the project\u201d, and requested the plaintiff to \u201cremove CCM from the project altogether\u201d.', '19\\u2003It was recorded in the minutes of a subsequent site meeting in July 2010 that the plaintiff would progressively phase out CCM\u2019s involvement in the Bishopsgate project, and Mr Lim Soon Hock was recorded as agreeing to do so by end of July 2010. It is not in dispute that this was not done until one year later. It should be noted that there was no attempt by the first to third defendants or CCM to convince Mr Yasuda that his view that the plaintiff had contracted the whole of the Works to CCM was inaccurate.', '20\\u2003In August 2011, the second defendant emailed the first defendant stating the following:', 'The first defendant, and the second and third third parties gave their approval for the settlement with CCM proposed in the email. As evident from the above, this settlement was for the sum of $2m, which included outstanding payment for work done and retention sums, as well as a \u201ccompensation\/ex-gratia payment for cessation of complete Site execution and operation\u201d of $498,134.17. CCM\u2019s involvement with the Bishopsgate project ceased in or around August 2011 after the settlement sum of $2m was paid.', '21\\u2003In March 2013, Prime gave notice to terminate the plaintiff\u2019s employment as main contractor for the Bishopsgate project.', '22\\u2003In December 2009, the plaintiff tendered for the condominium project at Goodwood Residences (\u201cthe Goodwood project\u201d) at a price of $191.93m. The tender was signed by the first and second defendants. The developer accepted the tender in the same month. The developer of the Goodwood project was Goodwood Residences Pte Ltd, a subsidiary of Guocoland. The contract period for the completion of the project was 30 months.', '23\\u2003By December 2011, it was clear that the project was in severe delay, as the completion date was merely six months away and much of the contract works had yet to be completed. The plaintiff had up to that point made progress claims amounting to only 30 percent of the total contract sum. It should be noted the plaintiff does not allege that the first and second defendants were responsible for this delay.', '24\\u2003In an attempt to resolve the issue, in March 2012, the third defendant was appointed as the project manager of the Goodwood project with the responsibility of overseeing the daily operations of the project. With the approval of the first and second defendants, the third defendant engaged Reinforced Concrete (\u201cRC\u201d) subcontractors to provide casual labourers and supervisors for the Goodwood project at an hourly rate of $12 per hour for each labourer and $15 per hour for each supervisor.', '25\\u2003In April 2010, the first defendant entered into an option to purchase a unit in Goodwood Residences (\u201cthe Goodwood unit\u201d) for a purchase price of $8.68m. In July 2013, the first defendant sold the property at a price of $10.6m. On the plaintiff\u2019s case, the purchase of the Goodwood unit was not disclosed to the plaintiff\u2019s board at any time, whereas it is the first defendant\u2019s pleaded case that this purchase was disclosed to Mr M Rajaram, UFS\u2019s non-executive Chairman, and Mr Hoshi Deboo, a UFS director.', '26\\u2003In March 2013, the second third party made an application to court for the plaintiff to be placed under JM. According to the second defendant, the second third party had called him from the airport and asked him to shut the gates on the Goodwood project without disclosing the application for JM. The second defendant said that the news of the application came as a surprise to him.', '27\\u2003In the affidavit filed in support of the application, the second third party opined that the plaintiff was or would be unable to pay its debts and was cash flow insolvent, and that placing the plaintiff under JM would promote its survival as a going concern and\/or achieve a more advantageous realisation of its assets than in a winding up.', '28\\u2003Mr Tam Chee Chong and Mr Andrew Grimmett were appointed as joint and several interim judicial managers following the second third party\u2019s application, and thereafter joint and several judicial managers in April 2013. Subsequently, on the direction of this court in June 2014, the judicial managers called a meeting of creditors to put to vote a resolution on whether legal proceedings should be commenced against the first to third defendants. The vote was carried, resulting in the present proceedings.', '29\\u2003On 10 October 2014, the JM order was discharged and the plaintiff was placed in liquidation.'"}

There was some dispute as to Sim\u2019s precise status in the firm but we proceed on the basis that he was engaged as an employee, which was the respondent\u2019s position. It should be noted that this was the first time the respondent would be working with Sim as he had met Sim just in or around January that year. It would also be the first time the respondent would be managing and running a conveyancing department. Prior to this, the respondent practised principally in litigation with some limited experience in transactional and conveyancing work.', '3\\u2003Between June 2011 and March 2012, the respondent permitted Sim to interact directly with the firm\u2019s conveyancing clients, most of whom had evidently been introduced to the firm by Sim in any case, and to liaise with them on payment matters including the collection of payments for stamp duty and other conveyancing moneys. Unbeknownst to the respondent, Sim used the opportunity he was afforded during this period to commit cheating and\/or criminal breach of trust offences in respect of conveyancing moneys he collected from 17 clients, and misappropriated a total sum of $848,335.09. Amongst other things, Sim falsely informed these clients that he had made payments for stamp duty and other conveyancing-related fees on their behalf.', '4\\u2003Also within this period, specifically between 31 August 2011 and 19 October 2011, the respondent caused conveyancing moneys amounting to $448,803, paid by 22 clients, to be paid into the firm\u2019s office account. It was accepted by the respondent that these moneys should not have been paid into the firm\u2019s office account but we were told that this had been done because those managing the accounts were under the mistaken impression that it was permissible to do so as long as these payments were effectively to reimburse payments that had already been made on behalf of the clients in question. Accordingly, a substantial portion of these moneys was then paid out to Sim personally who represented to the firm that he had already made payments out of his own funds in respect of the stamp duty payments that were due from the clients. In truth, most of these representations were false; Sim had not in fact made payments out of his own funds and the clients had submitted the cheques to the firm to enable the firm to make the stamp duty payments for them, but Sim produced forged stamp duty certificates to mislead the firm and thereby obtain payments purportedly by way of reimbursement.'"}

The victim is his wife, who was residing with him at the material time of the offences. In the court below, he pleaded guilty to one charge under s 65(8) of the Women\u2019s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) for contravening a Personal Protection Order (\u201cPPO\u201d), and one charge under s 323 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) for voluntarily causing hurt to his wife. One other charge under s 65(8) of the Women\u2019s Charter and one other charge under s 323 of the Penal Code were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. At the time of the offences, the Respondent was subject to a PPO under s 65 of the Women\u2019s Charter, issued on 18 September 2014, which restrained the Respondent from using family violence against his wife.', '3\\u2003The offences took place in the home of the Respondent and his wife. The Statement of Facts stated that in the early morning of 1 February 2018, the Respondent returned home, intoxicated. The wife was in the bedroom with their five-year-old daughter when the Respondent entered at about 2.30am and grabbed the blanket away from his wife. He grabbed her right leg and bit it. These facts formed the subject matter of the charge under s 65(8) of the Women\u2019s Charter which the Respondent pleaded guilty to and the charge under s 323 of the Penal Code that was taken into consideration.', '4\\u2003About 10 minutes later, the wife asked the Respondent to wash up because he smelled of alcohol. The Respondent responded strangely by rolling around on the bed. Worried for their daughter, the wife brought her out of the bedroom into the living room. The Respondent followed them out and an argument ensued between the Respondent and his wife. The argument became heated and the Respondent threw several punches at his wife. The wife got hold of an umbrella that was near her and attempted to use it to block these punches. However, the Respondent managed to land a punch on his wife\u2019s left cheek. The attack did not stop there. The Respondent grabbed the umbrella away from his wife and swung it at her, using it to hit her on both flanks. These facts formed the subject matter of the charge under s 323 of the Penal Code which the Respondent pleaded guilty to and the charge under s 65(8) of the Women\u2019s Charter that was taken into consideration.', '5\\u2003Their daughter informed the Respondent\u2019s father about the incident after witnessing it. The Respondent\u2019s father, who was also residing in the flat, tried to separate the Respondent and his wife. The wife tried to call the police with her hand-phone but the Respondent snatched it from her and threw it on the floor before she could make the call. The wife fled from the flat with the daughter and then called the police. She was found to suffer from \u201ctenderness over her left cheek, forehead, left side of neck and left chest wall with thoracic region\u201d as a result of the Respondent\u2019s attacks. She was discharged with medication for the contusions. Since then, she has been seeking refuge at a community shelter and has not returned home to live with the Respondent.'"}
{"casename":"2019_SGHC_12","fact":"facts,  the Law Society applied  for an order pursuant  to s 94A \nand s 98 of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 2009 Rev Ed) (\u201cLPA\u201d) that Ms \nJaya Anil Kumar be dealt with under  s 83 of the LPA. Counsel for Ms Jaya Anil \nKumar accepts that due cause is shown on the facts as set out above and seeks \nonly to address the  Court on the appropriate sanction.\n3 Her counsel urges this Court to order \u201ca longer suspension\u201d instead  of \nstriking her off as an advocate and solicitor. He accepts  that her misconduct was \n\u201cgrave and indefensible\u201d  but submits that she was young and inexperienced at \nthe time of the offences and that her misconduct  committed early in her legal \ncareer did not by itself indicate an irredeemable character defect that renders her \npermanently unsuitable for the legal  profession. \n4 As for youthfulness, we believe  that any law student  or young law \ngraduate would know that forgery of documents is dishonesty  and is a crime.  \nMs Jaya Anil Kumar may have  been  inexperienced in January  2013 but we are \nlooking at deliberate  criminal acts here,  not incompetence or error of judgment. \nAlthough she did not get a job with the Singapore  Legal Service, she had gone \nthrough an interview  with the LSC with her grades  in 21 out of 27 subjects \nfalsified to show better grades than the actual results. \n5 On top of this, more than three years  after the first dishonest act, she \nrepeated and compounded her criminal  conduct  by submitting the said forged \nacademic documents in May 2016 to R&T Asia Resources Pte Ltd and then in \nOctober 2016 to the LSC again. These were done with the hope of improving \nher chances  of obtaining a  job with the  respective entities.\n6 Her conduct shows a consistent trend of resorting to dishonest means  to \ntry to get what she wants as a career. Upon the inconsistency in the documents \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLaw Society of  Singapore v Jaya Anil Kumar [2019]  SGHC  12\n3being noticed, she was not upfront and tried to avoid detection by not giving her \nconsent to the LSC to make enquiries with the NUS. Next, she gave  the excuse  \nthat she \u201cmis-scanned\u201d and might have  mixed up her documents with those of \nher friend.  Her \u201cvoluntary\u201d  sending of the genuine  academic documents to the \nLSC after all these does little to mitigate the persistent criminal conduct.\n7 In our opinion, her conduct  falls plainly  within the first category  of cases \nmentioned by an earlier Court in Law Society of Singapore v Chia Choon Yang \n[2018] 5 SLR 1068. The Court in that case stated at [39] of the judgment that \nmisconduct involving dishonesty will almost invariably warrant  an order for \nstriking off where the dishonesty reveals a character defect rendering  the errant \nsolicitor unsuitable for the profession and that this would typically be the case \nwhere the dishonesty  is integral to the commission of a criminal offence of \nwhich the solicitor has been convicted.  We do not see how being consumed \nabout wanting  a particular career mitigates the offences of forgery of one\u2019s \nacademic credentials. \n8 On the above facts,  due cause under s 83 of the LPA  has clearly been \nshown. We find that there are no exceptional circumstances justifying  any \nsanction other than the ultimate one of striking off. We therefore think that \nstriking off is the  only appropriate sanction here.\n9 We are sad that we have to come  to this conclusion but we are \nconstrained by the facts  and the criminal  acts which have been acknowledged \nto be \u201cgrave  and indefensible\u201d. However, we are certainly not saying that Ms \nJaya Anil Kumar is irredeemably dishonest.  Everyone can repent  and change. \nDuring the coming years, she will have to re-order  her young life, re-focus  on \nwhat is truly important,  show the fruits of repentance and make a good case for \nthe Court to reinstate her as  an advocate  and solicitor sometime in the  future.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLaw Society of  Singapore v Jaya Anil Kumar [2019]  SGHC  12\n410 The Law Society  has asked  for $6,000 as the costs and disbursements \nfor this application.  Counsel  for Ms Jaya Anil Kumar leaves the question of \ncosts to the Court.

The applicant\u2019s  mother could still visit \nhim physically or by video-link. His present intention to be a filial son could  not \ntake precedence over the past criminal  conduct that he had been accused  of and \nthe indisputable fact that he absconded from  Singapore instead of facing the \ncharges in Court.  His \u201clong term\u201d girlfriend was someone with whom he had a \nsteady relationship  from 2017.  If she was willing to marry him and then wait \nfor him while  he served a possible long term of imprisonment, then logically, \nshe should be equally  willing  to wait for him to complete his imprisonment \nbefore marrying  him. It might even  be argued  that it would be irresponsible for \nthe applicant as a husband and a father  to have a baby just before serving a \npossible long term of imprisonment. His girlfriend  could take care of his mother \nif she wished, even without being married to him.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nShanker Maghalingam v  PP [2019]  SGHC  120\n610 As for the applicant\u2019s claim  that he was not a flight  risk, his previous \nconduct spoke much  more  loudly and clearly than his mere words.

{"casename":"2019_SGHC_121","fact":"'2\\u2003The plaintiff, Innovative Corporation Pte Ltd, was incorporated in Singapore on 16 August 2004. 1', 'From its inception, Ms Annie Chen Liping (\u201cMs Chen\u201d), was a director, major shareholder and served as the company\u2019s major decision-maker. 2', 'Ms Chen emigrated from the People\u2019s Republic of China to Singapore in 1995 and became a Singapore citizen. Prior to her move to Singapore, she worked with a state-sponsored building construction company in Tianjin, China, known as Tianjin Heping Construction Group Co Ltd, (\u201cTHC\u201d), on several construction projects in China. THC was established in 1952 and its total assets are in the region of S$85 million. 3', 'It is also registered in Singapore as a foreign company.', '3\\u2003Ms Chen maintained her association with THC after her move to Singapore. On 13 June 2001, she incorporated China Heping Construction (Far East) Pte Ltd (\u201cCHC\u201d) as THC\u2019s Singapore subsidiary and assumed the position of its managing director. 4', 'As already mentioned, the plaintiff was later incorporated. Initially, the plaintiff\u2019s business was to organise events to introduce investors from China to potential business opportunities and investments in Singapore. The focus of the plaintiff\u2019s business later shifted to property development and building construction, which is similar to that of CHC\u2019s. 5', '4\\u2003The first defendant, Mr Ow Chun Ming, also known as Mr Victor Ow, is a real estate developer with 30 years of experience in the industry. He is the Chairman and CEO of the Clydesbuilt Group of companies, including the second defendant, which was incorporated on 17 May 2010 for the purpose of developing the project which is the subject matter of this action. 6', 'The first defendant also became a director and the 50% shareholder of the plaintiff in circumstances which will be explained in the course of this judgment. He has since ceased to be a shareholder and a director, although the date of when he stopped being a director of the plaintiff is a matter of some dispute in this case.', '5\\u2003The Fong Yun Thai Association (\u201cFYTA\u201d) is an umbrella organisation made up of three Hakka clan associations \u2013 Foong Shoon Fui Kuan Association, Char Yong (Dabu) Association and Eng Teng Association. 7', 'FYTA is managed by its board of directors comprising representatives from all three of these associations. At the material time, FYTA\u2019s principal asset was the property at 33 Holland Link in Singapore. This land was registered in the names of four trustees, who held it for FYTA\u2019s benefit. 8', '6\\u2003In late 2007, FYTA decided to embark on a project to build a residential housing development on the land which would comprise of 82 units of semi-detached houses and a Hakka Memorial Museum and Cultural Centre (\u201cthe Project\u201d). 9', 'FYTA\u2019s construction committee was overseeing the Project. Mr Liu Cho Chit (\u201cMr Liu\u201d) was the chairman of the construction committee. 10', 'Mr Liu is a retired property developer with business interests in Singapore and elsewhere. He has been involved with FYTA for more than 20 years. He is a former president of FYTA and was also one of the four trustees in which title to the land was registered. At the material time, he was an honorary president of Foong Shoon Fui Kuan Association.', '7\\u2003I should just mention here that parties have also sometimes referred to the construction committee as the \u201cProject committee\u201d. After Mr Liu resigned from the construction committee and it was then dissolved in February 2010, the new committee formed by FYTA to oversee the Project was consistently referred to by parties as the \u201cProject committee\u201d.', '8\\u2003FYTA appointed ATI Architects (\u201cATI\u201d) for the Project. ATI prepared a proposal for the Project which was submitted to the authorities for planning approval. On 6 March 2008, the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Singapore (\u201cURA\u201d) approved ATI\u2019s proposal and FYTA was granted Provisional Permission (\u201cPP\u201d). 11', 'As things turned out, the PP had to be extended three times for six months each because Written Permission for the Project was not obtained until sometime in the second half of 2010. The final extension of six months was granted by URA following a meeting on 2 March 2010, which will be explained later in this judgment. 12', '9\\u2003In late 2008 or early 2009, Ms Chen was introduced as a representative of THC to Mr Liu. She learnt about the Project from Mr Liu and told him that she was interested in taking on the Project with THC as the developer. 13', 'Negotiations followed. Mr Liu, the architect from ATI and other members of FYTA, that is, Mr Chan Sen Meng (\u201cMr Chan\u201d), Mr Ho Kiau Seng (\u201cMr Ho\u201d) and Mr Lew Chee Beng (\u201cMr Lew\u201d), travelled to Tianjin, China and visited THC for meetings to assess THC\u2019s capability. They met with Mr Chen Xin, one of THC\u2019s directors. 14', 'I pause here to mention that Mr Chan was the president of Eng Teng Association and a vice-president of FYTA. Mr Lew was the president of Char Yong (Dabu) Association and the other vice-president of FYTA. Mr Ho was the president of Foong Shoon Fui Kuan Association, and also the president of FYTA. In short, the three most senior officer-bearers in the FYTA travelled to China to visit THC, together with Mr Liu, who headed the construction committee. Ms Chen did not travel with them to China for this trip.', '10\\u2003The discussions culminated in an agreement in Chinese titled \u201cCooperation Agreement\u201d signed on 9 July 2009 (the \u201cCooperation Agreement\u201d). The Cooperation Agreement was signed on behalf of FYTA by its president and vice-presidents (Messrs Ho, Lew and Chan). Mr Chen Xin signed on behalf of THC. 15', 'The Cooperation Agreement was a brief one-page document stating that the parties \u201cagree to jointly develop\u201d the Project. 16', 'FYTA was required to obtain all the necessary approvals for the Project. The construction work would be carried out by CHC, which was described as a subsidiary of THC. The Project cost was stated to be S$115 million, and it was expected to be completed in two and a half years. There was also a statement that, of the 82 units of semi-detached houses to be constructed, FYTA would be allocated ownership of 27 units, and THC allocated 55 units. The Cooperation Agreement ended with, \u201c[o]ther matters not discussed in this agreement shall be negotiated separately. This agreement (\u2026) shall become effective on the date of signing\u201d.', '11\\u2003In his evidence, Mr Liu explained FYTA\u2019s thinking behind the Cooperation Agreement. He said that the idea was that FYTA would not have to mortgage the land at 33 Holland Link for financing, so the developer who partnered with them, that is, THC, would have to finance the entire cost of the Project. In return, it would be given 55 units of the semi-detached houses to be built. This was why the allocation of the units was provided for in the Cooperation Agreement, and it was also stated that \u201c[FYTA] shall not mortgage the property nor incur debts\u201d.', '12\\u2003At a meeting of the board of directors of FYTA, an update was given to them on the Cooperation Agreement. The minutes of the meeting record Mr Chan as saying that \u201c[FYTA] cannot be developer itself. Therefore [FYTA] entrusted the entire development project to the developer \u2013 [THC]\u201d. 17', 'In the same minutes, it was also recorded that \u201c[w]ith regard to the cooperation agreement with [THC], the directors who attended do not have any opinion, they unanimously approved it\u201d. 18', '13\\u2003Following the signing of the Cooperation Agreement, preparatory works started at the site. By a letter of award dated 16 July 2009, ATI engaged CHC to undertake the excavation works which commenced on or around 17 August 2009. 19', '14\\u2003Not long after, as Mr Liu explained, FYTA\u2019s lawyers advised them that it would be better for a Singapore company to be the developer of the Project instead of THC. This was because it would be more convenient legally and administratively to deal with a local entity. 20', 'THC and Ms Chen were informed of this. Mr Chen Xin then signed a letter of authority on behalf of THC which \u201cirrevocably authorise[d] and directe[d]\u201d FYTA to deal with the plaintiff and Ms Chen in place of THC. 21', 'Ms Chen explained that THC had decided that the plaintiff would be used as the vehicle to collaborate with FYTA on the Project.', '15\\u2003Following this, a document titled \u201cJoint Venture Agreement\u201d dated 23 September 2009 (\u201cJoint Venture Agreement\u201d) was drafted. 22', 'This was in English. The plaintiff was identified in the Joint Venture Agreement as the developer appointed by THC. 23', 'The stated counterparties were three of the four trustees of the land. The Joint Venture Agreement referred to the parties\u2019 intention to \u201center into a joint venture\u201d and documented additional details as to the Project\u2019s scope, the period of completion and the management of the Project. The Joint Venture Agreement was never executed formally by the parties. There was no evidence before me showing that the plaintiff had executed it and, of the three named trustees, only Mr Liu signed it.', '16\\u2003For reasons which are not entirely clear, Messrs Lew, Ho and Chan, who signed the Cooperation Agreement, also appended their signatures to the Joint Venture Agreement although it is not stated in the document in what capacity they were doing so. In my view, they probably did so to acknowledge their agreement to the terms of that document. Subsequently, in the period from November 2009 to January 2010, several other drafts of a more detailed Joint Venture Agreement were prepared and exchanged between FYTA and the plaintiff but they too were never executed.', '17\\u2003Ms Chen first met the first defendant in or around 2006 through a mutual friend. 24', 'According the first defendant, Ms Chen had expressed interest in being a sub-contractor for one of his construction projects, but this did not come to fruition. He also gave evidence that, in or around 2007, he sought Ms Chen\u2019s help for a contact in Tianjin, China, because he was encountering some difficulties in one of his projects there. Thereafter, they did not keep in touch.', '18\\u2003Sometime in September 2009, the first defendant drove by the site of the Project on his way home. He lived nearby at his bungalow on Old Holland Road. He saw Ms Chen there. She was supervising the land excavation works which were underway. He stopped to speak to her and she briefly told him about the Project. 25', 'It is not disputed that the pair subsequently met at his home to talk about the Project in more detail, although the first defendant\u2019s evidence was that Ms Chen showed up at his home uninvited.', '19\\u2003In their discussion, the first defendant found out more about the Project. Ms Chen showed him the Joint Venture Agreement, but not the Cooperation Agreement because it was in Chinese, and the first defendant could not read Chinese. 26', 'The first defendant discovered that the plaintiff did not have a housing developer\u2019s licence and requisite approvals from the relevant regulatory authorities had not been sought. 27', 'According to him, he gave friendly advice to Mr Chen in the form of a Chinese saying, which translates to \u201cdon\u2019t wear such a big hat if your head is not big enough\u201d. 28', 'He explained in his evidence that what he meant was that she should not be taking on such a significant project on her own without the proper experience and qualifications.', '20\\u2003Nevertheless, sensing a good business opportunity, the first defendant suggested collaborating with the plaintiff as a joint venture partner. 29', 'He was offering to extend his expertise as a developer to Ms Chen and the plaintiff to help see this Project through. Ms Chen\u2019s evidence was that she was impressed by the first defendant\u2019s experience and knowledge of the industry. She had a high regard for him and believed that he was sincere.', '21\\u2003Talks continued between Ms Chen and the first defendant. Eventually, the first defendant set out the terms of his proposal for a 50% stake in the plaintiff in an email to Ms Chen dated 4 December 2009: 30', '22\\u2003Ms Chen agreed to his proposal. She believed that he would a \u201cvaluable partner\u201d. 31', 'Things then moved quickly. The first defendant advised that the plaintiff sign a more comprehensive agreement than the Joint Venture Agreement and instructed his lawyer, Ms Maria Anne Ng (\u201cMs Ng\u201d), to assist with the documentation. 32', 'Ms Ng sent a revised draft of the Joint Venture Agreement (\u201crevised JVA\u201d) to the first defendant and Ms Chen. 33', 'Ms Ng also prepared a letter of authority for THC to expressly authorise the first defendant to deal with the plaintiff as a \u201cjoint venture partner\u201d on a 50% basis. 34', 'This was executed by Mr Chen Xin on behalf of THC.', '23\\u2003Following this, in December 2009, the first defendant executed his consent to act as a director for the plaintiff and also the share transfer as transferee of half of the issued capital of the plaintiff. The first defendant\u2019s evidence was that he believed that he already became a director and shareholder of the plaintiff in December 2009. 35', 'But, the first defendant was actually reflected as a director of the plaintiff in the records only on 18 February 2010 when the relevant forms were lodged with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (\u201cACRA\u201d). On 24 February 2010, he was transferred 500,000 shares in the plaintiff, which was 50% of the company\u2019s issued share capital. 36', 'It appears to me that the delay in registering the first defendant as a shareholder and director was probably because the first defendant had agreed to contribute S$500,000 for the increase in the share capital of the company but he never did so. 37', 'When the first defendant became the plaintiff\u2019s shareholder, the other two shareholders in the plaintiff were Ms Chen and one Mr Wayne Yang (\u201cMr Yang\u201d), each holding 40% and 10% of the shareholding in the plaintiff respectively.', '24\\u2003Towards the end of 2009, FYTA expressed concerns over the progress of the Project. In December 2009, FYTA terminated ATI\u2019s retainer, bringing work on the Project to a halt.', '25\\u2003In the meantime, several drafts of the revised JVA (prepared by Ms Ng) were exchanged between FYTA and the plaintiff but none were actually executed. 38', 'As mentioned earlier, Ms Chen\u2019s and the first defendant\u2019s plan was to negotiate and sign a more comprehensive agreement with FYTA to set out parties\u2019 respective obligations in relation to the Project. Mr Liu gave evidence that FYTA had also appointed lawyers to work on finalising the revised JVA to be executed. There was a time-sensitive element to these discussions as the PP was due to expire in March 2010 and work would have to recommence before then. Otherwise, there was a risk that the PP would not be extended by the URA.', '26\\u2003On 1 January 2010, the first defendant left Singapore for a five-week holiday to Paris. In his absence, Ms Chen continued negotiations with FYTA. However, this was hampered by internal disputes that had arisen within FYTA. Mr Liu\u2019s influence as the construction committee chairman had waned in the past few months. He formally resigned as the chairman on 11 February 2010 and stepped down from the construction committee, which was then dissolved. 39', 'He gave evidence that there was a new president of FYTA and the members of FYTA were not cooperating with him. He testified that ATI\u2019s services as the Project architect had been terminated without any good reason, and without his approval.', '27\\u2003A new \u201cProject committee\u201d was formed, headed by Mr Leow Soon Guan (\u201cMr Leow\u201d). 40', 'This committee began to express reservations over the competency of the plaintiff as the developer for the Project. 41', 'The main concern expressed was about Ms Chen\u2019s and the plaintiff\u2019s experience to take on the Project. FYTA had also discovered, in or around October 2009, that the plaintiff\u2019s paid-up capital was S$100,000, which was well below the requisite S$1 million required for a housing developer\u2019s licence. 42', 'This was another sticking point in their discussions as FYTA believed that Ms Chen had misrepresented her credentials and experience in real estate development. 43', 'In response to this, on 11 January 2010, the plaintiff\u2019s issued share capital was increased to S$1 million through cash injections from Ms Chen and Mr Yang. 44', 'There was evidence to the effect that Mr Yang had paid S$500,000 for the issuance of 500,000 shares intended for the first defendant, but which were first allotted to Ms Chen and then later transferred by her to the first defendant.', '28\\u2003Discussions over emails while the first defendant was away in Paris between him and Ms Chen showed that she was increasingly disheartened by the change in attitude by FYTA. 45', 'She was afraid that the plaintiff might lose the deal. The first defendant encouraged her in his emails. In one email, he stated that \u201c[w]e, are very close to an agreement, I hope you will be able to persuade the Association Committee as to our seriousness, sincerity and commitment and hope for their cooperation. We are near and yet so far\u201d. 46', 'In another email, he told Ms Chen \u201c[w]e are almost there\u201d. 47', 'He explained in his evidence that his main concern at that stage was to get a Joint Venture Agreement that was \u201cbankable\u201d, meaning that the plaintiff would be able to rely on it to raise financing. In the meantime, even though he was overseas, the first defendant started reaching out to several banks to seek possible avenues of financing for the Project. 48', '29\\u2003Ms Chen had a lunch meeting with FYTA\u2019s new Project committee on 11 February 2010, where she met Mr Leow for the first time. Mr Leow\u2019s evidence is that, on questioning Ms Chen on her experience during the lunch, she admitted that she did not have any experience in local residential development projects. Ms Chen\u2019s evidence was that she told Mr Leow about THC\u2019s capabilities and that the plaintiff could carry out the Project with THC\u2019s support. She also mentioned that she had a local partner, although she did not mention the first defendant by name.', '30\\u2003Ms Chen and the first defendant agreed that he should meet with FYTA upon his return to Singapore to salvage the plaintiff\u2019s chances of getting FYTA to appoint it as the developer for the Project. Ms Chen introduced the first defendant at a lunch with FYTA\u2019s representatives on 24 February 2010 as one of her friends who was a developer. He was seated next to Mr Leow during the lunch which was at Raffles Town Club. According to Mr Liu, Ms Chen said that the first defendant was a potential partner for the Project. I should mention that it does not appear from the evidence that, during this lunch, the first defendant\u2019s involvement with the plaintiff as its 50% shareholder and director was revealed to FYTA\u2019s representatives.', '31\\u2003After lunch, the first defendant showed FYTA\u2019s representatives around a project he had recently completed at 18 Lornie Road (\u201cLornie 18\u201d). 49', 'His evidence was that this was a way to try to help the plaintiff get appointed as the developer of the Project. 50', 'I would just observe here that this must surely mean that there was must have been suggestion at the lunch that the first defendant might be partnering with Ms Chen for the Project. Two to three days after the lunch, some FYTA representatives, including Mr Leow, also visited the first defendant at his newly renovated bungalow, which was just a stone\u2019s throw away from the Project site. On both the visit to Lornie 18 and to the first defendant\u2019s home, Ms Chen was not present.', '32\\u2003According to the first defendant\u2019s evidence, while at his home, Mr Leow and Mr Lew suddenly told him that FYTA wanted him to bid for the role as developer for the Project. It appeared that FYTA was going to invite for tenders from developers for the Project despite their arrangements with the plaintiff. The first defendant\u2019s evidence was that he was happy to hear that FYTA was going to invite him to bid, but he told them he was going to tender with the plaintiff. He was then told unequivocally by Mr Leow that, if he colluded with or worked with Ms Chen, he would not be considered. To this, the first defendant then said to FYTA representatives that he would proceed on his own to bid for the Project. He did this because, in his words, \u201c[he is] a businessman\u201d 51', ', and he knew that the plaintiff had no chance of getting the Project.', '33\\u2003I should add that the first defendant\u2019s account of what happened at his home and his discussions there with FYTA\u2019s representatives was disputed by Mr Leow, who was called as a witness by the defendants. According to Mr Leow, there was no such visit by FYTA\u2019s representatives to the first defendant\u2019s home at all. His evidence was that, after the lunch on 24 February 2010, the first defendant had phoned him two days later and expressed an interest in becoming the developer for the Project. This is a point I will come back to later in this judgment.', '34\\u2003Within a week of that lunch meeting, on 2 March 2010, Mr Leow and the first defendant attended a meeting with the URA to seek the approval for the PP to be extended by another six months. 52', 'The first defendant brought his architect, Mr Ho Seow Hui (\u201cMr Ho\u201d), along to assist in the process. According to Mr Ho\u2019s evidence, Mr Leow did most of the talking at the meeting. Mr Leow was trying to convince the URA that the work at the Project site, which had stalled, would be proceeding again soon. The suggestion was that the first defendant would be on board as the new developer and Mr Ho the new architect. Effectively, the new project development team was being presented to the URA. 53', 'Ultimately, the URA agreed to extend the PP by another six months.', '35\\u2003It was clear that, by this time, FYTA did not wish go ahead with the plaintiff as the developer for the Project. The plaintiff accepts that, by the end of February 2010 and in early March 2010, Mr Leow had suggested to Ms Chen on more than one occasion that the plaintiff should voluntarily withdraw from the Project. 54', 'On 27 March 2010, Mr Leow sent Ms Chen an email attaching a draft termination agreement to be executed by THC and the plaintiff. 55', 'It is disputed whether Ms Chen had orally communicated to Mr Leow and the other FYTA representatives that THC and the plaintiff would withdraw from the Project. What is not in dispute is that the draft termination agreement was never executed by either THC or the plaintiff.', '36\\u2003On or around 7 April 2010, the first defendant received an official invitation to tender for the Project. 56', 'The first defendant submitted his bid on 19 April 2010 and, on 4 May 2010, the board of FYTA accepted his proposal. 57', 'The second defendant was incorporated on 17 May 2010 as the vehicle to carry out the Project. 58', '37\\u2003In the meantime, on 23 August 2010, the first defendant\u2019s resignation as director of the plaintiff was lodged with ACRA. It is a matter of dispute when the first defendant gave notice of his intention to resign as a director of the plaintiff. This will be dealt with later in the judgment.', '38\\u2003On 7 October 2010, the defendants, Clydesbuilt Investment Pte Ltd (in which the first defendant held 95% of its shareholding) and FYTA entered into a joint venture agreement. 59', 'In summary, the arrangement between the parties was as follows.', '(a)\\u2003The second defendant had a paid-up share capital of S$1 million, which was provided by its sole shareholder, Clydesbuilt Investment Pte Ltd. Representatives of FYTA were issued 1,000,000 preference shares at a par value of S$0.01 each, totalling the amount of S$10,000.', '(b)\\u2003At the time of its incorporation, the first defendant and his brother were appointed to the board of directors of the second defendant. On 20 October 2010, four more directors were appointed \u2013 the first defendant\u2019s sister, and three representatives from FYTA, including Mr Chan and Mr Leow.', '(c)\\u2003FYTA was entitled to 25 of the 82 residential units that would be built, while Clydesbuilt Investment Pte Ltd was entitled to 57 units.', '(d)\\u2003On 20 October 2010, pursuant to a sale and purchase agreement, the second defendant acquired from the trustees of FYTA the land on which the residential units would be built. The purchase price was S$70 million, and it would be paid by setting off against FYTA\u2019s share of the development costs for the Project.', '39\\u2003The Project was completed sometime in 2014. Subsequently, a dispute arose between the parties to this joint venture. Legal proceedings were commenced by FYTA in 2017 against the two defendants and Clydesbuilt Investment Pte Ltd but were then later withdrawn. There was presumably some form of settlement reached.', '40\\u2003On 31 July 2018, 21 of the 25 units (as four had been sold earlier on) earmarked for FYTA were transferred to them pursuant to a sale and purchase agreement entered into between the second defendant and FYTA on 26 February 2018. Thereafter, the 1,000,000 preference shares held by FYTA were cancelled, and FYTA\u2019s representatives resigned as directors from the second defendant\u2019s board.', '41\\u2003As at the time of the trial of the matter before me, only Clydesbuilt Investment Pte Ltd remained as the shareholder of the second defendant. The second defendant\u2019s board presently comprises the first defendant, his daughter and his brother. According to the defendants, the second defendant still holds 48 of its earmarked 57 residential units, with nine units having been sold.'"}
{"casename":"2019_SGHC_122","fact":"'5\\u2003It is necessary at this juncture to set out some background and technical terms in relation to data centres. Data centres must provide an uninterrupted electricity supply for the proper functioning of their customers\u2019 IT equipment. It would be deleterious for their customers if electricity supply were to cease even for very short periods. Disruption is discussed in the context of milliseconds. Equally significant is the cooling capacity of the data space, which cannot fail for any sustained period of time (since failure would cause the sensitive IT equipment to overheat).', '6\\u2003Data centres provide uninterrupted electricity supply and cooling through alternative back-up sources for no break power (\u201cNBP\u201d) and short break power (\u201cSBP\u201d). The essential difference is that SBP ordinarily experiences a short interruption of electricity of a few seconds during faults or maintenance. 4', 'Because of this, mechanical equipment (such as chillers and Computer Room Air Conditioning units (\u201cCRACs\u201d), collectively known as the \u201cMechanical Load\u201d) is typically supplied with SBP because it can tolerate short power disruptions, unlike IT equipment (also called the \u201cIT Load\u201d) that cannot. NBP is thus supplied for the IT Load.', '7\\u2003Because an uninterrupted electricity supply is so crucial to the powering and cooling of their customers\u2019 equipment, data centres install back-up electrical systems, in other words standby items of equipment that seamlessly \u201ckick-in\u201d and supply electricity the moment there is an interruption or anomaly in electricity supply coming off the power grid. Some of these back-up power systems can, to varying extents, \u201cclean up\u201d surges or drops in voltage, which occasionally occur in relation to the electricity coming off the power grid. Such anomalies are undesirable as they can interrupt the smooth functioning of IT equipment. I should mention that the frequency of alternating current from the grid (measured in Hertz (\u201cHz\u201d)) can also fluctuate, although I am told that does not affect IT equipment. 5', '8\\u2003The two relevant back-up systems in this case, each with their relative advantages and disadvantages, are the Static Uninterruptible Power Supply (\u201cSUPS\u201d); and the Diesel Rotary Uninterruptible Power Supply (\u201cDRUPS\u201d).', '9\\u2003A SUPS system essentially comprises a battery and a generator. If electricity supply is interrupted, the SUPS units \u201ckick-in\u201d and supply autonomous power to support the critical IT Load for around five to ten minutes. This buys time for the emergency generator to come online. SUPS systems can also condition the voltage input through a wide range of voltage deviation and act as a frequency converter. 6', 'Some disadvantages of SUPS systems include their weight and loading on floor as well as the space taken up to locate the batteries; the batteries also degrade and require regular replacement, in GSS\u2019s case, typically every two years or so. 7', '10\\u2003A DRUPS system, considered the more modern equipment, is also designed to provide uninterrupted, conditioned power to the critical IT Load if electrical supply is interrupted. 8', 'It does so without the use of batteries. Instead, there is one compact inline assembly, which can be containerised, comprising a kinetic energy accumulator (akin to a flywheel) which is coupled through induction to an inner rotor which drives the alternator, all of which are kept constantly spinning. That assembly is also connected to the diesel engine. The kinetic energy accumulator, in this case the outer rotor, spins continuously at 1,500 rpm. If there is any interruption or anomaly in the electrical supply, the diesel engine is activated, but meanwhile the interruption is momentarily taken up by the kinetic energy in the constantly spinning outer rotor which continues to drive the inner rotor and alternator thereby supplying the electricity (this being analogous to the battery function in the SUPS system). 9', 'When the diesel engine comes up to speed, it then engages and drives the alternator.', '11\\u2003The DRUPS unit is connected to the power mains. Under normal circumstances the IT equipment is powered by the electricity from the mains that flows through the DRUPS unit, which act as a power conditioner to some extent to improve the quality of the electrical supply to the IT equipment. 10', 'DRUPS units have power conditioning capability and can supply some frequency conditioning, but cannot condition output frequency in the manner that a double converter can. 11', 'DRUPS units can supply both NBP as well as SBP. 12', 'SUPS units cannot. 13', '12\\u2003The backup system in GSS\u2019s Existing Facility\u2019s was a SUPS system. There were initially (from October 2001) 6 MTU diesel generator sets with 2000 kVA alternators and batteries in the Existing Facility as the take-up of space by customers was gradual. As at August 2007, 14', 'only 50% of the Existing Facility\u2019s space was occupied, however with Google and Merrill Lynch\u2019s commitment to lease space by the end of 2007, thereby bringing the occupancy level to about 84%, GSS increased its capacity with the addition of another 6 MTU diesel generator sets (and batteries). 15', 'A DRUPS system was to be used for the Extension for both NBP and SBP, 16', 'given that it could deliver SBP concurrently.', '13\\u2003Next, I come to the concept of redundancy. Essentially this means providing back-up to the back-up, because an uninterrupted power supply is so critical to data centres. Data centres vary in terms of the level of redundancy provided. For instance:', '(a)\\u2003In an \u201cN+1\u201d configuration, \u201cN\u201d is the number of items of standby equipment (eg, generators or batteries combined with generators) required for emergency use when there is an interruption in electrical supply and \u201c+1\u201d represents an additional standby item of equipment for the redundancy capacity. If any of the \u201cN\u201d units fail, there is an additional unit to take its place. The \u201c+1\u201d is also useful when one of the \u201cN\u201d units have to be taken offline for maintenance or repairs.', '(b)\\u2003 In an \u201cN+N\u201d configuration, each generator is backed up by another generator, thereby ensuring that there is an equal number of backup generators available to take over the entire IT Load should all the main generators fail. 17', 'The higher the specifications, power requirements, capacity and reliability, the higher the capital expenditure to provide the same. A data centre operator would therefore have to make a commercial decision as to what segment of the market it would like to occupy, considering also the kind of customers in the market. If the market consisted mainly of tenants who required medium to lower-end specifications, then it would not make economic sense to incur the higher capital expenditure because such tenants would not be prepared to pay the higher rent that high-end customers would be prepared to.', '14\\u2003GSS describes the SUPS units in the Existing Facility as being configured in an \u201cenhanced\u201d \u201cN+1\u201d arrangement, 18', 'where each floor receives an \u201cN+N\u201d power feed from separate generator switchboards, under the criteria of no two generators simultaneously failing, which gives 8 MW of standby capacity. 19', '15\\u2003Finally, brief mention should be made of two different kinds of cooling systems. IT equipment in a data centre generates a significant amount of heat and therefore requires adequate cooling to prevent overheating and failure. 20', 'It may therefore be cooled by:', '(a)\\u2003A supply air system where the room will be divided into hot and cold aisles. 21', 'Cold air from the CRACs will be pushed into the cold aisles through a pressurised floor void and then over the IT equipment. After the cold air passes over the IT equipment, it absorbs the IT equipment\u2019s heat and turns into hot air. This hot air is then ejected into a hot aisle before being extracted from the aisle by the CRACs, which will cool the hot air before returning the cooled air into the cold aisles. 22', 'Thus, mixing of the cold and hot air will be minimised and the suite\u2019s temperature can be controlled by manipulating the temperature of the cold air.', '(b)\\u2003Alternatively, a return air system. This does not physically separate hot and cold air in the suites. Instead, the CRACs will supply overcooled air into the suite, with the aim of ensuring that the mixed air returning to the CRACs is maintained at a certain temperature. 23', '16\\u2003Under Arup\u2019s designs, the Extension\u2019s cooling was to be provided by a combination of three 1,900 kW chillers and CRAC units in an \u201cN+1\u201d configuration. 24', 'The chillers would provide the necessary cooling while the CRACs would be used to distribute the cool air to the IT equipment in the respective suites. The individual suites were to be cooled on a supply air system. On a return air basis the cooling capacity supplied would be much less. 25', '17\\u2003I now turn to the contract between GSS and Arup (the \u201cContract\u201d). It is common ground that the Contract is comprised in two documents (with GSS relying on some implied terms arising therefrom).', '18\\u2003The first is Arup\u2019s eight-page Engineering Fee Proposal (omitting Appendix A Project Programme) dated 16 September 2008 (the \u201cFee Proposal\u201d), and sent to GSS by email on 17 September 2008. 26', 'This contained, inter alia, the following:', '19\\u2003The sub-paragraphs that followed from the above, set out in greater detail the scope of works. For ease of reference, I have ascribed roman numerals to these salient sub-paragraphs: 27', '20\\u2003The second is GSS\u2019s Purchase Order dated 17 September 2008 addressed to Arup. This laconically stated that it was for Mechanical & Electrical Professional Consultation for additional and alteration works and described six aspects under the heading \u201cItems\/Services\/Goods Description\u201d: 28', 'At the bottom of the Purchase Order, there is the notation: \u201cSupplier quotation to be attached with purchase order upon submission\u201d. The Purchase Order stated the agreed fee of $595,000, which was also the lump sum fee stated in the Fee Proposal. 29', '21\\u2003Arup also contends that the Contract also incorporated the \u201cACEA Form Contract\u201d pursuant to paragraph 8 of the Fee Proposal, which read: 30', 'It is not disputed that no such form was attached to the Fee Proposal. GSS denies that it has been incorporated into the Contract.', '22\\u2003Besides Arup, as M&E consultant, GSS\u2019s team of consultants for the Project were:', '(a)\\u2003A W P Pte Ltd (\u201cAWP\u201d), the Project architects;', '(b)\\u2003Babtie Asia Pte Ltd (\u201cBabtie\u201d), the Project structural engineers;', '(c)\\u2003Turner & Townsend Pte Ltd (\u201cT&T\u201d), the Project quantity surveyors and GSS\u2019s costs consultants.', 'The construction works for the Extension were awarded to Gammon Pte Ltd (\u201cGammon\u201d) as the main contractor. BurnsBridge Sweett Pte Ltd (\u201cBurnsBridge\u201d) was GSS\u2019s Project manager and superintending officer for the Extension.', '23\\u2003For context, I now proceed to outline the principal events that led to the disputes. The facts surrounding these events are disputed and it will be necessary for me to consider the facts and allegations in detail later.', '24\\u2003GSS avers that it required the Extension to have 4,000 kW (ie, 1 kW\/m2 for a total of 4000m2) of NBP in an \u201cN+1\u201d configuration with a 0.9 diversity factor. As we shall see, a key part of this dispute centres on the parties\u2019 differing interpretations of how diversity should be applied, which would affect what the NBP specification actually meant. However, this difference in application of the overall diversity did not feature when the Contract was entered into and when Arup developed its design brief in discussion with the other project consultants.', '25\\u2003Arup also designed the cooling system for the Extension. GSS claims Arup failed to provide sufficient cooling capacity for the Extension. Arup denies this. Comparatively, more time at trial was spent on the NBP issues.', '26\\u2003The expert witnesses gave evidence that the norm was to locate chillers (as distinct from the cooling towers), in the basement or lower floors of buildings, particularly in Singapore, in order to protect the equipment from the fairly constant rain that Singapore receives. 31', 'However, the parties had no choice but to locate the Extension\u2019s chillers on the roof due to space constraints. 32', 'In the tender specifications that Arup issued for the chillers, it was specified that the chillers were to be located on the Extension\u2019s roof, and that the chillers\u2019 control panels were to meet the IP56 standard. 33', 'An equipment\u2019s IP rating indicates the amount of protection that it gets from the elements. The first digit in the rating specification denotes the degree that a piece of equipment will be protected from dust, while the second digit denotes the degree of protection that the equipment will get from water. 34', 'The higher the numbers, the greater the degree of protection. Thus, at IP11, a piece of equipment will be exposed to all forms of moisture, and the degree of protection that it has from dust is so low that even birds will be able to fly in. 35', 'The chillers themselves were housed in louvered \u201cshipping containers\u201d on the roof. 36', 'Unfortunately, after the Extension was completed, the chillers experienced at least 12 failures over three years. 37', '27\\u2003As the design development progressed, it was clear there were some perceived site constraints on available space for the Extension\u2019s DRUPS units. The then proposed Extension, being tucked away at the rear of the building, comprised a rectangle and series of truncated triangles. There is little doubt that space was tight. 38', 'The T&T report of August 2008 (No 3 Rev 1) (\u201cT&T Cost Plan\u201d) identified a location at L2 to place three (2 MVA) DRUPS units. 39', 'A purpose-built steel structure was to be constructed at that location and upon which the three DRUPS units were to be placed. It appears, and this was not contradicted, that right from the start of the Project, AWP had ruled out constructing a platform for DRUPS units at a second location above the high voltage transformer and switchgear (\u201cHV Transformer\u201d) as it was considered too risky because piling would then have been required and it was the electrical supply point for both \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d 22 kV cables. 40', '28\\u2003I pause to note that this does not mean it was impossible to get more space for the DRUPS equipment at that location. It is a question of balancing competing considerations. Generally speaking, giving more space to the equipment might mean cutting down on net floor area available for customer usage or, in this case, incurring higher costs for locating the DRUPS units in different locations. More relevantly, modern construction and technology would have made it possible to construct a platform for a DRUPS unit above the HV Transformer (as was in fact done later), but it would have incurred higher cost, required closer supervision during construction and entailed a longer time to do so.', '29\\u2003Around July to August 2008, Arup was looking to place three containerised DRUPS units at the assigned location at L2. On 14 July 2008, GSS asked Arup to look at the DRUPS units manufactured by Piller and I note that the Piller technical data sheet provided in response showed its output rated power for NBP at 1,670 kVA\/1,336 kW and SBP at 1,100 kVA\/800 kW. 41', 'On 22 August 2008, GSS also asked Arup to look at DRUPS units made by EuroDiesel and Hitec. 42', '30\\u2003Arup communicated with these suppliers and\/or their representatives requesting information and data on their DRUPS units. There were many email exchanges that followed in that period of October to early November 2008 and some of these emails, and especially their attachments, indicated that these DRUPS units had NBP of 1,400 kW and SBP of 600 kW. In an \u201cN+1\u201d configuration with three DRUPS units (the \u201cOriginal Design\u201d), the total NBP was not 4,000 kW or 3,600 kW but 2,800 kW (1,400 kW x 2). Some of these emails were sent directly from the suppliers to GSS. 43', 'From these emails, Arup says GSS must have known that the NBP being considered was 2,800 kW in an \u201cN+1\u201d configuration. GSS disagrees and contends that Arup never pointed this out to GSS, and it relied on Arup to provide what was stipulated in the Engineering Proposal. Arup also alleges that these were the biggest capacity DRUPS units in the market at that time that suited GSS\u2019s requirements. GSS disagrees.', '31\\u2003In response to GSS\u2019s query on 28 November 2008 as to how much power GSS could actually sell to customers in the Extension, excluding diversity, Arup replied by email on the same day, stating: 44', 'GSS\u2019s enigmatic response was: \u201cWe may have to back up in excess of 2,800 kw with only 2 UPS units (1 being faulty) \u2026 In Sydney we only allow a diversity of .9 or 1.1 whichever way you look at it, you have me concerned\u201d. 45', 'Exactly what this meant will be examined later.', '32\\u2003Emails then passed between GSS and Arup on how much more power could be obtained from the DRUPS units by checking on whether the power factor could be increased.', '33\\u2003The power factor is technically the ratio of kW to kVA, which means the ratio of real power to apparent power. When I clarified this aspect with the expert witnesses, what this means, and I so find, is that first, when a manufacturer says its unit can provide 1,000 kW, it also stipulates the application of a power factor, say 0.8. This means if their unit runs at its fullest or highest capacity, it can provide 1,000 kW, but units are not meant to run flat out at full capacity for prolonged periods and purchasers should count on 800 kW (1,000 kW x 0.8) as the normal output. Further, it may also be the case that with age or sub-optimal maintenance, the power output may decline. However, in case of emergencies or for short periods or bursts of maximum capacity, it may possibly produce slightly more than 1,000 kW. For example, the Piller DRUPS units could run at 10% overload for one hour. 46', 'Secondly, in reality, manufacturers add an additional safety margin or layer of protection to prevent claims for breach of specifications. Hence they state in their sales material that their units are rated at, say 1,000 kW, but they design and produce units that can, running at full speed, actually provide, say 1,050 or 1,100 kW.', '34\\u2003On 1 December 2008, Arup informed GSS that EuroDiesel had confirmed its DRUPS units could achieve a power factor of +0.99. 47', 'Arup worked out the normal output as: 2 x 1,750 x 0.99 = 3,465 kW or 86.6% of the nominal 4,000 kW.', '35\\u2003A significant event then occurred on 27 January 2009 when GSS sent Arup an attachment (prepared by T&T, London) entitled the \u201cGS Global Business Change Programme\u201d from its parent Global Switch, calling for a full and thorough review of all their seven data centres, including Singapore, and to maximise the usage of spare power capacity (\u201cGlobal Switch Directive\u201d). It required all Global Switch data centres to carry out technical reviews of their cooling and power capacities, both in terms of the data centre\u2019s capacities and what they were contractually bound to supply to their tenants, to think out of the box to suggest ways in which they could re-distribute any spare power capacity within their data centres so as to maximise their revenues. The objective was to maximise the usage of any spare power capacity and Global Switch envisaged that it would result in: 48', '(a)\\u2003easy wins, with no or little capital investment;', '(b)\\u2003basic infrastructure changes to re-divert spare capacity; and', '(c)\\u2003substantial plant\/infrastructure change which can be justified with an accompanied business case.', 'Global Switch data centres were thus required to carry out a full and thorough review to see if each data centre was set up to effectively distribute all available power and cooling to client areas. Once these technical studies were completed and each data centre knew their position (ie, each data centre would know the power and cooling capacity it had, the contracted amount of power and cooling capacity to the tenants and the amount of power and cooling capacity their tenants actually used), a separate commercial study was to be undertaken in conjunction with these technical findings. Global Switch was looking to deliver credible outputs for each data centre by 1 April 2009. There was a request for data centres to look at the extension building in light of possible savings due to application of \u201cpower diversity initiatives\u201d. 49', 'Various email exchanges between GSS and Arup ensued.', '36\\u2003On 17 February 2009, GSS issued a \u201cStop Work Order\u201d to Arup (the \u201cStop Work Order\u201d). GSS accept that when this Stop Work Order was issued, GSS had not secured any tenants for the extension. 50', '37\\u2003In or around July 2009, GSS appears to have had promising negotiations with potential tenants, including Microsoft. As their talks with prospective tenants progressed, it appears GSS stated to Microsoft that the available power in the Extension was 4,000 kW.', '38\\u2003The Project was reactivated around July 2009 (according to Mr Paddy) and around September 2009 (according to Mr Guth), 51', 'several months after the Stop Work Order. 52', 'A GSS status and recommendation report, dated 30 October 2009, stated there was an immediate client requirement for data centre space by the middle of 2010. 53', 'Even as of 30 October 2009, it appears that tenants had not been secured for the whole of the Extension. 54', 'Draft tender documents for the DRUPS units were prepared by October 2009. 55', '39\\u2003On 29 September 2009, GSS issued the tender for, amongst others, the DRUPS units. 56', 'GSS alleges that it was Arup who drafted the tender documents and Arup specified a 2,500 kVA DRUPS unit (which could only produce 1,400 kW NBP and 600 kW SBP per unit). 57', 'GSS disputes that it made any variation to its requirements. Arup alleges that the 2,500 kVA DRUPS unit was the largest available at that point in time and GSS knew the NBP per unit was 1,400 kW. GSS disagrees.', '40\\u2003At some point in time after 30 October 2009, it appeared that Microsoft was prepared to take up the whole Extension. With Microsoft\u2019s requirement of, inter alia, 4,000 kW NBP for the IT Load, GSS (including their project consultants like T&T) and Arup began discussing how the shortfall could be met. It was then decided that three DRUPS units would be used as the \u201cN\u201d component and the \u201c+1\u201d component would come from the spare capacity of the SUPS system in the Existing Facility (the \u201cRevised Design\u201d). Again there are differing implications, allegations and claims in relation to the need for, design and implementation of the Revised Design and my use of the phrase \u201cthen decided\u201d is to be taken in a neutral manner as I will examine in detail later and make my findings as to whether, for example, GSS was \u201cforced\u201d to accept this solution because Arup failed to provide for 4,000 kW in the circumstances that occurred or GSS agreed to the Revised Design as a result of factors for which no blame could be attached to Arup.', '41\\u2003Arup then proceeded to implement the Revised Design. This included the use of:', '(a)\\u2003thirty Power Distribution Units (\u201cPDUs\u201d or \u201cPDU\u201d as the case may be), where each PDU provided a \u201cpreferred\u201d electrical feed from one of the three DRUPS units (the \u201cPreferred Source\u201d) and an \u201calternative\u201d electrical feed from a group of SUPS units (the \u201cAlternative Source\u201d); and', '(b)\\u2003Static Transfer Switches (\u201cSTSs\u201d or \u201cSTS\u201d as the case may be), which controlled the Preferred Source and the Alternative Source to each PDU so that during a fault or maintenance of a single DRUPS unit, the STS would transfer the electrical load of a PDU from the DRUPS unit to the SUPS system.', '42\\u2003Microsoft moved into the Extension in tranches. It first occupied L3\u2013L4 in September 2010 in phase 1 (after testing and commissioning (\u201cT&C\u201d) was carried out from 14\u201315 August 2010) and L5\u2013L7 in subsequent phases 2 to 4. The commencement dates for phases 2, 3 and 4 were 1 January 2011, 1 July 2011 and 1 January 2012 respectively. 58', '43\\u2003The next significant event occurred just under two and a half years later, on or around 2 May 2013. GSS complains that on this date the utility mains power supply experienced a disturbance and before the DRUPS units could react to supply the electrical power to the IT Load while the mains supply was unstable, the STSs transferred the electrical load of two DRUPS units to the SUPS units, resulting in overloading of the SUPS units and failure of the IT equipment of some of GSS\u2019s tenants. GSS alleges that this caused them to breach their Service Level Agreements with those tenants.', '44\\u2003GSS also complains that on or around 18 May 2013, the incoming feeders from the utility main power supply experienced disturbances and the STSs unnecessarily transferred the electrical loads of the DRUPS units to the SUPS units thereby causing a failure of their tenants\u2019 IT equipment, and again causing GSS to breach their Service Level Agreements with those tenants.', '45\\u2003As a consequence, GSS alleged it had to install a fourth DRUPS unit and implement a distributed redundant re-configuration in the Extension.', '46\\u2003 Following from these events, which I will collectively refer to as the \u201cMay 2013 failures\u201d, GSS sued Arup claiming substantial damages in excess of $23.8 million, general damages, interest, costs and an indemnity. Arup denied liability and filed a counterclaim for the balance of its fees.'"}

The court directed him to file the application by 22 January 2019.', '7\\u2003At the PTC on 29 January 2019, Mr Ezekiel, informed the court that he would be suspended from practice from 1 April 2019. He said that he would hand over conduct of the matter to another solicitor, Mr David Gan (\u201cMr Gan\u201d) of DG Law LLC after that date. The court pointed out to Mr Ezekiel that the Applicant had not filed the application to adduce further evidence as directed and ordered that this be done by 7 February 2019. The Applicant complied with that order by filing summons no 638 of 2019 on that date. This application was heard by assistant registrar Gan Kam Yuin (\u201cAR Gan\u201d) on 18 March 2019.

She said that he told her that he needed more time to look at the matter in order to advise the Applicant on the matter. Ms Wong said that the Applicant had consulted Mr Gan only a week earlier because they had tried to find out whether other lawyers could handle the matter on their behalf.

Ms Wong said that the Applicant did not deposit the $81,220 with the Commissioner, and also did not pay the costs of $5,000 and $4,000 because it did not have the funds to do so.'"}

The appellant also extracted all of the victim\u2019s photographs and chat history from the phone.', '10\\u2003The appellant accessed the victim\u2019s Hotmail account and looked through her inbox. He used the account to send emails (containing URLs of images of the victim) to the victim\u2019s SMU email account and two of the victim\u2019s friends. The appellant then changed the Hotmail account password and downloaded a Hotmail account verification application to the victim\u2019s phone. With the application installed, only the appellant could log into the account.', '11\\u2003The appellant next accessed the victim\u2019s Facebook account using his desktop computer. He went through her private messages including her most recent conversations with her ex-boyfriend.', '12\\u2003The appellant also accessed the victim\u2019s two Gmail accounts and went through the inboxes but found nothing interesting. He then changed the secondary email for both accounts to that of the victim\u2019s Hotmail account which he now controlled.', '13\\u2003The appellant accessed the victim\u2019s Instagram account. He also managed to log into the victim\u2019s Telegram account. However, the victim managed to remotely disconnect the session because she received a notification when the appellant logged into the account. The appellant logged into the account again by getting another access code from the stolen handphone and disconnected the session that the victim had on her own computer.', '14\\u2003While going through the victim\u2019s SMSes in the stolen handphone, the appellant saw an SMS from the victim to her sister. In the SMS, the victim said that the appellant had \u201clow EQ\u201d because of a previous incident where despite her reluctance to agree, the appellant insisted on hitching a ride when the victim\u2019s father gave her a ride home.', '15\\u2003The appellant was angered by what he saw. On 8 March 2015, he logged into the victim\u2019s SMU student account and de-registered her from one of the modules that she had enrolled in. As there was no immediate reaction from the victim, the appellant used her account to de-register her from another module \u201cto get a reaction from her\u201d.', '16\\u2003On 10 March 2015, the appellant logged into the victim\u2019s ex-boyfriend\u2019s Facebook account and used it to send a private message saying \u201chello\u201d to the victim. The appellant then used his own Facebook account to send a similar private message to the victim, to make her believe that he was also a victim of the same unknown hacker.', '17\\u2003As part of his plan to get back at the victim, the appellant created a fake Instagram account with the name \u201c[victim\u2019s name] is here\u201d, mirroring the spelling of one of the victim\u2019s Gmail accounts. The profile picture of the Instagram account was a photograph of the victim. The appellant posted photographs of the victim and her ex-boyfriend with captions that carried sexual innuendos. The Instagram account was set to \u201cpublic\u201d mode, and these photographs could be viewed by any member of the public.', '18\\u2003Meanwhile, on 9 March 2015, the victim reported to SMU that her student account had been hacked and that the hacker had de-registered her from two of her subject modules without her consent. On 10 March 2015, the victim informed the appellant that her SMU student account had been compromised and advised him to change his SMU student password.', '19\\u2003On 11 March 2015, the appellant wrote to SMU claiming that he had also been de-registered from one of his subject modules without his consent. SMU investigated and discovered that the IP address which had accessed the victim\u2019s Telegram account without her authority was the same IP address previously tagged to the appellant\u2019s SMU student account.', '20\\u2003SMU confronted the appellant on 23 March 2015. He vehemently denied committing the offences and SMU agreed to give him some time to think about it. On the same day, the appellant told the victim that SMU was investigating him and lied to her that he had been threatened by the \u201charasser\u201d who had sent him up-skirt images of the victim and that he had been extorted into giving the \u201charasser\u201d $2,000 to stop his actions.', '21\\u2003The victim believed the appellant\u2019s lies and accompanied him to meet with SMU staff to try and exonerate the appellant. As the appellant had failed to come clean, the SMU staff informed the appellant that they would leave the investigation to the police.', '22\\u2003Sufficiently troubled, the victim went to the police station on 24 March 2015 to make a report about the appellant paying the \u201charasser\u201d $2,000. The police asked the appellant to give a statement.', '23\\u2003In his initial statement, the appellant denied committing any offences. Instead, he concocted a detailed story about how, on 21 March 2015, he received an email from the victim\u2019s Hotmail account attaching a screenshot of a private WhatsApp conversation between the victim and her ex-boyfriend \u201cabout masturbating\u201d, together with images of a vagina and the victim lying on the bed.', '24\\u2003The appellant said he had been asked to pay the \u201charasser\u201d $2,000 and that he met a person at 3.00am in Sembawang Park to pass him the money in a white plastic bag. He described the \u201charasser\u201d as a man \u201cabout 1.7 metres tall, Chinese, skinny, wearing jeans, black T shirt, aged around 18\u201d.', '25\\u2003The appellant also told the police that on 22 March 2015, he received an email from the victim\u2019s Hotmail account with his home address and was afraid that the harasser had information to hurt his family. The appellant said that he thought the harasser had access to his computer, and claimed that he did not want to lodge a police report because he feared for the safety of his family.', '26\\u2003The police subsequently conducted a raid on the appellant\u2019s residence and seized his Apple Macbook and handphone. A preliminary search revealed an up-skirt video of the victim and personal photographs belonging to the victim. When confronted, the appellant maintained his innocence.', '27\\u2003The appellant was brought back to the police station where he admitted to the offences after he was confronted with the evidence of the up-skirt videos and photographs on his Macbook.', '28\\u2003Investigations revealed that the appellant had disposed of the victim\u2019s handphone in a rubbish bin near an MRT station. The handphone has not been recovered.'"}

Its objects include coordinating, regulating, advising and administering all matters relating to the sport of shooting, and safeguarding the interests of the shooting sport. 4', '7\\u2003Mr Vaz was elected president of SSA in May 2013, 5', 'and he has held that office ever since. His deputies in SGC, Mr Yap and Mr Chen, have also been secretary general and treasurer of SSA respectively since September 2014. 6', 'SSA has an advisor in BG (Ret) Lim Kim Lye, who was invited by Mr Vaz to join the SSA council in that capacity in 2013. 7', 'Mr David Lieu has been SSA\u2019s general manager since December 2014. 8', 'At the material time, Mr Loo Woei Harng was SRA\u2019s representative on the SSA council.', '8\\u2003Shooting activities for SRA took place at the NSC, which is a complex of shooting ranges located at Old Chua Chu Kang Road. 9', 'At the NSC, SRA and SGC each had an armoury, where the firearms, ammunition and other shooting equipment belonging to each club were respectively stored. 10', 'BG Lim had once proposed that all firearms in the NSC be stored in one armoury and all ammunition be stored in another. This proposal was never implemented, but it later became something of a flashpoint.', '9\\u2003The NSC is built on land which is owned by the state and leased to the Singapore Sports Council, a statutory board whose responsibility is to oversee and promote sports generally in Singapore. 11', 'Following a rebranding exercise in 2014, the Singapore Sports Council adopted the new name \u201cSport Singapore\u201d. For convenience, I shall refer to it by its new name. At the material time, Sport Singapore sub-leased the NSC to SSA, 12', 'and SSA was, in turn, entitled to manage and develop the NSC and enter into arrangements with SSA\u2019s constituent members in relation to the use of the NSC.', '10\\u2003One set of such arrangements prevailed between SSA and SRA. In March 2011, SSA granted SRA a licence to be the sole and exclusive operator and manager of all the pistol and rifle ranges at the NSC. 13', 'After Mr Vaz assumed the presidency of SSA, he decided that SSA should take over from SRA the operation and management of all ranges at the NSC, and that in exchange, SRA would have one range for its exclusive use. So the licence was superseded by another contract between them titled \u201cProprietary Range Agreement\u201d and executed in November 2014 (\u201cthe Agreement\u201d). 14', 'Under the Agreement, SRA was granted the right to construct a shooting range within a specified area of the NSC, called \u201cRange X\u201d, for SRA\u2019s exclusive use, subject to certain agreed exceptions. In return, SRA had to pay an annual fee of $10,000 to SSA. The Agreement refers to the proposed shooting range for SRA\u2019s exclusive use as the \u201cClub Range\u201d. 15', 'The Club Range is also referred to by various witnesses during the trial as \u201cRange 3\u201d, given its location next to the two existing rifle ranges at the NSC known as \u201cRange 1\u201d and \u201cRange 2\u201d. In the Agreement, SRA also undertook to bear all necessary costs of the construction and to indemnify SSA against any loss caused by SRA\u2019s activities on the land. 16', '11\\u2003Led by Mr Conrad Chung, who is an architect, SRA\u2019s construction of the Club Range began promptly after the conclusion of the Agreement. At the time the Agreement was signed, the location known as Range X was not an empty plot of land. There was already a disused and dilapidated shooting range there. Instead of tearing down the existing structure and building a new one in its place, SRA\u2019s plan for the construction of the Club Range was to refurbish the existing range. 17', 'Mr Chung\u2019s plan had two phases. The first phase would involve replacing the dilapidated pre-existing structures, including overhead steel trusses and old target structures. It would also involve minor works such as the installation of a lightning protection system. The second phase would involve the construction of a metal roof over a resting area. SRA\u2019s understanding was that only the second phase needed approval from the relevant authorities, including building plan approval from the Building and Construction Authority of Singapore (\u201cBCA\u201d) and planning approval from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (\u201cURA\u201d). 18', 'I shall refer to these approvals as \u201cregulatory approvals\u201d for convenience.', '12\\u2003 The first phase began in December 2014. 19', 'Progress was interrupted that month by preparations for the 2015 South-East Asian Games, 20', 'but the works resumed and the first phase was completed by March 2015. 21', 'Throughout that period, SRA kept SSA and Sport Singapore updated on the project by email and letter. 22', '13\\u2003However, from April to October 2015, SSA secretly complained first to Sport Singapore and then to BCA about SRA\u2019s construction work at Range X. Thus, on 15 September 2015, Mr Vaz, without SRA\u2019s knowledge, sent an email to BCA and Sport Singapore to report that SRA had constructed \u201cillegal structures\u201d. The email also and \u201curgently ask[ed] that BCA calls for the demolition of the structures before anyone is seriously hurt\u201d. 23', 'BCA investigated the matter and conducted a site visit at Range X on 21 September 2015, which was attended by only Mr Vaz, Mr Lieu and two BCA officers. 24', 'SRA was neither informed of the site visit nor invited to send any representative to attend. The BCA officers observed, at the time of inspection, that the structures \u201cposed no immediate danger\u201d. 25', 'Undeterred, Mr Vaz sent another email to BCA after the site visit to offer his personal opinion that the wall of the original Range X was \u201cnever designed to take the loading\u201d of what Mr Vaz regarded as \u201cheavy beams\u201d erected by SRA across the width of Range X. Mr Vaz expressed concern that the \u201cexcess loads\u201d (in Mr Vaz\u2019s words) could \u201clead to structural failure\u201d. 26', 'SRA would not find out about these complaints until much later.', '14\\u2003During this period, SRA was plagued by other troubles at the NSC. In late December 2014, 27', 'the basement of the NSC main building was flooded with water that had overflowed from an obstructed drain in the compound. As a result, equipment that was being kept in SRA\u2019s armoury, including ammunition and target papers, was damaged. A second flood in the same place occurred in May 2015. 28', 'Although it was less severe, SRA had to incur cleaning costs. In September 2015, SSA sought to evict SRA from SRA\u2019s armoury in the NSC\u2019s main building. After giving notice to SRA on 4 September 2015 to vacate within 30 days, SSA sued SRA on 16 October 2015, demanding that SRA deliver vacant possession of the SRA armoury 29', 'in order that SSA could renovate the armoury and other facilities in the NSC. 30', 'I shall refer to this as the Eviction Suit.', '15\\u2003After completing its investigations, BCA issued Sport Singapore an order on 6 November 2015 requiring the structures that SRA had built on Range X be demolished because the structures had been erected without building plan approval. 31', 'This demolition order was, however, accompanied by a letter which set out the steps that could be taken to regularise those structures if it was desired that they be retained (\u201cthe regularisation letter\u201d). 32', 'There was no indication in any of BCA\u2019s communications that the structures were unsafe. Sport Singapore conveyed both the demolition order and the regularisation letter to SSA, leaving both the option of demolition and the option of regularisation open to SSA, without directing SSA to take any particular course of action. 33', 'Mr Vaz promptly decided that SSA should opt for demolition. By 12 November 2015, SSA\u2019s executive committee had approved this decision, 34', 'and it was later formalised through an SSA council resolution on 14 November 2015. 35', 'Mr Vaz did not tell SRA about the option of regularisation, 36', 'nor did anyone from SSA disclose the regularisation letter to SRA. 37', '16\\u2003Unsurprisingly, SRA, having spent nearly $300,000 on the Club Range, 38', 'was unwilling to go along with the SSA council\u2019s decision to demolish it. Foreseeing that SRA was not going to be persuaded otherwise, Mr Vaz asked Mr Lieu to find a demolition contractor for the job. 39', 'In the event, SSA appointed Pikasa Builders Pte Ltd (\u201cPikasa\u201d) to demolish the Club Range for $24,800. 40', 'The eventual cost was $26,536. 41', '17\\u2003In the meantime, on 9 November 2015, SRA filed its defence and counterclaim in the Eviction Suit. 42', 'Part of its defence was the assertion that because the parties had agreed that SRA would carry out upgrading works at SRA\u2019s armoury to enhance its security, SSA had implicitly granted SRA a contractual licence to occupy the armoury which SSA could not unilaterally revoke. 43', 'In its counterclaim, SRA claimed damages for the loss it had suffered as a result of the floods, alleging that the loss had been caused by SSA\u2019s failure to maintain the premises. 44', 'On 25 November 2015, SSA filed its reply, in which it averred that it was SSA, not SRA, whom the parties had agreed would be responsible for upgrading the security of the NSC armouries, including by implementing BG Lim\u2019s idea of storing firearms in one armoury and ammunition in another. 45', '18\\u2003Then, on 30 November 2015, Mr Vaz convened a meeting of the SSA council to ratify the following five resolutions that had been passed earlier that year:', '(a)\\u2003a resolution adopted on 14 March 2015 that BG Lim\u2019s two-armoury idea be implemented;', '(b)\\u2003a resolution adopted on 9 May 2015 that the existing armoury doors be replaced with better ones called Chubb Doors;', '(c)\\u2003a resolution adopted on 4 September 2015 that SRA be given notice to vacate their armoury;', '(d)\\u2003a resolution adopted on 26 September 2015 that SSA institute the Eviction Suit; and', '(e)\\u2003a resolution adopted on 14 November 2015 to demolish the structures built by SRA at Range X in compliance with BCA\u2019s demolition order. 46', 'SRA\u2019s representative on the SSA council, Mr Loo, was absent from the meeting. 47', '19\\u2003These resolutions were not originally adopted by voting through a show of hands. Mr Vaz explained that he had received legal advice that the resolutions ought to have been passed that way under SSA\u2019s constitution, and that he should call a meeting to have the resolutions voted on again by way of show of hands. 48', 'SRA, on the other hand, suggested that Mr Vaz convened the meeting because SRA\u2019s lawyers had written on 8 October 2015, in response to the eviction notice, to seek details of the SSA council resolutions mentioned in that notice, including how those resolutions were passed and who voted for them. 49', 'SRA had also in its defence and counterclaim in the Eviction Suit alleged that the eviction notice and Eviction Suit were issued and commenced without proper authority or approval. 50', '20\\u2003Palpable acrimony had developed between SSA and SRA by this time. 51', 'SRA made several attempts to prevent the demolition of the Club Range, but none of them succeeded. Just a week before the SSA council met to ratify the five resolutions, SRA met with BCA and discovered to its surprise that the Club Range could be regularised, and that this option had been communicated by BCA to Sport Singapore but was concealed from SRA. 52', 'It was also at this time that SRA discovered that someone had gone behind its back to complain to BCA about the irregularities of the Club Range. 53', 'BCA directed SRA to Sport Singapore because Sport Singapore was the owner of the NSC, and BCA would act on a request to regularise only if it came from the land owner. As late as 27 November 2015, BCA offered to facilitate a meeting with SSA and SRA, 54', 'but SSA declined to attend. On 10 December 2015, SRA\u2019s lawyers wrote to SSA, BCA and Sport Singapore, asking all parties not to act on the order and stating that SRA intended to make representations to BCA. 55', '21\\u2003The second defendant Mr Vaz then decided that he had had enough. The very next day, he wrote to Mr Yap, the third defendant, indicating his intention for the SSA council to suspend the privileges of SRA at the NSC with effect from 1 January 2016 for SRA\u2019s refusal to comply with the resolutions that the SSA council had earlier passed and subsequently ratified on 30 November 2015. 56', 'Mr Vaz did not call a physical meeting of the council. Instead, he asked Mr Yap to put the resolution in writing and to circulate it by email to the council for a vote, which Mr Yap did on 16 December 2015. That is why the resolution has been referred to by the parties as the \u201ccircular resolution\u201d. The resolution was seconded by Mr Chen, the third defendant. On the same day, SRA got wind of the circular resolution through Mr Loo and instructed its lawyers to send a letter to SSA\u2019s lawyers to object to the resolution and demand its retraction. 57', 'Despite this letter, Mr Vaz, Mr Yap and Mr Chen proceeded to vote in favour of the resolution. Mr Loo voted against the resolution while the remaining three council members either abstained or did not respond. 58', 'The circular resolution was therefore passed.', '22\\u2003On 18 December 2015, Mr Vaz started making arrangements to convene a board of inquiry (\u201cBOI\u201d) apparently to investigate SRA\u2019s breaches and for SRA to explain its reasons for not complying with SSA\u2019s resolutions. Thus, shortly after the circular resolution was passed, Mr Vaz appointed BG Lim to chair the BOI. 59', 'Two others, who were from another member club of SSA, were also appointed to the BOI. 60', 'At around the same time, on 21 December 2015, Pikasa began the demolition of the Club Range at the NSC. 61', 'A month later, the demolition was complete. 62', '23\\u2003The BOI\u2019s first set of hearings took place on 1 and 4 February 2016. 63', 'At this hearing, the BOI determined, based on the materials before it, that SRA had committed the breaches alleged in the circular resolution. The BOI then adjourned the proceedings until 17 February 2016, where it expected to hear SRA on the breaches.', '24\\u2003While the first set of hearings was underway, the police was auditing the armouries at the NSC. The police discovered that the armouries contained firearms which had no proper records because they belonged to members who had died, quit their respective clubs or left Singapore. As a result, the police seized 75 firearms from the SRA armoury and two firearms from the SGC armoury. 64', 'Following this discovery, Sport Singapore decided on 6 February 2016 to terminate its sub-lease with SSA, and resumed control of the NSC premises. 65', 'The NSC was also shut down pending further investigation and a review of processes.', '25\\u2003These events led the BOI to postpone the second set of hearings on SRA\u2019s breaches to 16 March 2016. This set of hearings was ostensibly for the purpose of hearing SRA\u2019s answers to allegations against it. Before this set of hearings took place, the SSA council met on 13 February 2016. BG Lim attended, and informed the SSA council that the BOI had concluded that SRA had indeed committed the four alleged breaches as stated in the circular resolution. Mr Vaz then proposed a motion to suspend SRA, with the specific terms of the suspension to be decided later. The motion was carried with three votes in favour and two abstentions. The three votes in favour were cast by the three Individual Defendants. 66', 'SRA\u2019s representative on the SSA council, Mr Loo, was not present at this meeting.', '26\\u2003At the resumed hearing of the BOI on 16 March 2016, Mr Timothy Ngui and Mr Kevin Leong of SRA were in attendance, and they presented a set of objections on behalf of SRA. They objected to BG Lim\u2019s appointment as chairman of the BOI, contending he was in a position of conflict because it was he who had proposed the idea of consolidating firearms and ammunition into separate armouries. 67', 'They also submitted that a majority of SRA\u2019s alleged breaches were live issues before the High Court in the Eviction Suit and therefore inappropriate for determination by the BOI. 68', 'The BOI did not accept these objections, and proceeded to affirm its conclusion at the first set of hearings that SRA had indeed committed the alleged breaches. 69', '27\\u2003After that, on 23 March 2016, SSA discontinued its claim for vacant possession of the SRA armoury in the Eviction Suit because SSA no longer held the lease to those premises. 70', 'SRA maintained its counterclaim in that suit. At the time of my writing, the suit had run its course. In July 2017, the High Court dismissed SRA\u2019s claim in respect of the first flood and allowed SRA\u2019s claim in respect of the second flood: see Singapore Shooting Association v Singapore Rifle Association [2017] SGHC 266. SRA\u2019s appeal was subsequently dismissed by the Court of Appeal: see Singapore Rifle Association v The Singapore Shooting Association [2018] 2 SLR 616.', '28\\u2003In April 2016, the SSA council re-convened. BG Lim presented the conclusions of the BOI. Mr Vaz then proposed a motion to suspend SRA as a member club of SSA and to suspend SRA\u2019s privileges at the NSC. The only voting members of the SSA council present at this meeting were the three Individual Defendants. Mr Loo was again absent from the meeting. The motion was passed unanimously by the votes of the three Individual Defendants. 71', '29\\u2003In May 2016, SRA brought the present suit against SSA, Mr Vaz, Mr Yap and Mr Chen, seeking a declaration that the circular resolution is null and void, and claiming damages for loss suffered as a result of an alleged conspiracy involving Mr Vaz, Mr Yap and Mr Chen to injure SRA. SSA in turn counterclaimed damages in the amount of the cost of demolishing the Club Range.'"}

{"casename":"2019_SGHC_134","fact":"Background facts\nParties to the  dispute\n2 Dr Looi is a medical practitioner with a registered speciality in hand \nsurgery. In 2011, he was practising  in a medical centre run by West Point \nHospital Pte Ltd (\u201cthe  Hospital\u201d).\n3 Vadamodulu Tata Rao (\u201cthe  Patient\u201d) is an Indian national who was in \nhis early 30s in 2011. He was then employed by Tellus Oceanic Pro Pte Ltd \n(\u201cTellus\u201d) as  a welder  at a shipyard. He  is right-handed.\nThe Patient\u2019s  history\n4 On 7 August  2011, while at work, the Patient sustained a crush injury to \nthe fingertip of his right middle finger resulting in loss of the soft tissue  and a \ncomminuted fracture of the finger. The Patient was taken to the Hospital, and \nseen by Dr Looi on that day. Dr Looi performed  the first stage  of a two-stage \nthenar flap surgery on the Patient\u2019s finger. The first stage  of the surgery \ninvolved attaching the Patient\u2019s injured finger to a skin flap from the thenar \neminence (ie, the group  of muscles at the base of the thumb on the palm  side) \nof the same  hand (\u201cthe  First Stage surgery\u201d). The purpose of the First Stage \nsurgery was to allow the blood vessels in the palm to sustain the tissue  of the \nfinger as it healed.  The second stage would then involve detaching the healed  \nfinger from the flap by dividing  the flap (\u201cthe Second  Stage  surgery\u201d).\n5 After the surgery, the Patient was hospitalised for one night. Dr Looi left \nnotes for the staff of the Hospital instructing them to discharge the Patient the \nnext day with one day of medical leave and seven days of light duties thereafter. \nHe also stated that he would review the Patient the next day. That night, the \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nSingapore Medical Council v Looi Kok Poh [2019]  SGHC  134\n3Patient reported a pain score of nine (out of ten). A score of ten indicated  \n\u201csevere pain\u201d, while  a score of six to nine indicated \u201cmoderate pain\u201d.\n6 A nurse\u2019s case sheet recorded  that the Patient was visited on the morning \nof 8 August  2011  by Mr Jimmy Chia (\u201cMr Chia\u201d),  a safety officer with Tellus  \nwho had asked for the Patient to be discharged.  The Patient was then seen by \nDr Stephen  Tan, the Resident Medical Officer,  who obtained Dr Looi\u2019s \nconfirmation and discharged the Patient.  On discharge, Dr Stephen  Tan issued \na medical  certificate  granting the Patient two days\u2019 medical leave, ending \n8 August 2011  (ie, that day), only. No light duties were given. In accordance \nwith Dr Looi\u2019s instructions,  Dr Stephen Tan held the Patient back following \ndischarge to see Dr Looi that same  afternoon. That afternoon, Dr Looi recorded \nthat the Patient\u2019s  wound was clear,  and scheduled  him for a follow-up  review \non 12 August 2011. No certification for medical  leave  or light duties was given \nat this consultation.\n7 On 12 August  2011, after examining the Patient, Dr Looi scheduled  him \nfor another review  on 22 August 2011, and certified him fit for light duties from \n12 to 22 August 2011.\n8 On 20 August 2011, the Patient visited Singapore General Hospital \n(\u201cSGH\u201d) complaining of \u201cpain over the stitch  area\u201d.  He was tended  to by Dr Tan \nChong Hun. He indicated a pain score  of five out of ten. Dr Tan Chong Hun \nnoted that the Patient\u2019s general condition  was good, his right finger and hand \nwound were clean, slightly wet, and had no pus discharge. Dr Tan Chong Hun \ngave the Patient medical leave from 20 to 22 August 2011, which was the date \nof the Patient\u2019s next review with  Dr Looi.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nSingapore Medical Council v Looi Kok Poh [2019]  SGHC  134\n49 On 22 August 2011, the Patient went back to Dr Looi for his review.  \nAt this  session, Dr Looi recorded \u201cflap  well\u201d,  \u201cno infection\u201d  and \u201cviable\u201d.  \nAt that time, the  Patient refused Dr Looi\u2019s offer of one  week of medical  leave.\n10 On 7 September 2011, the Patient returned to SGH and was seen by \nDr Sreedharan Sechachalam (\u201cDr Sreedharan\u201d). Dr Sreedharan  recorded that \nthe Patient \u201cdid not want  to be seen in [the Hospital]\u201d due to \u201cshort MC\u201d. \nHe also recorded that according to the Patient, he was \u201cforced  to go to work \ndaily by employer  [and] mark attendance\u201d. He noted that the flap was viable. \nDr Sreedharan gave the Patient three days of medical leave,  from 7 to \n9 September 2011.\n11 On 9 September 2011, Dr Sreedharan performed the Second  Stage \nsurgery. Dr Sreedharan gave  the Patient hospitalisation  leave from \n10 September 2011 to 14 October 2011.\n12 The Patient  has since returned to India.\nProcedural history\n13 The SMC received the complaint forming the subject of these \nproceedings (\u201cthe  Complaint\u201d) on 3 October  2011. It was lodged by Mr Jolovan  \nWham from the Humanitarian Organisation for Migration Economics. Dr Looi \nwas notified  of this on 24 May 2012. On 7 July 2012,  Dr Looi submitted his \nexplanation to the SMC. Sometime later, on 27 January 2016, the SMC issued \nthe Notice of Inquiry to Dr Looi. The Notice  of Inquiry was amended on \n8 November 2016  to include two alternative charges.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nSingapore Medical Council v Looi Kok Poh [2019]  SGHC  134\n514 Dr Looi faced two charges  (collectively,  \u201cthe Charges\u201d), and two \ncharges in the alternative (collectively, \u201cthe Alternative Charges\u201d),  for \nprofessional misconduct under s 53(1)(d)  of the Medical Registration Act \n(Cap 174, 2014 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe Act\u201d). The Charges and the Alternative Charges \nrelated to Dr Looi\u2019s  reviews with the Patient  on 8 and 12 August  2011. It was \nalleged that, on each occasion, Dr Looi failed to ensure  that adequate  medical \nleave was given to the Patient, in light of the Patient\u2019s condition and occupation.\n15 The First Charge stated:\nThat you, DR LOOI  KOK POH, a medical practitioner, are \ncharged that whilst practising at [the Hospital]  on 8 August \n2011, did fail to ensure that adequate  medical  leave was given  \nto [the Patient], in light of his condition  and the nature  of his \noccupation.\nParticulars\n\u2026\n(f) The Thenar  Flap surgery  would be done in two stages, \nwith an intervening period of 14 to 21 days between the two \nstages. The Patient would require adequate rest of his right \nhand during the intervening period and would  be unable to use \nhis right hand effectively for many activities of daily living  and \nfor work.\n(g) The Patient was not given any medical leave for the \nperiod from 9 August 2011  to 11 August 2011, both dates \ninclusive, prior to his next review  scheduled for 12 August  \n2011.\n(h) Given the nature of the Patient\u2019s occupation,  his \ncondition on 8 August 2011, the requisite post-operative \nmanagement of the Patient after the first stage  of the Thenar  \nFlap Surgery and the upcoming second  stage  of the Patient\u2019s \nThenar Flap surgery, you failed to ensure that adequate medical \nleave was given to the Patient.\nAnd that in relation to the facts alleged,  you have been guilty of \nprofessional misconduct under [Section  53(1)(d) of the Act] in \nthat your conduct demonstrated an intentional, deliberate \ndeparture from standards  observed or approved  by members of \nthe profession of good repute and competency.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nSingapore Medical Council v Looi Kok Poh [2019]  SGHC  134\n6[emphasis in original  omitted]\n16 The Second Charge was largely similar, except that the relevant date \nwas 12 August 2011, and specified that the Patient had gone back to Dr Looi \nfor a follow-up review  on that date. The  Second Charge stated:\nThat you, DR LOOI  KOK POH, a medical practitioner, are \ncharged that whilst practising  at [the Hospital] on 12 August \n2011, did fail to ensure that adequate  medical  leave was given  \nto [the Patient], in light of his condition  and the nature  of his \noccupation. \nParticulars\n\u2026\n(e) During  the intervening period,  the Patient\u2019s right middle  \nfingertip was attached via a Thenar  flap to the volar side of the \nmetacarpo-phalangeal joint region  of the thumb. The Patient  \nwould require  adequate  rest of his right hand during the \nintervening period and would be unable  to use his right hand \neffectively for many  activities of daily living and for work.\n(f) At a follow-up review of the Patient on 12 August 2011, \nyou gave the Patient light duties for a period of eleven (11) days \nfrom 12 August 2011 to 22 August  2011,  and no medical leave.\n(g) Given the nature of the Patient\u2019s occupation,  his \ncondition on 12 August 2011, the requisite  post-operative  \nmanagement of the Patient after the first stage  of the Thenar  \nFlap surgery  and the upcoming second stage  of the Patient\u2019s \nThenar Flap surgery, medical leave  should have been given to \nthe Patient,  and it was inappropriate  for you to certify the \nPatient fit for light duties  from 12 August 2011  to 22 August \n2011.\nAnd that in relation to the facts alleged,  you have been guilty of \nprofessional misconduct under Section 53(1)( d) of [the Act] in \nthat your conduct demonstrated an intentional, deliberate \ndeparture from standards  observed or approved  by members of \nthe profession of good repute and competency.\n[emphasis in original  omitted]\n17 It is evident that the Charges were framed  pursuant to the first limb of \nthe test for professional misconduct as laid down in Low Cze Hong v Singapore \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nSingapore Medical Council v Looi Kok Poh [2019]  SGHC  134\n7Medical Council [2008] 3 SLR(R) 612 (\u201cLow Cze Hong\u201d).  In Low Cze Hong , \nthe High Court held that professional misconduct could be made  out in at least \ntwo situations as follows (at [37]):\n(a) where  there is an intentional,  deliberate departure from standards \nobserved or approved by members  of the profession of good repute and \ncompetency; and\n(b) where  there has been  such serious  negligence  that it objectively  \nportrays an abuse of the privileges which  accompany registration  as a \nmedical practitioner.\n18 The Alternative Charges essentially  mirrored  the Charges in terms of the \nparticulars, except  that they were framed pursuant  to the second limb of the test \nfor professional misconduct as stated  in Low  Cze Hong .\n19 At the inquiry, the SMC  called five witnesses, namely, Mr Wham; \nDr Stephen Tan; Dr Tan Chong Hun and Dr Sreedharan, the two doctors from \nSGH who had seen the Patient; and Dr Vaikunthan  Rajaratnam \n(\u201cDr Rajaratnam\u201d), a Senior  Consultant Hand Surgeon in the Department of \nOrthopaedic Surgery  at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, as its expert witness.\n20 Dr Looi testified in his own defence, and also called five witnesses, \nnamely, Mr Tay Boon Leong (\u201cMr  Tay\u201d), the Health, Safety  and Environment \nManager at Sembawang  Shipyard Pte Ltd; Mr Chia, the safety  officer with \nTellus; Ms Vicki Pang Pik Kwan (\u201cMs Pang\u201d), an occupational therapist;  \nMs Joanne Ho Pek Ling (\u201cMs Ho\u201d), a Senior Staff Nurse at the Hospital;  and \nDr Tan Soo Heong,  a Senior Hand  Consultant at Mount Elizabeth Medical \nCentre, as  his expert witness.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nSingapore Medical Council v Looi Kok Poh [2019]  SGHC  134\n8The Tribunal\u2019s decision\n21 The Tribunal  delivered its written decision  (\u201cthe GD\u201d)  in May 2018, and \nconvicted Dr Looi on the Charges.  The Tribunal ordered  that Dr Looi:\n(a) be suspended for a term of  six months;\n(b) be censured;\n(c) give a written  understanding  to the SMC  that he would not \nengage in the conduct complained of or any similar conduct; and\n(d) pay the costs and expenses of incidental  to the proceedings, \nincluding the costs of SMC\u2019s solicitors, to the SMC.\n22 The Tribunal held that the First Charge was made out. In reaching this \ndecision, the Tribunal made the following findings:\n(a) Dr Looi, as the primary doctor who in fact reviewed the Patient \non the afternoon  of discharge, could not avoid responsibility for the \nPatient\u2019s post-operative management on the basis that there had been a \nmiscommunication between him and Dr Stephen  Tan in the morning  of \ndischarge. Further, even taking Dr Looi\u2019s intended plan of one day of \nmedical leave and seven days of light duties, the Tribunal found that it \nwas not the practice to have  ordered light duties on the second post-\noperative day for someone in the  Patient\u2019s circumstances.\n(b) With regard to Dr Looi\u2019s contention  that he had used good \nsurgical technique \u2013 in particular,  an axial  pattern  thenar flap surgery,  \nas opposed  to a random  pattern thenar  flap surgery \u2013 the Tribunal  noted \nthat Dr Looi\u2019s medical  records did not refer  to an axial pattern flap, \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nSingapore Medical Council v Looi Kok Poh [2019]  SGHC  134\n9Dr Looi had raised his use of an axial  pattern flap only belatedly, and \nDr Looi\u2019s expert reports similarly omitted mention of such a technique. \nDespite that, the Tribunal was prepared to accept  his evidence that he \nhad performed  an axial pattern flap surgery. However, Dr Looi did not \nadduce evidence  to support his claim  that axial  pattern  flap surgery had \nsuch a significant effect on post-operative management that it permitted  \nlight duties from  the second post-operative day.\n(c) Dr Looi  had not clinically assessed the Patient\u2019s suitability for \nlight duties.  He had decided almost immediately after the First Stage \nsurgery on the type and amount of leave, and admitted that he had not \neven considered the Patient\u2019s pain score of nine on the night of 7 August \n2011. His plan also failed to take into account the sedating effect of the \nPatient\u2019s medication.\n(d) The Tribunal  accepted the evidence  that medical leave  ought  \nto have been provided until the flap was divided, particularly given the \n7% loss of function  in the Patient\u2019s  dominant hand, and the need to \nprotect the flap until the  Second Stage surgery.\n(e) Dr Looi had no good explanation for failing to check the \nPatient\u2019s medical leave when he reviewed the Patient on the afternoon \nof 8 August 2011.  Dr Looi  had also ignored  basic factors such as the \nPatient\u2019s injury, the recovery  that he needed  until the Second  Stage \nsurgery, and the Patient\u2019s  pain levels when he decided on the Patient\u2019s  \nmedical leave.  The Tribunal thus found that Dr Looi\u2019s departure from  \nacceptable practice had been  intentional.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nSingapore Medical Council v Looi Kok Poh [2019]  SGHC  134\n10(f) Dr Looi had, in his conduct,  intentionally and deliberately \ndeparted from his duty to establish that there  were adequate conditions \nfor rest and rehabilitation,  in particular, his duty to establish  the \nexistence and nature of light duty arrangements. There was no evidence \nthat Dr Looi  made efforts to establish the existence and nature of light \nduties. Instead, he had left it to Tellus  to decide how the Patient would \nspend the time  until the  review on 12 August 2011.\n23 On the Second Charge, the Tribunal found, on similar reasoning as per \nthe First Charge, that Dr Looi had intentionally  and deliberately departed from \nthe accepted practice of the medical  profession. In particular, it was not the \npractice to certify  a welder with the Patient\u2019s injuries as fit for light duties on \nthe fifth post-operative day following First Stage surgery and pending division \nof the flap at the Second Stage surgery. Further,  the Tribunal noted that Dr Looi \ncould not explain why he offered the Patient a week of medical  leave, or why \nthe Patient refused the  medical leave, at the review on 22 August  2011.\n24 On the Alternative Charges,  the Tribunal noted that it would also have \nfound Dr Looi guilty of the Alternative Charges.  The Tribunal stated  that \nDr Looi had, by his own admission, failed to consider the Patient\u2019s  pain levels, \nlet alone the existence and nature of light duty arrangements when he ordered  \nthe same.\n25 On sentencing, the Tribunal  noted  that the SMC sought 18 months\u2019  \nsuspension for each charge, with the suspensions to run consecutively, while \nDr Looi sought a fine of $20,000 to $30,000. The Tribunal considered the \nvarious aggravating and mitigating factors and decided that in the circumstances \na fine would  not be sufficient,  and a term of suspension  was appropriate. As the \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nSingapore Medical Council v Looi Kok Poh [2019]  SGHC  134\n11Charges were of a similar  nature and arose from two appointments over a short \nperiod, the Tribunal took the view that it was appropriate to sanction  Dr Looi \nfor his professional misconduct as a whole, instead of separately  for each \nCharge as urged by the SMC. The Tribunal  considered that an aggregate term \nof suspension for 12 months was appropriate,  but reduced it by half (ie, six \nmonths) on account  of the inordinate  delay on the part of the SMC in instituting \nproceedings against Dr  Looi.\nThe parties\u2019  cases  on"}

In any event, the \nsum of $40,000 allegedly owed by SGCC  to the Defendant was again wholly  \nspeculative and unsupported by evidence. \n32 I found that there  was no debt due or accruing due from  SGCC to the \nDefendant that could  be garnished  under the Second GO, because the \nagreement between  them  in relation  to the August  Performances had been \nterminated and there  was no further  amount due from SGCC to the Defendant \nwhen the Second GO was served  on SGCC.  I rejected the Plaintiff\u2019s assertion \nthat the agreement  between SGCC  and the Defendant had never been  \nterminated and that SGCC was attempting to mislead  the Plaintiff into \n14\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nSunny Metal & Engineering Pte Ltd v Lee Xin Ben Jimmy  [2019]  SGHC  135\nbelieving that the August  Performances were cancelled to help the Defendant \nevade payments due under the  Second GO.\n33 SGCC\u2019s account of how it terminated  the Defendant\u2019s engagement and \nengaged Abdul  Ghani  to carry on with the August Performances was \nsupported by contemporaneous documentary  evidence. On 1 August 2018, the \nDefendant emailed  SGCC to inform SGCC  that in view of the garnishee \nmatters, he was not able to complete  his contract as he would not be able to \nfinance the performers\u2019 fees, accommodation  and other costs. He also \nsuggested that SGCC may wish to engage another person to see this through.30 \nOn 3 August 2018, the Defendant  emailed  SGCC to confirm that he agreed to \nthe termination of his engagement, and recommended Abdul Ghani to replace \nhim and continue with the preparation  and completion of the August  \nPerformances.31 On 6 August 2018, SGCC  wrote to the Defendant to formally \ninform him of the termination of his contract with SGCC with immediate \neffect.32 SGCC  also wrote  to Abdul Ghani to confirm his appointment to \nmanage the August  Performances  for a total fee of $9,000.33 SGCC produced  a \ncheque dated 14 August 2018  for $9,000, made in favour of Abdul Ghani,  and \nAbdul Ghani confirmed  by email  on 20 September 2018 that he had received \nthe $9,000 as payment for  managing the August Performances.34 \n34 Further,  I rejected the Plaintiff\u2019s allegation  that the contract between \nSGCC and the Defendant was never terminated,  as it did not make  sense. If \n30 Chew\u2019s affidavit (11  Jan 2019), p 45.\n31 Chew\u2019s affidavit (11  Jan 2019), p 46.\n32 Chew\u2019s affidavit (11  Jan 2019), p 47.\n33 Chew\u2019s affidavit (11  Jan 2019), p 48.\n34 Chew\u2019s affidavit (23 Aug 2018), p 16; Chew\u2019s  affidavit (24 Sept 2018),  p 6; Chew\u2019s  \naffidavit (11  Jan 2019), p 50.\n15\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nSunny Metal & Engineering Pte Ltd v Lee Xin Ben Jimmy  [2019]  SGHC  135\nthe allegation  were true, SGCC  would potentially be exposing itself to double \nliability by entering into an agreement  with Abdul Ghani  for the same \nperformances whilst  the contract between it and  the Defendant remained afoot. \n35 I also rejected  the Plaintiff\u2019s allegation  that Abdul Ghani was the \nDefendant\u2019s agent to receive  the $9,000 from  SGCC,  as there  is no evidence  to \nsuggest that this was the case. On the contrary, the documents, including the \nletter of appointment of Abdul Ghani  by SGCC, are cogent  evidence of his \nappointment to replace the Defendant.  It would not have  assisted  the \nPlaintiff\u2019s case even if Abdul  Ghani  were  the Defendant\u2019s agent and collected  \nthe cheque for the Defendant. The fact remains  that before the Second  GO was \nserved on SGCC, it had handed  the cheque to Abdul Ghani on 17 August 2018 \n(the second night of the August Performances).35 As I have held, once a \ncheque is issued  by a garnishee to discharge its debt due to the judgment \ndebtor prior to being  served a garnishee  order (and this would equally apply to \nthe judgment debtor\u2019s agent who receives  the cheque  on his behalf), it is not \nobliged to stop payment on  the cheque.\n36 Finally, that the Defendant  performed  at the August Performances did \nnot support the Plaintiff\u2019s case.  I accepted Chew\u2019s  explanation  that the \nDefendant had informed Chew that he was doing so for free as there was an \nexpectation he would perform at that event.36 I also accepted Chew\u2019s \nexplanation that the August 2018 Performances continued to be advertised on \nSGCC\u2019s website as involving the Defendant as a performer, even though  \nSGCC had terminated  its agreement with him, because it failed to change the \n35 Chew\u2019s affidavit (23  Aug 2018), para 20; Chew\u2019s affidavit (11  Jan 2019), para 42.\n36 Chew\u2019s affidavit (11  Jan 2019), para 45.\n16\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nSunny Metal & Engineering Pte Ltd v Lee Xin Ben Jimmy  [2019]  SGHC  135\ninformation on the website.  In any event, the show was going to go ahead, so \nthe advertisement  pertaining to it continued to remain posted  on the website.37 \n37  It did not follow from the fact that the Defendant performed that he \nwas obliged to do so, or that SGCC  owed him money for his performance.  \nSGCC had already paid half the sum under the Second Quotation  to the \nDefendant in around May 2018 before  the agreement with the Defendant \npertaining to the August  Performances was terminated. As for the remaining  \namount under the Second  Quotation, the obligation to make  payment to the \nDefendant could not have arisen,  whether  under the agreement pursuant to the \nSecond Quotation (which had been  terminated)  or under the 2016 Agreement \n(which I  found did not exist). \n38 Hence,  when the Second GO was served  on SGCC, there was no \nfurther debt due or accruing due from SGCC  to the Defendant and the \nPlaintiff\u2019s claim in respect  of the Second  GO failed. The Plaintiff\u2019s assertion \nthat SGCC  was colluding with the Defendant or Abdul Ghani to put up a sham  \narrangement to avoid  paying the Plaintiff was not borne out by the evidence. \nSGCC would have stood to gain nothing from  attempting to evade  the GOs \nbecause its liabilities  pertaining to the performances, had they existed, would \nhave fallen  due anyway.\nConclusion \n39 In conclusion,  I found that the Plaintiff had failed to show that there \nwas a debt due or accruing due at the time of the First or Second  GO. I \ntherefore dismissed the  Plaintiff\u2019s"}

Soh stated that he understood that it was by grace that he could still keep his job. If there were a downturn in the oil market and retrenchment, Soh believed that he would probably be one of the first to be retrenched given his disabilities. If he were to lose his job, it would not be possible for him to find another job in the same field.

Ram and Mrs Ram alleged that Navin and Mrs Navin attempted to make life miserable for them at the Poole Road property. Ram gave the example of the visit by his elder brother and sister-in-law in May 2016. They had come from India to visit Ram and Mrs Ram at the Poole Road property. Ram alleged that it was an embarrassing episode for him, as his guests saw for themselves how Ram and Mrs Ram were effectively restricted to living in their bedroom. 50', 'Ram also alleged that his guests were not accorded the respect due to them as elders. 51', '37\\u2003CCTV recordings at the Poole Road property were played in court showing Ram shouting and hurling vulgarities. One recording showed Ram walking around the house holding a knife which he had obtained from the kitchen. Ram claimed that he was merely going to cut a piece of rope. Another recording showed Ram banging and kicking at a door to one of the rooms. On 12 July 2016, Mrs Navin obtained an expedited protection order against Ram (on an ex parte basis), on the grounds that there was imminent danger of family violence being committed against her and her children. 52', 'The order was eventually discharged on the ground that a personal protection order was not necessary because (a) there was no physical violence, (b) Mrs Navin had proved only one incident of family violence against her, and (c) Ram had confirmed that he would not return to the Poole Road property as long as Navin and Mrs Navin lived there. 53', '38\\u2003On 14 July 2016, Mrs Ram was unwell and suffered from body aches. Navin\u2019s sister, Kusum Jain, arranged for a lady to go to the Poole Road property to give Mrs Ram a massage. Navin was not at home. Mrs Navin spoke to him about it and he told her to call the police, which she did. Navin claimed that he told Mrs Navin to call the police because Mrs Ram did not respond to her questions about the lady. Navin claimed that he did not want illegal helpers working in the house and that Ram had previously threatened to report to the Ministry of Manpower that Navin had illegal maids at the Poole Road property.', '39\\u2003On 31 July 2016, an incident happened at the Poole Road property during which Ram reacted to something Navin said by pulling down his pants and exposing himself to Navin in the presence of Navin\u2019s wife and son. The CCTV recording of this incident was played in court. Ram claimed that Navin had told him \u201cI will f--- you\u201d. Navin denied this. The CCTV had no voice recording. Navin called the police who, upon arrival, advised Ram to leave the Poole Road property.', '40\\u2003Ram returned to the Poole Road property the next day. Navin called the police again. What actually happened after the police arrived was in dispute. In the event, the police arrested both Ram and Mrs Ram and charged them with criminal trespass. 54', 'Ram and Mrs Ram spent the night in the police lock-up and were released on bond the next day. Ram claimed that since then, Mrs Ram and he have not been able to access the Poole Road property to pack and retrieve their belongings. Although Navin had his parents\u2019 belongings packed and sent to them, Ram and Mrs Ram alleged that many of their belongings were missing.'"}

{"casename":"2019_SGHC_140","fact":"the facts. \n48 As set out in Tan Chor Jin v Public Prosecutor [2008] 4 SLR(R) 306 at \n[46], the defence of private defence requires that the accused show:\n(a)  An offence affecting the human body has been committed or is \nreasonably apprehended (s 97 of the Penal Code); \n(b) There was no time to seek the protection of the authorities \n(s 99(3) of the Penal Code); \nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLow Song Chye v PP[2019] SGHC 140\n17(c) At the time of acting in private defence, he reasonably \napprehended danger due to an attempt or threat by the victim to commit \nan offence affecting the body (s 102 of the Penal Code); and \n(d) The harm caused to the victim was reasonably necessary in \nprivate defence, with due allowance given to the dire circumstances \nunder which he was acting (s 99(4) of the Penal Code).\n49 In my opinion, the Magistrate was right to find that private defence did \nnot apply on the facts. Even if it is accepted that there was a reasonable \napprehension of danger, which was in itself questionable on the facts, I would \nagree with the Magistrate\u2019s finding that there were more appropriate ways of \nrestraining the victim. In essence, the harm caused to the victim was not \nreasonably necessary, having due regard to the circumstances under which the \naccused had been acting. \n50 As noted above at [ 38] and [ 45], the accused slapped the victim hard \nenough for her to suffer an eardrum perforation. This occurred after the accused \nhad pushed her against the wall and grabbed her neck. I do not accept the \nsuggestion that any danger posed by the victim\u2019s earlier act of throwing the pool \nballs, or the fact that she was struggling, made it reasonable for him to grab her \nby the neck, or slap her with such force. This was particularly since, as the \nMagistrate had noted, at the time the offence was committed, the victim had in \nfact stopped throwing the pool balls. The harm caused to the victim was \ntherefore disproportionate in the circumstances, and the accused cannot rely on \nprivate defence in the present case. \n51 I turn now to the defence of necessity. Section 81 of the Penal Code \nreads:\nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLow Song Chye v PP[2019] SGHC 140\n18Act likely to cause harm but done without a criminal intent, \nand to prevent other harm\n81. Nothing is an offence merely by reason of its being done \nwith the knowledge that it is likely to cause harm, if it be done \nwithout any criminal intention to cause harm, and in good faith \nfor the purpose of preventing or avoiding other harm to person \nor property.\n52 Section 81 would not apply to exculpate the accused if he is found to \nhave \u201ccriminal intention\u201d to cause hurt. As I have indicated at [ 45] above, the \nMagistrate\u2019s finding that the accused intended to hurt the victim was correct. \nand hence s 81 of the Penal Code finds no application in this case. \n53 I should add that s 81 of the Penal Code would not have been relevant \neven if the mens rea had been knowledge of the likelihood of causing harm \nrather than criminal intention. The accused would not have been able to satisfy \nthe additional requirement of having acted \u201cin good faith\u201d, having regard to \ns 52 of the Penal Code which requires that he must have acted with due care and \nattention. Further, the illustrations to s 81 of the Penal Code suggest that the \ndefence of necessity is intended to cover situations in which far greater harm \nwould have occurred had the offending act not been done. This can be seen from \nillustration (a) which compares 20 or 30 passengers\u2019 lives being at risk to two \nlives, or illustration (c), which compares 100 lives to six. The present case was \nnot a comparable situation by any measure. There is no indication that greater \nor even substantial harm would have occurred if the accused had not assaulted \nthe victim in the manner he did. As such, it is clear to me that s 81 of the Penal \nCode would not have applied even if the mens rea was one of knowledge.\n54 I therefore dismiss the accused\u2019s"}

The tribunal held an evidential hearing in May 2017 in the plaintiff\u2019s absence and issued its final award in July 2017.

The plaintiff argues that, even if the tribunal had jurisdiction, the composition of the tribunal was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties. The crux of the plaintiff\u2019s argument on this ground is that the tribunal constituted to determine the parties\u2019 dispute comprised a sole arbitrator even though their arbitration agreement stipulates that it should comprise three arbitrators.', '8\\u2003I shall deal with the plaintiff\u2019s two grounds in turn.

{"casename":"2019_SGHC_142","fact":"the facts of this case illustrates two ways in which the three-stage \ninquiry could be said to operate arbitrarily.\n122 First, if the SIAC Rules did not include Rule 18.1, it is likely that the \noutcome of the inquiry as to the seat of the arbitration would have pointed to the \nPRC. I would have been obliged to invalidate the parties\u2019 arbitration agreement, \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nBNA v BNB[2019] SGHC 142\n53despite their manifest intent to arbitrate their disputes. It may be said that that \noutcome is not arbitrary but serves simply to show that there is only so much \nwhich the law can do to save an inapt and inept arbitration agreement.

Assume, \nhowever, that PRC law had changed between the time the parties entered into \nthis arbitration agreement and the time the parties\u2019 arbitration commenced, with \nthe effect that the parties\u2019 arbitration agreement would no longer be invalid \nunder PRC law if it were to be seated in Shanghai but administered by the SIAC. \nIn that scenario, it is virtually certain that there would have been no \njurisdictional challenge, and the arbitration would have proceeded on the basis \nthat the seat of the arbitration is the PRC and the proper law of the parties\u2019 \narbitration agreement is PRC law. To that extent, it appears to me that the three-\nstage inquiry permits the court to give effect to the parties\u2019 express, implied or \nimputed intention when the arbitration is commenced, not their intention when \nthey entered into the arbitration agreement. It might then be said that the three-\nstage inquiry is simply Professor Born\u2019s wider validation principle in disguise, \nwith the latter at least having the merit of being honest about its objective and \ntransparent in its operation.  \nVinodh Coomaraswamy\nJudge \nThio Shen Yi SC, Thara Rubini Gopalan and Andrew Neil Purchase \n(TSMP Law Corporation) for the plaintiff;\nWilliam Ong, Tan Xeauwei and Sheryl Lauren Koh Quanli (Allen & \nGledhill LLP) for the defendants. \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nBNA v BNB[2019] SGHC 142\n55\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)"}

{"casename":"2019_SGHC_148","fact":"The background facts are set out in full in Alam Jahangir v Mega Metal \nPte Ltd [2018] SGHC 198 (\u201cAlam Jahangir\u201d) and I will set out only the facts \nrelevant for this assessment of damages hearing. The plaintiff is a 44-year-old \nBangladeshi national who was employed by the defendant as a metal melter, \ncaster and rolling mill operator. On 16 May 2016, the plaintiff operated a \nmachine which separated waste metal cans and attempted to dislodge two cans \nthat were stuck in the rollers of the machine. His arm was subsequently caught \nand pulled into the rollers.\n2 The plaintiff was sent to Ng Teng Fong General Hospital for emergency \ntreatment. He sustained a crush injury to his right arm, had a degloving near \namputation of the mid-upper segment of the right arm with a concomitant open \nfracture of the right humerus, and underwent an arm reattachment procedure \nand a wrist fusion surgery. In Alam Jahangir, I held that the defendant had \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nAlam Jahangir v Mega Metal Pte Ltd[2019] SGHC 148\n2breached its duty of care owed to the plaintiff by not having sufficient fencing \nto stop workers from reaching into the rollers, and found that the plaintiff was \n50% contributory negligent. The plaintiff returned to Bangladesh on 1 Jan 2017 \nand is currently a chicken farmer earning $250 per month. This hearing before \nme is for the assessment of damages.\n3 I will first deal with the general damages, which includes pain and \nsuffering, future medical treatment, future transport expenses and the loss of \nfuture earning capacity. Subsequently, I will deal with the special damages, \nwhich includes pre-trial loss of earnings, medical expenses, transport expenses \nand the loss of future earnings.\n4 I am of the view that an award of $107,000 for pain and suffering is \nreasonable. I take into account the loss arising from each distinct injury, before \nconsidering the injuries to ensure that the overall award is reasonable (Lua Bee \nKiang (administrator of the estate of Chew Kong Seng, deceased) v Yeo Chee \nSiong [2019] 1 SLR 145 (\u201cLua Bee Kiang\u201d) at [12]\u2013[13]). I will explain how I \narrived at this figure.\n5 First, for the degolving near amputation of the mid-upper segment of the \nplaintiff\u2019s right arm (\u201cNear Amputation\u201d), Mr Srinivasan, counsel for the \nplaintiff, asserts that based on the Guidelines for the Assessment of General \nDamages in Personal Injury Cases (Academy Publishing, 2010) (\u201cThe 2010 \nGuidelines\u201d), the court generally award damages in the range of $70,000 to \n$76,000 for the amputation of one arm above the elbow. Mr Srinivasan submits \nthat a higher sum of $120,000 should be awarded to account for inflation. \nMr Ramasamy, counsel for the defendant, argues that since the plaintiff\u2019s arm \nwas reattached, the appropriate category in The 2010 Guidelines should be for \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nAlam Jahangir v Mega Metal Pte Ltd[2019] SGHC 148\n3severe injuries and the court generally award damages in the range of $45,000 \nto $63,000. Mr Ramasamy submits that a sum of $55,000 should be awarded. \nThe plaintiff now has no natural movement of his arm, and even if it was \nreattached, it has limited use and function. I am of the view that Mr Srinivasan\u2019s \nclaim regarding the impact of inflation is exaggerated, and I thus award a sum \nof $75,000 for the Near Amputation.\n6 Secondly, Mr Srinivasan submits that a sum of $20,000 should be \nawarded for the concomitant open fracture of the right humerus (\u201cOpen \nFracture\u201d). Mr Srinivasan relied on the cases of Ang Siam Hua v Teo Cheng \nHoe [2004] SGHC 147 and Tan Shwu Leng v Singapore Airlines [2001] \nSGCA 70 where the court awarded $15,000 and $13,000 respectively for the \nfracture of the humerus. Mr Ramasamy demurs and submits that general \ndamages awarded for the loss of functional use of right arm above should \nencompass all other injuries, since they are all located on the upper right limb \nand making separate awards will lead to over compensation. There is no reason \nwhy the court cannot account for the loss arising from each distinct injury, so \nlong as the overall award is proportionate to the injury suffered (Lua Bee Kiang \nat [10]\u2013[13]), which is the case here. Since the plaintiff has suffered a severe \ncrush injury and was required to go through numerous operations, I award him \na sum of $15,000 for the Open Fracture.\n7 Thirdly, Mr Srinivasan submits that a sum of $25,000 ought to be \nawarded for the plaintiff\u2019s multiple scars. Mr Srinivasan relied on The 2010 \nGuidelines where the courts generally award damages in the range of $5,000 to \n$15,000 for multiple scars, and the case of Chiam Kim Loke v Lee Wing Hoong \n& Anor [2004] SGHC 37 (\u201cChiam Kim Loke\u201d) where the court awarded $20,000 \nfor a plaintiff who had over 25 scars on his leg, hip and hand. Mr Ramasamy \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nAlam Jahangir v Mega Metal Pte Ltd[2019] SGHC 148\n4argues that since the plaintiff has only six scars, he should not obtain any award \nabove the $20,000 in Chiam Kim Loke. The plaintiff has approximately 13 scars, \nwith one measuring up to 26cm at the posterior aspect of his right shoulder. \nThese scars are severe enough to justify an award of $15,000 for multiple scars.\n8 Lastly, Mr Srinivasan submits that a sum of $5,000 ought to be awarded \nfor the wasting of the plaintiff\u2019s right shoulder girdle muscles, and referred to \nShyam Sundar Yadav v Reganathan s\/o Sammandham in DC Suit No 3149 of \n2000 (\u201cShyam\u201d) and Shela Devi d\/o Perumal v Rawi bin Nahwari in HC Suit \nNo 1191 of 1999 (\u201cShela\u201d) where a sum of $2,000 for muscle wasting was \nawarded in both instances. I award the plaintiff $2,000 for muscle wasting. \nThere was no evidence suggesting that the plaintiff\u2019s condition here was worse \nthan that in either Shyam or Shela.\n9 In total, the plaintiff is awarded general damages in sum of $107,000 for \npain and suffering. In the light of the fact that the plaintiff no longer has any \nnatural movement or feeling from his right shoulder to his hand, and that his \nright arm is no longer functional, an overall award of $107,000 is proportionate \nto his injury suffered. I move on to the plaintiff\u2019s future medical treatment.\n10 I award the plaintiff a sum of $9,804.80 for his future medical expenses. \nThis consists of the following:\n(a) $2,364.80 for consultations with a Hand & Reconstructive \nMicrosurgery Specialist at the National University Hospital. Dr Lee \nSoon Tai, the plaintiff\u2019s expert witness, opines that follow-up \nconsultations are necessary, as the plaintiff has undergone a traumatising \nreconstruction surgery and it is necessary to monitor the pain and \ndiscomfort the plaintiff is experiencing. On the contrary, Dr Chang Wei \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nAlam Jahangir v Mega Metal Pte Ltd[2019] SGHC 148\n5Chun, the defendant\u2019s expert witness, believes that the plaintiff does not \nrequire any further consultation since he has undergone all the necessary \nprocedures. After a reconstruction surgery, it may be in the plaintiff\u2019s \nbest interest to periodically monitor the pain and numbness in his arm. I \nobserved at the hearing on 20 March 2019, that the plaintiff was \nconstantly clutching his right arm, seemingly in pain. I accept Dr Lee\u2019s \nproposal of two consultations per year for a period of ten years at an \naverage cost of $118.24 per visit.\n(b) $1,000 for analgesia. Dr Lee opines that the plaintiff needs \nanalgesia for a total of five years at an average cost of $30 to $60 per \nmonth. Dr Chang agreed that the plaintiff requires analgesia, but only at \n$100 per year for five years from when he returned to Bangladesh. The \nplaintiff is now living in Bangladesh and will likely be purchasing \nanalgesia there. I award the plaintiff a sum of $1,000 calculated at an \nannual cost of $100 for ten years.\n(c) Dr Lee is of the view that the plaintiff requires Gabapentin, \nTramadol and Warfarin for 24 years at an average cost of $3.50 per day. \nDr Chang opines that these medications are unnecessary since they fall \ninto the same category as analgesia. I accept Dr Chang\u2019s opinion that \nthere is no necessity for these other painkillers.\n(d) $1,760 for hand occupational therapy. Dr Lee opines that the \nplaintiff requires twenty sessions (at ten sessions per course) of hand \noccupational therapy at $105.90 per session for the next five years, while \nDr Chang demurs and states that the plaintiff only requires ten sessions \n(one course) at $70 per session. I am of the view that it is in the plaintiff\u2019s \nbest interest to undergo two courses of hand occupational therapy, and \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nAlam Jahangir v Mega Metal Pte Ltd[2019] SGHC 148\n6award the plaintiff a sum of $1,760 calculated at an average cost of $88 \nper session for 20 sessions.\n(e) $4,680 for the removal of deep implants from the plaintiff\u2019s \nupper limb and post-operative hand occupational therapy. Dr Lee \nbelieves that the plaintiff\u2019s deep implants should be removed to allow \nthe bones to heal and strengthen over time. On the contrary, Dr Chang \nasserts that such a removal may result in another fracture, and the deep \nimplants should remain to strengthen the bone. In the light of the \ncontradicting expert opinions, it may perhaps be best to err on the safe \nside and I award the plaintiff a sum of $4,680 for the removal of his \nimplants and post-operative hand occupational therapy.\n11 The next claim is for future transport expenses. Mr Srinivasan and \nMr Ramasamy submits a sum of $1,000 and $100 respectively. It is expected \nthat transport expenses will be incurred, but the mode and frequency, not to \nmention the exact charges are not easy to determine. I think that $1000 is \nprobably too high, and $100, too low. Accordingly, I award the plaintiff a sum \nof $500 for his future transport expenses.\n12 The last claim for general damages is for the loss of earning capacity. \nAs enunciated by the Court of"}

Being more proficient in English, he oversaw the management of SWE\u2019s finance and accounts, while YTL focused more on sales. 1', '6\\u2003Subsequently, SWT was incorporated in 1993. The wholesale and manufacturing business of SWE was transferred to SWT. Under this arrangement, SWT functioned as the trading vehicle, and SWE became a property holding company. 2', '7\\u2003In 2009, another entity, SW Apparel Pte Ltd (\u201cSWA\u201d), was incorporated. The purpose was to grow and diversify the family business, and to allow the nephews of YTP and YTL, namely Yak Eng Hwee (\u201cHwee\u201d) and Yak Eng Siong (\u201cSiong\u201d), to play a greater role in the family business. Hwee and Siong are brothers. Eventually, the wholesale and manufacturing business was meant to be transferred from SWT to SWA, which would then become the trading vehicle of the group of companies. 3', '8\\u2003I should add that apart from SWE, SWT and SWA, the Swee Wan group companies also included three other entities in Malaysia.', '9\\u2003Turning to the ownership of SWE, before 10 April 2015, YTP and YTL held 370,000 shares (44.58% shareholding) and 362,000 shares (43.61% shareholding) respectively, being almost equal stakes in SWE. Hwee and Siong owned 41,500 shares (5.00% shareholding) each, which were transferred to them by YKL, their grandfather, before his death. The remaining three minority shareholders with 5,000 shares (0.60% shareholding) each were Wong Ah Yoke (YTP\u2019s wife), Tang Siew Cheng (YTL\u2019s then wife), and the estate of Ng Geok Chuan (the mother of YTP and YTL). 4', 'Sometime after 10 April 2015, Hwee and Siong transferred their shares to YTL (\u201cthe 2015 Transfer\u201d).

Siong owned a 10% stake, being 100,000 shares which he later transferred to YTL sometime after 10 April 2015. YTP and YTL were appointed as directors from the outset. YCW was appointed as a director on 28 September 2012.', '12\\u2003As for SWA, at the time of its incorporation, the shareholders were YTP (with 30% shareholding), YTL (with 30% shareholding), Hwee and Siong (with 20% shareholding each). All were directors of SWA. 5', 'By early 2012, Hwee was the only shareholder and director of SWA. 6', '13\\u2003Sometime in 2009, the then long-time auditor of SWE, SWT and SWA, Chua Soo Chiew (\u201cChua\u201d), informed YTP of irregularities in the accounts of the family business. At that time, Yak Puay Khim (\u201cKhim\u201d), the sister of Hwee and Siong, was the bookkeeper for SWE, SWT and SWA. 7', 'YTP did not inform YTL about Chua\u2019s concerns. 8', 'Chua\u2019s services as auditor were terminated on 7 October 2011. 9', 'On 28 October 2011, Chua wrote a letter addressed to Siong, detailing the transactions of concern. 10', '14\\u2003Subsequently, in or around February 2012, YTL and YTP discovered that they were no longer shareholders or directors of SWA. Upon investigation by YCW, it appeared that Hwee had previously procured their agreement to the transfers of shares and their resignations by asking them to sign certain documents on the pretext of those documents being a release of their obligations as guarantors of loans that SWA had previously taken out. 11', '15\\u2003With YCW\u2019s background in finance, YTP and YTL wanted her to continue to assist them to investigate into the financial affairs of the companies.

The matter was reported to the Commercial Affairs Department (\u201cCAD\u201d).', '18\\u2003In anticipation that further investigation into the suspicious transactions would be required, and that legal advice would have to be taken in relation to seeking recourse against Khim, Hwee and Siong, YTP and YTL agreed that YCW should be appointed as a director of SWE so that she could act as the point of contact between the companies and the lawyers. 15', 'As such, YCW was appointed SWE\u2019s director: see [10] above. In fact, YCW was also appointed a director of SWT: see [11] above.', '19\\u2003Subsequently, two accountancy firms, AccAssurance LLP (\u201cAccAssurance\u201d) and STRIX Strategies Pte Ltd (\u201cSTRIX\u201d), were engaged to assist in the preparation of a report on the investigation findings, and another firm, AccVisory Pte Ltd (\u201cAccVisory\u201d), was engaged to assist with the preparation of financial statements and filing of the annual returns of SWE and SWT. 16', 'AccVisory was also appointed to provide corporate secretarial services. 17', '20\\u2003Ultimately, the investigations culminated in the commencement of two sets of legal proceedings. On 28 February 2014, Suit Nos 235 and 236 of 2014 (\u201cSuits 235\/236\u201d) were commenced by SWE and SWT against, inter alia, Hwee, Siong and Khim for alleged misappropriation of funds from the companies. 18', '21\\u2003As against Khim, summary judgment was obtained in the sum of about $4,100,000. 19', 'As against Hwee and Siong, the claims in Suits 235\/236 were eventually settled pursuant to a settlement agreement dated 10 April 2015 (\u201cthe Suits 235\/236 Settlement Agreement\u201d). 20', 'By the agreement, Hwee and Siong were to pay SWE and SWT a sum of $600,000 by the earlier of the two dates being (i) 30 days from the completion date for the sale of Hwee\u2019s property; or (ii) 31 December 2017. 21', '22\\u2003Separately, Suit No 664 of 2014 (\u201cSuit 664\u201d) was commenced on 20 June 2014 by YTL in his personal capacity against both Hwee and SWA for the recovery of YTL\u2019s shares in SWA which had been transferred to Hwee. 22', 'This suit was also settled pursuant to a separate settlement agreement dated 10 April 2015 (\u201cthe Suit 664 Settlement Agreement\u201d). 23', 'By the agreement, Hwee and SWA agreed to pay YTL a sum of $2,150,000 in instalments, and for Hwee and Siong to transfer all of their shares in SWE to YTL ie, the 2015 Transfer referred to at [9] above. Further, Siong was to transfer all 100,000 of his shares in SWT to YTL: see [11] above. I note that while the Suit 664 Settlement Agreement refers to transfers of 40,000 shares each in SWE by Hwee and Siong, it is common ground between the parties that both Hwee and Siong each held 41,500 shares before the 2015 Transfer. Nothing, however, turns on this discrepancy.', '23\\u2003I should add that in separate criminal proceedings, Khim was sentenced to eight years\u2019 imprisonment. 24', '24\\u2003In the course of the investigations into Khim, Siong and Hwee\u2019s activities, it was also revealed that both YTP and YTL had withdrawn substantial sums of money from SWE and SWT. Indeed, in Suits 235\/236, Hwee counterclaimed against, inter alia, YTP and YTL for oppression, alleging that they had withdrawn sums from SWE for their personal use, without Hwee\u2019s knowledge and consent.', '25\\u2003These withdrawals were detailed in a spreadsheet prepared by AccVisory, which was sent to YCW via an email dated 9 October 2013 (\u201cthe AccVisory email\u201d): 25', '26\\u2003I pause to observe that out of the seven cheques issued to YTP listed in the AccVisory email, SWE acknowledged the sum of $447,700 by way of cheque number 793826 to be a payment of dividend to YTP. This was documented by way of the minutes of an annual general meeting on 25 June 2008, along with the sum of $441,650 by way of cheque number 793827 paid to YTL. 26', 'As such, subsequently, SWE did not treat these two amounts as owing from YTP and YTL respectively.', '27\\u2003On 14 November 2013, a directors\u2019 resolution was passed, regularising the withdrawals of the remaining sums by both YTP and YTL as interest-free loans repayable on demand (\u201cthe 2013 Resolution\u201d). The 2013 Resolution was signed by the directors of SWE at the time, ie, YTP, YTL and YCW, and stated as follows: 27', 'As regards cheque numbers 793485 and 793486 as referred to in the 2013 Resolution, it is not disputed that the correct references should in fact be to cheque numbers 793845 and 793846 respectively. 28', '28\\u2003Upon further review, SWE accepted that the amount in cheque number 394988 of $500,000 is not due from YTP. This was set out in a summary produced by YCW sometime after 25 April 2014 (\u201cYCW\u2019s summary\u201d). 29', 'As for the only remaining sum held against YTL of $500,000 paid out vide cheque number 606010, SWE accepted that YTL repaid this amount in October 2008.

According to YTL and YCW, there were discussions for YTP to repay the outstanding amount from the time the withdrawals were discovered, but to no avail. 31', 'Therefore, SWE commenced the present proceedings on 25 January 2017.', '30\\u2003While discussions were ongoing for YTP to repay the outstanding amount, a notice was issued on 21 August 2015 convening an annual general meeting of SWE. One of the matters to be dealt with was the re-election of directors: 32', '31\\u2003On 4 September 2015, the AGM was convened with only Tang Siew Cheng (YTL\u2019s ex-wife) and Low (as proxy for YTL) in attendance. YCW (a non-shareholder) presided as chairperson of the meeting. YTP did not attend, and called after the AGM was over to say that he could not attend as he had been ill.

According to Low, this rate was eventually bargained down by YTP to $100 per hour for all staff, including the lead partners. 34', 'However, according to YTP, he did not know about the Letter of Engagement. Low had suggested capping the professional fees at 8% of the recovered sum, and YTP had agreed to this. 35', '33\\u2003On 15 December 2014, a first progress bill for the sum of $301,881.70 was rendered to SWE and SWT.

On 1 November 1998, JCCL purportedly converted his status to that of an independent contractor and Yusoff stopped receiving Central Provident Fund (\u201cCPF\u201d) contributions from this point on. This change resulted in the revocation of Yusoff\u2019s employee benefits such as paid annual leave, medical coverage, annual wage supplement and so on. Yusoff was also permitted to conduct personal training sessions for non-members at the JCC gym outside working hours.', '7\\u2003Yusoff was the only gym instructor engaged at the club at least until 2014.

In 1972, as a child, Mr Sun was formally adopted by Mr Yang and Mdm Sun in Taiwan. He and his younger brother re-located to Singapore and lived with the couple for a period of eight and three years respectively. 5', 'Then, in 1982, at age 17, Mr Sun emigrated to the United States (\u201cthe US\u201d) to further his studies and live with his biological mother. His adoption by Mr Yang and Mdm Sun was nullified for this purpose. However, they remained close and he continued to visit Singapore once or twice a year to see his uncle and aunt. 6', '6\\u2003Sometime in the 1990s, the issue of Mr Sun\u2019s nullified adoption resurfaced. Mr Yang and Mdm Sun had considered emigrating to the US and it was agreed that Mr Sun would sponsor their visa applications. Unfortunately, the couple had forgotten that Mr Sun\u2019s adoption had been nullified years before and did not disclose this fact during the application process. Owing to this non-disclosure, Mr Yang\u2019s and Mdm Sun\u2019s visa applications were denied. 7', 'Mr Yang was greatly embarrassed by the incident and this became a sore topic of conversation between him and Mr Sun whenever the latter visited Singapore. 8', '7\\u2003The defendant emigrated to Singapore from Taiwan in 1972. He worked for his uncle, Mr Yang, for 14 years until 1984 when he set up his own construction business. However, he remained in contact with Mr Yang and Mdm Sun and continued to visit them regularly. This was also the evidence of the couple\u2019s long serving domestic helper, Mdm Looi Ah Mooi (\u201cMdm Looi\u201d). The defendant\u2019s two sons had dinner with the couple on a weekly basis.

In the mid-1990s, the defendant was granted a mandate to operate the joint accounts with Citibank. This was described by the parties as a \u201cpower of attorney\u201d in Citibank\u2019s standard form, although the actual document that was executed by Mr Yang and Mdm Sun was a \u201cLetter of Authority Application Form\u201d that was undated. 16', '13\\u2003In the mid-2000s, the defendant was granted a mandate to operate the joint accounts with UOB.

Around that time, Mr Yang also entrusted the defendant with the passbook for the POSB joint account passbook so that he could use the passbook for \u201cdeposit and drawing\u201d. 17', 'The defendant explained in his evidence that he was only able to deposit moneys into the POSB joint account but he could not withdraw any moneys from it. 18', 'This is disputed by Mr Sun. I will deal with this point later in my judgment.', '14\\u2003The defendant was given access to these accounts to assist Mr Yang \u201cin certain (and not all) financial matters\u201d. 19', 'Given their close relationship, Mr Yang reposed a significant degree of trust and confidence in the defendant to assist the couple with their affairs. By 2010, the defendant had taken on sole responsibility for managing Mr Yang\u2019s and Mdm Sun\u2019s living expenses. 20', 'Mdm Looi and Ms Ohmmar received reimbursements for their household expenditures by presenting their receipts to the defendant. 21', 'This was done weekly.', '15\\u2003Besides granting these mandates to operate the joint accounts, Mr Yang also provided the defendant with information about bank accounts which had been set up by Mr Yang and Mdm Sun in their names, and also in the names of their relatives, including the defendant\u2019s siblings, Mr Yang Chia-Ling and Mdm Lin Yang Min. He wrote letters to the defendant dated 21 August 1996 and 11 May 2005 setting out these accounts. 22', 'This was for the defendant\u2019s \u201cinformation and retention\u201d. Quite obviously, this was to ensure that the defendant was aware of the couple\u2019s finances in case anything should happen to them. In another letter dated 14 September 2009, Mr Yang also informed the defendant of other assets owned by the couple, including the details of a safe deposit box in Taiwan, jewellery, precious items and other valuables. 23', '16\\u2003In addition to the joint accounts, the couple also held personal bank accounts in Taiwan and joint bank accounts in the US. This is relevant because Mdm Sun\u2019s savings from the time she worked in Taiwan were remitted to Singapore in two tranches from her Taiwanese bank accounts to the UOB time deposit account 24', ':', '(a)\\u2003a sum of US$261,000 on or about 15 October 2007; 25', 'and', '(b)\\u2003a sum of US$157,000 on or about 19 November 2007. 26', '17\\u2003These transfers were overseen by Ms Hsu Chih-Chi (\u201cMs Hsu\u201d). Ms Hsu was the personal assistant of Mdm Sun\u2019s brother-in-law in Taiwan, one Mr Fan. She was instructed by Mr Yang and Mdm Sun to remit the moneys from Mdm Sun\u2019s Cathay United bank accounts (Account No. 020-50-XXXXXX-8 and 201-50-XXXXXX-4). 27', 'Ms Hsu had also earlier remitted a sum of US$12,070 from Mdm Sun\u2019s account on or about 20 June 2007. 28', 'This was on the instructions of Mr Fan. Ms Hsu was informed that Mr Yang and Mdm Sun had previously made an investment in Mr Fan\u2019s company and he was now returning that sum to them first by payment into one of Mdm Sun\u2019s Cathay United bank accounts, and then to the UOB time deposit account. 29', '18\\u2003On 29 November 2007, at the age of 90, Mr Yang made a will (\u201cthe Will\u201d) which appointed the defendant as the sole executor of his estate. 30', 'In the Will, Mr Yang set aside a sum of S$300,000 for the maintenance of Mdm Sun:', 'He bequeathed the remainder of his assets to be distributed amongst the defendant and the defendant\u2019s two siblings. Mr Yang did not specifically refer to the joint accounts in the Will. Mr Sun and other members of Mdm Sun\u2019s family were not included as beneficiaries.', '19\\u2003 At the time of the making of the Will, a bank statement from UOB produced in evidence showed that the UOB joint account had a balance of S$2,163,797.3. 31', 'The defendant did not disclose the bank statement from Citibank for November 2007, but the bank statement of 31 December 2003, which was closest in time to when the Will was made, showed that the couple had a total of S$1,313,053.11 in the Citibank joint account in savings and fixed-income investments. 32', '20\\u2003Less than four and a half years after the making of the Will, Mr Yang passed away on 15 May 2012. 33', 'Seven days later, on 22 May 2012, the defendant carried out the following transactions in relation to the joint accounts at UOB and Citibank: 34', '(a)\\u2003he transferred S$247,000 from the UOB joint account to his personal UOB Account No. 208-XXX-XXX-8 35', ';', '(b)\\u2003he transferred S$68,000 from the Citibank joint account to his personal Citibank Account No. 0011XXXX15 36', ';', '(c)\\u2003he prematurely terminated the Citibank time deposit account of S$200,000 which would have otherwise matured on 30 July 2012 and deposited this sum into the Citibank joint account; 37', 'and', '(d)\\u2003 he transferred S$200,000 from the Citibank joint account to his personal Citibank Account No. 0011XXXX15. 38', 'In total, a sum of at least S$515,000 was moved from the joint accounts to the defendant\u2019s personal accounts, which were held with his wife. It is not in dispute that the defendant did not obtain Mdm Sun\u2019s consent to the said withdrawals. In fact, both parties are in agreement that the defendant could not have obtained Mdm Sun\u2019s consent because she lacked mental capacity at the time of Mr Yang\u2019s death. 39', '21\\u2003It is also common ground that the defendant did not inform UOB or Citibank that Mr Yang had passed away when he gave instructions for the above transfers to be carried out. He only informed the respective banks of Mr Yang\u2019s death more than a month later on 6 July 2012 when he needed their assistance to apply for the grant of probate for the Will. 40', 'The grant of probate was applied for on 25 July 2012 and was granted on 25 September 2012. 41', '22\\u2003Following Mr Yang\u2019s death, the defendant assumed primary care of Mdm Sun. He visited her once every one to two weeks to check in on her and pay for the groceries and household expenses. 42', 'Mr Sun and members of the Sun family, who did not live in Singapore, trusted that the defendant would look after Mdm Sun. The defendant had informed them that Mr Yang had left a sum of S$300,000 for Mdm Sun\u2019s care and maintenance. 43', 'On this basis, the Sun family did not raise questions the existing care arrangements for Mdm Sun. The defendant initially refused to show Mr Sun and the Sun family the Will on the basis that they were not beneficiaries. 44', '23\\u2003In July 2012, Mr Sun\u2019s brother visited Singapore. During this visit, the defendant showed him a copy of the Will and also handed over the seal and passbooks for Mdm Sun\u2019s Taiwanese bank accounts. 45', 'He did not share any further information about Mdm Sun\u2019s assets. Mdm Sun\u2019s extended family was thus under the impression that Mdm Sun had no assets in Singapore. Mr Sun only discovered that this was untrue when he directed lawyers to conduct a land register search on the Tomlinson Property. The search revealed that the Tomlinson Property was held as a joint tenancy with Mdm Sun and the defendant. This aroused Mr Sun\u2019s suspicions as to the defendant\u2019s motives and he began to take a more active role in Mdm Sun\u2019s affairs. 46', '24\\u2003As she aged, Mdm Sun had become weaker and less mobile. She had suffered a stroke in early 2002 and eventually lost the ability to walk by August 2009. 47', 'She suffered from a number of other medical conditions, began exhibiting signs of dementia and became increasingly unresponsive. 48', 'When Mr Sun returned to Singapore in August 2012, he was alarmed to discover Mdm Sun in a semi-vegetative state. 49', 'He found that her condition had visibly deteriorated since Mr Yang\u2019s funeral a few months earlier. Whilst the defendant had retained the family\u2019s doctor, Dr Lee Keng Thon (\u201cDr Lee\u201d), to look after Mdm Sun, Mr Sun was concerned that the defendant was not sufficiently addressing his aunt\u2019s medical needs. 50', '25\\u2003He discovered that Mdm Sun was being prescribed medication by Dr Lee without any physical examination. 51', 'Mr Sun was also informed by Mdm Looi of other instances of inadequate care. In September 2012, Mr Sun decided to engage Dr Madeline Chew (\u201cDr Chew\u201d) to treat Mdm Sun. The defendant was strongly opposed to Mdm Sun being treated by Dr Chew because he said that it was unnecessary. Subsequently, however, in Originating Summons No 205 of 2013 (\u201cOS 205\/2013\u201d), which is described below at [30] to [34], Lai Siu Chiu J accepted that Mdm Sun demonstrated considerable improvement under Dr Chew\u2019s care. 52', '26\\u2003After Mdm Sun\u2019s condition improved, on 17 October 2012 and 3 December 2012 respectively, she executed a Power of Attorney (\u201cPOA\u201d) and Lasting Power of Attorney (\u201cLPA\u201d) in favour of Mr Sun. 53', 'Mr Sun was appointed as her sole attorney and\/or donee to conduct, manage and make decisions on her behalf in respect of matters relation to her personal welfare, property and affairs. The defendant was informed of Mr Sun\u2019s appointment as Mdm Sun\u2019s attorney in December 2012.', '27\\u2003Prior to the commencement of these proceedings, parties were involved in several other related legal proceedings. The outcomes of two of these proceedings are somewhat relevant to my judgment and I therefore set them out below.', '28\\u2003On 11 January 2013, the defendant filed Originating Summons Family No 9 of 2013 (\u201cOSF 9\/2013\u201d) seeking an order to set aside the LPA executed in favour of Mr Sun on two grounds. He argued that Mdm Sun lacked capacity at the material time and that Mr Sun was not acting in her best interests. Numerous expert witnesses were called by both parties, particularly to give evidence on the issue of Mdm Sun\u2019s mental capacity. Amongst them were Dr Lee and Dr Chew. Video evidence of Mdm Sun was also considered to assess her ability to understand and respond to questions.', '29\\u2003In those proceedings, the District Judge made several important findings as to Mdm Sun\u2019s mental capacity and the validity of Mr Sun\u2019s LPA (see TEB v TEC [2015] SGFC 54 (\u201cTEB\u201d)) 54', ':', 'Accordingly, the District Judge dismissed the defendant\u2019s application and the LPA was not revoked. The defendant\u2019s appeal against this decision was dismissed by the High Court.', '30\\u2003Following his efforts to improve the medical care of his aunt in the second half of 2012, Mr Sun incurred medical expenses which he sought to recover from the defendant. This was on the basis of his belief that Mr Yang had set aside the sum of S$300,000 in the Will for the care and maintenance of Mdm Sun.', '31\\u2003 Mr Sun\u2019s solicitors initially wrote to the defendant on 10 December 2012 detailing expenses amounting to $9,864.13. 55', 'Mr Sun\u2019s requests for reimbursement were refused. In the meantime, he continued to incur further costs on behalf of Mdm Sun. On 4 March 2013, in his capacity as Mdm Sun\u2019s attorney, Mr Sun commenced OS 205\/2013 against the defendant to claim reimbursement of sums he had incurred in the care and treatment of Mdm Sun out of the S$300,000 that had been set aside by the late Mr Yang. He also sought to enforce Mdm Sun\u2019s right to her share of the Tomlinson Property. The defendant had failed to lodge Mr Yang\u2019s \u201cNotice of Death\u201d with the Singapore Land Authority (\u201cSLA\u201d) to ensure that the land register was updated to reflect Mdm Sun\u2019s and the defendant\u2019s entitlement to the Tomlinson Property as joint tenants. These proceedings were opposed by the defendant on the basis that Mdm Sun was mentally incapacitated and could not have validly authorised Mr Sun to act as her attorney (see OSF 9\/2013).', '32\\u2003On 23 July 2013, Lai Siu Chiu J made, inter alia, the following interim orders (see Mrs Yang Chun nee Sun Hui Min v Yang Chia Yin [2014] 1 SLR 1 (\u201cMrs Yang Chun\u201d) at [3]) 56', ':', '(a)\\u2003the defendant was to pay Mdm Sun\u2019s solicitors S$100,000 to defray her future medical expenses and reimburse Mr Sun the sum of S$52,202.53 that had already been incurred by him by the time of the hearing; and', '(b)\\u2003the defendant was to lodge with the SLA the instrument of transmission upon death to transfer Mr Yang\u2019s share in the Tomlinson Property to himself and Mdm Sun as joint tenants.', '33\\u2003In so doing, Lai J made several findings which are of note for these proceedings. She found that Dr Lee had abrogated his duties as a medical doctor by taking instructions from the defendant on Mdm Sun\u2019s care (Mrs Yang Chun at [30]). This view was shared by the District Judge in TEB who expressed concerns that Dr Lee had written prescriptions for Mdm Sun without even seeing her (at [105] and [108]). Lai J also found that Mdm Sun\u2019s condition showed a marked improvement as a result of the treatment of Dr Chew. Mr Sun was not motivated by self-interest in arranging for Mdm Sun\u2019s medical treatment (Mrs Yang Chun at [32]). In contrast, the defendant had failed to discharge his duties as executor of Mr Yang\u2019s estate. The Will \u201cdid not confer on the defendant a carte blanche to care for [Mdm Sun] as he deemed fit\u201d (Mrs Yang Chun at [33]). Lastly, Lai J found that more appropriate steps could have and should have been taken to improve Mdm Sun\u2019s physical and mental well-being (Mrs Yang Chun at [34]).', '34\\u2003Lai J\u2019s interim order was varied by Judith Prakash J, as she then was, on 23 October 2013, limiting Mr Sun to claim S$5,000 per month on a reimbursement basis up to the amount of S$100,000, which was to be held by the defendant\u2019s solicitors. The sum of S$52,202.53 that was ordered by Lai J to be paid as reimbursement to Mr Sun was never paid by the defendant, as Prakash J stayed the order, pending the defendant\u2019s appeal against Lai J\u2019s order.', '35\\u2003Mdm Sun\u2019s medical expenses subsequently exceeded this sum. Mr Sun claimed the full sum of S$100,000 and incurred a further S$222,356.63. 57', 'Once again, the defendant refused to reimburse him for these costs. The defendant was also reticent about providing an account of how he had allegedly incurred an amount of about S$200,000 for the care and maintenance of Mdm Sun. 58', '36\\u2003In August 2016, after repeated requests, the defendant furnished Mr Sun with a copy of his personal handwritten records in Chinese detailing his expenditure for Mdm Sun\u2019s care and maintenance. 59', 'No supporting receipts and invoices were provided until discovery of these was given in the present proceedings. 60', '37\\u2003Also, at around that time, Mr Sun obtained a copy of the Schedule of Assets filed by the defendant when he obtained probate for Mr Yang\u2019s estate. 61', 'The Schedule of Assets listed the various joint accounts with UOB, Citibank and POSB as Mr Yang\u2019s assets, describing simply as \u201cJoint A\/c\u201d without mention as to who the joint account holder was. 62', 'This was how Mr Sun came to be aware of the existence of the joint accounts. He subsequently came to know that these accounts had been held jointly with Mdm Sun. 63', '38\\u2003Mdm Sun passed away on October 2016. In April 2017, the defendant\u2019s appeal against Lai J\u2019s order was withdrawn and OS 205\/2013 was discontinued. I pause to observe that, during the course of those proceedings, and in OSF 9\/2013, the defendant represented that the moneys which he had expended for Mdm Sun\u2019s care had been from the sum of S$300,000 set aside by Mr Yang for Mdm Sun\u2019s benefit. 64', 'Hence, the orders by the Court, as described above, all proceeded on the basis that there was a separate sum of S$300,000 which Mr Yang had provided from his own funds and for which the defendant was responsible for administering to take care of Mdm Sun. There was no disclosure of the fact that the S$300,000 in the hands of the defendant in fact came from the joint accounts at UOB and Citibank, which were held in the names of Mr Yang and Mdm Sun.'"}
{"casename":"2019_SGHC_153","fact":"The background facts were largely undisputed and an Agreed Statement \nof Facts was tendered. The appellant had tested positive for HIV infection on 8 \nNovember 2011. On 9 December 2011, the appellant was interviewed by Ms \nLee Pei Ying Fiona (\u201cMs Lee\u201d), a Public Health Officer working at the National \nPublic Health Unit. Both Ms Lee and the appellant testified that Ms Lee had \ntold him that he had to inform his partners of his HIV status and obtain their \nconsent if he wanted to engage in any sexual activity.\n4 The appellant engaged in penile-oral and penile-anal intercourse with \nthe victim on five to six occasions at the appellant\u2019s residence. The victim was \nthe receptive party in their sexual encounters, which occurred after the appellant \nhad learnt he was HIV-positive. \n5 The victim testified that none of his sexual partners, including the \nappellant, had informed him that they were HIV-positive, or that there was a \nrisk of contracting HIV through sexual activities with them. He stated that if he \nhad been informed that the appellant was HIV-positive, he would not have \nengaged in sexual activity with him. According to the victim, the appellant had \nonly told him he was waiting for results from \u201csome HIV test\u201d towards the \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nGCP v PP[2019] SGHC 153\n3middle of the period where they had sexual relations. However, the victim only \nlearnt that the appellant was HIV-positive when he was informed of this by the \nInvestigating Officer (\u201cIO\u201d). \n6 While the victim testified that there were occasions after their first few \nsexual encounters where the appellant had not used a condom, the appellant \nmaintained at trial that he had always used a condom for penile-anal intercourse. \nThe appellant further testified that he had informed the victim that he was HIV-\npositive on Grindr, an online communication application, and that he was on \nmedication known as \u201cPrEP\u201d (an acronym for pre-exposure prophylaxis) before \ntheir first liaison. The appellant then checked for sores and took twice his usual \ndose of medication before giving the victim his address. Thereafter, when the \nvictim reached the appellant\u2019s home, the appellant asked the victim to place his \nthings on the table where the appellant\u2019s anti-viral medication was. The \nappellant then ensured that the victim had read his messages and knew that he \nwas HIV-positive before they engaged in sexual intercourse. Finally, the \nappellant told the victim that he was waiting for HIV test results but that he was \nstill undetectable at the time. \nDecision below\n7 The District Judge held that s 23(1) IDA imposes a positive duty on the \nappellant to unequivocally communicate to the victim his HIV status prior to \nengaging in sexual activity. However, merely disclosing one\u2019s HIV-positive \nstatus is not sufficient: instead, there is a duty to ensure that the other party \nunderstands and appreciates the risk that HIV is transmissible through sexual \nintercourse. The statutory objective of s 23(1) would be undermined if a person \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nGCP v PP[2019] SGHC 153\n4discloses his HIV status only to downplay the risk by assuring his partner there \nis little or no risk of contracting HIV from him: GD at [36] and [37].\n8 In any event, the District Judge found that the appellant did not inform \nthe victim of his HIV status. There was no reason for the victim to lie, and his \nevidence was consistent with what he had told both Ms Lee and the IO: GD at \n[38], [40] and [54] to [58]. While there was no requirement for the victim\u2019s \nevidence to be \u201cunusually convincing\u201d, it was nevertheless \u201cabsolutely \ncredible\u201d and \u201cextremely convincing\u201d. The mere fact that the victim had said he \ncould not recall the appellant telling him a number of things which would have \nsuggested to him that the latter was HIV-positive did not mean he was agreeing \nto the possibility that these things were in fact said. The victim\u2019s unequivocal \ntestimony was that the appellant had not informed him of his HIV-positive \nstatus and the risk of infection. As such, nothing in the victim\u2019s testimony \nundermined the reliability of his evidence: GD at [59] to [62].\n9 While the victim testified that the appellant had told him that he (the \nappellant) was waiting for test results \u201cfor some HIV test\u201d, this was insufficient. \nIn any event, the victim had only been told of this after they had engaged in \nsexual activity a few times. While the appellant claimed that he told the victim \nthat the test was to determine his precise viral load, the victim\u2019s \u201cclear \nimpression\u201d was that the appellant had yet to be diagnosed with HIV infection. \nThe District Judge accepted the victim\u2019s account and found that the appellant \nhad in fact concealed his HIV-positive status from the victim: GD at [42] and \n[43]. \n10 The appellant\u2019s case was that the victim might have been distracted \nwhen the appellant informed him of his HIV status, or that the victim might \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nGCP v PP[2019] SGHC 153\n5have forgotten that this had happened. The District Judge did not accept these \narguments. If the appellant had confirmed with the victim that the latter \nunderstood he had HIV, as he testified he had done, any suggestion that the \nvictim may have been distracted was untenable. Further, the victim\u2019s testimony \nwas that he would not have engaged in sex with the appellant if he knew that \nthe latter was HIV-positive. While the victim may not have been able to recall \nthe minute details of their online conversation prior to meeting up, the fact that \nhe had agreed to sexual activity with the appellant meant that he had not been \ninformed of the appellant\u2019s HIV status, particularly since the two eventually had \nunprotected sex: GD at [44] to [47] and [50]. \n11 On the other hand, the appellant\u2019s evidence was found to be unreliable, \nexaggerated and contrived. He had vacillated in his accounts of what he had told \nthe victim. There was a stark contrast between his statement to the IO of a \ngeneral recollection that he did inform the victim, and his evidence in court of \nthe many times he discussed and impressed upon the victim his HIV status. The \nDistrict Judge also doubted the appellant\u2019s evidence that he was careful and \nmeticulous when it came to obtaining the prior consent of his sexual partners \nand that he had taken precautions to ensure he did not infect them. The appellant \ndid not inform the IO of the detailed steps he had taken to communicate his HIV \nstatus to the victim. Instead, he told the IO that he was uncertain if he had \ninformed the victim and added tentatively that he could have done so. Moreover, \nthe appellant went on to have unprotected and uninhibited penile-anal and \npenile-oral sex: GD at [63] to [70]. The evidence of his former partners did not \nfurther his defence: GD at [69] and [77] to [81].\n12 Even if the appellant had informed the victim of his HIV status, this \ndisclosure would not have been sufficiently clear and unambiguous as to amount \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nGCP v PP[2019] SGHC 153\n6to a discharge of his statutory duty to communicate the risk of contracting HIV \nfrom him to the victim. Any communication would also have been nullified by \nthe appellant\u2019s own qualification that his viral load was \u201cundetectable\u201d. The \nvictim would not have appreciated the risk of contracting HIV given that the \nappellant had downplayed the seriousness of his condition: GD at [75]. \n13 Finally, the District Judge rejected the defence of mistake of fact. The \nissue of mistake of fact did not arise. Instead, the irresistible inference from the \nappellant\u2019s failure to inform the victim of his HIV status when he had been \ncounselled by Ms Lee to do so was that the appellant intentionally hid the fact \nof his HIV infection from the victim: GD at [76]. \n14 The District Judge therefore found that the appellant had not informed \nthe victim of his HIV status, and that the victim did not agree to accept the risk \nof contracting HIV from the appellant. Accordingly, he convicted the appellant: \nGD at [82] and [83].\n15 The District Judge imposed a sentence of 24 months\u2019 imprisonment as \nsought by the respondent. In doing so, the District Judge considered that the \nprimary sentencing consideration was deterrence, in particular, general \ndeterrence. He held that the sentencing norm for the s 23(1) offence must be a \nsignificant custodial term, both because of the serious potential consequences \nand the high culpability of what he described as a \u201cbaseline offender\u201d. The \nprecedents showed that the usual sentence for an offence under s 23(1) IDA \nwhere the offender had pleaded guilty and there were no exceptional or unusual \nmitigating or aggravating factors was around 18 months\u2019 imprisonment: GD at \n[88] to [94]. \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nGCP v PP[2019] SGHC 153\n716 The District Judge accepted the sentencing framework proposed by the \nrespondent. He observed that the indicative sentence of up to two years\u2019 \nimprisonment within the lowest band for low risk and low culpability was \nconsonant with the precedents cited: GD at [98] and [99].\nBand Sentencing Range Factors\n3 Six to ten years\u2019 \nimprisonmentActual transmission of HIV.\nAny culpability-increasing \nfactors would increase the \nstarting point within this band.\n2 Two to six years\u2019 \nimprisonmentHigh risk of transmission and\/or \ngreater culpability.\nThe more culpability-increasing \nfactors there are, the higher the \nstarting point within this band \nwould be. \n1 Short custodial \nterm to two years\u2019 \nimprisonmentLow risk of transmission and \nlow culpability (generally, less \nthan 2 culpability-increasing \nfactors, or more culpability-\nincreasing factors present but to \nlimited degree).\n17 The District Judge identified a list of non-exhaustive culpability-\nincreasing factors at [100] of his GD. He assessed the appellant to be between \nBands 1 and 2, and the appropriate starting point to be 24 months\u2019 \nimprisonment. The District Judge identified at least two offence-specific \naggravating factors. First, the appellant had engaged in multiple sexual acts with \nthe victim over a period of at least two years, involving unprotected penile-oral \nand penile-anal intercourse. Second, the appellant misinformed the victim that \nhe was waiting for HIV test results. On the risk of transmission, the appellant \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nGCP v PP[2019] SGHC 153\n8had engaged in sexual activities with the victim on five to six occasions. The \nfact that the appellant\u2019s viral load was gradually suppressed only from February \n2013 meant that the risk of transmission was high prior to this time. This was \nrelevant since the appellant admitted in his statement that he had met the victim \nbetween late 2012 and early 2013: GD at [101]. \n18 The appellant submitted in mitigation that he had taken precautionary \nmeasures to minimise the risk of transmission. The District Judge gave this \nsuggestion little or no weight. Any measures the appellant had taken would have \nbeen more than negated by the fact that he engaged in unprotected sexual \nactivity with the victim on multiple occasions. Even if it were accepted that the \nappellant\u2019s viral load was low in 2013, the fact that it tested high on 1 August \n2012 suggested that he either had not been taking his anti-viral medication \naround this time, or that it had no effect on his viral load. Further, while the \nappellant submitted that his viral load was generally low during the material \nperiod, no evidence had been led as to the significance of his viral load to the \nrisk of transmission of HIV: GD at [103] and [107]. \n19 The District Judge therefore sentenced the appellant to 24 months\u2019 \nimprisonment: GD at [108]."}

I summarise them here.', '5\\u2003Gold Insignia was a limited liability partnership which offered debentures, being a form of securities, without a prospectus to the investing public. The debentures were structured as \u201cmemberships\u201d. In the course of its business, there were three versions of the memberships, with the following key terms:', '(a)\\u2003On purchase of a membership, an investor received a physical gold bar, worth about 70% of the membership fees. The gold bar remained the property of Gold Insignia, but the investor was to hold it on trust for Gold Insignia as collateral to secure his paid-up membership fees and the fixed pay-outs from Gold Insignia.', '(b)\\u2003The investor was to be given fixed pay-outs. The pay-out was fixed at 4.5% per quarter (18% per annum) under the first two versions of the membership, and 6% on a bi-annual basis (12% per annum) for the third version of the membership.', '(c)\\u2003Each investor could terminate his membership by giving one month\u2019s notice after a fixed non-terminable period. Upon termination, each investor was to return the gold bar to Gold Insignia, and the investor was entitled to a full refund of the original membership fee, or the prevailing market value of the membership, whichever was higher.', '(d)\\u2003If investors received a call-back notice from Gold Insignia, investors had two options \u2013 return the gold collateral to Gold Insignia and receive the prevailing market value of his membership, or sell the gold collateral to a third party.', '6\\u2003In other words, of the funds obtained from the investors, around 70% of the funds were held by the investors in the form of gold bar collaterals. As for the remaining 30% of the funds, around $200,000 was invested by Gold Insignia\u2019s management committee, with the returns from the investments belonging to the partners of Gold Insignia. All the other monies were held by third party discretionary fund managers and brokerage firms for investment, without any input from Gold Insignia. The returns from these investments covered part of the operational costs of Gold Insignia, including the fixed pay-outs to the investors.', '7\\u2003There were about 135 independent sales consultants who marketed and sold Gold Insignia\u2019s memberships. These sales consultants were paid a commission for every month a client, to whom they sold a membership, stayed in the programme. The commission was 1.3% of the price of the membership per client per month.', '8\\u2003Between June 2010 and November 2011, Gold Insignia sold a total of 853 memberships to 547 investors. The memberships were sold for prices between $5,000 to $1,000,000. During this period, $29,970,000 was raised by Gold Insignia from the sales of the memberships.', '9\\u2003Each time Gold Insignia offered its membership to an investor without an accompanying prospectus or profile statement that complied with the requirements prescribed under s 240(4A) and s 243 of the SFA, it contravened s 240(1) SFA, punishable under s 240(7) of the SFA.', '10\\u2003The business concept of Gold Insignia was conceived of by the Accused. Although he was not registered as a partner of Gold Insignia, he was the senior-most member of the management team of Gold Insignia, and had the final say in its management. In 2010, the Accused was a consultant and advisor to Gold Insignia, and was responsible for advising Gold Insignia on investing the moneys raised from the sales of the memberships. From February 2011 onwards, the Accused was the acting CEO of Gold Insignia. He was also the head of Gold Insignia\u2019s in-house trading team, after it was set up in January 2011. He was paid a monthly salary of $20,000 from October 2010 to August 2011, and a \u201cPartial Consultant fees\u201d of a total of $211,000 in 2011.', '11\\u2003The Accused was also experienced in the financial industry, and was the sole proprietor of an entity known as Private Capital Fund Management (\u201cPCFM\u201d) which was in the business of fund management.

They were also charged for their roles in Gold Insignia\u2019s scheme.', '13\\u2003Jacinta was one of two registered partners of Gold Insignia from 23 June 2010. After the Accused, Jacinta was the next-most senior figure in the Gold Insignia management team. Jacinta was deregistered as a partner sometime in July 2011 (backdated to January 2011). However, Jacinta remained on the management team of Gold Insignia, and was involved in its decision-making.', '14\\u2003Serene was the second registered partner of Gold Insignia. In actual fact, she was a salaried employee, earning about $3,000 per month. She took instructions from the Accused, and was assigned administrative and operational tasks.', '15\\u2003Ray joined Gold Insignia sometime in end-2010. He was the business marketing manager of Gold Insignia. From July 2011, Ray was also added to the management team of Gold Insignia. He was paid a salary of about $3,000 per month.', '16\\u2003The charges against the Accused related to the offences committed by Gold Insignia with the consent of the Accused, as a manager of Gold Insignia at the material time. They involved a total of 12 investors and $585,000 invested, as follows:', '17\\u2003In addition to the 20 proceeded charges, there were 49 similar charges taken into consideration. These 49 charges involved offering Gold Insignia memberships to 25 different investors, but the sums involved are not stated in the charges or the SOF.', '18\\u2003For completeness, there were several facts which were raised in the Accused\u2019s mitigation plea as follows:', '(a)\\u2003Gold Insignia had made verbal enquiries with several authorities, namely the MAS, International Enterprise Singapore, the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority and the Singapore Police Force about the running of Gold Insignia\u2019s business. 1', 'Exhibits of follow-up emails of these enquiries showed that the authorities gave confirmations to the effect that limited liability partnerships could run membership programmes. 2', '(b)\\u2003The Gold Insignia membership application form had included the applicable terms and conditions.

{"casename":"2019_SGHC_158","fact":"'2\\u2003Viking Engineering and Mr Feen are joint venture partners in the third defendant, Viking Inert Gas Pte Ltd (\u201cViking Inert Gas\u201d). This action arose out of a sale and purchase agreement dated 10 September 2013 between parties in relation to Viking Inert Gas. By this agreement, Viking Engineering, at that time a 51% shareholder, sold 21% of its shareholding to Mr Feen, thereby giving Mr Feen a 70% shareholding in Viking Inert Gas. Mr Feen was obliged with various undertakings in return, including a change of the corporate name of Viking Inert Gas to Feen Marine Pte Ltd, the name of the second defendant (\u201cFeen Marine\u201d). Mr Feen is the sole director of Feen Marine, the fourth defendant, Scanjet Feen IGS Pte Ltd (\u201cScanjet Feen\u201d), and the fifth defendant, Feen Marine Scrubbers Pte Ltd. All the companies in question are Singapore-incorporated companies.', '3\\u2003On 4 April 2017, Viking Engineering commenced High Court Suit No 294 of 2017, as minority shareholders of Viking Inert Gas, for minority oppression. Its claim included contentions that in breach of the sale and purchase agreement, Mr Feen transferred his shareholding in Viking Inert Gas to Feen Marine. Further, not only did Mr Feen fail to change the name of Viking Inert Gas to Feen Marine as the sale and purchase agreement required, he instead incorporated a company of the same name. Thereafter the business and corporate opportunities of Viking Inert Gas were said to have been diverted to Feen Marine and Scanjet Feen IGS.', '4\\u2003Viking Engineering then followed on with a summons seeking summary judgment. Leave was given to amend its prayers to include a buy-out of Viking Engineering\u2019s shares in Viking Inert Gas by Mr Feen on 24 November 2017. After considering the augmented arguments on 14 February 2018, I granted an injunction to restrain Mr Feen and his agents from using the name \u201cViking\u201d in any manner which may compete with the business of Viking Engineering or be associated with or perceived to be associated with Viking Engineering or the business of Viking Engineering. I also ordered Mr Feen to purchase Viking Engineering\u2019s entire shareholding in Viking Inert Gas, with an independent valuer being appointed by agreement within 14 days of final judgment to ascertain the fair value of the shares. Unconditional leave was given on the remainder of the claims, which were contractual and could conveniently be tried together with the counterclaim. Counsel asked for time to submit on whether a discount ought to be applied by the valuer to Viking Engineering\u2019s minority holding. At the same time, during the course of proceedings, after Viking Engineering contended that there was evidence of diversion of business opportunities from Viking Inert Gas also to Feen Marine Scrubbers, the latter was added by consent as the fifth defendant. On 9 April 2018, after hearing parties on the question of whether a discount for Viking Engineering\u2019s minority shareholding should apply, I held that no discount should be applied. The valuer was also asked, as part of his valuation, to make various adjustments for Mr Feen\u2019s conduct and the diversion of opportunities to Feen Marine, Scanjet Feen IGS and Feen Marine Scrubbers. On the same date, in the course of finalising the form of the final orders, parties agreed that the cost of the valuation exercise would be borne by Mr Feen.', '5\\u2003Subsequently, on 13 June 2018, FTI Consulting (Singapore) Pte Ltd (\u201cFTI\u201d) was jointly appointed by parties as the independent valuer, with the terms of FTI\u2019s appointment reflecting that the first defendant was to bear the costs of the valuation exercise. FTI\u2019s letter of engagement stipulated the scale of professional fees and hourly rates applicable, and estimated that their overall fee would be between $80,000 and $90,000. 1', '6\\u2003The timeline for the process was set out in an email dated 22 June 2018 from Mr Richard Hayler of FTI to parties\u2019 solicitors, setting out a timeframe of 6 weeks, with an additional three weeks for the production of the report, from 9 July to 10 September 2018. The documents were not delivered by Mr Feen in accordance with the prescribed time period, however. After various reminders, Mr Hayler wrote to Mr Feen to confirm that the documents would be received no later than 9 July, as he was required to allocate staff to the exercise. He also warned that under his terms of appointment, he was to commence work based on submissions received and any delay would increase costs. Further delay followed notwithstanding. As Mr Feen failed to send various documents, including audited statements, FTI also did detailed investigative and research work to complete their valuation. On 2 November 2018, parties were informed by email that FTI had completed its determination and an invoice would follow. 2', '7\\u2003On 12 November 2018, FTI issued its invoice to Mr Feen\u2019s solicitors, Xavier & Associates LLC (\u201cXA\u201d), for a sum of $181,900. FTI\u2019s letter explained that the significant cost overrun was \u201calmost entirely attributable\u201d to Mr Feen, who either failed to provide the requested documents or, where documents were provided, did so out of time. SGD250,956.75 was the fee resulting from the total time and manpower incurred. In the light of FTI\u2019s original estimate, however, the final sum carried a discount. 3', '8\\u2003In accordance with FTI\u2019s letter of engagement, this sum was due within 14 days of the invoice date, being 26 November 2018, and its valuation report would only be released to the parties upon payment in full of its outstanding fees, disbursements and expenses.', '9\\u2003Following FTI\u2019s invoice, Viking Engineering sent an email and a letter to Mr Feen\u2019s solicitors, XA, on 23 November 2018 and 4 December 2018 to seek confirmation that the invoice would be paid. 4', 'No response was received nor was the invoice paid. FTI has not released its valuation report to parties.', '10\\u2003On 7 December 2018, Viking Engineering took out the present application against Mr Feen for the invoice to be paid within 7 days of a court order.'"}

By way of another example, the three margin call letters which will be discussed later were also addressed to Zillion and not to Fields. However, since the parties chose to advance their cases as described, I will proceed on the basis that the arguments advanced by the Plaintiffs and by DB respectively applied to the Plaintiffs and the Accounts without distinction.

It would appear that DB did not think of Pan\u2019s investment objective as being to preserve his wealth and to protect it from depreciation.', '22\\u2003On the other hand, the Plaintiffs highlighted a telephone conversation held on 6 December 2010 at or around 1pm primarily between Pan and Juan to support the Plaintiffs\u2019 submission that Pan\u2019s investment objective was simply to preserve his wealth. 44', 'It was recorded in the English translation of the transcript for this conversation that Juan replied \u201cYes\u201d to a series of Pan\u2019s statements where he said: \u201cWhat I want is not about the profit\u201d, \u201cMy main aim is not to shrink my asset\u201d and \u201cHow not to decrease the value, it\u2019s my biggest wish\u201d. 45', 'It does not appear to me that Juan was affirming these statements that Pan made, but rather that she was just noting that he was making these statements. In any case, this conversation took place in December 2010, more than two years after the time the Plaintiffs pleaded that DB allegedly closed out certain positions under the Accounts in breach of contract on 31 October 2008 (see [70(d)] below). I thus place little weight on this conversation of 6 December 2010 in understanding what Pan\u2019s objective was in relation to the Accounts at the material time.', '23\\u2003I make some observations on Pan as an investor.', '24\\u2003I find that Pan was evasive during cross-examination when answering questions from DB\u2019s counsel on the transactions the Plaintiffs entered into under the Accounts. This was so even when Pan was specifically referred to transcripts for telephone conversations between him and DB, and was asked questions on the contents of these transcripts. 46', 'I find that Pan was trying to portray himself as an investor who was fully dependent on DB\u2019s advice as to which transactions to enter into under the Accounts when in fact this was not the case.', '25\\u2003I find that Pan had a mind of his own as to which transactions to enter into. From the English translations of the transcripts for various telephone conversations, it can be seen that Pan was not a passive listener who simply accepted DB\u2019s suggestions and advice, but was very much involved during the telephone discussions on which transactions to enter into. 47', 'He requested\/directed DB to obtain certain specific information for him to make his investment decisions. For instance, one of Pan\u2019s directions was for DB to produce an analysis report in English on three telecommunication companies, and to have the report translated into Chinese. 48', 'Pan also said to hand him the original English version for him to \u201ctake a look\u201d and that he would \u201cfind a telecommunications expert\u201d with whom he would discuss the telecommunication companies.', '26\\u2003As early as in May 2007 (at least from Pan\u2019s communications with DB), Pan was familiar with the operations of the various financial products he considered purchasing, like accumulators, and he was able to have discussions with DB\u2019s employees to assess whether to purchase them. 49', 'I do not accept the Plaintiffs\u2019 allegation that he did not understand the risks associated with accumulators and at [147] below, I elaborate on this point. At present, I mention briefly that even though the Plaintiffs suffered losses on accumulators, they continued to purchase accumulators even after 13 October 2008 when some positions of the Plaintiffs under the Accounts were closed out by DB, although they said that the value of these transactions was much less than those previously entered into. 50', 'Pan also made decisions on the type, size and specification of the transactions he wanted to enter into. 51', 'These financial products were relatively complex in their operations (see [48]\u2013[49] below for a description of accumulators).', '27\\u2003Pan also had some investment practices which appeared not to have the objective of simply preserving his wealth and protecting it from depreciation. For instance, Pan was willing to trade more in a company\u2019s stock even though its price was falling. 52', 'Pan was also unwilling to enter into a transaction where he could \u201cearn money now, but [where he] would be cutting down [his] profits to 6% or so\u201d, as he said to DB\u2019s employees during a telephone conversation. 53', '28\\u2003In the circumstances, although the Plaintiffs sought to show that Pan did act on the recommendation of DB at times, this did not detract from the fact that he had his own mind and that it was he who finally decided what transactions to enter into and the terms thereof. I also find that Pan\u2019s investment objective was not to preserve his wealth and protect it from depreciation, but rather to grow his wealth by taking risks. Pan was an experienced investor who understood the financial products he purchased, and he chose to purchase numerous accumulators despite their complexity and risk of capital loss (see [49] below). He was aggressive in that he was prepared to take high risks for high returns. I reach these conclusions even without having to have regard to the CAPRs or the Questionnaire.', '29\\u2003I also make some observations on Chang.', '30\\u2003DB\u2019s case was that Chang was the main gatekeeper for the Accounts, ie, the key person for the Plaintiffs with whom DB would often communicate on transactions to be entered into, like in relation to information on prices, and Chang would in turn update Pan accordingly. 54', '31\\u2003On the other hand, the Plaintiffs took the position that Chang\u2019s role was initially only to safe-keep and apply one of two corporate seals of a company known as AOC International (presumably owned by Pan). 55', 'As a colleague of hers had a serious illness, Chang also joined the colleague and Pan in meetings and telephone discussions with banks. 56', 'Chang\u2019s role was to record the transactions which Pan entered into during the meetings and discussions. Gradually, she also started to arrange these meetings and discussions. However, Chang deposed in her AEIC that her main role was still to safe-keep and apply one of two corporate seals of AOC International. 57', 'The Plaintiffs also appeared to take the position that Pan and Chang were not even aware that Chang was treated by DB as Pan\u2019s gatekeeper. 58', 'Chang deposed in her AEIC that she did not have any financial investment qualifications and knew little about financial investments, 59', 'and she disagreed during cross-examination that she would discuss the terms of proposed investments before they were put to Pan. 60', 'Chang also deposed that she was not proficient in English and could not read, speak or understand English save for simple words. 61', '32\\u2003I find that Chang was hardly ignorant about the transactions the Plaintiffs entered into under the Accounts, despite her evidence to the contrary. In a telephone conversation held on 2 June 2008 at or around 2.49pm between Chang, Juan and Kwok, it began with Juan informing Kwok that \u201c[Chang] wants to talk to us about how she calculates the [foreign exchange]\u201d. 62', 'Chang then started talking about her calculations. I will set out the conversation later at [103] below.', '33\\u2003When cross-examined on this telephone conversation, Chang denied that she was doing any calculations in relation to the Accounts on behalf of Pan, or that she wanted to check DB\u2019s calculations. 63', 'She instead testified that Pan did not know she was doing these calculations. 64', 'During re-examination, Chang explained that she did these calculations for her own knowledge because she \u201cwould like to know in [her] mind\u201d. 65', 'I find her evidence in respect of this telephone conversation hard to believe.', '34\\u2003There were numerous telephone conversations between Chang and DB\u2019s employees, of which Pan was not a part. 66', 'DB relied on Chang to convey information to Pan, and discussed proposed investments with her before they were put to Pan. 67', '35\\u2003I do not accept Pan\u2019s evidence that Chang discussed proposed investments with DB without his knowledge and consent. Pan\u2019s evidence in his AEIC and during cross-examination was that in April 2008, he scolded Chang for conveying DB\u2019s advice on accumulators to him instead of telling DB to advise him directly, and told Juan to explain proposed investments to him directly and not by way of passing messages through Chang. 68', 'However, in a telephone conversation held on 24 July 2008, Pan himself instructed DB, \u201cGo and talk to [Chang] about [the transaction] and we will do this.\u201d 69', 'The fact that Pan would have separate discussions with Chang as to which transactions to enter into was evidenced in a telephone conversation where Pan told Juan, \u201c[Chang] has given me ample \u2018brainwashing\u2019.\u201d 70', 'In Chang\u2019s telephone conversations with DB\u2019s employees without Pan, Chang would also convey Pan\u2019s responses in respect of the Accounts and the transactions thereunder. In fact, Chang would even tell DB\u2019s employees how they should focus their conversations with Pan. 71', '36\\u2003In the circumstances, I find that Chang was the main gatekeeper for the Accounts, where DB would often communicate information pertaining to the Accounts to her and discuss proposed investments with her, for her to update Pan. She was familiar with the transactions entered into under the Accounts, and Pan also relied on her as he made decisions under the Accounts.', '37\\u2003The remaining facts set out will focus on key dates and\/or events relevant to the dispute between the parties in relation to the four main heads of claim.', '38\\u2003From 30 July 2008 to 1 August 2008, DB hosted Pan, Chang and Chen on a three-day all-expenses-paid trip to Hong Kong. 72', '39\\u2003The Plaintiffs pleaded that on 30 July 2008, Juan told Pan when he was checking in at the hotel, that DB had helped the Plaintiffs earn a profit of US$50m. 73', '40\\u2003On 31 July 2008, DB had a meeting with Pan at the office of DB HK (\u201c31 July 2008 Meeting\u201d).

If instead the spot price for AUD rose above the higher strike price, the buyer of the Trumpet could exercise the call option, and the investor would have to sell a certain amount of AUD to him at the higher strike price.

This was done on the same day (GD at [7]\u2013[8]).', '9\\u2003On the following day, Dr Lim informed the patient of the results of the scan and offered her two treatment options (GD at [8]):', '(a)\\u2003bracing and oral medication; or', '(b)\\u2003an injection of 10mg of triamcinolone acetonide with 1% lignocaine in a total volume of 2ml (\u201cH&L Injection\u201d) coupled with bracing and oral medication.', '10\\u2003The only material difference between these two options appears to be the H&L Injection, which was part of the second option but not the first. The patient chose the latter option and Dr Lim administered the H&L Injection to her left wrist in the region of the Triangular Fibrocartilage Complex and Extensor Carpi Ulnaris (\u201cthe Injected Area\u201d). The agreed statement of facts records that before administering the H&L Injection, Dr Lim did not advise the patient of the following matters (referred to at [9] of the GD as \u201cthe risks and possible complications that could arise from the H&L Injection\u201d):', '(a)\\u2003post-injection flare, in particular, that:', '(b)\\u2003the post-injection flare could be treated by rest, intermittent cold packs and analgesics;', '(c)\\u2003change in skin colour including depigmentation (loss of colour), hypopigmentation (lightening) and hyperpigmentation (darkening);', '(d)\\u2003skin atrophy (thinning);', '(e)\\u2003subcutaneous fat atrophy;', '(f)\\u2003local infection; and', '(g)\\u2003tendon rupture.', '11\\u2003As it transpired, some of these risks and complications did manifest. The patient experienced swelling and pain in the Injected Area about two hours after the H&L Injection. Subsequently, she developed \u201cpaper-thin skin with discolo[u]ration, loss of fat and muscle tissues\u201d [emphasis in original omitted] in the Injected Area (GD at [10]).', '12\\u2003By way of a statutory declaration dated 11 January 2016, the patient filed a complaint against Dr Lim regarding his alleged failure to advise her on the possible complications arising from the H&L Injection.'"}

{"casename":"2019_SGHC_183","fact":"facts are as follows.\n3 Pradeepto and one Simon John Hopkins (\u201cHopkins\u201d) discussed the \nformation of EICM and its wealth and fund management business. The \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPradeepto Kumar Biswas v[2019] SGHC 183\nEast India Capital Management Pte Ltd\n2discussions started in July 2015 and ran through to August. On 25 August 2015 \nHopkins sent an email to Gary Thornton, the finance manager of EICM, who \nsubsequently wrote to Pradeepto on 21 October 2015, where it was agreed that \nPradeepto would be paid a \u201cnotional\u201d monthly salary of $20,000 when EICM \nbecame profitable. A shareholders\u2019 agreement was signed on 17 August 2015 \nby Hopkins and other shareholders. Pradeepto commenced work with EICM on \n15 October 2015.\n4 IOG purchased 24% shares in EICM from Hopkins on 12 November \n2015 on terms that it would be bound by the shareholders\u2019 agreement. Pradeepto \nsubsequently agreed in April 2017 to have his salary reduced to $10,000 to ease \nEICM\u2019s cash flow problems.\n5 On 18 June 2017, EICM terminated Pradeepto\u2019s engagement with the \ncompany on the ground of misconduct involving Mulgeo Product India Pty Ltd \n(\u201cMulgeo\u201d) which was a client of EICM. Pradeepto commenced this action in \nSuit 705 of 2017 against EICM for unpaid salary amounting to $351,312.64. \nEICM counterclaimed against Pradeepto for misrepresentation and breach of \nfiduciary duties.\n6 In the counterclaim, EICM alleges that Pradeepto falsely represented \nthat he would transfer US$100m of assets that he was managing under Deer \nCreek Pte Ltd (\u201cDeer Creek\u201d) to EICM; and secondly, that he was earning an \nannual income of S$450,000 as the managing director of Deer Creek.\n7 EICM\u2019s claim against Pradeepto for breach of fiduciary duty arose from \nan alleged misuse of confidential information belonging to EICM, and the \nwrongful diversion of business from EICM to Pradeepto himself and his \ncompanies.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPradeepto Kumar Biswas v[2019] SGHC 183\nEast India Capital Management Pte Ltd\n38 Mr Kelvin Lee, instructed counsel for Pradeepto, submitted that there \nwas no written employment contract and Pradeepto was not concerned with the \nmanagement of EICM. His only job was to introduce potential clients to EICM. \nHe submitted that although Pradeepto was referred to as a \u201cpartner\u201d, it was only \na term of designation and Pradeepto was not truly a partner, and that the fact \nthat he had no access to the company\u2019s accounts supported this. He submitted \nthat EICM\u2019s accounts for the year ending 31 March 2017 shows that EICM had \nmade a profit, and Pradeepto was therefore entitled to the accrued salary \nclaimed.\n9 Mr Anand, counsel for EICM, submitted that Pradeepto referred to \nhimself as \u201cpartner\u201d, as can be seen in the email correspondence. Further \nevidence can be seen in the WhatsApp text message of 4 September 2016. Even \nPradeepto\u2019s solicitors referred to him as having joined EICM as a partner (in \ntheir letter of 25 July 2017). There is no employment contract regarding any \nemployment of Pradeepto by EICM. Mr Anand submitted that, as a shareholder, \nPradeepto is only entitled to the profits of EICM, if any, and as it turned out, \nEICM suffered losses throughout the years.\n10 On record, the shareholder of EICM was IOG, not Pradeepto, but the \ndirect issue is whether Pradeepto was an employee of EICM. The legal \narrangements were loose, but it appears from the evidence that Pradeepto, who \nhad direct control of IOG, got IOG into EICM as a shareholder. In return, \nPradeepto himself was to be employed to find business for EICM. It was under \nthis employment that he was to be paid a \u201cnotional\u201d $20,000 a month, \nsubsequently adjusted downwards by mutual consent in April 2017 to $10,000 \na month. The word \u201cnotional\u201d was not defined or explained contemporaneously. \nMr Anand now argues that it must mean that it was not a real salary. If counsel \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPradeepto Kumar Biswas v[2019] SGHC 183\nEast India Capital Management Pte Ltd\n4is right, then the payment of Pradeepto\u2019s employee CPF by EICM is \ninexplicable. I am of the view that \u201cnotional\u201d means \u201cunpaid\u201d because of the \nundisputed agreement to defer actual payment.\n11 It is incontrovertible that EICM paid the employer\u2019s CPF contribution \ninto Pradeepto\u2019s CPF account even though the salary itself was deferred. \nFurthermore, on 18 June 2017, Hopkin wrote to Pradeepto expressly telling him \nthat EICM was terminating his employment with the company. Emails to other \nclients of EICM such as Amardeep Singh and Abishek Gupta also used the \nwords \u201cterminated Pradeepto\u2019s employment\u201d. In its correspondence with the \nMonetary Authority of Singapore, Hopkins also stated that Pradeepto was \n\u201cemployed by EICM as an introducer of clients\u201d.\n12 The question remains \u2014 is Pradeepto entitled to his differed salary? The \nagreement between Pradeepto and EICM was that he would defer his salary \nuntil EICM was profitable. This is not a clear agreement because it does not tell \nus what happens if Pradeepto was terminated before EICM became profitable, \nwhich is the case now. Clearly this right would not survive the termination of \nthe contract and it would be impractical for Pradeepto or EICM to wait for \nEICM to turn profitable after he had left the company. The only reasonable \ninterpretation of this term is that the deferred salary becomes payable when the \ncompany becomes profitable or when the contract of employment is terminated, \nwhichever is sooner.\n13 I am satisfied from the accounting record that EICM made a net loss of \nUS$12,794.86, US$45,946 and US$219,044 for the years 2015, 2016 and 2018 \nrespectively. The company made a profit of US$2,967 in 2017. On the whole, \nit cannot be said that EICM was profitable, but since Pradeepto\u2019s employment \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPradeepto Kumar Biswas v[2019] SGHC 183\nEast India Capital Management Pte Ltd\n5had been terminated, his deferred salary of $351,312.64 becomes due and \npayable, and I so hold.\n14 With regard to"}

As agreed between ERMS and Chiu Teng at the trial, CTBF also collected the total sum of $600 that BFEW paid ERMS and Chiu Teng for each worker trained at BFEW\u2019s training centre who passed the trade test at the OTC and was mobilised to work in Singapore (see [9] above). 20', 'As pleaded by ERMS in its statement of claim, from 2008 to April 2011, ERMS was paid 49% of the net profits of CTBF through dividend payments. 21', 'It was not disputed that these net profits were derived after accounting for the costs of running CTBF. 22', 'Monsur gave evidence at the trial that during this period of time, ERMS had agreed to receiving such dividend payments as its share of the direct testing fees (and of the payment from BFEW). 23', '18\\u2003The 2008 JVA only had two clauses pertaining to the duration of the 2008 JVA, ie, cll 10 and 11 of \u201cOther Points\u201d. 24', 'Clause 10 stated that the 2008 JVA was to be for a period of six months from 1 October 2008 to 31 March 2009, and if no objections were raised on the expiry date, it shall be deemed agreed by the three parties and shall continue. Clause 11 stated that the 2008 JVA \u201cshall terminate on the expiry, revocation or suspension of BCA\u2019s endorsement of the OTC\u201d.', '19\\u2003ERMS pleaded that Chiu Teng abided by the 2008 JVA from 2008 to June 2011. 25', '20\\u2003From early 2011, BCA imposed, for the first time, a quota on the number of workers who could be tested for each trade at each overseas test centre each month. 26', 'This resulted in ERMS, Chiu Teng and BFEW meeting on 14 May 2011 and agreeing that until ERMS and BFEW furnished a more detailed proposal, the quota for the number of workers who could be tested for each of five trades at the OTC was to be allocated as follows: 30% to ERMS, 30% to Chiu Teng and 40% to BFEW. 27', 'This agreement (\u201cMay 2011 Agreement\u201d) was recorded in the minutes of the meeting. The quotas allocated to ERMS and BFEW were for the workers trained at the training centres of ERMS and BFEW respectively, and the quota allocated to Chiu Teng was for direct testing workers.', '21\\u2003On 15 June 2011 or 16 June 2011, Monsur had a meeting with three representatives of Chiu Teng, namely, Mr Ng Chee Hwa (\u201cCH Ng\u201d), Cedric Ng and Kor. 28', 'CH Ng was the managing director of Chiu Teng. Thereafter, on 17 June 2011, Monsur had a second meeting with these three representatives of Chiu Teng. 29', '22\\u2003After the second meeting and on the same day, Monsur signed a document entitled \u201cMinutes for Meeting on 17\/06\/2011\u201d, which evidenced the following agreement (\u201cJune 2011 Agreement\u201d): 30', '23\\u2003It was common ground that cl 1 of the June 2011 Agreement meant that with effect from the April 2011 testing, ERMS would not be receiving a share of the direct testing fees which had originally been provided for under cl 8 of \u201cOther Points\u201d of the 2008 JVA (see [13] above). This was because CTBF had been collecting the direct testing fee of $345 per direct testing worker and paying ERMS 49% of its net profits through dividend payments.', '24\\u2003In fact, after June 2011, CTBF no longer collected the direct testing fees, and Chiu Teng used CTTC Management Services Pte Ltd (\u201cCTTC\u201d) (of which Kor was a director 31', ') to collect the direct testing fees instead. 32', 'ERMS was not a shareholder of CTTC.', '25\\u2003Clause 2 of the June 2011 Agreement meant that with effect from the April 2011 testing, ERMS would have to pay CTTC $600 for every worker trained at ERMS\u2019 training centre who passed the trade test at the OTC. In comparison, the 2008 JVA did not provide that ERMS had to make any such payment for the workers trained at its training centre (see [10] above).', '26\\u2003It was undisputed that ERMS agreed to the June 2011 Agreement. 33', 'What was in dispute was whether Cedric Ng (and\/or the other two representatives of Chiu Teng) had threatened Monsur during the two meetings that unless Monsur agreed to the June 2011 Agreement, Chiu Teng would stop the registration for the July 2011 testing at the OTC of the workers trained at the training centres of ERMS and BFEW. 34', 'ERMS alleged that such a threat was made, while Chiu Teng denied it. It was nevertheless agreed that Chiu Teng had in fact registered these workers on 17 June 2011, which was the last day for registration of workers for the July 2011 testing at the OTC, and Chiu Teng had done so after the June 2011 Agreement was entered into. 35', 'Cedric Ng had agreed to this fact during cross-examination when he was referred to his evidence as recorded in the transcripts of the trial before Leow JC. 36', '27\\u2003ERMS claimed that the alleged threat would have meant that workers who were not registered for the July 2011 testing would have to wait until the subsequent month, at the earliest, to be registered for testing at the OTC. 37', 'ERMS would also still be subjected to the quota it was allocated for the number of workers who could be tested at the OTC each month. 38', 'ERMS also submitted that it would then have to pay for the workers\u2019 accommodation and meals for such longer period until they could be tested at the OTC. 39', '28\\u2003I mention two further points in relation to the June 2011 Agreement. First, ERMS did not plead that Monsur signed the minutes evidencing the June 2011 Agreement believing the minutes to be only a set of minutes which was not binding. ERMS however made such a point in its opening statement at para 49. In any case, I will not consider this point as it contradicts the pleading of ERMS that Monsur had agreed to the June 2011 Agreement but that the June 2011 Agreement was procured by economic duress.', '29\\u2003Second, ERMS did not plead that the June 2011 Agreement was subject to review. In so far as Monsur seemed to have suggested that \u201che agreed to the meeting of minutes \u2026 on \u2026 17th June because they [ie, Chiu Teng] mentioned that it will be in review\u201d, 40', 'Monsur should not be taken to have meant that he had agreed to the June 2011 Agreement on a condition that it was subject to review. What he meant was that after the June 2011 Agreement had already been entered into, Chiu Teng allegedly gave an assurance thereafter that it would review the June 2011 Agreement. 41', 'This meant that the June 2011 Agreement did not, in fact, include a term that it was subject to review. ERMS also did not plead that the June 2011 Agreement was subject to review or that the June 2011 Agreement lapsed because there was no review.', '30\\u2003On 6 July 2012, ERMS and Chiu Teng entered into another agreement (\u201cJuly 2012 Agreement\u201d), which was evidenced by the minutes for the meeting on the same day. 42', 'While ERMS pleaded in its statement of claim that the July 2012 Agreement was entered into in May 2012, 43', 'ERMS in its opening statement and submissions took the position that the July 2012 Agreement was entered into on 6 July 2012 instead. 44', 'Chiu Teng also stated in its opening statement and submissions that the July 2012 Agreement was entered into on 6 July 2012. 45', '31\\u2003The July 2012 Agreement was for the settling of the accounts of BFEW and ERMS with Chiu Teng. 46', 'The parties were agreed that the July 2012 Agreement was a compromise. 47', 'From the minutes of the meeting, Monsur signed for and on behalf of ERMS as its director in undertaking to pay CTTC $129,709.02. (It is unclear if Monsur, who had been appointed agent of BFEW since 2012, was authorised to enter into the July 2012 Agreement on behalf of BFEW as well. 48', ') The sum of $129,709.02 was arrived at after computing the following:', '(a)\\u2003amount BFEW was owing to Chiu Teng:', '(b)\\u2003amount ERMS was owing to Chiu Teng as at June 2012;', '(c)\\u2003less proposed dividend due to ERMS in 2011; and', '(d)\\u2003less direct testing fees of $100 for each of the 868 direct testing workers under Chiu Teng\u2019s quota from April 2011 to May 2012.', '32\\u2003I mention three points about the July 2012 Agreement. First, in respect of [31(a)(i)] above, instead of paying ERMS and Chiu Teng a total sum of $600 for every worker who was mobilised to work in Singapore (see [9] above), BFEW would only be paying Chiu Teng $400 instead for every such worker.', '33\\u2003Second, in respect of [31(b)] above, the amount ERMS owed to Chiu Teng as at June 2012 included the sum of $600 for every worker which ERMS was supposed to pay CTTC under cl 2 of the June 2011 Agreement with effect from the April 2011 testing (see [25] above). This was accepted by ERMS at the trial and in its closing submissions at para 19. 49', 'Further arguments by the parties concerning this payment are discussed at [103]\u2013[105] below.', '34\\u2003Third, in respect of [31(d)] above, the July 2012 Agreement provided that ERMS had a share of the direct testing fees from April 2011 to May 2012, ie, $100 for each direct testing worker. Clause 1 of the June 2011 Agreement had instead provided that with effect from the April 2011 testing, ERMS would not be receiving a share of the direct testing fees (see [23] above).', '35\\u2003The parties were agreed that from June 2012 to August 2014, the OTC conducted trade tests for a total of 2,248 direct testing workers. 50', 'The OTC did not conduct anymore trade tests for direct testing workers thereafter.', '36\\u2003On 27 October 2017, a winding up order was made against CTBF and the liquidation has since been completed. 51', '37\\u2003The crux of ERMS\u2019 case in this suit was that ERMS was not paid any share of the direct testing fees for these 2,248 direct testing workers. Alleging that Chiu Teng was consequently in breach of the 2008 JVA, 52', 'ERMS claims from Chiu Teng a 50% share of these direct testing fees, which ERMS submits to be $387,780 (ie, 50% x $345 x 2,248), with interest. 53'"}

Kensington is a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands on 7 January 2008, in which Tong has a beneficial interest. Tong is also the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Macau Natural Gas Company Limited (\u201cMacau Gas\u201d), an entity incorporated in Macau on 13 December 2001.', '8\\u2003Sudhir is a Malaysian businessman who controlled the following three companies: Firstfield Limited (\u201cFirstfield\u201d), Al-Rafidian and Petunia. In the conduct of his business affairs, Sudhir was assisted by a Singaporean associate, Kundadak Ramesh Kudva (\u201cRamesh\u201d).', '9\\u2003Sometime in late 2006, representing Macau Gas, Tong began sourcing for a long term supply of liquefied natural gas (\u201cLNG\u201d) for a LNG-receiving terminal in Macau.', '10\\u2003Originally, Tong wanted to source for LNG from Malaysia. On 6 August 2007, Tong met with a Malaysian businessman, Mohamed Nazim Bin Tun Razak (\u201cNazim\u201d). Nazim informed Tong that LNG was not available from Malaysia. Instead, Nazim suggested that Tong source for LNG from Indonesia. Nazim introduced Sudhir to Tong as a person with the necessary experience, capability and contacts to facilitate the process. One of Sudhir\u2019s contacts was Anton Tjahjono (\u201cTjahjono\u201d), the Chairman of the Indonesian Gas Association.', '11\\u2003I shall refer to this planned project for the supply of LNG from Indonesia to Macau as \u201cthe LNG Project\u201d. From sometime in August 2007 onwards, Nazim, Tjahjono and Sudhir worked to secure a LNG supply from an Indonesian state-owned entity known as Badan Pelaksana Kegiatan Usaha Hulu Minyak Dan Gas Bumi (\u201cBPMIGAS\u201d). BPMIGAS represented the Indonesian government in managing Indonesia\u2019s oil and gas resources, and reported to the Minister of Energy and Resources.', '12\\u2003Meanwhile, there were ongoing negotiations for a formal agreement to be entered into by Nazim, Sudhir and their associates for the provision of consultancy services to Macau Gas. Eventually, a consultancy agreement dated 30 October 2008 was entered into between Kensington, which was incorporated for the purpose of the LNG Project, and Firstfield (\u201cthe Consultancy Agreement\u201d). 1', 'By then, Sudhir was taking the lead in the provision of the consultancy services.', '13\\u2003The key terms of the Consultancy Agreement were as follows:', '(a)\\u2003Under cl 3.1, Kensington engaged Firstfield as a consultant, to provide services, inter alia, so as to procure a long-term source of LNG from BPMIGAS for the LNG Project. To this end, Firstfield was to procure the signing of a Heads of Agreement (\u201cHOA\u201d) followed by a Sale and Purchase Agreement (\u201cSPA\u201d) between Macau Gas and BPMIGAS. The anticipated supply was 3,000,000 tonnes of LNG per year for the first 1\u00bd years, and then an increased supply for the next 23\u00bd years.', '(b)\\u2003By cl 3.2, Firstfield \u201cshall be fully responsible for all the expenses incurred in the course of performing the [services]\u201d.', '(c)\\u2003Firstfield\u2019s compensation terms were set out in Clause 6. By cl 6.1, subject to a successful signing of the HOA and SPA, Kensington would pay Firstfield a consultancy fee of US$4,000,000. A sum of US$2,500,000 would be deposited with an escrow agent, with releases as follows: (i) US$1,000,000 as a downpayment; and (ii) US$1,500,000 upon the signing of the HOA. Another sum of US$1,500,000 would be deposited with the escrow agent no later than 90 days before the designated date of the signing of the SPA, and would be released to Firstfield upon the signing of the SPA.', '(d)\\u2003By cl 6.3, in the event of failure of the LNG Project, and if the failure were to be caused by Firstfield, Firstfield would be liable to reimburse the payments to Kensington. This obligation would not arise if Macau Gas or Kensington were to fail to comply with the requirements of BPMIGAS.', '(e)\\u2003By cl 6.2, should the LNG Project be a success, Firstfield would receive a share of the freight in the transport of the LNG at the rate of \u201cUS$0.22 per MMBTU\u201d of LNG shipped. As one tonne of LNG is about 50 MMBTU, on the basis of a supply of 3,000,000 tonnes for 25 years, this would have meant a handsome sum of US$825,000,000 for Firstfield over the course of the project.', '14\\u2003In the period from August 2008 to March 2010, the plaintiffs made Payments 1 and 2 to Hesselink, Payments 3 to 6, 9, 12, 13, 15, 16 and 18 to Al-Rafidian, Payments 7 to 8 to Sudhir and Payment 17 to Rianto. Hesselink was a vehicle controlled by Nazim, while Rianto was an Indonesian associate of Sudhir who was brought on board the project in late 2009. In addition, the US$500,000 payment to Rianto took place on or around 13 May 2010.', '15\\u2003At the end of the day, the LNG Project did not materialise. It was the plaintiffs\u2019 position that all these payments were in relation to the LNG Project, and Sudhir had agreed to be liable for them. Sudhir, however, denied that Payments 1, 2, 12, part of Payment 13 (US$250,000 out of US$350,000) and Payment 17 were connected to the LNG Project. He had no knowledge of the US$500,000 payment to Rianto. Even for the payments related to the LNG Project, he bore no liability for them as these were paid to the Indonesian parties with the knowledge and consent of Tong.', '16\\u2003I move to the other dealings between the parties. On 7 August 2009 and 11 September 2009, Kensington made two payments to Petunia and Al-Rafidian in the sums of US$1,642,000 and US$600,000 respectively. These were Payments 10 and 11. On 9 October 2009, 11,000,000 ordinary shares in a company known as Ocean King Limited (\u201cOKL\u201d) were transferred by Petunia to Tong.', '17\\u2003It was Tong\u2019s case that the payments were meant as two separate loans granted to Sudhir on his requests, to further Sudhir\u2019s venture to procure the listing of the OKL shares in the United Kingdom. Security was to be furnished by way of 6,500,000 and 4,500,000 ordinary shares in OKL respectively, to be transferred upon the listing. Sudhir had acknowledged liability for these sums of money, and the plaintiffs claimed the amounts against Sudhir.', '18\\u2003Sudhir disputed that these payments were personal loans to him. He contended that Tong had purchased 11,000,000 shares in OKL, and paid for these by way of Payments 10 to 12 and part of Payment 13 (US$250,000 out of US$350,000). This amounted to a total sum of US$2,842,000.', '19\\u2003Tong also paid a sum of HK$10,000 to Cynthia. This was Payment 14. According to Tong, on or about 30 November 2009, Sudhir called him while he was in Hong Kong, and requested a favour from him to lend a sum of money to Cynthia, his girlfriend, who was then in Hong Kong. Given the business relationship between them, Tong agreed to do so, and arranged for an employee of his to pass the sum of money to Cynthia at her hotel. Sudhir disputed liability for the amount.', '20\\u2003On 21 May 2010, Tong furnished US$1,000,000 to Abiyoso, who was another one of Sudhir\u2019s Indonesian associates involved in the LNG Project from late 2009. According to the plaintiffs, sometime in April 2010, Sudhir and Ramesh approached Tong about a project involving the supply of Indonesian sand to Singapore (\u201cthe Sand Project\u201d). Ramesh asked Tong to provide an advance of US$1,000,000. In return, he would be given a share of the profits should the project come to fruition. If not, Tong would be repaid the sum of US$1,000,000, based on a security cheque furnished by Abiyoso. Tong was reluctant to do so. However, as Sudhir also agreed to be personally liable for the advance, Tong acceded to the request. Tong sought a repayment of the amount from Sudhir. Sudhir, however, denied any involvement in the Sand Project.', '21\\u2003As I stated at the outset at [2] above, a series of documents were signed by Sudhir acknowledging liability for the payments. Parties disputed the circumstances in which Sudhir signed the repayment documents. According to Tong, by early February 2010, he became worried about the huge amounts being advanced to Sudhir without any significant progress on the LNG Project. Tong began to ask Sudhir to acknowledge his liability for the amounts by way of the repayment documents. Sudhir alleged, inter alia, that he was tricked by Tong into signing the repayment documents, and that they were not meant to have any legal effect at all. I deal with the factual disputes from [73] onwards. For now, I will briefly describe the repayment documents in chronological order.', '22\\u2003For Payment 16, a standalone loan agreement was signed dated 5 February 2010 in which Sudhir agreed to repay the loan to Tong (\u201cthe 5 February 2010 Loan Agreement\u201d). 2', 'On the same day, in respect of Payments 1 to 16, a document dated 5 February 2010 titled \u201cList of Loans to Mr. Jaya Sudhir\u201d, was signed, whereby Sudhir acknowledged his receipt of Payments 1 to 16 as loans (\u201cthe 5 February 2010 Acknowledgement\u201d). 3', '23\\u2003Subsequently, around the time of Payment 18, Sudhir acknowledged his indebtedness for Payments 1 to 18 in the 3 March 2010 Acknowledgement which stated as follows: 4', '24\\u2003Then, the 30 December 2010 Deed was entered into by Kensington with Al-Rafidian, Petunia and Sudhir. 5', 'In the document, it was acknowledged that since August 2008, a series of loans had been made to Al-Rafidian and Petunia, with Sudhir\u2019s consent. In respect of three of the loans, being Payments 6, 9 and 10 (amounting to US$2,272,000), Al-Rafidian and Petunia agreed to repay US$3,250,000 (based on interest of 2% per month from the time of the payments until the end of December 2010) to Kensington. The repayment was to be by way of instalments of US$300,000 per month from the end of January 2011, with complete payment to be made by 30 September 2011. In other words, the instalment plan was for nine months. As for Sudhir, he personally guaranteed the instalment obligation of Al-Rafidian and Petunia. It was also stipulated that parties would endeavour to enter into further deeds to deal with remaining loan amounts.', '25\\u2003Subsequently, there were two other formal agreements made on 28 February 2011 with Kensington, one involving Petunia acknowledging liability for US$1,642,000 and the other involving Al-Rafidian acknowledging liability for US$4,200,000. In these documents, Sudhir guaranteed the repayment obligations of Petunia and Al-Rafidian to Kensington. I shall refer to these collectively as \u201cthe 28 February 2011 Agreements\u201d. 6', 'I pause to reiterate that in this action, the plaintiffs only relied on the 3 March 2010 Acknowledgment and the 30 December 2010 Deed. However, in support of his defence, Sudhir relied heavily on the 28 February 2011 Agreements, along with a statement signed by the parties on 7 January 2011 (\u201cthe 7 January 2011 Statement\u201d). 7', 'I shall discuss these documents at [96] below.', '26\\u2003For completeness, I should add that at the material time, Sudhir arranged for Al-Rafidian to issue seven UOB cheques to Tong. I shall refer to these as the \u201cUOB cheques\u201d. Tong said that these cheques were meant to provide security for the outstanding amounts owed by Sudhir as Sudhir asked for more and more sums of money from Tong. Sudhir, however, claimed that he was tricked by Tong into issuing these cheques.'"}

Just before the bus lane ended (ie, just before the line separating the left and centre lanes changed from a continuous yellow line to a dotted yellow line), the Taxi swerved from the centre lane to the left lane (\u201cFirst Lane Switch\u201d), and thereafter into the Bay Area (\u201cSecond Lane Switch\u201d) in the span of 2 to 2.5 seconds (GD at [16(d)]). The Taxi\u2019s Front-View Recording shows that the Taxi started swerving from the left side of the centre lane, thereafter travelled in a straight path across the left lane at about a 30 degree angle, and entered the Bay Area. 4', 'When the front of the Taxi was inside the Bay Area, the collision occurred. 5', 'The Driver then moved slightly forward to straighten the position of the Taxi to be parallel to the road, with the final position of the Taxi resting about half inside the Bay Area and half outside the Bay Area on the leftmost lane of Simei Avenue.', '8\\u2003Before conducting the First Lane Switch, the Driver looked at the Taxi\u2019s rear and left wing mirrors. However, the Driver failed to check again for oncoming traffic in his left blind spot: by turning his head across his left shoulder when switching from the centre lane to the left lane and then into the Bay Area (GD at [40]). When the Taxi was moving from the centre lane to the left lane, the Motorcycle was only 1 to 2 car lengths behind the Taxi and was travelling on the line separating the left lane and the centre lane (GD at [16(g)]). As the Taxi was travelling not in the middle but more to the left side of the centre lane (as can be seen from the Taxi\u2019s Front-View Recording), that would put the Motorcycle near the left blind spot of the Driver before the Driver swerved at an angle of about 30 degrees to cross the left lane and enter the Bay Area. As the Taxi moved from the centre lane to the left lane, the Motorcycle (that was travelling on the line separating the left lane and centre lane) followed suit and moved left, but accelerated and attempted to overtake the Taxi from the left (GD at [16(h)]). The Motorcycle attempted to squeeze through the gap between the left of the Taxi and the left roadside kerb. 6', 'However, as the Taxi continued to move left into the Bay Area, the Motorcycle failed to overtake the Taxi and this resulted in a collision between the Taxi and the Motorcycle inside the Bay Area. The point of impact between both vehicles was at the Taxi\u2019s left side mirror, which was damaged as a result of the accident. 7'"}

V lived in an HDB estate. In her spare time, she worked as a service \nassistant at a clinic. This was not the accused\u2019s clinic. V usually worked about \ntwo to five hours a week at this other clinic and her duties involved registering \npatients, packing medication, and cashiering.\n11 V frequently experienced gastric issues and dermatitis.1 Before \nNovember 2014, she had sought treatment at the clinic where she had worked, \nbut her condition persisted despite taking the prescribed medication, and she did \nnot like the fact that the doctor there did not conduct follow-up checks.2 From \nNovember 2014, V went to seek treatment at the accused\u2019s clinic because she \nwanted to consult another doctor about her symptoms.3 In addition, the \naccused\u2019s clinic was under the Community Health Assist Scheme (\u201cCHAS\u201d) \nand this meant that V\u2019s consultations and treatments were subsidised.4 V may \nhave previously visited the accused\u2019s clinic as a child some ten years ago,5 but \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Wee Teong Boo[2019] SGHC 198\n4the accused could not confirm this as records of these visits were too old and \nwould have been disposed of.6\n12 Prior to 25 November 2015 (the date of the alleged OM offence), V was \ntreated by the accused 22 times between 28 November 2014 and 5 November \n2015.7 V had no complaints against the accused during these 22 prior visits. In \nfact, she felt he was a good doctor as he listened carefully to her complaints, \nwrote them down, and performed detailed checks.8\n13 Annex A is a copy of the sketch plan of the accused\u2019s clinic that was \nadmitted in evidence as exhibit P49.\n14 The accused\u2019s clinic assistants occupied the area behind the reception \ncounter (\u201cthe reception area\u201d). Next to the accused\u2019s desk in the consultation \nroom was a pigeon hole which led to the reception area. The only access to the \nexamination room was from the consultation room. A sliding door separated the \nexamination room from the consultation room. The examination room had a bed \nfor patients to lie on during the examination (\u201cthe examination bed\u201d). In \nAnnex A, the examination bed is marked \u201cA\u201d to show where swabs were taken.\nEvents on 25 November 2015\n15 V testified that on 25 November 2015, she was experiencing gastric \ndiscomfort. She went to the accused\u2019s clinic in the late afternoon.9 V had a brief \nconsultation with the accused in the consultation room.10 \n16 Following the consultation, the accused directed V to the examination \nroom. V lay flat on the examination bed, as instructed by the accused.11 The \naccused closed the sliding door to the examination room.12 There was no \nchaperone present.13 V testified that she had not been offered one on any of her \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Wee Teong Boo[2019] SGHC 198\n5prior consultations and examinations, and that she had not requested for one as \nshe had not known she could ask for a chaperone.14 The accused instructed her \nto unbuckle and unzip the jeans she was wearing so that he could check her \npelvic area and V did as instructed.15 V did not question the need to unbuckle \nand unzip her jeans as she trusted the accused as her doctor.16\n17 The accused began to press V\u2019s lower abdominal area17 before pressing \non the \u201cjoint area\u201d near her groin and remarking that there were lumps there.18 \nThe accused then started pressing V\u2019s vagina with the fingers of his right hand.19 \nV marked this area on a drawing.20 This area was subsequently identified as the \nvulva.21 The accused said \u201cokay, okay\u201d as he was pressing her vulva, but V was \nnot sure if he meant that as a statement or a question.22 She replied \u201cokay\u201d \nbecause there was no pain.23\n18 V testified that the accused then slid his right hand under her panties and \nbegan stroking her at the vaginal area.24 This vaginal area was subsequently also \nidentified on a marked drawing as her vulva.25 The accused then asked her to sit \nup and she complied as she thought it was part of the medical examination.26 \nWhen V sat up, the accused\u2019s right hand continued to stroke her vulva under her \npanties,27 while his left hand rubbed V\u2019s lower back in a circular motion.28 She \nwas not sure how long the accused stroked her vulva for, but it felt like a long \ntime to her.29 After some time, V thought she heard the accused say \u201cokay\u201d \nbefore withdrawing his hand.30\n19 V claimed she felt the accused\u2019s actions were \u201cweird\u201d, as this was the \nfirst time someone of the opposite gender had touched her at her vaginal area.31 \nShe also felt \u201cuneasy\u201d because the accused was standing very close to her.32 The \naccused did not explain why he was stroking her vaginal area.33 V did not voice \nher discomfort to the accused because she trusted him and his judgment.34 V felt \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Wee Teong Boo[2019] SGHC 198\n6that the accused was a good doctor because he was thorough.35 V had assumed \nthat it was part of the medical examination as the accused had palpated her upper \nabdominal area in a similar manner on prior visits.36 In particular, she felt that \nhis actions were similar to how he had asked if it was \u201cokay\u201d when he pressed \nher upper abdomen on previous examinations. \nV\u2019s visit to the polyclinic on 5 December 2015\n20 V scheduled an appointment at a polyclinic to have the lumps checked. \nShe visited the polyclinic on 5 December 2015,37 and requested for a female \ndoctor. She told the polyclinic doctor, later identified as Dr Sheena K Gendeh \nJekinder Singh (\u201cDr Sheena\u201d), that a lump was suspected near her groin. Dr \nSheena pressed the same \u201cjoint area\u201d and told V that there was indeed a lump. \nThis reassured V that what the accused had done to her on 25 November 2015 \nwas just a medical examination.38 Dr Sheena told her it was a swollen lymph \nnode, and prescribed antibiotics for her.39 A tax invoice confirmed that V had \npaid a visit to the polyclinic on 5 December 2015.40\nEvents on 30\u201331 December 2015\nAt the accused\u2019s clinic\n21 V testified that on the morning of 30 December 2015, she felt an itch at \nher genital area and was experiencing frequent urination.41 She first went to the \npolyclinic in the afternoon, but it was crowded.42 She decided to go to the \naccused\u2019s clinic. Her last visit to the accused\u2019s clinic was on 25 November 2015. \nShe made a call to the accused\u2019s clinic and was told to go at around 11pm.43 \nV turned up at the accused\u2019s clinic at about 11.30pm. When it was her turn, \nV entered the accused\u2019s consultation room, and she told him about the frequent \nurination and the itch at her genital area.44 She also asked for a repeat \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Wee Teong Boo[2019] SGHC 198\n7prescription for her usual gastric medication.45\n22 In the consultation room, the accused used a stethoscope to listen to V\u2019s \nlungs and took her temperature.46 The accused then instructed V to proceed to \nthe examination room.47 The accused closed the sliding door after they entered \nthe examination room. Again, no chaperone was present.48\n23 On that day, V was wearing a t-shirt and shorts. V lay down on the \nexamination bed.49 She lifted up her t-shirt as instructed by the accused. The \naccused stood on V\u2019s right near her waist and hips,50 and he began tapping on \nher upper abdomen.51 As the accused examined her lower abdomen, he pushed \nher shorts lower.52 The accused then began examining V\u2019s pelvic area. V saw \nthe accused\u2019s left hand going under the waistband of her shorts, while she felt \nhis right hand entering through the opening of her shorts from the legs.53 \n24 V felt the accused\u2019s fingers pressing on the same \u201cjoint area\u201d that V \ndescribed on 25 November 2015. Once again, he told her that there was a \nlump.54 She then felt the accused\u2019s right hand rubbing on her vaginal area. The \naccused\u2019s hand was under her shorts, but above her panties and panty liner.55 V \nfelt the accused\u2019s hand moving up and down.56 The accused asked if this was \nthe part where V felt the itch.57 V replied that it was.58\n25 The accused then instructed V to pull down her shorts and panties. She \ncomplied and pulled her shorts and panties down to her thigh level.59 V thought \nthat it was low enough for the accused to examine her genital area.60 However, \nthe accused asked V to remove them completely.61 When V hesitated, the \naccused removed her shorts and panties for her.62 As he did so, he moved further \ndown towards the end of the examination bed, but still on V\u2019s right.63 He placed \nV\u2019s shorts and panties next to her left leg,64 and told her that he would be leaving \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Wee Teong Boo[2019] SGHC 198\n8her shorts there.65 During this time, V thought that the accused was performing \na medical examination.66\n26 V testified that the accused then repositioned her on the examination \nbed, such that her legs were apart and he was standing between them.67 She \nclaimed the accused was holding on to her legs, above her ankles.68 As the \naccused moved her body, her head moved off the pillow and rested on the bed.69 \nHer buttocks and left thigh were still on the examination bed, but her lower legs \nwere hanging off the examination bed, supported by the accused\u2019s hands.70 To \nthe best of her recollection, V weighed about 48 kilograms at the material time, \nand she was 1.64 metres tall.71\n27 V testified that while in this position, she heard the sound of a zipper.72 \nThe accused released his hold on one of her legs. From the corner of her eye, V \nsaw the accused\u2019s hand move toward his zipper.73 V thought that the accused \nhad forgotten to zip his pants.74 After that, the accused moved his hand back to \nsupporting V\u2019s leg again.75\n28 The accused repositioned V for a second time, moving her further to his \nright.76 From her position, V could only see the accused\u2019s upper chest and his \nhead.77 V\u2019s right buttock was off the examination bed, but her left buttock \nremained resting on it. She could feel that her legs were supported at the \naccused\u2019s waist level.78 The accused then repositioned V a third time \u2013 V \ntestified that she could feel the accused\u2019s hands moving from her ankles to \nbelow her knees, and she felt herself being pulled toward the accused.79 In this \nposition, V\u2019s left buttock rested on the edge of the bed, with part of it off the \nbed.80 \n29 While in this position, V stated that she felt \u201csomething horizontal\u201d poke \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Wee Teong Boo[2019] SGHC 198\n9into her vagina. However, she could not see what it was as she could only see \nthe accused\u2019s head and chest.81 V felt pain and she saw the accused\u2019s body \nmoving forward and backward with each poking sensation.82 During the \n\u201ccontinuous poking\u201d, V felt pain and after \u201ca few times\u201d, she complained to the \naccused about the pain because it got more and more painful.83 While V felt the \npoking sensation in her vagina, the accused\u2019s hands were supporting her legs at \nall times.84 \n30 The accused then let go of V\u2019s legs, and his hands moved to support her \nlower back, pulling her closer to him.85 V was brought to a \u201chalf-sit\u201d position \nwhere she was no longer lying on her back. V described her buttocks as being \non the very edge of the bed. Her bodyweight was supported by her right hand \n(which was on the examination bed) and the accused\u2019s hands.86 V stated that it \nwas at this moment that she saw the accused\u2019s pants were unzipped and that his \npenis was partially inside her vagina.87 V was shocked.88 She put up her left \nhand as a gesture to the accused to stop.89\n31 V testified that she did not call for help as she was in a state of shock. \nShe simply froze.90 The accused withdrew his penis and let go of V. He then \nturned his back toward her. V was not sure if the accused had ejaculated.91 She \nheard the sound of a zipper. V put on her shorts and panties and got off the \nexamination bed.92 \n32 The accused and V returned to the consultation room and the accused \nspoke to her about the medication he was prescribing. V could not remember \nwhat the accused was saying as she was in a state of shock and her mind was \nbothered by what she had just seen.93 She described herself as being in an \u201cauto-\npilot situation\u201d where she was \u201cgoing through the motions\u201d.94\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Wee Teong Boo[2019] SGHC 198\n1033 Just as she was about to leave the consultation room, V remembered to \nask the accused for medication to delay the onset of her period as she was about \nto go on a school trip to China.95 V testified that asking for the medication was \npart of the \u201cmotion of things\u201d and her being in an \u201cauto-pilot mode\u201d.96 She then \nleft the accused\u2019s consultation room.\n34 After leaving the consultation room, V went to the clinic\u2019s toilet \nimmediately because she felt an urgent need to urinate.97 There was no toilet \npaper available, so she wiped herself using her panty liner. She saw streaks of \nblood on the panty liner.98 Her vagina was feeling very sore.99 V could not find \na bin to dispose of the panty liner, and she held it in her hand.100\n35 V returned to the clinic\u2019s waiting area. She did not tell anyone what had \njust happened as she was still in a state of shock.101 She went to the reception \ncounter and collected the medication. She did not pay attention to what the clinic \nassistant was saying. One of the medications that she had collected was \nciprofloxacin. V had discovered sometime in August 2015 that she was allergic \nto ciprofloxacin, 102 but on that night she had not been paying attention while \nshe collected her medication.103\nAt home\n36 As she was walking home, V threw her stained panty liner into a bin \noutside a coffee shop.104 She reached home at about 1.00am on 31 December \n2015. Her family members were asleep.105 V took a shower even though she \nhad showered about four hours before. She described feeling dirty from what \nthe accused had done to her.106 As she showered, she felt pain in the area around \nher vagina as it was being washed.107 V\u2019s panties had bloodstains on them, so \nshe threw them into a pail of water.108 V put on the same shorts and t-shirt she \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Wee Teong Boo[2019] SGHC 198\n11had worn earlier.\n37 V could not sleep that night; she described herself \u201ctrying to register \nwhat happened at the clinic\u201d, being in a state of confusion, as well as being \n\u201ckind of numb\u201d.109 Although she had seen the accused\u2019s penis in her vagina, it \nwas hard for her to acknowledge and accept what she had seen.110\nV\u2019s conversation with her mother\n38 V\u2019s mother testified that she woke up at around 4.30am and went into \nV\u2019s room to retrieve some clothes. She saw V tossing around in her bed.111 It \nseemed as if something was bothering V and V\u2019s mother asked V why she was \nunable to sleep.112 V told her mother she had visited the accused\u2019s clinic and \nasked her mother under what circumstances a doctor could check a patient\u2019s \nprivate parts. V told her that the accused put something into her vagina, and she \nfelt \u201cviolated\u201d by the accused.113 V did not have the chance to tell her mother \nwhat the \u201csomething\u201d that the accused had put into her vagina was, because her \nmother was not really listening and in a rush to go to work.114 V\u2019s mother \nworked as a cashier at a supermarket and had to report for work by 6.30am.115\n39 V told her mother she would be lodging a police report.116 Her mother \ntestified that when V spoke to her, she was about to leave for work and that she \nintended to apply for urgent leave after reaching her work place.117 \nSubsequently, a police officer called her to tell her that V was at the police \nstation and she applied for urgent leave.\nV\u2019s police report\n40 V left the house at around 5.30am; her mother left for work and did not \naccompany her to the police station.118 V reached the police station at around \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Wee Teong Boo[2019] SGHC 198\n126.00am, and spoke to two police officers.119 \n41 A First Information Report (\u201cFIR\u201d) was filed at 9.24am.120 Two police \nofficers brought V back to her home.

V was examined by Dr Janice Tung Su Zhen (\u201cDr Tung\u201d) at 4.35pm. \nDr Tung found:\n(a) a clear viscous discharge over V\u2019s vulva;\n(b) two small superficial midline split-skin wounds in the posterior \nfourchette area; and\n(c) a very shallow fresh tear of the hymen at \u201c7 to 8 o\u2019clock \nposition\u201d, which was tender when touched with a swab.\nDr Tung also took swabs from the inside of the vagina and the urethra meatus \nfor investigations which subsequently confirmed that V was positive for \nbacterial vaginosis and candida infections. \n43 Dr Tung set out the above findings in her report dated 26 January \n2016.122 Dr Tung explained that bacterial vaginosis and candida were lower \ngenital tract infections (\u201cLGTI\u201d) which were very common and could also occur \nin women who were not sexually active.123 Dr Tung also testified that V\u2019s \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Wee Teong Boo[2019] SGHC 198\n13symptoms, such as frequent urination and an itch at the urethra, were consistent \nwith bacterial vaginosis and candida.124\n44 Dr Tung\u2019s evidence was that the injuries found on V\u2019s fourchette and \nhymen were about one to two millimetres deep.125 She stated that the injuries \nwere consistent with V\u2019s account, ie, penile penetration,126 but they were also \nequally consistent with digital penetration.127\nInvestigations at the accused\u2019s clinic\n45 At about 1.41pm on 31 December 2015, three officers from the Serious \nSexual Crimes Branch arrived at the accused\u2019s clinic. Assistant Superintendents \n(\u201cASP\u201d) Ong Bee Choo Carol (\u201cASP Carol\u201d), Razali bin Razak (\u201cASP Razali\u201d) \nand Xu Jinwei Jereld (\u201cASP Jereld\u201d) entered the consultation room. ASP \nCarol\u2019s evidence was that she informed the accused that a police report had been \nlodged against him.\n46 ASP Carol informed the accused that she would need the accused\u2019s case \nnotes on V. The accused retrieved the case notes from a box in the examination \nroom. ASP Carol checked the case notes in his presence.128 As there were \npatients waiting outside, the police officers gave the accused some time to tend \nto his patients. The accused told them to return at 3.15pm.129\n47 When the officers returned, ASP Carol informed the accused that a \ncomplaint of rape had been lodged against him.130 She informed him that \nphotographs of the clinic would be taken and requested that he give a blood \nsample for subsequent deoxyribonucleic acid (\u201cDNA\u201d) profiling.131 According \nto ASP Carol, the accused stated, \u201cWhy should I give you my blood? You \nshould only take my DNA if you can find sperm in her vagina, which I do not \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Wee Teong Boo[2019] SGHC 198\n14think you can.\u201d132 The accused eventually agreed to give a blood sample after \nASP Carol told him that if he continued to refuse she would obtain a court \norder.133\n48 Several swabs of the examination bed were taken. \nArrest, seizure and custody\n49 At about 4.05pm, the officers and the accused left the clinic and \nproceeded to the accused\u2019s house. There, the officers placed the accused under \narrest for an offence of rape.134 ASP Carol told the accused that she needed to \nretrieve the clothes that he wore on 30 December 2015, and asked ASP Razali \nto assist.135 The accused told ASP Razali that he was wearing the same shirt and \npants from the night before, and as such ASP Razali escorted him into the house \nwhile he changed out of his clothes.136 ASP Razali seized the shirt and pants. \nHe also seized a pair of grey boxer shorts (\u201cthe first pair of boxer shorts\u201d) from \na basket next to the washing machine as the accused said he had been wearing \nthose at the material time.137 Thereafter, the accused was brought to the Police \nCantonment Complex. Custody of the accused was handed to the Central Police \nDivision lock-up later that evening.\nSeizure of boxer shorts on 2 January 2016 \n50 ASP Carol testified that the accused told her that he was wearing the \nsame shirt that he wore on the night of 30 December 2015. ASP Carol then \nasked the accused\u2019s wife to bring a pair of underwear for the accused to change \ninto. The accused\u2019s wife did so and on 2 January 2016, at the Central Police \nDivision lock-up, the accused changed his underwear and ASP Carol seized the \nboxer shorts that the accused had been wearing (\u201cthe second pair of boxer \nshorts\u201d).138 Swabs were also taken from each of the accused\u2019s fingers.139\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Wee Teong Boo[2019] SGHC 198\n1551 A statement was recorded from the accused by ASP Jereld at 5.00pm on \n31 December 2015. Another statement was recorded by ASP Carol at around \n10.00am, on 1 January 2016.\nResults of tests by HSA\n52 The items seized from V and the accused, and the swabs that had been \ntaken, were sent to the Health Sciences Authority (\u201cHSA\") for testing. No \nincriminating evidence was found. In summary, the results were as follows:140\n(a) Brown stains on V\u2019s panties and t-shirt tested negative for the \npresumptive Kastle-Meyer (\u201cKM\u201d) test for blood. \n(b) V\u2019s panties, t-shirt, shorts and vaginal swabs tested negative for \nsperm. \n(c) The DNA profiles obtained from swabs of V\u2019s shorts, t-shirt and \nfrom her vaginal swabs matched V\u2019s DNA profile. No interpretable \nDNA profile was obtained from the swabs of V\u2019s panties.\n(d) The swabs of the accused\u2019s fingers and a brown stain on the \naccused\u2019s shirt tested negative for the presumptive KM test for blood. \n(e) The DNA profile obtained from the swab of one of the accused\u2019s \nfingers matched the accused\u2019s DNA profile. Mixed DNA profiles were \nobtained from the accused\u2019s first pair of boxer shorts and from the swabs \nof his other nine fingers. The accused was included as a major \ncontributor to the mixed DNA profiles; the additional DNA was \nuninterpretable. No interpretable DNA profile was obtained from swabs \nof the accused\u2019s shirt, pants and the second pair of boxer shorts.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Wee Teong Boo[2019] SGHC 198\n16(f) The swabs of the examination bed tested negative for the \npresumptive KM test for blood. No interpretable DNA profile was \nobtained from these swabs. \n53 The Prosecution\u2019s expert explained that:\n(a) a negative result for a presumptive KM test for blood could mean \nthat there was no blood or that the blood was below the detection limit \nof 1 in 1,000 times dilution;141\n(b) the fact that V washed her vaginal area with soap and water and \nsoaked her panties in water could have led to a loss of semen;142 and\n(c) no interpretable DNA profile could mean that insufficient DNA \nwas obtained or that DNA from multiple persons with no single \ncontributor was obtained.143\nThe Defence\u2019s case\n54 At the close of the Prosecution\u2019s case, I was of the view that there was \nsome evidence which was not inherently incredible and which satisfied each \nand every element of the charges as framed by the Prosecution. I therefore called \non the accused to give his defence. The accused elected to give evidence in his \nown defence.\nThe accused\u2019s defence to the OM charge\n55 The accused\u2019s defence to the OM charge was a bare denial. The accused \ntestified that in the consultation room, V had complained of gastric pain and \nphlegm.144 The accused performed a routine check of V\u2019s blood pressure and \nher heart and lungs.145 He then asked her to proceed to the examination room.146 \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Wee Teong Boo[2019] SGHC 198\n17V lifted up her shirt and he told her that he would be performing an abdominal \nexamination. The accused proceeded to palpate her upper, middle, and lower \nabdominal areas.147 The accused maintained that he checked V\u2019s lower \nabdomen \u201cabove the pants line\u201d.\n56 The accused claimed the examination lasted for a couple of minutes.148 \nHe denied having asked V to remove her jeans, and claimed that he had never \ndone so before.149 The accused denied checking V\u2019s pelvic area or touching V\u2019s \nvaginal area.150\nThe accused\u2019s defence to the rape charge\n57 The accused denied raping V. He claimed that he had suspected that V \nhad pelvic inflammation disease (\u201cPID\u201d) and that he carried out an internal (ie, \nintravaginal) pelvic examination, with V\u2019s consent, in order to exclude PID.151 \nThe examination involved inserting two of his fingers into V\u2019s vagina.152\n58 The accused also claimed that he was suffering from erectile dysfunction \n(\u201cED\u201d) and that he could not have penetrated V in the manner described by her.\nThe accused\u2019s version of events at the clinic\n59 The accused testified that on 30 December 2015, consistent with his \nusual routine, he went home in the evening, showered, had dinner, went back to \nthe clinic at around 9.00pm and continued working. At around 11.30pm, he \npressed the queue numbers \u201c18\u201d and \u201c19\u201d on the controls, but no one came in. \nHe then pressed queue number \u201c20\u201d, which was V\u2019s queue number.153 V entered \nthe consultation room and sat down. The accused said he overheard (through \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Wee Teong Boo[2019] SGHC 198\n18the pigeon hole) the patients with queue numbers \u201c18\u201d and \u201c19\u201d complaining at \nthe reception counter that V had jumped queue.154\n60 During the consultation, V complained of gastric reflux, frequent \nurination, and a cough.155 The accused listened to her heart and lungs and told \nV that he would examine her abdomen.156 They proceeded to the examination \nroom and V lay down on the examination bed. V pulled up her t-shirt to expose \nher abdomen.157 The accused was standing on V\u2019s right.\n61 The accused told V he was going to examine her abdomen. As he \npressed the upper and middle areas of V\u2019s abdomen, the accused asked if there \nwas any pain or discomfort. She replied there was none.158 When he pressed her \nmiddle lower abdomen, V said there was slight discomfort. The accused then \npressed V\u2019s left lower abdomen above her shorts: V said there was \ndiscomfort.159 The accused then told V that the examination was over.160 The \naccused claimed that his initial diagnosis was that V\u2019s symptoms could possibly \nbe due to a urinary tract infection (\u201cUTI\u201d).161\n62 The accused claimed that at that moment, \u201cout of the blue\u201d, V told him \nthat her \u201cprivate part was itchy\u201d and that the itch had occurred recently.162 The \naccused claimed that the complaint of genital itchiness, together with the lower \nabdominal discomfort and frequent urination, caused him to be concerned that \nV might be suffering from PID which could lead to infertility in young women \nif it was not treated early.163 The accused then asked V whether she wanted him \nto do an examination and she agreed.164\n63 The accused asked V to pull down her shorts. When V pulled her shorts \nto her thigh level, she had to bend her knees. The accused shifted himself further \nto the right to conduct a visual examination. He claimed that as V\u2019s shorts and \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Wee Teong Boo[2019] SGHC 198\n19panties obstructed the view, he asked V to pull her shorts all the way down. V \nthen took off her shorts and panties by herself; the accused never touched \nthem.165\n64 The accused claimed that V\u2019s knees were bent and her legs were apart.166 \nHe observed slight redness around the vulva and a slight clear discharge on the \nright side of the lower vulva area.167 In light of these symptoms, he claimed that \nPID became a \u201cmuch more likely\u201d possibility. He then asked V if he could \nperform an internal pelvic examination to exclude PID and V agreed.168\n65 The accused placed his left hand on top of V\u2019s lower abdomen, his left \nforearm pressed against V\u2019s right thigh, and using his right hand, inserted first, \none finger, then a second finger into V\u2019s vagina.169 The accused claimed that he \ntold V what he was going to do before he inserted his fingers (index and middle \nfingers) and that V was calm and had no complaints.170 \n66 According to the accused, he inserted his fingers deep into V\u2019s vagina \ntowards the right pelvic area and pressed his left hand fingers downwards as he \nlifted his right hand fingers upwards. V said there was no pain or discomfort. \nHe then told her he was going to move to the middle of her lower abdomen and \nhe pulled out his fingers \u201ca little bit\u201d and pushed them deep towards the middle. \nWhen he pushed his left hand fingers downwards and lifted his right hand \nfingers upwards, V said there was slight discomfort. Next, the accused pulled \nout his fingers and moved towards the left pelvic area and repeated the test. V \nsaid there was slight discomfort.171 The accused told V that if the discomfort \ncontinued she should go to the hospital for a check-up. He then told her the \nexamination was over, and V got up while he was withdrawing his fingers.172\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Wee Teong Boo[2019] SGHC 198\n2067 The accused claimed that after he performed the internal examination, \nhe concluded that UTI and PID were both possibilities or \u201cquestion marks\u201d but \nthat lower genital infection was \u201cdefinite\u201d.173\n68 The accused turned back to the consultation room and washed his hands \nwith antibacterial soap. He sat down at the consultation table and began to write \ndown the medication that he was prescribing for V, but before he could finish, \nV came back to the consultation room and asked for medication to delay her \nmenstruation because she was making a trip to China.174 The accused claimed \nthat V was calm and relaxed when she returned to the consultation room, and \nwhen she left.175 The accused tended to another three patients or so and left his \nclinic at around 12.40am on 31 December 2015.176\n69 The accused admitted that he did not wear gloves or use any lubricant \nwhen he was carrying out the internal pelvic examination.177 He also admitted \nthat he did not offer V the option of having a chaperone present when he carried \nout the examination. The accused conceded that using gloves and lubricant, and \ngiving a female patient the option of a chaperone, were all basic requirements \nwhen a doctor performed an internal examination of a female patient.178 The \naccused claimed that it did not cross his mind to use gloves or lubricant because \nhe was \u201cfully concentrating\u201d on the task of trying to exclude PID and his mind \nwas in \u201cpure examination mode\u201d. It was also very late, and there were two angry \npatients outside, so \u201cthere was tension\u201d. He was trying to get a diagnosis and \nprovide treatment as soon as possible, and it did not cross his mind to put on \ngloves or use a lubricant.179\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Wee Teong Boo[2019] SGHC 198\n21Evidence of the accused\u2019s clinic assistants\n70 The accused\u2019s clinic assistants testified that V appeared calm and left \nthe clinic after collecting her medication.\nEvidence of ED\n71 On 5 January 2016, three days after the accused was released on bail, he \nconsulted his urologist, Dr Peter Lim Huat Chye (\u201cDr Peter Lim\u201d) with \ncomplaints of ED for the past three years. The accused informed Dr Peter Lim \nthat he was suffering from diabetes and hypertension and was on Diamicron and \nAtenolol\/Atacand respectively for these conditions. Dr Peter Lim performed a \ntransrectal ultrasound examination and an uroflowmetry examination. In \naddition, Dr Peter Lim ordered a bioavailable testosterone test and a colour \nDoppler ultrasonography for the accused. \n72 The transrectal ultrasound examination confirmed that the accused had \nan enlarged prostate gland. The uroflowmetry examination suggested a bladder \noutlet obstruction.\n73 The clinical laboratory report dated 5 January 2016 from Parkway \nLaboratory Services Limited showed that the accused\u2019s testosterone levels were \nin the low range of normality.180 \n74 On 13 January 2016, Dr Gan Yu Unn (\u201cDr Gan\u201d), a consultant \nradiologist at the Andrology, Urology & Continence Centre, carried out a \nDoppler ultrasonography after administering 10 micrograms of Caverject. In his \nreport dated 13 January 2016 (\u201cthe first Doppler report\u201d),181 Dr Gan concluded \nthat the Doppler ultrasonography showed no vasculogenic causes for the \naccused\u2019s ED but there were bilateral varicoceles present.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Wee Teong Boo[2019] SGHC 198\n2275 In his report dated 8 March 2016 (\u201cDr Peter Lim\u2019s report\u201d),182 Dr Peter \nLim gave a summary of the results of the transrectal ultrasound, the \nuroflowmetry examination, the Doppler ultrasonography and the testosterone \ntest. Dr Lim prescribed Duodart for the accused\u2019s prostate problem and bladder \nobstruction, and clomiphene citrate to treat the accused\u2019s low testosterone (ie, \nhypogonadism). Dr Peter Lim\u2019s report contained some typographical errors \nrelating to the accused\u2019s testosterone levels and he corrected these errors in a \nsubsequent report dated 14 June 2018.183 Nothing in this case turned on these \nerrors.\n76 The Doppler ultrasonography analyses penile blood flow. In simple \nterms, an erection is achieved when the corpora cavernosa (chambers of spongy \ntissue in the shaft of the penis) dilate and blood rushes in and fills the spaces. \nThe pressure of blood flow causes the sheath of tissue around the chambers to \npress on veins that normally drain blood out of the penis. This traps blood in the \npenis, maintaining the erection. When the excitement ends, the corpora \ncavernosa contracts, taking pressure off the veins and allowing blood to flow \nback out of the penis which then returns to a flaccid state.184 The Caverject \ninjection artificially induces an erection by causing the corpora cavernosa to \ndilate so that blood can rush in to fill the chambers.\n77 Arteriogenic ED describes the condition where not enough blood flows \ninto the corpora cavernosa. Venogenic ED (or venous leak) describes the \ncondition where the blood that flows into the chambers flows back out instead \nof staying trapped in the chambers. Both arteriogenic and venogenic causes are \ncollectively described as vasculogenic causes. Where the ED is due to low \ntestosterone levels, the cause is described as endocrine (ie, hormonal). \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Wee Teong Boo[2019] SGHC 198\n2378 On 22 March 2016, as requested by the police, the accused saw Dr Teo \nJin Kiat (\u201cDr Teo\u201d) in the urology outpatient clinic at the Changi General \nHospital (\u201cCGH\u201d). Dr Teo was given Dr Peter Lim\u2019s report together with the \nreports of the various tests done. Dr Teo did a physical examination of the \naccused but did not order any further tests. In his report dated 13 April 2016 \n(\u201cDr Teo\u2019s first report\u201d),185 Dr Teo relied on Dr Peter Lim\u2019s report and the \nreports of the various tests done.\n79 Subsequently, the police told Dr Teo that a second Doppler \nultrasonography was needed, and Dr Teo ordered one for the accused.186 On \n22 April 2016, the accused underwent a second penile Doppler ultrasonography \nwhich was administered by Dr Wong Kai Min (\u201cDr Wong\u201d), a Consultant at \nCGH. Similarly, a Caverject injection was administered.187 Dr Wong\u2019s report \n(\u201cthe second Doppler report\u201d) stated that:188\n(a) a full erection was not achieved and the accused\u2019s penile shaft \nwas \u201cflexible at best achieved erection\u201d; and\n(b) there was \u201cadequate arterial inflow on the right side\u201d but \n\u201cdecreased arterial inflow on the left side\u201d, and that the findings were \n\u201csuggestive of arterial insufficiency on the left side\u201d which could be a \n\u201ccontributory cause of vasculogenic erectile dysfunction\u201d. \nThe second Doppler report by Dr Wong was finalised by Dr Gervais Kin-Lin \nWansaicheong, a Visiting Consultant.\n80 Dr Teo issued a second report dated 4 May 2016 (\u201cDr Teo\u2019s second \nreport\u201d).189 The contents of this report were similar to those in Dr Teo\u2019s first \nreport except that it now reflected the results in the second Doppler report. \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Wee Teong Boo[2019] SGHC 198\n2481 On 7 June 2018, after his cross-examination had concluded, the accused \nunderwent a more advanced haemodynamic test for erectile function \nadministered by Dr Sriram Narayanan (\u201cDr Sriram\u201d). Dr Sriram was a Senior \nConsultant Vascular and Endovascular Surgeon at the Harley Street Heart and \nVascular Centre at Gleneagles Hospital and Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. \nHis specialty was in vascular and endovascular surgery. He was also the former \nHead of Vascular Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital. \n82 Dr Sriram explained that haemodynamics is the testing of blood flow \nvelocities and pressures in arteries and veins, and is more accurate than Doppler \nultrasonography. In Doppler ultrasonography, the doctor holds the observing \nprobe which sits transversely on the penis when measuring the penile blood \nflow. It is difficult to keep the probe stable and observer variation is intrinsic in \nthis procedure. Even if the same person performs the same test on the same \npatient a second time, the results may vary. In contrast, with haemodynamics, \nthere are no moving parts. The cuff (with sensors) is placed around the root of \nthe penis and is connected to a machine which takes the readings.\n83 Dr Sriram\u2019s report stated that:190 \n(a) the accused had significant bilateral venous leak, leading to \nvenogenic impotence and mild arteriogenic impotence; and\n(b) the accused only achieved an erectile hardness score (\u201cEHS\u201d) of \nGrade 1 tumescence 10 minutes after an injection of 20 micrograms of \nCaverject. There was no improvement at 20 minutes. \nDr Sriram explained that the standard dose is 10 micrograms of Caverject but \nhe used 20 micrograms for patients with a history of diabetes because 10 \nmicrograms would not produce very good results.191\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Wee Teong Boo[2019] SGHC 198\n2584 The EHS192 was developed to help describe the hardness of the penis \nwhile attempting sexual activity. It comprised the following four grades:\n(a) Grade 1: Penis is larger but not hard.\n(b) Grade 2: Penis is hard but not hard enough for penetration.\n(c) Grade 3: Penis is hard enough for penetration but not completely \nhard.\n(d) Grade 4: Penis is completely hard and fully rigid.\n85 Dr Sriram described the results in the first Doppler report as \u201cstrange\u201d \nfor the following reasons: \n(a) In his view, the results were that of a normal 16-year-old who \nhas varicoceles.193 Varicoceles refers to the enlargement of the veins \nwithin the scrotum. Dr Sriram testified that venogenic impotence and \nvaricoceles have a high association with each other, but he accepted that \nhe was not aware of any published evidence of any direct association.194 \n(b) The accused, being in his sixties at the material time, would be \nexpected to have some degree of ED even if he had no other disease. \n(c) The accused\u2019s diabetic condition was an \u201cextremely major \ninfluence\u201d on his ED; even diabetics who controlled their diabetes will \nhave some degree of ED.195 Based on the accused\u2019s diabetic screen \nresults dated 18 December 2013,196 the accused\u2019s diabetes was \u201cpretty \nbadly controlled\u201d and any subsequent improvement in controlling his \ndiabetes would not improve his ED.197\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Wee Teong Boo[2019] SGHC 198\n26(d) The accused was suffering from hypertension. Persistent \nhypertension causes hardening of the arteries and that prevents the \narteries from dilating the way they are supposed to.198 As a result, not \nenough blood flows into the penis to achieve an erection.\n(e) The accused was also taking a beta-blocker called Bisoprolol for \nhis hypertension. Most beta-blockers, including Bisoprolol, cause ED. \nAccording to Dr Peter Lim\u2019s report, the accused was already on Atenolol \n(another beta-blocker) when he consulted Dr Peter Lim in January 2016. \nThe effects of Atenolol on ED were worse than those of Bisoprolol.199\n(f) The accused was also shown to have testosterone levels in the \nlow-normal range, which would have added to his ED.200\n86 Dr Sriram was of the view that the second Doppler report was \u201cfar more \nin tune\u201d with the accused\u2019s actual condition.201 Dr Sriram was also of the view \nthat the second Doppler report was consistent with his findings based on the \nhaemodynamic test in June 2018, and that the results in June 2018 showed a \n\u201cprogression of the disease\u201d.202 Dr Sriram\u2019s view was that, given the accused\u2019s \nhistory of poorly controlled diabetes in 2013 and the fact that he had been on \nmedication for hypertension, the accused\u2019s condition as shown in the second \nDoppler report would have existed well before April 2016.203 \n87 Dr Teo agreed that there was an association between varicoceles and ED \nbut there was no evidence of any causation.204 Dr Teo also agreed that diabetes \nand hypertension contributed to vasculogenic ED, and that beta-blockers could \n(but did not always) lead to ED.205 Dr Teo further agreed that diabetes alone can \nbe a serious factor for ED.206 However, unlike Dr Sriram, Dr Teo did not find \nthe first Doppler report strange despite the accused\u2019s medical history. Dr Teo \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Wee Teong Boo[2019] SGHC 198\n27testified that it was possible that someone of the accused\u2019s age and with his \nconditions could have a \u201cperfect score\u201d with the Doppler ultrasonography.207 \n88 According to Dr Teo, one possible reason for the discrepancies between \nthe first and second Doppler ultrasonography results was inter-observer \nvariation in performing Doppler ultrasonography.208 However, Dr Teo was of \nthe view that the insufficiency in the blood flow (which was detected in the \nsecond Doppler ultrasonography in April 2016) was quite unlikely to have \nhappened in the short span of four months since the first Doppler \nultrasonography in January 2016, and that blockage of the vessels takes place \nover a long period.209\n89 Ultimately, Dr Teo confirmed that he had doubts over both the first and \nsecond Doppler reports, and that both were possible. Dr Teo could not be sure \nwhich was more accurate.210\n90 The accused testified that he suffered from ED for more than a year \nbefore his arrest and had low sex drive, but that he was able to have sex with his \nwife \u201conce or twice a month\u201d and was able to have penetrative sexual \nintercourse \u201cmost of the time\u201d.211 The accused informed Dr Teo in March 2016 \nthat he had difficulty initiating and sustaining penile erections and that his last \npenetrative sexual intercourse was in January 2016.212\n91 However, the accused did not mention that he was suffering from ED \nwhen his statement was recorded on 31 December 2015.213 In his statement \nrecorded on 1 January 2016, the accused answered \u201cno\u201d when he was asked \nwhether he was suffering from ED.214 On the stand, the accused claimed that \nED did not cross his mind during the statement recording because it did not \nbother him then.215\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Wee Teong Boo[2019] SGHC 198\n2892 The accused\u2019s wife testified that in 2014, she noticed a decrease in the \nhardness of the accused\u2019s erection and that in 2015, his penis was \u201csoft like a \nnoodle\u201d and he would need to use his hand to guide his penis into the vagina.216 \nFurther, the accused was not able to achieve an erection on every occasion.217 \nFindings on rape charge\n93 I deal first with the rape charge as it was the first charge. \n94 The Prosecution submitted that the accused had deliberately skipped the \npatients with queue numbers \u201c18\u201d and \u201c19\u201d because he had seen V\u2019s patient \ncard and knew that her queue number was \u201c20\u201d. According to the Prosecution, \nthis showed premeditation. I rejected the Prosecution\u2019s submission. In my view, \nit was highly unlikely the accused would have done this and risked upsetting \ntwo other patients. It was more logical and likely that if there was premeditation, \nthe accused would have called V last, after all the other patients had been \nattended to.\n95 V and the accused were the only persons who knew what really \nhappened in the examination room on the night in question. It was her word \nagainst his. It is well-established that a complainant\u2019s testimony alone can \nconstitute proof beyond reasonable doubt but only when it is so \u201cunusually \nconvincing\u201d as to overcome any doubts that might arise from the lack of \ncorroboration. The need for \u201cfine-tooth comb\u201d scrutiny is particularly acute \nwhere allegations of sexual abuse are concerned. A witness\u2019 testimony may only \nbe found to be \u201cunusually convincing\u201d by weighing the demeanour of the \nwitness alongside both the internal and external consistencies found in the \nwitness\u2019 testimony. See AOF v Public Prosecutor [2012] 3 SLR 34 (\u201cAOF\u201d) at \n[111]\u2013[115].\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Wee Teong Boo[2019] SGHC 198\n2996 It also bears noting that the requirement of \u201cunusually convincing\u201d \nevidence does not impose a higher standard of proof. The standard of proof \nremains that of proof beyond a reasonable doubt: AOF at [113].\n97 V impressed me as an honest although somewhat simple girl. She gave \nher evidence simply, clearly and without embellishment. Her testimony as to \nthe events on 30\/31 December 2015 was consistent with the fact that her mother \nfound her tossing around in her bed at around 4.30am on 31 December 2015, \nand with what she told her mother. It was also consistent with her report to the \npolice and the medical examination by Dr Tung, both of which took place later \nthat morning. \n98 The accused submitted that V\u2019s behaviour immediately after the alleged \nrape \u201cclearly confounds the rational mind\u201d. However, it is well established that \nvictims of sexual assault should not be expected to react in a stereotypical way \nor to conform to a standard behavioural template: Public Prosecutor v Yue \nRoger Jr [2019] 3 SLR 749 at [30]; Public Prosecutor v BDA [2018] SGHC 72 \nat [39]. I accepted V\u2019s evidence that she was in shock and on \u201cauto-pilot\u201d mode. \nHer evidence in this regard found support in the fact that she did not even notice \nthat one of the medicines prescribed to her was ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic that \nV was allergic to.\nWhether the accused was suffering from ED\n99 The Prosecution relied on (a) the first Doppler report, (b) the accused\u2019s \ntestimony in court that he was able to have penetrative sexual intercourse with \nhis wife, (c) the accused\u2019s account to Dr Teo that his last penetrative sexual \nintercourse was in January 2016, and (d) the fact that the accused said he was \nnot suffering from ED in his 1 January 2016 statement. \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Wee Teong Boo[2019] SGHC 198\n30100 The results of the first Doppler ultrasonography were significantly \ndifferent from those of the second, although both were carried out within a \nperiod of less than four months. The second Doppler ultrasonography in April \n2016 confirmed that the accused was suffering from ED and could not achieve \nfull erection despite the administration of Caverject. The accused\u2019s penile shaft \nwas found to be flexible at best-achieved erection. Dr Wong, who performed \nthe second Doppler ultrasonography, did not testify. Dr Teo testified that he \nspoke to Dr Wong and Dr Wong told him that the accused\u2019s erection was \u201cat \nbest\u201d Grade 3 on the EHS.218 That was hearsay evidence. In any event, the \nassessment of Grade 3 was not helpful as it simply reflected the best case.\n101 There was simply no clear explanation for the discrepancies between the \nresults of the first and second Doppler ultrasonography procedures. The doctors \nwho carried out the procedures did not testify at the trial. However, the \naccused\u2019s expert witness, Dr Sriram, was clear in his opinion that the second \nDoppler report was more in tune with the accused\u2019s medical condition than the \nfirst Doppler report, and that the accused\u2019s condition as shown in the second \nDoppler report would have existed well before April 2016. The second Doppler \nreport was also consistent with Dr Sriram\u2019s findings based on the \nhaemodynamic test in that the latter showed a progression of the disease. I found \nDr Sriram\u2019s testimony to be objective and persuasive. \n102 The Prosecution\u2019s expert, Dr Teo, also agreed that the accused\u2019s \ncondition as shown in the second Doppler report was unlikely to have happened \nin the short span of four months since the first Doppler report. Although he did \nnot find the results of the first Doppler report to be strange, ultimately, he \naccepted that the results in the first and second Doppler reports were both \npossible. Dr Teo could not say which was more accurate.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Wee Teong Boo[2019] SGHC 198\n31103 As for the accused\u2019s evidence, although he said he had penetrative \nsexual intercourse with his wife, he also said that he had difficulty initiating and \nsustaining penile erections. Suffering from ED did not necessarily mean that he \nwas incapable of penetrative sexual intercourse. However, as his wife testified, \nhe needed to use his hand to guide his penis into the vagina. \n104 In the final analysis, in my view, the evidence (in particular, the \nobjective medical evidence) clearly established, on a balance of probabilities, \nthat the accused was suffering from ED in December 2015.\nWhether there was penile penetration\n105 As stated earlier, the fact that the accused was suffering from ED did not \nnecessarily mean that he could not have penetrative sexual intercourse. The next \nquestion therefore was whether the Prosecution had proved penile penetration \nbeyond a reasonable doubt. \n106 The allegation against the accused was that his hands were holding V\u2019s \nlegs when V felt something \u201cpoking into her vagina\u201d.219 In other words, penile \npenetration was achieved without any external aid, such as using his hand to \nguide his penis into the vagina. In light of the evidence as to the accused\u2019s ED, \nI was satisfied that there was a reasonable doubt as to whether penile penetration \ncould have taken place as alleged in this case. \n107  In addition, at the material time, the accused\u2019s clinic assistants were \npresent in the clinic and there were other patients waiting in the clinic. These \nfacts threw further doubt as to whether the accused would have attempted penile \npenetration. Further, Dr Tung agreed that the injuries on V\u2019s fourchette and \nhymen were equally consistent with digital penetration (see [ 44] above).\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Wee Teong Boo[2019] SGHC 198\n32108 In my judgment, the Prosecution had not proved, beyond a reasonable \ndoubt, that penile penetration took place in the manner described by V. \nAccordingly, I acquitted the accused on the rape charge.\nOffence of sexual assault by penetration\n109 Section 376(2)(a) of the Penal Code provides as follows:\n376.\u2014\n\u2026\n(2)  Any person (A) who \u2014\n(a) sexually penetrates, with a part of A\u2019s body (other than \nA\u2019s penis) or anything else, the vagina or anus, as the \ncase may be of another person (B);\n\u2026\nshall be guilty of an offence if B did not consent to the \npenetration.\n110 In the present case, by the accused\u2019s own admission, he had penetrated \nV\u2019s vagina with his fingers. This constituted an offence under s 376(2)(a) if:\n(a) the digital penetration was sexual; and \n(b) V did not consent to the penetration.\nWhether the digital penetration was sexual\n111 Section 377C(d) provides as follows:\nInterpretation of sections 375 to 377B (sexual offences)\n377C.  In sections 375 to 377B \u2014\n\u2026\n(d)  penetration, touching or other activity is \u201csexual\u201d if \u2014\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Wee Teong Boo[2019] SGHC 198\n33(i) because of its nature it is sexual, whatever its \ncircumstances or any person\u2019s purpose in relation to it \nmay be; or\n(ii) because of its nature it may be sexual and because of \nits circumstances or the purpose of any person in \nrelation to it (or both) it is sexual;\n\u2026\n112 The relevant provision in the present case was s 377C(d)(ii). This was \nclear from the Explanatory Statement to the Penal Code (Amendment) Bill (No \n38 of 2007) which introduced s 377C. As explained in the Explanatory \nStatement:\nThe second limb (section 377C(d)(ii)) deals with the case where \nobjectively the nature of an activity is simply capable of being \n(i.e. may or may not be) sexual. Examples of such a case would \nbe inserting a finger into a woman\u2019s vagina or a person\u2019s anus \nor where someone removes another person\u2019s clothes, or where \nsomeone touches the genital organs of himself or another \nperson, or kisses another person, or strokes another person\u2019s \nthigh (whether clad or not). The second limb states that the \nquestion is whether a reasonable person would consider that \nbecause of its nature the act may be sexual and because of the \ncircumstances of the activity or any person\u2019s purpose in relation \nto it (not just the person who does the act, but also, for example, \nsomeone who encourages the act to be done), or both, the \nactivity is sexual.\nFor example, a reasonable person would consider that touching \nof a woman\u2019s genitals may, because of its nature, be sexual, and \nwould consider that such touching for sexual gratification is \nsexual in the light of the purpose with which the touching is \ndone. On the other hand, a reasonable person would not \nconsider that touching a woman\u2019s genitals is sexual if it is \nperformed by a gynaecologist who is conducting a bona fide \nmedical examination.\n113 It was clear that the accused\u2019s digital penetration of V\u2019s vagina would \nbe considered sexual in nature unless there was a legitimate reason for the \npenetration. The accused claimed that he inserted his fingers into V\u2019s vagina \nbecause he was conducting an internal pelvic examination. \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Wee Teong Boo[2019] SGHC 198\n34Whether the accused was conducting an internal pelvic examination\n114 The accused claimed that he conducted an internal pelvic examination \nin order to exclude the possibility that V was suffering from PID.220 I rejected \nthe accused\u2019s claim. \n115 First, the accused agreed that a patient\u2019s case note was important \nbecause it contained information about the patient\u2019s complaints, the \nexaminations conducted, the significant findings and the treatment.221 The \naccused also agreed that his diagnosis of possible PID was a significant \nfinding.222 However, there was no mention of either PID or the internal pelvic \nexamination in V\u2019s case note for the consultation on 30 December 2015.223\n116 The accused claimed that the case note was \u201cobviously incomplete\u201d224 \nand that he did not complete the case note because he was distracted by V when \nshe suddenly asked for medication for her upcoming trip to China, it was quite \nlate and he had two impatient patients outside.225 He claimed that he intended \nto complete the case note the next day.226 \n117 I rejected the accused\u2019s claims. \n(a) It was easy for him to write down the examinations that he had \ncarried out and his findings. Doing so would not have taken him any \nsignificant amount of time. \n(b) His actions contradicted his claim that he intended to complete \nthe case note the next day. The accused had simply handed the case note \nto his clinic assistants; he did not tell them that the case note was \nincomplete and that he intended to complete it the next day. In fact, the \ncase note was stored away in a box in the examination room. The \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Wee Teong Boo[2019] SGHC 198\n35accused retrieved the case note from the box when the police went to the \nclinic the next day (31 December 2015).227 Despite having personally \nretrieved it, the accused did not inform the police that the case note was \nincomplete when he handed it to the police on the morning of 31 \nDecember 2015 or when the police returned to the clinic in the afternoon \nthat day.228 \n118 There was no reason why the case note had no reference to PID or the \ninternal pelvic examination if the accused\u2019s claims (that he suspected PID and \nconducted such an examination to exclude the possibility of PID) were true.\n119 Second, there was also absolutely no mention of PID in the accused\u2019s \nstatements to the police recorded on 31 December 2015 and 1 January 2016.229 \nThe accused\u2019s only explanation was that it did not cross his mind to do so and \nthat the allegation of rape was the only thing on his mind.230 I rejected the \naccused\u2019s explanation. As the Prosecution had pointed out, the accused was not \nsimply denying the allegation of rape in his statement, he was explaining his \nversion of the events in the course of making his denial. It was unbelievable that \nhe would not have mentioned PID if it were true that he had suspected PID.\n120 Third, the accused admitted that he did not wear gloves or use a lubricant \nwhen conducting the alleged internal pelvic examination. It was not disputed \nthat these were basic requirements when conducting an internal pelvic \nexamination. Neither did he ask if V wanted a chaperone present. Again, it was \nnot disputed that this was a basic requirement in the case of a female patient. \nThe accused claimed that normally, the question of a pelvic examination would \nhave arisen in the consultation room and if he thought he needed to do one, he \nwould have gotten his gloves, used antibacterial soap as a lubricant and asked \nthe female patient whether she wanted a chaperone.231 However, V\u2019s complaint \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Wee Teong Boo[2019] SGHC 198\n36that her private part was itchy came \u201cout of the blue\u201d in the examination room \nand it had caught him \u201coff guard\u201d; his mind was in \u201cpure examination mode\u201d \nand he just wanted to \u201cfinish his examination as soon as possible because there \nwere still patients outside\u201d.232 \n121 I rejected the accused\u2019s claim. \n(a) The accused was a very experienced doctor with 37 years\u2019 \nexperience under his belt at the material time. By his own admission, he \nran a busy clinic and his usual hours were late into the night.233 I did not \nbelieve that he could have been so easily flustered as to forget the three \nbasic requirements. I noted as well that his composure under cross-\nexamination also showed that he was not easily flustered. \n(b) The accused gave three different answers about whether he used \na lubricant. In his statement to the police recorded on 31 December \n2015, he said that he used his saliva as lubricant and that he put two \nfingers near his mouth and let the saliva drip onto his fingers.234 When \nasked during examination-in-chief whether he used a lubricant, he first \nsaid that V\u2019s bodily discharge around her vulva \u201cwill be a lubricant in a \nway\u201d but then went on to say that he did not use a lubricant because it \nhad not crossed his mind to do so.235 Under cross-examination, the \naccused claimed that his statement to the police was the correct \nversion.236 In my view, the three inconsistent answers showed that the \naccused\u2019s explanations as to why he did not use a lubricant were \nfabrications. \n(c) If the accused used his saliva as lubricant, that meant that he was \nconscious of the need to use a lubricant. Yet he did not do so and could \nnot explain why he used his saliva instead.237 \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Wee Teong Boo[2019] SGHC 198\n37(d) If the accused placed his fingers near his mouth and let his saliva \ndrip onto his fingers, there was no reason why he would not have noticed \nthat he was not wearing gloves.\n122 In my view, there was no credible reason why the accused did not wear \ngloves, use a lubricant or ask if V wanted to have a chaperone present. The only \ninference left to be drawn was that he did not intend to and was not in fact \nconducting an internal pelvic examination. \n123 Fourth, Dr Tung\u2019s evidence was as follows:\n(a) The possible causes for V\u2019s complaints of frequent urination and \nitch at her private parts, were UTI or LGTI.238 Bacterial vaginosis and \ncandida were both causes of LGTI.239\n(b) A sexual history from the patient would be crucial. In the case of \na non-sexually active woman, her priority would be to rule out UTI or \nLGTI.240 In the case of a sexually active woman, she would consider an \nascending genital tract infection that includes PID.241\n(c) PID was rare in non-sexually active women and literature \nsuggested a less than one per cent possibility.242 She would not have \nproceeded to investigate PID as a cause without bothering to ascertain \nthe patient\u2019s sexual history.243 In the rare case that PID was suspected in \nthe case of a non-sexually active woman, there was usually an \nunderlying abnormality such as an ovarian tumour, which would show \nup on ultrasound.244\n124 The accused agreed that V\u2019s symptoms were equally consistent with \nUTI and LGTI.245 He also agreed that PID in non-sexually active women was \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Wee Teong Boo[2019] SGHC 198\n38rare.246 Yet, according to him, he proceeded to investigate PID as a cause \nwithout asking V for her sexual history . The accused\u2019s explanation for not \nhaving done so was that it was his practice to ask his patient for her sexual \nhistory when she was seated in the consultation room and not while she was \nlying on the examination bed with her abdomen exposed.247 I found his \nexplanation too incredulous to believe. There was no reason why the accused \ncould not have asked for V\u2019s sexual history just because V was lying on the \nexamination bed. Both of them were still in the medical clinic and the setting \nwas still that of a patient who was consulting her doctor.\n125 The invasive internal pelvic examination was not necessary in the case \nof UTI and LGTI. It was therefore all the more important that the accused asked \nV for her sexual history before proceeding to investigate PID using a very \ninvasive procedure. In my view, the accused did not ask V for her sexual history \nbecause he did not in fact suspect PID.\n126 Fifth, Dr Tung testified that an investigation for PID would not start with \nan internal pelvic examination. In the case of a non-sexually active woman, the \ninvestigation first would involve taking swabs without using a speculum and \nperforming a trans-abdominal ultrasound.248 If ultrasound facilities were not \navailable, she would refer the patient to a specialist who had one.249 \n127 The accused agreed with Dr Tung.250 His explanations for proceeding \nwith the internal pelvic examination were that:\n(a) his clinic did not have the facilities for the trans-abdominal \nultrasound;251\n(b) he had not done a vaginal swab before;252\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Wee Teong Boo[2019] SGHC 198\n39(c) the steps mentioned by Dr Tung would be carried out in a \nhospital but not by a general practitioner in the HDB heartlands;253 and\n(d) his training from 40 years ago was still relevant for a general \npractitioner in the HDB heartlands.254\n128 I did not accept the accused\u2019s explanations. I found it incredible that as \nan experienced doctor, he would have proceeded with an internal pelvic \nexamination under these circumstances. Under cross-examination, the accused \nsaid that \u201cHDB patients \u2026 are very reluctant to go to hospital because of \nexpenses\u201d.255 However, what was important was that he did not give V the \noption of going for less invasive tests in a hospital. In my view, the accused did \nnot ask V whether she would prefer to go for less invasive tests in a hospital \nbecause he did not in fact suspect PID and was not carrying out an internal \npelvic examination.\n129 Sixth, the accused\u2019s own testimony as to why he carried out the internal \npelvic examination, was inconsistent. He first claimed that the examination was \nto exclude PID.256 However, he subsequently agreed that the examination could \nnot confirm whether it was or was not PID.257 The accused then claimed that the \ninternal pelvic examination was to exclude more serious PID.258 Yet, earlier in \nhis testimony, he had only diagnosed \u201cearly pelvic inflammation\u201d as a \npossibility.259 The accused also agreed that the examination could not exclude \nPID altogether.260 The accused took no further steps to confirm whether V was \nor was not suffering from PID, which was odd in the light of the accused\u2019s \npurported concern that PID could lead to infertility in young women if it was \nnot treated early (see [ 62] above).\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Wee Teong Boo[2019] SGHC 198\n40130 In my view, the inconsistencies showed that the accused\u2019s claim that he \nconducted an internal pelvic examination was an after-thought. He did not in \nfact have any reason to conduct the examination.\n131 Seventh, the accused had prescribed ciprofloxacin for V. He claimed \nthat this was for UTI and PID.261 This was strange since on his own evidence, \nhe had not confirmed that V had PID. Further, Dr Tung agreed that ciprofloxacin \ncould be used to treat UTI.262 However, she testified that she would not \nprescribe ciprofloxacin for PID because the infections that are commonly \nassociated with PID are notoriously resistant to ciprofloxacin.263 The accused\u2019s \nresponse in court was that he could not comment on that.264 The accused \naccepted that ciprofloxacin may not be fully effective and claimed that he did \nnot know how effective it was compared to other drugs \u201cbecause [he was] not \n[an] expert in those areas\u201d.265 Under further cross-examination, the accused \nagreed that he was not even sure that ciprofloxacin was the right medication for \nPID.266 \n132 In my view, the evidence showed that the accused prescribed \nciprofloxacin for UTI but not PID. In turn, this showed that he did not suspect \nthat V was suffering from PID.\n133 Eighth, the accused claimed that he noticed slight redness and discharge \naround V\u2019s vulva and that this was significant because, in his view, PID became \n\u201cmuch more likely\u201d.267 However, Dr Tung was clear that there was no redness \nwhen she examined V on the afternoon of 31 December 2015.268\n134 For all of the above reasons, I was left in no doubt that, on the night in \nquestion, the accused did not in fact suspect that V might be suffering from PID \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Wee Teong Boo[2019] SGHC 198\n41and he did not in fact conduct an internal pelvic examination on V. In my \njudgment, the accused was not a credible witness. \nThe digital penetration was sexual\n135 Accordingly, I concluded that the accused had sexually penetrated V\u2019s \nvagina with his fingers on the night in question. \nWhether there was consent\n136 V denied that the accused told her that he was going to conduct an \ninternal pelvic examination to exclude pelvic inflammation or that she \nconsented to his insertion of his fingers into her vagina.269 I believed her. \n137 I rejected the accused\u2019s claim that he asked for and obtained V\u2019s consent \nto insert his fingers into her vagina. The accused\u2019s claims that he suspected PID, \nand that he conducted an internal pelvic examination, were afterthoughts. There \nwas no reason for me to believe that he asked V for her consent to an internal \npelvic examination. I also noted that the accused\u2019s statements to the police were \ninconsistent on the matter of consent. In his 31 December 2015 statement, he \nclaimed to have checked with V if she \u201cwas okay\u201d during the entire alleged \ninternal pelvic examination.270 However, in his 1 January 2016 statement, the \naccused said that he did not specifically tell V that he was inserting his fingers \ninto her vagina as part of the alleged internal pelvic examination.271\n138 In my judgment, the accused did not ask V for her consent to conduct an \ninternal pelvic examination.\n139 In any event, even if the accused did ask V for her consent to conduct an \ninternal pelvic examination, and even if V did consent, her consent would have \nbeen given under a misconception that the accused was truly conducting an \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Wee Teong Boo[2019] SGHC 198\n42internal pelvic examination, and the accused clearly knew that the consent was \ngiven in consequence of such misconception. Such a consent would not have \nbeen valid: s 90(a)(ii) of the Penal Code.\nConviction on the offence of sexual assault by penetration\n140 I concluded that sometime between 11.30pm on 30 December 2015 and \n12.30am on 31 December 2015, at his clinic, the accused did sexually penetrate \nV\u2019s vagina with his fingers, without V\u2019s consent. The accused had therefore \ncommitted the offence of sexual assault by penetration under s 376(2)(a) and \npunishable under s 376(3) of the Penal Code. \n141 I had acquitted the accused on the rape charge. The Prosecution had not \nproceeded with an alternative charge under s 376(2)(a) of the Penal Code. \n142 As stated at [ 5] above, I exercised my powers under s 139 of the CPC \nand convicted the accused of the offence of sexual assault by penetration under \ns 376(2)(a) of the Penal Code.\n143 Section 139 of the CPC gives the court the power to convict an accused \nperson of an offence that he is shown to have committed although he was not \ncharged with it. Section 139 provides as follows:\nWhen person charged with one offence can be convicted of \nanother\n139. If in the case mentioned in section 138 the accused is \ncharged with one offence and it appears in evidence that he \ncommitted a different offence for which he might have been \ncharged under that section, he may be convicted of the offence \nthat he is shown to have committed although he was not \ncharged with it.\nIllustration\nA is charged with theft. In evidence it appears that he \ncommitted the offence of criminal breach of trust or receiving \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Wee Teong Boo[2019] SGHC 198\n43stolen goods. He may be convicted of criminal breach of trust \nor of receiving stolen goods, as the case may be, although he \nwas not charged with that offence.\n144 The power under s 139 of the CPC may not be exercised unless:\n(a) the accused could have been charged with the offence that he is \nto be convicted on, under s 138. This is an express requirement under \ns 138; and\n(b) the accused must not be prejudiced or embarrassed in his defence \nin any way: The Criminal Procedure Code of Singapore: Annotations \nand Commentary (Academy Publishing, 2012) (\u201cCPC Commentary\u201d) at \npara 07.128.\nWhether the case fell within the scope of s 138 of the CPC \n145 Sections 138 of the CPC provides as follows:\nIf it is doubtful what offence has been committed\n138. If a single act or series of acts is such that it is doubtful \nwhich of several offences the provable facts will constitute, the \naccused may be charged with all or any of those offences and \nany number of the charges may be tried at once, or he may be \ncharged in the alternative with any one of those offences.\nIllustrations\n(a) A is accused of an act that may amount to theft or \nreceiving stolen property or criminal breach of trust or cheating. \nHe may be charged with theft, receiving stolen property, \ncriminal breach of trust and cheating, or he may be charged \nwith having committed theft or receiving stolen property or \ncriminal breach of trust or cheating.\n(b)A states on oath before the committing Magistrate that \nhe saw B hit C with a club. Before the High Court, A states on \noath that B never hit C. A may be charged in the alternative and \nconvicted of intentionally giving false evidence although it \ncannot be proved which of these contradictory statements was \nfalse.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Wee Teong Boo[2019] SGHC 198\n44146 Section 138 applies to cases in which \u201cit is doubtful which of several \noffences the provable facts will constitute\u201d. The commentary at para 07.121 of \nthe CPC Commentary cites R v Tay Thye Joo [1933] MLJ 35 (\u201cTay Thye Joo\u201d) \nas authority for the proposition that s 138 only applies when it is doubtful what \noffences the facts prove, not when it is doubtful as to what facts can be proved. \nHowever, Tay Thye Joo does not support this proposition.\n147Tay Thye Joo concerned s 172 of the Criminal Procedure Code that was \nthen in force. For all intents and purposes, that section is identical to the present \ns 138. The proposition stated in the CPC Commentary in fact reflects the \nargument that was made by counsel for the appellant\/accused. The court in Tay \nThye Joo expressly rejected that argument. Terrell J held that \u201c\u2026 s 172 means \nwhat it says, namely that it is doubtful what facts can be proved. Until they can \nbe proved it is difficult to say what offence has been committed \u2026\u201d. This must \nbe correct. Section 138 provides for the framing of alternative charges. There is \nno reason why it should not apply where it is doubtful what facts can be proved \nand the offence that has been committed depends on what facts can be proved. \nIn the present case, there is no reason why the accused could not have been \ncharged for rape, and in the alternative, sexual assault by penetration.\n148 In my view, the present case fell within the scope of s 138 and \naccordingly, s 139 was engaged. \nWhether the accused was prejudiced\n149 Section 139 permits the court to convict an accused of an offence that \nhe was not charged with, if the evidence shows that he had committed the \noffence. Justice dictates that the accused should have had the same opportunity \nto defend himself as he would have had if he had been charged with that offence. \nIn other words, before exercising its power under s 139, the court must be \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Wee Teong Boo[2019] SGHC 198\n45satisfied that the evidence for the defence in respect of the offence (for which \nhe is to be convicted on) would have been the same as that which was adduced \nduring the trial. \n150 In the instant case, the accused had admitted that he had penetrated V\u2019s \nvagina with his fingers. His case was that he had done so because he was \nconducting an internal pelvic examination to exclude PID. The accused gave a \nfull explanation as to why he suspected that V was suffering from PID, how the \nissue came up, why he decided to conduct an internal pelvic examination, how \nhe obtained V\u2019s consent, how he conducted the examination, why he did not use \ngloves, or lubricant and why he did not offer V the option of having a chaperone \npresent. He was also cross-examined extensively on these matters.\n151 During oral closing submissions, I also asked the Prosecution and \ncounsel for the accused, what the position would be if I came to the conclusion \nthat the rape charge was not made out and I rejected the accused\u2019s claims that \nhe was conducting an internal pelvic examination. Both of them made \nsubmissions; no new issue was raised.272 Counsel for the accused did not ask to \ncall any further witnesses or to recall any witnesses. \n152 It was clear that the accused\u2019s defence would not have been conducted \nany differently had he been charged with sexual assault by penetration under \ns 376(2)(a) of the Penal Code. I was therefore satisfied that convicting him \nunder s 376(2)(a) in this case would not prejudice him in any way. Accordingly, \nI convicted the accused on the offence of sexual assault by penetration under \ns 376(2)(a).\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Wee Teong Boo[2019] SGHC 198\n46Sections 128\u2013131 of the CPC\n153 After I had convicted the accused, but before I heard oral submissions \non sentence, the Prosecution drew my attention to ss 128\u2013131 of the CPC, and \nexpressed the view that these sections \u201cwould have applied to the amendment \nof the charge\u201d against the accused.273 However, the Prosecution had \nmisunderstood the basis upon which I had convicted the accused of the s \n376(2)(a) offence. Sections 128\u2013131 of the CPC were irrelevant as I had not \namended the rape charge against the accused. I had acquitted the accused on the \nrape charge and exercised my powers under s 139 of the CPC to convict him on \nthe offence of sexual assault by penetration under s 376(2)(a) of the Penal Code. \nSection 139 of the CPC permits the court to convict an accused on an offence \nthat he had not been charged with. Section 139 does not involve or require any \namendment to the existing charge.\nFindings on the OM charge\n154 The accused argued that if the accused had outraged her modesty on \n25 November 2015, then it was \u201chighly incongruous\u201d that V would return to \nconsult the accused at his clinic on 30 December 2015. As stated earlier, V \nexplained that while she found the accused\u2019s actions \u201cweird\u201d and she felt \n\u201cuneasy\u201d, she had assumed that these actions were part of the medical \nexamination because she trusted the accused as her doctor.274 Further, the \naccused had told her that there was a lump.275\n155 The accused\u2019s statement that there was a lump was confirmed by \nDr Sheena who examined V at the polyclinic in Bedok on 5 December 2015.276 \nBy the time of trial, Dr Sheena was no longer working for the polyclinic, and \nhad left Singapore on 13 March 2018. The police were unable to contact her277 \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Wee Teong Boo[2019] SGHC 198\n47for the purposes of testifying. A computer printout of Dr Sheena\u2019s clinical notes \nwas produced in court.278 These notes showed that V had complained of \u201cleft \ngroin area pain for 3 days\u201d and that Dr Sheena\u2019s examination confirmed that V \nhad a \u201cleft enlarged inguinal lymph node\u201d. Dr Sheena\u2019s finding reassured V that \nwhat had happened to her on 25 November 2015 was part of a medical \nexamination.279 I believed V\u2019s testimony that she had thought that the accused\u2019s \nactions on 25 November 2015 were part of a medical examination.\n156 I accepted V\u2019s testimony that she only realised on 31 December 2015 \nthat what had happened on 25 November 2015 was not a medical examination, \nafter she thought about the events on 25 November 2015 and 30 December \n2015.280 V related the 25 November 2015 incident to the police officer who \ninterviewed her 1 January 2016.281 \n157 I found V\u2019s testimony to be compelling and believable. As mentioned \nearlier, V impressed me as an honest although somewhat simple girl. She gave \nher evidence simply, clearly and without embellishment. \n158 As I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proven its case beyond a \nreasonable doubt, I convicted the accused on the OM charge.\nSentence \n159 In this case, the offence under s 376(2)(a) was punishable with \nimprisonment for a term which may extend to 20 years, and was also liable to \nfine or to caning: s 376(3) of the Penal Code. \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Wee Teong Boo[2019] SGHC 198\n48160 In Pram Nair v Public Prosecutor [2017] 2 SLR 1015 (\u201cPram Nair\u201d), \nthe Court of"}

{"casename":"2019_SGHC_2","fact":"'10\\u2003I elaborate on the electricity market based on the undisputed background information from the closing submissions of SE and YTL dated 28 February 2018.', '11\\u2003NEMS commenced operations in 2003 and is where electricity is bought and sold in Singapore. NEMS is operated by the Energy Market Company and regulated by the Energy Market Authority.', '12\\u2003Electricity generators, such as YTL, can only sell electricity to NEMS. In the current market, electricity generators are not allowed to sell electricity that they generate directly to end-users, ie, consumers.', '13\\u2003The price of the electricity that is sold to NEMS is the Uniform Singapore Energy Price (\u201cUSEP\u201d). USEP is based on the weighted average of all the nodal prices of nodes at which electricity is deemed to be withdrawn. 3', 'It is determined every 30 minutes by a computer model, known as the \u201cMarket Clearing Engine\u201d (\u201cMCE\u201d). 4', 'Electricity generators may submit bids every 30 minutes in \u201cprice-quantity\u201d pairs, meaning they will indicate:', '(a)\\u2003how much electricity they are willing and able to supply to NEMS; and', '(b)\\u2003the price they wish to charge for such quantity of electricity. 5', '14\\u2003 MCE will then collate all the bids submitted by the generation companies and map them against the forecast of the expected electricity demand for that half-hour period. USEP at any one time is a fixed price (as opposed to a range of prices) determined by the intersection of the supply curve and the expected demand. 6', 'Once USEP is determined, bids by electricity generators that are equal to or below USEP are accepted, whereas bids above USEP are rejected. 7', 'Regardless of their actual bid prices (whether equal to or below USEP), all electricity generators that are called upon to generate in that half-hour will be paid for the electricity supplied to NEMS based on USEP. For example, if the price is $55\/MWh (where \u201cMWh\u201d stands for \u201cmegawatt hour\u201d), an electricity generator that submitted a bid at $30\/MWh will still be paid $55\/MWh for the electricity it supplies to NEMS in that half-hour.', '15\\u2003The price of electricity paid by a retailer encompasses USEP, as well as the Hourly Energy Uplift Charge (\u201cHEUC\u201d). HEUC captures any differences between the total amounts received from retailers and the total amounts paid to electricity generators for energy, reserve and regulation products. The actual price paid for electricity from the wholesale market will typically be slightly higher than the aggregate sum of USEP and HEUC, as there are some additional charges such as the Energy Market Company administrative charges. However, these additional charges are relatively low, and therefore it is common for industry players to equate the aggregate sum of USEP and HEUC with the \u201cPool Price\u201d. 8', '16\\u2003In general, consumers of electricity fall into two categories:', '(a)\\u2003Contestable consumers: Consumers who have an average monthly electricity consumption of at least 2,000 kWh (where \u201ckWh\u201d stands for \u201ckilowatt hour\u201d).', '(b)\\u2003Non-contestable consumers: Consumers who have less than an average monthly electricity consumption of 2,000 kWh. Non-contestable consumers are only entitled to buy electricity from MSSL, which is SP Services Ltd.', '17\\u2003On the other hand, contestable consumers can choose between purchasing electricity from MSSL or from retailers, such as SE. If such consumers purchase electricity from MSSL, they will pay the Pool Price for the electricity they consume. If instead such consumers purchase electricity from retailers in the market, they may negotiate the price of electricity, as well as the duration of the contract with the retailers. Regardless of whether electricity is purchased from MSSL or from a retailer, electricity is supplied to the consumer from the pool. It was undisputed that a consumer can only purchase electricity for a specific location from one retailer or MSSL at any one point in time. A consumer cannot buy electricity concurrently from two sources for the same location.', '18\\u2003YTL and SE taken together form what is known as a \u201cgentailer\u201d. This essentially refers to a vertical integration of the generation and retail of electricity. This is the predominant structure in NEMS. In Singapore, eight of the 15 electricity generators and seven of the 22 retailers are related to each other. 9', 'In 2015, seven out of these eight electricity generators produced a total of 90.5% of the electricity generated in Singapore, 10', 'while the seven corresponding retailers (which have a related generation arm) accounted for more than approximately 96% of the contestable market. 11', 'The remaining seven electricity generators that do not have related retail entities are not in the primary business of generating electricity. They produce electricity as a by-product of their main business, or primarily generate electricity for their own consumption. 12', '19\\u2003While there are 22 retailers in Singapore, only 11 have managed to capture a market share. Of these 11 retailers, the market is dominated by the seven retailers which have a related generation arm. The remaining four retailers are also not big players in the market. From 2014 to 2016, these four retailers did not even capture 1.5% of the market share. 13', '20\\u2003According to SE and YTL, the reason for this structure is that it helps mitigate the gentailer\u2019s exposure to the Pool Price given that the price that the electricity generator receives from selling electricity into the pool is the price that the retailer pays for the electricity it purchases from the pool. With the gentailer structure, the gentailer\u2019s retailing arm would then be paid by the consumer at the agreed contract price or pricing plan.', '21\\u2003By an agreement dated 16 January 2012 between PowerSeraya Limited (\u201cPowerSeraya\u201d) and DSPL, PowerSeraya agreed to supply steam to a site of DSPL designated in the agreement. At [4] above, I have defined this steam supply agreement as \u201cSSA\u201d for convenience.

Apparently DSPL was liable to pay LD under the SSA to PowerSeraya for the delay of seven months. 14', '25\\u2003In May or June 2012, DSPL had indicated to PowerSeraya that it wanted to reduce the Minimum Acceptable Flow Level and Committed Capacity under the SSA which would correspondingly reduce the TOP.', '26\\u2003On 28 June 2012, DSPL wrote to PowerSeraya to put in writing its request which entailed amendments to the SSA. 15', 'PowerSeraya was requested to agree to the reductions \u201cout of goodwill\u201d.', '27\\u2003Various oral discussions and emails ensued. According to Denka, the discussions and emails involved Denka entering into ERAs with SE as a quid pro quo for PowerSeraya\/YTL agreeing to the requested reductions under the SSA.', '28\\u2003On 7 August 2012, YTL sent a letter to DSPL to offer DSPL a concession of the original terms under the SSA. 16', 'This was referred to in the letter as the \u201cConcession Offer\u201d.

In order to ensure that YTL would not be liable to DSPL for any failure to meet technical specifications and\/or the Metering Protocol, YTL sent an email to DSPL dated 30 August 2012 stating terms additional to those in the Concession Offer. These additional terms were accepted by DSPL on 31 August 2012.', '35\\u2003The SSA, as amended by the Concession Offer and the additional terms, was in fact implemented from 1 September 2012. This was the revised Commercial Operation Date under the SSA even though the ASA had not yet been signed.', '36\\u2003In the meantime, DSPL exchanged comments with SE on SE\u2019s standard ERAs. The contract duration under the ERAs was also to be from 1 September 2012 to 31 January 2021. This was the same duration as that under the SSA, as amended by the Concession Offer and the additional terms.', '37\\u2003Eventually, SE signed the three ERAs on or about 4 September 2012. Denka signed them on or about 9 November 2012. However, it was not disputed that SE had proceeded to supply electricity to Denka pursuant to the intended ERAs from 1 September 2012. The three ERAs provided for the supply of electricity to three plants of Denka at three locations in Singapore from 1 September 2012.

The pricing plan was known as an \u201cIndex Price Plan\u201d. It was so named because the price of the electricity sold to Denka was based on a formula that varied with the prices of two indices: High Sulphur Fuel Oil (\u201cHSFO\u201d), and Foreign Exchange (\u201cFX\u201d). Examples of other pricing plans include:', '(a)\\u2003Fixed Price Plan: price of electricity is fixed for the term of the contract; and', '(b)\\u2003Pool Price plus Mark-Up: price of electricity is based on the Pool Price but with a mark-up added.', '40\\u2003In the present case, the ERAs were based on an Index Price Plan but Denka also had a right to request to fix the price of electricity, at any point during the duration of the ERAs, for a period of three years (the \u201cOption to Fix\u201d). If Denka had chosen to exercise the Option to Fix, SE was obliged to fix the price accordingly.', '41\\u2003According to YTL, there were follow-up discussions on the scope of technical works that had to be done at Denka\u2019s new plant in order to modify the supply of steam to DSPL pursuant to the reduced Committed Capacity and TOP quantity under the Concession Offer. Pending agreement on the scope of the modification works, interim technical measures were taken to meet these reductions. In the meantime, the parties proceeded on the premise of the SSA as amended by the Concession Offer and the additional terms in so far as the supply of steam was concerned.', '42\\u2003For the supply of electricity, the parties proceeded on the premise of the three ERAs. Although there were some differences in the pricing formulae between the three ERAs, that is not material for the issue of liability.', '43\\u2003According to YTL\/SE, in or about July 2014, Denka asked if SE could lower the electricity prices under the three ERAs if DSPL increased its consumption of steam. By then, the Pool Price for electricity had dropped so that Denka could likely purchase electricity from other sources at a price lower than that provided for in each of the three ERAs. Oral discussions were held and written proposals were made.', '44\\u2003However, on 20 August 2014, DSPL wrote to YTL to say that, \u201cthe supply of steam and electricity shall cease under the temporary measures of the Concession Offer dated 7 Aug 2012 and the [three ERAs] that were part of the Concession Offer with effect from 1 September 2014\u201d [original emphasis omitted]. 25', '45\\u2003On 25 August 2014, YTL replied: 26', '(a)\\u2003YTL agreed to revert to the SSA, without amendment, from 1 September 2014 for the supply of steam.', '(b)\\u2003As ERA 101 was a contract with DAPL, YTL requested DAPL\u2019s written confirmation of its intention to cease that ERA.', '(c)\\u2003For ERA 99 and ERA 100, YTL considered the termination as set out in DSPL\u2019s letter of 20 August 2014 as a repudiatory breach of the ERAs.', '(d)\\u2003For ERA 99, YTL gave DSPL notice to perform its obligations under the ERA within ten calendar days.', '(e)\\u2003For ERA 100, YTL said it would transfer DSPL\u2019s obligations (meaning DSPL\u2019s account) to MSSL with effect from 2 September 2014 unless DSPL gave written instructions before close of business of 27 August 2014 to stop the transfer. YTL also claimed LD of $3,255,383.39 under ERA 100. The effective date of termination by SE of ERA 100 was 1 September 2014.', '46\\u2003On 28 August 2014, DSPL replied YTL. 27', 'DSPL said:', '(a)\\u2003The three ERAs were part of the Concession Offer which was subject to contract. The ASA was to be signed but it had not been entered into. It denied that the SSA had been amended at all. The only contract in question was the SSA and, under the SSA, DSPL was only obliged to buy steam and not electricity. It disputed YTL\u2019s allegations of repudiation and breaches of the ERAs.', '(b)\\u2003 DSPL\u2019s position (for ERA 101) also reflected DAPL\u2019s position as they were part of the same group.', '47\\u2003Also on 28 August 2014, SE wrote to DSPL in respect of ERA 100.

SE also claimed LD under those contracts as well as payment for electricity supplied up to the dates of termination.', '49\\u2003In the meantime, in a letter dated 3 September 2014 from DSPL to YTL, 31', 'Denka had offered to continue purchasing electricity under the three ERAs pending a determination by the court of the disputes without admission of SE\u2019s claim and to protect Denka\u2019s rights (the \u201cMitigation Offer\u201d). The Mitigation Offer was repeated but it was not accepted by SE.', '50\\u2003Denka did not draw any distinction between DSPL and DAPL or between YTL and SE in its correspondence on the ERAs. However, YTL and SE attempted to maintain the distinction between DSPL and DAPL for formal purposes.

Andrew Tani told Tony Lie that he was looking for an investor to provide USD 1 million which would go towards an initial order of the MSP Products in order to gain exclusive distributorship. Tony Lie agreed in principle to invest the USD 1 million but later had second thoughts. The MSP Products consisted of a range of lubricants and in order to place an order, it was necessary to specify the particular MSP Products and the quantity of the same. As the Plaintiffs had no knowledge which of the MSP Products would sell well, there was a risk that demand for the MSP Products in Indonesia might not match the Plaintiffs\u2019 order composition for an initial USD 1 million order.

PCGL complied \nwith the capital call contributing $189,819 in exchange for 383 shares \nbut declined to provide the loan;\n(d) On 29 March 2019, PCGL received another capital call for \n$66,654 to be paid by 30 March 2019 failing which TCW would be \nentitled to \u201cfull rights to singly contribute capital to [ACPAM] and in so \ndoing, dilute [PCGL\u2019s] shareholding in ACPAM\u201d8;  \n(e) PCGL forwarded a cheque to ACPAM for $66,654 and \nrequested information (and supporting documents) on ACPAM\u2019s need \nfor a further capital call. PCGL\u2019s letter emphasised that its capital \ncontribution was meant to meet ACPAM\u2019s base capital requirements \nand should not be used for other purposes without PCGL\u2019s prior consent. \nPCGL received neither the information nor the documentation it \nrequested;\n8 Para 2.2.5 of Wee\u2019s OS affidavit.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nTan Choon Wee v Pine Capital Group Ltd[2019] SGHC 201\n13(f) PCGL consistently appeared to be the only or the primary cash \ncontributor as TCW would purportedly \u201ccapitalise\u201d his contributions via \noffsets of his alleged claims against ACPAM so much so that for the \ncapital call on 24 January 2019 in (c), he contributed only $74 for the \n378 shares issued to him claiming to offset the balance contribution \nagainst his unpaid and \u201cwaived\u201d salaries (both of which had already \nbeen waived by him);\n(g) TCW\u2019s practice in (f) to \u201ccapitalise\u201d his contribution was \nrepeated for the capital call on 29 March 2019 as PCGL discovered \nsubsequently from ACPAM\u2019s employee that TCW offset his capital \ncontribution against his March 2019 salary and other claims allegedly \ndue to him;\n(h) From the complaint letters it received in [18(a)], PCGL \ndiscovered that TCW had proposed that ACPAM invest $20m in Global \nInvacom Group Limited (\u201cGI\u201d) by way of redeemable convertible notes \n(\u201cthe proposed RCN\u201d). The $20m sum was to come from funds managed \nby ACPAM in particular AOF1 and Advance Credit Fund (\u201cACF\u201d). \nTCW is one of the two directors in AOF1:\n(i) GI intended to raise funds for acquisition purposes and \nwas in discussions with Tactilis Private Limited (\u201cTactilis\u201d) to \nacquire Tactilis Sdn Bhd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Tactilis. \nAt the time, TCW was a non-executive director as well as \nshareholder of Tactilis holding 8.2% shares. Despite being in a \nposition of conflict, TCW failed to disclose his interest in Tactilis \nto ACPAM\u2019s and AOF1\u2019s board of directors. Neither did he \nrecuse himself from decisions pertaining to the proposed RCN;\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nTan Choon Wee v Pine Capital Group Ltd[2019] SGHC 201\n14(ii) It was only in February 2019 that TCW\u2019s interest in \nTactilis came to light. Following objections from ACF\u2019s \ndirectors, TCW represented to them that he would procure \nACF\u2019s withdrawal from participation in the proposed RCN. To-\ndate however, PCGL was not aware if ACF had indeed \nwithdrawn from such participation;\n(iii) It also came to PCGL\u2019s attention that TCW had in May \n2018 attempted to pressurise the directors of AOF1 and ACF into \neffecting a bridging loan to Tactilis of US$600,000.\n20 After the resignations of TCW and PCGL\u2019s other two directors in \n[18(c)], PCGL made a public announcement on 21 March 2019 concerning the \ncomplaints in [18(a)]. It made a separate announcement on the same day that on \n19 March 2019, PCGL had received a notice of termination (\u201cthe notice of \ntermination\u201d) signed by TCW and Lin, of the management agreement between \nACPAM and AOF1 which is ACPAM\u2019s flagship fund and main revenue source. \nWee pointed out that the notice of termination was clearly against ACPAM\u2019S \ninterest as it deprived ACPAM of significant management revenue. \nSubsequently, PCGL learnt that AOF1 signed an agreement to be managed by \nanother fund manager.\n21 Concomitant with the notice of termination, PCGL learnt from \nACPAM\u2019s employees that TCW had made preparations to leave ACPAM, and \ntake some employees with him to another company.  \n22 Wang\u2019s first affidavit accused TCW of deliberately making untruthful \nand unsubstantiated statements in his affidavits that were designed to cast \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nTan Choon Wee v Pine Capital Group Ltd[2019] SGHC 201\n15aspersions on the defendants\u2019 characters and taint the court\u2019s impression of the \ndefendants. Wang deposed to the following facts\/events:\n(a) ACPAM\u2019s solicitors do not (as TCW alleged) act for him in his \ndispute with ACPAM over his employment \u2013 another law firm does;\n(b) There was no basis for TCW\u2019s fears over his personal mail that \nwas sent to ACPAM\u2019s office as such mail was\/would be forwarded to \nhis solicitors;\n(c) In regard to TCW\u2019s assertion in [16(i)] that he was denied access \nto ACPAM\u2019s office, TCW failed to disclose that on 6 April 2019, he was \nsuspended from work and that on the day he alluded to (namely 8 April \n2019), the employees of ACPAM were told to report for work at 2.00pm \nand not 9.00am. Hence, the premises was locked when TCW came to \nthe office that morning. What TCW failed to disclose was that he and \nBernard Ong Kheng Chye (a director of ACPAM until 29 October 2018) \nhad attended at ACPAM\u2019s office at 1.15am to remove the existing front \ndoor lock of ACPAM and replace it with a new lock;\n(d) Wang is on the MAS Register of Representatives and was \nemployed as Portfolio Manager and Fund Director of ACPAM until he \nwas summarily dismissed on 18 March 2019 (by TCW) on alleged \ngrounds which he disputed;\n(e) On 5 April 2019, he was appointed a director of ACPAM \ntogether with Pan and Trina pursuant to a resolution passed at an EGM \nof ACPAM which resolution also removed TCW and Lin as directors of \nACPAM; \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nTan Choon Wee v Pine Capital Group Ltd[2019] SGHC 201\n16(f) Pan has extensive experience in asset\/fund management and \nbanking. He had been the CEO of Pine Asia Asset Management, an \nindirect subsidiary of PCGL (by being owned by a wholly owned \nsubsidiary of PCGL) from April 2015 to April 2017;\n(g) Trina is the head of Investor Relations and of Marketing for \nPCGL and has significant marketing and branding experience;\n(h) TCW had deliberately exaggerated and overstated the \nRegulatory Risk issue by giving the impression that ACPAM\u2019s position \nas a RFMC had been jeopardised by his removal as a director;\n(i) TCW had alleged that the appointment of Wang, Pan and Trina \nas directors had to be approved by MAS. That is incorrect. Even if all or \nany of them did not meet the fit and proper criteria to be appointed \ndirectors, that did not mean that ACPAM\u2019s status as a RFMC would be \nautomatically revoked. Under the MAS Guidelines on Licensing, \nRegistration and Conduct of Business for Fund Management Companies \n(\u201cRFMC Registration Guidelines\u201d), ACPAM as a RFMC only needs to \nnotify MAS of any changes in the company\u2019s particulars within 14 days \nof such change by way of a notification in Form 23A via the Corporate \ne-Lodgment (\u201cCel\u201d) method;\n(j) Owing to Michelle\u2019s wrongful withholding of ACPAM\u2019S \nMASNET login details9, ACPAM was unable to submit the requisite \nForm 23A via Cel by the deadline of 19 April 2019 (14 days from the \nappointment of Wang, Pan and Trina);\n9 See first 24 April Order at [6(c)] above.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nTan Choon Wee v Pine Capital Group Ltd[2019] SGHC 201\n17(k) Indeed, instead of helping ACPAM to inform MAS of the new \ndirector appointees, Michelle obstructed the process by challenging the \nthree defendants\u2019 appointment in her letter to MAS dated 6 April 2019;\n(l) MAS does not provide prior approval of new appointments \nwhich fact was known to TCW and yet, he misrepresented the position. \nPrior approval of directors of companies before their appointment is \nrequired from MAS only for holders of Capital Market Services licence \n(\u201cCMS\u201d) under Regulation 12 of the SF(LCB)R. ACPAM does not hold \na CMS licence. Indeed, as a RFMC, ACPAM is exempted from the \nrequirement under the said Regulation 12 pursuant to Regulation 5(7) of \nthe Second Schedule to the SF(LCB)R;\n(m) Under the Guidelines on Fit and Proper Criteria issued by MAS \nwhich are applicable to all relevant persons carrying out activities \nregulated by MAS, sn 3 states:10\nThe onus is on each relevant person to establish that it \nor he is a fit and proper person rather than for MAS to \nshow otherwise. Where a relevant person is required \nunder the relevant legislation to ensure that another \nrelevant person is fit and proper, the onus is on the \nformer to establish to the satisfaction of MAS that the \nlatter is fit and proper...\nIt was for PCGL not MAS to determine whether Wang, Pan and Trina \nare fit and proper persons to be appointed as directors of ACPAM;\n(n) It was telling that TCW could only make ambiguous \nsuppositions in TCW\u2019s first affidavit such as \u201c[s]hould the MAS take an \n10 Wee\u2019s first affidavit, WHYA-2 at pp 36 to 59. \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nTan Choon Wee v Pine Capital Group Ltd[2019] SGHC 201\n18adverse view of the change of directors\u201d11 and there is a \u201creal risk that \n[ACPAM] may lose its RFMC status\u201d and \u201cshould that happen, there is \na real risk that [TCW] will be irreparably harmed as a shareholder\u201d \n[emphasis added];12\n(o) Although MAS had been informed of the change of directorships \nand legal dispute, it had not raised any regulatory issues;\n(p) Due to the lack of clarity as to the state of affairs of ACPAM, \nPCGL had to call for a trading suspension of its shares on 21 March \n2019 in consultation with Singapore Exchange Ltd (\u201cSGX\u201d). Further, \nPCGL will appoint an independent reviewer to investigate the various \nallegations received concerning ACPAM;\n(q) Although TCW had put across the position that ACPAM was in \na poor financial state thereby necessitating urgent capital calls, he \nhimself had been using ACPAM\u2019s finances as his \u201cpersonal piggy \nbank\u201d13 \u2013 ACPAM had been paying for TCW\u2019s personal fibre broadband \nservice, Singtel Mio-TV services, membership expenses at the \nSingapore Swimming Club, charges of Spotify (an audio streaming \nmusic platform) as well as the charges on six mobile telephone lines \nwhich bill for June 2019 itself came to $11,785.31. \n23 Wee added that ACPAM is the only active operation subsidiary of \nPCGL; should ACPAM lose its status as a RFMC or be wound up14, it could \n11 Para 17 of TCW\u2019s first affidavit.\n12 Para 29 of TCW\u2019s first affidavit. \n13 Para 85 of Wang\u2019s first affidavit.\n14 One of TCW\u2019s prayers in the Suit.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nTan Choon Wee v Pine Capital Group Ltd[2019] SGHC 201\n19potentially cause the delisting of PCGL which would affect its 6,000 \nshareholders, not an outcome that PCGL and its directors would want in their \nown and in the company\u2019s, interests.\n24 In contrast, Wee highlighted certain acts on the part of TCW that are \ndetrimental to the interest of ACPAM should he remain as its director including \nthe following:\n(a) On 30 July 2018, MAS reprimanded TCW for (i) contravening s \n92(b) of the SFA in his omission to declare certain information in a CMS \nlicence application and (ii) para 5(71)(a) of the Second Schedule of the \nSF(LCB)R for failing to lodge a notice of change in particulars within \n14 days after the date of change. PCGL was only made aware of this fact \nin mid-February 2019 when it received a copy of the reprimand letter \nfrom a shareholder of PCGL. The reprimand was a matter of concern to \nACPAM as MAS\u2019 letter stated that it15\n\u2026may also take this reprimand into account when \nconsidering actions to be taken against the [ACPAM] for \nany further contravention of the applicable laws and \nregulatory requirements, or in the assessment of \n[ACPAM\u2019s] future applications for licences and \napplications. \nFurther, a conviction for breach of s 93(b) renders the offender liable to \na fine of $50,000;\n(b) On 12 April 2019, MAS issued a reprimand to TCW as the CEO \nand director of ACPAM for (i) omitting information in a CMS licence \napplication which omission caused the application to be misleading in a \n15 Para 2.3.5 of Wee\u2019s first affidavit, exhibit WHYA-6 at p 131. \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nTan Choon Wee v Pine Capital Group Ltd[2019] SGHC 201\n20material respect, and\/or (ii) failing to discharge his duty and function as \nCEO and director.\n25 On 10 April 2019, TCW withdrew RM3m from the bank account of \nAOF1.  \n26 Wang disclosed that ACPAM had rented out to PCGL a meeting room \nat its premises between 1 February 2018 to 9 May 2020. PCGL\u2019s employees \noccupy the room and the property in the meeting room belongs to PCGL. \nConsequently, when TCW changed the locks to the main door in the early hours \nof 8 April 2019, he not only hindered the efforts of Wang, Pan and Trina in \nsecuring ACPAM\u2019s property but also disrupted PCGL\u2019s operations.  \n27 Wee\u2019s first affidavit similarly took issue with TCW\u2019s assertions in \n[15(e) and 15(f)]. Wee repeated what Wang deposed to in regard to the \nappointment of fit and proper persons as directors of RFMCs like ACPAM. \n28 Consequently, Wee deposed that there was no truth in TCW\u2019s assertions \nthat Wang, Pan and Trina have to be \u201ccleared and accepted\u201d by MAS as fit and \nproper persons before they can be appointed as directors of ABPAM. All that is \nrequired is for ACPAM to file Form 23A for the appointments.\n29 TCW\u2019s third affidavit was a response to the first affidavits of Wee and \nWang. Here, TCW alluded to his affidavit filed in the OS proceedings on 16 \nApril 2019 (\u201cTCW\u2019s OS affidavit\u201d). In TCW\u2019s OS affidavit as well in TCW\u2019s \nthird affidavit, he deposed to an understanding between himself and one Sun \nWei Yeh (\u201cSWY\u201d) that he would be the CEO and an executive director of \nACPAM. Accordingly, PCGL\u2019s attempts to remove him as a director and CEO \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nTan Choon Wee v Pine Capital Group Ltd[2019] SGHC 201\n21were contrary to his legitimate expectations as a shareholder of ACPAM, \nemphasising that he founded ACPAM.  \n30 TCW alleged that SWY became a shareholder of PCGL on his \nrepresentation to TCW that he (SWY) would bring funds in under ACPAM\u2019s \nmanagement.  SWY holds the majority shares in PCGL with his associate Jessie \nSun (\u201cSun\u201d) through his company Prime Partners Pte Ltd (\u201cPrime Partners\u201d) of \nwhich he is the sole shareholder.  \n31 TCW\u2019s third affidavit was replete with references to SWY and \nallegations of impropriety on the latter\u2019s part which he feared would violate the \nprohibitory directions issued by MAS against SWY and which could cause \nACPAM to lose its RFMC licence. Should that happen, it would lead to the \npotential delisting of PCGL.  \n32 TCW\u2019s third affidavit sought to explain the complaints against him that \nWee raised16. The complaints were from Alauddin Ahmed (\u201cAA\u201d)17 a non-\nexecutive director of AOF1 and ACF and Sun, the then Chief Operating Officer \nof PCGL. The complaints related primarily to a reverse takeover transaction \nbetween Tactilis and GI18 which was eventually aborted.  \n33 TCW alleged that Sun was clearly partisan as she was a director of \nPCGL between 2 February 2017 to 15 August 2018. As for AA, TCW claimed \nthat he was a close friend of one David Sarkis (\u201cSarkis\u201d) who is beholden to \n16 See [18(a)] above.\n17 Who sued TCW, Lin and AOF1 in a derivative action on behalf of AOF1in Suit No \n424 of 2019 which was discontinued on 27 May 2019.\n18 See [19(h)] above.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nTan Choon Wee v Pine Capital Group Ltd[2019] SGHC 201\n22SWY as the latter had (through PCGL) bought out Sarkis\u2019 shares in a company \ncalled Silver Tree Hong Kong Limited enabling Sarkis to raise funds. \n34 In regard to ACPAM\u2019s complaints against him, TCW pointed out that \nWang was himself a complainant purportedly as ACPAM\u2019s only executive \ndirector after TCW was suspended as CEO. He criticised Wang for not \nappointing an independent reviewer to look into the complaints as ACPAM had \nannounced it would, which indicated that PCGL was not interested in carrying \nout an independent and genuine investigation.\n35 In regard to Wang\u2019s complaint in [22(q)] of his expenses being borne by \nACPAM, TCW relied on clause 10.5 of his employment contract to justify his \nentitlement to such expenses being paid on his behalf.19 He asserted that as \nACPAM\u2019s CEO, he is contractually entitled to be reimbursed his expenses \nincluding telephone bills, Singtel broadband services and his membership fees \nat the Singapore Swimming Club. PCGL had not previously made an issue of \nsuch expenses that he incurred.\n36  As for the various capital calls that ACPAM made, TCW defended them \nas being not \u201cuncommon\u201d for fund managers to raise funds in this manner in \norder to maintain the base capital requirements of MAS. In regard to Wee\u2019s \ncomplaint20 that he failed to respond to questions that PCGL raised in regard to \nthe necessity of the capital call on 29 March 2019, TCW complained he was not \neven given an opportunity to explain as PCGL unilaterally removed him as a \ndirector and denied him access to ACPAM\u2019s information.  Moreover, he was \n19 Para 45 of TCW\u2019s third affidavit, exhibit TCW-20 at pp 187 to 188.\n20 At [19(e)].\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nTan Choon Wee v Pine Capital Group Ltd[2019] SGHC 201\n23overseas in the interval between PCGL\u2019s request and the EGM on 5 April 2019.  \nPCGL\u2019s conduct showed the company was not interested in hearing his \nexplanation.  \n37 TCW put the entire blame for his reprimands from MAS on SWY.  He \ndeposed that ACPAM had applied for a CMS licence from MAS on 9 June 2017.  \nMAS rejected the application on 8 August 2017 because SWY did not make a \ndeclaration that he was a fit and proper person to be appointed as executive \ndirector and CEO of ACPAM. As SWY was reluctant to provide the declaration, \nACPAM made a fresh application for a CMS licence on 22 September 2017 in \nwhich it was stated that he (TCW) would be the executive director and CEO of \nACPAM.  \n38 On 28 September 2017, MAS asked TCW for an assessment of SWY \nfor purposes of the application as well as that all substantial direct and indirect \nshareholders of ACPAM provide declarations that they were fit and proper \npersons to participate in a company which operates under a CMS licence. While \nTCW provided MAS with his declaration, SWY refused to do so. This resulted \nin MAS rejecting again ACPAM\u2019s application.\n39 TCW deposed that he made various attempts between October 2017 and \nJanuary 2018 to persuade SWY to provide the declaration to no avail. On 15 \nJanuary 2018, TCW wrote to inform MAS that SWY would not provide the \ndeclaration requested. By its email reply dated 16 January 2018, MAS expressed \nits dissatisfaction with SWY\u2019s position and ACPAM\u2019s position. TCW deposed \nhe continued to appease MAS without success. \n40 On 9 April 2018, MAS wrote to ACPAM requiring the latter to take \nsteps to ensure that SWY would not be appointed as a representative or a \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nTan Choon Wee v Pine Capital Group Ltd[2019] SGHC 201\n24director of ACPAM and that SWY would not have any direct or indirect role in \nACPAM\u2019s affairs nor should its shares be sold to SWY. TCW informed MAS \non 7 May 2018 that there were limitations to ACPAM\u2019s ability to ensure that its \nindirect shareholders were fit and proper given that PCGL is a listed company. \nHe emailed MAS on 10 May 2018 to comply with the directives given on 9 \nApril 2018.\n41 After a further email from MAS dated 28 June 2018 reiterating what it \nstated on 9 April 2018, MAS issued a reprimand on 30 July 2018 to ACPAM \n(and not to TCW personally) for omitting to state that SWY is its shareholder \nin its application for a CMS licence on 22 September 2017. MAS was also not \ninformed that SWY was involved in several civil lawsuits in 2017. TCW was \nthen approached by MAS representatives who insisted that if SWY was \nunwilling to provide the declaration requested, he should be persuaded to \nrelinquish his direct and indirect interests in ACPAM.  \n42 As a result, on 17 October 2018, Pine Partners transferred its 9% direct \nshareholdings in ACPAM to TCW resulting in him holding 49% shares. \nHowever, SWY was unwilling to relinquish his shares in PCGL.  \n43 On 8 February 2019 MAS gave TCW notice that he would be \nreprimanded as a director and CEO of ACPAM, based on ACPAM\u2019s application \nfor a CMS licence on 22 September 2017. Notwithstanding his explanation to \nMAS on 22 February 2019 that inter alia stated that SWY was not a direct \nshareholder of ACPAM and ACPAM did not appreciate that the declaration \nrequirement applied to indirect shareholders, MAS reprimanded him by its letter \ndated 12 April 2019.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nTan Choon Wee v Pine Capital Group Ltd[2019] SGHC 201\n2544 Seen in its proper context, TCW asserted that the MAS reprimand in \n[41] was not an indication that he is not a fit and proper person to be a director \nof ACPAM. Rather, it evidences that MAS is concerned over SWY being an \nindirect shareholder of ACPAM and SWY\u2019s persistent refusal to provide the \nnecessary information for ACPAM\u2019s CMS licence application.\n45 Accordingly, TCW deposed that it made no sense for PCGL to proceed \nwith the EGM on 5 April 2019 on the basis of urgency since the reprimand from \nMAS was in July 2018 for ACPAM\u2019s CMS licence application submitted in \nSeptember 2017. He alleged that it was the actions of SWY through PCGL that \ncaused ACPAM\u2019s ability to continue as a RFMC to be at risk.\n46 TCW elaborated on his allegation by pointing out that SWY had \nincreased his effective interest in ACPAM by acquiring the majority \nshareholding in PCGL. Secondly, all the current board members of PCGL are \nappointed by SWY and\/or his associates including Pan and Wee. PCGL then \npurported to replace the entire board of ACPAM with persons associated with \nSWY.\n47 In regard to Wang\u2019s allegation in [25] that he wrongfully withdrew \nRM3m from AOF1\u2019s bank account, TCW explained that it was done to fulfil \nAOF1\u2019s existing commitments and was done in the interest of AOF1 and \nACPAM. TCW claimed he made active trades and transactions in the ordinary \ncourse of business for and on behalf of AOF1 which funds came from various \ninvestors. He deposed that his team (comprising of himself, Michelle, Lynn and \nCharlene) are the key employees in charge of managing the funds under \nACPAM\u2019s management. \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nTan Choon Wee v Pine Capital Group Ltd[2019] SGHC 201\n2648 TCW claimed that AOF1 had committed itself to three transactions with \nTanco Holdings Berhad, Eden Inc Berhad and Tiger Synergy Berhad for which \nAOF1 must make payment by 12 April 2019. To meet the payment deadline, \ninstructions had to be given to AOF1\u2019s bank (ie, CIMB Bank) by 10 April 2019 \nin order for the funds to reach the three payees in time. He had instructed his \nsolicitors to seek the consent of Wang, Pan and Trina on the morning of 10 April \n2019 through the trio\u2019s solicitors and to use the computers and bank tokens on \nACPAM\u2019s premises for the limited purpose of carrying out the banking \ntransaction on behalf of AOF1. The three defendants\u2019 response was to raise \nvarious spurious queries and subsequently requested that AOF1 undertake that \nit will indemnify ACPAM for any losses that ACPAM may incur as a result of \nconsenting to the transaction. \n49 TCW took the view that the defendants were being obstructive and did \nnot appreciate the urgency and gravity of the situation. He claimed that any \ndiscussion with them would only cause further delays in effecting payment and \nwould result in AOF1 defaulting on its obligations and ACPAM to be liable to \nAOF1 for causing the default. Consequently, TCW took it upon himself on 10 \nApril 2019 to visit the main branch of CIMB and arrange for payment to be \nmade by AOF1 when he \u201chappened to be in Kuala Lumpur on that day for a \nbusiness trip\u201d.21 Had it not been for the defendants\u2019 obstructiveness, the payment \ncould have been carried out ACPAM\u2019s premises using its bank tokens. \n50 As for the alleged irregularities raised by Wee at [18(a)], TCW asserted \nthat Wang had mischaracterised the concerns raised by AA and Sarkis in their \nemails dated 10 April 2019 addressed to ACPAM. The two had sought to \n21 Para 52 of TCW\u2019s third affidavit. \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nTan Choon Wee v Pine Capital Group Ltd[2019] SGHC 201\n27redeem their investments in AOF1. He had informed them that their investment \nwould be \u201cgated\u201d ie, they would be paid in stages in accordance with the terms \nof their investment. This was to prevent a run on the fund and to avoid the fund \nhaving to liquidate its investment at fire sale prices to the detriment of the entire \nvalue of the fund. The two merely expressed their unhappiness in their \naforementioned emails even though as fund managers themselves, they were \naware of the practice of gating redemptions. The Placing Memorandum of \nAOF1 clearly spelt out the redemption restrictions to not more than 20% of a \nrelevant class of funds being redeemed. AA\u2019s and Sarkis\u2019 investment comprised \nof 100% of a particular class of funds. \n51 TCW alleged that the first affidavits of Wee and Wang only made \nambiguous suppositions as to whether the second to fourth defendants are fit \nand proper persons to be directors. He contended that it is untrue that MAS did \nnot take an adverse position to their appointments and did not state that they \ncannot hold office. In support of his position, TCW referred to the response \ndated 9 April 2019 from MAS to Wang\u2019s email to the former dated 8 April \n2019.  I will return to this email exchange later22 to explain why it did not help \nTCW\u2019s case.  \n52 TCW accused Wang of downplaying the gravity of appointing Wang, \nPan and Trina as directors of ACPAM in violation of MAS\u2019 directives as they \neffectively gave SWY full control of ACPAM. This caused ACPAM to be at \nrisk of losing its RFMC status with the potential consequence of PCGL being \ndelisted to the detriment of its shareholders.\n22 See [85] below.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nTan Choon Wee v Pine Capital Group Ltd[2019] SGHC 201\n2853 As for Wang\u2019s insinuation that he was not fit and proper to be a director \ndue to his suspension and fine in 2000 and 2004 respectively by SGX for \nbreaching SGX\u2019s rules, TCW pointed out that the fact he was a director of \nPCGL after that clearly showed that was not the case.\n54  As for Wang\u2019s request that he and the three ladies named in [6(c)] above \nshould return the bank tokens and MASNET details of ACPAM, TCW pointed \nout that the 9 April Order in [5] put a \u201cstand-still\u201d in place. As Wang was \nprohibited by that order of court from exercising the functions of CEO of \nACPAM, there was no reason for him to have either the bank tokens or \nMASNET details. TCW denied Wang\u2019s allegation that he attempted to or did, \ndisable, ACPAM\u2019s email and web domain host and server, and its Microsoft \n365 account.\n55 TCW did not deny that he had changed the locks on the main door of \nACPAM on 6 April 2019. He justified his action on the basis it was done to \nprotect and secure ACPAM\u2019s offices as, by that date, it was clear to him that \n\u201cthe [first] to [fourth] defendants were going to attempt to access ACPAM\u2019s \noffices\u201d.23  \n56 TCW deposed that Wang\u2019s allegation that he and key employees had \nseverely crippled ACPAM\u2019s business operations was untrue \u2013 apart from AOF1, \nACPAM\u2019s only other fund is ACF which is not active.\nThe Leave Application\n57  For the Leave Application, the following affidavits were filed:\n23 Para 72 of TCW\u2019s third affidavit.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nTan Choon Wee v Pine Capital Group Ltd[2019] SGHC 201\n29(a) TCW\u2019s affidavit filed on 6 May 2019 (\u201cTCW\u2019s fourth \naffidavit\u201d);\n(b) Wang\u2019s affidavit filed on 22 May 2019 (Wang\u2019s second \naffidavit\u201d);\n(c) Wee\u2019s affidavit filed on 22 May 2019 (\u201cWee\u2019s third affidavit\u201d);\n(d) TCW\u2019s affidavit filed on 30 May 2019 (\u201cTCW\u2019s fifth affidavit\u201d).\n58 Not surprisingly, the affidavits filed by Wang and Wee opposed the \nLeave Application.  \n59 Both Wang and Wee argued that there were no errors of law that \nwarranted TCW being granted leave to"}

She also pleaded guilty to one charge under s 47(1)(c) of the CDSA, for using the benefits of her criminal conduct to acquire property. Five other charges were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing.', '14\\u2003At the material time, Kaur was a Lead Contract Specialist of the US Navy based at its Supply Systems Command Fleet Logistics Centre in Singapore (\u201cNAVSUP FLC Singapore\u201d). 4', 'She performed duties of a senior contract specialist, and led a team of contract specialists. She was authorised to enter into multi-million dollar contracts on behalf of the US federal government. She therefore stood in a position that required substantial trust, responsibility and accountability to the US government. 5', '15\\u2003In the main, her role as a Lead Contract Specialist included managing complex ship-husbanding contracts. This required her to draft and develop contract requirements, strategise procurements, engage in sensitive foreign country coordination and discussions at senior management levels, conduct pre-award market surveys, solicit, negotiate and evaluate bids, evaluate quotes, and assess performance after the services were provided. 6', '16\\u2003Kaur was subject to federal regulations which prohibited, inter alia: (a) the disclosure of non-public information of the US Navy to external parties; and (b) the acceptance of any bribe, gratuity and\/or any form of benefits in the course of employment. 7', '17\\u2003Kaur\u2019s SOF also included the following information. In 2012, Leonard was discovered to be bribing US Navy personnel with millions of dollars\u2019 worth of gifts 8', 'in order to, inter alia, divert US Navy vessels to ports in the Pacific and South East Asia where GDMA had a presence, and supply classified and other non-public information. This enabled GDMA to secure lucrative ship-husbanding contracts to supply US Navy vessels at ports located in the region. GDMA also overcharged for goods and services supplied at these ports, defrauding the US Navy of about US$35 million. 9', 'The investigations uncovered that the decade-long bribery and fraud conspiracy extended to numerous countries, was the largest in the US Navy\u2019s history, and involved numerous US Navy personnel (including senior personnel). 10', '18\\u2003Kaur first became acquainted with Leonard sometime in 1999 to 2005 11', 'when she held a more junior rank. She had more significant interactions with him after she was promoted to Lead Contract Specialist.', '19\\u2003On numerous occasions from 2006 to 2013, Kaur initiated disclosure of non-public information of the US Navy to Leonard. Such information included inter alia, procurement-sensitive information, strategic information on new ship-husbanding contracts, pricing strategy, price information of GDMA\u2019s competitors, the names of personnel on the contracts review board, and even the questions posed by the review board to GDMA\u2019s competitors. 12', '20\\u2003In return for the inside information, Kaur and Leonard had a shared understanding that Kaur would be duly rewarded for providing non-public information about the US Navy on an ongoing basis, with a view to ensuring GDMA retained an advantage. 13', 'As a result, Leonard could ensure that GDMA\u2019s bids were competitive, so that GDMA continued to secure lucrative ship-husbanding contracts with the US Navy. 14', '21\\u2003Kaur took great efforts to conceal her illicit disclosure of information to Leonard. 15', 'I elaborate on this below at [153]. Furthermore, Kaur understood that, as GDMA\u2019s \u201cinsider\u201d within NAVSUP FLC Singapore, she was expected to further GDMA\u2019s interests as far as possible and whenever the opportunity arose. On numerous occasions, Kaur sought Leonard\u2019s input on submissions she made to her superiors, and written replies that she sent on behalf of the US Navy to GDMA\u2019s competitors in connection with potential or ongoing contracts with the US Navy. 16', '22\\u2003In all, the inside information leaked by Kaur was linked to 16 US Navy contracts. Of these 16, GDMA bid for 14, and was awarded 11 contracts worth a total of about US$48 million.', '23\\u2003In December 2008, Leonard arranged for the delivery of a hamper containing food, alcohol, and a red packet with S$50,000 in cash to Kaur. When Kaur asked what the red packet was about, Leonard told her it was her \u201cChristmas bonus\u201d. Kaur understood that the S$50,000 was a reward for the non-public US Navy information she had supplied, and accepted it. This is the subject of DAC-942782-2015, under s 6(a) of the PCA (\u201cthe 4th charge\u201d).', '24\\u2003In 2009, Kaur wished to purchase a condominium unit worth more than S$1 million, but could not pay the option fee. She thus telephoned Leonard to ask for S$50,000 cash, knowing he would agree. Leonard acceded, and arranged for S$50,000 cash to be delivered to Kaur, which she accepted. This is the subject of DAC-942784-2015, under s 6(a) of the PCA (\u201cthe 6th charge\u201d).', '25\\u2003Kaur then applied the cash towards the option fee. She subsequently resold the unit at a profit of S$267,000. This is the subject of DAC-942785-2015, pursuant to s 47(1)(c) punishable under s 47(6) of the CDSA (\u201cthe 7th charge\u201d).', '26\\u2003Sometime in July 2011, Kaur booked a resort stay in Bali, before subsequently mentioning this resort stay to Leonard with the intention of prompting Leonard to pay for it. She knew Leonard would offer to pay given their corrupt agreement, and also because he had acceded to prior similar requests. As expected, Leonard asked Kaur to forward the online reservation details to him for him to settle payment, and she did so.', '27\\u2003Thereafter, Kaur telephoned Leonard as the holiday was approaching but she had not heard from him. Leonard assured her that he was looking into payment arrangements. That same night, to prompt Leonard to make payment, Kaur emailed Leonard a set of US Navy documents, which included:', '(a)\\u2003internal email correspondence between Kaur\u2019s superiors about GDMA\u2019s services for port visits to Hong Kong and Singapore under a regional ship-husbanding contract for Southeast Asia; and', '(b)\\u2003a draft letter by Kaur\u2019s superior to GDMA expressing concerns on the unsatisfactory service provided by GDMA.', 'Kaur did this to give Leonard an insight into her superiors\u2019 concerns regarding GDMA\u2019s services in Hong Kong and Singapore, enabling him to prepare a detailed response ahead of GDMA receiving the final letter from her superior. That same day, Leonard made arrangements for Kaur\u2019s resort stay to be charged to his credit card. 17', '28\\u2003Kaur proceeded with the resort stay, charging various expenses to her room. The total bill of S$14,977.74 was paid for by Leonard. This is the subject of DAC-942787-2015, under section 6(a) of the PCA (\u201cthe 9th charge\u201d).', '29\\u2003Five further charges were taken into consideration as set out below. All but one, ie, Kaur\u2019s 4th TIC charge, are s 6(a) PCA offences, for gratification corruptly obtained from Leonard as a reward for providing non-public US Navy information to Leonard: 18', '30\\u2003In mitigation, Kaur raised the issue of her medical condition, and the impact imprisonment would have on her. In this connection, a Newton hearing was conducted to determine the precise nature of her medical condition. I discuss the details below as they arise.', '31\\u2003For completeness, I should add that Kaur voluntarily disgorged S$130,278.24, being the total sum of gratification received for all the charges.'"}
{"casename":"2019_SGHC_208","fact":"'3\\u2003Originating Summons (Family) No 71 of 2011 (\u201cOSF 71\/2011\u201d) provides the relevant context for the present suit.', '4\\u2003In OSF 71\/2011, commenced on 18 February 2011, 2', 'two of BLL\u2019s sisters (\u201cthe Sisters\u201d) applied under s 20 of the MCA for a declaration that BLL was unable to make decisions regarding her property and affairs, and for a consequential order that deputies be appointed to make all decisions regarding such matters on her behalf. OSF 71\/2011 was heard at first instance by a senior district judge (\u201cthe First Instance Judge\u201d) of the Subordinate Courts (as the State Courts was then known) and her written decision was published as AUR and another v AUT and others [2012] SGDC 489 (\u201cthe First Instance GD\u201d). As observed by the First Instance Judge, the crux of the dispute in OSF 71\/2011 was the circumstances and events before and after BLL created a particular trust dated 26 October 2010 (\u201cthe Trust\u201d) (First Instance GD at [35]). The details of the Trust will be explained more fully below.', '5\\u2003OSF 71\/2011 was heavily contested by the defendants and BLL herself (as the third defendant in OSF 71\/2011), resulting in protracted litigation. At first instance, BLL was found to lack decision-making capacity but this was reversed on appeal by the High Court in Registrar\u2019s Appeal Nos 223 and 224 of 2012. OSF 71\/2011 eventually culminated in the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in CA 27\/2014, reported as Re BKR [2015] 4 SLR 81 (\u201cRe BKR (Court of Appeal)\u201d). The Court of Appeal disagreed with the High Court and found that BLL lacked capacity \u201cbecause of a combination of mental impairment and the circumstances in which she lives\u201d (Re BKR (Court of Appeal) at [207]). Specifically, as to her actual circumstances, the Court of Appeal found that BLL was subject to the undue influence of the defendants and was cut off from people who would otherwise be able to give her advice (Re BKR (Court of Appeal) at [207]). Consequently, deputies were appointed to act on BLL\u2019s behalf.', '6\\u2003At the outset, it ought to be highlighted that the Court of Appeal had examined BLL\u2019s capacity \u201cin relation to specific decisions\u201d (Re BKR (Court of Appeal) at [208]). These \u201cspecific decisions\u201d were BLL\u2019s decisions to set up the Trust and to transfer her assets held in UBS to DBS. The Court of Appeal held that BLL lacked capacity at the time these decisions were made. The Court of Appeal\u2019s decision will be examined in greater detail below.', '7\\u2003Four years have passed since the conclusion of OSF 71\/2011. In S 1085\/2016, BLL, through her deputies, is advancing several claims against the defendants. First, BLL avers that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties owed to BLL, as they were her agents in relation to the Trust. Alternatively, the defendants were fiduciaries because BLL reposed trust and confidence in them in relation to her property and affairs. 3', 'It is alleged that the defendants were in breach of their fiduciary duties as they: 4', '(a)\\u2003unduly influenced BLL when she established the Trust;', '(b)\\u2003unduly influenced BLL to instruct UBS to transfer all her assets in UBS to DBS for the purposes of the Trust; and', '(c)\\u2003cut off BLL\u2019s access to persons who could assist her in making independent decisions representative of her wishes.', '8\\u2003Accordingly, BLL is claiming for damages and\/or equitable compensation for the defendants\u2019 breach of fiduciary duties. In connection with the Trust, BLL has, inter alia, incurred expenses in dismantling the Trust in the British Virgin Islands (\u201cBVI\u201d) and in pursuing legal action in the BVI with regard to the Trust. 5', '9\\u2003For completeness, I should mention that it is also alleged in the statement of claim that the defendants unduly influenced BLL when she executed a will in 2011 (\u201cthe 2011 Will\u201d). I was informed by BLL\u2019s counsel during the hearing on 9 July 2019 that the 2011 Will no longer forms part of their claim in S 1085\/2016. 6', '10\\u2003Second, apart from a claim for breach of fiduciary duties, BLL also brings a claim in undue influence. 7', 'BLL\u2019s counsel clarified in the course of submissions that the claim in undue influence was one in tort or equity. For present purposes, it is not necessary to determine if undue influence, which is typically raised as a vitiating factor against contracts, can also give rise to a cause of action in its own right.', '11\\u2003The third cause of action advanced by BLL is a claim for an abuse of the fiduciary relationship of influence and\/or confidence between BLL and the defendants. As with the foregoing two causes of action, this claim is underpinned by the allegations of undue influence against the defendants.', '12\\u2003Before I turn to the Preliminary Issues, it is useful to briefly describe the Trust, given its centrality to S 1085\/2016. The Trust is dated 26 October 2010 and the relevant documents were signed in November 2010. It was created with DBS and the trustee was a BVI trust company. The trustee had absolute discretion in applying the money in the Trust for the beneficiaries: a company which can be referred to as \u201cB Ltd\u201d and a class of beneficiaries being \u201cCharities to be determined\u201d. The first defendant, BLM, was the protector of the Trust. On 27 July 2012, a deed of understanding was entered between BLL, BLM and the trustee which provided that the moneys in B Ltd were to be used for the exclusive purpose of maintaining BLL during her lifetime (Re BKR (Court of Appeal) at [19]).', '13\\u2003The Trust identified a class of persons, referred to as Excluded Persons, who were entirely excluded from enjoying any benefits under the Trust. The excluded persons were BLL\u2019s two other children, NG and CK. In addition, BLM, by virtue of her position as protector of the Trust, was also an excluded person, although the Sisters contended in OSF 71\/2011 that BLM would fall outside the definition of an excluded person if she relinquished her position as protector. The Trust was later amended to stipulate that BLM would also be an excluded person under the Trust, regardless of her status as protector. However, the provision of a gift of $10m to BLM, if she remained the protector on the date of BLL\u2019s demise, was retained (Re BKR (Court of Appeal) at [20]).', '14\\u2003Between 8 November 2010 and 15 December 2010, following the creation of the Trust, BLL issued a series of conflicting instructions to her UBS bankers to transfer her assets to DBS, which UBS did not act on (Re BKR (Court of Appeal) at [25]; First Instance GD at [106]).', '15\\u2003After the creation of the Trust, BLL left Singapore for Hong Kong together with BLM on 28 November 2010. Based on the evidence in OSF 71\/2011, it was found that the defendants began to cut off access to BLL once she was brought back to Hong Kong. BLL resided with the defendants and was isolated from her family members, including the Sisters and BLL\u2019s two other children (Re BKR (Court of Appeal) at [202]; First Instance GD at [106]).', '16\\u2003The Court of Appeal held that BLL lacked capacity at the time she made the decisions to set up the Trust and issued conflicting instructions to UBS (Re BKR (Court of Appeal) at [208]). Subsequently, the deputies pursued legal action in the BVI court to set aside the Trust, which was then set aside with the consent of the defendants.', '17\\u2003The three preliminary questions brought by consent pursuant to O 33 r 2 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (\u201cROC\u201d) in the present summons concern the doctrine of res judicata: specifically, they relate to issue estoppel and the extended doctrine of res judicata. The three preliminary questions are as follows: 8', '(a)\\u2003Whether the Court of Appeal, in Re BKR (Court of Appeal), found that the defendants unduly influenced BLL into deciding to set up, setting up and\/or signing the settlement constituting a trust dated 26 October 2010 (\u201cthe First Preliminary Issue\u201d). I shall in the course of this judgment also refer to this issue as the \u201cUndue Influence Issue\u201d;', '(b)\\u2003If the answer to the First Preliminary Issue is yes, whether such finding(s) are final and binding on the defendants in S 1085\/2016 (\u201cthe Second Preliminary Issue\u201d); and', '(c)\\u2003If the answer to the First Preliminary Issue and\/or the Second Preliminary Issue is no, whether the extended doctrine of res judicata precludes the defendants from arguing that they did not unduly influence BLL into deciding to set up, setting up and\/or signing the settlement constituting the Trust (\u201cthe Third Preliminary Issue\u201d).', '18\\u2003At the first hearing on 29 April 2019 for the present action, the defendants took the view that the Second Preliminary Issue did not encompass the extended doctrine of res judicata. SUM 4275\/2018 was thus amended by consent to include the Third Preliminary Issue. Counsel for the defendants prepared his written submissions for the hearing on 9 July 2019 on the basis that the Third Preliminary Issue would be relevant only if the First and Second Preliminary Issues were both answered in the negative. Nevertheless, he was prepared to proceed, at the oral submissions, on the basis that the Third Preliminary Issue would still be operative if the First Preliminary Issue was answered in the positive and the Second Preliminary Issue was answered in the negative. 9', 'This is the approach of the present judgment. The use of \u201cand\u201d within the \u201cand\/or\u201d frame as applied to the First and Second Preliminary Issue as drafted within the Third Preliminary Issue must be conjunctive: as explained in the course of this judgment, the Third Preliminary Issue becomes relevant where the First is answered in the positive and the Second is answered in the negative.', '19\\u2003In addition, OSF 71\/2011 was directed to be heard in camera when the matter was at first instance and the appellate judgments were redacted. If S 1085\/2016 were to be heard in open court, it would defeat the object of the earlier direction. During the hearing on 5 July 2019, I asked counsel to seek instructions on whether S 1085\/2016 ought to be heard in camera. BLL took the view that S 1085\/2016 ought to be heard in camera in order to maintain and preserve the confidentiality of OSF 71\/2011. The defendants left it to the court to decide. I therefore exercise my discretion under s 8(2) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) to direct that S 1085\/2016 be heard in camera. Under O 42 r 2 of the ROC, this judgment is published on terms that the parties\u2019 names and details are redacted.'"}

A zichar restaurant is a stall or restaurant that engages in \u201cChinese style cooking\u201d, which may or may not involve heavy cooking. Parties also agree that it is possible for a zichar stall to be set up as one of the stalls within a food court. 19', '10\\u2003In or around September 2011, Mr Jasper Tan (\u201cJasper\u201d) introduced NES to TKC. Jasper was NES\u2019s insurance agent since 2006 and was well-acquainted with NES and his company. 20', 'On the other hand, Jasper only first met TKC in September 2011. 21', '11\\u2003At their first meeting in September 2011, TKC conducted the marketing presentation at his office and gave NES a brochure of the Development and the floor plan of the Units. TKC testified that he had mentioned to NES that the Units could be used for F&B purposes, for example, as food courts. 22', 'This was because TKC did not see any issue with prospective tenants or purchasers obtaining the relevant approvals to use the units in the Development for F&B purposes, given that some of the other units were previously approved for use as restaurants. 23', 'He also testified to having told NES that if he had plans to run a F&B business, he would have to submit the necessary applications to the authorities to obtain the relevant approvals. 24', 'TKC also testified that he would allow the plaintiff to use the front and back areas of the Units as an ORA, but clarified that when the MCST was formed, the continued usage of the common area as an ORA would be subject to approval by the MCST.', '12\\u2003On the other hand, NES testified that he had informed TKC that he was looking to buy a property to operate a zichar restaurant with the view to sell seafood. NES testified that TKC had replied that he should consider getting a property in the Alexis as it was a mixed development and there were many units on the ground floor that could be used for the operation of a zichar restaurant. When NES asked him whether the units in the Alexis were capable of operation as a zichar restaurant, TKC allegedly replied that it should not be a problem as some of the units on the ground floor were approved or were meant for restaurants of F&B operations. 25', 'TKC also allegedly assured NES that for such an operation, everything was ready. 26', '13\\u2003TKC and NES met a few more times from September 2011 to December 2011. According to NES, the purpose of the meetings was for NES to figure out if the Units could fit into the plaintiff\u2019s plan of operating its Principal Activities, including selling cooked food or zichar which involved heavy cooking. 27', 'Jasper was present at these meetings.', '14\\u2003NES testified that in one of the meetings, NES had told TKC that he was considering purchasing the corner unit #01-01 as he could use the ORA like a beer garden as part of his plan to operate in the evening and sell alcohol. 28', 'In response, TKC allegedly told him that if he had bought two units, he would make arrangements for him to use the ORA. NES then told TKC that he would consider the purchase seriously and revert to him in due course. During all the meetings, NES testified that TKC had never informed NES that the plaintiff had to apply for a change of use of the Units from a \u201cshop\u201d to a \u201crestaurant\u201d with URA. 29', 'Instead, TKC allegedly represented and assured him that he could do his business without any problem. 30', '15\\u2003According to TKC, NES did not express any requirement for the Units to be fitted with an exhaust system or other mechanical, electrical or technical fixtures, particularly required for heavy duty cooking. 31', '16\\u2003After viewing the Units, NES was happy with the Units and expressed interest in purchasing the Units. Sometime in end November 2011, TKC, MP and NES went with the defendant\u2019s staff to the plaintiff\u2019s zichar restaurant at Bedok North to have dinner. 32', 'At the dinner, NES introduced his daughter-in-law and employee, Ms Kelissa Chan (\u201cKC\u201d), to TKC and MP.', '17\\u2003On 14 December 2011, NES handed TKC a cheque for the option money for the purchase of the Units (\u201cFirst Cheque\u201d). TKC did not arrange for the OTPs to be issued to NES and did not tender the First Cheque for payment at the bank because NES requested for TKC to hold off the Units for a day so that he could consult with his wife on the purchase. 33', '18\\u2003At the meeting, NES testified that TKC had repeated the Representations, including the further representations that the Plaintiff (a) could operate a zichar restaurant or food court, and (b) should consider purchasing two units and use the outdoor area as an ORA to increase the sitting capacity of the zichar restaurant or food court. 34', 'TKC also allegedly assured NES that he would ensure that the defendant would carry out and fulfil the Representations. 35', '19\\u2003On 15 December 2011, NES changed his mind and decided to purchase only the unit #01-01. 36', 'The First Cheque was returned to NES and NES handed a replacement cheque to TKC for the option sum for only the unit #01-01 (\u201cSecond Cheque\u201d). At that point, NES commented that he still wanted to persuade his wife to agree to purchasing both the Units instead and requested TKC to hold off the Units from the market, so that he could persuade his wife to purchase both of the Units. 37', 'As such, TKC did not tender the Second Cheque for payment at the bank and no OTP for the unit #01-01 was issued. 38', '20\\u2003Between 15 December 2011 to 13 April 2012, TKC and NES met on a few occasions. NES testified that TKC had repeated the Representations and reassured NES on the purported advantages of purchasing the Units (ie, both units #01-01 and #01-02). 39', 'According to NES, TKC also \u201c[emphasised] what the defendant as the [developer] could do for the plaintiff for the [Units, including] ensuring that the plaintiff could operate a [zichar] restaurant\/food court and also including but not limited to the provision of wooden decking and ORA space\u201d 40', 'and that the plaintiff\u2019s business plan would be better achieved if the Units, which were side by side, were purchased. 41', '21\\u2003About four months later, NES changed his mind and informed TKC of his intention to purchase the Units (ie, both units #01-01 and #01-02). 42', 'On 13 April 2012, NES and KC met with MP to hand him the cheques for payment of the option sum for the Units and to collect the OTPs. 43', 'After some negotiations regarding the final purchase price of the Units, NES was given the OTPs for the Units, accompanied by the defendant\u2019s covering letters dated 13 April 2012 for the Units (\u201cthe Addendums\u201d), which were all in English. As NES was competent only in Hokkien and Mandarin, KC interpreted and explained the contents of the OTPs and the Addendums to NES. 44', 'MP also explained to NES that the SPAs would be sent to NES at a later time as per standard practice, and it would be expedient for NES to appoint his own conveyancing solicitors to assist him to go through the detailed terms of the SPAs for the Units. 45', 'MP highlighted cl 2 and cl 7 of the OTPs to NES:', '22\\u2003At the meeting, KC raised an issue with regards to a clause in the OTPs.

NES acknowledged the insertion of Clause 20M in the SPAs by affixing his signature to the Addendums and the OTPs. 51', 'NES then instructed KC to hand over the last two cheques for the option sum of the Units (\u201cThird Cheque and Fourth Cheque\u201d). 52', 'As such, the OTPs were issued to the plaintiff on 13 April 2012.', '25\\u2003After NES received the OTPs and the Addendums, he instructed his lawyer, Ms Wong, to act for the plaintiff in the purchase. After faxing copies of the OTPs and the Addendums to Ms Wong, Ms Wong highlighted to NES that the Addendums to the OTPs had stated the term \u201cshop\u201d and did not mention anything about the use of the Units as \u201crestaurants\u201d. NES explained the alleged Representations made by TKC and MP detailed in [22], in particular that the term, \u201cshop\u201d, had been represented to him to be purely administrative and that NES could still use the Units to operate a restaurant or maybe a food court. 53', '26\\u2003Ms Wong subsequently advised NES that she would write to the defendant\u2019s solicitor to confirm the above representations.

No further written correspondence was exchanged between the parties.', '28\\u2003NES testified that after being informed of the letters from the defendant\u2019s solicitors, Ms Wong advised him to check with TKC and the defendant if he wished to proceed with the purchase. NES testified that he had contacted TKC for clarifications about Ms Choy\u2019s letters. TKC allegedly reiterated that this was purely administrative and that he should proceed with the purchase, assuring NES that he would have no problem operating a zichar restaurant or food court. 58', 'These actions of TKC will be collectively referred to as \u201cReassurance 2\u201d. NES then informed KC and Ms Wong that he would proceed with the purchase of the Units.', '29\\u2003In accordance with the defendant\u2019s obligations set out in cl 2 of the OTPs, the defendant\u2019s solicitor issued the title deeds and the SPAs in triplicate on 25 April 2012 for both Units. 59', 'On 15 May 2012, the plaintiff proceeded to exercise the OTPs and execute the SPAs, with the Units \u201capproved for use as shops\u201d as stated in Clause 20M. 60', 'It is apposite to note that the plaintiff was independently and legally advised by Ms Wong from the time of the grant of the OTPs to the execution of the SPAs.', '30\\u2003Notably, there are two Building Plans relevant to the present case. The first is Building Plan No.1 (\u201cBP-1\u201d), which was issued in 2009. In BP-1, the commercial units for the Development were labelled as \u201cshop\/restaurant\u201d. 61', 'The second is Building Plan No. 2 (\u201cBP-2\u201d), which was issued on 5 January 2012. In BP-2, the commercial units for the Development were labelled only as \u201cshop\u201d and the word \u201crestaurant\u201d was removed. 62', 'The date of issuance of BP-2 was before the OTPs were granted on 13 April 2012 and before the SPAs were signed on 15 May 2012, meaning that BP-2, not BP-1, applied at that time of the granting of the OTPs and the signing of the SPAs. Most crucially, the Second Schedule of the SPAs made express reference to BP-2. 63', '31\\u2003The TOP for the Development was obtained on 21 May 2012 and the CSC was only granted on 25 February 2013. 64', 'Sometime in end July 2012, the plaintiff engaged a contractor, Seah Gim Wah Construction Pte Ltd, to start renovations and construction of the wooden decking meant for the ORA. 65', 'During the designing and preparatory stage of the plaintiff\u2019s renovations for the plaintiff\u2019s business, NES realised that TKC had not made any arrangements to construct the wooden decking for the walkway for the ORA, as allegedly promised by the defendant. 66', 'NES testified that TKC had informed him that the plaintiff would have to construct its own instead and suggested that the plaintiff propose an initial plan for his approval. 67', 'NES decided \u201cnot to make a fuss as it was a relatively minor issue which [he] could rectify by asking [his] contractor to do so\u201d. 68', '32\\u2003However, one week after the renovations started for the wooden decking, with 11 footings installed in the area for the ORA, MP stopped the plaintiff\u2019s contractors from proceeding with the renovation works. This was because before the plaintiff commenced renovation works in July 2012, the plaintiff had not submitted any renovation plans for the defendant\u2019s approval nor obtained the written permission of URA and it had commenced renovation works before the CSC was issued. According to MP, the structures and wooden decking that the plaintiff was constructing would have delayed the issuance of the CSC as approvals would be required from government authorities such as URA and NEA. 69', 'Without the approval from URA regarding the change of use of the Units, the plaintiff could not proceed to construct the wooden decking for the ORA as the plaintiff was not authorised to do so. 70', 'On the other hand, NES thought that he had purchased the Units on the basis that the area could be converted right away into an ORA which could then be used for the plaintiff\u2019s Principal Activities immediately. 71', 'As of 21 February 2019, the 11 footings remained unremoved. 72', '33\\u2003On 26 July 2012, the plaintiff applied to URA for the change of approved use of the Units from \u201cshop\u201d to \u201crestaurant\u201d. 73', 'On 20 December 2012, the defendant sent a letter to the plaintiff, stating that it had no objections to the plaintiff utilising the open space in the front and the back of the Units, for the purposes of the ORA, subject to the plaintiff obtaining the necessary approvals from the relevant government authorities and there being no complaints received from residents or members of the public arising from the use. The letter also reiterated that the area involved was a common area belonging to the MCST and permission of the MCST would have to be sought once the Development was handed over to the MCST. 74', '34\\u2003On 28 December 2012, URA issued the Grant of Written Permission (Temporary) for the plaintiff\u2019s requested change of use of the Units from \u201cshop\u201d to \u201crestaurant\u201d for a period of two years. On 3 January 2013, the defendant wrote to the plaintiff, once again confirming the contents of the letter stated in the letter on 20 December 2012 (see above at [33)]. 75', '35\\u2003After URA approval was obtained, the plaintiff wanted to resume the construction of the wooden decking but was informed by the defendant that it still had to wait for a year as the green verge surrounding the Development represented in BP-2 (\u201cgreen verge\u201d) was under the purview of National Parks Board (\u201cNPB\u201d) as they controlled the green zoning area and NPB\u2019s approval was required. 76', 'TKC estimated that the timeline would take up to a year and as a result, the plaintiff ceased renovation of the Units. From late 2013 to early 2014, the plaintiff attempted to sell and rent the Units out, but to no avail. 77', 'On 13 November 2014, URA renewed the Grant of Written Permission for the plaintiff to use the Units as \u201crestaurants\/food court\u201d for two more years, which would expire on 28 November 2016. 78', '36\\u2003On 21 January 2015, after the formation of the MCST No. 3926 for the Development, the defendant ceded all its management obligations to the MCST. 79', '37\\u2003At or around June 2015, the plaintiff applied to NEA for a food shop licence. 80', 'The process of applying and obtaining the food shop licence took at least 16 months (from 9 June 2015 to September 2016) and involved multiple appeals. 81', '38\\u2003NEA rejected the plaintiff\u2019s application on 23 July 2015, noting that the exhaust system was unsatisfactory as the plaintiff\u2019s request was to discharge the exhaust fumes at the first level of the Development and the food items declared by the plaintiff involved heavy cooking which would emit fumes, smoke and smell within the premises. NEA explained that: 82', '39\\u2003In or around September 2015, NES asked TKC for contacts for consultants that specialised in exhaust systems. TKC recommended Elead Associates Private (\u201cElead\u201d) who suggested by way of a letter dated 25 September 2015 to NEA, for the relocation of the exhaust point to be at least 5m away from the residential units above the Units and the opening of the exhaust for the food court to be filtered through a clean air filter. 83', 'However, on 12 October 2015, NEA rejected the proposal as the proposed location of the exhaust discharge was \u201cabove the rear shop exit of the first level of the building\u201d and would \u201ccause disamenities to the upper floor residents and those in the nearby residential estates.\u201d 84', 'Elead appealed once more to NEA on 5 November 2015, but was unsuccessful. 85', '40\\u2003Subsequently, in January 2016, the defendant assigned LCY Engineering Pte Ltd to write to NEA on behalf of the plaintiff, and proposed the installation of an Electrostatic Air Cleaner and Ozone Clean System (\u201cElectrostatic System\u201d) to meet NEA\u2019s requirements. However, NEA rejected the proposal to install the Electrostatic System on 28 January 2016 as it would not be able to cope with the cooking fumes in a \u201cChinese\u201d style restaurant where extensive cooking facilities were involved and the flue discharge from the exhaust outlet at level one would affect the residents living above the Units. 86', 'TKC then recommended a consultant, Mr David Wong of B Best Breed Advisory, to the defendant. Mr David Wong made an appeal to NEA to grant the plaintiff a temporary licence to operate and allow the Electrostatic System to be tried out for one year on a pilot scheme. 87', 'On 13 May 2016, NEA agreed to the appeal, subject to the plaintiff\u2019s undertaking dated 12 May 2016, stating that in the event of any nuisance, the plaintiff would seek to resolve all issues relating to the nuisance. The undertaking also stated that where the plaintiff was unable to rectify the issues, the plaintiff understood that the food shop licence would be revoked, and the plaintiff would have to cease business immediately and dismantle the new system. 88', 'As such, the plaintiff replaced the existing system with the Electrostatic System. On 2 June 2016, the defendant wrote to the plaintiff to confirm that it would subsidise $64,200 of the costs of the Electrostatic System to be installed by LCY Engineering Pte Ltd. 89', '41\\u2003On 21 September 2016, NEA eventually granted the plaintiff the food shop licence which was approved with terms and conditions attached: the plaintiff could use the premises as a restaurant but the plaintiff was not allowed to do heavy cooking unless the plaintiff could comply with NEA\u2019s regulations and if not, the food shop licence would be revoked. 90', '42\\u2003In October 2016, the plaintiff commenced business operations in only the unit #01-01 with no heavy cooking. 91', 'However, in the middle of November 2016, the plaintiff commenced heavy cooking operations. In December 2016 and January 2017, NEA notified the plaintiff of public complaints relating to the cooking fumes emanating from its business. Further, NEA inspected the plaintiff\u2019s business twice a week. 92', 'On March 2017, there was a meeting held on-site with NEA to inspect the situation at unit #01-01 of the Alexis and to discuss further rectification of the problem. On 24 April 2017, NEA sent the plaintiff a letter of warning pertaining to public complaints received regarding the smell nuisance from the plaintiff\u2019s business, which was affecting the residents living above the Units. In the letter, NEA noted that their inspections revealed that the cooking smell could be detected from the outlet of the plaintiff\u2019s exhaust system. The letter warned the plaintiff to \u201cresolve the smell nuisance failing which [NEA] would be compelled to revoke [the plaintiff\u2019s] food shop licence\u201d. 93', 'NES was worried about the uncertainty of when NEA would issue the notice for termination for his business and decided to close his business in September 2017. 94', 'It is noteworthy that there was no formal closure notice or revocation of licence issued by NEA, before the plaintiff closed his business. 95'"}

Two other charges for voluntarily causing hurt to a public servant under s 332 of the Penal Code were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing.', '7\\u2003All five offences took place at St James Power Station located at 3 Sentosa Gateway between 5.55am and 6.05am on 3 July 2016. The appellant shouted at the top of her voice and gestured wildly at another group of party-goers. This attracted the attention of Sgt Nasharhrudin bin Fasulludi (\u201cSgt Din\u201d), who told the appellant to calm down. However, she continued shouting and behaving in a disorderly manner.

{"casename":"2019_SGHC_212","fact":"'5\\u2003The defendants were the owners of a group of companies (\u201cthe Group\u201d), of which the second plaintiff, BTO, is the principal holding company. BTO is an online travel agency incorporated in Malaysia. On 26 September 2012, the defendants, along with two other owners of the Group entered into a Share and Purchase Agreement (\u201cthe SPA\u201d) with the first plaintiff, BTN. BTN is a publicly listed company, incorporated in Mauritius. Pursuant to the SPA, BTN acquired 100% ownership and control of the Group on both the shareholder and board level.', '6\\u2003The consideration for the acquisition was made up of two elements: the Guaranteed Minimum Consideration of US$25m and the Earn Out Consideration. The latter element depended on the financial performance of the Group in financial years 2013, 2014 and 2015, calibrated based on the different levels of Earn Out Targets for each financial year as specified in the SPA, up to a maximum amount of US$35m.', '7\\u2003The SPA also stipulated that the defendants had to be employed by BTO. The employments of the defendants (\u201cthe Employees\u201d) were governed by the respective Promoter Employment Agreements (\u201cPEAs\u201d), unsigned versions of which had been annexed to the SPA. Pursuant to the PEAs signed in November 2012, BTP, the first defendant, was employed as the Chief Executive Officer and BTQ, the second defendant, as the Chief Technical Officer. The PEAs were signed by the respective employees, and BTO as the employer and BTN as the confirming party. Both the SPA and PEAs contained materially identical provisions as to the Employees\u2019 \u201cWith Cause\u201d and \u201cWithout Cause\u201d termination. Clause 15.1.2 in both PEAs, governing without-cause termination, stated:', '8\\u2003The Company referred to in the PEAs was BTO, and the reference to cl 12.9.3 of the SPA should be a reference to cl 12.9.2 instead, and this is not disputed. Clause 12.9.2 of the SPA provides that the consequence of a without-cause termination was that BTN was to pay the Employees an amount equal to 100% of the Earn Out Consideration Tranche that would have been payable to them for the unpaid term of the Earn Out Period, assuming achievement of a percentage level of Earn Out Targets equal to 100% for the remaining financial years in the Earn Out Period. This means that on the facts, if the dismissals of the Employees were without cause, then they would be entitled to US$35m. Whereas if the dismissals were with cause, then they would not be entitled to any Earn Out Consideration.', '9\\u2003Without-cause termination was termination for reasons other than those justifying a with-cause termination. With-cause termination was defined in cl 12.9.1 of the SPA and cl 15.2.1 of the PEAs. The relevant grounds for with-cause termination in the PEAs (mirroring the grounds set out at cl 12.9.1 of the SPA) were as follows:', 'EBITDA was defined in the SPA as \u201cearnings (positive or negative) from operations of the [Group], in relation to the Business before interest, tax, depreciation and ammortisation for a Financial Year, determined on the basis of the Audited Accounts\u201d.', '10\\u2003The dispute resolution clause (cl 18.4) and the jurisdiction clause (cl 18.5.1) in the PEAs were as follows:', '11\\u2003The dispute resolution clause in the SPA (cll 17.4(a), (b) and (c)) is substantially the same as cll 18.4.1, 18.4.2 and 18.4.3 of the PEAs. However, the governing law and jurisdiction clause under the SPA is different:', '12\\u2003On 8 January 2014, BTO gave notices to the Employees, summarily dismissing them \u201cpursuant to Clause 15.2.1 of the [PEA] and Clause 12.9.1 of the [SPA]\u201d. The letters were written \u201cwith reference to the [SPA]... and the [respective PEA]\u201d, and cited the four grounds of with-cause termination at [9] above. In relation to ground under cl 15.2.1(viii), the termination notices stated that the Employees had \u201cacknowledged and agreed that [BTO] [would] not achieve positive EBITDA for 2013\u201d and \u201cthe audited accounts, once they [were] prepared, [would] also inevitably demonstrate this to be the case\u201d. As for the other three grounds, various reasons were cited in the termination letter sent to BTP, including his failure to properly manage BTO\u2019s cash flows, his misrepresentation to the board of directors in respect of accurate reporting on the quantum of fraud costs, and the taking of excessive, abrupt and\/or inappropriately timed holiday leaves. The letters also reminded the Employees that subsequent to the termination of their employment, they continued to be bound by the SPA and the surviving provisions of the PEAs.', '13\\u2003In response, the Employees commenced proceedings under s 20 of the Industrial Relations Act 1967 (Act 177) (Malaysia) (the \u201cIRA\u201d). This provision allows a workman, defined as any person employed under a contract of employment, who considers that he has been dismissed without just cause or excuse to complain to the Director General of Industrial Relations. The Director General may direct attendance at a conference for the purposes of settlement. Where he is satisfied that there is no prospect of a settlement, he is to notify the Minister for Industrial Relations, who may, if he thinks fit, refer the matter to the Malaysian Industrial Court (\u201cMIC\u201d). Section 20 states:', '14\\u2003Under s 29(g) of the IRA, the MIC has power to do \u201call such things as are necessary or expedient for the expeditious determination of the matter before it\u201d. The IRA provides a right of appeal to the High Court of Malaysia on a question of law. The MIC may make an order directing any party to comply with an award pursuant to a complaint of non-compliance, and failure to comply with the order is a criminal offence (s 56 of the IRA).', '15\\u2003Following the statutory process, the Employees and BTO (represented by Mr K, a director of BTN and BTO) attended the mandatory conciliation meeting. However, no settlement was reached and the cases were referred to the MIC. The notice of the referral was sent by the Director General to the Employees and BTO. The MIC adjourned the hearings of the cases multiple times due to the absence of BTO and it sent BTO multiple notices of the proceedings by registered post. In the meantime, the Employees filed their statements of case, in which they stated the alleged grounds of their dismissals and denied the allegations. They exhibited the SPA, their respective PEAs and respective notices of termination. They sought for a declaration that their terminations of employment were without just cause and excuse and sought to be reinstated to their former positions.', '16\\u2003BTO was directed to file a reply to the claims. Again, it failed to respond and engage with the proceedings. BTO claimed before the Tribunal and in OS 683 that the notices had been concealed by one of its employees. BTO subsequently conducted an inquiry and dismissed the employee. In any case, it is not disputed that the notices were properly served on BTO.', '17\\u2003After BTO\u2019s lack of response to the multiple notices sent, the MIC proceeded to hear the Employees\u2019 claims in the absence of BTO. Documentary evidence, as included in the statements of case, was before the MIC. The Employees were represented by counsel, and they were called as witnesses to give evidence. The MIC gave judgment in their favour on 6 April 2015 and 29 July 2015 respectively (\u201cthe MIC Awards\u201d). The MIC declined to order reinstatement but awarded compensation for lost salary. In the award in relation to BTQ, Mr N (name redacted), the Chairman of the MIC, after setting out the background facts and the four grounds of dismissal, held that the burden of proof was on BTO to establish the allegations against BTQ on a balance of probabilities. He held as follows:', '18\\u2003In the award in relation to BTP, Mrs R (name redacted), also the Chairman of the MIC, held as follows:', '19\\u2003Subsequent to the MIC Awards, repeated letters from the Employees to BTO demanding payment of the compensation were ignored. The Employees commenced non-compliance proceedings against BTO, and in the adjourned hearing, BTO finally appeared through its counsel. It initially wanted to challenge the MIC Awards but decided to make full compensation to the Employees. BTO claimed that the employee that had concealed the notices finally notified BTO\u2019s management of the notices on 16 February 2016, just before the non-compliance hearing. By then, it was about seven months after the MIC Awards were delivered, and after the three-month period for seeking judicial review of the MIC Awards (although the Employees claim that an extension of time could have been applied for).'"}

Wan explained that the purpose of the LOC was to \nprovide financing to the plaintiff to procure equipment for the M&E sub-\ncontract.\n10 Initially, things went according to plan. In the course of the works, the \nplaintiff obtained an advance payment of $100,000 from JDK, as well as direct \npayment by the defendant to one equipment supplier in the sum of $107,094.7 \nHowever after this, the plaintiff was not able to obtain any further financial \nassistance. Wan said that he had to secure the necessary financing, including \ntaking out loans, to procure the rest of the equipment. Works continued and by \nearly April 2018, the entire sub-contract was about 95% completed. In addition, \nthe plaintiff had completed variation orders (\u201cVO\u201d) for which the plaintiff \nsubmitted invoices totalling about $437,000.8 Wan agreed that all $600,000 \nworth of equipment had been delivered and installed and this sum had been \nincorporated in the 16 progress claims submitted by the plaintiff up to \nApril 2018. On 24 April 2018, the defendant terminated the sub-contract with \nJDK, purportedly on account of delay to the works, including M&E works. JDK \nand its sub-contractors, including the plaintiff, were locked out of the site.\n11 Although Wan claimed that Pauline had told him that the defendant \nwould provide the LOC, the details are hazy and he did not set out exactly what \nPauline had told him. It is also unclear who else was present at the meeting and \nwhen it occurred. What is more important is that in replies filed by the plaintiff \n7 1 PB 128-129. \n8 Wan\u2019s AEIC, p 25. \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nWinstech Engineering Pte Ltd v Shanghai Chong Kee [2019] SGHC 213\nFurniture & Construction Pte Ltd\n5to further and better particulars (\u201cF&BP\u201d) requested by the defendant, the \nplaintiff, in answer to the question \u201cwhether the Alleged Agreement was made \nin writing, orally and or by conduct\u2026\u201d, replied that the agreement was made in \nwriting.9 And to the question \u201cif the Alleged Agreement was orally made or \nagreed upon who were the persons involved in and the date(s) of the relevant \nconversation\u201d, the plaintiff replied that this was \u201cnot applicable\u201d.10 Subsequent \nto the filing of this response to the F&BP, the plaintiff amended its SOC. \nHowever, not only did the plaintiff fail to amend the F&BP, Wan actually \nreaffirmed it by incorporating those replies in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief. \nHe also confirmed during cross-examination that the plaintiff took the position \nthat there was no oral contract between the parties.\n12 It is also telling that the plaintiff\u2019s requests for financing were made to \nJDK, rather than the defendant.11 These requests related not just to the LOC but \nalso to requests for payment for the VO works.12 It is clear that the plaintiff \nconsidered these outstanding sums to be payable by JDK. This puts paid to the \nplaintiff\u2019s case that the defendant had a binding contractual obligation to the \nplaintiff to provide the plaintiff with up to $600,000 LOC.\n13 I should add that the plaintiff\u2019s position in relation to the LOC is rather \nconfused. Wan agreed that the LOC was provided in the Contract for the \npurpose of enabling him to procure the $600,000 worth of equipment that the \nplaintiff was to install under the Contract. Financing was provided to the \n9 Wan\u2019s AEIC, p 10. \n10 Ibid. \n11 1 PB 49-50, 59-60; Defendant\u2019s Closing Submissions, paras 48-49. \n12 See for eg, 1 PB 119. \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nWinstech Engineering Pte Ltd v Shanghai Chong Kee [2019] SGHC 213\nFurniture & Construction Pte Ltd\n6plaintiff on two instances amounting to a total of $207,094. But it stopped after \nthat. To the plaintiff\u2019s credit, it was able to procure other sources of financing \nto secure the delivery of the remainder of the equipment to the site, and to \ncomplete 95% of the works under the Contract. Yet, the plaintiff is not claiming \nfor damages for the failure to provide the balance of the LOC which, under the \ncircumstances, would be the financing costs it incurred to procure the remainder \nof the equipment. Its claim appears to be cash, in the sum of the balance of the \nLOC, ie, $392,906.13 Such a claim is wholly misconceived. Even if the \ndefendant were the party obliged to provide the plaintiff with the LOC, the \nplaintiff\u2019s claim should be for the damages sustained from the failure to provide \nthe LOC.\nRemaining claims \n14 The SOC also claims for outstanding progress payments of about \n$465,000 as well as VO claims of about $437,000.14 There is no basis for these \nclaims as they arise from the Contract which is between the plaintiff and JDK. \nCertainly in relation to the outstanding progress payments of $465,000, the \nplaintiff has not pleaded as to how this was incurred. Paragraphs one to nine of \nthe SOC plead to the $600,000 LOC and the $437,000 in VO claims. Paragraph \n10 of the SOC then states that:\nAs a result of the above the Plaintiffs suffered losses and \ndamages \u2026 as follows:\ni. outstanding progress payments at S$465,767.25;\nii.  Variation Orders payments at S$437,440.21\niii. outstanding Line of Credit at S$392,906\/-\n13 Statement of Claim (Amendment No 1), para 10(iii).\n14 Statement of Claim (Amendment No 1), paras 10(i) and (ii); Wan\u2019s AEIC, para 12.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nWinstech Engineering Pte Ltd v Shanghai Chong Kee [2019] SGHC 213\nFurniture & Construction Pte Ltd\n7iv. other costs:\n15 It is clear from this that the plaintiff has not stated its case in relation to \nthe $465,000 in outstanding progress payments. As for the VOs, the plaintiff \nhas not produced any VO in evidence. Prima facie, these would have been \nissued by the architect to defendant, who, pursuant to its sub-contract with JDK, \nwould have passed it on to JDK who in turn would have passed it on to the \nplaintiff pursuant to the Contract. The plaintiff has not produced any evidence \nto prove its claim for the VOs. In any event, the plaintiff\u2019s involvement in the \nProject is as the sub-contractor of JDK and therefore, prima facie, the plaintiff\u2019s \nexecution of the VOs would be carried out pursuant to the Contract. It is \ntherefore JDK that is liable to the plaintiff in respect of the VOs (and for that \nmatter, in respect of the outstanding progress payments as well). The plaintiff \nhas not produced any evidence to displace this position. In fact, as I have alluded \nto above, it appears that the plaintiff was cognisant of this fact.\n16 Finally, the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses placed much reliance on instructions \ngiven to them by Mr Jonathan Liow (\u201cLiow\u201d) and Mr Darryl Lim (\u201cLim\u201d).15 \nThere is no dispute that Liow and Lim were employees of JDK. The plaintiff\u2019s \nwitnesses said that as Liow and Lim had attended site meetings as \nrepresentatives of the defendant, and in fact had email addresses with the \ndefendant\u2019s domain names in addition to the domain name of JDK, the plaintiff \nhad considered that their instructions emanated from the defendant. I accept the \ndefendant\u2019s evidence that it is normal in the situation where party A has sub-\ncontracted the entire building works to party B, party B would represent party \nA in all dealings with the employer and his consultants. It would therefore be \n15 Wan\u2019s AEIC, pp 12-14. \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nWinstech Engineering Pte Ltd v Shanghai Chong Kee [2019] SGHC 213\nFurniture & Construction Pte Ltd\n8normal for JDK\u2019s personnel to attend site meetings and attend to the consultants \nas the defendant\u2019s representatives. However as between JDK and the plaintiff, \nthe Contract clearly sets out their contractual relationship. I do not believe the \nassertions of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses that they were misled into thinking that \ninstructions from Liow and Lim were instructions from the defendant and not \nfrom JDK.\nConclusion \n17 The plaintiff\u2019s claims are therefore dismissed. Unless there is any \nreason, such as the existence of an offer to settle, to make a different order, I \norder costs to be paid by the plaintiff to the defendant fixed at $100,000, \ninclusive of disbursements.\nLee Seiu Kin \nJudge\nK V Sudeep Kumar (S K Kumar Law Practice LLP) for the plaintiff;\nChia Swee Chye Kelvin and Bernard Tan (Lumen Law Corporation) \nfor the defendant.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)"}
{"casename":"2019_SGHC_214","fact":"'1\\u2003The present decision arises from the taking of accounts in Suit No 549 of 2015. On 15 May 2017, I gave my decision in the main suit and found in favour of the plaintiffs. Unfortunately, the plaintiffs have struggled to recover the moneys which were the subject matter of my judgment.', '2\\u2003The plaintiffs are the executors of the Estate of Dr Paul Freda Malliamalar (\u201cDr Paul\u201d), and were previously her court-appointed deputies. Dr Paul was a paediatrician at the Singapore General Hospital and taught at the University of Singapore (now the National University of Singapore). She passed away on 6 August 2016 at the age of 87 years.', '3\\u2003While Dr Paul was alive, she lived in a property at Haig Road (\u201cthe Haig Road property\u201d) for many years. The first defendant, Mr Kulandaivelu Malayaperumal (\u201cPerumal\u201d) was employed as a construction worker sometime in 2001 and worked on a building adjacent to the Haig Road property. Perumal carried out some repair jobs for Dr Paul and befriended her. He eventually moved in to the Haig Road property with Dr Paul sometime around mid-2009 and played a role in the sale of the property and the purchase of a second property at Ceylon Road. In 2010, two cash gifts were made by Dr Paul to Perumal totalling a sum of $2 million. I held in the main suit that Dr Paul had no mental capacity to make the gift of $2 million to Perumal, finding also that Perumal had exerted influence over Dr Paul and hindered her independence in decision-making.', '4\\u2003Perumal married the first non-party, Mdm Pramela d\/o Govindasamy (\u201cMdm Pramela\u201d) in November 2010. As the plaintiffs seek an order against the Housing and Development Board (\u201cHDB\u201d) flat jointly owned by Perumal and Mdm Pramela (\u201cthe HDB flat\u201d), she has entered an appearance as a non-party. Given the possible implications of this decision on HDB flats, the HDB has also entered an appearance as a non-party.', '5\\u2003The HDB flat is presently held in the names of Perumal and Mdm Pramela as joint tenants. Both of them were granted the option to purchase the flat in 2011, and completion took place on 30 April 2014 for a sale price of $439,800. This payment was made in several tranches:', '(a)\\u2003Down-payment of $43,960 from Mdm Pramela\u2019s CPF account;', '(b)\\u2003$66,465 from Mdm Pramela\u2019s CPF account; and', '(c)\\u2003$329,812.55 by cheque.', '6\\u2003On the date of completion on 30 April 2014, Perumal made a payment of $329,812.55 by cheque to HDB. This sum amounted to at least 74.99% of the purchase price of the flat. It constitutes a meagre 16% of the $2 million that Dr Paul had given to Perumal.', '7\\u2003The plaintiffs sought to establish either an institutional or a remedial constructive trust over the interest represented by the sum of $329,812.55 in the HDB Flat.', '8\\u2003I heard the trial for the taking of accounts and was satisfied that the sum of $329,812.55 used to pay for the purchase of the HDB flat was moneys Perumal received from Dr Paul. Perumal had initially maintained that the contribution which came from Dr Paul\u2019s money amounted only to $175,000. However, the documents showed that Perumal had made a payment of the sum of $329,812.55 to the HDB on 30 April 2014. From Perumal\u2019s OCBC bank account statements, it was clear that he had earlier transferred a sum of $300,000 on 29 January 2014 into Mdm Pramela\u2019s bank account. This same sum was transferred back into his OCBC bank account on 30 April 2014. Perumal did not fully disclose and provide the relevant information to the court. The plaintiffs had to seek the assistance of court orders in order to obtain the disclosures of his bank statements and other relevant information. His bank statements also show large sums of moneys being transferred about \u2013 for example, $100,000 was withdrawn on 6 February 2012, another $100,000 was withdrawn on 8 February 2012, $100,000 was deposited on 8 November 2012, $50,000 was withdrawn on 12 December 2012 and $100,000 was withdrawn on 10 June 2013. Perumal was not cooperative in giving disclosure and explanation for the large movements of moneys. Considering the evidence as a whole, I find that the sum of $329,812.55 was moneys Perumal received from Dr Paul.', '9\\u2003At the hearing, I asked if the equitable lien might be applicable here and directed further submissions on the matter. I also appointed Mr Jamal Siddique Peer as the young amicus curiae to assist in the various legal issues presented by the current case.

He also moved the body into a nearby drain where it continued to burn. On 19 July 2016, Leslie was interviewed by the police and placed under arrest the next day.', '28\\u2003Dr Lee, a pathologist, testified on the three possible mechanisms of death involved in compression of the neck (such as by using a hand). 10', 'These were:', '(a)\\u2003occlusion of the carotid arteries, which would cut off oxygen supply to the brain if there was a complete bilateral occlusion of the carotid arteries on both sides of the neck, and thus result in immediate unconsciousness;', '(b)\\u2003occlusion of the airway, either by direct compression of the larynx or trachea, which would cut off oxygen supply to the lungs and the rest of the body; and', '(c)\\u2003the carotid sinus reflex \u2013 this involved compression of the carotid sinus receptors leading to sending of signals to the heart that could cause cardiac arrhythmia and cardiac arrest.', '29\\u2003The former two mechanisms would result in death within minutes, while the carotid sinus reflex could cause death instantaneously or within seconds. It was possible to achieve the occlusion of the carotid arteries or airway using one hand to compress a person\u2019s neck. As all three structures (viz, the carotid arteries, the airway and the carotid sinus receptors) may be compressed during compression of the neck, it is often not possible to identify the mechanism at play in individual cases.

The struck off companies were:', 'This triggered s 155A(1) and formed the basis for the plaintiff\u2019s disqualification.', '13\\u2003The relevant provisions in s 344 of the Act provide that:', '14\\u2003Similar to his responsibilities vis-\u00e0-vis the defendant, the plaintiff was a resident nominee director of Spartan Trading Pte Ltd (\u201cSpartan Trading\u201d) and Mango Games Pte Ltd (\u201cMango Games\u201d), acting on the instructions of Camford\u2019s clients. The corporate secretarial functions for these companies were also carried out by Camford\u2019s corporate secretarial executive, who reported to Mr Natarajan as the company secretary for both these companies. 11', '15\\u2003At this stage, I should briefly highlight the circumstances which led to Spartan Trading and Mango Games being struck off the register. According to ACRA, since their incorporation, the annual returns for Spartan Trading and Mango Games had not been filed for three years and four years respectively. 12', 'It is undisputed that the plaintiff had been unable to ensure the filing of these returns because of a lack of instructions from one of Camford\u2019s foreign clients, Sand Hill Counsel (\u201cSand Hill\u201d). Sand Hill is a foreign law firm which had instructed Camford in relation to Spartan Trading and Mango Games.', '16\\u2003From July to October 2015, Mr Natarajan repeatedly wrote to Sand Hill requesting for instructions in relation to the two companies. The foreign lawyers were asked for the \u201caction plan\u201d in relation to the companies, that is, what was going to be done to finalise the accounts of the companies before taking steps to wind them up or otherwise. 13', 'In December 2015, Mr Natarajan made it clear to Sand Hill that, with recent changes to the law in Singapore, the plaintiff could face repercussions if Singapore filing and regulatory requirements were not complied with. Mr Natarajan warned that Camford would have little choice but to inform ACRA that the overseas directors and shareholders for Spartan Trading and Mango Games were not contactable. 14', 'There was no substantive response from Sand Hill, who in turn was unable to reach the overseas directors and shareholders of the two companies. 15', '17\\u2003In September 2016, the plaintiff wrote to Sand Hill four times to explain that he wished to be replaced as a nominee director of Mango Games, given the lack of any action by Sand Hill or the ultimate clients to regularise the outstanding filings. 16', 'It appears that he had been informed that Spartan Trading was going to be struck off the register imminently. He could not resign by reason of s 145(1) of Act \u2013 Spartan Trading and Mango Games required at least one locally resident director. With no replacement director having been nominated to take his place, the plaintiff was in a bind. As he wrote in an email to Sand Hill on 13 September 2016, it was \u201c[b]est\u2026to have [the] client\u2019s concrete action plan because I do not have options at this stage\u201d. 17', '18\\u2003Without further instructions from Sand Hill or their clients, Spartan Trading was struck off the register on 4 October 2016. Sand Hill continued to face difficulties in obtaining instructions from their clients in respect of Mango Games. In fact, Camford only received instructions in late January 2017 that Mango Games\u2019 board of directors was reviewing the plans for the company and would decide whether to revive the business or wind up the company. 18', 'Mr Natarajan informed ACRA of the same on 23 January 2017. 19', 'ACRA responded on 26 January 2017 to state that a director had to lodge an objection against the striking off. But, Camford could not get instructions from Sand Hill as to whether their clients wished to lodge the objection and the reasons to be given.', '19\\u2003The plaintiff left Camford\u2019s employ shortly thereafter in February 2017. He was consequently not privy to further developments although his understanding was that Mr Natarajan continued to chase Sand Hill for instructions. Evidently, these instructions were not forthcoming and Mango Games was struck off the register in March 2017.', '20\\u2003I now come back to the defendant, which was struck off the register on 4 December 2017 by the Registrar under s 344 of the Act.', '21\\u2003Section 344D of the Act provides that a former director or former member of a company that has been struck off the register under s 344 may apply to the Registrar for the name of the company to be restored to the register. This is an alternative to an application to court under s 344(5) of the Act for restoration.', '22\\u2003On 7 and 8 August 2018, three applications for such \u201cadministrative restoration\u201d were taken out jointly by the plaintiff and two of the former directors and members of the defendant, Mr Sriwastawa Sharad Kumar (\u201cMr Sriwastawa\u201d) and Mr Bhatia Vinod Kumar (\u201cMr Bhatia\u201d). These applications were made pursuant to s 344D of the Act on the basis that, inter alia, the \u201ccompany was at the time of striking off, carrying on business or was in operation\u201d, 20', 'which is a ground for restoration under Regulation 6 of the Companies (Striking Off) Regulations 2015. Mr Natarajan acted on behalf of Mr Sriwastawa and Mr Bhatia.', '23\\u2003In support of these applications, certain documents were submitted to ACRA to demonstrate that the defendant had conducted financial transactions during the financial year of 2017. 21', 'This was notwithstanding the fact that annual returns had not been filed for three years. Evidence of financial activity demonstrated that the defendant remained a going concern, and had a live business.', '24\\u2003On 13 September 2018, the plaintiff wrote to ACRA to enquire as to the status of the defendant\u2019s restoration. He was informed that ACRA required details as to who the defendant intended to appoint as its locally resident director in the event that it was restored. 22', 'In response, Mr Natarajan then wrote to ACRA to confirm that another local resident director, besides the plaintiff, would be appointed. Given that he would have no future involvement with the defendant, the plaintiff left the application for administrative restoration to Mr Natarajan and the latter\u2019s clients, and he did not pursue his own application.', '25\\u2003On 8 October 2018, Mr Sriwastawa\u2019s and Mr Bhatia\u2019s applications were approved and the defendant was restored to the register under s 344E(2) of the Act. 23', 'Section 344E provides that, if the Registrar\u2019s decision is that the name of the company is to be restored to the register, the restoration takes effect from the date he gives notice to the applicant of his decision.', '26\\u2003On 10 October 2018, the plaintiff wrote to ACRA to enquire as to the status of his disqualification under s 155A of the Act. On 12 October 2018, ACRA informed the plaintiff that his disqualification would remain. It set out its explanation, premised on its interpretation of s 155A, in its email 24', ':', '27\\u2003On 6 December 2018, the plaintiff filed the present originating summons seeking relief that he should be placed in the same position, as nearly may be, as a director as if the defendant had not been struck off, and also for a declaration that he is not disqualified under s 155A of the Act from acting as a director. 25', 'This was pursuant to s 344G(1) and (3) of the Act, which states:', '28\\u2003Although the defendant had initially intended to appoint another local director following its restoration (see [24] above), the defendant\u2019s shareholders subsequently expressed their support for the plaintiff to continue as director. 26', 'On 13 December 2018, the plaintiff also received a letter from the current director and shareholder of the defendant, Ms Ramani Baggialakshmi, confirming that the defendant had no objections to the plaintiff\u2019s present application in this originating summons. 27', 'The defendant did not appoint counsel to appear in the proceedings before me.', '29\\u2003The plaintiff subsequently amended his application to add an alternative relief, that is, he also sought leave under s 155A(3) of the Act to continue acting as a director, or to be allowed to be a director, of several companies, including Oxon, in which he had been a director at the time he was informed of his disqualification. He had not acted as a director nor had he carried out the roles and responsibilities of a director in respect of these companies since he had been given notice of his disqualification. 28', '30\\u2003This had placed several limitations on the plaintiff. Most significantly, he could not act as a director of Oxon, his current law practice, and Oxon Global Pte Ltd, Oxon\u2019s subsidiary. This prevented him from pitching for legal projects, pursuing banking facilities for Oxon and from approving compliance related statutory filings with ACRA and the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore on behalf of Oxon. 29', 'At the time of the hearing, there were also concerns over the plaintiff\u2019s ability to renew his practising certificate. 30', '31\\u2003A copy of the plaintiff\u2019s application was served on the intervener. It then applied for and was granted leave to intervene in this originating summons because it wished to object to the plaintiff\u2019s application. After the addition of the alternative relief sought under s 155A(3) as described at [29], counsel for the intervener informed the Assistant Registrar, who granted leave to amend, that they should also be regarded as also acting for the Minster for Finance as he should be a respondent to an application under s 155A(3) even though he was not added as a party. Parties were happy to proceed on that basis.'"}

{"casename":"2019_SGHC_221","fact":"Background\n4 The facts are drawn from the statement of facts to which the appellant \nadmitted without qualification (the \u201cStatement of Facts\u201d). \n5 The appellant was formerly an insurance agent. He is a Myanmar \nnational, and also a Singapore permanent resident. During the course of his \nemployment as an insurance agent, the appellant became upset with several of \nhis clients who failed to turn up for scheduled appointments with him, or had \ntaken steps to cancel insurance policies that they had purchased from him. He \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nYe Lin Myint v PP[2019] SGHC 221\n3was also upset with prospective clients who had met with him but eventually \ndecided not to purchase insurance policies from him. The appellant became \ndisgruntled and angry, and felt that these persons had treated him badly and had \ndisrespected him. In revenge, the appellant decided to embark on a campaign of \ncriminal intimidation against them. \nThe s 507 PC charges\n6 The appellant did this by means of communications which took the form \nof letters and emails. These were the subject of the five proceeded charges under \ns 507 PC. Four of the communications were sent as initiating communications \nwhere the appellant reached out to the recipients for the first time, while the \nremaining one was sent to follow up on an earlier communication.  \n7 The former category comprised fairly lengthy and detailed \ncommunications which contained essentially the same elements. First, the \nappellant addressed the recipient by name, demonstrating his familiarity with \nthem. Second, the appellant adopted a false identity, varying from a single \nparent with a single sick child, to a single parent caring for three young children. \nThird, the appellant declared that he was desperate and in need of the recipient\u2019s \nhelp. Fourth, the appellant further reinforced his familiarity with the recipient\u2019s \nlife, by asserting that he knew where they lived and worked and that he \n\u201cbasically\u2026 [knew] everything about [them]\u201d. In one of these communications, \nhe also mentioned accurate details about the recipient\u2019s life by naming the \nrecipient\u2019s workplace and identifying the recipient\u2019s daughter. Fifth, the \nappellant declared that this was only \u201cStage 1, introduction\u201d and threatened that \nhe would move on to \u201cstage 2, 3, and so on\u201d, with the recipient\u2019s life getting \n\u201cmore miserable\u201d with the advancing stages. Sixth, the appellant threatened to \nhumiliate the recipient, or make him or her jobless, or destroy his or her \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nYe Lin Myint v PP[2019] SGHC 221\n4reputation, or even physically harm the recipient or the recipient\u2019s family \nmembers. Seventh, the appellant demanded that the recipient transfer him 1 \nBitcoin at a specific wallet address. Eighth, the appellant asserted that reporting \nthe matter to the police would be futile, and reminded the recipient that he was \n\u201cdesperate\u201d and that the recipient had been specifically targeted. In this regard, \nhe explicitly stated that \u201c[he was] already inside and [the recipient] [could] not \ndo anything to stop [him]\u201d. Finally, the appellant signed off under the \npseudonym of \u201cLord Voldermort [sic]\u201d. \n8 As regards the final email, the appellant targeted a recipient who had \npreviously received one of his earlier threatening communications. In this later \nemail, the appellant threatened that things would get worse for the recipient, \nbecause up to this point his actions had only been \u201cwarm ups\u201d. The appellant in \nthe email in question threatened the recipient and his wife with irreversible \nattacks that would \u201cdestroy [the recipient\u2019s] life and reputation\u201d, and demanded \nan increased amount of 1.5 Bitcoin. \n9 Each of the recipients of these communications felt alarmed by the \ncommunications and made a police report. For convenience, I refer to these \nindividuals as the \u201cfirst set of victims\u201d. The appellant explained that he had sent \nout these threatening letters and emails because he wanted the first set of victims \nto know that it was \u201cnot nice to do bad things to people who did not do anything \nto them\u201d. He had obtained the personal details used in the letters from his \ninteractions with the victims, who were either his clients or prospective clients.\n10 The communications which were the subject of the five proceeded \ncharges were received on various dates between 16 August and 4 September \n2017. The five communications that were the subject of the five TIC charges \nwere received between 23 August and 7 September 2017. \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nYe Lin Myint v PP[2019] SGHC 221\n5The POHA charges\n11 Some time after the appellant commenced this first spate of criminal \nbehaviour, he came across a news article about unlicensed moneylenders \nharassing debtors for failing to repay their debts. He learnt from this article that \nin order to pressure the debtors to make payments, the moneylenders would \nresort to harassing the debtors\u2019 neighbours. The appellant took perverse \ninspiration from this article, and decided to harass not only the first set of \nvictims, but also the neighbours and family members of those individuals. I refer \nto this latter category of individuals as \u201cthe second set of victims\u201d. \n12 The appellant did not personally know any of the second set of victims. \nInstead, he randomly targeted these individuals and identified their addresses \nusing Google searches. \n13 The contents of these communications were more varied than those \nwhich are the subject of the s 507 charges. In most of these communications, \nthe appellant falsely represented to the recipients that one of the first set of \nvictims was indebted to him. The appellant threatened the recipients with the \nprospect of his harassing their homes or workplaces, if they did not persuade \nthe person concerned from the first set of victims to pay him what he was owed. \nSome of these communications went into graphic detail, such as warning of the \nrecipient\u2019s \u201cgate [being] on fire or red paint all over [the recipient\u2019s] unit\u201d. \nOthers also raised the prospect of physical harm to the recipient\u2019s family. In one \nparticularly troubling letter, the appellant threatened the recipient with \u201cattacks\u201d \nthat would \u201cleave [her] and [her] husband with scars in [her] life that are \nirreversible\u201d. And in another, the appellant threatened to \u201cdestroy [the \nrecipient\u2019s] reputation, [her] career and [her] life within a month\u201d. Although the \nappellant did not know most of these individuals, he nevertheless made efforts \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nYe Lin Myint v PP[2019] SGHC 221\n6to personalise the threats. For example, he cautioned one victim against thinking \nthat he would be safe because he lived in private property. The appellant signed \noff as either \u201cLord Voldemort\u201d, \u201cLord Voldermort\u201d or \u201cDr Bruce Banner\u201d in \nthese communications.  \n14 Each of the individuals in the second set of victims felt harassed by the \ncommunications they received and reported the matter to the police. \nSignificantly, one of them, a 65-year-old retiree, was sufficiently fearful of the \nthreatened acts that he immediately took steps to meet his daughter to show her \nthe letter, and then also arranged for his daughter to escort his grandchildren \nhome while he reported the matter to the police.\n15 Further, the appellant\u2019s actions also attracted significant media attention, \nand the Singapore Police Force and a Member of Parliament, Dr Lee Bee Wah, \nhad to issue online advisories advising recipients of these communications not \nto respond to them and instead to report any suspicious activities. \n16 This second wave of criminal behaviour took place in August and \nSeptember 2017. The communications which were the subject of the eight \nproceeded charges were received between 21 August and 10 September 2017. \nThe communications which were the subject of the remaining 25 TIC charges \nwere received between 21 August and 12 September 2017. \nDetails about the email accounts and Bitcoin address \n17 Where the communications took the form of a letter, the appellant signed \noff either as \u201cLord Voldemort\u201d, \u201cLord Voldermort\u201d or \u201cDr Bruce Banner\u201d. \nWhere the communications took the form of an email, the email was sent from \neither of two Protonmail accounts: LordVoldermort@protonmail.com or \nBruceBannerDr@protonmail.com. Protonmail is an email service based in \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nYe Lin Myint v PP[2019] SGHC 221\n7Switzerland that does not require users to give up any personal information in \norder to create an account; it also does not maintain any records of IP addresses \nfrom which the account is accessed. These measures enabled the appellant to \nremain anonymous when he sent emails to the victims using these accounts. \n18 After the appellant\u2019s arrest, it came to light that he had created a \nProtonmail account sometime in July 2017, using his wife\u2019s Lenovo laptop. At \nabout the same time in July 2017, the appellant had also created a Bitcoin wallet. \nHe linked the LordVoldermort email account to this wallet, which enabled him \nto receive and transfer Bitcoin, a form of digital currency which can be \ntransferred between individuals using peer-to-peer networks without the use of \nintermediaries such as banks. One of its key features is the preservation of \nanonymity. \nThe appellant\u2019s arrest\n19 The appellant was only arrested after the police had conducted extensive \ninvestigations into the offences, recorded multiple statements from victims and \nused DNA evidence to trace the appellant. \nThe decision below\n20 The appellant pleaded guilty, and the District Judge accordingly focused \non questions of sentencing: see Public Prosecutor v Ye Lin Myint [2019] SGDC \n36 (\u201cthe GD\u201d).\n21 The District Judge dealt with the s 507 charges first. He noted that these \noffences concerned an aggravated form of criminal intimidation, as the threats \nhad been communicated anonymously and had therefore produced in the \nvictims greater uneasiness than would otherwise have been the case. He \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nYe Lin Myint v PP[2019] SGHC 221\n8reasoned that the point of attack was not localised and the victims were therefore \nsusceptible to greater suspense and apprehension than if the threats had not been \nmade anonymously. The District Judge noted that the threats made by the \nappellant in the instant case carried the same characteristics as those \ncommunications which would typically be made the subject of extortion charges \nin s 385 PC, in that they would likely have caused his victims to suffer \n\u201cextremely real and intense\u201d levels of anxiety and concern, much like extortion \nvictims would. He therefore considered that the better comparison in this case \nwas with extortion offences, and not with offences of criminal intimidation \nsimpliciter in s 506 PC. This justified an upward adjustment of sentence as \ncompared to conventional intimidation cases, and thus the sentencing tariffs for \ns 506 PC offences were less helpful. He ultimately accepted a sentencing matrix \nput forward by the Prosecution, to which the Defence had not objected: GD at \n[48]\u2013[49]. \n22 The District Judge identified a number of aggravating factors which \napplied in this case: GD at [50]\u2013[54]. First, he considered that the appellant\u2019s \nactions had been motivated by malice and greed, as evidenced by the many and \nserious threats the appellant had made as well as his demand for payment by \nBitcoin. Second, he found that the appellant had displayed a high degree of \npremeditation, in his use of pseudonyms, untraceable email accounts, and \nrequest for cryptocurrency as payment. Third, he noted that the threats caused \nconsiderable generalised anxiety to the recipients. Fourth, he considered that \nthere had been cynical misuse of confidential information by the appellant, who \nhad capitalised on the knowledge he had acquired in the course of his work as \nan insurance agent to personalise his threats and make them more alarming and \ncoercive. \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nYe Lin Myint v PP[2019] SGHC 221\n923 As against these aggravating factors, the District Judge also considered \nthat the scheme appeared to have been poorly thought through as the police were \nable with relative ease to triangulate the common denominator amongst the \nvictims, namely that the appellant was or had attempted to become their \ninsurance agent; and furthermore, the victims were unlikely to have gone \nthrough the complex procedure of attempting to make payment using Bitcoin: \nGD at [57]\u2013[58]. While none of the victims actually did make payment, the \nDistrict Judge did not consider this a mitigating factor. The District Judge also \ndid not accept that the appellant\u2019s mild depression had any contributory link to \nthe appellant\u2019s commission of the offences, and hence gave it no mitigating \nweight. The District Judge did accept that it was mitigating, however, that the \nappellant had pleaded guilty: GD at [71]. After taking into account these \nconsiderations, the District Judge accepted the Prosecution\u2019s submission that a \n12-month sentence per charge would have been appropriate, but ultimately \nreduced the sentence to ten months\u2019 imprisonment per charge on the basis that \nhe would run two of these sentences consecutively: GD at [78]. \n24 Turning to the s 3(2) POHA charges, the District Judge ordered a \nsentence of three months\u2019 imprisonment per charge.

Ms Hatta also became Dr Lee\u2019s patient. Ms Lim subsequently became Ms Hatta\u2019s personal assistant. The three were also social acquaintances.', '5\\u2003In or around 2011, Ms Lim heard that Dr Lee was looking for investors to further develop her range of skincare products, DrGL\u00ae. 1', 'On 19 January 2012, Ms Lim arranged for Dr Lee and Ms Hatta to meet the next evening at Ms Hatta\u2019s home.', '6\\u2003During this meeting on 20 January 2012, Ms Hatta contends, Dr Lee informed both her and Ms Lim that she required additional capital for the Companies to expand their business overseas, expand their distribution network, conduct more research and development and expand the Companies\u2019 bottling facilities. 2', 'She spoke of her plans to have DrGL\u00ae products sold in large department stores in Singapore and to expand abroad. There were other interested investors looking to invest in the Companies. A third party investor by the name of Andy Wong, for instance, had offered to invest a sum of $24m in the Companies. 3', 'Ms Hatta asserts that Dr Lee made three key representations to her during that meeting (\u201cthe Representations\u201d):', '(a)\\u2003The sales of the DrGL\u00ae skincare products were doing very well and had exceeded $5m since its launch in or around 2008.', '(b)\\u2003Dr Lee had personally invested approximately $14m into the Companies.', '(c)\\u2003The Companies were worth $40m or Dr Lee knew that the Companies were worth $40m, and Ms Hatta\u2019s investment of $2m would represent 5% of the shareholdings in the Companies.', '7\\u2003Dr Lee denies making the Representations. Her recollection is that they had a short meeting, and she is unable to remember the details of their exchange, save that Ms Hatta offered her house for use for the Companies\u2019 events. 4', 'Following the meeting at Ms Hatta\u2019s house, Ms Hatta was introduced to Mr Frank Cintamani by Dr Lee, as a close friend who assisted her with business matters. Ms Hatta was asked to continue the discussions with Mr Cintamani.', '8\\u2003On or around 31 January 2012, Mr Cintamani and Ms Hatta incorporated Fide Productions Pte Ltd (\u201cFide\u201d) 5', 'in order to host fashion shows and events. 6', 'Mr Cintamani had persuaded Ms Hatta to extend a shareholder\u2019s loan of $2m to Fide to be used as Fide\u2019s working capital (\u201cthe Fide Loan\u201d). 7', 'Ms Hatta was given the position of managing director. 8', 'It is not disputed that she had no operational role in Fide.', '9\\u2003On 3 February 2012, Fide and the Companies agreed on an Exclusive Rights Agreement (\u201cthe First ERA\u201d). Mr Cintamani and Ms Hatta represented Fide and Dr Lee represented the Companies. Under the First ERA, dated 2 February 2012, 9', 'Fide agreed to purchase exclusive rights to produce all events for the Companies for four years in exchange for a sum of $4m, which was to be paid in 2 tranches of $2m. 10', 'Fide was to pay $4m to the Companies, specifically, $2m on execution of the First ERA, and $2m within six months thereafter.', '10\\u2003Three share transfer forms were signed by parties, for the following: 11', '(a)\\u2003a transfer of 500 ordinary shares in the second defendant, for a stated consideration of $1, from Dr Lee to Ms Hatta;', '(b)\\u2003 a transfer of 5 ordinary shares in the third defendant, for a stated consideration of $1, from Mr Cintamani to Ms Hatta; and', '(c)\\u2003a transfer of 50 ordinary shares in the fourth defendant, for a stated consideration of $1, from Dr Lee to Ms Hatta.', '11\\u2003On or about 2 February 2012, Ms Hatta issued two cheques of $2m each in favour of Fide, one for the purpose of the Investment, and the other for the purpose of the Fide Loan. 12', 'Both cheques were made to Fide because Mr Cintamani informed her that, after discussions with Dr Lee, Dr Lee had requested for the payment of the Investment to be made through Fide. 13', 'Mr Cintamani and Ms Hatta went to the United Overseas Bank and deposited the said cheques into Fide\u2019s account. 14', 'Mr Cintamani later withdrew these monies and deposited them both into his personal bank account. 15', 'On 3 February 2012, Mr Cintamani gave Dr Lee a cheque for $2m that was made out in his own name and addressed to her personally. 16', '12\\u2003The parties are in agreement that between 2012 and 2015, Ms Hatta and Dr Lee maintained a good shareholder relationship, which was largely an informal one. 17', 'What is in dispute is Ms Hatta\u2019s role in the Companies. According to Ms Hatta, both she and Dr Lee understood that in consideration of Ms Hatta\u2019s $2m investment, apart from being given 5% of shareholding in the Companies, Ms Hatta would be consulted on material events, regularly updated and involved in decision-making on key matters (I refer to this in this judgment as \u201cthe Alleged Understanding\u201d, and detail its specifics below). Dr Lee, in contrast, denies the existence of the Alleged Understanding. Ms Hatta, she says, was \u201centirely unconcerned\u201d with the Companies\u2019 operations, and was updated only at Dr Lee\u2019s discretion. 18', '13\\u2003Around 1 September 2012, Fide and the Companies entered into a revised version of the First ERA titled \u201cAmendment of Exclusive Rights Agreement Dated 2 February 2012\u201d (\u201cthe Revised ERA\u201d). 19', 'Dated 1 September, the Revised ERA purported to supersede the First ERA, and stated that, given that Fide had \u201cfailed to make payments on the 2nd tranche\u201d, it would \u201cforego any further rights or claims for the exclusive appointment to produce all events for the Companies\u201d. 20', 'Mr Cintamani signed the Revised ERA on behalf of Fide. 21', '14\\u2003Subsequently, Dr Lee approached Ms Hatta to make a further investment in the Companies. On 23 November 2012, Dr Lee asked Ms Hatta to invest a further $2m. In an email informing her that the initial $2m had been rechannelled into the Companies, Dr Lee asked: \u201cwonder if you can assist us to fulfil the balance 2million for the other 5%\u201d.', '15\\u2003On 21 December 2012, Dr Lee wrote to a lawyer, Ms Kuah Boon Theng, to ask her to prepare an agreement which envisaged a $2m investment for 5% in the second defendant and 12% in the fourth defendant in phases. The same email contained an instruction to Mr Richard Chan, an accountant for the Companies, to prepare a share transfer. Ms Kuah replied on 27 December 2012 with a draft agreement. Ms Lim replied to ask Ms Kuah to amend Ms Hatta\u2019s address. Ms Hatta then asked to see the accounts and to verify the extent of Dr Lee\u2019s investment. On 9 January 2013, Dr Lee asked Mr Chan for records of expenditure relating to the \u201cTotal spent for skincare to date\u201d and the accounts. On 12 January 2013, Dr Lee sent an email detailing $13,251,474.52 spent by the Companies. On 18 January 2013, Mr Chan followed on with the skincare development component for a slightly different period, March 2003 to December 2011, for a similar sum. Both related to TLC\u2019s expenses. Ms Hatta did not place any further funds with Dr Lee.', '16\\u2003During this time period, between 2012 to 2015, the Companies\u2019 financial statements reflected losses for the Companies each year. 22', '17\\u2003In late 2015, a personal friend of Dr Lee, Ms Patsy Ong-Hahl, became interested in the Companies, and Dr Lee requested that Adval, Ms Ong-Hahl\u2019s company, develop a growth plan for the Companies. 23', 'On or around 4 December 2015, Adval commenced a due diligence exercise to understand the Companies\u2019 businesses. In or around February 2016, Dr Lee and Adval entered into extensive discussions on Adval\u2019s proposed investment plan. 24', 'Ms Hatta was not involved in these discussions.', '18\\u2003On 11 February 2016, Dr Lee introduced Ms Hatta to Mr Clarence Ku, Adval\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. 25', 'This was the first time that Ms Hatta was informed of the discussions with Adval. 26', 'On 22 February 2016, Dr Lee sent an email to Ms Hatta, summarising a proposal from the proposed investors. This was \u201cJV Structure 1\u201d, the first of five joint venture proposals. This proposal stated that: 27', '(a)\\u2003The Companies were to transfer their assets to Dr Lee, who would then transfer said assets to the joint venture company.', '(b)\\u2003Dr Lee and Ms Hatta would receive 19% and 1% of the shares in the joint venture company respectively.', '19\\u2003On 26 February 2016, Ms Hatta emailed Dr Lee with certain queries concerning Adval\u2019s investment. 28', 'Later that day, Dr Lee informed Ms Hatta that she intended to hold an Extraordinary General Meeting (\u201cEGM\u201d) for the Companies on 16 March 2016, as the \u201cnew investors\u2026needs [sic] to be finalised by March\u201d. 29', 'On 3 March 2016, Ms Hatta received a Notice of EGM that was to be held on 18 March 2016 for the Companies, with the purpose of said EGM being to approve the sale of the Companies\u2019 assets. 30', 'On 7 March 2016, Ms Hatta received hard copies of the draft assets purchase agreement. In contrast to JV Structure 1, where Dr Lee was to take over the assets of the Companies personally, under the new proposed structure (\u201cJV Structure 2\u201d), it would be Dr Lee\u2019s clinic, TLC, that would obtain the assets of the Companies. 31', '20\\u2003Ms Hatta appointed a proxy to attend the EGM on 18 March 2016, who raised several concerns relating to the purported lack of information provided to Ms Hatta about the proposed joint venture structure, and the fact that the EGM appeared to be a mechanism to force the sale of the Companies without addressing Ms Hatta\u2019s concerns. 32', 'Faced with the questions presented by Ms Hatta\u2019s proxy, Dr Lee adjourned the EGM. 33', 'A subsequent revision of the joint venture structure was then proposed to Ms Hatta in emails dated 19 May 2016 (\u201cJV Structure 3\u201d). 34', 'Pursuant to JV Structure 3, the second defendant was to purchase the assets of the Companies. Additionally, Dr Lee undertook to pay off all the debts of the Companies.', '21\\u2003Following additional discussions regarding the potential joint venture with Adval, Dr Lee forwarded to Ms Hatta another draft investment term sheet on 7 June 2016, which proposed a new structure for the joint venture (\u201cJV Structure 4\u201d). 35', 'Ms Hatta replied via email on 14 June 2016, taking issue with several changes made in JV Structure 4; this included the fact that an individual, Mr Chuah Wai Chow (\u201cMr Chuah\u201d) would be the majority shareholder instead of Adval, that there would be three directors (Mr Chuah, Ms Ong-Hahl and Dr Lee) instead of two (Ms Ong-Hahl and Dr Lee), and that there was a risk that the second defendant\u2019s shares in JV Company would be further diluted. 36', '22\\u2003On 28 November 2016, Dr Lee sent an email to Ms Hatta, stating that an \u201cin-principle agreement with the proposed investors has been reached on the terms of a deal\u2026\u201d 37', 'The key aspects of the proposed deal (\u201cFinal JV Structure\u201d) were that: 38', '(a)\\u2003Dr Lee and Ms Hatta would maintain their respective shareholding proportions in the second and third defendant, which would function as vehicles used to participate in the joint venture company, now named A DrBrand Pte Ltd (\u201cADB\u201d).', '(b)\\u2003The second and third defendants would transfer all their business assets to ADB in exchange for 20% of ordinary shares in ADB.', '(c)\\u2003The trademarks used by the second and third defendants in their skincare and spa businesses would be transferred and assigned to ADB for the cost of applying for registration of the marks.', '(d)\\u2003After taking over conduct of the business, the investors would work towards achieving an IPO or strategic sale within 5 years.', '23\\u2003After receiving Dr Lee\u2019s email, Ms Hatta replied on 6 December 2016, raising several questions about the Final JV Structure. 39', 'On 6 January 2017, Ms Hatta received an email from the Companies\u2019 accounting firm, Richard Consultants Pte Ltd (\u201cRC\u201d), attaching the following: 40', 'a Notice of proposed Members\u2019 Resolutions in Writing of the second and third defendants; the text of said proposed resolutions; a draft business transfer agreement relating to the joint venture; a draft subscription agreement relating to the joint venture; and a draft shareholders\u2019 agreement relating to the joint venture.

{"casename":"2019_SGHC_225","fact":"'5\\u2003The applicant\u2019s allegations of misconduct against the three DPPs arose from events that transpired more than 15 years ago. The relevant events pertain to charges of cheating that were brought against the applicant by the Prosecution in 2003. Those charges arose from transactions carried out by the applicant in 1999, while he was a director of a company known as Infoseek Communications (S) Pte Ltd (\u201cInfoseek\u201d). The key facts contained in the Statement of Facts dated 20 May 2003 (\u201cSOF\u201d) may be summarised as follows:', '(a)\\u2003The applicant was a director of Infoseek, a company which offered international long distance telephone call services (\u201cIDD call services\u201d). 1', '(b)\\u2003Customers could pay for Infoseek\u2019s IDD call services by any of three modes of payment, one of which was post-paid credit card billing. Under this mode of payment, Infoseek would charge the amounts due for services used to the customer\u2019s credit card. The applicant would key in the credit card number of the customer into an Electronic Draft Capture (\u201cEDC\u201d) terminal provided by the United Overseas Bank (\u201cUOB\u201d) Card Centre and the bank would credit the amount into Infoseek\u2019s UOB bank account on the next working day. 2', '(c)\\u2003Between June and July 1999, the applicant generated fictitious credit card transactions using the EDC terminal located at Infoseek\u2019s premises. He would either duplicate calls of customers to inflate their total usage, or charge customers twice for the same incurred usage. During this period, the applicant had processed a total of 765 fictitious credit card transactions generating charges in excess of $500,000 using the EDC terminal. 3', '6\\u2003It was stated in the SOF that on 6 July 1999, the applicant left Singapore for India. This was a point emphasised by the applicant in the present application as some of the charges which had been taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing were in respect of transactions which were reflected in the charge and Schedule of Offences as being dated after 6 July 1999.', '7\\u2003Extradition proceedings were eventually initiated against the applicant, who was ordered by the Indian courts to be extradited to Singapore to face the charges against him. The applicant returned to Singapore on 24 December 2002. 4', '8\\u2003The applicant had committed several other offences prior to the 1999 cheating offences. 5', 'His antecedents are summarised in the following table:', '9\\u2003The applicant was represented by counsel in the proceedings in the District Court. On 20 May 2003, in the presence of his counsel, the applicant elected to plead guilty to the five charges and consented to have the remaining 760 charges taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. He admitted to the SOF without qualification. Sentencing was then adjourned to 22 May 2003 to allow the applicant\u2019s counsel to prepare a mitigation plea on his behalf. 6', '10\\u2003On 22 May 2003, following the DPP\u2019s submission that a sentence of preventive detention was called for, the District Judge adjourned sentencing for a further three weeks to enable a preventive detention suitability report to be prepared and submitted. 7', '11\\u2003On 5 June 2003, one week before the scheduled sentencing hearing, the applicant applied to retract his plea. His principal contention then was that the sentencing position which the Prosecution had advanced before the District Judge was contrary to what it had represented to him before he pleaded guilty. He claimed that the Prosecution had agreed not to seek a deterrent or enhanced sentence and had stated during a pre-trial conference that it would leave sentencing to the court. 8', 'He also alleged that the Investigating Officer (\u201cIO\u201d) had pressured him to plead guilty, by amongst others, threatening his wife. 9', 'On 11 June 2003, the day of the sentencing hearing, the applicant filed a second application to retract his plea, alleging that the prospect of preventive detention was contrary to the terms on which his extradition had been ordered. 10', '12\\u2003The District Judge refused the applicant\u2019s applications to retract his plea which he found were unmeritorious and premised on baseless allegations. The District Judge found that the applicant had not offered any valid or sufficient grounds to justify the retraction of his plea, which had been voluntarily and unequivocally entered (see Salwant Singh (District Court) at [10]).', '13\\u2003The District Judge sentenced the applicant to 12 years\u2019 preventive detention having taken into account, mainly, the applicant\u2019s antecedents, the offences with which he had been charged, as well as his lack of remorse (Salwant Singh (District Court) at [19]\u2013[29]).', '14\\u2003Dissatisfied with the sentence imposed by the District Judge, the Prosecution filed Magistrate\u2019s Appeal No 115 of 2003 (\u201cMA 115\u201d) on the basis that the sentence was manifestly inadequate. The applicant cross-appealed, claiming that the sentence was excessive. The applicant was unrepresented in MA 115.', '15\\u2003In his petition of appeal and written submissions for MA 115, the applicant advanced three main submissions, which were similar to those raised before the District Judge, in his continuing effort to retract his plea:', '(a)\\u2003that the Prosecution had reneged on its promise not to seek a deterrent or enhanced sentence should the applicant plead guilty; 11', '(b)\\u2003that the IO had pressured the applicant to plead guilty by, amongst other things, threatening his wife; 12', 'and', '(c)\\u2003that seeking preventive detention constituted a breach of the undertakings provided by the Singapore Government to the Government of India in its extradition request. 13', '16\\u2003MA 115 was heard by Yong Pung How CJ on 14 August 2003. At the hearing, the applicant also claimed for the first time that he had an alibi for all 765 charges and sought an order setting aside his conviction and setting the matter down for trial. Yong CJ rejected the applicant\u2019s prayers on the basis that (a) the appeal was not the proper forum for such a request, the correct procedure being an application for revision rather than an appeal against sentence; and (b) a review of the evidence did not reveal any error so fundamental that it justified the exercise of the court\u2019s revisionary powers on its own motion under ss 266 and 268 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (\u201cCPC 1985\u201d) (see Salwant Singh (MA) at [14]). He further found that the District Judge had not erred in rejecting the applications to retract the plea, and concluded that the applicant\u2019s request in MA 115 for a new trial was just another last-ditch attempt to escape a sentence of preventive detention (Salwant Singh (MA) at [15]).', '17\\u2003In respect of the sentence imposed by the District Judge, Yong CJ found that the sentence was manifestly inadequate to reflect the length and gravity of the applicant\u2019s criminal record and the need for him to be incarcerated for a substantial duration for the protection of society (Salwant Singh (MA) at [21]). In the circumstances, the Prosecution\u2019s appeal was allowed and the applicant\u2019s sentence was enhanced from 12 years\u2019 to 20 years\u2019 preventive detention.', '18\\u2003Since the conclusion of MA 115 in 2003, the applicant has filed more than ten criminal applications. I do not propose to elaborate on each of these applications in these grounds save to highlight two of the applications which were of some relevance to the present matter. These are Criminal Motion No 20 of 2004 (\u201cCM 20\u201d) and Criminal Motion No 17 of 2008 (\u201cCM 17\u201d).', '19\\u2003In CM 20, the applicant sought to obtain the notes recorded at pre-trial conferences (\u201cPTCs\u201d) which occurred between the time he had been formally charged and the day he pleaded guilty to the charges. The applicant\u2019s object in retrieving the notes was to substantiate his earlier claims that the Prosecution had agreed not to seek a deterrent or enhanced sentence before his conviction and thus that the Prosecution had reneged on the premise on which he had in fact pleaded guilty when it subsequently sought a sentence of preventive detention. CM 20 was dismissed at first instance by the High Court. On appeal, the Court of Appeal affirmed the decision of the High Court. It held that there was no basis on which the court could properly order the release of the PTC notes to the applicant because what had taken place at the PTCs did not form part of the criminal proceedings in which the applicant had been convicted and sentenced (see Salwant Singh s\/o Amer Singh v Public Prosecutor [2005] 1 SLR (R) 632 (\u201cSalwant Singh (PTC Notes)\u201d) at [10]). Nonetheless, the Court of Appeal investigated the substance of the applicant\u2019s allegations and found, based on the contemporaneous exchange of letters between the Prosecution and the applicant, that the Prosecution had not agreed that it would not press for a deterrent sentence (Salwant Singh (PTC Notes) at [13]\u2013[15]). The court also noted that on the day the Prosecution sought an order of preventive detention before the District Judge, there was no protest or any allegation of a breach of understanding by either the applicant or his counsel. Instead, all that was submitted at that juncture was that the imposition of preventive detention would be too harsh (Salwant Singh (PTC Notes) at [15]).', '20\\u2003In CM 17, the applicant sought an order for the review of his detention under ss 327(b) and 327(c) of the CPC 1985 and art 9(2) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1985 Rev Ed, 1999 Reprint). In this application, the applicant contended that his conviction was wrongful because a number of the charges brought against him were for acts which he could not have committed since they were said to have occurred on a date when the applicant was not in Singapore. That the applicant was not in Singapore on those dates was, according to him, evident from date stamps in his passport as well as the fact that the SOF stated that he had left for India on 6 July 1999. 14', 'I should mention at this juncture that this is the same submission which formed the basis of the applicant\u2019s claims against the DPPs in the present application, and will be explained in greater detail in the following section of these grounds. CM 17 was heard and dismissed by Tay Yong Kwang J (as he then was). Tay J found that there was no basis for the applicant to invoke s 327 of the CPC 1985 as his conviction and sentence were ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction and the appeal therefrom was heard and disposed of by the appellate court specified by law. The enhanced sentence was therefore not unlawful in any way (see Salwant Singh s\/o Amer Singh v Public Prosecutor [2008] SGHC 164 (\u201cSalwant Singh (Review)\u201d at [13]).'"}

Dr Yap explained that the transparent plastic \nbags which contained the drugs have since been emptied, as the drugs had to be \nremoved for analysis. Nonetheless, the original transparent plastic bags for each \ndrug exhibit (A1A to A4A) were retained. To check if they were the same plastic \nbags which contained the drugs (and which were photographed by CNB and Dr \nYap respectively), Dr Yap filled each transparent plastic bag with gloves to \nmimic the shape of exhibits A1A to A4A as captured in the CNB\u2019s photograph121 \nwhen they were filled with the drugs. \n121 Apart from being able to mimic the shapes of exhibit A1A to A4A, Dr \nYap pointed out that a random horizontal double crease observable in the CNB\u2019s \nphotograph of exhibit A2A persists in the actual transparent plastic bag of \nexhibit A2A today.122 This horizontal double crease in the actual transparent \nplastic bag is also in the same position as in the CNB\u2019s photograph of the \nexhibit, being at about the one-quarter mark from the bottom of the exhibit.123 \n122 During cross-examination, Dr Yap was queried about a triangular \nopaque area which appears larger in size in Dr Yap\u2019s photograph of exhibit A2A \nthan in the CNB\u2019s photograph of the same exhibit.124 To explain, each \ntransparent plastic bag was almost fully filled with brown granular substances, \nsuch that little free space were present in the transparent plastic bags to exhibits \n121 See Exhibit CH-PH 30.\n122 Transcripts (5 August 2019) p 24 lines 22 \u2013 32; p 51 lines 19 \u2013 21.\n123 Transcripts (5 August 2019) p 24 lines 29 \u2013 30; compare with Exhibit CH-PH30 and \nExhibit P54.\n124 Transcripts (5 August 2019) p 58 lines 19 \u2013 23.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Parthiban Kanapathy[2019] SGHC 226\n41A1A to A4A when they were photographed by the CNB.125 Any free space, \nhowever, would have revealed an opaque area in the photographs. This can be \nperceived from the tiny opaque area observable at the bottom left hand corner \nof exhibit A2A in the CNB\u2019s photograph.126 Clearly, during transportation of the \ndrug exhibits from CNB to HSA, the granular substances could have moved \nwithin their packaging,127 thereby creating a larger triangular opaque area at the \ntop left hand corner of the transparent plastic bag for exhibit A2A when it was \neventually photographed by Dr Yap. In my view, this enlarged opaque area is \nin no way probative of a break in chain of custody, especially as the random \nhorizontal double crease observable on the CNB\u2019s photograph of exhibit A2A \npersists in the actual physical exhibit today.  \n123 Significantly, the photographs were taken many years before any dispute \nin relation to the observable flap in the photographs taken by Dr Yap had even \nsurfaced. Indeed, the dispute about the flaps was not raised in both tranches of \nhearings, and is only raised in the accused\u2019s reply submissions, after closing \nsubmissions had already been tendered. Accordingly, the horizontal double \ncrease which supports the finding that the transparent plastic bags containing \nthe drugs examined by HSA were the same plastic bags captured in the CNB \nphotograph could not have been fabricated for the purposes of this trial. \n124 Furthermore, the handwriting for the exhibit labels \u201cA1A\u201d to \u201cA4A\u201d, \nwhich were written by Insp Ong,128 appear identical in both the photographs \n125 Exhibit CH-PH 30.\n126 Exhibit CH-PH 30.\n127 Transcripts (5 August 2019) p 59 lines 29 \u2013 31.\n128 Transcripts (5 August 2019) p 134 lines 4 \u2013 7.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Parthiban Kanapathy[2019] SGHC 226\n42taken by CNB and Dr Yap.129 The consistency in handwriting in the photographs \nwas confirmed by Dr Yap during the hearing on 5 August 2019.130 For instance, \nthe horizontal stroke for the second \u201cA\u201d to exhibit label \u201cA3A\u201d extends out of \nthe downward diagonal stroke of the same letter \u201cA\u201d in both the CNB\u2019s and Dr \nYap\u2019s photographs.131 This bolsters the finding that the exhibits photographed \nby CNB were the same exhibits that were sent to Dr Yap for analysis, and which \nwere subsequently produced in court for examination. While Dr Yap is not a \nhandwriting expert, her observation about the similarity in handwriting was not \nchallenged by the defence, even though counsel for the accused was given an \nopportunity to physically examine the exhibits and their labels during the \nhearing. This reinforces the conclusion that the exhibits photographed by CNB \nand that were analysed by Dr Yap were the same drug exhibits.\n125 To put any doubts to rest, the transparent plastic bags of exhibits A1A \nto A4A were measured by Dr Yap, revealing the following dimensions:132\n129 Compare CH-PH30 with Exhibit P54.\n130 Transcripts (5 August 2019) p 25 line 29 \u2013 p 26 line 14.\n131 Compare CH-PH30 with Exhibit P54.\n132 Transcripts (5 August 2019) p 34 line 24 \u2013 p 43 line 15.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Parthiban Kanapathy[2019] SGHC 226\n43 \nA1A \n(sealed \nportion \nis \nslanted, \ngiving \ntwo \nlengths) \n(cm)A2A \n(sealed \nportion is \nhorizontal) \n(cm)A3A \n(sealed \nportion \nis \nslanted, \ngiving \ntwo \nlengths) \n(cm)A4A \n(sealed \nportion is \nhorizontal) \n(cm)\nA Length of the \nplastic \npackaging \nafter \nunfolding the \nflap19.0\/18.7 19.0 16.0\/16.9 19.2\nB Length of the \nplastic \npackaging 14.5\/14.2 14.6 14.8\/14.2 14.8\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Parthiban Kanapathy[2019] SGHC 226\n44before \nunfolding the \nflap \n(including the \nheat-sealed \nportion)\nC Width of the \npackage 12.8 12.9 12.8 12.9\nD Thickness of \nthe heat-\nsealed portion0.9\/0.7 0.9 2.2\/1.7 0.9\nE Length of the \nflap \n(including the \nheat-sealed \nportion)6.3\/6.0 6.4 5.8\/6.4 6.1\nA+2D Length of the \nplastic \npackaging \nprior to heat \nsealing20.8\/20.1 20.8 20.4\/20.3 21.0\n126 Since the heat-sealed portions of the transparent plastic bags extend \noutward from the transparent plastic bags (when laid flat) and fold over \nthemselves, adding the length of the heat-sealed portion twice over (2D) to the \nlength of the plastic bags after the flap is unfolded (A) would reveal the rough \nlength of the plastic bags prior to them being heat-sealed.

While the majority held that it was safe to convict \nthe accused notwithstanding the substantial discrepancy in weight suggesting a \nbreak in the chain of custody, Chao Hick Tin J (as he then was) observed in his \ndissenting judgment at [70]:\nIn percentage terms, 78.13g over 474.11g represents a margin \nof error of about 16.49%. With this margin of discrepancy I do \nnot think the court should dismiss it by saying there must be \nsome error somewhere. It behoves the Prosecution to explain \nthe discrepancy. Chew would have known that in a charge of \ntrafficking in drugs, every gramme counts; it could make a \ndifference between life and death. In my respectful opinion \nthere was no basis for the trial judge to postulate those two \nreasons to explain the discrepancy. I accept that a court can \ndraw reasonable inferences from facts which are before the \ncourt. But the inferences drawn must be warranted by the \nevidence. [emphasis added]\n131 In the present case, the discrepancy between the gross weight is far less \nsignificant, at only about 1% per drug exhibit (and 1.02% overall). Nonetheless, \ngiven the severe penalties that flow from a drug trafficking conviction, I put the \nProsecution to task to explain the discrepancy.\n132 In this regard, Dr Yap testified that while she \u201cw[ould] not be able to \nconclusively say what is the exact cause of this difference\u201d,135 there were several \npossible explanations for the differences in weight in each exhibit:\n135 NEs (28 Feb 2019), p 18 at lines 31 \u2013 32.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Parthiban Kanapathy[2019] SGHC 226\n47(a) first, the accuracy of the balance could have contributed to the \ndiscrepancy. The accuracy of each balance depended on, among others, \n\u201cthe location of where it\u2019s placed, whether it is in a level platform, \u2026 \nwhether the balance has been regularly maintained and sent for external \ncalibration\u201d;136\n(b) secondly, the operator\u2019s practice could also contribute to the \ndiscrepancy. This included whether the operator had properly zeroed the \nbalance before a new item was placed on the balance or whether the item \nwas placed centrally and not off-centre such that part of the exhibit is on \nthe side of the balance;137\n(c) thirdly, the fact that diamorphine is hygroscopic could contribute \nto a weight discrepancy. Given its hygroscopic nature, diamorphine can \nabsorb moisture through time, causing its weight to increase. However, \nDr Yap further opined that, given that the drug exhibits were heat-sealed \nprior to their submission to HSA and that they were stored in a strong \nroom that was air-conditioned 24 hours a day, she did not think that the \nweight discrepancy would be greatly affected by the hygroscopic nature \nof diamorphine.138\n133 While it is not possible to conclusively determine the exact reason for \nthe very small weight discrepancy, the facts reveal that the weight of each of the \ndrug exhibits was consistently about 1% heavier at HSA than at CNB. \n136 NEs (28 Feb 2019) p 19 at lines 3 \u2013 9.\n137 NEs (28 Feb 2019) p 19 at lines 10 \u2013 16.\n138 NEs (28 Feb 2019) p 19 line 30 \u2013 p 20 line 9.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Parthiban Kanapathy[2019] SGHC 226\n48134 Considered with Dr Yap\u2019s unchallenged testimony as to the possible \ncauses for the weight discrepancy, the consistent weight difference leads to the \nstrong inference that whatever the reason for the weight discrepancy, it was not \ncaused by a break in the chain of custody, but rather by differences in the \naccuracy of the balances used by CNB and HSA or in the way the drug exhibits \nwere weighed by Insp Ong and Dr Yap respectively. \n135 I am fortified in my view as I find that the drug exhibits were the only \ndrug exhibits in Insp Ong\u2019s locker at the material time. As explained above, \nafter weighing the drug exhibits in the accused\u2019s presence on 4 February 2012, \nInsp Ong placed them in his safe.139 The safe was secured by a number lock \nwhich only Insp Ong had the combination number to.140 At the material time, \nthe drug exhibits were also the only drug exhibits in Insp Ong\u2019s safe141 as the \ndrug exhibits were \u201ckept very briefly for live cases\u201d, and there were sufficient \ninvestigating officers to ensure that they would not be assigned two live drug \ncases at the same time:142\nQ And you had mentioned because drug exhibits are kept very \nbriefly for live cases.\nA Yes.\nQ Can you elaborate on what you mean by this?\nA We will---we will not---we will try not to hold on to the drug \nexhibits longer than we should be and by the time a new case \ncomes in, we would have cleared all our drug exhibits from our \nhands already.

SI Fathli extracted information relating to all capital drug \ncase files created on the Integrated Drug Enforcement Administration System \n(\u201cIDEAS\u201d) of the CNB from 1 December 2011 to 6 February 2012.143 The \ninformation presented shows that from 1 December 2011 to 6 February 2012, \nthere were 13 capital drug cases, and no investigation officer was assigned to \nmore than one case at any one time.144 During this period, Insp Ong was assigned \n143 Exhibit PS37, paras 2 \u2013 4.\n144 Exhibit PS37, para 6 and Exhibit PS38, Annex A.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Parthiban Kanapathy[2019] SGHC 226\n50two capital drug cases. The first was assigned on 14 January 2012, and the \nexhibits for that case were sent to HSA on 17 January 2012. Insp Ong did not \nreceive any other capital drug cases until he was assigned a second capital drug \ncase on 4 February 2012, when he received the drug exhibits for the accused, \nwhich he sent to HSA on 6 February 2012.145 The information generated by \nIDEAS was confirmed by the Registration Log Report that was independently \nproduced by HSA\u2019s system. HSA\u2019s Registration Log Report reflected that \nbetween 1 December 2011 to 28 February 2012, Insp Ong submitted drug \nexhibits for two cases only, on 17 January 2012 and 6 February 2012 \nrespectively.146 The two dates of submission of drug exhibits to HSA were \nidentical under both CNB and HSA's system, corroborating Insp Ong\u2019s account \nthat the drug exhibits were the only ones in his locker between 4 February 2012 \nand 6 February 2012.\n137 Therefore, I find on the totality of the evidence that the minute weight \ndiscrepancy is insufficient to cast a reasonable doubt on the unbroken chain of \ncustody of the drug exhibits.\n138 The accused\u2019s counsel further raised the fact that while Insp Ong had \nbeen \u201cpuzzled\u201d by the weight discrepancy from as early as 2012 when the HSA \nreports were returned by Dr Yap, he failed to retrieve and submit the weighing \nscale he had used for weighing the drug exhibits to determine the cause of the \ndiscrepancy.147 Furthermore, when tendering an amended charge to the accused \nto include the analysed diamorphine content as revealed in Dr Yap\u2019s report, Insp \n145 Exhibit PS38, Annex A and Annex B.\n146 Exhibit PS36, P57 (attached), pp 1 \u2013 3.\n147 NEs (26 Feb 2019), p 40 line 31 \u2013 p 41 line 8; Closing Submissions for the Accused at \nparas 22 \u2013 24.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Parthiban Kanapathy[2019] SGHC 226\n51Ong did not state the gross weight of the drug exhibits even though it was in his \nhabit to do so.148 I do not think that these facts are sufficient to cast a reasonable \ndoubt in relation to the chain of custody of the drug exhibits.\n139 In relation to Insp Ong\u2019s failure to retrieve the weighing scale which he \nhad used for examination, it is important to note that the issue relating to the \nweight of the exhibits was not even raised until the second tranche of hearings \nin February 2019, some seven years after the drug exhibits had been weighed \nby CNB. Given that the weight discrepancy was not in issue, it was entirely \nreasonable for Insp Ong to have proceeded on the assumption that the CNB\u2019s \n\u201cweighing scale gave an indicative weight\u201d only,149 and that the weighing scale \nwhich he had used did not have to be examined. This was especially as the \n\u201cindicative weight\u201d obtained by the CNB weighing scale was consistently about \n1% lighter than the weight obtained by Dr Yap at HSA, suggesting that the \n\u201cindicative weight\u201d was, as the term suggests, broadly indicative (but not \nconclusive) of the weight of the drug exhibits. Accordingly, it was entirely \nreasonable for Insp Ong not to have recalled the weighing scale for examination \nas he had \u201cno reason\u201d to believe that the weighing scale he had used to weigh \nthe drug exhibits was not working correctly (ie, to give an indicative weight of \nthe drug exhibits).150\n140 As regards Insp Ong\u2019s failure to state the gross weight of the drug \nexhibits in the amended charge, I find that this amounts to a mere speculation \nabout the possibility of contamination of the drug exhibits resulting in the drug \n148 NEs (26 Feb 2019), p 46 at lines 11 \u2013 16; Closing Submissions for the Accused at para \n27.\n149 NEs (26 Feb 2019), p 41 at lines 22 \u2013 23.\n150 NEs (26 Feb 2019), p 53 at lines 17 \u2013 20.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Parthiban Kanapathy[2019] SGHC 226\n52exhibits being heavier when they were sent to HSA, which will not be \nentertained: Mohamed Affandi at [41] and [55]. While Insp Ong candidly \nadmitted that his omission was contrary to his usual habit, the key purpose of \nthe amended charge was to inform the accused of the analysed weight of \ndiamorphine in the drug exhibits,151 which exceeded the capital amount of 15g. \nAccordingly, the analysed diamorphine content was key, and the omission of \nthe gross weight of the drug exhibits was not fatal to the purpose of tendering \nan amended charge to the accused. Given that no further evidence is furnished \nto show how Insp Ong\u2019s failure to state the gross weight of the drug exhibits in \nthe amended charge has broken the chain of custody, I find that this point does \nnot support the accused\u2019s contention at all.\nConclusion\n141 In conclusion, given that the weight of each of the drug exhibits is \nconsistently about 1% heavier at HSA than at CNB, and as no further evidence \nhas been presented to suggest a break in the chain of custody that has been \nextensively detailed by the Prosecution, I find that the Prosecution has proven \nan unbroken chain of custody beyond a reasonable doubt.\n142 Accordingly, I convict the accused of the amended charge of importing \nnot less than 14.99g of diamorphine, in contravention of s 7 of the MDA.\n143 I will now hear parties on the sentence. \n151 NEs (26 Feb 2019), p 58 at lines 19 \u2013 21.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Parthiban Kanapathy[2019] SGHC 226\n53Chan Seng Onn\nJudge \nFor 14-15, 21-23 February 2017\nAndrew Tan and Prakash Otharam (Attorney-General\u2019s Chambers) \nfor the Prosecution.\nFor 26, 28 February 2019, 14 May 2019, 5 August 2019\nPeggy Pao-Keerthi Pei Yu and Zhou Yihong (Attorney-General\u2019s \nChambers) for the Prosecution.\nFor 14-15, 21-23 February 2017\nN K Rajarh (Straits Law Practice LLC) and Sureshan s\/o T \nKulasingam (M\/S Sureshan LLC) for the accused.\nFor 26, 28 February 2019, 14 May 2019, 5 August 2019\nRamesh Tiwary (M\/S Ramesh Tiwary) for the accused.\n \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)"}

The victim addressed the accused as \u201cAbah\u201d, which means father in the Malay language.', '6\\u2003The accused married the victim\u2019s mother, [N], sometime in 2013.

There were also other occasions when the accused and the victim slept alone on either of the two beds.', '8\\u2003The charges brought, including the TIC Charges, concerned offences which were committed from January 2015 to October 2016 in the Bedroom while everyone else was asleep. On most occasions, the sexual assaults took place while the accused was lying beside his wife on the same bed.', '9\\u2003The three proceeded charges concerned three different incidents, which I now turn to.', '10\\u2003Sometime in 2015, the victim was lying on her own bed in the Bedroom when there was a heavy thunderstorm. She was scared and called out to the accused, who proceeded to lie down beside the victim on her bed. Thereafter, the victim fell asleep. The accused became sexually aroused and proceeded to engage in various sexual activities with the victim. Although the victim woke up when such activity occurred, she pretended to be asleep and stayed still.', '11\\u2003The victim then felt something going into her mouth and realised that the accused was putting his penis into her mouth (ie, fellatio). While she tried to clamp shut her lips and close her mouth, she was unable to do so. She developed an itching sensation around her mouth as a result of the accused\u2019s pubic hair and the pushing of his penis in and out of her mouth. She also felt some liquid in her mouth and was disgusted.', '12\\u2003The OM Charges related to two separate incidents.', '13\\u2003The 6th Charge concerned an incident which occurred between January 2016 and September 2016. The victim was asleep in the Bedroom when the accused started kissing her. She was awakened by his tongue inside her mouth but pretended to be asleep. The accused pulled the victim\u2019s panties down, took out his penis from his shorts and engaged in sexual activity with her. After lifting her onto her side such that her back was towards him, he rubbed his penis against her exposed anus until he ejaculated. The victim felt pain at her anal and vaginal area due to the accused\u2019s vigorous rubbing motion.', '14\\u2003The 8th Charge related to an incident which occurred either on 13 October 2016 or 14 October 2016. As with the 6th Charge, the victim was asleep in the Bedroom when the accused started kissing her. She pretended to be asleep although she had been awakened by his tongue inside her mouth. The accused took out his penis from his shorts and placed her hands on his penis. He also touched her chest and buttocks. Thereafter, the accused pulled the victim\u2019s panties down and positioned himself above the victim. He then licked her vagina, such that she felt a tickling sensation. The accused subsequently used his finger and rubbed against the victim\u2019s vagina, before re-positioning himself above her and rubbing his penis against her vagina. Throughout this incident, the victim continued to pretend to be asleep. She felt some pain and an itching sensation at her vagina.', '15\\u2003On 17 October 2016, shortly after the incident relating to the 8th Charge took place, the victim\u2019s biological father was about to send her back to the Flat when she began to cry hysterically. The victim refused to enter the Flat. The victim was brought downstairs when she then revealed that the accused had sexually assaulted her.

It was incorporated on 16 August 2012. It is in the business of providing human resource services, particularly employment and executive search services. 1', '3\\u2003Connectus Group was set up by (i) Seah Chee Wan, who is also referred to as Alex Seah (\u201cAS\u201d), (ii) Seah Shiang Ping, who is also referred to as Stacey Seah (\u201cSS\u201d), and (iii) Lim Tien Ho (\u201cLTH\u201d). The two Seahs are siblings. Together with LTH, the three of them had been colleagues in Hudson Global Resources (Singapore) Pte Ltd (\u201cHudson\u201d), which is a well-established firm in the same line of business. 2', '4\\u2003AS, SS and LTH decided to strike out on their own. They came up with the name \u201cConnectus\u201d for their own human resource services business and Connectus Group was thus set up. 3', '5\\u2003To start the business, the three of them needed additional capital investment. In March 2012, before Connectus Group was incorporated, SS had been introduced through an acquaintance to one Ng Sing King, also referred to as Paul Ng (\u201cPN\u201d). PN was a potential investor who had various business interests. 4', 'SS asked PN whether he would be interested in being a partner in their business that would be established. PN had many meetings with AS, SS and LTH. He learnt of their respective areas of specialities and what each of them wanted to do. PN told them about his own track record in human resource services businesses in Singapore and China. He had acted as a consultant and advisor to several such businesses. With his undoubted experience, AS, SS and LTH were looking to PN as an advisor on how to set up and run a successful human resource services business. 5', '6\\u2003PN eventually agreed to invest in the business venture. In November 2012, a few months after Connectus Group was incorporated, PN used a company that he substantially owned and controlled, APBA Pte Ltd (\u201cAPBA\u201d), 6', 'to subscribe for shares in Connectus Group. 7', 'On 12 November 2012, the four shareholders - APBA, SS, AS and LTH - entered into a Shareholders\u2019 Agreement in relation to Connectus Group (\u201cthe SHA\u201d). 8', '7\\u2003The SHA was comprehensive and dealt with all the usual matters that one would expect to be covered by such an agreement. It included provisions dealing with how meetings would be conducted, restrictions on voting rights, reserved matters, anti-dilution of shareholding, \u201ctag-along\u201d and \u201cdrag-along\u201d rights, dividends policy, management deadlock, buy-out provisions etc. There is also a provision of the SHA (clause 5.2), which provided, in gist, that each of the shareholders was entitled to appoint a director to the board of Connectus Group unless his shareholding fell below 15%. 9', '8\\u2003After the entry of APBA, the shareholding in Connectus Group was as follows: 10', '(a)\\u2003AS\\u2003-\\u2003117,000 shares (23.4%)', '(b)\\u2003SS\\u2003-\\u2003117,000 shares (23.4%)', '(c)\\u2003LTH\\u2003-\\u2003117,000 shares (23.4%)', '(d)\\u2003APBA\\u2003-\\u2003149,000 shares (29.8%)', '9\\u2003It is not disputed that PN had asked for slightly more than a 25% stake so that he could block any special resolutions. 11', 'After APBA\u2019s investment, as per the terms of the SHA, PN was appointed as APBA\u2019s representative to the board of Connectus Group. 12', 'The only other directors were AS, SS and LTH. 13', '10\\u2003The four shareholders brought different practice areas and business segments to the table. AS had been working for a number of years in China, developing human resource businesses there. He wanted to continue focusing on growing the business in China. SS\u2019s and LTH\u2019s practice areas were based in Singapore. SS was primarily interested in servicing the healthcare industry, while LTH\u2019s practice areas were the IT and semiconductor industries. 14', '11\\u2003PN\u2019s contribution was his experience and expertise in running a human resource services business. 15', 'While the other three had experience only in employee recruitment and executive search, PN offered to help Connectus Group develop revenue streams in areas like payroll administration, recruitment process outsourcing, interim management and contract staffing. 16', '12\\u2003AS, SS and LTH were employed full-time by Connectus Group and drew salaries. 17', 'On the other hand, APBA provided consultancy and accounting services to Connectus Group, and billed the company for these services. 18', '13\\u2003Less than a year later, in July 2013, LTH decided to part ways with Connectus Group. He sold his shares in the company to PN, 19', 'who then sold them to one Ong Poh Suan, also known as Sharon Ong (\u201cSO\u201d). 20', 'She is the wife of Edwin Lim Tow Ee (\u201cEL\u201d), 21', 'another former colleague of AS and SS from Hudson, and one of the central players in the eventual disputes between the parties. It is not disputed that the AS, SS and EL had known each other for some time, even before they worked together in Hudson. EL was looking to leave Hudson to join Connectus Group. He was introduced by AS and SS to PN. EL wanted to take up LTH\u2019s stake in Connectus Group, and AS, SS and PN then agreed to have him come on board as their fourth shareholder and also to become the Chief Executive Officer (\u201cCEO\u201d) of the company. 22', '14\\u2003The trouble was that EL was an inveterate gambler and often found himself in debt. 23', 'He did not have the funds needed to buy LTH\u2019s stake. EL approached his father, Lim Meng Foo (\u201cLMF\u201d), for the capital. LMF\u2019s unchallenged evidence is that he agreed to pay for the 23.4% stake in Connectus Group so that EL could become the CEO of the company. He would not have come up with the funds if EL was not going to be offered the job of CEO. However, knowing his son\u2019s gambling habits, LMF decided that it would be best that the 23.4% stake be registered in the name of EL\u2019s wife, SO. 24', 'She was also appointed as a director of the company.', '15\\u2003Hence, with the departure of LTH, the four shareholders in Connectus Group were AS, SS, APBA and SO, in the same shareholding proportion as before, save that SO stepped into the shoes of LTH. In effecting the transfer of the Connectus Group shares from PN to SO, a document was executed by PN, APBA, AS and SS, which stated, amongst other things, that \u201cAPBA, Alex, Stacey and Ng agree to waive the SHA completely and immediately\u201d. 25', 'While these words on the SHA are quite ambiguous, the evidence of the parties before me was that they treated the SHA as no longer having any legal force. Neither side relied on any of the SHA provisions as continuing to give them any particular rights as shareholders or to impose any legal obligations on the other shareholders.', '16\\u2003In 2013, Connectus Group started taking steps to establish a presence in China. As prevailing government regulations in China did not permit Connectus Group to immediately set up a subsidiary in China, alternative arrangements in China had to be found in order for the company to be able to operate there. 26', '17\\u2003On 27 March 2013, Connectus Group entered into a Cooperation Agreement (the \u201cCooperation Agreement\u201d) with a Chinese company called Shanghai Lethic Business Consulting Co Ltd (\u201cSLBC\u201d). 27', 'This was a company that was majority owned and controlled by a businessman called Chary Zhu De Quan, 28', 'who the parties referred to simply as \u201cChary\u201d. 29', 'PN also has a shareholding interest in SLBC. 30', 'In fact, it was PN who had introduced the other shareholders of Connectus Group to Chary. 31', '18\\u2003The parties have variously described the Cooperation Agreement with SLBC as a \u201cjoint collaboration agreement\u201d or a \u201cjoint collaborative agreement\u201d. 32', 'This was always intended to be a transitional arrangement until Connectus Group could establish its own subsidiary in China. In essence, pursuant to the Cooperation Agreement, Connectus Group would deposit RMB 1.2m of investment funds with SLBC. In turn, SLBC would set up the entire business infrastructure to allow Connectus Group to operate in China, including the hiring of employees and acting as the payroll agent. The operating expenses would be paid for in the first instance by SLBC. The Cooperation Agreement also provided that SLBC would also sign contracts on Connectus Group\u2019s behalf, issue invoices and also collect on all payments. SLBC would also charge a management fee to Connectus Group. 33', '19\\u2003While the Cooperation Agreement was, on paper, only between Connectus Group and SLBC, it is not disputed that there were two other stakeholders. Bonnie Wang and Frank Zhang (collectively, \u201cthe Chinese partners\u201d) were two former colleagues of AS in Hudson who worked in China. They were now part of the management team of the Chinese operations of Connectus Group, and they together own 33.33% of the business there. 34', 'Hence, they contributed RMB 300,000 out of the RMB 1.2m of investment funds that were deposited with SLBC. 35', 'However, as far as SLBC was concerned, the entire amount of RMB 1.2m was booked as coming from Connectus Group. The parties have collectively referred to the business arrangement with the Chinese partners as the \u201cjoint venture in China\u201d. 36', '20\\u2003AS was based in China and was the head of the operations of the joint venture there. His evidence was that the profits generated by the joint venture was a total of about RMB 3.335m for the years 2013 to 2015. 37', 'This figure is corroborated by Profit & Losses statements (\u201cP&L Statements\u201d) signed off by AS on behalf of Connectus Group from 2013 to 2015, which show that the joint venture\u2019s gross profit for the years 2013, 2014 and 2015 were RMB 164,674.03, RMB 1,904,825.51 and RMB 1,265,591.44 respectively; 38', 'the three figures add up to approximately RMB 3.335m.', '21\\u2003After three years of operation, Connectus Group was permitted under Chinese regulations to set up a wholly-owned subsidiary in China. In 2016, Connectus Business Consulting (Shanghai) Co Ltd was established as a wholly-owned foreign subsidiary. Parties referred to this company as \u201cConnectus WFOE\u201d, with WFOE being the acronym for \u201cwholly foreign-owned enterprise\u201d. 39', 'As the name suggests, Connectus WFOE is 100% owned by Connectus Group. 40', '22\\u2003On 27 April 2016, Shanghai Connectus Group Co Ltd (\u201cConnectus Shanghai\u201d) was established with the following shareholding \u2013 66.67% owned by Connectus WFOE and 33.33% owned collectively by the Chinese partners. 41', '23\\u2003Eventually, the business of the joint venture in China was transferred from SLBC to Connectus Shanghai and carried out through that new company. 42', '24\\u2003In the second half of 2016, Connectus Group executed an agreement with Shanghai Lethic Talent Services Co., Ltd (\u201cSLTS\u201d), which was dated 1 August 2016. 43', 'This is another company substantially owned and controlled by Chary. PN also has a shareholding interest in SLTS.', '25\\u2003Under this agreement, SLTS acknowledged that it owed a \u201cconsultancy fee\u201d of about RMB 3.335m to Connectus Group and that this would be paid on or before 31 March 2017. 44', 'It is not in dispute that Connectus Group did not provide any consultancy services to SLTS. This agreement had been suggested by Connectus Group\u2019s auditors as a device by which the company could recognise the approximately RMB 3.335m profits of the Chinese joint venture in the accounts of Connectus Group. 45', 'In fact, there was another agreement signed between the same parties slightly earlier where SLTS confirmed that it was holding on Connectus Group\u2019s behalf \u201caccumulated profits\u201d from the Chinese joint venture in the amount of approximately RMB 3.335m. 46', 'But, there is no dispute that this agreement was superseded by the one describing the amount of RMB 3.335m as a \u201cconsultancy fee\u201d that was owed.', '26\\u2003The reason for SLTS\u2019s involvement must be explained. It is not entirely clear what the arrangements were but, it appears that, while SLBC was the party to the Cooperation Agreement with Connectus Group, the parties agreed for SLTS to be the entity that actually held the cash receipts that was generated by the business of the joint venture in China. 47', '27\\u2003In 2015, Connectus Group was short of cash and needed funds. It turned to another company substantially owned and controlled by Chary called Talent-Spot Asia Co., Limited (\u201cTSHK\u201d), which is incorporated in Hong Kong, for loans. These were interest-bearing loans. A loan agreement was executed sometime in late September 2016, but back-dated to 31 December 2015, after the disbursement of most of the loans in 2015. 48', 'The loan agreement set out the various amounts and the interest payable. There was another loan agreement dated 1 July 2016 which dealt with some smaller loan amounts. 49', 'About RMB 4m was borrowed by Connectus Group from TSHK in total.', '28\\u2003On behalf of Connectus Group, AS cancelled the \u201cconsultancy fee\u201d agreement with SLTS in 11 October 2017. 50', 'This was done without board approval or consultation with his other directors. His evidence was that, while he had initially agreed to have such an agreement, he now felt that it was a sham and was done only to \u201cwindow dress\u201d the accounts of Connectus Group. 51', '29\\u2003The loans made by TSHK to Connectus Group in 2015 were not the only loans taken by the company. In 2013 and 2014, the shareholders had made loans to the company of varying amounts, in proportion to their respective shareholding. There were loan agreements that were prepared and signed by all the shareholders, setting out the interest amounts. These were intended to be short-term loans to help the company tide over cash-flow difficulties, and there were dates stipulated for repayments of these loans. 52', 'But, Connectus Group never had enough money to repay the shareholder loans in full. 53', '30\\u2003In 2017, AS made further short-term loans to Connectus Group to keep it going. In that year, a total of S$275,000 was lent to the company by AS, with an agreed rate of interest of 10%. 54', 'Unlike the shareholder loans made in 2013 and 2014, these further loan agreements were only signed by AS, as lender, and EL, in his capacity as CEO of Connectus Group. 55', 'Nonetheless, PN admitted that he knew about these loans. 56', '31\\u2003The relationship between the shareholders was fraught with difficulties from sometime in 2014. After APBA became a shareholder, it seconded one of its employees, Kwang Chan Pong (\u201cKwang\u201d), 57', 'to act as the Chief Financial Officer (\u201cCFO\u201d) of Connectus Group. In this way, APBA took charge of the accounting function for Connectus Group. 58', 'After his appointment as CFO, Kwang reported that EL had been drawing his commissions from Connectus Group in advance of when they would normally be paid, which is when the company brought in a profit. 59', 'It appears that EL was taking advances on these commissions because he needed to fund his gambling habit.', '32\\u2003After Kwang had pointed out to the shareholders that Connectus Group was actually borrowing money to pay EL his commissions in advance and that revenue had been wrongly booked into the accounts of Connectus Group so that EL could draw commissions, 60', 'the relationship that EL had with APBA started to strain considerably. In September 2014, EL caused Connectus Group to stop payment of fees due to APBA for consultancy and accounting services. 61', 'When EL proposed that Kwang be removed as the CFO, PN objected to this. 62', 'Despite this, Kwang eventually left his position as the CFO in May 2015. 63', 'PN also claimed to have objected to Connectus Group taking loans from TSHK in 2015, but this was sanctioned by AS and EL. 64', '33\\u2003Matters came to a head in July 2015. It appears that, by this time, AS, SS and EL (and hence SO) had formed a faction within Connectus Group. They could not get along with PN, and wanted to bring in a new investor to replace him. On 21 July 2015, AS, SS and SO sent a letter to the board of directors of Connectus Group to requisition an Extraordinary General Meeting (\u201cEGM\u201d) of the company to be convened in order for a resolution to be passed for the removal of PN as a director. 65', 'Almost immediately, PN responded by demanding, through a lawyer\u2019s letter, that EL repay a personal loan of S$100,000 that he had made to him. 66', '34\\u2003An EGM of Connectus Group was convened on 11 August 2015. 67', 'Several days before that, on 5 August 2015, APBA issued a letter to AS, SS, SO and the company secretary in response to the notice of EGM that had been issued.

As such, there is no basis for [PN] to be excluded from management (and removed as a director) whilst we are still a shareholder of the Company.

What transpired at that meeting and what EL and PN might have agreed has not been disclosed to the Court. But, what happened after that meeting was that EL immediately had a discussion with AS and SS, where he told them that he, and hence SO, was withdrawing his support for the resolution to remove PN as a director. 70', 'The EGM then proceeded with the requisitioning shareholders agreeing to withdraw their proposed resolution. 71', 'PN denied that there was any such private discussion with EL just before the start of the EGM. 72', '36\\u2003The financial situation of Connectus Group did not improve in 2016 and 2017.

{"casename":"2019_SGHC_233","fact":"'3\\u2003I begin with the salient facts. The appellant in HC\/MA 9358\/2018\/01 (\u201cthe appellant\u201d) pleaded guilty and was convicted of four charges under ss 323 and 324 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (\u201cPenal Code\u201d) punishable under s 73(2) of the Penal Code, as well as one charge under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (Cap 91A, 2009 Rev Ed). In brief, the appellant had committed various acts of abuse against her domestic helper (\u201cthe victim\u201d), including scalding the victim by pouring hot water on her back, placing a hot iron on her hands, and failing to provide the victim with adequate rest. She also consented to four other charges, involving other acts of abuse, being taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. According to the statement of facts, which the appellant accepted without qualification, the appellant committed these offences for various reasons arising out of her frustration or anger with the victim: for example, she splashed hot water on the victim because the victim ate a longan without the appellant\u2019s permission and denied having done so; she burned the victim\u2019s hands with an iron because the victim was doing work slowly and the appellant was \u201cfurious\u201d with her; and she would poke the victim with a bamboo pole when the victim made a mistake doing her chores or was caught sleeping inside the toilet.', '4\\u2003After the appellant was duly convicted, she tendered by her counsel a mitigation plea which asserted that she was suffering from a mental illness at the material time that significantly affected her culpability at the time of the offences. Specifically, it was asserted that the appellant suffered from Major Depressive Disorder (\u201cMDD\u201d) with psychotic features, and that the appellant experienced auditory hallucinations which made her commit the offences. The reports of two psychiatrists, Dr Lim Cui Xi (\u201cDr Lim\u201d) and Dr Calvin Fones (\u201cDr Fones\u201d), were appended to the mitigation plea in support of this assertion. The appellant\u2019s counsel, however, was at pains to emphasise that there was no intention to qualify the plea. Rather, the assertion being advanced was that the appellant\u2019s culpability was significantly diminished because there was, allegedly, a causal link between the appellant\u2019s mental illness and her offending. The Prosecution promptly took the point that it was disputing the assertion that the appellant experienced auditory hallucinations when she committed the offences in question, and that the appellant should be made to testify at a Newton hearing:', '5\\u2003The appellant\u2019s counsel took the position at the hearing below that a Newton hearing was not necessary, primarily on the basis that the evidence of both psychiatrists were consistent. The appellant\u2019s counsel however wished nonetheless to call Dr Fones as a witness \u201cto further clarify some aspects of his report\u201d. The Prosecution on the other hand maintained that a Newton hearing was necessary because the main point of contention between the parties was not whether the appellant was or was not suffering from MDD, but whether in fact she experienced and acted under the influence of the claimed auditory hallucinations at the time of the offences:', '6\\u2003In fact, the Prosecution made it abundantly clear that the Newton hearing was necessary only because of the allegations of auditory hallucinations and not on account of the diagnosis of MDD:', '7\\u2003Having heard the parties\u2019 submissions on whether a Newton hearing was necessary, the District Judge was of the opinion that he should first allow the psychiatrists to give evidence and defer the decision as to whether the hearing should be converted into a Newton hearing until he had heard what each psychiatrist had to say, because it might not ultimately be relevant to determine whether the appellant actually heard voices.', '8\\u2003Dr Fones was thereafter called to give evidence, and was examined by the appellant\u2019s counsel and cross-examined by the Prosecution. Midway through the cross-examination of Dr Fones, both parties made further submissions on whether the hearing should be converted into a Newton hearing. The appellant\u2019s counsel maintained that a Newton hearing was not necessary, because both psychiatrists agreed that the appellant had experienced auditory hallucinations. The District Judge eventually accepted the Prosecution\u2019s submission that since what was in dispute was \u201cthe factual occurrence of auditory hallucinations\u201d and that would ultimately have a bearing on the appellant\u2019s sentence, a Newton hearing ought to be convened. The hearing was therefore converted into a Newton hearing, and the appellant\u2019s counsel was given the opportunity to further examine Dr Fones before the Prosecution resumed with cross-examination. Dr Lim was then examined by the appellant\u2019s counsel and thereafter cross-examined by the Prosecution. Even though it was clear that the main point of contention between the parties concerned only the existence of the appellant\u2019s auditory hallucinations, the psychiatrists were examined on their evidence more generally, including on their diagnosis of MDD and the severity of the appellant\u2019s symptoms of MDD.', '9\\u2003The gist of the psychiatrists\u2019 oral evidence as well as the evidence contained in their psychiatric reports was largely consistent: both psychiatrists were of the opinion that the appellant suffered from MDD with psychotic features, these being the auditory hallucinations, and that the illness was causally linked to the appellant\u2019s offending, in that the auditory hallucinations significantly affected the appellant\u2019s actions, such as by affecting her inhibitions and making her believe things about the victim. It was not in dispute that both psychiatrists\u2019 opinions that the appellant experienced auditory hallucinations were based on the appellant\u2019s self-reports of the same, although both psychiatrists also gave evidence that they had ruled out malingering as the appellant\u2019s self-reporting was consistent with nursing observations and the psychiatrists\u2019 own observations of her behaviour.', '10\\u2003Apart from the two psychiatrists, the Prosecution also called the investigation officer (\u201cIO\u201d) as a witness in the Newton hearing, and adduced two of the appellant\u2019s investigation statements through the IO. The appellant\u2019s counsel objected to this since the voluntariness of the investigation statements was not in dispute, but the Prosecution argued that it was necessary to do so since Dr Fones had expressed surprise at how the appellant could provide such detail in these investigation statements. The Prosecution also argued that the IO\u2019s evidence would be relevant to the District Judge\u2019s consideration of the appellant\u2019s behaviour at the material time since it related to observations of the appellant soon after the time of her arrest. The District Judge allowed the Prosecution to call the IO as a witness, on the basis that examination would be limited to the circumstances under which the investigation statements were recorded.', '11\\u2003In these investigation statements, the appellant had given various reasons for her offending behaviour, such as that she had \u201ccompletely lost trust in all of [her] maids\u201d and \u201cwanted to be firm [with the victim] so that she would not end up being replaced often\u201d. These statements also revealed some of the motivations for the specific offences, although these differed slightly from the statement of facts. For instance, the appellant said that she burned the victim\u2019s hands with an iron because she caught the victim sleeping while ironing, and not because she found the victim to be slow in doing chores. In addition, the appellant said that she poured hot water on the victim\u2019s back because she was very angry about something that the victim had done, but did not reveal that this was because the victim had eaten a longan without permission. The IO further testified that the appellant had been coherent during the recording of the investigation statements and had not mentioned hearing voices or demonstrated any other observable signs suggestive of her being susceptible to any auditory or other hallucinations. The IO therefore had not thought it necessary to send her for a psychiatric assessment.', '12\\u2003Notwithstanding the Prosecution\u2019s position that the appellant should give direct evidence at the Newton hearing on the assertion that she had at the relevant times experienced and acted under the influence of auditory hallucinations, the appellant did not take the stand. The appellant\u2019s counsel informed the District Judge at the conclusion of the Newton hearing that it was for him to decide how he would make out his case and he did not provide any reasons for not calling the appellant, save to say that the evidence adduced through the two psychiatrists was sufficient to establish what he wanted to establish.', '13\\u2003The District Judge accepted that the appellant was suffering at the time of the offences from MDD with psychotic features, by which he appeared to be referring to the auditory hallucinations, and that there was a causal link between this and the appellant\u2019s offending. Even though the appellant did not testify at all, the District Judge was of the opinion that this did not materially affect the evidence that he did take into account, \u201cgiven the nature of the Newton hearing which was to determine something that was within the expertise of the psychiatrists\u201d. It is not entirely clear from the grounds of decision (Public Prosecutor v Anita Damu @ Shazana bt Abdullah [2019] SGDC 35 at [5] and [24]) whether the District Judge made a specific finding that the appellant was suffering from auditory hallucinations at the time of the offences. However, I consider on balance that it is at least implicit in his decision that he did make such a finding. I take this view for two reasons. First, the District Judge was plainly alive to the fact that this was the issue that was contested by the Prosecution and ultimately this was the question he was being asked to resolve. Second, he found that the appellant was suffering from MDD with psychotic features and it was evident from what was presented before him that the auditory hallucinations were part of the relevant psychotic symptoms. However, the District Judge was not satisfied that the appellant had been significantly deprived of self-control or the ability to appreciate the nature and consequences of her actions, and thus considered deterrence and retribution to be the dominant sentencing principles in the instant case such that a custodial sentence was appropriate. The District Judge considered the sentencing framework for domestic maid abuse in Tay Wee Kiat and another v Public Prosecutor and another appeal [2018] 4 SLR 1315, and took into consideration the egregious acts of physical abuse committed over a protracted period of time, the psychological harm suffered by the victim, and the appellant\u2019s mental disorder. Having considered all this, he sentenced the appellant to an aggregate sentence of 31 months\u2019 imprisonment. The appellant was also ordered to pay compensation to the victim in the sum of $8,000, in addition to the voluntary compensation of $4,000 already paid.', '14\\u2003The appellant and the Prosecution both filed appeals against the sentence as well as the compensation order (vide HC\/MA 9358\/2018\/01 and HC\/MA 9358\/2018\/02 respectively), and the appeals came before me on 19 July 2019. The appellant\u2019s position at the appeal was that she ought to have been given a non-custodial sentence in view of the diagnosis of MDD with psychotic features and the effect this had on her culpability. The Prosecution on the other hand contended that the psychiatrists\u2019 opinions on the appellant\u2019s auditory hallucinations should be rejected on the ground that these were based entirely on the appellant\u2019s own accounts, which were unbelievable and internally inconsistent. The Prosecution contended that the appellant\u2019s MDD, which was not disputed, had no relevance to the sentence to be imposed because absent the auditory hallucinations, it was devoid of mitigating value.', '15\\u2003At the hearing, it seemed to me that the parties may have been at cross purposes. It was clear that the Prosecution was not disputing the fact that the appellant was suffering from a mental illness. What it was disputing was the factual assertion that she was experiencing and acting under the influence of the auditory hallucinations at the material times. It seemed to me, even if the point was not squarely put in these terms by the Prosecution, that this was a question of fact on which the direct evidence of the appellant was most relevant, but conspicuously absent; whereas the evidence of the psychiatrists on this issue was either irrelevant and inadmissible, or alternatively, possibly admissible as corroborative evidence in the sense of being able to support a factual contention by the appellant that she was experiencing and acting under the influence of auditory hallucinations by establishing that such a contention was consistent with the medical diagnosis. I made known these concerns to the parties. Since this was not something that the parties had expressly addressed in their submissions, the hearing was then adjourned for the parties to make further submissions on three questions, which I framed in consultation with the parties:', '(a)\\u2003What is the status of the psychiatrists\u2019 evidence, given that the appellant herself has not given evidence on the factual assertion that she heard voices at the time of the offences?', '(b)\\u2003Given the inconsistencies in the position taken by the appellant at the time of the plead guilty mention and what is set out in the statement of facts, how should the court now deal with the statement of facts?', '(c)\\u2003In view of the above, what are the appropriate orders to be made at this stage?', '16\\u2003To assist parties in their submissions, and at their request, I also set out my provisional views on these issues, as follows:'"}

Edmund, \nPatty and two others agreed to join forces and formed a new company, Suying \nMetropolitan Studio Pte Ltd (\u201cSMSPL\u201d), the 1st defendant. The agreement was \nmade orally (\u201cthe Oral Agreement\u201d) and, not surprisingly, its terms were \ndisputed. \nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nNg Kian Huan Edmund v Suying Metropolitan Studio Pte Ltd[2019] SGHC 234\n23 In these proceedings, Edmund\u2019s main claim was for minority oppression \nunder s 216 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) against Patty in \nconnection with the affairs of SMSPL. Some of the grounds relied upon in the \noppression claim involved certain payments made by SMSPL to SDPL and \nPatty, as well as certain payments that were payable by SDPL to SMSPL. As \npart of his claim, Edmund sought orders requiring SDPL and Patty to pay these \nsums of money to SMSPL.\n4 Edmund also sought certain orders against SMSPL in relation to his \nsalary, director\u2019s fees and dividends. \n5 SMSPL made numerous counterclaims:\n(a) Counterclaims against Edmund for repayment of director\u2019s fees \nand dividends received by Edmund, breaches of director\u2019s duties in \nconnection with numerous projects, breaches of confidentiality, \nnegligence in connection with several projects, payment of monies \nreceived by Edmund, repayment of Edmund\u2019s vehicle allowance, and \nadvances to Edmund. \n(b) Counterclaims against MOX for reimbursement for the use of \nSMSPL\u2019s resources.\n(c) A counterclaim against Edmund and MOX in respect of certain \nexpenses charged to SMSPL.\n(d) A counterclaim against Edmund and his wife, Ms Chong Chin \nFong (\u201cJazz\u201d) for an indemnity.\n(e) A counterclaim against Jazz for services rendered.\nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nNg Kian Huan Edmund v Suying Metropolitan Studio Pte Ltd[2019] SGHC 234\n36 Initially, Patty\u2019s counterclaim was for an order to authorise proceedings \nin SMSPL\u2019s name or on behalf of it, against Edmund. After Patty filed her \ndefence and counterclaim, SMSPL amended its defence to include its \ncounterclaim against Edmund. Patty\u2019s counterclaim was therefore moot save \nthat Patty counterclaimed for the costs of having had to raise her counterclaim.\n7 In the Judgment, \n(a) I accepted Edmund\u2019s version of the terms of the Oral Agreement \n(the Judgment at [76]). \n(b) I found in favour of Edmund on his oppression claim and ordered \nthat SMSPL be wound up (the Judgment at [203]\u2013[218]).\n(c) I directed SMSPL\u2019s accounts for 2012 and 2013 to be adjusted \nto give effect to my findings on certain issues that affected the accounts \n(the Judgment at [364]).\n(d) I found that Patty had breached the terms of the Oral Agreement \nby wrongfully refusing or failing to cause SDPL to pay $1,320,586.67, \n$1,545,904 and $36,272.89 to SMSPL (the Judgment at [203(h)]\u2013\n[203(i)]).

The victim,  an elderly lady of about 77 \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nCai Mei Ying v  PP [2019]  SGHC  24\n2years old, sustained a fracture which required a screw to be fixed.

Instead, I accept that the specific circumstances of this case \nmerited the imposition of a custodial sentence.  \n4 I agree with the District Judge that the appellant\u2019s culpability was \nmoderate, given  that she knowingly cycled  in a narrow and confined  area that \nprohibited cycling. This is thus a place where pedestrians are less likely to be \naware of cyclists and where they are entitled to feel safe from harm  and injury \nfrom negligent cycling. I agree that the categorisation of the present case by the \nDistrict Judge within the second category  of Tang Ling Lee v Public Prosecutor \n[2018] SGHC 18 as involving  greater  harm and lower culpability  or lesser harm \nand higher culpability would be appropriate.  But in any event, I do accept that \nthe harm in this case is at the \u201cgreater\u201d rather than the \u201clesser\u201d end of the \nspectrum. The victim\u2019s  injuries affected her mobility and required surgical \ncorrection. I also agree with the District Judge that there was a need  for general \ndeterrence, given  the recent rise in bicycle and personal mobility  device-related \naccidents.\n5 In the circumstances,  I find that the sentence of two weeks\u2019 \nimprisonment is not manifestly  excessive. I see no reason to depart from  the \nsentence imposed by the  District Judge. \n6 I appreciate the efforts of Mr Clarence  Ding (\u201cMr Ding\u201d), who was \nappointed as the young amicus curiae in this case to assist with the consideration \nof a sentencing framework for offences  under s 338(b) of the Penal  Code  where  \ngrievous hurt is caused  by the negligent riding of bicycles and personal mobility \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nCai Mei Ying v  PP [2019]  SGHC  24\n3devices (\u201cPMDs\u201d).  I do note that it is likely that a sentencing framework would \nbe needed for cases involving bicycle or PMD accidents on pavements with \npedestrians as victims. But I suspect that such situations would call for careful \nconsideration of a number of other  factors and sentencing  imperatives; it may \nbe best to allow a number of cases to be brought before  the courts before such \na framework is established, so that the relevant considerations can be sieved out \nthrough the adversarial process. I would thus leave  it for another day for the \nframework to be laid down.  Mr Ding\u2019s contributions have not been in vain, and \nI would suggest that he be considered again for such a case, subject of course to \nhis availability and willingness at that time.\n7 It remains for me then to also reiterate that shared  spaces,  whether roads \nor pavements, require  most of all consideration and courtesy between all users.  \nI hope that it will not come to pass that we will need a sentencing framework  \nfor pavement  collisions, but real life will probably prove otherwise. I would \nstrongly urge those on bicycles and PMDs  to exercise such due care and \nconsideration; where injuries do arise because  of the fault of the rider,  it is likely \nthat the courts  will take a stern view and impose custodial  sentences, which may \nbe higher  than what has  been imposed in this case.  \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nCai Mei Ying v  PP [2019]  SGHC  24\n48 To reiterate,"}

Under this order, with effect from 1 December 2015, all property, rights and liabilities comprised in the undertaking of the former AHPETC to which AHPETC was entitled or subject immediately before 1 December 2015 and that related to or were connected with Punggol-East SMC, would become the property, rights and liabilities of PRPTC, and any proceedings or cause of action that related to the transferred undertaking that were pending or existing immediately before that date might be continued and enforced by or against PRPTC.', '8\\u2003As a result of the foregoing, the Town Council that is the subject of the present suits was known by different names at different points of time:', 'In this judgment, except where greater specificity is required, the Town Council shall be referred to consistently as AHTC for the sake of simplicity. For the purposes of identifying the plaintiffs when discussing the positions taken and submissions advanced by them in the present suits, I will refer to them as \u201cthe plaintiffs\u201d collectively, or as \u201cAHTC\u201d and \u201cPRPTC\u201d respectively where there is a material difference in their respective positions. In the remainder of this judgment, I will use the term \u201cTown Council\u201d to refer generally to town councils constituted under the TCA.', '9\\u2003The first defendant in both suits is Ms Sylvia Lim. From June 2011 to August 2015, she was Chairman of AHTC, and from October 2015 to present she was and continues to be Vice-Chairman of AHTC.', '10\\u2003The second defendant is Mr Low Thia Khiang, who was the elected Member of Parliament (\u201cMP\u201d) for the electoral division of Hougang SMC from 1991 to 2011, prior to the 2011 GE. He was Vice-Chairman of AHTC from 3 June 2011 to August 2012.', '11\\u2003The third defendant is Mr Pritam Singh, who was also an elected MP of AHTC, as well as Vice-Chairman of AHTC from August 2012 to August 2015, and thereafter Chairman of AHTC from October 2015 to present.', '12\\u2003Ms Sylvia Lim, Mr Low Thia Khiang and Mr Pritam Singh, along with Mr Chen Show Mao and Mr Muhamad Faisal bin Abdul Manap (\u201cMr Muhamad Faisal\u201d), formed the slate of WP candidates elected as MPs for Aljunied GRC at the 2011 GE. Following the merger of ATC and HTC to form AHTC, Mr Yaw Shin Leong also formed part of the group of WP members elected to manage AHTC as town councillors. Mr Yaw Shin Leong was replaced by Mr Png Eng Huat of the WP following a by-election for Hougang SMC held on 26 May 2012. References to the elected MPs in the rest of this judgment thus refer to the MPs who were elected to manage AHTC at the relevant time, although of these elected MPs, only Ms Sylvia Lim, Mr Low Thia Khiang and Mr Pritam Singh are defendants to the present suits.', '13\\u2003The fourth and fifth defendants are Mr Chua Zhi Hon (\u201cMr David Chua\u201d) and Mr Kenneth Foo Seck Guan (\u201cMr Kenneth Foo\u201d), who were appointed as town councillors to manage AHTC.', '14\\u2003Under the TCA, the elected MPs of a Town Council are known as its \u201celected members\u201d (s 2(1) TCA). Thus, MPs automatically become members of the Town Council without the need for separate appointment. One of the elected MPs (if there is more than one) is appointed Chairman of the Town Council under s 9(1) TCA. The Chairman of the Town Council then appoints other, non-elected, members under s 8(1)(b) TCA. These members are known as its \u201cappointed members\u201d (s 2(1) TCA). The Town Council consists of the elected and appointed members (s 8(1) TCA). The members of the Town Council are commonly known as \u201ctown councillors\u201d, which is a term I will also use in this judgment to refer to both the elected and appointed members.', '15\\u2003From June 2012, Ms Sylvia Lim, Mr Pritam Singh, Mr David Chua and Mr Kenneth Foo were part of the Tenders and Contracts Committee (\u201cthe Tender Committee\u201d) following a Town Council meeting on 14 June 2012. Mr Pritam Singh was the Chairman of the Tender Committee. The Tender Committee was responsible for vetting specifications of tenders called by AHTC, evaluating tenders received and deciding on the award of tenders.', '16\\u2003The sixth defendant is Ms How Weng Fan, who was married to Mr Danny Loh Chong Meng (\u201cMr Danny Loh\u201d), and is a personal representative of Mr Danny Loh\u2019s estate, the seventh defendant. Mr Danny Loh was Secretary of AHTC from 1 August 2011 to 31 May 2015, whereas Ms How Weng Fan was Deputy Secretary from 9 June 2011 to 14 July 2015. Ms How Weng Fan was also the General Manager from 1 August 2011 to 14 July 2015. Ms How Weng Fan was also Estate Manager\/General Manager\/Secretary of HTC from 1991 to 2011, before the 2011 GE. Further, Mr Danny Loh was the sole proprietor of FM Solutions and Integrated Services (\u201cFMSI\u201d). Mr Danny Loh passed away on 27 June 2015. However, for the purposes of identification and attribution, my references to \u201cMr Danny Loh\u201d include references to his estate when it comes to the positions taken in the present proceedings, as well as on the issue of liability.', '17\\u2003The eighth defendant is FM Solutions and Services Pte Ltd (\u201cFMSS\u201d). FMSS was incorporated in Singapore on 15 May 2011 with Mr Danny Loh as the initial sole director and sole shareholder. Ms How Weng Fan was appointed a director of FMSS on 16 June 2011. The next day, on 17 June 2011, new shareholders of FMSS were introduced, namely Ms How Weng Fan, Mr Yeo Soon Fei, Mr Vincent Koh and Mr Chng Jong Ling. Under the new shareholding structure, Mr Danny Loh and Ms How Weng Fan held 50% and 20% of the shares in FMSS respectively, whereas the remaining three shareholders each held 10% of the shares in FMSS.', '18\\u2003Between 15 July 2011 and 14 July 2015, FMSS provided managing agent (\u201cMA\u201d) and project management services to AHTC. Further, between 1 October 2011 and 30 June 2015, FMSS also provided emergency maintenance services under the Essential Maintenance Service Unit (commonly known as \u201cEMSU services\u201d). Thus, between 15 July 2011 and 30 June 2015, the following four contracts for these services, which are at the core of the claims in this case, were in place between FMSS and AHTC:', 'Apart from the four contracts above, Mr Danny Loh, through his sole proprietorship FMSI, also provided EMSU services to HTC, and later AHTC, from 15 October 2007 to 14 October 2012, pursuant to a separate EMSU contract (\u201cthe FMSI EMSU contract\u201d). The FMSI EMSU contract was entered into by the former HTC prior to the 2011 GE, and later migrated to AHTC following the amalgamation of HTC and ATC. Following the migration, the services rendered pursuant to the FMSI EMSU contract were for the Hougang residents of AHTC.', '19\\u2003Prior to the engagement of FMSS, MA services for ATC and subsequently AHTC were provided by CPG Facilities Management Pte Ltd (\u201cCPG\u201d) pursuant to a contract that was set to expire in July 2013 (\u201cthe CPG MA contract\u201d), with an option to extend for a further three years. EMSU services for AHTC, excluding the estates covered by the FMSI EMSU contract, were provided by CPG, with the exception of the Kaki Bukit precinct. The EMSU services for that precinct were provided by EM Services Pte Ltd (\u201cEM Services\u201d). Both CPG and EM Services\u2019 contracts for EMSU services were to expire on 30 September 2011. CPG\u2019s key representative to AHTC was Mr Jeffrey Chua, who also served as General Manager of AHTC from May 2011 to August 2011 and Secretary of AHTC from June 2011 to July 2011.', '20\\u2003On 10 February 2014, AHTC submitted its audited financial statements for the financial year ending 31 March 2013. The auditor\u2019s report prepared by Foo Kon Tan Grant Thornton LLP contained a disclaimer of opinion based on 13 grounds of qualification.', '21\\u2003On 19 February 2014, the Deputy Prime Minister, upon the request of the Minister for National Development, exercised his powers under s 4(4) of the Audit Act (Cap 17, 1999 Rev Ed) and directed the Auditor-General to undertake an audit of AHTC\u2019s financial statements. The Auditor-General in turn appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (\u201cPwC\u201d) to undertake an audit of selected aspects of the financial statements on behalf of and acting under the authority of the Auditor-General. The Auditor-General\u2019s Office (\u201cAGO\u201d) issued its final report incorporating the findings of PwC on 9 February 2015 (\u201cthe Auditor-General\u2019s Report\u201d), following which the Ministry of National Development (\u201cMND\u201d) commenced proceedings in Originating Summons No 250 of 2015 against AHTC for, inter alia, the appointment of independent accountants.', '22\\u2003The proceedings were eventually heard by the Court of Appeal. On 27 November 2015, the Court of Appeal in its judgment in Attorney-General v Aljunied-Hougang-Punggol East Town Council [2016] 1 SLR 915 (\u201cAHPETC (CA)\u201d) ordered (at [119]), inter alia, that AHTC appoint independent accountants to assist in identifying the outstanding non-compliances with s 35(c) of the TCA, to advise on the steps needed to remedy such non-compliances, and to establish whether any past payments made by AHTC were improper and ought therefore to be recovered.', '23\\u2003Pursuant to the order of the Court of Appeal, AHTC appointed KPMG LLP (\u201cKPMG\u201d) as its independent accountants, whilst PRPTC appointed PwC. On 31 October 2016, KPMG issued a report on its review of the past payments made by AHTC (\u201cthe KPMG report\u201d). PwC also issued a report dated 30 April 2017 on its review of past payments (\u201cthe PwC report\u201d). The plaintiffs rely to a large extent on the findings in these two reports to support their claims.', '24\\u2003Pursuant to a consent order of court dated 17 February 2017, AHTC appointed an Independent Panel to act as agents of AHTC under s 32(2) of the TCA. The Independent Panel thereafter commenced S 668\/2017 in the name of AHTC. The Independent Panel is not instructing PRPTC in S 716\/2017.', '25\\u2003The principal allegation of breach of duties against the defendants relates to the appointment of FMSS under the first MA contract in July 2011 and the first EMSU contract in October 2011. The allegation is grounded on the circumstances surrounding the appointment of FMSS. The plaintiffs\u2019 allegation of breach of duties on the part of the defendants as regards the award of the second MA and EMSU contracts is also rooted in or related to the same circumstances. Thus, it is crucial to comprehensively set out the key events in the months following the 2011 GE as they set the stage for the analysis that is to follow. Finally, the plaintiffs make allegations of breach with regard to the award of various contracts to third parties, which are independent from the circumstances said to surround the award of the first and second MA and EMSU contracts. For the sake of completeness, I will also set out the key facts in relation to these allegations. There is a significant amount of documentary evidence in the form of letters, emails and minutes of Town Council meetings which are important in understanding and elucidating the material circumstances surrounding each of these allegations. In the interests of being comprehensive, I set them out in chronological order and ad verbatim in so far as it is relevant to do so.', '26\\u2003Shortly after the results of the 2011 GE, the MND notified all newly elected MPs of all constituencies by a letter dated 9 May 2011 that the TCA required the formation of Towns on the expiration of 14 days after the publication of the 2011 GE results. The recipients were also informed that after the relevant orders for the declaration and dissolution of Towns were gazetted, the reconstituted Town Councils would assume responsibility for the new areas under their charge with effect from 1 August 2011.', '27\\u2003On the same day, Mr Low Thia Khiang sent the following email to the elected MPs (\u201cthe 9 May 2011 Email\u201d), copying Ms How Weng Fan in the same email:', '28\\u2003It would appear that sometime before 12 May 2011, Mr Low Thia Khiang had a discussion with Ms How Weng Fan concerning the setting up of a company to provide MA services. As a result, on 12 May 2011, Mr Danny Loh applied to ACRA for the company name \u201cFMSS\u201d to be registered.', '29\\u2003On 13 May 2011, Mr Low Thia Khiang received an email from a WP supporter by the name of Mr TT Tan who said that according to his source, \u201cit is quite apparent that [CPG] will be withdrawing from ATC\u201d. Mr TT Tan advised Mr Low Thia Khiang to procure the CPG MA contract and seek legal advice on the same, and also to \u201cstart employing or ask for tender now\u201d. This email was forwarded by Mr Low Thia Khiang to Ms How Weng Fan, and subsequently to the elected MPs.', '30\\u2003Also on 13 May 2011, on Mr Low Thia Khiang\u2019s instructions, Ms How Weng Fan sent a letter to Mr Jeffrey Chua and Ms Png Chiew Hoon, Secretary of Marine Parade Town Council, with the title \u201cRequest for Transfer of Documents and Data\u201d (\u201cthe 13 May 2011 Letter\u201d). The letter was signed by Ms How Weng Fan as Secretary of HTC. The relevant portions of the 13 May 2011 Letter read as follows:', 'Based on a list attached to the 13 May 2011 Letter, Ms How Weng Fan asked for, inter alia, the CPG MA contract.', '31\\u2003On the very next day, on 14 May 2011, following a query from a Straits Times reporter on whether the elected MPs would \u201ctake on all the existing agreements\u201d including the MA agreement with CPG, Mr Low Thia Khiang sent the following email to Ms Sylvia Lim, Mr Pritam Singh, Mr Muhamad Faisal and Mr Chen Show Mao, which was later forwarded to Ms How Weng Fan (\u201cthe 14 May 2011 Email\u201d):', '32\\u2003On 15 May 2011, following approval by ACRA of his application on 12 May 2011, Mr Danny Loh incorporated FMSS with an issued share capital of $500,000 and a paid-up capital of $450,000. He was the sole shareholder and director.', '33\\u2003On 16 May 2011, Mr Jeffrey Chua replied to the 13 May 2011 Letter, informing Ms How Weng Fan that CPG was in the midst of compiling the list of existing term contracts requested, and would hand over the documents progressively. In the same email, Mr Jeffrey Chua drew attention to the fact that the existing EMSU contracts with CPG and EM Services were due to expire on 30 September 2011, and attached the EMSU contracts with the hope that this information would facilitate Ms How Weng Fan to \u201cmake advance preparation to call tenders for new term contracts accordingly\u201d. Mr Jeffrey Chua did not attach the CPG MA contract to the 16 May 2011 email, and it was not sent to the defendants until 13 June 2011 (see [43] below). In response to Ms How Weng Fan\u2019s request for the contact details of the ATC staff so that they could be considered for employment, Mr Jeffrey Chua informed her that CPG was \u201cable to redeploy them to other alternative postings\u201d.', '34\\u2003On 19 May 2011, following a short exchange on possible conflicts of interest that might arise from appointing a representative of a MA to the post of General Manager or Secretary of the Town Council, Mr Low Thia Khiang sent the following email to Ms How Weng Fan:', '35\\u2003On 26 May 2011, Mr Low Thia Khiang sent the following email to the elected MPs, copying Ms How Weng Fan. The subject of the email was \u201cMeeting with [ATC] Managing Agent\u201d:', '36\\u2003On 28 May 2011, Mr Low Thia Khiang sent a short email to Ms How Weng Fan, stating that \u201cAHTC MA should employ All the existing staff of [HTC], at least for a start\u201d. The next day, on 29 May 2011, Ms Sylvia Lim sent an email to the elected MPs to provide \u201can update of what has happened and will need to be done\u201d. She informed them that the \u201cexisting Managing Agent of [ATC], CPG, will report to us until we release them at such date not later than 1 Aug\u201d, and that \u201cJeffrey Chua of CPG will continue [as Secretary of TC] until we release him\u201d, and that \u201c[we] will appoint our Secretary when our MA is ready to take over\u201d.', '37\\u2003On 30 May 2011, the meeting referred to at [35] above took place between the elected MPs, Ms How Weng Fan and representatives from CPG, comprising Mr Jeffrey Chua, his personal assistant Ms Pan Wanjing, and the Deputy General Manager of ATC Mr Seng Joo How. At this meeting, the CPG representatives, using presentation slides, gave an overview of the properties under AHTC\u2019s management, the organisational structure of AHTC, handing over preparations and interim management arrangements. These presentation slides indicated 27 May to 31 July 2011 as the \u201ccare taking period\u201d, and 1 August 2011 as the \u201cappointed date for handover\u201d. Ms Sylvia Lim took handwritten notes during this meeting, the contents of which largely mirrored that of the presentation slides. Significantly, at the corner of the last page of these handwritten notes, she noted a reference to FMSS.', '38\\u2003On 2 June 2011, Ms Sylvia Lim, Mr Low Thia Khiang and Mr Muhamad Faisal met with Mr Danny Loh. Mr Danny Loh made a presentation on behalf of FMSS in relation to the award of the MA contract and the EMSU contract for AHTC. In this presentation, the following was set out as the \u201cFee Proposal\u201d:', 'The presentation slides also set out the following \u201caction plan\u201d:', 'The presentation slides also contained an \u201cAdditional Proposal on EMSU\u201d in the following terms:', '39\\u2003Also on 2 June 2011, Ms How Weng Fan sent an email to the elected MPs stating that \u201c1 August 2011 handover has never been an issue as this handover refers to TC to TC handover and is mandated by MND\u201d. She further stated that \u201c[with] CPG we have always maintained that there is the possibility that we may require them to continue their service until such time that we deem that all matters are properly handed over to the new MA. Indicative period is by a month ie up to 30 September 2011.\u201d', '40\\u2003On 9 June 2011, the first Town Council meeting of the newly reconstituted AHTC was held, and it was attended by, inter alios, all the elected MPs, Ms How Weng Fan, Mr David Chua, Mr Kenneth Foo, Mr Jeffrey Chua, Mr Seng Joo How and Ms Pan Wanjing. The minutes of the meeting reflected that the following was discussed:', 'Notably, there was no discussion of any award of contracts for MA services EMSU services to FMSS, even though the presentation slides for the 2 June 2011 meeting contained a proposal for FMSS to take over the provision of both services.', '41\\u2003After the first Town Council meeting, several emails were exchanged regarding the status of the contract between ATC and NCS Pte Ltd (\u201cNCS\u201d) which had been novated to Action Information Management Pte Ltd (\u201cAIM\u201d). The contract (\u201cthe AIM contract\u201d) licensed the use of a computer software, described as the Town Council Management System (\u201cTCMS\u201d), owned by AIM to ATC. TCMS was used to operate and manage ATC\u2019s financial system. Ms How Weng Fan sent an email to Ms Sylvia Lim on 9 June 2011, attaching the novation agreement between NCS, AIM and ATC, informing her that since the AIM contract expired in October 2011, \u201cthis talk by CPG that NCS will pull out by end July 2011 seems misplaced\u201d, and that AHTC \u201cshould therefore not be pressured into rushing into the completion of [its] computer system by 31 July 2011\u201d.', '42\\u2003The next day, 10 June 2011, Ms How Weng Fan sent another email to Ms Sylvia Lim, informing her that she had spoken to one Mr Sasidharan of AIM to request use of TCMS until 31 August 2011. Ms How Weng Fan relayed that Mr Sasidharan, who \u201csounded very nice and helpful\u201d, informed her that AIM would give notice of termination of the AIM contract, but that AHTC could put in a request for extension of AIM\u2019s services before it was received. This request was duly sent to AIM by Mr Jeffrey Chua on the same day. On 24 June 2011, AIM accepted the request for extension until 31 August 2011. In the meantime, on 23 June 2011, Ms How Weng Fan obtained approval from Ms Sylvia Lim to waive the need for quotations before procuring computer services and equipment, on the basis that the \u201cSecretary of [ATC] had advised that AIMs will terminate the provision of the computer systems to the newly established [AHTC] by 31 July 2011\u201d, and that such waiver of quotation was necessary \u201c[i]n view of the urgency to set up the computer system\u201d.', '43\\u2003On 13 June 2011, Mr Jeffrey Chua emailed Ms How Weng Fan a further response to the 13 May 2011 Letter, attaching this time a list of further agreements including the CPG MA contract, which he informed could be obtained from the AHTC office. This would appear to be the first time Ms How Weng Fan, or for that matter, any of the defendants was given the opportunity to view the CPG MA contract. There was no evidence before me of any further attempts to procure the CPG MA contract in the interim between the 13 May 2011 Letter and Mr Jeffrey Chua\u2019s response on 13 June 2011.', '44\\u2003On 15 June 2011, a letter of intent was sent by FMSS to Ms Sylvia Lim (\u201cthe FMSS LOI\u201d), stating as follows:', 'Notably, the terms in the FMSS LOI broadly tracked the proposed terms set out in the presentation made by Mr Danny Loh on 2 June 2011, save that there was no reference to the \u201cAdditional Proposal on EMSU\u201d services.', '45\\u2003As stated at [17] above, Ms How Weng Fan, Mr Vincent Koh and Mr Yeo Soon Fei became shareholders of FMSS two days after the FMSS LOI was sent, ie, on 17 June 2011.', '46\\u2003Before the FMSS LOI was signed, Ms Sylvia Lim emailed a copy of the same to the elected MPs on 6 July 2011, informing them that \u201cthe rates quoted are similar to the ones CPG is using for [ATC] for its [second year] of service\u201d, and that she intended to sign the FMSS LOI by 8 July 2011 after seeking a clarification on the project management rates.', '47\\u2003Ms Sylvia Lim emailed the request for clarification to Ms How Weng Fan on the same day, followed by the further email below a short while later:', 'Ms How Weng Fan replied to this email on the same day, saying that as there was the FMSS LOI, \u201cthe formal appointment can be made any time after 1 August 2011\u201d.', '48\\u2003The FMSS LOI was signed on behalf of AHTC by Ms Sylvia Lim on 8 July 2011 and Mr Yaw Shin Leong on 18 July 2011, appointing FMSS as the MA of AHTC for a period of one year. This was the basis of the first MA contract.', '49\\u2003On 13 and 14 July 2011, a series of emails were exchanged between Ms Sylvia Lim, Mr Low Thia Khiang, Mr Yaw Shin Leong and Ms How Weng Fan on the subject of postponement of the date for the second Town Council meeting, originally scheduled for 21 July 2011. This began with the following email from Ms Sylvia Lim on 13 July 2011:', '50\\u2003Mr Yaw Shin Leong replied to this email on the same day, expressing his view that \u201cwe should be rather transparent\u201d and that \u201c[s]ince we have nothing to hide, Jeffrey\u2019s presence should not be a hindrance for the council to deliberate + to decide the appointment of FM Solutions & Services\u201d. Mr Yaw Shin Leong added that based on his interactions with Mr Jeffrey Chua thus far, he \u201chas found him to be a reasonable and responsible person\u201d. However, Mr Low Thia Khiang took a different view, and sent out the following email on 13 July 2011:', '51\\u2003Ms Sylvia Lim then replied to everyone in the email chain on 14 July 2011, agreeing to \u201crelease Jeffrey as secretary and appoint Danny on 1 Aug\u201d and to \u201chave AHTC meeting ASAP after 1 Aug i.e. on 4 Aug, to appoint the MA\u201d. There was also a query as to who should write up a report on the assessment of and the decision to appoint FMSS, to which Mr Low Thia Khiang replied that \u201cDanny can provide the draft report and assessment under your instruction\u201d.', '52\\u2003Further to this correspondence, Ms Sylvia Lim then prepared a draft report to be tabled at the second Town Council meeting in her name, which was sent by her to Mr Low Thia Khiang and Mr Yaw Shin Leong via email on 3 August 2011 (\u201cthe Report on MA appointment\u201d). This report was a revised version of a draft report prepared by Mr Danny Loh. This email was also copied to Mr Danny Loh and Ms How Weng Fan, with the message \u201ccc Danny and Ms How Weng Fan \u2013 fyi and any comments on whether it will pass the auditors\u2019 eyes \u2013 esp re waiver of tender\u201d [emphasis added]. The material portions of the Report on MA appointment read as follows:', '53\\u2003Subsequently, Mr Yaw Shin Leong raised a query on whether there was \u201ca need to disclose to fellow town councilors [sic] regarding the husband & wife relationship of Danny & Ms How\u201d, to which Mr Low Thia Khiang replied that most councillors \u201cknow both of them but no harm to mention it at the meeting\u201d. Mr Yaw Shin Leong followed up with a further query on whether there was \u201ca need to reveal the exact *stakeholdership(s) [sic] of [FMSS] in the TC minutes\/report\u201d, to which Ms Sylvia Lim replied that \u201cwe can \/ should enclose the ACRA search....let me arrange\u201d.', '54\\u2003The second Town Council meeting took place on 4 August 2011, and was attended by the elected MPs with the exception of Mr Muhamad Faisal. Mr Kenneth Foo was present at this meeting, but not Mr David Chua. No representatives from CPG were present, but Mr Danny Loh and Ms How Weng Fan were in attendance and were noted to be representing FMSS. The minutes of meeting recorded that Mr Danny Loh presented FMSS\u2019s MA proposal to all present, after which Mr Danny Loh and Ms How Weng Fan were excused from the meeting to facilitate the discussion by the town councillors. Following the discussion, Mr Danny Loh and Ms How Weng Fan were invited back into the meeting, and \u201cinformed of AHTC\u2019s decisions\u201d awarding the first MA contract to FMSS, in response to which \u201cMr Danny Loh accorded his appreciation for the award\u201d. The minutes also recorded Mr Danny Loh\u2019s declaration that he was the Managing Director and Ms How Weng Fan a director and the General Manager of FMSS. The minutes of the discussion which took place in the absence of Mr Danny Loh and Ms How Weng Fan largely mirrored the contents of the Report on MA appointment, and also recorded the fact that AHTC unanimously agreed to waive the calling of a tender for MA services for one year and to appoint FMSS as MA for the same period. There was no record of any discussion on the contract for the provision of EMSU services.', '55\\u2003The next day, on 5 August 2011, AHTC released a media statement on the appointment of FMSS. The decision not to call a tender for MA services was justified on the basis of the \u201curgency of the timelines [\u2026], and the overriding concern that Town Council services should not be disrupted to the detriment\u201d of the residents, and that there was \u201cinsufficient time\u201d to do so. It was also said that \u201c[no] Workers\u2019 Party member has any interest in FMSS\u201d, and that \u201cAHTC does not incur additional MA fees from appointing FMSS, as FMSS has agreed to assume the scope of works and pricing of the former MA [for ATC]\u201d.', '56\\u2003On 11 August 2011, AHTC and CPG entered into a deed of mutual release with effect from 1 August 2011, stating that \u201cboth parties are desirous to be released and discharged from the further performance\u201d of the CPG MA contract and that \u201cthey have mutually agreed to release and discharge each other\u201d from further performance of the same. Also on 11 August 2011, AHTC and CPG entered into a project management contract for CPG to provide three staff members for a one-month parallel run of computer services at AHTC, and to provide project management services for three improvement works and repainting projects which were in progress.', '57\\u2003As noted above at [33], Mr Jeffrey Chua notified Ms How Weng Fan on 16 May 2011 that the existing contracts with CPG and EM Services for EMSU services were set to expire on 30 September 2011. The same point was noted in the presentation slides used at the presentation on 2 June 2011 (see above at [38]), and was also made by Mr Jeffrey Chua at the first Town Council meeting on 9 June 2011.', '58\\u2003On 26 August 2011, Ms How Weng Fan sent a letter to Mr Jeffrey Chua as the Managing Director of CPG, concerning the \u201cextension of term contract for [EMSU services] from 1 October 2011 to 31 March 2012\u201d:', 'A similar letter was sent to EM Services.', '59\\u2003On 7 September 2011, EM Services replied, stating that they were declining the request for extension. Thus, the provision of EMSU services by EM Services would terminate on 30 September 2011.', '60\\u2003The third Town Council meeting was held on 8 September 2011. At this meeting, the following discussion pertaining to EMSU contracts with CPG and EM Services was recorded in the minutes:', '61\\u2003On 14 September 2011, Mr Jeffrey Chua sent an email to Ms How Weng Fan on behalf of CPG, apparently to follow up from a telephone conversation the same morning, stating that \u201c[a]s explained, it will not be appropriate for us to continue providing the EMSU services to your Town Council when the current extended contract ends on 30 Sept 2011\u201d.', '62\\u2003Two days later, on 16 September 2011, Ms Sylvia Lim emailed the town councillors to apprise them of the \u201cimportant news re EMSU services\u201d:', '63\\u2003This email was followed by a meeting on 18 September 2011 of the committee mentioned in the minutes of meeting at [60] above (\u201cthe EMSU Committee\u201d), which comprised Mr Chen Show Mao, Mr Muhamad Faisal, Mr Anthony Teo and Ms Sylvia Lim. The EMSU Committee compared the EMSU contracts of the existing providers in the market, CPG, EM Services and Integrated Solutions, and made decisions as to the scope of EMSU services to be awarded. The EMSU Committee also noted that there were \u201cadvantages of awarding the MA contract and the EMSU contract at the same time\u201d, and recommended to award the EMSU contract for the interim period from 1 October 2011 to 30 June 2012 \u201cgiven the urgency\u201d, so that the tenders for the subsequent MA and EMSU contracts could be called at about the same time.', '64\\u2003On 18 September 2011, Ms Sylvia Lim emailed the town councillors, reiterating that CPG has confirmed its unwillingness to extend its EMSU services beyond 30 September 2011. She stated that this \u201ccame as a surprise on 14 Sep and was contrary to the verbal agreement that they were willing to extend for 6 months\u201d. She further stated that as EMSU was a critical service, a waiver of tender for EMSU services was required due to the \u201curgency of the requirement and the public interest necessity\u201d. She concluded by stating that FMSS had offered to supply the EMSU services in accordance with the scope of works approved by the EMSU Committee, and for the period October 2011 to June 2012, following which an open tender would be called. AHTC\u2019s approval was sought to waive the tender for EMSU services and to award the contract to FMSS. Approval was unanimously provided via email circulation.', '65\\u2003At the ninth Town Council meeting on 8 March 2012, it was discussed that FMSS\u2019s provision of MA and EMSU services under the first MA and EMSU contracts would be expiring in July 2012, and that tenders would need to be called soon. The meeting then decided to appoint a committee to consider the MA and EMSU tenders. This committee is the Tender Committee referred to at [15] above.', '66\\u2003At the tenth Town Council meeting on 12 April 2012, it was noted that the Tender Committee had met twice to review and make amendments to the tender documents and specifications used by ATC for MA and EMSU services, which would be used for the calling of tenders the next day. Representatives from FMSS, which included Mr Danny Loh and Ms How Weng Fan, were then excused from the meeting. After they re-joined the meeting, they were informed that AHTC would call for quotations to appoint a firm to audit the process of appointment of the MA.', '67\\u2003A tender notice for the provision of MA and EMSU services, each for a term of three years, was published in the Straits Times on 13 April 2012, with the tender closing on 4 May 2012. On 16 April 2012, tender documents were collected by CBM Pte Ltd and EM Services. FMSS subsequently collected tender documents on 26 April 2012. FMSS submitted the sole bid for the second EMSU contract and second MA contract on 4 May 2012.', '68\\u2003The minutes of the Town Council meeting of 10 May 2012 recorded that the Tender Committee had \u201cappointed M\/s RSM Ethos at $6,000 as the firm to audit the process of the appointment of the Managing Agent\u201d.', '69\\u2003On 19 June 2012, Ms Sylvia Lim sent Ms How Weng Fan and Mr Danny Loh the following email which gave them a heads up as to what the Tender Committee would seek explanation on:', 'Mr Danny Loh replied to this email on the same day with revised calculations on FMSS\u2019s rates. The revised calculations show FMSS\u2019s proposed rates for 2012 to have increased from $5.96 per equivalent dwelling unit (\u201cEDU\u201d) in 2010 to $7.00 per EDU, representing a 17.28% increase in MA fees. Mr Danny Loh also said that he \u201c[a]ppreciate[d] the heads up\u201d.', '70\\u2003On 21 June 2012, the Tender Committee, now comprising Ms Sylvia Lim, Mr Pritam Singh, Mr Muhamad Faisal, Mr David Chua and Mr Anthony Teo, met to evaluate FMSS\u2019s tender for the second MA and EMSU contracts. The committee expressed concern about the marked increase in the MA rates tendered, representing \u201can increase of 17.3% when averaged out over the respective 3-year contract periods\u201d, and asked FMSS for justification. In response, Mr Danny Loh showed presentation slides explaining FMSS\u2019s pricing strategy, and pointing to other costs that FMSS had to bear. Ms How Weng Fan also added that provision of IT maintenance services was done by FMSS in-house at no extra cost, which was a saving of more than $30,000 per month. Concerned about the impact of the proposed prices on AHTC\u2019s bottom line and whether it would necessitate raising service and conservancy charges levied on residents, the Tender Committee asked for a possible 3-year projection. Ms How Weng Fan was recorded as having responded that the budget for FY2012 showed a surplus of over $100,000, and that it was \u201cnot possible to accurate [sic] project for the next 3 years due to the unpredictable external environment, changing manpower polices and rising costs\u201d. The minutes of meeting also reflected that whereas FMSS\u2019s tender for the second MA contract specified project management fees at a rate of 3.5% for the first two years and 4% for the third year, Mr Danny Loh indicated that FMSS was willing to hold the rates at 3.5% for all three years.', '71\\u2003The Tender Committee reconvened one month later on 21 July 2012 to evaluate the MA tender submitted by FMSS, and this time queried why FMSS\u2019s project management rates did not price in any rate reduction for larger projects. Mr Danny Loh responded that since FMSS focused on managing only one town, it did not enjoy the economies of scale in project management enjoyed by other companies.', '72\\u2003On 26 July 2012, Ms Sylvia Lim received an email from Kelly Services in response to a prior request to review the salaries of FMSS staff. The representative from Kelly Services stated that the salaries reviewed were \u201cgenerally acceptable and within range of market norms\u201d.', '73\\u2003At the 13th Town Council meeting held on 2 August 2012, the council considered the tender evaluation reports submitted by the Tender Committee, and adopted its recommendations to award the second MA and EMSU contracts to FMSS at the agreed upon prices. Representatives from FMSS were absent at that meeting. An ACRA search showing the shareholding of Mr Danny Loh, Ms How Weng Fan and other FMSS representatives was part of the documents put before the Tender Committee during the preparation of their tender evaluation report, but this was not put before the Town Council at this meeting.', '74\\u2003The day after the Town Council meeting, a letter of acceptance of FMSS\u2019s tender for the second MA contract, for the contract period from 15 July 2012 to 14 July 2015, was sent by Ms Sylvia Lim to FMSS. On 7 August 2012, FMSS\u2019s tender for the second EMSU contract was accepted similarly for a period of three years.', '75\\u2003The plaintiffs\u2019 claims also include various contracts which they say were improperly awarded to third party contractors. None of these contractors has any connection to Mr Danny Loh, Ms How Weng Fan or FMSS. The circumstances leading up to these appointments, as gleaned from undisputed documentary evidence, will be briefly summarised here.', '76\\u2003On 31 August 2012, AHTC invited tenders for the appointment of architectural consultants to a panel for a period of three years, for the provision of consultancy services at pre-agreed rates based on the value of the awarded project. Tenders were received from LST Architects and Design Metabolists, and it was recorded in the tender evaluation report that for projects between the values of $0.5m and $3.66m, LST Architect\u2019s prices were lower, whereas Design Metabolists\u2019 prices were lower for projects under $0.5m or above $3.66m.', '77\\u2003LST Architects and Design Metabolists were given a performance assessment score of 42 and 41 respectively by AHTC\u2019s Property Officer on 20 September 2012, suggesting that they were broadly even in terms of performance. On 7 November 2012, the Tender Committee decided that both tenderers ought to be appointed to the panel of consultants. LST Architects and Design Metabolists subsequently entered into appointment agreements with AHTC for the contract period 1 December 2012 to 30 November 2015.', '78\\u2003Based on the review by KPMG of ten projects which were subsequently awarded to LST Architects, LST Architects was actually higher-priced than Design Metabolists for seven of those projects.', '79\\u2003In April 2012, AHTC called for a tender for the maintenance of transfer and booster pumps, automatic refuse chute flushing system and roller shutters. At the material time, AHTC had contracts with Digo Corporation Pte Ltd (\u201cDigo\u201d) and Terminal 9 Pte Ltd (\u201cTerminal 9\u201d) for the same services, which could have been extended at AHTC\u2019s option for a maximum of two years at the same rates. On 11 June 2012, Red-Power Electrical Engineering Pte Ltd (\u201cRed-Power\u201d), the sole tenderer, was awarded a term contract for the maintenance of transfer and booster pumps, automatic refuse chute flushing system and roller shutters for AHTC for a period of three years.', '80\\u2003Punggol-East had a separate contract with EM Services for the same services, which contract could not have been further extended after its expiry on 31 March 2015. At the time of the expiry of the said contract, AHTC had in place the contract with Red-Power mentioned in the preceding paragraph, as well as a separate contract with Tong Lee Engineering Works Pte Ltd (\u201cTong Lee\u201d) which covered different precincts of AHTC. It would appear that Tong Lee was not obliged to extend their coverage to include Punggol-East. On 12 December 2014, a letter was sent to Red-Power to confirm that Punggol-East would be added to AHTC\u2019s existing term contract with Red-Power at the same rates, terms and conditions, with effect from 1 April 2015.', '81\\u2003On 12 July 2013, AHTC called a tender for pest control services. Tenders were received from Rentokil Initial Singapore Pte Ltd (\u201cRentokil\u201d) and Pest-Pro Management Pte Ltd (\u201cPest-Pro\u201d), with Pest-Pro\u2019s bid being the lowest. On 17 August 2013, interviews were conducted with both Rentokil and Pest-Pro by the Tender Committee. On 26 August 2013, Rentokil was awarded a term contract for the inspection, extermination and eradication of pests for AHTC for a period of three years.', '82\\u2003Punggol-East had a contract for pest control services with Clean Solutions Pte Ltd (\u201cClean Solutions\u201d) which expired on 31 March 2015.

Both contracts expired on 31 March 2015, and contained an option to extend for a further 12 months on the same terms and rates. This option was not exercised. Instead, AHTC called for fresh tenders.', '84\\u2003Three bids were received for the provision of conservancy and cleaning works, and a new contract for these works was awarded to the lowest bidder, Titan, for the period 1 April 2015 to 31 March 2018. Similarly, three bids were received for the maintenance of fire protection systems, and a new contract was awarded to the lowest bidder, J Keart, for a period of three years. In other words, new contracts for the same services were awarded to the existing contractors when the existing contracts could have been extended. It is not disputed that the new contracts with Titan and J Keart were at a higher rate than the existing contracts with the same contractors.'"}

{"casename":"2019_SGHC_243","fact":"facts supported Ding Auto\u2019s assertion \nthat Jason was drawing from its bank account far more funds than could be \njustified for its legitimate operating or business expenses.    \n173 In this connection, it should also be highlighted that an examination of \nJason\u2019s lists of employees versus Ding Auto\u2019s CPF records from April 2014 \nonwards revealed discrepancies between the Ding Auto employees listed by \nJason \u2013 and their salaries \u2013 and those registered in the company\u2019s CPF records.  \nTaking the month of June 2015 as an example, a lump sum of $28,124.08 was \nwithdrawn from Ding Auto\u2019s bank account via cash cheque on 6 July 2015, \npurportedly to reimburse Mega Auto for payment of Ding Auto staff salaries in \nJune 2015.390  Neither the payment voucher nor Andy\u2019s email in respect of this \n\u201creimbursement\u201d gave any details of the Ding Auto employees whose salaries \nhad alleged been paid by Mega Auto.  The list produced by Jason in 2018 to \nsupport this payment purported to show a total of 10 Ding Auto employees391 \nand a total amount of $28,124.08 paid for their salaries in June 2015.  However, \nDing Auto\u2019s CPF statement for June 2015392 showed only six employees \nregistered for that month, with a total ordinary wage amount of $10,230.54.  No \n389 See exhibit P2.\n390 Pp 1254-1255, Vol 3 Jason\u2019s AEIC.\n391 P 1256, Vol 3 Jason\u2019s AEIC.\n392 1 DBD 114.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nDing Auto Pte Ltd v Yip Kin Lung[2019] SGHC 243\n98explanation was offered by the defendants as to why Mega Auto was claiming \nto have paid salaries to individuals not registered as Ding Auto\u2019s employees in \nthe latter\u2019s CPF records.  I also noted that Mega Auto disclosed its own CPF \nrecords only for the period June 2013 to April 2014;393 and furthermore, that \neven the CPF records it disclosed for this period were all redacted, in that other \nthan the individuals it claimed were \u201cseconded\u201d to Ding Auto during the said \nperiod, the names of all its other employees were blanked out.  This forestalled \nany comparison being drawn between Jason\u2019s unsigned lists of employees (and \ntheir alleged salaries) and Mega Auto\u2019s record of registered employees (and \ntheir salaries).  This lack of transparency on Mega Auto\u2019s part was telling, given \nthat Mega Auto \u2013 and Jason \u2013 would have known early on in these proceedings \nabout Ding Auto\u2019s allegation that they were siphoning monies from its bank \naccount for their own purposes.\n174 In respect of Kenny Ding Sing Yew ((\u201cKenny\u201d), Ding\u2019s son), who was \nemployed at Ding Auto from May 2014 to August 2016, it should also be noted \nthat both Kenny and Ding asserted that he received only the CPF contribution \npayable on his notional salary during his period of employment.394  Jason and \nAndy disputed this, claiming that Ding had requested that Kenny\u2019s salary be \nhanded over directly to him (Ding).  On the whole, I found Jason\u2019s and Andy\u2019s \nstory to be rather unbelievable.  There appeared to be no sensible reason why \nDing should have made such a request in relation to a grown-up son in his late \ntwenties.  In any event, Kenny himself provided an explanation as to why he \nhad received only the CPF portion of his salary during the period of \nemployment.  Kenny explained that he had worked only on a part-time basis at \n393 1 DBD 77-97.\n394 See para 2 of Kenny\u2019s AEIC.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nDing Auto Pte Ltd v Yip Kin Lung[2019] SGHC 243\n99Ding Auto; that he was mainly engaged in the \u201csales line\u201d, referring clients to \nthe company; and that he had agreed with his father he would receive only CPF \ncontributions and no other portions of his salary from Ding Auto.  According to \nKenny, he was agreeable to this arrangement because he was aware that his \nfather had just started the business,395 and he was deriving an income from \nelsewhere anyway, which was why he only worked part-time for Ding Auto.396  \nI found Kenny\u2019s explanation to be cogent and Kenny himself to be an honest \nwitness who did not try to embellish his evidence to help Ding\u2019s and Ding \nAuto\u2019s case.  I accepted Kenny\u2019s and Ding\u2019s assertion, therefore, that Kenny \nwas not paid any portions of his salary other than CPF contributions.   \n175 Rather damningly, when asked in cross-examination for evidence that \nthe employees named in his lists had actually received the precise salary \namounts recorded against their names, Jason admitted that he had no such \nevidence.397\n176 I make one final observation in respect of both the payments which were \nallegedly reimbursements to Mega Auto of the salary payments to employees \n\u201cseconded\u201d to Ding Auto from July 2013 to April 2014, as well as the payments \nwhich were allegedly reimbursements of salary payments to Ding Auto \nemployees from April 2014 to June 2016.  I have already stated earlier my \nfinding that the unsigned lists of employees, which were created only in 2018, \nwere of little if any evidential value.  As for the remittance advice, payment \nvouchers and Andy\u2019s emails, even assuming these were documents produced \n395 Paras 2 and 7 of Kenny\u2019s AEIC.\n396 Para 8 of Kenny\u2019s AEIC.\n397 See transcript of 4 January 2019 at p 60 line 19 to p 61 line 21.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nDing Auto Pte Ltd v Yip Kin Lung[2019] SGHC 243\n100contemporaneously with the disputed payments, they were very sketchy records \nwhich provided no details at all of the alleged purpose(s) of the payments.  As \nI have pointed out, none of these documents contained any details of the relevant \nemployees and salary amounts.  The fact that these documents were so shorn of \nspecifics even when the payments were for sizeable amounts (for example, \n$76,152.24 for July to Aug 2013, $91,598.71 for Oct to Dec 2013, $28,124.08 \nfor June 2015) lent credence to Ding Auto\u2019s contention that records were left \ndeliberately vague so as to allow Jason leeway to make substantial payments \nfrom its account to Mega Auto \u2013 without providing any real particulars, and \nwithout leaving an obvious paper trail.\n177 It will be recalled that Jason had conceded during the trial that it was \n\u201cfully up to [him]\u201d how and when reimbursements were made to Mega Auto \nfrom Ding Auto\u2019s account for the staff salaries allegedly paid by the former.398  \nJason also conceded that he was responsible for authorising and giving approval \nfor all the cheques and cash cheques signed by Andy.399  \n178As Ding Auto\u2019s agent in the management of its finances and particularly \nin the disposition of its funds, Jason owed Ding Auto fiduciary duties.  These \nduties were to act in good faith; not to make a profit out of his trust; not to place \nhimself in a position where his duty and his interest might conflict; and not to \nact for his own benefit or the benefit of a third party (Mega Auto) without the \ninformed consent of his principal (Ding Auto).  To sum up in respect of the \ncategory of disputed payments dubbed \u201clabour charges\u201d by Ding Auto\u2019s \ncounsel: having regard to the matters set out in [149] to [177], I was satisfied \n398 Para 47 of Jason\u2019s AEIC.\n399 See transcript of 4 January 2019 at p 7 lines 12 to 29.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nDing Auto Pte Ltd v Yip Kin Lung[2019] SGHC 243\n101that Jason had \u2013 in signing off on and\/or authorizing these payments \u2013 breached \nhis fiduciary duties as Ding Auto\u2019s agent; and that he was well aware of what \nhe was doing.     \nCategory of disputed payments: Petty cash vouchers presented by Wong for \nreimbursement\n179 The next category of disputed payments related to petty cash vouchers.  \nIn the course of the trial, counsel clarified on behalf of Ding Auto that it was \nprepared to accept payments in reimbursement of petty cash claims where there \nwas evidence of the petty cash vouchers having been signed off by Ding.400  The \npetty cash claims in dispute concerned those presented by Wong for \nreimbursement from Ding Auto.  These petty cash vouchers related to claim \nitem numbers 3, 4, 6, 7 and 10 in the table at [30] of the statement of claim401 \nas well as claim item number 23.402  In support of each of these alleged petty \ncash reimbursements, Jason would typically exhibit in his AEIC a Ding Auto \npetty cash payment voucher, another document on Ding Auto letterhead said to \nbe a \u201cpetty cash record form\u201d, and multiple receipts and invoices from different \nsources.  \n180 As with the alleged salary payments by Mega Auto, so too with these \npetty cash claims, there was again no explanation provided in Jason\u2019s AEIC \u2013 \nnor in Andy\u2019s and Wong\u2019s AEIC \u2013 about the items making up the amounts \nclaimed in reimbursement.  Thus for example, in respect of claim item number \n3 where Andy had issued a cash cheque on 26 August 2013 for an amount of \n400 See transcript of 3 January 2019 at p 105 lines 4 to 7.\n401 Pp 208-214 of the statement of claim (Amendment No. 2), Tab 16 BOP.\n402 See transcript of 3 January 2019 at p 110 lines 5 to 7 and at p 131 lines 18 to 23.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nDing Auto Pte Ltd v Yip Kin Lung[2019] SGHC 243\n102$1,200.33, whilst the payment voucher exhibited in Jason\u2019s AEIC403 appeared \nto show that this sum was a \u201cpetty cash\u201d reimbursement made to Wong on 10 \nAugust 2013, no breakdown and no details were given of how this lump sum \nwas arrived at.  It was left to opposing counsel and the court to wade through \nthe bundle of receipts and other attached documents to attempt to make sense \nof them.  \n181 For claim item number 3, apart from what appeared to be ad hoc \npurchases of small items such as cushion seats and an antenna,404 there were \ntwo petty cash claims by Wong for an item of $300 for \u201cpetrol\u201d and an item of \n$70 for \u201ccash card\u201d.405  No explanations were volunteered in Jason\u2019s, Andy\u2019s \nand Wong\u2019s AEICs as to what these petty cash payments to Wong were for.  \nWhen asked in cross-examination about these two items, Jason said that they \nwere claimed by Wong because as a Mega Auto employee, he was entitled to \n\u201cemployee\u2019s perks\u201d which included a monthly payment of \u201c$300 of petrol\u201d for \nhis personal vehicle and another monthly payment of \u201ccash card of $70\u201d.406  \n182 That Wong was claiming from Ding Auto the \u201cemployee\u2019s perks\u201d given \nto him as part of his terms of employment with Mega Auto was plainly \nanomalous.

The victim did not confront the appellant at the time. Subsequently, the appellant\u2019s taxi stopped beside the victim\u2019s taxi at a traffic light junction. The victim wound down his front passenger window and started shouting at the appellant, berating him for the manner in which he had earlier driven. The victim used some Hokkien vulgarities in the course of this confrontation. The appellant alighted from his taxi, taking a can of insecticide with him. He stretched his hand into the victim\u2019s taxi, pointed the can of insecticide at the victim and sprayed the victim with insecticide twice.

She submitted that the operation \nof the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA first required  the Prosecution to \nprove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused  had possession of the controlled \ndrug. This required proof of the accused\u2019s  physical control over the controlled  \ndrug and knowledge of the existence  of thing in question, ie, the controlled  drug \nitself: Sim Teck Ho v PP [2000] SGCA 44 at [13].  The fact that the accused was \nunconscious at the time the controlled drug was found on him did not preclude \na finding  that he had possession of it, as long as it was proven that he had \npossessed the controlled  drug when he was conscious and that such possession \ncontinued throughout the time he was unconscious.  \n3 GD at para  41.\n4 GD at para  43. \n5 GD at para  46.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nD Rashpal Singh Sidhu v PP [2019]  SGHC  25\n35 In such circumstances, the Prosecution could discharge its burden of \nproof by reference to the circumstances in which  the accused was found with \nthe controlled drug, or by reference  to events that occurred before he lost \nconsciousness. Ms Tay relied on various Malaysian,  Hong  Kong, English and \nCanadian authorities  that dealt with analogous  offence provisions to establish \nthe following  propositions:\n(a) Possession involves an element of mental  consciousness: see \nWarner v Metropolitan Police  Commissioner [1969] 1969]  2 AC 256 at \n299 and MacKenzie v Skeen [1983]  SLT 121.\n(b) Where a person comes into possession of a thing, such \npossession is not lost when the possessor loses consciousness or falls \nasleep: Public Prosecutor v Tang Chew Weng  [1969] 2 MLJ  17.\n(c) Foreign courts  have decided the question of whether the accused  \nhad the requisite knowledge  of the existence  of the thing in question by \nreference to the circumstances in which the accused was discovered  or \nby reference to facts that arose  prior to such discovery or arrest. For \ninstance, in Public Prosecutor v Ho Shui Ngen [1995] 4 MLJ 758, the \nMalaysian High Court acquitted the accused of a drug trafficking charge  \nnotwithstanding the fact that he had been  discovered asleep  in a room  \nthat contained cannabis.  The High Court noted  in particular that the door \nto the room where the cannabis was found had not been closed, let alone \nlocked. If the accused  had been asleep for a long time, someone else \ncould have placed the cannabis  in the  room.\n(d) The mens rea of possession  does not require the requisite  \nknowledge of the existence of the controlled drug to be at the forefront \nof the accused  person\u2019s mind. An analogy was drawn to cases where \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nD Rashpal Singh Sidhu v PP [2019]  SGHC  25\n4offenders were found to be in possession of prohibited items despite \nhaving forgotten  at the time that they were in possession of those  items: \nR v Martindale [1986] 1 WLR 1042.\n6 In the second  part of her submissions,  Ms Tay argued  that it was only \nafter possession had been proven  (or presumed under  s 18(1) of the MDA)  that \nthe presumption  under s 18(2) of the MDA came into operation. Under  s 18(2)  \nof the MDA,  the possessor of a controlled drug is presumed to have known the \nnature of that drug. There was no reason why this presumption should not \noperate where an accused person is unconscious when he is found to be in \npossession of a drug.  The danger that the drug was planted on him would have \nbeen dealt with at the first stage  of the inquiry, when the Prosecution  had to \nprove that he had the mens  rea of possession despite his unconsciousness at the \ntime the drug was discovered on him. Where this threshold had been met, the \naccused\u2019s unconsciousness alone  could not also be used to rebut the \npresumption under s 18(2) of the MDA.\n7 Instead, such an accused  person must rebut the presumption  under \ns 18(2)  of the MDA on the balance of probabilities  by relying  on observable \nfacts preceding his state of unconsciousness,  or by relying on the circumstances \nin which he was found  with the controlled  drug. For instance,  in Chee  Chiew \nHeong v Public Prosecutor [1981]  2 MLJ 287, the accused (\u201cChee\u201d)  was found \nasleep on a train in possession of a parcel that was found to contain 1146.33g of \nheroin and 81.03g of morphine. The presumption  under s 37( d) of the Malaysian \nDangerous Drugs  Ordinance  1952 operated  such that Chee was deemed to be in \npossession of and to know of the existence  of the drugs.  Chee successfully \nrebutted the presumption by relying  on a cautioned statement that constituted \nevidence of what happened before she was found asleep on the train,  to convince \nthe court  that she genuinely  believed that she was in possession of a package of \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nD Rashpal Singh Sidhu v PP [2019]  SGHC  25\n5dried prawns which her friend  had passed to her. Ms Tay noted that it was \nbecause Chee did not dispute possession of the parcel in the first place  that she \ncould run arguments to rebut  the presumption. It would, however, be difficult  \nfor an accused person  to adduce evidence to rebut the presumption in s 18(2)  of \nthe MDA if he were to also dispute possession by running the defence that he \nwas not aware of the presence of the drug on him: Public Prosecutor v Sibeko \nLindiwe Mary-Jane [2016]  SGHC  199 at [76].  \n8 For completeness,  Ms Tay set out general principles to guide the court\u2019s \nassessment of when  the presumption under  s 18(2) of the MDA may be found \nto be rebutted. She highlighted  that this was a fact-sensitive analysis that turned \non the veracity  and credibility  of the accused\u2019s evidence: Zainal bin Hamad v \nPublic Prosecutor [2018] 2 SLR 1119 at [23]. \n9 At"}

On 19 January 2015, the Complainant was brought and admitted to NUH by the Husband after she took an overdose of Tramadol. On the next day, 20 January 2015, she was reviewed by Dr Soo, who diagnosed her with adjustment disorder with depressed mood and alcohol misuse, and noted that she bore a risk of self-harm and presented with a history of depression. She was discharged later that day with a memorandum referring her to a family service centre. That memorandum also stated that the Husband had been informed of her proposed treatment plan and was supportive of it. The Complainant\u2019s medication was handed over to the Husband and her family members for safekeeping. The Complainant subsequently defaulted on her follow-up appointment at NUH.', '8\\u2003Two months later, on the morning of 20 March 2015, Dr Soo was in the midst of a clinic with a roster of 17 patients scheduled to see him when he received a telephone call from a caller who informed him that the Complainant was suicidal and needed to be brought to the Institute of Mental Health (\u201cIMH\u201d) for an urgent assessment of her suicide risk (\u201cthe Call\u201d).', '9\\u2003Dr Soo evidently accessed the Complainant\u2019s electronic records, and at or around 10.28am, he made a contemporaneous record there (\u201cthe Call Note\u201d). The Call Note recorded the following:', '10\\u2003It is evident from the italicised portions of the Call Note that Dr Soo was under the impression that the caller was the Husband. It also seems clear to us that whoever it was who called Dr Soo was in possession of a number of key pieces of information about the Complainant, including the following:', '(a)\\u2003the fact that Dr Soo was the consultant who had previously attended to the Complainant when she was admitted to NUH in January 2015;', '(b)\\u2003the Complainant\u2019s personal information and identification details, without which, we were subsequently informed, Dr Soo would not have been able to access her electronic records; and', '(c)\\u2003the Complainant\u2019s medical state, which, as it happened, was consistent with her history of depression and the risk of self-harm and suicidal ideation.', 'It is also evident from the Call Note that Dr Soo was given the impression that the situation was urgent, in that the police and an ambulance had been summoned to take the Complainant to IMH but to no avail because of her refusal to accede to their requests.', '11\\u2003Dr Soo wrote the Memorandum almost immediately at or around 10.32am. The Memorandum contained the Complainant\u2019s name, NRIC, age and gender, and it stated as follows:', '12\\u2003It is evident from the italicised portions of the Memorandum that Dr Soo had contemporaneously checked the record of the Complainant\u2019s previous visit to NUH and taken note of the fact that the Complainant had not followed up on her past treatment. The Memorandum also reinforces the point we made earlier (at [10] above) that Dr Soo was under the impression that the person who made the Call was the Husband. We are also satisfied that Dr Soo was cognisant of the Complainant\u2019s past risk of suicide and self-endangerment, as reflected in his reference to her \u201crecent\u201d threats of suicide. The Memorandum further evidences Dr Soo\u2019s opinion that the Complainant should undergo a suicide risk assessment at IMH.', '13\\u2003Dr Soo left the Memorandum with his clinic staff, with instructions that it should be handed to the Husband. However, unknown to Dr Soo, it was the Brother who collected the Memorandum from the clinic staff later that day.', '14\\u2003Three days later, on 23 March 2015, the Complainant discovered that Dr Soo had issued the Memorandum, and that it was in the Brother\u2019s possession. The Brother had earlier applied to the Family Court on behalf of the Complainant\u2019s son for a Personal Protection Order (\u201cPPO\u201d) against the Complainant, and the Brother and the Complainant were still in the midst of those proceedings. During the exchange of documents on 23 March 2015 in connection with those proceedings, the Complainant saw the Memorandum among the documents that the Brother submitted to the Family Court.', '15\\u2003According to the Complainant, she called NUH on 30 March 2015 to inquire about the Memorandum and asked to speak to Dr Soo. He, however, was on leave. Dr Soo called the Complainant back on 13 April 2015, and this eventuated in his writing a letter addressed to her dated 14 April 2015 as follows:', '16\\u2003The Complainant then lodged a complaint against Dr Soo with the SMC by way of a statutory declaration dated 11 August 2015 (\u201cthe Complaint\u201d). This was done pursuant to s 39(1) of the MRA. In her account, the Complainant asserted that the Brother had deceived Dr Soo into writing the Memorandum, and that he had done so with a view to using the Memorandum to support his case in the Family Court proceedings. The Complainant averred that the Brother had called Dr Soo on 20 March 2015 claiming to be the Husband and claiming that she (the Complainant) was suicidal and needed to go for an assessment at IMH. The Complainant\u2019s grievance with Dr Soo was that he had accepted the caller\u2019s account without arranging an appointment with her or otherwise communicating with her to verify the details.', '17\\u2003A Complaints Committee was appointed to inquire into the Complaint. On its direction, an investigation was conducted by the Investigation Unit of the SMC. The Investigation Unit wrote a letter dated 4 February 2016 to Dr Soo enclosing the Complaint, and invited him to furnish the Complaints Committee with a written response or explanation pursuant to ss 44(1) and 44(2) of the MRA. The letter informed Dr Soo that his written explanation \u201cmay be used as evidence in the course of the proceedings\u201d, and that he should address the allegations set out in the Complaint. He was also asked to answer the following questions:', '18\\u2003Dr Soo provided a brief written explanation by way of a letter dated 19 February 2016 as follows:', '19\\u2003The Complaints Committee did not subsequently take any statements from the Brother or the Husband, essentially because Dr Soo admitted that he had not verified the caller\u2019s identity in detail. Dr Soo himself appeared to have assumed that the Complainant was correct in her assertion that the Brother had falsely claimed to be the Husband.', '20\\u2003On 3 April 2017, the Complaints Committee wrote to Dr Soo informing him that it had ordered a disciplinary tribunal to hold a formal inquiry into the Complaint. The Notice of Inquiry was later served on Dr Soo by the SMC\u2019s solicitors. It set out the Charge (see [5] above) along with its particulars, and also enclosed the expert report of A\/Prof Dr Daniel Fung Shuen Sheng (\u201cDr Fung\u201d) dated 24 May 2018 (referred to hereafter as \u201cDr Fung\u2019s report\u201d where appropriate to the context). In summary, the particulars in the Notice of Inquiry included the following:', '(a)\\u2003On 20 March 2015, Dr Soo received a telephone call from the Brother, who claimed to be the Husband.', '(b)\\u2003Dr Soo did not verify the caller\u2019s identity by checking the Complainant\u2019s medical records for the Husband\u2019s name and contact number, or by contacting the Complainant directly.', '(c)\\u2003Dr Soo failed to take steps to ensure that the means by which the Memorandum was communicated was secure, and that it would not be accessible to unauthorised persons.', '(d)\\u2003A reasonable and competent doctor in Dr Soo\u2019s position would have: (i) obtained the caller\u2019s name and NRIC; (ii) checked the Complainant\u2019s medical records to ascertain whether information about the caller was available there and, if so, verified the caller\u2019s identity based on that information, or, if such information was not available, called the Complainant directly to verify the caller\u2019s identity before preparing the Memorandum; and (iii) given instructions only then to the clinic staff to release the Memorandum to the verified caller.', '21\\u2003The Charge and the Notice of Inquiry did not seem to take issue with the fact that Dr Soo would be releasing the Complainant\u2019s confidential medical information to someone other than the Complainant. Rather, the focus was on: (a) what steps Dr Soo should have taken, but did not in fact take, to verify the identity of the caller; and (b) what steps Dr Soo should have taken, but evidently did not take, to ensure that the information would be released only to the caller. The SMC also asked Dr Fung, who is the Chairman of the Medical Board and a Senior Consultant at IMH\u2019s Department of Developmental Psychiatry, to provide an expert opinion in relation to the Complaint. In summary, after reviewing the Complaint, Dr Soo\u2019s written explanation of 19 February 2016 and the Complainant\u2019s medical records from NUH, Dr Fung opined that:', '(a)\\u2003The Memorandum contained confidential medical information pertaining to the Complainant because it contained personal identifiers, such as her name, NRIC, age and gender, and also mentioned her symptoms (suicidal threats) and associated clinical condition (which required follow up at NUH\u2019s psychological medicine clinic).', '(b)\\u2003Dr Soo was concerned that the Complainant was suicidal and mentally disordered, and believed that she might have been dangerous to herself. He wrote the Memorandum in order to enable the police to act on this concern, and he was justified in the circumstances in disclosing the Complainant\u2019s confidential medical information without her permission. Dr Soo\u2019s response to the Call was appropriate in terms of trying to get expeditious help for the Complainant.', '(c)\\u2003However, Dr Soo, by his own admission, did not verify the identity of the person he was releasing the Complainant\u2019s confidential medical information to. Dr Soo did not take sufficient care to ensure that the Memorandum was not accessed by unauthorised persons as he did not verify the identity of the person who made the Call and did not ensure, through his clinic staff, that the Memorandum was released only to the verified caller. Medical confidentiality had thereby been breached.', '22\\u2003On 30 November 2018, the DT heard the parties. Dr Soo pleaded guilty to the Charge with its particulars as set out in the Notice of Inquiry, and admitted without reservation to the Agreed Statement of Facts. The Agreed Statement of Facts elaborated on the particulars in the Notice of Inquiry and stated, among other things, that:', '(a)\\u2003Dr Soo did not verify the identity of the person who made the Call by first obtaining his name, NRIC or contact number and thereafter checking the Complainant\u2019s medical records for the Husband\u2019s name, NRIC and contact number, or by contacting the Complainant directly before issuing the Memorandum.', '(b)\\u2003Dr Soo left the Memorandum with his clinic staff, with instructions that it should be handed to the Husband, who had called earlier that day.', '(c)\\u2003Thereafter, Dr Soo did not take steps to ensure that the means by which the Memorandum was communicated was secure, or that it was accessible only to authorised persons, by giving instructions to his clinic staff to release it only upon verification of the identity of the person collecting it.', '23\\u2003In the circumstances, the DT found Dr Soo guilty of professional misconduct under s 53(1)(d) of the MRA. Because Dr Soo had chosen not to contest the Charge or the facts upon which it was based, there was no hearing on or inquiry into the facts grounding the Charge. The DT proceeded to consider the appropriate sanction to impose on Dr Soo. In so doing, it had sight of Dr Fung\u2019s report and heard submissions by counsel. As we have already noted, the SMC sought a fine of not less than $20,000, while Dr Soo sought a fine not exceeding $5,000.', '24\\u2003In his submissions before the DT, Dr Soo submitted that the Brother had deceived him and had been able to do so because the Brother was already in possession of information pertaining to the Complainant\u2019s medical history (GD at [14]). In his written plea in mitigation, Dr Soo also stated that his mistake was in not verifying the identity of the recipient of the Memorandum personally, even though he had asked his clinic staff to hand it specifically to the Husband.', '25\\u2003At the end of the hearing, the DT ordered that Dr Soo: (a) pay a fine of $50,000; (b) be censured; (c) give a written undertaking to the SMC that he would not engage in the conduct complained of or in any similar conduct; and (d) pay the costs and expenses of and incidental to the proceedings, including the costs of the SMC\u2019s solicitors (GD at [32]). In coming to its decision, the DT considered that in the circumstances of the case, there was clearly harm caused to the Complainant in the form of \u201cpsychological and emotional distress\u201d (GD at [24]), including through the misuse of the Memorandum (GD at [25]).', '26\\u2003The DT subsequently issued its GD on 17 December 2018. The SMC served notice of the DT\u2019s order on Dr Soo on 19 December 2018. Pursuant to s 55(1) of the MRA, the last day for either party to appeal to the High Court against the DT\u2019s order was 18 January 2019. By that date, neither party had appealed against the DT\u2019s decision. The GD was subsequently published on 5 March 2019.', '27\\u2003Following the publication of the GD, the SMC filed Originating Summonses Nos 5 and 6 of 2019 (\u201cOS 5\u201d and \u201cOS 6\u201d respectively) on 13 March 2019. OS 6 was an application for an extension of time to file and serve an appeal against the DT\u2019s decision, and OS 5 was the substantive application for a review of the DT\u2019s decision on the ground that the penalty of $50,000 imposed on Dr Soo was manifestly excessive and\/or seriously or unduly disproportionate. The supporting affidavit for OS 6 stated that since the publication of the GD, members of the medical profession and the public had expressed concern that the DT\u2019s decision could lead to defensive practices among the medical profession and, in particular, give rise to reluctance in the profession to assist caregivers who might approach doctors with bona fide requests. The SMC also noted that the penalty of $50,000 significantly exceeded that which it had sought before the DT. It is not at all clear to us why the SMC recognised and raised this concern only after the outcry over the DT\u2019s decision.', '28\\u2003Matters then took a different turn. As we have noted above (at [3]), on 16 March 2019, the Brother published a post on Facebook essentially stating that he had learnt of the case two days earlier, and claiming that he had never impersonated the Husband and that Dr Soo in fact \u201cdid the necessary\u201d when communicating with \u201c[the Complainant\u2019s] husband\u201d [emphasis added] over the telephone. Following the publication of this post, the SMC contacted the Brother and the Husband to obtain their respective accounts of the material events. Their respective accounts had evidently not been previously known to either the parties or the DT.', '29\\u2003In the meantime, on 3 April 2019, we granted a consent order in terms of the SMC\u2019s application in OS 6.', '30\\u2003On 22 May 2019, the SMC amended OS 5 pursuant to O 55 r 5 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe Rules of Court\u201d) to seek the setting aside of Dr Soo\u2019s conviction and sentence. The SMC also filed Summons No 3 of 2019 (\u201cSUM 3\u201d) for leave to adduce further evidence, specifically, the statutory declarations made by the Brother and the Husband, both dated 6 May 2019, which set out their respective accounts of the circumstances under which the Memorandum had been prepared by Dr Soo and collected by the Brother. Dr Soo consented to the application in SUM 3.', '31\\u2003The SMC contended that in view of the fact that the Brother\u2019s and the Husband\u2019s statutory declarations presented an alternative account of the circumstances under which the Memorandum had been prepared and collected, the factual basis on which Dr Soo had pleaded guilty to the Charge could not be said to have been established beyond a reasonable doubt. The SMC further considered that Dr Soo\u2019s conviction, which had been premised on his admission to the Agreed Statement of Facts, was in the circumstances unsafe, and that any amended charge could not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The SMC was also of the view that in any event, there had been no professional misconduct under s 53(1)(d) of the MRA on Dr Soo\u2019s part.', '32\\u2003Dr Soo did not disagree with the SMC\u2019s position.', '33\\u2003The material aspects of the Brother\u2019s account in his statutory declaration were as follows:', '(a)\\u2003On 20 March 2015 at around 2.00pm, the Brother called Dr Soo, introducing himself as the Complainant\u2019s younger brother and saying that he was calling on the Husband\u2019s behalf. Dr Soo then asked the Brother for his identification number, as well as for the Complainant\u2019s name, identification number and address and the circumstances under which she had been admitted to NUH in January 2015. Dr Soo verified that the Brother could answer his questions before starting the conversation concerning the Complainant\u2019s medical condition.', '(b)\\u2003The Brother asked Dr Soo if he could collect the Memorandum and Dr Soo said that he could since he was a member of the Complainant\u2019s \u201cimmediate family\u201d. The Brother subsequently collected the Memorandum from the receptionist at Dr Soo\u2019s clinic after writing his name and signing off in a logbook. The receptionist had verified what he wrote in the logbook against his identification card.', '34\\u2003The material aspects of the Husband\u2019s account in his statutory declaration were as follows:', '(a)\\u2003One afternoon, the Brother called Dr Soo and introduced himself as the Brother calling on behalf of his brother-in-law (the Husband) regarding his sister (the Complainant).', '(b)\\u2003The Brother asked Dr Soo whether he (the Brother) could collect the Memorandum if the Husband could not, and Dr Soo said that he could. The Brother subsequently collected the Memorandum.', '35\\u2003In both the Brother\u2019s and the Husband\u2019s statutory declarations, they also revealed that the police had interviewed them, and according to the Brother, this was because NUH had made a police report against him. The status of these police investigations is not before us and, in any case, is not known to us.', '36\\u2003In respect of the further evidence, Dr Soo submitted that the Brother\u2019s and the Husband\u2019s statutory declarations contained information that he had been unable to provide during the inquiry by the DT because of the passage of time and the absence of contemporaneous documentation.'"}

The trio became close friends. Around August 2017, they discussed possible ways to make money. They decided to steal money from sex workers, targeting in particular foreign sex workers, as they believed that they would be less likely to report their offences to the police.', '7\\u2003The trio\u2019s plan entailed the following steps. Obtaining the sex workers\u2019 contact details from online sites, they would offer up to $900 for them to provide sexual services at either the accused\u2019s or Yong\u2019s residence. They would employ one of the following two methods in order to steal or rob the victim:', '(a)\\u2003The first method was to steal from the victim\u2019s bag while she was in the toilet or shower.', '(b)\\u2003The second method was to stage an argument in front of the victim.

THK, as mentioned above, was originally known as the Teochew (Eight Districts) Public Property Preservation Association.', '9\\u2003The land comprising of 97 Tank Road, on which the Teochew Building sits, consists of the following parcels: 17', '(a)\\u2003The 1953 Properties: Under an Order of Court dated 30 March 1953 in Originating Summons No 70 of 1953, NAK was appointed trustee of all the immovable properties (ie, under the Order) to be held upon trust for Tuan Mong School (\u201cTMS\u201d), replacing Teo Eng Hock, Lien Ying Chow, Tan Chin Hean, Ng Khng Seng (\u201cMr Khng\u201d), Lim Kim Seng (\u201cMr Lim\u201d), Mr Lee, and Mr Yeo as the former trustees of the said property. 18', '(b)\\u2003The 1955 Properties: Legal ownership of the 1955 Properties was transferred to NAK under an indenture dated 9 February 1955, \u201cfor the construction of schools and the absolute use and benefit of [NAK] in accordance with the objects, rules and regulations of [NAK]\u201d from the trustees, namely, Mr Lee, Mr Yeo, Mr Khng, Mr Lim, and Tan Chin Hean. The 1955 Indenture states that the trustees (referring to the five natural persons) had purchased the 1955 Property as trustees for the \u201cassociation known as [THK]\u201d. 19', '(c)\\u2003The 1959 Property: This property was purchased from the Government of Singapore under the State Grant dated 22 July 1959, to be held upon trust for TMS.', '10\\u2003The Teochew Building which forms the subject matter of the present dispute is a four-story building located at 97 Tank Road. It has to date been used for a variety of purposes, 20', 'in particular, the housing of TMS (which now ceases to exist), and as the site of THK\u2019s office premises. It is worth noting that THK\u2019s office premises have been located in the Teochew Building from the time the building was first constructed in 1963.', '11\\u2003TMS, like NAK and THK, dates back many years. It was first established in 1906 when Mr Yeo and Liau Chia Heng (\u201cMr Liau\u201d), together with 24 other Teochews, donated a sum of $30,000 for that purpose. 21', 'Both Mr Yeo and Mr Liau were also the founders of THK. 22', 'According to Mr Woo, there was a meeting held by THK, prior to the transfers of the 1953, 1955 and 1959 Properties, during which the THK directors decided to \u201cconvert all the lots in 97 Tank Road into a [four-storey] school building\u201d. 23', 'After its completion, the Teochew Building hosted the TMS on its upper three floors. 24', 'THK occupied about an area on the first floor.', '12\\u2003Three reasons were given by THK for the transfer. First, it was to \u201censure the continuity of [TMS]\u201d (as NAK had, in its view, been incorporated specifically to manage Teochew properties in Singapore). 25', 'Second, it was to facilitate amalgamation of the various parcels of land into a single plot of land on which the Teochew Building would sit. 26', 'Third, it was to eliminate the need for the replacement of trustees from time to time, as would be necessary in the case of natural persons. The original trustees of the 1953 and 1955 Properties were natural persons, and a transfer to NAK, as a body corporate with perpetual succession, would facilitate this. 27', 'If there were other reasons for the transfer, aside from the foregoing, they have not as yet surfaced.', '13\\u2003The true reasons why NAK came to hold the three Properties for NAK assume especial significance because THK takes the position that it was the initial purchaser and financier of the 1953 and 1955 Properties. 28', 'THK maintains that it never intended to make a gift either of the 1953 or 1955 Properties to NAK. 29', '14\\u2003By 1994, student enrolment in TMS had decreased. 30', 'The school had to be moved from its 97 Tank Road site and was renamed \u201cNgee Ann Secondary School\u201d. The cessation of TMS would later become the reason for a cy-pres application by NAK. From 1994 to 2017, the Teochew Building at 97 Tank Road was used for a variety of different purposes, but as mentioned earlier, THK continued to occupy a part of it.', '15\\u2003Sometime in mid-2017, NAK requested THK to vacate the Teochew Building by 30 June 2018. This was because NAK intended to redevelop the Teochew Building. 31', 'In a letter dated 4 July 2017, THK replied, stating that should THK have to relocate, NAK should for the time being provide a place comparable to the present area occupied by THK in the Teochew Building without cost. It further requested that THK should be given a similar space in the building (after its redevelopment), and be entitled to stay there without cost, as this had been the state of affairs since 1963. 32', 'THK also asked NAK to provide a \u201creasonable relocation fee\u201d for it to move out of its premises at 97 Tank Road and later to return to the redeveloped building at the same site. 33', 'It does not appear that NAK agreed to any of the three requests.', '16\\u2003On 6 July 2018, the solicitors for NAK formally lodged a cy-pres application with the Commissioner of Charities (\u201cthe Commissioner\u201d) for the 1953 and 1959 Properties to be applied cy-pres. The Commissioner gave public notice under s 29(1) of the Charities Act (Cap 37, 2007 Rev Ed) that he intended to establish a scheme for the administration of TMS, and invited representations to be made to him by 8 November 2018. For some reason, it does not appear from the evidence that the Commissioner was aware of the ongoing dispute between NAK and THK at the time he made the cy-pres order on 18 November 2018. It was only after the order had been made, on 28 November 2018, that THK sent a letter to the Commissioner, seeking an extension of time to make representations regarding the scheme. This was not granted. THK also appeals against the cy-pres order in separate proceedings, TA 2 of 2019.', '17\\u2003By this time, it became increasingly clear that the negotiations between THK and NAK had broken down. NAK was not agreeable to THK\u2019s demands set out above at [15] and decided to commence OS 1499 for possession of the Teochew Building.'"}

He added that, as he only \nhad primary school education and a very limited command of English, he was \nnot aware that the completion documents stated that he owned only 5% of the \nFlat.13\nParties\u2019 financial contribution towards the Flat\n18 The Option to Purchase provided that the option was to be exercised by \npayment of $39,260. The Agreement Order recorded that this $39,260 payment \nwas made by way of $2,418 in cash and $36,842 from Mdm Tan\u2019s CPF account. \nMr Ng acknowledged and accepted that this $2,418 cash payment came entirely \nfrom Mdm Tan.14 Thus it is undisputed that the initial payment of $39,260 made \non 14 July 1997 to exercise the Option to Purchase (which sum was described \nas \u201cCommitment Deposit\u201d in the Agreement Order) came entirely from Mdm \nTan. \n11 Mdm Tan\u2019s 2nd Affidavit, at p 22.\n12 Mdm Tan\u2019s 1st Affidavit, at para 16.\n13 Mr Ng\u2019s 2nd Affidavit, at paras 16\u201317.\n14 Mr Ng\u2019s 2nd Affidavit, at para 20.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nTan Chor Hong v Ng Cheng Hock[2019] SGHC 257\n819 The Agreement Order also recorded that, over and above the $36,842 \ndeducted from Mdm Tan\u2019s CPF account towards the Commitment Deposit, a \nfurther sum of $2,140 was deducted from Mdm Tan\u2019s CPF account for the \nstamp fee on the HDB lease and another sum of $134.93 was deducted from \nMdm Tan\u2019s CPF account for conveyancing fees.\n20 About one and a half years later, at the completion of the sale on \n6 October 1998, the Sales Order recorded that an additional payment $7,922.44 \nwas made towards the initial capital payment of the Flat. This $7,922.44 came \nfrom Mr Ng\u2019s CPF account. That left a balance purchase price of $190,100 \nwhich was met by a loan from the HDB. The Sales Order recorded that the \nmonthly loan repayment of $1,045 was to be made by cash. No copy of the loan \nagreement with the HDB was tendered in evidence.\n21 Thus, at the point of completion in October 1998, Mdm Tan had \ncontributed $41,534.93 (comprising $39,260 towards the initial capital payment \nfor the Flat and $2,274.93 towards the stamp fee and conveyancing fee) and Mr \nNg had contributed $7,922.44.\nEvents after completion of sale \n22 About a week after completion, Mdm Tan and Mr Ng signed an \nagreement which read as follows:15\n13th October 1998\nTo : Mr Ng Cheng Hock\nRe : [address of the Flat]\n15 Mdm Tan\u2019s 1st Affidavit, at p 11 of Exhibit TCH-1\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nTan Chor Hong v Ng Cheng Hock[2019] SGHC 257\n9This is proof that a payment of S$5,000-00 has been made to \nyou by cheque no. 484456 as interest for CPF deposit \n(S$9,0000-00) deducted from your account for the above \nmentioned. \nNow it is agreed that both parties will not withdraw or sell the \nabove mentioned flat within five years.\n[signed]\nTan Chor Hong\nNric No. XXXXXXXX\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI, Ng Cheng Hock, Nric No. XXXXXXXX hereby acknowledge \nreceipt of cheque no. 484456, amounting to S$5,000-00 on \n13th October 1998 for the above interest payment and has \nagreed to the above terms and conditions.\n[signed]\nNg Cheng Hock\nNric No. XXXXXXXX\n23 Mr Ng did not stay in the Flat after completion of the sale.

Now I want to sell my flat. But my \nfriend is uncontactable and I do not know his whereabouts. I \nam lodging this report to refer to HDB and for record purpose. \nThat\u2019s all.\n24 It is undisputed that Mr Ng did not pay any monetary sums towards the \nHDB loan repayments.18 The monthly repayments, which were made solely by \nMdm Tan over the years, appeared to have fluctuated in quantum. For example, \nthe 2019 housing loan statement of account provided by HDB showed the \nmonthly instalment as $1,07119 while the 2018 statement showed that monthly \nrepayments of $1,371 were made for eight months out of 12.20 The outstanding \nloan amount as at end May 2019 was $54,457.82.21\nOverview of Mr Ng\u2019s case for claiming more than 5% of the Flat\n25 Mr Ng accepted that the monetary contribution he made towards the Flat \nwas limited to the $7,922.44 from his CPF account.22 Mr Ng also acknowledged \nreceipt of $5,000 as consideration for him agreeing to purchase the Flat together \nwith Mdm Tan. However, he claimed that this $5,000 was paid by Mr Ang and \nnot Mdm Tan. Mr Ng therefore submitted that this $5,000 should not be \nregarded as Mdm Tan\u2019s contribution towards the purchase of the Flat.23 Finally, \nMr Ng submitted that, as the $190,100 HDB loan was taken out in their joint \nnames, he should be regarded as having contributed a further $95,050 (ie, half \n18 Mr Ng\u2019s 2nd Affidavit, at para 22.\n19 Mdm Tan\u2019s 3rd Affidavit, at p 28.\n20 Mdm Tan\u2019s 1st Affidavit, at p 10 of Exhibit TCH-1.\n21 Mdm Tan\u2019s 3rd Affidavit, at p 29.\n22 Defendant\u2019s Written Submission, at para 16.\n23 Mr Ng\u2019s 2nd Affidavit, at para 14. \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nTan Chor Hong v Ng Cheng Hock[2019] SGHC 257\n11of the HDB loan) towards the purchase of the Flat. Mr Ng therefore calculated \nthat his contribution towards the purchase price was 43.4%.24\n26  Mr Ng next submitted that, since his contribution was substantially \nlarger than the 5% share registered in his name, parties should be presumed to \nhold their shares in equity in proportion to their respective contributions.25 In \nthis regard, Mr Ng submitted that the principle laid down in Lau Siew Kim v Yeo \nChye Terence and another [2008] 2 SLR(R) 108 (\u201cLau Siew Kim\u201d) at [83], that \n\u201clegal joint tenants of a property will be presumed to hold that property as \nbeneficial tenants in common of shares proportionate to their contribution to the \nacquisition of that property\u201d should also apply to legal tenancies in common. In \nother words, Mr Ng submitted that, where parties acquire a property as legal \ntenants in common with expressly specified relative shares, equity should still \nintervene to presume that parties hold as beneficial tenants in common of shares \nproportionate to their contribution.\n27 Mr Ng further submitted that, applying Su Emmanuel v Emmanuel Priya \nEtehl Anne and another [2016] 3 SLR 1223 (\u201cSu Emmanuel\u201d) at [89], the court \nought to disregard the fact that the loan repayments were all made by Mdm Tan, \nas those payments were not referable to any agreement made at the time of \nacquisition of the Flat concerning how the loan was to be serviced.26 \n24 Defendant\u2019s Written Submission, at para 16.\n25 Defendant\u2019s Written Submission, at para 22.\n26 Defendant\u2019s Written Submission, at paras 24\u201328. \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nTan Chor Hong v Ng Cheng Hock[2019] SGHC 257\n12Analysis\n28 Since the starting point of Mr Ng\u2019s submission was the case of Lau Siew \nKim, and since Mr Ng did not cite any authority where equity intervened in legal \ntenancies in common in the same way that it did in legal joint tenancies, it would \nbe useful to begin by examining the rationale given in Lau Siew Kim for the \nintervention of equity in legal joint tenancies. This rationale was explained in a \ndetailed and comprehensive discussion found at [83]\u2013[95] of Lau Siew Kim. The \nkey points of this discussion are:\n(a) Traditionally, equity\u2019s intervention in legal joint tenancies has \nbeen a reaction to the common law presumption of joint tenancy (at [83] \nand [84]).\n(b) Much like the presumption of joint tenancy at common law, there \nexists in Singapore a statutory presumption of joint tenancy in the form \nof s 53(1) of the Land Titles Act (Cap 157, 2004 Rev Ed) (\u201cLTA\u201d). \nTherefore, \u201cjust as equity inclines towards a tenancy in common when \nfaced with the common law presumption of joint tenancy, equity may \nsimilarly intervene in the statutory presumption of joint tenancy in \nSingapore to deem, as beneficial tenants in common, co-owners holding \nlocal registered land as joint tenants at law\u201d (at [87]).\n(c) The existence of s 53(1) gives rises to \u201ca default position where \nequitable presumptions may still be required to effect justice between \nthe parties given that they may have been presumed to be joint tenants \nat law without any informed or voluntary intention on their part to hold \nthe land they co-own in such a manner\u201d (at [90]).\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nTan Chor Hong v Ng Cheng Hock[2019] SGHC 257\n13(d) \u201cUnder s 53(1) of the LTA, there may exist situations where co-\nowners hold land as legal joint tenants without fully appreciating or \nvoluntarily intending the consequences of such manner of holding; there \nis, therefore, room for the intervention of equity to ensure fairness \nbetween the parties\u201d (at [92]).\n(e) \u201c[I]t is only where the registered co-owners of land had not made \na conscious and informed choice to hold as joint tenants at law that \nequity kicks in to presume a tenancy in common. In contrast, where co-\nowners had expressly specified their intention to hold land in a legal \njoint tenancy, there would be no cause for equity not to follow the law; \nthus, in such instances, legal joint tenants should also be beneficial joint \ntenants unless it may be shown that the expressly-state choice should be \nvitiated for some reason\u201d [emphasis in original] (at [93]).\n(f) If there had been no statutory presumption of joint tenancy in the \nform of s 53(1) of the LTA, and if parties were required to state their \nmanner of holding (failing which the land registrar would refuse to \nregister transfers), \u201cthe equitable presumption of a tenancy in common \nmight have been displaced and rendered unnecessary\u201d (at [88]\u2013[89]).\n(g) Where parties can make an informed choice as to whichever type \nof co-ownership they desire, \u201cthere would be no need, generally, for any \nintervention on the part of the courts or equity to presume a completely \ndifferent beneficial manner of holding\u201d (at [94]). \n29 From the foregoing summary, it can be seen that:\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nTan Chor Hong v Ng Cheng Hock[2019] SGHC 257\n14(a) The equitable presumption that parties hold as beneficial tenants \nin common in proportion to their contributions to the acquisition of the \nproperty is a reaction to the legal presumption of joint tenancy.\n(b) Equity intervenes in a legal joint tenancy in order to \u201ceffect \njustice between the parties\u201d or \u201censure fairness between the parties\u201d \nbecause of the legal presumption of joint tenancy gives rise to the risk \nthat the parties may \u201chold land as legal joint tenants without fully \nappreciating or voluntarily intending the consequences of such manner \nof holder\u201d or \u201cmay have been presumed to be joint tenants at law without \nany informed or voluntary intention on their part to hold the land they \nco-own in such a manner\u201d (Lau Siew Kim at [90] and [92]).\n(c) Where co-owners have expressly specified their intention on \ntheir manner of holding, \u201cthere would be no cause for equity not to \nfollow the law\u201d (at [93]). \n30 Since there is no legal presumption concerning tenancies in common, \nthe consideration at [ 29(a)] above would not apply to a legal tenancy in \ncommon. Since, in a purchase of property as legal tenants in common, parties \nwould necessarily have to state expressly their relative share, the consideration \nat [29(b)] above would also not apply to a legal tenancy in common. Lastly, \nsince legal tenants in common would have expressly specified their intention to \nhold as tenants in common and expressly specified their relative shares in the \nproperty, legal tenancies in common fall within the situation described at [ 29(c)] \nabove, with the result that equity should follow the law.\n31 I therefore held that, where parties had expressly agreed to hold as \ntenants in common and expressly agreed on their relative shares, there was no \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nTan Chor Hong v Ng Cheng Hock[2019] SGHC 257\n15room for equity to intervene with an equitable presumption that parties held as \nbeneficial tenants in common in proportion to their contributions to the \nacquisition of the property.\n32 Mr Ng submitted that he only had primary school education and had a \nvery limited command of English, that he was not made aware that the \ncompletion documents stated that he had only a 5% share of the Flat, and that \nhe did not agree to the 5%.27 I did not give much weight to this submission. First, \nMr Ng had not relied on the doctrine of non est factum. In my view, he was right \nnot to claim non est factum as such a claim would clearly have been \nunsustainable on the facts. Secondly, the effects of the HDB documents he \nsigned would in all likelihood have been explained to him when he attended at \nthe HDB office to sign the documents. Thirdly, even if I were to accept that Mr \nNg had a poor command of English, he would at the minimum have been able \nto recognise his own name and been able to read the number \u201c5\/100\u201d against his \nname on both the Sale Order and the Agreement Order, as well as on the \nAgreement for Lease. Fourthly, counsel for Mr Ng accepted that both Mr Ng \nand Mdm Tan were equally handicapped when it came to reading English.28 \n33 Lastly, given the factual background (especially having regard to the \nnature of the relationship between the parties as well as the purpose for \npurchasing the Flat and the reason Mr Ng\u2019s assistance was sought), I found it \nextremely unlikely that either Mr Ang or Mdm Tan would have promised Mr \nNg a half-share in the Flat simply for helping out in the manner he did. I found \nthat, in all probability, an offer of $5,000 cash upfront plus a 5% share when the \n27 Defendant\u2019s Written Submission, at para 12.\n28 Notes of Argument, 9 July 2019 at p 8, lines 15\u201318.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nTan Chor Hong v Ng Cheng Hock[2019] SGHC 257\n16Flat was eventually sold would have been sufficiently attractive to persuade Mr \nNg to assist Mr Ang or Mdm Tan in the manner he did.\n34 I therefore found that Mr Ng is bound by the contractual documents he \nsigned and therefore acquired only a 5% share in the Flat.\n35 Given my finding at [ 34] above, there was no need for me to consider \nMr Ng\u2019s further submission at [ 27] above, since that submission would become \nrelevant only if I were to accept Mr Ng\u2019s submission at [ 26] above that equity \nwould intervene in a legal tenancy in common to disregard parties\u2019 express \nagreement on their relative shares. This was because the principle set out in Su \nEmmanuel at [89] is in essence a method for ascertaining the parties\u2019 respective \ncontributions in the event that the court has decided that parties in a legal joint \ntenancy are presumed to hold as beneficial tenants in common. There was no \nscope for applying the said principle in the present case given my finding, on \nthe facts, that parties hold as tenants in common in the shares specified in the \ncontractual documents, as opposed to in shares in proportion to their respective \ncontributions. Nevertheless, for completeness, I shall explain why, even if I \nwere wrong in my finding at [ 34] above, the proper application of the principle \nin Su Emmanuel at [89] would have led me to attribute all the loan repayments \nto Mdm Tan instead of apportioning the loan repayments equally between Mr \nNg and Mdm Tan.\n36Su Emmanuel states at [89] that:\n\u2026 When a mortgage is taken out, the crucial consideration is \nthe parties\u2019 intentions, at the time the property is acquired, as \nto the ultimate source of the funds for purchase of that property \n(see Lau Siew Kim at [116] and Bertei v Feher [2000] WASCA \n165 at [44]). Actual mortgage payments made at a later time \nwould therefore only count as direct contributions to the \npurchase price where these are referable to, and in keeping \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nTan Chor Hong v Ng Cheng Hock[2019] SGHC 257\n17with, a prior agreement between the parties as to who would be \nliable to repay the loan. \u2026\n37 Mr Ng\u2019s submission was that, because the HDB loan was taken out in \nMdm Tan\u2019s and Mr Ng\u2019s joint names, half of the loan amount should be \nattributed to Mr Ng as his contribution. Although Mr Ng did not tender the loan \ndocumentation in evidence, I would have been prepared to accept that the HDB \nloan was, in all likelihood, taken out in both their names. However, the fact that \nthe loan was taken out in both their names did not necessarily mean that each \nparty must be taken as having contributed the equivalent of half the loan. As \nexplained in Su Emmanuel at [90]:\nMany factors are engaged in the determination of the precise \nagreement or understanding between the parties as to who \nwould repay the mortgage. The focus should not lie exclusively \non who took on liability for the mortgage as against the bank. \nOften such liability will be joint because the bank would like to \nhave the widest choice of the parties against whom it can \nenforce the liability under the mortgage. Rather, the question \nwill turn on what the operating agreement was between the co-\nowning parties at the time the loan was taken out. In this \nregard, subsequent conduct may be relevant to the extent that \nit sheds light on such an agreement (if any) between the co-\nowners. Thus, in Chan Yuen Lan [v See Fong Mun [2014] 3 SLR \n1048], despite the fact that liability for the loan fell on the wife, \nthe court found that the agreement between the parties was for \nthe husband to repay the loan and therefore the loan amount \nof $400,000 was attributed to the husband as his direct \ncontribution to the acquisition of the property (at [81]\u2013[87]). \n[emphasis in original] \n38 Mdm Tan\u2019s evidence was that she had verbally agreed with Mr Ng that \nhe would leave the Flat to be solely managed by her.29 She submitted that it was \npursuant to this verbal agreement that she made all the mortgage loan \n29 Mdm Tan\u2019s 1st Affidavit, at para 17. \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nTan Chor Hong v Ng Cheng Hock[2019] SGHC 257\n18repayments.30 Mr Ng denied that there was such a verbal agreement. He referred \nto the written agreement of 13 October 1998 (see [ 22] above) and submitted that \nsince this written agreement was silent on the question of liability for repayment \nof the loan, that amounted to evidence that there was no verbal agreement \nbetween parties on the liability for repayment of the loan.31 \n39 I did not agree with Mr Ng that I should read so much into the absence \nof provisions concerning loan repayment in the 13 October 1998 written \nagreement. That written agreement recorded the payment of $5,000 by Mdm \nTan in consideration of Mr Ng contributing $9,000 [sic] from his CPF account \ntowards the acquisition of the Flat and contained a further stipulation that parties \nagreed not to sell the Flat within the HDB-mandated minimum occupation \nperiod of five years. On its face, the 13 October 1998 agreement was not drafted \nin a manner which signified that it was intended to comprehensively and \nexhaustively encompass all of the parties\u2019 understanding concerning the Flat. \n40 In contrast, I found that Mdm Tan\u2019s submission was more consistent \nwith the factual background and with the parties\u2019 subsequent conduct. Dealing \nfirst with the latter point, I noted that this was not a case where Mr Ng had \ninitially made some contributions towards the loan repayment only for those \ncontributions to cease after he moved to Japan. What in fact occurred was that, \nfor the two years between the completion of the purchase of the Flat and Mr \nNg\u2019s move to Japan, he made no contribution at all towards the loan repayment. \nThis conduct was strong evidence that the parties\u2019 understanding was that Mdm \nTan would be solely responsible for the loan repayment. \n30 Notes of Argument, 9 July 2019, at p 3, lines 11\u201312 and p 8, lines 26\u201330. \n31 Notes of Argument, 9 July 2019, at p 7, line 31 to p 8, line 10.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nTan Chor Hong v Ng Cheng Hock[2019] SGHC 257\n1941 As for the factual background, I noted that whether on Mr Ng\u2019s version \n(ie, Mr Ang wishing to provide a roof over Mdm Tan\u2019s head) or Mdm Tan\u2019s \nversion (ie, Mdm Tan was planning to buy a flat with her mother but her mother \nhad passed away), the key feature of the factual background was that of Mdm \nTan seeking to obtain a flat for her own occupation but being unable to do so in \nher sole name due to the relevant HDB requirements, thus necessitating Mr Ng\u2019s \nassistance to consent to his name to be included as a co-owner of the Flat. Given \nthis factual background, it was extremely unlikely that either Mr Ang or Mdm \nTan would have expected Mr Ng to bear responsibility for half of the mortgage \nloan and equally unlikely that Mr Ng would have agreed to do so.\n42 I would therefore have found that it was the parties\u2019 understanding, at \nthe time the Flat was purchased, that Mdm Tan would be solely responsible for \nrepayment of the HDB mortgage loan. What this would mean in terms of \nparties\u2019 relative contribution was that Mr Ng\u2019s contribution was limited to the \n$7,922.44 from his CPF account, which amounted to only 3.3% of the purchase \nprice of the Flat. If the $5,000 paid to Mr Ng on 13 October 1998 were taken \ninto account, Mr Ng\u2019s contribution would be only $2,922.44, which amounted \nto 1.2% of the purchase price.\n43 For the reasons given above, I held that Mdm Tan is the owner of 95% \nof the Flat while Mr N`g is the owner of 5% of the Flat.\nWhether the court should order the sale of the Flat\n44 As noted in Su Emmanuel at [57(a)]:\nIn deciding whether it is necessary or expedient for a sale to be \nordered in lieu of partition, the court conducts a balancing \nexercise of various factors, including (i) the state of the \nrelationship between the parties (which would be indicative of \nwhether they are likely to be able to co-operate in the future); \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nTan Chor Hong v Ng Cheng Hock[2019] SGHC 257\n20(ii) the state of the property; and (iii) the prospect of the \nrelationship between the parties deteriorating if a sale was not \ngranted such that a \u201cclean break\u201d would be preferable.\n45 It was clear that the relationship between parties had deteriorated to such \nan extent that it would be necessary and expedient for a sale to be ordered in \nlieu of partition. \n46 Mdm Tan\u2019s affidavits recounted how Mr Ng broke into the Flat32 and \nlocked Mdm Tan and her tenants out of the property.33 Although Mdm Tan \ncalled the police on Mr Ng a few times, the police left Mr Ng alone after they \nfound out upon arrival that Mr Ng was a co-owner of the Flat.34 Mr Ng also \ncreated loud disturbances in the Flat, threw food on the floor, and shouted at and \nthreatened Mdm Tan and the tenants of the Flat.35 The tenants found the situation \nunbearable and moved out.36 Mdm Tan herself became so fearful that she moved \nout of the Flat on 16 March 2019.37 Mdm Tan also received various text \nmessages from Mr Ng which she perceived as taunts and harassment.38 On 22 \nMarch 2019, Mr Ng even sent Mdm Tan a photograph of a kitchen chopper \nlying on the coffee table in the living room, with a caption (in Chinese) that \ntranslated as \u201cThere is a chopper at the main door. If you try to enter, it is either \nyour death or mine\u201d.39 Mdm Tan perceived this as a death threat. Mdm Tan also \n32 Mdm Tan\u2019s 2nd Affidavit, at para 56.\n33 Mdm Tan\u2019s 2nd Affidavit, at paras 35, 43, 45, 56\u201360 and 66.\n34 Mdm Tan\u2019s 2nd Affidavit at para 57.\n35 Mdm Tan\u2019s 2nd Affidavit at para 67.\n36 Mdm Tan\u2019s 2nd Affidavit at paras 67 and 72.\n37 Mdm Tan\u2019s 2nd Affidavit at para 69.\n38 Mdm Tan\u2019s 2nd Affidavit at paras 73\u201375.\n39 Mdm Tan\u2019s 2nd Affidavit at para 76 and p 83.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nTan Chor Hong v Ng Cheng Hock[2019] SGHC 257\n21tendered an affidavit from one of her tenants to corroborate her allegations \nagainst Mr Ng.40 \n47 Mr Ng denied some of these allegations and tried to explain some of the \nothers away. Even though he gave evidence that his only wish was to stay at the \nFlat,41 he did not make any submission against the court making an order of sale.\n48 Having regard to the foregoing, I concluded that this was a suitable case \nfor making an order of sale. I therefore made an order for sale of the Flat in lieu \nof partition pursuant to para 2 of the First Schedule to the Supreme Court of \nJudicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) (\u201cSCJA\u201d).\nWhether Mdm Tan should be given sole conduct of the sale\n49 Mdm Tan prayed to be given the sole conduct of the sale of the Flat. Mr \nNg objected to this. He submitted that, if Mdm Tan were to be given sole \nconduct, she could \u201ceasily play out\u201d Mr Ng.42 Mr Ng further submitted that he \nshould not be deprived of the right to participate in the sale.43 Mdm Tan \nsubmitted that, given the acrimonious nature of parties\u2019 relationship, there was \nconcern that Mr Ng would not cooperate in the sale.44\n50 Where one of two co-owners applies to court for a sale in lieu of \npartition, it could be because one owner wishes to sell while the other owner \ndoes not wish to sell. In such a situation, it may be unrealistic to expect the other \n40 Affidavit of Sarline, filed on 30 May 2019.\n41 Mr Ng\u2019s 2nd Affidavit at para 6. \n42 Notes of Arguments, 9 July 2019, p 11 at lines 11\u201312.\n43 Notes of Arguments, 29 July 2019, p 3 at line 6.\n44 Notes of Arguments, 29 July 2019, p 2 at lines 7\u20138.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nTan Chor Hong v Ng Cheng Hock[2019] SGHC 257\n22owner to cooperate in the sale if the court were to order a sale with parties having \njoint conduct of the sale. In such a situation, an order for joint conduct of the \nsale would simply afford the owner not wishing to sell an opportunity to hold \nup the sale. \n51 In my view, the foregoing considerations apply squarely to the present \ncase. Although Mr Ng did not formally object to the court granting an order of \nsale, his past behaviour demonstrated that he may have an incentive to not \ncooperate in the sale, especially since the Flat is now solely occupied by him, \nwith Mdm Tan fearful of returning to the Flat. The state of the parties\u2019 \nrelationship (as recounted above) also meant that it is unrealistic to expect \nparties to cooperate in the sale. Finally, having regard to the fact that Mdm Tan \nwill be entitled to 95% of the sale proceeds while Mr Ng will only be entitled \nto 5%, I considered it fair and equitable for Mdm Tan to have sole conduct of \nthe sale, subject to the following safeguards:\n(a) Mdm Tan shall keep Mr Ng updated on all issues of importance \nconcerning the sale process, including the appointment of property \nagents for the conduct of the sale, the appointment of conveyancing \nlawyers for the conduct of the sale and all offers received for the \npurchase of the Flat.\n(b) Mr Ng shall be at liberty to apply.\nWhether Mdm Tan should be given the right to buy over Mr Ng\u2019s share\n52  Mdm Tan prayed, as an alternative to selling the entire Flat to a third \nparty, for an order that she be given the right to buy over Mr Ng\u2019s share in the \nFlat. Mr Ng submitted that there was no basis in law for the court to make such \nan order.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nTan Chor Hong v Ng Cheng Hock[2019] SGHC 257\n2353 I agreed with Mr Ng\u2019s submission. It was noteworthy that even though \nI had granted an adjournment for Mdm Tan\u2019s counsel to do further research, she \nwas not able to furnish any authorities in support of such an order.45 The wording \nof para 2 of the First Schedule of the SCJA is clear. It empowers the court to \n\u201corder the land or any part of it to be sold\u201d. It does not empower the court to \nallow one co-owner to compulsorily purchase the other co-owner\u2019s share.\n54 I therefore declined to make an order giving Mdm Tan the right to \npurchase Mr Ng\u2019s share. Notwithstanding this ruling, parties are not precluded \nfrom negotiating with each other for one side to buy over the other\u2019s share at a \nmutually agreed price.\nConclusion\n55 In the light of the foregoing, I ordered the sale of the Flat in the open \nmarket, with the sale proceeds to be divided in the proportion of 95% to Mdm \nTan and 5% to Mr Ng. Mdm Tan is to have sole conduct of the sale, subject to \nthe safeguards outlined at [ 51] above. I also ordered each party to make the \nnecessary refund (if any) to their CPF accounts from their respective shares of \nthe sale proceeds. In keeping with my finding that it was the parties\u2019 \nunderstanding that Mdm Tan was to be solely responsible for repaying the \nhousing loan, the repayment of the outstanding loan shall be made fully from \nMdm Tan\u2019s share of the sale proceeds. Finally, I ordered Mdm Tan to account \nto Mr Ng for 5% of all rental proceeds she had received from the Flat. There \nshall be liberty for parties to apply.\n56 I made no order as to costs as Mr Ng was legally aided. \n45 Notes of Arguments, 29 July 2019, at p 2 lines 21\u201327.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nTan Chor Hong v Ng Cheng Hock[2019] SGHC 257\n24Pang Khang Chau\nJudge \nSujatha Selvakumar (I.R.B.

In this judgment, I will endeavour to set out the gist of the arbitrator\u2019s reasons for his award. This is relevant as the questions of law which the applicant raises in support of her leave to appeal will have to be examined against the arbitrator\u2019s reasons to determine if the various requirements for granting leave to appeal are met.', '8\\u2003First, in relation to the alleged discrepancies between the as-built condition of the house and the construction drawings issued by the architect, the arbitrator noted that the architect had confirmed during cross-examination that the alleged discrepancies (or deviations) had been authorised by him, save for one item. 24', 'The arbitrator also concluded that the architect had presented himself as a credible witness, who acted in a non-partisan manner during the hearings before him. 25', 'Since clause 12(1) of the SIA Conditions permits the architect to sanction all variations previously carried out by the contractor, the arbitrator found that the alleged discrepancies were in fact variations that had been sanctioned by the architect. Accordingly, save for the one item of work which had not been sanctioned by the architect, for which the arbitrator awarded the applicant S$156.25, the arbitrator found that the respondent was not liable for the other alleged discrepancies between the respondent\u2019s completed works and the works specified in the contract. 26', '9\\u2003Second, in relation to the claim for defective works, the architect considered the various defects claimed by the applicant, as well as the evidence of the parties\u2019 quantum experts, in determining the appropriate sum to award for each item that he found to be a defect. On the whole, the arbitrator was more inclined towards the evidence of the respondent\u2019s quantum expert, Mr Stanley Wong, than that of the applicant\u2019s quantum expert, Mr Amos Teo (\u201cMr Teo\u201d). 27', 'This was because he found Mr Teo\u2019s evidence to be less reliable. Just as an example, Mr Teo had provided a separate amount for scaffolding for a single item of hairline crack, even though scaffolding was already provided for under the section of \u201cPreliminaries\u201d. According to the arbitrator, this separate provision for scaffolding was not logical, unless Mr Teo was suggesting that for \u201cten such areas of defects, the [applicant] is going to appoint ten different contractors \u2026 and each individual contractor must install its own scaffold\u201d to make good the defects. 28', '10\\u2003As for the claim for loss of rental, the arbitrator found that the applicant had not submitted any concrete or substantiated evidence to show proof that there was any intention to rent out the property. In this regard, the arbitrator considered that the evidence showed that the applicant\u2019s intention at all times was to sell, rather than rent, the property. In any case, there was no proof that her inability to rent out the property was due to the alleged defects. Furthermore, the loss of rental was too remote a loss, as it was not within the reasonable contemplation of parties at the time of the signing of the contract that there would be a claim for loss of rental in the event that there were defects. 29', '11\\u2003Turning to the claim for loss in value of the property, the arbitrator concluded that there was insufficient evidence to show that the property could not be sold at the applicant\u2019s expected price of S$7m due to the alleged defects. 30', 'The S$7m valuation was based on a text message from a bank officer to the applicant\u2019s real estate agent. 31', 'However, the arbitrator rejected this text message as hearsay evidence, given that the bank officer that sent the message was not called to give evidence as to how she arrived at the figure of S$7m. 32', 'The arbitrator further rejected the evidence of the applicant\u2019s expert on property valuation, Mr Goh Tiam Lock (\u201cMr Goh\u201d). While Mr Goh\u2019s evidence supported the valuation of S$7m, the arbitrator found that Mr Goh\u2019s valuation appeared to have been arbitrary and significantly higher than the other transactions concluded around the same time in the vicinity of the property, as shown by the records of property transactions maintained by the Urban Redevelopment Authority. 33', 'Apart from being unable to prove that the price of the property was S$7m, 34', 'the arbitrator also found that the applicant had not proven that the defects were the cause of the property\u2019s loss in value (if any). This was because there had been two offers from prospective buyers for the property. Although these two offers were lower than the applicant\u2019s expected price of S$7m, the applicant failed to show that the alleged defects were the cause of the lower prices offered by the prospective buyers. Thus, it could very well have been that the applicant\u2019s inability to sell the property at S$7m was caused by the fact that the expected price of S$7m was simply unrealistic, and not because of the alleged defects. 35', 'As such, the arbitrator found that the applicant did not adduce sufficient evidence to support her contention that the loss in value of the property was due to the alleged defects. 36', '12\\u2003In relation to the claim for liquidated damages, the arbitrator considered that, pursuant to clause 24(2) of the SIA Conditions, a claim of liquidated damages must be founded on a valid delay certificate. In this respect, clause 24(2) provides that \u201c[u]pon receipt of a [d]elay [c]ertificate the [applicant] shall be entitled to recover from the [respondent] liquidated damages\u201d. 37', 'The architect had issued two delay certificates, with the second purporting to supersede the first. The architect himself admitted that the first delay certificate was flawed as it did not state the information required under clause 24(1) of the SIA Conditions. Hence, he issued a second delay certificate on 26 October 2015. However, this second delay certificate was also invalid as clause 31(6) of the SIA Conditions makes clear that an architect cannot correct or amend or supersede a previous delay certificate issued by him. 38', 'As both delay certificates issued by the architect were invalid, the applicant\u2019s claim for liquidated damages failed. 39', '13\\u2003Finally, in relation to the respondent\u2019s counterclaim, the arbitrator awarded the sum of S$98,797.34 to the respondent in respect of works that remained unpaid for. This sum in main consisted of sums which had been reflected in the architect\u2019s Statement of Final Account, as well as other variation works. 40', 'However, the respondent\u2019s claim for additional labour costs was rejected entirely, as the additional labourers had been deployed on the respondent\u2019s own accord, without the architect\u2019s instruction. 41', '14\\u2003Having considered both the applicant\u2019s claims and the respondent\u2019s counterclaims, the arbitrator concluded that since more was due from the applicant to the respondent than vice versa, the applicant was to pay the net amount of S$59,558.37 to the respondent. 42', '15\\u2003Having summarised the arbitrator\u2019s award, I proceed to set out the chronology of events that led to the release of the arbitrator\u2019s award. The chronology is important to my decision as to whether an extension of time is required for the applicant to appeal against the arbitrator\u2019s award, and whether such extension of time ought to be granted.', '16\\u2003On 22 March 2017, the respondent\u2019s counsel wrote to the arbitrator that the respondent was facing financial difficulties. 43', 'Pursuant to the respondent counsel\u2019s letter, there was a conference with the arbitrator on 27 March 2017. During the conference, Mr Michael Sng, the managing director of the respondent, confirmed that the respondent was in financial trouble, and that he would arrange to pay the outstanding bill owed to the arbitrator progressively. 44', 'Subsequently, in a letter dated 24 April 2017, the respondent informed the arbitrator that it would try to sell the respondent\u2019s office premises to pay the outstanding sums owed to the arbitrator. 45', '17\\u2003Later, on 18 July 2017, the arbitrator wrote to the parties to inform them that the award would be ready for collection from 25 July 2017. He went on to state that the award would be released upon payment of the outstanding balance of his fees and expenses, amounting to the aggregate sum of S$57,929.17. 46', 'The applicant\u2019s and the respondent\u2019s shares of what was outstanding at that time were S$9,027.09 and S$48,902.08 respectively. 47', '18\\u2003The award by the arbitrator was dated 25 July 2017, 48', 'but parties did not collect the award on that date.', '19\\u2003After multiple reminders that the award was ready for collection, the applicant wrote to the arbitrator on 29 August 2017 to propose that the arbitrator release the award to her if she paid her outstanding share of S$9,027.09. 49', 'Not unexpectedly, given that Article 16.1 of the Singapore Institute of Architects Arbitration Rules (2nd Ed, 2009) (\u201cSIA Rules\u201d) provides that parties are \u201cjointly and severally liable to the Arbitrator for payment of all such fees and expenses until they have been paid in full\u201d, 50', 'the arbitrator did not agree to this proposal, and he instead wrote to the respondent, requesting that the respondent pay its outstanding share of S$48,902.09 before he released the award. 51', '20\\u2003Thereafter, on 14 September 2017, at a conference with the arbitrator, the applicant\u2019s counsel was informed that the respondent was still trying to sell its office premises to raise funds to pay the arbitrator\u2019s fees and expenses. In light of the situation, the applicant\u2019s counsel indicated that he would speak to the applicant, for the applicant to consider if she was willing to pay the balance of the arbitrator\u2019s fees and expenses. 52', 'However, despite multiple reminders and letters that were sent by the arbitrator thereafter, no payment was made by either party. 53', '21\\u2003Finally, after almost ten months, on 17 May 2018, the arbitrator released the award to the parties even though he had not been paid his outstanding fees and expenses. 54', '22\\u2003The respondent subsequently made payment of its share of the outstanding fees and expenses to the arbitrator on about 18 June 2018. 55', 'According to the respondent, it had completed the sale of premises on 10 May 2018 and had thus raised the money to be able to make payment. 56', '23\\u2003Up to the time the parties appeared before me, the applicant, on the other hand, has not paid her outstanding share of $9,027.11 to the arbitrator. 57'"}

There is some dispute as to the nature of this entity in relation to TGPL which will be set out below. Be that as it may, it is not disputed that the signboards at the Clementi Centre displayed the name \u201cREAL Education Centre\u201d and not \u201cTuition Genius\u201d. The Clementi Centre offered tuition in various subjects to primary, secondary and junior college (\u201cJC\u201d) students.

Other tutors provided tuition at the Clementi Centre for economics as well as for other subjects. Tuition fees were collected by TGPL and the tutors were paid by TGPL in accordance with the number of students in their classes. The fees from Eugene\u2019s students at the Clementi Centre were initially paid into TGPL. However, in 2012, the fees from Eugene\u2019s classes at the Clementi Centre were paid directly to Eugene. Eugene explained that he had initially paid the fees he earned personally into the plaintiff\u2019s bank accounts in order to assist the plaintiff\u2019s cash flow situation in the first few years after its incorporation.', '11\\u2003In November 2010, Eugene registered ETG as a sole proprietorship.', '12\\u2003In June 2011, TGPL opened a second branch at Bedok (\u201cBedok Centre\u201d).

Keng\u2019s impression was that Eugene would not give Jun Hao access to computers and records, and had made sure that Jun Hao would only be assigned menial tasks such as the distribution of flyers. While Jun Hao accepted that Eugene purported to teach him about handling finance-related matters for TGPL, he claimed not to have access to TGPL accounts, and was not shown any information about money being paid to Eugene. 23', 'According to Eugene, starting from 2014, Jun Hao was expressly informed in the course of training by the other staff in TGPL that REC and ETG were separate business entities with different owners, and that the revenue generated by REC and ETG classes were to be kept and recorded separately. 24', 'Jun Hao also handled the registration of new students and prepared TGPL\u2019s daily reports.', '19\\u2003On 1 October 2015, Eugene resigned as a director of TGPL, and transferred his shareholding in TGPL to Keng. 25', 'Keng in turn transferred his entire shareholding in TGPL to Jun Hao on 25 November 2015, and Jun Hao was appointed a director of TGPL. 26', 'The transfer form signed by Keng included a purported liability exclusion clause, which stated \u201call company related matters & accounts have been handed over as of 1st October 2015 to [Keng].

According to Jun Hao, Eugene left because of Keng and Jun Hao\u2019s growing suspicions about him siphoning money away from TGPL, in that Eugene announced his decision to leave after Jun Hao started questioning him about TGPL accounts. 27', '21\\u2003Eugene\u2019s position was that the relationship between the parties began deteriorating in late 2014 due to the rumours that Keng was involved in an extramarital affair with Eugene\u2019s mother. On 9 September 2015, Xiang Qi was involved in a car-chase incident with Eugene\u2019s mother (\u201cCar-Chase incident\u201d). Video footage played in court showed that Xiang Qi drove her car into the path of Eugene\u2019s mother\u2019s car, and at times reversed slowly towards Eugene\u2019s mother. For this, Xiang Qi was prosecuted and sentenced to five days\u2019 imprisonment. 28', 'As a result of this incident, Eugene claimed to have felt the need to expedite his exit from TGPL to prevent any further escalation. 29', '22\\u2003After Eugene left TGPL, he received a letter of demand from the plaintiff\u2019s solicitors.

At about this time, Lee also informed the Plaintiff that IRS could not continue to trade under its name, and was undergoing a name change to United Yield International Pte Ltd (\u201cUYI\u201d). 5', 'This necessitated a new agreement being entered into with UYI, which was signed on 18 August 2006. 6', '5\\u2003Subsequently, the plaintiff discovered that certain representations made by Lee were false: 7', '(a)\\u2003IRS did not undergo a name change to UYI.

Lee relied on two grounds for striking out: (a) the plaintiff\u2019s action was time-barred; and (b) the wrong party had been sued. The assistant registrar did not find that the suit was time-barred, but agreed that the wrong party had been sued. In relation to the plaintiff\u2019s attempt to pierce the corporate veil against Lee, the assistant registrar was of the view that this was not sufficiently pleaded in the plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim. While the assistant registrar would have been inclined to dismiss the application if there was evidence suggesting that the corporate veil could be pierced, no such evidence was included in the affidavit filed to resist the application.

However, according to information that had been provided by the plaintiff to the LTA in an email dated 8 January 2019, the first defendant did some calculations and determined that the \u201cfinal quantity of disposal\u201d was only 136,462 m3. 19', 'The calculations were based on certain assumptions made by the first defendant.

The plaintiff went on to describe the first defendant\u2019s calculations in its letter of 14 January 2019 as being based on some \u201chitherto undisclosed\u201d method of measurement and weight conversion formula, which was not in accordance with the terms of the Subcontract. 21', '12\\u2003On 7 February 2019, the first defendant replied to assert that it was entitled to \u201cchallenge in arbitration\u201d the reasoning which the adjudicator in SOP 372\/2018 had adopted in coming to his determination. 22', 'The letter went on to state: 23', '13\\u2003In that letter, the first defendant went on to accuse the plaintiff of making a fraudulent over-claim.

The plaintiff also pointed out that the first defendant\u2019s assertion that a figure of 136,462 m3 had been submitted by the plaintiff to the LTA was untrue because this figure had never appeared in any of the records or emails sent by the plaintiff to LTA. 25', '15\\u2003The first defendant wrote on 27 February 2019 to state that it was relying on the plaintiff\u2019s own data on the lorry loads and the weight of quantities reported to the LTA as being disposed of from the worksite.

This was a far cry from the 47,040 m3 of hardcore material which, according to the first defendant, the plaintiff claimed in PC 24 had been processed by way of sieving and crushing at the TOL treatment area.

While the first defendant took issue with PC 24, the nub of its complaint about over-claims was with reference to the work that had already been claimed for under PC 20.

The difference in amount between (a) and (b) for each item was described as the \u201coverpayment\u201d. Tallying the alleged \u201coverpayments\u201d, and after deducting the retention monies and adding GST, the first defendant arrived at the sum of S$2,057,944.79, which it claimed to have overpaid the plaintiff. 35', '25\\u2003 While these allegations that the plaintiff had made inflated claims were being alleged and refuted, on 31 January 2019, the plaintiff served Payment Claim No 25 (\u201cPC 25\u201d) on the first defendant.

SSGT Helmi\u2019s \nInducement was made in the context of Ansari having first begged SSGT Helmi \nto \u201clet Bella go because she was not involved in the case\u201d, to which SSGT Helmi \nresponded, \u201cit depends on what you say\u201d, which was very shortly after Ansari \nand Bella had been arrested with the Drugs found in the Car. \n33 I find that the most obvious and natural meaning of the reply \u201cit depends \non what you say\u201d in response to Ansari\u2019s alleged begging to \u201clet Bella go \nbecause she was not involved in the case\u201d, prior to the recording of the \nContemporaneous Statement, would mean that Ansari had to give a positive \nstatement by taking full responsibility for the Drugs found in the Car in order \n34 Prosecution\u2019s Ancillary Hearing Submissions at para 23.\n35 Prosecution\u2019s Ancillary Hearing Submissions at para 26.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Mohamed Ansari bin Mohamed Abdul Aziz[2019] SGHC 268\n16for Bella to be let go. This is consistent with Ansari\u2019s own subjective \nunderstanding and interpretation of SSGT Helmi\u2019s statement, which is that if he \n(ie, Ansari) had taken responsibility for the Drugs, the CNB officers would let \nBella go.36 The meaning of the words, \u201cit depends on what you say\u201d is not as \nunclear as the prosecution submits, when the words of SSGT Helmi\u2019s \nInducement, tied in with the context in which they were allegedly uttered, begets \nan objective inducement of Ansari to incriminate himself for the Drugs found \nin the Car in order for Bella to be let off. \n34 The words \u201cit depends on what you say\u201d could also not possibly have \nmeant that what was required of Ansari was merely that he had to give a \nstatement (ie, whether positive, negative or mixed), as the prosecution had \nsuggested as an alternative interpretation of the words. First, the alleged SSGT \nHelmi\u2019s Inducement was phrased, \u201cit depends on what you say\u201d, and not \u201cit \ndepends on whether you say anything\u201d. The former makes specific reference to \nthe contents of Ansari\u2019s subsequent statements, rather than whether or not \nAnsari made subsequent statements at all. Second, a logical inference of the \nwords in that context could not have meant that Ansari just had to give a \nstatement. Giving a statement, especially if it is a completely negative \nstatement, would have been of little utility to a CNB officer. If Ansari were to \ndeny complete responsibility for the Drugs found in the Car, how then would \nBella be let off? Nobody would then be responsible for the Drugs found. An \nobjective interpretation of SSGT Helmi\u2019s Inducement in that context is that \nAnsari would be required to sufficiently assist the CNB in a manner that \njustified allowing Bella to be let go. In other words, SSGT Helmi had strongly \nhinted that if Ansari were to give a positive statement taking full responsibility \n36 Transcript 28 August 2019 at p 59.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Mohamed Ansari bin Mohamed Abdul Aziz[2019] SGHC 268\n17for the Drugs found in the Car, then Ansari\u2019s plea to him to let Bella go might \nbe acceded to. \n35 It is also irrelevant whether in fact SSGT Helmi had the authority to let \nBella off as long as the inducement had sufficiently operated on the mind of \nAnsari to give Ansari reasonable grounds to believe or suppose that his plea for \nBella to be let go would be attended to if he had cooperated and taken full \nresponsibility for the Drugs found in the Car. This is not a wholly self-perceived \ninducement on the part of Ansari. It is a clear inducement proceeding from \nSSGT Helmi that falls within the meaning of s 258(3) of the CPC. Since the \nalleged SSGT Helmi\u2019s Inducement in response to Ansari\u2019s begging SSGT \nHelmi to \u201clet Bella go\u201d would objectively involve a quid pro quo, I reject the \nprosecution\u2019s proposition that SSGT Helmi\u2019s Inducement could have been a \nform of self-perceived inducement. \n36 For the above reasons, I find that the alleged SSGT Helmi\u2019s Inducement, \nhad it been made, would have objectively been an inducement that would have \nsubjectively operated on the mind of Ansari to render the Contemporaneous \nStatements involuntary.\nWhether SSGT Helmi\u2019s Inducement was in fact made\n37 Evaluating the evidence in its totality, I have a reasonable doubt that \nboth the plea from Ansari to SSGT Helmi to let Bella go and SSGT Helmi\u2019s \nInducement in response were not made. \n38 I find it quite hard to believe that Ansari would not have raised any \nconcerns about Bella with the recording officer at all. Ansari, who was 43 years \nold at the time of the alleged offence, was significantly older than Bella, who \nwas in her early twenties. Given their age difference, the fact that Bella had a 3-\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Mohamed Ansari bin Mohamed Abdul Aziz[2019] SGHC 268\n18year old daughter from Indonesia whom she was responsible for, Ansari \nwitnessing Bella crying and Ansari being the reason for Bella\u2019s presence in \nSingapore, it is entirely reasonable that Ansari, as Bella\u2019s boyfriend, would have \nfelt protective, responsible and guilty over Bella\u2019s situation. It would have been \nperfectly natural for Ansari to have asked SSGT Helmi to \u201clet her go\u201d. Ansari\u2019s \ntestimony that he begged SSGT Helmi to \u201cplease let Bella go. She is my \ngirlfriend. She does not know anything about these drugs\u201d is not something that \nI could readily dismiss as being untruthful or unlikely. I would expect emotions \nwithin Ansari to well up and his concern for Bella to be rather strong at that time \nafter their arrest. I would find it rather unusual if Ansari had made no attempt \nwhatsoever to seek the help of the recording officer to have Bella let off as \naccording to Ansari, Bella was not involved at all with the Drugs found in the \nCar. \n39 I find that the defence has managed to cast a reasonable doubt on the \nprosecution\u2019s case that Ansari had never raised any request in relation to letting \nBella go and therefore no response was in fact made by SSGT Helmi to that \nnon-existent request. Accordingly, I hold that the prosecution has not proved \nbeyond a reasonable doubt that the plea from Ansari to SSGT Helmi to let Bella \ngo and SSGT Helmi\u2019s Inducement were not made and that the \nContemporaneous Statements are therefore wholly voluntary. I rule that both \nContemporaneous Statements are inadmissible for the purposes of the main \ntrial.  \nThe Non-Contemporaneous Statements\nAnsari\u2019s Testimony\n40 In relation to the Non-Contemporaneous Statements recorded by SI \nFathli, Ansari testified that he had been induced by SI Fathli to give the \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Mohamed Ansari bin Mohamed Abdul Aziz[2019] SGHC 268\n19Non-Contemporaneous Statements to cooperate with CNB in order to let Bella \ngo.37 \n41 Sometime before Ansari met SI Fathli to give his 25 March 2016 \nStatement, Ansari had seen Bella along the corridor of the \u201c[pre\/post] medical \narea\u201d, in fear and feeling sad.38 This made him feel disappointed and aggrieved \nthat Bella was in that condition.39 \n42 On 25 March 2016 at or about 3.00am, Ansari was brought to Interview \nRoom 3 of Police Cantonment Complex Lock-up to give his 25 March 2016 \nStatement and he was handed over to SI Fathli. Ansari testified that when he \nentered the interview room, SI Fathli was the only person in the room.40 No \ninterpreter was present. Thereafter, Ansari testified that he had begged Fathli \n\u201cto let Bella go, Bella my girlfriend, because she\u2019s not involved in this.\u201d41 \nFathli had allegedly replied, \u201c[s]o far you have been [cooperative].

Since the time of the statement recording was around 3.00am in the \nmorning, Mr Farhan would not have been in the office at the time.56 SI Fathli \nwould have had to request for Mr Farhan\u2019s assistance before the statement \nrecording, and he would have been at home or outside the office.57 SI Fathli \nfinally admitted that he could not recall exactly whether he first met with Mr \nFarhan at the office to head down together to the lock-up, or met Mr Farhan at \nthe lock-up on 25 March 2016.58 SI Fathli testified that even if he had arrived at \n51 Transcript 28 August 2019 at p 47.\n52 Transcript 28 August 2019 at p 49.\n53 Transcript 28 August 2019 at p 49.\n54 Transcript 28 August 2019 at p 50.\n55 Transcript 28 August 2019 at p 51.\n56 Transcript 28 August 2019 at p 53.\n57 Transcript 28 August 2019 at p 53.\n58 Transcript 28 August 2019 at p 53.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Mohamed Ansari bin Mohamed Abdul Aziz[2019] SGHC 268\n22the lock-up before Mr Farhan, he would have waited for the interpreter before \nentering the interview room together to interview Ansari.59\nMr Farhan\u2019s Testimony\n48 Mr Farhan also testified that he could not remember who first arrived at \nthe interview room on 25 March 2016.60\nPolice Station Diary\n49 After the parties completed their submissions on the voir dire, I asked \nfor the lock-up diary (\u201cPolice Station Diary\u201d) to be produced in relation to the \nmovements of Ansari, SI Fathli and Mr Farhan at or about the time of the \ncommencement of the recording of the 25 March 2016 Statement. The Police \nStation Diary when produced only showed the movements of Ansari but not that \nof SI Fathli or Mr Farhan.61 Hence the Police Station Diary is not helpful in \ndetermining whether SI Fathli and Ansari could have been alone together in \nInterview Room 3 of Police Cantonment Complex Lock-up for a short period \nof time prior to the arrival of Mr Farhan for the recording of the 25 March 2016 \nStatement.    \nWhether SI Fathli\u2019s Inducement was in fact made\n50 After considering all the evidence, I find that the prosecution has not \nestablished beyond a reasonable doubt that SI Fathli\u2019s Inducement was not in \nfact made. \n59 Transcript 28 August 2019 at p 55.\n60 Transcript 28 August 2019 at p 41.\n61 Exhibit 1T-P7.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Mohamed Ansari bin Mohamed Abdul Aziz[2019] SGHC 268\n2351 From the testimonies of SI Fathli and Mr Farhan, I find that a reasonable \ndoubt exists as to whether or not SI Fathli and Ansari could have been alone in \nthe interview room for a short while prior to the statement recording on 25 \nMarch 2016. This was when the alleged SI Fathli\u2019s Inducement could have been \nmade. First, SI Fathli could not recall whether he and Mr Farhan had first met \nat the office before heading down to the lock-up, or met straight at the lock-up. \nSecond, neither Mr Farhan nor SI Fathli could confirm who first arrived at the \ninterview room on 25 March 2016. Third, this information was also not recorded \nin SI Fathli\u2019s investigation diary. Notably, SI Fathli testified that even if he had \narrived first at the lock-up, he would have waited for Mr Farhan before \ninterviewing Ansari together.62 However, I do not find SI Fathli\u2019s testimony \nreliable on this due to the vacillations in his testimony and his inability to recall \nclearly the events preceding the taking of the cautioned statement early in the \nmorning of 25 March 2016.\n52 SI Fathli\u2019s testimony is also not credible for the following reasons. First, \nSI Fathli\u2019s oscillating testimony regarding the events prior to the recording of \nthe 25 March 2016 statement is rather suspect. It was only after it was pointed \nout to him that Mr Farhan could not possibly have been on standby in the \ninterpreter\u2019s office at 3.00am in the morning that he admitted that he could not \nrecall whether or not he had met Mr Farhan before heading down to the lock-\nup. Second, I observe that SI Fathli did not genuinely apply his mind to recall \nthe events that occurred on 25 March 2016 before answering the questions on \nthe stand. There were many instances during SI Fathli\u2019s testimony whereby he \n62 Transcript 28 August 2019 at p 55.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Mohamed Ansari bin Mohamed Abdul Aziz[2019] SGHC 268\n24replied to questions with quick affirmative or negative answers in rapid \nsuccession as if he was merely going through the motions:63\nQ Did---in the recording of this statement, did you make \nany threat, inducement or promise to the accused? \nA No, Your Honour. \nQ And since you are fluent in the Malay language, did the \ninterpreter, Mr Farhan, make any threat, inducement or \npromise to the accused? \nA No, Your Honour. \nQ Was this statement recorded under oppressive \nconditions? \nA No, Your Honour. \nQ Did the accused raise any complaint whatsoever at any \npoint in time during the recording of this statement? \nA No, Your Honour. \nQ Did you detect if the accused was feeling uncomfortable \nor unwell at any point in time when you recorded this \nstatement? \nA No, Your Honour. \nQ Was this statement provided by the accused \nvoluntarily? \nA Yes, Your Honour. \nQ And did anything out of the ordinary happen in the \nrecording of this statement? \nA No, Your Honour. \n53 Third, it is SI Fathli\u2019s testimony that Ansari had not uttered the words \n\u201cPlease help Bella. She does not know about the drugs\u201d in Malay, or words to \nthat effect and SI Fathli denied uttering SI Fathli\u2019s Inducement.64 Given the \nsituation that Ansari was in, after seeing Bella in the corridor, it is more likely \n63 Transcript 27 August 2019 at pp 40\u201341.\n64 Transcript 28 August 2019 at p 47.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Mohamed Ansari bin Mohamed Abdul Aziz[2019] SGHC 268\n25than not for Ansari to have uttered those words to seek reprieve for Bella. If SI \nFathli\u2019s testimony were to be accepted, then it is rather odd that Ansari, given \nthe feelings he had at that time for Bella, never sought any help at all for his \ngirlfriend. It would be natural for Ansari to beg SI Fathli about his girlfriend \nafter seeing Bella in the corridor. I do note however that several days later, \nAnsari did not appear to be as protective of Bella as before because Ansari \nimplicated Bella in relation to the drugs found in the flat in two much later \nstatements (ie, the 31 March 2016 Statement and the 4 April 2016 Statement). \nNevertheless, I find that a reasonable doubt still exists as to whether SI Fathli\u2019s \nInducement was in fact made six and ten days earlier respectively on 25 March \n2016 before the statement was recorded and when both SI Fathli and Ansari \nwere allegedly alone in the interview room prior to the arrival of the interpreter. \nThis is primarily due to my assessment of Ansari\u2019s testimony being more \ncredible than that of SI Fathli\u2019s testimony, coupled with a reasonable possibility \nthat SI Fathli and Ansari were alone in the interview room for a short while \nbefore the 25 March 2016 Statement could have been recorded, whereby Ansari \nhad the opportunity to and did plead with SI Fathli about letting Bella off and \nSI Fathli\u2019s Inducement was then uttered. Accordingly, I find that the prosecution \nhas not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that SI Fathli\u2019s Inducement was not \nin fact made.\nThreat, Inducement or Promise\nObjective Limb\n54 I now turn to whether SI Fathli\u2019s Inducement operated as an inducement. \n55 In Cheng Heng Lee and another v Public Prosecutor [1998] 3 SLR(R) \n747 at [30], the Court of"}

He replied, \u201c[d]o not be afraid, I know the way.\u201d He thus continued driving on the CTE at a speed of approximately 80 to 90 km\/h, and abided by the road traffic rules. 2', '6\\u2003Having failed to exit at the Braddell Road exit, he was then supposed to exit the CTE at Exit 1A (Jalan Bukit Merah), being the exit closest to his intended destination at Depot Road. However, he did not do so. Instead, he continued onto the AYE, where he started to increase his driving speed to approximately 100 km\/h, making lane changes in the process so as to maintain his speed amidst moderate traffic. He deliberately slowed his car as he approached and passed a fixed speed camera located somewhere after Exit 8 (North Buona Vista Road) of the AYE. 3', '7\\u2003At various points along the way, his son asked him to exit the AYE, but he refused, alleging that his son did not trust him.

At this point, his car was on lane 2 of the two-lane Viaduct, and two oncoming vehicles had to filter to lane 1 to avoid him.

Specific deterrence is also \nnecessary to remind the accused person that the use of extreme violence out of \nanger and vengeance will not be condoned. Furthermore, retributive justice \nshould be given some weight, given that the accused person\u2019s assault threatened \nthe victim\u2019s life. It was entirely fortunate that the victim survived the ordeal. \nThe accused person had no part to play in the fortuitous outcome, and in fact \nshowed a blatant disregard for her well-being, as evinced by his conduct after \nthe offence (see Public Prosecutor v BPK [2018] 5 SLR 755 at [9]\u2013[12]).\n7 I have also considered the precedents cited by the Prosecution and the \nDefence. While the accused person\u2019s conduct was not as flagrant as the \noffenders in Kwong Kok Hing (pushing his ex-girlfriend in the path of an \noncoming train) or in Public Prosecutor v ACI [2009] SGHC 246 (attacking his \nmistress with a chopper and throwing her over the third floor parapet, causing \nher to fall to the ground floor), what was significant was that the accused person \nin this case was not suffering from a mental disorder that attenuated his \nculpability. While the defence sought to paint a picture that he was riddled by \nhis mental condition by referring to medical reports in 2006 and 2007, the \naccused person himself reported to the Institute of Mental Health (\u201cIMH\u201d) \npsychiatrist that he was not depressed prior to the alleged offence. The IMH \nreport, which was not contradicted by any other report, also showed that the \nadjustment disorder which he was diagnosed with had no causal or contributory \nlink to the alleged offence. \n8 Nonetheless, I recognise that the attack in this case was not as \naggravated as in the case of Public Prosecutor v BVS (Criminal Case No 42 of \n2018). In that case, the accused person was remanded for punching his ex-wife \nin the face. Upon his release on police bail, he sought his ex-wife out and slashed \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Govindarajan s\/o Thiruvengadam Uthirapathy[2019] SGHC 273\n4her repeatedly in broad daylight, causing her to suffer severe and potentially \npermanent injuries, as well as post-traumatic stress disorder. The accused \nperson\u2019s offence was committed while a personal protection order was in place. \nWhile giving some allowance for the accused person\u2019s mental condition, which \ndid not have a significant contributory link to his commission of the alleged \noffence, Justice Valerie Thean considered that a sentence of five years\u2019 \nimprisonment for the s 308 offence was appropriate.\n9 As explained, there was absolutely no causal or contributory link \nbetween the accused person\u2019s adjustment disorder and the offence in this case. \nThat the accused person suffers \u201cwith poor sleep, low mood and anxiety about \nhis case\u201d2 is also not a relevant mitigating factor. As held in Public Prosecutor \nv Koh Seah Wee and another [2012] 1 SLR 292 at [64], mental illness arising \nfrom incarceration is induced by an offender\u2019s own criminal acts, and no \nmitigating weight ought to be given. The same point was made in Mehra \nRadhika v Public Prosecutor [2015] 1 SLR 96. \n10 However, I do give some mitigating weight to the remorse that the \naccused person has shown in a letter of apology which he wrote to his wife after \nthe offence. The accused person\u2019s contrition is also corroborated by his \ndaughter. The court in Public Prosecutor v Wang Jian Bin [2011] SGHC 212 \nheld that some credit can be given for the accused person\u2019s remorse, which can \nbe reflected by a genuine apology. Furthermore, the accused person\u2019s wife has \nforgiven him. While forgiveness is usually not a mitigating factor, it is relevant \nif the \u201csentence imposed on the offender would aggravate the victim\u2019s distress\u201d \n(Public Prosecutor v UI [2008] 4 SLR(R) 500 at [57]; Ng Kean Meng Terence \n2 Mitigation p 43, para 3.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Govindarajan s\/o Thiruvengadam Uthirapathy[2019] SGHC 273\n5v Public Prosecutor [2017] 2 SLR 449 at [45(a)]). The victim has written that \nthe accused person\u2019s absence has caused her many sleepless nights, and that it \nhas affected her health and performance at work. I therefore find that some \nmitigating weight ought to be given to the fact that the victim has forgiven the \naccused person, and craves his return.\n11 The accused person\u2019s plea of guilty is also a relevant mitigating factor. \nIn this regard, I agree with the Prosecution that the weight to be given ought to \nbe confined to sparing the victim from the ordeal of having to give evidence and \nthe saving of costs and time in a trial. \n12 However, to be balanced against the above is the theft in dwelling \ncharge, which is to be taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. \nThis involves the accused person\u2019s act of stealing the victim\u2019s jewellery and \nwallet after he found her to be unconscious. I recognise that some aggravating \nweight has been given to the fact that he had behaved callously after the offence, \nas seen by his act of stealing the victim\u2019s possessions and thereafter making \nplans to leave the country. Nonetheless, given the distinct nature of the offence, \nI find that some aggravating weight ought to be given to the theft in dwelling \ncharge.\n13 In totality, having regard to the applicable sentencing principles and the \nrelevant precedents, as well as the aggravating and mitigating factors in this \ncase, I find that a sentence of three years\u2019 and three months\u2019 imprisonment is \nappropriate.\nVincent Hoong\nJudicial Commissioner  \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Govindarajan s\/o Thiruvengadam Uthirapathy[2019] SGHC 273\n6Wong Woon Kwong and Kong Kuek Foo (Attorney-General\u2019s Chambers) \nfor the Public Prosecutor;\nRaphael Louis (Ray Louis Law Corporation) \nfor the accused. \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)"}

In the course of the First Surgery, the superior petrosal vein (\u201cSPV\u201d) was sacrificed in order to access the tumour.

The former assesses the best motor response in terms of whether the patient understands what is being said and obeys commands, while the latter assesses motor movement of each limb. Hence, if a patient is hemiplegic but can use the limbs on the other side of the body to obey commands, that warrants a score of M6 for GCS 17', 'but will be reflected as zero power on one side of the body for motor score.', '15\\u2003The Plaintiff was then reviewed by DW15 Dr Lu together with DW5 Dr Yang Ming (\u201cDW5 Dr Yang\u201d) at 1730 hrs.

Her GCS score was recorded as 10 with motor power of 0 out of 5 for her right upper and lower limbs. The Plaintiff\u2019s blood pressure was 200\/90 mmHg, her heart rate was 55 bpm and she was experiencing laboured breathing. In other words, the Plaintiff was exhibiting signs of Cushing reflex, which is a nervous system response to critically elevated intracranial pressure. The symptoms for Cushing reflex are increased blood pressure, irregular breathing, and abnormally slow heart action (bradycardia). 20', 'Cushing reflex is very serious and will lead to death if untreated.', '17\\u2003An urgent computed tomography (\u201cCT\u201d) brain scan was carried out at 1829 hrs (\u201cthe First CT Scan\u201d). 21', 'The parties hotly contest the correct interpretation of the First CT Scan.

The First Defendant also informed the Plaintiff\u2019s family that regardless of whether the haematoma was surgically evacuated or conservatively managed, the Plaintiff would have an equally poor prognosis and thus be likely to end up in a PVS or comatose state. 23', '20\\u2003Following the events on 2 June 2014, the Plaintiff suffered irreversible brain damage and is now in a PVS.

In the Suit, Alphire\u2019s claims were broken down into five categories, namely Categories A, B, C, D, and E. While the applicant admitted collecting the sums in Categories A and B, he denied ever collecting the sums in Categories D and E.

IBRIS was a private company whose business concerned the production and extraction of vegetable oil and sugar, bio-fuels refining and bio-energy power generation. 3', 'This included PME, a biodiesel produced from palm oil. The PME purchased from the plaintiff was stored at the Banyan Terminal, where IBRIS had the exclusive use of several of the defendant\u2019s storage tanks pursuant to a service agreement. IBRIS was wound up following a creditors\u2019 voluntary liquidation on 14 August 2015. 4', '4\\u2003The current dispute arises from the clash between the legal effects of IBRIS\u2019s sale and purchase transaction with the plaintiff on the one hand, and on the other hand, IBRIS\u2019s long-term business arrangements with the defendant. Both the plaintiff and the defendant argue that they had the immediate right of possession of the PME cargo by reason of their respective written agreements with IBRIS. I shall therefore set out these agreements in some detail, beginning with the service agreement entered into between IBRIS and the defendant.', '5\\u2003In or around 25 August 2006, the defendant entered into an agreement with a biodiesel production company known as Natural Fuel Pte Ltd (\u201cNFPL\u201d) to \u201cdesign, construct, operate and maintain the storage tanks, pipelines and equipment (\u201cthe Dedicated Facilities\u201d) at the [Banyan] Terminal \u2026 for the dedicated use of [NFPL]\u201d. 5', 'It was agreed that there would be seven storage tanks with a combined storage capacity of 105,000 cubic metres.

Separately, the defendant decided to modify storage tanks which had been initially designed and constructed for NFPL so that they could be marketed to its petrochemical customers. 8', '7\\u2003In or around April 2010, whilst these modification works were still ongoing, IBRIS approached the defendant to lease about 50,000 cubic metres of storage tanks. IBRIS wanted these storage facilities for its exclusive use, in the same way that NFPL had, for the storage of its bio-fuel products and\/or raw materials. The defendant agreed to provide storage tanks and related facilities for IBRIS\u2019s dedicated use. On 19 July 2011, IBRIS entered into a service agreement with the defendant (the \u201cService Agreement\u201d). 9', 'The initial lease term was for the period from 1 August 2011 to 31 July 2016. 10', 'As per the Service Agreement, the following tanks were provided by the defendant for IBRIS\u2019s use:', '(a)\\u20031 x 20,000 cubic metres carbon steel tank (\u201cTank 1102\u201d);', '(b)\\u20031 x 20,000 cubic metres carbon steel tank (\u201cTank 1104\u201d);', '(c)\\u20031 x 10,000 cubic metres carbon steel tank (\u201cTank 1106\u201d); and', '(d)\\u20031 x 2,600 cubic metres carbon steel tank for the period of 1 August 2011 to 31 January 2012 and thereafter 1 x 5,000 cubic metres carbon steel tank for the period of 1 February 2012 to 31 July 2016.', '8\\u2003Pursuant to cl 19.1 and Appendix C of the Service Agreement, IBRIS was to pay the following fixed monthly fees which would be subject to yearly adjustments from 1 August 2012: 11', '(a)\\u2003S$578,600.00 per month from 1 August 2011 to 31 January 2012;', '(b)\\u2003S$605,000.00 per month from 1 February 2012 to 31 July 2012; and', '(c)\\u2003S$687,500.00 from 1 August 2012 to 31 July 2016.', 'IBRIS was also obliged to pay variable fees for electricity, internal transfer\/blending, tank cleaning and waste disposal. 12', 'Under cl 19.2.1, all sums were due and payable \u201cwithout demand and without deduction\u201d no later than 30 days after the date of the defendant\u2019s invoice. 13', '9\\u2003The Service Agreement specified the products to be stored in the tanks as \u201c[b]iodiesel, RBD Palm oil, rapeseed oil, soy bean oil and any other feedstocks that can be handled through the Facilities, meeting the Product Specifications\u201d. 14', 'PME is included within this description.', '10\\u2003For the purpose of these proceedings, there are three other important clauses in the Service Agreement which I should highlight. Under cl 20, the defendant was to have a right of lien and retention over IBRIS\u2019s products stored at the Banyan Terminal in the event that the security provided by IBRIS was either insufficient or invalid. Flowing from this, cl 22 provided for the defendant to have a right of disposal over IBRIS\u2019s products. This would allow the defendant to sell the stored products and use the sale proceeds to pay off any outstanding liabilities due to it. Lastly, pursuant to cl 39, IBRIS was required to provide two bank guarantees to the defendant. The first guarantee was to be provided before 1 August 2011 for the period from 1 August 2011 until 31 July 2012 for a sum of S$4,960,000. The second guarantee of S$5,625,000 was to be provided before 1 July 2012 for the period from 1 August 2012 until the expiration or termination of the Service Agreement. The relevant portions of these three clauses I have referred to are set out below: 15', '11\\u2003Cl 39.1 was subsequently varied by the parties, as recorded in a letter from the defendant to IBRIS dated 29 November 2012. 16', 'The relevant amendments related to the number of bank guarantees IBRIS was required to furnish, as well as the dates by which these guarantees were required to be furnished. Instead of providing one bank guarantee for the period from 1 August 2012 to the end of the Service Agreement (see cl 39.1(2)), under the new arrangement, IBRIS was required to furnish two guarantees. The first guarantee was required by 30 November 2012 for the period from 29 November 2012 to 28 November 2014 for a sum of S$5,625,000 (\u201cBG1\u201d). The second guarantee was required by 29 May 2014 for the period from 29 November 2014 to 31 July 2016 for a sum of S$5,625,000. The relevant portion of the letter is reproduced below:', '12\\u2003Pursuant to the Service Agreement, the defendant undertook further modifications of its facilities in line with IBRIS\u2019s requirements, namely, to modify the equipment relating to and pipelines connecting Tanks 1102, 1104 and 1106. 17', 'This was paid for by IBRIS. Mr Ravindran Visnathan, the defendant\u2019s operations manager at the Banyan Terminal, 18', 'provided the details of these modifications in his evidence. A pipeline, the \u201crundown line\u201d, 19', 'was installed to run between IBRIS\u2019s facility at 2 Banyan Place and the Banyan Terminal. The rundown line diverges into separate pipelines which connect to Tanks 1102, 1104 and 1106 respectively. The separate pipelines for removals from the tanks converge into another single pipeline, the \u201cfeed line\u201d, which runs from the Banyan Terminal to IBRIS\u2019s facility at 2 Banyan Place.', '13\\u2003This system of pipelines is known as a \u201ccommon system\u201d because the pipelines running to and from each of the three tanks connect to \u201ccommon pipelines\u201d which run between the facility at 2 Banyan Place and the Banyan Terminal. 20', 'For completeness, there is also a \u201cjetty line\u201d which connects from the jetties at the Banyan Terminal to the tanks. 21', '14\\u2003I now turn to the contractual relationship between IBRIS and the plaintiff. In or around August 2014, IBRIS\u2019s Vice-President (Commercial), Mr Choong Choon Yean (\u201cMr Choong\u201d), approached one of the plaintiff\u2019s commodity traders, Ms Jenn Elisah Lim (\u201cMs Lim\u201d), to determine the plaintiff\u2019s interest in a potential transaction for the sale and purchase of a cargo of PME. Ms Lim knew Mr Choong socially because he was the brother of an ex-colleague of hers. 22', 'IBRIS was intending to purchase a quantity of 3,000 metric tonnes of PME from Antara Commodities (M) Sdn Bhd (\u201cAntara\u201d) and Future Prelude Sdn Bhd (\u201cFuture Prelude\u201d). 23', 'IBRIS also had a ready buyer for this quantity of PME, British Petroleum Singapore Pte Ltd (\u201cBP\u201d). Antara and Future Prelude required IBRIS to make upfront payment whilst BP wanted to purchase the cargo from IBRIS on 30 days\u2019 credit terms. According to Mr Choong, IBRIS was facing cash flow problems and would be unable to pay Antara and Future Prelude prior to the PME\u2019s delivery. 24', 'It also could not afford to extend a month\u2019s credit to BP. 25', 'Mr Choong thus proposed to Ms Lim that the plaintiff purchase the PME from Antara and Future Prelude on immediate payment terms. The plaintiff would then sell the PME on credit terms to IBRIS and IBRIS would conduct a back-to-back sale with BP. 26', 'The plaintiff would make the margin between what it paid Antara and Future Prelude and its selling price to IBRIS.', '15\\u2003The plaintiff was agreeable to this proposal. Ms Lim considered this a \u201clow-risk transaction\u201d given that BP was the intended end-buyer. 27', 'In the initial stages of negotiation, the plaintiff had suggested that it could in fact be a joint party with IBRIS in selling the cargo directly to BP. 28', 'However, BP was not amenable to purchasing the PME directly from the plaintiff because BP\u2019s management had pre-approved IBRIS as the selling counter-party. 29', 'It was thus agreed that IBRIS would be the immediate purchaser of the PME from the plaintiff. IBRIS would then on-sell the cargo to BP. The plaintiff executed an agreement with Antara for the sale and purchase of 2,500 metric tonnes of PME (\u201cAntara Agreement\u201d), 30', 'paying US$815 per metric tonne. 31', 'This was dated 29 August 2014. The plaintiff remitted US$2,037,500 to Antara in payment for the PME cargo on 8 September 2014. 32', 'The Antara Agreement is governed by the terms and conditions established by The Palm Oil Refiners Association of Malaysia (\u201cPORAM\u201d). No agreement was entered into with Future Prelude as IBRIS later informed the plaintiff that the additional cargo was no longer required.', '16\\u2003IBRIS executed a sale and purchase agreement (the \u201cSale and Purchase Agreement\u201d) with the plaintiff, dated 29 August 2014, for the 2,500 metric tonnes of PME on the same terms as the Antara Agreement, save that IBRIS would pay the plaintiff US$832 per metric tonne. 33', 'Delivery of the PME was \u201cFOB ITT\u201d, which refers to \u201cfree on board\u201d, \u201cin-tank transfer\u201d. Hence, the plaintiff\u2019s obligation was to deliver the cargo into IBRIS\u2019s nominated tank. IBRIS would then have 30 days after the completion of delivery to make payment. 34', '17\\u2003Delivery of the PME by Antara began on 2 September 2014. This was organised between Antara and IBRIS and the plaintiff was not involved. After deliveries had commenced, IBRIS instructed Antara to reduce the contractual amount to 2,000 metric tonnes. 35', 'The plaintiff was only informed of this arrangement shortly before 15 October 2014, but it had no issue with this change in the quantity of the PME despite the terms of its agreements with Antara and IBRIS. The plaintiff wrote to Antara, seeking a refund of US$500,000. 36', 'Antara took the position that it was entitled to deduct goods and service tax amounts due on import and delay penalties from this figure. 37', 'Antara made payment of US$150,000 to the plaintiff on 20 October 2014. 38', 'This was followed by three further payments totalling US$117,494.96. 39', 'The plaintiff accepted this in satisfaction of the refund owed. A total quantity of 2,000.09 metric tonnes of PME (\u201cthe PME cargo\u201d) was delivered in 67 separate batches to 2 Banyan Place from 2 September to 17 October 2014. IBRIS then transferred the PME cargo to Tank 1102 at the Banyan Terminal by way of the \u201ccommon system\u201d. 40', 'This was done in 16 batches from 15 September to 17 October 2014. The material safety data sheet provided by IBRIS to the defendant in respect of the PME cargo stored in Tank 1102 listed the manufacturer of the PME as \u201cNatural Fuel Resources Pte. Ltd.\u201d, which was IBRIS\u2019s former name. 41', '18\\u2003When the plaintiff entered into the Antara Agreement and the Sale and Purchase Agreement, it anticipated that delivery of the PME cargo would be completed before October 2014. 42', 'This expectation did not materialise. This was a concern for the plaintiff as it was aware that it would only receive payment from IBRIS 30 days after completion of delivery of the PME cargo. The plaintiff was aware that a longer period of delivery would prolong its exposure to the risk of IBRIS failing to pay. These concerns were fuelled by the fact that the plaintiff had received indications from Mr Choong that IBRIS might have difficulty paying for the PME cargo. 43', 'In an apparent response to what Mr Choong had conveyed, the plaintiff issued an invoice dated 26 September 2014, on the instructions of Ms Lim, for 1,176.69 metric tonnes of PME which had been delivered as of that date. 44', 'The invoice specified the due date for payment as 2 October 2014. No payment was made by IBRIS.', '19\\u2003Subsequently, the plaintiff then proposed that it enter into a storage agreement with IBRIS (the \u201cStorage Agreement\u201d). 45', 'This would set out that IBRIS held the PME cargo on the plaintiff\u2019s behalf pending payment. Cl 8 of the Storage Agreement stated that title to the PME cargo \u201cshall not pass\u201d to IBRIS until payment for the same was received by the plaintiff. According to Ms Lim\u2019s evidence, this clause was included as a safeguard to confirm that the plaintiff and IBRIS were on the same page as to who had title to the PME cargo. 46', 'In full, cl 8 reads:', 'The Storage Agreement was executed on 15 October 2014, but backdated to 1 September 2014, the day before the first delivery of PME was made. The defendant\u2019s tank, Tank 1102, was identified in the Storage Agreement as the location where the PME cargo was being stored (see cl 4 of the Storage Agreement).', '20\\u2003It appears that, despite the reduction of quantity of PME delivered, the plaintiff and IBRIS still proceeded on the basis that IBRIS would pay for 2,500 metric tonnes of PME at US$832 per metric tonne, which worked out to US$2,080,000. 47', 'IBRIS apparently made payment of US$150,000 on 20 October 2014; this was in fact the refund sent by Antara (at [17]) but treated by IBRIS and the plaintiff as a payment by IBRIS towards the price under the Sale and Purchase Agreement. This meant that IBRIS still owed the plaintiff a sum of US$1,930,000 for the PME cargo that was due 30 days after delivery was completed on 17 October 2014. 48', 'It became clear to the plaintiff that IBRIS was facing financial difficulties and would not be able to make payment of what was due. This prompted the plaintiff to execute a repayment agreement (the \u201cRepayment Agreement\u201d) with IBRIS on 29 October 2014, setting out a repayment schedule for the outstanding sum. 49', 'Under the Repayment Agreement the parties also agreed to preserve their rights under the Storage Agreement. 50', 'IBRIS failed to comply with its obligations under the repayment schedule set out in the Repayment Agreement. 51', 'On 19 December 2014, the plaintiff issued a letter of demand through its solicitors.', '21\\u2003In the meantime, IBRIS was also in default of its obligations under the Service Agreement with the defendant. On 29 May 2014, IBRIS had failed to provide BG2 to the defendant in accordance with the varied cl 39 of the Service Agreement. This was in spite of several reminders sent by the defendant. 52', 'The defendant wrote on 21 July 2014 to remind IBRIS that BG2 was due. 53', 'On 25 July 2014, having received no response, the defendant sent another letter to give IBRIS notice of its intention to exercise its contractual right of lien on account of the failure to provide BG2 and also due to unpaid invoices. The text of the letter read: 54', '22\\u2003The defendant then was informed by IBRIS\u2019s representative, Mr Sohan Ojah-Maharaj (\u201cMr Sohan\u201d), that IBRIS was in the process of obtaining BG2. 55', 'Mr Sohan requested an extension of time until 31 August 2014 to provide BG2.

This referred to the possible exercise of the lien over the products stored with the defendant. 58', 'On 16 September 2014, the defendant made a demand to Standard Chartered Bank (\u201cSCB\u201d), the issuer of BG1, to draw on BG1 for the sum of S$1,464,774.63 in respect of unpaid invoices for July and August 2014. 59', 'This payment was made by SCB on 25 September 2014.', '24\\u2003On 8 October 2014, the defendant gave IBRIS notice of its intention to terminate the Service Agreement if IBRIS failed to furnish BG2 by 16 October 2014. 60', 'Once again, IBRIS failed to comply. On 17 October 2014, the defendant informed IBRIS that the Service Agreement would be terminated with effect from 29 November 2014. 61', 'On 18 October, the defendant wrote to SCB again, calling for payment of S$733,264.34 under BG1 for monthly fees payable under the Service Agreement for September 2014. 62', '25\\u2003On 20 October 2014, the defendant informed IBRIS of the estimated amount due to the defendant and demanded payment. 63', 'This estimated figure of S$16,151,272 consisted of S$1,467,532 for fees up to 28 November 2014 and S$14,683,740 for fees from 29 November 2014 to 31 July 2016. This latter sum took into account the fact that the termination of the Service Agreement would accelerate payments due from IBRIS up to 31 July 2016. The defendant also informed IBRIS that it would continue to exercise its right of lien and retention over all stored products, which would include the PME cargo, unless payment was made. SCB paid the defendant the claimed sum of S$733,264.34 on 24 October 2014.

Although it was held jointly in the \nthree names, the Plaintiff\u2019s evidence was that the monies in the account \ncame from him; and Aik Kheng confirmed that this was so.28    \n(b) Next, the balance of $331,438-13 was also paid by the Plaintiff \n\u2013 this time, via a cashier\u2019s order drawn on OCBC Account 1 on 20 June \n1991.29\n(c) Finally, in respect of the sum of $1,497-50 paid to the vendors\u2019 \nsolicitors M\/s JS Yeh & Co, this was paid by the Plaintiff via a cashier\u2019s \norder dated 20 June 1991 which he gave the 2nd Defendant cash to apply \nfor.30  \n14 It should be noted that while the 2nd Defendant conceded that the funds \nfor the purchase price of $370,000 had come from OCBC Account 1 (the bank \naccount held in the joint names of the Plaintiff, the 1st Defendant and Aik \nKheng), he denied that the funds in OCBC Account 1 came from the Plaintiff.  \n26 [51] of the Plaintiff\u2019s AEIC.\n27 [60(a)] of the Plaintiff\u2019s AEIC and exhibit NAS-16 at 1 JBAEIC 136-137.\n28 [19] of Aik Kheng\u2019s AEIC.\n29 [60(b)] of the Plaintiff\u2019s AEIC and exhibit NAS-17 at 1 JBAEIC 139-141.\n30 [60(c)] of the Plaintiff\u2019s AEIC and exhibit NAS-18 at 1 JBAEIC 143-144.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nNeo Aik Soo v Neo Geek Kuan[2019] SGHC 278\n8Instead, the 2nd Defendant advanced at trial a narrative which depicted their \nentire family \u2013 the Neo family \u2013 as having been engaged in making substantial \ninvestments in properties and other assets; and he claimed that the monies in \nOCBC Account 1 came from monies made by the Neo family in one of these \nproperty transactions.  I will elaborate on the 2nd Defendant\u2019s narrative when I \ndeal with the Defendants\u2019 evidence in the next section of these written grounds.  \n15 Although the Plaintiff was paying for the purchase of the Property and \nintended to hold it as his own investment, he decided to put the Property in the \n1st Defendant\u2019s name and to ask her to hold it on his behalf.  He decided on this \ncourse of action31 because he was concerned that should any of the high-value \ntrades he was carrying out as a broker go badly and expose him to personal \nliability, he should be able to \u201cshield\u201d some of his assets from creditors.  Being \nable to \u201cshield\u201d some of his assets from creditors was important because at that \npoint in time, he was financially responsible for supporting not just his wife and \nchildren but also his mother and siblings.  He asked the 1st Defendant to hold \nthe Property on trust for him because he trusted her, was close to her, and \nbelieved that her unmarried status would preclude the possibility of a spouse or \nchildren trying to lay claim to the Property.32  \n16 Once the sale was agreed, the Plaintiff left it to the 2nd Defendant to \narrange for all the documentation.  The Plaintiff trusted the 2nd Defendant and \ndid not check up on what he was doing.  He did not even ask to see the sale and \npurchase agreement (\u201cSPA\u201d).  It was only in the course of these proceedings \nthat he discovered that the 2nd Defendant had named himself as the purchaser of \n31 [53] of the Plaintiff\u2019s AEIC.\n32 See transcript of 23 May 2019 at p 131 line 23 to p 132 line 7.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nNeo Aik Soo v Neo Geek Kuan[2019] SGHC 278\n9the Property in the Sale and Purchase agreement (\u201cSPA\u201d).33  In cross-\nexamination, the Plaintiff agreed that the SPA was an important conveyancing \ndocument, but asserted that to him, the name in which a property was registered \nwould be more important than the SPA.34  Since he had arranged for the \nProperty to be registered in the 1st Defendant\u2019s name, and since he was also \ncollecting rent from the Property,35 he had not found it necessary to ask for a \ncopy of the SPA in the 27 years following the purchase.  \n17 Apart from helping the Plaintiff arrange for the purchase, the 2nd \nDefendant also assisted him in arranging for maintenance and repair works for \nthe Property \u2013 just as he had done for other properties owned by the Plaintiff.36  \nJust as he had done for the other properties, the 2nd Defendant would report to \nthe Plaintiff the various matters he was arranging for \u2013 such as engaging \ncontractors and applying for permits \u2013 and would also claim from the Plaintiff \nreimbursement of expenses incurred in making these arrangements.37  In this \nconnection, Aik Kheng too testified that he recalled a number of instances when \nthe Plaintiff instructed the 2nd Defendant to collect rent and do other things on \nhis behalf vis-\u00e0-vis the Property.  According to Aik Keng, the 2nd Defendant \nwould bring the Plaintiff various bills and invoices relating to the Property in \norder to seek reimbursement.

Most of the time the rental was \ncollected by the 2nd Defendant, who was accountable to the Plaintiff for the \namounts collected.40  The Plaintiff himself also collected the rental from time to \ntime.41\nOCBC Account 2\n19 In giving evidence of having paid for the renovations to the Property, \nthe Plaintiff stated that the funds for these renovations came from a bank \naccount referred to as \u201cOCBC Account 2\u201d, and that it was he who had given the \n2nd Defendant approval to draw the funds from this account for this purpose.  \nAccording to the Plaintiff, the background to the setting-up of OCBC Account \n2 and his use of the funds in it was as follows.\n20 Sometime in September or October 1993, the Plaintiff discovered that \nthe 2nd Defendant had obtained overdraft facilities from OCBC by using the \nProperty as security and getting the 1st Defendant to sign the necessary papers.42  \n38 [24(c)] of Aik Kheng\u2019s AEIC.\n39 See transcript of 21 May 2019 at p 102 line 2 to p 106 line 4.\n40 [54] of the Plaintiff\u2019s 4th affidavit dated 16 January 2018 at PBID 205.\n41 [83]-[86] of the Plaintiff\u2019s AEIC and exhibit NAS-25 at 1 JBAEIC 289-290.\n42 [70] of the Plaintiff\u2019s AEIC and exhibit NAS-21 at 1 JBAEIC 167-172 .\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nNeo Aik Soo v Neo Geek Kuan[2019] SGHC 278\n11This was OCBC account number 503-052730-001, which parties referred to \nduring the trial as OCBC Account 2.  The overdraft limit was $530,000.  The \n2nd Defendant had obtained the overdraft facilities in March 1993 and had been \nmaking use of them without the Plaintiff\u2019s knowledge and consent.43  Indeed, \nas at 31 August 1993, the overdraft limit had nearly been reached, with the \naccount showing a negative balance of -$$528,013-35.44  \n21 The Plaintiff testified that when he found out the Property had been used \nto secure these overdraft facilities, he confronted the 1st Defendant and warned \nher not to do it again without his consent.45  He was not that angry with her, \nthough, because she was his younger sister after all.  The Plaintiff also \nconfronted the 2nd Defendant who apologised, claiming that he had needed the \nmoney to buy art pieces and to invest in properties in China.46  Although the \nPlaintiff was upset, he also forgave the 2nd Defendant.  In any event, the Plaintiff \nhimself realised it would be useful having these overdraft facilities available.47  \nBy way of \u201ca compromise\u201d, therefore, he asked the 2nd Defendant to \u201cgive\u201d the \noverdraft account to him.48  The 2nd Defendant agreed; and from that point on \n(September or October 1993), OCBC Account 2 was treated as the Plaintiff\u2019s.  \n22 The Plaintiff explained that he did not bother to get the overdraft facility \ntransferred to his name because it would have taken time to re-apply for the \n43 [70] of the Plaintiff\u2019s AEIC.\n44 Exhibit NAS-22 at 1 JBAEIC 183.\n45 See transcript of 21 May 2019 at p 94 line 22 to p 95 line 14.\n46 [73] of the Plaintiff\u2019s AEIC.\n47 [74] of the Plaintiff\u2019s AEIC.\n48 [74] of the Plaintiff\u2019s AEIC.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nNeo Aik Soo v Neo Geek Kuan[2019] SGHC 278\n12bank\u2019s approval, and he would also have had to incur lawyers\u2019 fees.49  As far as \nhe was concerned, as OCBC Account 2 belonged to him from sometime in late \n1993 onwards, the 2nd Defendant would typically hand over to him the bank \nstatements for this account, as well as the cheque-books containing pre-signed \nblank cheques50 and pre-signed blank \u201ctransfer forms\u201d.51  Although the account \nremained in the 2nd Defendant\u2019s name, all monies deposited into and withdrawn \nfrom this account were treated as the Plaintiff\u2019s.52  According to the Plaintiff, \nthis could be seen from the fact \u2013 for example \u2013 that between October 1993 and \nJanuary 1994, he was the one making all the major deposits into OCBC Account \n2, amounting to a total sum of $3,231,243-22.53  By 11 January 1994, the \noverdraft balance had been reduced to -$25,631-42.54  \n23 The Plaintiff\u2019s assertion that he was given pre-signed blank cheques and \nblank \u201ctransfer forms\u201d was not refuted by the 2nd Defendant.

According to the 2nd Defendant, he had \ntaken a loan from these \u201cNeo family monies\u201d to pay for the purchase of the \nProperty.58  According to the 2nd Defendant, he had repaid this loan on 12 \nJanuary 1994 by transferring a sum of $400,000 from OCBC Account 2 (which \nhe claimed was his \u201cpersonal\u201d account) to OCBC Account 1.59  \n24 It will be seen that the 2nd Defendant\u2019s narrative was diametrically \nopposed to the Plaintiff\u2019s evidence.  Firstly, the Plaintiff rejected entirely the \nexistence of any \u201cNeo family monies\u201d or \u201cNeo family assets\u201d; he was adamant \nthat he had paid for the purchase of the Property with his own funds from OCBC \nAccount 1.  The transfer of $400,000 from OCBC Account 2 to OCBC Account \n1 on 12 January was a transfer which he had effected and which did not \nrepresent any repayment of loan by the 2nd Defendant.  He could not recall \nexactly what he had used the $400,000 for but was sure that it had been \u201c100 \nper cent\u2026 for own use, nothing to do with [the 2nd Defendant]\u201d.60  As he put it \nin his AEIC:61\nAik Siong [the 2nd Defendant] agrees that the alleged \n\u201crepayment in January 1994 was in fact a transfer which I \nmade from OCBC Account 2 to OCBC Account 1.

The 2nd Defendant, on the other hand, claimed that \nthe overdraft facilities in OCBC Account 2 were obtained by him to pay for \nthese renovations.62  \n26 Thirdly, as noted earlier, the rental for the Property was collected by the \nPlaintiff and the 2nd Defendant.  It was not disputed that most \u2013 if not all - of the \nrental collected from the tenant was deposited into OCBC Account 2.63  \nNaturally, the Plaintiff asserted that this was because OCBC Account 2 was \nreally his account, whereas the 2nd Defendant claimed that it was because OCBC \nAccount 2 was his.64   \n27 Finally, while the Plaintiff and the 2nd Defendant were agreed that \nproperty tax on the Property had been paid via GIRO from OCBC Account 2 at \nleast since 1996 (after the Property was tenanted out), they disagreed on whether \nthese GIRO payments represented payments by the Plaintiff or by the 2nd \nDefendant.65  Each claimed that the OCBC Account 2 was his and that he was \nthe one who had paid for property tax. \n62 [210] of the 2nd Defendant\u2019s AEIC.\n63 [83] of the Plaintiff\u2019s AEIC.\n64 [193] of the 2nd Defendant\u2019s AEIC.\n65 See transcript of 21 May 2019 at p 176 line 4 to p 180 line 3.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nNeo Aik Soo v Neo Geek Kuan[2019] SGHC 278\n15The extension of the lease in 2015\n28 Sometime in 2015, the Plaintiff began thinking of selling the Property.  \nHe told both the 1st and the 2nd Defendants about his intention to sell.66  Pursuant \nto that intention, he began negotiations in 2015 with the then tenant (one Ong \nGeok Hoo, \u201cOng\u201d) for a short 8-month extension to the lease and prepared two \nversions of a draft lease agreements.67  When he presented the second draft to \nOng, however, he was shocked to discover that around July \/ August 2015, the \n2nd Defendant had already gone behind his back to arrange for the 1st Defendant \nto extend Ong\u2019s lease for another two years from 1 August 2015 to 31 July 2017, \nand at a rental amount of $10,000 per month.  \n29 The Plaintiff confronted the 1st Defendant about this lease extension.  \nShe claimed that she had simply signed whatever the 2nd Defendant put before \nher.  The Plaintiff confronted the 2nd Defendant \u2013 who insisted it was a \nfavourable deal, despite the Plaintiff\u2019s view that the rent was too low.68  As their \nconversation went nowhere, the Plaintiff decided to drop the matter.  However, \nas he did not want to risk the 2nd Defendant giving Ong further, unauthorised \nextensions of the lease, he decided to revoke the 2nd Defendant\u2019s authority to \nact in matters concerning the Property.  To that end, on 2 August 2016, the \nPlaintiff wrote a letter for the 1st Defendant to sign and to send to Ong.69    In \ngist, this letter told Ong that \u201cwith immediate effect\u201d, the 2nd Defendant would \ncease to be the 1st Defendant\u2019s legal representative and would have no authority \nto act on her behalf in respect of the Property: instead, the Plaintiff would be the \n66 [79] of the Plaintiff\u2019s 2nd affidavit dated 4 December 2017 at PBID 102.\n67 [89] of the Plaintiff\u2019s AEIC.\n68 [92] of the Plaintiff\u2019s AEIC.\n69 [93]-[94] of the Plaintiff\u2019s AEIC and exhibit NAS-29 at 1 JBAEIC 318-319.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nNeo Aik Soo v Neo Geek Kuan[2019] SGHC 278\n161st Defendant\u2019s \u201conly authorised legal representative\u201d, with \u201cfull power of \nattorney\u201d to act on her behalf in all matters relating to the Property.   The letter \nalso informed Ong that all future rentals were to be paid to or collected by the \nPlaintiff.   \nThe meeting of 10 December 2016\n30 In light of the 2nd Defendant\u2019s conduct in granting Ong an unauthorised \ntwo-year extension of his lease, the Plaintiff decided around end-2016 to take \nsteps to ensure he would be able to sell the Property with vacant possession once \nOng\u2019s lease expired.  He consulted a lawyer \u2013 one Mr Lim Hin Chye of M\/s \nLim Hin Chye & Co (\u201cMr Lim\u201d); and having explained that he was the \nbeneficial owner of the Property whereas the 1st Defendant was its legal owner, \nhe sought Mr Lim\u2019s assistance in preparing \u201cwhatever documents\u2026necessary \nto facilitate [his] marketing and sale of the Property\u201d.70   An appointment was \nmade for 10 December 2016 (a Saturday) at Mr Lim\u2019s office.\n31 On the morning of 10 December 2016, the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant \nattended at Mr Lim\u2019s office, together with two of their siblings, Aik Kheng and \nGeok Huwe.  Mr Lim had prepared two documents.71  One was a Statutory \nDeclaration intended for signature by the 1st Defendant, in which she was to \ndeclare inter alia that she was the registered owner of the Property; that she had \nno beneficial interest in the Property and instead held it \u201cas a bare legal trustee \nin trust\u201d for the Plaintiff, who had paid the full purchase price of the Property; \nthat she undertook to transfer all right, title and interest in the Property to the \nPlaintiff and to account to him for all proceeds upon a sale; and that she also \n70 [112] of the Plaintiff\u2019s AEIC.\n71 [117] of the Plaintiff\u2019s AEIC and exhibit NAS-35 at 1 JBAEIC 337-342.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nNeo Aik Soo v Neo Geek Kuan[2019] SGHC 278\n17undertook to execute a Power of Attorney in order for him to handle the \nmanagement, sale or subletting of the Property as he deemed fit.  This Power of \nAttorney was the second document prepared by Mr Lim, in which the 1st \nDefendant appointed the Plaintiff as her Attorney to act on her behalf in (inter \nalia) the sale of the Property and the receipt of the consideration or purchase \nmonies for such sale.\n32 Mr Lim explained both documents to the 1st Defendant, who confirmed \nthat she understood what they were about.72  The 1st Defendant actively \nparticipated in the discussions with Mr Lim.  Indeed, according to Aik Kheng \nwho was also present at the discussions:73\n[The 1st Defendant] insisted that [the Plaintiff] should pay her \nS$30,000 on the spot, prior to her signing the documents, to \nreimburse her for income tax which she had been paying on the \nrental from the Property over the years.  \n[The Plaintiff] proposed to pay her S$100,000 after the sale of \nthe Property, which she agreed to.  However, she wanted to be \npaid S$30,000 immediately as well.  After a discussion, [the \nPlaintiff] agreed to pay her S$30,000 immediately and \nS$100,000 after the Property was sold.  I also remember [the \n1st Defendant] asking Mr Lim to record the S$30,000 to record \nthe S$100,000 payments in the draft.  \n[The 1st Defendant] made sure that [the Plaintiff] wrote out the \ncheque for S$30,000 and handed it to her at the end of the \nmeeting\u2026\n33 The Plaintiff did in fact issue the 1st Defendant a cheque for $30,000 at \nthe meeting in Mr Lim\u2019s office;74 and the payment of this sum in reimbursement \nof the 1st Defendant\u2019s payment of income tax on rental income on the Property \n72 [118] of the Plaintiff\u2019s AEIC; [55] of Aik Kheng\u2019s AEIC.\n73 [56]-[58] of Aik Kheng\u2019s AEIC.\n74 Exhibit NAS-31 at 1 JBAEIC 323.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nNeo Aik Soo v Neo Geek Kuan[2019] SGHC 278\n18was duly recorded in clause 6 of the Statutory Declaration signed by the 1st \nDefendant.75  It was also recorded in clause 5 of the Power of Attorney that the \nPlaintiff \u201cshall make a cheque of $100,000 in [the 1st Defendant\u2019s] sole name \nfrom the net sale proceeds as consideration for [her] taking care of the said \nProperty since the date of transfer of the said Property to [her]\u201d.76  \n34 After finalising these draft documents, Mr Lim also explained to the 1st \nDefendant that the Statutory Declaration was a sworn statement and that it was \nan offence to lie in a statutory declaration.77  The 1st Defendant was asked to \nread the Statutory Declaration to make sure its contents were true and accurate.  \nThe 1st Defendant did so and confirmed to Mr Lim the truth and accuracy of the \nStatutory Declaration.  She also read the Power of Attorney and confirmed that \neverything was in order before signing the documents.  \n35 This was not, however, the end of the matter, as the 1st Defendant then \nqueried the Plaintiff about \u201cwhat would happen if [he] mismanaged the sale of \nthe Property and somehow exposed her to any kind of liability\u201d.78  The Plaintiff \nreplied that he \u201cwould indemnify her for any claims or losses\u201d.  This led to Mr \nLim being asked to prepare a Deed of Indemnity.79  \n36 Upon both the 1st Defendant and the Plaintiff confirming that they were \nsatisfied with this draft Deed, Mr Lim brought then to the nearby office of one \nMr Raymond Ng (\u201cMr Ng\u201d), who was a Commissioner for Oaths.  Mr Ng read \n75 1 JBAEIC 337.\n76 1 JBAEIC 339.\n77 [121]-[122] of the Plaintiff\u2019s AEIC.\n78 [123] of the Plaintiff\u2019s AEIC.\n79 1 JBAEIC 343-344.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nNeo Aik Soo v Neo Geek Kuan[2019] SGHC 278\n19and explained each document to the 1st Defendant, who confirmed that she \nunderstood them and also understood the nature of a statutory declaration.80  \nBoth she and the Plaintiff then proceeded to sign the various documents, with \nMr Lim and Mr Ng also signing as witnesses for them on the Deed of Indemnity.   \nEvents post 10 December 2016\n37 Some two to three days after the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant had \nsigned the documents, the 2nd Defendant visited Mr Lim\u2019s office with \u201ca bundle \nof documents\u201d and \u201cclaimed that he was the owner of the Property\u201d.81  Mr Lim \ndid not know the 2nd Defendant at that time.  As the 2nd Defendant was not his \nclient and as he had been told on 10 December 2016 that the Plaintiff was the \nbeneficial owner of the Property, he declined to entertain the 2nd Defendant.  \nThe 2nd Defendant subsequently sent Mr Lim a letter on 13 December 2016, \ntitled \u201cLETTER OF PEOTEST\u201d (sic) in which he put forward what Mr Lim \ndescribed as \u201cwild allegations\u201d \u2013 in particular, that the \u201cwicked\u201d Plaintiff had \n\u201cthreaten violently wanted to hit [the 1st Defendant] and broken her two legs\u201d, \nthat the Plaintiff had also threatened to break his (the 2nd Defendant\u2019s) legs and \n\u201cwanted to set fire on [his] HDB flat\u201d, that the 1st Defendant had signed the \ndocuments in the lawyers\u2019 office \u201cunder heavy pressure\u201d, and that he (the 2nd \nDefendant) was \u201cthe actual owner of the said Property\u201d.82  Mr Lim did not \nrespond to the letter but instead forwarded a copy to the Plaintiff.\n38 On 16 December 2016, the 1st Defendant went alone to Mr Lim\u2019s office \nto collect the original Power of Attorney.

The Plaintiff \nwas unaware of this incident.  As far as he was concerned, the 1st Defendant had \nbeen cheery and happy throughout the meeting at the lawyers\u2019 offices.84  She \ndid not raise any complaints about the documents signed.  After collecting the \ndocuments from Mr Lim\u2019s office, she had handed them to the Plaintiff and \ncollected reimbursement from him of the fees paid for these documents, without \nmentioning any disagreement with their contents.85  \n39 On 23 December 2016, the 2nd Defendant lodged a caveat over the \nProperty.  This was done without the knowledge of the Plaintiff,86 who had been \nmarketing the Property as per his stated intention to sell it.  The Plaintiff only \nfound out about the caveat months later when a buyer he had found for the \nProperty in February 2017 brought the caveat to his attention before pulling out \nof the deal.  When the Plaintiff confronted the 2nd Defendant and asked him to \nremove the caveat, however, the latter did so \u2013 and even went back to helping \nthe Plaintiff with marketing the Property for sale.87  The Plaintiff thus believed \nthe issue to be closed.  He knew that both Defendants were aware not only of \nthe newspaper advertisements he had taken out regarding the sale of the \nProperty, but also of the fact that he had listed his mobile number as the phone \nnumber of the owner of the Property.

I \ndecided this issue in the 1st Defendant\u2019s favour, for the following reasons.\n99See transcript  of 5 July 2018 at  p 42 lines 30\u201332.\n100See transcript  of 5 July 2018 at  p 43 line 2.\n101See transcript  of 4 July 2018 at  p 69 line 13 to p 70 line 6.\nVersion No 3: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLim Seng Chye v  Pex International Pte Ltd [2019]  SGHC  28\n29The applicable standard of care\n56 As noted  earlier, the 1st Defendant\u2019s  selection of the 2nd Defendant as \nits contractor was based primarily  on the recommendation of a neighbouring \nland-owner at No. 25 Link  Road (Mdm Poh) who had arranged for similar  \nworks on her property, the visual inspections by Molly and Ross  of the similar \nworks done at No. 25, and their satisfaction  with the quality  of the 2nd \nDefendant\u2019s work in the two jobs undertaken at No. 17 prior  to the A&A  works. \n57 In considering  whether the above  sufficed as due care, the standard \nwhich I had to apply was \u201cthat  of a reasonable person in the circumstances of \nthe defendant\u201d (Ng Huat Seng (CA) at [73]). In other  words, I had to \u201chave \nregard to the particular circumstances of the present case,  including the \napplicable industry practices,  and then ascertain,  on this basis, what a reasonable \nperson in the [1st Defendant\u2019s]  position would have done\u201d (Ng Huat Seng (CA) \nat [73]).  \n58 As for industry practice, the CA in Ng Huat Seng (CA) has made it clear \n(at [74]) that:\n\u2026 Industry  standards and common practice have long been \nviewed as important, although not necessarily conclusive, \nfactors in ascertaining the appropriate  standard of care \u2026 \n[W]hen receiving evidence of what is alleged to be a common \nand approved practice  so as to assess the standard of care \nappropriate in a particular set of circumstances,  the court \nshould of course examine  the practice  against  considerations of \nlogic and common sense. This is only sensible  since negligent \nconduct does not cease to be so simply  on account of repetition \nand normalisation. In assessing the standard of care to be met, \ntherefore, it would be just as unwise to accept a common \nindustry practice  uncritically as it would be to simply ignore  it.\nVersion No 3: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLim Seng Chye v  Pex International Pte Ltd [2019]  SGHC  28\n30The relevance of expert evidence to  the court\u2019s assessment  \n59 The Plaintiff  and the 1st Defendant each called  its own expert  witness \nto give evidence of industry  standards  and practice. The experts\u2019  assistance  \nwould have been relevant  and useful  on the question of what the 1st Defendant \ncould reasonably have been expected to do prior to appointing the 2nd \nDefendant as contractor. Hong Cassley and others v GMP Securities Europe  \nLLP and another  [2015] EWHC 722 (QB) is an example of how expert evidence \nmay be used in such cases. This case concerned a claim in negligence brought  \nby the family  of the deceased Mr Cassley against his employers GMP Securities  \nEurope LLP (\u201cGMP\u201d) and another company  called Sundance  Resources  \nLimited (\u201cSundance\u201d).  Mr Cassley was on a chartered flight passing over a \nremote area of the Republic of Congo when the aircraft he was in crashed into \na hillside and killed all the persons on board. Mr Cassley was then on a business  \ntrip undertaken on behalf of GMP.  The aircraft had been  chartered from  a \nCongolese charter flight company (\u201cAero-Service\u201d) by Sundance: Mr Cassley  \nwas on that trip because GMP had been  trying to win the instruction to act as \nSundance\u2019s representative  in the raising  of finance for the latter\u2019s  mining  \nproject. The court found that the accident  occurred for a number of reasons \nmainly related to failings on the part of Aero-Service, including the lack of any \nformal safety procedures at Aero-Service, its lack of any facility  for flight  \nplanning and the absence  of any aeronautical charts on board  the aircraft. \nHaving also found that both GMP  and Sundance owed non-delegable  duties of \ncare to Mr Cassley, the court then considered what steps were reasonably \nrequired to be taken by GMP and Sundance  in the discharge of their respective \nduties of care \u2013 whether, for example, GMP and\/or Sundance should have  \nengaged an independent aviation consultant; and in this connection, the court \nhad regard to the evidence of the  expert  witnesses called by the parties. \nVersion No 3: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLim Seng Chye v  Pex International Pte Ltd [2019]  SGHC  28\n31Observations on  the expert evidence  provided in this case\n60 Unfortunately, however, I found that the instructions  provided to the \nPlaintiff\u2019s expert in the present case appeared to have confused and\/or conflated  \nthose issues which  he was qualified  to address as an expert witness with legal \nand factual issues which  were in contention  between the parties and meant for \nthe court\u2019s determination.  In addition to being asked  about \u201csome of the steps \nor considerations that [the 1st Defendant],  as an occupier, ought to have taken \ninto account in the selection of [the 2nd Defendant]  to carry out the A&A  works \nat No. 17\u201d, the Plaintiff\u2019s expert was also asked  to give his opinion, inter alia, \non whether,  \u201c[o]n the facts of this case \u2026 [the 1st Defendant] had discharged  \ntheir responsibilities  in the appointment  of [the 2nd Defendant]\u201d, and whether  \nthe 1st Defendant  had acted \u201cproperly or reasonably as occupiers in allowing  \n[the 2nd Defendant] to carry  out their work,  bearing in mind the need to obtain \nthe various  approvals  and before the necessary  approvals were given\u201d102. With  \nrespect, it should have been clear  to those instructing the Plaintiff\u2019s  expert that \nanswering these latter  two questions would have  required  him to take a position \non contentious  legal and factual issues which  he was not equipped to  address. \n61 This confusion as to the scope  of his role as expert might explain why \u2013 \nregrettably \u2013 the Plaintiff\u2019s expert  ended up making certain statements  in his \nexpert report about the 1st Defendant\u2019s \u201cobligations\u201d which were  unsupported  \nby any evidence or authority  and which seemed at times so broad as to be \nunhelpful. Thus, for example, he stated  that \u201c[a]s an occupier of No. 17, [the 1st \nDefendant] having decided to carry out A&A works  on their premises had a \nbroad range of responsibilities. This included ensuring that the A&A  works are \nonly authorised and\/or  permitted after all necessary measures were taken to \n102para 2.2 at p 4 of the Plaintiff\u2019s expert\u2019s report (exhibit  GW-2 of George  Wall\u2019s AEIC) \n(\u201cMr Wall\u2019s  expert  report\u201d).\nVersion No 3: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLim Seng Chye v  Pex International Pte Ltd [2019]  SGHC  28\n32ensure the works would be safely carried out to ensure it was safe and not \nhazardous for its visitors or employees, while the A&A  works was  going  on\u201d103.\n He did not cite the basis for this somewhat  expansive statement of general  \nprinciple, and taken  at face value,  this appeared  to be a statement  that the 1st \nDefendant had a non-delegable duty to ensure that the A&A works at No. 17 \nwere carried out safely \u2013 which was precisely one of the key legal issues  in \ncontention.  \n62 The Plaintiff\u2019s expert also put forward in his report what  appeared to be \nfactual assumptions and\/or factual conclusions, without  explaining the basis for \nthose assumptions or conclusions. For example, he stated that \u201c[g]iven  that [the \n1st Defendant]  is a supplier of materials to the construction industry\u201d, it would \nbe \u201creasonable to assume that [the 1st Defendant] has a certain level of \nfamiliarity with the construction industry and that [the 1st Defendant] should \nnot be considered a lay person\u201d104. In the first place, the only evidence in the \nreport which could  conceivably lead to this conclusion was the reference  to the \nblurb on the 1st Defendant\u2019s website  regarding its \u201cmission\u201d \u2013 a website on \nwhich the information  was, on his own admission, \u201climited\u201d105. He did not \nexplain how the 1st Defendant\u2019s business of supplying electrical conduits would \nrender it \u201creasonable to assume\u201d a \u201ccertain level  of familiarity with the \nconstruction industry\u201d. Nor, for that matter, did he explain what that \u201ccertain \nlevel of familiarity\u201d entailed, beyond the brief statement in cross-examination  \nthat this would involve awareness  \u201cof the general requirements  and \nresponsibilities within the construction  industry\u201d106.

Rather  confusingly, the \nsteps he listed as being \u201cexpected\u201d of the 1st Defendant  did not all appear to \nrelate directly  to the selection of contractors107. Of the one item which  did \nappear to relate directly to the selection of contractors (\u201cTo go out to tender to \na number of vendors, possibly three, to ensure that their planned  scope  of work  \nwas adequate and that they were obtaining  a competitive price\u201d), there was no \nexplanation provided either in the expert report  or in cross-examination108 as to \nwhy it should be reasonable to expect  a company in the 1st Defendant\u2019s  \ncircumstances to \u201cgo out to tender to a number  of vendors\u201d. There was also no \nexplanation as to how a tender exercise  would have revealed that the 2nd \nDefendant\u2019s \u201cplanned scope of work\u201d was not \u201cadequate\u201d and thereby led to it \nnot being selected as contractor.  As for ensuring \u201ca competitive price\u201d,  I did \nnot see how this was in any way relevant to the issue of whether the 1st \nDefendant had  exercised reasonable  care in the selection process.\n64 Much  was also made by the Plaintiff\u2019s expert of the fact that the 1st \nDefendant had obtained ISO 9001 certification. Indeed, he postulated that the \n1st Defendant \u201cshould  have carried out a more rigorous investigation of [the \n2nd Defendant\u2019s] experience and ability, especially  in relation to whether [the \n2nd Defendant]  was competent to carry out the planned A&A  work\u201d109.

The Appellant was 16 years old, and had been staying at his paternal grandfather\u2019s flat at the material time.', '6\\u2003Prior to 18 November 2016, the Appellant had been asking his father (hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe victim\u201d) for money and claimed that he needed $3,000 to pay for car rides as part of his work to survey Uber drivers on behalf of Grab. However, the victim only gave the Appellant $1,000 and transferred the same into his account.', '7\\u2003After spending the $1,000, the Appellant requested for the remainder of $2,000 from the victim. The victim refused this request multiple times.', '8\\u2003On 29 November 2016, the Appellant requested the amount of $2,000 from his grandparents but was also rejected by them. The Appellant subsequently decided to confront the victim at the victim\u2019s flat. He brought a steak knife with a blade length of approximately 8 cm, which he took from his grandfather\u2019s flat.', '', '9\\u2003At approximately 8.30am, the victim was leaving for work when he saw the Appellant hiding beside a shoe cabinet outside his flat. The Appellant demanded to know why the victim refused to give him the money as requested and started to push and shove the victim. The victim warned the Appellant not to touch him, and told him that he would not give any money to him. The Appellant continued to push and shove the victim, which caused the latter to drop his key pouch. The Appellant then threw the victim\u2019s key pouch towards a drain along the corridor.', '10\\u2003At approximately 8.31am, as the victim was picking up his key pouch from the drain, the Appellant took the steak knife and stabbed the victim\u2019s head continuously for about two to three times. This caused the victim to fall to the ground, upon which the Appellant grabbed the victim\u2019s key pouch.', '11\\u2003The victim screamed for help and tried to stop the Appellant from using his key to enter the flat, but the Appellant continued to stab and slash the victim. He also punched and kicked the victim multiple times.', '12\\u2003The victim continued to scream for help and tried to fend off the Appellant\u2019s blows with his hands. The Appellant shoved a pink recyclable bag into the victim\u2019s mouth multiple times. The Appellant also yanked a haversack that the victim was carrying, which pulled on the victim\u2019s body and shook him around the floor.', '13\\u2003The victim attempted to reach for his phone to call his wife, but the Appellant tried to pull it out of his hand. During the struggle for the victim\u2019s phone, while the victim was lying prone on the floor, the Appellant kicked him in his face.', '14\\u2003At this point, the victim\u2019s neighbours noticed the struggle between the Appellant and the victim, and called the police.', '15\\u2003When the paramedics arrived at the incident location at approximately 8.45am, the victim was found lying on the floor, near a pool of blood. The victim was then conveyed to and admitted to Tan Tock Seng Hospital.', '16\\u2003As a result of the attack, the victim sustained the following injuries:', '(a)\\u2003multiple stab wounds and lacerations over the scalp;', '(b)\\u2003left metacarpal dorsum stab wound that required wound exploration, debridement and closure by a hand surgeon;', '(c)\\u2003two facial lacerations; and', '(d)\\u2003scalp haematomas.', '17\\u2003The victim was discharged from hospital three days later, on 1 December 2016, and was given 20 days of hospitalisation leave. A report dated 10 August 2017 also clarified that injuries sustained by the victim would result in scarring and potential disfigurement.', '18\\u2003As a result of the incident, the victim\u2019s family (excluding the Appellant) decided to move out of the victim\u2019s flat for approximately two months as they were concerned for their safety.', '19\\u2003Following the incident, the Appellant was arrested and referred to the Institute of Mental Health (\u201cIMH\u201d) for psychiatric evaluation. An IMH report dated 19 December 2016 was subsequently adduced.', '20\\u2003The Appellant was eventually charged on 25 May 2018, and indicated, on 8 August 2018, that he was claiming trial as he had acted in self-defence. He was unrepresented at the time and he had applied to the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme (\u201cCLAS\u201d) for a lawyer to be assigned to assist him. He went through the Criminal Case Disclosure Conference process and took trial dates which were scheduled for 27 February to 1 March 2019.', '21\\u2003When counsel was assigned by CLAS in January 2019 to represent the Appellant, his instructions remained to claim trial. On 27 February 2019, the first day of trial, the Appellant indicated that he wanted to plead guilty. The plea of guilt was recorded on the same day.', '22\\u2003In order to determine the appropriate sentence to be imposed, the DJ called for both a Reformative Training Suitability Report (\u201cRT Report\u201d) and a Probation Suitability Report (\u201cProbation Report\u201d). The Appellant was found to be suitable for RT, but not probation.', '23\\u2003In sentencing the Appellant to RT for the minimum period of six months, the DJ made five key findings:', '(a)\\u2003First, that rehabilitation would remain the dominant sentencing consideration in the sentencing matrix, but that considerations of deterrence were present given several aggravating factors (see the GD at [36]).', '(b)\\u2003Second, that the Appellant did not demonstrate genuine remorse (see the GD at [45]).', '(c)\\u2003Third, that the Appellant possessed risk factors which supported a sentence of RT (see the GD at [48], [59]).', '(d)\\u2003Fourth, that there was a lack of effective familial supervision over the Appellant (see the GD at [52]).', '(e)\\u2003Fifth, that RT should be imposed instead of probation (see the GD at [60]).', '24\\u2003Dissatisfied with the DJ\u2019s decision, the Appellant brought the present appeal.'"}

Although it was initially agreed that this meeting took place on 15 October 2013, the defendants changed their case partway through trial after Goh was called as a witness. This was when Lee gave his evidence to say that the yacht meeting took place on 14 October 2013 instead. The defendants subsequently maintained in closing submissions that the yacht meeting occurred on 14 October 2013. My finding as regards this issue is set out below at [62] et seq.', '10\\u2003Following the meeting, preparations were made for an investment by Wang and Sun in AMP.

Further discussions followed. A meeting was held on 8 September 2014 in Guangzhou (\u201cthe 8 September 2014 meeting\u201d), which was attended by Wang, Sun, Goh, Michelle, Lee, Loh and Lin. At this meeting, Wang and Sun agreed in principle to purchase the angel investors\u2019 shares in AMP from Goh at S$450 per share. 26', 'There was also an in-principle agreement for a joint venture to be operated in China. 27', '19\\u2003The terms of what was to become the 2nd MOU were the subject of various emails and discussions in the days following the 8 September 2014 meeting. 28', 'At the same time, Goh (through Lee) was concurrently in discussions with Reis on the sale of the angel investors\u2019 shares to him. As it turned out, Goh intended to buy the shares of the angel investors first, and then onsell them to Wang at a higher price than what he would have to pay for the angel investors\u2019 shares. 29', '20\\u2003On 15 September 2014, Reis proposed selling 56,049 shares in AMP held by the angel investors to Goh at S$350 per share. 30', 'On the other hand, the price Goh offered to Wang was S$450 per share. The fact that Goh would be making a profit of S$100 per share from purchasing AMP shares from the angel investors and onselling them to Wang was not disclosed to Wang. 31', '21\\u2003The 2nd MOU was eventually signed on or around 25 September 2014.

It was eventually agreed that the shares were to be transferred and paid for in three tranches comprising 24,000, 22,000 and 4,000 shares respectively. 33', 'Only the first two tranches were completed, with Wang taking the position on 10 March 2015 that she did not have to proceed with the purchase of the third tranche of 4,000 shares due to various breaches by Goh of the 1st MOU (as amended). 34', '23\\u2003The relevant provisions of the English version of the 2nd MOU are reproduced below at Annex C. Wang also provided an English translation of the Mandarin version of the 2nd MOU, but I do not include it in Annex C as the terms of the 2nd MOU are not in dispute and the parties\u2019 cases do not turn on any difference between the English and Mandarin versions of the 2nd MOU.'"}

The parties do not agree on whether the 2015 dealing gave rise to a concluded contract.', '36\\u2003In any event, all three of the parties\u2019 previous dealings bear a remarkable similarity to the fourth dealing on 29 March 2017 which is the subject-matter of this action. All four of these dealings had the following features in common. The plaintiff sends an email to the defendant proposing key terms for a sale of coal by the plaintiff to the defendant. These key terms include the quantity of coal, the type of vessel, the laycan, the loading port, the loading rate, the quality of coal, the price, a price adjustment formula, the time of payment and the demurrage. The plaintiff\u2019s proposal does not nominate the independent surveyor but instead indicates expressly that the independent surveyor is to be agreed. 36', 'The defendant receives and considers the plaintiff\u2019s proposal and responds by making a counter-proposal on certain terms. The parties reach agreement on the terms. The plaintiff emails to the defendant a draft contract in its own standard form for comment and approval. The draft incorporates the terms agreed in the preceding email exchange but also includes other terms which have been neither discussed nor agreed.', '37\\u2003In two of these four dealings, the parties went on to execute a formal contract and to perform without dispute. 37', 'These two dealings were the 19 July 2016 contract and the 15 March 2017 contract.', '38\\u2003In the other two of these four dealings, the parties did not execute a formal contract and did not perform. One of these two dealings, of course, is the 29 March 2017 dealing, which forms the subject matter of this action. For the 29 March 2017 dealing, as I have set out above, the plaintiff executed the formal contract but the defendant did not. For the 2015 dealing, the defendant executed the formal contract dated 7 September 2015 and the plaintiff did not. Instead, the plaintiff informed the defendant that it was unable to meet the agreed laycan due to its supplier\u2019s difficulties. 38', 'The plaintiff proposed a new laycan which would delay delivery by 15 days. 39', 'The defendant did not accept the new laycan. Instead, the defendant informed the plaintiff that the plaintiff\u2019s delay had caused the defendant to be in breach of its own delivery obligations to its own buyer and that the defendant\u2019s legal team would \u201cfollow [up on] the issue\u201d with the plaintiff soon. 40', 'The defendant did not, however, follow up with any legal action against the plaintiff on the 2015 dealing. 41', '39\\u2003It will be appreciated that the parties\u2019 positions in the 2015 dealing were inverted as compared to their position in the 29 March 2017 dealing. In the 2015 dealing, it was the plaintiff who failed to execute the draft formal contract and the defendant who insisted that the parties had nevertheless entered into a concluded contract.', '40\\u2003Each party seeks to persuade me that the 2015 dealing supports the position which they take in this action on the contractual effect of the business confirmation emails. This is a point that I examine in greater detail from [86] below.'"}

The sole director and shareholder of the Complainant was Mr Lim Ser Kuo David (\u201cMr Lim\u201d).', '9\\u2003The Vendors of the Property were Mr Senthil Kumaran s\/o Narayanasamy (\u201cMr Senthil\u201d), Ms Kamala d\/o P Pariasamy, and Mr Narayanasamy s\/o Muthu (collectively, \u201cthe Vendors\u201d). At the material time, the Vendors were represented by a real estate agent, Mr Shoban s\/o Kumarian (\u201cMr Shoban\u201d), also known to some of the parties as Mr Roy.', '10\\u2003The Respondent is a partner at S K Kumar Law Practice (\u201cthe Respondent\u2019s firm\u201d). It was not clear when the Respondent began acting for the Vendors. In his AEIC, the Respondent claimed that he was only instructed by the Vendors \u201c[o]n or about 10 April 2017\u201d. However, we note that the warrant to act (\u201cthe Warrant to Act\u201d) was signed by the Respondent, and dated 9 April 2017. There was, unfortunately, no explanation for this incongruity.', '11\\u2003In his AEIC, Mr Lim stated that he was introduced to the Vendors by a banker from Maybank Singapore, Mr Adrian Yeo (\u201cMr Yeo\u201d). On 8 April 2017, Mr Lim (on behalf of the Complainant) made an offer to purchase the Property for $5.8m.', '12\\u2003Two versions of the option to purchase were adduced into evidence. An initial option to purchase (\u201cthe Initial Option\u201d) stated that the $58,000 together with an additional $232,000 would constitute the deposit for the purchase. Under the Initial Option, the $232,000 was to be payable to the Respondent\u2019s firm\u2019s conveyancing account. The Initial Option was signed by the Vendors on 9 April 2017, but it appeared that the Initial Option was never provided to the Complainant as Mr Lim claimed he had never seen the Initial Option.', '13\\u2003The evidence was not entirely clear as to who had prepared the Initial Option. In his AEIC, Mr Senthil stated that it was Mr Shoban who had prepared the Initial Option. There was no confirmation by Mr Shoban or the Respondent that it was, in fact, Mr Shoban who had prepared the Initial Option. We note that both a letter from Mr Shoban (which the Respondent forwarded to the Inquiry Panel) and the Respondent\u2019s AEIC was silent on that specific issue.', '14\\u2003It appeared that a revised option to purchase (\u201cthe Revised Option\u201d) was then drafted. The Revised Option was critical to these disciplinary proceedings. Under the Revised Option, a larger sum of $522,000 was instead to be made payable to the Respondent\u2019s firm\u2019s client account. The Revised Option was also dated 9 April 2017. Again, the record of proceedings did not make clear who had effected the amendments from the Initial Option to the Revised Option. The Respondent claimed that Mr Shoban had \u201crenegotiated the terms in the Option\u201d, but he did not state whether it was Mr Shoban or he who had actually amended the Option. We note that Mr Shoban\u2019s letter to the Law Society\u2019s Inquiry Panel (\u201cInquiry Panel\u201d) did not go as far as to state that he had made the amendments to the Initial Option.', '15\\u2003Mr Shoban claimed that the Revised Option was signed by the Vendors on 11 April 2017 and accepted by the Vendors. Conversely, Mr Lim stated that he had received the Revised Option on 10 April 2017 and on that same day, he made payment of $58,000 directly to Mr Senthil of the Vendors. This $58,000 represented 1% of the total purchase price.', '16\\u2003After the Revised Option was executed and the $58,000 transferred to the Vendors, Mr Lim needed more time to raise funds for the purchase of the Property. On 5 May 2017, Mr Lim wrote to the Vendors (with Mr Yeo assisting him in the drafting) to request for an extension of time to exercise the Revised Option.', '17\\u2003Matters were further complicated as it appeared that Matthew Chiong Partnership (\u201cMCP\u201d) purportedly began representing the Complainant from at least 19 May 2017. We say \u201cpurportedly\u201d as Mr Lim claimed that at the material time he was not aware that MCP was, in fact, acting for the Complainant. During this time, Mr Lim (on behalf of the Complainant) had only liaised with Mr Yeo. We note that despite their role in these events, neither Mr Yeo nor anyone from MCP had filed affidavits explaining their version of events.', '18\\u2003We leave to one side, for the moment, the questions over MCP\u2019s warrant to act on the Complainant\u2019s behalf. On 19 May 2017, MCP sent the Respondent a request to extend the Revised Option\u2019s expiry date to 31 May 2017. According to Mr Senthil, the Respondent was only provided a copy of the Initial Option on 19 May 2017. According to Mr Lim, on 22 May 2017, Mr Yeo communicated (from the Vendors) to him that the Complainant was to pay $100,000 to the Vendors as part of the balance of the deposit money of $522,000.', '19\\u2003On 22 May 2017, a cheque for $100,000 was made out by the Complainant to the client account of the Respondent\u2019s firm. The Respondent accepted that his firm had received the cheque, which cleared on 23 May 2017. The $100,000 was then placed in the client account of the Respondent\u2019s firm and the Respondent then disbursed the sums directly to the Vendors. Mr Lim stated that following the payment of the $100,000, he was informed by Mr Yeo that the Option\u2019s expiry date had been extended to 31 May 2017.', '20\\u2003The record of proceedings did not show what had been communicated between the parties to obtain the extension of the expiry date of the Revised Option. The Respondent relied on Mr Senthil\u2019s claim that there was an agreement for the 9% remainder of the Option Monies (the \u201c$522,000\u201d) to be released to the Vendors directly instead of the usual deposit in the conveyancing account. Conversely, although Mr Lim accepted that there was a mutual agreement to extend the expiry date of the Revised Option to 31 May 2017, he categorically denied that the Complainant had agreed to have the remainder of the Option Monies released to the Vendors before completion.', '21\\u2003From his letter to the Inquiry Panel, it did not appear that Mr Shoban had personal knowledge of this alleged agreement to extend the Revised Option. All he could say was that he \u201cunder[stood] that the amended option was not exercised on 5th May 2017 but was extended to 20th May 2017 as per the [Complainant\u2019s] request\u201d.', '22\\u2003On 31 May 2017, a legal executive from MCP emailed the Respondent to indicate that the Complainant would be exercising the Option on that day. However, MCP requested the Respondent to confirm that the 10% deposit should be made in favour of the Respondent\u2019s firm\u2019s conveyancing account instead of its client account. In his reply to MCP, the Respondent did not acknowledge the need to place the monies into the conveyancing account. Instead, the Respondent claimed that there was an agreement to release the $522,000 to the Vendors.', '23\\u2003Also on 31 May 2017, Mr Matthew Chiong (\u201cMr Chiong\u201d) of MCP called Mr Lim to inform him that one of the Vendors was facing bankruptcy proceedings. Mr Lim was extremely surprised by this information as he was not previously informed by Mr Shoban, the Respondent, or any of the Vendors of this. Mr Chiong then told Mr Lim that MCP would no longer be acting for the Complainant. As we had alluded to at [17] earlier, Mr Lim also claimed this was the first time that he had come to know that MCP had been acting for the Complainant in the transaction.', '24\\u2003We note that if Mr Lim\u2019s version of events were true, there was no explanation in these proceedings from Mr Chiong as to how MCP came to act for the Complainant without Mr Lim\u2019s knowledge, nor was there an explanation as to why the bankruptcy searches had not been carried out earlier, or why MCP had allowed the monies to be made payable to the Respondent\u2019s firm\u2019s client account instead of its conveyancing account.', '25\\u2003In any event, Mr Lim approached Edmond Pereira Law Corporation (\u201cEPLC\u201d) to represent the Complainant. EPLC informed Mr Lim that their own searches revealed that it was not just one of the Vendors, but all three Vendors who faced pending bankruptcy applications.', '26\\u2003From 1 June 2017 to 17 June 2017, EPLC wrote to the Respondent repeatedly to request that the $100,000 be placed in his firm\u2019s conveyancing account. EPLC also indicated that unless the Vendors could successfully discharge the bankruptcy applications, the Complainant would not be willing to proceed with the purchase, and would seek a refund of the $100,000. EPLC indicated to the Respondent that if the Vendors were subsequently adjudged bankrupts, s 77(1) of the Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20, 2009 Rev Ed) could render void the transactions entered into after the bankruptcy applications were made against them.

These proceedings resulted in a judgment in favour of the appellant being handed down on 9 March 2017 holding that the Management Contract was void and unenforceable (\u201cthe Maldivian Judgment\u201d). 8', 'The result of this was that the Maldivian courts eventually declined to enforce the Awards on 22 June 2017. 9', 'The respondent has since appealed against the Maldivian Judgment.', '5\\u2003In July 2017, the respondent applied for and obtained leave to enforce the Awards in Singapore. 10', 'A judgment was granted on 13 April 2018 (\u201cthe Singapore Judgment\u201d), which is the basis of the EJD proceedings at issue in the present appeal before me.', '6\\u2003Separately, in July 2017, the respondent made a separate application in Originating Summons No 845 of 2017 (\u201cOS 845\u201d) for injunctive and declaratory relief. A limited anti-suit injunction was granted, preventing the appellant from relying on the Maldivian Judgment.

The appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal, which set aside the anti-suit injunction, but upheld the declarations awarded: see Hilton International Manage (Maldives) Pvt Ltd v Sun Travels & Tours Pvt Ltd [2019] 1 SLR 732 (\u201cSun Travels (CA)\u201d).', '7\\u2003In respect of the EJD proceedings, a number of questions in the form of a questionnaire were directed to one Mr Ahmed Siyam Mohamed (\u201cMr Siyam\u201d), an officer of the appellant, in preparation of the oral examination of Mr Siyam. Objections were taken in respect of some of the questions which can be summarised into two categories: (a) questions relating to assets of corporate entities related to the appellant or Mr Siyam; and (b) questions relating to assets of the appellant located in the Maldives. At a hearing held on 19 February 2019, Assistant Registrar Jacqueline Lee (\u201cAR Lee\u201d) decided that questions falling in category (a) would not be allowed in so far as they did not pertain to assets owned by the appellant available to satisfy the Singapore Judgment. As for category (b), AR Lee found that the respondent was entitled to ask questions concerning the assets of the appellant located in the Maldives. This was notwithstanding the fact that the Awards could not have been enforced in the Maldives at the time. The appellant appealed against this aspect of AR Lee\u2019s decision.', '8\\u2003AR Lee found that there was no inconsistency with comity. The result of the EJD proceedings is only that Mr Siyam provides information which might or might not result in the actual execution of the Singapore Judgment. Whether the respondent would ultimately be able to enforce the Awards in the Maldives was a matter to be considered at a later date in light of the fact that the appeal against the Maldivian Judgment was still pending. AR Lee also relied on the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in PT Bakrie Investindo v Global Distressed Alpha Fund I Ltd Partnership [2013] 4 SLR 1116 (\u201cPT Bakrie\u201d) for the proposition that an EJD order can be obtained even where enforcement of the judgment has been stayed.

Mr Bhasi was also located in India at the material time. 9', '10\\u2003The plaintiffs\u2019 claims against the various defendants arose in connection with various Indian merchanting trade transactions involving Bunge and AOPL. I briefly set out, in general terms, merchanting trade (as explained by the parties), before describing the specific arrangement between Bunge and AOPL.', '11\\u2003Merchanting trade involves the sale and purchase of cargo by an Indian entity (ie, the merchanting trader). The Indian merchanting trader would purchase cargo from an offshore seller, before on-selling that same cargo to an offshore buyer. 10', 'While such trades involve physical cargo (the Bunge merchanting trades utilised cargo in transit between the load port and discharge port), the cargo does not physically enter India. Instead, transfer of ownership is effected by exchanging photocopies of the bills of lading pertaining to the cargo. In this way, the Indian merchanting trader (ie, the intermediary) takes ownership of the cargo on paper, but never actually takes delivery of the physical cargo before it is on-sold to the offshore buyer. 11', '12\\u2003This flow of goods comes accompanied by a flow of funds (the consideration for the cargo) in the opposite direction from the offshore buyer to the offshore seller, also routed through India. In the interim, the funds routed to India could be placed in interest-bearing Indian bank accounts. According to AOPL and Mr Bhasi, the true purpose of the Bunge-AOPL merchanting trade transactions was \u201cinterest arbitrage\u201d. At the time, Indian banks were offering some of the highest interest rates. In other words, the putative trade flows were being used as a cover for routing and parking funds in Indian banks. 12', 'On their part, the plaintiffs accepted that these arrangements meant that interest could be earned, but denied that the merchanting trades were entered into for purposes of interest arbitrage. 13', '13\\u2003The merchanting trade between Bunge and AOPL involved flows of goods and funds between four entities. As was previously mentioned, GRIPT and BSA were both Bunge entities, and were the offshore seller and offshore buyer respectively. AOPL was the Indian merchanting trader and either Arabian Commodities FZE (\u201cACF\u201d) or Tracon General Trading LLC (\u201cTracon\u201d) would act as the offshore intermediary. ACF and Tracon were companies registered in the United Arab Emirates (\u201cUAE\u201d).', '14\\u2003Under this merchanting trade structure (henceforth referred to as the \u201cBunge-AOPL merchanting trade structure\u201d), the four entities would enter into a series of contracts 14', 'with each other for the sale and purchase of cargo. These contracts would be: (a) between GRIPT and AOPL; (b) between AOPL and ACF; and (c) between ACF and BSA. 15', '15\\u2003As was mentioned, the flow of goods was effected by exchanging photocopies of the relevant bills of lading. Title to the cargo therefore passed from GRIPT to AOPL, then to ACF, and finally to BSA. 16', '16\\u2003As for the flow of funds, this was set in motion by BSA. BSA would make an advance payment against the cargo it was to receive from ACF. In practice, BSA would advance the funds directly to AOPL, instead of paying ACF. 17', '17\\u2003As between AOPL and GRIPT, payment was made by letters of credit, with maturity of six months, issued by AOPL\u2019s bank for the benefit of GRIPT. 18', 'The aforementioned advance paid into AOPL\u2019s bank account by BSA provided the margin for the issuance of the letter of credit in GRIPT\u2019s favour. 19', 'Upon issuance of the letter of credit, GRIPT could negotiate the letter of credit with a negotiating bank and thereby receive the funds immediately. However, AOPL\u2019s bank would not have to make payment to the negotiating bank until the maturity of the letter of credit some six months after its issuance. In the meantime, the funds remained in AOPL\u2019s account, and interest could be earned on this deposit. 20', '18\\u2003According to AOPL, these funds were placed in one-year fixed deposits. Sometime after late 2014, the funds were placed in two-year fixed deposits instead, so as to secure higher interest rates. 21', 'However, this arrangement came with a particular risk. As mentioned, the letters of credit matured at the six-month mark, after which the funds would have to be paid out to the negotiating bank, potentially breaking the fixed deposit. Should the fixed deposit be broken, AOPL would not only lose the benefit of the interest that would otherwise have been earned on the deposit, but would also be liable to penalties for early termination of the deposit. 22', 'Importantly, the maturity date of the letter of credit could not simply be extended as Indian regulations required that each merchanting trade take no longer than nine months to complete and therefore did not permit a letter of credit to remain open longer than that period. 23', 'Therefore, in order that the fixed deposit would not be broken, AOPL had to ensure that sufficient funds stood in its account to maintain the deposit.', '19\\u2003In practice, AOPL was able to maintain sufficient funds by engaging in multiple trades at a time. In essence, so long as BSA advanced fresh funds (pursuant to a second or subsequent trade) to AOPL before the maturity of the first letter of credit, AOPL would be able to maintain its fixed deposit. AOPL refers to these subsequent trades as \u201croll-over trades\u201d. Since the letters of credit issued by AOPL were kept open for six months, three roll-over trades would be engaged in in the course of maintaining a two-year fixed deposit. 24', '20\\u2003Besides the use of letters of credit, another key feature of the payment arrangements between AOPL and GRIPT was the use of irrevocable payment undertakings (\u201cIPU\u201d). Pursuant to each AOPL-GRIPT contract, AOPL was obliged to procure from its bank an IPU in GRIPT\u2019s favour. Essentially, the IPU was an undertaking given by AOPL\u2019s bank that it would, upon receipt of the funds advanced by BSA, (a) issue a letter of credit to the benefit of GRIPT; and (b) failing which, remit the funds advanced by BSA to GRIPT. The IPUs were procured by AOPL by way of a \u201cmandate letter\u201d sent by AOPL to its bank, SBI, instructing it to issue the IPU. 25', '21\\u2003The foregoing description pertains to ordinary merchanting transactions between Bunge and AOPL. The transactions which formed the subject matter of the present proceedings were, by contrast, \u201cdeferred mandate trades\u201d. Deferred mandate trades differed from ordinary trades in one main respect. In an ordinary trade, AOPL would be required to procure the issuance of a letter of credit within days (usually two days) of receipt of the advance from BSA. In deferred mandate trades, AOPL was given a much longer time to procure the issuance of the letter of credit. In the period between when the advance from BSA was received and when the letter of credit had to be issued, AOPL would have use of the funds advanced. 26', '22\\u2003The parties disagree as to the purpose of these deferred trades. AOPL claims that the deferred mandate trades were a means of financing AOPL. According to AOPL, BSA had capital but was having trouble procuring trade flows to justify the injection of funds to AOPL. The deferred mandate trades thereby allowed AOPL to then enter into the necessary roll-over trades with third parties. 27', 'There were two methods by which AOPL would repay Bunge: 28', '(a)\\u2003Onshore repayment: the repayment of funds to Bunge would be received by GRIPT from AOPL. AOPL would procure a letter of credit issued in favour of GRIPT, and GRIPT (as a Bunge entity) would receive repayment through the letter of credit (much like in an ordinary merchanting trade).', '(b)\\u2003Offshore repayment: the repayment of funds to Bunge would be effected by a payment from AOPL to ACF, and ACF would then make repayment to BSA.', '23\\u2003On their part, the plaintiffs deny that they had a shortage of trade flows, and that the deferred mandate trades were a means of financing AOPL\u2019s procurement of alternative trade flows from third parties. 29', 'Rather, the deferred mandate trades were much like ordinary trades in that they were simply intended to be performed. There is therefore no issue of repayment; AOPL would receive title to the goods from GRIPT, and GRIPT would receive payment for the goods via the letter of credit issued by AOPL\u2019s bank. 30', '24\\u2003I turn now to the specific trades which form the subject of Suit 438.', '25\\u2003The key Bunge-AOPL deferred mandate trade was that entered into on 14 September 2015. 31', 'It comprised three back-to-back contracts between GRIPT, AOPL, ACF and BSA, taking the contractual form as depicted above in Figure 1. I refer to these contracts collectively as \u201cthe September 2015 Bunge-AOPL String Sale contracts\u201d, which pertain to the \u201c17172A Trade\u201d.

The Company was thus incorporated on 2 October 1993. Ozaki, along with a nominee appointed by Tan\u2019s elder brother, were equal shareholders and the Company\u2019s only two directors. The Company has at all material times been involved in the wholesale and distribution of Ozak\u2019s linear motion bearings. 3', '6\\u2003As Ozaki has been based in Japan since the Company\u2019s incorporation, Tan was hired as an employee to oversee the daily operations of the Company in Singapore. 4', 'There was no written employment contract between Tan and the Company.

Tan claims that his intention in incorporating Shafttech was to support the Company\u2019s need for complementary products. 7', 'Tan\u2019s involvement with Shafttech and his allegedly wrongful acts (see [9] below) form the basis of the application in OS 1027\/2018.

The second to sixth plaintiffs each own jack-up oil rigs (\u201cthe rigs\u201d) which bear the names set out in parentheses above. 2', 'Henceforth, the second to sixth plaintiffs will be referred to collectively as \u201cthe rig owners\u201d and all six plaintiffs would be referred to collectively as \u201cthe plaintiffs\u201d.', '10\\u2003The rigs were either built in Singapore or purchased from Singapore-based shipbuilders. After their construction or purchase, they were all relocated to Mexico and are currently lying in Mexican waters. The rigs are collectively worth approximately between US$1.2 and US$1.6bn. The rigs are estimated by the defendants to be worth between US$1.4 and US$1.6bn. 3', 'At the Injunction Application, the plaintiffs estimated that the rigs are worth US$1.2bn. 4', '11\\u2003The first defendant Integradora De Servicios Petroleros Oro Negro SAPI De CV (\u201cIntegradora\u201d) is the sole shareholder of Oro Negro. It is a company incorporated in Mexico and is in the business of providing integrated and diversified oilfield services. The first defendant\u2019s operations are centred in Mexico and its sole client is the Mexican state-owned petroleum company known as Petroleos Mexicanos (\u201cPemex\u201d). The first defendant provides services to Pemex through its Mexican-incorporated subsidiary Perforadora Oro Negro S de RL de CV (\u201cPerforadora\u201d). 5', '12\\u2003The relationship between the various companies and Pemex is best seen in the diagram below: 6', '', '13\\u2003The second and third defendants were directors of the plaintiffs until their removal in September 2017 (see [26]). 7', 'It suffices to note at this juncture that the validity of their removal was disputed by the parties.', '14\\u2003Perforadora entered into bareboat charters for the rigs with the rig owners which Perforadora then chartered to Pemex (\u201cthe Pemex Charters\u201d). The Pemex Charters are governed by Mexican law and any disputes arising therefrom are subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the City of Mexico. 8', 'Pemex assigned the charters in turn to its subsidiary Pemex Perforacion y Servicios. 9', '15\\u2003Apart from the fact that they own the rigs built in or bought from Singapore, the rig owners do not carry on any business activities in Singapore. In fact, their only source of income is from Mexico where they are tax residents. Similarly, the rig owners\u2019 parent company Oro Negro does not conduct any business activities in Singapore. Its directors and management are located in Mexico. It pays taxes in Mexico on the income it receives from the charters of the rigs through the rig owners. 10', '16\\u2003Currently, there are court proceedings in Mexico between Oro Negro and\/or its subsidiaries and the bondholders of Oro Negro. There are also court proceedings in the United States (\u201cUS\u201d) which however have been stayed. 11', '17\\u2003By an agreement dated 24 January 2014 (\u201cthe Bond Agreement\u201d) that is subject to Norwegian law, Oro Negro issued bonds to various bondholders. The parties to the Bond Agreement are Oro Negro and Nordic Trustees ASA (\u201cNordic Trustee\u201d). The latter acts on behalf of the bondholders. Events of default are set out under cl 15.1 of the Bond Agreement. In particular, under cl 15.1(g)(i), it would constitute an event of default if the issuer (ie, Oro Negro), parent (ie, the first defendant), charterer (ie, Perforadora) or the rig owners take \u201cany corporate action, legal proceedings or other procedure [sic] step\u201d in relation to, inter alia, winding up, dissolution, administration or reorganisation (\u201cthe Event of Default clause\u201d). 12', '18\\u2003Events in 2017 caused a liquidity crunch for the first defendant, Perforadora and Oro Negro. Between March and August 2017, Pemex insisted that permanent amendments be made to the terms of the Pemex Charters (\u201cthe Pemex Proposal\u201d). The Pemex Proposal would have drastically reduced the charter hire and in turn the revenue of Oro Negro and the rig owners. The Pemex Proposal included suspending the operations of the Laurus and Primus rigs and drastically reducing the daily hire rates of the other three rigs. In addition, Pemex refused to allow Perforadora to invoice Pemex for the services provided by the rigs from and after April 2017. 13', '19\\u2003Income from the Pemex Charters are paid into trust accounts with banks in Mexico (\u201cthe Mexican Trust Accounts\u201d). The Mexican Trust Accounts are operated by a Mexican subsidiary of Deutsche Bank (\u201cDB Mexico\u201d) as trustee in accordance with the terms of a trust agreement dated 21 June 2016 (\u201cthe Trust Agreement\u201d). The Trust Agreement is governed by Mexican law with Mexican courts having exclusive jurisdiction. 14', 'The monies in the Mexican Trust Accounts are distributed to the plaintiffs in accordance with the provisions of the Trust Agreement and the Bond Agreement in [17]. Perforadora first receives payment to fund its operating expenses and overheads. Thereafter, the rig owners receive their charter hire and the balance is paid to Oro Negro. 15', '20\\u2003Consequently, any reduction in the charter hire would adversely affect the plaintiffs. If Oro Negro defaults under the Bond Agreement, Nordic Trustee would be entitled to pursue the rig owners under various security documents. 16', '21\\u2003Unless the Bond Agreement was restructured to take into account the Pemex Proposal, Oro Negro would not have sufficient cash to fund its operations and would eventually default on its repayment obligations under the Bond Agreement. 17', 'However, Oro Negro\u2019s attempts to put forward a debt restructuring proposal through the first defendant were thwarted by obstacles placed in its path by an ad hoc group of bondholders (\u201cthe Ad Hoc Group\u201d). Their demands would have meant draining Oro Negro\u2019s cash flow and resulted in its defaulting under the Bond Agreement. 18', '22\\u2003The first defendant surmised that the Ad Hoc Group had an ulterior motive for its actions. The first defendant suspected that the Ad Hoc Group was secretly negotiating with Pemex for new charters for the rigs. The Ad Hoc Group would benefit greatly from a creditor seizure of the rigs. This was particularly so as a member of the Ad Hoc Group is an investment fund which is closely related to one of the first defendant\u2019s competitors, Seamex Ltd (\u201cSeamex\u201d). Seamex has extensive experience contracting with Pemex, having already leased five rigs to the latter with the most favourable commercial terms amongst any of Pemex\u2019s vendors. 19', '23\\u2003Nordic Trustee\u2019s subsequent letter to the bondholders dated 5 October 2017 proved that the first defendant\u2019s suspicions were correct. In that letter, Nordic Trustee stated that the Ad Hoc Group continued to support the Pemex Proposal and that the \u201cAd Hoc Group, together with certain other Bondholders, [would] continue to work with their advisors and [Nordic Trustee] to establish a viable platform for the ongoing, uninterrupted operation of the Rigs\u201d. 20', '24\\u2003Fearing the worse, the first defendant decided to take pre-emptive steps to protect the plaintiffs. On 31 August 2017, the rig owners via the second and third defendants as their directors, issued the POAs to members of Guerra including Mendez. The POAs granted the Guerra lawyers various powers including a \u201cgeneral power of attorney for litigation and collections\u201d. The POAs were signed by the second and third defendants in Mexico. 21', '25\\u2003On 11 September 2017, Perforadora voluntarily filed a petition with the Second District Court in Civil Matters in Mexico City (\u201cthe Second District Court\u201d) to place itself in concurso mercantil (insolvency proceedings) (\u201cthe First Concurso Petition\u201d). The First Concurso Petition enabled Perforadora to obtain interim protection from its creditors while it negotiated with them to restructure its debt obligations. 22', '26\\u2003In response to the First Concurso Petition, Nordic Trustee sent a letter to Oro Negro dated 25 September 2017, asserting that the filing of the First Concurso Petition amounted to an event of default under the Bond Agreement (\u201cthe Event of Default Notice\u201d). Nordic Trustee then proceeded to seize control of the plaintiffs. It purportedly removed the second and third defendants as directors from the boards of directors of the plaintiffs (with effect from 25 September 2017). It appointed two new directors in their place, namely Roger Arnold Hancock (\u201cHancock\u201d) and Roger Alan Bartlett (\u201cBartlett\u201d). Nordic Trustee further blocked the bank accounts of the plaintiffs that had been charged to Nordic Trustee under two account charges dated 29 April 2016 and 7 June 2017. 23', '27\\u2003According to the first affidavit of the plaintiffs\u2019 director Noel Blair Hunter Cochrane (\u201cCochrane\u201d), Nordic Trustee was able to take the steps in [26] because the second and third defendants had pre-executed resignation letters and resolutions that authorised the appointment as directors of persons nominated by Nordic Trustee while the first defendant had executed a blank share transfer form. 24', '28\\u2003On 29 September 2017, Mendez filed a petition with the Second District Court for the first defendant and the plaintiffs to be placed in concurso proceedings (\u201cthe Second Concurso Petition\u201d). In his affidavit dated 27 June 2018, Mendez explained that the Second Concurso Petition was a response to Nordic Trustee\u2019s Event of Default Notice in [26]. Although the rig owners had sufficient funds for Oro Negro to meet its payment obligations in October 2017, Guerra filed the Second Concurso Petition because he feared Nordic Trustee and the Ad Hoc Group would continue to take disruptive measures that could irreparably harm the first defendant and the plaintiffs. 25', '29\\u2003On 3 October 2017, Pemex purportedly terminated the Pemex Charters in respect of the Primus, Laurus, Fortius and Decus rigs on the basis that Pemex had entered into leases with other vendors for rigs at a daily hire rate of US$116,300 which Perforadora was apparently not agreeable to. As for the Impetus rig, Pemex cited the First Concurso Petition as the reason for its termination. 26', '30\\u2003The defendants asserted that Pemex had no basis to terminate the charters of the rig owners. Perforadora had in fact agreed to the Pemex Proposal which would reduce the daily charter hire of the four rigs to US$116,300 as Pemex demanded. As for the Impetus rig charter, Pemex\u2019s termination based on the First Concurso Petition was a violation of Mexican law and public policy. 27', 'Indeed, the Mexican court subsequently ruled on 29 December 2017 that a provision in the Pemex Charters, which is similar to the Event of Default clause in the Bond Agreement and which Pemex relied on to terminate the Pemex Charters, was invalid for contravening Mexican law. 28', '31\\u2003On 4 October 2017, Nordic Trustee exercised its powers under a share charge (\u201cthe Share Charge\u201d) and using the executed blank transfer form in [27], transferred the first defendant\u2019s shares in Oro Negro to another company controlled by Nordic Trustee, namely OND Pte Ltd (\u201cOND\u201d). From that date, Nordic Trustee and\/or OND purported to seize control and ownership of the rig owners even though the outstanding sums due under the Bond Agreement approximated US$916m whereas the rigs were worth US$1.2\u2013$1.6bn. 29', '32\\u2003On 5 October 2017, the Mexican court issued various injunctions as part of the proceedings in the First Concurso Petition including (a) ordering Nordic Trustee to refrain from declaring any enforcement act regarding the assets and rights of Perforadora relating to the Trust Agreement in [19]; and (b) to refrain from affecting, modifying or terminating the Trust Agreement. On 11 October 2017, the Mexican court expanded the injunctions issued on 5 October 2017. 30', '33\\u2003On or about 9 October 2017, the newly appointed directors Hancock and Bartlett passed resolutions purportedly to rescind on the plaintiffs\u2019 behalf \u201cany and all authorities including any Powers of Attorney given by the Company to any person previously\u201d (\u201cthe 9 October Resolution\u201d). 31', '34\\u2003On 17 October 2017, a lawyer Manuel Ruiz de Chavez Gutierrez de Velasco (\u201cChavez\u201d), who was appointed by Hancock and Bartlett, filed a motion to withdraw the Second Concurso Petition (\u201cthe Withdrawal Motion\u201d). 32', '35\\u2003On 25 October 2017, Mendez filed an \u201cinefficiency and punitive damages claim\u201d (\u201cthe Inefficiency Motion\u201d) in the Second District Court on behalf of the plaintiffs, Perforadora and the first defendant. In the Inefficiency Motion, Mendez sought the following reliefs:', '(a)\\u2003a declaration that the Event of Default Notice (in [26]) issued by Nordic Trustee and its various other acts following the Event of Default Notice were illegal, ineffective and have no effect; and', '(b)\\u2003punitive damages in the amount of US$916,100,517, that being the then unpaid principal on the bonds. 33', '36\\u2003On 31 October 2017, the Mexican court accepted the Second Concurso Petition of the plaintiffs and added it to the pending First Concurso Petition of Perforadora. 34', 'Henceforth, the two concurso petitions will be referred to collectively as \u201cthe joint Concurso Proceedings\u201d.', '37\\u2003According to the defendants, Nordic Trustee and\/or OND took steps to prevent the Inefficiency Motion from being heard by refusing to accept personal service at their address in Mexico. That necessitated Mendez having to apply for an order from the Mexican court to effect service on Nordic Trustee by newspaper advertisements (\u201cthe Nordic Trustee Service Order\u201d). 35', '38\\u2003On 14 February 2018, Chavez filed a motion in the Mexican court asking for the Nordic Trustee Service Order to be revoked. He had also filed another motion on 10 November 2017 to revoke the Inefficiency Motion on behalf of OND (\u201cthe Revocation Motion\u201d). 36', '39\\u2003On 27 November 2017, Chavez filed an application seeking a declaration that Mendez lacked the authority to represent the plaintiffs (\u201cthe Lack of Standing Motion\u201d). 37', '40\\u2003On 20 December 2017, the second defendant was notified by DB Mexico that a sum of US$23m was transferred from the plaintiffs\u2019 account to the bank account of Nordic Trustee. The second defendant was not aware of the reasons for the transfer. In his first affidavit dated 30 May 2018 (\u201cthe Second Defendant\u2019s First Affidavit\u201d) for the Setting Aside Application, the second defendant deposed that the transfer was a breach of the injunctions granted by the Mexican court on 5 October 2017 (at [32]) which essentially prohibited Nordic Trustee from obtaining funds from the Mexican Trust Accounts. 38', '41\\u2003On 20 March 2018, the Mexican court allowed OND\u2019s Revocation Motion on purely procedural grounds because:', '(a)\\u2003The Inefficiency Motion was defective as it raised issues that ought not to be resolved by an ancillary action; and', '(b)\\u2003The Mexican court had no jurisdiction to deal with the validity of the clauses in the Bond Agreement as the same was governed by Norwegian law.', 'The Mexican court did not deal with any of the substantive Mexican law issues raised in the Inefficiency Motion. 39', '42\\u2003On 2 May 2018, the Mexico court found that the POAs that the plaintiffs had granted to Mendez on 31 August 2017 had not been validly revoked or rescinded. On that basis, the Mexican court dismissed the Withdrawal Motion in [34]. At the same time, the Mexican court also dismissed the Second Concurso Petition on the ground that the approval of the plaintiffs\u2019 independent director, Cochrane, had to be obtained in order for the plaintiffs to be placed in concurso proceedings. This approval was not obtained. Mendez has filed a motion known as an amparo to request the Mexican court to reconsider the dismissal (\u201cthe Amparo Motion\u201d). 40', '43\\u2003In the US, the rig owners under the control of the bondholders commenced proceedings against Perforadora on 15 March 2018 in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York seeking the return of the rigs following the alleged termination of the Pemex Charters (\u201cthe New York Proceedings\u201d). By an order of the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (\u201cUS Bankruptcy Court\u201d), proceedings there were stayed on 17 May 2018. 41', '44\\u2003On 20 April 2018, the second defendant filed petitions in the US Bankruptcy Court to commence proceedings in the name of the first defendant and Perforadora pursuant to Chapter 15 of the US Bankruptcy Code (Title 11, USC). The purpose of the proceedings was to obtain orders recognising the joint Concurso Proceedings in Mexico as a foreign main proceeding and recognising the second defendant as the \u201cForeign Representative\u201d of the first defendant and Perforadora. The US Bankruptcy Court granted the orders sought on 17 May 2018. As a result, the first defendant and Perforadora have been granted automatic reliefs including a stay of the New York Proceedings. 42', '45\\u2003On 11 July 2018, the US Bankruptcy Court issued a further order granting various discretionary reliefs. This included a ruling that various orders made by the Mexican court in the joint Concurso Proceedings be recognised and be entitled to full force and effect in accordance with their terms solely with respect to persons or property over whom\/which the US Bankruptcy Court has jurisdiction. 43'"}

V initially rejected  his request and told him that she was \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v BUT [2019]  SGHC  37\n4uncomfortable doing so. However, he continued to cajole V and told her that \nthey should try new things to \u201cspice up\u201d their relationship. Eventually,  V \nrelented and allowed herself to be physically  bound, effectively placing herself \nat the mercy of BUT as she wanted to please him and because she loved  and \ntrusted him. Over the course of their relationship it was BUT who invariably \ninitiated the soft-bondage acts during sexual intercourse.1\n6 On at least one occasion,  BUT floated the idea of a \u201cthreesome\u201d with V. \nHowever, V firmly  told him that she was not interested. In addition to soft-\nbondage activities, BUT regularly  recorded  their sexual intercourse as he \nclaimed that viewing  the erotic videos would facilitate a more rapid onset  of \norgasm for him. V similarly disliked the idea of recording their intimate \nmoments, but she relented as BUT had told her it was for his personal viewing \npleasure only. To win V\u2019s trust, he promised to delete the videos after watching \nthem. V\u2019s fears were  assuaged as she trusted  BUT.2\n7 Unbeknownst to V, BUT had been viewing  pornography on social  media \nand engaging in sexual-related  discussions  with other persons. Sometime in \n2015, he initiated contact with his would-be accomplice  (\u201cSM\u201d), a Singaporean \nmale. At the time of the offences, SM was about 20 years  old.3 BUT and SM \nwould trade lurid details and photographs of their \u201csexual conquests\u201d.4 BUT \ndisclosed to SM his sexual fantasy of watching a third party engaging in sex \nwith his girlfriend, V. Fuelled by his desire  to fulfil his fantasy, BUT conceived  \nof a plan for him and SM to engage in a threesome with V.

Without V\u2019s knowledge, BUT had arranged for SM to come to the \nhotel to participate in  a sexual tryst.6\n9 That night, BUT presented V with a red rope (that he had purchased \nfrom a sex toy shop) and proceeded to loosely bind her hands. He also got V to \nput on a pair of pantyhose and blindfolded her with a bandana. BUT knew  that \nV trusted him when she was placed in such a position and that because  of that \ntrust, she would not attempt  to untie herself  or remove the blindfold. This gave \nBUT and SM the opportunity  to perform  the sexual acts on V without  her \nknowledge. V was completely unaware  of the scheme hatched by them, and she \nsimply thought that BUT wanted to engage in soft bondage play during  sex as \nusual.7\n10 When SM arrived at the hotel, he texted BUT, who replied with the room  \nnumber and directed  SM to wait for his cue before entering the room.  SM then \nmade his way to the room. Shortly after,  BUT opened the door and gestured for \nSM to enter the room. BUT  indicated  to SM to remain silent so as not to arouse \nV\u2019s suspicion.

Once V was completely \nnaked, BUT gestured to SM to lick V\u2019s vagina  again.

However,  \nas the rope was loosely tied around her hands, V was able to free her hands and \npush away the person who was kissing her.

BUT sought to dissuade her. She then \ndemanded to know  the details of the stranger, but BUT initially  claimed  he did \nnot know them.

While BUT was messaging  \nSM to return to the hotel,  SM reminded him to \u201cdelete everything\u201d (to which \nBUT replied that he had) and to erase the messages in  their phones.31\n24 In the meantime,  V proceeded to the hotel lobby and informed the \nreceptionist she could have been  raped and asked to see the camera footage near \nthe hotel  room. At this time,  V noticed  SM walking into the hotel  lobby and \nrecognised him as the person who had raped her. SM was subsequently detained \nby the hotel staff. V also made a police report, and BUT and SM were \nsubsequently arrested by the police  at the hotel.32\nSentencing framework for  the abetment of rape  and digital-penetration\n25 At the outset it should be noted that the maximum  punishment  for \nabetment of an offence remains  the same as for the primary offence  (of rape and \nsexual assault  by penetration).  The Prosecution submitted, and it was not \ndisputed by the Defence, that the sentencing approaches for the primary  \noffences should  apply  with equal force.33 \n26 The parties agreed that the offences  of abetment of rape and digital-\npenetration fell within Band 2 of the framework  in Ng Kean Meng Terence v \nPublic Prosecutor  [2017] 2 SLR 449 (\u201cTerence Ng\u201d)  and in Pram Nair v Public \nProsecutor [2017]  2 SLR 1015 (\u201cPram Nair\u201d) respectively,34 with the following \nsentencing range:\n31 SOF, at  para 32 and p 12 (at footnote 11); Annex D at s\/nos. 38\u201344.\n32SOF, at  paras  16 and 17.\n33 Prosecution\u2019s Submissions on Sentence (\u201cPSS\u201d), dated 21 November 2018, at para 12.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v BUT [2019]  SGHC  37\n12(a) For rape: 13 to 17 years\u2019  imprisonment and 12 strokes of the \ncane; and\n(b) For digital-penetration:  ten to 15 years\u2019  imprisonment  and eight  \nstrokes of  the cane.\n27 In the present case, the parties  agreed that the offence-specific \naggravating factors comprised abuse  of trust, premeditation on BUT\u2019s  part, and \nV\u2019s vulnerability.35 The Prosecution further submitted that the element  of \npremeditation was aggravated by the level of deception employed by BUT and \nthat there  had been the deliberate  infliction  of special  trauma  on V.36\n28 The Prosecution  submitted that given the number and intensity of the \noffence-specific aggravating factors, the case fell within the middle range  of \nBand 2 and the indicative starting point was 15 years\u2019 imprisonment  for the \nabetment of rape,  and 12 years\u2019 imprisonment  for the abetment of digital-\npenetration. Taking  into account the offender-specific aggravating factors of the \nnumber of charges taken into consideration  and BUT\u2019s deletion of incriminating  \nevidence as against the mitigating  factor of BUT\u2019s plea of guilt, a sentencing  \ndiscount of at most a year for each of the charges  would be appropriate.  The \nProsecution thus submitted for a sentence  of 14 years\u2019 imprisonment  and 12 \nstrokes of the cane for the 1st and 2nd charges and of 11 years\u2019 imprisonment  \nand eight strokes of the cane for the 5th charge.

An additional discount of a year per \ncharge was warranted due to the totality principle. The Defence thus submitted \nfor a sentence of 12 years\u2019 imprisonment and eight strokes of the cane for the \n1st and 2nd charges and of eight years\u2019 imprisonment and eight  strokes of the \ncane for the 5th charge. The 1st (or 2nd) and 5th charges were to run \nconsecutively, totalling  20 years\u2019 imprisonment and  24 strokes of the cane.37\nOffence-specific factors\n30 I turn  first to the  offence-specific factors.\nAbuse of trust\n31 The Prosecution  submitted  that there had been a flagrant  abuse of V\u2019s \ntrust. She gave in to BUT\u2019s pleas to engage in soft-bondage practices for his \nsexual pleasure because she loved and trusted  him as her boyfriend. She reposed \nsuch a degree of trust in him that she allowed  herself to be blindfolded and tied \nup during sex thus placing herself  at his complete mercy. The soft-bondage \nroutines entrenched  V\u2019s role as the vulnerable party  in intercourse  and BUT \nexploited her trust to create an opportunity for SM to sexually assault her.38 \nMoreover, even though BUT knew that V had disagreed  with the notion of a \nthreesome, he went ahead to orchestrate  the acts with SM. He selfishly \nprioritised his sexual gratification at V\u2019s expense.\n37 DM, at paras 10\u201311, 61 and 71.\n38 PSS,  at para 16.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v BUT [2019]  SGHC  37\n1432 The Defence rightly conceded  that there had been  an abuse of trust by \nvirtue of the relationship between BUT and V which was an offence-specific  \naggravating factor.  However, referring  to Public  Prosecutor v BQW [2018] \nSGHC 136 at [37],  it suggested  the present case involved a different level of \ntrust as compared  to precedents  where the accused was in an occupation of trust, \nor where  there was a familial  relationship  between the accused and the victim.39\n33 Even if the abuse of trust was not of the nature where the trust was \nderived from the accused\u2019s occupation or familial  role, this did not mean that \nthe degree  of the violation of trust could not be equally egregious. Relationships \nof trust can vary among  individuals, and each case turns on its facts. In the \npresent case,  I agreed with the Prosecution  that there had been a flagrant abuse \nof V\u2019s trust and this was a significant  aggravating  factor.  V was BUT\u2019s  \ngirlfriend and he claimed as someone  \u201cwhom  he had desire to marry\u201d.40 BUT \nknew that V was against participating in a threesome, yet he proceeded to \norchestrate the acts with SM. This was a relationship where V had wholly \nreposed her trust in BUT, and where she had allowed herself to be bound and \nblindfolded because  she loved and trusted him. Indeed, the second  occasion of \nthe abetment of rape occurred when  V was celebrating BUT\u2019s birthday. I \naccepted that V\u2019s shock and horror after she discovered on this occasion,  that a \nstranger had penetrated her vagina  as she struggled to free herself from the rope \nand to make sense of her situation, would have  been  immense.41 As the \nProsecution aptly pointed out, the effect of BUT\u2019s betrayal was poignantly  \nconveyed in V\u2019s own words  to him in the immediate aftermath of the offences,  \nwhen he was  imploring  her to return from the hotel lobby:42\n39 DM, at paras 24\u201327.\n40 DM, at para 51.\n41 PSS,  at paras 1 and  27; SOF at  para  11.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v BUT [2019]  SGHC  37\n15BUT : \u2026please please  don\u2019t  call the police [please]\nBUT : You hold the key to my future\u2026\nV : So what\nV : [You] hold the key to my trust\n\u2026\nBUT : I will do anything for you\u2026\nV : I cannot trust  [you] anymore\nV : Never\nBUT : \u2026Come up\nV : [You are] the one [I should]  feel safe with\nV : The most\nV : No\nV : [I\u2019m] not safe there\n[Emphasis  added.]\nPremeditation and employment of deception\n34 The Prosecution submitted that BUT had displayed premeditation  and \nemployed deception. He was the \u201csole mastermind\u201d of the conspiracy. \nSpecifically, it submitted that BUT capitalised on the fact that he had introduced \nV to soft-bondage practices  and could therefore get her to participate in a \nthreesome against her express wishes.43 In particular, the Prosecution pointed  to \nthe extent of  BUT\u2019s involvement in the  lead  up to the offences:44\n(a) BUT initiated  contact with SM to secure his participation in the \nthreesome. On the second occasion,  he sent titillating  photos of V \n(without her consent or knowledge) to SM.

He and SM also discussed \nnot drinking alcohol or smoking  to prevent  arousing V\u2019s suspicion.\n(c) During the commission of the offences, BUT carefully \norchestrated the rape and digital-penetration, including  sexually  \narousing V before SM sexually violated her, gesturing to SM how and \nwhere he should position himself, and even directing  exactly where  on \nV\u2019s body SM should  ejaculate.\n(d) The extreme  level of deception  was exemplified by the minute \ndetails such as turning on the tap so that running water would mask SM\u2019s  \nentry into the hotel room,  and simulating an orgasm by moaning when \nSM ejaculated on V\u2019s body.  Even after V realised something  was amiss, \nBUT kissed V\u2019s face and  told her to \u201cgo back to sleep\u201d.\n35 I agreed with the Prosecution that there was a considerable degree of \npremeditation and planning as well as employment  of deception in an attempt \nto conceal the heinous acts and to procure  V\u2019s unknowing participation  in the \nacts. It was clear that both BUT and SM had carefully coordinated prior  to, and \nduring, the offences to violate V in such a way as to prevent her from \ndiscovering their reprehensible conduct.  Hence,  whilst it would not be entirely \naccurate to describe BUT as the \u201csole  mastermind\u201d,  nevertheless it was BUT \nwho had initiated the conspiracy with SM and provided details of when and how \nthey would carry out the  sexual violation of V.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v BUT [2019]  SGHC  37\n1736 At this juncture, I turn to address  the Defence\u2019s submission that \nprecedents such as Public Prosecutor v Koh Rong  Guang [2018] SGHC 117 \n(\u201cKoh Rong Guang\u201d) \u2013 where the accused was convicted of three charges of \nstatutory rape and where there was use of the threat of violence \u2013 had more \naggravating factors than the present case.45  I did not think a comparison with \nthe facts of Koh Rong Guang was entirely appropriate First, the overall sentence \nimposed in that case was higher,  ie, 28 years\u2019  imprisonment (and after taking  \ninto account the totality principle) and upon conviction after a trial. Second, I \ndid not think that the lack of a threat  of violence  in the present case was a \ncommensurate comparison. As the Prosecution rightly pointed out, the abetment \nof rape here was insidious  and it was not necessary  for BUT to utilise the threat \nof violence. Rather,  he had deployed  a significant degree of deception and abuse \nof V\u2019s  trust to procure  her unknowing participation in  the rape offences.46\nV was a vulnerable  victim\n37 The Prosecution submitted that V was vulnerable in that she had been \nrendered utterly defenceless against  SM\u2019s  sexual assaults.  The Defence \nconceded that while  V was not vulnerable  in the sense that she was underage, it \naccepted that she was at the mercy of BUT while  the offences were committed.47\n38 I accepted that BUT had capitalised on his encouragement of V into \naccepting soft-bondage practices and further accustomed her to being \nblindfolded and tied up. V\u2019s engagement in soft bondage activities  \u2013 though  she \nwas initially reluctant \u2013 was a choice made because she loved and trusted BUT. \nIt seemed  to me that what  BUT had done was to foster an assumption in V that \n45 DM, at para 45.\n46 PSS,  at para 34.\n47 26\/11\/18 NE at  28.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v BUT [2019]  SGHC  37\n18when she placed herself in such a compromising  position she would not be \nharmed. Once V had acceded to his request  and allowed herself to be \nadditionally vulnerable (by being placed in \u201cbondage\u201d), BUT had exploited that \nvulnerability and invalidated both her trust and her sexual autonomy. It was the \nviolation of V\u2019s inalienable right to choose how and who she would or would \nnot have sex with that struck at the very heart of why rape was rightly regarded  \nas a heinous  offence: see generally Public  Prosecutor v V Murugesan [2005]  \nSGHC 160 at [54].\nDeliberate infliction of special trauma\n39 I turn to the Prosecution\u2019s  submission  that there was the deliberate \ninfliction of special trauma. The Prosecution clarified  it was not submitting  that \nV had suffered severe psychological or psychiatric harm, but rather that this \nrelated to the intention of the accused as manifested in the manner  of offending: \nsee Terence Ng at [44(i)].48 BUT had transgressed V\u2019s wishes not to engage in \na threesome and had filmed the illicit enterprise for his repeated viewing \npleasure. There was a further risk of dissemination of the footage.  Moreover, \nBUT went so far as to dip his fingers in SM\u2019s semen and smeared it over V\u2019s \nlips, subjecting her to further degradation  and humiliation for her perpetrators\u2019  \nsexual pleasure.49 The effect of V\u2019s distress was seen in her reaction in the \naftermath of the rape,  when she was observed to be trembling and when she \nrefused to put  her bag  down.50 \n40 I accepted the Prosecution\u2019s submission  that there was deliberate \ninfliction of special trauma. It should  be noted  that on the first occasion (in April \n48 26\/11\/18 NE at  31.\n49 PSS,  at paras 29\u201330.\n50 PSS,  at para 31.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v BUT [2019]  SGHC  37\n192016), BUT had enabled  SM to repeatedly  rape V (the subject  of the 2nd, 3rd \nand 4th charges). Further, on both occasions,  SM had penetrated V without a \ncondom and thus BUT had knowingly risked V\u2019s exposure to pregnancy and \nthe transmission  of a serious disease  by a stranger. BUT\u2019s act of smearing SM\u2019s  \nsemen over V\u2019s lips showed how he reduced  V to a mere sex object to be \nhumiliated at his pleasure.\nOffender-specific factors\nCharges taken into consideration and deletion  of evidence\n41 Next, I considered the offender-specific  factors. There were 54 charges  \ntaken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. This included two other \nacts of abetment  of rape of V by SM (committed  on the first occasion in April  \n2016), four charges of abetment of the outrage of modesty by SM of V \n(committed on the first and second occasions  of the rape by SM in April  and \nAugust 2016), the making of numerous obscene films pertaining to the acts of \nthe first occasion and, pertinently, committing similar offences of making  \nobscene films of two other unsuspecting females thereby insulting their \nmodesty.51 In addition, BUT\u2019s  hasty deletion  of incriminating evidence  on his \nlaptop and of his messages  with SM was indubitably an aggravating factor (see \nVasentha d\/o Joseph v Public Prosecutor [2015] 5 SLR 122 at [69] in the \ncontext of drug offences). I note that BUT\u2019s deletion of the evidence prevented \nthe recovery of the obscene films he had made of SM and V on the second \noccasion of  the abetment of rape.52\n51 PSS,  at para 37(a).\n52 PSS,  at para 37(b).\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v BUT [2019]  SGHC  37\n20Plea of  guilt\n42 The Defence submitted that BUT\u2019s plea of guilt had saved the \nProsecution and the court valuable time and resources. I did accept  that BUT\u2019s \nplea of guilt meant that V would avoid the trauma  of testifying at trial and \nhaving to relive her ordeal.  I also had sight  of a letter penned by BUT to V,53 \nwhere he expressed his remorse and apologised to her without reservations. I \naccepted that there was  some genuine remorse on BUT\u2019s part.\n43 It has been held in Chang Kar Meng v Public Prosecutor [2017] 2 SLR \n68 at [47]\u2013[48] that even in cases  where the evidence against  an accused is \ncompelling, an accused who pleads guilty should ordinarily be given at least \nsome credit as the victim does not need  to undergo the additional  suffering of \nhaving to relive the experience  in court; nevertheless  this must be viewed  in the \ncontext of other factors.  Here, BUT was caught  red-handed by V and there were  \nvideo footages retrieved from his computer  pertaining to acts on the first \noccasion. Remarkably, despite  the fact that V would have been experiencing \nimmense shock and horror when she discovered someone else was penetrating \nher as she struggled  to free herself and to make sense of her situation,54 she had \nthe presence of mind to attempt to catch sight of the rapist, question BUT, view \nthe incriminating videos, and compel  BUT to call SM to return to the crime  \nscene. Fortuitously,  V\u2019s fortitude in the face of the trauma she had just \nexperienced, coupled with the conduct  of the hotel staff, meant that BUT and \nSM could  be apprehended soon after. \n44 The Defence also submitted that BUT had indicated that he was willing  \nto testify  against  SM, which was evidence  of his contrition.55 In contrast, the \n53 Defence\u2019s Bundle of Authorities, at Tab  M.\n54 PSS,  at paras 1 and  27; SOF, at  para  11.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v BUT [2019]  SGHC  37\n21Prosecution stressed that such an offer  was as yet speculative,  and it would be \neasy for BUT to go back on his indication  to testify.56 In this regard,  I accepted \nthat any effect of an offer by an accused  to testify would necessarily be of an \nunprovable quantity and could be resiled from after sentence was passed. \nHowever, limited weight  might be afforded  to an accused where such an offer  \nappeared to be motivated by genuine  remorse,  which I was of the view  was \nextant in the present case.\nConclusion\n45 In my view, the number and degree of the offence- and offender-specific  \naggravating factors placed  BUT\u2019s offences  at the very least within the middle \nof Band 2 of Terence Ng and Pram Nair and hence the indicative starting \nsentence was 15 years\u2019  imprisonment for abetment of rape and 12 years\u2019 \nimprisonment for abetment of digital-penetration. I agreed that general and \nspecific deterrence was warranted,  given the heinous nature of the crimes  \ncommitted by BUT and the offence-  and offender-specific factors,  such as the \ndegree of premeditation  and planning, the significant deployment of deception \nto procure V\u2019s unknowing participation in the acts, how BUT had destroyed \nincriminating evidence  after he was caught, and the number  and nature of the \ncharges taken into consideration.  It was BUT who had initiated  the plan with \nSM to sexually abuse V and, not being satisfied with having done so once  (on \nthe first occasion), repeated the heinous acts again  (on the second occasion). His \nactions led to the degradation  and humiliation of V, his own girlfriend. At the \nsame time, I took into account BUT\u2019s plea of guilt, his remorse, and that he had \nno previous antecedents. I also considered  that there was some overlap when \n55 DM, at para 52.\n56 26\/11\/18 NE at  32\u201333.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v BUT [2019]  SGHC  37\n22referring to various acts and circumstances which  were considered in the \noffence- or offender-specific factors. Further, I was also cognisant that BUT \nwas relatively young when  he committed the offences and that any global \nsentence to  be imposed would be lengthy. \n46 Bearing in mind the totality principle and with a view  to BUT\u2019s past \nrecord and his future prospects, I thus imposed a term of 14 years\u2019 imprisonment \nand 12 strokes of the cane for each of the abetment of rape charges  (1st and 2nd \ncharges) and 10 years\u2019  imprisonment  and eight strokes of the cane on the \nabetment of digital-penetration charge (5th charge).  I ordered the sentences for \nthe 1st and 5th charges to run consecutively,  thus totalling 24 years\u2019 \nimprisonment with the maximum  24 strokes of the cane. As for the total \nimprisonment term, BUT had previously  spent one month in custody  in the \nInstitute of Mental Health and would thus serve a sentence of 23 years and 11 \nmonths\u2019 imprisonment (after  deducting  the custody period).\nAudrey LimJudicial Commissioner\nNg Yiwen,  Asoka  Markandu, and Eunice  Lau \n(Attorney-General\u2019s Chambers) for the Prosecution;\nMohamed  Baiross and Ashwin Ganapathy (I.R.B.

{"casename":"2019_SGHC_38","fact":"'2\\u2003The first defendant, HealthSTATS International Pte Ltd (\u201cHealthstats\u201d), is a Singapore incorporated company. Its principal business is the manufacturing of medical or clinical diagnostic instruments. 1', 'Its main product is the BPro device, a non-invasive and wireless blood pressure monitoring system that can record blood pressure in 15-minute intervals and provide 24-hour readings. 2', 'It is worn on the wrist and designed like a watch. This is quite different from the usual way of measuring blood pressure using an inflatable cuff. 3', '3\\u2003The BPro device is driven by its software. The source code of the software, including the algorithm contained within the source code, are Healthstats\u2019 trade secrets (\u201cthe Trade Secrets\u201d). 4', 'The parties do not dispute that the Trade Secrets are of considerable value to Healthstats. In fact, more than one counsel referred to the Trade Secrets at the hearing as the \u201ccrown jewels\u201d of Healthstats, a description which appears to me to be a fair one on the facts as disclosed in the affidavits.', '4\\u2003The second plaintiff, Dr Ting Choon Meng (\u201cDr Ting\u201d), and the third plaintiff, Mr Chua Ngak Hwee (\u201cMr Chua\u201d), are the founders and former directors of Healthstats. 5', 'Up to 2 March 2018, Dr Ting held the position of Executive Chairman of Healthstats and Mr Chua held the position of Chief Technology Officer.', '5\\u2003Dr Ting holds shares of Healthstats through the first plaintiff, Jian Li Investments Holding Pte Ltd (\u201cJian Li\u201d). Both Dr Ting and Mr Chua conceptualised and created the BPro device, and they were the ones that formulated the source code and algorithm that enabled the device to record blood pressure levels in 15-minute intervals over a 24-hour period. 6', 'They were removed as executives and directors of Healthstats in circumstances that will be elaborated upon later in this judgment.', '6\\u2003Despite having such a technologically innovative product like the BPro device and its competitors not having a device with similar capabilities, Healthstats operated at a loss annually since its inception in 2000. 7', 'Over the years, there have been investors in the company but its business has never really taken off.', '7\\u2003In May 2017, Dr Ting and Mr Chua approached One Tree Partners Pte Ltd (\u201cOTP\u201d) to discuss the possibility of finding investors for Healthstats. OTP was a Singapore-based private asset management firm. 8', 'At that time, the Chief Executive Officer of OTP was Mr Tan Shern Liang (\u201cMr Tan\u201d). Mr Lian Chin Chiang (\u201cMr Lian\u201d), the second defendant, was also a director of OTP. 9', 'It is not in dispute that Mr Tan was instrumental in putting Dr Ting and Mr Chua in touch with the eventual investors.', '8\\u2003In the ensuing months, the representatives of OTP, Dr Ting and Mr Chua discussed the possibility of finding investors for Healthstats. There was some initial scepticism on the part of Mr Lian about the profitability of this investment given Healthstats\u2019 financial position. 10', 'But it appears that what moved the needle for OTP and the eventual investors was that an Australian biomedical product development company, Planet Innovation Pty Ltd (\u201cPI\u201d), had expressed interest in working together with Healthstats. 11', '9\\u2003PI is a leader in the field of innovation, development and commercialisation of biomedical products. It has won several accolades for being the most innovative company in Australia in 2013, 2015 and 2016. 12', 'It was developing a medical device known as the \u201cVitalic Medical\u201d system (\u201cthe Vitalic\u201d). This is essentially a bedside patient monitoring system that provides nurses with early signs of deterioration and potential patient falls so that nurses can attend to patients\u2019 needs more proactively. 13', '10\\u2003Dr Ting and Mr Chua were aware that the potential collaboration with PI was a big selling point for Healthstats. They therefore made it a point to share with OTP their proposed plans to work with PI. They even invited the representatives of OTP (Mr Tan, Mr Lian as well as another colleague, Mr Michael Sidaway (\u201cMr Sidaway\u201d)) to meet with senior officers from PI in Australia. 14', 'On 8 August 2017, Mr Tan, Mr Lian, Dr Ting, Mr Chua and Mr Marcus Chua, who is the Chief Financial Officer of Healthstats, flew to PI\u2019s offices in Australia. 15', 'There, they were introduced to the business of PI and attended a presentation on proposed partnership opportunities, including the potential \u201cintegration\u201d of the BPro device into the Vitalic. 16', '11\\u2003OTP found investors who were prepared to invest in Healthstats. In September 2017, OTP incorporated Tupai Singapore Private Limited (\u201cTupai\u201d) as well as established an investment fund, Tupai GP (Cayman Islands) (\u201cTupai Fund\u201d). 17', 'OTP and Healthstats entered into an investment agreement on 14 September 2017 (\u201cthe Investment Agreement\u201d). OTP subsequently novated its rights and obligations under the Investment Agreement to Tupai. 18', 'The investment was funded by two limited partners of the Tupai Fund, namely Mr Chang Hon Yee (\u201cMr Chang\u201d), who is the third defendant, and Mr Charles Chen (\u201cMr Chen\u201d). 19', 'Mr Chang and Mr Chen had invested S$11m and S$10m respectively in the Tupai Fund, and S$20m out of the S$21m was invested, through Tupai, in Healthstats.', '12\\u2003Two clauses in the Investment Agreement are of note. They are facilitative of the key consideration for Tupai\u2019s investment in Healthstats, which is ultimately the commercial exploitation of the Trade Secrets. Clause 4.4(b) of the Investment Agreement provided that upon payment of the investment, Healthstats shall immediately:', 'Clause 6.4 of the Investment Agreement provides that:', '13\\u2003In consideration for its S$20m investment, Tupai became the 69.55% majority shareholder of Healthstats. Jian Li\u2019s and Mr Chua\u2019s shareholding decreased from 16.41% and 11.49% to 4.92% and 3.45% respectively. 20', 'Mr Tan, Mr Lian and Mr Chang were also appointed as directors of Healthstats. 21', 'Mr Lian was also appointed as Chief Executive Officer (\u201cCEO\u201d) of Healthstats on 31 October 2017. 22', '14\\u2003During the course of the parties\u2019 oral submissions, there was considerable disagreement on the role of one Mr Paul Phua (\u201cMr Phua\u201d). Mr Chang referred to him as an advisor \u201cfrom whom [he sought] advice on [his] investments from time to time\u201d. 23', 'The plaintiffs, on the other hand, allege that Mr Phua was the ultimate beneficial owner of Mr Chang\u2019s share of the Tupai Fund. 24', 'This allegation was largely premised on some correspondence where Dr Ting refers to the investment as Mr Phua\u2019s and Mr Phua did not immediately refute or correct him. 25', 'However, this impression was later contradicted by one of Mr Phua\u2019s messages, where he states that \u201c[t]his is Hon\u2019s [meaning Mr Chang\u2019s] investment, not mine.\u201d 26', 'This was the only direct statement made by Mr Phua as regards ownership and interest in the Healthstats investment.', '15\\u2003Further, there is evidence to show that Mr Tan, who was one of the key people who put together the deal, had updated Mr Chang in August 2017 on the potential collaboration between Healthstats and PI after the visit to PI\u2019s office in Australia. 27', 'This was before Tupai\u2019s entry into the picture and it suggests that Mr Chang was being updated as a potential investor in Healthstats. In this regard, I accept counsel for Mr Chang\u2019s submission that Mr Tan should be in a position to state whether Mr Phua was the true investor, and not Mr Chang, but Mr Tan never stated so despite having filed an affidavit in support of the plaintiffs\u2019 case. This again suggests that there is no basis to doubt Mr Chang\u2019s assertion that he is not a nominee for Mr Phua.', '16\\u2003But, in any event, I do also agree with the submission made by counsel for Mr Chang that this question of whether Mr Chang or Mr Phua was the true investor was ultimately irrelevant to the determination of the issues in these proceedings. 28', '17\\u2003On 21 November 2017, a Memorandum of Understanding between Healthstats and PI (\u201cthe MOU\u201d) was signed. 29', 'Mr Lian was the signatory on behalf of Healthstats and Mr Sidaway witnessed this. 30', 'The terms of the MOU record what is described as a \u201cStrategic Alliance\u201d between PI and Healthstats. Parties in these proceedings have referred to this as the \u201cAPI Strategic Alliance\u201d, as explained below. Clause 1 of the MOU provided that Healthstats\u2019 role was to use its best endeavours to provide an Application Programming Interface (\u201cAPI\u201d) to process data obtained from the BPro device into periodic and 24-hour blood pressure readings. This information would then be relayed to the Vitalic hub. 31', 'Clause 2 provided that PI\u2019s role was to work with Healthstats to \u201cintegrate the BPro to the Vitalic hub\u201d. 32', '18\\u2003The MOU also included terms relating to confidentiality and the protection of intellectual property (which is defined widely in the MOU). Clause 4 provided that neither party will use intellectual property owned by the other party without the other party\u2019s prior consent, and that any intellectual property belonging to the parties that is used during or for the period of the \u201cStrategic Alliance\u201d will remain the property of the party who owned it. Clause 6 was a confidentiality clause which provided that parties to the MOU cannot disclose the terms of the MOU or information received pursuant to the MOU to third parties. In addition, usage of information received cannot be channelled to any purpose other than for the \u201cStrategic Alliance\u201d contemplated by the MOU. It is not disputed by the plaintiffs that the clauses in the MOU do sufficiently protect the intellectual property of Healthstats for the purposes of this \u201cStrategic Alliance\u201d.', '19\\u2003As mentioned, the plaintiffs refer to the \u201cStrategic Alliance\u201d envisioned by the MOU as the \u201cAPI Strategic Alliance\u201d, 33', 'in contradistinction to what Dr Ting refers to as the \u201cReal Time Strategic Alliance\u201d. The plaintiffs allege that Mr Lian and Mr Chang breached their fiduciary duties to Healthstats by permitting, authorising or facilitating Healthstats\u2019 entry into a Real Time Strategic Alliance. In reply, it is denied by the defendants that Healthstats ever entered into a \u201cReal Time Strategic Alliance\u201d with PI.', '20\\u2003I should preface the discussion as to what these two alliances mean by elaborating a little on the current capabilities of the BPro device. As mentioned earlier, the BPro device is capable of measuring blood pressure at 15-minute intervals (see [2] above). These readings are taken over a period of 24 hours and then compiled into a single report. 34', '21\\u2003The API Strategic Alliance does not involve modifying or enhancing the capabilities of the BPro device. It involves the creation of an API that would translate output coming from the BPro device into readable input for the Vitalic hub to understand. Put simply, the API would only be a tool that plays a translatory function between the two devices. The API itself would not contain any confidential information and the building of the API itself would not require any prior knowledge or access to the source code and algorithm of the BPro device software. 35', '22\\u2003The Real Time Strategic Alliance, on the other hand, as alleged by the plaintiffs, requires the modification (and inevitably, the disclosure) of the source code and algorithm of the BPro device software so that the software can be further developed to measure blood pressure in real-time on a beat-to-beat basis, not just at 15 minute intervals. 36', 'In short, the Trade Secrets will have to be disclosed to PI for the purposes of the Real Time Strategic Alliance so that they can be worked upon. For completeness, Dr Ting also refers to the modification and re-programming of the BPro device to include the capability to \u201clive-stream\u201d blood pressure readings every five to ten minutes, which he describes as being \u201cvery similar to\u201d or \u201caligned\u201d with the goals of the Real Time Strategic Alliance. 37', '23\\u2003Dr Ting and Mr Chua allege that the Trade Secrets of Healthstats should never be disclosed to any third party, and by agreeing to a Real Time Strategic Alliance with PI, the defendant directors had sanctioned or permitted a disclosure of the Trade Secrets in breach of their duties. Mr Lian\u2019s and Mr Chang\u2019s terse response is that there is no Real Time Strategic Alliance, and hence no requirement for modification of the source code and algorithm of the BPro software. As such, there is no disclosure of the Trade Secrets to PI or any third party.', '24\\u2003It is relevant to note that it was common ground between the parties that the terms of the MOU itself, on their face, did not contemplate or cater for a Real Time Strategic Alliance. 38', 'But, whether Healthstats and PI had, without the knowledge of Dr Ting and Mr Chua, entered into a Real Time Strategic Alliance that was encapsulated in some other agreement that was not disclosed was the hotly contested factual dispute between the parties. This issue is dealt with in more detail later in my judgment.', '25\\u2003On 22 February 2018, Mr Lian conveyed his intention to Mr Tan that he wanted to step down as CEO of Healthstats. 39', 'On 28 February 2018, Mr Tan told him to step down with effect from 1 March 2018 and that he would take over as CEO. It appears that this was a result of Mr Lian having \u201cirreconcilable differences\u201d with Dr Ting, Mr Chua and Mr Tan in Healthstats. 40', 'According to Mr Lian, he then sought Tupai\u2019s and Mr Chang\u2019s approval for his resignation. But, after Mr Chang learnt from Mr Lian how Dr Ting and Mr Chua had allegedly mismanaged the company (see [33] below), Mr Chang did not want him to resign and insisted that he should stay on as the CEO to safeguard the interests of Healthstats. Mr Chang also told Mr Lian that he intended to ask Mr Tan to step down from Healthstats. This was because Mr Chang wanted to sever his working and business relationship with Mr Tan due to certain differences that had arisen between them, mostly in connection with other investments that were unrelated to Healthstats. 41', '26\\u2003My review of the facts suggests that there might have been some manoeuvring within OTP between Mr Tan and Mr Lian, perhaps because it appeared that Mr Tan was too friendly with Dr Ting and Mr Chua in relation to issues within Healthstats. But, whatever might have been the truth, the fact remains that Mr Chang, who controlled Tupai, decided that it was Mr Tan that should leave Healthstats and he managed to persuade Mr Lian to stay on.', '27\\u2003On 1 March 2018, Mr Tan signed a separation deed with Mr Chang (\u201cthe Separation Deed\u201d) in Hong Kong, pursuant to which he agreed to resign from his position as director of Healthstats as well as a number of other companies, including Tupai and OTP. 42', 'The Separation Deed was signed at about 10.00pm that night. The circumstances surrounding the signing of the Separation Deed are disputed \u2013 the plaintiffs allege that the deed was entered into under duress, but this was refuted by the defendants. I elaborate on this below at [104].', '28\\u2003On the same day, at around 8.00 to 9.00pm, Mr Lian requested access to Healthstats\u2019 R&D office. The R&D engineer, Ms Soo Pei Fen (\u201cMs Soo\u201d), told him that it was one Ms Helen Lee (\u201cMs Lee\u201d), the office cleaner, who held the keys to the office. Ms Soo then informed Mr Chua \u2013 while Mr Lian was en route to Ms Lee\u2019s home \u2013 that he was looking for the keys to the R&D office. Mr Chua then called Ms Lee and told her not to pass the keys to Mr Lian, and that he would call the police if she did so. 43', 'Mr Lian did not press Ms Lee for the keys and he was thus not able to enter the R&D office. 44', '29\\u2003On the next day, 2 March 2018, at around 9.40am, Mr Lian gathered all the staff of Healthstats in a conference room and announced that Dr Ting and Mr Chua had been suspended from their executive positons, and that he would be replacing Mr Tan as director and chairman of Healthstats. The e-mail accounts and access cards of Dr Ting and Mr Chua were disabled. 45', '30\\u2003Mr Lian then went into the R&D office and got one of the engineers to copy the Trade Secrets, which were stored in one of the computers (and also the servers), into a hard disk (\u201cthe Hard Disk\u201d). This was done openly in the presence of several Healthstats\u2019 employees, including Mr Chua\u2019s brother, Mr Chua Ngak Kwong. According to Mr Lian, this was done because he was concerned that Dr Ting and Mr Chua would \u201csabotage Healthstats by damaging the BPro algorithm and other confidential source codes of Healthstats in retaliation for their suspension\u201d. 46', 'He further explained that his \u201cprimary concern at the time was to secure a backup copy of the BPro algorithm so that Healthstats would not be held ransom by\u201d Dr Ting and Mr Chua. 47', '31\\u2003Mr Lian left the office before the copying of the Trade Secrets into the Hard Disk was completed. But before he left, he gave instructions that the Hard Disk was to be handed to Ms Serene Chang, a manager in Healthstats, for safekeeping. Ms Serene Chang has been an employee of Healthstats since 2009. 48', 'She brought the Hard Disk back home, but brought it back to the office on 7 March 2018. Since then, the Hard Disk has remained in the office of Healthstats under lock and key. 49', '32\\u2003On 9 March 2018, Dr Ting and Mr Chua issued a letter to Healthstats seeking an explanation for their suspensions. This letter also contained a notice of intention to bring a derivative action under s 216A of the CA against Mr Lian and Mr Chang. 50', 'In gist, the allegations in this notice are that Mr Lian\u2019s copying of the Trade Secrets and the steps that he had taken to exclude Mr Chua and Dr Ting from the operations and management of Healthstats indicate that he was not acting in good faith in Healthstats\u2019 interests. It was also stated that there was concern that Mr Lian\u2019s actions in relation to the Trade Secrets would cause irreparable damage to Healthstats.

Chief among these reasons was Dr Ting and Mr Chua had attempted to procure payments to themselves in the amounts of S$791,477.71 and S$832,476.25 respectively for the repayment of loans (with interest) and accrued salary. 51', 'These attempted payments were said to be wrongful on several grounds, including that, there was no board meeting to discuss the payments and therefore there was no chance to consider whether Healthstats had the financial resources to make them. I do not have to detain myself with the full details of all the reasons given by Healthstats for the suspensions, or their correctness, because they are not material to the application before me. The plaintiffs\u2019 application for leave to commence a statutory derivative action does not allege that Mr Lian and Mr Chang had breached their fiduciary duties in deciding to suspend, and later remove, Dr Ting and Mr Chua from their executive positions.', '34\\u2003On 27 April 2018, the plaintiffs\u2019 solicitors issued another notice under s 216A of the CA to Healthstats\u2019 solicitors.

The plaintiff was used as the vehicle to make the joint bid for the development of the Project. 16', '13\\u2003This culminated in the execution of a Heads of Agreement dated 29 October 2007 (\u201cHOA\u201d) signed by Accrington Pte Ltd, the plaintiff\u2019s parent company, and JIHPL. Under the HOA, the plaintiff was required to engage the defendant as the management contractor for the Project. 17', '14\\u2003In or around December 2007, the plaintiff was awarded the contract to develop the Project. Pursuant to the HOA, it entered into discussions with the defendant to negotiate the contract sum and the scope of work that the defendant would provide as the management contractor for the Project. 18', '15\\u2003In accordance with the HOA, the plaintiff appointed JCPL as the design consultant and the SO of the Project. 19', 'JCPL developed the design intent of the Project with input from the defendant. JCPL also developed and issued the architectural design drawings, which were used by the defendant (as management contractor) to engage the trade contractors. In turn, the defendant developed the relevant detailed drawings for the construction of the various works in the Project. 20', '16\\u2003In early May 2008, JCPL\u2019s scope of work was reduced as the defendant took over the design, development and supervision of the temporary and permanent structural works which included the piling works. The defendant informed the plaintiff and JCPL that it would be able to reduce the cost of the reinforced concrete works (\u201cRC works\u201d) by doing so and hence enjoy substantially higher shared savings. To achieve this, the defendant appointed Parsons Brinckerhoff Pte Ltd (\u201cParsons\u201d) as its consultant engineers for the temporary and permanent structural works. 21', '17\\u2003 On the recommendation of the defendant, the plaintiff engaged WT Partnership to prepare a cost estimate for the Project. 22', 'WT Partnership was the Quantity Surveyor involved in a recent development of a biological science building in the vicinity known as Biopolis II. 23', 'As Biopolis II was of a similar nature to the Project, the parties believed that WT Partnership would be familiar with the scope and pricing of the works required for the Project. 24', 'To assist the plaintiff in planning for the finances of this Project, WT Partnership prepared a document dated 13 March 2008 which laid down the estimate of the costs that would be involved in the Project (\u201cWT Cost Estimate\u201d). 25', 'It is not disputed that the plaintiff received the WT Cost Estimate and reviewed it thoroughly.', '18\\u2003For the negotiation of the LOI the plaintiff was represented by PW1, Mr Onn Soon Lee (\u201cPW2\u201d), Mr David Loh Weng Keong (\u201cMr David Loh\u201d) and Mr Patrick Teo (\u201cMr Teo\u201d). 26', 'The defendant was primarily represented by Mr David Tse Tze Kwong (\u201cDW2\u201d) and DW1. 27', '19\\u2003In the course of the negotiation between the plaintiff and the defendant, numerous meetings were conducted and they exchanged emails and drafts of the LOI in April, May and June 2008.

This will be discussed in greater detail below at [104] onwards.', '20\\u2003On 11 June 2008 the defendant sent the plaintiff a breakdown of the preliminaries for the Project entitled \u201cPreliminaries for Main Building Works for Biopolis III at One-North\u201d which explained how the sum of $12.3 million was derived (\u201cJune Preliminaries Breakdown\u201d).', '21\\u2003Eventually, the parties signed the LOI dated 26 June 2008 on 30 June 2008. The LOI is the central source of the parties\u2019 disputes.', '22\\u2003It cannot be gainsaid that pursuant to the LOI, the plaintiff would have to pay the trade contractors through the defendant for their services rendered to the Project. However, it was the defendant who entered into the various trade contracts with the various trade contractors after evaluating the respective tender submissions through a tender exercise. Each tender exercise involved tender questionnaires, tender interviews, tender opening and price negotiation. The defendant would then prepare a tender report in which the preferred trade contractor was identified. The selected trade contractor would subsequently be recommended to the plaintiff for its approval.', '23\\u2003Despite the large scale of the Project, the signed LOI was a bare-bones document of only four pages. The parties attempted to enter into a more formal and comprehensive agreement in the months following the signing of the LOI but were unsuccessful as they had encountered irreconcilable differences.', '24\\u2003For ease of reference, I shall now reproduce the relevant clauses of the LOI:', '25\\u2003Clauses 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2 provide for the Contract Sum under the LOI: 28', '26\\u2003The defendant argues that under cl 1.2, the Preliminaries Sum is fixed at $12.3 million. This is computed by subtracting the Profit and Attendance for the Management Contractor of $1,302,500 from the sum of $13,602,500. However, the parties dispute whether the Preliminaries Sum was agreed at $12.3 million. I shall discuss this further at [104] onwards.', '27\\u2003 The shared savings in the LOI between the parties can be found in cll 4.0, 4.1 and 4.2: 29', '28\\u2003The dispute here is whether the defendant had agreed to waive its share in the first $5 million of the shared savings. This will be discussed further below at [180] onwards.', '29\\u2003Clause 5.0 of the LOI lays down the contract duration for the Project: 30', '30\\u2003Under the signed LOI, the contractual completion date for the Project was on 22 January 2010, which is 18 months from 23 July 2008. This is undisputed. However, the parties disagreed on the meaning of \u201csubstantial completion\u201d in cl 5.0. This issue is crucial because it will determine the date on which the development of the Project is deemed complete under the signed LOI. This will in turn determine the duration of the delay in completing the Project. I shall discuss this issue below at [223] onwards.', '31\\u2003Given that the Project was delayed and was completed after 22 January 2010 which is the completion date stipulated under cl 5.0 of the LOI, the liquidated damages clause under the LOI is relevant. Clause 6.0 of the LOI provides for liquidated damages: 31', '32\\u2003The \u201cWorks\u201d referred to in cl 6.0 cited above refers to the construction and maintenance of the Project. 32', 'The parties are in disagreement as to whether cl 6.0 applies. The defendant submits that cl 6.0 does not apply because the plaintiff had caused critical delays to the Project which the plaintiff denies. This will be discussed in greater detail below at [353] onwards.', '33\\u2003The dispute on the quantum of the Preliminaries Sum to be paid also involved the interpretation of cl 7.1 which can be found under the heading \u201cTerms of Payment\u201d in the LOI: 33', '34\\u2003The parties\u2019 dispute here concerns the meaning of the second paragraph of cl 7.1 of the LOI. The plaintiff submits that the second paragraph of cl 7.1 meant that the parties had agreed to determine the quantum of the Preliminaries Sum within four weeks of the Project\u2019s commencement date. The defendant on the other hand, submits that this paragraph meant that the parties agreed to discuss within four weeks of the Project\u2019s commencement date how the Preliminaries Sum of $12.3 million was to be paid out by the plaintiff over the duration of the Project. I shall deal with this issue below at [104] onwards.', '35\\u2003After the signing of the LOI, the defendant engaged WT Partnership to prepare a formal detailed contract.

Thus, the plaintiff asked the defendant to provide the costing for all the preliminaries works that constituted the Preliminaries Sum. The defendant then sent a revised Preliminaries Breakdown on 12 September 2008 (\u201cSeptember Preliminaries Breakdown\u201d) to the plaintiff. After further discussion between the parties, another revised version of the preliminaries breakdown was provided on 6 October 2008 (\u201cOctober Preliminaries Breakdown\u201d). 36', 'I shall refer to the August Preliminaries Breakdown, the September Preliminaries Breakdown and the October Preliminaries Breakdown collectively as the Preliminaries Breakdown.', '36\\u2003The plaintiff disagreed with the Preliminaries Breakdown and ultimately, the Draft WT Contract was not executed. Nonetheless, the Preliminaries Breakdown and the Draft WT Contract continue to be relevant because the parties regularly referred to these documents in the course of the Project.', '37\\u2003On 29 July 2009, the defendant provided the plaintiff with the OCBC Bond. The OCBC Bond was for the sum of $4,793,500. The plaintiff eventually returned the OCBC Bond to the defendant on 21 January 2010 because it was a conditional bond and not an on-demand bond. 37', 'According to the plaintiff, the OCBC Bond was not in compliance with the LOI because it was understood by the parties that the defendant was to provide an on-demand performance bond. Furthermore, the OCBC Bond was provided one year late and this again was not in compliance with what was agreed under the LOI.', '38\\u2003One of the disputed issues is that the parties disagreed on whether there was an obligation on the defendant to provide a performance bond under the LOI. If there was such an obligation, the parties disagreed on what kind of performance bond the defendant must provide. I shall discuss this issue below at [171] onwards.', '39\\u2003As mentioned above, under the LOI, the development of the Project was to be completed by 22 January 2010. 38', 'However, the Project was only certified to be completed on 12 January 2011. 39', '40\\u2003The defendant accepted that the Project was not completed within 18 months as stipulated under cl 5.0 of the LOI.

LSI\u2019s case is that Goh made various representations to Florence to induce LSI to enter into the SPA and thereafter, Goh and Lee Kin Yun (\u201cLee\u201d), who was in charge of AMP\u2019s operations, repeated the representations to Florence and Andy. These representations formed the subject of Suit No 1311 of 2015, commenced on 31 December 2015, and my decision was published as Liberty Sky Investments Pte Ltd v Goh Seng Heng and another [2019] SGHC 39 (\u201cSuit 1311\u201d). Briefly, the alleged representations were as follows:', '(a)\\u2003There would be a trade sale of all the shares in AMP to an important person in Singapore, namely Peter Lim, which was imminent and likely to take place within one month and with a 99% probability of being concluded.', '(b)\\u2003If the trade sale did not materialise, Goh intended to list AMP through an IPO on the Singapore Exchange, targeted for completion around March to June 2015 and in any event no later than 24 months after LSI acquired the AMP shares.', '(c)\\u2003Goh required LSI\u2019s financial support to buy out certain minority investors in AMP with voting rights who could stifle the trade sale or IPO, as he was unable to do so then because his money was \u201cstuck\u201d elsewhere.', '4\\u2003 As neither a trade sale nor an IPO took place, LSI filed Suit 1311 and claimed against Goh for misrepresentation. In line with the claims, LSI issued a letter of demand to Goh on 24 November 2015 giving notice that it was electing to rescind the SPA. 2', 'Suffice to say, both parties accept that the SPA has come to an end. LSI claimed that it was entitled to and did validly rescind the SPA by virtue of the misrepresentations. Goh claimed that LSI had wrongfully repudiated the SPA as the misrepresentations were not made out.', '5\\u2003 On 2 December 2016 (which was after the 24-month deadline mentioned in the Purported Indemnity), LSI\u2019s counsel wrote to AMP to state that it had formally notified Goh under Clause 4(vii) of the SPA and demanded that Goh repurchase the shares and, if he did not do so, LSI would claim against AMP on a \u201cGuarantee\u201d (in the words of LSI\u2019s counsel) that LSI alleges is the Purported Indemnity. 3', 'As Goh failed to repurchase the shares, LSI\u2019s counsel further wrote to AMP on 30 December 2016 to demand that AMP make payment pursuant to the obligations outlined in its 2 December 2016 letter (ie, the \u201cGuarantee\u201d, which it alleges in this suit as the Purported Indemnity). 4', 'AMP did not do so and in May 2017 LSI commenced this suit against Goh for a declaration that he re-purchase the shares from LSI at the Sale Price plus 15% IRR totalling $19,073,162, and against AMP for payment to LSI of the same amount under the Purported Indemnity. This suit was heard immediately after Suit 1311 as the facts pertaining to the SPA and the Purported Indemnity were inextricably linked and the plaintiffs were the same in both proceedings.', '6\\u2003In the interim, Goh applied to strike out LSI\u2019s claim on the basis that LSI was precluded from relying on the SPA, which LSI had rescinded and thus brought to an end. AMP also applied to strike out LSI\u2019s claim on the basis that the Purported Indemnity was in effect a guarantee that was embodied in the SPA. As AMP was not a party to the SPA, LSI could not claim on the guarantee against AMP. I found that LSI had made an unequivocal election to rescind the SPA. Given that any agreement with Goh was embodied in the SPA, it was no longer open to LSI to enforce a claim against him. I therefore granted Goh\u2019s application. However, it remained open to LSI to show that an agreement between LSI and AMP continued to exist outside the SPA. Hence, the trial proceeded only between LSI and AMP on the Purported Indemnity.'"}

D3 would pay their wages and foot the expenses they incurred during the course of their work, and claim the corresponding sum from Nike by submitting an invoice for the same to Ms Joanne Cheong, who was a product presentation manager with Nike. Ms Cheong would then check the invoice to ensure that the claim was in order, before submitting it to Nike\u2019s finance department, which would then disburse the invoiced sum to D3.

The \u201cCore Management Team\u201d included Mr Wong, Mr Seen, Mr Lou, Ms Chng and an employee of Mactron, Michael Ang Chee Siong. Mr Seen, Mr Lou and Ms Chng would be hired by MCH and seconded to the joint venture company. Mr Ang would be hired directly by the joint venture company.', '(d)\\u2003YGL would extend a loan of up to S$4,000,000 to MCH \u201cto assist MCH for its portion of the purchase price\u201d, and this would be secured by the guarantees of two directors of MCH, namely, Mr Wong and his wife, Madam Sing Lee Mee Yoke (\u201cMrs Wong\u201d). The first disbursement of the loan would be in January 2015, in the amount of S$500,000. This was to help MCH cover the cost of, inter alia, legal and financial due diligence expenses, and the payment for the deployment cost of the core management team members. In the event that the financial due diligence was unsatisfactory, MCH would return the S$500,000. If the financial due diligence was satisfactory, the rest of the loan would be disbursed according to a specified disbursement schedule.', '7\\u2003On 27 January 2015, YGG was incorporated and Mr Wong was appointed as the managing director. Mr Liong was appointed a director, and Mr Iskandar took on the role of a \u201cneutral director\u201d and chairman of the YGG board. 10', '8\\u2003Parties then entered into a series of written contracts to reflect their agreement, including:', '(a)\\u2003A Shareholders Agreement dated 29 January 2015 between YGG, YGL and MCH. 11', '(b)\\u2003A Subscription Agreement dated 29 January 2015 between YGG, YGL and MCH. 12', '(c)\\u2003A Call Option Agreement dated 29 January 2015 between YGL and MCH. 13', '(d)\\u2003A Deed of Undertakings dated 29 January 2015. 14', 'The Deed of Undertakings contained, inter alia, an undertaking to \u201cprocure\u201d Mr Seen, Mr Lou and Ms Chng to be hired by MCH and seconded to YGG. 15', '(e)\\u2003A Loan Agreement dated 29 January 2015 between YGL and MCH. 16', 'Clause 7.1 of the Loan Agreement stated that MCH would be obliged to return all outstanding loan amounts if YGL did not wish to proceed with the proposed acquisition of the Target Companies, upon completion of due diligence. 17', '(f)\\u2003A Deed of Personal Guarantee dated 29 January 2015, 18', 'by which Mr and Mrs Wong guaranteed the payment obligations of MCH under the Loan Agreement.', '9\\u2003The scope of a last document required discussion between parties.

The initial plan was to acquire the Target Companies with a purchase price of US$11,000,000 to be paid by YGG to the Vendors in three tranches, US$2,000,000, US$5,000,000 and US$4,000,000, with full control and transfer of shares on payment of the first tranche (\u201cthe Initial Acquisition Model\u201d). In order to fund these payments, YGL and MCH would subscribe to shares in YGG in proportion to their stake in YGG, ie, 30% and 70% respectively, whenever a payment had to be made. 24', 'This acquisition process was subject to satisfactory due diligence being conducted. 25', '11\\u2003On 29 January 2015, Mr Wong emailed Mr Liong, Mr Iskandar and the core management team with a copy of the financial due diligence report (\u201cFirst Due Diligence Report\u201d) for up to October 2014, prepared by a company called Shanghai Certified Public Accountants (\u201cSCPA\u201d) in respect of the Target Companies. The original First Due Diligence Report was written in Mandarin, and Mr Wong forwarded a copy that was translated by SCPA into English. 26', '12\\u2003Mr Wong then proceeded to finalise the acquisition with the Vendors. Throughout the negotiation process, the negotiations were managed by Mr Wong. On the side of the Vendors, Mr Lim was the primary point of contact. The other two Vendors were not active in the negotiations. 27', '13\\u2003As a condition for the transfer of full control as suggested by the Initial Acquisition Model, the Vendors required YGG to provide security in the form of banker\u2019s guarantees for the second and third tranche amounts of US$5,000,000 and US$4,000,000. 28', 'MCH was, however, unable to provide banker\u2019s guarantees for MCH\u2019s portion of the second and third tranche payments. Parties therefore agreed on an amended plan (the \u201cRevised Acquisition Model\u201d). In the Revised Acquisition Model, no security was necessary. The Target Companies were to be purchased in two phases, with full control of the companies deferred to the second phase. The first tranche would be a payment of US$4,400,000 for 40% of the issued share capital in YGIPL with an option to purchase the remaining 60% for US$6,600,000 within 12 months. By 30 March 2015, Mr Wong and Mr Lim had reached in-principle agreement on key terms of the acquisition. 29', 'A first draft of the Share Purchase Agreement between YGG and YGIPL was sent to Mr Wong on 28 April 2015. 30', '14\\u2003Around late April 2015, Mr Wong visited the Target Companies in Shanghai to examine the business. 31', 'In a WhatsApp conversation with Mr Iskandar, Mr Liong and Mr Ang, Mr Wong reported that the Target Companies were performing well and expressed great optimism. 32', 'On 28 June 2015, Mr Wong sent an email attaching a draft legal due diligence report (\u201cFirst Legal Due Diligence Report\u201d) to Mr Liong. In the email, Mr Wong informed Mr Liong that there were a few compliance issues, but these were either previously anticipated or not \u201cmajor\u201d. 33', 'On 23 July 2015, Mr Wong arranged for a meeting in Shanghai in order to discuss the terms of the acquisition and the findings in the First Legal Due Diligence Report. The meeting was attended by Mr Wong, Mr Liong, Mr Seen, Mr Ang, Mr Lim, Mr Cai and the general manager of the Target Companies, Mao Li. Ms Mao was held in high regard by the Vendors and she was kept fully apprised of the acquisition process. 34', 'After the conclusion of the meeting, Mr Wong assured Mr Liong that the results of the legal due diligence were satisfactory. 35', '15\\u2003Sometime in July 2015, Mr Wong mentioned to Mr Liong that he had found a private equity investment firm, KV Asia Capital Pte Ltd (\u201cKV Asia\u201d) which had expressed interest in participating in the joint venture. While Mr Wong proposed to involve KV Asia in their deal, Mr Liong did not follow up on this proposal. 36', '16\\u2003On 4 August 2015, Mr Liong received an email from Mr Wong attaching a document titled \u201cYong Gui Investment \u2013 Commission Letter 150730\u201d.

Mr Wong sent a further email on 5 August 2015 at 1.12am that stated: 37', 'Mr Liong replied on 8 August 2015 thanking Mr Wong for his openness and integrity. 38', '17\\u2003Mr Liong and Mr Wong agreed that a further loan of S$500,000 would be made to MCH, in exchange for which YGL would have the opportunity to subscribe to an additional 5% of shares in YGG. In addition, MCH would also be allowed to draw down the full sum of the loan on 19 August 2015, in order to fund MCH\u2019s contribution towards its share for the acquisition of the first 40% of YGIPL. 39', '18\\u2003Arising from the change in the acquisition model and to the loan between YGL and MCH, amendments to the written contracts the parties had signed in January 2015 became necessary.

The first tranche corresponded to the entry into the SPA and the second tranche corresponded to the exercise of the Purchaser\u2019s Call Option. The total subscription payments received by YGG in each tranche matched the amount that was due to the Vendors in each tranche. In this way, YGG would have had enough cash to pay the Vendors for the shares in YGIPL. For the first tranche, MCH was obliged to subscribe to US$2,859,950 worth of shares, and for the second tranche, MCH was obliged to subscribe to US$4,290,000 worth of shares. 50', 'The combined effect of the Loan Agreement (as amended on 18 August 2015) and the SPA was that the cash for YGG\u2019s purchase of the first 40% of the YGIPL shares came entirely from YGL. 51', '21\\u2003Without Mr Liong\u2019s knowledge, on the same date the SPA was executed, Mr Wong also signed three further documents (which I shall refer to collectively as the \u201cSecret Arrangements\u201d):', '(a)\\u2003A letter written by Mr Lim on behalf of the Vendors, which promised to Mr Wong a commission of US$380,000, for the referral of YGG to the acquisition deal (\u201cthe Commission Letter\u201d). The commission was expressed to be paid in two tranches, the first being US$300,000 upon YGG\u2019s purchase of 40% of the YGIPL shares, the second being US$80,000 upon YGG\u2019s purchase of the balance of the YGIPL shares. 52', '(I shall refer to this arrangement as the \u201cSecret Commission Agreement\u201d); and', '(b)\\u2003Two declarations of trust, one in favour of Mr Lim and the other in favour of Ms Mao.

No response was given; subsequent requests were also ignored. 55', 'On 28 August 2015, Mr Wong discovered that Mr Liong had amended the terms of the SPA at the last minute, such that in the event the Vendors exercised the Vendors\u2019 Call Option, the purchase money would be paid to YGL instead of YGG. Mr Wong was deeply unhappy about this change, and Mr Wong and Mr Liong had an exchange on this issue via email. 56', '23\\u2003On 15 September 2015, Mr Wong requested that Mr Liong share the cost of the expenses incurred in the course of conducting due diligence on the Target Companies. Mr Liong initially replied on 23 September 2015 stating that the agreement in January was that the due diligence costs was to be borne entirely by Mr Wong. After an exchange of emails, Mr Liong checked his documentation on the matter and by 8 October 2015 accepted that the due diligence costs were to be shared. 57', '24\\u2003On 3 October 2015, Mr Wong sent an email with a Letter of Offer from KV Asia dated 2 October 2015 (\u201cKV Asia Offer\u201d) to Mr Liong. 58', 'In the KV Asia Offer, KV Asia proposed to inject more capital into YGG, to allow YGG to purchase other companies in the logistics industry on top of YGIPL in exchange for shares in YGG. This would have resulted in a dilution of YGL\u2019s shareholding in YGG. 59', 'The deal also involved two individuals by the name of Troy Shortell and Paraj Kakkar. 60', 'They were Mr Wong\u2019s \u201cacquisition advisors\u201d and were directors in a consultancy company called Assurance Box Pte Ltd (\u201cABPL\u201d). 61', '25\\u2003Mr Wong strenuously tried to persuade Mr Liong to accept the offer, but Mr Liong was hesitant to do so. 62', 'In Mr Liong\u2019s view, the KV Asia Offer would have benefited individuals or entities close to Mr Wong (such as Mr Iskandar, all the members of the core management team except for Mr Ang, and Mr Wong\u2019s acquisition advisors) at the expense of YGL. It involved a dilution of YGL\u2019s share in YGG, while MCH and a company owned by Mr Shortell would enjoy share premiums. The core management team would benefit from additional management incentives, but Mr Ang was left out of any such incentives. Mr Iskandar would be made President Director of one of the other logistics companies while Mr Liong would lose his seat on the Board of Directors of YGG. 63', 'In an email dated 20 October 2015 sent at 9.08pm, Mr Liong refused the KV Asia Offer. Within that email he listed several reasons why he felt the offer was a bad deal for YGL. He expressed the view that YGL was being short changed by the deal while MCH would enjoy \u201chuge premiums\u201d. Mr Liong stated that Mr Wong\u2019s attempt to pressure him into signing the deal suggested that Mr Wong was \u201cnot look[ing] after [his] interest as [his] partner in [YGG]\u201d. 64', '26\\u2003Mr Wong replied in an email sent on the same day at 11.26pm. He stated that Mr Liong\u2019s \u201cargument [was] very one sided\u201d. He gave his reasons why the deal was a fair one for all parties and listed several instances where he felt Mr Liong had not acted as a good partner in their joint investment. 65', 'After receiving this email and several related WhatsApp messages in a similar vein from Mr Wong, Mr Liong was concerned that Mr Wong was going to abandon the joint venture, make a deal with KV Asia without him and take away the core management team that was promised to YGG. 66', '27\\u2003In an attempt to resolve the situation, Mr Ang and Mr Iskandar jointly came up with a modified version of the KV Asia Offer. The intent was to create a deal that would satisfy both Mr Wong and Mr Liong. This was presented by Mr Ang and Mr Iskandar to Mr Wong at a meeting on 25 October 2015. 67', 'However, during the meeting, Mr Wong instead confirmed that he was no longer intent on pursuing the KV Asia Offer and the acquisition of YGIPL would proceed as planned. 68', '28\\u2003On 6 November 2015, Mr Liong sent an email reminding Mr Wong that the parties had planned to exercise the Purchaser\u2019s Call Option around September and October 2015, and this date was later pushed to December 2015. Mr Liong expressed the desire to not have the exercise of the Purchaser\u2019s Call Option pushed back any further. He also reminded Mr Wong that they had envisioned that Mr Ang, Mr Seen and Mr Lou would be involved in YGG\u2019s operations shortly after the signing of the SPA, but this had yet to be done. 69', 'Mr Wong did not want to exercise the Purchaser\u2019s Call Option by December, stating in a WhatsApp group conversation between Mr Wong, Mr Liong, Mr Iskandar and Mr Ang on 19 November 2015 that \u201c[u]nless asset tagging is done, unless I am comfortable of the business, we should not exercise\u201d. 70', '29\\u2003On 15 December 2015, Mr Ang started travelling across various cities in China to conduct the asset tagging of the Target Companies. Mr Ang completed the asset tagging exercise on 22 December 2015. 71', '30\\u2003In an email sent on 21 December 2015, Mr Liong urged Mr Wong to procure the core management team to work in YGG and to refrain from pushing back the exercise of the Purchaser\u2019s Call Option. 72', 'Mr Wong replied on the same day. In his reply, Mr Wong refused Mr Liong\u2019s request to have the core management team work in YGG, stating: \u201cthis is the holiday period and as per my note to you before my staff has already went for a break but we were in constant communication with [YGIPL] on the many things such as procurement of assets, scraping of trucks, leasing terms and now asset tagging\u201d. Mr Wong also gave two additional reasons (aside from asset tagging) to explain why he refused to allow the exercise the Purchaser\u2019s Call Option. First, the dispute over the KV Asia Offer, as well the dispute relating to the payment of due diligence costs (see [23] above) had cost YGG time, and led to a delay in the process of preparing for the exercise of the Purchaser\u2019s Call Option. Second, Mr Wong explained that \u201cso long as we do not have full clarify [sic] on the final year\u2019s number, we cannot exercise the option to buy the 60%\u201d. 73', '31\\u2003Mr Liong was not impressed with these reasons. He sent an email on 26 January 2016 giving Mr Wong a deadline of 29 January 2016 to second the core management team to YGG. 74', 'The parties could not resolve their dispute and on 3 February 2016, YGL commenced Suit 104\/2016 against MCH and Mr Wong for various breaches under the Deed of Undertakings, primarily for the failure to hire and second the core management team to YGG.', '32\\u2003On 16 February 2016, YGG held a board meeting attended by Mr Iskandar, Mr Wong, Mr Liong and Mr Ang. In the meeting, Mr Wong put forward his position that YGG would not exercise the Purchaser\u2019s Call Option until a second financial due diligence exercise (\u201cSecond Due Diligence\u201d), commenced by the same auditors who led the first financial due diligence exercise, was completed. The Second Due Diligence could only commence after 15 March 2016, as the particular auditors that Mr Wong wanted to lead the due diligence exercise was not available till that date. Mr Liong objected to a delay in the due diligence exercise and expressed the view that the Purchaser\u2019s Call Option had to be exercised as soon as possible. Mr Wong\u2019s rebuttal was that it was his duty as the Managing Director of YGG to ensure that proper due diligence was done before exercising the option. Mr Wong noted several concerns found in the YGIPL\u2019s financial reports that he felt needed to be addressed before the exercise of the option. 75', '33\\u2003In late February 2016, without Mr Liong\u2019s knowledge, Mr Shortell and Mr Kakkar approached a company by the name of Yang Kee Logistics Pte Ltd (\u201cYKL\u201d), to solicit for the potential acquisition of YGIPL. 76', '34\\u2003In the meantime, Mr Liong did not agree with Mr Wong\u2019s reasons for the refusal to exercise the Purchaser\u2019s Call Option and suspected that it was a further attempt to stymie the acquisition process. He was concerned that if the Purchaser\u2019s Call Option lapsed, the Vendors would buy back the 40% of YGIPL at a 10% discount, causing loss to YGG. He was also worried that given that Mr Seen had yet to be deployed to Shanghai, there would be insufficient time left for YGG to learn and take over the business of the Target Companies. Mr Liong resolved to take control of the situation. He emailed his desire to have YGG be immediately involved in the operations of the Target Companies, by having Mr Ang be deployed to China in Mr Seen\u2019s intended role, since Mr Seen had yet to be seconded to YGG. 77', 'However, Mr Wong rejected this suggestion. Mr Wong and Mr Liong also sparred over whether the Second Due Diligence needed to be conducted before YGG exercised the Purchasers\u2019 Call Option. 78', '35\\u2003On 18 March 2016, YGL purported to exercise its rights under clause 3.8 of the Deed of Share Charge to appoint Mr Bernard Tan Keng Beng (\u201cMr Tan\u201d), an employee of Mactron, as the proxy for MCH. 79', 'On 22 March 2016, YGG held an extraordinary general meeting (\u201cEGM\u201d). Mr Wong and Mr Iskandar were invited to the EGM, but the parties had a dispute over whether Mr Seen should have been allowed into the EGM. Mr Wong wanted to appoint Mr Seen as the proxy for MCH, but Mr Liong insisted that Mr Tan had already been appointed in that capacity, and hence there was no reason for Mr Seen to attend. 80', 'The parties were unable to resolve their dispute and Mr Wong and Mr Iskandar left the EGM. From this point onwards, Mr Tan was the party who voted on behalf of MCH in the general meetings of YGG.', '36\\u2003Mr Iskandar and Mr Wong refused to accept the legitimacy of the EGM of 22 March 2016, as well as the appointment of Mr Tan as the corporate representative of MCH. On 29 March 2016, Mr Iskandar and Mr Wong held an EGM without Mr Liong or any representative from YGL, claiming that the EGM on 22 March 2016 was \u201cadjourned\u201d and the EGM of 29 March 2016 was the \u201creconvened\u201d version of the EGM. 81', '37\\u2003On 6 April 2016, YGL commenced Suit 337\/2016 against MCH for allegedly defaulting on the Amended Loan Agreement. Mr and Mrs Wong were joined as defendants because of the personal guarantees they had provided for the loan in the Amended Loan Agreement.', '38\\u2003On 15 April 2016, Mr Iskandar was removed as a director of YGG and replaced by Mr Ang. 82', 'On 19 April 2016, Mr Tan was appointed as a director. 83', 'Mr Wong and Mr Iskandar protested these actions, and filed a complaint to ACRA in relation to the removals and appointments. 84', '39\\u2003After Mr Iskandar\u2019s removal as director of YGG, Mr Wong continued to copy Mr Iskandar in the email correspondences between Mr Wong and Mr Liong relating to YGG, despite being repeatedly warned by Mr Liong that he was in breach of the confidentiality clauses in their contracts. Mr Wong\u2019s reply was that he was entitled to keep Mr Iskandar in the loop. In his view, Mr Iskandar was not validly removed, and remained a director of YGG. 85', '40\\u2003On 14 April 2016, the Second Due Diligence was completed and the due diligence report was circulated by Ms Mao. 86', 'On 27 May 2016, Mr Wong claimed that based on the report, there were outstanding due diligence issues that justified a delay in exercising the Purchasers\u2019 Call Option. 87', '41\\u2003While this was ongoing, Mr Wong secretly met with representatives of YKL to negotiate the sale of shares of YGIPL to YKL. 88', 'During the negotiations, Mr Wong attempted to procure a separate monetary benefit from YKL to himself, if YKL managed to purchase YGIPL. 89', 'The negotiations were conducted primarily between Ken Koh Kien Chon (\u201cMr Ken Koh\u201d), Group CEO of YKL, on behalf of YKL, and Mr Wong with Mr Shortell acting as an intermediary. On 5 June 2016, YKL sent an offer via email for the purchase of 100% of YGIPL at the price of US$17,500,000 (\u201cthe first YKL Offer\u201d). 90', 'On 6 June 2016, Mr Wong requested a Letter of Intent from Mr Ken Koh. However, on 8 July 2016, Mr Ken Koh backed out of the acquisition because his repeated requests to meet Mr Cai were ignored and also because he was uncomfortable with the lack of clarity in the shareholding structure of the Target Companies. 91', 'Mr Shortell urged Mr Ken Koh to reconsider his withdrawal. 92', 'In response, on 14 July 2016, YKL sent a signed Letter of Intent for the purchase of 100% of YGIPL at the price of US$15,500,000 (\u201cthe second YKL Offer\u201d). 93', 'Mr Liong alleges that neither of the YKL Offers were disclosed to him. The second YKL Offer was not accepted.', '42\\u2003On 28 July 2016, MCH stopped paying interest due on the loan from 28 July 2016, on the grounds that YGL had \u201cdisrupted the business of [MCH] and has engineered [MCH]\u2019s default on interest payment\u201d. 94', '43\\u2003Sometime in July 2016, YGG commissioned a fresh legal due diligence (\u201cSecond Legal Due Diligence\u201d) on the Target Companies in preparation for the exercise of the Purchaser\u2019s Call Option.

{"casename":"2019_SGHC_46","fact":"'5\\u2003The background facts were recounted in the district judge\u2019s decision of Public Prosecutor v GCK [2018] SGDC 195. 3', '6\\u2003The appellant started his employment at the Home in July 2010, initially as a health attendant, and from 2013, as a staff member of the maintenance department. He was put in charge of repairing and maintaining electrical items such as the fans, light bulbs and the call bells on the residents\u2019 beds. 4', '7\\u2003The residents of the Home were mainly elderly individuals with multiple disabilities, cognitive impairment or those in need of nursing care. 5', 'The victim was a female resident of the Home. She was 55 years old at the time of the offence. She had been a resident of the Home since 6 July 2011. 6', 'She had previously suffered multiple strokes which left her with limited speech and restricted mobility on the left side of her body. She also suffered from various psychological conditions.', '8\\u2003The Prosecution\u2019s case was that the Appellant had assaulted the victim on 26 November 2016, in Room 5, while the victim was in her bed (\u201cBed 7\u201d). This assault was witnessed by Nurse MJ.', '9\\u2003Nurse MJ happened to be in Room 5 while on her rounds. She had noticed that the curtains of three beds on the left side of the inner section of Room 5 were drawn. The curtain to one of the beds, Bed 8, was fully drawn but the curtain for Bed 7 was half drawn. She was puzzled as to why the curtains were drawn as the curtains were usually drawn only during diaper changes and the residents in three of the beds, including Bed 8, were not in the room at the time.', '10\\u2003Nurse MJ proceeded to check on the resident in Bed 6. While she was at the foot of Bed 6, she heard a crying sound coming from the bed opposite, being Bed 7. When she turned around to face Bed 7, she saw the victim lying on the bed with the appellant kneeling above her. Nurse MJ stated that this crying sound was the same sound that the victim would make whenever the victim was in pain. Nurse MJ said that she could see Bed 7 as the curtain to Bed 7 was only half drawn. 7', '11\\u2003Nurse MJ described the appellant as having had his pants lowered to his thigh area and his bare buttocks exposed. His legs were apart, with one leg on each side of the victim\u2019s body. He was in a kneeling position with a slight tilt forward. The victim\u2019s trousers were also lowered and the left strap of her diaper was undone. The appellant\u2019s hips were facing the victim\u2019s hips and his groin area was touching her groin area. Nurse MJ stated that she was able to recognise the appellant as she could see half his face. 8', 'Nurse MJ said that she was shocked by what she saw and thought that it had something to do with sex. She observed the situation for about five seconds before immediately leaving the room; 9', 'she did not try to stop the appellant as she was scared.', '12\\u2003After she left Room 5, Nurse MJ approached a male nurse, Nurse DS. She only told him to go to the room to see what the appellant was doing on the bed. She did not explain what she saw to Nurse DS. Nurse DS did go to the room but did not find the appellant to be doing anything untoward.', '13\\u2003At about 6.30pm, after she had left work, Nurse MJ called a senior staff nurse, JS (\u201cSSN JS\u201d) to speak about what she saw. They later met and Nurse MJ recounted what she had earlier witnessed. 10', 'SSN JS then informed the director of the Home, Mr T, that night. 11', 'The victim was, however, not immediately sent for medical examination. Instead, Mr T waited until the next day (27 November 2016) to investigate the matter. 12', 'He had Nurse MJ point out where the victim\u2019s bed was and he tried to talk to the victim. The victim was, unfortunately, unable to answer any of his questions. Mr T reviewed the CCTV footage of the incident the following day (28 November 2016). He said that he was shocked to see the appellant, a male staff, enter an all-female room unescorted. A male staff member cannot enter an all-female room unless he had the permission of the staff nurse on duty and there is no one inside the room. Mr T said that he then confronted the appellant on the matter. The appellant told Mr T that he was merely doing some work for a resident. Mr T explained that he did not speak to Nurse MJ as he spoke Hindi whereas she spoke Tamil. He then decided that he would not be taking further action as yet since he was new to the job and was trying to obtain more information. 13', '14\\u2003It was only in January 2017 that the Headquarters of the Home caught wind of the matter and decided to conduct an investigation. This led to a police report being lodged against the appellant on 23 January 2017. 14', '15\\u2003The appellant was arrested on 23 January 2017. 15', '16\\u2003In his defence below, the appellant denied the assault. His reason for being in Room 5 was that he had been asked to fix the portable television belonging to the resident of Bed 8, Resident JP. He had met Resident JP in the dining hall on the third floor before lunch time. She asked him to help repair her portable television as she wanted to watch shows on Channel 8. According to the appellant, this was not the first time Resident JP had approach him for assistance to fix her television. 16', '17\\u2003The appellant made his way to Room 5 after lunch when he was done with his work for the day. He had brought along a power cable and screw driver. When he reached Bed 8, he noticed that the curtain was drawn. He had to therefore pull the curtain apart by a little to go to Bed 8. Resident JP was not at her bed. The appellant tried to switch the television on to check if there was power, but there was none. He opened up the plug and saw that the fuse was burnt. He thus took the fuse from the power cable that he had brought along with him and replaced the burnt fuse with it. He then switched the television on and there was power. He also tried tuning the television to receive Channel 8. During the time he was fiddling with the television, the appellant claimed to have been kneeling between Beds 7 and 8 and had placed the television in the middle of Bed 8. 17', '18\\u2003As the appellant was attending to the television, he heard a sound coming from behind him. It sounded as if someone was tapping at the bed or railing. The beds had railings along the sides to prevent the residents from falling off. The appellant said that when he turned his head, he saw the victim\u2019s head touching the railing on the left side of the bed. He heard the tapping two to three times. The curtain to Bed 7, in between Beds 7 and 8, was opened at the material time. The appellant stated that he could see that the victim was in pain. He thought that she was asking for some help. He also saw that her pillow was out of place. He then stood up, went to Bed 7 and adjusted her head to the middle of the bed. He then put the pillow under her head. He also took a round pillow from the far side of Bed 7 and placed it on the left side of the victim in between her head and the bed railing so that she would not fall off again. In his hurry, and to reach for the round pillow, the appellant said that he placed his left knee in between the vertical bars of the bed railing on the left. The appellant demonstrated this to the District Judge during a site visit. 18', '19\\u2003Resident JP gave evidence for the defence. She confirmed that her portable television had broken down and that she had asked the appellant to attend to the matter. In this connection, she explained that she could not switch on her television, the adaptor was dislodged and she could not receive Channel 8 programmes on her television. During cross-examination, Resident JP clarified that the problem relating to power was that the adaptor was always loose and she had difficulty attaching it firmly to the power cable of her television because of her disability. Once the adaptor was firmly attached, there would be power to the television. 19', '20\\u2003Apart from his explanation as to what transpired on the day of the offence, the appellant also suggested in his defence that Nurse MJ might have held a grudge against him. The appellant explained that there were accusations of him having told Nurse MJ\u2019s landlord not to provide accommodation for Nurse MJ and her flatmates. The appellant also related another incident where Nurse MJ and her friend had dropped certain fruits and vegetables on the floor. He had told them that he would have to clean up after them, and there was an exchange of words between the appellant, and Nurse MJ and her friends. The appellant said that Nurse MJ looked annoyed. At the trial, the appellant further suggested that there was a bad working relationship between him and his supervisor. Nurse MJ and his supervisor thus sought to blow up the issue. 20'"}

GOSH owned six vessels that it chartered to one Oceanogafia S.A. de C.V. (\u201cOSA\u201d) which were then sub-chartered to the national oil company of Mexico, \u201cPEMEX\u201d. The second defendant funded the purchase of the vessels and took security over them.', '8\\u2003In May 2013, the second defendant and OSA experienced tensions in their working relationship due to OSA\u2019s failure to make certain payments. Sometime in May 2013, Grupo Pegaso was invited by a Mexican governmental agency to attend a meeting. Grupo Pegaso was represented at the meeting by Mr Orva\u00f1anos and the chairman of Grupo Pegaso, Mr Alejandro Burillo Azcarraga (\u201cMr Burillo\u201d). 5', 'Also at the meeting was Pepe, as the \u201cliaison\u201d 6', 'of the second defendant. It was alleged by Mr Orva\u00f1anos that at that meeting, Pepe explained the situation to him and suggested that Grupo Pegaso might be able to replace OSA as the defendants\u2019 business partners. Pepe also suggested that Grupo Pegaso invest in two rigs that were being constructed by the first defendant and charter those rigs to PEMEX. 7', '9\\u2003Following the meeting, Mr Orva\u00f1anos met with Capt Seow, who represented the first defendant, in Singapore in August 2013. The parties exchanged comments on the draft Rig Purchase Agreement throughout August 2013 and on 29 August 2013, one Mr Tang Ying Kee of the first defendant (\u201cMr Tang\u201d) sent Mr Orva\u00f1anos the basic technical specifications of a CJ-46 Jack-Up Rig, which was the type of rig that was to be built. 8', '10\\u2003On 30 August 2013, Capt Seow followed up on Mr Tang\u2019s email with his own comments about the specifications of the rigs which were to be included in the Rig Purchase Agreement. This email formed the basis of the plaintiffs\u2019 allegation of misrepresentation and thus it is helpful to set out the relevant parts of the email in full: 9', '11\\u2003On the same day, Mr Orva\u00f1anos and Capt Seow signed the Rig Purchase Agreement on behalf of the first plaintiff and the first defendant respectively. 10', 'The Rig Purchase Agreement provided that the first plaintiff would purchase two rigs from the first defendant and that a deposit of US$1m would be paid to the first defendant for each rig, for a total sum of US$2m. The Rig Purchase Agreement also provided that the parties would endeavour to enter into the subsequent Shipbuilding Contracts, although it made provision for the possibility that the Shipbuilding Contracts would not be executed. The relevant clauses, which I reproduce here, provided in essence that the deposit would only be forfeited by the first defendant if the failure to execute the Shipbuilding Contracts could be attributed to the first plaintiff:', '12\\u2003Following the execution of the Rig Purchase Agreement, the parties continued to negotiate the terms of the Shipbuilding Contracts. On 3 September 2013, Capt Seow sent the draft Shipbuilding Contracts to Mr Orva\u00f1anos for his comments. 11', 'Mr Orva\u00f1anos replied, stating that he had sent the drafts to the legal counsel of the plaintiffs for review, and that Capt Seow would be kept informed regarding any progress as well as with their questions and comments. 12', 'It was not disputed that there was no direct reply to this email, in the sense that Mr Orva\u00f1anos did not send back the draft Shipbuilding Contracts with any appended comments or edits, although his evidence was that he had given feedback to both Pepe orally and to Capt Seow by way of subsequent emails in November 2013, in which he addressed certain issues relating to the terms upon which the Shipbuilding Contracts would be entered into (see [17]\u2013[18] below).', '13\\u2003On 10 September 2013, the actual specifications of the rigs to be built were sent to Mr Orva\u00f1anos, which is to be contrasted with the basic specifications that had previously been sent by Mr Tang (see [9] above). Upon receipt of the specifications, Mr Orva\u00f1anos asked Capt Seow for additional time to review the specifications, because although the Rig Purchase Agreement envisaged that the first plaintiff would review the said specifications and revert to the first defendant by 13 September 2013, the actual specifications were sent to Mr Orva\u00f1anos far too close to the deadline. Capt Seow acceded to this request, extending the deadline for the review of the specifications of the rigs to 24 September 2013. 13', '14\\u2003This delay in sending the specifications also had an impact on the subsequent deadlines under the Rig Purchase Agreement, in particular the deadline for the execution of the Shipbuilding Contracts, which was 6 October 2013 subject to a long-stop deadline of 16 October 2013 (see cl 3.1 at [11] above). Thus, on 26 September 2013, Capt Seow agreed to extend the deadline for the execution of the Shipbuilding Contracts from 16 October 2013 to 30 October 2013. 14', '15\\u2003In addition, during this period, the first plaintiff began to look for a partner who was willing to provide funds for the first plaintiff\u2019s purchase of the rigs. A company known as Perforadora Latina (\u201cCP Latina\u201d) expressed interest in funding the purchase 15', 'and thus representatives from CP Latina visited the shipyard where the rigs were being constructed on 24 September 2013 in order to ascertain whether it was willing to fund the purchase of the rigs. The construction of the rigs, however, was not satisfactory to CP Latina for a variety of reasons. In order to assuage its concerns, CP Latina requested a formal inspection and the commissioning of a report by a marine surveying company known as Noble Denton. It appears that CP Latina\u2019s need for a formal report also contributed to the extension of the deadline for the execution of the Shipbuilding Contracts.', '16\\u2003Noble Denton issued its report on 17 October 2013. The findings in the report were not entirely favourable to the first defendant, highlighting in particular that the construction of the rigs might not be completed on time and that the rigs as constructed might not be to PEMEX\u2019s specifications. 16', 'CP Latina decided not to participate in the rig purchase project. Mr Orva\u00f1anos then requested from Capt Seow and was granted an additional extension of the deadline for the execution of the Shipbuilding Contracts, this time until 31 December 2013. 17', '17\\u2003On 7 November 2013, Mr Orva\u00f1anos met Pepe to discuss the progress towards the Shipbuilding Contracts, which discussion was summarised in an email that Pepe sent to Capt Seow later that day. 18', 'According to the email, Pepe informed Mr Orva\u00f1anos during the discussion that the defendants had an \u201cinteresting offer by a third party to buy the two platforms [ie, the rigs]\u201d and that the rigs could, at any time, be sold to this third party. In response to this, Mr Orva\u00f1anos stated that the first plaintiff was willing to finalise the Shipbuilding Contracts if the first defendant was willing to address the concerns that it had regarding the construction of the rigs up to that point, which were presumably the same concerns that had been revealed by the Noble Denton report. In particular, Mr Orva\u00f1anos was said to have proposed the following conditions:', '(a)\\u2003that there would be a discount of US$5m on the purchase price of each rig, for a total discount of US$10m;', '(b)\\u2003that the issues in the Noble Denton report relating to the quality of the rigs and the time of delivery would need to be addressed; and', '(c)\\u2003that any penalties that PEMEX would impose on the first plaintiff for any late delivery would be borne by the first defendant.', '18\\u2003On 13 November 2013, Mr Orva\u00f1anos wrote directly to Capt Seow by email, proposing the same conditions that Pepe had already informed Capt Seow about in the email of 7 November 2013. Mr Orva\u00f1anos sought Capt Seow\u2019s comments on the proposal and confirmed that the first plaintiff had \u201cimmense interest and responsibility towards this project\u201d. 19', '19\\u2003I should note at this point that the meeting of 7 November 2013 and the email of 13 November 2013 formed a large part of the dispute between the parties. As will be elaborated on below, I found that Capt Seow never replied to this email. The defendants took the position that any silence on his part was indicative of a rejection of the proposal, especially because the terms proposed were, in Capt Seow\u2019s words, \u201cridiculous\u201d. In contrast, the plaintiffs\u2019 position was that Capt Seow\u2019s silence meant that he had failed to take the appropriate steps towards the execution of the Shipbuilding Contracts. The plaintiffs also relied on the discussion on 7 November 2013 and the email of 13 November 2013 as constituting the \u201cfeedback\u201d that Mr Orva\u00f1anos gave to Capt Seow and\/or Pepe in relation to the draft Shipbuilding Contracts sent on 3 September 2013 (see [12] above).', '20\\u2003Turning back to the negotiation of the Shipbuilding Contracts between the parties, on 27 December 2013, Mr Orva\u00f1anos emailed Capt Seow, suggesting that they meet to find a way to move forward with the negotiations. Capt Seow replied on 30 December 2013, stating that his schedule had not been finalised and that if Mr Orva\u00f1anos planned to travel to Singapore to meet, it would be best done \u201cbefore 20th Jan, or after 1st week of March\u201d. 20', 'It is noteworthy that even though the deadline for the execution of the Shipbuilding Contracts was 31 December 2013, which was the very next day, Capt Seow made no mention of this and appeared willing to discuss the matter in January 2014, at which time the deadline for the execution of the Shipbuilding Contracts would have passed.', '21\\u2003Mr Orva\u00f1anos and Capt Seow eventually met on 24 January 2014. While the parties dispute what precisely was said during this meeting, it was clear that after this meeting, both Mr Orva\u00f1anos and Capt Seow were aware that the Shipbuilding Contracts would no longer be executed and that both parties would move on from this project. In particular, Mr Orva\u00f1anos took the position that during the meeting, Capt Seow had assured him that the US$2m deposit could be put into another investment, this time with the second defendant, either by the plaintiffs investing in its subsidiaries directly or in a vessel that was owned by the second defendant through its subsidiaries. 21', '22\\u2003In the months following the meeting in January 2014, the parties negotiated a potential investment by the second plaintiff in one of the Mexican companies owned by the second defendant, GOSH or SMP, or in a vessel owned by the second defendant through these subsidiaries. In particular, in April 2014, Mr Orva\u00f1anos and the 2nd defendant\u2019s employee Mr Jeffrey Phang (\u201cMr Phang\u201d) began discussing the details pertaining to a term sheet, which was to be a precursor to the final investment by the plaintiffs into either GOSH or SMP \u2013 or both. 22', '23\\u2003By the beginning of July 2014, it appeared that the draft term sheet was close to being finalised. On 9 July 2014, Mr Orva\u00f1anos and Capt Seow had an oral conversation about the detailed terms of the investment. While there was no contemporaneous record of what had been raised by both parties during this conversation, it appears that Capt Seow had stated, or at least intimated, that the US$2m deposit that had been paid pursuant to the Rig Purchase Agreement could be used to offset part of the acquisition price of whichever company the plaintiffs eventually chose to invest in. This can be seen from an email that was sent by Mr Granada Ramirez Diego Julian (\u201cMr Ramirez\u201d) of the plaintiffs to Mr Phang later that day, referencing the conversation between the two, albeit in passing: 23', 'While Mr Ramirez does not specifically refer to Capt Seow, it was not disputed that the reference to \u201cone of [the defendant\u2019s] principals\u201d who spoke to Mr Orva\u00f1anos was a reference to Capt Seow.', '24\\u2003On 10 July 2014, Mr Phang replied to this email. He explained that the proposed inclusion of such a term in the term sheet would not be feasible, because while SMP was the subject of the proposed investment, it was not a party to the initial Rig Purchase Agreement pursuant to which the US$2m deposit had been paid. However, Mr Phang expressed his confidence that the $2m would still be returned, albeit upon the satisfaction of two conditions: 24', 'As can be seen from the extract, the two conditions were that the plaintiffs had to invest in SMP and that the rigs, which were previously to be bought by the first plaintiff, would have to be sold to a third party and full payment received.', '25\\u2003Mr Orva\u00f1anos replied on the same day, acknowledging the difficulty and asking Mr Phang how the latter wished to \u201cdocument the return of the US$2MM\u201d in the light of the difficulty that had been raised. Mr Phang proposed that, subject to confirmation, the parties could \u201cperhaps sign a side letter between Grupo Pegaso and PaxOcean\u201d, 25', 'to which Mr Orva\u00f1anos agreed and asked Mr Phang to inform him if there were further updates. 26', '26\\u2003On 11 July 2014, Capt Seow sent an email to Mr Orva\u00f1anos, apparently providing the update that had been sought by Mr Orva\u00f1anos\u2019 previous email, and expressed the defendants\u2019 position as follows: 27', '27\\u2003I have set out the relevant parts of this email in full because it formed a critical plank of both parties\u2019 cases. The plaintiffs contended that this email, coupled with the oral conversation of 9 July 2014, showed that there was a legally binding agreement between the parties to return the sum of US$2m, although I should note that the plaintiffs\u2019 case was that despite the wording of this email, the successful sale of the rigs was not a condition precedent to the return of the deposit. In contrast, the defendants took the position that this email showed that any indication that they would refund the sum of US$2m was purely a gesture of goodwill and did not create any legally binding obligations.', '28\\u2003Mr Orva\u00f1anos replied on the same day, thanking Capt Seow for his proposal and stating that the parties would \u201cstructure the refund as [Capt Seow] propose[d]\u201d. 28', '29\\u2003Pursuant to this discussion, the term sheet relating to the second plaintiff\u2019s investment was signed on 14 July 2014. The parties continued to discuss the details of the plaintiffs\u2019 investment in the Mexican companies owned by the second defendant, this time relating to the purchase of a 35% interest in GOSH. On 27 August 2014, Mr Orva\u00f1anos had separate telephone conversations with both Pepe and Capt Seow in relation to the investment. The details of what Mr Orva\u00f1anos had discussed with Capt Seow were recorded in the following email that was later sent by Capt Seow to Mr Orva\u00f1anos: 29', '30\\u2003As regards Mr Orva\u00f1anos\u2019 discussion with Pepe, it appears that Pepe had subsequently briefed Capt Seow on the contents of the discussion, which is why Capt Seow sent a follow-up email to Mr Orva\u00f1anos that same day, reassuring the latter that what was discussed with Pepe did not differ from the discussions as recorded in the earlier email: 30', '31\\u2003The plaintiffs relied on these emails from Capt Seow to Mr Orva\u00f1anos as evidence of a variation of the contract concluded on 9 or 11 July 2014 to the effect that the US$2m deposit would be returned regardless of whether the plaintiffs chose to invest in any of the Mexican companies.', '32\\u2003Eventually, however, the plaintiffs decided to go ahead with the investment. On 29 August 2014, Mr Orva\u00f1anos, on behalf of the plaintiffs, made a proposal for the purchase of 35% interest in GOSH. Inter alia, the terms proposed were that the 35% interest in GOSH would be immediately purchased and that the acquisition price would be offset by using the US$2m deposit; the remaining terms would be as reflected in the term sheet dated 14 July 2014.', '33\\u2003To the plaintiffs\u2019 surprise, Capt Seow replied the same day rejecting the proposal as it did not \u201creflect the intrinsic value of the assets and its potential\u201d. However, Capt Seow confirmed that the defendants would nevertheless reimburse the US$2m, which was in line with the position that had been expressed in the emails dated 27 August 2014: 31', '34\\u2003Pursuant to these emails, on 2 October 2014, Mr Orva\u00f1anos sent a draft refund agreement to Capt Seow. 32', 'In the draft agreement, it was first noted that the Rig Purchase Agreement had been terminated \u201cwithout penalty to either party\u201d. The draft agreement then proceeded to set out the terms of the refund: 33', '(a)\\u2003the US$2m deposit would be refunded in two tranches, one no later than 31 January 2015 and the other no later than 30 June 2015; and', '(b)\\u2003if the refund was not timeously paid, interest would be levied at 12% per annum.', '35\\u2003Capt Seow replied on the same day refusing to sign the draft refund agreement. In his view, there was \u201cno need for another agreement\u201d because he had already given his word on the matter, although he noted that the defendants were under no obligation to reimburse the plaintiffs. It is again helpful to set out the email in full: 34', '36\\u2003Although the draft refund agreement was not signed, it appears that Mr Orva\u00f1anos proceeded on the basis that the two deadlines of January and June 2015 as mentioned in the draft refund agreement would apply. Thus, on 14 May 2015, when no such payment had been made by the defendants, Mr Orva\u00f1anos emailed Capt Seow once more to ask about the return of the US$2m deposit: 35', '37\\u2003The context to this email is that on 23 March 2015, Capt Seow had informed Mr Orva\u00f1anos that the sale of the two rigs, which was originally slated for January and June 2015 (see the email reproduced at [33] above), would be delayed by up to nine months. 36', 'Thus, it appears from the email that Mr Orva\u00f1anos had taken the position that the deadlines for the two tranches of payments would similarly be extended by about nine months each, to September 2015 and March 2016 respectively.', '38\\u2003In May and June 2015, Mr Orva\u00f1anos attempted to \u201cre-confirm\u201d with Capt Seow that the parties had an agreement in place by which the sum of US$2m would be repaid in two tranches in September 2015 and March 2016, 37', 'whereas Capt Seow repeatedly stated in his email replies that the defendants had offered to repay the sum of $2m even though it was not contractually obliged to do so. 38', '39\\u2003On 17 February 2017, the plaintiffs filed the present suit seeking to recover the sum of US$2m.'"}

Therefore, I shall only reproduce the salient facts which are necessary for an appreciation of the issues relating to sentence in this appeal.', '7\\u2003In order to better understand how the fatal accident occurred, I consider it helpful to first describe how the testing and calibration of the ARS machine was to take place.', '8\\u2003The ARS machine is used for the detection of faults in cables by sending high voltage electrical pulses into the cables. It can rapidly charge up to 1,280 joules at up to 16 kilovolts (\u201ckV\u201d). By way of comparison, the standard voltage used in households in Singapore is 220V. A pictorial representation of the set up for the testing and calibration of the ARS machine is shown below:', '', '9\\u2003The person controlling the ARS machine would set the machine to a certain voltage level. Another person would then have to hold the handle of the high voltage probe and touch the tip of the probe to the metallic part at the end of the output cable from the ARS machine. The high voltage probe is in turn connected to a multimeter which will display the voltage measured. The voltage as measured by the multimeter when multiplied by a certain fixed factor, which is a characteristic of the high voltage probe, will provide the value of the voltage actually emanating from the ARS machine. The voltage measurements will then be recorded, and the process is subsequently repeated with the ARS machine set to increasing levels of voltage.', '10\\u2003On 7 November 2013, Wheeler instructed Suman to conduct testing and calibration of the ARS machine. In turn, Suman asked three of his colleagues to assist him, namely Mr Gomathi Nayagam Lakshmi Kanthan (\u201cLakshmi\u201d), Mr Kuberan Nandhakumar (\u201cNandha\u201d) and Mr Murugesan Senthil (\u201cSenthil\u201d).', '11\\u2003The testing and calibration was conducted inside the laboratory located at 196 Pandan Loop, #02-21, which is the workplace of the appellant. Suman prepared for the testing of the ARS machine by setting up the equipment according to the diagram as shown at [8] above. 1', 'Suman then instructed Lakshmi to power up the ARS machine and then set the machine to the desired voltage level for testing. He instructed Senthil to record the readings from the multimeter while Nandha was instructed to be on standby. Suman held the handle of the high voltage probe with his left hand, and the output cable from the ARS machine with his right hand. The tip of the high voltage probe was securely attached to a metallic vise grip protruding from the end of the output cable.', '12\\u2003Suman and his three colleagues then began the testing and calibration of the ARS machine, starting with a voltage level of 2kV and gradually working their way to higher voltage levels. When the voltage of the ARS machine was set to 12kV, Nandha noticed a spark emanating from the metallic vise grip. At this point, Suman fell backwards and became unconscious. He was conveyed to the hospital where he succumbed to his injuries that same day. The certified cause of death was consistent with electrocution.', '13\\u2003The Judge found that there was a high risk of electrocution in conducting the high voltage testing and calibration, which the appellant\u2019s employees were all well aware of. 2', 'Despite this, the appellant had failed to take reasonably practicable measures in order to avert this risk of electrocution. 3', '14\\u2003First, there had been no proper risk assessments conducted for the activity of high voltage testing and calibration. When officers from the Ministry of Manpower (\u201cMOM\u201d) first visited the appellant\u2019s premises on 16 April 2013, the appellant\u2019s representative at the time was not able to produce any risk assessment forms for electrical testing within the company. Even the risk assessment conducted by the appellant on 25 April 2013 in response to the visit from the MOM officers was unsatisfactory. That risk assessment form, which was dated 25 April 2013, showed that for the work activity of \u201ccalibration\u201d, the only risk identified was that of \u201cfalling objects\u201d and there was no mention of electrocution. The appellant\u2019s employee who had signed off on this risk assessment form admitted to not knowing if the activity referred to on the form was high or low voltage calibration. The MOM officer who inspected the appellant\u2019s premises a day after the accident occurred testified that the risk assessment for the calibration works was not established, conducted and implemented. 4', 'Wheeler conceded that there were no risk assessments conducted for the ARS machine when it arrived at the appellant\u2019s workplace on three previous occasions for testing and calibration. 5', '15\\u2003Second, the appellant had failed to put in place safe work procedures to ensure that the testing and calibration of the ARS machine was carried out in a safe manner. The appellant could not adduce any evidence of safe work procedures it had developed for the calibration of the ARS machine. 6', 'An officer from the Energy Market Authority who conducted an investigation of the workplace after the accident testified that one reasonably practicable measure that could have been taken would be to have proper test fixtures to hold the output cable in place during the calibration process. 7', 'Without the test fixture, the person operating the probe had to physically hold onto the output cable. This was dangerous because the output cable would be left dangling and could accidentally come into contact with the person holding the cable. Further, a safe working distance would not be maintained between the holder of the probe and the live output cable. Given the high voltages at which the testing was conducted, even the air between the output cable and the person holding it could become a conductor which would enable the current to pass from the output cable and into the person\u2019s body, thereby leading to electrocution. Hence, a test fixture was necessary as it could have prevented the output cable from swinging, and would also have allowed the person holding the high voltage probe to maintain a safe distance from the output cable. 8', 'Up to this point, I agree with the Judge\u2019s findings.', '16\\u2003 The Judge also noted that a stand made of steel was actually available, but it was not used during the calibration. 9', 'The Judge stated that if the appellant had developed a risk assessment for the calibration, \u201cthe use of a stand would have been stated as a mitigating factor\u201d. I disagree with the Judge that (a) the steel stand that was available in the workshop should be used; and (b) that the use of this stand would have been a mitigating factor to reduce the risk associated with the calibration.', '17\\u2003Wheeler had rightly explained at the hearing that using the steel stand might have made matters worse, given that the entire stand is made of metal and would therefore have been fully charged if the live output cable had been attached to it. I agree with Wheeler that attaching the vise grip to a metal stand would have charged the whole metal stand to the same high voltage as that on the metal vise grip which was attached to the end of the output cable of the ARS machine. Making a much larger exposed metal area (ie, the metal stand) charged to a high voltage would cause the work area to be much more dangerous to persons present at the workplace in the vicinity of the large exposed metal area. To increase safety, exposed areas with high voltage should instead be minimised as much as possible and not increased. As a safety measure, employees should therefore be told not to use the metal stand available in the work place and not to attach the vise grip to any metal stand for any high voltage testing and calibration.', '18\\u2003In my view, the appellant should have provided a non-electrically conductive stand (eg, one made of rubber or some other non-electrically conductive material) to which the vise grip could be attached in order to ensure and facilitate the safe high voltage testing and calibration of the ARS machine. The appellant had failed to provide an essential piece of equipment to its employees to enable them to carry out such high voltage testing and calibration safely. This would have contributed to the appellant\u2019s failure to ensure safe work procedures.', '19\\u2003Ultimately, the Judge rightly concluded that the appellant\u2019s failure to ensure that safe work procedures were adopted during the testing and calibration of the ARS machine resulted in Suman being electrocuted which led to his death.'"}

Under this proposal, the first defendant was to transfer the entire business of the C&E division to a new legal entity. 14', 'The intention was that the first defendant would own 60% of the new entity and the management team would own the remaining 40%.', '10\\u2003In 2002, the first defendant nominated the second defendant to be the legal entity to be the transferee of the C&E division.

First, the plaintiff and Mr Chakraborty were appointed directors of the second defendant. 16', 'Second, the plaintiff was appointed the second defendant\u2019s managing director. Third, the management team paid the first defendant the sum of $200,000 as a deposit against the price of the shares in the second defendant which the first defendant intended to transfer to them, 17', 'with the balance to be paid when the actual transfer took place. 18', 'And finally, the parties agreed that, even though the management team held no shares in the second defendant at that time, the team\u2019s entitlement to 40% of the second defendant\u2019s profits would take effect from 1 April 2002. 19', '13\\u2003From 1 April 2002 and into 2003, the first defendant and the management team continued to negotiate the terms of the team\u2019s participation in the second defendant.

But, as agreed in 2002 (see [11] above), the Agreement records expressly that the management team\u2019s entitlement to 40% of the second defendant\u2019s profits had taken effect on 1 April 2002. 27', '18\\u2003The Agreement provides expressly that the second defendant\u2019s board is to comprise five directors, with three directors nominated by the first defendant and two directors drawn from the management team. 28', 'The Agreement names Mr Wong as one of the three directors nominated by the first defendant. It also names the plaintiff and Mr Chakraborty as the two directors to be drawn from the management team. In addition, the Agreement expressly provides that the plaintiff is to hold office as the second defendant\u2019s managing director.', '19\\u2003Giving effect to these provisions of the Agreement did not require any changes to the second defendant\u2019s board. The plaintiff and Mr Chakraborty had already been appointed directors on 1 April 2002. 29', 'The evidence also shows that they have held these positions uninterrupted from 1 April 2002 to the date of these proceedings. 30', 'And Mr Wong had been a director of the second defendant even before 1 April 2002.', '20\\u2003One of the matters which the Agreement expressly envisaged was that the second defendant would incorporate a subsidiary in India to carry on the controls business there. 31', 'The second defendant eventually did establish this subsidiary and eventually did expand its controls business to India. The status of the Indian subsidiary has become a bone of contention between the parties.', '21\\u2003In 2006, the parties to the Agreement entered into a share sale agreement (\u201cthe SSA\u201d). 32', 'The SSA was meant to restructure the second defendant\u2019s shareholding for tax and accounting purposes. It was not the purpose of the SSA to alter the terms of the parties\u2019 collaboration underlying the Agreement.', '22\\u2003Under the SSA, the management team collectively transferred 300,000 shares in the second defendant, representing 18.75% of its shares, back to the first defendant in exchange for a payment of just over $465,000. 33', 'As a result of the transfer: (i) the first defendant\u2019s shareholding in the second defendant increased from 60% to 78.75%; (ii) the plaintiff\u2019s shareholding fell from 25% to 15.625%; (iii) Mr Chakraborty\u2019s shareholding fell to 3.75%; (iv) Mr Gopakumar\u2019s shareholding fell to 1.875%; and (v) Mr Sundaram sold all his shares back to the first defendant and exited entirely as a shareholder of the second defendant, although he remained an employee. 34', '23\\u2003 Because the SSA was not intended to have any effect on the parties\u2019 collaboration underlying the Agreement, the management team (save for Mr Sundaram) 35', 'continued to be entitled to participate in the profits of the second defendant based on their original shareholding, as though the SSA had never been entered into. 36', 'So too each transferor (save for Mr Sundaram) had an option to buy back the shares he had transferred to the first defendant at the very same price which the first defendant had paid for the shares in 2006, ie regardless of any subsequent appreciation in the value of the shares. 37', '24\\u2003Thus, for example, the plaintiff received $290,781 from the first defendant under the SSA in exchange for a transfer of a 9.375% stake in the second defendant. 38', 'Under the SSA, he had an option to repurchase that 9.375% stake at exactly the same price, ie $290,781, which was exercisable before the second defendant could deal otherwise with that shareholding. For that reason, I shall continue to refer to the plaintiff as having a notional 25% shareholding in the second defendant, even after the share transfers under the SSA were implemented. And I shall also refer to the value of the plaintiff\u2019s 25% shareholding without taking into consideration his obligation to repay $290,781 to the first defendant.', '25\\u2003The plaintiff was due to retire from the second defendant\u2019s employment on 1 April 2017, at or around the time he turned 70 years of age. It appears that his retirement had been postponed from 2009, when he turned 62 years of age and would otherwise have had to retire. 39', 'In August 2014, Mr Wong Yu Loon and the plaintiff agreed to a succession plan for the plaintiff. 40', 'According to the plaintiff, the key features of the plan were as follows:', '(a)\\u2003From 1 October 2014, the first defendant would appoint a managing director designate for the second defendant, to take over from the plaintiff as the second defendant\u2019s managing director from 1 April 2015.', '(b)\\u2003For the two-year period from 1 April 2015 to 31 March 2017, the plaintiff would cease to be the second defendant\u2019s managing director. Instead, he would be employed under a new contract as the second defendant\u2019s Executive Chairman. He would no longer have day-to-day management responsibilities for the second defendant. His pay and working hours were also to be reduced.', '(c)\\u2003The first defendant would purchase the plaintiff\u2019s 25% shareholding in the second defendant.', '26\\u2003On the third element of the succession plan, the plaintiff\u2019s evidence is that it was agreed that the first defendant would buy the plaintiff\u2019s shares in the second defendant and it was understood that the first defendant would do so before the plaintiff\u2019s employment as its Executive Chairman came to an end. The defendants deny that the third element was agreed in any sense. I make no finding on any of the points relating to the third element, as that is wholly irrelevant to the matter which I have to decide on this application. But it is fair to say that the parties did agree to engage in negotiations with a view to reaching terms for the first defendant\u2019s purchase of the plaintiff\u2019s shares in the second defendant in anticipation of his employment with the second defendant ceasing on 31 March 2017.', '27\\u2003As agreed in the succession plan, on 1 October 2014, the plaintiff began the six-month transition period. At the end of those six months, on 1 April 2015, the plaintiff retired as managing director of the second defendant. He was given a two-year employment contract with the second defendant as its Executive Chairman. 41', '28\\u2003Between 2014 and 2016, the plaintiff and Mr Wong discussed directly with each other the value of the plaintiff\u2019s 25% shareholding in the second defendant. 42', 'The plaintiff\u2019s evidence is that one of the methods of valuing his shares in the second defendant which was discussed in August 2014 was a multiple of earnings plus a share of the second defendant\u2019s cash. 43', '29\\u2003In September 2015, Mr Wong suggested valuing the plaintiff\u2019s shares based on the second defendant\u2019s net tangible assets plus a 20% premium. 44', 'The plaintiff rejected that as being too low. He countered that a valuation based on a multiple of earnings plus a share of cash had been discussed in August 2014.', '30\\u2003In April 2016, Mr Loh sent the plaintiff an email containing a valuation of the second defendant on two bases: 45', '(a)\\u2003Net tangible assets plus a premium; and', '(b)\\u2003Five times the average of the past three years\u2019 earning plus a share of the defendant\u2019s cash.', 'Mr Loh\u2019s point was that both methods valued the second defendant at $20m, implying a value of $5m for the plaintiff\u2019s 25% shareholding. On 5 May 2016, the plaintiff rejected Mr Loh\u2019s offer on the basis that $20m was not a fair valuation of the second defendant. 46', 'He noted that Mr Loh himself had expressed the view just a few months earlier that a substantially higher figure of $35m was too low a valuation of the second defendant. The plaintiff also made the point that Mr Loh\u2019s figures had not taken account of: (i) revenue which the second defendant had invoiced but had not yet recognised; (ii) that the second defendant had over-provided in the accounts for bad debts; and (iii) the true value of the second defendant\u2019s wholly-owned Indian subsidiary.', '31\\u2003In February 2017, the first defendant put the plaintiff on notice that his employment contract with the second defendant was due to come to an end on 31 March 2017. 47', 'On 31 March 2017, the plaintiff\u2019s employment contract expired in accordance with its terms. On and from 1 April 2017, the plaintiff ceased to be an employee of the second defendant. 48', '32\\u2003In 2017, the plaintiff and Mr Wong had three meetings to discuss the sale of the plaintiff\u2019s shares to the first defendant. 49', '(a)\\u2003At a meeting in March 2017, the plaintiff\u2019s figure was $7m and Mr Wong\u2019s figure was $5m. Mr Wong also agreed to finalise the acquisition of the plaintiff\u2019s shares by the end of April 2017.', '(b)\\u2003At a meeting in April 2017, Mr Wong brought with him a set of figures which the plaintiff says were most likely prepared by Mr Loh. 50', 'Based on those figures, Mr Wong arrived at a figure of just under $5.7m for the plaintiff\u2019s shares. The plaintiff arrived at a figure of $6.5m.', '(c)\\u2003At their final meeting in July 2017. That meeting ended with Mr Wong writing the following text in his own hand and with both the plaintiff and Mr Wong signing it: 51', '33\\u2003The plaintiff takes the position that, as a result of the document signed at the meeting in July 2017, he has a binding contract with the first defendant under which it is obliged to buy his 25% shareholding in the second defendant at a price of $6m, subject only to the deduction of $290,781 due to the first defendant under the SSA. He also takes the position that the contract contains an implied term that the first defendant would conclude the sale and purchase within a reasonable time after July 2017. The plaintiff takes that reasonable time to be 30 days. 52', 'The first defendant takes the position that it is not obliged to purchase the plaintiff\u2019s shares in the second defendant as alleged or at all.', '34\\u2003As a result, in February 2018, the plaintiff commenced an action against the first defendant in Suit No 146 of 2018 (\u201cS146\u201d) seeking specific performance of the July 2017 contract; alternatively, damages for breach of contract. The first defendant\u2019s defence in S146 is that: (i) the parties did not enter into any contract in July 2017 because the figures proposed were expressly subject to verification; alternatively (ii) even if they did enter into a contract in July 2017, it was induced by misrepresentation by the plaintiff. 53', '35\\u2003In July 2018, the plaintiff and the first defendant attempted to resolve their dispute in S146 through mediation.

He also takes the position that the directorship right prevails over anything to the contrary in the second defendant\u2019s corporate constitution. 58', '39\\u2003As a result, the plaintiff characterises the first defendant\u2019s attempt to remove him as a director of the second defendant as nothing more than an attempt: (i) to put pressure on him in connection with the sale of his shares and his ongoing action in S146 against the first defendant; (ii) to prevent him from having access to financial information about the second defendant which is relevant to a valuation of his shares; and (iii) to stifle the difficult questions which he has been asking of the first and second defendant about the latter\u2019s Indian subsidiary. 59', 'The defendants reject all of this as false and pure speculation. 60', '40\\u2003The plaintiff also complains that the defendants are acting in concert to keep him in the dark about the affairs of the second defendant. 61', 'The defendants reject all of these allegations too. 62', 'They assert that they have provided to him all of the information to which he is entitled as a director and will continue to do so for as long as he remains a director. They further say that they will provide to him all of the information to which he is entitled as a shareholder for as long as he remains a shareholder.', '41\\u2003These allegations and counter-allegations illustrate the animosity and mistrust which has poisoned a harmonious and successful working relationship which endured for decades. But they are ultimately irrelevant to the issue which I have to determine. That issue requires me to do no more than to determine whether plaintiff has the directorship right which he claims.', '42\\u2003On 9 July 2018, the plaintiff\u2019s solicitors wrote to the defendants\u2019 solicitors in S146 putting the defendants on notice that the plaintiff viewed the attempt to remove him at the then-imminent EGM as a breach of the directorship right and asking them to confirm that the first defendant would not vote at the EGM to remove him as a director. The defendants did not give the confirmation.', '43\\u2003As a result, on 10 July 2018, the plaintiff commenced these proceedings.', '44\\u2003In these proceedings, the plaintiff seeks the following two heads of relief: 63', '(a)\\u2003An order restraining the first defendant from voting at any general meeting of the second defendant to remove the plaintiff as a director of the second defendant so long as the plaintiff remains a shareholder of the second defendant;', '(b)\\u2003Alternatively, an order that the defendants (in effect) treat the plaintiff as though he were a director: by giving him the information, furnishing him the documents and providing him the notices to which a director is entitled, even if he were to be removed as a director at any time in the future.', 'The plaintiff has withdrawn his alternative prayer for relief, 64', 'leaving only his primary prayer for a permanent injunction to prevent the second defendant from breaching the plaintiff\u2019s directorship right.', '45\\u2003The plaintiff\u2019s primary prayer is, therefore, the only issue I have to decide.'"}

Following the incorporation of SMSPL, all the employees of MOX and SDPL were transferred to SMSPL. Foreign staff nominally continued to be employed by MOX and SDPL as their employment passes were not transferrable.

This amount was withdrawn by way of 23 cheques for $50,000 each and one cheque for $14,580. All 24 cheques were signed by Patty. The reason for the multiple cheques was that cheques for sums above $50,000 required Edmund\u2019s signature. Patty claimed that these payments were meant to be her gratuity and adjusted pay for the period from January to June 2015. 13', 'Patty further claimed that she subsequently realised she had been overpaid by mistake.

Both sides\u2019 experts also provided the court with two-dimensional (\u201c2D\u201d) and three-dimensional (\u201c3D\u201d) animations reconstructed from AIS and VDR data. 88', 'The 2D animations provide aerial views of the vessels\u2019 movements, while the 3D animations reconstructed the views from the respective bridges of the two vessels.', '65\\u2003In terms of evidential value, these plots and animations are merely demonstrative or illustrative evidence. Their preparation involved interpretation and processing of the AIS and VDR data, and the use of software tools to reconcile data obtained from different sources. The need for reconciliation could arise eg, from the fact that the internal clocks of the various systems generating and recording data may not be showing the same time. The preparation of the animation reconstructions also involved joining static data points together (a process which necessitated some form of interpolation to fill in the gaps between data points). In other words, these plots and reconstructions are expressions of the skill and judgment of the experts in their attempts to render a close approximation of what had occurred based on the way they processed the available data, subject to various margins of error. The court needs to be mindful not to treat the plots and reconstructions as if they are actual aerial photographs or video footages of the event.', '66\\u2003In the present case, there was a dispute between Mr Ellison and Hanjin Ras Laffan\u2019s expert, Captain Bruce Gordon Ewen (\u201cCapt Ewen\u201d), over the accuracy of the plots and animations prepared by Capt Ewen. Mr Ellison explained that Capt Ewen\u2019s plots and animations showed Mt Apo\u2019s position to be 17 to 19 seconds ahead of her position based on GPS data recorded in the VDR. Mr Ellison attributed this shift of 17 to 19 seconds to the methodology adopted by Capt Ewen to deal with the differences between the timestamps appended by the systems generating the AIS messages and the timestamps appended by the systems receiving the AIS messages. 89', 'The matter was discussed extensively at trial, at the end of which I agreed with Mr Ellison. 90', 'What this means is that Capt Ewen\u2019s plots and animations have to be viewed and understood with this 17-to-19-second shift in Mt Apo\u2019s position in mind, while Mr Ellison\u2019s plots and animations can be used without the viewer having to make such mental adjustments.

Capt Rajesh testified that it was at 9:50 am that he decided it was no longer possible to continue following Ocean Sapphire, as Mt Apo was in a crossing situation with Frontier Leader. Mt Apo had to keep clear of Frontier Leader since Mt Apo was the give-way vessel in this crossing situation. Capt Rajesh decided to maintain Mt Apo\u2019s heading. 103', 'Although this point was not mentioned in his AEIC, Capt Rajesh supplemented during cross-examination that it was also at 9:50 am that he made the decision to cross the westbound lane of the TSS. 104', 'At this point, Mt Apo\u2019s speed was 7.8 knots and increasing. 105', '76\\u2003At 9:52 am (C-7), when Frontier Leader was about 0.7 nm from Mt Apo, Capt Rajesh decided to alter course to starboard to keep clear of Frontier Leader. Immediately after giving the helm orders which resulted in a 2 degree change in course to starboard, Capt Rajesh noticed that the Frontier Leader had made a substantial alteration of course to starboard and decided to put the helm amidships to maintain course. 106', 'Mt Apo\u2019s speed at this point was 8.5 knots, but she was beginning to slow down. 107', 'In Capt Rajesh\u2019s view, the crossing situation with Frontier Leader ended by 9:54 am (C-5), when the Frontier Leader cleared the bow of the Mt Apo. 108', 'It was at this point that Mt Apo got into another close quarters situation with a Malaysian navy vessel, RMN 1503, which was travelling westward in the westbound lane near its northern boundary. 109', 'Hanjin Ras Laffan\u2019s movements up to 9:54 am', '77\\u2003 At the material time, Hanjin Ras Laffan was travelling through the Singapore Strait on a westward voyage from South Korea to Qatar. Capt Kim testified that Hanjin Ras Laffan entered Sector 8 of the TSS at about 9:40 am (C-19), and duly reported to the Vessel Traffic Information Service (\u201cVTIS\u201d) of the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (\u201cMPA\u201d) on VHF Channel 14. 110', '78\\u2003Capt Kim testified that it was about 9:45 am (C-14) when he first visually sighted Mt Apo about 4 nm off Hanjin Ras Laffan\u2019s starboard bow. Capt Kim stated that his additional deck officer had acquired Mt Apo on their S-band ARPA radar and reported a closest point of approach (\u201cCPA\u201d) of 0.2 nm and the time to CPA (\u201cTCPA\u201d) of 10 minutes. 111', 'Hanjin Ras Laffan\u2019s speed at this time was about 15 knots, with her engine running full ahead. 112', '79\\u2003Hanjin Ras Laffan then made a number of changes in course and speed in an attempt to overtake Dalian Venture, first on the latter\u2019s port side and then, when a change in course to port by Dalian Venture made that impractical, from its starboard side. 113', '80\\u2003Capt Kim stated that at 9:50 am (C-9), he noted that Mt Apo was gradually turning to port. He therefore assessed that Mt Apo would not cross the TSS ahead of Hanjin Ras Laffan. Hence, at 9:52 am, he had put Hanjin Ras Laffan from full ahead to navigation full. 114', 'However, at 9:53 am (C-6), Capt Kim noticed that the CPA of the Mt Apo to Hanjin Ras Laffan fell to nearly zero and there was a TCPA of about five minutes. 115', 'At this point, Hanjin Ras Laffan\u2019s speed was 12.5 knots. 116', '81\\u2003Capt Rajesh\u2019s evidence is that Mt Apo was at the northern boundary of the westbound lane by 9:54 am. 117', 'Capt Kim\u2019s evidence is that he observed Mt Apo cutting into the westbound lane between 9:53 am and 9:54 am. 118', 'The 2D animation prepared by Capt Ewen shows Mt Apo\u2019s bow touching the northern boundary of the westbound lane at 9:54:21 am, 119', 'while that prepared by Mr Ellison shows Mt Apo\u2019s bow doing so at 9:54:42 am. 120', 'Given my observations at [66] above, I consider the timing taken from Mr Ellison\u2019s 2D animation more reliable. I therefore find that Mt Apo entered the TSS at 9:54 am (C-5), probably during VHF communication between VTIS and Hanjin Ras Laffan from 9:54:27 am to 9:54:55 am 121', 'and before the VHF communication between Hanjin Ras Laffan and Mt Apo commenced at 9:54:57 am. 122', '82\\u2003Mt Apo\u2019s crossing was done at a shallow angle of 32 degrees from the northern boundary of the TSS, 123', 'at the speed of 8 knots. 124', '83\\u2003At 9:53:28 am, VTIS called Mt Apo on the VHF radio to advise her to keep a lookout for three more westbound vessels coming on her port side. 125', 'Mt Apo replied with \u201cOk, thank you ma\u2019am\u201d, to which VTIS responded with \u201cPlease keep good lookout sir, and you cross safely\u201d. 126', 'At 9:54:27 am, VTIS called Hanjin Ras Laffan to inform her that Mt Apo was going eastbound and 1.4 nm away from her, and also to advise Hanjin Ras Laffan to keep a lookout for Mt Apo. 127', 'Capt Kim acknowledged VTIS\u2019 call. He also asked VTIS what Mt Apo\u2019s intentions were, and indicated that he wanted a green-to-green (starboard-to-starboard) passing with Mt Apo. In response, VTIS asked Capt Kim to contact Mt Apo directly. 128', 'This conversation ended at 9:54:55 am.', '84\\u2003Within a couple of seconds after the conversation between VTIS and Hanjin Ras Laffan, Capt Rajesh ordered stop engine. 129', 'Capt Rajesh explained in his AEIC that he did so because it did not appear that the Hanjin Ras Laffan was going to give way. 130', 'Two seconds after Capt Rajesh ordered stop engine, the Hanjin Ras Laffan called Mt Apo on the VHF, as suggested by VTIS. The OOW of Mt Apo, who was also the third officer, responded to Hanjin Ras Laffan\u2019s call on behalf of Mt Apo. The conversation, which I shall refer to as the \u201c9:55 Conversation\u201d, would become a key focus of parties\u2019 submissions. The 9:55 Conversation went as follows: 131', 'Hanjin Ras Laffan: \\u2003Mount Apo. Mount Apo. This is Hanjin Ras Laffan.', 'Mt Apo (OOW): \\u2003\\u2003Yes, Mount Apo, go ahead.', 'Hanjin Ras Laffan: \\u2003This is Hanjin Ras Laffan, what is your intention? Green-to-green, green-to-green.', 'Mt Apo (OOW): \\u2003\\u2003We are now stopped our engine already.', 'Hanjin Ras Laffan: \\u2003\\u2003Are you, are you stopped now, the engine?', 'Mt Apo (OOW): \\u2003\\u2003Yes sir.

However, Capt Rajesh explained in cross-examination that he was merely asking whether, by \u201cgreen-to-green\u201d, Hanjin Ras Laffan meant to say \u201cstarboard-to-starboard\u201d. 137', '(b)\\u2003When Hanjin Ras Laffan asked \u201care you stopped now, the engine?\u201d, Capt Rajesh could be heard saying \u201cyes\u201d in the background. 138', 'This appears to me to be a direction or guidance from Capt Rajesh to the OOW to reply \u201cyes\u201d to Hanjin Ras Laffan\u2019s question.', '(c)\\u2003The 9:55 Conversation lasted a total of 27 seconds.', '87\\u2003The 9:55 Conversation ended at 9:55:24 am. By then, it was less than four minutes before the collision. The distance between the two vessels had closed to less than 1.2 nm. 139', 'Mt Apo, having stopped its engine, had slowed down to 7.8 knots, 140', 'while Hanjin Ras Laffan had slowed down to 12.0 knots. 141', 'Both sides\u2019 experts agreed that, at this point, there were still sufficient time and sufficient sea room for both vessels to avoid a collision. 142', '88\\u2003 After the 9:55 Conversation, both vessels continued reducing their respective speeds incrementally. Hanjin Ras Laffan made a number of minor course adjustments to port. Capt Kim explained that this was to follow behind Dalian Venture and give more space to Mt Apo. 143', 'Mt Apo also altered its heading slightly to starboard. Capt Rajesh explained that this was in order to maintain Mt Apo\u2019s course in the light of the south-westerly current. 144', '89\\u2003At 9:57 am (C-2), Mt Apo called Hanjin Ras Laffan and requested a port-to-port passing. This request was rejected by Hanjin Ras Laffan, and the conversation ended in a mutual agreement to go green-to-green. 145', 'Unlike the earlier conversation which lasted only 27 seconds, this second conversation lasted almost a full minute (from 9:57:03 am to 9:57:59 am). While the second VHF conversation was taking place, Capt Kim moved Hanjin Ras Laffan\u2019s engine from slow to dead slow and altered course to port in an effort to avert collision with the Mt Apo. 146', 'By the time the second VHF conversation ended, it was one minute and 16 seconds before the collision, and the vessels were 0.3 nm apart. Mt Apo\u2019s speed had come down to 6.6 knots, 147', 'while Hanjin Ras Laffan had reduced its speed to 9.8 knots. 148', '90\\u2003Capt Rajesh observed that Hanjin Ras Laffan\u2019s alteration of course to port had caused her stern to swing towards Mt Apo. He thus ordered hard to port shortly before 9:58 am (C-1) to try to avoid Hanjin Ras Laffan. 149', 'Capt Rajesh stated in his AEIC that he gave several astern orders from 9:58 am to 9:59 am to arrest Mt Apo\u2019s forward momentum. However, the VDR records show that Capt Rajesh only gave two astern orders during this period. The first time was when the Chief Officer advised Capt Rajesh: \u201cCaptain we have to run astern\u201d, in response to which Capt Rajesh ordered \u201cput astern\u201d at 9:58:06 am. 150', 'This resulted in the engine telegraph being put first to dead slow astern, then to slow astern and then to half astern. 151', 'The second order was given when the Chief Officer reported to VTIS that Mt Apo was running at half astern. Upon hearing this, Capt Rajesh ordered full astern. 152', 'A mere ten seconds later, Capt Rajesh ordered stop engine. 153', 'The fact that Capt Rajesh ordered \u201cput astern\u201d only after he was reminded by the Chief Officer to do so was captured only in the transcripts provided by Hanjin Ras Laffan and not in the transcripts provided by Mt Apo. I raised this with parties during oral submission. 154', 'Mr Chan told me that his team tried listening to the recording again but did not hear these remarks while Mr Leong told me that Capt Ewen picked up the remarks by listening to the recording with headphones. I listened to the recording myself and confirmed that Capt Ewen was correct.', '91\\u2003At 9:58:57 am (ie, roughly 20 seconds before the collision), Mt Apo called Hanjin Ras Laffan on VHF again to request that Hanjin Ras Laffan go hard to starboard in order to swing her stern away from the Mt Apo to minimise collision impact. 155', 'Capt Kim\u2019s testimony is that he had indeed done so before the collision. 156', 'However, the VDR voice recording did not record any verbal orders from Capt Kim to this effect. 157', 'In fact, VDR records show that Hanjin Ras Laffan\u2019s rudder was not put to starboard until after the collision. 158', '92\\u2003The collision occurred at 9:59:15 am, with Mt Apo\u2019s starboard bow impacting the starboard quarter of Hanjin Ras Laffan. The location of the collision was at Latitude 01\u00b0 14.8\u2019 N, Longitude 103\u00b0 57.7\u2019 E, which was within Singapore territorial waters, about 3.9 nm from the Singapore coast.', '93\\u2003In the unlikely event that there remains any doubt today on whether the breadth of Singapore\u2019s territorial sea is 3 nm or 12 nm, it may be useful to highlight that any uncertainty arising from the decision in Trade Resolve [1999] 2 SLR(R) 107 at [32]\u2013[33] has been put to rest by Government Gazette Notification No 1485 \u2013 \u201cSingapore Maritime Zones\u201d dated 28 May 2008, which provides:', 'In The Fagernes [1927] 1 P 311, the English Court of Appeal took judicial notice of the UK government\u2019s statement on the limits of British territorial waters and treated that statement as conclusive.

In this regard, s 1 of the Maritime Conventions Act 1911 (Cap IA3, 2004 Rev Ed) (\u201cMaritime Conventions Act\u201d) provides:', '95\\u2003Thus the apportionment of liability depends on fault, and s 1(2) of the Maritime Conventions Act makes clear that only causative fault is relevant. Useful guidance on the approach to apportionment of liability is to be found in the following passage from The \u201cNordlake\u201d and The \u201cSeaeagle\u201d [2016] 1 Lloyd\u2019s Rep 656 (\u201cThe Nordlake\u201d) which was cited with approval in The Dream Star [2018] 4 SLR 473 (at [126]):', '96\\u2003Thus the apportionment of liability involves a broad, commonsensical and qualitative assessment of the culpability and causative potency of both vessels.', '97\\u2003As noted by Belinda Ang Saw Ean J in The Dream Star (at [47]\u2013[49]):', '(a)\\u2003Fault refers to a breach of duty of care that caused or contributed to the collision and damage.', '(b)\\u2003For navigational faults, the standard of care applicable is the exercise of \u201cgood seamanship\u201d, which is tantamount to the exercise of reasonable skill or care expected of a competent\/prudent seaman to prevent the vessel from doing injury.', '(c)\\u2003The duty of good seamanship requires the crew of a vessel to observe the COLREGS or local regulations.', '(d)\\u2003The object of the COLREGS is to prevent collisions and to minimise their effect. The COLREGS are made not merely for the sake of the vessel which has to observe them but for the sake of other vessels which may be approaching or manoeuvring at close quarters, and which have every right and reason to suppose that the COLREGS will be observed, and none to suppose they will be broken.', '(e)\\u2003The mere fact that the rules in COLREGS have been broken or that the vessels have not been navigated in a seamanlike manner does not ipso facto give rise to a finding of fault on the part of the breaching party. To give rise to a finding of fault, the breach must have caused or contributed to the collision and damage.'"}

In or around June 2015, the plaintiffs agreed to the establishment of new trusts by the Trustee on behalf of each of the plaintiffs. 13', '10\\u2003In September and October 2015, the Bank issued margin calls totalling USD41.01 million on accounts within the Mandalay Trust. 14', 'The plaintiffs contend that following these margin calls, they discovered misconduct on the part of Mr Lescaudron, in the following manner:', '(a)\\u2003Whilst in the care of the Trustee and the Bank, the value of the Trust Fund had dropped substantially. For example, between December 2014 and September 2015 the value of the Trust fund dropped from USD697.68 million to USD437.8 million and this had prompted the margin calls; 15', '(b)\\u2003The Plaintiffs had been falsely informed of the value of the Trust fund by both the Bank and the Trustee over a prolonged period of time; 16', '(c)\\u2003Instructions given in relation to Trust Assets held in the Soothsayer accounts had been ignored, and the effects of doing so had been actively hidden from the Plaintiffs; 17', '(d)\\u2003Various other wrongdoing had occurred on the accounts containing the Trust Assets, including theft, unauthorised and imprudent trading. 18', 'The wrongdoing related to accounts held in Singapore and elsewhere.', '11\\u2003The Bank filed a criminal complaint against Mr Lescaudron in Geneva in December 2015. 19', 'Mr Lescaudron admitted most of the allegations against him and in February 2018 was convicted of embezzlement, simple and aggravated misappropriation and forgery and sentenced to 5 years in prison. 20', 'Mr Lescaudron has appealed against his sentence. Various complainants in the criminal proceedings, including the Bank, have appealed against the decision to acquit Mr Lescaudron on certain specific charges. The appeals are due to be heard in January 2019.', '12\\u2003The plaintiffs commenced this suit on 25 August 2017. This claim is one framed in the context of losses to the Mandalay Trust, a Singapore trust with a Singapore company as trustee, with the Singapore courts as the forum for the administration of the trust. The plaintiffs claim against the Trustee for failing to take any steps to review or monitor the management of the trust assets. 21', 'Remedies sought against the Trustee include a declaration that the Amended Trust Deed is void, a declaration that the Trustee is liable to account for loss caused to the Mandalay Trust, an account to establish the sums due, equitable compensation to restore the value of the Trust or a declaration to rescind the new trusts, damages for misrepresentation, and damages for negligence. 22', '13\\u2003It is not disputed that the Bank managed the trust assets under a mandate to do so. The plaintiffs claim against the Bank for liability as an agent of the Trustee, as a constructive trustee and trustee de son tort, and for breach of the duties conferred under the Trustees Act. 23', 'In addition to the trust assets which form the subject matter of the claim against the Trustee, the portfolio of assets include that of Mr Ivanishvili and the Wellminstone account. Further, there is a misrepresentation claim brought against the Bank. 24', 'The plaintiffs contend that Mr Lescaudron and others within the Bank misrepresented the value of the trust accounts, in particular during the course of 2014\u20132015. Arising from this, further assets were brought into the management of the bank, including into Mr Ivanishvili\u2019s personal account, the Wellminstone account and a third, Sandcay account. A further negligence claim is made arising from the Bank\u2019s voluntary assumption, by letters in September and October 2015, of an obligation to the plaintiffs to use best efforts to protect the plaintiffs\u2019 portfolio. 25', 'Remedies sought against the Bank include a declaration that the Bank is liable to account for losses to the Mandalay Trust, an account to establish the sums due, an account of profits made by the Bank, equitable compensation to restore the value of the Trust, a declaration to rescind the transfers of the further assets or to return these further assets, damages for misrepresentation, an indemnity for the fees of the new trusts, general damages and exemplary damages. 26', '14\\u2003On 15 November 2017, the Bank and the Trustee filed applications for a stay of the proceedings. Both defendants have undertaken to submit to the jurisdiction of the Swiss courts if the suit is stayed.', '15\\u2003Multiple proceedings involving related parties have arisen in various jurisdictions out of the same series of events.', '16\\u2003Following various criminal complaints filed by the Bank and others (including Mr Ivanishvili and Meadowsweet) in Switzerland, criminal charges were brought against Mr Lescaudron. Mr Ivanishvili filed a civil adhesive claim against Mr Lescaudron as well. 27', 'After trial of the matter, Mr Lescaudron was convicted on some of the charges for fraud, criminal mismanagement and forgery. He was sentenced to 5 years\u2019 imprisonment and was ordered to pay the Bank damages in the sum of more than USD130 million. Various assets of Mr Lescaudron were confiscated and allocated to the Bank so that the latter may use the assets to reimburse the clients who were affected by the fraudulent transfers. The Bank, Mr Lescaudron and other customers have appealed against various parts of the decision.', '17\\u2003At present, there is no criminal indictment laid against the Bank in Switzerland. The Public Prosecutor of Geneva issued a Disjoinder Order and Refusal of Investigative Measures Order on 7 June 2017 which in effect separated the criminal proceedings against Mr Lescaudron from those against the Bank so that the former could proceed first. 28', '18\\u2003Mr Ivanishvili has discontinued his civil adhesive action in Switzerland. The plaintiffs have not filed a suit against the Bank or the Trustee in Switzerland.', '19\\u2003On 24 October 2016, the Plaintiffs entered into a representation agreement with the Trustee and Meadowsweet to authorise the Plaintiff to act on behalf of Meadowsweet to sue the Bank in the courts of Zurich and\/or Geneva and\/or any such other court for breach of contract and wilful misconduct to claim for losses relating to the Meadowsweet and CS Life Meadowsweet accounts. 29', 'It also authorises the plaintiffs to act on behalf of Meadowsweet to sue CS Life in Bermuda for losses relating to its failure to prudently invest and\/or monitor investment of premiums paid.', '20\\u2003A similar representation agreement was entered into in relation to the Green Vals Trust which also suffered losses from this series of events. Pursuant to this representation agreement, the Plaintiffs have conduct of the claims that may be pursued by Sandcay, the special purpose vehicle under the Green Vals Trust.', '21\\u2003The Plaintiffs commenced suit in New Zealand on 7 August 2017 in respect of losses suffered by the Green Vals Trust. 30', 'Claims were made against the Bank as well as the initial and existing trustees for losses which arose from the alleged wrongful acts of Mr Lescaudron. The causes of action are not completely identical to the Singapore suit even though there are substantial similarities in terms of the factual matrix. Both the Bank and the initial trustees were served out of jurisdiction while the existing trustees were served within jurisdiction. The New Zealand High Court found that Switzerland was the most appropriate forum for the case to be tried and dismissed the claims against the Bank and the initial trustees and ordered a stay of proceedings for the claims against the existing trustees. 31', 'This decision is pending appeal.', '22\\u2003The grounds of decision of Justice Venning, Chief High Court Judge of the High Court of New Zealand, Ivanishvili v Credit Suisse AG [2018] NZHC 1755, dated 17 July 2018, were relied on by both sides in argument. 32', 'There are various differentiating factors between that litigation and the present case. From 2012 to 2014 the trust was governed by Prince Edward Island law. It was only from 1 July 2014 that a New Zealand trust company became the trustee and after 1 July 2014 New Zealand law became the governing law of the trust. The \u201cDeed of Appointment and Retirement\u201d, which made the change, itself was governed by Prince Edward Island law. Neither the Bank, who does not provide private banking services in New Zealand, nor the trustee prior to 2014, a Canadian company with no connection with New Zealand, were resident in jurisdiction in New Zealand. They were served out of jurisdiction without leave. Whilst there are some similarities in arguments made, there are also important points of difference.', '23\\u2003Proceedings in Bermuda were filed on 17 August 2017 by the Plaintiffs, Meadowsweet and Sandcay against CS Life pursuant to the representation agreements. 33', 'The central issue in that suit is the conduct of CS Life, and the plaintiffs have undertaken that they will not seek to recover in this suit any losses recovered in Bermuda but give credit for any recovery obtained. 34', 'There is no application to stay the Bermuda proceedings.'"}

Instead, the only sums which were ever paid into the third defendant\u2019s Credit Suisse account were the $1m from the plaintiffs under the Autostyle investment and another sum of $1m from another defrauded investor. 47', '28\\u2003Also in 2013, the second plaintiff was introduced to the fourth defendant. 48', 'The introduction was effected through a business associate of the second plaintiff. 49', 'The fourth defendant was trying to win over the second plaintiff\u2019s business associate as a new private banking client for Credit Suisse. He viewed the second plaintiff as the business associate\u2019s trusted \u201cgatekeeper\u201d and informal adviser.

The Autostyle investment was a fraudulent scheme from beginning to end, and is one for which the first, second and third defendants are all culpable in the tort of deceit.', '35\\u2003I arrive at that conclusion partly because of the large number of unusual features about the draft documentation attached to the fourth defendant\u2019s email of 24 February 2014.

The draft Note refers to a \u201cTerm deposit of SINGAPORE Dollars\u201d for a \u201c12 calendar month term\u201d yielding a return of \u201c15% annually on [the] Principal Deposit\u201d payable in six-monthly intervals. 62', 'It is therefore drafted as a debt instrument with the plaintiffs as the creditor. It also stipulates expressly that the plaintiffs\u2019 $1m investment is to be paid into an account in the third defendant\u2019s name. From that term, it could be inferred that the third defendant is to be the plaintiff\u2019s debtor. But the draft Note places no obligation on the third defendant to repay the $1m to the plaintiffs. Indeed, the draft Note leaves entirely unstated the name of the plaintiffs\u2019 debtor.', '37\\u2003The draft Note is drawn up on the letterhead of JE Capital Ltd. JE Capital Ltd is not the third defendant and is another one of the three instruments of fraud established by the first and second defendants (see [10] above). Further, the draft Note provides that the first and second defendants are to sign the note for \u201cJE Capital Ltd\u201d. But nowhere does the draft Note does it place any obligation on JE Capital Ltd to pay interest due to the plaintiffs, to repay the principal to the plaintiffs and to procure the banker\u2019s guarantee for the principal amount.', '38\\u2003I find, however, that the plaintiffs\u2019 debtor is and was the third defendant. First, it is the third defendant who received the plaintiffs\u2019 funds. Second, it is the third defendant who the plaintiffs were told that they were contracting with and with whom they believed that they were contracting. 63', '39\\u2003The second unusual feature of the draft Note is that it includes a number of provisions which are couched in what appears at first sight to be formal legal language but which is in fact utter gibberish barely carrying any syntactical sense, let alone commercial sense. Two examples suffice. 64', '40\\u2003First, the draft Note describes its purpose in the following introductory language:', 'There is no evidence that the Note which was eventually \u201cissued\u201d to the plaintiffs was a part of any legitimate series of notes.', '41\\u2003Second, the draft Note makes the following provision on interest:', 'Although there is a clear provision for 15% interest to be paid, the remainder of this provision makes no sense.', '42\\u2003The draft Agreement accompanying the draft Note describes itself as a \u201cFund Subscription Agreement\u201d and is drawn up on the letterhead of \u201cAutostyle Cars Company Limited\u201d. 65', 'It states that it is to be entered into between JE Capital Investments Limited and Autostyle Cars Company Limited on the one hand and a \u201csubscriber\u201d on the other. 66', 'The intent of the draft Agreement appears to be to set out the terms on which the \u201csubscriber\u201d is to invest money in a fund which is somehow connected to \u201cAutostyle Cars Company Limited\u201d and another company with a confusingly similar name: \u201cAutostyle Cars Limited\u201d (ie without \u201cCompany\u201d in the name).', '43\\u2003There is no evidence that either \u201cAutostyle Cars Limited\u201d or \u201cAutostyle Cars Company Limited\u201d ever actually had any actual business or ever actually solicited subscriptions for any actual fund to which either company had any actual connection. It is therefore unnecessary to distinguish between the two names. I shall therefore refer to both collectively as \u201cAutostyle\u201d.', '44\\u2003The draft Agreement too contains copious amounts of impressive-looking gibberish. Four examples suffice. First, it describes the parties as follows: 67', '45\\u2003Second, it recites the background to the Agreement as follows:', '46\\u2003Third, it sets out the key obligation as follows:', '47\\u2003Fourth, although it describes itself as a fund subscription agreement, ie an investment in equity, the Appendix refers to the indicia of a debt instrument.

This too contains a significant amount of gibberish: 70', '50\\u2003It is virtually impossible to ascertain from the draft Note and the draft Agreement the precise structure of the Autostyle investment which the first and second defendants were seeking to present to the plaintiffs. Presumably, the intention was to frame the Autostyle investment as a transaction in which the plaintiffs lent money to an (apparently unnamed) entity controlled by the first and second defendants which money that entity was then to use to subscribe for shares in Autostyle. The income from those shares would fund the interest payments due to the plaintiffs and the capital value of those shares would be realised in March 2015 to fund the repayment of principal.', '51\\u2003However, the initial draft of the remittance instructions pursuant to which the plaintiffs were to pay $1m to the third defendant\u2019s Standard Chartered Bank account gave the purpose of the payment as \u201cPurchase of Equity Stake of JE Capital Pte Ltd Holdings\u201d [sic]. 71', 'And those instructions were signed by the first defendant and the second defendant on behalf of JE Capital Ltd, ie not the third defendant. So perhaps any attempt to make sense of the Autostyle investment is doomed to fail, being no more than an attempt to make sense out of the nonsensical.', '52\\u2003Because of the size of the proposed Autostyle investment, the second plaintiff felt that she needed to have the first plaintiff\u2019s input before committing to it. She therefore suggested that both plaintiffs meet the fourth defendant to discuss the terms of the investment. 72', 'According to the first plaintiff, he was not keen on this investment because he was not familiar with the nature of the investment, because the capital sum was large and because the returns were not high enough to be attractive. 73', 'Nevertheless, he agreed to meet the fourth defendant and to hear him out, particularly because the investment was to be secured by a banker\u2019s guarantee. 74', '53\\u2003On 2 March 2014, both plaintiffs met the fourth defendant at a restaurant in Parkway Parade to discuss the investment. 75', 'The plaintiffs\u2019 case is that at this meeting, the fourth defendant went through the draft Note with them 76', 'and told them that:', '(a)\\u2003The investment would be secured by a banker\u2019s guarantee if the amount invested was $1m or more; 77', '(b)\\u2003He too had invested money with the third defendant, but that his investment was not secured by a banker\u2019s guarantee because it was less than $1m; 78', '(c)\\u2003The money which the plaintiffs invested would be paid into the third defendant\u2019s account with Credit Suisse; 79', '(d)\\u2003The fourth defendant was managing the third defendant\u2019s bank account(s) in Credit Suisse and would therefore have visibility of the third defendant\u2019s financial status; 80', '(e)\\u2003Autostyle\u2019s inventory of luxury cars would be pledged with Credit Suisse; 81', '(f)\\u2003The banker\u2019s guarantee to secure the plaintiffs\u2019 investment would be issued by Credit Suisse; 82', 'and', '(g)\\u2003A banker\u2019s guarantee was a guarantee by a bank (in this case Credit Suisse) to pay to the plaintiffs the sum of $1m if there was a default in the investment. 83', '54\\u2003Further, the plaintiffs say, they wanted to be able to withdraw from the Autostyle investment and retrieve their capital at any time before the one-year period expired. This was important to them because the plaintiffs, being in the construction industry, might have need for the capital before the one year expired. The first plaintiff asked the fourth defendant specifically about this at the meeting. According to them, the fourth defendant assured them that they would be able to withdraw 100% of the capital which they invested upon 30 days\u2019 notice. 84', '55\\u2003The first plaintiff\u2019s evidence is that he put great credence in what the fourth defendant told him because the fourth defendant was a banker with Credit Suisse and because of what the fourth defendant told him of Credit Suisse\u2019s connection to the investment: 85', '56\\u2003 Further, the first plaintiff says that, because he was not keen on the investment, he was particularly circumspect about the risks associated with it and was looking for assurances that would minimise those risks, such as the promised banker\u2019s guarantee: 86', '57\\u2003On 9 March 2014, the plaintiffs decided in principle to make the Autostyle investment. 87', 'On 10 March 2014, they asked the fourth defendant to put both their names into the final documentation. 88', 'But they wanted to check the terms of the banker\u2019s guarantee before giving their final agreement.

The plaintiffs believed what the fourth defendant told them because the fourth defendant was the banker in charge of the third defendant\u2019s account with Credit Suisse. 92', 'The plaintiffs asked to shorten the period for the third defendant to issue the banker\u2019s guarantee from 90 days to 60 days. They also asked for the third defendant to guarantee repayment of the $1m as security during the 60 days. 93', 'The fourth defendant said that he would try and get the third defendant to agree to shortening the period. 94', '59\\u2003At this meeting, the first plaintiff reminded the fourth defendant to forward a \u201cdraft\u201d 95', 'Credit Suisse banker\u2019s guarantee to the plaintiffs for their approval.

Sir Mekere was not keen to close the mine. 3', 'The State recognised that the mine had caused significant environmental damage and that it would cause even more damage as long as it was in operation. But it felt on balance that the mine should continue operating because of the significant economic benefits it brought to Papua New Guinea and to the people of the Western Province. 4', '11\\u2003 In late 2000, OTML appointed NM Rothschild & Sons Ltd (\u201cRothschild\u201d) to facilitate negotiations between all the relevant stakeholders on arrangements to allow BHP to exit from OTML while allowing the mine to continue operating. 5', 'In June 2001, BHP entered into a merger with Billiton plc. The merged company came to be known as BHP Billiton Ltd (\u201cBHPB\u201d). Nothing material to this dispute turns on the merger. For convenience and except where necessary, therefore, I shall not distinguish between BHP and BHPB in the remainder of this judgment.', '12\\u2003Negotiations proceeded apace for BHP\u2019s exit from OTML between BHP, the State, OTML\u2019s shareholders and OTML\u2019s stakeholders. By the middle of 2001, negotiations had advanced to the point where parties had reached a broad, tentative consensus on key issues. That consensus is recorded in a document dated 29 June 2001 and titled \u201cHeads of Agreement\u201d.', '13\\u2003The Heads of Agreement envisages: (a) BHP transferring 90% of its shareholding in OTML to a special purpose vehicle; and (b) the State releasing BHP from, and indemnifying BHP against, claims arising from all liability for the environmental damage caused by the mine. Because the parties had not yet arrived at a consensus on a number of other issues, the Heads of Agreement explicitly records that it is not legally binding. 6', '14\\u2003Negotiations continued. By October 2001, BHP\u2019s exit plan was sufficiently concrete for the parties to take steps which were legally binding. The thrust of the exit plan was for BHP to gift its entire shareholding in OTML to a special purpose vehicle in return for: (a) the State releasing and indemnifying BHP in relation to liability arising from its operation of the mine; (b) the State guaranteeing that it would not prosecute BHP in connection with its operation of the mine; and (c) the State enacting legislation giving statutory effect to these key points.', '15\\u2003PNGSDP was duly incorporated on 20 October 2001 in Singapore to be the special purpose vehicle to whom BHP would divest its OTML shares. Singapore was chosen for a number of reasons: (a) because of its robust corporate governance regime; (b) because of its relative tax advantages; and (c) because Singapore law allows a company\u2019s liability to be limited by guarantee. 7', '16\\u2003On 20 December 2001, the State duly passed the Ok Tedi Mine Continuation (Ninth Supplement) Agreement Act 2001 (PNG) (the \u201cNinth Supplement Act\u201d). The Ninth Supplement Act gave the force of law in Papua New Guinea to the key elements of BHP\u2019s exit plan. 8', '17\\u2003It is common ground that PNGSDP\u2019s corporate constitution is set out in three documents: (a) its Memorandum of Association (\u201cthe Memorandum\u201d); (b) its Articles of Association (\u201cthe Articles\u201d); and (c) a document called the \u201cProgram Rules\u201d which is annexed to and forms part of the Articles.', '18\\u2003PNGSDP\u2019s Memorandum is typical of the memorandum of association of a company limited by guarantee. It simply sets out in broad terms the objects and powers of PNGSDP.', '19\\u2003PNGSDP\u2019s Articles, too, are for the most part typical of the articles of association of a company limited by guarantee. The Articles set out in some detail the internal governance framework of PNGSDP. This includes, amongst other things, the procedures for: (a) appointing members; (b) appointing directors; and (c) holding and conducting meetings of both members and directors. In particular, Article 24 provides that BHP has the right to appoint three of PNGSDP\u2019s six directors (the \u201cA\u201d directors) and that three agencies of the State identified in Article 24 by name have the right to appoint one director each (the \u201cB\u201d directors). The provisions of the Articles, including Article 24, feature heavily in this dispute. I shall discuss them in greater detail as they become relevant.', '20\\u2003Unlike the Memorandum and the Articles, the Program Rules are a bespoke document, unique to PNGSDP. The purpose of the Program Rules is to govern how PNGSDP\u2019s income \u2013 primarily the dividends declared on its OTML shares, but also its investment income, is to be managed and applied. As a matter of form, the Program Rules are annexed to the Articles as a schedule. They therefore take effect as part of the statutory contract comprised in the Articles. But the Program Rules also have independent contractual effect. Thus, although both the State and BHP are not parties to the statutory contract embodied in the Articles and cannot therefore have any rights under the Articles which are directly enforceable against PNGSDP, it is common ground that both the State and BHP have a legal right: (a) to veto any amendment by PNGSDP to the Program Rules; and (b) to compel PNGSDP to comply with the Program Rules. The Program Rules also feature heavily in this dispute, and I shall discuss them in greater detail as they become relevant.', '21\\u2003The incorporation of PNGSDP on the terms set out in its constitutional documents was only the first of a series of steps which the parties implemented to carry out BHP\u2019s agreed exit plan. The State and BHP continued to enter into yet more written contracts after PNGSDP\u2019s incorporation. Now, however, PNGSDP was a party to these further contracts. The contracts which form part of this suite and which are relevant to this dispute are: 9', '(a)\\u2003a master agreement dated 11 December 2001 between the State, BHP, BHPB, PNGSDP and certain other entities (the \u201cMaster Agreement\u201d);', '(b)\\u2003a deed of indemnity dated 11 December 2001 between PNGSDP and BHP;', '(c)\\u2003a deed of indemnity dated 11 December 2001 between PNGSDP and the State;', '(d)\\u2003a security deed dated 7 February 2002 between PNGSDP, OTML and Insinger Trust (Singapore) Limited (\u201cInsinger\u201d) (\u201cthe Security Deed\u201d);', '(e)\\u2003a security trust deed dated 7 February 2002 between PNGSDP, OTML, BHP and Insinger (\u201cthe Security Trust Deed\u201d); and', '(f)\\u2003an equitable mortgage of shares dated 7 February 2002 between PNGSDP and Insinger.', '22\\u2003After the parties executed this suite of contracts, BHP transferred its entire 52% shareholding in OTML to PNGSDP. That transfer took place on 7 February 2002. 10', '23\\u2003As I have noted, PNGSDP\u2019s corporate governance was quite uneventful from the time of its incorporation until 2012. Its corporate constitution was amended during that period. These amendments included amendments to the Program Rules 11', 'and amendments to substitute one State agency for another State agency as being empowered to appoint a \u201cB\u201d director. 12', 'None of these changes attracted any controversy or engendered any litigation.', '24\\u2003The same cannot be said of the changes to PNGSDP\u2019s corporate governance which took place in 2012 and 2013. An external observer could well conclude that these changes to PNGSDP\u2019s corporate governance were not unconnected to changes to Papua New Guinea\u2019s national governance around that time. First, some background: Sir Mekere served as prime minister of Papua New Guinea from 1999 to 2002. During that time, as I have mentioned, BHP decided to and thereafter did divest its shareholding in OTML. In 2002, Sir Mekere was succeeded as Prime Minister by Sir Michael Somare, who held office until 2011. In 2011 and 2012, Papua New Guinea was engulfed by a constitutional crisis. That crisis saw both Sir Michael and Mr Peter O\u2019Neill claim simultaneously to be the legitimate Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea. A general election was held in July 2012 in an effort to resolve the constitutional crisis. Sir Mekere declined to seek re-election to his seat in that general election. Mr O\u2019Neill\u2019s party won the election. He was sworn in as Prime Minister in August 2012. Prime Minister O\u2019Neill has held office as the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea from August 2012 to the present day.', '25\\u2003Soon after the 2012 general election, at Prime Minister O\u2019Neill\u2019s direction, the State began to investigate the manner in which PNGSDP\u2019s assets were being used. The particular concern was to ascertain whether those assets were in fact being used to benefit the people of Papua New Guinea. The State took into account the prevailing sentiment of the people of Papua New Guinea that BHP, as a foreign entity, should no longer be involved in the governance of PNGSDP and that there were suitably qualified Papua New Guineans to assume all positions of authority within PNGSDP. 13', 'The State therefore decided to engage BHP in negotiations on the terms of BHP\u2019s exit from PNGSDP and a restructuring of PNGSDP. 14', '26\\u2003At about the same time, PNGSDP was also in the process of reviewing its corporate constitution. In October 2012, that review culminated in the directors of PNGSDP making the first set of changes to its corporate constitution. The changes weakened the links which PNGSDP had until then had with both BHP and the State. 15', '(a)\\u2003Article 24(A) of the Articles was amended to transfer the right to appoint \u201cA\u201d directors from BHP to the \u201cA\u201d directors themselves;', '(b)\\u2003Articles 37(A) and 38 of the Articles were amended to increase the requirements for a quorum and for a majority at directors\u2019 meetings to two \u201cA\u201d directors and one \u201cB\u201d director instead of one \u201cA\u201d director and one \u201cB\u201d director; and', '(c)\\u2003a new Clause 8A was added to the Memorandum to entrench the appointment process of the \u201cA\u201d directors and the requirements for quorum and majority at board meetings, such that those articles in the Articles could not be amended unless all members of PNGSDP agreed.', '27\\u2003The chairman of PNGSDP\u2019s board of directors in 2012, and indeed since PNGSDP\u2019s inception, was Prof Garnaut. Together with these changes in October 2012, Prof Garnaut stepped down as a director of PNGSDP and as the chairman of its board. Sir Mekere was appointed to PNGSDP\u2019s board and assumed chairmanship of the board that same month.', '28\\u2003With these changes in place, the negotiations then commenced between the State and BHP for BHP\u2019s exit from PNGSDP. In March 2013, Prime Minister O\u2019Neill wrote to Sir Mekere (in the latter\u2019s capacity as chairman of PNGSDP) informing him of the State\u2019s intention to commence negotiations to purchase PNGSDP\u2019s shares in OTML. 16', 'He asked Sir Mekere to put together a negotiating team for PNGSDP. The negotiations commenced. Eventually, the negotiations involved BHP as well. The negotiations failed to yield an agreement.', '29\\u2003When it became apparent that the negotiations had failed, the State and PNGSDP each took unilateral action to achieve their desired outcome in the negotiations.', '30\\u2003On 19 September 2013, the Papua New Guinea Parliament passed the Mining (Ok Tedi Tenth Supplemental Agreement) Bill 2013 and the Mining (Ok Tedi Mine Continuation) (Ninth Supplemental Agreement) (Amendment) Bill 2013. The effect of these two statutes was: (a) to cancel all of the ordinary shares in OTML which PNGSDP held; (b) to issue an identical number of new shares in OTML to the State; (c) to grant the Prime Minister the discretion to declare whether the State would pay compensation for these shares, and if so, to whom, in what sum and on what terms; and (d) to give the State \u201call necessary powers to restructure\u201d PNGSDP. 17', '31\\u2003PNGSDP, in response, effected two further rounds of changes to its corporate constitution. In October 2013, the directors of PNGSDP appointed Sir Mekere as a member of PNGSDP, a status he was to hold concurrently with his position as a director and as chairman of the board of directors. In the same month, the members of PNGSDP resolved to delete Article 24(B) of the Articles. This removed the right of the three State agencies named in that Article to appoint \u201cB\u201d directors, whether afresh or as replacements for existing \u201cB\u201d directors. The amendment also introduced a new \u201cfit and proper\u201d test to assess the suitability of the existing \u201cB\u201d directors to hold office as a director. In March 2014, Article 24(B) was further amended to give the members of PNGSDP the right to appoint, replace and remove \u201cB\u201d directors.', '32\\u2003In October 2013, the State attempted to appoint a transitional management team to take charge of PNGSDP. PNGSDP, being a company incorporated in Singapore, commenced proceedings in Singapore by way of Originating Summons 1036 of 2013 (\u201cOS 1036\u201d) to challenge the State\u2019s attempt. In July 2014, Prakash J, as she then was, converted OS 1036 into a writ action with the State as plaintiff. That writ action is Suit 795 which has now been tried before me.', '33\\u2003In April 2014, the State also sought an injunction against PNGSDP by filing Summons 1669 of 2014 (\u201cSummons 1669\u201d) to restrain PNGSDP from dealing with, disposing of, or otherwise diminishing the value of assets belonging to PNGSDP. Prakash J heard that application and ordered an interim injunction restraining PNGSDP from changing its Memorandum and the composition of its board of directors, and removing assets in what is called PNGSDP\u2019s \u201cLong Term Fund\u201d. Prakash J also heard the State\u2019s application for a wider injunction restraining PNGSDP from dealing with all of its assets, but dismissed that application. The interim injunction was left in place, however, until the disposal of this action. In light of my decision, that injunction must be and is now discharged. There is an open question as to whether there should be an inquiry on the State\u2019s undertaking as to damages. PNGSDP will have to make a separate application if it wishes such an inquiry to be conducted.', '34\\u2003In October 2014, the State filed an application in Summons No 5440 of 2014 (\u201cSummons 5440\u201d) seeking to compel PNGSDP to allow the State to inspect PNGSDP\u2019s accounts, books of account, and other records. Prakash J set aside Summons 5440 on the ground that the relief prayed for, being final relief, could not be sought by an interlocutory application but instead ought to have been sought by originating process. The State responded by filing Originating Summons 234 of 2015 (\u201cOS 234\u201d) in March 2015, seeking essentially the same relief as it had sought by Summons 5440.', '35\\u2003Prakash J gave her decision on the State\u2019s application in OS 234 in February 2016. Her decision is reported as Independent State of Papua New Guinea v PNG Sustainable Development Program Ltd [2016] 2 SLR 366 (\u201cPNGSDP (OS 234)\u201d). She held that the State had a right of inspection on the terms of Clause 9 and Article 52 of PNGSDP\u2019s Memorandum by virtue of a collateral contract, the ratification of which PNGSDP was estopped from denying. She further held that the State\u2019s right of inspection was limited only to the documents described in Clause 9 of the Memorandum.', '36\\u2003PNGSDP and the State both appealed against Prakash J\u2019s decision. The Court of Appeal allowed PNGSDP\u2019s appeal on the narrow ground that the question whether the State had a right of inspection, as well as the extent of that right, on the basis of a collateral contract, was not one which could be decided summarily on an application by way of originating summons, but should be determined with oral evidence and cross-examination. 18', 'The Court of Appeal therefore set aside the judgment in PNGSDP (OS 234) and directed that the State pursue the relief sought in OS 234 in consolidation with the trial of Suit 795. OS 234 \u2013 and the question whether the State has a right of inspection in respect of PNGSDP\u2019s books and records and if so the extent of that right \u2013 is therefore also before me now.'"}
{"casename":"2019_SGHC_69","fact":"'2\\u2003In January 2011, in response to spiralling food prices and growing concerns about scarcity, the South Korean government embarked on a project (the \u201cProject\u201d) to secure long-term stable lines of food supply from international sources and supplement the domestic food supply. The defendant, BVX (\u201cthe Purchaser\u201d), a state-owned company, was appointed to spearhead the Project.', '3\\u2003The Purchaser was put in touch with the plaintiff, BVU (\u201cthe Supplier\u201d), which recommended that the Purchaser procure food (\u201cthe Products\u201d) from South America. The Supplier and the Purchaser began negotiations in mid-2011. On 14 June 2012, after governmental approval was obtained, the Purchaser and the Supplier formally entered into an agreement (\u201cthe Agreement\u201d).', '4\\u2003The material terms of the Agreement are as follows:', '(a)\\u2003The Supplier shall be the Purchaser\u2019s \u201cmost preferred Supplier\u201d (Clause 4.1 and Schedule 1).', '(b)\\u2003The Agreement will commence on 1 October 2012 (\u201cthe Commencement Date\u201d) and shall continue for 20 years (\u201cthe Contract Period\u201d) and any renewal thereof unless and until terminated in accordance with the termination clause (Clause 4.3).', '(c)\\u2003The Supplier shall use its \u201cbest commercially reasonable efforts in performing its supplying obligations\u201d and that it will source for the Products mainly from Latin America (Clause 5.1).', '(d)\\u2003The Purchaser too shall use its \u201cbest commercially reasonable effort to order and purchase\u201d the Products over the duration of the agreement, in accordance with the Forecast Range, which is defined to be \u201c[m]inimum of 1,000,000 tons in total per annum\u201d (Clause 6.1 and Schedule 2). The Purchaser is to provide \u201ca rolling twelve months forecast of purchase orders\u201d (Clause 6.5). Clause 6.1 was the critical clause in dispute in the arbitration, as I will explain later.', '(e)\\u2003The Agreement is to be governed by the \u201crules of the Vienna Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (\u201cthe CISG\u201d)\u201d (Clause 10.1). Disputes arising out of or in connection with the Agreement will be finally settled by way of Singapore-seated arbitration in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (\u201cICC\u201d) (Clause 10.2).', '5\\u2003Following the execution of the Agreement, the Purchaser did not submit a rolling forecast. In a letter to the Supplier on 26 December 2012, the Purchaser confirmed a rumour that it had entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (\u201cMOU\u201d) with one of the Supplier\u2019s competitors, [Y Co]. Subsequently, a series of meetings between the parties took place.', '6\\u2003On 19 April 2013, the Purchaser forecasted a purchase of 170,000 tons of the Products. This was considerably less than what was stated in the Forecast Range. The Purchaser, however, refused to place any orders under the Agreement. Instead, it began a public tender process. On 25 April 2013, it sent a letter inviting the Supplier to take part in the public tender for the amount of the Products earlier forecasted. Up to the time of the arbitration hearing, the Purchaser had not placed any orders with the Supplier.', '7\\u2003On 25 July 2013, the Supplier commenced ICC Arbitration No 19630\/CYK (\u201cthe arbitration\u201d) against the Purchaser claiming US$2.25m in damages plus interest for breach of the Agreement, among other requests for relief. According to the Supplier, this figure represented its loss of approximately 3 months of profit from October to December 2012.', '8\\u2003The Supplier alleged that the Purchaser had breached the Agreement by:', '(a)\\u2003failing to place purchase orders for the Products either in accordance with the Forecast Range or at all;', '(b)\\u2003failing to treat the Supplier as the \u201cmost preferred Supplier\u201d by its actions in holding a public tender; and', '(c)\\u2003failing to submit an adequate rolling forecast in accordance with Clause 6.5 of the Agreement.', '9\\u2003The Purchaser\u2019s position was that its obligations under the Agreement were not absolute or binding, but was to instead use its \u201cbest commercially reasonable effort\u201d to order and purchase the Products as per the Forecast Range. According to the Purchaser, this was supported by the plain words used in the Agreement. Recourse to extrinsic evidence to interpret the Agreement was therefore unnecessary. It was pointed out that an earlier draft of Clause 6.1 originally provided in mandatory terms that the Purchaser \u201cshall order and purchase the Products as per the Forecast Range\u201d [emphasis added]. So, the fact that this was watered down in the finalised version of the Agreement to become an obligation to use \u201cbest commercially reasonable effort\u201d was significant.', '10\\u2003The Purchaser argued that the Agreement was \u201ca type of framework agreement\u201d. This was supported by the fact that the Agreement left out key commercial terms such as quantity, quality, supply method, supply date and, in particular, price. The parties had therefore contemplated that separate sale and purchase agreements would have to be concluded between the parties subsequently. Further, there could not have been a binding obligation to order a million tons of the Products annually over a 20-year period given that there was no guarantee that food production, distribution or price would remain stable over the entire period.', '11\\u2003The Purchaser added that it was subject to certain laws and regulations in Korea that required it to call for a public tender as it was a state-owned enterprise. This should have been known to the Supplier given that it had knowledge of the Project, and should have aware that the Purchaser, as a state-owned corporation, would be under a statutory obligation to supply goods through a public or competitive tendering process. The standard of \u201cbest commercially reasonable effort\u201d did not require the Purchaser to flout Korean public procurement laws by entering into a specially negotiated contract with the Supplier.', '12\\u2003On Korean procurement law, the Purchaser took the position that Article 6.1 of the Contractual Affairs Regulations of Public Corporations and Quasi-government Entities (\u201cthe Contract Regulations\u201d) required it to conclude contracts by way of a competitive bidding process, which meant, in short, that it had to call a public tender. The Contract Regulations are enacted under the State Act on Contracts to which the State is a Party (\u201cthe State Contracts Act\u201d). In addition, the Purchaser contended that none of the exceptions, which would permit a specially negotiated contract (without the need for a public tender) under Article 8 of the Contract Regulations or Article 26 of the Enforcement Decree of the State Contracts Act applied to the situation at hand. The Purchaser disagreed with the Supplier\u2019s reading of Article 4 of the Contract Regulations (see [15] below) as it contended that \u201cinternational tendering procedures\u201d were different from \u201cpublic competitive tendering\u201d. As a general rule, even if the Purchaser was exempt from international tendering procedures, it would still have to comply with Article 6 of the Contract Regulations and conduct a public tender.', '13\\u2003The Supplier disagreed with the Purchaser\u2019s interpretation of the phrase \u201cbest commercially reasonable effort\u201d. The Supplier also argued that the invitation to hold a public tender and the entering of the MOU with [Y Co] were breaches of the Purchaser\u2019s obligation to treat the Supplier as the \u201cmost preferred Supplier\u201d.', '14\\u2003On Korean procurement law, the Supplier relied on Article 7.1 of the State Contracts Act read with Article 26(1)(1)(a) of the Enforcement Decree of the State Contracts Act. The Supplier submitted that the effect of both of these provisions is that specially negotiated contracts would be permitted instead of public bidding exercises if deemed necessary, such as in cases of \u201cnatural disasters, movement of military forces for military operations \u2026 urgent events \u2026 sharp rises in raw material prices, or others similar thereto\u201d.', '15\\u2003In addition, and alternatively, the Supplier relied on a Note to Annex 3 of the World Trade Organisation Agreement on Government Procurement, as well as Article 4(1)(1) of the Contract Regulations, to argue that the Agreement was exempt from \u201cinternational tendering procedures\u201d because the goods procured thereunder were intended for resale. Article 4(1) of the Contract Regulations provides as such:', 'The Supplier\u2019s position in the arbitration was that, if Article 4(1)(1) of the Contract Regulations was engaged, the exception under Article 4(1)(5) would not apply, and correspondingly, Article 8 of the Contract Regulations and Article 26 of the Enforcement Decree of the State Contracts Act would not apply as well.', '16\\u2003The Supplier also asserted that the Purchaser had regularly resorted to direct purchases instead of public tenders.', '17\\u2003Before the oral hearings for the arbitration took place, the Purchaser indicated that it would only call one factual witness, [B], and that it would not call [C] (president of the Purchaser), [D] (executive director of one of the Purchaser\u2019s departments) and [E] (director-general of a separate department of the Purchaser) as witnesses. [E] was the most junior of the three and the former two were the Purchaser\u2019s officers who signed the Agreement. These three individuals had been referred to by the Supplier in its Statement of Claim as being involved in the negotiations for the Agreement. The Supplier applied to the arbitral tribunal (\u201cthe Tribunal\u201d) for an order that the Purchaser procure the attendance of these three employees as witnesses in the arbitration, but this application was unsuccessful. I elaborate on the Supplier\u2019s application below at [62].', '18\\u2003The hearing therefore proceeded with the Purchaser calling [B] as its sole factual witness. [B] was a deputy director of the Purchaser. He was not involved in the negotiations leading to the Agreement but, at the time of the arbitration, he was responsible for the purchase and sale of the Products and for monitoring the performance of the Agreement with the Supplier. The Purchaser also called on two other experts to give their opinions on comparative and Korean law: Professor Young-Joon Kwon (\u201cProf Kwon\u201d) and Professor Won-Woo Lee (\u201cProf Lee\u201d). Prof Kwon provided evidence on, inter alia, comparative and Korean law interpretations of the meaning of \u201cbest endeavours\u201d, \u201ccommercially reasonable efforts\u201d and other similarly worded clauses. Prof Lee gave evidence on the requirement of public tenders under Korean law.', '19\\u2003The Supplier called three factual witnesses: [F] (managing director of one of the Supplier\u2019s shareholders), [G] (co-founder of the Supplier) and [H] (a member of the board of directors of a corporate board member of the Supplier, and also one of the lawyers who represented the Supplier in the arbitration). They gave evidence primarily on the background to the Agreement as well as the events occurring after the signing of the Agreement. The Supplier\u2019s main witness who dealt with negotiations for the Agreement was [H]. He had represented the Supplier in these negotiations.', '20\\u2003The final award (\u201cthe Award\u201d) was issued on 10 December 2015, and one of the three arbitrators comprising the tribunal issued a dissenting opinion.', '21\\u2003The majority considered that there were two fundamental issues. The first involved the nature and scope of the Purchaser\u2019s obligations under Clause 6.1 of the Agreement to use its \u201cbest commercially reasonable effort\u201d to buy the Products from the Supplier, the standard that the obligation entailed and, of course, whether the Purchaser had failed to discharge that contractual obligation on the facts of the case. The second issue was whether the Purchaser was indeed prohibited from making direct purchase orders of the Products from the Supplier under the Agreement as per the laws and regulations of Korea. The majority took the view that the second question was a \u201cthreshold issue\u201d:', '22\\u2003On this threshold issue, the majority concluded that the Purchaser was obliged under Article 6 of the Contract Regulations to call a public tender if it wished to purchase the Products in the circumstances covered by the Agreement. In reaching this conclusion, the majority stressed that the Supplier had not called any expert evidence to support its arguments to the contrary. On the other hand, on behalf of the Purchaser, Prof Lee was able to draw a difference between \u201cinternational tendering procedures\u201d and the \u201cpublic tendering\u201d requirement under Articles 4 and 6 of the Contract Regulations, respectively, on the basis of his familiarity with, and expertise in, Korean law. The majority also accepted that serious consequences (disciplinary actions or even criminal sanctions) could follow if the Purchaser entered into negotiated contracts without calling for a public tender. In short, the majority of the tribunal accepted the Purchaser\u2019s contention that it was not exempt under the laws of Korea from having to carry out a public tender if it wanted to buy the Products from the Supplier.', '23\\u2003The majority then turned to examine the scope of the Purchaser\u2019s obligations under Clause 6.1 of the Agreement. The Agreement provided that the applicable substantive law of the contract was the CISG. Accordingly, it was Article 8 of the CISG that governed the interpretation of the Agreement.', '24\\u2003The majority proceeded to note that the parties were \u201clargely in agreement that the starting point for determining the intention of the parties is the words used in the Agreement itself\u201d [emphasis added]. However, in determining intent, Article 8(3) of the CISG requires that all relevant circumstances be given due consideration \u2013 and all such relevant circumstances include, without limitation, the pre-contractual negotiations, usages and subsequent conduct of the parties.', '25\\u2003The majority regarded Korean public procurement law as one such relevant circumstance. Put another way, the Tribunal took into account Korean public procurement law as part of the legal and regulatory background which has to be considered when it interpreted Clause 6.1 of the Agreement. To the majority, the key issue was therefore whether \u201cbest commercially reasonable effort\u201d to place orders required the Purchaser to purchase the Products in a manner that required it to \u201cbypass or run afoul of the law by placing orders without first calling a public tender\u201d.', '26\\u2003On the face of Clause 6.1 of the Agreement, the majority found that it was clear that the plain words created no absolute obligations on the parties. They then looked at the pre-Agreement statements and conduct of the parties. [H]\u2019s evidence in his witness statement was that there had not been \u201cany mention of [the Purchaser] having to go through a public tender process in order to perform under the contract\u201d. The parties were in agreement that there were no discussions whatsoever on the public tender requirement during the pre-contract phase.', '27\\u2003The majority considered that, on the balance of the parties\u2019 arguments, the Purchaser\u2019s position was to be preferred for the following reasons:', '(a)\\u2003First, the Agreement was a fairly loose agreement that provided for a long contract duration, but left many matters open.', '(b)\\u2003Secondly, the clear intention of the parties was not to place an absolute obligation on the Purchaser to a minimum quantity of the Products per year. This is made clear from the fact that the original mandatory wording used in a draft of clause 6.1 (\u201cThe Purchaser shall order and purchase the Products\u201d) was subsequently amended, during the course of negotiations, such that the Purchaser need only use its \u201cits best commercially reasonable effort\u201d to order and purchase the Products.', '(c)\\u2003Thirdly, absent any discussion on the requirement of a public tender during the parties\u2019 negotiations, the Purchaser could not have been aware of the Supplier\u2019s mistaken assumption that the Purchaser was exempt from the requirements of Korean procurement law that it must carry out a public tender before buying the Products from the Supplier. There was thus no common understanding that the potential impact of the public tender requirements under Korean procurement law would be excluded from consideration such that the Purchaser would be under an absolute obligation to purchase the Products from the Supplier.', '(d)\\u2003Fourthly, the Supplier could not have been unaware that certain countries would require public tenders especially in the case of purchases by state-owned entities. The Supplier was advised by experienced lawyers and they should have sought Korean legal advice on this point. The law was a matter of public knowledge and the need for a public tender would not have been a fact known only to the Purchaser. Moreover, international traders would not disregard relevant regulatory requirements in the country in which they intend to supply goods.', '(e)\\u2003Fifthly the Purchaser\u2019s failure to call its employees involved in the pre-contract negotiations did not change the majority\u2019s view of the interpretation of the clause.', '(f)\\u2003Given the above, at the time when the Agreement was concluded, a reasonable person in the same circumstances as the parties would not expect that the Purchaser\u2019s obligation to use \u201cbest commercially reasonable effort\u201d to purchase the Products under the Agreement would require the Purchaser to act in contravention of Korean public procurement law.', '(g)\\u2003In the circumstances, the Purchaser had satisfactorily discharged its obligations under Clause 6.1 of the Agreement by calling a public tender and inviting the Supplier to participate.', '28\\u2003Alternatively, the majority found that the requirement for a public procurement contract to be concluded by means of a public tender was a usage which \u201cin international trade is widely known to, and regularly observed by, parties to contracts of the type involved in the particular trade concerned\u201d. This thus fell under Article 9(2) of the CISG. Thus, this usage was impliedly made applicable to the Agreement since parties had not agreed otherwise. Hence, the Tribunal\u2019s majority found that the Purchaser had not breached any obligation by not placing a purchase order given that any public procurement contract would have to be concluded by means of a public tender.', '29\\u2003The majority also found that the Purchaser\u2019s dealings with [Y Co] were not in breach of the terms of the Agreement. This was because the Agreement did not confer on the Supplier any exclusive rights. In any event, there had been no binding agreement entered into between the Purchaser and [Y Co].', '30\\u2003As for the minority opinion, the dissenting arbitrator held that adverse inferences ought to be drawn in respect of the Purchaser\u2019s decision not to produce its employees that were involved in the contractual negotiations as witnesses.', '31\\u2003The dissenting arbitrator was prepared to assume that the Purchaser was under a statutory obligation to make purchases by way of public procurement procedures. However, he was of the view that the parties had contemplated entering into the Agreement \u201con commercial terms\u201d, in that the parties had not anticipated purchases only by way of conducting public tenders. Accordingly, he found that the Purchaser was in breach of the Agreement.'"}
{"casename":"2019_SGHC_7","fact":"the facts  of Chiah Huat whether the supply agreement \nwas governed by an overarching  contract or was on an order and invoice basis, \nwhat is clear  is that the plaintiffs  in that case understood that it was dealing  with \nTjun Fong  Enterprise and continued  to supply ginseng tea leaf to Tjun Fong \nEnterprise despite the  change in the sole proprietors  of Tjun Fong Enterprise.\n39 Likewise, in this case,  the respondent contracted  with Afone \nInternational to carry out the works stipulated under the Contract. Afone \nInternational, indeed, honoured  its part of the Contract by providing  the \nnecessary contractual services to the respondent who failed to make  the \nnecessary payment for the services rendered.  Notwithstanding the change of \nownership in Afone International in the early part of the Contract, the parties \nhad held themselves to be bound by the Contract. When Mr Loke  sold Afone \nInternational to Sito Construction Pte Ltd one month  after the Contract  was \nsigned, the consideration must also have  included the performance  of the \nContract with the respondent. The sale of Afone International was an internal  \nmatter of Afone International which  had nothing to do with the respondent. \nGiven what transpired in this case leading up to the issuance of the Payment  \nClaim, it could hardly be said that the respondent was concerned  about the sale \nof Afone International between different  sole proprietors provided  that Afone \nInternational as a business  remained  in operation and fulfilled  the Contract. \n40 Furthermore,  the fact that the respondent  so readily  admitted in its \nadjudication response that the Contract was binding between the applicant  and \nthe respondent reinforced my findings. I note that although the applicant  only \nlodged a change in ownership of Afone International with ACRA on 16 July \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nSito Construction  Pte Ltd v PBT Engineering Pte Ltd [2019]  SGHC  07\n162018, the respondent did an ACRA search  on 19 July 2018 and learnt  of the \nidentity of the new sole proprietor of Afone International.25 Despite this \nknowledge, it nonetheless filed its adjudication response on 26 July 2018 and \nadmitted that the \u201c[applicant] is the sub-sub-contractor engaged by the \n[respondent] who is the sub-contractor of the Project, pursuant to a written \nagreement dated 1 April 2016 [ie., the Contract]\u201d.26 It is also important to note \nthat the arguments advanced by the respondent during  the adjudication process \nwere premised on the existence  of a contractual  relationship between the \nparties.27\n41 Finally, I would like to mention that cll 6.1 and 6.2 of the Contract  state \nthat there shall be no novation or assignment of the Contract without prior \nwritten consent  of the respondent. These  simply mean that for any novation or \nassignment of the Contract by Afone International  to a different party other than \nAfone International, written consent  by the respondent  is required. These \nprovisions do not deal with the change of ownership  of Afone International. \nThese clauses were not relevant to this case. Therefore, I did not agree with the \nrespondent\u2019s argument that the change of ownership of Afone International  \nwithout prior written  consent from  the respondent was in breach  of cll 6.1 and \n6.2.28 At the hearing,  the respondent did not pursue this line of argument \nalthough novation and assignment were mentioned in passing in its \nsubmissions.  \n25 Phua\u2019s 1st Affidavit at para 20 and Exhibit PBK-1 at pp 17 and 732.\n26 Phua\u2019s 1st Affidavit at p 445 para 4.\n27 Phua\u2019s 1st Affidavit at pp 443 \u2013 615 and 638 \u2013 727.\n28 Respondent\u2019s Written Submissions at  paras 5, 31 and  32. \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nSito Construction  Pte Ltd v PBT Engineering Pte Ltd [2019]  SGHC  07\n1742 For the reasons above, I found that the Contract continued  to bind the \napplicant and the respondent despite  the change of ownership of Afone \nInternational. Hence,  the AD and subsequent  Court Order were valid. \n43 Before  I deal with the next substantive issue, I would like to address  the \nrespondent\u2019s submissions that all the monies paid to the applicant in the sum of \n$4,811,246.13 should be refunded because  they were made under the mistaken \nbelief that the Contract was binding between the parties.29 First, I did not place \nany weight to this argument because this was outside the scope of the setting \naside application. Second, having already  found that the Contract  bound the \nparties, this argument  is moot. Finally, the respondent\u2019s argument on this point \nwas unsustainable. Having already accepted the applicant\u2019s works hitherto, \nwithout complaint  and paid for most of it, it was no longer  opened  to the \nrespondent to argue that the applicant had been unjustly enriched at the \nrespondent\u2019s expense. It was the respondent  that had enjoyed the applicant\u2019s \nservices and now used legal technicality  to unjustly deprive the applicant from \nbeing paid. The law cannot be allowed to be unfairly manipulated by the \nrespondent on technical grounds.\nWhether the respondent  had waived  its rights to raise a jurisdictional  \nobjection against the  AD at  the setting  aside application\n44 Having  found  that the Contract  bound the parties, I shall now consider  \nwhether the respondent had, nonetheless,  waived its rights  to raise a \njurisdictional objection against the AD at this setting  aside  application.

At the material time, \nhe was a driver of an unladen trailer bearing registration number JLR 5059 (the \n\u201cTrailer\u201d), and his job at Yinson Transport Shd Bhn (\u201cYinson  Transport\u201d) was \nto transport goods, such as cement  and steel pipes, from Malaysia  to Singapore.1 \n6 On 25 March 2016, the accused drove the Trailer from Malaysia to \nSingapore via the Woodlands Checkpoint. At about 4.35pm, Checkpoint \nInspector Leong Mun Wai (\u201cCI Leong\u201d)  and Sergeant  Noor Helmi  Bin Ali (\u201cSgt \nHelmi\u201d) directed the Trailer to a Cargo Clearance Centre checking bay for a \nroutine check.

Thereafter, arrangements \nwould be made for the accused to collect a bundle of marunthu from the Chinese \nman. The accused would bring the bundle of marunthu into Singapore \nconcealed inside the dashboard  compartment on the advice  of Mogan. On top \nof his legitimate job, the accused would deliver  the bundle of marunthu to one \n\u201cAbang\u201d, a Malay man in Singapore,  and in turn collect  a fee of $3,400 from  \nAbang. Thereafter,  the accused would return  to Malaysia and pass the money \ncollected from Abang to the Chinese man,  who would  give him RM500 as \nremuneration for the delivery.10 \n16 This was the modus  operandi for the deliveries, including three \noccasions where the accused delivered marunthu into Singapore prior to 25 \nMarch 2016.11 \nThe events  on 25 March 2016\n17 On 25 March 2016, the accused had a job to collect items from a \ncompany in Tuas.

After this, the accused  used the screwdriver to remove the \ndashboard panel. He placed the red plastic bag, containing the bundle of drugs, \nand the potato  chip container, containing  his drug paraphernalia and his \nmethamphetamine, into the dashboard compartment to conceal them.  He then \ndrove into Singapore both to perform  his company-assigned  job of collecting \n10 ASOF at  para 20. \n11 ASOF at  para 20. \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Sinniah a\/l Sundram Pillai [2019]  SGHC  79\n6items from Tuas and to deliver  the packet of marunthu  to Abang in Singapore. \nAs per the previous deliveries, the accused was to collect a sum of $3,400 from \nAbang and thereafter  pass the sum to the Chinese man,  after which the accused \nwould receive  his remuneration of RM500.12 \n18 After entering the Causeway at about  4.00pm, the accused gave a call to \nAbang and arranged to meet  him at 30 Tuas Avenue  South 8 at about 5.00pm \nto pass him the bundle of marunthu.  The accused  then proceeded to enter  \nWoodlands Checkpoint at about  4.35pm, where he was stopped,  searched  and \narrested.13 \n19 The accused was not authorised  under the MDA  or the Regulations made \nthereunder to import diamorphine and methamphetamine  into Singapore.14 \nThe accused\u2019s statements\n20 The Prosecution  relied on nine statements  provided by the accused,  \nwhich were admitted without objection from the accused. I now summarise the \npertinent points.  \n21 The agreement with Mogan was described  in further  detail in the \naccused\u2019s statements: \n(a) The accused knew Mogan as he was the accused\u2019s ex-colleague \nfrom Yinson Transport. The accused  did not know Mogan\u2019s full name, \nor if his real name was Mogan. During  the time Mogan was employed \nat Yinson  Transport, he and the accused  did not have  any interaction.15 \n12 ASOF at  para 21. \n13 ASOF at  para 22. \n14 ASOF at  para 23. \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Sinniah a\/l Sundram Pillai [2019]  SGHC  79\n7(b) Sometime in January 2016, Mogan approached the accused to \nask him to bring marunthu into Singapore  in exchange for RM500  per \nbundle of marunthu transported.  The accused  told Mogan that he was \nscared that he would get in trouble  with the Singapore police should he \nbe caught. Mogan  replied  that there  was nothing to worry about, unless \nthe accused  brought in large amounts of marunthu into Singapore. The \naccused told Mogan  that he would \u201cconsider  his offer\u201d,  and asked for \nMogan\u2019s phone number. Mogan refused to give the accused his number \nand asked  for the accused\u2019s  number  instead, which  the accused gave.16\n(c) When the accused returned home that day, he thought about \nMogan\u2019s offer.  The accused was in \u201cdeep financial troubles\u201d then, and \nneeded the money for a variety  of purposes including the funding of his \nown consumption of \u2018ice\u2019 and marunthu which cost him RM500 per \nmonth. The accused  \u201cfelt that getting the RM500 for [Mogan\u2019s job] \nwould ease  [his] financial problems\u201d.17 \n(d) The next day, Mogan called  the accused  and asked about the \noffer. The accused agreed to Mogan\u2019s  offer. At the same time, Mogan \ninformed him that there was a job to deliver marunthu into Singapore \nthe following  day.18 \n22 For the three  previous occasions  between  January to March 2016 when \nthe accused brought  marunthu into Singapore  for Mogan,  the accused  confirmed \nthat each time, he collected one bundle of marunthu  from  the Chinese man, \n15 AB at  p 145. \n16 AB at  p 145\u2013146. \n17 AB at  p 147. \n18 AB at  p 147. \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Sinniah a\/l Sundram Pillai [2019]  SGHC  79\n8delivered the bundle  to Abang, collected  $3,400 from Abang  and was paid \nRM500 by the Chinese man.19 On the first occasion, the marunthu  which  the \naccused received  was in a transparent packet. On the second and third occasions,  \nthe marunthu which the accused received was wrapped in black tape,  much  like \nthe bundle of drugs the accused was found  with on 25 March 2016.20\n23 As for the events on 25 March  2016, after the accused received the red \nplastic bag that contained  the bundle of drugs from the Chinese man, he brought  \nit back to the Trailer with him. There, he opened the red plastic bag, and \nremoved the bundle of drugs as he wanted to check it. The accused saw that it \nwas wrapped in black tape. He then placed  the bundle of drugs back into the red \nplastic bag, before  later concealing the red plastic bag containing the bundle of \ndrugs inside the dashboard compartment.  The accused drove  across Woodlands \nCheckpoint and was  arrested  shortly after.21 \n24 Lastly, while  the accused  was a marunthu consumer himself, he stated \nthat he never bought marunthu for his own consumption from the Chinese man. \nThe accused consumed marunthu  by the straw, but the Chinese man \u201conly [sold \nmarunthu]  in large amounts and not in straws\u201d.22 \nClose of the Prosecution\u2019s case\n25 At the close of the Prosecution\u2019s case, I found  that a prima  facie  case \nhad been made out against the accused and called  upon him to give his \ndefence.\n19 AB at  p 151. \n20 AB at  p 149, 151. \n21 AB at  p 153.\n22 AB at  p 158\u2013159. \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Sinniah a\/l Sundram Pillai [2019]  SGHC  79\n9The defence\n26 The accused  was the only witness for the Defence. At the trial, the \naccused did not deny  importing  a bundle  of drugs into Singapore, having \nphysical possession of the bundle  or knowing the nature of the drugs. His \ndefence, raised for the first time at trial, was that he thought the bundle he was \nbringing into Singapore was only \u201chalf a stone\u201d of diamorphine,23 which  was an \namount which would not trigger the death  penalty if imported (a \u201cnon-capital  \namount\u201d, contrasted with a \u201ccapital  amount\u201d which triggers the death penalty  if \nimported). \n27 The accused\u2019s evidence  at trial was largely consistent with his \nstatements, save for the assertion that an additional element of the agreement \nwas that the deliveries  were always to be for \u201chalf a stone\u201d of marunthu.  It is \nnecessary to set out in some detail  the accused\u2019s oral evidence outlining his \ndefence:\n(a) The accused testified that Mogan had in fact made the job offer \nto the accused twice. The first occasion was when both the accused and \nMogan were still co-workers  in Yinson Transport. Then,  Mogan \nreassured the accused by saying \u201cOnly  if you bring  a large amount, \nyou\u2019ll get into trouble. If you bring half a stone, you will get less than \n10 years\u201d.24 On the second occasion, Mogan  again  reassured the accused \nby saying,  \u201cYou don\u2019t have to bring a lot. You can just bring one bundle \nand it will be half a stone and I will give you [RM]500\u201d.25 On both \n23 Defence\u2019s Closing  Submissions at para 11. \n24 NEs (29 August 2018) p 4, ln 29\u201330. \n25 NEs (29 August 2018) p 5, ln 1\u20139.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Sinniah a\/l Sundram Pillai [2019]  SGHC  79\n10occasions, the accused  did not agree  immediately as he wanted to \nconsider the offer first.26\n(b) The accused eventually agreed to Mogan\u2019s proposal because, in \naddition to the money  he would get, it involved \u201chalf a bundle\u201d27 or \u201chalf \na stone\u201d,  which would result in \u201conly ... less than 10 years\u2019 \nimprisonment\u201d.28 The accused clarified  that by \u201chalf a bundle\u201d,  he meant \n\u201chalf a stone\u201d.29 \n(c) The accused  said that he was told that one bundle of drugs  was \n\u201chalf a stone\u201d.30 According to the accused\u2019s  understanding, a \u201cfull stone\u201d  \nof drugs  would have come in two bundles.31 \n(d) On the first occasion  that the accused  delivered marunthu  for \nMogan, he had simply  looked at the packet  of marunthu  packed in a \ntransparent packet, and knew  it was \u201chalf a stone\u201d.32 On the second  and \nthird occasions, though the bundles were  covered  in black  tape, the \naccused\u2019s impression was that they were  \u201chalf  a stone\u201d each.33 If the \nChinese man had handed over more  than half a stone of marunthu , the \naccused alleged that  he \u201cwould not have  brought  it into Singapore\u201d.34 \n26 NEs (29 August 2018) p 5, ln 4\u20135 and ln 13\u201317.\n27 NEs ( 29 August 2018) p 5, ln 31 and p 6, ln 6.\n28 NEs (29 August 2018) p 5, ln 29\u201332. \n29 NEs (29 August 2018) p 6 ln 17\u201320.\n30 NEs (29 August 2018) p 6, ln 20. \n31 NEs (29 August 2018) p 8, ln 18. \n32 NEs (29 August 2018) p 9, ln 9. \n33 NEs (29 August 2018) p 9, ln 16. \n34 NEs (29 August 2018) p 9, ln 19\u201320. \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Sinniah a\/l Sundram Pillai [2019]  SGHC  79\n11(e) When referred to a photograph  of the bundle of drugs  (P25), the \naccused stated that this was \u201cone bundle[,] and one bundle refers to half \na stone\u201d.35 The accused only found out that the bundle of drugs instead \ncontained \u201ca full stone\u201d  when he came to prison and the drugs  were \nweighed by the officers of the Central  Narcotics Bureau (the \u201cCNB\u201d) .36 \nWhen he found this out,  he realised he had been  \u201ccheated\u201d by Mogan.37\n28 Under cross-examination, the accused  made the following admissions: \n(a) The accused hesitated  before accepting  Mogan\u2019s offer because \nhe was worried about facing the death  penalty.38 The accused\u2019s \nunderstanding was that if he imported  \u201cone stone\u201d of marunthu, the \npenalty was death, but if he imported \u201chalf a stone\u201d  of marunthu , the \npenalty would be  10 years\u2019 imprisonment.39 \n(b) The accused  did not know the weight of \u201cone stone\u201d or \u201chalf a \nstone\u201d.40 The accused  agreed that he did not bother  to find out what the \nweight of \u201cone stone\u201d or \u201chalf a stone\u201d  was.41 \n(c) Even though the accused knew that there would be a death  \npenalty for the importation of 15g of marunthu  in Malaysia, he did not \nknow nor bother to find out if the bundle of drugs  weighed more than \n15g,42 even in terms of the gross weight of the bundle of drugs.43 The \n35 NEs (29 August 2018) p 8, ln 11.\n36 NEs (29 August 2018) p 9, ln 28\u201329.\n37 NEs (29 August 2018) p 10, ln 1\u20133. \n38 NEs (29 August 2018) p 14 ln 32 to p 15, ln 3. \n39 NEs (29 August 2018) p 14, ln 7 and 10. \n40 NEs (29 August 2018) p 13, ln 26 and 30\u201331. \n41 NEs (29 August 2018) p 14, ln 3;

{"casename":"2019_SGHC_8","fact":"facts  concerning \nhim were that he drove Roszaidi to Bulim Avenue and was told to look out for \na lorry. They spotted the lorry  at Bulim  Avenue, and Azli saw Roszaidi \ncollecting a plastic bag from the men in the lorry. He then drove Roszaidi to \nmeet Azidah at Jurong West St 91. After meeting  her, Azli saw Azidah walking \naway from the car with the plastic bag that Roszaidi  had packed.  It is obvious \nthat none  of this evidence implicates Azli in a charge of abetting  the trafficking  \nof diamorphine because the element  of knowledge  on his part has not been \nproved.\n12 The Prosecution relies on the undisputed evidence that Azli bought a \ndigital weighing  scale  for Roszaidi on the latter\u2019s  instructions.  Azli also had \npink envelopes and empty  plastic packets  in his possession.  He also admitted  to \nconsuming methamphetamine. Methamphetamine was also found in his car and \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Aishamudin bin Jamaludin [2019]  SGHC  08\n6he admitted that they were for his consumption. The car was rented by Azli from \none Amimnathlan Bin Rahmat,  and he (Azli)  was paid between $100 to $200 \nby Roszaidi each time he drives for him. One important allegation disputed by \nAzli is that he had an agreement with Roszaidi  to drive him around to collect  \ndrugs, and he also denies that he delivered  diamorphine on 6 October 2015 on \nRoszaidi\u2019s instructions.  \n13 The Prosecution submitted that on the above facts,  \u201cAzli had done an \nact that facilitated Roszaidi [in collecting the drugs] from Aishamudin at Bulim  \nAvenue and to give the drugs to Azidah\u201d.  The alleged act of facilitating \nRoszaidi\u2019s crime was in \u201c[driving]  Roszaidi around to collect and deliver  the \ndrugs [as charged]\u201d.  Furthermore, the Prosecution submitted that the \n\u201cpresumption under s 18(2) of the MDA  applied to Azli, as he was deemed to \nhave possession of the drugs  by virtue of s 18(4) of the MDA\u201d. Section  18(4) of \nthe MDA  provides as follows: \n(4) Where one of 2 or more persons with the knowledge and \nconsent of the rest has any controlled drug in his possession, it \nshall be deemed  to be in the possession  of each and all of them. \n14 Azli may be presumed to be jointly  in possession of the drugs  if he knew \nof the drugs in Roszaidi\u2019s possession, and had consented to Roszaidi having \nthose drugs. To invoke s 18(4) of the MDA as the Prosecution seeks to do, the \nProsecution must  prove that Azli knew that Roszaidi  had drugs in his \npossession, and consented to them  being  in his possession. Although s 18(4) \nmay oblige this court  to presume that Azli and Roszaidi were in joint possession \nof the diamorphine, it does not presume  that Azli had the knowledge and \nconsent that is necessary to invoke  the presumption. Those facts must  first be \nproven by the  Prosecution before the presumption  in s 18(4) can  apply.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Aishamudin bin Jamaludin [2019]  SGHC  08\n715 At this point, I will have to refer  to the drugs as \u201cdrugs\u201d and not \n\u201cdiamorphine\u201d because  the evidence  shows  that Azli did not seem to care what \ndrugs he was helping  Roszaidi traffic  with. Both Azli and Roszaidi  gave \nconflicting and contradictory statements  in relation to whether Azli knew that \nRoszaidi was in possession of drugs. \n16 Roszaidi\u2019s cautioned statement  declared that [Azli] \u201c[was] only a \ndriver\u201d. Yet Roszaidi\u2019s subsequent statements indicated that Azli knew that he \n(Roszaidi) would be transporting diamorphine,  and that they had an agreement \nfor Azli to drive Roszaidi  around  to collect drugs. At trial, Roszaidi testified  \nthat he made a mistake  when he previously made  statements to the effect that \nAzli knew that he (Roszaidi) was collecting  diamorphine, and that he \u201cknew \nwhat job I am doing\u201d. I am not convinced by Roszaidi\u2019s testimony at trial, which \nappeared to be a belated attempt  to absolve  Azli of criminal liability.\n17 In his cautioned  statement, Azli  stated:\nI thought yesterday was just a quick meet-up with [Roszaidi\u2019s]  \nfriend to collect ice and then go back.  I did not know he was \ndealing in a large amount of drugs.\nSubsequent statements given by Azli indicated that he was \u201csuspicious\u201d that \nRoszaidi was collecting  drugs, and not methamphetamine or \u201cice\u201d in particular.\n18 On the whole,  it is clear that Azli knew that Roszaidi was out to transport \ndrugs that evening, and had consented  to Roszaidi  bringing into his car drugs  of \nany nature when he (Azli) agreed  to drive him (Roszaidi) around  to collect and \ndeliver drugs. Azli\u2019s  claim that he thought Roszaidi was collecting only \nmethamphetamine is unsubstantiated. Furthermore, there is no evidence that \nAzli had made  any attempts at verifying or enquiring as to the nature of the \ndrugs that Roszaidi was transporting. As the nature of the drugs  did not matter \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Aishamudin bin Jamaludin [2019]  SGHC  08\n8to Azli, I find that he had the necessary  knowledge  and had given the requisite \nconsent to invoke  the application of s 18(4) of the MDA. Therefore, Azli is \npresumed to be in joint possession of the drugs trafficked by Roszaidi,  which in \nthis case, was diamorphine.  I am of the view that Azli did not rebut this \npresumption.\n19 Section 18(2)  of the MDA in turn applies to deem Azli as having  known \nthe nature of the drugs as diamorphine.  I also see no basis  on which he can rebut \nthis presumption. Azli\u2019s unsupported assertion that he thought Roszaidi was \ntrafficking in methamphetamine is not sufficient  to rebut this presumption.  \nFurthermore, Azli had the opportunity to verify or enquire about the nature  of \nthe drugs, but deliberately declined  to do so. In this case, there is no evidence \nthat allows  me to find that Azli had good grounds not to  enquire.\n20 In view  of the above, I am satisfied that Azli was abetting  Roszaidi by \ntransporting Roszaidi and the diamorphine  in his (Azli\u2019s) car. For a charge of \nabetment to be made out, the abettor must have  the intention  for the primary \noffender (in this case Roszaidi) to carry out the conduct abetted (namely,  to \ntraffic in diamorphine).  Azli had the intention to aid Roszaidi to carry  out the \ntrafficking of diamorphine, the nature of which  he is presumed to know by \nvirtue of the presumptions  in ss 18(2)  and 18(4) of the MDA.  I am therefore \nsatisfied that the charge against him has been proved, and I find him guilty  and \nsentence him  to suffer death.\n21 I next turn to the case against Roszaidi. Suhaizam drove the lorry with \nAishamudin in the passenger seat from Malaysia  to Bulim Avenue in Singapore \nwhere Aishamudin handed the plastic bag containing diamorphine to Roszaidi.  \nI am satisfied that it was Roszaidi who collected the diamorphine  from \nAishamudin, and that he repacked the diamorphine in Azli\u2019s car before  handing \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Aishamudin bin Jamaludin [2019]  SGHC  08\n9them to Azidah. Roszaidi denies  any knowledge of what  he had taken from  \nAishamudin, or what he had handed  to Azidah, but his testimony in court was \nnot consistent with his own statements,  and he had no satisfactory explanation  \nin respect of the evidence of Aishamudin, Mirwazy, and Azli against  him. With \nthe diamorphine in his possession, he was obliged  to rebut the presumption  \nunder law that he knew that he was in possession of diamorphine. His testimony \nfails to free him from  that presumption.  I therefore  find Roszaidi  guilty  as \ncharged and sentence him to suffer death.\n22 Finally, I turn to the case against Aishamudin.  Unlike Azli and Roszaidi, \nwho were both separately charged  although for the same bag of diamorphine,  \nAishamudin was charged with Suhaizam with having the common intention of \ntrafficking in that same bag of diamorphine. I shall set out in full the charge \nagainst Suhaizam and Aishamudin.\n23  The charge against Suhaizam  reads as follows: \n\u2026 on 6 October 2015 sometime  before  10.00 p.m., in the \nvicinity of Bulim Avenue, Singapore, together with one \n[Aishamudin], and in furtherance of the common  intention of \nyou both, did traffic in a Class \u2018A\u2019 controlled drug listed  in the \nFirst Schedule to the [MDA],  to wit, by delivering two (02) \npackets containing not less than 921.50 grams of \ngranular\/powdery substance, which was analysed  and found \nto contain not less than 14.99 grams of diamorphine, to one \n[Roszaidi], without authorisation  under the [MDA] or the \nRegulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed \nan offence  under section 5(1)(a) of the [MDA] read with section \n34 of the [Penal Code], and punishable under section 33(1)  of \nthe [MDA].\n24 The charge against Aishamudin reads as follows:\n\u2026 on 6 October  2015 sometime before  10.00 pm, in the vicinity \nof Bulim Avenue, Singapore,  together with one [Suhaizam], and \nin furtherance of the common intention of you both, did traffic \nin a Class \u2018A\u2019 controlled drug listed  in the First Schedule to the \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Aishamudin bin Jamaludin [2019]  SGHC  08\n10[MDA], to wit, by delivering two (02) packets containing not less \nthan 921.50 grams of granular\/powdery substance, which was \nanalysed and found to contain  not less than 32.54 grams  of \ndiamorphine, to one [Roszaidi], without authorisation under the \n[MDA] or the Regulations made  thereunder, and you have \nthereby committed an offence under section 5(1)(a)  of the [MDA] \nread with section 34 of the [Penal Code],  and punishable  under \nsection 33(1)  or section 33B of the [MDA].\n25 The charge against Suhaizam refers to the bag as containing  \ndiamorphine analysed to contain not less than 14.99g of diamorphine, whereas \nthe charge against Aishamudin refers to the bag as containing  not less than \n32.54g of diamorphine. The Prosecution submitted that the difference  was due \nto the Public Prosecutor  exercising his prosecutorial  discretion. \n26 The Public Prosecutor has an absolute discretion to prosecute an accused \nfor a lower offence than another accused  on similar and related facts. In this \ncase, Aishamudin can only be said to be trafficking in not less than 32.54g of \nthe drugs seized if he is charged with the common intention with Suhaizam to \ndo so. The corresponding charge of Suhaizam  refers to not less than 14.99g of \ndiamorphine. The two men cannot  have  the common  intention  if they intended \nto traffic in different amounts. Logically, one can say that the larger amount  of \nAishamudin includes the lower amount of Suhaizam, but the lower  amount of \nSuhaizam cannot  possibly include the larger amount of Aishamudin. Let us \nexamine this argument further. \n27 Assume the situation  of two men, A and B, who formed a common \nintention to steal a bag of money amounting to $500. They are caught and the \nbag of money is seized. They may be charged  with the common  intention  of \nstealing a bag containing $500, or they may be charged with the common \nintention of stealing a lower, but same amount. A cannot be charged for having \nthe common intention of stealing not less than $100 with B, when  B is charged \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Aishamudin bin Jamaludin [2019]  SGHC  08\n11with having  a common  intention  with A to steal not less than $500. The logic \nseems skewed,  the math does not add  up.\n28 The facts and the charges against Aishamudin and Suhaizam are not the \nsame as those in Chan  Heng Kong and another v PP [2002] SGCA 18 (\u201cChan  \nHeng Kong\u201d). In that case, Sng was convicted of a capital offence for abetting  \nthe principal offender,  Choong  Peng, to be in possession of drugs for the \npurpose of trafficking. The key was the weight of the drugs that each was \ncharged for. Choong Peng was charged and convicted of a lesser amount, and \nthus spared the death penalty,  but Sng was charged for abetting Choong Peng \nto be in possession for the purpose of trafficking the full amount.

Clause 12 stipulates that it is governed by English law and disputes are to be referred to arbitration in London. The onward contract between BWF and BWX (the \u201cBWF-BWX Contract\u201d) was finalised by facsimile on 3 May 2018. 4', 'The price BWX was to pay BWF was US$30,253,600. BWF\u2019s intended profit as intermediary was therefore the differential of $8,000.', '6\\u2003According to BWF, such intermediary deals are common in the industry, to enable traders to meet trade volume targets for the financial year; for the intermediaries involved, it is a way to gain experience in relation to new markets or new products. 5', 'On BWF\u2019s part, this transaction enabled it to satisfy the trade volume set by its parent company and to gain experience in trading crude oil. Mr Bui thought this would be useful to prepare for a future refinery project and to gain exposure to the Chinese market. 6', 'In some cases, there was also an industry practice to have a written side agreement. On 3 May 2018, Mr Bui requested Mr Shi to formalise the intermediary role and the pay when paid condition in a separate tripartite agreement. 7', 'Mr Shi responded, while reiterating that BWF would not be required to pay BWG pending receipt of payment from BWX, that BWG preferred not to have such a written agreement.', '7\\u2003Prior to BWF being approached by BWX \u2013 and BWF contends, unknown to it \u2013 on 6 April 2018, Mr Muda, a trader at BWX, emailed BWG to propose a deal where BWG would purchase the Cargo on a delivered ex-ship basis 8', 'from BWX and sell it to BWF. Under this proposal, BWG would have to pay BWX within 30 days, and would be paid by BWF within 90 days of the Notice of Readiness (\u201cNOR\u201d) Date. 9', 'BWG agreed to the proposal on 13 April 2018, subject to the completion of the contractual documentation. 10', 'The written contract between BWX and BWG was finalised on 27 April 2018, the same date as the Contract. The effect of this series of contracts was that the same Cargo would originate with BWX and return to BWX.', '8\\u2003On 24 April 2018, BWG sent its invoice to BWF for the sum of US$ 30,245,600, stated to fall due on 11 July 2018, 11', 'on the premise that BWG discharged the Cargo at the contractually agreed destination port, Dongjiakou. 12', 'Subsequently, on 4 May 2018, BWF in turn sent its commercial invoice dated 24 April 2018 to BWX for the sum of US$30,253,600, stated to fall due on 10 July 2018. 13', 'The parties now disagree over whether there is sufficient evidence of proper delivery of the Cargo.', '9\\u2003BWX did not make payment to BWF, and BWF subsequently failed to pay the amount of US$30,245,600 to BWG, that being the amount owed to BWG under the Contract, excluding interest accruals (\u201cthe Disputed Debt\u201d). 14', 'By 3 July 2018, it became clear that BWX was unable to effect payment of the purported purchase price for the Cargo to BWF by 10 July 2018. 15', '10\\u2003On the morning of 4 July, Mr Bui and a colleague from BWF met with a BWG representative, Mr Chew. Mr Bui and his colleague state on affidavit that Mr Chew revealed that BWG had purchased the Cargo from BWX, and had procured Credit Agricole to issue a letter of credit to BWX, which had paid out 30 days after the purported NOR. 16', 'BWX had therefore received US$30 million from BWG. 17', 'This was the first time, Mr Bui states, that he had any inkling that the series of deals were in fact a financing transaction pursuant to which BWG loaned US$30 million to BWX. Mr Bui decided then that it was crucial for the tripartite agreement to be recorded in writing, and made the request. 18', 'Representatives from BWX, BWF and BWG met for this purpose. 19', 'At the conclusion of the meeting, BWX stated that it would follow on with an instalment payment proposal for payment to BWF. 20', 'Matters between BWF and BWG, on the other hand, remained unresolved as Mr Bui rejected Mr Chew\u2019s request to pay BWG before BWF was paid by BWX.', '11\\u2003On 6 July 2018, BWX sent a proposed repayment schedule to BWF. This was forwarded by BWF to BWG. 21', 'BWG refused to accept any change in contractual terms for payment, and sent payment reminders instead to BWF on 9 and 12 July 2018. 22', '12\\u2003On 12 July 2018, BWF sent an email to BWG stating that they would like to settle the matter amicably and would write to BWG on a \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d basis. On the same day, BWF entered into a settlement agreement with BWX (\u201cthe Settlement Agreement\u201d), providing for payment of the sum of USD 30,253,600 in four instalments. 23', '13\\u2003Concurrently and separately, Mr Bui had discussed the matter with Ms Li, a Senior Manager at a Chinese state-owned oil trading company, who made investigations which included conversations with Mr Xu Yuan, the general manager of Hai Yuan Trading Pte Ltd, a wholly owned Singapore incorporated subsidiary of Haike Chemical Group Ltd (\u201cHaike\u201d), an independent oil refiner in China, on 16 and 21 August 2018. 24', 'Ms Li affirmed an affidavit to the effect that Hai Yuan was the receiver named in the NOR tendered by BWG to BWF. 25', 'Hai Yuan, being the procurement arm of Haike, purchases crude oil for importation into China, which is then utilised as feedstock by Haike\u2019s refinery. The contention was that this transaction in question involved the purchase of cargo from Petrobas, to Hai Yuan, and on to Haike. Unauthorised copies of the documents had been made by an employee of Haike, which were then used as source documents to create the documents that were used in this case. Ms Li believed that the present transaction was a phantom trade, creating only an impression of a physical trade, in order for BWX to obtain a loan from BWG. 26', '14\\u2003On 13 August 2018, BWG served a statutory demand under s 254 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe Companies Act\u201d) (\u201cthe Statutory Demand\u201d) on BWF. 27', 'BWF responded on 20 August 2018 to dispute the debt claim, requesting that the dispute be referred to arbitration, and for BWG to desist from winding-up proceedings. Solicitors further corresponded without a successful resolution, and on 3 September 2018, BWF filed an originating summons to set aside the Statutory Demand, and to ask for an injunction to restrain winding up proceedings.', '15\\u2003In the meanwhile, BWX breached the Settlement Agreement with BWF on 10 August 2018, when the first instalment of US$5,000,000 fell unpaid. BWF exercised its rights pursuant to Clause 4 of the Settlement Agreement on 17 August 2018, entitling BWF to treat the entire Settlement Sum as falling due and owing on 10 July 2018. 28', 'Subsequently, BWF\u2019s solicitors served BWX with a letter on 30 August 2018 requiring payment of the sums outstanding under the Settlement Agreement. After the failure of BWX to pay or make any offer to secure or compound the debt to the satisfaction of BWF, BWF filed CWU 260\/2018 on 1 November 2018 to wind-up BWX. As at 2 January 2019 when I dealt with this application, CWU 260\/2018 had been stayed by another judge pending the outcome of an application brought by BWX under s 211B of the Companies Act.'"}
{"casename":"2019_SGHC_82","fact":"'3\\u2003The first plaintiff, Mr Koh Kim Teck (\u201cMr Koh\u201d), currently resides in Singapore. Prior to his relocation, Mr Koh had a successful career, first, as a stock dealer and, later, as a manager at various financial institutions in Malaysia. Upon his retirement at 50, Mr Koh was the senior general manager and a shareholder of a stockbroking company that was previously listed in Malaysia. 1', 'The second plaintiff, Smiling Sun Limited (\u201cSmiling Sun\u201d), is a company registered in the British Virgin Islands (\u201cBVI\u201d). It was set up to facilitate Mr Koh\u2019s investment activities with the Bank. In these grounds of decision, no distinction is drawn between Mr Koh and Smiling Sun except where necessary and the term \u201cplaintiffs\u201d will be used occasionally to describe Mr Koh and Smiling Sun collectively.', '4\\u2003The circumstances surrounding the opening of the plaintiffs\u2019 account with the Bank and the assurances given to entice Mr Koh to invest with the Bank were matters of some dispute. Regardless, it was accepted that Mr Koh became a client of the Bank sometime in 2003. In September 2003, Smiling Sun was incorporated, with its shares held by the Bank\u2019s nominee shareholder on trust for Mr Koh. 2', 'A nominee and\/or agent of the Bank was also pointed as a corporate director of Smiling Sun. 3', 'Mr Koh was and remains the sole beneficial owner of Smiling Sun. 4', 'On or around the time Smiling Sun was incorporated, the account was also opened under Smiling Sun\u2019s name. This was the account Mr Koh would eventually carry out his investment activities from. The account was a non-discretionary account. 5', '5\\u2003To Mr Koh\u2019s recollection, there was little investment activity in the early years of the account. 6', 'However, from 2006, Mr Koh began to trade more heavily through the account. Over the course of 2007 and 2008, Mr Koh purchased structured products known as knock-out discount accumulators (\u201cKODAs\u201d) and dual currency investments (\u201cDCIs\u201d) from the Bank. 7', '6\\u2003A KODA is an over-the-counter structured derivative product that is typically used by investors to accumulate shares at a discounted price in hopes of selling the accumulated shares at a higher market price at a future date. Under a KODA, the investor purchases a pre-determined number of shares (\u201cunderlying shares\u201d) during the term of the KODA, typically between 6 to 12 months. The purchase price of the shares (\u201cstrike price\u201d) is fixed at a discount and therefore below the market price of these shares at the time the customer enters into the KODA. The investor agrees to purchase a pre-determined number of shares on each business day at the strike price during the term of the KODA. The investor is therefore obliged to pay for and take delivery of these purchased shares on a regular basis. The termination of the KODA depends on the \u201cknock-out price\u201d, which is a pre-determined price agreed on by the investor: 8', '(a)\\u2003If the market price of the underlying shares rises above the knock-out price, the KODA will be effectively terminated. The investor will have to pay for and take delivery of any shares that were purchased before termination at the strike price.', '(b)\\u2003If the market price of the underlying shares remains below the knock-out price, the investor is obligated to purchase the pre-determined number of shares at the strike price for the duration of the term of the KODA, even if the market price of the underlying shares falls below the strike price.', '7\\u2003In short, a KODA enables an investor to purchase the underlying shares at a significant discount to the market price. But if the market price of the underlying shares falls under the strike price for an extended period during the term of the KODA, the investor\u2019s loss will be the difference between the market price of the shares and the strike price at which the investor has to buy the shares under the KODA. 9', '8\\u2003A variation obliges the investor to purchase double (or another multiple) the number of shares at the strike price for each day on which the market price of the underlying shares falls below the strike price. Such KODAs have lower strike prices, thus giving a greater discount on the purchase of the underlying shares. 10', 'Mr Koh referred to these KODAs as having a \u201cmultiplying effect\u201d.', '9\\u2003Between 8 October 2007 and 29 August 2008, Mr Koh purchased 29 KODAs through the account. 11', 'Mr Koh claims that the Bank did not properly advise him on the effect of the KODAs on the account and failed to adequately bring to his attention key information about the KODAs, such as the penalty to be paid for premature termination of the KODAs and the multiplying effect of certain KODAs.', '10\\u2003DCIs are short-term structured investment products under which an investor deposits a principal sum in a selected investment currency with the bank for a fixed tenure or term. An alternative currency and a pre-determined conversion rate between the investment currency and alternative currency are agreed on at the outset. The principal sum will be repaid with the yield at maturity. The bank has the option of repaying the principal and yield either in the original investment currency or in the alternative currency after conversion at the pre-determined conversion rate. This decision depends on the market foreign exchange rate on the day of the trade and the pre-determined conversion rate: 12', '(a)\\u2003If the investment currency against the alternative currency is weaker than the pre-determined conversion rate at maturity, the principal will be redeemed in the investment currency.', '(b)\\u2003If the investment currency against the alternative currency is stronger than the pre-determined conversion rate at maturity, the repayment is in the alternative currency, converted at the pre-determined conversion rate.', '11\\u2003A loss may result if the investment currency is repaid in the alternative currency. The investor thus bears the currency risks and the speculative risks in fixing the pre-determined conversion rate. DCIs are not principal protected and are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The DCIs purchased by Mr Koh generally involved Australian dollar (\u201cAUD\u201d) and Japanese Yen (\u201cJPY\u201d) pairings.', '12\\u2003Between 21 February 2008 and 23 October 2008, Mr Koh purchased 891 DCIs through the account. 13', 'Mr Koh stated that he did not know that DCIs involved significant risk and that the risks that eventuated would affect the account. 14', '13\\u2003Having procured a credit facility for the account in 2006, the investments made through the account were funded primarily, if not entirely, by credit. In return for the credit facility, Smiling Sun had to maintain sufficient collateral in the account. The credit limit of the facility was increased at various points; the collateral requirements were also correspondingly increased. As it transpired, the investments in structured products, the portfolio of the account and drawdowns on the credit facility led to substantial credit exposure.', '14\\u2003Sometime around September to October 2008, the collapse of Lehman Brothers sparked off a global financial crisis by which stock markets worldwide were hit. One of the several ramifications of the crisis was that the AUD rapidly depreciated against the JPY. The sudden and significant depreciation of the AUD against the JPY resulted in Mr Koh sustaining substantial losses as his investments were heavily concentrated in the AUD, while the loans were substantially in the JPY. The corresponding decrease in collateral values resulted in a substantial collateral shortfall in the account.', '15\\u2003On 24 October 2008 at about 10am, Mr Koh received a close out notice from the Bank informing him that he had until 2pm to provide a top-up of US$5.7m. Mr Koh claimed that this close out notice gave an unreasonably short length of time for him to furnish additional collateral and that he would have been able to do so had he been given a reasonable amount of time. Further, the entire close out fiasco might have been avoided if he had known that the account was in a collateral shortfall earlier. 15', '16\\u2003Suffice it to say that Mr Koh did not provide the top-up. The Bank proceeded to close out all of the account\u2019s open investment positions, including the KODAs and DCIs that were then in place, and liquidated all the assets in the account.', '17\\u2003It was also not really disputed that the KODAs and DCIs and the drawdowns on the credit facility contributed to the collateral shortfall in the account. This shortfall, in turn, led to the eventual close out of the account and the losses that are now the subject of the present action. The ultimate question that falls to be decided is whose responsibility it is to bear the losses arising from the close out.', '18\\u2003As a result of the close out, Mr Koh suffered losses of US$26m. Mr Koh sought to reclaim his losses by pursuing actions against the Bank for breaches of the Bank\u2019s duties of care in contract and tort, claiming that the Bank failed in its duties by advising him to invest in products that were unsuitable for his purposes and by mismanaging his account. The Bank\u2019s response was that that it owed Mr Koh no duty of care; furthermore, Mr Koh was not a risk-adverse and naive investor. The Bank contended that he had been fully apprised of the risks involved, and had made his own investment decisions that resulted in his losses.'"}

The accused\u2019s wife worked the night shift and would only return to the flat in the morning.', '8\\u2003The first, second and fourth victims, Victim 1 (\u201cV1\u201d), Victim 2 (\u201cV2\u201d) and Victim 4 (\u201cV4\u201d) are V3\u2019s female friends from primary school. When the offences were committed against them, they were 14 years old; by the time of the hearing, they were all 16 years old.', '9\\u2003Often, V1, V2 and V4 would spend time at the flat. They would occasionally stay overnight. In particular, V1 and V3 were close friends since childhood; V1 stayed on the 12th floor of the same block of flats.', '10\\u2003On 17 August 2017, at about 6.09am, the police received a 999-call seeking police assistance at the flat. Upon arrival at the flat at about 6.22am, the police officers met V1, V2 and V3. They interviewed the victims, and seized, inter alia, some \u201cEpam Nitrazepam BP 5mg\u201d pills from the flat. Thereafter, the accused was arrested.', '11\\u2003One night in September 2016, V1 went to V3\u2019s flat to get some instant noodles from V3. The accused was alone at home. He opened the door. V1 went in to collect the instant noodles from the living room. As V1 was about to leave, the accused told her that there was \u201csomething\u201d outside the flat, and not to go home yet. As such, V1 waited in the flat.', '12\\u2003After some time, V1 told the accused that she wanted to go home. As the accused went to the door to open it for her, he suddenly pretended to be spiritually possessed. He acted strangely, performing \u201csilat\u201d moves and speaking in a deep voice. The accused then removed his T-shirt, pulled down his jeans, and moved nearer to V1. In Malay, he told her that if she wanted him to become normal again, she had to give him a \u201cblow job\u201d.', '13\\u2003At that time, V1 was feeling very afraid. She was seated on the floor against the wall with her eyes closed. The accused proceeded to kneel in front of V1. When V1 opened her eyes, she saw that he was completely naked and that his penis was erect. The accused then asked V1 to open her mouth. She told him that she did not want to. The accused continued to ask her to open her mouth. Out of fear, V1 relented and opened her mouth. While still kneeling, the accused then put his penis in V1\u2019s mouth and instructed her to suck his penis as he moved his penis in and out of her mouth. For a few minutes, this continued until the accused ejaculated in V1\u2019s mouth. Then, the accused instructed V1 to swallow his semen. She did as he told.', '14\\u2003Thereafter, the accused ran out of the flat. When he ran back into the flat, he pretended to return to normal, and asked V1 what had happened. Then, the accused got dressed. He gave V1 a cup of water, apologised to her and told her not to tell anyone about what had happened. After some time, the accused brought V1 back to her flat.', '15\\u2003V1 did not consent to the accused penetrating her mouth with his penis.', '16\\u2003Sometime in late September 2016, V4 had run away from home and was at the flat with V3, when she told the accused of her running away from home. The accused allowed V4 to stay at the flat. Thereafter, V4 would sleep in the bedroom with V3 at night. The accused would sleep in the living room, while his wife worked night shifts.', '17\\u2003On 4 October 2016, sometime in the morning, V4 was asleep alone in the bedroom at the flat. By then, V3 had left for school. The accused entered the bedroom and woke V4 up. He told her that he wanted her to satisfy him.', '18\\u2003The accused then touched V4\u2019s breast over her T-shirt. Quickly, V4 took a pillow to cover her chest. Then, the accused then told V4 that that she was staying for free at the flat, and he wanted her to give him a \u201cblow job\u201d. V4 was frightened and began crying. Pretending that she needed to relieve herself, V4 quickly went to the toilet. In the toilet, V4 sent text messages to V2 to seek help. In turn, V2 informed V3 of what had happened. V3 then approached one of her teachers to seek help.', '19\\u2003Later that morning, two teachers from V3\u2019s secondary school arrived at the flat. They escorted V4 away.', '20\\u2003After the previous incident, V1 only went to the flat when she was with V3.', '21\\u2003On the night of 2 July 2017, V1 was watching movies with V3 in V3\u2019s bedroom. After V3 fell asleep, V1 went out of the bedroom to use the toilet. she saw the accused who was in the living room. The accused asked her where a \u201cLAN\u201d gaming shop she and V3 frequented was. V1 replied that it was at Geylang Lorong 42. The accused asked her to bring him there. V1 wanted to wake V3 up but the accused told her not to.', '22\\u2003The accused and V1 then rode to the LAN gaming shop on the accused\u2019s electronic bicycle. When they got there, V1 asked the accused if she could meet with her friends. He did not allow her to. Instead, the accused brought her to his friend\u2019s house at Chai Chee. They then left at about midnight. While they were on the way back to the flat, the accused\u2019s electronic bicycle\u2019s battery went flat. He parked it at a \u201cCaltex\u201d petrol kiosk nearby. Then, the accused brought V1 to the fourth floor of the multi-storey carpark of Joo Chiat Complex, which was a short walk away.

The accused became angry, and he continued to ask V1 to give him a \u201cblow job\u201d. When V1 continued to refuse, the accused held her neck with his hand and threatened to punch her, while making a gesture of punching her stomach. V1 kept quiet and continued crying, feeling helpless and afraid for her safety.', '24\\u2003The accused then unzipped his jeans and took out his penis. Out of fear, V1 complied with the accused\u2019s demand and knelt down. The accused then inserted his penis into her mouth, moving it in and out.

{"casename":"2019_SGHC_86","fact":"'6\\u2003As stated, BAL was a company listed on the Catalist Board of the SGX-ST prior to the RTO described earlier. Its shares were suspended from trading because it became a \u201ccash company\u201d as defined under Rule 1017 of the SGX-ST Catalist Rules (the \u201cCatalist Rules\u201d). BAL was under the threat of being de-listed if it was unable to meet the requirements under the Catalist Rules within 12 months. In other words, it had to acquire new operating businesses before the end of the 12-month period. CSFH was interested in seeking a listing via a RTO and BAL was the target company. Accordingly, through a RTO, CSFH acquired BAL and the operating business of CSFH was effectively brought under BAL. After completion of the RTO, BAL changed its name to China Star.', '7\\u2003The facts of the case are mainly not in dispute and the parties have helpfully provided a list of agreed facts (the \u201cAgreed Facts\u201d). I will set out the factual background, before explaining the parties\u2019 respective case. The narrative below explains the RTO exercise in some detail with reference to the relevant documentation. Notably, in some instances, the language used in the documentation does not amount to firm commitments, but rather assumptions and examples for illustration purposes.', '8\\u2003On 5 November 2014, BAL entered into a sale and purchase agreement (the \u201cSPA\u201d) with all the original shareholders of CSFH (the \u201cOriginal Vendors\u201d). At this point in time, Mr Cheong had yet to enter the picture. Clauses 2.3 and 2.4 of the SPA provide that the Original Vendors would sell to BAL all the issued and fully paid ordinary shares in CSFH for S$168,000,000 (the \u201cProposed Acquisition\u201d), which was to be satisfied by BAL issuing and allotting 840,000,000 new and fully-paid ordinary shares in the capital of BAL (the \u201cConsideration Shares\u201d) to the Original Vendors in proportion to their equity interest in CSFH at the \u201cIssue Price\u201d defined in cl 1.1 of the SPA. The \u201cIssue Price\u201d for each Consideration Share, as provided under cl 1.1, is S$0.20. Besides the Consideration Shares to be allotted, there are three other categories of shares stipulated under the SPA:', '(a)\\u2003The Arranger Shares (cl 2.5): an arranger fee of S$5.5 million payable was to be fully satisfied at completion by way of issuance and allotment of an aggregate 27,500,000 new shares to the Arranger at the Issue Price (defined in cl 1.1);', '(b)\\u2003The PPCF Shares (cl 2.6): a professional fee of S$700,000.00 payable to PrimePartners Corporate Finance Pte Ltd (\u201cPPCF\u201d), which was China Star\u2019s sponsor for the RTO, was to be fully satisfied at completion by way of issuance and allotment of 3,500,000 new shares to PPCF at the Issue Price (defined in cl 1.1); and', '(c)\\u2003The Compliance Placement Shares (cl 2.9): BAL may be required under the Catalist Rules to place out new shares to satisfy the minimum distribution and shareholding spread requirements following completion by way of a compliance placement.', '9\\u2003Clause 2.9 of the SPA on the Compliance Placement Shares forms a central disagreement between the parties: 2', '10\\u2003Pausing here, the \u201cIssue Price\u201d in cl 2.4 is defined in cl 1.1 and it is S$0.20 cents. However, the \u201cissue price\u201d in cl 2.9 is not the same as the \u201cIssue Price\u201d in cl 2.4. Clause 2.9 concerns the minimum issue price for RTOs and it duly tracks the admission standard applicable to RTOs.', '11\\u2003The relevant rules in the Catalist Rules are Rule 406(1) and Rule 1015(3), and it can be seen that cl 2.9 is a reproduction of these Rules: 3', '12\\u2003These Rules should be read together with SGX-ST\u2019s guidance note that \u201c[i]ssuers seeking a listing on SGX via a Reverse Takeover (RTO) are expected to comply with the same admission standards as IPO [ie, initial public offer] aspirants\u201d, and \u201cthe S$0.20 minimum issue price for IPOs should also apply to RTOs\u201d. 4', '13\\u2003Under the SPA, BAL warranted that \u201c\u2026it will use its best commercial endeavours to ensure that all of the Consideration Shares, PPCF Shares and Arranger Shares will be, when issued, duly listed and admitted for trading on the Catalist\u201d in para 5 of Schedule 6 (the \u201cBest Commercial Endeavours Warranty clause\u201d). 5', '14\\u2003On 5 November 2014, BAL made an announcement (\u201cthe Nov 2014 Announcement\u201d) on the Proposed Acquisition and stated the pertinent terms of the SPA, including cl 2.9. The announcement explained that it was expected that the Original Vendors would collectively hold up to approximately 90.8% of the enlarged issued share capital after the issuance and allotment of the Consideration Shares, the Arranger Shares and the PPCF Shares. Thus, BAL would not meet the shareholding spread and distribution requirements set out in Rule 406(1) and Rule 1015(3). As a result, BAL \u201cmay be required under the Catalist Rules to place out new ordinary shares in the Company\u201d and further the Original Vendors \u201cmay also sell their respective Consideration Shares \u2026 to meet the aforesaid requirement\u201d. 6', 'The announcement set out the envisaged shareholding structure of BAL after a compliance placement as follows:', '(a)\\u2003Original Vendors: 840,000,000 shares (81.9% of the enlarged capital);', '(b)\\u2003current shareholders: 53,636,000 shares (5.3% of the enlarged capital);', '(c)\\u2003the Arranger: 27,500,000 shares (2.7% of the enlarged capital);', '(d)\\u2003PPCF: 3,500,000 shares (0.3% of the enlarged capital); and', '(e)\\u2003new public shareholders: 101,000,000 shares (9.8% of the enlarged capital).', 'A note in the Nov 2014 Announcement draws attention to the 101,000,000 shares as an assumption and explains the assumption in the following manner: 7', '15\\u2003Mr Cheong entered the picture in 2015. On 16 April 2015, Mr Cheong entered into a Convertible Loan Agreement (\u201cCLA\u201d) with CSFH and Mr Liang, who is one of the Original Vendors. Pursuant to the CLA, Mr Cheong granted a loan of S$2 million (the \u201cLoan\u201d) to CSFH, which would be automatically converted into 1.98% of the shares of CSFH (\u201cConversion Shares\u201d), calculated to be 64,761 shares, once the shareholders of BAL granted approval for the transactions contemplated by the SPA (cl 5.1(a)). The percentage figure of 1.98% is derived by taking the amount of Loan divided by 60% of the agreed valuation of CSFH (S$168 million). Thus, on automatic conversion of the Loan to CSFH shares, Mr Cheong received a 40% discount based on the agreed valuation of CSFH and its subsidiaries (ie, $168 million). These CSFH shares would then have to be sold to BAL for BAL shares (ie, the Consideration Shares). Clause 5.1(d) of the CLA provided that the number of BAL shares that would be subject to a moratorium is calculated based on the formula stipulated in Rule 422 of the Catalist Rules. The clause stated that \u201c[f]or the purposes of illustration, based on an issue price of S$0.20 for each BAL Share, the Investor is expected to receive 16,632,000 BAL Shares, of which 6,632,000 BAL Shares would be subject to moratorium for a period of 12 months after completion of the RTO\u201d. 8', 'In this illustration, the issue price of S$0.20 is consistent with the formula, which uses the value of the CSFH (S$168 million) and the number of BAL shares (840 million). The number of shares subject to the moratorium represented the \u201cprofit portion of [Mr Cheong\u2019s] investment\u201d, as per the draft letter of moratorium. 9', '16\\u2003On the same day, Mr Cheong entered into a Supplemental Agreement to the SPA (\u201cthe Supplemental Agreement\u201d). Under the Supplemental Agreement, Mr Cheong would, subject to the automatic conversion under the CLA, become a party to and a vendor under the SPA. If the Loan was converted to CSFH shares, Mr Cheong would receive 16,632,000 shares in BAL (at the Issue Price of S$0.20 per share as defined in cl 1.1 of SPA) in exchange for his Conversion Shares on the date of completion of the SPA. The 16,632,000 shares in BAL represented 1.98% of the Consideration Shares. On the same day, BAL made an announcement stating inter alia that the CLA and the Supplemental Agreement have been entered into (\u201cthe April 2015 Announcement\u201d). The announcement explained that the proportional distribution of the Consideration Shares (840,000,000 shares) had thus changed, but reiterated that the Consideration Shares would be issued at S$0.20 each, and that the consideration of S$168 million for the Proposed Acquisition remained unchanged.', '17\\u2003On 26 June 2015, by way of a Notice of Extraordinary General Meeting (\u201cEGM\u201d) issued by BAL to its shareholders, BAL informed its shareholders of an upcoming EGM on 20 July 2015, for the purposes of approving and passing various ordinary resolutions, including the following:', '(a)\\u2003the Proposed Acquisition of the entire issued and paid-up capital of CSFH for S$168 million (\u201cthe Purchase Consideration\u201d);', '(b)\\u2003the proposed allotment and issue at the Issue Price of S$0.20 per share of (i) 840,000,000 Consideration Shares in satisfaction of the Purchase Consideration, (ii) 3,500,000 PPCF Shares, and (iii) 27,500,000 Arranger Shares; and', '(c)\\u2003the proposed allotment and issue of up to 101,000,000 placement shares pursuant to a compliance placement (\u201cthe Proposed Compliance Placement\u201d).', '18\\u2003A circular dated 26 June 2015 (the \u201cJune 2015 Circular\u201d) was also issued by BAL to its shareholders to provide information in relation to the EGM on 20 July 2015. The June 2015 Circular provided, inter alia, that the issue price for each Consideration Share was S$0.20, and that following the Proposed Acquisition, the Enlarged Share Capital would be 924,636,000 shares. It further stated that there would be a Proposed Compliance Placement of up to 101,000,000 placement shares. This means that the enlarged number of issued shares after the Proposed Compliance Placement would be 1,025,636,000. Importantly, the June 2015 Circular explained the Proposed Compliance Placement at para 26: 10', 'The June 2015 Circular defined \u201cPlacement Shares\u201d as \u201c[u]p to 101,000,000 new fully-paid Shares to be allotted and issued at no less than the minimum placement price of S$0.20 per Share pursuant to the Proposed Compliance Placement\u201d. 11', '19\\u2003On 6 July 2015, the Singapore Exchange Limited (\u201cSGX\u201d) sent PPCF a listing and quotation notice (the \u201cLQ Notice\u201d) that was valid for three months for the listing and quotation of the new shares, ie, the Consideration Shares, the Arranger Shares, the PPCF Shares and up to 101,000,000 shares to be issued pursuant to the Proposed Compliance Placement.', '20\\u2003On 20 July 2015, the resolutions as stated in the June 2015 Circular were approved by BAL\u2019s shareholders. In BAL\u2019s media release on the same day, it stated that it would undertake a placement of up to 101,000,000 shares \u201cat no less than the minimum placement price of S$0.20 per Placement Share\u201d after the Proposed Acquisition. 12', '21\\u2003On 21 July 2015, the automatic conversion under the CLA took place, and Mr Cheong was issued 69,811 shares in CSFH, representing 1.98% of the shareholding of CSFH. The number of shares issued differed from that stated in the CLA (see [15] above) because the total number of shares of CSFH changed, but there was no breach of the CLA because the percentage shareholding stayed the same. Pursuant to cl 5.1(b) of the CLA, upon the automatic conversion, the right of Mr Cheong to repayment of the Loan with interests was extinguished. If it had been the case that the automatic conversion did not take place, cl 3.3 of the CLA provided that CSFH was to repay all outstanding sums of the Loan and simple interest at the rate of 8.0% per annum. Pursuant to cl 2.2(a) of the Supplemental Agreement, Mr Cheong became a party to and a vendor under the SPA as a result of the automatic conversion. Upon completion of the RTO on 22 September 2015, Mr Cheong transferred his 69,811 shares in CSFH to BAL, in return for 16,632,000 shares in BAL.', '22\\u2003At the Annual General Meeting (\u201cAGM\u201d) on 22 September 2015, the shareholders of BAL approved an ordinary resolution to give authority to the board to issue new shares whether by way of rights, bonus or otherwise, and to make or grant offers, agreements or options that might require shares to be issued, including but not limited to the creation and issue of options, warrants, debentures or other instruments convertible into shares. BAL changed its name to \u201cChina Star Food Group Limited\u201d with effect from 22 September 2015 and its trading counter name to \u201cChina Star Food\u201d with effect from 9.00am on 28 September 2015.', '23\\u2003On 29 September 2015, SGX sent a letter to PPCF informing that the shares allotted and issued pursuant to the completion of the SPA had been listed and quoted on SGX with effect from 29 September 2015. However, trading remained suspended in anticipation of the Proposed Compliance Placement. This trading suspension was foreshadowed in the June 2015 Circular (see [18] above) in relation to the Proposed Compliance Placement. It is helpful to set out again the relevant passage of the June 2015 Circular:', '24\\u2003On 2 October 2015, PPCF wrote to SGX to request an extension of the validity of the LQ Notice, on the basis that due to \u201cunfavorable current market conditions\u201d, China Star needed time \u201cto finalize the placement agreement and undertake the Proposed Compliance Placement in order to meet admission requirements in respect of the minimum shareholding spread and distribution\u201d. 13', 'On 6 October 2015, SGX granted an extension till 5 December 2015. In the SGX Announcement dated 15 October 2015 made by China Star on this extension granted, China Star stated that \u201c[d]ue to current weak market conditions, the Proposed Compliance Placement has not been effected as at the date of this announcement\u201d. 14', '25\\u2003 By 14 October 2015, the board of China Star was discussing and considering a share consolidation. 15', 'Subsequently in November 2015, China Star proposed to consolidate every four of its existing shares into one share (the \u201cProposed Share Consolidation\u201d), in order to provide flexibility in determining the issue price of compliance placement shares and thereby facilitate the completion of a compliance placement. By a directors\u2019 resolution dated 18 November 2015, the directors of China Star approved the proposed share consolidation on the basis that it was in the best interests of China Star. On the same day, China Star announced the Proposed Share Consolidation (the \u201c18 Nov 2015 Announcement\u201d). It is not disputed that this was the first time of any announcement of a share consolidation being contemplated by China Star. 16', '26\\u2003On 25 November 2015, China Star released a Notice of EGM to be held on 11 December 2015 for the purposes of approving the Proposed Share Consolidation. 17', 'In the circular to its shareholders dated 26 November 2015 (the \u201cShare Consolidation Circular\u201d), the \u201cProposed Compliance Placement\u201d was defined as \u201c[t]he proposed placement of up to 101,000,000 new fully-paid Shares (or up to 25,250,000 new fully-paid Consolidated Shares) at a minimum placement price of no less than S$0.20 per Share to satisfy the minimum distribution and shareholding spread requirements of the Catalist Rules\u201d. 18', 'The Share Consolidation Circular stated that \u201c[t]he Proposed Share Consolidation will have no impact on the issued and paid-up share capital of the Company\u201d and \u201chas no effect on the Shareholders\u2019 funds of the Group\u201d. The \u201cProposed Share Consolidation will not cause any changes to the percentage shareholding of each Shareholder, other than non-material changes due to rounding\u201d. 19', 'The rationale of the Proposed Share Consolidation was stated as follows: 20', '27\\u2003On 27 November 2015, PPCF wrote to SGX again to request a further extension of the LQ Notice for two months \u201cto allow time for [China Star] to finalize the placement agreement and lodge the offer information statement in respect of the Proposed Compliance Placement after the completion of the Proposed Share Consolidation on or about 22 December 2015\u201d. 21', 'In the same letter, PPCF explained to SGX that the Proposed Share Consolidation was to provide flexibility in determining the issue price of the placement shares and thereby facilitate the completion of the proposed compliance placement. On 7 December 2015, SGX granted the extension till 5 February 2016.', '28\\u2003The shareholders of China Star approved the Proposed Share Consolidation at the EGM on 11 December 2015. Subsequently, China Star consolidated every four of its existing shares into one share (the \u201cShare Consolidation\u201d) and this was completed on 22 December 2015. As a result, Mr Cheong\u2019s shares in China Star were reduced from 16,632,000 shares to 4,158,000 shares. Pausing here, Mr Cheong\u2019s complaint in this action is not about the consolidation per se with a theoretical price of S$0.80 per consolidated share. From his viewpoint, he received on his investment of S$2 million 16,632,000 shares at S$0.20 per share and those shares were to be freely tradable. But when the Share Consolidation was later coupled with the issuance of consolidated placement shares at a price much lower than the theoretical issue price, he ended up with 4,158,000 shares at S$0.2026, instead of S$0.80 per consolidated share. From this perspective, Mr Liew, a witness for China Star, agreed with Mr Foo, counsel for Mr Cheong, that the Share Consolidation had an impact on the shareholders\u2019 investments from a valuation perspective but not from a shareholding perspective. 22', 'As I will explain later in the Judgment, these perspectives have no real bearing on the outcome of the action unless they are grounded on some identifiable contractual obligations that are breached.', '29\\u2003Returning to the narrative of the facts, on 3 February 2016, PPCF wrote to SGX to request a further two-month extension of the LQ Notice \u201cto allow time for [China Star] to finalize the placement agreement and lodge the offer information statement in respect of the Proposed Compliance Placement\u201d. 23', 'On 12 February 2016, SGX approved the extension till 5 April 2016. This was the third extension granted by SGX.', '30\\u2003On 15 February 2016, China Star released a SGX announcement on the further extension granted by SGX. The announcement stated, inter alia, that the proposed compliance placement had not been effected and that \u201cshortly after completion of the Share Consolidation, global capital markets experienced significant market volatility, and the Proposed Compliance Placement had to be postponed due to dampened investor interest\u201d. 24', '31\\u2003On 6 April 2016, PPCF submitted an additional listing application to SGX for the listing of:', '(a)\\u200325,250,000 new placement shares (the \u201cConsolidated Placement Shares\u201d) at the issue price of S$0.23 each to be issued and allotted by way of a placement, pursuant to the approval for the Proposed Compliance Placement from the shareholders obtained at the EGM on 20 July 2015 (see [20] above);', '(b)\\u200350,500,000 free detachable listed warrants (the \u201cWarrants\u201d) carrying the right to subscribe for new shares in the capital of China Star at the exercise price of S$0.33 each to be issued in connection with the Consolidated Placement Shares, pursuant to the general mandate obtained at the AGM on 22 September 2015 (see [22] above); and', '(c)\\u2003up to 50,500,000 new shares to be issued and allotted in connection with the exercise of the Warrants (the \u201cWarrant Shares\u201d), pursuant to the general mandate obtained at the AGM on 22 September 2015.', 'In the same application, PPCF stated that the underlying value of two warrants was S$0.2074, and the implied net issue price of a Consolidated Placement Share was S$0.2026.

The sale and purchase was documented in the SPA, which provided for a consideration of $0.48 per share for a total sum of $9,999,840 to be paid by EFII to HMC. 15', '11\\u2003On the same day, Jong, Fan, Aathar, HMD and One Organisation Limited (\u201cOOL\u201d) (collectively known as \u201cthe Warrantors\u201d) executed the DOU, on a joint and several basis, in favour of EFII. 16', 'The DOU is the key document of concern, and these are its material terms.', '12\\u2003By cl 2.1(a) of the DOU, the Warrantors undertook to EFII that during a period of nine months beginning from the completion date of the SPA (\u201cSale Period\u201d), they would \u201cuse reasonable endeavours to source for and procure purchasers for the Sale Shares from [EFII], at a purchase price per Share of no less [sic] S$0.576 or the last traded price of Shares on the SGX-ST, whichever is the higher (the \u201cMinimum Sale Price\u201d) \u2026\u201d [emphasis in original in bold].', '13\\u2003However, should the sale of Sale Shares during the Sale Period be insufficient to raise the sum of $11,999,808 (also known as the \u201cSale Proceeds Target\u201d), by cl 2.1(b) of the DOU, the Warrantors undertook to effect the purchase of the remaining Sale Shares such that EFII receives, in aggregate, the Sale Proceeds Target. Since much of the present dispute relates to when such liability arises, which turns on the exact words used in cl 2.1(b) of the DOU, I set out the relevant provision here: 17', '14\\u2003By cl 2.2, EFII was not precluded from \u201cat any time sourcing for and procuring purchasers for all or any part of the Sale Shares at a price per Share which is no less than the Minimum Sale Price\u201d.', '15\\u2003To round off, by cl 3.1, it was provided that \u201c[t]he obligations of the Warrantors \u2026 shall terminate on the date on which [EFII receives], in aggregate, [proceeds] that are equivalent to the Sale Proceeds Target\u201d.', '16\\u2003To secure the Warrantors\u2019 obligations, by cl 2.3 of the DOU, an undertaking was provided by Jong and OOL to the effect that the Deeds of Assignments would be extended in favour of EFII.', '17\\u2003To explain, on or around 15 June 2011, EFII provided a loan to HMD. 18', 'To secure HMD\u2019s obligations to EFII under the loan transaction, Jong and OOL entered into the Deeds of Assignment. Under these deeds, Jong assigned 40,500,000 ordinary shares in HMC to EFII. As for OOL, a company controlled by Fan and\/or his wife, 19', 'it assigned a total of 135,802,000 ordinary shares in HMC to EFII. 20', 'I shall refer to these shares as \u201cthe Security Shares\u201d. In other words, by cl 2.3 of the DOU, Jong agreed to continue with the existing assignments of his portion of the Security Shares to secure the Warrantors\u2019 obligations under the DOU. It is not disputed that eventually, the loan to HMD was fully repaid. 21', '18\\u2003The Sale Period ran for nine months from the SPA\u2019s completion date of 8 July 2013 to 7 April 2014. Should obligations arise under cl 2.1(b) of the DOU, the Warrantors should perform the obligations no later than 16 April 2014, ie, seven business days after 7 April 2014.', '19\\u2003During the Sale Period, the actual traded prices of IHC shares on the SGX fell significantly lower than the Minimum Sale Price. Eventually, no Sale Shares were sold during the Sale Period. Thereafter, none of the Warrantors purchased or procured the purchase of any of the Sale Shares from EFII, and EFII did not receive the Sale Proceeds Target. 22', 'In this regard, I should add that the parties are not in dispute that any sale could have been conducted in the market or off the market (through private arrangements).', '20\\u2003As the Warrantors did not satisfy EFII\u2019s claim for the Sale Proceeds Target, EFII claims that it engaged in discussions with Aathar and Fan on repayment by the Warrantors. EFII also claims that on 30 September 2014, a sum of $2,000,000 was repaid through Golden Cliff International Limited (\u201cGolden Cliff\u201d), a company purportedly owned by Fan, towards the outstanding sum. Jong disagrees with these assertions.', '21\\u2003Quite some time later, EFII took steps to sell the Sale Shares and the Security Shares. According to EFII, and undisputed by Jong, 23', 'EFII only began to find buyers starting from around December 2015. 24', 'Eventually, EFII recovered the sum of $6,661,526.04 through sales effected from March 2016 to April 2016. 25', '22\\u2003With these background facts in mind, I turn to the parties\u2019 cases.'"}
{"casename":"2019_SGHC_88","fact":"'4\\u2003I do not propose to provide a detailed account of the rather involved background facts. The facts have been set out in various judgments, including two judgments of the High Court. 1', 'Most recently, the facts have been summarised in the Grounds of Decision (\u201cGD\u201d) of the District Judge in Werner Samuel Vuillemin v Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Limited [2018] SGDC 309. This GD was issued by the District Judge to explain why he had affirmed the decision of the Deputy Registrar of the State Courts to strike out the action, leading to RAS 33\/2018 which came before me for hearing.', '5\\u2003Very briefly, the relevant background facts are as follows. The present claim arose from the applicant\u2019s dispute with the respondent over an alleged breach of contract relating to the opening and relocation of a safe deposit box (\u201cthe SDB\u201d). He had hired the SDB in February 1999 from the respondent at its then-existing branch at the Specialists\u2019 Shopping Centre (\u201cSSC\u201d) located on Orchard Road. In June 2007, in preparation for the relocation of the SSC branch to new premises at Orchard Point, the SDB was opened by the respondent and its contents accounted for and kept in a sealed security bag. The applicant had been notified beforehand by mail of the respondent\u2019s intended course of action but he did not respond to the notification.', '6\\u2003There were disagreements between the parties from 2009 onwards over the signing of the respondent\u2019s prescribed release forms before the applicant could take delivery of his items. It was not disputed, however, that since November 2009 the respondent had proposed an alternative \u201copen offer\u201d for the applicant to open the security bag and account for the items within, without requiring him to waive any rights against the respondent. The applicant was not amenable to the \u201copen offer\u201d. He further disputed the respondent\u2019s notification and attempts to contact him prior to the opening of the SDB in June 2007.', '7\\u2003The applicant commenced his claim in the District Court on 7 October 2013. Nearly five years after October 2013, the applicant had not set down the matter for trial. He claimed that he was not ready for trial. In the meantime, there were various interlocutory applications and appeals that reached the High Court, as well as failed applications on the applicant\u2019s part for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal. The applications brought by the applicant were ancillary to the main suit and included, amongst others, applications for an Anton Piller order, a recusal order in respect of a High Court Judge and a committal order against the respondent\u2019s employee. The applicant\u2019s actions prompted the High Court to observe in the 2018 HC decision (at [90]) that these \u201cskirmishes\u201d were needlessly engaging time and resources and distracting from the substantive action.', '8\\u2003I would further note that on 27 September 2017 and 24 October 2017, the respondent had written to inform the applicant that unless the applicant takes all steps as may be necessary to move the action towards trial, the respondent would apply for the claim to be struck out for want of prosecution. This application was eventually filed on 30 May 2018.'"}

The investigations culminated in amended and\/or additional Notices of Assessment being issued to all four of them by IRAS on 19 April 2012 (\u201cthe 19 April 2012 NAs\u201d).

It should be added that despite this denial, Dr Heng and the Three Companies do not appear to dispute that Kam and the Plaintiff did provide some advice and that they did carry out some work for all four Defendants in relation to the issue of a potential challenge to IRAS\u2019 decision. Thus, for example, there are various references to such advice and work in the Defence and Counterclaim. 9', '19\\u2003On 2 March 2015 and 16 June 2015, two invoices 10', 'were issued to the 2nd Defendant, KMHWCPL, for the sums of $25,000 and $20,000 respectively.

On 23 February 2015, the Plaintiff wrote to IRAS stating that a direct appeal to the Income Tax Board of Review (\u201cBoard of Review\u201d) would be pursued. Further correspondence followed in the period of March to mid-June 2015 between Dr Heng and the Chairman of the Board of Review. 15', '23\\u2003On 15 October 2015, a meeting was held at the office of Justicius Law Corporation, a law firm which the four Defendants claim was \u201cappointed by, or on the advice of Mr Kam and\/or the Plaintiff, to advise on the merits of and to prepare an application for judicial review for an order that the Comptroller of Income Tax be compelled to issue a Notice of Refusal to Amend\u201d the 19 April 2012 NAs.

Nevertheless, it is still necessary to \nconsider whether there was a \u201cconveyance, assignment or transfer  on sale\u201d of \nthe Houses to  fulfil  the third requirement.\n7 Mr Tan\u2019s second  submission was that the statutory requirement of a \n\u201cconveyance, assignment  or transfer on sale\u201d was not satisfied since the \npayment of $200,000 - $250,000  was not payment  for the sale of the Houses, \nbut payment for the satisfaction  of the equity that each tenant had in their \nrespective Houses that they built or purchased, and this equity cannot be sold to \nthe Appellant.

This equity may be satisfied  in \nvarious ways and in this instance, it was best satisfied by way of monetary  \ncompensation (See Low Heng  Leong Andy  v Low Kian Beng Lawrence \n(administrator of the estate of Tan Ah Kng, deceased)  [2013] 3 SLR 710 at [25]\u2013\n[27]). In most  cases, the landlord owns the houses on the land. In this case, the \nHouses were  constructed or purchased by the tenants, and thus the tenants not \nthe landlord  owned the Houses.  This is the only difference, but it does not stop \nthe landlord from  evicting  the tenants,  all it means is that any equitable \ncompensation has to be higher to reflect the expenses  incurred by the tenants  in \nbuilding or purchasing the Houses. The Instruments were drafted as payment  \nfor the delivery of vacant possession of the Houses for the Appellant to recover  \nvacant possession of his Land.
