At the material time, the Lims were the sole directors of OTPL, and Oon and Huey were its shareholders.

{"casename":"2021_SGCA_101","fact":"'3\\u2003We begin by setting out the relevant background facts. The backdrop to these applications is our decision in Saravanan Chandaram v Public Prosecutor and another matter [2020] 2 SLR 95 (\u201cSaravanan\u201d), in which we considered the permissibility of the Prosecution\u2019s \u201cdual charging practice\u201d. Under the \u201cdual charging practice\u201d, where a single compressed block of cannabis-related plant material was certified by the Health Sciences Authority as containing (a) cannabis and (b) fragmented vegetable matter containing cannabinol (\u201cCBN\u201d) and tetrahydrocannabinol (\u201cTHC\u201d), the Prosecution would consider preferring both (a) a charge in respect of the portion certified to consist purely of cannabis, and (b) a charge in respect of the portion consisting of fragmented vegetable matter that had been found to contain CBN and THC. We held in Saravanan (at [197] and [198(c)]) that the Prosecution\u2019s \u201cdual charging practice\u201d was impermissible. More recently, we reaffirmed the impermissibility of the Prosecution\u2019s \u201cdual charging practice\u201d in Abdul Karim bin Mohamed Kuppai Khan v Public Prosecutor [2021] 1 SLR 1390 (\u201cAbdul Karim\u201d) at [36].', '4\\u2003The respondents in these applications had been charged with and convicted pursuant to the Prosecution\u2019s \u201cdual charging practice\u201d. Following our decision in Saravanan, the Prosecution filed these applications inviting us to review our previous decisions in relation to the respondents, set aside the cannabis mixture charges that had been preferred against them in accordance with the \u201cdual charging practice\u201d and consequently reconsider the sentences imposed on them. However, by way of a letter dated 15 February 2021 (\u201cthe PP\u2019s Letter\u201d), the Prosecution sought leave to withdraw all four applications. The Prosecution took the stance that Saravanan did not automatically apply to the respondents as their cases pre-dated Saravanan and had been decided in accordance with the prevailing law then.', '5\\u2003After hearing the parties, we granted the Prosecution leave to withdraw the applications. We saw no juridical basis for refusing to allow the Prosecution to do so and the respondents did not contend otherwise. The Public Prosecutor has carriage of prosecutions and is constitutionally vested with prosecutorial power, exercisable at his discretion, in the conduct of any criminal proceedings (see Art 35(8) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1985 Rev Ed, 1999 Reprint) (\u201cthe Constitution\u201d)). That discretion necessarily extends to the continuance or withdrawal of the applications before us. There was also no suggestion that the withdrawal of the applications would be tantamount to an abuse of either the judicial process or prosecutorial power.', '6\\u2003The Prosecution\u2019s withdrawal of the applications nevertheless leaves open the possibility of the respondents filing their own applications to seek to reopen their convictions and\/or sentences. We therefore indicated to the parties that we would issue these written grounds to elaborate on the applicable threshold for the court to revisit its prior disposal of a case where there has been a change in the law. We also highlighted that, following our review of the authorities, the threshold was that of substantial injustice and would not easily be met. It is to this discussion that we now turn.'"}
{"casename":"2021_SGCA_102","fact":"'4\\u2003The material facts are comprehensively set out in the Judge\u2019s decision in CAI v CAJ and another [2021] SGHC 21 (\u201cthe Judgment\u201d). It suffices for us to highlight the salient facts, as follows.', '5\\u2003The parties\u2019 dispute arose from two contracts (\u201cthe Agreements\u201d) for the construction of a polycrystalline silicon plant (\u201cthe Plant\u201d). The respondent\u2019s subsidiary was the owner of the Plant and the appellants were the contractors responsible for the construction of the Plant. During the construction of the Plant, issues arose in connection with excessive vibrations in the compressors which were located in the hydrogen unit of the Plant, which remained unresolved as at the contractual date of mechanical completion. Rectification works were eventually carried out in a piecemeal fashion pursuant to the instructions of the respondent\u2019s subsidiary (\u201cthe Admitted Instruction\u201d).', '6\\u2003 Subsequently, the respondent\u2019s subsidiary commenced an arbitration (\u201cthe Arbitration\u201d) against the appellants. The Arbitration was seated and conducted in Singapore under the auspices of the International Chamber of Commerce (\u201cICC\u201d), pursuant to the 2012 ICC Rules (\u201cICC Rules\u201d). It was heard by a three-member arbitral tribunal consisting of Professor Colin Ong QC (the presiding arbitrator), Professor Doug Jones AO and Dr Reinhard Neumann (collectively, \u201cthe Tribunal\u201d). The respondent was subsequently joined to the Arbitration, as the assignee of its subsidiary\u2019s claim against the appellants.', '7\\u2003In the Arbitration, the respondent sought liquidated damages from the appellants, alleging that the appellants had caused a 144-day delay in the mechanical completion of the Plant due to the excessive vibrations in the compressors within the hydrogen unit. The appellants\u2019 defence in the Arbitration was two-fold. First, the appellants argued that mechanical completion had been achieved on time, as the vibrations did not materially affect the operation or safety of the Plant. Second, the appellants also contended that any delay was a result of the Admitted Instruction, such that the respondent had waived its right to claim liquidated damages or, alternatively, was estopped from doing so (\u201cthe Estoppel Defence\u201d).', '8\\u2003It bears emphasis that the appellants\u2019 pleadings did not contain any assertion that they were contractually entitled to an extension of time so as to reduce the amount of liquidated damages payable. Indeed, the respondent expressly pointed out in its pleadings in the Arbitration that the appellants had not advanced any such argument. Conspicuously, this was not disputed by the appellants at any point in time. In fact, the appellants conceded both in the proceedings below and at the hearing before us that their defence claiming an extension of time (\u201cthe EOT Defence\u201d) had been raised for the first time in their written closing submissions in the Arbitration (see the Judgment at [193]). The EOT Defence was based on General Condition 40 (\u201cGC 40\u201d) of the Agreements, which we shall explain in greater detail below. It suffices for now to note that pursuant to GC 40, the time for mechanical completion could be extended if the delay was by reason of any act or omission of or any default or breach of the Agreements by the respondent\u2019s subsidiary.', '9\\u2003In the respondent\u2019s written closing submissions in the Arbitration, the respondent objected to the appellants\u2019 raising of the EOT Defence, in the following terms:', '10\\u2003In its final award and the addendum to the final award (collectively, \u201cthe Award\u201d), the Tribunal found that the appellants had failed to achieve mechanical completion on time. The Tribunal also rejected the Estoppel Defence. However, the Tribunal accepted the EOT Defence, finding that the EOT Defence was \u201cperfectly capable of consideration by the Tribunal\u201d because the respondent had been given the opportunity to make submissions in response to the appellants\u2019 arguments in its written closing submissions. The Tribunal further observed that the appellants were entitled to make use of the existing evidence in the Arbitration to make good the EOT Defence. The Tribunal thus went on to consider the substance of the EOT Defence and eventually decided to extend the time for mechanical completion by a period of 25 days, such that the respondent was only entitled to receive liquidated damages for 74 days instead of 99 days.', '11\\u2003Subsequently, the respondent applied to the High Court to partially set aside the Award on the basis that (a) by ruling upon and allowing the EOT Defence, the Tribunal had exceeded the scope of the parties\u2019 submission to arbitration; and\/or (b) the Award had been made in breach of natural justice.'"}
{"casename":"2021_SGCA_103","fact":"'4\\u2003The appellant in this case, Roshdi bin Abdullah Altway (\u201cRoshdi\u201d), claimed trial to a capital charge (the \u201cCharge\u201d) of having in his possession for the purpose of trafficking 267 packets and 250 straws containing 2,201.22g of granular\/powdery substance, which was analysed and found to contain not less than 78.77g of diamorphine (the \u201cDrugs\u201d), an offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the MDA. At his trial below, Roshdi admitted to having both possession of the Drugs and knowledge of their nature. He denied, however, that he had the Drugs in his possession for the purpose of trafficking. Roshdi\u2019s defence was that he was just safekeeping the Drugs for a person known as \u201cAru\u201d, to whom he had all along intended to return the Drugs. We refer to this defence as the \u201csafekeeping defence\u201d. Based on Roshdi\u2019s identification, police investigations ascertained \u201cAru\u201d to be one Chandran Prasanna Anu (\u201cChandran\u201d).', '5\\u2003The High Court judge (the \u201cJudge\u201d) who tried the matter rejected Roshdi\u2019s safekeeping defence, finding that (a) the Prosecution had proved the element of possession for the purpose of trafficking beyond a reasonable doubt; and (b) alternatively, that Roshdi had failed to rebut the presumption of trafficking in s 17(c) of the MDA. The Judge thus convicted Roshdi of the Charge. As Roshdi was not a courier and he had not been issued a certificate of substantive assistance, the Judge imposed the mandatory death penalty on Roshdi under s 33(1) read with the Second Schedule to the MDA: see Public Prosecutor v Roshdi bin Abdullah Altway [2020] SGHC 232 (the \u201cGD\u201d).', '6\\u2003CCA 29 is Roshdi\u2019s appeal against his conviction and sentence. On appeal, the crux of Roshdi\u2019s case is that the Judge erred in finding that he had the Drugs in his possession for the purpose of trafficking. Amongst other things, the Judge is said to have incorrectly admitted and relied upon eight statements that were given by Roshdi to the police. Roshdi also contends that his safekeeping defence ought not to have been disbelieved, and that if it had been believed, the element of possession for the purpose of trafficking would not be made out. Furthermore, Roshdi claims that there was late disclosure by the Prosecution of Chandran\u2019s police statements, which amounted to a breach of its additional disclosure obligations. In Roshdi\u2019s view, Chandran was clearly a \u201cmaterial witness\u201d and by reason of the Prosecution\u2019s omission to call him to testify at trial, it in fact \u201cfailed to discharge its burden of proof to rebut Roshdi\u2019s safekeeping defence\u201d. Since this last-mentioned ground of appeal was not set out in Roshdi\u2019s original Petition of Appeal, Roshdi filed CA\/CM 18\/2021 (\u201cCM 18\u201d) seeking leave to advance this argument.', '7\\u2003Roshdi is a 62-year-old Singaporean male. On 14 September 2016, at about 6.15am, officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (\u201cCNB\u201d) arrested Roshdi at the void deck of Block 209B Compassvale Lane. He was carrying a Nokia phone, a set of keys to a unit at Compassvale Lane (the \u201cCompassvale Unit\u201d), cash in the amount of $4,000 and a blue plastic bag containing $14,000 in cash. After his arrest, Roshdi was taken to the Compassvale Unit where he identified the bedroom he occupied. Various exhibits were found under the bed and inside a cupboard in the bedroom, as follows:', '(a)\\u2003128 packets of granular\/powdery substance marked H1A;', '(b)\\u200313 straws of granular\/powdery substance marked H2A;', '(c)\\u20032 packets of granular\/powdery substance marked H5A;', '(d)\\u200384 straws of granular\/powdery substance marked H5C;', '(e)\\u2003137 packets of granular\/powdery substance marked J1A; and', '(f)\\u2003153 straws of granular\/powdery substance marked J2A.', 'These exhibits comprise the Drugs which form the subject-matter of the Charge. The total weight of the granular\/powdery substance found was 2,201.22g and upon analysis, it was found to contain not less than 78.77g of diamorphine (more commonly known as \u201cheroin\u201d).', '8\\u2003In addition, drug paraphernalia such as spoons, pieces of paper, empty packets, empty straws and digital weighing scales were recovered from Roshdi\u2019s bedroom. Some smaller quantities of cannabis and cannabis mixture were also seized, and these formed the subject-matter of two other charges against Roshdi of possession of a controlled drug for the purpose of trafficking. These charges were withdrawn pursuant to s 147(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (\u201cCPC\u201d) upon Roshdi\u2019s conviction on the Charge. They are not material for the purposes of this appeal.', '9\\u2003In the course of police investigations, nine statements were recorded from Roshdi between 14 September 2016 and 27 September 2016 (collectively, the \u201cStatements\u201d):', '(a)\\u2003Staff Sergeant Muhammad Fardlie bin Ramlie (\u201cSSgt Fardlie\u201d) recorded the first three contemporaneous statements pursuant to s 22 of the CPC (collectively, the \u201cContemporaneous Statements\u201d). These are respectively referred to as the \u201c1st\u201d, \u201c2nd\u201d and \u201c3rd contemporaneous statements\u201d. In these Contemporaneous Statements, Roshdi identified the Drugs as heroin and admitted that they were for sale. He also set out the prices at which the Drugs would be sold and the quantities thereof. When asked who the Drugs belonged to, Roshdi replied, \u201cAll belong to me\u201d. He later added that he worked for a person named \u201cAru\u201d and stated that \u201cI only pack and keep the thing. If someone wants I will send.\u201d', '(b)\\u2003A cautioned statement was recorded by Assistant Superintendent Prashant Sukumaran (\u201cASP Sukumaran\u201d) on 15 September 2016 at about 3.26am pursuant to s 23 of the CPC (the \u201cCautioned Statement\u201d). In the Cautioned Statement, Roshdi claimed that he was \u201cjust a worker\u201d and that \u201c[t]he one who owns the things is another person\u201d.', '(c)\\u2003Between 21 September 2016 and 27 September 2016, Staff Sergeant Ibrahim bin Juasa (\u201cSSgt Ibrahim\u201d) recorded five long statements from Roshdi pursuant to s 22 of the CPC (collectively, the \u201cLong Statements\u201d). These statements are respectively referred to as the \u201c1st\u201d, \u201c2nd\u201d. \u201c3rd\u201d, \u201c4th\u201d and \u201c5th long statement\u201d. In the Long Statements, Roshdi admitted to receiving, storing, repacking and distributing drugs to customers on multiple occasions from as early as July 2016. Roshdi said that he had been working for \u201cAru\u201d and that he would sometimes also collect money from \u201cAru\u2019s\u201d customers for the drugs. These drugs included heroin (diamorphine), as well as \u201cjamak\u201d or \u201cganja\u201d (cannabis) and \u201cice\u201d (methamphetamine). Roshdi further said that the Drugs were for sale and explained how he would weigh and pack them for distribution.', '10\\u2003The trial took place over several tranches between September 2019 and July 2020. As Roshdi disputed the admissibility of his Contemporaneous Statements and Long Statements (collectively, the \u201cContested Statements\u201d), an ancillary hearing was held on 25 June 2020 and 30 June 2020. At the conclusion of the ancillary hearing, the Judge held that the Contested Statements were admissible in evidence.', '11\\u2003The Prosecution adduced the evidence of the relevant CNB officers and others involved in the investigations. At the close of the Prosecution\u2019s case, the Judge found that there was a case to answer. On 2 July 2020, the Defence proceeded to open its case with Roshdi testifying in his own defence. Roshdi did not call any other witnesses.', '12\\u2003Notably, neither side called Chandran as a witness at trial, although four statements had been recorded from him between 19 January 2019 and 24 January 2019 (\u201cChandran\u2019s statements\u201d). The Prosecution disclosed Chandran\u2019s statements to the Defence on 23 June 2020, before the Defence opened its case and Roshdi took the stand. The timing of this disclosure is relevant as one of Roshdi\u2019s arguments on appeal is that Chandran was a \u201cmaterial witness\u201d and the disclosure of his statements was late and in breach of the Prosecution\u2019s additional disclosure obligations.'"}

He did not use any condom or other form of protection.', '9\\u2003Thereafter, he threatened the Victim not to tell anyone about the incident. The Victim crawled from the jetty to a grass patch near the toilet, and sent voice messages to various persons, asking for help and informing them that she had been raped. The appellant returned on a bicycle and threatened her again not to tell anyone before leaving again. The Victim\u2019s aunt, Mr H and her friends went to the Park to look for the Victim and eventually located her. The Victim\u2019s grandmother also arrived at the Park subsequently.', '10\\u2003Mr H asked his mother, Ms Y, to go to the Park, as the Victim had named the appellant as her rapist. When Ms Y asked the appellant if he had seen the Victim, the appellant denied having done so. The appellant and Ms Y then proceeded to the Park. The appellant was dressed in different clothes from the ones he had worn during the commission of the offences. The Victim again pointed out the appellant. The appellant denied raping the Victim and also threatened the Victim\u2019s grandmother, stating that he would find the Victim\u2019s family if anything happened to him. He fled the scene when he saw police officers approaching.', '11\\u2003The appellant was subsequently found hiding in a wooden cupboard in the bedroom of Ms Y\u2019s home and placed under arrest. He gave a false statement that he was looking for Ms Y at the Park and had never met the Victim that night. A year later, the appellant gave a different version of events, claiming that the Victim had come onto him and requested for sex.', '12\\u2003The SOF attached a report from KK Women and Children\u2019s Hospital dated 15 November 2017 by Dr Michelle Lim (\u201cDr Lim\u2019s Report\u201d), as well as Child Guidance Reports pertaining to the Victim. The SOF also attached a psychiatric assessment report by Dr Tan Ming Yee Giles (\u201cDr Tan\u201d) of the Institute of Mental Health (\u201cIMH Report\u201d) pertaining to the appellant. The SOF further summarised the probative DNA results from various case exhibits and body swabs sent to the Health Sciences Authority (\u201cHSA\u201d) for forensic analysis.'"}
{"casename":"2021_SGCA_107","fact":"'8\\u2003To properly understand the Appellant\u2019s complaints against the Defence Team, it is necessary to return to the background facts leading up to the Appellant\u2019s conviction for murder. These facts were covered comprehensively in Iskandar HC at [3]\u2013[18], and we only set out those that are necessary for an understanding of the allegations in the Complaint.', '9\\u2003The Appellant was employed by the Singapore Police Force from March 1999 and rose to the rank of senior staff sergeant. In July 2013, the Appellant was in financial difficulties being indebted to the Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation (\u201cOCBC bank\u201d) in the sum of $61,599.66. OCBC bank had taken out bankruptcy proceedings against him and served the application on the Appellant at his workplace. The Appellant offered an out-of-court settlement of full payment of $50,000, which the bank accepted; at the time, however, the Appellant had less than $400. These financial troubles had also spilled over to his work: he had been charged for being \u201cfinancially embarrassed\u201d, which carried the potential consequence of dismissal.', '10\\u2003This state of affairs led the Appellant to devise a plan to rob the first victim, Mr Tan Boon Sin (\u201cD1\u201d). D1 was a businessman who had lodged police reports about missing cash and gold coins from his safe deposit box. The Appellant was initially the duty investigation officer for the case, and he learnt that there was still a substantial amount of cash in the box. The Appellant came up with an elaborate plan to steal from D1 so as to be able to pay off his debts.', '11\\u2003On 10 July 2013, the Appellant met D1 near the location of the safe deposit box. D1 entered the premises and opened the box. He put a dummy camera supplied by the Appellant into the safe deposit box thinking it would help identify the thief. D1 removed the remaining cash from the box and placed it in an orange bag that the Appellant had brought with him. On the pretext of escorting D1 safely home, the Appellant accompanied D1 home in D1\u2019s car.', '12\\u2003According to the Appellant, when D1\u2019s car arrived outside the house, the Appellant observed that he had opened the outer gates using a remote control at the driver\u2019s seat. The car entered and parked at the porch. D1 then carried the orange bag into the house and placed it near the staircase leading up to the second level. When D1 attempted to close the gates, the Appellant requested that the gates be kept open as his \u201cpartner\u201d (a fictitious character) would be arriving.', '13\\u2003A large portion of the remainder of what happened in D1\u2019s house was a matter of contention between the parties, both at trial and on appeal. What was not disputed, however, was that in the span of roughly 30 minutes, the Appellant inflicted a total of 23 stab and incised knife wounds on D1 in vulnerable areas such as the head, neck and chest. He also attacked Mr Tan Chee Hong (\u201cD2\u201d), the son of D1, who returned home as the Appellant was lowering D1\u2019s body to the floor. On D2, the Appellant inflicted a total of 17 stab and incised wounds to his neck, face and scalp. Subsequently, D2 was dragged under D1\u2019s car as the Appellant drove it out of the gates in order to make his getaway.', '14\\u2003The Appellant did not deny these acts of killing D1 and D2. What he denied was having the intention to do so. In particular, he relied on two exceptions under s 300 of the Penal Code, namely, the right of private defence and sudden fight: Iskandar HC at [44]. In essence, he maintained that his plan had been to rob, not to kill, and he had inflicted those injuries upon D1 and D2 only because they had attempted to assault him. If the Appellant had succeeded in either of those defences, the charges of murder would have been rebutted and he would, instead, have been convicted of culpable homicide under s 299 of the Penal Code, an offence which does not carry the death penalty.', '15\\u2003In relation to D1, the Appellant\u2019s version of events was that, after pretending to communicate on his fake \u201cwalkie-talkie\u201d, he had informed D1 that someone had opened the safe deposit box and that they had to return to CISCO with the orange bag. D1 then walked to the kitchen and used the corded telephone there. After doing so, D1 emerged from the kitchen, telling the Appellant that the camera in the box did not contain batteries and accusing the Appellant of cheating him. D1 then assaulted the Appellant with a knife.', '16\\u2003This explanation was rejected by both the trial court and this court. In particular, it was held that there was no reasonable explanation as to how D1 could have discovered the Appellant\u2019s ruse or that the dummy camera was a fake. In fact, the \u201conly reasonable inference\u201d from the events summarised above at [11] was that D1 had trusted the Appellant: Iskandar CA at [35] and [37]. Similarly, there was no explanation as to why D1 would turn violent and attack the Appellant with a knife. In this court\u2019s view, it was \u201csimply unbelievable\u201d that D1 would have become so enraged as to attack the Appellant; D1 was also a 67-year-old man with a chronic knee problem, and it would have been a simple matter to have waited for his son or called the police. This court also referred to the evidence of D1\u2019s wife, Mdm Ong Ah Tang, who testified that D1 was not a violent person: Iskandar CA at [43]. With no alternative case put forward by the Appellant, and since he had admitted that he intended to and did cause the injuries to D1, it was held that the Appellant had had the requisite intention to cause death: Iskandar CA at [45]. He had also failed to establish a case in relation to the defences of sudden fight and private defence under s 300 of the Penal Code.', '17\\u2003In relation to D2, the Appellant averred that as he was lowering D1\u2019s body on to the floor, D2 appeared in the doorway of the house. D2 then shouted \u201cPa!\u201d and charged at the Appellant with clenched fists, swinging his right fist, which the Appellant blocked. The Appellant intended to retaliate by punching D2 with his right hand but, failing to realise that the knife was still in his hand, ended up stabbing D2. As D2 continued to punch and pull at the Appellant, the latter ended up stabbing D2 further due to his wild swings. The Appellant\u2019s overall claim was that all he wanted to do was to get D2 away from him so that he could escape.', '18\\u2003This claim that the Appellant did not realise the knife was in his hand was found to be an \u201cincredible\u201d one by the trial court. Even if that were so, he should have realised after the first stabbing that he was holding the knife, but he proceeded to stab D2 in the neck several more times. Moreover, the congregation of the stab wounds on the vulnerable parts of D2\u2019s body showed that they were targeted attacks, and with the sheer number, that they were intended to cause death. It was similarly held that the viciousness of the attacks prevented any finding in relation to the defences of private defence and sudden fight: Iskandar HC at [87]. The Appellant was therefore found guilty on both counts of murder. As stated, his appeal against conviction was dismissed. It should be noted that for the appeal the Appellant was represented by new counsel who had not formed part of the Defence Team.'"}

We refer to them as the \u201cFit and Proper Category\u201d and \u201cOther Misconduct Category\u201d respectively.', '5\\u2003On 14 March 2018, the respondent notified the appellant in writing that his employment would terminate immediately (\u201cthe Termination Notice\u201d). The Termination Notice stated that this was due to the appellant\u2019s \u201crecent, multiple breaches of client confidentiality since the written warning issued to you in October 2017\u201d. It was accepted by the parties that this was a reference to a letter issued in November 2017. It went on to state that \u201cAs a salesperson, client confidentiality is a core requirement of your job and we consider this to be a fundamental breach of your employment terms with Nomura\u201d. Paragraph 8 of the Termination Notice has particular significance in this appeal. It stated as follows:', '6\\u2003On 19 March 2018, the respondent filed a misconduct report with the MAS (\u201cthe MAS report\u201d). This report was not filed under the Fit and Proper Category but under the Other Misconduct Category. In the MAS report, the respondent provided details of the appellant\u2019s alleged breaches of client confidentiality and stated that the respondent considered the breaches \u201cconstituted serious misconduct particularly given the prior written warning issued to him in October 2017\u201d and therefore decided to \u201csummarily dismiss the employee on 14 March 2018\u201d.', '7\\u2003The MAS report was given to the appellant only on 15 June 2018. During the interim period (ie, from the time of the appellant\u2019s termination on 14 March 2018 until 15 June 2018), the appellant attended interviews with three prospective employers, Credit Suisse SG, ANZ SG and Citigroup Private Bank SG. He informed them that the respondent \u201chad filed\u201d a misconduct report against him under the Fit and Proper Category. He did not receive any offers from them.', '8\\u2003In September 2018, the appellant managed to find alternative employment. However, this came with a pay cut of roughly 70% from what he used to receive at the respondent.', '9\\u2003On 21 May 2019, the appellant commenced Suit 507. On 13 February 2020, the respondent took out an application under O 18 rr 19(1)(a) \u2013 19(1)(d) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Ed) and\/or the inherent jurisdiction of the court to strike out the entirety of the appellant\u2019s claim. This was dismissed by the AR but the respondent\u2019s appeal to the Judge was allowed in large part.', '10\\u2003The appellant\u2019s action against the respondent relied on two main grounds. First, he claimed that he was dismissed wrongfully by the respondent. He denied the alleged breaches of client confidentiality and averred that he was dismissed for \u201ccollateral reasons\u201d (ie, for reporting unlawful trading activity by other employees of the respondent and for falling out with an Executive Director over her alleged improper claim of the appellant\u2019s sales credit as hers) (\u201cWrongful Dismissal Claim\u201d). Second, he claimed that the respondent communicated misinformation negligently to him in the Termination Notice which he felt obliged to disclose to prospective employers and did so to several prospective employers after the termination of his employment. This caused him to lose the opportunity to obtain equivalent employment at a salary which was on par with what he previously received at the respondent. It also resulted in serious injury to his personal and business reputation and hence financial loss (\u201cNegligent Misinformation Claim\u201d).', '11\\u2003The Judge struck out part of the Wrongful Dismissal Claim and the entire Negligent Misinformation Claim. He allowed the Wrongful Dismissal Claim to continue insofar as it concerned the alleged breaches of client confidentiality.', '12\\u2003On appeal before us, the appellant seeks to reinstate the majority of his struck-out claims. He argues that the Judge was wrong to strike out the references to \u201ccollateral reasons\u201d in the Wrongful Dismissal Claim just because the respondent had sought to justify his termination solely on the basis of the appellant\u2019s alleged breaches of client confidentiality. He alleges that the \u201ccollateral reasons\u201d were the true reasons for his summary dismissal and they were therefore linked inextricably to the alleged breaches of client confidentiality. He submits that he has an arguable case in respect of the Negligent Misinformation Claim and that it ought not to have been struck out. Lastly, the appellant contends that his contractual claim for bonus, which was struck out as it was conceded that he was not entitled to a bonus, can be re-housed under the Negligent Misinformation Claim through the amendments sought in SUM 108.'"}

Pravinash rode pillion, and was carrying a black Adidas haversack (\u201cthe Haversack\u201d). After crossing Woodlands Checkpoint into Singapore, they proceeded to Kranji MRT station, and Pravinash, either alone or (according to him) accompanied by Kamalnathan, entered the public toilet there. According to Pravinash, in the public toilet, he and Kamalnathan removed the three blocks of Drugs which they were carrying on their bodies, and put them into the Haversack.', '6\\u2003Both Pravinash and Kamalnathan then went to a nearby coffee shop (\u201cthe Kranji MRT station coffee shop\u201d).

{"casename":"2021_SGCA_111","fact":"'10\\u2003The legal battle surrounding Ms Azlin\u2019s claim has been an acrimonious and lengthy one which began in 2015. This appeal is the fourth time that Ms Azlin\u2019s claim has come before this court, and its factual background has been well-summarised in a slew of judgments, most recently in Noor Azlin bte Abdul Rahman and another v Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd [2021] 2 SLR 440 (\u201cthe Transfer Judgment\u201d). We lay out only the most relevant facts.', '11\\u2003The genesis of the dispute can be traced to 31 October 2007 when Ms Azlin visited the Accident and Emergency Department of CGH (\u201cA&E department\u201d), complaining of lower chest pain and shortness of breath. A chest X-ray was ordered (\u201cthe October 2007 X-ray\u201d) and an opacity in the right mid-zone of her chest was noted. Ms Azlin subsequently visited CGH three more times (see the Judgment at [10]\u2013[13]):', '(a)\\u2003On 15 November 2007, Ms Azlin went to CGH\u2019s Specialist Outpatient Clinic (\u201cSOC\u201d) and two chest X-rays were ordered for her by Dr Imran bin Mohamed Noor (respectively, \u201cthe November 2007 X-rays\u201d and \u201cDr Imran\u201d). Dr Imran assessed that the opacity noted in the October 2007 X-ray was resolving or had resolved on its own and gave Ms Azlin an open date for her follow-up appointment.', '(b)\\u2003On 29 April 2010, Ms Azlin went back to CGH\u2019s A&E department complaining of right lower chest pain. An X-ray and an electrocardiogram (\u201cthe April 2010 X-ray\u201d and \u201cECG\u201d, respectively) were ordered by Dr Yap Hsiang (\u201cDr Yap\u201d). Dr Yap deemed the opacity found in the right mid-zone of her lungs to be an \u201cincidental finding\u201d (ie, a finding that was not related to the patient\u2019s presenting symptoms) as its size had remained more or less the same. Dr Yap ordered that the April 2010 X-ray be reported upon and requested specifically that Ms Azlin be called back after the radiological report was out, if necessary. A radiological report was prepared and sent to the A&E department for follow-up.', '(c)\\u2003On 31 July 2011, Ms Azlin went back to CGH\u2019s A&E department complaining of intermittent left lower ribcage pain. Dr Soh Wei Wen Jason (\u201cDr Soh\u201d) ordered two chest X-rays (\u201cthe July 2011 X-rays\u201d) and an ECG. Dr Soh and his supervising consultant took the view that Ms Azlin had costochondritis, a condition which is of musculoskeletal origin. Ms Azlin was discharged with analgesics. The July 2011 X-rays were sent for reporting and the report recommended a follow-up of the opacity.', '12\\u2003On 28 November 2011, Ms Azlin went to the Raffles Medical Clinic complaining of cough, breathlessness, and blood in the sputum. On 1 December 2011, Ms Azlin returned for an X-ray (\u201cthe December 2011 X-ray\u201d) which showed a lesion in the right mid-zone of the lung. Ms Azlin was referred to a respiratory physician at CGH\u2019s SOC and was seen by Adjunct Assistant Professor Sridhar Venkateswaran (\u201cProf Sridhar\u201d) on 15 December 2011. Among other things, Prof Sridhar ordered a Computed Tomography (\u201cCT\u201d) scan of Ms Azlin\u2019s chest, which revealed a nodule (see the Judgment at [16]\u2013[17]).', '13\\u2003The biopsy of the nodule was conducted on 16 February 2012 by Dr Andrew Tan (\u201cDr Tan\u201d). This confirmed that the nodule was malignant and that Ms Azlin had cancer originating from it. The stage of the lung cancer was not yet known at that point in time (see the Judgment at [18]).', '14\\u2003On 1 March 2012, Prof Sridhar explained to Ms Azlin that there was a good chance that she could have a complete cure with a lobectomy. Ms Azlin was clinically staged as having stage I lung cancer. On 29 March 2012, she underwent a lobectomy and one-third of her right lung was resected. The tumour measured 3.0cm and was pathologically diagnosed as stage IIA non-small cell lung cancer. Ms Azlin underwent four rounds of adjuvant chemotherapy for about three months and CT scans every four months (see the Judgment at [19]).', '15\\u2003In August 2014, a recurrence of Ms Azlin\u2019s lung cancer occurred. This was discovered on a CT scan dated 26 August 2014. A biopsy confirmed that the lung cancer had progressed to stage IV. In December 2014, an analysis of the tumour that was resected via lobectomy in March 2012 was done to determine its mutation type. The resected tumour from 2012 was retrospectively found to be positive for a rare ALK-gene arrangement and Ms Azlin was retrospectively diagnosed in 2014 to have been suffering from ALK-positive lung cancer in 2012 (see the Judgment at [20]).', '16\\u2003From 22 January 2015 to 8 July 2015, Ms Azlin was treated with a first-generation ALK-inhibitor, Crizotinib. In July 2015, she was placed on second-generation ALK-inhibitors, Ceritinib and Nivolumab, as part of a clinical trial. She remained on those drugs until October 2016, when the cancer progressed to her brain and mediastinal lymph node. She was then taken off the clinical trial and managed with radio surgery, chemotherapy and Ceritinib. From March 2017, Ms Azlin was treated with a third generation ALK-inhibitor, Lorlatinib (see the Judgment at [21]).', '17\\u2003Ms Azlin commenced legal proceedings against CGH on 20 January 2015 in HC\/S 59\/2015 (\u201cSuit 59\u201d).

This was for two reasons:', '(b)\\u2003Second, CGH had breached its duty of care to Ms Azlin by failing to ensure that there was proper follow-up in her case when even the radiological reports from April 2010 and July 2011 recommended follow-up on the opacity in the right mid-zone of her chest. There were also serious inadequacies in CGH\u2019s patient management system (see the first CA Judgment at [96]\u2013[101]).', '(c)\\u2003Third, CGH\u2019s negligence caused a delay in diagnosing Ms Azlin with lung cancer which, more likely than not, caused her to suffer from nodal metastasis and any consequences that may have followed (see the first CA Judgment at [116] and [122]).', '(d)\\u2003Fourth, given the abovementioned findings on CGH\u2019s liability, it was necessary for the losses occasioned by CGH\u2019s breach to be determined and assessed. As the Original Hearing was not bifurcated, the evidence led at trial, and the submissions on appeal, were not tailored or directed to the specific facts as found by this court. As such, we ordered that the \u201cissue of loss and damage, including quantification (if any), be remitted to the Judge with leave for the parties to refine or revise their evidence so as to address the specific factual findings that have been made in [the first CA Judgment]\u201d (see the first CA Judgment at [125]).', '19\\u2003After Ms Azlin passed away on 1 April 2019, the appellants made an application in SUM 1204 for interim payment. The application was heard by an Assistant Registrar (\u201cAR\u201d) who ordered a sum of $200,000 to be paid out. This decision was upheld on appeal on 3 February 2020. Leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal was not granted by either the High Court or the Court of Appeal (see the Judgment at [5]).', '20\\u2003The AD Hearing took place over six days in August and September 2020.

{"casename":"2021_SGCA_116","fact":"'12\\u2003The first respondent, Tendcare, is a Singapore-incorporated investment holding company, which owned and operated hospitals and other medical-related business through direct and indirect subsidiaries incorporated in Hong Kong and the People\u2019s Republic of China (\u201cPRC\u201d). We follow the Judge in referring to Tendcare and its subsidiaries as the \u201cTian Jian Group\u201d. Tendcare was placed under judicial management on 11 September 2017, with the second respondent, Mr Yit Chee Wah (\u201cMr Yit\u201d), appointed as judicial manager.', '13\\u2003As the claims by Tendcare and Mr Yit centre on allegations against the first defendant, Mr Gong, and the seventh defendant (and appellant), Mr Miao, we set out the parties as they are related to each of these two individuals.', '14\\u2003On the one hand were the parties related to Mr Gong. Tendcare had been incorporated by Mr Gong who, at the material time, held the majority of shares in Tendcare beneficially through a wholly-owned holding company, Gongs Global Investment Development Holdings Limited (\u201cGongs Global\u201d). Mr Gong is also the sole director and shareholder of the second defendant, Hua Xia Tian Jian Pte Ltd (\u201cHXTJ\u201d), a Singapore-incorporated company. The 11th and 12th defendants are Mr Gong\u2019s wife (\u201cMs Wang\u201d) and daughter (\u201cMs Gong\u201d) respectively. Another company, which was not a party to the suit, but was closely related to Tendcare, is its wholly-owned subsidiary, Tian Jian Hua Xia Medical Group (HK) Limited (\u201cTJHK\u201d). TJHK has since been wound up.', '15\\u2003On the other hand were the parties related to Mr Miao, a Singapore citizen. He is the sole director and shareholder of (a) the eighth defendant, Hui Xiang Group Pte Ltd (\u201cHXG\u201d), a Singapore-incorporated company; and (b) the tenth defendant, Qian Hui Capital Limited (\u201cQHC\u201d), a Hong Kong-incorporated company. QHC was wound up in Hong Kong in October 2020 upon the application of TJHK\u2019s liquidators. Mr Miao is also the sole director of the ninth defendant, Hui Xiang Group (HK) Limited (\u201cHXG HK\u201d), a Hong Kong-incorporated company which (until 31 March 2015) was wholly owned by HXG. Since that date, its owner has been Imperium Mining Company (incorporated in the Cayman Islands and of which Mr Miao is the sole director).', '16\\u2003At the outset, we note that Mr Miao purports to appeal against the Judge\u2019s findings as they also relate to QHC. We do not think it is correct for him to do so. As noted above, QHC has already been wound up. Mr Miao\u2019s solicitors (who had previously been acting for QHC in the High Court) recognised, in a letter to court dated 7 May 2021, that by virtue of QHC\u2019s winding up, they no longer had authority to act for QHC. There has been no further development to suggest otherwise, and indeed, the appeal is filed only in Mr Miao\u2019s name. Unless some proof can be shown that the liquidators of QHC wish to take steps in the appeal, Mr Miao is entitled only to submit in respect of his own liability, not QHC\u2019s, and neither he nor his counsel can purport to represent QHC given the winding up order. As such, we will only consider Mr Miao\u2019s liability in this appeal.', '17\\u2003The dispute at trial centred on the events surrounding Tendcare\u2019s intended initial public offering (\u201cthe Tendcare IPO\u201d) which ultimately did not take place. On appeal, the central issue concerns Mr Miao\u2019s alleged dishonest assistance of Mr Gong\u2019s transfer of funds out of the Tian Jian Group, which took place in the context of these broader events. It follows that the arguments raised by Mr Miao are relatively circumscribed and touch on only a few key factual points. Further, as there is no cross-appeal by Tendcare and Mr Yit against the Judge\u2019s finding that Mr Miao was not liable for fraudulent trading, many of the other facts discussed by the Judge are no longer relevant to the appeal. For the purposes of our judgment, we set out the facts and findings only as they are relevant to the case against Mr Miao, whether directly or as a necessary part of the context.', '18\\u2003In September 2013, HXG \u2013 of which Mr Miao is the sole director and shareholder \u2013 became involved in the Tendcare IPO by way of a memorandum of understanding with Beijing Tianjian Huaxia Medical Investment Management Co Ltd (\u201cBJTJ\u201d). Mr Ryan Gwee Yuan Kerr (\u201cMr Gwee\u201d), the Chief Executive Officer (\u201cCEO\u201d) of HXG from 2011 to December 2014, signed on behalf of HXG. Mr Gong signed on behalf of BJTJ as BJTJ\u2019s legal representative and chairman. HXG was to engage two advisers to assist in the pre-IPO restructuring, fundraising and preparations, in return for a retainer, a success fee, and a shareholding in Tendcare to be transferred to Mr Miao, Mr Gwee, and a legal adviser, Mr Sim Mong Teck (\u201cMr Sim\u201d). These terms were elaborated upon in a Letter of Engagement between HXG and BJTJ. Following this, work began on the Tendcare IPO.', '19\\u2003Subsequently, a share purchase agreement (\u201cSPA\u201d) was entered into between companies that were owned by Mr Gwee and Mr Sim (Luxe Heritage Capital Management Limited and NYC Investments Limited, respectively) and Tendcare (\u201cthe NYC\/Luxe SPA\u201d). Further, Mr Gong, Mr Gwee and Mr Sim entered into a Memorandum of Understanding in 2014 (\u201cthe 2014 MOU\u201d) in respect of the NYC\/Luxe SPA. It suffices to note here that the NYC\/Luxe SPA and the 2014 MOU formed a central part of the respondents\u2019 case on fraudulent trading. A dispute subsequently arose between Mr Miao, Mr Gwee and Mr Sim arising out of the NYC\/Luxe SPA and other agreements.', '20\\u2003On 26 January 2015, in order to resolve that dispute, Mr Gong, Mr Miao, Mr Gwee and Mr Sim signed an agreement providing for the termination of the 2014 MOU and all related agreements, including the NYC\/Luxe SPA. Subsequently, Mr Gong (on behalf of Tendcare) and Mr Miao (on behalf of HXG) entered into three agreements on 1 February 2015 (\u201cthe Post-Termination Agreements\u201d): (a) a Success Fee Agreement for 5.5% of the pre-IPO funding raised; and (b) an IPO Shares Agreement and Retainer Agreement under which HXG agreed to provide assistance concerning the reorganisation of Tendcare\u2019s medical business.', '21\\u2003As a result of the preparations for its IPO, Tendcare became the ultimate holding company of the Tian Jian Group. Until 29 June 2017 (when various steps were apparently taken to divest the Tian Jian Group of its various operating units (see the Judgment at [14])), the corporate structure was as follows:', '(a)\\u2003Tendcare held 100% of the shares in TJHK;', '(b)\\u2003TJHK held 100% of the shares of Shanxi Tian Jian Hua Xia Business Trading Co Ltd (\u201cShanxi TJHX WFOE\u201d);', '(c)\\u2003Shanxi TJHX WFOE held 100% of the shares of BJTJ; and', '(d)\\u2003BJTJ held the equity in all operating units of the Tian Jian Group in the PRC.', '22\\u2003In the course of the preparation for the Tendcare IPO, pre-IPO funds were raised from various investors and creditors. We summarise the results of these fund-raising efforts in the following table:', '23\\u2003A key factual plank of the respondents\u2019 case against the defendants below centred on the movement of the pre-IPO funds into and then out of the Tian Jian Group. As the Judge observed, the transfers out of the Tian Jian Group can be grouped into three categories: (a) transfers from Tendcare to HXTJ (\u201cthe HXTJ Transfers\u201d); (b) transfers from Tendcare to QHC through TJHK (\u201cthe Tendcare-TJHK-QHC Transfers\u201d); and (c) transfers from Tendcare to HXG HK (\u201cthe HXG HK Transfers\u201d). These were referred to by the Judge as the \u201cDisputed Transfers\u201d, and they totalled US$45.29m and S$500,000. It is the Tendcare-TJHK-QHC Transfers which form the basis of the claim against Mr Miao.', '24\\u2003The details of the Tendcare-TJHK-QHC Transfers are as follows:', '(a)\\u2003On 11 March 2015, US$2m was transferred from Tendcare\u2019s bank account to TJHK\u2019s bank account bearing an account number ending in 2247 (\u201cTJHK 2247\u201d). On 15 April 2015, US$2m was transferred from another of TJHK\u2019s bank accounts, this one bearing an account number ending in 2220 (\u201cTJHK 2220\u201d), to QHC\u2019s bank account. We refer to this sequence of events broadly as the \u201cUS$2m Transfer\u201d.', '(b)\\u2003On 22 September 2015, US$4m was transferred from Tendcare\u2019s bank account to TJHK 2220. On 23 September 2015, US$4m was transferred from TJHK 2220 to QHC\u2019s bank account. We refer to this sequence of events broadly as the \u201cUS$4m Transfer\u201d.', '25\\u2003In so far as the latter sum of US$4m was concerned, on 24 September 2015, HK$21,395,293.50 (the equivalent of US$2,765,000) was transferred from QHC to Mr Miao\u2019s personal bank account, and then paid from Mr Miao\u2019s account to one Asia Hausse Capital Limited (\u201cAsia Hausse\u201d) by cheque. On the same day, US$1m was transferred from QHC to Hongjia International Holdings Co Ltd (\u201cHongjia\u201d). Asia Hausse is a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands and controlled by Mr Hanford Cheung Ho Fat (\u201cMr Cheung\u201d), of MCL Capital Limited (\u201cMCL\u201d), one of the two advisers who had been engaged to assist in the preparations for the Tendcare IPO. Further, Mr Cheung had become CEO of QHC in around December 2014.', '26\\u2003It is now not disputed that the sums transferred to Asia Hausse and Hongjia eventually made their way to Mr Gong\u2019s bank accounts (see also the Judgment at [145]). A diagram of the relevant transfers relating to Mr Miao can be found in Annex 1 to this judgment.'"}

They were married in Pakistan on 3 August 1995 under Islamic marriage laws and moved soon after to Singapore in mid-August 1995. They have four sons (collectively, the \u201cChildren\u201d), all of whom are Singapore citizens. Both parties have been living in Singapore since 1995, except for a period when the Wife lived in Pakistan from 1999\u20132002 and another period in the lead-up to their divorce (see the Gen Div Judgment at [2]).', '6\\u2003The Husband is the director and shareholder of Company [A], out of which he operates as a property agent. He also works as a marketing manager with Company [B]. He had worked previously in an electronics company and an apparel business. The Wife was a housewife during her marriage to the Husband (see the Gen Div Judgment at [4]). She has been a Singapore citizen since 25 September 2007.', '7\\u2003The Husband purchased various properties during the marriage. As at the date of the divorce, there were four properties in Singapore (see the Gen Div Judgment at [3]) and three properties in Pakistan which formed part of the pool of matrimonial assets. As referred to in the Gen Div Judgment at [83], the three properties are \u201cR-022\u201d, \u201cA01\u201d and \u201cR228\u201d (collectively, the \u201cThree Properties\u201d).', '8\\u2003The parties were divorced on 4 May 2016 by the court in Karachi, Pakistan (see the AD Judgment at [1]). However, cracks in the marriage had been apparent since the early 2000s. In 2002, the Wife commenced a suit for the dissolution of marriage by way of khulla (also spelled kula or khulu) in the court in Karachi. The parties reconciled and entered into a \u201cCompromise Decree\u201d on 24 March 2003. In 2005, the Husband pronounced one talaq against the Wife via a \u201cDeed of First Divorce\u201d. However, the parties reconciled and entered into a \u201cCompromise Deed\u201d in respect of the Deed of First Divorce. In January 2016, the Wife again commenced a suit for the dissolution of the marriage by khulla in Karachi. This time, there was no reconciliation and the parties were divorced with effect from 4 May 2016. The court order made no reference to the Children, nor did it provide for the division of matrimonial assets. The Husband alleged that the Wife had agreed to a settlement agreement dated 13 July 2015 which dealt with the assets, and that the Husband had complied with the said agreement (see the Gen Div Judgment at [5]).', '9\\u2003On 18 April 2019, the Wife applied to the Singapore Syariah court for nafkah iddah and mutaah (see the AD Judgment at [35]). She was unsuccessful both at first instance and before the Syariah Court of Appeal.', '10\\u2003The two-page Settlement Agreement was the focal point of the parties\u2019 dispute before both the Gen Div and the AD (see the AD Judgment at [9] and the Gen Div Judgment at [5]\u2013[6]). The Husband claimed that the Wife should not be granted any financial relief under Ch 4A because she had agreed to the terms contained within the Settlement Agreement. The Wife disagreed. While she admitted to signing on its second page which starts with the word \u201cDetails\u201d [emphasis in original], she denied signing its first page which starts with the word \u201cAGREEMENT\u201d [emphasis in original]. She alleged that the signature above her name on the first page was not hers (see the AD Judgment at [9]\u2013[10] and the Gen Div Judgment at [25]\u2013[26]).', '11\\u2003OS 21 is the latest episode in a series of protracted legal proceedings commenced originally by the Wife to seek financial relief from the Singapore court (pursuant to Ch 4A) following foreign matrimonial proceedings, namely, the parties\u2019 divorce in Karachi, Pakistan. The majority of these prior applications (and appeals) are irrelevant to OS 21 and we therefore summarise only the key episodes in this ongoing saga. A fuller picture of the procedural history can be found in the Gen Div Judgment at [8]\u2013[14].', '12\\u2003For context, an applicant for financial relief under Ch 4A must show under s 121B of the Women\u2019s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (\u201cWomen\u2019s Charter\u201d) that:', '(a)\\u2003the marriage has been dissolved or annulled, or the parties to the marriage have been legally separated by means of judicial, or other proceedings in a foreign country (see s 121B(a) of the Women\u2019s Charter); and', '(b)\\u2003the divorce, annulment or judicial separation is entitled to be recognised as valid in Singapore under Singapore law (see s 121B(b) of the Women\u2019s Charter).', '13\\u2003The various applications in this case broadly follow the two-stage process for the grant of financial relief as stipulated under Ch 4A.', '(a)\\u2003First, leave of court must be obtained before any application for foreign relief can be made (see s 121D(1) of the Women\u2019s Charter).

The Gen Div Judge also varied the DJ\u2019s interim maintenance order, such that the Husband would pay interim maintenance of $1,500 per month for the Children, and not the Wife. This was on the basis that the Wife was not entitled to maintenance beyond the nafkah iddah and mutaah after an Islamic divorce was finalised (see the Gen Div Judgment at [11]).', '17\\u2003The parties appeared before the Gen Div Judge again in 2019 and 2020 and, after seven days of hearing, the Gen Div Judgment was published on 28 January 2021.

The Gen Div Judge also granted maintenance of $2,750 per month for the Children (see the Gen Div Judgment at [254]\u2013[255]). This was to last until their eldest child graduates or ceases to study.

{"casename":"2021_SGCA_118","fact":"'4\\u2003These were the facts in the Statement of Facts which the Applicant accepted without qualification when his plea of guilt was taken. On 24 March 2016, at about 12.10pm, the Applicant rode a motorcycle bearing license plate number JQR 5667 (\u201cthe Bike\u201d) into the HDB carpark located at Lengkong Tiga. Separately, about ten minutes later, a co-accused person name Ansari, accompanied by his girlfriend Bella, entered the same HDB car park in a car driven by one Jufri (\u201cthe Car\u201d). Ansari and Bella met the Applicant at the void deck of Block 106 of Lengkong Tiga, where they received two packets from the Applicant in exchange for $5,880. At about 12.25pm, the Central Narcotics Bureau (\u201cCNB\u201d) officers arrested all four individuals, namely, the Applicant, Ansari, Bella and Jufri.', '5\\u2003When the CNB officers conducted their searches, they found two things: first, a dark blue sling bag in the front basket of the Bike, containing $5,880; and second, a white plastic bag containing two plastic packets of brown granular substance on the floorboard under the front passenger seat of the Car. Analysis later revealed that the two packets contained, respectively, 457.7g of granular powdery substance containing not less than 20.51g of diamorphine; and 457.5g of granular powdery substance containing not less than 19.17g of diamorphine.', '6\\u2003The Applicant later admitted to collecting illicit drugs from an Indian man at Jurong Bird Park on the instructions of one \u201cIsmail\u201d. He also admitted to having taken instructions to pass the collected drugs to a Malay man \u2013 who turned out to be Ansari \u2013 at Block 106 Lengkong Tiga. The Applicant was promised RM500 for delivering \u201ca packet or two\u201d.', '7\\u2003For present purposes, there are three key facts in relation to the earlier proceedings:', '(a)\\u2003At no point in any of the earlier proceedings did the Applicant indicate any dissatisfaction with his former counsel (Mr Chia Soo, Michael (\u201cMr Chia\u201d) and Mr Sankar s\/o Kailasa Thevar Saminathan (\u201cMr Saminathan\u201d), respectively). If anything, he specifically requested for Mr Chia to represent him again at the appeal stage, and thanked Mr Chia for being a \u201cgreat counsel and a great listener\u201d. The Applicant further acknowledged that Mr Chia had been \u201cdiligen[t] in [his] work when [he was] still [the Applicant\u2019s] counsel\u201d.', '(b)\\u2003His plea of guilt was an informed and considered decision. He took time to consider the plea offer before indicating that he would plead guilty on 31 March 2020. From 31 March 2020 to the plead guilty mention on 25 June 2020, the Applicant had a further three months to reconsider his decision to plead guilty. At the plead guilty mention itself, (i) the charge was read and explained to the Applicant in Tamil, (ii) the Applicant confirmed that he understood the nature and consequences of his plea, (iii) the Applicant admitted to the statement of facts without qualification, and (iv) the Judge obtained counsel\u2019s confirmation that the Applicant both intended to plead guilty and that he intended to admit to the statement of facts without qualification. It also bears noting that the Applicant had also mulled over his draft mitigation plea and had, in fact, made changes to it.', '(c)\\u2003He was given an opportunity to clarify on appeal as to whether he was contesting his conviction. This was given the nature of his submissions which included a claim that he had no knowledge the drugs in his possession. He clarified that he was contesting only his sentence and the appeal therefore proceeded on that basis.'"}
{"casename":"2021_SGCA_119","fact":"'4\\u2003Ishibe and Masui are Japanese nationals. They were senior employees of Nissho Iwai Corporation (\u201cNissho Japan\u201d), which merged with another company in April 2004 to form Sojitz Corporation (\u201cSojitz Japan\u201d). In the course of their employment, they were seconded to Singapore to work for Nissho Iwai International (Singapore) Ltd (\u201cNissho Singapore\u201d), which was renamed Sojitz Asia Pte Ltd (\u201cSojitz Singapore\u201d) after the said merger. Nissho Singapore and Sojitz Singapore are the Singaporean subsidiaries of Nissho Japan and Sojitz Japan respectively. In this judgment, we refer to Nissho Singapore and\/or Sojitz Singapore as \u201cthe Singaporean Company\u201d, to Nissho Japan and\/or Sojitz Japan as \u201cthe Japanese Company\u201d, and to Masui\u2019s and Ishibe\u2019s employer as \u201cSojitz\u201d generally.', '5\\u2003The Japanese Company is a trading company dealing in various commodities. One of its businesses is the supply of edible and industrial flour through the Singaporean Company. Chia Lee & Co (\u201cChia Lee\u201d), a sole proprietorship owned by Koh Pee Chiang (\u201cKoh\u201d), was the sole distributor of edible flour for the Singaporean Company between 1978 and 2002. Ishibe and Masui were responsible for setting the selling price of the edible flour, informing Koh of the market price and negotiating with Koh in relation to the edible flour business.', '6\\u2003The Singaporean Company\u2019s industrial flour distributor, on the other hand, was a company known as Sin Heng Chan. When Sin Heng Chan encountered financial difficulties in 2002, Sojitz searched for an alternative industrial flour distributor for the Singaporean Company. In mid-2002, Ishibe approached Koh and asked him to take over the industrial flour distributorship from Sin Heng Chan as a \u201cfavour\u201d. Koh was thoroughly unfamiliar with the industrial flour business, which operated completely differently from his mainstay, the edible flour business. Despite his misgivings, Koh reluctantly agreed as he feared that his refusal to co-operate would spell the end of Chia Lee\u2019s exclusive distributorship of edible flour for the Singaporean Company. Chia Lee was thus appointed to replace Sin Heng Chan as the industrial flour distributor for the Singaporean Company.', '7\\u2003It was undisputed that Koh, Ishibe and Masui entered into an arrangement to share the profits earned by Chia Lee from its industrial flour business (\u201cthe profit-sharing arrangement\u201d). Ishibe and Masui received the lion\u2019s share of the profits under this arrangement. At the material time, the expected profit from the industrial flour business was US$23 per metric ton of industrial flour. It was agreed that Koh would receive US$3 per metric ton of industrial flour sold to cover his \u201cadministration costs\u201d while the remaining US$20 per metric ton of industrial flour sold would be handed over to Masui, to be shared equally with Ishibe. Between February 2004 and November 2007, Koh made 28 distinct payments to Masui, which Masui in turn shared with Ishibe.', '8\\u2003The profit-sharing arrangement was, in fact, a loss-making enterprise for Koh. From the outset, the US$3 that he received per metric ton of industrial flour sold barely covered the costs of running the industrial flour business. As the industrial flour business flourished, Koh\u2019s paltry share of the profits under the profit-sharing arrangement fell far short of what was needed to cover Chia Lee\u2019s ballooning tax liability. When Koh sought to halt the profit-sharing arrangement, Ishibe and Masui threatened \u201cnot [to] continue to support and protect [him] anymore\u201d. Koh understood this to mean that they would undercut Chia Lee\u2019s edible flour business by appointing other distributors or by selling edible flour directly to Chia Lee\u2019s customers. He therefore felt that he had no choice but to continue running the industrial flour business or risk having Chia Lee\u2019s edible flour business adversely affected.', '9\\u2003By June 2005, it was clear that Chia Lee was under considerable financial strain. When Chia Lee\u2019s customer, Chao Shun Trading (\u201cChao Shun\u201d), defaulted on payments totalling US$326,007, Masui transferred US$240,000 via Chia Lee to Koh on 15 June 2005. The nature of this transfer was disputed at the trial. Ishibe and Masui argued that the transfer had been made pursuant to their agreement with Koh that they would personally bear the risks of the industrial flour business. In contrast, the Prosecution claimed that the payment was meant to keep Chia Lee afloat to sustain Ishibe\u2019s and Masui\u2019s corrupt scheme.', '10\\u2003Despite Chia Lee\u2019s increasingly parlous financial situation, Koh continued participating in the profit-sharing arrangement all the way until November 2007, when he ran out of money to pay Masui and Ishibe. The profit-sharing arrangement was discovered by Sojitz Japan in late 2009, when it obtained control of Chia Lee\u2019s accounts.', '11\\u2003Ishibe and Masui each claimed trial to 28 charges under s 6(a) read with s 29(a) of the PCA for conspiring with each other to corruptly obtain gratification from Koh as inducements for doing acts in relation to the Singaporean Company\u2019s affairs, namely, furthering Chia Lee\u2019s business interests with the Singaporean Company. They were alleged to have received a total gratification sum of $2,051,402 from Koh. The first charge against Masui read as follows:', 'The remaining 27 charges against Masui were similarly framed, save for: (a) the name of Masui\u2019s\/Ishibe\u2019s principal, which was either Nissho Singapore or Sojitz Singapore; (b) the date on which the gratification was allegedly received; and (c) the amount of the gratification allegedly received. Ishibe faced the same 28 charges, except that Masui was always named as the recipient of the gratification given by Koh.', '12\\u2003Ishibe and Masui accepted that they did receive payments from Koh pursuant to the profit-sharing arrangement, although they disputed the exact amounts received. The central contention at the trial was the true character of the profit-sharing arrangement. Relying primarily on Koh\u2019s evidence, the Prosecution argued that his payments to Masui and Ishibe were bribes to ensure their continued support for and protection of Chia Lee\u2019s longstanding edible flour distributorship with the Singaporean Company. Ishibe and Masui, on the other hand, claimed that the payments they had received from Koh were not inducements or rewards for advancing Chia Lee\u2019s business interests, but compensation for underwriting the huge risks of the industrial flour business.', '13\\u2003The District Judge found that Masui and Ishibe had received the payments from Koh in exchange for their continued support for and protection of Chia Lee\u2019s edible flour business (see Public Prosecutor v Katsutoshi Ishibe and another [2018] SGDC 239 (\u201cthe District Judge\u2019s Judgment\u201d) at [64]). Accordingly, he convicted Masui and Ishibe on all charges. He imposed a sentence of between 12 and 18 months\u2019 imprisonment per charge, based on the amount of the gratification stated in each charge (see the District Judge\u2019s Judgment at [123]\u2013[124]). He further ordered that the sentences for four charges were to run consecutively, thereby resulting in an aggregate sentence of 66 months\u2019 imprisonment for Ishibe and Masui each (see the District Judge\u2019s Judgment at [127]). Pursuant to s 13 of the PCA, the District Judge also ordered that they each pay a penalty of $1,025,701 (being half of the total gratification sum of $2,051,402) or serve an imprisonment term of six months in default of payment (see the District Judge\u2019s Judgment at [132]).', '14\\u2003Ishibe and Masui appealed against their convictions and sentences. In Takaaki Masui v Public Prosecutor and another appeal and other matters [2021] 4 SLR 160 (\u201cthe HC Judgment\u201d), the High Court judge (\u201cthe Judge\u201d) dismissed the appeals against conviction but allowed the appeals against sentence. The bulk of the HC Judgment was devoted to an elaborate 3D sentencing framework for offences under ss 6(a) and 6(b) of the PCA. Based on this sentencing framework, the Judge reduced Ishibe\u2019s and Masui\u2019s sentences to 43 months and three weeks\u2019 imprisonment and a fine of $200,944 (see the HC Judgment at [315]). The Judge also amended the gratification amount reflected in two of the charges, namely, C21 and C25. The amount stated in C21 was reduced from $102,115 to $86,275 while the amount stated in C25 was reduced from $137,340 to $111,211 (see the HC Judgment at [9] and [55]). The total gratification sum was thus reduced from $2,051,402 to $2,009,433 (see the HC Judgment at [9] and [56]).', '15\\u2003Although the sentencing framework devised by the Judge was not an issue before us, we caution that excessively complex or technical sentencing frameworks are prone to cause confusion and uncertainty, which are the very antithesis of a sound sentencing framework. As we previously observed in Mohd Akebal s\/o Ghulam Jilani v Public Prosecutor and another appeal [2020] 1 SLR 266 at [20(b)], sentencing benchmarks are never intended to achieve mathematically precise sentences. We therefore do not endorse the Judge\u2019s sentencing framework, which is as complex as it is likely to be of little assistance to sentencing courts. In laying down a sentencing framework, the court should introduce only \u201cas much complexity as [is] necessary to make [the framework] theoretically just without making it either incomprehensible or too intricate for practical application\u201d (see John Bernard Corr, \u201cSupreme Court Doctrine in the Trenches: The Case of Collateral Estoppel\u201d (1985) 27 Wm & Mary L Rev 35 at 85).', '16\\u2003As for the penalty imposed under s 13 of the PCA, Masui and Ishibe urged the Judge to deduct the following sums from the total gratification sum of $2,009,433 and, therefore, from the penalty imposed on each of them:', '(a)\\u2003the sum of $200,000 paid to Sojitz Singapore in full and final settlement of the judgment sum awarded by a Japanese civil court against Ishibe and Masui;', '(b)\\u2003the sum of US$240,000 transferred by Masui to Koh in June 2005 (see [9] above); and', '(c)\\u2003the sums of $33,322.20 and US$138,152.48 (approximately $171,309.07 based on the exchange rate then) that were recovered by the authorities from Masui\u2019s frozen bank accounts.', '17\\u2003Relying on Marzuki at [71], Masui and Ishibe submitted that s 13 of the PCA was intended to prevent corrupt recipients from retaining their ill-gotten gains and was not meant to function as an additional punitive measure.', '18\\u2003The Judge rejected that submission. He held that where the gratification was \u201ca sum of money\u201d (by which he meant an outright gift of money), the court had to impose a penalty of a sum equal to the amount of the gratification and had no discretion to take into account the fact that part or all of that gratification might have been repaid or disgorged (see the HC Judgment at [326] and [336]). It was only in cases where the gratification \u201cdid not take the form of a sum of money (eg, a loan or a service)\u201d that the court had the \u201climited discretion\u201d to determine the value of that gratification (see the HC Judgment at [326]).', '19\\u2003On the facts, the Judge held that Koh\u2019s payments to Ishibe and Masui were outright gifts of money and that he was thus obliged to impose a penalty of a sum equivalent to the total gratification sum (see the HC Judgment at [336]). As the total gratification sum was reduced from $2,051,402 to $2,009,433, the Judge accordingly reduced the penalty imposed on Ishibe and Masui to $1,004,716.50 each (see the HC Judgment at [337] and [340]). Adding the fine of $200,944 and the penalty of $1,004,716.50, the Judge imposed a recomputed sentence of 12 months\u2019 imprisonment in default of payment of the aggregate sum of $1,205,660.50 (see the HC Judgment at [340]\u2013[341]).', '20\\u2003Following the Judge\u2019s decision, the Prosecution filed CRF 3 while Ishibe and Masui filed CM 1 and CM 2 respectively.'"}

All the conditions for issue estoppel to arise had been met. First, the English Decisions were earlier judgments that were final and conclusive on the merits, and had been reached by courts of competent jurisdiction. The Judge rejected the Appellant\u2019s contention that issue estoppel could not arise without a formal application for leave to \u201crecognise\u201d the English Decisions: Judgment at [17]. There were no applicable defences to the recognition of these decisions; neither was there any risk that recognising these decisions might give rise to inconsistent future decisions in Singapore because no local decisions on the subject matter of these decisions had been made yet: Judgment at [18]\u2013[19]. Second, the parties to both the English and the Singapore proceedings were identical. The Judge rejected the Appellant\u2019s argument that issue estoppel could not arise because there were other parties to the English proceedings who were not parties to the Singapore proceedings. He pointed out that the Appellant was a party to both sets of proceedings (as well as a successor to the 1970 Agreement), and was thus capable of being bound by issue estoppel. This conclusion was not displaced by the fact that there were other parties in the English proceedings: Judgment at [20] and [28]. The Judge also rejected the Appellant\u2019s argument that the Respondent was not the successor company of E Merck on the basis of evidence that the Appellant had sued the Respondent in the United States on the 1970 Agreement, as well as the ECA\u2019s holding that the Respondent was E Merck\u2019s successor company: Judgment at [21]. Third, the Judge was satisfied that the issues in the English proceedings were identical to those in the Singapore proceedings. He disagreed with the Appellant that the ECA\u2019s findings of breach pertained to acts committed in the UK while the Singapore proceedings concerned acts that were specific to Singapore. Crucial to his decision was his holding that such an argument did not in fact meet the Respondent\u2019s principal submission on issue estoppel, which was that the Appellant was bound by the ECA\u2019s decision on the interpretation of cl 7 of the 1970 Agreement, rather than on any breach of that agreement: Judgment at [23].', '13\\u2003The Judge subsequently provided some oral clarifications on 14 October 2019 regarding an argument that had been made by the Appellant, namely, that it would not be fair to make a finding on issue estoppel in relation to cl 7 of the 1970 Agreement alone because cll 5, 6 and 7 should be looked at in their totality. The Judge opined that his Judgment had held only that the Appellant was bound by issue estoppel based on the English Decisions. Clause 5 was a carve-out from the restrictions in cl 7, and it was only necessary to consider the interpretation of cl 5 when dealing with specific allegations of breach or infringement of the 1970 Agreement. Clause 5 therefore did not affect the interpretation of cl 7 itself, which was all that was the subject of the issue estoppel.'"}

Metax counterclaimed against SEC for, inter alia, a sum of $2,134,196.66. Suit 965 was heard over eight days by Justice Vinodh Coomaraswamy (\u201cthe Judge\u201d) in February 2015. Parties then put in written submissions which were to be followed by oral closing submissions on 25 September 2015.

SEC\u2019s application was granted and a stay was ordered by the court in respect of all pending, contingent or fresh actions or proceedings against SEC. On 25 September 2015, because of the possibility of a scheme of arrangement, the Judge adjourned the hearing of Suit 965 to 24 May 2016. Eventually, SEC failed to persuade the majority of its creditors to approve the proposed scheme.', '9\\u2003In the meantime, on 17 February 2016, SEC had applied to be placed under judicial management. A judicial management order was made on 27 June 2016. Consequently, the hearing of Suit 965 was postponed several times and finally to 30 October 2017.', '10\\u2003On 7 August 2017, SEC was ordered to be wound up in HC\/CWU 90\/2017. As at the date of the winding-up order, SEC had about 746 creditors with total claims of approximately $190,764,861 in book value, and contingent claims of approximately $176,754,837, whereas the estimated realisable value of SEC\u2019s assets amounted to approximately $24,288,507.', '11\\u2003On 8 September 2017, Metax filed a proof of debt with the Liquidators for the sum of $2,728,692.46.', '12\\u2003On 16 October 2017, the Liquidators applied for a stay of proceedings in Suit 965.

On 26 September 2018, the Liquidators\u2019 solicitors replied suggesting that in lieu of an oral hearing, it would be sensible to request the Judge to determine Suit 965 on the basis of the written closing submissions which the parties had already filed. Metax was not agreeable to this proposal. Thus, the Liquidators then had to decide whether to go ahead with the oral closing submissions, a course that would not only expose them to legal fees payable by SEC but would also incur the risk of SEC being ordered to pay Metax\u2019s costs which costs would stand in priority to other claims against SEC. There was a real prospect of SEC\u2019s assets being insufficient to pay such costs with the result that the Liquidators might have to bear the costs personally.', '14\\u2003On 4 January 2019, the Liquidators filed an ex parte application (\u201cSUM 79\u201d) under s 273(3) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (\u201cCompanies Act\u201d) for directions on the following matters:', '15\\u2003Thereafter, Metax filed an application for leave to intervene in SUM 79 and was granted leave to do so by the Judge on 29 April 2019.

The respondent in CA 73 and the appellant in CA 74 is Ms Angelina Jiang (\u201cMs Jiang\u201d), the defendant below.', '6\\u2003Mr Toh and Ms Jiang met each other sometime in November 2016. At the time, Mr Toh was around 55 years old and was married to one Mdm Chong Lee Yee (\u201cMdm Chong\u201d). He had three grown children from a previous marriage. He was a businessman and the director and shareholder of a number of companies, including ST Paper Resources Pte Ltd (\u201cMr Toh\u2019s company\u201d). Ms Jiang was around 30 years old and was a licenced property agent and manager of a construction and engineering company. She was the owner of a property at 13 Prome Road at the material time. The parties entered into a romantic relationship sometime around 20 December 2016.', '7\\u2003It was not disputed that Ms Jiang received money from Mr Toh on a number of occasions between December 2016 and March 2017. Mr Toh passed the money to her in various ways and we refer to these collectively as \u201ctransfers\u201d, a neutral term. The transfers can be categorised into two classes: (a) general transfers of money between December 2016 and March 2017 (\u201cGeneral Transfers\u201d); and (b) transfers related to the intended purchase of a property at 9 Hillcrest Road (\u201c9 Hillcrest Transfers\u201d).', '8\\u2003The General Transfers are summarised in the following table:', '9\\u2003It suffices here to note that apart from Item 1, which was remitted to Ms Jiang to assist her in purchasing a shophouse at 315 Balestier Road, the General Transfers were intended to be used for various expenses and to pay off debts that Ms Jiang owed.', '10\\u2003Between January and February 2017, Ms Jiang also transferred various sums totalling $95,000 to Mr Toh. This amount formed part of Ms Jiang\u2019s counterclaim.', '11\\u2003There were four transfers related to the purchase of 9 Hillcrest Road, as follows (we continue the numbering from the table above):', '12\\u2003While the parties disputed the purpose for which 9 Hillcrest Road was being purchased, the facts surrounding that transaction are not controversial. On 12 January 2017, Mr Toh wanted to purchase 3H Hillcrest Road for $2,830,000, and issued a cheque for $28,300 as payment for the option fee. The parties then went to see 9 Hillcrest Road the next day and decided to buy it instead. Thus Mr Toh forfeited the option fee for 3H Hillcrest Road. On 26 January 2017, Mr Toh issued a cheque of $30,800 (being 1% of the purchase price of 9 Hillcrest Road) (Item 13 above) and the option to purchase was issued in Ms Jiang\u2019s name. On 16 February 2017, Mr Toh passed a cheque for $123,200 to Ms Jiang through her solicitors handling the purchase and Ms Jiang used this to exercise the option. This cheque, however, was countermanded. It was only on 27 February 2017 that a new cheque for $123,200 was issued and then later handed to the vendor (Item 14 above).', '13\\u2003When there were issues with the financing of the purchase, various proposals were considered and rejected by the parties. Sometime between 23 and 27 February 2017, they ultimately decided that some terms should be documented. On 27 February 2017, Ms Jiang instructed her solicitor, Mr Christopher Yong (\u201cMr Yong\u201d) from Legal Solutions LLC\/Kennedys Law, to begin preparing a formal document, and on 28 February 2017, she informed Mr Toh that she had done so. Thereafter a series of drafts was exchanged between Ms Jiang\u2019s lawyers and Mr Toh\u2019s lawyer, Ms Pamela Chong (\u201cMs Chong\u201d) from Infinitus Law Corporation (\u201cInfinitus Law\u201d) (see the Judgment at [85]\u2013[96]). These drafts resulted in what was called the Loan Facilities Agreement (\u201cthe LFA\u201d). It suffices to note here that both sides had included terms in the LFA that appeared to protect their respective interests. Before the LFA was signed, Mr Toh passed a cheque of $250,000 to Ms Jiang (Item 15 above).', '14\\u2003The LFA was signed on 24 March 2017 before a Commissioner for Oaths. The first recital of the LFA stated that Ms Jiang wished to invest in property and in particular in 9 Hillcrest Road. The third recital stated that at Ms Jiang\u2019s request, Mr Toh had agreed to provide her with a loan facility. We summarise the key terms of the LFA as follows:', '(a)\\u2003The loan facility granted under the LFA was in the amount of $2m. Out of that sum, it was stated that Mr Toh had already advanced $1,128,000 by March 2017 (this included the $250,000 advanced on 21 March 2017) and that the remainder would be disbursed by cashier\u2019s order or cheque for $872,000 (cl 2.2). There was to be no interest chargeable (cl 2.3), and the loan facility was stated to be the purpose of purchasing 9 Hillcrest Road (cl 2.4).', '(b)\\u2003The loan facility was to be fully repaid upon either the sale of 13 Prome Road or on the redemption date (ie, 10 years from the date of full disbursement of the loan facility or upon occurrence of an event of default per cl 1), whichever was earlier. However, if Ms Jiang wished to sell 13 Prome Road, Mr Toh was to be given the right of first refusal at a price to be mutually agreed with reference to the market price (cl 3.1). If Mr Toh agreed to purchase 13 Prome Road, Ms Jiang would be entitled to set off the loan against that purchase price (cl 3.2). If it was sold to a third party, the loan was to be deducted and paid from the sale proceeds.', '(c)\\u2003If Mr Toh passed away before the redemption date, the loan was to be deemed to be fully repaid and Ms Jiang\u2019s obligations fully extinguished (cl 4).', '15\\u2003The sum of $1,128,000 mentioned in cl 2.2 had been arrived at by adding Items 1 to 15 together then deducting the $95,000 which Ms Jiang had transferred to Mr Toh. This gave a figure of $1,128,532 which was then rounded down to $1,128,000.', '16\\u2003On 24 March 2017, after the LFA was signed, Mr Toh handed a cheque for $872,000 to Ms Jiang (Item 16 above). Ultimately, however, the purchase of 9 Hillcrest Road did not go through \u2013 by a letter dated 31 March 2017, Ms Jiang\u2019s lawyers informed the vendor\u2019s lawyers that she was unable to proceed with the purchase as she was unable to obtain a housing loan. As a result, the vendors threatened to sue Ms Jiang and, after some negotiations, Ms Jiang paid an additional $60,000 to settle all claims arising from the aborted transaction.', '17\\u2003Sometime around 31 March 2017, Ms Jiang transferred a sum of $150,000 to Mr Toh. Following this, on Ms Jiang\u2019s instructions, Mr Yong prepared three drafts of a Deed of Gift (\u201cDraft Deed 1\u201d, \u201cDraft Deed 2\u201d, and \u201cDraft Deed 3\u201d, respectively, and \u201cDraft Deeds\u201d, collectively) on 6 April, 27 April, and 5 May 2017, respectively. None of these Draft Deeds was executed by Mr Toh.', '18\\u2003As noted above, the purchase of 9 Hillcrest Road did not go through. The parties continued to correspond after the LFA was signed, but they began to grow distant. From 12 April 2017, according to Ms Jiang, she had difficulty reaching Mr Toh. On 19 April 2017, she discovered that she was pregnant and informed Mr Toh (unfortunately, she later suffered a miscarriage). There were some replies from Mr Toh in late April 2017, but by 12 May 2017, Ms Jiang was unable to contact Mr Toh.', '19\\u2003On 13 June 2017, Mr Toh\u2019s lawyers wrote a letter of demand to Ms Jiang seeking repayment of $2m. There were letters exchanged concerning the pregnancy, with Mr Toh denying that he was the father. On 11 July 2017, Mr Toh started proceedings in the High Court against Ms Jiang seeking to recover the sum of $2m as money loaned to Ms Jiang, and to invalidate the LFA.'"}

Panoil Petroleum Pte Ltd (\u201cPanoil\u201d) was CIMB\u2019s customer and took banking facilities from it. Panoil was placed under judicial management in October 2017. The respondent, World Fuel Services (Singapore) Pte Ltd (\u201cWFS\u201d) is a bunker trader. Parties accepted that WFS had purchased marine fuel from Panoil and did not dispute the occurrence of 11 sales transactions between WFS and Panoil, which are the subject of CIMB\u2019s claims (\u201cSubject Transactions\u201d). However, the actual contractual documents and\/or terms that governed these transactions were disputed.', '3\\u2003The details of the Subject Transactions and the corresponding invoices (the \u201cInvoices\u201d) are:', '4\\u2003Each Subject Transaction in this judgment will be referred to in the order reflected in this table, ie, the transaction with the invoice dated 6 July 2017 will be referred to as the first transaction and so on.', '5\\u2003CIMB offered Panoil loan facilities up to a limit of US$5,000,000 pursuant to a facility letter dated 29 June 2016 (the \u201cFirst Facility Letter\u201d). Subsequently, CIMB made a revision to the First Facility Letter by way of a supplementary facility letter dated 12 July 2016 (the \u201cSecond Facility Letter\u201d). Thereafter, CIMB made variations to the First and Second Facility Letters by another supplementary facility letter dated 6 July 2017.', '6\\u2003CIMB\u2019s case here, and in the suit below, is that Panoil had executed the Debenture dated 15 July 2016 in favour of CIMB over all goods and\/or receivables and documents representing goods financed by CIMB as security. In respect of the Subject Transactions, Panoil issued the Invoices to WFS on dates between 6 July and 12 August 2017. The aggregate sum due under the Invoices came to US$5,093,643.82 without interest (see the table at [3] above). In or around August 2017, Panoil faced financial difficulties. CIMB gave notice to WFS by way of a notice of assignment dated 29 August 2017 (the \u201cNOA\u201d) that Panoil had assigned all its rights, title, interest and benefit under the Invoices to CIMB. CIMB then demanded payment from WFS of the sums under the Invoices including late payment interest. When WFS did not make payment, CIMB commenced HC\/S 184\/2018 based on its rights under the Debenture as the legal assignee.', '7\\u2003As to the contractual documents that governed the Subject Transactions, CIMB\u2019s case was that the contracts governing Panoil\u2019s sale of marine fuel to WFS were (a) Panoil\u2019s sales confirmations (\u201cPanoil\u2019s Sales Confirmations\u201d), which incorporated Panoil\u2019s terms and conditions for sales of marine fuel (\u201cPanoil\u2019s Terms and Conditions\u201d); and (b) the corresponding Invoices issued by Panoil (collectively, the \u201cSales Contracts\u201d). Clause 8.2 of Panoil\u2019s Terms and Conditions precluded the right of set-off (\u201cClause 8.2\u201d).', '8\\u2003WFS\u2019 case was that the Subject Transactions were not governed by the Sales Contracts, but by three contracts entered into between WFS and Panoil, each of which contained a provision entitling WFS to a right of set-off:', '(a)\\u2003a Contract of Affreightment dated 30 December 2016 (the \u201c2016 COA\u201d) which governed the third transaction;', '(b)\\u2003a Transportation Agreement, M\/T \u201cOPHELLIA\u201d dated 1 January 2017 (the \u201c2017 TA\u201d) which governed the first and second transactions; and', '(c)\\u2003a Contract of Affreightment dated 11 July 2017 (the \u201c2017 COA\u201d) which governed the fourth to eleventh transactions.', '9\\u2003The 2016 COA, 2017 TA and 2017 COA shall be referred to collectively as the \u201cUmbrella Contracts\u201d. In addition, Panoil and WFS had entered into an offset agreement dated 20 August 2014, providing for the mutual setting off of certain payable sums (the \u201c2014 Offset Agreement\u201d). Under the 2014 Offset Agreement and the Umbrella Contracts, WFS was entitled to set off the sums due under the Invoices to Panoil.', '10\\u2003CIMB argued that the Umbrella Contracts did not apply to the Subject Transactions, and that the terms of the 2014 Offset Agreement did not apply to or were not incorporated into the Sales Contracts. In any event, any right of set-off which arose under the Umbrella Contracts and\/or the 2014 Offset Agreement had been superseded by Clause 8.2.', '11\\u2003WFS claimed that in exercise of its rights under the 2014 Offset Agreement, it had issued eight offset notices between 11 July 2017 to 16 August 2017. By virtue of these notices, WFS had set off the entire sum due to Panoil under the Invoices. WFS claimed that at the date of the receipt of the NOA on 29 August 2017, there were no longer any amounts outstanding or accruing to Panoil pursuant to the Subject Transactions.', '12\\u2003WFS explained its relationship with Panoil as follows. WFS was a bunker trader with access to a supply of marine fuel and entered into contracts for the supply of fuel to end-user vessels or vessel owners. However, it did not have the necessary license issued by the Maritime Port Authority to deliver the marine fuel. As such, it hired independent physical suppliers with the requisite licenses, such as Panoil, to serve as its intermediaries. Accordingly, WFS entered into \u201cbarging or delivered deals\u201d where Panoil would be allowed to load WFS\u2019 product on the basis that the Panoil-nominated bunker barges would deliver the fuel to WFS\u2019 customers (the \u201cbarging or delivered deals\u201d). It was a matter of trade practice that bunker traders such as WFS would supply marine fuel by way of sale to independent physical suppliers like Panoil on appropriate credit terms. WFS had extended credit to Panoil and permitted Panoil typically up to 30 days following delivery of marine fuel to effect payment.', '13\\u2003WFS also explained that under these \u201cbarging or delivered deals\u201d, WFS would sell marine fuel to Panoil and then repurchase the same quantity of marine fuel from Panoil at an agreed mark-up. The difference between the sale price and the repurchase price represented the freight payable to Panoil for transporting the fuel. This arrangement was necessary as it was a condition of Panoil\u2019s license that it held title to the marine fuel that it was transporting at the point of supply to the vessel. WFS claimed that these \u201cbarging or delivered deals\u201d, including the repurchases under the Subject Transactions, were governed by the Umbrella Contracts.'"}

The Disciplinary Tribunal found Mr Koh guilty of two charges but determined that no cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action existed under s 83 of the LPA, and recommended that Mr Koh be ordered to pay a penalty of $10,000.', '6\\u2003Again dissatisfied, Mr Loh applied for a review of the Disciplinary Tribunal\u2019s determination pursuant to s 97 of the LPA. Mr Loh argued that the Disciplinary Tribunal erred in not finding Mr Koh guilty of all the charges and in determining that Mr Koh\u2019s conduct did not constitute cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action. The application was heard by a different judge (\u201cthe Judge\u201d) who found that two additional charges had been made out, but agreed that on the whole, there was no cause of sufficient gravity to warrant referral to the C3J and a penalty was sufficient. She substituted the Disciplinary Tribunal\u2019s recommendation of a penalty of $10,000 with a recommended penalty of $12,500.

The crux of the debate, however, \ncentres on whether legal proximity arises, and if so, on whether any duty of care \nthat might be found to be admissible as a matter of principle should be negated \nby countervailing policy considerations.\n17 Some  of the arguments militating against a finding that a duty of care \narises in such circumstances include these:\nVersion No 1: 05 Mar 2021 (14:58 hrs)\nTan Woo Thian v PricewaterhouseCoopers[2021] SGCA 20\nAdvisory Services Pte Ltd\n9(a) First, there is a potential clash between the scope of the \ncontractual duties undertaken by the professional fact-finder to its client \non the one hand, and the tortious duties that are imposed on it in favour \nof the world at large, and in particular the target of an investigation, on \nthe other. This may be seen as a subset of the real difficulty of imposing \ntortious duties in circumstances where a party is carrying out a \ncontractual duty owed to another. This might apply with particular force \nin a setting like the present, where the contractual duty pertains to and \nhas the very real prospect of affecting the third party, who then wishes \nto sue the investigator. Given that an investigator will likely have \nspecifically imposed contractual restrictions on the scope of its work and \non the permitted uses of its work product, and that any remuneration will \nhave been agreed on the basis of such restrictions and limitations, \ntortious obligations which impose a supervening standard of care that \nmight conceivably even exceed any duty taken on with respect to the \ncontracting party ought to be scrutinised very closely. This may be said \nto apply in an even more pronounced manner in contexts where the very \nobject of the contractual arrangement is to find a basis upon which the \nfact-finder\u2019s client can take a course of action that is adverse to the  third \nparty. \n(b) Second, there may exist other avenues for individuals who \nbelieve they have been wronged by the findings of professional fact-\nfinders in such circumstances. Those who publish falsehoods may be \nliable in defamation, while the conduct of work in a dishonest manner \nor in a manner that no reasonable professional would have done could \ngive rise to complaints of professional misconduct. \nVersion No 1: 05 Mar 2021 (14:58 hrs)\nTan Woo Thian v PricewaterhouseCoopers[2021] SGCA 20\nAdvisory Services Pte Ltd\n10(c) Third, and as suggested by the Judge below, recognising a duty \nof care in such contexts might engender defensive and excessively \ncircumspect reporting, which could be deleterious for professional fact-\nfinders and those who engage their services. \n18 By contrast, the following arguments, among others, may be raised in \nsupport of a duty of care being found in facts akin to the present: \n(a) First, considerations of circumstantial and causal proximity \nclearly arise on the facts, and these militate in favour of a finding of legal \nproximity: Spandeck at [78] and [79]. Circumstantial proximity arises \ninsofar as the professional fact-finder has procured and gained \u201cspecial \nknowledge\u201d of the third party, whether through canvassing information \nfrom the contracting party, or through the fact-finder\u2019s own perusal of \ndocuments and other objective evidence. Moreover, there is causal \nproximity insofar as loss to the third party would be a direct and \nimmediate, or at least a highly foreseeable, consequence of the \nprofessional fact-finder\u2019s negligence in preparing and presenting his \nfindings on the third party\u2019s behaviour and conduct. Unlike other \nsituations, the professional fact-finder in circumstances such as the \npresent is tasked with making factual findings and drawing specific \nconclusions directly pertaining to the third party\u2019s conduct, and it is easy \nto see that erroneous findings can have harmful consequences on the \ntarget of the investigation. This might suggest that legal proximity \nshould be found, and that a duty of care should arise. \n(b) Second, there might not be any necessary or inevitable conflict \nbetween an investigator\u2019s contractual obligations and the duties that it \nwould owe in tort if a duty of care were found. This will of course turn \nVersion No 1: 05 Mar 2021 (14:58 hrs)\nTan Woo Thian v PricewaterhouseCoopers[2021] SGCA 20\nAdvisory Services Pte Ltd\n11on the precise content of the duty, but it is often the case that a party \nacting under a contract, say a building contractor, may nonetheless owe \na tortious duty to prevent foreseeable harm, say damage to a \nneighbouring property caused by careless work. Does this analysis \nnecessarily change because the purpose of the contractual engagement \nis to do something that is in some ways likely to be adverse to the third \nparty? If so, how and why? Does the notion of owing a duty to a third \nparty necessarily present a potential for conflict with the professional \nfact-finder\u2019s duty to the appointing party?  \n(c) Third, the existence of alternative causes of action such as \ndefamation need not preclude the finding of a duty of care. Defamation, \nwhich is aimed at the vindication of reputation, might not always address \nthe mischief that a claim in negligence would. Professional fact-finders \nwho make negligent or careless observations that give rise to loss may \nhave done so inadvertently and\/or in circumstances that do not affect the \nreputation of"}

Though PHSB attempted to explain its reasons for doing so (allegedly for tax purposes), the Judge found the explanations unsatisfactory.', '22\\u2003The third and fourth issue (whether there had indeed been a Common Expectation, as well as whether the Malaysian court had been misled in the Malaysian Suit) were related. The Judge took the view that material facts had not been disclosed in the Malaysian Suit. 33', 'Her Honour held that there had been no Common Expectation and that had those material facts been disclosed, the Malaysian court would have come to a different conclusion regarding the issue of the Common Expectation. 34', '23\\u2003In particular, the Judge relied on the following in holding that there was in fact no Common Expectation:', '(a)\\u2003Ong was the directing mind for both SHGCC and PHSB. A \u201ccommon\u201d expectation between the two companies would have entailed Ong \u201ctalk[ing] to himself\u201d 35', 'and executing a plan that he had unilaterally devised.

Her Honour found that the following facts had not been disclosed in the Malaysian Suit: 42', '(a)\\u2003PHSB did not pay off one of its loans (\u201cthe Maybank Loan\u201d) 43', 'by itself. It was instead repaid by three companies in the Sutera Group along with some of Ong\u2019s other companies. 44', '(b)\\u2003One of the loans which PHSB took on to build the Co-Gen Facility (\u201cthe Bank Islam Loan\u201d) 45', 'was instead used as working capital. 46', '(c)\\u2003Ong owned the company that was paid RM115m to construct the Co-Gen Facility. 47', '(d)\\u2003Ong owned OBSB, which was his nominee to buy the assets of PHSB under the ASA. 48', '(e)\\u2003For the purposes of the ASA, OBSB did not use its own money to settle PHSB\u2019s debts but had instead borrowed money from Sabah Development Bank to do so. By settling PHSB\u2019s debts, Ong was released from a personal guarantee. 49', '(f)\\u2003The Co-Gen Facility had stopped supplying electricity to SH Resort in 2002 after just three years of operation. OBSB operated the Co-Gen Facility and provided electricity for Sabah Electricity Sdn Bhd (\u201cSESB\u201d) (and through SESB, to the SH Resort) for just one year, ceasing operations in 2015, with the Co-Gen Facility remaining dormant since then. 50', '25\\u2003As for the fourth issue, the Judge declined to accept and recognise the judgment in the Malaysian Suit as she was of the view that the Malaysian court had been deceived \u201cbecause of the fraudulent conduct of [Ong] encapsulated in his transferring the Subject Land (worth at least RM250,000 at market value according to [Borneo Ventures]) to OBSB for a nominal RM1,000, and in then withholding key facts from the Malaysian court\u201d (see [24] above) 51', 'Accordingly, the Malaysian Judgment had been procured by fraud and the doctrine of res judicata could not apply.', '26\\u2003The Judge was also of the view that even if the Malaysian Judgment was recognised, the extended doctrine of res judicata (which would preclude Borneo Ventures from raising issues that ought properly to have been raised and argued in the Malaysian Suit) would not apply. Her Honour found that since Borneo Ventures was exercising contractual rights under the SA which was subject to Singapore law, it could not, in any event, have been joined as a co-plaintiff in the Malaysian Suit. 52', 'Additionally, issue estoppel could not have applied because the plaintiffs and the issues to be litigated in the present action instituted by Borneo Ventures against Ong were different. The Malaysian Suit involved SHGCC suing OBSB and Ong over ownership of the Subject Land while the present matter involved Borneo Ventures suing Ong for breach of warranties under the SA. 53', '27\\u2003Finally, in respect of the fifth issue (ie, whether Ong had breached the warranties given in the SA), the Judge found that since PHSB did not have a proprietary interest in the Subject Land (ie, that at all material times the Subject Land remained in the ownership of SHGCC), it thus formed part of the assets which Borneo Ventures acquired when it bought over 77.5% of the shares in the SH Group from Ong. 54', 'Accordingly, the Judge found that: 55', '(a)\\u2003Ong had breached paragraphs 4.1(c) and 4.1(g) of Schedule 2 by disposing of the Subject Land under the S&P to OBSB.', '(b)\\u2003Ong had breached paragraphs 6.6(b), 11.1, and 11.2(a) of Schedule 2 by disposing of the Subject Land at a price that was clearly lower than its market value, and this disposal was certainly not on an arm\u2019s length basis as Ong was also a director of OBSB.', '(c)\\u2003Ong had breached paragraph 18.2 of Schedule 2 (read with Schedule 4) as OBSB had obtained an interest in the Subject Land under the S&P, and therefore, the statement in Schedule 2 that SHGCC was the sole legal and beneficial owner of the Sembulan Land (which included the Subject Land) was false at the time of completion.', '28\\u2003Relatedly, the Judge also found that the limitation of liability clause under cl 8A.1(c)(i) of the SA could not apply. In order for the clause to apply, the fact, matter, event or circumstance giving rise to a claim must have been disclosed to Borneo Ventures. It is not in dispute that Ong never disclosed that PHSB had an interest in the Subject Land although the Judge went further to also find that PHSB never had a proprietary interest in the land. 56', 'Moreover, the Judge also found that Ong and his employee, Lee Ken, had wilfully suppressed information on the subdivision exercise and the existence of the S&P. 57', 'Therefore, any oblique disclosure made in the Disclosure Letter would not have been sufficient to enable Ong to enjoy the protection accorded under cl 8A.1(c)(i). 58', '29\\u2003Consequently, the Judge ordered that there be: 59', '(a)\\u2003an injunction to restrain Ong from completing the sale of the Subject Land for RM1,000 and\/or from enforcing the S&P;', '(b)\\u2003a mandatory injunction that Ong procure OBSB to discharge\/terminate the S&P forthwith;', '(c)\\u2003an award of damages, with an order that an inquiry be held before the Registrar to assess the damages due to Borneo Ventures for the losses that it suffered as a result of Ong\u2019s breaches of the warranties; and', '(d)\\u2003a costs order in favour of Borneo Ventures, for costs to be taxed on a standard basis which were to include $1,000 to account for Ong\u2019s late filing of a supplementary affidavit.'"}
{"casename":"2021_SGCA_22","fact":"'2\\u2003As stated above, the applicant was convicted, after a trial, on four charges of rape and two charges of SAP. These acts were committed against two 14-year-old girls (see the GD at [1]). The applicant employed the same modus operandi on both victims. He lured the victims to his flat on the pretext of offering them a job and thereafter raped and forced the victims to fellate him under threat of harm (see the GD at [26], [28], [31] and [41]). The applicant also recorded videos of these sexual acts (see the GD at [26], [37] and [44]). By threatening to circulate the said videos, he coerced and raped one of the victims for a second time (see the GD at [31]). The trial was scheduled to commence in August 2019 before the Judge. However, the applicant\u2019s bizarre and blatant conduct during the trial had the effect of delaying proceedings.', '3\\u2003At the close of the trial on 5 February 2020, the Judge convicted the applicant on all six proceeded charges. The Judge found that there was overwhelming objective evidence \u2013 such as videos of the assault recorded by the applicant himself \u2013 that the applicant had performed the relevant sexual acts on the two victims (see the GD at [59] and [85]). Additionally, the Judge found that both victims were credible and reliable witnesses whose evidence was generally consistent (see the GD at [71]\u2013[72] and [93]). He therefore accepted their testimony that they had been coerced into performing the sexual acts with the applicant. The Judge also ascertained from the applicant\u2019s cross-examination of the first victim and his written closing submissions that the applicant\u2019s defence was essentially that: (a) both victims had consented to the sexual acts (see the GD at [52]); and (b) he was a victim of a conspiracy by the first victim and her friends as well as a fabrication by the second victim (see the GD at [53]). After considering the evidence, the Judge rejected both aspects of the applicant\u2019s defence. On sentencing, the Judge imposed a global sentence of 32 years\u2019 imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane (see the GD at [111]).', '4\\u2003The Judge held that the offences fell within Band 2 of the sentencing frameworks for rape and SAP as set out in the Court of Appeal decisions in Ng Kean Meng Terence v Public Prosecutor [2017] 2 SLR 449 at [73] and Pram Nair v Public Prosecutor [2017] 2 SLR 1015 at [119] and [159] respectively, having regard to the offence-specific aggravating factors such as: (a) the victims\u2019 vulnerability; (b) the presence of premeditation; (c) the use of threats; (d) the recording of the sexual assaults; and (e) the failure to use a condom (see the GD at [103]\u2013[104]). The Judge also regarded the applicant\u2019s prior convictions for similar sexual offences as an important offender-specific aggravating factor (see the GD at [105]). Significantly, the applicant had been convicted in 2008 for multiple sexual offences of a similar nature that were committed against four victims, three of whom were under the age of 16 at the material time (see the GD at [98]). The applicant had similarly targeted and lured those victims to different locations before sexually assaulting them and recording the sexual acts on his mobile phone. Such similarities between the applicant\u2019s antecedents and the present case underscored the need for a deterrent sentence.', '5\\u2003On 10 February 2020, the applicant filed an appeal against his conviction and sentence on the basis that the conviction was unreasonable and that his sentence was manifestly excessive. The applicant maintained his defence that the victims had consented to the sexual acts (see this court\u2019s decision in Isham bin Kayubi v Public Prosecutor [2020] SGCA 42 (\u201cthe Judgment\u201d) at [10]). He argued that his sentence was excessive because he did not physically harm the victims. In addition, the applicant urged us to grant him a retrial so that he might be represented by counsel (see the Judgment at [10]). At the hearing before us on 27 April 2020, the applicant sought an adjournment for him to engage counsel for the purposes of the appeal. We found no basis to grant any further adjournments and proceeded to hear the appeal. After hearing the parties, we dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal in its entirety (see the Judgment at [23]). We affirmed the Judge\u2019s findings of fact and were fully satisfied that the victims did not consent to the relevant sexual acts (see the Judgment at [18]). We also upheld the global sentence of 32 years\u2019 imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane as this was just and proportionate and in no way manifestly excessive (see the Judgment at [22]).', '6\\u2003Following our dismissal of the applicant\u2019s appeal, the applicant was certified to be medically unfit for caning due to age-related degenerative changes in his spine. Pursuant to s 331 of the CPC, the applicant\u2019s sentence of caning could not be carried out. On 20 July 2020, the Judge convened a hearing to decide whether to impose an additional sentence of imprisonment in lieu of the 24 strokes of the cane under s 332(2)(b) of the CPC. The applicant naturally urged the court not to impose any additional imprisonment term in lieu of caning. He pleaded for leniency and highlighted that his exemption from caning was through no fault of his own and that he was already facing a sufficiently long custodial sentence. While the Judge acknowledged that the accused was exempted on medical grounds and could not have known that he would be exempted from caning, he was equally of the view that an additional sentence of 12 months\u2019 imprisonment would serve to compensate for the lost deterrent and retributive effect of caning, especially given the numerous aggravating factors and the applicant\u2019s similarly grave antecedents. Accordingly, the Judge imposed on the applicant an additional 12 months\u2019 imprisonment in lieu of the 24 strokes of the cane.', '7\\u2003As noted at [1] above, the last day for the applicant to file a notice of appeal against the Judge\u2019s decision to impose the additional custodial term in lieu of caning, pursuant to s 377(2)(b) of the CPC, was 14 days after the Judge\u2019s sentence. Since the Judge sentenced the accused to 12 months\u2019 imprisonment in lieu of caning on 20 July 2020, the applicant had until 3 August 2020 to file an appeal. He did not do so. On 6 November 2020, however, the applicant filed the present criminal motion for an extension of time to file an appeal against the Judge\u2019s sentencing decision.'"}

Dextra and Weber \nstill did not raise any objections to the taking of accounts during the trial itself. \nAs the Judge observed, the witnesses, including Weber, were cross-examined \non the items dealt with in the Gafoor report.\nVersion No 1: 25 Mar 2021 (11:53 hrs)\nDextra Partners Pte Ltd v Lavrentiadis, Lavrentios[2021] SGCA 24\n1326 It was only during their closing submissions that Dextra and Weber \nsubmitted that the taking of accounts was premature. We agree with the Judge \nthat the objections were made far too late in the day and were simply \ninconsistent with their conduct throughout the trial.\n27 At the hearing before us, Dextra and Weber argued that they had \nsuffered prejudice as a result of the \u201cpremature\u201d taking of accounts. They placed \nextensive focus on several, specific, expenses that the Judge had found that they \nhad failed to account for. These expenses (and the relevant paragraphs in the \nJudgment) were listed in a chart, which was adduced as part of the Bundle of \nIllustrative Charts. \n28 The crux of Dextra\u2019s and Weber\u2019s argument here appears to be that \nbecause the taking of accounts had been done prematurely, it affected: \n(a) Weber\u2019s ability to explain certain expenses; (b) the Judge\u2019s perception of \nWeber\u2019s credibility and truthfulness; and (c) the Judge\u2019s finding that the \nInvestment Swap was not entered into.\n29 In our view, this argument simply cannot stand. There was no prejudice \nthat was suffered by Dextra and Weber. Dextra and Weber point specifically to \na number of paragraphs of the Judgment as instances where the Judge had found \ntheir expenses as lacking in supporting documents only because they had been \nunable to adduce evidence. As we noted above at [ 18]\u2013[ 21], however, they were \ngiven ample opportunity to produce such documents but had not done so. It is \nalso noted that they have not demonstrated that such other evidence does exist. \nFurther, these paragraphs should not be seen in isolation as they were additional \nobservations made by the Judge in relation to the state of the evidence. These \nwere not the only evidence that the Judge had relied on in coming to his \nconclusions. Indeed, as counsel for Lavrentiadis, Ms Sim Bock Eng \nVersion No 1: 25 Mar 2021 (11:53 hrs)\nDextra Partners Pte Ltd v Lavrentiadis, Lavrentios[2021] SGCA 24\n14(\u201cMs Sim\u201d), pointed out, the crucial reason why the Judge held against Dextra \nand Weber was because they simply had not been authorised to carry out the \ntransactions.\n30 We deal with the Investment Swap below at [ 34]\u2013[ 38]. Beyond that, \nhowever, there is also no basis for us to find that Weber\u2019s credibility and \ntruthfulness were affected as a result of the taking of accounts. This harks back \nto our observations above at [ 8], that an appellate court should accord great \nweight to a trial judge\u2019s findings in relation to credibility, the latter having had \nthe opportunity to directly observe the witnesses. Moreover, in this case, it is \nclear that the Judge had based his observations on credibility on a number of \nmatters quite apart from the absence of sufficient supporting documents. In \nparticular, he had observed that Weber vacillated constantly on his evidence, \neven on the most fundamental of points \u2013 for instance, the classification of the \ndifferent types of statements provided by Dextra, which was a matter he should \nhave been intimately familiar with.\n31 Moreover, in relation to each of the specific expenses, we agree with \nMs Sim that there is no basis to say that the Dextra and Weber were prejudiced \nas they had not produced sufficient supporting documents.\n(a) In relation to the Payments to Carnelia for fees in connection \nwith the Chengdu Foundation structure and Straits Invest\u2019s management \nfees, Dextra and Weber were unable to prove that they were authorised \nto make these payments.\n(b) In relation to the phone charges paid to Carnelia, Dextra and the \nprovision of mobile phone services, Dextra and Weber simply relied \nupon invoices that they themselves had issued. They could have, but did \nVersion No 1: 25 Mar 2021 (11:53 hrs)\nDextra Partners Pte Ltd v Lavrentiadis, Lavrentios[2021] SGCA 24\n15not adduce the underlying phone bills issued, which they did in relation \nto other claims. As we note below at [ 47], invoices cannot be used to \njustify the very sum that they seek to charge.\n(c) In relation to expenses with regard to Jade Monega, payment to \nDextra for Jade AP1, as well as payment for miscellaneous expenses and \nPearl Investment\u2019s Management Fees, Gafoor had specifically \nhighlighted that there was an absence of documents, and we say no more \non this issue.\n(d) In relation to the loan to Windris International Ltd, Dextra\u2019s and \nWeber\u2019s own claim was that it was made by way of an oral agreement. \nIt is difficult to see how they can now turn around and allege that \ndocuments would have been produced.\n32 Finally, Lavrentiadis rightly points to the decision of the Hong Kong \nCourt of Final"}

Crest Capital is a fund administration company and the holding company of Crest Catalyst, a fund management company which manages affiliated private equity funds. EFIII, VMF3 and VMIII are three such funds administered and managed by Crest Capital and Crest Catalyst.', '8\\u2003In CA 132\/2020, the appellant (\u201cMs Lim\u201d) was the Vice-President (Investment) of IHC between January 2015 and January 2016. She was IHC\u2019s CEO and Executive Director between January 2016 and January 2017.', '9\\u2003In CA 135\/2020, the appellant (\u201cMr Fan\u201d) is a co-founder of IHC and has a substantial shareholding in the same. He was the Group CEO of IHC between May 2015 and July 2015 and was re-designated as the CEO of IHC between July 2015 and January 2016.', '10\\u2003There are two other relevant players who should be mentioned, even though they are not parties to these appeals. The first is the seventh defendant in the suit below (\u201cMr Aathar\u201d), who did not file an appeal. He is the other co-founder of IHC and also a substantial shareholder of the same. However, he was never formally part of IHC\u2019s management. The second is one Glendon Tan Yang Hwee (\u201cMr Tan\u201d), who was the Investment Director of Crest Capital. Mr Tan was the main representative handling Crest Capital\u2019s business deals with IHC from the time of the latter\u2019s incorporation in 2013, including the deals which resulted in the facility agreements that are the subject of the dispute.', '11\\u2003These appeals centre around two credit facilities. The first is the Standby Facility, which was a short-term credit facility of up to $20m executed on 30 July 2015 for \u201cgeneral working capital\u201d. The borrower under the Standby Facility was IHC. The lenders were EFIII, VMF3 and VMIII (these three entities shall be referred together as the \u201cStandby Investors\u201d, and for the avoidance of doubt the Standby Investors, together with Crest Capital and Crest Catalyst, make up the Crest Entities). The Standby Facility provided for fixed interest (termed \u201cstandby fees\u201d) on the full sum of $20m at 3.5% per month for a minimum of five months (ie, $700,000 per month for five months). The Standby Facility\u2019s maturity date was 30 December 2015.', '12\\u2003By way of background, the Standby Facility was executed to supersede an initial facility agreement executed on 21 July 2015 but backdated to 16 April 2015 (\u201cOriginal Facility\u201d). The Original Facility\u2019s maturity date was 15 June 2015. Under the Original Facility, the lenders were EFIII, VMIII and The Enterprise Fund II Ltd (\u201cEFII\u201d). Essentially, VMF3 replaced EFII as a lender under the Standby Facility. The Original Facility and Standby Facility shall be referred to collectively as the \u201cDisputed Facilities\u201d.', '13\\u2003The second facility granted on 17 June 2015 (\u201cGeelong Facility\u201d) provided a loan of $11.5m. The borrower under the Geelong Facility was IHC Medical Re. The lenders were EFIII and VMF3.', '14\\u2003The repayment of sums due under the Disputed Facilities and the Geelong Facility was secured by, amongst others, personal guarantees from Mr Fan and Mr Aathar, as well as charges granted by IHC over its shares in IHC Medical Re and two other subsidiaries (\u201cCharged Shares\u201d). The charges were granted by way of two Deeds of Share Charges dated 17 June 2015 (\u201cJune Charge Deed\u201d) and July 2015.', '15\\u2003The discussions on the Disputed Facilities began at a meeting between Mr Fan, Mr Aathar and Mr Tan on 3 April 2015. On the morning of 4 April 2015, Mr Aathar sent Mr Tan an email, copied to Mr Fan, with the subject stated as \u201cStandby Facility\u201d (\u201cMorning Email\u201d). The Morning Email merits being set out in full:', '16\\u2003On the afternoon of the same day, Mr Aathar sent another email to Mr Tan, copying Mr Fan, again with the subject stated as \u201cStandby Facility\u201d (\u201cAfternoon Email\u201d). Mr Aathar stated in the Afternoon Email that \u201c[he could] give [Mr Tan] a firm undertaking from IHC that all security arrangements [would] be restored and reinstated by IHC \u2026 to the satisfaction of Crest\u201d.', '17\\u2003Mr Aathar, Mr Fan and Mr Tan had further correspondence on 9 April about the \u201cStandby Facility\u201d. The exchange now included three additional individuals: Ms Lim, Mr Chia Kwok Ping (\u201cMr Chia\u201d), IHC\u2019s CEO at the time, and Mr Lim Chu Pei (\u201cMr CP Lim\u201d), an Investment Analyst with Crest Capital. The correspondence on 9 April included a term sheet dated 6 April 2015 (\u201cTerm Sheet\u201d), which was circulated to all six individuals. The Term Sheet provided that the facility provided would be secured, inter alia, by guarantees from Mr Aathar and Mr Fan, as well as a \u201c[p]ledge of IHC shares purchased through Fund\u201d. The term \u201cFund\u201d was not defined in the Term Sheet.', '18\\u2003On 10 April 2015, the Term Sheet was signed by Mr Chia as CEO of IHC and by Mr Aathar and Mr Fan as the two personal guarantors. This signed Term Sheet (without Mr Tan\u2019s signature) was sent to Mr Tan via email. Later the same day, Mr CP Lim sent the signed Term Sheet (now with Mr Tan\u2019s signature) to Mr Chia and Ms Lim, copying Mr Tan, Mr Aathar and Mr Fan.', '19\\u2003On 17 May 2015, Mr Fan was appointed Group CEO. Subsequently, he vetted a board paper prepared by Ms Lim. The board paper was dated 29 May 2015 and together with the necessary legal documents, was meant to be put before IHC\u2019s board of directors to obtain their approval for the Original Facility.', '20\\u2003On 29 May 2015, the board paper was circulated by email to IHC\u2019s board of directors. The covering email and the board paper stated that the Original Facility was to be \u201cutilised for general working capital\u201d and \u201c[f]or general working capital purpose[s]\u201d only. Further, the covering email and the board paper only listed the Charged Shares (see [14] above) and the guarantees from Mr Aathar and Mr Fan as securities. In other words, there was no mention of any pledge of the IHC shares to be purchased from the funds of the Original Facility. Board approval was obtained through a two-thirds majority on 3 June. One of the directors who approved the Original Facility was Dr Jong Hee Sen (\u201cDr Jong\u201d), IHC\u2019s Non-Executive Chairman at the time.', '21\\u2003The Original Facility agreement was then executed on 21 July 2015, but backdated to 16 April 2015. Subsequently, upon IHC\u2019s request, the Standby Facility agreement was executed on 30 July 2015, superseding the Original Facility agreement. The Standby Facility extended the duration of the credit facility to five months after the date of execution, ie, 29 December 2015. Dr Jong signed the documentation for the Original Facility and Standby Facility on behalf of IHC.', '22\\u2003According to the Crest Entities and the respondents, between 16 April and 24 August 2015, a total sum of approximately $17m was drawn down from the Standby Facility on fourteen separate occasions for the purchase of some 59m shares in IHC. The shares were purchased by EFIII but held in VMIII\u2019s name. Eight out of the fourteen drawdowns took place before the board paper was put to IHC\u2019s board of director for approval on 29 May. A further five drawdowns were made before the formal execution of the legal documentation for the Original Facility on 21 July. The drawdowns were made on Mr Aathar\u2019s instructions to Mr Tan.', '23\\u2003According to Mr Aathar, Mr Fan and Ms Lim, no drawdown occurred under any of the Disputed Facilities, and certainly not to purchase IHC shares on IHC\u2019s behalf. By their account, the Crest Entities spent the $17m on their own volition for their own purchase of the IHC shares (ie, as a proper and ordinary investment in shares). Any communications between Mr Aathar and Mr Tan merely involved the former providing advice (as opposed to instructions) to the latter.', '24\\u2003In September 2015, SGX announced that investors should exercise caution when dealing with IHC\u2019s shares because its investigations revealed some unusual trading activities of IHC shares. Subsequently, on 19 October 2015, Crest Capital demanded repayment of sums due under both the Standby and Geelong Facilities.', '25\\u2003As regards the Standby Facility, Crest Capital sent a letter of demand addressed to Dr Jong, copying Mr Fan and Mr Aathar. The letter of demand requested some $2.7m for standby fees due for the period between 16 June and 15 October 2015, and stated that a drawdown was made on 16 April 2015. However, there was no mention of the principal sum due.', '26\\u2003As regards the Geelong Facility, Crest Capital sent a letter of demand addressed to Ms Lim, copying Mr Fan and Mr Aathar. The letter of demand requested payment of some $11m, comprising the principal sum and the interest accruing.', '27\\u2003Negotiations over repayment then took place between Mr Tan, Mr Fan and Mr Aathar. The exchange of emails between the parties referred to \u201cmarket shares of $17.2m or 59.3m shares\u201d and likewise included discussions on the sum of $17m used to purchase the 59m IHC shares. No other IHC representatives appear to have been privy to these negotiations (see Judgment at [40]).', '28\\u2003In December 2015, IHC made two payments to the Crest Entities. The first was a sum of $3.5m which was applied towards the Geelong Facility (which IHC did not take issue with). The second was a $3.8m payment which was applied by the Crest Entities towards the Standby Facility. This second payment of $3.8m became a major area of contention between the parties, both below and on appeal. It would thus be useful to briefly explain the circumstances regarding this payment.', '29\\u2003On 17 December 2015, Mr CP Lim emailed Ms Lim setting out certain \u201cpayment details\u201d for IHC to follow-up on: IHC was to pay EFIII about $2.3m; VMIII, about $1m; and VMF3, about $500,000. In his email, Mr CP Lim did not identify which facility these sums were to be applied towards. That said, EFIII and VMFIII were lenders under both the Disputed Facilities and the Geelong Facility, while VMF3 was a lender only under the Standby Facility.', '30\\u2003Later the same day, IHC\u2019s employee replied to Mr CP Lim, saying \u201cAs spoken, we will pay $3,883,950 to [EFIII]\u201d. No mention was made of VMFIII and VMF3. The following day, 18 December 2015, IHC duly made the payment of $3.8m to EFIII. The payment was recorded in IHC\u2019s internal records as a payment for \u201csettled partial Geelong loan\u201d.', '31\\u2003On or about the same day, Ms Lim sent the following WhatsApp message to Mr Fan:', '32\\u2003On 23 December, Mr Peter Chan (\u201cMr Chan\u201d), Crest Capital\u2019s Managing Partner, emailed Mr Fan, copying Mr Tan and Mr CP Lim. In the email, Mr Chan referred to a meeting with Mr Fan that morning, and stated that:', '33\\u2003On that basis, the Crest Entities applied the $3.8m payment towards the Standby Facility. IHC took issue with the Crest Entities\u2019 appropriation of the $3.8 million payment, contending that it was always meant to be applied to the Geelong Facility, and not the Standby Facility.', '34\\u2003From February 2016, a flurry of correspondence took place between the finance teams of IHC and the Crest Entities. Generally, IHC denied having drawn down on the Standby Facility, and requested the Crest Entities to furnish evidence of the alleged drawdowns. In response, the Crest Entities asserted that drawdowns took place, but refused to provide particulars and instead stated that IHC should check with Mr Fan and Mr Aathar for the details.', '35\\u2003In April 2016, the Crest Entities\u2019 solicitors served letters of demand on IHC and IHC Medical Re for sums due under the Standby and Geelong Facilities. The claim under the Standby Facility was resisted by IHC. IHC also stated that the Crest entities had wrongly attributed the payment of $3.8m to the Standby Facility instead of the Geelong Facility, and asked the Crest Entities to rectify that error. IHC further stated that unless the Crest Entities did so, it would not be making any further repayment toward the Geelong Facility.', '36\\u2003The Crest Entities subsequently appointed receivers over the Charged Shares (\u201cCrest Receivers\u201d), thereby gaining control over IHC Medical Re and the Australian Properties.', '37\\u2003In April 2016, IHC commenced the Suit seeking to, inter alia, remove the Crest Receivers. In January 2017, IHC held an extraordinary general meeting in which the incumbent board (including Ms Lim) was removed. In June 2017, IHC changed its position and accepted that IHC shares were acquired for IHC on the instructions of Mr Aathar using the funds drawn down from the Standby Facility.', '38\\u2003The Australian Properties were subject to senior mortgages held by three Australian financial institutions. After the Crest Receivers were appointed in April 2016, the Australian Properties were placed in receivership (\u201cAustralian Receivers\u201d) in August 2016. The Australian Receivers eventually sold the Australian Properties.'"}
{"casename":"2021_SGCA_26","fact":"the facts\n71 The appellant argues that the Undertakings ([ 8] above) should be \nremoved as the appellant seeks liberty to commence enforcement proceedings \nagainst R1 in other jurisdictions for the Judgment Sum. According to the \naffidavits, the vast majority of R1\u2019s assets are located overseas, and the assets \nof R1 in Singapore are insufficient to satisfy the Judgment Sum. If the appellant \nis required to seek leave of court to commence enforcement proceedings and\/or \nenforce the Mareva injunction abroad, it will be seriously prejudiced as the need \nto seek such leave will result in further lengthy delays, during which R1 and R2 \nmay further dissipate their assets. Since the District Court of Zurich has already \ngranted the appellant\u2019s request to attach R2\u2019s assets and APF\u2019s assets to the \nJudgment Sum, the appellant seeks for the Undertakings to be removed so that \nit can proceed with enforcement proceedings against R2\u2019s assets elsewhere in \nthe world.\nVersion No 1: 26 Mar 2021 (13:10 hrs)\nJTrust Asia Pte Ltd v Group Lease Holdings Pte Ltd[2021] SGCA 26\n2672 On the other hand, R1 and R2 argue that they clearly intend to satisfy \nthe Judgment Sum in full and that there is no basis for the appellant to be \nreleased from the Undertakings and to be permitted to pursue foreign \nenforcement proceedings as this would incur unnecessary time and costs.\n73 In our view, there is presently no cogent and persuasive reason to release \nthe appellant from its Undertakings. It does not seem necessary to permit the \nappellant to commence foreign enforcement proceedings at the present time. R1 \nand R2 have evinced an intention to pay the Judgment Sum, as can be seen from \nthe fact that they have already paid more than half of the Judgment Sum, \nobtained leave to sell their BJI shares to cover the remaining debt, and have \nsought for the release of around US$10 million in Cyprus (which is currently \nfrozen by a Cypriot injunction obtained by the appellant) to satisfy the Judgment \nSum. Further, the Mareva injunctions in place would be adequate to safeguard \nthe appellant\u2019s interests. In any case, should the appellant wish to commence \nforeign enforcement proceedings, it is at liberty to file a fresh application for \nthe release of the Undertakings. In this way, the court will retain control over \nthe foreign enforcement proceedings which the appellant may seek to \ncommence in order to avoid oppression and the incurring of unnecessary time \nand costs, while allowing the appellant to proceed with enforcement where it is \nappropriate and meritorious to do so. \nConclusion\n74 We order that:\n(a) The reinstated Mareva injunctions be extended until the \nrespondents satisfy the Judgment Sum and costs.\nVersion No 1: 26 Mar 2021 (13:10 hrs)\nJTrust Asia Pte Ltd v Group Lease Holdings Pte Ltd[2021] SGCA 26\n27(b) The enjoined quantum of the Mareva injunctions be reduced to \nUS$50 million.\n(c) The appellant is to complete compiling its disbursements and \nnotify the respondents of its costs for the High Court Trial within two \nweeks.\n(d) R1 and R2 are to file a fresh affidavit within three weeks to \ndisclose assets up to the value of US$100 million, unless the Judgment \nSum and costs are paid up by then.

Nevertheless, for present purposes, we briefly summarise this \nprocess.\n7 To begin, the HSA analyst uses a weighing device to determine the gross \nweight of the compressed block. The analyst will then prise apart the \ncompressed block and conduct a macroscopic (meaning visual) examination of \nall its components. The analyst takes note of: (a) the colour; (b) the presence of \ndifferent plant parts (such as cannabis stalks or stems, leaves, flowering \nbranches, fruiting branches, flowers and fruits); (c) the uniformity of the type of \nplant material; and (d) the presence of non-cannabis plant material. Based on \nthe macroscopic examination, the analyst then separates the components into \nthree different groups: (a) individual plant branches (\u201cGroup 1\u201d); (b) fragments \nof plant parts (\u201cGroup 2\u201d); and (c) observable extraneous matter (\u201cGroup 3\u201d). \nVersion No 1: 30 Mar 2021 (11:56 hrs)\nAbdul Karim bin Mohamed Kuppai Khan v PP[2021] SGCA 27\n5Indicia for determining whether any given vegetable matter falls within each \ngroup, under macroscopic examination, are set out in the table below:\nGroup 1\nIndividual plant \nbranchesGroup 2\nFragments of plant \npartsGroup 3\nObservable \nextraneous matter\nMust be at least 2cm \nin lengthIncludes bare branches \nwith no leaves, flowers \nor fruits attached.Includes non-\ncannabis vegetable \nmatter\nIncludes detached \nleaves, flowers or \nfruits\nEach fragment is \ntypically between 2cm \nand 0.5mm in lengthPossesses sufficient \nbotanical features of \ncannabis to meet the \ncriteria for cannabis \nunder the \nmacroscopic \nexamination\nMay possess some \nbotanical features, but \nthese are insufficient \nto meet the criteria for \ncannabis under the \nmacroscopic \nexamination.Includes non-\nvegetable matter \nsuch as strings and \npaper\n8 Once the plant matter has been separated into the three groups, the \nanalyst will record the weight of each group. After completing the macroscopic \nexamination, the analyst then conducts a microscopic examination in order to \nestablish the presence of the characteristic botanical features of cannabis. These \ninclude: (a) the bear claw-shaped unicellular trichomes (trichomes are \noutgrowth akin to hairs) on the upper surface of leaves; (b) long slender \nunicellular trichomes on the lower surface of leaves; (c) multicellular stalked \nglandular trichomes and long curved unicellular trichomes on the outer surface \nof bracts or female flowers; (d) long unicellular upwards-pointing trichomes on \nVersion No 1: 30 Mar 2021 (11:56 hrs)\nAbdul Karim bin Mohamed Kuppai Khan v PP[2021] SGCA 27\n6stems; and (e) reticulate (meaning marked like a network) patterns on fruits.

The \nanalyst subtracts the weight \nof extraneous matter from \nGroup 2.\n9 Following both the macroscopic and the microscopic examinations, the \nanalyst then conducts two chromatography tests: (a) Thin Layer \nChromatography; and (b) Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry. These tests \nare used to determine the presence of cannabinol (\u201cCBN\u201d) and \ntetrahydrocannabinol (a cannabinol derivative) (\u201cTHC\u201d), which are the \nchemical markers for cannabis.

To recap, the testing \nprocedure results in three groups of material emanating from a \nsingle compressed block of cannabis-related plant material: \n(a) material that can be identified and certified as cannabis; \n(b) fragmented vegetable matter that cannot be certified as \ncannabis, but with THC and CBN detected therein; and \n(c) observable extraneous matter that is discarded and \ndisregarded (see [64] above). According to Dr Yap, the HSA in \neffect creates some part of the fragmented vegetable matter in \nthe second group of plant material through its testing \nprocedure when the HSA analyst inevitably, although often \nintentionally, breaks some of the cannabis plant parts. As a \nresult, the contents of the block at the time it is analysed and \nhandled by the HSA during and after testing will be different \nfrom the contents of the block at the time of trafficking, \nimportation or exportation. This can be illustrated by the \nfollowing diagram:\nThe shaded portion in the \u2018After\u2019 diagram represents vegetable \nfragments that were created as a result of the HSA\u2019s testing \nprocedure (\u2018Created Fragmented Vegetable Matter\u2019). A \nconsequence of generating such Created Fragmented Vegetable \nMatter is that it gives rise to difficulties in bringing a charge \npertaining to cannabis mixture in respect of such matter \nVersion No 1: 30 Mar 2021 (11:56 hrs)\nAbdul Karim bin Mohamed Kuppai Khan v PP[2021] SGCA 27\n8because it did not exist as cannabis mixture at the time of \ntrafficking, importation or exportation.\n11 There are three characteristics of Created Fragmented Vegetable Matter \nthat have a bearing on the legal permissibility of the Dual Charging Practice. \nFirst, some Created Fragmented Vegetable Matter includes what may have been \nGroup 1 material that becomes Group 2 material by reason of the HSA\u2019s act of \nprising apart the compressed block of cannabis-related plant material. Any such \nmaterial would not have existed as Group 2 material at the time of the offence. \nSecond, Created Fragmented Vegetable Matter cannot be precisely quantified \nby the HSA because it is impossible for the HSA to tell how much of the Group \n2 material was already in that form and how much of it came into being as a \nresult of the HSA\u2019s actions. Third, and perhaps most significantly, Created \nFragmented Vegetable Matter does not possess the characteristics necessary to \nbe certified as \u201ccannabis\u201d by the HSA because \u201cthe HSA currently certifies as \ncannabis only plant branches that are at least 2cm in length and that have \nsufficient leaves, flowers or fruits attached to them\u201d (Saravanan at [80]), and \ntherefore such matter cannot be certified as \u201ccannabis\u201d under s 2 of the MDA.\nOur decision in Saravanan\n12 We turn now to the aspects of our reasoning in Saravanan relevant to \nthe present"}
{"casename":"2021_SGCA_28","fact":"'3\\u2003We begin by setting out some of the material background facts. In 1994, the Parents had purchased an HDB flat in Choa Chu Kang (\u201cthe CCK Flat\u201d) in their joint names. In 2007, there was some discussion surrounding the purchase of a flat in Silat Walk (\u201cthe Silat Flat\u201d) and the sale of the CCK Flat. That same year, the CCK Flat was sold. On 26 September 2007, the Son obtained the HDB\u2019s approval for him to purchase the Silat Flat, which he then did in his sole name. In 2012, the Silat Flat was compulsorily acquired by the Government under the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme (\u201cSERS\u201d). The total compensation of $160,400.00 for this acquisition was paid out as follows: (a) an advance of $25,000.00; (b) a contra for the purchase of a new flat (\u201cthe SERS Contra\u201d) to the value of $27,269.55; and (c) a cheque for the balance of $108,130.45.', '4\\u2003The Kim Tian Flat was purchased in 2011 by the Son in his sole name. The SERS Contra was applied towards the initial payment of the Kim Tian Flat, another $7,935 was funded from his Central Provident Fund (\u201cCPF\u201d) account, and the balance of $264,500 was funded by a loan in the Son\u2019s name, which was serviced by funds from his CPF account.', '5\\u2003The Son had married the Wife in 2010 and they divorced in 2016, with final judgment granted in 2018. This dispute arose in the context of the Son\u2019s divorce from the Wife. In the divorce proceedings, after the Son\u2019s failure to comply with certain court orders, the Wife obtained an order for the sale of the Kim Tian Flat. Shortly thereafter, the Parents commenced the action that has led to this appeal.'"}
{"casename":"2021_SGCA_29","fact":"'2\\u2003The appellant had been convicted on two charges for trafficking in diamorphine under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed). He was sentenced to the death penalty on 4 February 2015. The appeal against his conviction and sentence, as well as a criminal motion filed to reopen his appeal, were dismissed. Following the conclusion of those proceedings, the respondent filed Originating Summons No 1378 of 2018, seeking the Confiscation Order and other related orders against the appellant. The Judge granted the orders sought by the respondent.', '3\\u2003In reaching the quantum of the Confiscation Order, the Judge agreed with the following findings contained in a financial statement annexed to an affidavit of Senior Staff Sergeant Lim Mei Wah (\u201cFinancial Statement\u201d):', '(a)\\u2003The appellant\u2019s net worth as at 1 March 2005 was $10,568.55, that date being the day on which he was released after serving 10 years of preventive detention.', '(b)\\u2003On 6 July 2010 (the date of his arrest), his net worth was $278,547.77, consisting of:', '(c)\\u2003Between 1 March 2005 and 6 July 2010 (\u201cthe relevant period\u201d), the appellant\u2019s total expenditure was $92,814.86.', '(d)\\u2003During the relevant period, the appellant\u2019s increase in net worth was therefore $360,794.08, being the sum of $278,547.77 and $92,814.86, less $10,568.55.', '(e)\\u2003However, the appellant\u2019s known sources of income during the relevant period amounted to only $193,364.57.', '(f)\\u2003There was therefore a sum of $167,429.51 ($360,794.08 less $193,364.57) disproportionate to his known sources of income.', '4\\u2003As for the realisation of property to satisfy the Confiscation Order, the Judge held that the sum of $60,000 in Mdm Bibah\u2019s bank account was not part of the appellant\u2019s realisable property under s 2(1) of the CDSA. The Judge found that the sum was not held by the appellant himself at the time of the hearing and thus, the respondent had to show that it fell within the second category of \u201crealisable property\u201d under s 2(1), ie, it had to be \u201cproperty held by a person to whom the defendant has, directly or indirectly, made a gift caught by [the CDSA]\u201d. The respondent argued at the hearing below that the sum was a gift from the appellant to Mdm Bibah and that this gift was caught under s 12(7)(b) of the CDSA. However, s 12(7)(b) of the CDSA applied only if the gift was of property \u201cwhich is or is part of the benefits derived by the [appellant] from drug dealing\u201d. The Judge held that there was insufficient evidence that the $60,000 constituted benefits derived by the appellant from his drug dealing activities. The respondent had therefore failed to establish that the sum was or was part of the \u201cbenefits derived by the [appellant] from drug dealing\u201d in order to constitute a \u201cgift\u201d under s 12(7)(b). As the respondent did not rely on s 12(7)(a) of the CDSA, the Judge did not come to a conclusion on whether the sum would have been considered a gift under that provision.', '5\\u2003In any event, the respondent confirmed that it was not seeking to realise that sum of $60,000 in Mdm Bibah\u2019s bank account to satisfy the Confiscation Order, as the appellant had sufficient balance sums to satisfy the order. The Judge therefore ordered that the full value of the benefits of $167,429.51 be recovered under the Confiscation Order.', '6\\u2003Against these findings, the appellant made two key arguments in this appeal. First, he argued that he had additional sources of income which should have been taken into account in the calculation of his known sources of income for the relevant period. Second, he argued that the sum of $60,000 which was in his mother\u2019s bank account belonged to her and should be returned to her. In relation to the second argument, it should be emphasised that the respondent would not in fact be using this sum of money to satisfy the Confiscation Order. Nevertheless, the argument remains relevant to the appeal in so far as it impacts the calculation of the appellant\u2019s net worth as of 6 July 2010. If the appellant\u2019s arguments were found to be meritorious, the sum of money assessed to have been derived by him from drug trafficking, and consequentially the quantum of the Confiscation Order, would be reduced.', '7\\u2003The respondent submitted that the Judge did not err in finding that the appellant\u2019s income from known sources over the relevant period amounted to $193,364.57 and that the sum of $60,000 in Mdm Bibah\u2019s bank account came from the appellant. The respondent further argued that the sum of $60,000 should have been considered part of the appellant\u2019s realisable property.'"}

The Indian man told the Applicant that there were two packets in a red plastic bag in the front basket of a motorcycle bearing registration plate number JJS 2021 which was parked in the vicinity, and three more packets stuffed under its seat. The Applicant retrieved the three packets from under the seat and placed them with the two other packets. He then contacted Christeen d\/o Jayamany (\u201cChristeen\u201d) and arranged to meet her at Depot Close. The Applicant travelled there on JJS 2021 and met Christeen. Christeen passed him a brown sling bag, and the Applicant placed something red into the sling bag and returned it to Christeen. They then parted ways. Officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau arrested both of them. A red plastic bag containing five packets of brown granular substance was retrieved from the sling bag.

Instead, on 1 February 2019, the appellant wrote a letter (\u201cResignation Letter\u201d) to the respondent and CCC, stating that he thereby resigned as trustee with immediate effect, and that his resignation was prompted by his inability to effectively discharge his duties as a trustee due to certain areas of concern. The appellant set out these areas of concern in the Resignation Letter and, in particular, cited a disagreement concerning a certain fund transfer which had allegedly happened without his authorisation.', '8\\u2003On 19 February 2019, the respondent\u2019s solicitors replied, asserting that the appellant was still a trustee and would remain so until a proper deed of retirement was executed. On 22 February 2019, the appellant replied contesting this; he cited an express provision in the Will which he claimed allowed him to resign without a deed of retirement, and also cited the example of CFC who had retired without such a deed. The portion of the Will (cl 3) cited by the appellant states:', '9\\u2003On 6 March 2019, the respondent executed the Draft Deed, even though the appellant had yet to give his consent. About two months later, in May 2019, the respondent\u2019s solicitors informed the appellant that CFC had signed a Deed of Retirement and Confirmation (\u201cConfirmation Deed\u201d) on 25 April 2019, which confirmed that he had retired as a trustee with effect from March 2009. The respondent\u2019s solicitors also attached the Confirmation Deed which had been executed by CFC, CCC, and the respondent. They requested the appellant to sign the Draft Deed and the Confirmation Deed (collectively, \u201cthe Deeds\u201d), When the appellant refused, the respondent filed OS 703, asking the court to order the appellant to sign the Deeds.'"}
{"casename":"2021_SGCA_34","fact":"'5\\u2003Pursuant to a letter of award dated 19 April 2017 (\u201cthe Contract\u201d), Range was appointed as Goldbell\u2019s contractor for the design and erection of a six-storey single-user workshop with an ancillary office (\u201cthe Project\u201d). The Contract incorporated the Real Estate Developers\u2019 Association of Singapore Design and Build Conditions of Main Contract (3rd Ed, July 2013) (\u201cthe Conditions\u201d). Clause 19 of the Conditions provided for the payment of liquidated damages in the event that the Contractor (ie, Range) failed to complete the Project on time. In particular, cl 19.1 (read with Appendix 1) set out the rate at which liquidated damages would be payable while cl 19.2 stipulated that the Employer (ie, Goldbell) could deduct the amount of liquidated damages payable from any moneys due, or to become due, to the Contractor (ie, Range) under the Contract.', '6\\u2003The contractual completion date was originally 31 August 2018 but was subsequently extended to 7 September 2018. The Temporary Occupation Permit (\u201cTOP\u201d) was granted on 2 October 2018.', '7\\u2003On 2 December 2019, Range served a payment claim (\u201cPC 28\u201d) on Goldbell. Goldbell submitted its payment response (\u201cPR 1\u201d) on 20 December 2019. Thereafter, Range lodged AA8 and submitted claims totalling $2,445,225.58. The Adjudicator issued the AD and awarded Range $205,647.43, which sum was arrived at after deducting $852,000 in liquidated damages that he found to be payable by Range to Goldbell.', '8\\u2003Per cl 19.1 of the Conditions, if Range failed to complete the Project by the extended contractual date of completion (ie, 7 September 2018), liquidated damages of $12,000 per day would be payable by Range to Goldbell for each day that elapsed between the extended contractual date of completion and the date of issuance of the Handing Over Certificate (\u201cHOC\u201d). The HOC was therefore critical in determining the amount of liquidated damages payable by Range to Goldbell. Goldbell had not issued the HOC at the time of the adjudication proceedings and has still not issued the HOC to date.', '9\\u2003The Adjudicator found that Goldbell ought to have issued the HOC by the time of the adjudication proceedings. However, as it was common ground between the parties that he was not required to find the exact date of completion of the Project or the exact date when the Project could be considered as having been handed over, he made no finding as to when the HOC ought to have been issued. The Adjudicator also found that, since the issuance of the HOC was not a pre-condition for awarding liquidated damages, Goldbell was entitled to liquidated damages notwithstanding its failure to issue the HOC.', '10\\u2003The Adjudicator then had to quantify the liquidated damages payable by Range to Goldbell. He relied on an e-mail dated 17 November 2018 (\u201cthe 17 November e-mail\u201d) in which Range\u2019s managing director had stated that \u201cL3, L5 and Roof are ongoing and will be completed next week\u201d. The Adjudicator understood this e-mail to mean that, as of 17 November 2018, Range had not completed the Project and thus remained liable for liquidated damages. He therefore found Range to be liable for liquidated damages for the period from 8 September 2018 (ie, the day after the extended contractual completion date) to 17 November 2018. While the Adjudicator also made various findings on Range\u2019s claim for variation works, it is unnecessary for us to address those findings for the purposes of this appeal.'"}

{"casename":"2021_SGCA_37","fact":"'2\\u2003The brief facts of the case are as follows. The appellants are Mr Toki, his wife Ms Phua and a Singapore-incorporated security consultancy and ship management company of which they are the only directors and shareholders, Vessel Offshore Management Pte Ltd, which we shall refer to hereinafter as \u201cVOM\u201d. The respondents are Ms Rewi and her husband, Mr Leauga. On 1 August 2010, Mr Toki, Ms Phua and the respondents entered into a partnership with Mr Toki and Ms Phua having a 60% share therein and the respondents the remaining 40%. Pursuant to the partnership agreement, the partnership purchased a vessel, the MV Ngati Haka, which we shall refer to hereinafter as the \u201cVessel\u201d.', '3\\u2003It is not disputed that the partners agreed to have VOM manage the Vessel for a fee and to charter out the Vessel for profit. The relationship between Mr Toki and Ms Phua on the one hand, and Ms Rewi and Mr Leauga on the other, broke down subsequently. This culminated in the dissolution of the partnership by mutual agreement on 8 October 2013. The partners agreed to place the Vessel for sale on the open market. On 31 January 2014, VOM obtained a valuation report from Industrial & Maritime Surveyors Limited, a Kenyan ship and boat valuation firm, which valued the Vessel at US$845,000. We shall hereinafter refer to this valuation as the \u201cIMSL Valuation\u201d.', '4\\u2003On 17 September 2014, Mr Toki\u2019s shipbroker, Mr John Hughes (\u201cMr Hughes\u201d) of John Hughes Associates, informed Mr Daniel Tan (\u201cMr Tan\u201d) of VOM of \u201cenquiries from West Africa\u201d to purchase the Vessel, expressing concerns that Mr Toki\u2019s asking price of US$2.2m was too high. Mr Tan asked Mr Hughes to advise if a reduction of the asking price of US$0.2m to US$0.3m would suffice. On 22 September 2014, Mr Hughes responded that the enquirers were Nigerian, and that they had offered US$1.2m for the Vessel. Mr Tan then informed Mr Hughes that he had reported the offer to Mr Toki and asked Mr Hughes to identify the Nigerian enquirers. Mr Hughes responded on 23 September 2014 that he was working with Mr Anthony Okonkwo (\u201cMr Okonkwo\u201d) of Bastion Kinetics. That same day, Mr Toki rejected Mr Okonkwo\u2019s US$1.2m offer, informing Mr Hughes that it was \u201ca bit steep off the mark\u201d from his asking price of US$2.2m, and that he was willing to lower his asking price to US$1.8m for serious negotiations to continue. The offer fell through.', '5\\u2003The value of the Vessel continued to fall, and in September 2016, Mr Toki further reduced his asking price for the Vessel to US$1.5m in view of the adverse market conditions. On 14 June 2017, VOM obtained a valuation of the Vessel at US$280,000 from SingClass International Pte Ltd.', '6\\u2003While the sale of the Vessel was being explored, and notwithstanding the dissolution of the partnership, VOM continued to manage and operate the Vessel and charter it out for profit.', '7\\u2003On 1 September 2017, the Vessel was sold for US$790,000. Ms Rewi and Mr Leauga agreed to the sale but reserved their rights as to the price. They refused to accept a cheque from the Tokis dated 8 January 2018 for their share of the proceeds from the dissolution of the partnership and commenced legal action against Mr Toki and Ms Phua for breach of their partnership duties.', '8\\u2003At the heart of the dispute in general and this appeal in particular is the question of whether Mr Toki and Ms Phua breached their duties as partners in failing to accept the US$1.2m offer for the Vessel so as to wind up the affairs of the partnership and distribute any surplus to the partners, and whether the final accounts of the partnership ought to have been drawn up on the basis that, first, the Vessel was sold for US$1.2m and not US$790,000, and second, that the Vessel was not chartered out after the dissolution of the partnership.', '9\\u2003On this issue, the Judge found that Mr Toki and Ms Phua had indeed breached their duty to wind up the partnership by failing to accept the US$1.2m offer for the Vessel, because at the time the Vessel was valued at US$845,000 and there was no credible reason for Mr Toki and Ms Phua to hold out for a price closer to US$1.8m. They also had not consulted Ms Rewi and Mr Leauga before rejecting the US$1.2m offer and for insisting on a much higher price.', '10\\u2003The Judge also took the view that the reason for Mr Toki\u2019s and Ms Phua\u2019s holding out for a high price of US$1.8m for the Vessel was their belief that they could personally stand to gain more from continuing to charter the Vessel out from the charter fees as well as from the management fees and fees for security services charged by VOM. However, they were not entitled to do so without the consent of Ms Rewi and Mr Leauga since the partners had agreed to dissolve the partnership and sell the Vessel. The Judge therefore ordered the final accounts of the partnership to be drawn up on the basis that the Vessel was sold for US$1.2m and that the Vessel was not chartered out after the partnership had been dissolved.', '11\\u2003In this appeal, the appellants do not dispute the Judge\u2019s finding that they did not have the authority to charter the Vessel out after the partnership had been dissolved. There is therefore only one issue that we have to deal with, and that is the question of whether Mr Toki and Ms Phua had breached their duty to sell the Vessel by failing to accept the US$1.2m offer and the consequential adjustments to the final accounts of the partnership that would follow in such an eventuality.'"}

The coal from Australia was to be delivered in two tranches: the first 30,000 MT to be delivered in December 2014 and the second 20,000 MT to be delivered in January 2015. This came to be recorded in two separate sale and purchase agreements for the respective tranches. We refer to these as \u201cthe First Agreement\u201d and \u201cthe Second Agreement\u201d. Both agreements were executed on 7 January 2015 but backdated to 24 November 2014 and 20 December 2014 respectively.', '4\\u2003Both agreements contained an arbitration clause which stipulated arbitration under the Rules of the Singapore Chamber of Maritime Arbitration (3rd Edition, 2015) (\u201cSCMA Rules\u201d) in the event of a dispute:', '5\\u2003As is not unusual in these cases, sometime earlier, on or around 8 October 2014, the Seller had entered into an Accounts Receivable Purchase Facility with the Bank. The facility agreement provided for the assignment of the Seller\u2019s trade debts to the Bank. Pursuant to this facility agreement, the Seller wrote to the Buyer on 19 January 2015 that it had assigned all of its trade debts so that \u201call amounts due both now and in the future, in respect of invoices, must be paid only to [the Bank]\u201d. The Second Agreement contains an assignment clause, cl 22, which provides as follows:', '6\\u2003The first tranche of 30,000 MT of coal was duly delivered by the Seller to the Buyer in India and there are no disputes over this shipment. The dispute arises over the delivery of the second shipment of coal. This 20,000 MT of coal was shipped by the Seller to the Buyer on 21 December 2014.', '7\\u2003On 22 January 2015, the Bank sent a bill of exchange drawn by the Seller to the Buyer for the payment of US$1,480,400 by 22 June 2015 (\u201cthe Bill of Exchange\u201d). 1', 'On 12 February 2015, the Buyer\u2019s bank sent a \u201cSWIFT\u201d message to the Bank stating unequivocally that the Buyer \u201chas accepted the [Bill of Exchange] and will make payment on due date\u201d (\u201cthe SWIFT message\u201d). 2', 'The SWIFT message also made clear that the \u201cAmt Accepted\u201d was US$1,480,400. It appears this Bill of Exchange was never given to the Bank as it did not feature in its claim against the Buyer.', '8\\u2003The Buyer contends that upon arrival of the coal on 14 January 2015 at Gangavaram, India, it was unable to lift 5,000 MT of coal from the port because the Seller had only procured the issuance of delivery orders for 15,000 MT of coal. 3', 'The Buyer failed to make any payment on the Bill of Exchange by', '22 June 2015. Between 6 July 2015 and 20 October 2015, the Bank sent a number of emails to the Buyer seeking payment. The Buyer responded twice via email explaining that it was \u201ctrying [its] level best to arrange maximum funds so that [the] liabilities can be paid at the earliest\u201d and that the delay was the result of temporary cash flow issues. In the correspondence, the Buyer also alluded to the unfavourable market conditions which had apparently softened demand for the Buyer\u2019s finished goods and depressed its prices. 4', '9\\u2003However, sometime in October 2015, in a notable volte-face from its foregoing admissions of debt, the Buyer raised two issues in an email to the Bank. First, as mentioned earlier, the Buyer averred that only 15,000 MT of the 20,000 MT of coal had been supplied to it and that it had to procure the remainder from elsewhere. Secondly, the Buyer stated that there had been a \u201csteep decline in the prices of coal\u201d and that it was \u201cnot inclined\u201d to pay the US$74 per MT under the Second Agreement. 5', 'Instead, it offered to bear some of the price fluctuation and pay US$61 per MT.', '10\\u2003It is not disputed that on 2 December 2015 the Seller met with the Buyer\u2019s representatives to discuss the outstanding payment and the alleged shortfall in delivery (\u201cthe December 2015 meeting\u201d). The Buyer alleges it had four representatives and the Seller had two representatives who were accompanied by a third person from a trade credit entity. However, what transpired at that meeting is disputed.', '11\\u2003According to the Buyer, the parties reached an oral agreement for the global settlement of their disputes during the December 2015 meeting. Specifically, both parties agreed that the price of the coal would be revised to US$61 per MT for all 50,000 MT of coal contracted under the two sale and purchase agreements; however, the Seller refused to honour this agreement. Whilst the Seller does not dispute that the December 2015 meeting took place, it contends that they did not agree to any new price at the meeting. 6', '12\\u2003On 21 October 2016, not having received any payment, the Bank commenced arbitration against the Buyer claiming the outstanding sum of US$1,480,400 and interest. A sole arbitrator was appointed on 25 April 2017 under the SCMA Rules.', '13\\u2003The Buyer raised a jurisdictional objection to the arbitration on the basis that there was no arbitration agreement between it and the Bank because the Seller\u2019s assignment was only for its receivables. This was heard by the arbitrator as a preliminary issue and on 6 December 2017 the arbitrator issued a partial award concluding that the assignment of receivables by the Seller included the assignment of the entire Second Agreement including the arbitration clause (\u201cthe Partial Award\u201d). The arbitrator therefore found that he had jurisdiction over the dispute.', '14\\u2003After the issuance of the Partial Award, the Buyer was directed to file its defence to the Bank\u2019s statement of case by 8 January 2018. It failed to do so. On 9 January 2018, the arbitrator stated that unless he was otherwise advised, he would \u201cconclude that [the Buyer] has elected not to file a Defence and\/or Counterclaim and the arbitration will proceed accordingly\u201d. The Buyer replied stating that it was challenging the Partial Award in the Indian courts and requested that the arbitrator await the outcome of that challenge before proceeding. 7', '15\\u2003On 16 March 2018, shortly before the scheduled final oral hearing, the Buyer suddenly informed the arbitrator that it intended to contest the claim on its merits, albeit under protest as to his jurisdiction, and asked for eight weeks to file its statement of defence. 8', 'On 20 March 2018, the arbitrator granted the Buyer 14 calendar days to file its defence and counterclaim together with a list of witnesses, if any. Notably, the arbitrator directed in his email that: 9', '16\\u2003On 8 April 2018, one day before the Buyer\u2019s pleadings were due, it sought a further extension. The arbitrator denied the Buyer\u2019s request but allowed an extension for the submission of the Buyer\u2019s list of witnesses. On', '10 April 2018, the Buyer submitted its defence and counterclaim, which was entitled \u201creply on merits\u201d, along with a list of seven named witnesses. Six of the witnesses were persons which the Buyer claimed were present at the December 2015 meeting where, according to the Buyer, the parties had agreed to a reduction of the coal price for the entire 50,000 MT of coal from US$74 per MT to US$61 per MT. Furthermore, the Buyer claimed in its pleadings that the Seller had failed to deliver 5,000 MT of coal and thus, the Buyer counterclaimed for the cost of procuring that balance from the open market.', '17\\u2003Once the Buyer\u2019s \u201creply on merits\u201d was submitted, the parties were, as directed, to consider whether an oral hearing was necessary. As shall be seen, the particular question of whether the Buyer\u2019s witnesses should be permitted to give oral testimony at a hearing formed the crux of the setting aside application below and the appeal before us.', '18\\u2003The Bank filed its reply and defence to the Buyer\u2019s \u201creply on merits\u201d on 24 April 2018. In its cover email, the Bank informed the arbitrator that it did not intend to call any witnesses or submit any witness statements. The Bank provided a list of reasons for this, which included its view that the dispute turned \u201cprimarily on the contractual interpretation\u201d of the Second Agreement and that the Buyer had not explained its reasons for calling the seven witnesses in its list. Therefore, the Bank submitted that the arbitration should proceed on a documents-only basis. Alternatively, if an oral hearing was necessary, a hearing could be held for oral submissions only \u2013 as opposed to the taking of oral evidence from witnesses. This, according to the Bank, was in accordance with r 28.1 of the SCMA Rules, which is the key provision in dispute in the present appeal.', '19\\u2003Following the Bank\u2019s indications, the arbitrator requested that the Buyer provide \u201cits position\/reasons for calling the 7 witnesses and\/or the need for their oral testimony\u201d. On 7 May 2018, the Buyer replied stating simply that an oral hearing was \u201crequired and necessary\u201d as it had submitted in the SCMA Questionnaire attached to the same email. However, the Questionnaire was found by the arbitrator to be lacking in detail (see also below at [72]).', '20\\u2003Dissatisfied with the Buyer\u2019s answers, the arbitrator again sought, on', '8 May 2018, a \u201cdescriptive basis of what [the Buyer] expects to develop with the introduction of the proposed witnesses\u201d. 10', 'In its response on 11 May 2018, the Buyer re-asserted the \u201cnecessity of examining the witnesses\u201d because \u201cthe case does not solely turn on the documents [sic] interpretation\u201d as had been submitted by the Bank. 11', '21\\u2003On 1 June 2018, the arbitrator wrote to parties directing as follows:', 'This direction set off a chain of correspondence concerning the modalities of the hearing.', '22\\u2003The Buyer replied on the same day, stating that it was a breach of the rules of natural justice for the arbitrator to require it to submit witness statements before he decided whether to hold an oral hearing. It also highlighted that some of the witnesses on its list were representatives of the Seller and reiterated the necessity for it to cross-examine the witnesses.', '23\\u2003On 4 June 2018, the arbitrator replied to the Buyer\u2019s email assuring parties that he had not made any decisions on whether a hearing ought to be held and if so, what form it should take on. The arbitrator also highlighted that pursuant to r 33.1(c) of the SCMA Rules, he had the authority to \u201cconduct such enquiries as may appear to the Tribunal to be necessary or expedient\u201d.', '24\\u2003In its response, the Buyer replied on 6 June 2018 stating that the calling of witnesses was within its entitlement under r 28.1 of the SCMA Rules, which provides that an arbitrator \u201cshall hold a hearing for the presentation of evidence by witnesses, including expert witnesses, or for oral submissions\u201d [emphasis added] unless parties have agreed to a documents-only arbitration. The Buyer also stated that r 33.1(c) did not allow the arbitrator to negate its right to call witnesses at a hearing.', '25\\u2003On 7 June 2018, the arbitrator replied denying the Buyer\u2019s request to dispense with the detailed witness statements, stating that his instructions of', '1 June 2018 remained. Nearly a month later, on 4 July 2018, the arbitrator wrote to both counsel, repeating his request for the witness statements from the Buyer and a brief of what constitutes breach of natural justice under Singapore law. Importantly, he stated that if the Buyer still did not submit its witness statements, it would be taken as having waived \u201cany right to submit witnesses in the event of an oral hearing\u201d. 12', '26\\u2003On 16 July 2018, the Buyer reiterated its earlier position that it was entitled to call its witnesses to give oral evidence notwithstanding the lack of written statements for each witness.', '27\\u2003Finally, on 20 July 2018, the arbitrator directed that since parties have not agreed to a documents-only arbitration, pursuant to r 28.1 of the SCMA Rules, a hearing would be held on 21 August 2018 for oral submissions only. 13', 'The arbitrator stated that there would be no witnesses presented at the hearing because the Buyer had \u201cfailed to provide witness statements or any evidence of the substantive value of presenting witnesses\u201d. It is this specific direction barring all of the Buyer\u2019s witness testimony that forms the foundation of the Buyer\u2019s setting aside application on the ground of breach of natural justice. In addition, the arbitrator stated that the Buyer\u2019s counterclaim on the 5,000 MT of purportedly undelivered coal would not be heard since it had failed to deposit the necessary funds with the SCMA.', '28\\u2003A day before the scheduled hearing for oral submissions, the Buyer wrote to the arbitrator to reiterate that the denial of witness examination was \u201ca violation of [the] principles of natural justice and also against the principles of [a] full and fair hearing.\u201d 14', 'It asserted that the hearing would be a \u201cmere formality\u201d and alleged that the arbitrator had pre-judged the matter. Thus, the Buyer considered that \u201cno fruitful purpose [was] served\u201d by its participation in the scheduled hearing. 15', 'In response, the arbitrator stated that he had not made up his mind on the matter.', '29\\u2003On 21 August 2018, the arbitrator conducted the hearing via telephone. The Buyer did not join the call and no witness testimony was given. The arbitrator allowed the Bank to make its oral submissions. As noted by the arbitrator in his Final Award, no new or additional documents, evidence or submissions were presented by the Bank.', '30\\u2003The Final Award was issued on 16 November 2018. The arbitrator allowed the Bank\u2019s claim for the US$1,480,400 under the Second Agreement as well as interest. The Buyer\u2019s counterclaim for 5,000 MT of alleged undelivered coal was dismissed. The arbitrator addressed, inter alia, two main issues: (a) whether the contracted quantity and quality of coal had been delivered pursuant to the Second Agreement; and (b) whether there was a subsequent agreement for a price adjustment as alleged by the Buyer.', '31\\u2003The arbitrator found that 20,000 MT of coal had been delivered by the Seller and this was supported by the documentary evidence. In contrast, there was no documentation presented by the Buyer evidencing the alleged shortfall of 5,000 MT of coal. Further, the arbitrator dismissed the suggestion that there had been a subsequent agreement to lower the price of the coal. The arbitrator noted that the first tranche of 30,000 MT of coal had been duly delivered and paid for, and there was no written evidence that the Buyer or the Seller intended to change this price during the December 2015 meeting. This was bolstered by the clear admissions by the Buyer and its bank that they would satisfy the debt claims (see [7]\u2013[8] above). Cll 19 (which required all amendments to be in writing and signed by the representatives of the Buyer and the Seller) and 20 (an entire agreement clause which similarly required variations to be written and signed by authorised agents of both parties) of the Second Agreement also militated against the formation of a subsequent oral agreement. There was no evidence that these formalities had been complied with.'"}
{"casename":"2021_SGCA_40","fact":"'4\\u2003The appellant, Skyventure VWT Singapore Pte Ltd, owns and operates \u201ciFly Singapore\u201d, a tourist attraction at No 43 Siloso Beach Walk #01-01 and #03-01, Singapore 099010 (\u201cthe Property\u201d). It provides a simulated skydiving experience for its guests.', '5\\u2003The Property consists of three vertical concrete columns bridged at the top and the base. In the middle of the central column lies the flight chamber where simulated skydiving activities take place. Within the top bridge are four wind turbines which have a combined strength of 1,800 horsepower. A \u201cprimary diffuser\u201d is situated between them. The wind turbines mechanically induce airflow in opposite directions and the airflow thus generated is directed downwards through the two side columns (termed \u201creturn air towers\u201d) towards the bottom bridge. Within the bottom bridge are water-cooled turning vents. These remove heat from the airflow and move air upwards towards the inlet contractor which resides directly below the flight chamber in the bottom half of the central column. The inlet contractor increases the pressure and velocity of the airflow to one that is suitable for simulated skydiving within the flight chamber. After passing through the flight chamber, the airflow enters the abovementioned primary diffuser where it is drawn into the wind turbines to be recirculated.', '6\\u2003The subject-matter of the present dispute is the \u201cWind Tunnel\u201d which, according to the appellant, consists of the wind turbines, the primary diffuser, the turning vents, the inlet contractor and the flight chamber described above.', '7\\u2003By two notices dated 22 December 2012, the respondents, who are the taxing authorities for property tax in Singapore, assessed the whole of the Property to property tax. This meant that the value of the Wind Tunnel was to be included in the computation of the Property\u2019s annual value (\u201cAV\u201d) for the purpose of determining the amount of property tax chargeable at 10% thereon.', '8\\u2003The appellant appealed the respondents\u2019 decision to the Valuation Review Board (\u201cthe VRB\u201d), contending inter alia that the value of the Wind Tunnel should not have been included in the respondents\u2019 assessment of the Property\u2019s AV as it was exempt machinery under s 2(2) of the Property Tax Act (Cap 254, 2005 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe Act\u201d). The respondents, on the other hand, took issue with the appellant\u2019s characterisation of the Wind Tunnel as \u201cmachinery\u201d, and also argued that even if it was \u201cmachinery\u201d, the Wind Tunnel did not fall within s 2(2) of the Act as that provision only applied to machinery used for \u201cmanufacturing, processing and other industrial purposes\u201d.', '9\\u2003On 10 April 2019, by a two-to-one majority, the VRB found in the appellant\u2019s favour. The majority of the VRB found, inter alia, that the Wind Tunnel was machinery since its predominant function was to generate the necessary aerodynamic conditions for indoor skydiving (see the VRB decision at [25]). For the same reason, the Wind Tunnel altered and adapted the air within it by increasing its velocity and pressure while reducing its temperature, such that the lifting effect of the cooled airflow could be sold. It was therefore machinery \u201cused for the purposes of making, altering, repairing or ornamenting, finishing or adapting for sale of articles\u201d and therefore fell within the scope of s 2(2) of the Act (see the VRB decision at [28]). Thus, the majority held that the enhanced value given to the Property by the Wind Tunnel ought to be excluded from the Property\u2019s AV. They therefore allowed the appeal.', '10\\u2003The minority disagreed, and penned a dissenting opinion which, while agreeing with the majority that the Wind Tunnel was \u201cmachinery\u201d (see the VRB decision at [57]), took the view that s 2(2) of the Act applied only to machinery used for manufacturing, processing or other industrial purposes and that the Wind Tunnel was not used for such purposes (see the VRB decision at [64]). The minority also opined that there was no evidence that suggested that the turbulent effects of the changed air was the commodity being marketed and sold, and that what was in fact being sold was the experience of simulated skydiving and flying, or in other words, a sports and recreational service (see the VRB decision at [66]).', '11\\u2003The respondents appealed from the VRB\u2019s decision to the High Court.', '12\\u2003On 16 January 2020, the Judge gave his decision on the respondents\u2019 appeal. He found that the VRB was right in concluding that the Wind Tunnel was machinery, and not merely the setting for business (see the Judgment at [7] and [11]). However, he took the view that the legislative purpose of s 2(2) of the Act was to \u201cencourage investments in plant and machinery for manufacturing, processing and other industrial purposes\u201d and to \u201cpromote investments in manufacturing machinery\u201d. Since the Wind Tunnel was used for social events and not for any industrial purpose, it did not belong to the class of machinery to which s 2(2) of the Act was intended to apply (see the Judgment at [8] and [11]). The Judge therefore allowed the appeal.', '13\\u2003The appellant then appealed against the Judge\u2019s decision. With this, we now turn to the parties\u2019 respective cases.'"}
{"casename":"2021_SGCA_41","fact":"'4\\u2003The applicant claimed trial to the following charge:', '5\\u2003The applicant was tried jointly with one Dominic Martin Fernandez (\u201cDominic\u201d). Dominic was charged with trafficking the drugs in question by delivering the two bundles to the applicant.', '6\\u2003The applicant did not dispute possession of the two bundles or that the bundles contained diamorphine. He also did not dispute that some of the drugs in the bundles were meant to be repackaged and sold. The applicant\u2019s primary defence was that he had ordered only a 400g bundle of heroin (a street name for diamorphine) but Dominic delivered the two bundles weighing 453g and 453.4g respectively to him. He also claimed that a portion of the drugs in the 400g bundle was meant for his own consumption and that he had intended to sell only about 13.318g of the diamorphine. If so, the amount of diamorphine that was in his possession for the purpose of trafficking was below the threshold amount of 15g for a capital offence.', '7\\u2003The High Court (\u201cthe Judge\u201d) convicted both the applicant and Dominic in Public Prosecutor v Dominic Martin Fernandez and another [2017] SGHC 226 (\u201cthe Judgment\u201d). The Judge found that the applicant had ordered the two bundles of heroin that he received from Dominic. Although the Judge rejected the applicant\u2019s testimony at trial that he would have kept ten or 12 packets, each containing 8g of diamorphine, for his own consumption, the Judge accepted the applicant\u2019s admission in his investigation statement that he would have kept five such packets for his own consumption. The Judge held that based on the evidence, the two bundles would have yielded at least 116 such packets. Deducting five packets from the total, 111 packets would have been meant for trafficking. Calculating from the total diamorphine content as stated in the charge, the 111 packets would have contained about 33.89g of diamorphine (35.41g x 111 \u00f7 116). There was a mistake in an earlier computation during the trial which arrived at the amount of 33.39g instead of the correct amount of 33.89g. The Judge held that the use of the incorrect lower weight did not prejudice the applicant. The Judge therefore convicted the applicant of trafficking in the lower amount of 33.39g of diamorphine by having the drugs in his possession for the purpose of trafficking (the Judgment at [51]\u2013[54]).', '8\\u2003The mandatory death penalty was imposed on the applicant because he could not fulfil any of the requirements for alternative sentencing under s 33B of the MDA. However, Dominic fulfilled the requirements under s 33B(2) of the MDA and was sentenced to life imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane.', '9\\u2003On 4 July 2018, the Court of Appeal (comprising Andrew Phang JCA, Chao Hick Tin SJ and me) dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal against his conviction and sentence by way of an oral judgment in CCA 42\/2017. The Court of Appeal upheld the Judge\u2019s finding that the applicant had ordered two bundles of drugs. The Court of Appeal agreed with the Judge that the applicant would have kept, at best, only five packets for his own consumption and that the claim of 12 packets was a belated attempt at inflating his drug consumption. The Court of Appeal also found it unbelievable that the applicant would have consumed so much of the drugs given his lack of financial means which drove him to drug-trafficking in the first place. It opined that even if the applicant had ordered only one bundle of drugs and assuming that bundle was the one with the lower diamorphine content of 17.11g instead of the other with 18.3g, the defence of consumption would not have reduced the weight of the diamorphine trafficked to below 15g.'"}

In 2014, he was the beneficial owner of approximately 15.49 million shares in a public-listed company known as PSL Holdings Ltd (\u201cPSL\u201d). Of these, 5.735 million shares were held by his wife, Yvonne Seow Ee Fun (\u201cMs Seow\u201d), and another 9.755 million shares were held by his mother, the second appellant (\u201cMdm Tay\u201d), on behalf of Mr Lim. In addition, Mr Lim had three banking clients who also owned PSL shares, namely, Dr Chung Sook Yin (\u201cDr Chung\u201d), Tan Seung Yuen (\u201cTSY\u201d), and Dr Currie Chiang (\u201cDr Chiang\u201d) who owned not less than 4 million shares, 15.5 million shares, and 5.5 million shares respectively.', '4\\u2003In 2014, Mr Lim was introduced by one George Lim (\u201cGeorge\u201d) to Tedy Teow (\u201cMr Teow\u201d), who was a wealthy businessman. Discussions ensued and Mr Lim agreed to sell Mr Teow 35 million PSL shares for $10.5 million at 30 cents per share. Mr Teow informed Mr Lim that he would purchase the shares through his associates, the respondents, Hong Choon Hau (\u201cMr Hong\u201d) and Tan Kim Hee (\u201cMr Tan\u201d). Mr Lim claimed that he had persuaded Dr Chiang, Dr Chung and TSY to sell their respective shares as part of this share transaction. Thereafter, Mr Lim asked a solicitor, Low Chai Chong (\u201cMr Low\u201d), from Rodyk & Davidson LLP (\u201cRodyk\u201d) (as it then was), to draft the Sale and Purchase agreement (\u201cSPA\u201d). When the draft was done, Mr Low sent the SPA to Mr Lim and to one Bernard Lim Wey Chyuan (\u201cBernard\u201d), the latter being the point of contact for Mr Teow and the respondents. Bernard then arranged for a meeting between Mr Lim and the respondents. On 17 September 2014, the following persons met at Rodyk\u2019s office (\u201cthe Rodyk Meeting\u201d):', '5\\u2003At the Rodyk Meeting, Mr Lim and the respondents signed the SPA.

{"casename":"2021_SGCA_45","fact":"'5\\u2003The facts have already been eloquently set out in the decision of the Judge below (the \u201cJudge\u201d), and we do not propose to repeat them in any great detail. Briefly, the appellants and the respondent entered into the following agreements on 9 June 2013:', '(a)\\u2003A contract (\u201cthe Contract\u201d) between the first appellant and the respondent where the respondent agreed to design, build, launch, equip, commission, test, complete, sell, and deliver to the first appellant a Self-Erected Tender Rig and a Derrick Equipment Set (collectively, the \u201cHull\u201d); and', '(b)\\u2003A company guarantee by the second appellant in favour of the respondent in respect of the Contract (the \u201cGuarantee\u201d).', '6\\u2003After having entered into the Contract, the parties entered into a number of addenda to the contract. Addendum No. 2 was entered into on 24 September 2014. Of central importance to the present appeal is Article 6(d) of Addendum No. 2, which varied the payment term in the Contract such that 10% of the total contract sum (the \u201cFourth Instalment\u201d) would become payable upon \u201claunching and receipt of [the] invoice issued by the [builder, ie, the respondent]\u201d. A further stipulation in Addendum No. 2 provided that \u201claunching [was] subject to prior approval by the [ship classification society], [the first appellant], and [the respondent] collectively\u201d.', '7\\u2003On 20 January 2015, the respondent purported to launch the Hull into the water for the purposes of Art 6(d) of Addendum No. 2. That same day, the first appellant\u2019s project manager emailed the respondent stating, inter alia, that it \u201c[did] not consider the floating as launching\u201d. Following the disputed launch on 20 January, various meetings involving the parties\u2019 representatives were held on 21 January, 7 April, and 28 April 2015 (collectively, the \u201cConstruction and Progress Meetings\u201d). The purpose of the Construction and Progress Meetings was, among other things, to iron out and update various outstanding items or deficiencies in the construction of the Hull that the first appellant required the respondent to remedy. It was the respondent\u2019s position that by 28 April 2015, all outstanding issues and\/or deficiencies in relation to the Hull had been resolved.', '8\\u2003On 3 May 2015, the Hull was launched (the \u201csecond launch\u201d). On 5 May 2015, the respondent demanded payment of the Fourth Instalment. As payment continued to be withheld, the respondent issued a default notice on 3 August 2016 pursuant to the terms of the Guarantee requesting that the appellants pay the Fourth Instalment. As payment was still not forthcoming, the respondent commenced the Arbitration against the appellants. The Notice of Arbitration was filed on 26 September 2016. Following the usual exchange of pleadings, an oral hearing took place between 21 and 25 May 2018, where both sides called factual and expert witnesses. Thereafter, detailed written closing and reply submissions were exchanged.', '9\\u2003The central issue in question at the Arbitration was, for present purposes, whether the respondent (the claimant in the Arbitration) was entitled to the Fourth Instalment. The Tribunal found that the respondent, first appellant, and the relevant ship classification society had collectively given their approval for the launch of the Hull, with the first appellant having given its approval on 28 April 2015 for the second launch on 3 May 2015. The Tribunal found that the minutes of the Construction and Progress Meetings that took place on 7 and 28 April 2015 recorded that the respondent had resolved all the remaining items which the first appellant required the respondent to remedy before the Hull was considered to be in \u201c[l]aunching condition\u201d. The Tribunal also found that the minutes recorded the first appellant\u2019s clear acceptance that the outstanding requirements had been met. By its acceptance that the outstanding issues had been resolved, the Tribunal found that the first appellant had also given its approval for the second launch. Even if the minutes did not show that the first appellant had given its express approval for the second launch of the Hull, the Tribunal was prepared to conclude that the first appellant ought to be treated as having approved it.', '10\\u2003The Tribunal thus found that there was no valid reason for the appellants to withhold payment of the Fourth Instalment. Accordingly, in its award (the \u201cAward\u201d), the Tribunal ordered the appellants to, inter alia, pay the respondent the sum of US$13.9m (ie, the Fourth Instalment) with interest.', '11\\u2003The appellants then applied to set aside the part of the Award relating to the respondent\u2019s claim for the Fourth Instalment under the Contract. The grounds the appellants relied on were twofold.', '12\\u2003First, relying on Article 34(2)(a)(iii) of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration (\u201cthe Model Law\u201d) as set out in the First Schedule to the International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (the \u201cIAA\u201d), the appellants argued that the Award had been made in excess of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction:', '(a)\\u2003The appellants submitted that the Tribunal had exceeded its jurisdiction in finding that the first appellant had, on 28 April 2015, approved the second launch of the Hull, thereby fulfilling the condition precedent that the respondent needed to satisfy prior to the second launch on 3 May 2015.', '(b)\\u2003It was also contended by the appellants that the Tribunal had transposed approval which had been given for the second launch in May 2015 retrospectively as consent for the earlier launch on 20 January 2015.', '13\\u2003Second, the appellants alleged that the Award had been made in breach of the right to present their case, in violation of Article 34(2)(a)(ii) of the Model Law and\/or in breach of the rules of natural justice, in violation of s 24(b) of the IAA:', '(a)\\u2003The appellants complained that the Tribunal had acted in breach of natural justice by deviating from the parties\u2019 pleaded cases when it determined that the Hull had been properly launched in the second launch, and that the respondent had thus satisfied the conditions for payment of the Fourth Instalment.', '(b)\\u2003The appellants also asserted that the Tribunal had acted in breach of natural justice by \u201cdisallowing the cross-examination of the [respondent\u2019s] expert witness regarding the Contract \u2026 contrary to his Witness Statement and Responsive Report\u201d.', '14\\u2003The Judge dismissed all of the appellants\u2019 attempts to impugn the Award in their entirety, finding that they were not borne out by the record from the Arbitration. Dissatisfied, the appellants appealed.', '15\\u2003On appeal, the appellants abandoned most of their arguments below. Instead, the appellants\u2019 remaining submissions were twofold:', '(a)\\u2003First, that the Tribunal had acted in excess of its jurisdiction in finding that there had been the requisite approval in April 2015 for the second launch of the Hull in May 2015. Accordingly, the Tribunal had also exceeded its jurisdiction in finding that the Fourth Instalment had fallen due.', '(b)\\u2003Second, that the Tribunal had acted in breach of natural justice and the appellants\u2019 rights to be heard because the ground that the Tribunal had relied on, ie that approval had been given for the second launch, was not in issue in the Arbitration. Accordingly, the appellants had been denied the opportunity to present their case on that issue.'"}
{"casename":"2021_SGCA_46","fact":"'3\\u2003The facts are set out by the Judge in the Judgment and are largely undisputed. It is rather the characterisation of the relevant actions of OTC and OBC that is the subject of heated dispute between the parties. We thus summarise only the facts that are relevant for the purposes of the present appeal. Given the numerous individuals, companies and agreements involved in the present case, we provide a summary of the abbreviations adopted, in Annexures A, B and C below, with some details to the extent that such details were made available to the Court.', '4\\u2003The story of this family dispute begins in the 1960s. This was when Mr Ong first set up a sole proprietorship, Tong Garden Product Services. In 1980, the Company was incorporated and subsequently became the ultimate holding company for a number of subsidiaries and associated companies, collectively referred to as the \u201cTong Garden Group\u201d. The Company was itself a pure holding company that did not conduct any business of its own. Its revenue was solely derived from investments in the business of its subsidiaries and associated companies. The Tong Garden Group was involved in the manufacture, marketing and sale of various snack products such as nuts, seeds and dried fruit.', '5\\u2003Mr Ong, who remained in sole control of the Tong Garden business until his illness in early 1984, passed away later that year. Following his demise, Mr Ong\u2019s children took over the Tong Garden business. There was a multitude of legal proceedings over the years resulting in numerous changes in shareholdings and management of the Company. The only siblings who remained shareholders in the Company at the time of the present suit were OHC, OTC, OBC and OSA. OHC and OTC each held 520,000 shares, OBC held 1,760,000 shares and OSA held 200,000 shares in the Company. These shareholdings correspond to approximately 17.33%, 58.67% and 6.67% respectively of the Company\u2019s shares. The parties\u2019 positions in the Company, having shifted over the years, are chronicled as follows:', '(a)\\u2003OHC was a director from 16 August 1980 to 7 May 2003, during which period he was also managing director from 31 July 1999 onwards. OHC was declared a bankrupt on 3 December 2004 and obtained a discharge from bankruptcy on 16 September 2016.', '(b)\\u2003OTC was a director from 3 July 1984 to 14 April 2001, and from 30 December 2015 onwards. In addition, the Judge found that between 14 December 2008 to 29 December 2015, OTC acted as a de facto and\/or shadow director as well. This finding was not challenged by OTC on appeal and we need not say anything further in this regard.', '(c)\\u2003OBC was a director from 16 August 1960 to 8 December 1983, as well as from 1 September 1999 to 30 December 2015.', '(d)\\u2003OSA was a director from 10 April 1999 to 15 July 2009.', 'On 12 July 2018, the Company was placed in compulsory liquidation.', '6\\u2003We shall, for ease of reference, refer to the companies that form part of the Tong Garden Group as the Singapore Entities, Malaysian Entities and Thai Entities. These entities run the Tong Garden Group\u2019s operations in Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand respectively:', '(a)\\u2003Singapore Entities: Incorporated in 1994, Food Products (S) was the main operating entity in Singapore. It was a wholly-owned subsidiary of TGHPL, which was in turn a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Food Products (S) was wound up by way of a voluntary members\u2019 liquidation on 8 July 2013.', '(b)\\u2003Malaysian Entities: Food Products (M) was the manufacturing arm of the Tong Garden Group in Malaysia while Snack Food (M) took care of sales and marketing in Malaysia. Both were subsidiaries of Tong Garden Holdings Sdn Bhd, itself a subsidiary of TGHPL.', '(c)\\u2003Thai Entities: Tong Garden (T) was the main operating entity of the Tong Garden Group in Thailand and Nut Candy (T) was its subsidiary. Another Thai company, NOI (T), was the subject of some dispute, with OHC alleging that the Company had an interest in NOI (T), while OTC asserted that NOI (T) \u201cwas never a subsidiary or an associated company of the Company, and the Company has never had any direct or indirect interest in it\u201d (Judgment at [16]\u2013[17]).', '7\\u2003The alleged oppressive actions (see [8] below) further involve several companies that are not part of the Tong Garden Group but are either owned or controlled by OTC. These are:', '(a)\\u2003TGFS, which was incorporated on 7 March 2008 and was in turn wholly-owned by OTC FCPL. OTC is the sole director of TGFS.', '(b)\\u2003TGFM, which was incorporated on 3 April 2008 and was 99% owned by OTC FCPL. OTC is one of TGFM\u2019s directors. The other two shareholders of TGFM are OTC and his wife, YLC.', '(c)\\u2003OTC FCPL, which was incorporated on 12 September 2014 and was wholly-owned by OTC, who is also a director of that company.', '(d)\\u2003TGMSB, which was incorporated on 3 April 2008 and was a company ultimately controlled by OTC.', '8\\u2003OHC\u2019s claim of oppression centres around three categories of actions, broadly framed:', '(a)\\u2003First, the sale and diversion of the \u201cTong Garden\u201d and \u201cNOI\u201d trademarks (collectively, the \u201cTrademarks\u201d) from the Tong Garden Group to Villawood. We shall refer to this as the \u201cTrademarks Sale\u201d.', '(b)\\u2003Second, a series of actions that the parties had referred to as part of a broad restructuring exercise of the Tong Garden Group. We shall refer to this as the \u201cRestructuring\u201d for the sake of simplicity as the parties have done so.', '(c)\\u2003Third, the disposal of the business of the Tong Garden Group in Thailand to OTC\u2019s companies. We shall refer to this as the \u201cThai Entities Sale\u201d.', '9\\u2003OHC pleaded that these acts breached his \u201clegitimate expectations\u201d as to how the Company should be run based on his strict legal rights, such rights being based on or derived from: the Articles of Association of the Company, s 157 of the Act, common law and equity, and OTC\u2019s and OBC\u2019s directors\u2019 duties owed to the Company. As such, these impugned acts constituted oppressive conduct under s 216 of the Act by the majority shareholders in the Company who exercised their powers in a manner that prejudiced him. The fundamental and predicate question was thus whether the impugned acts constituted breaches of the duties that OTC and OBC owed to the Company as its directors.', '10\\u2003To remedy the alleged oppressive conduct, OHC sought an order for the buy-out of his minority stake in the Company or, in the alternative, an order for OTC to transfer to him a number of shares, to be determined, in Tong Garden (T), NOI (T), TGFS and TGFM for the nominal purchase consideration of $1.', '11\\u2003By an agreement dated 13 March 2000 (\u201cthe 2000 Villawood Agreement\u201d), the Tong Garden Group (through the Company, TGHPL, Food Products (S) and NOI Food Products Pte Ltd) sold, inter alia, the \u201cTong Garden\u201d and \u201cNOI\u201d trademarks, together with the goodwill of the business relating to the goods in respect of which these trademarks were registered, to Villawood. These trademarks, as specified in the Schedule contained therein, related to the Trademarks that were registered in Singapore and Malaysia.', '12\\u2003Villawood was a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands and was owned and controlled by OBC and his wife, who was also a director of Villawood at the material time. The consideration paid by Villawood in exchange for the Trademarks was $260,003 which was a price based on a desktop valuation of the \u201cTong Garden\u201d brand conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers Management Services Pte Ltd (\u201cPwC\u201d). PwC had been engaged by OHC in his capacity as the then-managing director of TGHPL. In its report dated 17 February 2000 (the \u201cReport\u201d), PwC opined that the value of the \u201cTong Garden\u201d and the \u201cNOI\u201d brand names was \u201cestimated to be in the range of S$200,000 \u2013 $260,000\u201d. The 2000 Villawood Agreement was signed by OHC and OTC (in their capacity as directors, and on behalf of the Tong Garden Group of companies) and OBC (in his capacity as director, and on behalf of Villawood). The 2000 Villawood Agreement was then approved by a TGHPL director\u2019s resolution on 17 March 2000, likewise signed by OHC and OTC.', '13\\u2003Sometime in October 2002, Villawood granted a ten-year licence to Food Products (S) and Snack Food (M) to manufacture and sell products bearing, among other things, the Trademarks (\u201cthe October 2002 Licence\u201d). The October 2002 Licence was to run from 13 March 2000 and would have expired on 13 March 2010. On 8 February 2010, prior to the expiry of the October 2002 Licence, Villawood informed Food Products (S) and Snack Food (M) that that licence would not be renewed.', '14\\u2003On 13 March 2010, Villawood entered into trademark licensing agreements with TGFS and TGFM. Through these agreements, Villawood granted each company a perpetual, irrevocable and exclusive licence to market, manufacture and sell products under, inter alia, the \u201cTong Garden\u201d and the \u201cNOI\u201d trademarks in, respectively, Singapore and Malaysia.', '15\\u2003On 9 November 2015, Villawood transferred the Trademarks to TGFS. On 8 April 2016, TGFS transferred the Trademarks to OTG Enterprise Pte Ltd. OTG Enterprise Pte Ltd was incorporated on 8 April 2016 and is wholly owned by OTC.', '16\\u2003OHC also pointed to a series of actions which took place in the course of 2008 to 2010. This was referred to by the parties as the \u201cRestructuring\u201d exercise. Although they used this nomenclature, we stress the importance of precisely identifying which acts formed part of this Restructuring exercise. This is because the term \u201crestructuring\u201d may be used to refer to corporate actions or to shareholder actions or to both.', '17\\u2003By 2007, OBC and OSA were the only two directors left in the Company. On 6 August 2007, OBC sent Ong Siew Lay (\u201cOSL\u201d), his sister who was then suing him, a letter. This letter was copied to OHC, OSA and two other siblings (Ong Siew Kuan and Ong Siew Chin), and it stated OHC\u2019s intention to extricate himself from the Tong Garden business and his offer to hand the reins over to OSL:', '18\\u2003OSL did not take up the offer. On 14 January 2008, OBC circulated a memorandum within the Tong Garden Group, stating that with effect from that date, the business operations in Singapore and Malaysia would be taken over by OTC, and OSA would retire from the day-to-day management of the business.', '19\\u2003On 15 March 2008, OBC and OTC entered into an agreement for OTC to purchase from OBC, for the price of $7m, the following:', '(a)\\u2003all of OBC\u2019s shares in the Tong Garden Group;', '(b)\\u2003all of the debts owed to OBC by the Tong Garden Group; and', '(c)\\u2003the trademark \u201cTong Garden\u201d owned by Villawood.', 'We shall refer to this as \u201cthe March 2008 Agreement\u201d. OTC then made payment to OHC under the March 2008 Agreement, through a series of instalments.', '20\\u2003On 14 August 2009, two companies controlled by OTC entered into distributorship agreements with companies that were part of the Tong Garden Group (collectively, \u201cthe 2009 Distributorship Agreements\u201d). First, TGFS entered into a distributorship agreement with Food Products (S) and Food Products (M). Second, TGMSB entered into a distributorship agreement with Snack Food (M) and Food Products (M). Pursuant to both these Distributorship Agreements, TGFS and TGMSB were respectively appointed the sole and exclusive distributors of peanuts and other snack foods in Singapore and Malaysia. Food Products (S) and Snack Food (M) were to cease carrying on the business of developing and selling these snack foods, while providing TGFS and TGMSB with such promotional materials, information, expertise, know-how and other assistance as the latter two companies might have reasonably required. It was also agreed as part of these Distributorship Agreements that, starting with the profits for the period from 1 April 2009 to 1 April 2010, the profits from the sale and distribution of the products would be shared among the various entities in the following proportions: 60% to TGFS or TGMSB (as the case might be), and the remaining 40% to Food Products (S) or Snack Food (M) (as the case might be).', '21\\u2003 Food Products (S), Food Products (M) and Snack Food (M) went into voluntary liquidation between 2012 and 2014.', '22\\u2003It is common ground between the parties that OTC was responsible for managing the Tong Garden Group\u2019s business in Thailand from no later than 1990 onwards, and that over the years, OTC had found it difficult to work with his siblings. Consequently, and sometime in or around 2000, he sought to focus on managing the Thai business. On 4 January 2001, OTC and the Company entered into two sale and purchase agreements:', '(a)\\u2003The first was an agreement whereby OTC contracted to purchase from the Company, \u201cthe whole of the undertaking of Tong Guan in the Territory, the goodwill and all other assets whatsoever and wheresoever situated of Tong Guan in the Territory\u201d (\u201cthe 2001 Thai SPA\u201d) with the exception of the \u201cTong Garden\u201d and \u201cNOI\u201d trademarks. The \u201cTerritory\u201d was defined as \u201cThailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam and Burma (Myanmar)\u201d. Clause 2 provided that, instead, the Company would grant to OTC \u201can exclusive, perpetual and irrevocable licence to use the said trademarks in the Territory. As cl 4 stated, the purchase price was \u201cbased on the Net Tangible Assets of all the companies listed in the First Schedule to this Agreement as per the audited accounts for the year [ending] 31 December 2000, after making appropriate adjustment for difference in inter-company balance\u201d (it bears mention here that no First Schedule was apparently attached to the 2001 Thai SPA). Clause 9 stated that the completion of the agreement \u201cshall take place at the office of M\/s Tan Cheng Yew & Partners \u2026 on 17 April 2000 at 2.00pm or such other date as may be mutually agreed by the parties\u201d, while cl 17 stated that the \u201ceffective date of the Agreement shall be 2 weeks from the date of signing this Agreement\u201d. Clause 19 stated that by the effective date, OTC \u201cshall \u2026 deliver to [the Company] his duly executed letter of resignation as a director of [the Company] and all companies listed in the Third Schedule of this Agreement\u201d (however, the Third Schedule was also not attached to the 2001 Thai SPA).', '(b)\\u2003The second was an agreement between OTC and OHC, OBC and OSA to sell them \u201call his shares and interest in [the Company]\u201d, which referred to OTC\u2019s 780,000 ordinary shares in the Company (\u201cthe 2001 Singapore SPA\u201d). Clause 2 of this agreement provided that the purchase price \u201cshall be based on the Net Tangible Asset of [the Company] as at 31 December 2000 as per the audited accounts, after making the appropriate adjustment for differences in inter-company balances\u201d and that the purchasers (ie, OHC, OBC and OSA) would pay OTC \u201cthe consideration by way of 5 yearly equal instalments\u201d (cl 4). Other clauses in the agreement provided for, inter alia, the completion date (cl 5) and the effective date (cl 7) of the agreement.', '23\\u2003On 23 February 2001, OTC sent the Company a letter stating his resignation as director of the following companies: (a) the Company; (b) TGHPL; (c) Food Products (S); (d) Food Products (M); (e) NOI Food Products Pte Ltd; and (f) Tong Garden Holdings Sdn Bhd.', '24\\u2003On 20 July 2009, the Company and OTC entered into an agreement intended to vary the 2001 Thai SPA (\u201cthe 2009 Variation Agreement\u201d). Among other things, the 2009 Variation Agreement provided for the completion date of the 2001 Thai SPA to be varied to 28 July 2009 (cl 2.1), while the effective date of that SPA was varied to the \u201c14th day after the date of the execution of the [Variation] Agreement\u201d (cl 2.3). Clause 2.4 also deleted cl 19 of the 2001 Thai SPA that had provided for OTC to tender his resignation from the Companies and other entities. Notably, the 2009 Variation Agreement did not alter cl 4 of the 2001 Thai SPA, which provided that the purchase price \u201cshall be based on the Net Tangible Assets of all the companies listed in the First Schedule to this Agreement as per the audited accounts for the year [ending] 31 December 2000, after making appropriate adjustment for difference in inter-company balance\u201d. Clause 2.5 of the 2009 Variation Agreement stipulated that \u201cthe entity listed\u201d in the (missing) First Schedule was to be Tong Garden (T).', '25\\u2003For the purpose of establishing the amount of consideration to be paid by OTC under the 2001 Thai SPA (as amended by the 2009 Variation Agreement), a firm of valuers \u2013 CC Koh & Co \u2013 was appointed to give an opinion. The report, dated 30 July 2009, opined that the \u201cfair market value of the shares of [Tong Garden (T)] as at 31 December 2000 is a negative value of Baht 95.73 per share, computed using the Net Tangible Assets method \u2026 technically the fair market value of the shares of [Tong Garden (T)] as at 31 December 2000 have nil value\u201d [original emphasis]. In addition, the fair market value was defined as \u201cthe price at which the property would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller when the former is not under any compulsion to buy and the latter is not under compulsion to sell, and both parties have reasonable knowledge of the relevant facts\u201d.', '26\\u2003On 20 July 2009, the Company and OTC entered into a deed of waiver, wherein the Company waived unconditionally its inter-company claims against Tong Garden (T) (\u201cthe 2009 Deed of Waiver\u201d). The 2009 Deed of Waiver stated, as per cl 2.1, that the Company would \u201chereby irrevocably and unconditionally waive any and all claims against [Tong Garden (T)] and to any and all claims to whatsoever interests in [Tong Garden (T)], of whatever nature and however arising, upon legal completion of the transactions contemplated under the [2001 Thai SPA]\u201d.', '27\\u2003On the same day, the Company and OTC further entered into a licensing agreement (\u201cthe 2009 Trademarks Licence Agreement\u201d), wherein the Company granted OTC a perpetual, irrevocable and exclusive licence to market, manufacture and sell Tong Garden products in Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam and Myanmar under the trademarks stated in Schedule 1 of the agreement. The 2009 Trademarks Licence Agreement stated that the agreement was being executed pursuant to the parties\u2019 obligations under the 2001 Thai SPA and that the consideration of the licence would be a \u201cone-time nominal licence fee of S$1.00\u201d that \u201cshall be paid to [the Company] upon the signing of this [2009 Trademarks Licence Agreement]\u201d (cl 4). The 2009 Trademarks Licence Agreement was signed by OBC, as director for and on behalf of the Company.'"}
{"casename":"2021_SGCA_47","fact":"'2\\u2003The appellant had pleaded guilty and admitted to the joint statement of facts (\u201cJSOF\u201d) prepared by the Prosecution. The material facts in the JSOF were as follows. The appellant was a member of a Malaysian-based drug syndicate which organises illegal drug deliveries from Malaysia to Singapore. The syndicate\u2019s modus operandi is to conceal illicit drugs in rented cars and to have human couriers drive the drug-laden cars from Malaysia to Singapore in order to facilitate the onward delivery of the drugs to the syndicate\u2019s clients in Singapore. Sometime before 30 December 2017, the appellant received about 4kg of cannabis (gross weight) from a member of the syndicate known as \u201cWan\u201d. The 4kg of cannabis was then packed into five bundles (\u201cthe Bundles\u201d). The appellant instructed one Mohd Azraa Azwan Bin Yahya (\u201cAzraa\u201d) to deliver the Bundles to one Ungku Mohamed Hakim Bin Mohamed Faisal (\u201cUngku\u201d) in Singapore for purposes of onward delivery and sale. The appellant offered to pay Azraa upon the successful delivery of the Bundles. Azraa accepted, and Azraa, Ungku and the appellant thus formed the common intention to import the Bundles into Singapore on 30 December 2017.', '3\\u2003Thereafter, Azraa obtained a rented red car (\u201cthe Red Car\u201d) and handed it over to the appellant who brought it to the syndicate\u2019s workshop in Malaysia for the concealment of the Bundles. Ungku also rented a silver car in Singapore (\u201cthe Silver Car\u201d), as coordinated by the appellant, and thereafter Ungku sent someone to collect the car in Singapore on his behalf as he was still in Malaysia at the time.', '4\\u2003On 30 December 2017, the three accused persons met to discuss their plans. Ungku was to enter Singapore through the Woodlands Checkpoint first, to monitor the security conditions, and once the coast was clear, Azraa would drive the Red Car with the Bundles concealed in it into Singapore through the Woodlands Checkpoint. Before 6am on the same day, Ungku headed from Malaysia to Singapore on his motorcycle and sent WhatsApp text messages to the appellant to report on the traffic conditions in Singapore and the conditions at the Woodlands Checkpoint. The appellant and Ungku decided to proceed as planned whereupon the appellant called Azraa and directed him to drive into Singapore.', '5\\u2003During this time, Ungku informed the appellant about some drug orders which he had secured and consulted the appellant about the selling price of the cannabis.', '6\\u2003At around 2pm, Azraa entered Singapore via Woodlands Checkpoint in the Red Car. The car was stopped for a random check and when its steering wheel was swabbed for an IONSCAN analysis, it revealed positive results for the presence of methamphetamine. The Bundles were found buried deep in the respective car doors and were so well concealed that they remained undetected even when the ICA officers conducted a dog search. It was only after a back-scatter vehicle was used to scan the Red Car that anomalies were detected in the car doors and the Bundles subsequently discovered.', '7\\u2003Acting on information received, the Central Narcotics Bureau (\u201cCNB\u201d) arrested Ungku the same day. Before Ungku\u2019s arrest, Ungku informed the appellant that he was being followed whereupon the appellant instructed him to delete the messages between them but Ungku did not manage to do so in time. Around six months later in June 2018, the appellant was repatriated from Malaysia to Singapore.', '8\\u2003The vegetable matter in the Bundles was analysed by the Health Sciences Authority and found to contain not less than 499.9g of cannabis.', '9\\u2003As stated earlier, the Judge sentenced the appellant to 27 years\u2019 imprisonment and 15 strokes, and the two co-accused to 24 years and six months\u2019 imprisonment and 15 strokes.'"}
{"casename":"2021_SGCA_48","fact":"'4\\u2003The full facts and procedural history of this matter are set out in the Judge\u2019s written judgment in Re Aathar Ah Kong Andrew [2020] SGHC 173 (\u201cthe Judgment\u201d).', '5\\u2003In brief, Mr Aathar is an investor who ran into serious financial difficulties in or around 2015 and eventually faced bankruptcy proceedings in February 2016. In his attempt to stave off these proceedings, Mr Aathar has proposed a total of three voluntary arrangements (\u201cVA(s)\u201d).', '6\\u2003The first two VAs, which were proposed by Mr Aathar in 2016 and 2017 respectively, were passed at creditors\u2019 meetings. However, on the application of objecting creditors, approvals for the first and second VAs were revoked by an Assistant Registrar and by a High Court Judge, respectively. Mr Aathar\u2019s appeal in respect of the second VA was subsequently dismissed by this court (see Aathar Ah Kong Andrew v CIMB Securities (Singapore) Pte Ltd and other appeals and another matter [2019] 2 SLR 164).', '7\\u2003On 24 January 2019, Mr Aathar proposed the third VA. The third VA also passed at a creditors\u2019 meeting but was objected to by OUELH, which then applied in HC\/SUM 3309\/2019 (\u201cSUM 3309\u201d) to revoke approval for the third VA. SUM 3309 was allowed by an Assistant Registrar, whose decision was upheld on 17 August 2020 by the Judge in RA 310. Notably, Mr Aathar was adjudged bankrupt on 13 November 2019, during the course of the proceedings for RA 310. He remains an undischarged bankrupt to date.', '8\\u2003On 17 September 2020, A&P filed the NOA, ostensibly on Mr Aathar\u2019s behalf, seeking to appeal against the Judge\u2019s decision in RA 310 by way of CA 157.', '9\\u2003There is some inconsistency between A&P\u2019s and Mr Aathar\u2019s accounts of the circumstances surrounding the filing of the NOA. A&P alleges that it filed the NOA solely on the instructions of Mr Aathar\u2019s wife, and that she did not represent herself to be Mr Aathar\u2019s agent at the material time. Consequently, A&P takes the position that the NOA was filed without Mr Aathar\u2019s authority. Mr Aathar, on the other hand, claims that he had requested his wife to instruct A&P to file the NOA on his behalf, and therefore regards himself as having indirectly authorised A&P to file the NOA.', '10\\u2003Notwithstanding this discrepancy, there are two crucial facts pertaining to the filing of the NOA which are not in dispute. The first is that, as at the time of filing the NOA, A&P did not possess a warrant to act from Mr Aathar. The second is that Mr Aathar did not obtain the Official Assignee\u2019s (\u201cOA\u201d) consent to commence CA 157 prior to the filing of the NOA. We will elaborate on the significance of these two facts below.', '11\\u2003On 9 November 2020, OUELH filed CA\/SUM 125\/2020 (\u201cSUM 125\u201d), seeking a stay of the proceedings in CA 157 pending Mr Aathar\u2019s payment of outstanding costs in the proceedings below and in earlier proceedings. SUM 125 was heard by Quentin Loh JAD on 19 January 2021. Loh JAD made no order as to SUM 125 as he found that the requirements for a stay were not satisfied. However, as it had transpired during the hearing that, inter alia: (a) A&P did not have a warrant to act from Mr Aathar; and (b) Mr Aathar had not obtained the OA\u2019s prior sanction to commence CA 157, Loh JAD observed that there might be sufficient grounds for OUELH to obtain an order to strike out the NOA.', '12\\u2003On the same day as the hearing for SUM 125, A&P applied in SUM 6 to discharge itself from acting for Mr Aathar in CA 157, on the basis that Mr Aathar wished to engage new solicitors, namely, LVM Law Chambers LLC (\u201cLVM\u201d), to take over the conduct of the matter. However, on 17 February 2021, one day before SUM 6 was heard, OUELH filed SUM 19 seeking to strike out the NOA. As SUM 19 touched on issues pertaining to Mr Aathar\u2019s and A&P\u2019s solicitor-client relationship, SUM 6 was adjourned to be heard together with SUM 19 on 15 April 2021 (\u201cthe Hearing\u201d).', '13\\u2003On the afternoon of 14 April 2021 (ie, the eve of the Hearing), Mr Aathar wrote to court requesting to adjourn the Hearing, asserting that: (a) he required proper legal advice to file his submissions against the striking-out application; (b) LVM was presently in contact with the OA regarding his prosecution of CA 157; and (c) he believed that he could obtain the OA\u2019s consent to prosecute CA 157. At 9.20pm on the same day, Mr Aathar sent a further e-mail to the court stating that he would not attend the Hearing as he did not have any lawyers to advise him on whether he could do so without the OA\u2019s consent. We directed Mr Aathar to attend the Hearing and to make any application for adjournment in person. Mr Aathar eventually attended the Hearing as directed.', '14\\u2003During the Hearing, we made clear to Mr Aathar that we were unable to accede to his request to adjourn the Hearing for two reasons. First, Mr Aathar had not produced any objective evidence whatsoever to prove that LVM had indeed been in contact with the OA. Second, Mr Aathar had been informed of the date of the Hearing since 9 March 2021. He had not taken issue with the hearing date then and had even written to court on 19 March 2021 stating that he could attend the Hearing via Zoom. Given the extremely belated and unsubstantiated nature of Mr Aathar\u2019s request, it was evident to us that Mr Aathar was simply trying to game the system and prolong the proceedings without having any legitimate reason to do so. We thus allowed the Hearing to proceed as scheduled.'"}
{"casename":"2021_SGCA_49","fact":"'7\\u2003Before his arrest, the applicant was the chairman of the Huashin Group, a Taiwanese property development conglomerate with significant investments in the People\u2019s Republic of China (\u201cChina\u201d). The applicant was responsible for, among other things, overseeing the Huashin Group\u2019s property developments in China, specifically those in Qingdao. At the beginning of 2001, the applicant discovered that certain developments under his charge were \u201cbeset by problems brought about by the actions of numerous corrupt officials in China\u201d. This prompted him to relocate to Qingdao to iron out the issues. The records from the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (\u201cICA\u201d) showed that the applicant last travelled out of Singapore using his Singapore passport on 21 May 2001, four days after he was made a bankrupt here.', '8\\u2003According to the applicant, his attempts to protect his investments in China prompted corrupt officials to organise his arrest in April 2004 and to detain him for some seven months. The Chinese authorities seized the applicant\u2019s passport and identity card and did not return them to him when he was released in December 2004.', '9\\u2003Thereafter, the applicant remained in China but relocated to Xiamen in late 2009 because of his growing concern about further retaliation from allegedly corrupt officials. The applicant spoke to the Consulate-General of Singapore in Xiamen (the \u201cXiamen consulate\u201d) about applying for a replacement passport but nothing came out of those inquiries. In March 2010, the applicant received an urgent request from Mr Tsai You Zhang (\u201cMr Tsai\u201d), the director of the Huashin Group, to travel to Taiwan. The objective of this trip was to convince Taiwanese officials to broker a compromise with the Chinese authorities in respect of the Huashin Group\u2019s expropriated properties in Qingdao. However, the applicant could not do so as he did not have a passport.', '10\\u2003The applicant applied for a Singapore passport at the Xiamen consulate on 28 April 2010. It transpired later that this application was not processed as the applicant had failed to settle outstanding issues with (a) the Insolvency and Public Trustee\u2019s Office after he was made a bankrupt on 17 May 2001; and (b) the ICA\u2019s Identification Card Unit (HC GD at [16]\u2013[17]).', '11\\u2003In early 2010, Mr Tsai, who had become increasingly anxious about the applicant\u2019s inability to travel, telephoned the applicant and proposed that he get an investment passport. The applicant understood this to mean a passport issued by a third-party country on the condition that the applicant invest in that country. Mr Tsai then introduced the applicant to Mr Huang Yueh Chao (\u201cMr Huang\u201d) of the Huashin Group. Mr Huang told the applicant that he had found an agent in Taiwan to help him apply for a Philippine investment passport (the \u201cPassport\u201d) and further, that there was a Philippine company for sale that would fulfil the investment criteria for the Passport. The applicant agreed to purchase this company for US$250,000. He also supplied Mr Huang with his personal particulars, a passport photograph and his fingerprints for the application for the Passport. During this time, the applicant also found out that his mother was very sick and he wanted to travel to Singapore to visit her (DJ GD at [36]).', '12\\u2003The applicant\u2019s Singapore passport expired on 17 November 2010. In March 2011, Mr Huang met the applicant in Xiamen and handed him the Passport along with the relevant supporting documents. These included a Filipino social security card and a business permit for the investment company. Upon receiving the Passport, the applicant noticed that the bearer\u2019s details were stated as \u201cNgo Boris Jacinto\u201d, a Philippine national born on 27 August 1967 in San Juan, Rizal (HC GD at [11]). However, the Passport bore the applicant\u2019s photograph. The applicant believed that the name in the Passport was accurate. He had given Mr Huang instructions to reflect \u201cBoris\u201d as his English name. Mr Huang had also told him that his surname \u201cGoh\u201d would be reflected as \u201cNgo\u201d. As for \u201cJacinto\u201d, Mr Huang explained that this name was the Filipino equivalent of the applicant\u2019s mother\u2019s maiden name and had to be reflected as the applicant\u2019s middle name in line with Filipino matrilineal naming conventions.', '13\\u2003The applicant realised that the other particulars in the Passport, such as his date and place of birth, were incorrect. When he raised this matter with Mr Huang, he was informed that correcting these mistakes would require Mr Huang to go back to the Philippines and reapply for a new passport. As this would take considerable time and the applicant needed to travel urgently, the applicant decided to use the Passport to travel to Taiwan since it contained his photograph and his thumbprint. To date, the applicant maintains that he believed the Passport was a genuine travel document.', '14\\u2003Investigations revealed that the applicant used the Passport to travel into and out of Singapore on 46 occasions from 20 March 2011 to 7 September 2012. On the 46th occasion on 7 September 2012, the applicant was arrested while passing through the immigration checkpoint at Changi Airport to board a flight to Hong Kong. It was not in dispute that on each of the 23 occasions when the applicant entered Singapore using the Passport, he produced a disembarkation form that reflected the particulars stated in the Passport and contained the declaration that he had never used a passport under a different name to enter Singapore.', '15\\u2003It was also accepted that the applicant continued to use the Passport despite having applied for a new Singapore passport on 30 January 2012. This passport was sent to the Xiamen consulate and, according to the Prosecution\u2019s witness, was collected by the applicant in person on 17 February 2012 as the signature acknowledging receipt of the Singapore passport was the same as that on the second page of the said passport (DJ GD at [29]). However, the applicant claimed that the passport was collected by his agent and he came into possession of it much later, in December 2012 (DJ GD at [45]).', '16\\u2003 The Prosecution\u2019s case in respect of the s 47(3) Passports Act charges was as follows. Sometime in 2010, the applicant had intended to travel to see his ailing mother in Singapore and to visit several other countries for business. As an undischarged bankrupt, he could not travel without the Official Assignee\u2019s permission. He therefore decided to procure the Passport at US$250,000 so that he could travel undetected. It was obvious that this Passport, which carried the name Ngo Boris Jacinto, was not issued validly to the applicant. Moreover, the applicant had actual knowledge of this fact, having noticed the various discrepancies in the Passport.', '17\\u2003In advancing its case, the Prosecution called six witnesses including Mr Victorio Mario M Dimagiba Jr (\u201cMr Dimagiba\u201d), the Consul-General of the Philippine Embassy in Singapore. Mr Dimagiba testified that the Philippine authorities had no record of a passport having been issued to a \u201cBoris Jacinto Ngo\u201d under the passport number stated in the Passport. During his cross-examination, Mr Dimagiba added that the Philippine Government had \u201cinitiated an investigation to determine how such a fake passport [had] come into existence\u201d.', '18\\u2003In respect of the Immigration Act charges, it was not disputed that the applicant had instructed his friends to fill out the disembarkation forms beforehand and that he signed on the disembarkation forms. While the Prosecution submitted that the applicant knew that the information in the forms was false (DJ GD at [32]), the applicant\u2019s defence was that the information was not false (DJ GD at [41]).', '19\\u2003The applicant was the only person to testify in his defence. He reiterated his belief that the Passport was a genuine travel document and, by extension, that the information stated in his disembarkation forms was accurate. In respect of the s 47(3) Passports Act charges, the applicant also claimed, in the alternative, that he had a \u201creasonable excuse\u201d to use the Passport (a defence available to him under s 47(7) of the Passports Act). The ICA had deprived him of a valid Singapore passport and therefore, he had no choice but to rely on a Philippine passport to travel for business and for personal reasons (DJ GD at [34] and [45]). At the trial, the applicant indicated initially that he would be calling two other defence witnesses, namely Mr Tsai and Mr Huang. However, in the light of Mr Dimagiba\u2019s evidence, the applicant\u2019s then-counsel considered that it was unnecessary to call these witnesses because \u201cthe evidence as it stood might not make out the [s 47(3) Passports Act] charges\u201d.', '20\\u2003In the applicant\u2019s closing submissions before the DJ, it was argued that the Passports Act drew a clear and intentional distinction between a \u201cforeign travel document\u201d (in s 2(1)) and a \u201cfalse foreign travel document\u201d (in s 2(3)). On Mr Dimagiba\u2019s evidence, it was apparent that the Passport fell into the latter category because it was \u201cnot issued by or on behalf of\u201d the Philippine Government. It followed that the actus reus of the s 47(3) Passports Act charges, which concerned the misuse of a genuine foreign travel document, was not made out. In reply, the Prosecution invited the DJ to amend the s 47(3) Passports Act charges to charges under s 47(1) of the Passports Act. The Prosecution argued that sufficient evidence had been adduced already to make out the offence under s 47(1). Further, the applicant would not suffer prejudice by such an amendment as the distinction between the s 47(3) Passports Act charges and the proposed s 47(1) charges was only in respect of the characterisation of the Passport (DJ GD at [47]\u2013[48]). The Prosecution also pointed out that the prescribed punishment was the same under both s 47(1) and s 47(3) of the Passports Act.', '21\\u2003After the exchange of their closing submissions, the parties were informed that the DJ would deliver her verdict on 7 February 2018. On 9 January 2018, the parties were told that the DJ would be \u201cposting out of State Courts w.e.f. 1 March 2018\u201d and needed to bring forward the date of delivery of her verdict to 1 February 2018.', '22\\u2003On 1 February 2018, the DJ delivered her oral grounds of decision. She convicted the applicant on the Immigration Act charges (DJ GD at [3]). However, in respect of the s 47(3) Passports Act charges, she exercised her discretion under s 128(1) of the CPC to amend them to charges for possession of a false foreign travel document under s 47(6) of the Passports Act.', '23\\u2003The DJ\u2019s reasons were as follows. She accepted that the Passport was a false foreign travel document. She disagreed with the Prosecution\u2019s submissions to amend the s 47(3) Passports Act charges to charges under s 47(1) because s 47(1) required the Prosecution to prove that the applicant \u201chad furnished the offending passport with the intention of dishonestly inducing\u201d the various ICA officers \u201cto accept it as though it were genuine\u201d and that the ICA officers \u201cwere influenced to exercise a public duty in affixing either an entry or a departure stamp on the said passport\u201d (DJ GD at [54]). As no such evidence was adduced at the trial, the DJ decided that the s 47(3) Passports Act charges should be amended to charges under s 47(6) of the Passports Act, which required the applicant to be in possession or control of a document which he knew or ought reasonably to have known was a false foreign travel document (DJ GD at [55]).', '24\\u2003It was not in dispute that the applicant was in possession of the Passport on the 46 occasions stated in the s 47(3) Passports Act charges. As for mens rea, the evidence at the trial showed that the applicant \u201cought reasonably to have known\u201d that the Passport \u201cwas not issued by the Philippines government\u201d. The evidence showed that the applicant obtained the Passport through dubious means and that he was wilfully blind to the circumstances under which he obtained the Passport (DJ GD at [55] and [76]). The DJ disbelieved the applicant\u2019s evidence that he acquired the Passport by way of an investment scheme. The applicant said he had to borrow US$250,000 to obtain the Passport but asked almost no questions about how it would be obtained. It was also \u201can almost comic coincidence\u201d that the Philippine company\u2019s name, BJN Tire Supply, matched the initials of the name \u201cBoris Jacinto Ngo\u201d in the Passport (DJ GD at [81]\u2013[83]). The DJ proceeded to amend the s 47(3) Passports Act charges to the s 47(6) Passports Act charges, as shown above.', '25\\u2003 Following the amendment of the charges, the DJ granted leave to the Defence to recall the Prosecution witnesses for further cross-examination. However, she did not grant the applicant\u2019s application under s 283(2) of the CPC to call Mr Tsai and Mr Huang as defence witnesses. Counsel for the applicant argued that Mr Tsai and Mr Huang would be able to give evidence on how the Passport was procured and to corroborate the applicant\u2019s evidence that he had sought to obtain a genuine travel document. The DJ disagreed. According to the DJ, \u201cwhat was crucial in determining whether these charges were made out was what the [applicant] himself ought reasonably to have known at the material time and not what these two witnesses did\u201d (DJ GD at [63]). The DJ did not consider whether she should exercise her general discretion under s 283(1) of the CPC. Section 283(1) and 283(2) of the CPC state:', '26\\u2003At the end of the trial, the DJ was satisfied that the s 47(6) Passports Act charges were proved beyond reasonable doubt and she convicted the applicant on those charges. She found that the applicant was wilfully blind to the circumstances under which he obtained the Passport. Although his photograph was affixed to the Passport, the particulars therein were not his (DJ GD at [76]\u2013[79]). The applicant failed to mention the investment scheme in all his investigation statements and could not give a reasonable explanation for his omission of this crucial aspect (DJ GD at [80]\u2013[83]). The applicant also did not have a reasonable excuse for using the Passport. There was no indication that he had \u201ctried his best\u201d to obtain a new Singapore passport from the ICA (DJ GD at [95]\u2013[97]).', '27\\u2003The DJ imposed a sentence of two months\u2019 imprisonment for each of the Immigration Act charges (two of which were ordered to run consecutively) and 12 months\u2019 imprisonment for each of the s 47(6) Passports Act charges (with a further two sentences to run consecutively). The total was therefore 28 months\u2019 imprisonment. The applicant was granted bail pending his appeal to the High Court (DJ GD at [119]\u2013[121]).', '28\\u2003The applicant appealed against his conviction on the s 47(6) Passports Act charges and against his sentence in relation to all the charges in HC\/MA 9055\/2018. In respect of his appeal against conviction, the applicant argued that: (a) the DJ had descended into the arena by questioning the applicant excessively at the end of his cross-examination, had prejudged his guilt by her remarks during the amendment of the s 47(3) Passports Act charges and ought to have recused herself when invited to do so; (b) the DJ usurped the Prosecution\u2019s function by rejecting the Prosecution\u2019s suggested amended charges and by amending the charges to the s 47(6) Passports Act charges on her own accord. Further, the DJ was precluded from taking into account the applicant\u2019s evidence given in relation to the s 47(3) Passports Act charges once the charges were amended to those under a different legal provision; (c) his application under s 283(2) of the CPC to call Mr Tsai and Mr Huang should not have been rejected as their evidence was \u201cessential to making a just decision in the case\u201d; and (d) the conviction on the 46 charges under s 47(6) Passports Act was wrong as the applicant was in continuous possession of the Passport (HC GD at [37]).', '29\\u2003On the applicant\u2019s first contention, the Judge concluded that the DJ did not descend into the arena in questioning the applicant. Her questions sought clarifications and were confined to the evidence already before the court. The length and persistence of the DJ\u2019s questioning were also in large part a product of the applicant\u2019s obduracy. Even if the DJ\u2019s questioning could be said to be intemperate, it could hardly amount to an egregious case which called for appellate intervention (HC GD at [134]\u2013[145]). In order for the DJ to amend the charges, she had to be satisfied that the Prosecution had discharged its evidential burden of proof on the s 47(6) Passports Act charges based on the evidence before her. Although the DJ could have spoken with more moderation when amending the charges, the Judge did not consider her to have prejudged the applicant\u2019s guilt or otherwise conducted herself so as to compromise the fairness of the trial (HC GD at [62], [147]\u2013[153]).', '30\\u2003With respect to the second ground of appeal, the Judge upheld the DJ\u2019s finding that the s 47(3) Passports Act charges were not made out. However, the Judge held that the DJ should not have amended the charges to 46 separate charges under s 47(6) of the Passports Act. The evidence was that the applicant possessed the Passport continuously between 20 March 2011 and 7 September 2012. The DJ should therefore have amended the s 47(3) Passports Act charges to a single s 47(6) Passports Act charge covering the period of possession. Pursuant to s 390(4) of the CPC, the Judge amended the s 47(6) Passports Act charges to the single amended s 47(6) Passports Act charge set out earlier (HC GD at [104], [115] and [154]).', '31\\u2003In rationalising the correctness of amending the s 47(3) Passports Act charges to charges for offences under s 47(6), the Judge found the distinction between the two offences to be \u201cfairly narrow\u201d (HC GD at [46]). The Judge opined that it was conceivable that the same evidence could point towards an offence under s 47(3) or s 47(6) even though these offences were mutually exclusive. The Judge gave the following illustration (HC GD at [46]):', '32\\u2003It was therefore equally possible to advance a single defence in respect of offences under ss 47(3) and 47(6). The Judge opined that this was what transpired in the applicant\u2019s case. The Judge characterised the applicant\u2019s defence as a claim that \u201che was under the justified impression that he was in possession of a genuine Philippine passport issued to him\u201d [emphasis in original] (HC GD at [86]). This revealed two facets of the applicant\u2019s evidence although they rose from the same foundation: (a) he believed that the Passport was genuine; and (b) he believed that the Passport was issued to him. The former was a defence to a s 47(6) Passports Act charge and the latter a defence to a s 47(3) Passports Act charge. The applicant\u2019s position amounted to a \u201csingle unified defence\u201d against both the s 47(3) and s 47(6) Passports Act charges (HC GD at [86]). Further, the DJ gave the applicant sufficient time to prepare the next steps in his defence (HC GD at [88]). The DJ\u2019s amendment of the s 47(3) Passports Act charges to s 47(6) Passports Act charges therefore did not prejudice the applicant\u2019s defence.', '33\\u2003In respect of the issue whether the DJ should have allowed the applicant to call Mr Tsai and Mr Huang as witnesses, the Judge examined the provisions of the CPC which govern the calling of witnesses following the amendment of a charge. The applicant contended that where a charge is amended after the Defence has been called, the trial should restart from the beginning of the Defence\u2019s case with the accused person testifying or calling evidence in his defence in accordance with s 230(1)(p) of the CPC. This meant that the applicant was entitled to call any relevant witness for his defence at that stage. According to the applicant, this reasoning was supported by the language of ss 230(1)(g)\u2013230(1)(i) of the CPC which direct the court to proceed in accordance with the procedure set out in ss 230(1)(j)\u2013230(1)(x) if an accused person claims trial to an amended charge (HC GD at [117]).', '34\\u2003The Judge rejected the applicant\u2019s submissions. Sections 230(1)(g)\u2013230(1)(i) merely clarify that if a charge is altered at the end of the Prosecution\u2019s case, the s 230(1) procedure should be followed \u201csince that is what would happen in any case even if the charge were not amended at that point\u201d. These provisions did not prescribe a return to s 230(1)(p) where the charges are altered at later stages. In the Judge\u2019s view, the appropriate post-amendment trial procedure was to be found in ss 129\u2013131 of the CPC. Section 129 outlined two options on how a trial can proceed. If the court finds that proceeding with the trial will not prejudice the accused person\u2019s defence, the trial may continue (s 129(3) of the CPC). Otherwise, the court can either direct a new trial or adjourn the trial (s 129(4) of the CPC) (HC GD at [119]\u2013[120]).', '35\\u2003The Judge further reasoned that following an amendment of the charges, an accused person must be allowed to \u201crecall or re-summon and examine any witness who may have been examined\u201d unless the application is frivolous or vexatious or is meant to cause delay or to frustrate justice (see s 131 of the CPC) (HC GD at [66], [120]\u2013[121]). Where the Defence needs to call additional, rather than recall, witnesses, the relevant provision to turn to is s 283 of the CPC (HC GD at [122]). As we have observed earlier, there are two dimensions to the calling of witnesses under s 283. The court must summon or recall witnesses whose evidence is \u201cessential to making a just decision in the case\u201d (see s 283(2) of the CPC). Otherwise, the calling of additional witnesses is a matter of judicial discretion as set out in s 283(1).', '36\\u2003The applicant\u2019s third argument before the Judge was that the DJ had fallen afoul of s 283(2). The Judge disagreed. Whether the applicant \u201cought reasonably to have known\u201d was a matter of the applicant\u2019s state of mind. Anything which Mr Tsai and Mr Huang said or did would only be relevant to the applicant\u2019s guilt to the extent that they had influenced the applicant\u2019s state of mind. If so, those matters should have been mentioned by the applicant in his testimony but they were not. There was also considerable doubt as to the veracity of the evidence that these two witnesses would give (HC GD at [124]\u2013[126]).', '37\\u2003However, the Judge accepted that Mr Tsai\u2019s and Mr Huang\u2019s evidence was clearly not entirely irrelevant to the case in that it was intended to corroborate the applicant\u2019s account of how he obtained the Passport. The DJ did not appreciate fully the need to also consider whether there was a need to call these witnesses under the general discretion in s 283(1) of the CPC. The Judge noted that the DJ\u2019s failure to exercise her discretion under s 283(1) was not a ground relied upon by the applicant for appellate intervention before her. Nevertheless, even if she were of the view that the DJ had erred in excluding evidence which she should have allowed, that would not have been dispositive of the appeal before her. The Judge referred to s 169 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (\u201cEvidence Act\u201d) and to AOF v Public Prosecutor [2012] 3 SLR 34 (\u201cAOF\u201d) and concluded that the evidence before the court justified amply the upholding of the applicant\u2019s conviction anyway (HC GD at [127]\u2013[132]). Accordingly, the Judge convicted the applicant on the single amended s 47(6) Passports Act charge as framed by her pursuant to s 390(4) of the CPC (HC GD at [154]).', '38\\u2003Turning to the appeal against sentence, the Judge rejected the applicant\u2019s plea for judicial mercy on account of his medical conditions and his contention that imprisonment would carry a high risk of endangering his life. In respect of the single amended s 47(6) Passports Act charge, the Judge held that a sentence of 18 months\u2019 imprisonment was appropriate in all the circumstances, taking into account the long period of time over which the applicant had committed the offence. She reduced the individual sentences for the Immigration Act charges from two months to six weeks\u2019 imprisonment. She ordered the sentence for the amended s 47(6) Passports Act charge to run consecutively with the sentences for two of the Immigration Act charges, resulting in an aggregate sentence of 18 months and 12 weeks\u2019 imprisonment (HC GD at [161]\u2013[176]).'"}

Both the Vedanta Arbitration and the Cairn Arbitration were brought under the Agreement between the Government of the Republic of India and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for the Promotion and Protection of Investments (14 March 1994), (entered into force on 6 January 1995) (\u201cthe India-UK BIT\u201d). They were administered by the Permanent Court of Arbitration and conducted pursuant to the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law 1976 (\u201cthe UNCITRAL Rules\u201d).', '7\\u2003Given the potential overlap between the Cairn Arbitration and the Vedanta Arbitration, the appellant was concerned about the risk of inconsistent findings by the two tribunals. Thus, the appellant sought to implement a regime to permit cross-disclosure of documents between the two arbitrations.', '8\\u2003In the Vedanta Arbitration, the appellant initially proposed that the UNCITRAL Rules on Transparency in Treaty-based Investor-State Arbitration (\u201cthe UNCITRAL Transparency Rules\u201d) be applied. When the respondent was not agreeable to this proposal, the appellant filed an application to the tribunal in the Vedanta Arbitration (\u201cthe Vedanta Tribunal\u201d) requesting, in effect, that the Vedanta Tribunal implement the UNCITRAL Transparency Rules. Both parties then made full submissions on this issue to the Vedanta Tribunal.', '9\\u2003Having considered the parties\u2019 submissions, the Vedanta Tribunal rendered its decision on the appropriate cross-disclosure regime in Procedural Order No 3 dated 9 May 2018 (\u201cVPO 3\u201d). In developing this cross-disclosure regime, the Vedanta Tribunal considered three sources of law: (a) the UNCITRAL Rules; (b) the India-UK BIT and public international law; and (c) the law of the seat, ie, Singapore law. In relation to the first two sources of law, the Vedanta Tribunal concluded that there was no general obligation of confidentiality under the UNCITRAL Rules and the India-UK BIT, although \u201cthere [was] a recognised public interest in investment treaty arbitrations and \u2026 an interest in allowing greater transparency of such proceedings\u201d.', '10\\u2003In relation to Singapore law, the Vedanta Tribunal cited the High Court\u2019s decision in AAY and others v AAZ [2011] 1 SLR 1093 (\u201cAAY\u201d) and found that an implied obligation of confidentiality applied in every arbitration governed by Singapore procedural law, subject to several exceptions. One such exception was where the public interest or the interests of justice required disclosure. Applying this exception, the Vedanta Tribunal developed a \u201cnew independent exception \u2026 specifically to cover investment treaty arbitrations\u201d. In the Vedanta Tribunal\u2019s view, such an exception could be applied together with its inherent power under Art 15.1 of the UNCITRAL Rules to \u201cdesign a confidentiality regime customized for the particular circumstances of the case\u201d. This resulted in the pronouncement of the following cross-disclosure regime:', '11\\u2003Following the issuance of VPO 3, the appellant applied on two occasions to the Vedanta Tribunal for cross-disclosure of certain documents from the Vedanta Arbitration into the Cairn Arbitration.', '12\\u2003First, on 14 May 2018, the appellant applied to disclose the following documents: (a) a decision issued by the Vedanta Tribunal on 27 December 2017 regarding the appellant\u2019s jurisdictional objections (\u201cthe Partial Award\u201d); (b) memorials and related materials, with accompanying evidence; and (c) the transcripts of the hearings held in the Vedanta Arbitration relating to the Partial Award. On 21 June 2018, the Vedanta Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 6 (\u201cVPO 6\u201d) allowing only the disclosure of the Partial Award.', '13\\u2003Second, on 26 August 2018, the appellant made another application to disclose a portion of the transcript in the Vedanta Arbitration which recorded the parties\u2019 submissions on jurisdiction. This was rejected by the Vedanta Tribunal on 11 September 2018 in Procedural Order No 7 (\u201cVPO 7\u201d).', '14\\u2003On 10 August 2018, after the Vedanta Tribunal had issued VPO 6 and while waiting for the Vedanta Tribunal to issue VPO 7, the appellant filed HC\/OS 980\/2018 (\u201cOS 980\u201d) in the High Court, seeking the following declarations:'"}

The respondent, like SRC, sold its spam control services to the appellant and received commission in return.

The facts have been dealt with in detail in the District Judge\u2019s decision (see Public Prosecutor v Tang Keng Lai and another [2020] SGDC 39 and 40), and we do not propose to go through them again here. It suffices for us to state that the offences concerned the submission of quotations for items of work which were backdated to give the impression that they had been issued when the projects were ongoing. The quotations were also written in such a way as to give the impression that Thong Huat Brothers (Pte) Ltd (\u201cThong Huat\u201d) had given the lowest quotation and had then completed those works, which covered up the fact that Thong Huat had overcharged Prisons for these items.', '4\\u2003The District Judge concluded after trial that the applicant, a Prisons officer at the material time, was aware of the plan to submit backdated quotations and had agreed to it. In response to the applicant\u2019s argument that the co-conspirators who were called as Prosecution witnesses had testified that they were unaware that the documents were \u201cforged\u201d, the District Judge accepted the Prosecution\u2019s submission that there was evidence of an agreement to submit backdated quotations, which sufficed to constitute an offence under s 471 of the Penal Code. As will be seen, this point was renewed before the High Court and, subsequently, before us in the present application. The District Judge convicted the applicant of the 16 proceeded charges and sentenced him to a total of eight months\u2019 imprisonment.', '5\\u2003Dissatisfied with this outcome, the applicant appealed to the High Court. He again argued that the Prosecution\u2019s witnesses had agreed in cross-examination that there was no conspiracy or agreement to submit forged documents. The High Court judge (\u201cthe Judge\u201d) disagreed, finding no contradiction because the witnesses had reaffirmed in re-examination that there was an agreement to submit backdated quotations, which amounted to forged documents. The Judge upheld the District Judge\u2019s decisions on conviction and sentence.

{"casename":"2021_SGCA_55","fact":"'4\\u2003The facts are uncomplicated and uncontested. The Appellant resided with his parents in their HDB flat in Bedok (\u201cthe Flat\u201d). On the day of the incident, 13 November 2015, his mother, Mdm Toh Meow Siang (\u201cMdm Toh\u201d) observed that the Appellant was not his usual self and not in a good state. As such, prior to leaving the Flat at approximately 2.30pm, Mdm Toh told the Deceased to \u201ckeep the keys from [the Appellant] and to keep watch over him and not allow him to go out\u201d. The Flat\u2019s gate was padlocked when she left.', '5\\u2003When Mdm Toh returned at around 5.00pm, the gate was still padlocked. Mdm Toh saw the Deceased lying supine on the floor with his head in a pool of blood. The Appellant was seated on the sofa facing the Deceased\u2019s body. Mdm Toh ran out of the Flat to seek help. Two of her neighbours, Mr Chua Kee Pau (\u201cChua\u201d) and Mr Mohamad Zin bin Abdul Karim (\u201cZin\u201d), came to her aid. Zin called for an ambulance.', '6\\u2003When Mdm Toh returned to the Flat, she shouted at the Appellant \u201cas to why he killed his father\u201d. At that point, the Appellant walked towards the Deceased. He straddled the Deceased, \u201cplaced both his hands on the deceased\u2019s upper chest, just below the throat area and at the collar bone area\u201d. Zin, who saw the Appellant sitting on the Deceased\u2019s stomach, pulled Mdm Toh away and escorted her to the corridor outside the Flat. There, Chua and Zin stayed with Mdm Toh as they waited for help to arrive.', '7\\u2003Three paramedics, Lee Yan Lin Zaneta (\u201cZaneta\u201d), Muhammad Farhan bin Kasim (\u201cFarhan\u201d) and Muhammad Farid bin Abdol Rahim (\u201cFarid\u201d) arrived at around 5.19pm. Upon arrival, the paramedics noted that the Deceased had a heart rate of 80 beats per minute (\u201cbpm\u201d). Zaneta certified the unresponsive Deceased to have a score of \u201c3\u201d on the Glasgow Coma Scale. This scale measures a subject\u2019s responsiveness from a scale of \u201c3\u201d to \u201c15\u201d with \u201c3\u201d being the lowest responsiveness.', '8\\u2003Zaneta noted that the Deceased was making a \u201csnoring-like\u201d sound. This was a sign that there was an obstruction in his airway. Zaneta therefore inserted an Oral Pharyngeal Airway device (\u201cOPA\u201d), and the sound stopped. Prior to inserting the OPA, Zaneta wiped off blood clots outside the Deceased\u2019s mouth. She did not see any visible secretion of blood in the mouth, but she \u201cfound his heart beat to be slow and weak\u201d. This signified to her that \u201cthere [was an] issue with [the] heart already\u201d.', '9\\u2003While Farid was sent to retrieve supplies from the ambulance downstairs, Farhan observed Zaneta as she inserted the OPA into the Deceased\u2019s mouth. He noticed that there was no blood gushing out of the mouth, nor any accumulation of blood inside the mouth.', '10\\u2003Zaneta, Farhan and the Appellant were the only other people in the Flat while the Deceased was being attended to. After Zaneta inserted the OPA, the Appellant stood up from the sofa and moved towards the Deceased. He sat on the Deceased\u2019s abdominal region and placed his hands on the Deceased\u2019s throat. In keeping with their protocols on safety, Zaneta and Farhan stepped backwards, away from the Deceased and the Appellant. Zaneta shouted at the Appellant to stop and to move away. The Appellant ignored her and continued to strangle the Deceased while mumbling \u201cwo yao ta shi\u201d (\u201cI want him to die\u201d in Mandarin). Eventually, the Appellant stood up and returned to the sofa.', '11\\u2003The ambulance departed for the hospital at about 5.45pm. At approximately 5.51pm, the Deceased stopped breathing and his pulse was faint at around 36 bpm. His pulse subsequently weakened to about 24 bpm just prior to arriving at Changi General Hospital.', '12\\u2003Dr Yow Zhi Wen (\u201cDr Yow\u201d) attended to the Deceased when he arrived at the hospital at around 5.56pm. Dr Yow reported that the Deceased had no pulse and no vital signs, and assessed him to be in a critical condition. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (\u201cCPR\u201d) was immediately carried out and a video laryngoscope was inserted. Dr Yow then saw a large amount of accumulated blood inside the Deceased\u2019s mouth and in his throat. Dr Yow also observed a \u201ctransverse laceration of tongue\u201d measuring about 1cm in length. Finally, he noted bruising and swelling over the Deceased\u2019s neck, and assorted injuries on the face, eyes and chin. The Deceased was pronounced dead at 6.37pm on 13 November 2015.', '13\\u2003The Appellant was examined by two psychiatrists in the aftermath of the incident and the lead up to trial. Both were of the view that the Appellant was suffering from schizophrenia and was probably of unsound mind at the time of the offence.', '14\\u2003The autopsy report dated 13 January 2016 by the forensic pathologist, Associate Professor Teo Eng Swee (\u201cAP Teo\u201d), stated that the Deceased\u2019s cause of death was \u201cSTRANGULATION AND ASPIRATION OF BLOOD\u201d [emphasis in original]. Aspiration of blood refers to the inhalation of blood into the lungs. Strangulation is the mechanical compression of airways causing suffocation.', '15\\u2003In relation to the strangulation, the autopsy report identified numerous bruises and abrasions on the neck, coupled with extensive haemorrhaging on multiple regions of subcutaneous soft tissue and muscles there. There were also multiple laryngeal fractures (the larynx being the area of the throat containing the vocal cords and used for breathing, swallowing and talking).', '16\\u2003In relation to the aspiration of blood, the autopsy report pointed to a transmural rupture of the tongue with the following communicating superior and inferior lacerations: first, a laceration measuring 2cm long over the midline inferior aspect of the tongue, 1cm from the tip of the tongue and second, a laceration shaped like the Mercedes-Benz logo, measuring 2.5cm x 2.5cm x 2.5cm over the anterior part of the superior aspect of the tongue (\u201cthe Mercedes Laceration\u201d). The two lacerations (collectively, \u201cthe Tongue Laceration\u201d) were connected, hence the single \u201ctransmural rupture of the tongue\u201d (ie, an injury that penetrates the entire wall of the tongue).', '17\\u2003AP Teo clarified in his further report dated 21 January 2019 that there was no direct cause-effect relationship between the aspiration of blood and strangulation in the Deceased\u2019s case. Further, the aspiration of blood was not a result of the strangulation and the main source of the blood was likely the Tongue Laceration. Tongue lacerations are commonly caused when a fall or blow to the face occurs when the tongue is between the teeth, and the shape and pattern of the Tongue Laceration was consistent with a punch to the face.', '18\\u2003The Judge agreed with AP Teo that the cause of the Deceased\u2019s death was aspiration and strangulation. The Defence had not adduced any medical evidence to the contrary and, in the Judge\u2019s view, failed to raise any reasonable doubt as to the veracity of the autopsy report or show that the Deceased\u2019s death could be attributed to any other causes. The Judge further held that the Appellant\u2019s actions were the only rational explanation for the Deceased\u2019s death when all the circumstances of the case were considered.', '19\\u2003As the parties were agreed that the Appellant was of unsound mind at the material time such that s 84 of the Penal Code would serve as a complete defence to the Appellant\u2019s charge, the Judge acquitted him of the charge and made a finding that the Appellant had committed the act of causing the Deceased\u2019s death pursuant to s 251 of the CPC (\u201cs 251 CPC\u201d). She also made an order to commit the Appellant to safe custody pursuant to s 252(1) of the CPC.', '20\\u2003On appeal, the Defence argued that the Undisputed Acts by the Appellant had not caused the Deceased\u2019s death and submitted that the finding under s 251 of the CPC should be that the Appellant had committed the act of causing grievous hurt rather than death. We will deal with the Defence\u2019s three main arguments below (see [28] onwards), but first, we explore a preliminary point on the operation of, and interplay between, ss 251 and 252 of the CPC (\u201css 251 and 252 CPC\u201d) and s 84 of the Penal Code (\u201cs 84 PC\u201d).'"}
{"casename":"2021_SGCA_56","fact":"'2\\u2003The brief facts of the case are as follows. The respondent bank, CIMB Bank Bhd (\u201cCIMB\u201d) extended trade financing facilities to Panoil Petroleum Pte Ltd (\u201cPanoil\u201d) by way of an all-monies debenture which provided for the respondent\u2019s security interest in Panoil\u2019s book debts. In July and August 2017, Panoil entered into contracts to sell marine fuel (\u201cthe Contracts\u201d) to the appellant, Italmatic Tyre and Retreading Equipment (Asia) Pte Ltd (\u201cItalmatic\u201d), pursuant to which it issued seven invoices. The sale confirmations issued in respect of the Contracts incorporated Panoil\u2019s standard terms and conditions (\u201cPanoil T&C\u201d). Clause 8.2 of the Panoil T&C obliged Panoil\u2019s customers to pay Panoil \u201cwithout deduction, set-off or counterclaim\u201d.', '3\\u2003A set-off agreement was entered into between Italmatic and Panoil dated 1 July 2015 (\u201cthe 2015 set-off agreement\u201d), which allowed either party to set-off any \u201cundisputed\u201d debts owed to the other. When Panoil went into financial difficulties, CIMB issued a notice of assignment dated 29 August 2017 to Italmatic in respect of the debts owed by Italmatic to Panoil under the seven invoices, requiring Italmatic to make payment to CIMB instead of Panoil, and brought suit against Italmatic to enforce that debt. Italmatic contended that the debt it owed Panoil under the seven invoices had been entirely set-off or alternatively cancelled.', '4\\u2003As regards the set-off defence, Italmatic\u2019s pleaded case was that on 13 August 2017 (prior to CIMB\u2019s notice of assignment), Panoil and Italmatic re-affirmed the 2015 set-off agreement and agreed to set-off the amounts \u201cowing by each other against the amounts owing to each other\u201d. In support, Italmatic relied on an exchange of letters on 13 August 2017 (\u201cthe 13 August 2017 Letters\u201d). In these letters, Italmatic proposed a set-off of the amounts it owed to Panoil in the terms contained in a net statement of accounts attached to its letter, which it described as a \u201ccontra statement\u201d. This showed a net amount of $2,100 owed by Panoil to Italmatic. Panoil responded by accepting the set-off.', '5\\u2003As regards the cancellation defence, Italmatic pleaded that on 17 August 2017, Eastern Pacific Tankers Sdn Bhd (\u201cEastern Pacific\u201d), to whom it resold the marine fuel which it had purchased from Panoil under the Contracts, sent a letter to Panoil, copying Italmatic, to notify Panoil to bill Eastern Pacific directly. On 18 August 2017, Panoil accepted Eastern Pacific\u2019s request by letter. We shall refer to these letters as \u201cthe August 2017 Cancellation Letters\u201d. On the same day, Italmatic purportedly cancelled the seven invoices on 18 August 2017 and notified Panoil accordingly by an email.', '6\\u2003CIMB disputed the authenticity of the 2015 set-off agreement, the 13 August 2017 Letters and the August 2017 Cancellation Letters and put Italmatic to strict proof. A Notice of Non-Admission was also served by CIMB to dispute the authenticity of these documents.', '7\\u2003The Judge found that while the 2015 set-off agreement was authentic, it was inconsistent with cl 8.2 of the Panoil T&C which had been incorporated into the Contracts. Clause 8.2 precluded Italmatic from exercising its right of set-off under the 2015 set-off agreement by the 13 August 2017 Letters. In any case, Italmatic did not exercise such a right as the 13 August 2017 Letters were, in the Judge\u2019s view, fabrications. The set-off defence therefore failed. Similarly, the Judge held that the cancellation defence failed as he found that the August 2017 Cancellation Letters were also fabrications on the evidence before him. Accordingly, the Judge held that CIMB succeeded in its claim against Italmatic for the debt outstanding under the seven invoices.', '8\\u2003The appeal therefore turns on whether the Judge had erred in rejecting both the set-off defence and the cancellation defence.'"}

Ranjit alighted from the bus and approached the applicant\u2019s car with a plastic bag in one hand. Through the open window at the front passenger side of the applicant\u2019s car, Ranjit placed the plastic bag containing the drugs on the front passenger seat. The applicant then passed Ranjit a package and thereafter, both men went their separate ways. Both were arrested subsequently.', '5\\u2003The plastic bag contained five plastic packets. These five packets contained not less than 1,359.9g of substance, which was analysed and found to contain not less than 35.21g of diamorphine (or heroin): Public Prosecutor v Ranjit Singh Gill Menjeet Singh and another [2017] 3 SLR 66 at [11] (\u201cHigh Court judgment\u201d).', '6\\u2003The applicant admitted that he knew that the plastic bag contained heroin, that he intended to distribute the heroin and that he was to weigh and repack the heroin. However, he claimed that he was a mere courier acting on the instructions of one Abang and that he provided valuable information to the Central Narcotics Bureau (\u201cCNB\u201d). The High Court convicted the applicant on the trafficking charge. The Judge found that the applicant had admitted to every element of the trafficking charge. The drugs were in his possession at the time of arrest. The applicant admitted that he knew the bag contained heroin and that he was going to use the electronic weighing scales and empty plastic bags found in his residence to repack the heroin for distribution. He would be paid for each pound of heroin that he repacked and delivered. Although he sought subsequently to clarify that he had assumed that the plastic bag contained heroin because the two previous consignments that he had received contained heroin, it was clear that he had actual knowledge of the nature of the drugs. In any event, he had not rebutted the presumption of knowledge in s 18(2) of the MDA: High Court judgment at [51]. Separately, Ranjit was convicted on an offence of trafficking under s 5(1)(a) of the MDA.', '7\\u2003On the issue of sentence, the High Court noted that the applicant was not issued a certificate of substantive assistance: High Court judgment at [61]. The Judge also found that the applicant had not established on the balance of probabilities that he was only a courier. This was because he had, as a matter of routine, repacked drugs into smaller bundles. The applicant therefore could not satisfy the requirements for alternative sentencing under s 33B(2)(a)\u2013(b) of the MDA and he was sentenced to death accordingly. Ranjit was found to be a courier and he had a certificate of substantive assistance. Accordingly, he was sentenced to life imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane under s 33B(1)(a) of the MDA.', '8\\u2003On appeal, the applicant argued that the Judge erred in: (a) finding that the applicant had failed to rebut the presumption of trafficking under s 17 of the MDA; and (b) failing to find that the applicant was a courier within the meaning of s 33B(2)(a) of the MDA.', '9\\u2003On 26 March 2020, the applicant\u2019s appeal against conviction and sentence was dismissed by the Court of Appeal: Mohammad Farid bin Batra v Public Prosecutor and another appeal and other matters [2020] 1 SLR 907 (\u201cCA judgment\u201d). The applicant\u2019s appeal against his conviction was untenable because, based on the evidence, it was \u201cbeyond dispute that he intended to traffic the drugs\u201d: CA judgment at [86]. In addition, the applicant\u2019s submissions on appeal that he had not formed the intention to traffic the heroin when he was arrested because he had not received instructions from Abang as to whether he should return the drugs to Abang or to deliver them to Abang\u2019s clients was found to be unmeritorious: at [90]. This was because the applicant did not adduce any evidence at the trial to establish that the heroin in his possession was for purposes other than delivery or distribution.', '10\\u2003However, the CA judgment disagreed with the High Court judgment and concluded that the applicant was a mere courier within the meaning of s 33B(2)(a) of the MDA for this particular transaction. This was because Abang had not given any instructions as to what the applicant should do with the heroin and evidence of repacking drugs in prior transactions did not mean that the trafficker could not be a courier for that particular transaction: CA judgment at [94]. Nevertheless, since the applicant did not receive a certificate of substantive assistance, the court ordered the mandatory death penalty imposed by the High Court to stand.', '11\\u2003A few months after the CA judgment was delivered, the Public Prosecutor decided to issue a certificate of substantive assistance to the applicant. The applicant then applied in CA\/CM 23\/2020 to request the Court of Appeal to exercise its inherent power to review its decision on sentence. On 7 September 2020, the Court of Appeal resentenced the applicant to life imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane on account of the applicant having been found to be a courier for the transaction in question and having received the certificate of substantive assistance.'"}
{"casename":"2021_SGCA_59","fact":"'10\\u2003To say that the case has had a long tail is to put it mildly. The genesis of the dispute can be traced to 31 October 2007 when Ms Noor Azlin bte Abdul Rahman (\u201cMs Azlin\u201d) visited the Accident and Emergency Department of the respondent, Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd (\u201cA&E\u201d and \u201cCGH\u201d, respectively), complaining of lower chest pain and shortness of breath. Ms Azlin subsequently visited CGH three more times (specifically, on 15 November 2007, 29 April 2010 and 31 July 2011). On all four occasions, X-rays and other medical procedures revealed an opacity in Ms Azlin\u2019s lungs. It was only on 16 February 2012 that a biopsy of the growth of abnormal tissues (ie, the nodule) in Ms Azlin\u2019s lungs revealed that the nodule was malignant.', '11\\u2003Ms Azlin commenced legal proceedings against CGH on 20 January 2015 in HC\/S 59\/2015 (\u201cSuit 59\u201d). Her claim was dismissed by the Judge in Noor Azlin bte Abdul Rahman v Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd and others [2019] 3 SLR 1063 (\u201cthe first HC Judgment\u201d) after a 28-day trial (\u201cthe Original Hearing\u201d). Ms Azlin appealed and her appeal in CA\/CA 47\/2018 (\u201cthe Original Appeal\u201d) was allowed in part by the Court of Appeal in the first CA Judgment.', '12\\u2003The most relevant findings in the first CA Judgment can be summarised briefly:', '(a)\\u2003First, Ms Azlin had shown, on a balance of probabilities, that she had lung cancer by July 2011 (see the first CA Judgment at [105] and [114]).', '(b)\\u2003Second, CGH had breached its duty of care to Ms Azlin by failing to ensure that there was proper follow-up in her case even though the radiological reports from April 2010 and July 2011 recommended follow-up on the opacity in the right mid-zone of her chest. There were also serious inadequacies in CGH\u2019s patient management system (see the first CA Judgment at [96]\u2013[101]).', '(c)\\u2003Third, CGH\u2019s negligence caused a delay in diagnosing Ms Azlin with lung cancer (see the first CA Judgment at [116]) which, more likely than not, caused her to suffer from nodal metastasis and all the consequences that may have followed (see the first CA Judgment at [122]).', '(d)\\u2003Fourth and finally, the case was remitted back to the Judge to assess and quantify the loss and damage occasioned to Ms Azlin due to the delayed diagnosis of lung cancer (see the first CA Judgment at [124]\u2013[125]).', '13\\u2003As will be seen later, it is of particular relevance to OS 9 that Suit 59 was not bifurcated. This meant that while the Original Appeal focussed on the Judge\u2019s finding that CGH was not liable for the losses occasioned to Ms Azlin, a portion of the evidence (albeit somewhat lacking) before the Court of Appeal was relevant to the quantification of her losses.', '14\\u2003Ms Azlin passed away on 1 April 2019 from lung cancer, a month after the first CA Judgment was released. After her passing, the second appellant, Mr Azmi bin Abdul Rahman (\u201cMr Azmi\u201d), her older brother, was added as a party to continue the action in his capacity as executor of her estate (\u201cthe Estate\u201d) .', '15\\u2003The Judge heard the parties on damages over a 6-day trial in August and September 2020 (\u201cthe AOD Hearing\u201d) and released the Judgment on 19 January 2021. She awarded the Estate a sum of $326,620.61. This was broken down as follows:', '(a)\\u2003$304,000 in general damages comprising $250,000 for pain and suffering and loss of amenity, and $54,000 for the dependency claim; and', '(b)\\u2003$22,620.61 for special damages comprising $19,620.61 for medical expenses and $3,000 for transport expenses.', '16\\u2003Dissatisfied, the appellants filed a notice of appeal in AD\/CA 22\/2021 on 18 February 2021 (ie, the present forum for the Appeal).

We do not propose to rehearse the details here; nor do we set out in any detail the correspondence that transpired between the appellant and the respondent following the appellant\u2019s complaint, as this has been sufficiently set out in the Judge\u2019s decision below. It may be noted that the present appeal was concerned only with the remedy that the Judge ordered after he found that the Council had acted irrationally.

It was wholly owned by Sun Electric (Singapore) Pte Ltd (\u201cSESPL\u201d), which was 99.9% owned by Sun Electric Pte Ltd (\u201cSEPL\u201d). One Mr Matthew Peloso (\u201cMr Peloso\u201d) who owned 95% of SEPL\u2019s shares was the sole director of the appellant.', '4\\u2003The respondent, RCMA Asia Pte Ltd, was another Singapore company which was in the business of trading in energy.', '5\\u2003The appellant was a licensee and participant in a scheme, known as the \u201cForward Sales Contract Scheme\u201d (\u201cFSC Scheme\u201d), introduced by the Energy Market Authority of Singapore (\u201cEMAS\u201d). Under this scheme, the appellant was required to carry out certain market-making obligations in the electricity futures market in respect of a volume of futures trade, in return for incentive payments by SP Services Ltd. Sometime in late 2015, the appellant and the respondent entered into an agreement for the respondent to assume the appellant\u2019s market-making obligations in exchange for a 70% share of all incentive payments received by the appellant under the FSC Scheme (\u201cthe Agreement\u201d). From December 2015 to January 2018, the appellant paid the respondent its 70% share of the incentive payments. Thereafter, the appellant stopped all payments to the respondent.', '6\\u2003On 22 February 2018, the respondent filed HC\/S 191\/2018 (\u201cSuit 191\u201d) to claim from the appellant: (a) 70% of all incentive payments that the appellant may continue to receive under the FSC Scheme; and (b) repayment of an alleged loan that was granted to the appellant pursuant to the Agreement (alleged to be in the sum of $933,334.49). On the same day, the respondent applied for an interlocutory injunction against the appellant. After an ex parte hearing on 26 February 2018, Chua Lee Ming J granted an interim injunction in terms, restraining the appellant, its directors, officers, employees and\/or agents from disposing of, dealing with or diminishing the value of the respondent\u2019s 70% share of the incentive payments, including those to be received (\u201cRCMA Injunction\u201d). This interim injunction was extended after a contested hearing on 11 May 2018, on the condition that the respondent meet its market-making obligations under the Agreement. Meanwhile, the appellant entered its defence in Suit 191.', '7\\u2003By July 2018, the respondent had completed its market-making obligations. By August 2018, the appellant had received all remaining incentive payments in its Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Limited (\u201cOCBC\u201d) account. The incentive payments (totalling $9,333,333.60) were deposited into the OCBC account by six instalment payments of $1,555,555.60 made from January to August 2018. Of this total sum, $6,533,333.52, being 70% of $9,333,333.60, was frozen on the terms of the RCMA Injunction. On the whole, the appellant had complied with the RCMA Injunction by routinely withdrawing only 30% of the incentive payments, leaving 70% in the account. However, the appellant had also made two exceptional withdrawals such that the amount remaining in the OCBC account as at November 2018 fell below the enjoined amount to around $6m.', '8\\u2003Between late November and end December 2018, all remaining moneys in the OCBC account were transferred to the appellant\u2019s DBS Bank Ltd (\u201cDBS\u201d) account, via three separate transactions (\u201cDBS transfers\u201d). In total, a sum of $6,091,555.39 was taken out of OCBC and placed in DBS.', '9\\u2003In January 2019, a UAE-incorporated company, Kashish Worldwide FZE (\u201cKashish\u201d), commenced a suit in the High Court against the appellant. It claimed $6,995,755.78 pursuant to contracts for differences allegedly executed between Kashish and the appellant. The appellant did not enter an appearance and Kashish obtained judgment in default of appearance against the appellant for the claimed sum, interest and costs.', '10\\u2003In February 2019, Kashish applied to garnish the DBS account, and obtained a garnishee order for DBS to show cause. A copy of this court order was served on the appellant. In March 2019, the court granted Kashish\u2019s garnishee application and ordered DBS to disburse the funds in the DBS account to Kashish in partial satisfaction of the judgment debt owed to it by the appellant. This was duly executed by DBS. As a result, the DBS account was emptied out.', '11\\u2003In August 2019, citing financial woes, the appellant applied for judicial management (\u201cJM\u201d) and thereafter, in September 2019, it asked for an interim judicial management order (\u201cIJM\u201d). The respondent objected to both applications. The IJM application was dismissed in September 2019, with costs of $3,500 ordered to be paid by the appellant to the respondent. The JM application was similarly dismissed in October 2019 and the court ordered further costs of $8,000 to be paid by the appellant to the respondent. These costs amounted to $11,500 in total.', '12\\u2003On 21 November 2019, the respondent\u2019s solicitors sent a statutory demand to the appellant\u2019s registered office, requiring the appellant to make payment of $11,568.88, being the amount of the costs awarded and accrued interest.', '13\\u2003On 11 December 2019, the appellant\u2019s solicitors responded to the statutory demand by letter, admitting that the appellant owed the respondent $11,500 and interest thereon accruing at the rate of 5.33% per annum. The appellant proposed to make payment in instalments: the first instalment of $3,000 on 13 December 2019; the second instalment of $3,000 on 27 December 2019; and the final instalment of $5,500, as well as all accrued interest, on 10 January 2020.

As the Project involved works at Changi Airport, further up the contractual chain, there was a main contract based upon the Public Sector Standard Conditions of Contract (\u201cPSSCOC\u201d), with the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (\u201cCAAS\u201d) as principal. There was also a Superintending Officer, Surbana Jurong Infrastructure Pte Ltd (\u201cSO\u201d), who had the final say over important matters like interim payments, variations, extensions of time, choice and approval of material, etc. There are appropriate references in the Subcontract and its Annexes to the CAAS, SO and the main contract. For completeness, ZK was itself a subcontractor in the Project.', '6\\u2003The Project was divided into two phases, Phase 1 (an 8-storey Equipment Building) and Phase 2A (a 2-storey Annex Building, excluding an Airport Emergency Service Watchroom). The Subcontract was expressed to commence immediately and, pursuant to cl 4 of the Subcontract, the scheduled dates for the completion of Phases 1 and 2A of the Project were to be no later than 31 July 2017 and 20 February 2017 respectively. 3', 'Pursuant to cl 6 of the Subcontract, DGE was liable to pay liquidated damages for late completion of the Subcontract Works, calculated at the rate of S$1,800 per day of delay for Phase 1, and S$800 per day of delay for Phase 2A. Clause 6 also provided that ZK was \u201centitled to deduct or set-off against any monies due to [DGE] under the Subcontract\u2026 or to recover such amount or amounts from the [Subcontract] as a debt; for such damages as incurred by [DGE] arising from such delay\u201d. 4', '7\\u2003We now proceed to briefly narrate the events which led to the present proceedings between the parties.

We merely record what we see in contemporaneous documents put before us and we have borne in mind that the picture is not complete. All these allegations will no doubt be fully explored during the course of the legal proceedings between the parties, and we make reference only to the details that are necessary for our purposes.', '8\\u2003There is little evidence on the Project in its earlier stages. As noted above, the Subcontract provided for immediate commencement, ie, 7 November 2016, and fairly short completion dates. Not unexpectedly, the Subcontract also provided that the Subcontract Works were to be carried out strictly in accordance with the \u201cMaster Programme\u201d (of the main contractor). There were 16 payment certificates before PC 17, and counsel for DGE confirmed that DGE had not taken out any adjudication application to enforce interim payments until PC 17.', '9\\u2003However, based on the documents before us, we can surmise that the disagreements between the parties most likely began in early 2018. There is correspondence showing allegations from DGE that, from that period onwards, there were delays in its completion of the Subcontract Works because of late approvals, changes to specifications, unsigned variations and slow or inadequate payment by ZK. 5', 'DGE also claimed there was \u201czero\u201d certification for work it had completed up until Progress Claim 12, and a \u201cnegative\u201d certification in respect of Progress Claim 13. 6', 'On the other hand, there is evidence that ZK made advance payments or loans to DGE with repayment being effected through set-offs or partial set-offs against certified progress payments and amounts due to DGE. 7', 'ZK also exhibited a number of emails complaining of DGE\u2019s delays. For example, in an email dated 16 February 2017, ZK complained of, inter alia, DGE\u2019s late delivery of cladding material and its slow bracket and runner installations, and requested for DGE to catch up with its work. 8', 'In another email dated 1 March 2018, ZK complained that DGE had yet to complete outstanding works despite ZK making it advance payments of S$50,000 on 11 August 2017, S$22,000 on 1 February 2018 and S$30,000 on 13 February 2018 to support DGE\u2019s purchase of material and to assist DGE in paying its staff and workers in advance. 9', 'In the same email, ZK also noted that DGE had submitted Payment Claim 11 late on 8 February 2018 even though it had been due on 28 January 2018.

{"casename":"2021_SGCA_62","fact":"'3\\u2003The respondent, Chiu Teng Construction Co Pte Ltd (\u201cCTC\u201d), is a company in the building construction business. It was the main contractor for a project for upgrading and refurbishment works at the Nanyang Technological University (\u201cthe Project\u201d). QBH Pte Ltd (\u201cQBH\u201d), presently in liquidation, was also a company in the building construction business. CTC engaged QBH as a subcontractor for the Project on 1 August 2016 under a subcontract (the \u201cSubcontract\u201d). The appellant, AXA Insurance Pte Ltd (\u201cAXA\u201d), is an insurance company. At QBH\u2019s request, AXA issued Performance Bond No LBP\/P1821315 dated 25 July 2016 (\u201cthe Bond\u201d) in favour of CTC. The Bond was for the amount of $397,687.50.', '4\\u2003In the interests of clarity, we begin by defining some of the terms we employ in the course of our analysis. We refer to (a) the party in whose favour a bond is issued as the \u201cbeneficiary\u201d; (b) the party who requests the issuance of the bond and who has an account with the party issuing the bond as the \u201caccount party\u201d; and (c) the party issuing the bond as the \u201cissuer\u201d. We also refer to the contract between the beneficiary and the account party as the \u201cprincipal\u201d or \u201cunderlying\u201d contract, the performance of which is secured by the performance bond, to distinguish it from any contract between the account party and the issuer and from the bond itself. In these terms, CTC was the beneficiary, QBH was the account party, AXA was the issuer, and the Subcontract was the principal or underlying contract.', '5\\u2003The dispute in this case centred on AXA\u2019s obligation to pay under the Bond in response to CTC\u2019s call on the Bond, which in turn was predicated on CTC\u2019s claims for breaches of the Subcontract by QBH. To properly situate the present dispute, it is necessary to consider some background facts concerning the relationship between QBH and CTC.', '6\\u2003In the course of the Project, a dispute had arisen over QBH\u2019s Payment Claim No 23, which was served on CTC on 25 August 2018. Payment Claim No 23 sought payment of $1,108,739.94 for work done up to 25 August 2018. In Payment Response No 23 dated 4 September 2018, CTC asserted instead that QBH should pay $805,843.13 to CTC. On 14 September 2018, QBH submitted this dispute for adjudication under the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act (Cap 30B, 2006 Rev Ed) by way of an adjudication application. On 5 October 2018, the adjudicator determined in an Adjudication Determination that CTC owed QBH a sum of $386,856.21. On 30 October 2018, however, CTC served a Notice of Termination of the Subcontract on QBH.', '7\\u2003At around the same time as this dispute over Payment Claim No 23, CTC purported to call on the Bond on 14 September 2018 (\u201cthe First Call\u201d). On 9 October 2018, QBH commenced HC\/OS 1239\/2018 (\u201cOS 1239\/2018\u201d) to restrain AXA from making and CTC from receiving any payment under the Bond. On 23 April 2019, QBH was put into liquidation, pursuant to winding-up proceedings in HC\/CWU 318\/2018. This was filed by Dormakaba Singapore Pte Ltd which is unrelated to CTC. On 3 July 2019, the judge who heard OS 1239\/2018 (who was also the Judge below in this case) held that the Bond was an indemnity performance bond and that, as CTC had not provided evidence of actual loss, the First Call was defective. The Judge therefore granted the injunction sought.', '8\\u2003 On 18 February 2020, CTC wrote to QBH\u2019s liquidators, claiming that QBH had failed to complete the works required under the Subcontract and\/or had carried out defective works, and had therefore breached the Subcontract (the \u201c18 February Letter\u201d). Annexed to the 18 February Letter was a breakdown of CTC\u2019s claims against QBH, together with supporting documents. The total amount of losses claimed to have been suffered was $484,108.28. QBH\u2019s liquidators did not reply.', '9\\u2003On 13 March 2020, CTC wrote to AXA, purporting to call on the Bond again (\u201cthe Second Call\u201d), on the basis of the claims stated in the 18 February Letter. The Second Call was the subject of the dispute in this case. On 31 March 2020, AXA replied that the Second Call was defective and that it was not obliged to make payment.', '10\\u2003On 19 June 2020, CTC applied to the High Court in HC\/OS 603\/2020 (\u201cOS 603\/2020\u201d) for an order that AXA make payment of $397,687.50 to CTC pursuant to the Bond, and, further and\/or alternatively, a declaration that the Bond\u2019s validity was extended to 24 December 2020.'"}

Subsequently, in late 1990, the appellant and OST decided to collaborate to recover OST\u2019s share of Mr Ong\u2019s estate from Mdm Lim. The appellant thus withheld enforcement of the maintenance order.', '10\\u2003The monumental litigation that followed spanned from 1991 to the present, and may broadly be understood as a trilogy, as follows:', '(a)\\u2003The appellant\u2019s claim for a share of Mr Ong\u2019s estate.

He also executed a power of attorney to confer on the appellant powers to demand and sue the representatives of Mr Ong\u2019s estate for OST\u2019s share.', '12\\u2003On 21 September 1991, the appellant commenced OS 939 in OST\u2019s name against Mdm Lim, to claim a share of Mr Ong\u2019s estate. OST and the appellant were on the same side at this stage. Soon after, however, OST shifted his allegiance back to Mdm Lim. He claimed that he had received his entitlement under Mr Ong\u2019s estate, and instructed his lawyer to discontinue OS 939. Following this development, the appellant replaced OST as the plaintiff in OS 939, OST was added as the second defendant, and the proceedings were converted into one as if commenced by writ. Around the same time, the appellant restored the maintenance proceedings against OST.', '13\\u2003On 16 July 1996, Chao Hick Tin J (as he then was) delivered judgment on OS 939 in favour of the appellant: Jane Rebecca Ong v Lim Lie Hoa also known as Lim Le Hoa also known as Lily Arief Husni and another [1996] SGHC 140.

It was not disputed that \u201cAhmad\u201d was Reduan\u2019s relative, Ahmad Ashikin bin Ahmad Sulaiman, who resided in Malaysia. Tan knew Ahmad as they used to be colleagues. It was also common ground that Tan proceeded to collect a package containing cash from Reduan after receiving Ahmad\u2019s call. Tan then headed to Johor Bahru at around noon and handed the package containing cash to Ahmad. At that meeting, Ahmad handed him the Daia Box and told him to pass it to Reduan.

This was \nbecause the DJ had taken into account the Applicant\u2019s record of compounded \noffences as an aggravating factor in his decision. In comparison to Ong Heng \nChua, the Applicant was convicted of a less serious offence and a lower \ndisqualification period of less than 12 months should be imposed.

This resulted in his financial \ndetriment and should be a factor in deciding the length of the DQ Order.\nThe Prosecution\u2019s submissions\n24 The Prosecution argues that compounded offences do not amount to an \nacquittal. This is because:\n(a) A person may only be acquitted if he has been charged. There is \nno mention of an acquittal in s 135(1A) of the RTA or s 243(5) of the \nCPC, unlike in ss 241(5) and 242(4) of the CPC.\n(b) The observation in Rajamanikam Ramachandran v Chan Teck \nYuen and another [1998] SGHC 259 (\u201cRajamanikam Ramachandran\u201d) \nthat s 199(4) of the 1985 version of the Criminal Procedure Code \n(Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe 1985 CPC\u201d) (that composition amounts to \nan acquittal) has general application to all offences is no longer good \nlaw. Rajamanikam Ramachandran was decided before the RTA and \nCPC amendments.\n(c) Even with the introduction of s 199A of the 1985 CPC, dealing \nspecifically with offences outside of the Penal Code, there was no \nmention of acquittal. This was similarly the case for the RTA.\n(d) It is permissible to consider compounded offences even where \ndischarge amounting to an acquittal has been ordered, as Art 11(2) of \nthe Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (the \u201cConstitution\u201d) and \ns 244 of the CPC only bar a person from being tried again for the \noffence.\nVersion No 1: 01 Jul 2021 (10:04 hrs)\nTeo Seng Tiong v Public Prosecutor[2021] SGCA 65\n11(e) Section 139AA of the RTA is only a statutory recognition of the \ndiscretion that the courts already had.\n(f) Allowing a court to take compounded RTA offences into \nconsideration allows for a more holistic approach in assessing the level \nof specific deterrence necessary in the particular case.\n(g) An offer of composition constitutes an expression of opinion by \nthe relevant authority that the person is \u201creasonably suspected of having \ncommitted the offence\u201d. If the person accepts that offer, at the minimum \nhe has chosen not to dispute the authority\u2019s opinion. This was the \napproach taken in Lim Niah Liang and Ong Heng Chua.\n25 Nevertheless, going forward, compounded RTA offences should not be \nconsidered in sentencing for non-RTA offences without notice of this being \ngiven. The Prosecution accepts that compounding an offence may not amount \nto an admission of guilt and it would therefore only be fair that notice is given \nto the person, at the time when composition is offered, that the composition may \nbe taken into account as an aggravating factor. Such notice can be given through \nexpress statutory provision, the composition notice or any other reasonable \nmeans.\n26 Should the court decide that compounded offences should not be taken \ninto consideration in sentencing, such a change should only apply prospectively. \nThe position in case law has been consistent since Lim Niah Liang and to have \nthe changes apply prospectively would avoid wholly disruptive consequences.\n27 In any event, the Applicant\u2019s two-year DQ Order remains correct.

{"casename":"2021_SGCA_66","fact":"facts as well as context of the case before it. In the \npresent case, Hari was the only one who was with the Testator throughout in \nSingapore. The eldest brother, Daya, who resided in Canada after having been \nsent there for medical studies, had lost touch with the family and had only \nreconnected intermittently with them (including the Testator) since 1983, \nalthough he appointed solicitors to hold a watching brief for him during the trial \nin the High Court (see the Judgment at [7]). Whilst Ranjit claims to have assisted \nthe Testator with regard to the ancestral property in India, he was away in India \nfor many years and only returned to Singapore approximately a dozen years \nafter the Testator had paid for the Half Share of the Property that had been \nplaced in Hari\u2019s name. Further, although the will treated all three brothers \nequally, as the Judge noted, it had been signed two years before the registration \nof the Half Share and that one possible interpretation was that the Testator had \nsimply decided to provide for Hari apart from the will; in the Judge\u2019s view, \nRanjit\u2019s reliance on the will was therefore not as probative of the Testator\u2019s \nintent as he had argued and, as just noted, could even point in the other direction \n(see the Judgment at [33]). At this juncture, it is also important to note that the \noral testimony of the parties would have assisted the Judge in arriving at his \ndecision as there was no clear documentary evidence that resolved this case one \nway or the other. In this regard, the Judge had determined that Hari\u2019s residence \nand contact with the Testator in Singapore was more than just a literal \nhappenstance. On the contrary, he was of the view (with which we agree) that \nVersion No 1: 21 Jul 2021 (18:45 hrs)\nRanjit Singh s\/o Ramdarsh Singh v [2021] SGCA 66\nHarisankar Singh\n4Hari was in a \u201cunique position as the Testator\u2019s only son in Singapore\u201d (see the \nJudgment at [33], as well as at [31]). As the Judge observed (at [86]):\nWhile [Hari] is one of three sons and one of six children, he was \nin the unique position of being the only son in Singapore living \nwith and working for the Testator. He was, in that sense, also \nreliant on the Testator for his living, as he was not paid a \nregular salary but received money from the Testator \nperiodically. There is nothing in evidence to suggest that the \nstate of their relationship was bad in such a way that would \nweaken the presumption of advancement.\n6 The second argument centres on the broad powers afforded by the Power \nof Attorney (\u201cPOA\u201d), coupled with the Testator\u2019s retention of the Title Deeds \nand his heavy involvement in the purchase of the Half Share. The question is \nwhether these facts raise the inference that the Testator had intended to retain \nbeneficial ownership of the Half Share. As the Judge pertinently observed, \ncontrol and beneficial ownership were not coterminous with each other. Put \nsimply, the POA may have given the Testator great control over the Half Share \nbut did not necessarily indicate an intention to retain the beneficial interest in \nthe same. It also seems strange that if the Testator had indeed desired both \ncontrol as well as beneficial ownership of the Half Share, he had not simply put \nthe Half Share as well in his name in order to have total ownership over the \nProperty (having furnished, as we have already noted, the full purchase price of \nthe Half Share bearing in mind the fact that the Testator already owned the other \nhalf share). Whilst Ranjit claimed that the Testator had informed him that the \nreason why the Half Share was registered in Hari\u2019s name (then a young man) \nwas so that the Testator could obtain bank loans in Hari\u2019s name to redevelop the \nProperty, the Judge found, based on the evidence before him, that there was, in \nfact, no attempt to apply for a loan after the purchase of the Half Share and there \nhad been no evidence at all that the Testator had ever redeveloped any of his \nproperties or had any intention to redevelop the Property itself.

Tung is the only other director of RTC and holds the remaining 40% of its shares. RTC did not take an active part in the Cross Applications.', '8\\u2003The genesis of the Cross Applications can be traced to HC\/OS 1446\/2018 (\u201cOS 1446\u201d). This was commenced by Lin on 23 November 2018 to: (a) seek a declaration that one Mr Poon Hon Thang (\u201cMr Poon\u201d) had been validly appointed as a third director of RTC; or, alternatively, (b) seek an order for the court to convene a shareholders\u2019 Extraordinary General Meeting (\u201cEGM\u201d) to effect Mr Poon\u2019s appointment. By way of her reply affidavit dated 18 January 2019, Tung counterclaimed in OS 1446 for orders and declarations that several notices of EGMs and the decisions taken at those EGMs, as well as several notices of board of directors\u2019 meetings and the decisions made at those meetings, were invalid and of no effect.', '9\\u2003On 11 October 2019, Lin withdrew his claims in OS 1446, leaving only Tung\u2019s counterclaims. OS 1446 is stayed pending the outcome of HC\/S 1048\/2018 \u2013 a suit between Lin and Tung concerning the transfer of shares in RTC and its related companies, as well as certain sums owed between them in relation to RTC\u2019s affairs.', '10\\u2003A slew of related disputes subsequently arose between Tung and Lin, which resulted in a flurry of applications being filed in court. Unsurprisingly, the parties\u2019 dispute in OS 1446 spawned a tangled procedural tapestry. Before laying out the chronology of these related disputes, it is helpful to provide a map of this tapestry.', '', '', '', '', '11\\u2003In the course of OS 1446, Tung took issue with the fact that Lin\u2019s then solicitors were also representing RTC in OS 1446. In her view, Lin was conflicted from appointing RTC\u2019s lawyers and RTC had to be separately and independently represented by another set of lawyers in OS 1446. Tung thus engaged Nair & Co LLC (\u201cN&C\u201d) to act for RTC. In the face of Lin\u2019s vehement objections to the same, Tung filed HC\/SUM 4\/2019 (\u201cSUM 4\u201d) seeking a declaration that only she was entitled to engage solicitors to act for and represent RTC in connection with OS 1446, and that N&C had been validly appointed.', '12\\u2003The parties eventually reached a consent order dated 4 March 2019 (\u201c4 March 2019 Consent Order\u201d). The 4 March 2019 Consent Order provided that Lin\u2019s solicitors were to provide a list of 30 law firms in Singapore to Tung, from which Tung would choose one to represent RTC in OS 1446 and all appeals therefrom. It also stated that RTC would pay the costs of the chosen firm as well as those of N&C and that only Tung (or anyone on her behalf) would be entitled to give instructions to the firm on RTC\u2019s behalf.', '13\\u2003The pertinent terms of the 4 March 2019 Consent Order are as follows:', '14\\u2003In connection with this, Tung chose Joseph Tan Jude Benny LLP (\u201cJTJB\u201d) to act for RTC. From 11 March to 25 October 2019, Tung personally made payments totalling $458,125.16 to N&C and JTJB for their work done in, and in connection with, OS 1446 (ie, $66,531.70 to N&C and $391,593.46 to JTJB). According to Tung, she did so as she was concerned that Lin would withhold his approval for RTC to pay the fees. To prevent this from impacting the law firms, Tung paid them upfront and planned to seek reimbursement from RTC later. When Lin learned of Tung\u2019s request for reimbursement, he wrote to RTC\u2019s staff instructing them not to reimburse her. This is because he took the view that the fees were not fair or reasonable. On 11 February 2020, Lin wrote to Tung officially, in his capacity as the Executive Director and Chairman of RTC, informing her that the fees charged by N&C and JTJB were \u201cunreasonable, disproportionate and\/or exorbitant\u201d and that it would be in RTC\u2019s interests to tax their invoices. We refer, collectively, to the fees of N&C and JTJB as the \u201cLawyers\u2019 Fees\u201d.', '15\\u2003On 16 March 2020, Lin filed HC\/OS 320\/2020 (\u201cOS 320\u201d) seeking leave under s 216A of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (\u201cCompanies Act\u201d) to bring proceedings under RTC\u2019s name for the taxation of the Lawyers\u2019 Fees.', '16\\u2003On 17 March 2020, Tung filed SUM 1281 seeking an order that RTC reimburse her for the Lawyers\u2019 Fees paid to JTJB and N&C, on the basis of the 4 March 2019 Consent Order.', '17\\u2003On 27 July 2020, the Judge released his ex tempore judgment in Lin Jianwei v Tung Yu-Lien Margaret and another and another matter [2020] SGHC 158 (\u201cthe First Judgment\u201d) dismissing OS 320 and allowing SUM 1281. He held that:', '(a)\\u2003Leave should not be granted under s 216A of the Companies Act in OS 320 as:', '(b)\\u2003The import of the 4 March 2019 Consent Order was that Lin had agreed that Tung would be solely responsible for liaising with RTC\u2019s solicitors and managing its affairs in connection with this. There was no expectation of any involvement on Lin\u2019s part. As such, Tung was entitled to assess the Lawyers\u2019 Fees and make payment for the same on RTC\u2019s behalf and to seek reimbursement from RTC subsequently (see the First Judgment at [22]).', '(c)\\u2003Lin did not take the position that he was not willing to pay the Lawyers\u2019 Fees at all. Instead, his request was for the fees to be sent for taxation.

With his first wife, he had seven children: Ah Leng (who was an adopted son); Koh Suan Cho; Koh Suan Choo; Koh Lian Thye; Koh Ah Swan; Lian Chye and Koh Lian Huat. With his second wife, he had three children: Koh Bee Hoon (\u201cBee Hoon\u201d), Koh Chye Hin and Koh Bee Choon.', '7\\u2003Mr Koh started his provision shop business, Koh Seng Hin, as a sole proprietorship in 1968. In 1975, Koh Seng Hin was converted into a partnership and Ah Leng was made a partner. Lian Chye was never a partner of Koh Seng Hin. Koh Seng Hin originally conducted its business in a HDB shophouse in Choa Chu Kang. In 1986, it relocated to the Property, with Ah Leng and Mr Koh (as partners of Koh Seng Hin) entering into a lease agreement for the Property with the HDB. Subsequently, in 1996, the HDB offered the Property for sale. Mr Koh and Ah Leng first added Lian Chye as a joint lessee of the Property, and then the three of them purchased it for $537,800 (excluding interest and fees) as joint tenants.', '8\\u2003The purchase of the Property was financed by a bank loan of $570,800 secured by a mortgage over the Property in favour of United Overseas Finance Limited (\u201cthe Mortgage\u201d). The Mortgage was signed by Mr Koh, Ah Leng and Lian Chye as joint borrowers and mortgagors. In connection with the purchase, Lian Chye had applied to the Central Provident Fund Board (\u201cCPF Board\u201d) for, and had received, permission to use up to $527,100 of his CPF monies towards paying down the Mortgage. Between 1997 and 2001, Lian Chye applied $76,800 of that sum towards payment of the Mortgage instalments. In 1998, Mr Koh prepared his last will and testament, which did not provide for how the Property was to be dealt with. Mr Koh paid off the rest of the Mortgage, which was discharged in 2005. Significantly, Ah Leng did not contribute financially to the purchase of the Property in any way.', '9\\u2003After the Mortgage had been paid off, on 17 February 2005, Mr Koh, accompanied by Ah Leng and Lian Chye, went to the law firm of Irene Lim & Associates (\u201cILA\u201d) to discuss procuring the discharge of the Mortgage and also the possibility of the Property being owned by Mr Koh alone by severing the joint tenancy such that Mr Koh, Ah Leng and Lian Chye would hold shares in the Property in the ratio of 98:1:1, with Ah Leng and Lian Chye thereafter transferring their shares to Mr Koh. 1', 'Nothing discussed at the meeting was, however, acted upon subsequently.', '10\\u2003On 31 May 2011, there was a discussion between Mr Koh, who was then 78 years old, 2', 'and Bee Hoon. The discussion took place at Mr Koh\u2019s bedside in the hospital, where Mr Koh was then warded, and was recorded by Bee Hoon in two videos (\u201cthe Videos\u201d). In the Videos, Mr Koh appeared to be contemplating a return of $100,000 to Lian Chye so that he would \u201cwithdraw his name\u201d and for the Property to be held by Ah Leng and Mr Koh himself, \u201cjust as before, in the past\u201d. Mr Koh further asserted, in the Videos, that the Property was bought by him, and that \u201chis son\u201d (referring to Lian Chye) only borrowed monies from the bank and used his CPF monies to pay down the bank loan. Mr Koh further remarked that while Lian Chye\u2019s share in the Property \u201ccannot eat\u201d the shares held by Ah Leng and himself, their shares could \u201ceat\u201d Lian Chye\u2019s share.

Dr Kandiah diagnosed Mr Koh as having \u201cmild dementia of the mixed type (Alzheimer\u2019s disease with cerebrovascular disease)\u201d. During follow-up consultations, Dr Kandiah observed that Mr Koh\u2019s \u201cmemory difficulty [had] gradually progressed and he needed supervision with most activities of daily living\u201d.

Alternatively, he was so entitled on the basis of proprietary estoppel arising out of the existence of the Common Agreement.

Alternatively, he asserted that he, not Lian Chye, was the sole beneficial owner of the Property since the amount contributed by Lian Chye towards paying down the Mortgage was a loan. Consequently, Mr Koh was solely beneficially entitled to the Property, and his beneficial interest passed to Ah Leng pursuant to the operation of the presumption of advancement.

{"casename":"2021_SGCA_72","fact":"'3\\u2003The background facts and events leading to the anti-suit application are helpfully summarised in the HC Judgment. In brief, the appellant was one of 15 beneficiaries of an estate (the \u201cEstate\u201d), while the respondents, [VJZ] and [VKA] (collectively, the \u201crespondents\u201d) were appointed as the joint and several administrators of the Estate (later varied to joint administrators) on 1 February 2018. The Grant of Letters of Administration was granted to the respondents on 25 April 2018 and issued on 26 July 2018.', '4\\u2003The Estate was that of the deceased testator (the \u201cDeceased\u201d) who passed away on 31 October 2012, leaving behind a last will and testament dated 24 November 1995 (\u201cthe 1995 Will\u201d). Later, the Estate became embroiled in the conflict amongst the beneficiaries who ended up suing in various jurisdictions such as Indonesia and Singapore.', '5\\u2003As regards legal proceedings in Singapore, pursuant to an order of court dated 8 May 2017 and made in HCF\/OSP 10\/2016, the beneficiaries participated in mediation on 16 and 17 April 2018 and a mediation settlement was reached. All 15 beneficiaries duly executed a settlement agreement dated 18 April 2018 (the \u201c2018 SA\u201d).', '6\\u2003The provisions in the 2018 SA reflected the parties\u2019 understanding, arrangement and collective agreement as to the respondents\u2019 role in the administration of the Estate including their function, responsibilities and obligations in and about the distribution of the assets in the Estate together with the performance and discharge of the terms of the 2018 SA. For ease of reference, the Judge categorised the beneficiaries (apart from the 15th beneficiary which was a Singapore-incorporated company wholly owned by the Deceased prior to his death) into three groups: five of them including the appellant belong to \u201cFamily [A]\u201d; another five belong to \u201cFamily [B]\u201d, and the rest were \u201cunrepresented beneficiaries\u201d.', '7\\u2003The 2018 SA provided for Singapore law and exclusive jurisdiction. In particular, cl 19 of the 2018 SA provides: 1', '8\\u2003Shortly after the 2018 SA was entered into, the respondents applied to court on 23 April 2019 vide Originating Summons Probate No 3 of 2019 (\u201cOSP 3\/2019\u201d) seeking several orders to give effect to their appointment and indemnification in relation to their administration of the Estate in accordance with the terms of the 2018 SA, and in respect of various terms in the 2018 SA to be performed and discharged by the respondents. On 13 August 2019, various orders of court which we identify as HCF\/ORC 253\/2019 (\u201cORC 253\u201d) were granted to the respondents. As the Judge rightly observed, as the respondents were non-parties to the 2018 SA, ORC 253 was the means by which they were able, and became compelled, to implement the 2018 SA. To illustrate, we set out a selection of orders covered by ORC 253 (for the avoidance of doubt, references to the \u201cAdministrators\u201d in ORC 253 pertain to the respondents in this appeal, while references to the \u201crespondents\u201d in ORC 253 pertain to the beneficiaries of the Estate):', '9\\u2003On 13 June 2019, the respondents published notices in two newspapers in Indonesia (the \u201cNotices\u201d). One of the Notices 2', 'was in English and the other in Indonesian. It was not disputed that the Notices contained the same content. The Notice in English reads:', '10\\u2003The appellant commenced proceedings in Indonesia (\u201cIndonesian Proceedings\u201d) in respect of these Notices. Based on documents annexed to the first respondent\u2019s affidavit filed in Summons 96 of 2020 (\u201cSUM 96\/2020\u201d), 3', 'the Indonesian Proceedings appear to have been commenced on 15 August 2019. The appellant\u2019s counsel having conduct of the proceedings in Indonesia, Ms Sarmauli Simangunsong (\u201cMs Sarmauli\u201d), affirmed in her affidavit filed in SUM 96\/2020 that the appellant had a claim based on tort law as it applies in Indonesia. 4', 'The basis for this claim was that the respondents\u2019 act of publishing the Notices was \u201cnot only false and misleading\u201d, but also \u201cdirectly affected [the appellant\u2019s] rights as a beneficiary of the Estate in Indonesia\u201d. According to the appellant\u2019s counsel, the respondents by inviting next-of-kin interested in or having claims against the Estate to contact the respondents could \u201cpotentially [open] the floodgates for more claimants who could possibly make a claim against the Estate under forced heirship laws in Indonesia\u201d. 5', '11\\u2003It transpired that at some point in 2019 the beneficiaries undertook further negotiations as to their rights and entitlements under the 2018 SA. These negotiations culminated in the beneficiaries entering into a new Inheritance Right Settlement Agreement (\u201cIRSA\u201d) dated 13 December 2019. Counsel for the appellant, Mr Devinder Kumar s\/o Ram Sakal Rai (\u201cMr Rai\u201d), confirmed that he had not been instructed on the re-negotiations and that he was only notified of the IRSA a few days before it was entered into. 6', '12\\u2003We pause here to observe that a chronology of the events that had occurred from the time the appellant started the Indonesian Proceedings up to the time of execution of the IRSA would have been useful, seeing that the outcome of the re-negotiations materially changed what had been agreed to in the 2018 SA. Be that as it may, we note the existence of same and\/or closely connected facts in the 2018 SA and the IRSA that would bear on the credibility of the appellant\u2019s claim in the Indonesian Proceedings, and her decision to press on with the proceedings in Indonesia after entering into the IRSA. We also note that the appellant\u2019s entitlement under the 1995 Will was changed twice, first by the 2018 SA and then again by the IRSA. These matters played a significant role in our analysis of whether an anti-suit injunction was warranted on the ground that the Indonesian Proceedings were, in the circumstances, vexatious or oppressive. Taken together with these matters, the inherent weakness of the claim was a relevant factor in the consideration of whether foreign proceedings were vexatious or oppressive. We elaborate on these matters below.', '13\\u2003Returning to the background facts and procedural history, in Summons 10 of 2020 (filed on 15 January 2020) (\u201cSUM 10\/2020\u201d), Family [A] and another beneficiary applied for, inter alia, a declaration that the 2018 SA had been cancelled and replaced by the IRSA. 7', 'They also applied for the respondents to be removed as administrators and for VKB (who is part of Family [A]) and another individual, an Indonesian national, to be appointed as new administrators. These orders were granted by the court in an order of court identified as ORC 212\/2020 (\u201cORC 212\u201d) made on 3 August 2020. The upshot was that it was recognised that the IRSA had replaced the 2018 SA and that new administrators were appointed.', '14\\u2003On 7 February 2020, the respondents were provided with a letter of request for international judicial assistance from the registrar for the Central Jakarta District Court for service of process dated 11 December 2019. 8', 'The respondents were summoned to attend a hearing which appears to have been scheduled for 19 March 2020. 9', 'It is not disputed that the respondents came to know of the Indonesian Proceedings only after that letter was served on them.', '15\\u2003On 24 March 2020, the respondents filed their application for an anti-suit injunction to restrain the appellant from taking further steps in relation to the Indonesian Proceedings and any appeals and\/or related proceedings arising therefrom. 10', 'As mentioned, the Judge granted the respondents\u2019 application.'"}

{"casename":"2021_SGCA_74","fact":"'4\\u2003The factual background of Rahmat (CA) is relatively straightforward. At the material time, Rahmat was employed as a runner for one \u201cKanna Gila\u201d (\u201cKanna\u201d) who was in the business of illegal money-lending. Rahmat had known Kanna for a period of less than two months prior to his arrest.', '5\\u2003On 27 May 2015, sometime before 6.51pm, Rahmat entered Singapore from Malaysia via the Woodlands Checkpoint in a car. He was with his wife and their three children. Pursuant to Kanna\u2019s earlier instructions, after entering Singapore, Rahmat drove to Rochor Road where he met up with a male subject known as \u201cBai\u201d, who instructed Rahmat to meet Zainal bin Hamad (\u201cZainal\u201d) at the IKEA store located in Tampines, Singapore (\u201cIKEA\u201d). Rahmat was known to Zainal as \u201cAbang\u201d and Zainal was known to Rahmat as \u201c26\u201d.', '6\\u2003Rahmat and Zainal then met at the staircase on the second level of IKEA. At about 8.35pm, Zainal passed S$8,000 to Rahmat. After which, Rahmat placed a green bag (\u201cBag\u201d) at the staircase landing in front of Zainal before leaving IKEA. Rahmat then met up with his wife and children and drove the car with his family to Woodlands Checkpoint. At the checkpoint, Rahmat and his wife were arrested by officers of the Central Narcotics Bureau (\u201cCNB\u201d). Rahmat\u2019s wife was searched, and S$8,000 was found concealed in her brassiere. Rahmat had passed the S$8,000 he received from Zainal to his wife and had told her to conceal it in her brassiere whilst they were en route to Woodlands Checkpoint.', '7\\u2003 Zainal thereafter picked up the Bag and placed it in a warehouse located on the second floor of IKEA. At about 9.25pm, CNB officers entered the warehouse and arrested Zainal. The Bag was found to contain one red coloured plastic bag containing three plastic packets of 1381.7g of granular\/powdery substance (the \u201cDrugs\u201d). The Drugs were subsequently found to contain not less than 53.64g of diamorphine, a controlled drug. Neither Rahmat nor Zainal were authorised under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder to traffic or be in possession of a controlled drug.', '8\\u2003Rahmat was jointly tried with Zainal before the Judge. Zainal was charged with having not less than 53.64g of diamorphine in his possession for the purpose of trafficking under s 5(l)(a) read with s 5(2) and punishable under s 33(1) of the MDA, while Rahmat was charged with trafficking in not less than 53.64g of diamorphine under s 5(1)(a) and punishable under s 33(1) of the MDA.', '9\\u2003At the trial, the Prosecution had run three arguments in its closing submissions: (a) Rahmat could not rebut the s 18(2) presumption of knowledge; alternatively, (b) Rahmat was either wilfully blind or (c) had actual knowledge that the Bag contained diamorphine. Rahmat\u2019s defence was that he believed that he was carrying medicine.', '10\\u2003The Judge convicted Zainal and Rahmat of their respective charges and imposed the mandatory sentence of death on them, as no certificate of substantive assistance was provided. The Judge\u2019s decision is reported in Public Prosecutor v Rahmat bin Karimon and another [2018] 5 SLR 641 (\u201cRahmat (HC)\u201d). The Judge noted that the Prosecution\u2019s primary case was that Rahmat could not rebut the s 18(2) presumption of knowledge (Rahmat (HC) at [15]). The Judge also noted that the Prosecution had run an \u201calternative\u201d case that Rahmat was \u201ceither wilfully blind or had actual knowledge of the nature of the Drugs\u201d (Rahmat (HC) at [16]). The Judge found that Rahmat failed to rebut the s 18(2) presumption (Rahmat (HC) at [60]); and that actual knowledge and wilful blindness had been separately proven beyond a reasonable doubt (Rahmat (HC) at [61] and [65] respectively).', '11\\u2003On 11 September 2018, the Court of Appeal dismissed both Zainal\u2019s and Rahmat\u2019s appeals against conviction, and delivered its grounds of decision (\u201cGD\u201d) in Rahmat (CA) on 3 October 2018. There is no suggestion in this application that the Court of Appeal\u2019s GD in Rahmat (CA) had inaccurately recorded the parties\u2019 respective cases. While Rahmat challenged all three aspects of the Judge\u2019s findings in his written submissions, for the appeal hearing, he chose, as it was his prerogative, to focus on his sole defence that the s 18(2) presumption of knowledge had been rebutted. This was explicitly noted in Rahmat (CA) at [30]. On this basis, the Court of Appeal held that Rahmat had failed to rebut the s 18(2) presumption of knowledge (Rahmat (CA) at [36]).', '12\\u2003On 21 January 2020, an order under s 313(f) of the CPC was issued by the President of the Republic of Singapore for the sentence of death pronounced on Rahmat to be carried into effect on 14 February 2020. Pursuant to s 313(g) of the CPC, a warrant was then issued by the Chief Justice authorising and requiring the Commissioner of Prisons to carry the sentence of death into execution. On 11 February 2020, the President of the Republic of Singapore, in accordance with Art 22P(1) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1985 Rev Ed, 1999 Reprint) and s 313(h) of the CPC, ordered a respite of the execution of the said warrant pending any further order.', '13\\u2003On 20 February 2020, the Court of Appeal granted leave to the applicant in Gobi to make a criminal review application. On 19 October 2020, the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision on the criminal review application in Gobi was delivered. Following the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in Gobi, the Attorney-General\u2019s Chambers wrote to Rahmat\u2019s counsel, Mr Jason Chan SC (\u201cMr Chan\u201d), on 2 December 2020, stating that, in view of Gobi, the Prosecution was of the view that it would be \u201cprudent\u201d for Rahmat to \u201cundertake [his] own review of the record of proceedings\u201d to consider how, if at all, the decision in Gobi could affect him. Rahmat then filed the present criminal motion on 21 April 2021. Under s 394H(6)(a) of the CPC, such a leave application is to be heard by a single Judge sitting in the Court of Appeal where the appellate court in question is the Court of Appeal. It is on this basis that I am determining this leave application.'"}
{"casename":"2021_SGCA_75","fact":"'5\\u2003We begin with the factual background surrounding the appellant\u2019s arrest and the discovery of the drugs in his motorcycle. This is largely undisputed and is detailed at [94]\u2013[101] of the Judgment.', '6\\u2003On 4 February 2012, at or about 2.29pm, the appellant was stopped at Woodlands Checkpoint when he entered Singapore on a motorcycle, bearing the Malaysian registration number WUQ 4810. Upon screening by an officer from the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (\u201cthe ICA\u201d), the appellant was detained for further checks. His passport as well as the keys to the motorcycle were seized from him. Subsequently, at around 3.26pm, officers from the ICA, upon unscrewing the fender of the motorcycle, found four plastic wrappers in the form of \u201cOriental Cheese Balls\u201d packets (\u201cthe Packets\u201d) hidden in the air filter compartment. Suspecting that the Packets may contain controlled drugs, the appellant was placed under arrest. At about 7.45pm, the Packets were seized and opened in the appellant\u2019s presence, each revealing brown granular substances in transparent plastic bags (\u201cthe drug exhibits\u201d). The drug exhibits and their attendant packets were photographed. These Packets, along with the drug exhibits, were then handed over to an officer from the Central Narcotics Bureau (\u201cCNB\u201d), Inspector Ong Wee Kang (\u201cInsp Ong\u201d), who brought them back to the CNB for storage, locking it in the safe in his office.', '7\\u2003On 6 February 2012, after labelling and sealing the drug exhibits, Insp Ong handed over the drug exhibits, along with four submission forms pertaining to each bag, to Dr Yap Thiong Whei Angeline (\u201cDr Yap\u201d), an analyst in the Health Sciences Authority (\u201cthe HSA\u201d). The drug exhibits were later analysed and found to contain not less than 24.95g of diamorphine (see the Judgment at [102]\u2013[115]). The appellant was charged for a capital offence of drug importation under s 7 of the MDA, and on 30 October 2014, was committed to stand trial in the High Court.', '8\\u2003The facts underlying the PCJ Charge are contained in the Statement of Facts (2nd Charge) (Amended) filed on 17 August 2020. The appellant admitted to the facts without any qualification. Our summary thus need only be brief.', '9\\u2003In the course of investigations, the appellant incriminated one Muneeshwar Subramaniam (\u201cMuneeshwar\u201d) for instigating him to bring the Packets into Singapore. Subsequently, Muneeshwar was charged with the capital offence for abetting the appellant to import drugs under s 7 of the MDA. On 13 December 2016, Muneeshwar was committed to stand trial in the High Court. Both the appellant and Muneeshwar claimed trial to the capital charges.', '10\\u2003Sometime between 16 February 2017 and 20 February 2017, while the appellant and Muneeshwar were in the midst of the capital trial, the appellant handed Muneeshwar, by way of a fellow prison inmate (\u201cDominic\u201d), a hand-written note (\u201cthe Note\u201d). The Note contained detailed instructions, spanning some 11 paragraphs, for Muneeshwar to falsely testify in a way so as to exonerate himself and the appellant from the capital charges. In particular, the appellant wanted Muneeshwar to testify that Muneeshwar had received the Packets from Muneeshwar\u2019s \u201cboss\u201d and that Muneeshwar had passed them to the appellant to bring into Singapore, and that both of them had no knowledge that the Packets contained drugs. At the end of the Note, the appellant implored Dominic to translate the scripted defence to Muneeshwar in Tamil, since the latter\u2019s English proficiency was limited. However, as Dominic did not have an opportunity to see Muneeshwar, one of Muneeshwar\u2019s cellmates instead translated the Note to him in Tamil. But neither Muneeshwar nor his cellmate fully understood the contents of the Note.', '11\\u2003All this came to light on 21 February 2017, when Muneeshwar informed his counsel about having received the Note. Muneeshwar copied the contents of the Note onto another piece of paper and brought the copy to the High Court the next day to show his counsel, who promptly reported the matter to a CNB officer. The Note was found and seized in Muneeshwar\u2019s jail cell.', '12\\u2003It is to the appellant\u2019s appeal proper that we now turn.'"}
{"casename":"2021_SGCA_76","fact":"'4\\u2003The Judge set out a detailed account of the facts concerning the appellants\u2019 conduct in the proceedings below. This is adequate for present purposes and we see no need for us to repeat the facts here, save to highlight the key events that underscore the egregious nature of the appellants\u2019 conduct.', '5\\u2003Initially, only the second appellant entered an appearance in Suit 844 and filed what can reasonably be said to be a bare defence. ECPL subsequently entered an appearance two years later, while, as stated before, D&N never entered an appearance. Pursuant to a first discovery order, the second appellant only disclosed five items in his list of documents filed on 14 December 2017. As this was plainly insufficient, the respondent requested for 58 categories of documents focusing on exchanges between the second appellant, ECPL, D&N and the Vietnamese company known as \u201cDDHP\u201d. The second appellant resisted and only drip-fed documents when pressed to disclose them. He did eventually file a supplemental list of documents on 26 January 2018 disclosing 27 items and a second supplemental list of documents on 30 April 2018 disclosing another five items. However, 19 of the documents disclosed in his first supplemental list of documents were repetitions from the respondent\u2019s own list of documents.', '6\\u2003More importantly, what arose from the disclosures was that the dealings between the first three appellants and DDHP appeared not to be bona fide. The payment terms in ECPL\u2019s and D&N\u2019s sales contracts with DDHP did not correspond with the sums deposited into, for example, ECPL\u2019s bank account. The second appellant\u2019s cursory response was that he would \u201creserve the explanation \u2026 to a later stage\u201d. Moreover, the second appellant only disclosed 14 emails between ECPL, D&N and DDHP which he said represented the entirety of his written exchange with DDHP for the sale and purchase of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of cargo. His explanation was that he dealt with DDHP mainly via \u201coral communication\u201d and that he did not need to give particulars about the said communication.', '7\\u2003The respondent then obtained a first discovery order directing the first three appellants to disclose email databases, computer hard drives and handphones. This order also required disclosure of an OCBC account held by D&N (\u201cthe D&N OCBC Account\u201d). The second appellant did not comply. He claimed that: (a) DDHP had not paid any monies to D&N and therefore the D&N OCBC Account did not need to be disclosed; (b) he lost the passwords to three of his five email addresses; (c) he did not use a computer or hard drive for his business as printing and typing was outsourced; and (d) he had discarded his phone. In the circumstances, the respondent obtained a second discovery order as regards the outsourcing of the second appellant\u2019s printing and typing. To this, the second appellant claimed that the outsourced documents were \u201cnot returned\u201d to him or had been \u201cdiscarded\u201d, and that the individual who he allegedly engaged to do his printing and typing had \u201cleft Singapore\u201d.', '8\\u2003Fearing a potential dissipation of assets, the respondent obtained a first Mareva order which required the appellants to disclose all their assets. An application to set aside the first Mareva order was dismissed. The second appellant claimed that the first three appellants did not have assets and therefore did not make any disclosures. It was later revealed that the second appellant had sold his 1% share in the Leonie Property and all his shares in one TUTP Pte Ltd (\u201cTUTP\u201d) (an asset listed in the first Mareva order) to his wife, the fourth appellant, during the course of Suit 844. This arrangement was complex and involved a power of attorney and declarations of trust, with the effect that the second appellant held the assets on trust for his wife. Once this came to light, the respondent obtained a second Mareva order against the fourth appellant on the basis that the purported asset transfers were void as fraudulent conveyances and that she held assets that belonged to the first three appellants. Her application to set aside the second Mareva order, in which she claimed to be a woman of substance, was dismissed.', '9\\u2003The respondent then discovered that, throughout Suit 844, the second and fourth appellants in truth were spending more than S$25,000 a month in support of their lifestyles. In response, the couple now claimed to be impecunious, asserting that it was the fourth appellant\u2019s mother, one \u201cMs Hoang\u201d, who had been financially supporting the family. However, Ms Hoang\u2019s bank balance would not have been sufficient to maintain the couple\u2019s standard of living for more than five months, and the couple\u2019s IRAS statements showed that they had claimed \u201cParent Relief\u201d in respect of Ms Hoang. Given the foregoing, the respondent obtained a third discovery order in aid of the Mareva orders to uncover the true extent of the couple\u2019s wealth. Again, this proved to be futile.', '10\\u2003When the respondent did eventually obtain the appellants\u2019 bank statements (including those of the D&N OCBC Account) directly from the banks, the statements showed that the second appellant was not impecunious. On the face of the evidence, up to US$250m had been flowing through the three bank accounts of ECPL, D&N and TUTP from 2016 to 2019. The D&N OCBC Account also received US$1.2m in deposits from what were claimed to be unknown and unrecorded sources. In the circumstances, the respondent applied for the Committal Order and the Unless Order.', '11\\u2003In relation to the Committal Order, the Judge held that the respondent had discharged its burden of proving that the second and fourth appellants were in contempt of court (see the GD at [60]). The Judge found that, in this case, the couple\u2019s conduct could not be said to be the result of honest and reasonable failure to understand their discovery obligations (see the GD at [65]). This was not done once or twice but on multiple occasions. They had also maintained lies repeatedly (see the GD at [68]). Taking into account the circumstances, the second appellant was committed to seven months\u2019 imprisonment while the fourth appellant was committed to five months\u2019 imprisonment. In relation to the Unless Order, the Judge noted that it had been granted to give the appellants one last chance before their defences were to be struck out (see the GD at [82]\u2013[83]). The guiding principle was proportionality, and the appellants \u2013 on whom the burden of proof lay \u2013 could not show that their breaches were not intentional and contumelious (see the GD at [84]).'"}
{"casename":"2021_SGCA_77","fact":"'5\\u2003The respondent, LVND Investments Pte Ltd (\u201cthe Developer\u201d), is the developer of Macpherson Mall (\u201cthe Mall\u201d). The 16 plaintiffs (\u201cthe Purchasers\u201d) in HC\/S 204\/2020 (\u201cthe Suit\u201d) had purchased 12 shop units in the Mall pursuant to 12 separate sale and purchase agreements (\u201cthe SPAs\u201d) between 2013 and 2016. Of the 16 plaintiffs, nine of them had initially filed the present appeal. Pursuant to a consent order entered in CA\/SUM 62\/2021, a further four plaintiffs \u2013 co-owners of their respective units with some of the initial appellants \u2013 were added as parties to the appeal. Consequently, of the 16 plaintiffs below, 13 of them are parties to the appeal (\u201cthe Appellants\u201d), who purchased a total of nine units under nine SPAs.', '6\\u2003The underlying disputes between the Purchasers and the Developer arise out of allegations that the Developer had made fraudulent misrepresentations and suppressed material facts that induced the Purchasers into purchasing their respective units in the Mall. In particular, the Purchasers allege that the sizes of their units were smaller than the area that each of them had believed it was buying.', '7\\u2003 When the disputes arose, the Purchasers engaged a law firm (the \u201cFormer Solicitors\u201d) who advised them to seek recourse through arbitration. The Former Solicitors took the view that cl 20A.1 of the SPAs (which was identical in each SPA) was an arbitration agreement. On 6 May 2019, the Former Solicitors issued a Notice of Arbitration (\u201cthe 1st NOA\u201d) against the Developer to commence arbitration under the auspices of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (\u201cSIAC\u201d). The Developer\u2019s solicitors, Rajah & Tann Singapore LLP (\u201cR&T\u201d), issued 12 responses, each dated 21 May 2019, objecting to the proposed arbitration because the Developer did not agree (a) that the arbitration should be administered by the SIAC; (b) that the arbitration should be conducted according to the SIAC Rules; and (c) that the disputes should be consolidated in a single arbitration. On 19 June 2019, the Court of Arbitration of the SIAC found that it was \u201cnot prima facie satisfied that the parties ha[d] agreed that [the] SIAC shall administer these arbitrations, or on the application of the SIAC Rules in these references\u201d. The SIAC accordingly terminated the arbitrations commenced by the 1st NOA. We refer to this as the \u201c1st Attempted Arbitration\u201d.', '8\\u2003On 28 June 2019, the Purchasers\u2019 Former Solicitors issued a second Notice of Arbitration (\u201cthe 2nd NOA\u201d), constituting a request for the disputes to be referred to an arbitration to be commenced on an ad hoc basis in Singapore, and nominating a sole arbitrator. On 2 July 2019, in a letter from R&T to the Purchasers\u2019 Former Solicitors, the Developer objected to what it regarded as an attempt \u201cto consolidate different arbitrations\u201d in a single ad hoc arbitration. Further correspondence followed. On 29 July 2019, the Purchasers\u2019 Former Solicitors wrote to the President of the Court of Arbitration of the SIAC seeking the appointment of a single arbitrator. On 2 August 2019, R&T wrote to the SIAC stating the Developer\u2019s position that no ad hoc arbitration had been validly commenced as it was a defective attempt to commence a single consolidated arbitration, and in any event, if all the Purchasers wanted to commence any arbitration there would have to be 12 different ad hoc arbitrations and 12 arbitrators would need to be appointed. It also disagreed with the Purchasers\u2019 nomination of a sole arbitrator.', '9\\u2003In September 2019, the Purchasers obtained different legal advice. They discharged the Former Solicitors and engaged their present counsel. On 3 February 2020, the Purchasers notified the SIAC that they did not wish to proceed against the Developer by way of the arbitration proceedings purportedly commenced by the 2nd NOA, and this attempt at arbitration was thus discontinued. We will refer to this as the \u201c2nd Attempted Arbitration\u201d.', '10\\u2003On 4 March 2020, the Purchasers filed the Suit claiming rescission of the SPAs or damages in lieu of rescission, as well as damages for any and all losses, costs and expenses suffered as a result of entering into the SPAs. On 25 March 2020, the Developer filed HC\/SUM 1422\/2020 seeking a stay of the Suit on the basis that the parties were bound by an arbitration agreement in cl 20A.1 of the SPAs, or, in the alternative, that the parties had entered into an arbitration agreement by their conduct.', '11\\u2003On 10 June 2020, the AR held that cl 20A.1 of the SPAs was not an arbitration clause but found that the parties had entered into an arbitration agreement by their conduct. She ordered a stay of the Suit under s 6 of the AA. The parties then filed cross-appeals: (a) HC\/RA 111\/2020 (\u201cRA 111\u201d) was the Developer\u2019s appeal against the AR\u2019s finding that cl 20A.1 was not an arbitration agreement; and (b) HC\/RA 112\/2020 (\u201cRA 112\u201d) was the Purchasers\u2019 appeal against the decision to stay the Suit and the costs orders made against them.'"}

USSB is the beneficial owner of all the issued shares in City Centre Sdn Bhd (in liquidation) (\u201cCCSB\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of USSB which had been wound up by the Malaysian court on 25 April 2000.', '10\\u2003The respondent is United Overseas Bank Ltd (\u201cUOB\u201d), a Singapore bank.

On the same date, USSB executed a deed of debenture (\u201cthe Debenture\u201d) which created a fixed charge (\u201cthe Charge\u201d) in OUB\u2019s favour over all of the CCSB Shares. The following clauses of the Loan Agreement are pertinent.', '(a)\\u2003Clause 25.1 provided that the Loan Agreement and the Debenture \u201cshall be governed by and construed in all respects in accordance with the laws of Singapore\u201d.', '(b)\\u2003Clause 25.2 provided that USSB \u201cirrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceedings against it with respect to [the Loan] Agreement and the Debenture may be brought in the courts of Singapore\u201d and that USSB \u201cirrevocably submits \u2026 to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the [Singapore] courts\u201d.', '(c)\\u2003Clause 25.6 provided that USSB \u201cirrevocably waives any objection \u2026 to the venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to [the Loan] Agreement \u2026 selected by [UOB] and \u2026 further irrevocably waives any claim that the venue so selected is not a convenient forum for any such suit, action or proceeding\u201d.', '12\\u2003On 27 December 1982, the CCSB Shares which were then registered in the name of USSB were transferred to and registered in the sole name of OUB Nominees (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd pursuant to the Debenture. OUB Nominees (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd subsequently changed its name to UOB Nominees 2006 (Tempatan) Sdn Bhd (\u201cUOB Nominees\u201d). At the time of the appeal before us, UOB Nominees remained the registered holder of the CCSB Shares.', '13\\u2003On 19 December 1983, USSB defaulted on the loan granted by OUB. In May 1985, pursuant to the Loan Agreement and the Debenture, receivers were appointed over the properties and assets of USSB charged to OUB. In 2002, following OUB\u2019s merger with UOB, UOB took over all of OUB\u2019s interest in the Loan Agreement and the Debenture.', '14\\u2003A winding-up order against CCSB was made in Malaysia on 25 April 2000. Several years later, on 30 January 2007, a similar order was made against USSB in Companies Winding Up No D5286182005 (\u201cthe Malaysian Winding Up Proceeding\u201d).', '15\\u2003On 12 May 2017, 16 parcels of land belonging to CCSB were sold as part of its winding up. After CCSB\u2019s debts were paid, a sum of money remained from the proceeds of sale \u2013 this formed CCSB\u2019s liquidation surplus (\u201cthe Surplus Funds\u201d). For the purposes of distributing the Surplus Funds, CCSB\u2019s liquidators filed an application on 18 September 2017 in the High Court in Malaya, seeking directions as to whether UOB Nominees was the sole and rightful contributory of CCSB.', '16\\u2003On 12 February 2018, the Malayan High Court held that UOB Nominees was the sole and rightful contributory of CCSB and that the Surplus Funds should be distributed to it. However, this decision was set aside by the Malaysian Court of Appeal on 7 August 2019, on the basis that the form of the application had not been appropriate for the determination of the ownership of the CCSB Shares. UOB Nominees\u2019 application for leave to appeal against the Malaysian Court of Appeal\u2019s decision was subsequently dismissed by the Malaysian Federal Court. The Malaysian Federal Court then imposed an undertaking on CCSB\u2019s liquidators not to distribute the Surplus Funds pending the determination of the rights and obligations of the parties. Hence, at the time of the appeal before us, the Surplus Funds remained with CCSB.', '17\\u2003Subsequently, parallel proceedings were commenced in Malaysia and Singapore concerning the issue of UOB\u2019s and USSB\u2019s rights and obligations under the Loan Agreement and the Debenture.

This is immaterial to the present appeal, though for ease of reference, we will refer to all the subsidiaries listed above collectively as the \u201csubsidiaries\u201d.', '7\\u2003The relevant corporate structure of the SuperPark Group is represented diagrammatically below:', '', '8\\u2003SPAG\u2019s other owners are Treasure Step Global Limited (\u201cTreasure\u201d), and Vintex Oy (\u201cVintex\u201d). Kumarasinhe is a director and shareholder of Treasure.', '9\\u2003Prior to the appointment of the second and third respondents as provisional liquidators, the directors of SPAG were Juha Tapani Tanskanen (\u201cJuha\u201d), who is the appellant\u2019s CEO, Kumarasinhe, and one Goh Ke Ching, the park manager and supervisor of SP SG. Juha was the appellant\u2019s representative on the board of directors of SPAG.', '10\\u2003Kumarasinhe was first introduced to the appellant sometime in 2017. He wished to establish a SuperPark in Hong Kong (ie, SP HK), which was to be a licensee of the appellant. However, Kumarasinhe was unable to secure suitable external investors, and it was therefore agreed that the appellant would instead finance SP HK with an equity investment, thus becoming SP HK\u2019s majority shareholder. Kumarasinhe was subsequently appointed as CEO of SP HK.', '11\\u2003In May 2018, following the incorporation of SPAG, Kumarasinhe recommended and procured the establishment of SP BKK, SP KL, and SP SG. He was appointed a director of all three subsidiaries. The appellant provided US$3m in loans between October 2018 and January 2019 for the establishment of SP SG, while SuperPark Bidco Oy provided financing for SP BKK after Kumarasinhe failed to generate sufficient cash flow from existing parks or procure funding to fund the construction of the entire SP BKK park. To date, the appellant and SuperPark Bidco Oy have funded approximately US$9m or more to SPAG and its various subsidiaries.', '12\\u2003The relationship between the appellant and Kumarasinhe began to break down sometime in or around the latter half of 2019. In November 2019, Kumarasinhe sent a sharply worded email to Juha expressing frustration about the appellant\u2019s slow pace of funding for the SP BKK park. Kumarasinhe described the appellant\u2019s apparent decision to not fund the SP BKK park in the absence of SPAG agreeing to new terms for the provision of debt drawdowns as resulting in great demotivation, and having a significant negative impact on cash positions.', '13\\u2003The relationship continued to deteriorate, with the exchange of even more correspondence, and matters came to a head with a strongly-worded email that Kumarasinhe sent to Juha on 25 January 2020. This email, extracted below, speaks for itself:', '14\\u2003On its end, the appellant, through its officers, expressed frustration with Kumarasinhe for not complying with various audit and disclosure requirements. In particular, it was alleged that Kumarasinhe failed to submit financial information regarding SPAG and its subsidiaries in a timely fashion despite being on notice that such information was critical for the appellant to negotiate with banks and investors, fulfil reporting obligations under credit facilities on time, and conduct a group-wide audit. Specifically, in relation to Kumarasinhe\u2019s refusal to prepare for a group-wide audit conducted by the appellant\u2019s auditors, Ernst & Young, Wentzel sent a firmly-worded email dated 27 May 2020 expressing his disappointment at the lack of progress in complying with the requirements for the audit. Wentzel\u2019s email clearly indicated that he wanted Kumarasinhe to co-operate with Ernst & Young for the audit, and that the audit was of \u201cvery high importance\u201d to the appellant. This does not appear to have been done, and the relationship appears to have deteriorated further.', '15\\u2003True to his word in his email of 25 January 2020, Kumarasinhe did in fact take action to \u201caddress\u201d the working relationship with the appellant. On 17 June 2020, Kumarasinhe tabled a board resolution at a meeting over Zoom to put SPAG in provisional liquidation. No prior notice concerning such a resolution had been given to Juha or the appellant, and the resolution passed with votes from Kumarasinhe and Goh Ke Ching despite Juha\u2019s objections that no notice had been given. Juha\u2019s requests for an adjournment were also ignored. The directors\u2019 resolution passed on 17 June 2020 was to the effect that, inter alia:', '(a)\\u2003The directors declared that SPAG was unable to continue business by reason of its liabilities;', '(b)\\u2003The second and third respondents, of AJCapital Advisory Pte Ltd, were appointed as joint and several provisional liquidators;', '(c)\\u2003An extraordinary general meeting (\u201cEGM\u201d) be convened on 16 July 2020 to propose (i) a special resolution to voluntarily wind-up the company, and (ii) an ordinary resolution to appoint the second and third respondents as joint and several liquidators in such winding up; and', '(d)\\u2003A creditors\u2019 meeting be convened on 16 July 2020 to, inter alia, confirm the appointment of the second and third respondents as joint and several liquidators of SPAG.', 'On the same day, the said directors lodged the requisite statutory declaration under s 291 of the CA. Notice was also given of the second and third respondents\u2019 appointment as provisional liquidators in various newspapers.', '16\\u2003Following their appointment as provisional liquidators on 17 June 2020, the second and third respondents proceeded to ascertain the financial situation of the company, concluding that it was balance sheet insolvent, and that it was \u201cvery likely\u201d to be cashflow insolvent. In particular, the second and third respondents determined that as of 31 May 2020, SPAG was in a net liabilities position of negative \u20ac2,388,781 (book value) and negative \u20ac4,512,478 (estimated realisable value). In terms of cashflow, the second and third respondents observed that SPAG only had \u20ac5,101 in its bank account, but had allegedly incurred around \u20ac100,000 in operating costs each month from January to May 2020.', '17\\u2003On 22 June 2020, correspondence began to be exchanged between the appellant\u2019s solicitors on the one hand, and the second and third respondents on the other. The appellant\u2019s solicitors denied that the appellant had any knowledge that SPAG was insolvent, and sought mainly disclosure of information concerning SPAG\u2019s financial state. In subsequent correspondence, the appellant\u2019s solicitors informed the second and third respondents that the appellant intended to vote against any resolution to wind up the company, and expressed concern that the second and third respondents would be taking steps to sell SPAG\u2019s assets, including the subsidiaries, to third parties. The second and third respondents\u2019 solicitors\u2019 response was to indicate that (a) the appellant ought to have the relevant information given that Juha was a director of SPAG, (b) in any event, it would provide the information requested on 3 July 2020, and (c) it was entitled to take steps to sell SPAG\u2019s assets as it had to act in the interests of SPAG\u2019s creditors.', '18\\u2003On 2 July 2020, at about 1pm, the appellant gave the second and third respondents notice of an EGM. The EGM was scheduled for 5.15pm that very day, and the following resolutions were tabled:', '(a)\\u2003That Kumarasinhe be removed as a director with immediate effect;', '(b)\\u2003That Goh Ke Ching be removed as a director with immediate effect;', '(c)\\u2003That Wentzel be appointed as a director with immediate effect;', '(d)\\u2003That Lau Dong Neng be appointed as a director with immediate effect; and', '(e)\\u2003That the company not be voluntarily wound up and that the present provisional liquidation be terminated with immediate effect.', 'Notwithstanding the objections of the second and third respondents on the basis that the EGM had been called in an irregular manner and appeared to subvert the statutory procedures for voluntary winding up, the appellant went ahead with the meeting. All five resolutions outlined above (\u201cthe EGM resolutions\u201d) were passed.', '19\\u2003On 6 July 2020, the second and third respondents, who considered the EGM resolutions invalid and not binding on themselves, issued a Notice of a Meeting of Creditors of the Company. In that notice, a list of creditors of SPAG and their potential claims was enclosed, as is extracted below:', '', 'It bears note that in this list of creditors, the appellant and its affiliate, Boost OY, held an approximately 53% majority of the total debt (converting the total debt amount to US dollars). The appellant was thus, in effect, the majority creditor.', '20\\u2003 However, on 7 July 2020, one day after the Notice of a Meeting of Creditors had been sent, Kumarasinhe submitted a Statement of Affairs for SPAG. Kumarasinhe\u2019s Statement of Affairs outlined that as of 17 June 2020, the estimated deficiency SPAG was facing was negative \u20ac4,606,323.95 based on values as recorded in the company\u2019s books, and negative \u20ac7,456,501.54 if estimated realisable values were used. No explanation was provided for the dramatic decrease in the estimated realisable value figure from the provisional liquidators\u2019 prior estimates. In addition, Kumarasinhe\u2019s Statement of Affairs reflected the following list of creditors as of 17 June 2020:', '', 'Two points bear note at this juncture. First, Kumarasinhe\u2019s Statement of Affairs does not contain any attachments or enclosures which bear out these figures. Put simply, there did not appear to be documentary evidence with which to directly verify the debts asserted. Second, under these calculations, the appellant and its affiliate, Boost OY, were no longer majority creditors. Instead, they would only hold about 41.9% of the total debt. The second and third respondents explained the discrepancy between the figures in this Statement of Affairs and the figures in the 6 July 2020 Notice on the basis that the figures in the notice were figures which were added to over time as creditors came forward with proofs of debt.', '21\\u2003On 8 July 2020, the second and third respondents commenced HC\/OS 656\/2020 (\u201cOS 656\u201d), in which they sought a declaration that the EGM resolution of 2 July 2020 purporting to terminate the voluntary winding up of SPAG and remove the second and third respondents was invalid. At the same time, the second and third respondents also filed SUM 2700\/2020 (\u201cSUM 2700\u201d) seeking, inter alia, an injunction restraining the appellant from taking any action inconsistent with SPAG being in provisional liquidation. SUM 2700 was heard on an ex parte basis before the Judge on 8 July 2020.', '22\\u2003After hearing arguments from the parties, the Judge pointed out that SUM 2700 was an ex parte application, and that the appellant would have to seek to set aside the injunction made that day if it disagreed with the order. She then granted an order in terms of the injunction, with costs reserved to the substantive hearing of OS 656.', '23\\u2003On 13 July 2020, the appellant commenced HC\/OS 671\/2020 (\u201cOS 671\u201d) for, inter alia, a declaration that the provisional liquidation and any voluntary winding up of SPAG would be terminated at an EGM of SPAG dated 16 July 2020, one month after the provisional liquidators were appointed. Simultaneously, the appellant also filed SUM 2791\/2020 (\u201cSUM 2791\u201d) seeking an order, inter alia, restraining the second and third respondents from taking any further steps in the provisional liquidation of the first respondent until 16 July 2020 or further order, whichever is earlier, save for payments made in the ordinary course of business and correspondence in the name of SPAG as required by law. The Judge\u2019s decision in OS 671 and SUM 2791 was the subject of the present appeal.', '24\\u2003SUM 2791 was heard before the Judge on 14 July 2020. The central point made by the appellant at that hearing concerned its discovery of the steps taken by the second and third respondents to dispose of the assets of the company. Even though the second and third respondents had, by letter dated 2 July 2020, indicated that they were looking for \u201curgent funding to keep the Subsidiaries alive\u201d, they had instead circulated an Invitation to Offer to sell all of the SPAG subsidiaries (\u201cthe Invitation to Offer\u201d). Three oddities concerning the Invitation to Offer bore note. First, despite the appellant\u2019s already-communicated interest in keeping SPAG running, the Invitation to Offer was not circulated to the appellant. No compelling explanation was provided for this somewhat remarkable omission. Yet another noteworthy and unusual feature of the Invitation to Offer was its highly accelerated and condensed timeline, as outlined below:', '(a)\\u20033 July 2020 \u2013 Execution of non-disclosure agreements;', '(b)\\u20036 July 2020 \u2013 Non-public information released to qualified parties;', '(c)\\u200310 July 2020 \u2013 Expressions of interest due;', '(d)\\u200313 July 2020 \u2013 Dataroom opens to shortlisted bidders;', '(e)\\u200331 July 2020 \u2013 Dataroom closes;', '(f)\\u20034 August 2020 \u2013 Submissions of binding offers; and', '(g)\\u2003September to October 2020 \u2013 Target closing period.', '25\\u2003The third odd feature of the second and third respondents\u2019 Invitation to Offer was that it misleadingly and falsely indicated at the footer of the document that the second and third respondents were \u201cappointed Joint and Several Liquidators of Super Park Asia Group Pte Ltd pursuant to resolutions passed by the board of directors of the Company on 17 June 2020\u201d. No such resolutions appointing the second and third respondents as joint and several liquidators had been passed, and the second and third respondents had only been appointed as provisional liquidators. While there was in fact a reference in the main body of the text to the second and third respondents being \u201cprovisional liquidators\u201d, the timeline outlined above from [24(a)] to [24(g)] clearly and unambiguously envisaged the second and third respondents continuing as liquidators even after the termination of their term as provisional liquidators on 16 July 2020. This was despite the clear indications from the appellant, which was the majority shareholder in SPAG, that it would not be voting to pass a special resolution to wind up the company.', '26\\u2003A further unusual circumstance which was raised at the hearing of SUM 2791 on 14 July 2020 was the continued failure by the second and third respondents to identify who was paying their fees and funding their work, particularly given the position they had taken that SPAG had only \u20ac5,000 in cash in its accounts. While the Judge speculated during the hearing that it \u201cmust be Kumarasinhe\u201d funding the second and third respondents, counsel for the second and third respondents effectively evaded the point and did not address the issue. We address this issue subsequently at [101] below, but note at this juncture that the hearing on 14 July 2020 was adjourned due to lack of time, with the Judge ordering that the second and third respondents were not to take any steps to dispose of SPAG\u2019s assets pending further hearing of the summons.', '27\\u2003The further hearing of the summons was fixed on 17 July 2020, but we first outline what transpired at the EGM and Creditors\u2019 Meeting on 16 July 2020, one month after the second and third respondents had been appointed as provisional liquidators. At the EGM, which was attended by all of SPAG\u2019s shareholders or their proxies, the third respondent chaired the session. Two resolutions were considered and voted upon. The first was a special resolution to \u201capprove that the Company cannot by reason of its liabilities continue its business and accordingly that [it] be wound up voluntarily\u201d. The appellant and Vintex voted against this resolution, with Treasure\u2019s proxy, Kumarasinhe, voting for it. The resolution failed. The second resolution was an ordinary resolution to approve the appointment of the second and third respondents to act jointly and severally as liquidators of SPAG for the purpose of winding up. The appellant and Vintex once again voted against this resolution, with Treasure voting for it. This resolution also failed.', '28\\u2003Shortly after the EGM on 16 July 2020, which concluded at around 4.30pm, the Creditors\u2019 Meeting commenced, at around 5.00pm. In attendance were, inter alia, the second and third respondents, Kumarasinhe, the second and third respondents\u2019 legal counsel, and a number of special proxies and creditors. The voting share of each creditor who submitted a proof of debt, along with its appointed proxy (if any), is as reflected below:', '', '29\\u2003Six resolutions were put to the Creditors\u2019 Meeting. Of particular note were the following resolutions, which are reproduced together with their status and accumulated votes:', '(a)\\u2003First, a resolution confirming the appointment of the second and third respondents as joint and several liquidators of the company was put to the meeting. All the creditors save the proxies for the appellant and Boost OY voted for this resolution, and it thus was carried by 65.39% to 34.61% of the votes by percentage of debt held.', '(b)\\u2003Second, a resolution providing that the books, accounts, and records of SPAG and the second and third respondents were to be destroyed one day after the dissolution of SPAG pursuant to s 320(3) of the Companies Act if no Committee of Inspection was formed was also put to the meeting. The proxies for the appellant and Boost OY once again voted against this resolution, while Grandwork Interior (Thailand) Co. Ltd abstained. The resolution was thus carried with 60.37% voting for, 34.61% against, and 5.02% abstaining.', '30\\u2003It is thus in this context, where the second and third respondents had failed to win the relevant support of the members of the company, but had received the support of the majority of the creditors of the company, that SUM 2791 was again heard before the Judge on 17 July 2020. SUM 2791 was heard alongside SUM 2859\/2020 (\u201cSUM 2859\u201d), an application by the appellant for the Judge\u2019s injunction granted in OS 656 to be set aside. The crux of the second and third respondents\u2019 case at the hearing of 17 July 2020 was that once provisional liquidators were appointed, SPAG was in provisional liquidation and could not cease to be so except by an express order of Court. However, when the Judge continued to ask who was funding the provisional liquidators, counsel for the second and third respondents did not directly answer the question, focusing instead on how the fact that liquidators\u2019 fees are taxed by the Court meant that the independence of the liquidators was not impugned regardless of who the funders were.', '31\\u2003The matter was subsequently adjourned for the appellants to submit on their plans for the rehabilitation of SPAG, and for further legal arguments. It was heard again on 20 and 29 July 2020. On 29 July 2020, the Judge made the following order in resolution of both SUM 2791 and SUM 2859 (\u201cthe Judge\u2019s Order\u201d):', '32\\u2003On 23 September 2020, the appellant filed the present appeal (CA 160\/2020) against the above order made by the Judge, in so far as the order related to OS 671 and SUM 2791. Leave to appeal had been entered by consent of both parties on 25 August 2020. However, in the interest of outlining matters in a chronological fashion, we will first outline the appellant\u2019s application for judicial management in HC\/OS 761\/2020 (\u201cOS 761\u201d), which pre-dated the filing of this appeal.', '33\\u2003On 5 August 2020, the appellant commenced OS 761 for SPAG to be placed under judicial management pursuant to s 91 of the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act (No 40 of 2018) (\u201cIRDA\u201d). On the same day, the appellant also filed SUM 3235\/2020 (\u201cSUM 3235\u201d) for SPAG to be placed under interim judicial management (\u201cIJM\u201d). SUM 3235 was heard before Ang Cheng Hock J (\u201cAng J\u201d) on 21 August 2020.', '34\\u2003At the hearing of SUM 3235, the appellant argued that SPAG should be placed under IJM because, even on the second and third respondents\u2019 own figures and averments, it was insolvent. Further, there was at least a prima facie case that placing the company under IJM would achieve one or more of the statutorily-prescribed objectives under s 89 of the IRDA, particularly given the appellant\u2019s plans to rehabilitate the company through, inter alia, an injection of \u20ac2,000,000 to \u20ac3,000,000. The appellant also argued that failing to place SPAG under IJM would, under the terms of the Judge\u2019s Order, allow the second and third respondents to continue disposing of SPAG\u2019s assets and subsidiaries.', '35\\u2003The application for IJM was resisted by Treasure in its capacity as a minority shareholder of SPAG, as well as by Lagotronics in its capacity as a creditor. At the hearing, it was argued by counsel for the second and third respondents that SPAG could not be placed under judicial management because it was already in liquidation. Reliance was placed on s 91(8)(a) of the IRDA, which expressly provides that a judicial management order must not be made in relation to a company after that company has gone into liquidation. In Kumarasinhe\u2019s affidavit filed on behalf of Treasure, it was further argued that (a) a good prima facie case that a judicial management order would in fact be made was not made out because the appellant\u2019s forecasts in relation to the prospects for SPAG\u2019s rehabilitation were overly optimistic, and (b) that the liquidators were in the midst of disposing the assets of the company and that this process should not be disrupted. All of these arguments were also adopted by Lagotronics in opposition to the making of an IJM order.', '36\\u2003At the hearing of the IJM application, counsel for the second and third respondent, appearing as counsel for SPAG, sought an adjournment of the proceedings on the basis that SPAG was in liquidation and ought to apply for and obtain a stay under the IRDA before it could apply for judicial management. Ang J was unpersuaded. He observed that:', '37\\u2003The hearing of SUM 3235 thus proceeded on 21 August 2020, and Ang J granted an order in terms at the end of the hearing, with instructions for the interim judicial managers (\u201cIJMs\u201d), KPMG, to produce an interim report within four weeks. However, due to what the IJMs described in a letter to the Court dated 28 September 2020 as a failure by the second and third respondents to hand over information in a timely fashion despite having agreed to do so, and the second and third respondents having been \u201cselective in terms of the records to be handed over to the IJMs\u201d, an extension of time for submission of the interim report was sought. This was granted, and the interim report was eventually provided to the Court on 9 October 2020.', '38\\u2003In the interim report, the IJMs outlined a restructuring proposal submitted by the appellant and SuperPark Bidco Oy. That restructuring proposal envisaged injecting at least \u20ac2m into SPAG and SP BKK of which (a) \u20ac1m will, subject to proof of debts, be used to settle liabilities of SP BKK given that certain creditors of SP BKK are alleged to have corporate guarantee claims against SPAG, and (b) \u20ac1m will be used to pay the remaining unrelated creditors. Further, a debt conversion of the approximately \u20ac4m owed to the appellant and SuperPark Bidco Oy was also proposed, with the appellant and SuperPark Bidco Oy indicating that they were prepared to consider investing a further \u20ac2.5m to \u20ac3m into SPAG thereafter, subject to review of the full financial affairs of SPAG and its subsidiaries.', '39\\u2003The IJMs concluded in the interim report that the above-outlined proposal was \u201cat present the most viable prospect to achieve one or more of the statutory objectives of judicial management\u201d. We note for completeness that the present appeal in CA 160\/2020 was filed before the interim report prepared by the IJMs had been made available.'"}
{"casename":"2021_SGCA_80","fact":"'3\\u2003The parties were married on 24 November 2000. Throughout the entire marriage, the Wife was a homemaker and followed the Husband wherever his work took him. The Husband, on the other hand, worked as a proprietary trader for various companies. His work took him to many countries but eventually, in 2007, he secured a position based in Singapore as a fund manager at a company we will refer to as \u201cCompany T\u201d. The Wife joined him in Singapore, and they resided here for many years thereafter. The Husband returned to the UK in or around October 2020. The Wife and Child still live here.', '4\\u2003During their time in Singapore, the couple enjoyed a comfortable life. They purchased an apartment as their matrimonial home (\u201cMH\u201d) and lived there until they sold it in 2014. The Husband earned about $41,000 a month working in Singapore and later quit to set up his own company (which we will refer to as \u201cJ Singapore\u201d) in 2011. By his account, he set up J Singapore with a view to working less and spending more time with his son. Beyond this, and besides the fact that J Singapore develops \u201cother software and [engages in] programming activities\u201d, little is known about J Singapore.', '5\\u2003As for the Child, he was born in Korea to a surrogate mother (the Wife\u2019s sister-in-law) but effectively spent all his life in Singapore. He was aged 11 at the time of this hearing.', '6\\u2003According to the Wife, the marriage began deteriorating in 2012. Nonetheless, the parties continued to live together until 12 May 2014 when the Wife and the Child left and moved into a separate rental apartment. While there are conflicting accounts of what transpired on 12 May 2014, the following facts are undisputed:', '(a)\\u2003The Wife withdrew about $400,000 from the parties\u2019 joint bank account around the time she left to move into a separate apartment.', '(b)\\u2003By then, the Husband had also moved $5.2m (representing a portion of the proceeds from the sale of MH) from the couple\u2019s joint account to the bank account of a company in the Cayman Islands which we will refer to as J Cayman.', '7\\u2003The Wife made three divorce applications. The first was filed on 20 May 2014 and dismissed on 25 January 2017. The second was filed on 15 June 2017 but eventually withdrawn on 27 May 2019. The last was filed on 3 July 2019 and interim judgment (a provisional order of divorce, granted before courts address ancillary matters such as maintenance, custody, care and control of children and the division of matrimonial assets) was granted on 9 December 2019. The first two were pursued on the ground that the marriage had broken down irretrievably due to the Husband\u2019s unreasonable behaviour while the last was pursued on the ground that the marriage had broken down irretrievably as the parties had been living apart for at least four years.', '8\\u2003The divorce proceedings were plagued by multiple interlocutory applications. Every application was hotly contested. Interim maintenance orders would invariably be answered with requests for variations; interim care and control or custody orders would be challenged with stay applications, and requests to take the Child on holiday would be met with vigorous resistance. The Husband proved to be uncooperative and, at times, deeply hostile to the court itself. He refused to comply with court orders (prompting the Wife to take up enforcement proceedings to secure interim maintenance for her and the Child) and blamed unfavourable decisions on the judges hearing his case. Recusal applications were filed against the judges and the transcripts show that the Husband was not above casting aspersions on the judicial officers overseeing his case.', '9\\u2003This belligerence continued well after the interim judgment (\u201cIJ\u201d) was granted. The Husband kept the Child from the Wife (breaching court orders in the process), unilaterally cancelled the Child\u2019s student pass in Singapore and refused to cooperate meaningfully in any discovery\/interrogatory proceedings. The Judge who heard the ancillaries below was also the judge who had earlier heard the Wife\u2019s appeal against an initial relocation order granted by a lower court in favour of the Husband (the \u201cRelocation Order\u201d). In allowing the appeal, the Judge observed as follows:', '10\\u2003The Husband\u2019s failure to give full and frank disclosure of the extent of his assets greatly hampered the disposal of the ancillaries below. Indeed, in the grounds of decision (\u201cGD\u201d) on the ancillaries, the Judge remarked that his \u201ctask in [dividing up the matrimonial assets had] been greatly complicated by the Husband\u2019s persistent failure to disclose the full extent of the assets within his possession.\u201d He further observed:'"}
{"casename":"2021_SGCA_81","fact":"'3\\u2003On 7 July 2015, the appellant, Mr Andrew Loh Der Ming (\u201cLoh\u201d), engaged the respondent, Mr Koh Tien Hua (\u201cKoh\u201d), to represent him in his divorce proceedings. Loh was the plaintiff in the divorce proceedings, while the defendant was his wife and the co-defendant was a neighbour who Loh alleged had been in an adulterous relationship with his wife. Loh\u2019s wife withdrew her defence to adultery, while the co-defendant maintained his defence and denied that he had committed adultery. The co-defendant filed two summonses, one of which, FC\/SUM 2009\/2015 (\u201cSUM 2009\u201d), was to strike out certain parts of Loh\u2019s Statement of Particulars (\u201cSOP\u201d). These applications were heard by Assistant Registrar Eugene Tay (\u201cAR Tay\u201d) on 27 July 2015.', '4\\u2003At the hearing, Koh consented to various parts of the SOP being struck out and to this extent, it was recorded as a consent order. It was disputed whether Koh had been authorised to consent to this in the exercise of his professional judgment. When Loh learnt that the particulars had been struck out, he insisted that an appeal be filed. Koh did not at that stage inform Loh that the particulars had been struck out by consent or that a consent order cannot ordinarily be appealed. With much reluctance on Koh\u2019s part, after considerable delay, and purely because of Loh\u2019s insistence, Koh eventually filed the appeal. Loh subsequently discovered what had transpired at the hearing.', '5\\u2003On 12 May 2016, Loh lodged a complaint against Koh (\u201cComplaint Letter\u201d) with the Law Society of Singapore (\u201cSociety\u201d) which included the following (see Loh Der Ming Andrew v Law Society of Singapore [2018] 3 SLR 837 (\u201cAndrew Loh (pre-DT)\u201d) at [25]):', '(a)\\u2003Seven heads of complaint against Koh under s 85(1) of the LPA alleging against Koh:', '(b)\\u2003Six heads of complaint against Koh under s 75B of the LPA alleging that he:', '6\\u2003On 27 May 2016, the Society informed Loh that his complaints under s 75B of the LPA would only be referred to the Council of the Law Society (\u201cCouncil\u201d) for deliberation upon completion of the inquiry into his complaints under s 85(1) of the LPA (see Andrew Loh (pre-DT) at [26]).', '7\\u2003On 1 August 2016, the Inquiry Committee (\u201cIC\u201d) was constituted by the Chairman of the Inquiry Panel to inquire into the complaints under s 85(1) of the LPA. The IC found that only the third head of complaint was made out, but that no formal investigation by a DT was needed, and that Koh should be ordered to pay a penalty of $2,500.', '8\\u2003On 14 March 2017, the Society informed Loh that the Council had accepted the findings and recommendations of the IC (Andrew Loh (pre-DT) at [34]).', '9\\u2003Loh was dissatisfied with this decision and applied to court for an order directing the Society to apply to the Chief Justice (\u201cCJ\u201d) for the appointment of a DT pursuant to s 96(4)(b) of the LPA (Andrew Loh (pre-DT) at [37]). That application was heard by Woo Bih Li J (as he then was).', '10\\u2003On 17 October 2017, Woo J issued his judgment, directing the Society to apply to the CJ for the appointment of a DT to investigate the following two heads of complaint which were stated in the Complaint Letter (Andrew Loh (pre-DT) at [170]) (\u201cWoo J\u2019s remit\u201d):', '11\\u2003A DT was duly constituted comprising Dr Stanley Lai SC and Ms Tan Gee Tuan (\u201cDT1\u201d). On 25 October 2017, Loh submitted his complaint and Statement of Case to DT1. Loh brought a total of 14 charges against Koh, arising out of seven alleged acts. Two charges were brought in respect of each alleged wrongful act, one under s 83(2)(b) of the LPA for \u201cfraudulent or grossly improper conduct in the discharge of his professional duty\u201d and one under s 83(2)(h) of the LPA for \u201cmisconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession\u201d. The 14 charges are summarised at Annex A to this judgment.', '12\\u2003On 24 July 2019, DT1 issued a report finding Koh guilty of the Fourth and Sixth charges, but acquitted him of all the other charges. DT1 also questioned whether it was appropriate for the Eleventh to Fourteenth charges to have been brought before it since they seemed to fall outside the scope of Woo J\u2019s order. DT1 found that Koh\u2019s misconduct in relation to the Fourth and Sixth charges did not constitute cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action under s 83 of the LPA, and thus did not recommend that the matter be advanced to the C3J. Instead, DT1 recommended a penalty of $10,000, or such sum that the Council shall determine under s 94(3)(a) of the LPA as being sufficient and appropriate to Koh\u2019s misconduct. DT1 also ordered Koh to bear 25% of Loh\u2019s costs for the proceedings before DT1.', '13\\u2003On 8 August 2019, Loh filed HC\/OS 1015\/2019 (\u201cOS 1015\u201d) applying for the High Court to review the entirety of DT1\u2019s determination pursuant to s 97 of the LPA, save for the findings that Koh was guilty of the Fourth and Sixth charges. This was heard before the Judge on 6 November 2019.', '14\\u2003At the time of the hearing before the Judge, the Council had yet to decide whether to accept the determination of DT1. However, we inferred that the Council was inclined to accept the determination of DT1 because it would otherwise have been required to advance the matter to the C3J within a month, but it had not done so (see s 94(3)(b) of the LPA).'"}

We consider t hat, in such cases, the appellate \ncourt would be perfectly entitled to decline to adjust the parties\u2019 percentage \nshares . After all, it is well established that an appellate court will be slow to \nmake minor adjustments for idiosyncratic reasons (see the dec ision of this court \nin Koh Bee Choo v Choo Chai Huah  [2007] SGCA 21 at [46]) . It would, \nhowever, be prudent for the appellate court to expressly articulate its reason for \ndeclining to do so, in order to forestall allegations of arithmetical errors.  \n26 Third, our decision should not be construed as a licence for parties to re -\nlitigate the values of the matrimonial assets or the amounts of their respective \nfinancial contributions. As explained in ANJ v ANK  at [23] and at [ 22], at the \nfirst step of the ANJ approach , the court ordinarily ascertains  the amount of each \nparty\u2019s financial contribution in a \u201cbroad brush\u201d manner. That remains \nunchanged by our present decision. It is trite that an appellate court will only \ninterfere with a trial judge\u2019s exercise of discretion in exceptional circumstances \n(see the decision of this court in Lock Yeng Fun v Chua Hock Chye [2007] \nVersion No 1: 12 Aug 2021 (11:43 hrs) \nVJP v VJQ  [2021] SGCA 82 \n \n \n11 3 SLR(R) 520  at [36]), and nothing in this decision should be interpreted as \nsuggesting otherwise. What this case is  concerned with is the specific question \nof whether the parties\u2019 respective percentage shares should be recomputed \nfollowing the reduction of the matrimo nial pool.  \n27 The husband does not advance any compelling argument in support of \nhis position that the parties\u2019 percentage shares should not be recomputed. He \nmerely submits that the apportionment of matrimonial assets is a matter for the \ncourt\u2019s discretion and that the court should adopt a \u201cbroad brush \u201d approach to \narrive at a \u201crough and ready approximation\u201d. We are unpersuaded by this \nsubmission. As we have already highlighted, the appellant is not challenging the \nDistrict Judge\u2019s or the Judge\u2019s exercise of  discretion in apportioning the \nmatrimonial assets . Instead, the present dispute lies in whether the exclusion of \nthe Primefield shares and the undisbursed loan amount for the Condominium \nwarrants a concomitant recalculation of the ratio of the parties\u2019 di rect \ncontributions and, consequently, the overall division ratio. This is, in our view, \na purely arithmetical exercise in which the court\u2019s discretion hardly features, \nsave in the instances we have highlighted at [ 25] above. In any event, the \nhusband\u2019s objection is untenable \u2013 even where the court does exercise its broad \ndiscretion, appellate intervention will be warranted where the decision is \n\u201cclearly inequitable or  wrong in principle \u201d [emphasis added] (see TNL v TNK  \nat [53]). In our view, the Judge , with respect,  plainly erred in principle in so far \nas he failed to properly apply the ANJ approach.  \n28 In the light of the Judge\u2019s decision , the parties\u2019 relative direct \ncontributions have clearly changed and the division ratio should hence be \nrecalibrated.  We begin with the table below, which reflects  the parties\u2019 direct \ncontributions as ascertained by the District Judge:  \nVersion No 1: 12 Aug 2021 (11:43 hrs) \nVJP v VJQ  [2021] SGCA 82 \n \n \n12  The wife\u2019s \ncontribution  The husband\u2019s \ncontribution  \nSole assets  $291,453.91  $820,577.03  \nHDB flat  0.365 x $535,000 \n= $195,275  0.635 x $535,000 = \n$339,725  \nCondominium  0.42 x \n$658,188.81 = \n$276,439.30  0.58 x $658,188.81 \n= $381,749.51  \nTotal  $291,453.91 + \n$195,275 + \n$276,439.30 = \n$763,168.21  $820,577.03 + \n$339,725 + \n381,749.51 = \n$1,542,051.54  \nPercentage share of \nmatrimonial pool  $763,168.21 \/ \n($763,168.21 + \n$1,542,051.54) x \n100% = 33% \n(rounded off)  $1,542,051.54 \/ \n($763,168.21 + \n$1,542,051.54) x \n100% = 67% \n(rounded off)  \n29 The husband\u2019s sole as sets were valued at $820,577.03. This figure \nincludes the value of the Primefield shares ($140,000) and the husband\u2019s \ncontribution towards the Condominium, the net value of which was found to be \n$658,188.81. Following the Judge\u2019s decision, however, the Pri mefield shares \nshould be excluded from the husband\u2019s assets. The undisbursed loan amount of \n$176,250 for the Condominium should also be deducted such that the net value \nof the Condominium is now $481,938.81. The wife and the husband do not \nchallenge the Di strict Judge\u2019s finding that they had contributed 42% and 58% \nto the acquisition of the Condominium  respectively . \n30 The exclusion of the Primefield shares and the undisbursed loan amount \nfor the Condominium from the matrimonial pool means that the reduced \nmatrimonial pool should be valued at $1,988,969.75 ( ie, $2,305,219.75 - \nVersion No 1: 12 Aug 2021 (11:43 hrs) \nVJP v VJQ  [2021] SGCA 82 \n \n \n13 $140,000 - $176,250).

As his sole assets are now valued at \n$680,577.03 (see [ 30] above), he should receive $1,097,911.30 - $680,577.03 = \n$417,334.27 from the parties\u2019 joint assets. As the husband wishes to take over \nthe HDB flat, which is worth $535,000,  he should pay the wife a further sum of \n$535,000 - $417,334.27 = $117,665.73.  \n33 We pause to deal briefly with the wife\u2019s submission that a 5% uplift \nshould be applied to her 44.8% share of the matrimonial assets such that she \nwould be entitled to 47% of the  matrimonial assets. She argues that such an \nuplift is warranted as \u201ccompensation\u201d for the exclusion of the Primefield shares \nfrom the matrimonial pool.

For the first offence, sometime in 2008, at a public swimming complex, the appellant used his penis to penetrate the victim\u2019s anus while they were in the shower together. The victim was then 10 years old. For the second offence, sometime in 2011, in their family apartment, the appellant used his penis to penetrate the victim\u2019s anus. No one else was in the apartment at that time. Before committing the offence, the appellant used his mobile phone to check his then-wife\u2019s location and upon confirming that she was a distance away from the apartment, he asked the victim to stand at the apartment\u2019s main door and to keep an eye on the peep-hole in order to alert the appellant if his then-wife and her parents returned home. He then proceeded to penetrate the victim from behind in a standing position.', '4\\u2003Three other charges were taken into consideration for sentencing. The first concerned an outrage of modesty in 2008 when the appellant used his penis to rub against the victim\u2019s anus while they were sleeping together on a mattress in the living room of the victim\u2019s former family apartment. The appellant had stayed over because he was going out with the victim\u2019s family early the next morning. The other two charges concerned penile-anal penetration in the family apartment when the victim was 12 and 14 years old respectively.', '5\\u2003In all five offences, the victim did not consent to the sexual acts. He was afraid that if he revealed the incidents, his parents would scold him for what had happened or that the appellant would break up with his sister.', '6\\u2003In 2012, after watching an episode of Crime Watch on television featuring an adult assaulting a young boy sexually, the victim eventually revealed to his mother the sexual acts committed by the appellant against him. The victim\u2019s parents informed the appellant\u2019s then-wife. When she confronted the appellant about the victim\u2019s allegations, he admitted that he had sodomised the victim on a number of occasions at various locations. Thereafter, she filed for divorce and made a police report on 17 November 2014.', '7\\u2003After the appellant was called up by the police for the recording of his statement, he became uncontactable and avoided attempts by the police to reach him. He was finally arrested about four years later on 4 December 2018. By then, the appellant had re-married and was father to a child.', '8\\u2003The appellant was assessed by the Institute of Mental Health. He was found to have suffered an adjustment disorder due to the breakdown of his first marriage. It was also possible that he suffered from paedophilic disorder.

This entails purchasing fuel oil in bulk, storing and blending the fuel oil in storage tanks leased from Vopak Terminal Pte Ltd (\u201cVopak Terminal\u201d), and then selling the product from Vopak Terminal. In some of these sales, the bunkers were sold on an FOB basis for delivery to bunker barges. The bunker fuel loaded on board these bunker barges would then be on-sold by the respondent\u2019s customers to ocean-going vessels in Singapore. This is referred to as the sale of \u201cex-wharf bunkers\u201d.', '7\\u2003The appellant in CA 22 (\u201cthe CA 22 appellant\u201d) was the demise charterer of the vessel Luna.

The Buyers were subsidiaries of OW Bunker A\/S (\u201cOW Bunker\u201d), one of the world\u2019s largest bunker suppliers prior to its insolvency in 2014.', '9\\u2003The terms of the sale contracts were substantially similar and will be discussed in greater detail below. At this point, it suffices to highlight that the sale contracts incorporated the respondent\u2019s General Terms and Conditions for Sales of Marine Fuel February 2013 (\u201cGTC\u201d). The sale contracts also provided that payment for the bunkers would only become due upon the expiry of 30 calendar days after the certificate of quantity (\u201cCQ\u201d) date. In other words, the Buyers purchased the bunkers from the respondent on 30 days\u2019 credit.', '10\\u2003Pursuant to the sale contracts, the Buyers nominated the Vessels for loading of the bunkers at Vopak Terminal on various dates between 10 October 2014 and 29 October 2014.

In the event that the original CQ and the Vopak BLs were not yet in hand, the respondent would email scanned copies of the CQ and the Vopak BLs together with its invoice to the Buyers. Once in hand, only the original CQ would be couriered to the Buyers; the Vopak BLs would remain with the respondent until after payment was received. In this case, the respondent issued its invoices for the bunker shipments sometime after the loading dates, between 31 October 2014 and 5 November 2014.', '13\\u2003Meanwhile, the Vessels delivered the bunkers to various ocean-going vessels within several days from the date of loading. This was done without production of the original Vopak BLs, which were still in the respondent\u2019s possession at the material time. In the case of some of the Vessels, they returned to Vopak Terminal or went to another terminal in Singapore to load additional bunkers even before the previous shipment of bunkers had been fully discharged. This resulted in the commingling of bunkers on board.', '14\\u2003Sometime in November 2014, OW Bunker became insolvent and the Buyers defaulted on payment.

One of the main issues raised in the summary judgment proceedings was whether the Vopak BLs had been intended to operate as contractual documents and\/or as documents of title. While the respondent contended that the Vopak BLs were typical bills of lading and ought to be given their full force as such, the appellants submitted that the Vopak BLs merely functioned as acknowledgements of the receipt of the bunkers and did not operate as contractual documents and\/or as documents of title (see The Star Quest at [12]\u2013[13]).'"}

On the facts, Man Wah\u2019s offer would take a longer time to resolve the Company\u2019s problems than Golden Hill Capital\u2019s offer (at [74]).', '(d)\\u2003There was fair consideration by the JMs of the various alternative offers. The JMs provided equal opportunities to Man Wah and Golden Hill Capital to put in \u201canything further\u201d in respect of their original offers by 26 August 2020. Even when the Phua Group had emphasised the urgent need to complete the SPA, the JMs had agreed to Man Wah\u2019s request to extend the deadline to put in further matters to 31 August 2020 (at [75] and [77]).', '(e)\\u2003The Shareholders had not established that the JMs had caused them any prejudice, much less unfair prejudice. The JMs could not be faulted for any plainly wrongful, conspicuously unfair or perverse conduct (at [83]).', '13\\u2003The Judge also ordered the Shareholders to pay S$18,000 in costs to the Phua Group (\u201cPhua Group Costs Order\u201d) after hearing the parties on costs (GD at [84]).', '14\\u2003On 5 January 2021, the Shareholders filed the NOA against the \u201cwhole of the [Judge\u2019s decision on 24 November 2020] dismissing the [Shareholders\u2019] application vide HC\/SUM 3963\/2020 and against the cost orders made in relation thereto on 22 December 2020\u201d [emphasis added]. The NOA was served on the JMs but not on the Phua Group. The Phua Group only came to know that the NOA had been filed when the JM\u2019s solicitors wrote to the Phua Group\u2019s solicitors on the same day (ie, 5 January 2021) informing them that the NOA had been filed and that \u201cthe outcome of the appeal [might] potentially affect [the Phua Group\u2019s] rights under the [SPA]\u201d.', '15\\u2003On 28 May 2021, the Shareholders filed the Appellant\u2019s Case, the Form of the Core Bundle, the Appeals Information Sheet, and the Form of the Record of Appeal in CA 1.

On the same day, the JMs\u2019 solicitors confirmed that the JMs had no objections to the Phua Group filing a Respondent\u2019s Case. On 3 June 2021, the Shareholders\u2019 solicitors replied to object to the Phua Group\u2019s participation on the basis that there was \u201cno necessity and basis\u201d for it to do so.', '17\\u2003Following this, the Phua Group requested that a Case Management Conference (\u201cCMC\u201d) be held for the parties to obtain directions on the Phua Group\u2019s entitlement to participate in CA 1. During the CMC, which was held before AR Gan Kam Yuin (\u201cAR Gan\u201d) on 10 June 2021, the Shareholders reiterated their objection to the Phua Group\u2019s participation in the appeal. AR Gan considered that it was for this Court to give the directions sought by the Phua Group. Consequently, AR Gan gave timelines for the Phua Group to file the present application, in the event that the Shareholders continued to object to its participation in the appeal. To avoid holding up the timelines, AR Gan also directed the Phua Group to serve its Respondent\u2019s Case on the Shareholders and the JMs (without filing the Case on eLitigation) by 30 June 2021.', '18\\u2003As the Shareholders continued to object to the Phua Group\u2019s participation in CA 1, the present application was filed on 18 June 2021.'"}
{"casename":"2021_SGCA_86","fact":"the facts show that there was either no cause of action to speak of, \nor that the value of any such cause of action to the Estate would be minimal or \nnon-existent.\n10 In relation to the 2007 Transaction, we see no reason to depart from the \nJudge\u2019s findings at [27] of the GD that the $200,000 withdrawal was not done \nby or for the benefit of Ms Chye Moi June. Hence, having asked Ms Chye Moi \nJune what happened with this sum of money and having received her answer \nwhich was consistent with the facts, the respondent was entitled to accept that \nresponse and not pursue the matter further. \n11 We turn to the 2014 Transaction, which was a withdrawal of $15,300 by \nMs Chye Moi June from the OCBC Joint Account for the purpose of \nsubscribing to a rights issue of OCBC shares on the Testator\u2019s behalf without \nthe Testator\u2019s consent. Here, we also find that the respondent had not breached \nhis duty as executor. Even if we assume that Ms Chye Moi June had breached \nher duty as resulting trustee in withdrawing the said funds, and even if there was \na cause of action arising from that breach, we find that the cause of action would \nbe of no value to the Estate. No loss was actually caused to the Estate, as the \nshares subscribed for were in fact included in the Schedule of Assets and the \nStatement of Accounts, and the shares had appreciated in value. The assets, far \nfrom being reduced by Ms Chye Moi June\u2019s actions, were in fact increased by \nthat act, a fact accepted by the appellant in cross-examination. As these facts \nVersion No 1: 09 Sep 2021 (11:22 hrs)\nChye Seng Kait v Chye Seng Fong[2021] SGCA 86\n7were provided by Ms Chye Moi June to the respondent upon his inquiry, it was \nreasonable for him not to pursue the matter further. \nThe Killiney Property \n12 In relation to the Killiney Property, we find that the respondent had no \nreason to inquire further into the division of the sale proceeds as, in truth, the \nequal division of those proceeds accurately reflected the Testator\u2019s and \nMs Chye Moi June\u2019s respective shares in the property. The parties\u2019 dispute turns \non how a loan for 34% of the purchase price of the Killiney Property should be \ntreated \u2013 the appellant argues that half of it should be attributed to the Testator, \nwhile the respondent argues that all of it was Ms Chye Moi June\u2019s contribution \nto the purchase price. \n13 As this court held in Su Emmanuel v Emmanuel Priya Ethel Anne and \nanother [2016] 3 SLR 122 (\u201cSu Emmanuel\u201d) at [89], the central issue when such \narguments are raised is the responsibility that was undertaken by each party for \nthe loan repayments at the time the property was acquired, with the crucial \nconsideration being the parties\u2019 intentions as to the ultimate source of funds. We \nfind, on the evidence, that it was intended by the Testator and Ms Chye Moi \nJune that the latter would be solely responsible for repayment of the loan as her \ncontribution to the purchase price.\n(a) The nature of the loan shows that the liability to repay was taken \non by Ms Chye Moi June alone as the sole borrower. The Testator was \ninvolved only as a co-mortgagor and had only a secondary liability. The \nmere fact that the Testator, as co-owner of the property, was a co-\nmortgagor is not significant given that the bank would naturally wish to \nhave a claim over the whole property rather than just a half-share, a point \nsimilar to that made by this court at [90] of Su Emmanuel.\nVersion No 1: 09 Sep 2021 (11:22 hrs)\nChye Seng Kait v Chye Seng Fong[2021] SGCA 86\n8(b) The appellant\u2019s own testimony supports this finding, when he \nclaimed that the Testator was dissatisfied with the arrangement with his \ndaughter because they had contemplated equal contributions in cash, \nand he was not happy with the fact that Ms Chye Moi June had financed \nher contribution partly with a loan. Assuming that the appellant\u2019s \ntestimony on this is true, this is evidence in favour of the respondent\u2019s \nposition that the Testator and Ms Chye Moi June had intended to make \nequal contributions to the purchase price as any dissatisfaction was only \nwith the manner in which Ms Chye Moi June financed her contribution \nto half of the purchase price. \n(c) The parties\u2019 conduct during their co-ownership of the Killiney \nProperty is consistent with this understanding. At no time did the \nTestator contribute to repayment of the loan. Under cross-examination, \nthe appellant also conceded that he had no quarrel with fact that only \nhalf of the rental income was given to the Testator.\n(d) Upon the sale of the Killiney Property, the sale proceeds were \ndivided in half, and the amount repaid to the Central Provident Fund \n(\u201cCPF\u201d) Board for withdrawals from Ms Chye Moi June\u2019s CPF account \n(part of which was used to service the loan) as well as the redemption \namount paid to the bank were deducted entirely from Ms Chye Moi \nJune\u2019s share.\n14 Hence, it follows that (a) there is no reason for equity to depart from the \nposition in law that the Testator and Ms Chye Moi June were tenants in common \nin equal shares; (b) the sale proceeds were properly distributed in 2007; and \n(c) there was nothing for the respondent to inquire into when he became \nexecutor of the Estate.\nVersion No 1: 09 Sep 2021 (11:22 hrs)\nChye Seng Kait v Chye Seng Fong[2021] SGCA 86\n9Deduction of legal expenses\n15 The appellant also submits that the respondent had wrongfully deducted \ncertain legal expenses from the Estate. He claimed that the respondent had \nincurred those expenses unreasonably as part of his refusal to make the proper \ninquiries. Given the conclusions above, there is no case to be made on this point \nas we have found that the respondent had acted properly. We therefore conclude \nthat these legal expenses were properly deducted as testamentary and \nadministrative expenses (see Foo Jee Boo at [77]).\nDistribution of the Estate\n16 Finally, the appellant claims that the respondent had breached his duty \nby attaching a condition that the appellant countersign and accept the Statement \nof Account before the Cheque for his share of the residuary estate would be \nreleased to the appellant. We find no merit in this argument. \u201cAn assent \u2026 may \nbe given upon a condition precedent\u201d (see Alexander Learmonth et al, Williams, \nMortimer and Sunnucks on Executors, Administrators and Probate \n(Sweet & Maxwell, 21st Ed, 2018) at para 76\u201319). The condition imposed in \nthis case was entirely proper. The appellant\u2019s potential interest was only in the \nresiduary estate, as cl 3 of the Will makes clear. Hence, his share was \u201c[s]ubject \nto the payment of [the Testator\u2019s] debts, funeral and testamentary expenses and \nall estate duty payable\u201d, including legal expenses, as discussed above. If the \nappellant continued to press his objections (as he did), that would result in \nfurther legal expenses being incurred. Ultimately, if the objections were \nunmeritorious, then the Estate would have been put to expense without a \ncorresponding increase in the assets of the Estate. Given the nature of the \nresiduary estate, it was entirely appropriate for the respondent to withhold \nVersion No 1: 09 Sep 2021 (11:22 hrs)\nChye Seng Kait v Chye Seng Fong[2021] SGCA 86\n10distribution until it was clear that no further expenses would be incurred in the \nadministration of the Estate.\nConclusion\n17 We are therefore of the view that the appellant\u2019s claims are without \nmerit. As a further point, we note that the appellant had also sought an account \non a common basis, which is not contingent on a finding of misconduct (see the \ndecision of the High Court in Lalwani Shalini Gobind and another v Lalwani \nAshok Bherumal [2017] SGHC 90 (\u201cLalwani\u201d) at [20] and [25]). However, in \nthe present case, the account on a common basis has been sought only as a \nremedy in the alternative to the removal of the respondent as sole executor and, \nfor the reasons set out above, we do not see any basis for granting the appellant \nany remedy for alleged wrongdoing by the respondent. We also note that an \naccount on a common basis would not extend to what the appellant actually \nseeks, as the taking of a common account only extends to \u201cwhat was actually \nreceived and [the executor\u2019s] disbursement and distribution of it\u201d, and not what \n\u201che might have received had it not been for the default\u201d (see the decision of this \ncourt in Ong Jane Rebecca v Lim Lie Hoa and others [2005] SGCA 4 at [55], \ncited in Lalwani at [25]). In reality, therefore, the taking of an account on a \ncommon basis is not the real remedy sought by the appellant in this case, and in \nany event, it is not clear what else needs to be done given that the Statement of \nAccount has already been provided. \nVersion No 1: 09 Sep 2021 (11:22 hrs)\nChye Seng Kait v Chye Seng Fong[2021] SGCA 86\n1118 For the foregoing reasons, we dismiss"}

{"casename":"2021_SGCA_89","fact":"the facts of the present case, it was our view that \nallowing intervention in criminal proceedings was not required by the \u201cjustice \nof the case\u201d. Indeed, instead of ensuring that a fair trial would be conducted, the \nintervention procedure being sought to be introduced would be susceptible to \nabuse. We elaborate on the reasons for our view below, with reference to both \nunrelated and related criminal proceedings. \n34 In so far as unrelated criminal proceedings are concerned, we have \nalready explained at [ 21]\u2013[ 23] above that the court lacks jurisdiction to grant \nleave to an unrelated party to intervene even if the applicant has an interest in a \npoint of law under consideration. As such, an application for intervention in an \nunrelated criminal proceeding cannot be necessary for the purposes of justice. \nNor can there be any question of injustice arising from the denial of such an \napplication. \n35 In so far as related criminal proceedings are concerned, the \u201cjustice of \nthe case\u201d would ordinarily dictate that criminal cases emanating from the same \ncriminal transaction or incident should be tried together. This is reflected by \ns 143 of the CPC, which sets out the situations where persons may be charged \nand tried together, and s 144 of the CPC, which sets out the situations where \npersons may be charged separately and tried together. Apart from s 145 of the \nCPC, which allows for joint trials to take place by consent, the court has power \nto order joint trials where there is some connection between the offences \ncommitted by the accused persons, such as where the persons are accused of the \nsame or different offences committed in the same transaction (ss 143(a) and \n(b)); or where those offences arise from the same series of acts, whether or not \nthose acts form the same transaction (s 144(a)). \nVersion No 2: 22 Sep 2021 (14:46 hrs)\nIskandar bin Rahmat v PP[2021] SGCA 89\n1536 This notwithstanding, we note that there is no precedent or legislative \nmechanism allowing a party \u2013 even a related party \u2013 to intervene in another \ncriminal proceeding, save in one very limited exception. That exception is the \nAttorney-General\u2019s power to intervene in private prosecutions, as provided for \nunder s 13 of the CPC and reflected in Art 35(8) of the Constitution (see \nAttorney-General v Tee Kok Boon [2008] 2 SLR(R) 412; Cheng William v Loo \nNgee Long Edmund [2001] 2 SLR(R) 626 at [15]\u2013[17]). This stems from the \nAttorney-General\u2019s \u201cunique and integral role as the guardian of the public \ninterest vis-\u00e0-vis the institution and conduct of all criminal proceedings\u201d (Aurol \nAnthony Sabastian v Sembcorp Marine Ltd [2013] 2 SLR 246 at [53]). \n37 It appears to us that the complete absence of any prior attempt by an \naccused person to intervene in another criminal proceeding can be attributed to \none very sensible reason. Although intervention allows the applicant intervener \nto participate in another criminal proceeding, the outcome of that proceeding \nwould not determine the applicant\u2019s criminal liability. This is because s 132 of \nthe CPC provides that, subject to exceptions such as that of joint trials, there \nmust be a separate charge for every distinct offence of which any person is \naccused, and every charge must be tried separately. As such, where an accused \nperson intervenes in another criminal proceeding, he still has to be separately \ntried for each of the charges that he faces and is not bound by the outcome of \nthe intervention. Unlike in a civil proceeding where intervention allows the \ncourt to determine any question or issue arising between the intervenor and any \nparty to the cause or matter (see O 15 r 6(2)(b)(ii) of the ROC), intervention in \na criminal proceeding serves no such purpose. Intervention may also be a \nfruitless endeavour where, for instance, the Prosecution chooses to run a \ndifferent case against the applicant, or the applicant\u2019s liability is based on certain \ngrounds which are not in issue in the proceedings in which intervention is \nVersion No 2: 22 Sep 2021 (14:46 hrs)\nIskandar bin Rahmat v PP[2021] SGCA 89\n16sought. In such instances, the applicant\u2019s intervention may not help to advance \nhis own case. Furthermore, if the case against the applicant proceeds after the \nintervention is spent, the conduct of the case against such an applicant may be \nsubject to subsequent events or developments which may or may not be \nanticipated in the criminal proceeding in which the applicant intervened. \n38   The fact that intervention does not determine the applicant\u2019s criminal \nliability also means that it is potentially subject to abuse. Instead of applying for \na joint trial, an offender might seek to intervene in a related criminal proceeding \nfor strategic reasons, such as to obtain a preview of the Prosecution\u2019s evidence,  \nthe cross-examination questions and the reaction and responses of the judge \nwhich the offender would be expected to face in his or her own separate trial. \nThis may lead to offenders tailoring their evidence with the benefit not of \nhindsight but of foresight.  \n39 In our view, on the rare occasions when accused persons who were \nallegedly involved in the same criminal transaction or incident are not tried \ntogether for whatever reason, the proper response would be to apply for the \ncharges against the related accused persons to be tried together rather than to \nseek leave to intervene. Such an application was made, albeit by the \nProsecution, in Public Prosecutor v Ridhaudin Ridhwan bin Bakri and others \n[2019] SGHC 105. In that case, the High Court considered that it had the power \nto grant the Prosecution\u2019s application for a joint trial of three accused persons \nunder ss 143(b) and\/or (c) of the CPC, and a joint trial was ordered \naccordingly (at [41]). In our view, there is no reason in principle why an accused \nperson cannot similarly make an application to be jointly tried with related \naccused persons pursuant to ss 143 or 144 of the CPC. By instead applying to \nintervene in another proceeding, an applicant is attempting to bypass the \nrestrictions (see [ 35] above) which determine when cases are intended to be \nVersion No 2: 22 Sep 2021 (14:46 hrs)\nIskandar bin Rahmat v PP[2021] SGCA 89\n17tried together, and obtain a right to be heard in a proceeding in which his own \ncriminal liability would not be decided.\n40 In the present case, the only reason given by the Applicant to justify his \nintervention was that he would be able to raise an additional argument to \nsupport Teo\u2019s constitutional challenge in CCA 36, ie, that ss 299 and 300(a) of \nthe Penal Code violate Article 12 in that an offender convicted under s 299 has \na \u201cright to mitigate\u201d, whereas an offender convicted under s 300(a) would have \nno right to do so, even though the requirements for the two offences overlap. \nHowever, this purported justification suffered from a serious drawback. It \nignored the fact that it is the prerogative of Teo and his counsel to decide on the \narguments which should be placed before the court in CCA 36. Teo may wish \nto disassociate himself from the \u201cadditional\u201d argument for whatever reason. But \nif he chooses to adopt it, there is no reason why that argument cannot be made \nby his own counsel. \n41 In this connection, we note that similar observations have been made in \nthe context of intervention in appellate civil proceedings.

{"casename":"2021_SGCA_9","fact":"'3\\u2003The dispute between the parties arose out of a Management Services Agreement (\u201cManagement Agreement\u201d) entered into between the appellants and the first respondent, Global Gaming Philippines LLC (\u201cGGAM\u201d), on 9 September 2011. By cl 19.3 thereof, the Management Agreement was governed by the law of the Republic of the Philippines. Pursuant to the Management Agreement, GGAM was to manage the development and operation of the Solaire Resort and Casino (the \u201cSolaire Casino\u201d), an integrated resort and casino located in Manila, Philippines. GGAM subsequently assigned and conveyed all of its rights and obligations under the Management Agreement to the second respondent, GGAM Netherlands BV (\u201cGGAM Netherlands\u201d). GGAM is the sole owner of GGAM Netherlands.', '4\\u2003At the material time, the respondents had four senior executives who are of relevance to the present appeal (see Judgment at [11]) (collectively, the \u201cGGAM principals\u201d), namely:', '(a)\\u2003Mr William P Weidner (\u201cMr Weidner\u201d), who was Chairman and Chief Executive Officer;', '(b)\\u2003Mr Bradley Stone (\u201cMr Stone\u201d), who was President;', '(c)\\u2003Mr Garry W. Saunders (\u201cMr Saunders\u201d), who was Executive Vice President; and', '(d)\\u2003Mr Eric Chiu (\u201cMr Chiu\u201d), who was President for Asia.', '5\\u2003Before GGAM\u2019s formation, Mr Weidner was the President and Chief Operating Officer of LVS. He resigned from LVS in March 2009 in acrimonious circumstances. Mr Chiu was a director of LVS during Mr Weidner\u2019s tenure.', '6\\u2003Prior to his resignation from LVS, Mr Weidner and Mr Chiu were involved in three transactions for LVS that were subsequently investigated by the US Authorities and the audit committee of LVS for possible breaches of US law. When the appellants became aware of the investigation, an e-mail was sent to Mr Saunders by Ms Estela Tuason-Occena (\u201cMs Tuason-Occena\u201d) on behalf of the appellants on 14 August 2012 asking him about the status of the investigation, how he thought it would go, and how it would impact Mr Weidner, Mr Stone, and GGAM.', '7\\u2003Subsequently, on 15 August 2012, Mr Weidner sent Ms Tuason-Occena a statement that he claimed had been fully vetted by his lawyers. He said in this statement that while he was with LVS, he set a standard that required all business relationships and agreements under his purview to be thoroughly reviewed and vetted by legal and accounting professionals to ensure compliance with both US and foreign law. The appellants responded by noting that Mr Weidner\u2019s statement did not address their concerns, including the question as to whether or not he had been involved in the three transactions being investigated. Eventually, on 18 August 2012, Mr Weidner replied with a formal statement which indicated that he had participated at a \u201cstrategic level\u201d in many transactions, including those that Ms Tuason-Occena \u201cmay have read about\u201d. He claimed that:', 'In their submissions before us, the appellants referred to the 18 August 2012 statement as the \u201cAugust 2012 Lie\u201d but we prefer to refer to that statement and the earlier one on 15 August 2012, collectively and more neutrally, as the \u201c2012 Statements\u201d.', '8\\u2003The Solaire Casino began operations in mid-March 2013. On 12 July 2013, the appellants wrote to the respondents alleging that the latter had failed to comply with their obligations under the Management Agreement to provide the \u201crequired prudent management services\u201d. Amongst other breaches, the appellants alleged that the respondents had failed to bring in any foreign VIPs or junket operators in the four months during which the Solaire Casino had been operational. The appellants thus stated that they were exercising their right under cl 15.1(a) of the Management Agreement to terminate it because of a material breach. On 12 September 2013, the appellants issued a formal Notice of Termination of the Management Agreement on the basis of cl 15.1(a), ie, that GGAM had committed a material breach of the Agreement that was either incapable of remedy, or, if capable of remedy, had not been remedied within 30 days of notice or such longer period not exceeding 60 days. As the appellants described it before the Judge, the termination was largely due to the respondents\u2019 \u201cperceived non-performance with respect to delivering junket operators and foreign VIPs to [the Solaire Casino]\u201d.', '9\\u2003Practically immediately thereafter, the respondents commenced arbitration proceedings against the appellants for wrongful termination. The arbitration proceedings were bifurcated into liability and damages tranches and the Award pertained only to liability. Among the issues the arbitral tribunal (\u201cthe Tribunal\u201d) was asked to determine were: (a) whether the respondents had perpetrated \u201ccausal fraud\u201d by making false representations to the appellants which induced them into entering the Management Agreement; and (b) whether the appellants\u2019 termination of the Management Agreement was justified: see the Judgment at [59]. The appellants brought counterclaims in the arbitration but these are not relevant for present purposes.', '10\\u2003In the Award, the Tribunal held that under Philippines\u2019 law, \u201ccausal fraud\u201d may justify the rescission of a contract where the fraud is serious (meaning that it is sufficient to impress or to lead an ordinarily prudent person into error), is present at the time of \u201cbirth or perfection of the contract\u201d, and the evidence of it is full, clear and convincing. The appellants relied on a number of representations which had allegedly been made by the respondents, including that the GGAM principals had falsely projected an \u201cimage equating [GGAM] with [LVS]\u201d, and that through their collective experience at LVS, they had strong relationships with junket operators and data regarding individual foreign VIP players who they would bring into the Solaire Casino: see Judgment at [60].', '11\\u2003The Tribunal rejected the claims of misrepresentation and causal fraud. Among other things, the Tribunal found that there was no evidence to support the appellants\u2019 allegation that the respondents had represented they were the same entity as LVS. The Tribunal also held that, given the standing of the GGAM principals in the gaming industry, they did have access to \u201chigh rollers\u201d. There was ample evidence that both parties planned not to seek \u201chigh rollers\u201d until the Solaire Casino was sufficiently able to provide them with a pleasant experience, but the appellants terminated the Management Agreement before that point arrived. Similarly, the Tribunal rejected the appellants\u2019 contention that the respondents had represented they had operating policies, procedures and systems ready to be implemented. Rather, the respondents were contractually obliged to formulate the written policies and procedures through and in collaboration with the Solaire Casino. In fact, such policies were prepared by the Solaire Casino\u2019s staff in collaboration with the respondents and, in any event, any representation on the policies and procedures would not have been serious enough to falsely induce the appellants to enter into the Management Agreement.', '12\\u2003Before the Tribunal, the appellants submitted that the termination of the Management Agreement had been justified because of various irremediable breaches by the respondents. They asserted that even if the breaches were capable of being remedied, the appellants had continued to work with the respondents over the next 60 days in order to reach an amicable parting of ways but GGAM had not responded constructively. In contrast, the respondents asserted that no material breach had been identified and that the appellants had not given them an opportunity to cure their alleged breaches. Instead, as soon as the appellants sent the 12 July 2013 letter (see [8] above), they began to inform the Solaire Casino\u2019s management that GGAM\u2019s termination was a fait accompli and stopped providing it with the necessary access and information to perform its obligations. The grounds on which the appellants justified the termination of the Management Agreement have been summarised in the Judgment at [62(b)]. These grounds included a contention that the respondents failed to perform their obligations \u201cthrough the Management Team\u201d. The Tribunal found that there had been no material breaches by the respondents and, accordingly, that the appellants\u2019 termination of the Management Agreement was not justified.', '13\\u2003Shortly after the Award was released, the respondents filed proceedings in the High Court to enforce the Award. On 27 September 2016, the High Court made an order (\u201cORC 6609\u201d) which provided that the respondents would be at liberty to enter judgment against the appellants in the terms of the Award upon expiration of 14 days from the date of service of the order. The High Court entered judgment in terms of the Award on 20 June 2017, after the deadline for the appellants to apply to set aside ORC 6609 expired.', '14\\u2003On 21 December 2017, the appellants applied in HC\/OS 1432\/2017 (\u201cOS 1432\u201d) to set aside the judgment and resist enforcement of the Award on the basis of the FCPA Findings. While the SEC Order was published on 7 April 2016, prior to the issue of the Award on 20 September 2016, the DOJ Agreement was only published thereafter on 17 January 2017.', '15\\u2003It is now necessary to go into some detail regarding the SEC Order and the DOJ Agreement. These documents detailed findings in relation to alleged breaches of the two statutes in force in the United States: the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 15 USC (US) 1977 (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and the Securities Exchange Act 15 USC (US) 1934 (\u201cSECA\u201d).', '16\\u2003According to the SEC Order, until March 2009, LVS\u2019s operations in Macau and China were overseen by Mr Weidner, who worked in close concert with Mr Chiu. The SEC Order further stated that Mr Chiu had been introduced to a Chinese consultant (\u201cthe Consultant\u201d) by a high-level person with the China Liaison Office in Macau. With Mr Weidner\u2019s approval, the Consultant was hired to, amongst other things, act as an intermediary or a \u201cbeard\u201d to obscure LVS\u2019s role in certain transactions. The three transactions referred to in the SEC Order concerned:', '(a)\\u2003the purchase of a professional basketball team in China in 2007, in which the Consultant was used as a \u201cbeard\u201d to buy the team through a foreign-owned entity (\u201cthe Basketball Team transaction\u201d);', '(b)\\u2003the purchase of a building from a Chinese state-owned travel agency, China International Travel Services Ltd (\u201cCITS\u201d) again using the Consultant as a \u201cbeard\u201d; and', '(c)\\u2003the engagement of a ferry company (\u201cCKS\u201d), which was indirectly owned by, amongst others, the Consultant and the Chairman of CITS, for LVS\u2019s high-speed ferry business.', '17\\u2003The SEC found (a) that LVS violated s 13(b)(2)(A) of SECA because its books and records did not, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the purpose of the payments; and (b) that LVS had also violated s 13(b)(2)(B) of the same Act because it did not devise and maintain a reasonable system of internal accounting controls over operations in Macao and China to ensure that transactions were executed in accordance with management\u2019s authorisation and recorded as necessary to maintain accountability.', '18\\u2003The DOJ Agreement referred to the transactions in [16(a)] and [16(b)] above and the findings made were consistent with, although not identical to, those found in the SEC Order. For example, in relation to the Basketball Team transaction, the DOJ Agreement stated that the Consultant and Mr Chiu had been able to significantly impede the efforts of the accounting firm which had been engaged to review payments to the Consultant in connection with the basketball team. Further, Mr Weidner had given a presentation \u201cof what [he] claimed were the accounting firm\u2019s conclusions, namely, that no illegal payments had occurred \u2026 [which] omitted nearly all context for these purported findings, including the limitations that had been put on the accounting firm\u2019s efforts by [the] Consultant and his associates\u201d. The DOJ Agreement concluded that several of LVS\u2019s contracts with and payments to the Consultant had no discernible legitimate business purpose, and that certain senior employees had been repeatedly warned about the Consultant\u2019s business practices, but nevertheless continued to engage the Consultant for work on behalf of LVS.', '19\\u2003On 31 August 2017, after the Award was issued, the appellants requested that the Tribunal reconsider the Award in light of the FCPA Findings. On 22 November 2017, the Tribunal issued its decision on the appellants\u2019 request and held that it did not have \u201cauthority\u201d under Singapore law, as the law of the seat, to reconsider its findings on liability in the Award. In doing so, the Tribunal went stated that it was \u201ccognisant that in the event a tribunal does not reconsider the award despite issues of fraud, the aggrieved party is not bereft of a remedy \u2026 [and] may still apply to a Singapore court\u201d. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the court might be a better forum where there are allegations of fraud, as suggested by s 24 of the International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (\u201cIAA\u201d).'"}
{"casename":"2021_SGCA_90","fact":"'7\\u2003We begin with a brief account of the facts that led to Manik\u2019s conviction and sentencing in the High Court, which is what led to CCA 26. On 24 September 2016, one Munshi Abdur Rahim (\u201cRahim\u201d) was attacked by three men in the vicinity of a foreign worker dormitory at Tuas South Avenue 1. Rahim was the member of a contraband cigarette syndicate, and his assailants were from a rival syndicate. Rahim died of his injuries.', '8\\u2003On 30 September 2016, Manik was arrested and investigated for causing the death of Rahim. It transpired that Manik was one of the three men who attacked Rahim. He was charged with murder under s 300(c) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (\u201cPenal Code\u201d) and alternatively with murder pursuant to a common intention, under s 300(c) read with s 34 of the Penal Code. We refer to these as the \u201cPrimary Charge\u201d and \u201cCommon Intention Charge\u201d respectively.', '9\\u2003Manik\u2019s trial commenced on 9 January 2020, which was three years, three months and ten days after he had been arrested. The trial spanned 11 days between 9 January and 27 February 2020. The High Court judge (\u201cthe Judge\u201d) who heard the matter reserved judgment.', '10\\u2003On 18 June 2020, the Judge delivered judgment acquitting Manik of murder, and convicting him on a substituted charge under s 326 read with s 34 of the Penal Code for voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons or means pursuant to a common intention: see Public Prosecutor v Miya Manik [2020] SGHC 164 (the \u201cGD\u201d). The Judge concluded as follows:', '(a)\\u2003While there was evidence that Manik had been wielding a chopper during the attack on Rahim, the other available evidence, in particular the camera footage, was insufficient to prove that Manik had landed the fatal blow on Rahim: GD at [60]\u2013[68]. The Judge concluded that the Primary Charge could not be made out in the circumstances.', '(b)\\u2003It was possible that the three assailants, including Manik, shared a common intention to inflict the fatal injury. However, this possibility was insufficient to satisfy the Prosecution\u2019s burden of proof: GD at [107]. Accordingly, the Common Intention Charge was also not made out.', '(c)\\u2003The evidence was sufficient for Manik to be convicted on a substituted charge of voluntarily causing grievous hurt by a dangerous weapon, given that there was evidence of a pre-arranged plan to inflict \u201csomething less than [a] s 300(c) injury\u201d: GD at [110].', '11\\u2003Manik was sentenced on 20 July 2020. The Judge made reference to the sentencing frameworks set out in Ng Soon Kim v Public Prosecutor [2020] 3 SLR 1097 and Public Prosecutor v BDB [2018] 1 SLR 127, and also considered various aggravating and mitigating factors. Relevant for the purposes of the present applications are the Judge\u2019s observations on the issue of delay. Specifically, the Defence had submitted that there had been inordinate delay in prosecuting Manik\u2019s case. He had been arrested and held without bail since 30 September 2016, and his trial only commenced in January 2020. It was contended that this delay had prejudiced Manik, and that a reduction in his sentence was therefore warranted.', '12\\u2003The Judge disagreed. Referring to Ang Peng Tiam v Singapore Medical Council and another matter [2017] 5 SLR 356 at [110], she observed that there is \u201cno general proposition that any or all delays in prosecution would merit a discount in sentencing\u201d. In Manik\u2019s case, there had been \u201cno inordinate delay\u201d, nor had there been \u201cany prejudice or injustice\u201d. She concluded that by backdating Manik\u2019s sentence to the first day of his remand any possible prejudice would be adequately dealt with: GD at [124].', '13\\u2003Having considered the relevant mitigating and aggravating factors, the Judge meted out a sentence of 15 years\u2019 imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane: GD at [130]. She found this to be appropriate having regard to the comparable sentencing precedents: GD at [131]\u2013[133].', '14\\u2003On 22 June 2020, the Prosecution filed CA\/CCA 16\/2020. This was its appeal against the Judge\u2019s decision to acquit Manik of murder under both the Primary Charge and the Common Intention Charge. Following this, on 28 July 2020, Manik filed CCA 26, which appeal was limited to the question of his sentence. Both appeals are pending.', '15\\u2003Almost six months after filing CCA 26, on 14 January 2021, Manik filed CM 6. This led, as we have noted, to the Prosecution filing CM 23 on 29 June 2021.'"}

The traffic accident took place on Thursday, 19 April 2018, at around 7.30pm at the traffic lights controlled cross-junction where Clementi Road intersects Commonwealth Avenue West (\u201cCAW\u201d). The roads were dry and visibility was good.', '2\\u2003A Nissan vehicle (\u201cthe Nissan\u201d) driven by the appellant was travelling along CAW towards Boon Lay Way. A taxi driven by the second respondent (\u201cthe Taxi\u201d) came from the opposite direction of CAW and was waiting to turn right into Clementi Road towards the Ayer Rajah Expressway (\u201cAYE\u201d). The Taxi was the first vehicle in the inner right-turning lane at the junction. The traffic lights were green in favour of the Nissan. The \u201cgreen arrow\u201d traffic light for the Taxi to proceed to turn right had not yet come on but the Taxi had the discretion to proceed across the junction if it was safe to do so.', '3\\u2003There were vehicles behind the Taxi also waiting to turn right. There were also vehicles waiting in the other right-turning lane on the Taxi\u2019s left. Similarly, there were vehicles waiting at the other side of CAW, intending to turn right into Clementi Road in the direction of Upper Bukit Timah Road.', '4\\u2003The first respondent (who was the plaintiff at the trial in the High Court) was one of four passengers inside the Taxi. He was seated in the rear middle seat. His friends occupied the front seat and the other two rear seats. The passenger seated next to the Taxi\u2019s rear left window was a young female.', '5\\u2003When there was a lull in traffic proceeding from CAW in the same direction as the Nissan and the traffic lights were still green for traffic coming from that direction, two motorcycles waiting with the Taxi and the other vehicles in the turning lanes proceeded to cross the junction. The waiting vehicle to the left of the Taxi also started to move forward. This vehicle was referred to at the trial as the \u201cunknown vehicle\u201d. A moment or two later, the Taxi followed although the second respondent\u2019s view of his left was obstructed partially by the unknown vehicle. It was not disputed that the second respondent merely followed the unknown vehicle without ensuring that it was safe for him to do so.', '6\\u2003Just as the unknown vehicle managed to cross the junction, the Nissan charged into the junction and missed colliding into the rear end of the unknown vehicle narrowly. Unfortunately, the Taxi was then in the path of the Nissan which smashed into the Taxi\u2019s left side. The impact was so great that the Nissan\u2019s tyres were lifted off the road for a moment or two. The Taxi was sent spinning across the junction and it crossed the front view of the vehicles stopped at Clementi Road heading in the direction of Upper Bukit Timah Road. The Taxi\u2019s rear left female passenger\u2019s head was seen swinging wildly outside the Taxi\u2019s rear left window, with its glass apparently shattered. Sadly, she died in the accident. The Taxi then started to reverse as if on its own volition and finally ended up along the stretch of Clementi Road that leads to the AYE.', '7\\u2003The sequence of events described above comes from video footages recorded by the in-vehicle video-cameras of the vehicle waiting immediately behind the Taxi at the junction and of the vehicles stopped at Clementi Road, coming from the direction of the AYE and heading in the direction of Upper Bukit Timah Road. The video footage from the vehicle waiting immediately behind the Taxi had sound recording and it captured the loud sound of the impact clearly.', '8\\u2003The first respondent was injured in the accident and he commenced action against the drivers of the Nissan and the Taxi. The trial in the High Court concerned only the issue of liability, in particular, the respective percentages of contributory negligence of the first respondent (the plaintiff at the trial and the rear middle passenger in the Taxi), the second respondent (the first defendant at the trial and the driver of the Taxi) and the appellant (the second defendant at the trial and the driver of the Nissan).

The trial Judge was aware that whether a passenger put on the seat belt or not was irrelevant to the occurrence of the accident. However, he opined that what mattered in a claim in negligence was not just the accident or collision itself but also the damage that flowed from it. He held that the relevant question was whether the first respondent was responsible for the injury suffered by him (GD at [68]). On the evidence, he found that it was not proved that the first respondent did not put on his seat belt. Accordingly, the trial Judge held that the first respondent was not contributorily negligent for his injury. Since the appellant did not appeal against this finding despite having included the first respondent as a party in this appeal, we need not discuss this issue further.', '10\\u2003As between the Taxi and the Nissan, there was no dispute that the Nissan had the right of way at the junction and that the second respondent (the Taxi driver) should bear greater liability for the accident. The second respondent conceded that he proceeded to make the right turn by simply following the unknown vehicle when it moved. On the other hand, the appellant (the Nissan driver) accepted that he was travelling above the road\u2019s speed limit of 70 kmph. He had seen the unknown vehicle moving to cross the junction. However, he did not think that he needed to slow down when he was near the junction as he was confident that his Nissan would not collide with the unknown vehicle. He did not see the Taxi until it was too late.', '11\\u2003The trial Judge considered the video footages, the factual evidence of the parties and the expert evidence led by both defendants. He held that there was want of due care on the part of the Taxi driver and that he failed to keep a proper lookout when making the right turn. Accordingly, the primary responsibility for the collision could not be attributed to the appellant\u2019s speeding (GD at [17]).', '12\\u2003The trial Judge concluded that the Nissan was travelling at between 74 and 87 kmph and that its average speed was 82 kmph (GD at [29]). He noted that even the lower speed in this range was above the road\u2019s speed limit. Further, the appellant failed to exercise due care when approaching the junction although he had the right of way. The junction was a large one and traffic was moderately heavy at around 7.30pm that weekday evening.', '13\\u2003After considering the relative causative potency and the moral blameworthiness of both drivers, the trial Judge eventually apportioned liability at 65% on the second respondent\u2019s part and 35% on the appellant\u2019s part. He also ordered both drivers to pay the first respondent costs fixed at $95,000, excluding disbursements, for the trial on liability.'"}

Both are companies incorporated in the Republic of the Philippines. The appellants own the Solaire Resort & Casino (the \u201cSolaire Casino\u201d), a luxury hotel and casino in the Philippines. Bloomberry operates the Solaire Casino and Sureste manages the hotel and non-gaming aspects of the Solaire Casino. Sureste is wholly owned by Bloomberry Resorts Corporation (\u201cBRC\u201d), a listed company in the Philippines. BRC\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is Mr Enrique K Razon, Jr (\u201cMr Razon\u201d). Prime Metroline Holdings Inc (\u201cPMHI\u201d) is the majority shareholder of BRC and hence the controlling shareholder of the appellants. PMHI is itself wholly owned by Mr Razon.', '5\\u2003The first respondent, Global Gaming Philippines LLC (\u201cGGAM\u201d), a company incorporated in the State of Delaware in the United States of America, is the sole owner of the second respondent, GGAM Netherlands B.V. (\u201cGGAM NL\u201d), which is a company incorporated in the Netherlands. At the material time, Mr William P. Weidner (\u201cMr Weidner\u201d) was the respondents\u2019 Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. GGAM is a wholly owned subsidiary of Global Gaming Asset Management LP, a firm that develops, invests and advises hospitality companies and projects, with an emphasis on the casino sector.', '6\\u2003On 9 September 2011, the appellants and GGAM entered into a Management Services Agreement (the \u201cMSA\u201d). Under the terms of the MSA, GGAM was to provide management and technical services for the development of the Solaire Casino and to supervise its operation for two periods of five years after its construction (\u201cPost-Opening Services\u201d). Under cl 1.3 of the MSA, GGAM possessed the unilateral right to either allow the first five-year term to lapse or to continue the performance of the MSA for a second five-year term. The MSA is governed by Philippine law, pursuant to cl 19.3 of the MSA. The parties do not dispute that the same law also governs the arbitration agreement contained in cl 19.2 of the MSA (the \u201cArbitration Clause\u201d).', '7\\u2003In addition, cl 18.3 of the MSA granted GGAM the option to purchase up to 10% of BRC\u2019s shares for US$15m plus 10% of the equity that the appellants had injected into the Solaire Casino project. Exercising its rights under that clause, on 16 April 2012, GGAM signed an Equity Option Agreement (the \u201cEOA\u201d) with BRC and Prime Metroline Transit Corp (\u201cPMTC\u201d), the latter being the predecessor in interest of PMHI. By the EOA, PMTC granted GGAM the option to purchase 921,184,056 of PMTC\u2019s shares in BRC (the \u201cShares\u201d) at PHP 1.67 per share (the \u201cOption\u201d). The EOA also contained an arbitration clause. Immediately thereafter, the parties took part in a roadshow in relation to the shares of BRC. On 3 May 2012, when this exercise ended, they had achieved a price of PHP 7.50 per share.', '8\\u2003On 20 December 2012, GGAM exercised the Option and purchased the Shares for approximately US$37.43m on the basis of the Option price of PHP 1.67 per share.', '9\\u2003On 8 March 2013, GGAM assigned its rights, titles, benefits, privileges, obligations and interest under the MSA, in respect of the Post-Opening Services, to GGAM NL, pursuant to cl 16.2 of the MSA.', '10\\u2003In mid-March 2013, the Solaire Casino officially opened for business. By July 2013, however, the parties\u2019 relationship had soured. On 12 July 2013, Mr Razon sent an email to the respondents asserting that the appellants had come to the \u201cfirm conclusion\u201d that the MSA had \u201cfailed\u201d and that an \u201camicable parting of ways\u201d would be in \u201ceveryone\u2019s interest\u201d. He enclosed an unsigned letter alleging that the respondents had breached their obligations under the MSA and stating the appellants\u2019 intention to terminate the MSA.', '11\\u2003On 12 September 2013, the appellants issued a formal Notice of Termination (the \u201cNoT\u201d) of the MSA to the respondents, pursuant to cl 15.1(a) of the MSA, on the basis that there had been a material breach of the MSA by the respondents that was either incapable of remedy, or if capable of remedy, had not been remedied within 30 days of notice or such longer period not exceeding 60 days. The NoT stated that it was to be effective that night at midnight.', '12\\u2003On the same day, 12 September 2013, the respondents submitted a Notice of Arbitration to the appellants, requesting arbitration of their claims against the appellants \u201caris[ing] out of or related to the MSA\u201d, pursuant to the Arbitration Clause and Art 3 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules 2010 (the \u201cUNCITRAL Rules\u201d). In their notice, the respondents requested the Tribunal to make an award finding that the appellants had (a) materially breached their obligations under the MSA; and (b) wrongfully terminated the MSA. The respondents further asked the Tribunal to award them \u201can amount of damages to be determined at a final hearing\u201d.', '13\\u2003On 12 October 2013, the appellants served on the respondents their Response to Notice of Arbitration, making a counterclaim for damages for the respondents\u2019 alleged breaches of the MSA. Additionally, the appellants stated at para 7.3 of their response that they would \u201creserve their rights to claim against the 921,184,056 shares in [BRC] that were granted under an option provided under Clause 18.3 of the MSA as part of GGAM\u2019s compensation for services that it was to render to the [appellants] under the MSA\u201d.', '14\\u2003On 11 November 2013, the respondents filed their Defense to the appellants\u2019 Counterclaims. Further pleadings were filed by both parties in the four years that followed, ending with the appellants\u2019 Sur-Rejoinder Memorial on Damages and Other Remedies (the \u201cSur-Rejoinder\u201d) filed on 31 August 2017.', '15\\u2003GGAM\u2019s removal from the Solaire Casino\u2019s operations was the impetus for its decision to completely sever its relationship with the Solaire Casino and therefore, to sell its equity stake in BRC. By 15 January 2014, GGAM had confirmed sale of the Shares to over 50 institutional investors at a price of PHP 8.05 per share, with the settlement of the transaction scheduled for 21 January 2014. GGAM\u2019s proposed sale of the Shares provoked a number of steps by the appellants, PMHI and BRC aimed at preventing any sale from taking place.', '16\\u2003First, on 15 January 2014, BRC requested the Philippine Stock Exchange (the \u201cExchange\u201d) to suspend trading in respect of all BRC shares for one week. On 16 January 2014, the Exchange acceded to this request. In response, on the same day, GGAM submitted a letter to the President of the Exchange requesting that it lift the suspension and allow trading to continue. The Exchange subsequently granted GGAM\u2019s request and trading of the counter generally resumed on 17 January 2014.', '17\\u2003Next, on 17 January 2014, the appellants and PMHI filed an urgent petition with the Regional Trial Court of Makati City (the \u201cRegional Court\u201d) in the Philippines. They sought the issue of writs to preliminarily attach the Shares and injunct GGAM\u2019s sale of the Shares, as well as a temporary restraining order.', '18\\u2003On 20 January 2014, the Regional Court issued an order declaring that the petition was sufficient in form and substance and that the appellants (and PMHI) were entitled to the issuance of an immediately executory 20-day temporary order of protection. This was duly communicated to the Exchange, which stated in a letter to GGAM clarifying its 17 January 2014 decision to lift the trading suspension on the Shares:', 'The Exchange also referred to the Regional Court\u2019s order and stated that it took the position that the \u201cGGAM Shares cannot be disposed of over the Exchange for a 20-day period as directed by the order of the [Regional Court]\u201d.', '19\\u2003On 25 February 2014, the Regional Court issued a Preliminary Injunction Order (the \u201cInjunction Order\u201d) that temporarily enjoined GGAM from selling the Shares; it ordered that a \u201cwrit of preliminary attachment is \u2026 to attach the 921,184,056 shares of [BRC]\u201d and that GGAM was \u201crestrained from disposing of, or facilitating, allowing, implementing and completing the sale or transfer of any of the 921,184,056 shares in [BRC] \u2026 during the pendency of the arbitration proceedings in Singapore\u201d.', '20\\u2003On 27 February 2014, the Regional Court issued Writs of Preliminary Attachment and Preliminary Injunction (collectively, the \u201cWrits\u201d) pursuant to the Injunction Order. The Injunction Order also provided that the Writs were issued \u201cwithout prejudice to subsequent grant, modification, amendment, revision or revocation\u201d by the Tribunal once it had been duly constituted.', '21\\u2003On 11 March 2014, GGAM filed a petition for review on certiorari in the Philippine Court of Appeals (the \u201cPhilippine CA\u201d), seeking to reverse the Injunction Order and cancel the Writs.', '22\\u2003On 28 March 2014, the Tribunal was constituted.', '23\\u2003On 14 April 2014, the respondents filed a Request for Interim Measures of Protection (the \u201cRequest\u201d) before the Tribunal. Therein, the respondents asked, among other things, that the Tribunal restore \u201cthe Parties to the status quo ante as of January 15, 2014, when Bloomberry began to wrongfully interfere with the sale of all of GGAM\u2019s Shares\u201d and to declare that \u201cGGAM has full and legal beneficial ownership of 921,184,045 shares in [BRC] \u2026 free and clear of any claims, liens or encumbrances by the Philippine Petitioners\u201d.', '24\\u2003On 30 May 2014, the Tribunal issued a decision holding that the Injunction Order was a \u201ctemporary order only in effect as long as not confirmed, revoked or modified by the Tribunal\u201d. Because the Tribunal considered the Request to be a request for interim measures under Art 26 of the UNCITRAL Rules, it invited the parties to make substantive arguments and submissions on the Request itself. The appellants contended that the Request ought to be denied.', '25\\u2003On 9 December 2014, and following a full evidentiary hearing, the Tribunal issued a decision on the Request, by way of an Order in Respect of the respondents\u2019 Interim Measures\u2019 Application (the \u201cInterim Order\u201d), expressly revoking the Injunction Order and vacating and lifting the Writs. In the Interim Order, the Tribunal observed that the Injunction Order had been intended to prevent any substantive change in either side\u2019s position prior to the Tribunal\u2019s constitution, and that it only bound the parties in so far as the Tribunal had not ruled on the issue. The Tribunal thus ordered that the Injunction Order be \u201crevoked or superseded by this [Interim] Order\u201d and directed the parties to the Arbitration to \u201caccordingly bring this resolution before the [Philippine CA] \u2026 and to the [Regional Court] \u2026 and to assure its implementation\u201d. While the Tribunal ordered that the respondents were henceforth \u201cfree to deal with the Shares\u201d, which included the \u201cright to sell or dispose of the Shares at their discretion\u201d, it left open the issue of the title to the Shares. The Tribunal emphasised that it made \u201cno declaration as to the ownership of the Shares, and has not pre-judged any aspect of each side\u2019s pleaded case\u201d, deferring \u201cany decision as to the declaration of the legal and\/or beneficial ownership of the Shares to the merits phase of the Arbitration\u201d [emphasis in original] (Interim Order at para 139). In addition, the Tribunal granted the parties to the Arbitration \u201cleave to amend their respective claims and counterclaims as they deem necessary\u201d (Interim Order at para 140).', '26\\u2003Pursuant to the grant of leave, the parties subsequently amended their pleadings: (a) the appellants filed their Statement of Defense and Amended Counterclaims on 2 February 2015; and (b) the respondents filed their Reply to the appellants\u2019 Statement of Defense and Amended Counterclaims on 15 June 2015.', '27\\u2003On 12 August 2015, the Tribunal issued an order bifurcating the Arbitration into a liability phase and a remedies phase.', '28\\u2003 In the meantime, on 15 December 2014, GGAM had filed a manifestation and motion (a document used to notify the courts of an event or factual developments in a case) before the Philippine CA, seeking to annul the Injunction Order. At that point in time, GGAM\u2019s petition for review on certiorari, filed on 11 March 2014, was still pending before the Philippine CA. In the manifestation and motion, GGAM asked the appellate court to \u201ctake note of\u201d the Interim Order issued by the Tribunal and to render judgment confirming the Interim Order as well as to remanding the case to the Regional Court for the \u201cissuance of any further implementing measure or order as may be necessary and appropriate\u201d. On the same day, GGAM also notified the Regional Court of the Interim Order by filing a manifestation before it.', '29\\u2003The appellants, however, sought to resist implementation of the Interim Order. They took the following steps:', '(a)\\u2003On or around 19 December 2014, the appellants filed a counter-manifestation before the Regional Court, arguing (i) that the Interim Order filed by GGAM was not duly authenticated by the Tribunal; (ii) that GGAM had failed to provide verification of the manifestation; and (iii) that GGAM had failed to comply with the Philippines Rules of Court requiring every written motion be set for hearing by the applicant.', '(b)\\u2003On 29 January 2015, the appellants filed a comment and opposition with the Philippine CA, aimed at opposing GGAM\u2019s manifestation and motion filed on 15 December 2014.', '30\\u2003On 29 May 2015, the Philippine CA rendered its decision on GGAM\u2019s 11 March 2014 petition for review on certiorari as well as GGAM\u2019s manifestation and motion by way of a Resolution (the \u201cFirst Resolution\u201d). In the First Resolution, the appellate court held that GGAM\u2019s petition was \u201crendered moot and academic by the \u2026 Tribunal\u2019s [Interim Order]\u201d and further recognised that the Injunction Order was no longer valid:', 'Moreover, the Philippine CA held that in accordance with ss 42 and 47 of the Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of 2004, Philippines Republic Act No. 9285 (the \u201cADR Act\u201d) and Rule 13 of the Special Rules of Court on Alternative Dispute Resolution (RL-3) (the \u201cADR Rules\u201d), there was a need to remand the case to the Regional Court in order \u201cto conduct further proceedings for the recognition and enforcement\u201d of the Tribunal\u2019s Interim Order as that court was the proper venue for recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards. Such remand would be \u201cin accordance with the \u2026 Tribunal\u2019s directive for the parties to bring the resolution before the [Regional Court] \u2026 and to ensure its implementation\u201d.', '31\\u2003On 4 June 2015, the appellants filed a Motion for Clarification with the Philippine CA that sought to clarify the First Resolution. They argued that that court\u2019s statement in the First Resolution could be misinterpreted to mean that the lifting of the Writs was an ipso facto consequence of the Interim Order and\/or that the Philippine CA had already recognised and enforced the Interim Order.', '32\\u2003On 27 November 2015, the Philippine CA issued another Resolution (the \u201cSecond Resolution\u201d) addressing the appellants\u2019 Motion for Clarification and reiterating its decision in the First Resolution. The appellate court denied the appellants\u2019 request that it declare that the Writs had not been ipso facto lifted by virtue of the Interim Order. On 17 May 2016, the same court issued a judgment making final the First Resolution.', '33\\u2003The Tribunal heard the parties\u2019 arguments on liability from 15 to 24 October 2015.', '34\\u2003On 20 September 2016, the Tribunal released the Liability Award. The key issues before the Tribunal were, namely: (a) whether the respondents had perpetrated causal fraud by making fraudulent misrepresentations inducing the appellants to enter into the MSA; and (b) whether the appellants\u2019 termination (or rescission) of the MSA was wrongful. The Tribunal also considered the appellants\u2019 counterclaims against the respondents, by which they sought damages for non-performance and other reliefs relating to the Shares.', '35\\u2003For present purposes, it suffices to note that the Tribunal made the following findings in the Liability Award:', '(a)\\u2003The Tribunal rejected the appellants\u2019 allegations of fraudulent misrepresentation, which included allegations that the respondents\u2019 principals had falsely projected an image equating GGAM with Las Vegas Sands (\u201cLVS\u201d), that through their collective experience at LVS, they had strong relationships with junket operators and data regarding foreign VIP players that they should bring into the Solaire Casino and that \u201cGGAM was hired based on, among other things, its promises that it had operating policies, procedures and systems ready to be implemented\u201d (Liability Award at paras 72, 92 and 148).', '(b)\\u2003The Tribunal also rejected the appellants\u2019 submission that they had been justified in terminating the MSA because of the respondents\u2019 breaches of contract. The grounds on which the appellants justified their termination included a contention that the respondents had failed to bring junkets and VIP players to the Solaire Casino. The Tribunal found that there had been no material breaches by the respondents because, among other things, the standing of the respondents\u2019 principals meant that they did have access to VIPs and junkets, but that a \u201cramp-up\u201d period would have been necessary to bring them to the Solaire Casino and hence the business plan on this aspect understandably lacked detail. The appellants\u2019 termination of the MSA thus constituted a breach of the MSA, entitling the respondents to management fees (Liability Award at paras 131 and 272).', '(c)\\u2003The Tribunal held that there was no basis upon which to rescind the EOA to require the return of the Shares, or to challenge GGAM\u2019s title to the Shares. GGAM could thus exercise its rights in relation to the Shares, including the right to sell them. The Tribunal also rejected the appellants\u2019 submission that GGAM would be unjustly enriched if permitted to sell the Shares (Liability Award at paras 305 and 316).', '36\\u2003The Tribunal reserved its decision on relief, remedies and costs to the remedies phase of the Arbitration (Liability Award at paras 326 and 330). In particular, the Tribunal emphasised that it would reserve to the remedies phase (Liability Award at para 328):', '37\\u2003Following the issue of the Liability Award, the parties engaged in lengthy correspondence regarding the Shares. This is reproduced in detail at [24]\u2013[30] of the Judgment. We summarise only the relevant portions here.', '38\\u2003On 28 September 2016, BRC disclosed to the Exchange the following information in respect of the Liability Award:', '39\\u2003On 10 October 2016, the respondents\u2019 solicitors in the Arbitration wrote to the appellants\u2019 solicitors in the Arbitration, seeking clarification on the status of the Shares, and whether the appellants would object to Deutsche Bank (as the custodian of the Shares that had been held in a restricted, non-trading account since the Regional Court had issued the Writs) releasing the Shares.', '40\\u2003On 11 October 2016, the appellants\u2019 solicitors replied stating that the appellants were not parties to the EOA and that Mr Razon had repeatedly indicated that there \u201cwould be no objection regarding the Shares if [the respondents] were not demanding excessive and unwarranted \u2018compensation\u2019 in addition to the Shares\u201d.', '41\\u2003In February 2017, the appellants renewed the Writs pursuant to the Injunction Order that had been issued in February 2014 by the Regional Court. Deutsche Bank relied on this renewal to claim that the Injunction Order and the Writs remained operative. This prompted the respondents\u2019 solicitors to write to the appellants\u2019 solicitors on 17 March 2017, requesting that the appellants immediately take action to \u201cassure that GGAM can sell\u201d its Shares as Deutsche Bank had \u201cinformed GGAM that, without [the appellants\u2019] permission for it to \u2018unfreeze\u2019 GGAM\u2019s shares, it [would] not release those shares to GGAM\u201d. The respondents also requested the appellants to \u201cassure implementation\u201d of the Interim Order and Liability Award by withdrawing the Injunction Order and to confirm in writing to Deutsche Bank and the Exchange that the appellants had \u201cno objection to GGAM\u2019s sale of its BRC shares\u201d.', '', '42\\u2003On 27 March 2017, the appellants\u2019 solicitors replied stating that \u201cBloomberry\u2019s position has been that if your side were not demanding unreasonable \u2018compensation\u2019 in addition to the Shares, objections to the sale of the Shares could be put aside as part of a compromise to resolve the Parties\u2019 dispute\u201d.', '43\\u2003On 3 April 2017, the share price of BRC shares hit a high of PHP 8.17 per share on an intraday basis, a 19.5-month high. On the same day, the respondents\u2019 solicitors wrote to the appellants\u2019 solicitors reiterating their request that GGAM be allowed to sell the Shares, and stating that their failure to agree \u201cwill constitute further interference with GGAM\u2019s share rights and again impede GGAM\u2019s efforts to mitigate its damages. GGAM will hold [the appellants] responsible for that result\u201d.', '44\\u2003On 10 April 2017, the appellants\u2019 solicitors replied reiterating their position in their letter of 27 March 2017.', '45\\u2003Throughout this entire period, Deutsche Bank, as custodian of the Shares, declined to release the Shares as it had not received written consent from the appellants. On 11 September 2017, Deutsche Bank filed a Motion for Clarification before the Regional Court, seeking a ruling on, among other things, whether the Injunction Order and Writs remained valid.', '46\\u2003On 12 October 2017, the appellants and PMHI filed a Comment before the Regional Court, arguing that the respondents had not filed for recognition and enforcement of either the Interim Order or the Liability Award and that PMHI could not be bound by the Interim Order and the Liability Award as it was not a party to the Arbitration.', '47\\u2003On 16 October 2017, GGAM filed a Comment before the Regional Court, arguing that the Interim Injunction had been revoked and superseded by the Interim Order, which was self-executing.', '48\\u2003On 4 December 2017, the Regional Court issued its decision on Deutsche Bank\u2019s Motion for Clarification, considering that the main issue was \u201cwhether or not the [Interim Order] and the [Liability] Award are self-executing and thus, do not need recognition and enforcement by the Court\u201d. It answered this \u201cin the negative\u201d, considering that the Philippine CA\u2019s First Resolution and Second Resolution already made clear that awards made by the Tribunal required recognition and enforcement by the Regional Court. In holding that the Shares could not be released, the Regional Court affirmed the continuing validity of the Injunction Order and the Writs issued pursuant thereto and stated:', '49\\u2003On 31 August 2017, the appellants filed with the Tribunal, a Request for Reconsideration of the Liability Award (the \u201cRequest for Reconsideration\u201d) on the basis of the two documents that they alleged were discoverable only after the issuance of the Liability Award, namely: (a) a 7 April 2016 Order by the US Securities and Exchange Commission instituting cease-and-desist proceedings against LVS; and (b) a Non-Prosecution Agreement dated 17 January 2017 between the US Department of Justice and LVS (collectively, the \u201cFCPA Findings\u201d).', '50\\u2003In their Request for Reconsideration, the appellants primarily asked the Tribunal to reconsider the Liability Award and to make a finding that the appellants had \u201crightfully ended the [MSA] due to GGAM\u2019s material breach of its obligations thereunder\u201d. The appellants argued, among other things, that: (a) the FCPA Findings when read together with the evidence in the Arbitration proceedings and publicly available information, established that the respondents had, in the course of the arbitral proceedings concealed critical information from, and made misrepresentations, to the Tribunal and the appellants, constituting procedural fraud that deprived the appellants of their rights as a party to the Arbitration; and (b) the FCPA Findings further substantiated the appellants\u2019 justifications for terminating the MSA, including GGAM\u2019s systematic, fundamental and material management of the Solaire Casino.', '51\\u2003On 22 November 2017, the Tribunal issued its decision on the Request for Reconsideration (the \u201cReconsideration Decision\u201d). The Tribunal stated that it did not consider that it had jurisdiction under Singapore law, as the law governing the Arbitration, to reconsider its findings on liability in the Liability Award. This was because s 19B of the International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (\u201cIAA\u201d) provided that an award, even a partial one, is final and binding on the parties, subject only to the provisions in Arts 33 and 34(4) of the UNCITRAL Model Law on Commercial Arbitration (the \u201cModel Law\u201d). None of the exceptions applied in the case. The Tribunal nevertheless expressed the view that the gravity of allegations of fraud meant that such a dispute might make the Singapore courts a better forum such that the \u201caggrieved party is not bereft of a remedy\u201d, observing that \u201csection 24 of the IAA provides the right to make an application to the Singapore High Court to set aside an award on the ground of fraud\u201d (Reconsideration Decision at paras 73 and 74).', '52\\u2003The Tribunal heard the parties\u2019 arguments on remedies from 28 May 2018 to 1 June 2018. Prior to the hearing, the Tribunal allowed the parties to file further submissions to address issues reserved for determination in the remedies phase of the Arbitration. The respondents filed their supplemental submissions on 16 May 2017, and subsequently amended their request for relief contained therein on 24 August 2017 (such amendment having not been objected to by the appellants). The appellants filed their Sur-Rejoinder on 31 August 2017. During the remedies phase of the Arbitration, the respondents argued that the appellants had persistently blocked the sale of the Shares even after the issue of the Liability Award. Having been denied access to the Shares, the respondents asked the Tribunal to award damages for the appellants\u2019 obstruction of the sale of the Shares.', '', '53\\u2003On 27 September 2019, the Tribunal issued the Remedies Award.', '54\\u2003In the Remedies Award, the Tribunal ordered the appellants to pay the respondents the following sums: (a) US$85.2m as damages for lost management fees; (b) US$391,224 as damages for pre-termination fees and expenses; (c) US$14,998,052 as costs; and (d) interest. Further, the Tribunal ordered the appellants to pay the full value of the Shares based on their value as of 9 December 2014 in exchange for GGAM\u2019s transfer of the Shares to the appellants. The dispositive part of the Remedies Award reads as follows (at para 507):', 'The parties and the Tribunal have referred to paras 507(c) to 507(e) of the Remedies Award concerned with the Shares, as the \u201cConstructive Remedy\u201d. We shall use this term as well although in our view it is somewhat misleading.', '55\\u2003It will also be apparent that the Constructive Remedy is a bifurcated one, consisting of two key components:', '(a)\\u2003The first part of the Constructive Remedy requires the appellants to \u201cpay to [GGAM], within thirty days from the date of the [Remedies] Award, PHP 10,169,871,978.24 \u2026 representing the full value of the Shares\u201d in exchange for the Shares, ie, para 507(c)(1) to (2) of the Remedies Award. We shall refer to this as the \u201cPayment Component\u201d of the Constructive Remedy.', '(b)\\u2003The second part of the Constructive Remedy arises should the appellants fail to comply with the Payment Component. In that case, GGAM is entitled to sell the Shares on the market and the appellants are to direct PHMI to undertake steps to facilitate the sale of the Shares, ie, paras 507(c)(3) and 507(d) of the Remedies Award. We shall refer to this as the \u201cDirection Component\u201d of the Constructive Remedy.', '56\\u2003On 9 October 2019, the respondents filed Originating Summons No 1257 of 2019 (\u201cOS 1257\u201d), seeking leave to enforce the Remedies Award. On 10 October 2019, the High Court granted leave for the respondents to do so by an order of court (\u201cORC 6889\u201d).', '57\\u2003On 5 November 2019, the appellants filed Originating Summons No 1385 of 2019 (\u201cOS 1385\u201d), applying for the Remedies Award to be wholly set aside. Then, on 11 December 2019, they filed Summons No 6218 of 2019 in OS 1257 (\u201cSUM 6218\u201d), applying to set aside ORC 6889.'"}

The key terms of the Compromise Agreement were as follows:', '(a)\\u2003Seven of the 26 properties in India would be allocated to the appellant while the remaining properties were allocated to the respondents. Each of the 26 properties was valued in the Compromise Agreement.', '(b)\\u2003The share in the Singapore Property would be sold.

The appellant also failed to pay the sum of $1,050,000 to the respondents as agreed.', '7\\u2003In 2012, the respondents commenced Suit 141 against the appellant to claim the sum of $1,050,000 as well as their 80% share of the sale proceeds of the share in the Singapore Property. The appellant made a counterclaim for, among other things, his share of his parents\u2019 estates due to him under the Compromise Agreement.', '8\\u2003The High Court found that the Compromise Agreement was valid and enforceable (see L Manimuthu and others v L Shanmuganathan [2016] 5 SLR 719 (\u201cL Manimuthu\u201d) at [12] and [23]). Accordingly, the court ordered the appellant to pay the respondents the sum of $1,050,000 plus interest and 80% of the sale proceeds of the share in the Singapore Property (see L Manimuthu at [31(a)] and [31(c)]).', '9\\u2003The court also allowed the appellant\u2019s counterclaim in part and ordered the respondents to transfer the Six Properties to the appellant (see L Manimuthu at [29] and [31(e)]). The seventh property allocated to the appellant under the Compromise Agreement was a property in Coimbatore District, Tamil Nadu, that had been sold by the respondents (\u201cthe Seventh Property\u201d). As such, the respondents were ordered to return all the documents relating to the sale of the Seventh Property and the entire sale proceeds of the Seventh Property to the appellant (see L Manimuthu at [29], [31(d)] and [31(e)]). The High Court\u2019s decision was upheld on appeal.', '10\\u2003Following the decision in L Manimuthu, the respondents transferred the relevant documents pertaining to the sale of the Seventh Property to the appellant. The respondents also offered to pay the appellant the sale proceeds of the Seventh Property (amounting to about $10,000) and to transfer the Six Properties to him. However, the appellant did not appear to show any meaningful interest in proceeding with the transfer. He also failed to pay the judgment sum to the respondents.', '11\\u2003On 23 May 2018, the respondents served a statutory demand on the appellant (\u201cthe First SD\u201d).

The First SD therefore did not comply with r 94(5) and was liable to be set aside under r 98(2) of the BR.', '(b)\\u2003The First SD did not disclose that the respondents had been ordered in Suit 141 to pay the appellant the sale proceeds of the Seventh Property.', '(c)\\u2003The collective value of the Six Properties exceeded the amount of the debt claimed in the First SD.', '13\\u2003An assistant registrar (\u201cAR Wong\u201d) allowed SUM 5330 and set aside the First SD for the following reasons:', '(a)\\u2003The First SD did not comply with rr 94(5) and 94(6) of the BR as the respondents failed to disclose that they held the Six Properties on the appellant\u2019s behalf. This alone was a sufficient basis to set aside the First SD.', '(b)\\u2003There was some evidence that the Six Properties were worth about $2,250,000 as at June 2018. The appellant had thus raised a triable issue that he had a valid counterclaim, set-off or cross demand that exceeded the amount of the debt specified in the First SD (ie, $2,104,440.80). Accordingly, the First SD ought to be set aside pursuant to r 98(2)(a) of the BR.', '(c)\\u2003The First SD did not disclose that the respondents held the sale proceeds of the Seventh Property on the appellant\u2019s behalf.', '14\\u2003The respondents\u2019 appeal against AR Wong\u2019s decision was dismissed by the Judge in HC\/RA 7\/2019 (\u201cRA 7\u201d).

First, he contended that issue estoppel arose by virtue of AR Wong\u2019s decision in SUM 5330 so that the values to be ascribed to the Six Properties in the Second SD were their current values rather than the values reflected in the Compromise Agreement. Second, he submitted that the Second SD did not comply with r 94(5) and ought to be set aside under r 98(2)(c). Specifically, he argued that the Second SD ought to have stated the current values of the Six Properties as well as disclosed the judgment of an Indian court pertaining to his share of his parents\u2019 estates (\u201cthe Indian judgment\u201d). Third, he asserted that he had a valid counterclaim which exceeded the debt specified in the Second SD \u2013 namely, the Six Properties, which the respondents were obliged legally to transfer to him.

The Judge went on to note that it was disputed whether this arrangement constituted a contractual agreement, the parties between whom the arrangement was made and its payment terms. Before us, it is disputed which iVenture Group entity entered into the Reseller Arrangement.

This included the operating processes and procedures of the iVenture Card business, including but not limited to how attraction partners, customers and suppliers were to be approached and managed. 14', 'This also included template supplier and sales agent agreements, 15', 'pricing models, information on the performance of various product offerings 16', 'and marketing and branding guidelines. 17', '(b)\\u2003Information relating to the SORSE System, including the programme management services brief as well as its functions, specifications, user guides and manuals. 18', '12\\u2003The parties\u2019 correspondence culminated in solicitors for Big Bus writing to solicitors for the iVenture Group on 6 December 2017 (the \u201c6 December 2017 Letter\u201d), 19', 'claiming that iVenture Card had repudiated the Licence Agreement and stating that they regarded both the Licence Agreement and the Service Level Agreement as at an end. On 8 December 2017, solicitors for iVenture Card responded by letter (the \u201c8 December 2017 Letter\u201d), 20', 'asserting that Big Bus\u2019s notice of termination amounted to a repudiatory breach of both the Licence Agreement and the Service Level Agreement and giving notice of iVenture Card\u2019s acceptance of Big Bus\u2019s said breach and, in the alternative, serving notices of termination pursuant to both agreements.', '13\\u2003A few months after these events, the appellants launched a replacement TAAP business by collaborating with Luxury Tours and Travel (\u201cReplacement TAAP Business\u201d) to mitigate their loss of profit as a result of Big Bus\u2019s actions. 21', '14\\u2003The various claims made by the parties in the proceedings below are as follows:', '(a)\\u2003iVenture Card claimed damages on the basis that Big Bus had repudiated the Licence Agreement and the Service Level Agreement and also claimed unpaid fees under these two agreements;', '(b)\\u2003iVenture Card claimed that Ducktours, Mr Heng and Mr Low were liable for damages for inducing Big Bus\u2019s breaches of the Licence Agreement, the Service Level Agreement and the Reseller Arrangement;', '(c)\\u2003iVenture Card and iVenture International claimed that the respondents and Mr Low were liable for damages for an unlawful means conspiracy to injure them;', '(d)\\u2003iVenture Card and iVenture International claimed against the respondents and Mr Low for damages and other remedies for breach of confidence in the unauthorised disclosure and misuse of the Alleged Confidential Information;', '(e)\\u2003Big Bus counterclaimed against iVenture Card and iVenture International for damages on the basis that they had first repudiated the Licence Agreement and the Service Level Agreement;', '(f)\\u2003Big Bus also counterclaimed against iVenture Card, and alternatively iVenture Travel, for the payment of two outstanding invoices for October and November 2017 under the Reseller Arrangement; and', '(g)\\u2003iVenture Travel counterclaimed damages against Big Bus on the basis that Big Bus repudiated the Reseller Arrangement.', '15\\u2003It is evident from the above that although iVenture International was the 2nd plaintiff in the action, it is not a party to any of the agreements. iVenture Travel may be a party to the Reseller Arrangement but was not a plaintiff. However, as noted above, it did make a counterclaim against Big Bus after being named by Big Bus as the 3rd defendant to Big Bus\u2019s counterclaim. On the other side, only Big Bus is a party to each of the three agreements and hence the claims against the other defendants were based on causes of action other than breach of contract.'"}

{"casename":"2021_SGCA_99","fact":"'6\\u2003On 25 July 2019, the appellant entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (\u201cMOU\u201d) with Amrose Singapore Pte Ltd (\u201cAmrose\u201d) for the financing of Amrose\u2019s purchase of New Zealand pine logs. Under this MOU, the appellant would procure its financier, the Bank of Baroda, to issue letters of credit to Amrose\u2019s supplier, TPT Forests Limited (\u201cTPT Forests\u201d), for shipments of New Zealand pine logs from New Zealand to India on board the MV Taikoo Brilliance. In return, Amrose would repay the appellant with interest. The MOU included the following terms which were relevant to the present proceedings:', '7\\u2003Pursuant to the MOU, the appellant procured the Bank of Baroda to issue letters of credit to TPT Forests. It was not in dispute that a total cargo of 36,934,231 JAS CBM of New Zealand pine logs (the \u201cCargo\u201d) was loaded on board the Taikoo Brilliance. The carriage of this cargo was made pursuant to four bills of lading (collectively, the \u201cBills of Lading\u201d). It was also not in contention that following the Bank of Baroda\u2019s issuance of letters of credit to TPT Forests, TPT Forests endorsed the Bills of Lading to the order of the Bank of Baroda. The Bank of Baroda in turn endorsed the Bills of Lading to the order of the appellant. The appellant received the Bills of Lading from the Bank of Baroda on or about 12 September 2019. The salient portions of the Bills of Lading were threefold:', '(a)\\u2003First, on the face of each of the Bills of Lading, there was a clear statement that \u201cFreight [was] payable as per CHARTER PARTY dated 03\/07\/2019\u201d (emphasis original);', '(b)\\u2003Second, on the reverse side of the Bills of Lading, the very first clause under the heading \u201cConditions of Carriage\u201d read \u201cAll terms and conditions, liberties and exceptions of the Charter Party, dated as overleaf, including the Law and Arbitration Clause are herewith incorporated\u201d (emphasis added); and', '(c)\\u2003Third, in the upper left-hand corner of the reverse of the Bills of Lading, there was a specific addition as follows:', '8\\u2003On 15 September 2019, the Taikoo Brilliance entered Kandla Port, India, and commenced discharge of the Cargo. It was not disputed that the discharge of the cargo was completed, at the latest, by 23 September 2019. The Taikoo Brilliance departed from Kandla Port that day.', '9\\u2003On 18 August 2020, the appellant commenced HC\/ADM 206\/2020, HC\/ADM 207\/2020, and HC\/ADM 208\/2020 (collectively, the \u201cAdmiralty Actions\u201d) against the respondent. In particular, the appellant alleged that it had not been informed about the discharge of the Cargo from the Taikoo Brilliance despite having been identified as the notify party under the Bills of Lading. The appellant also argued that the respondent, as the carrier and\/or the party in physical possession of the Cargo, had failed to only deliver the Cargo as demanded, upon presentation of the Bills of Lading, and\/or to the order of the appellant. In short, the appellant objected to the Cargo, which was its security for the loans extended to Amrose, having been discharged, allegedly without its knowledge.', '10\\u2003We noted that the appellant had split up its claim under the different bills of lading in order to obtain maximum security for its claim. The individual bills of lading corresponded to the Admiralty Actions as follows:', '(a)\\u2003Bill of lading CHVWTABR190501 in HC\/ADM 206\/2020;', '(b)\\u2003Bill of lading CHVWTABR190503 in HC\/ADM 207\/2020; and', '(c)\\u2003Bills of lading CHVWTABR190502 and CHVWTABR190504 in HC\/ADM 208\/2020.', 'Barring the numbering of the Bills of Lading and the quantities of cargo stated thereon, the facts of each of the Admiralty Actions were entirely similar.', '11\\u2003Following the commencement of the Admiralty Actions on 18 August 2020, the appellant sought and procured an order for the arrest of the Navios Koyo, another vessel owned by the respondent but unconnected with the events set out above. Subsequent to the arrest of the Navios Koyo on 18 September, the following developments occurred:', '(a)\\u2003On 18 September 2020 (Friday), the Protection and Indemnity Insurance Club (the \u201cP&I Club\u201d) for the Taikoo Brilliance, The North of England P&I Association Limited, wrote to the appellant\u2019s solicitors acknowledging that the Navios Koyo had been arrested in relation to the Admiralty Actions and seeking the details and documents supporting those actions.', '(b)\\u2003On 19 September 2020 (Saturday), the appellant\u2019s solicitors replied, enclosing the Writ and Warrant of Arrest. The supporting affidavit was also provided. The appellant\u2019s solicitors sought the provision of security in the sum of approximately US$5,264,000.', '(c)\\u2003On 23 September 2020 (Wednesday) at 6.36pm, solicitors for the time charterer of the Taikoo Brilliance, The China Navigation Co (\u201cChina Navigation\u201d) wrote to the appellant\u2019s solicitors, seeking confirmation on the sum of security sought for the release of the Navios Koyo. This email stated that:', '(d)\\u2003The same day at 7.13pm, the appellant\u2019s solicitors replied as follows:', '(e)\\u2003On 24 September 2020 (Thursday) at 9.08am, China Navigation\u2019s solicitors replied, as follows:', 'Following the provision of the relevant security, a further order was made on 25 September 2020 releasing the vessel. However, the Admiralty Actions were not discontinued.', '12\\u2003On 6 November, the respondent took out summonses to stay the Admiralty Actions in favour of arbitration on the basis that there was an arbitration clause which had been incorporated into the Bills of Lading. In particular, the respondent explained as follows:', '(a)\\u2003Clause 1 of the Conditions of Carriage of the Bills of Lading specifically incorporated all the terms and conditions of a \u201cCharter Party\u201d. The \u201cCharter Party\u201d in question was referred to on the first page of the Bills of Lading, namely the \u201cCHARTER PARTY dated 03\/07\/2019\u201d. This charterparty in turn referred to the voyage charterparty entered into by China Navigation and TPT Shipping Limited (\u201cTPT Shipping\u201d) on 3 July 2019. By way of clarification, the Taikoo Brilliance had been on time charter from the respondent to China Navigation at all material times, and China Navigation, as head charterer, had sub-chartered the vessel to TPT Shipping by way of a voyage charterparty dated 3 July 2019 (the \u201cVoyage Charterparty\u201d). It was this Voyage Charterparty which had been specifically incorporated into the Bills of Lading.', '(b)\\u2003The Voyage Charterparty consisted of a fixture recap, which stated that the \u201cCharter Party\u201d would be \u201cas per the Nord Vancouver-CNCo \/ TPT charter party dated 05 June 2013, with logical amendments as per main terms agreed\u201d.', '(c)\\u2003Clause 31 of the Nord Vancouver-CNCo \/ TPT Charter Party expressly provided that cl 60 of the Rider Clauses would supersede cl 31 as the arbitration clause of the Charter Party. Clause 60 of the Rider Clauses provided as follows:', '(d)\\u2003Clause 61 of the Rider Clauses also expressly provided that the governing law of the charterparty was to be English Law.', '(e)\\u2003On the basis of the foregoing, the respondent argued that the arbitration clause set out at cl 60 of the Rider Clauses to the Nord Vancouver-CNCo \/ TPT charterparty (the \u201carbitration clause\u201d) was incorporated into the Bills of Lading, such that the entirety of the disputes arising out of the Bills of Lading ought to have been referred to arbitration in London. Accordingly, the respondent sought to rely on s 6(1) of the IAA and the principles set out in Tomolugen Holdings Ltd and another v Silica Investors Ltd and other appeals [2016] 1 SLR 373 to argue for a stay.', '13\\u2003The appellant, on its part, argued that (a) there was no \u201cdispute\u201d within the meaning of the arbitration clause to be referred to arbitration in London; and that (b) even if the Court was minded to order a stay, any such stay should be conditional on the respondent waiving any defence of time bar it might seek to rely on in the arbitration. In relation to the condition sought, the appellant pointed to cll 2(a) and 2(b) of the Bills of Lading, which appeared to incorporate the Hague and Hague-Visby Rules, as well as to the fact that article III r 6 of the Hague-Visby Rules provides that:', 'The appellant indicated that it was prepared to accept, for the purposes of these proceedings, that since the Cargo had been delivered by 23 September 2019, its claims made after 23 September 2020 would be time-barred. However, it argued that it had \u201cdone all that was reasonable in the circumstances to protect [its] position in light of the upcoming time bar\u201d, and that the grant of an unconditional stay would cause undue and disproportionate hardship to it.', '14\\u2003The Assistant Registrar (\u201cAR\u201d) heard the application on 9 December 2020 and reserved his decision. On 17 December 2020, the AR issued his decision and granted an unconditional stay. Dissatisfied, the appellant appealed on 21 December 2020. We note for completeness that on 22 December 2020, the appellant commenced arbitration against the respondent in London in relation to the Bills of Lading.', '15\\u2003On appeal before the Judge below (the \u201cJudge\u201d), the appellant abandoned its argument that the instant facts did not disclose a dispute within the meaning of the arbitration clause. Instead, its arguments focussed on the point that the stay granted ought to have been conditional on the respondent waiving any defence of time bar it might have at the arbitration. Broadly, the appellant re-hashed the same arguments it had raised before the AR. As summarised by the Judge at [23] of his Grounds of Decision (\u201cthe GD\u201d), the appellant\u2019s arguments were as follows:', '(a)\\u2003It had done all that was reasonable in the circumstances to protect its position;', '(b)\\u2003The respondent\u2019s conduct after the arrest of the Navios Koyo demonstrated an intention to withhold information from the appellant such that the appellant\u2019s claims became time-barred; and', '(c)\\u2003The grant of an unconditional stay would cause undue and disproportionate hardship to it.', '16\\u2003The respondent, in contrast, aligned its position with the reasoning of the AR and adopted the following arguments:', '(a)\\u2003Despite the appellant having been, on its own evidence, in possession of the Bills of Lading from 12 September 2019, the appellant took no steps whatsoever to ascertain the contractual terms governing the Bills of Lading until near the end of the limitation period. The Bills of Lading were clear on their face, and from the very first clause of the Conditions of Carriage overleaf, that they incorporated an arbitration clause. Yet, the appellant made no attempt to find out anything about this clause from the respondent until September 2020.', '(b)\\u2003While the appellant had indicated at [15] of its supporting affidavit for the arrest of the Navios Koyo on 18 September 2020 that it did not \u201chave a copy of any such charterparty\u201d, nor was it \u201caware of the terms of any such charterparty\u201d, there was no obligation on the respondent to provide such a charterparty, or to second-guess the reasons as to why the appellant might not have the charterparty in question.', '17\\u2003The Judge heard the parties on 15 March 2021 and dismissed the appeals against the AR\u2019s decision. The salient points of the Judge\u2019s reasoning were as follows:', '(a)\\u2003First, the Judge rejected the appellant\u2019s argument that it had done all that it could reasonably be expected to do. The appellant had had ample time to obtain a copy of the charterparty, having received the Bills of Lading on or about 12 September 2019. Yet, it did not even try to obtain a copy of the charterparty until sometime in July\/August 2020, when it allegedly asked Amrose for a copy of the same. More will be said below about this purported attempt to obtain the charterparty from Amrose.', '(b)\\u2003Second, the Judge rejected the appellant\u2019s argument that there was ambiguity as to the relevant arbitration agreement.', '(c)\\u2003Third, the Judge held that there was no evidence of impropriety on the respondent\u2019s part in not having drawn the appellant\u2019s attention to the existence of the arbitration clause.', '(d)\\u2003Finally, the Judge rejected the appellant\u2019s suggestion that its high-value claim meant that permitting a time bar to apply would cause it \u201cundue and disproportionate hardship\u201d.', '18\\u2003In the Appellant\u2019s Case, the appellant made two broad arguments:', '(a)\\u2003First, it argued that the Judge had erred in holding that the appellant\u2019s inaction between September 2019 and July\/August 2020 \u201cwas unreasonable as [the appellant] should have taken steps to ascertain the terms of the Bills of Lading\u201d. The appellant claimed that \u201cthis presumes that there is a duty, or an expectation, on the part of the lawful holder of the Bills of Lading to ascertain the terms of the Bills of lading which are held as security as soon as he comes into possession of the same\u201d. It was further asserted that the imposition of such a duty would create an onerous obligation on trade financing banks.', '(b)\\u2003Second, the appellant argued that the Judge failed to take into account the \u201cundue and disproportionate hardship that would result if [its] claims were time-barred\u201d, claiming that the Judge\u2019s dismissal of this factor as being of little weight went \u201cagainst the weight of judicial authority\u201d given the quantum of its potential loss (ie US$4,419,833.61).', 'Cumulatively, the appellant argued that it could not be faulted for its failure to commence arbitration proceedings in time. Even if it could be faulted, it was contended that the undue and disproportionate hardship that would arise on account of the quantum of its claim was a relevant factor in the exercise of the Court\u2019s discretion. It was noteworthy that the appellant abandoned any suggestion that the respondent\u2019s behaviour had been wrongful or blameworthy in its arguments before us (see [17(c)] above).'"}
