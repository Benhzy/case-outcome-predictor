The husband is a British national. He was a banker during the marriage and remains so at present. The wife is a Taiwanese national. She was a homemaker throughout the marriage and has not sought employment since the divorce. The husband filed his writ for divorce on 7 September 2007. Interim judgment was granted on 7 March 2008, which was made final on 10 January 2011. The parties have two children to the marriage and were granted shared care and control of them. The son is currently 17 years old and is studying at a boarding school in the UK. The daughter is 19 years old and is studying at a university in the UK.', '3\\u2003On 30 November 2010, Kan Ting Chiu J issued the Maintenance Order. Clause 5 of the order essentially provides that:', '(a)\\u2003The husband shall pay the wife a sum of $6,400 per month being her maintenance ($3,500 for her personal expenses, $2,500 for rent, and $400 for maid expenses);', '(b)\\u2003The husband shall pay the wife a sum of $600 per month being maintenance contribution for the children for the period they are with her;', '(c)\\u2003The husband shall pay for the air fare expenses for the two children for two visits to Taiwan per year;', '(d)\\u2003The husband shall pay the wife holiday expenses in respect of the children at $1,000 for both children per visit to Taiwan;', '(e)\\u2003The husband shall pay for all the children\u2019s educational and medical expenses;', '(f)\\u2003All maintenance payment shall commence from 1 March 2011.', '4\\u2003In SUM 609 of 2019 (\u201cSUM 609\u201d), the husband sought to vary cll 5(a) and (b) of the Maintenance Order, such that first, there shall be no maintenance for the wife; and second, that parties shall be solely responsible for the children\u2019s day to day living expenses during their respective periods of care and control. 1', 'The basis for the husband\u2019s application under s 118 of the Women\u2019s Charter was essentially twofold. First, both children have moved to the UK to study and this resulted in a substantial increase in the educational expenses borne by the husband; second, the wife has become very wealthy since the issuance of the Maintenance Order as she now owns two private condominiums. The wife opposed the application on a number of grounds, highlighting inter alia that the husband\u2019s income has also increased substantially and there is simply no issue of him not being able to afford the increased educational expenses. 2', '5\\u2003In SUM 1722 of 2019 (\u201cSUM 1722\u201d), the wife sought two variations to the Maintenance Order. 3', 'First, that the husband pay the wife an increased sum of $10,100 per month being her maintenance with effect from 1 August 2019; second, that the husband pay for her international relocation costs from Singapore to the UK as well as her flight tickets for the relocation, and costs of her application. The material change of circumstances relied upon by the wife was the \u201cneed for [her] to move to the UK and to reside there in order to stay close to and be with the children who are both going to be there\u201d. 4', 'In this regard, it was undisputed that the wife would no longer be able to remain in Singapore past 20 February 2020 because her long-term visit pass, which is tagged to the children\u2019s terms of study in Singapore, would have expired. In addition, in response to the husband\u2019s contentions that she was capable of earning her own upkeep, the wife asserted that she was unable to work due to several medical conditions including depression and anxiety.'"}

In the course of the divorce proceedings, the parties recorded a consent order before the court on 24 March 1994 (\u201cthe Consent Order\u201d). The Consent Order dealt with the Husband\u2019s maintenance obligations and the division of matrimonial assets. We reproduce the Consent Order in its entirety:', '7\\u2003As is evident from sub-orders 4 and 5 of the Consent Order, the parties agreed that the Wife would have exclusive occupation and control of the \u201cMatrimonial Home\u201d during her lifetime. Further, unless she remarries, the Matrimonial Home would not be sold during her lifetime. The Matrimonial Home was purchased in 1986 for $385,000 and was valued at between $5m and $6m as of 31 July 2019.', '8\\u2003Following the divorce, the Husband married his present wife (\u201cthe Present Wife\u201d). They co-own a five-room Housing and Development Board flat (\u201cthe HDB Flat\u201d) which was purchased in 1998. The Husband and the Present Wife have a son who is 25 years old (\u201cthe Son\u201d). The Son matriculated into a local university in 2016.', '9\\u2003According to the Husband, he has been estranged from the Present Wife for the past ten years. He currently lives with his mother-in-law and the Son in the HDB Flat.', '10\\u2003At the time of the divorce in 1994, the Husband was earning a salary of about $2,000 per month. As recently as in 2013, his annual income was $98,933.00. However, the Husband claims that he has been experiencing financial difficulties since 2015. Although he drew a salary of around $7,000 per month in 2015, he claimed to have received only $3,000 per month. Thereafter, he joined a new company. Although the agreed monthly salary was $3,000, he claimed to have received only $2,000 per month. At the time the present application was filed, he had \u201cnot been paid on a regular basis for almost one and a half years\u201d. His current salary is reportedly $2,000 per month.', '11\\u2003The Husband\u2019s financial difficulties resulted in the following consequences:', '(a)\\u2003He was unable to pay the monthly instalments on the HDB Flat for three years, leading to the accumulation of arrears.', '(b)\\u2003He had to use his credit card to pay the household expenses.', '(c)\\u2003He was unable to pay the electricity bills sometime in 2017 and 2018, and the Son had to take over the payment of these bills.', '(d)\\u2003He could not pay the Son\u2019s university tuition fees, and his sister-in-law has been providing financial assistance to the Son.', '12\\u2003We pause here to briefly comment on the Wife\u2019s contention that the Husband has provided insufficient evidence of his alleged financial difficulties. Among other things, she asserts that the Husband has concealed his assets in Malaysia and has \u201cintentionally neglected to pay his HDB mortgage loans, credit card bills and late payment charges\u201d. No concrete evidence was adduced by the Wife in support of these allegations.', '13\\u2003We note that the Judge was satisfied that \u201cthe Husband was clearly facing extreme financial difficulty\u201d (see GD at [41]). We see no reason to disturb the Judge\u2019s finding of fact in this regard, and will proceed to examine this appeal on the premise that the Husband is indeed facing genuine financial difficulties.', '14\\u2003We turn now to set out the debts owed by the Husband.', '15\\u2003On 13 March 2019, the Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Limited (\u201cOCBC\u201d) served a statutory demand on the Husband for outstanding debts of $58,352.85 on various credit card accounts. The Husband did not satisfy the statutory demand.', '16\\u2003On 11 December 2019, the Husband wrote to OCBC, stating that he would settle the full outstanding amount with OCBC after he was able to sell his half-share in the Matrimonial Home.', '17\\u2003On 13 December 2019, OCBC\u2019s solicitors responded as follows:', '18\\u2003On 25 March 2020, after the Judge\u2019s decision, OCBC served a second statutory demand on the Husband, with the debt now amounting to $80,557.68.', '19\\u2003Apart from OCBC, the Husband owes $5,877.07 to Standard Chartered Bank (as of 18 June 2019).

He was informed by the Housing and Development Board of its intention to compulsorily acquire the HDB Flat. On 22 April 2019, the Husband and the Present Wife appealed against the compulsory acquisition. It appears that no decision has been made to date, and the parties concerned are awaiting the outcome of the present appeal before us. In the event that the HDB Flat is compulsorily acquired, the compensation sum would be $585,000.'"}
{"casename":"2020_SGCA_101","fact":"'3\\u2003We first set out the relevant facts that led to this application.', '4\\u2003The applicant, Syed Suhail bin Syed Zin, was convicted and sentenced to the mandatory death penalty for trafficking in not less than 38.84g of diamorphine (commonly known as \u201cheroin\u201d) under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe MDA\u201d). In the applicant\u2019s bedroom, four plastic packets containing brownish granular substances (\u201cthe packets\u201d) and a white metal container which contained a brownish granular substance (\u201cthe bowl\u201d) were found. The contents of the packets and the bowl were analysed and found to contain at least 38.84g of heroin, which quantity formed the subject of the trafficking charge (see Public Prosecutor v Syed Suhail bin Syed Zin [2016] SGHC 8 (\u201cthe GD\u201d) at [4]\u2013[6]).', '5\\u2003In the applicant\u2019s statements, he claimed that he had collected two packets of heroin from his drug supplier. Shortly before his arrest, he sold one packet and poured the second packet into the bowl with the intention of packing it later. He denied knowledge of the four plastic packets and stated that he could not have afforded the heroin found in them. The applicant explained that he sold drugs sometime in May 2011 to pay for his daily expenses and rental, and ordered one to two \u201cbatu\u201d of heroin per week from his drug supplier (see the GD at [11]\u2013[16]).', '6\\u2003The applicant\u2019s case at the trial was starkly different. His case was that all the drugs found in his possession (ie, those in the packets and bowl) were for his personal consumption. He sought to persuade the court that he was a heavy user who consumed roughly 12g to 18g of heroin per day and had the financial capability to sustain his consumption. Regarding his financial means, he asserted that he had obtained a cash advance of about $20,000 from one Ami Aziz, his uncle in Malaysia (the \u201cuncle\u201d), and had earned $8,400 from April to July 2011 (see the GD at [26] and [29]\u2013[30]). The applicant claimed that he did not inform the Central Narcotics Bureau (\u201cCNB\u201d) that the drugs were for his own consumption when giving his statements as: (a) he was in a state of panic and confusion and had experienced drug withdrawal symptoms; (b) he wanted to distance himself from the packets; (c) he was in shock from the sheer amount of heroin that he had been caught with; and (d) he had fabricated parts of the statements to put across the story that he had ordered only two packets of heroin (see the GD at [36]\u2013[38]).', '7\\u2003The trial judge (\u201cthe Judge\u201d) was not persuaded that the applicant had the financial capability to sustain his alleged consumption. The applicant had irregular jobs. His bank account balances and the text messages between him, his family and his girlfriend revealed an individual who was constantly in need of money. There was also no evidence that the applicant had secured the $20,000 advance from his uncle. Further, the applicant had not informed CNB that the drugs in his possession were for personal consumption despite having had multiple opportunities to do so. In the circumstances, the Judge held that the applicant had failed to prove on a balance of probabilities that the heroin in his possession was for personal consumption and, as a consequence, had failed to rebut the presumption under s 17 of the MDA (see the GD at [45]\u2013[52]).', '8\\u2003In so far as sentencing was concerned, the Judge considered the applicability of the alternative sentencing regime under s 33B of the MDA. The Judge held that the applicant was not a mere courier and ss 33B(2)(a) and 33B(3)(a) of the MDA were not satisfied. The Prosecution informed the Judge that it would not be issuing a certificate of substantive assistance under s 33B(2)(b) of the MDA. Finally, the Judge held that s 33B(3)(b) of the MDA did not apply as the applicant \u201cdid not claim that he was suffering from such abnormality of mind as would have substantially impaired his mental responsibility at the time of the offence\u201d. In the circumstances, the Judge imposed the mandatory death penalty on the applicant (see the GD at [53]).', '9\\u2003On 18 October 2018, the applicant\u2019s appeal in CA\/CCA 38\/2015 (\u201cCCA 38\u201d) against his conviction and sentence was dismissed by this court for the following reasons. First, the applicant had never mentioned in his statements that the drugs found in his possession were for his own consumption. Second, the medical evidence could not corroborate the alleged level of consumption. Third, there was no evidence of the $20,000 advance that the applicant had allegedly received from his uncle. Finally, the text messages found in the applicant\u2019s phone revealed a person who was desperately scrambling for small loans to tide him over financially. This court affirmed the Judge\u2019s decision and found that the applicant had failed to raise even a reasonable doubt (let alone prove on the balance of probabilities) that the entire consignment of drugs found in his possession was for his personal consumption.', '10\\u2003On 20 January 2020, acting pursuant to s 313(f) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe CPC\u201d), the President of the Republic of Singapore (\u201cthe President\u201d) ordered the sentence of death imposed on the applicant to be carried into effect on 7 February 2020. On 5 February 2020, the President ordered a respite of the execution pending any further order. On 8 September 2020, the President ordered the sentence of death imposed on the applicant to be carried into effect on 18 September 2020.', '11\\u2003On 17 September 2020, the applicant applied for leave under s 394H of the CPC to make a review application under s 394J of the CPC on two grounds: (a) that the issue of whether he had suffered from an abnormality of mind under s 33B(3)(b) of the MDA had not been sufficiently canvassed at the trial or appeal stages (\u201cthe Abnormality of Mind Ground\u201d); and (b) that his trial counsel did not make the necessary inquiries to adduce evidence in relation to his uncle, in particular, on the alleged $20,000 advance which would have shown that he had the financial means to sustain his alleged level of consumption (\u201cthe Inheritance Ground\u201d). The applicant wished to reopen his case for resentencing under s 33B(3)(b) of the MDA, as well as to reopen his appeal against his conviction. On 19 September 2020, this court granted the applicant leave to make his review application under s 394H(7) of the CPC.', '12\\u2003We heard the review application on 22 September 2020. At the outset of the hearing, the applicant\u2019s counsel, Mr M Ravi (\u201cMr Ravi\u201d) sought to disqualify Mr Francis Ng SC (\u201cMr Ng\u201d) and his team from representing the Public Prosecutor on the basis that the Public Prosecutor had come into contact with privileged or confidential information in the form of a letter from the applicant to his then-counsel, Mr Ramesh Tiwary (\u201cMr Tiwary\u201d) and four letters from the applicant to his uncle (collectively, \u201cthe Letters\u201d) during the course of the proceedings in CCA 38. The discovery by Mr Ng that the Prosecution was in possession of the Letters had been disclosed in a letter from the Prosecution to the court, copying Mr Ravi, dated 18 September 2020. It is unfortunate that Mr Ravi did not give prior notice to the court, or for that matter to the Prosecution, that he intended to bring such an application. Because of this, coupled with the fact that the application was made by way of an oral application, we struggled to understand the precise relief that was being sought, or the basis upon which it was sought. When we sought this clarification, Mr Ravi submitted that the entire corps of officers at the Attorney-General\u2019s Chambers (\u201cAGC\u201d) were conflicted from addressing the court. Without having filed any evidence, Mr Ravi also made some representations as to what the applicant\u2019s previous counsel had informed him in connection with the disclosure by the Prosecution in relation to the Letters. We take this opportunity to reiterate that this is not the appropriate way to raise such issues before the court. There was an emotive quality to the submissions that were being advanced, but a court is bound to deal with such matters only on established legal principles. Despite the absence of any evidentiary material that was put before us by Mr Ravi, we sought and obtained from Mr Ng confirmation that he had not been involved in CCA 38 and did not have sight of the contents of the Letters. In these circumstances, we were satisfied that Mr Ravi had failed to show the court any basis on which he could justify his claim that the entirety of the AGC was disqualified from appearing in this matter, nor any prejudice that may have been occasioned by the disclosure of the Letters in the context of the present application. As we found no basis on which to disqualify Mr Ng and his team from representing the Public Prosecutor in this application, we proceeded to hear the arguments.', '13\\u2003Turning to the substantive grounds, Mr Ravi confirmed at the hearing of the present application that he would not be relying on the Inheritance Ground. Mr Ravi in fact acknowledged in the course of his arguments that he had no real basis to advance this ground. As we pointed out to him, it should not then have been advanced at all. We reiterate this point because the review process is not to be invoked lightly and as officers of the court, counsel are bound not to advance grounds that are without reasonable basis, for if they do, they face the prospect of being sanctioned for abusing the process of the court. As to the Abnormality of Mind Ground, we pointed out to Mr Ravi that to qualify for the alternative sentencing regime under s 33B(3) of the MDA, the applicant\u2019s involvement in the trafficking offence must be restricted to being a courier as defined under s 33B(3)(a) of the MDA, in conjunction with proving that he had been suffering from an abnormality of mind at the relevant time, as these were cumulative requirements. This was a point Mr Ravi did not seem to have appreciated in his written submissions filed in the leave application. In the circumstances, Mr Ravi requested an opportunity to persuade the court that the applicant was a courier within the meaning of s 33B(3)(a) of the MDA, which we granted accordingly. On 25 September 2020, Mr Ravi filed further submissions attempting to address this issue (\u201cFurther Submissions\u201d). We will elaborate on the parties\u2019 further submissions in the course of our decision.', '14\\u2003Before turning to the issues proper, we reiterate the stringent requirements that must be satisfied before the court will exercise its power to review an earlier decision of the appellate court.'"}

In doing so, we largely use the account given by the Applicant at the trial, which was consistent with the contents of his statements to the Central Narcotics Bureau (\u201cCNB\u201d).', '7\\u2003The Applicant is a Malaysian citizen who was working as a security guard in Singapore at the time of the offence. He lived in Johor Bahru and commuted to Singapore for work. Sometime in 2014, he approached his friend, \u201cGuru\u201d, for some suggestions or recommendations as to a part-time job because he needed funds for his daughter\u2019s operation, which was scheduled for January 2015. Guru introduced the Applicant to one \u201cVinod\u201d, who told the Applicant that he could earn some money by delivering drugs to Singapore. Vinod further told the Applicant that the drugs involved were mixed with chocolate and were to be used in discos, and that they were \u201cordinary\u201d and \u201cnot serious\u201d. The Applicant was assured that if he was apprehended, he would receive \u201cjust a fine or a small punishment\u201d. Notwithstanding these assurances, the Applicant initially refused Vinod\u2019s offer because he was \u201cscared\u201d and thought that delivering drugs for Vinod would be a \u201cproblem\u201d.', '8\\u2003As the date of his daughter\u2019s operation approached, the Applicant became \u201cdesperate\u201d because he had not managed to raise enough money. He decided to consult another friend, \u201cJega\u201d. The Applicant informed Jega of what Vinod had told him about the drugs and asked Jega \u201cif it would be a problem\u201d. Jega informed him that such drugs were \u201cnot \u2026 very dangerous\u201d and \u201cshould not be a problem\u201d. According to the Applicant, he had no reason to disbelieve Jega given that Jega frequented discos and had no motive to lie to him. Jega did not know either Vinod or Guru.', '9\\u2003On the basis of the separate assurances he had received from Vinod and Jega, the Applicant decided to accept Vinod\u2019s offer and proceeded to deliver drugs for Vinod on eight or nine occasions (including the delivery which led to his arrest). He was paid RM500 for each delivery. On each occasion, the Applicant would collect the packets of drugs from Vinod\u2019s brother. He would then wrap the packets of drugs with a black rubbish bag as instructed by Vinod. In the course of doing so, he observed that the drugs did indeed look like they had been mixed with chocolate. After wrapping the packets of drugs, the Applicant would place them in a storage compartment in his relative\u2019s motorcycle which he used to travel to Singapore. After entering Singapore, he would hand over the drugs to the relevant individuals in accordance with Vinod\u2019s instructions.', '10\\u2003On 11 December 2014, the Applicant received and handled the Drugs in the manner described above. At about 7.50pm, he was stopped at Woodlands Checkpoint because he had been identified as a person of interest. Although the Applicant initially stated that he had nothing to declare, he later directed the CNB officers to the Drugs in the motorcycle. He was then placed under arrest.', '11\\u2003It is well established that the following elements must be proved by the Prosecution in order to make out the offence of drug importation under s 7 of the MDA (see Adili ([4] supra) at [27]):', '(a)\\u2003the accused person was in possession of the drugs;', '(b)\\u2003the accused person had knowledge of the nature of the drugs; and', '(c)\\u2003the accused person intentionally brought the drugs into Singapore without prior authorisation.', '12\\u2003To satisfy the first and second elements of possession and knowledge respectively, the Prosecution is generally entitled to rely on the presumptions provided for in s 18(1) and s 18(2) of the MDA, which read as follows:', '13\\u2003The legal effect of the s 18 presumptions is that they reverse the burden of proof such that it falls on the accused person to displace what has been presumed against him (see Adili at [99]). Where the presumptions apply and the accused person: (a) elects to remain silent and does not make his defence, or (b) elects to make his defence but calls no evidence or evidence that is not adequate to rebut the presumptions, he can be convicted of the relevant charge on the basis of the presumptions that operate against him: see Obeng Comfort v Public Prosecutor [2017] 1 SLR 633 (\u201cObeng\u201d) at [38].', '14\\u2003In the present case, it was and remains common ground that the Applicant was in possession of the Drugs and knew this, even though he disputes the extent of his knowledge as to their precise nature. As such, there is no need for the Prosecution to invoke the s 18(1) presumption. Further, there is no dispute that the Applicant was not authorised to bring the Drugs into Singapore. The only element in dispute is that of the Applicant\u2019s knowledge of the nature of the Drugs. As we have noted at [1] above, the sole issue at the Applicant\u2019s trial was whether he had rebutted the s 18(2) presumption. In that light, we turn to summarise the decisions of the High Court and this court in Gobi (HC) ([1] supra) and Gobi (CA) ([2] supra) respectively.'"}
{"casename":"2020_SGCA_103","fact":"'2\\u2003Mr Toh began providing private tuition classes in economics in 2007. Soon thereafter, he offered these classes in a room at his parents\u2019 Housing and Development Board flat at Choa Chu Kang (\u201cHDB Flat\u201d). In April 2009, Mr Toh and Mr Keng incorporated the appellant. Mr Keng was a family friend of Mr Toh\u2019s parents, who evidently thought of him as a nephew or foster son.', '3\\u2003The parties dispute the circumstances surrounding the incorporation of the appellant. According to Mr Keng, Mr Toh\u2019s conduct of his tuition classes in the room at the HDB Flat had proved to be unsustainable, with Mr Toh running out of space to meet the growing demand for his tuition services. Mr Keng contended that this led to their decision to enter into their first agreement, which Mr Keng referred to as the \u201cCCK Joint Venture\u201d. Mr Keng claimed that pursuant to the CCK Joint Venture, he invested a sum of between $20,000 and $30,000 to renovate the aforesaid room where Mr Toh conducted his tuition classes. In return for this investment, Mr Keng was to receive half of the monthly tuition revenue after deducting a sum of $2,000, which would be paid to Mr Toh as his fixed monthly salary. However, Mr Keng alleged, Mr Toh never paid him his share of the revenue that was his due under the CCK Joint Venture. Despite the absence of any such payment, Mr Keng agreed to enter into a \u201cfresh joint venture\u201d with Mr Toh, pursuant to which the appellant was incorporated.', '4\\u2003Mr Keng said that he trusted Mr Toh notwithstanding his disappointment over the CCK Joint Venture. Mr Keng further claimed that despite the \u201cfresh joint venture\u201d and the incorporation of the appellant, it was agreed between the parties that Mr Toh would continue to teach and retain the fees from the group of students that he was tutoring at that time until they had graduated from junior college (\u201cJC\u201d). Save in respect of that group of students, Mr Keng\u2019s understanding of the \u201cfresh joint venture\u201d was that the entirety of Mr Toh\u2019s tuition business would be transferred to and carried out through the appellant. In this way, it was envisaged that the tuition services provided by their joint venture could grow and, in time, be provided through more tutors and at more locations.', '5\\u2003Mr Toh\u2019s account was almost entirely different. Mr Toh claimed that between 2007 and 2009, he had established himself as a popular economics tuition teacher for JC students. As a result, the demand for his classes grew. During this time, Mr Toh marketed his tuition services under the name \u201cTuitionGenius\u201d. Mr Toh denied Mr Keng\u2019s account of the CCK Joint Venture in its entirety. Instead, Mr Toh claimed that Mr Keng had approached him and had suggested that they establish the appellant as a joint venture in order to take advantage of the reputation of \u201cTuitionGenius\u201d. Mr Toh was initially hesitant because he lacked the means to invest any capital in a joint venture, had no experience in running one and wanted financial security as he hoped in time to start a family. To allay these concerns, the parties concluded an oral agreement to enter into a joint venture using the appellant as their vehicle, on the following terms: (a) Mr Toh would be free to continue to run his private tuition business and retain the revenue that it generated; and (b) Mr Toh would apply the expertise that he had acquired in building up a successful private tuition business to grow the appellant\u2019s business, and would participate in joint marketing activities with the appellant. We refer to this oral agreement as the \u201cJoint Venture Agreement\u201d.', '6\\u2003One of the key differences between the parties\u2019 respective positions is the extent to which Mr Toh could retain the fruits of the private tuition business which he had already built up on his own. While Mr Keng contended that Mr Toh could only retain the fees from those JC students he was already teaching when they embarked on the Joint Venture Agreement, Mr Toh rejected this contention, claiming that there was no limit on his ability to grow his own private tuition business alongside the appellant\u2019s. The resolution of this central issue will have a significant bearing on the merits of the appellant\u2019s claims against the respondents. Having set out the key factual dispute, we turn to the conduct of the parties\u2019 respective businesses.', '7\\u2003The appellant\u2019s claim in contract arose from a written employment agreement entered into between Mr Toh and the appellant in August 2009 (\u201cthe Employment Agreement\u201d). Under its terms, Mr Toh was to serve as a director of the appellant for a period of five years, and would be paid a salary-cum-director\u2019s fee of $7,000 a month after the appellant had recouped its initial start-up capital. The Employment Agreement included the following clauses which formed the subject matter of the contractual dispute between the parties:', '8\\u2003In September 2009, the appellant registered a business under the name REAL Education Centre (\u201cREC\u201d) which operated from premises at Clementi (the \u201cClementi Centre\u201d). Mr Toh taught economic classes at the Clementi Centre, but continued to conduct classes at other locations as well, including at the HDB Flat. In June 2011, the appellant opened a second branch at Bedok (the \u201cBedok Centre\u201d). Mr Toh also taught some economics classes at the Bedok Centre, but the appellant ceased to operate this branch sometime in or around May 2014 as it was not profitable.', '9\\u2003In September 2012, Thinktank Learning Centre Pte Ltd (\u201cThinkTank\u201d) was incorporated with Mr Toh, Mr Keng and one Mr Xavier Tong (\u201cMr Tong\u201d) as its directors, and Mr Toh and Mr Tong as its shareholders. In November 2012, ThinkTank opened a tuition centre at Choa Chu Kang and Mr Keng attended its opening ceremony. Sometime in or around April 2014, ThinkTank took over the Bedok Centre premises and the Bedok Centre\u2019s students from the appellant. Mr Keng claimed that he was not aware of this and alleged that he would not have allowed ThinkTank to take over the Bedok Centre premises and the Bedok Centre\u2019s students allegedly at no cost, especially when the appellant had incurred expenditure to renovate the premises to make it suitable for its tuition business. Mr Keng claimed that Mr Toh had not disclosed his ownership of ThinkTank. In contrast, Mr Tong testified that ThinkTank had agreed to pay the appellant 20% of its revenue derived from the Bedok Centre premises. This is another key area of dispute that forms part of the appellant\u2019s breach of fiduciary duties claim against Mr Toh, which we will deal with later in the judgment.', '10\\u2003Meanwhile, in November 2010, Mr Toh registered a sole proprietorship, Economics at Tuitiongenius (\u201cETG\u201d). He explained that he did this in order to better organise his private tuition business. In April 2014, Mr Toh incorporated ETGPL to replace ETG and corporatise his private tuition business. We refer to ETG and ETGPL collectively as the \u201cETG Entities\u201d. Mr Toh claimed that he had informed Mr Keng of this move, and had even been encouraged by Mr Keng to develop and grow his own private tuition business and, in that context, establish the ETG Entities. In line with this, the appellant and the ETG Entities conducted joint marketing activities.', '11\\u2003In contrast, Mr Keng denied that he had allowed Mr Toh to set up the ETG Entities. He claimed that in 2013, he began to suspect that Mr Toh was misappropriating money from the appellant. He procured the appellant\u2019s employment of his son, Jun Hao, in 2014, a move which was partly motivated by his wish to gather information about how the appellant\u2019s business was in fact doing. In the meantime, tensions continued to mount between Mr Keng and Mr Toh. On 1 October 2015, Mr Toh resigned as a director of the appellant and transferred his shareholding to Mr Keng, who in turn transferred his entire shareholding to Jun Hao on 25 November 2015. While Mr Keng claimed that Mr Toh left because of Mr Keng\u2019s growing suspicions that he had misappropriated money from the appellant, Mr Toh\u2019s version was that their relationship was deteriorating by late 2014 due to rumours that Mr Keng was having an extramarital affair with Mr Toh\u2019s mother. Further, there was some evidence of mounting tensions between the members of the two families, including an incident that involved Mr Toh\u2019s mother and Mr Keng\u2019s daughter, which resulted in the latter being sentenced to a short period of imprisonment. According to Mr Toh, he resigned to avoid a further escalation of tensions between the two families.'"}

In turn, BTO and the other holding company owned a group of online travel agency companies (\u201cthe Group\u201d). BTO is an online travel agency and has its registered office in Malaysia. The dealings between the parties that ultimately led to the dispute before us commenced when the respondents agreed to divest their interests in the Group to the buyer, ie, BTN.', '7\\u2003On 26 September 2012, the respondents and two other beneficial owners of the Group entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (\u201cthe SPA\u201d) with BTN.', '8\\u2003The SPA provided that:', '(a)\\u2003BTN would acquire 100% ownership and control of the Group on both the shareholder and board level from the respondents and the other beneficial owners.', '(b)\\u2003The consideration for BTN\u2019s acquisition of the Group comprised two elements:', '(c)\\u2003The respondents were to be employed by BTO. The employment of the respondents was to be governed by contracts referred to as Promoter Employment Agreements (\u201cPEAs\u201d), unsigned drafts of which were annexed to the SPA.', '9\\u2003The SPA contained an arbitration clause requiring arbitration under the rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (\u201cSIAC rules\u201d) and an exclusive jurisdiction clause in favour of the Mauritian courts. The jurisdiction clause was expressly stated to be \u201csubject to\u201d the arbitration clause. The SPA was governed by the law of Mauritius.', '10\\u2003In connection with the SPA, BTO entered into separate PEAs with each of the respondents in November 2012, by which BTP and BTQ were employed, respectively, as the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer of BTO for three years. Each PEA was signed by the relevant respondent on the one hand and, on the other, by BTO as the employer and BTN as the confirming party. The PEAs were governed by the law of Malaysia.', '11\\u2003The PEAs contained arbitration clauses that required disputes to be resolved by arbitration under the SIAC rules and exclusive jurisdiction clauses in favour of the Malaysian courts. As in the SPA, the jurisdiction clause in each PEA was expressly stated to be \u201csubject to\u201d the arbitration clause.', '12\\u2003The SPA and PEAs contained materially identical provisions in relation to the termination of the respondents\u2019 employment with BTO. Clause 12.9 of the SPA was entitled \u201cTermination of Employment Without Cause and Impact on Earn Out Consideration Tranche\u201d. It referred to and defined two types of termination: \u201cWith Cause\u201d termination and \u201cWithout Cause\u201d termination. \u201cWith Cause\u201d termination was defined in materially identical terms in cl 12.9.1 of the SPA and cl 15.2.1 of the PEAs, by reference to specified justifications for a With Cause termination. \u201cWithout Cause\u201d termination referred to termination for reasons other than those justifying a \u201cWith Cause\u201d termination. Clause 15.1.2 of the PEAs stipulated the consequences of a \u201cWithout Cause\u201d termination as follows:', '13\\u2003The effect of cl 12.9.2 of the SPA, as referred to in cl 15.1.2 of the PEAs set out above, read with cl 12.10.1(a) of the SPA, was that:', '(a)\\u2003if the dismissals of the respondents were Without Cause, then they would be entitled to a maximum of US$35m in Earn Outs; and', '(b)\\u2003if the dismissals of the respondents were With Cause, then they would not be entitled to any Earn Outs.', '14\\u2003Upon completion of the sale of the Group, the respondents ceased to be directors of BTO. In their place, three senior executives of BTN were appointed as directors, one Mr K being one of the three. Mr K was also the Group Chief Financial Officer and a director of BTN. It is important to remember that at all times Mr K was a director of both BTO and BTN.', '15\\u2003On 8 January 2014, BTO gave notices to the respondents, dismissing them from their posts \u201cpursuant to Clause 15.2.1 of the [PEA] and Clause 12.9.1 of the [SPA]\u201d, citing various grounds of With Cause termination.', '16\\u2003The respondents took the view that they had been wrongfully dismissed and decided to take action against BTO in this regard by invoking the remedies that Malaysian law makes available to disgruntled employees. On 13 February 2014, the respondents made representations to the Director General of Industrial Relations, Malaysia (the \u201cDirector General\u201d), pursuant to the procedure under s 20 of the Industrial Relations Act 1967 (Act 177) (Malaysia) (\u201cIRA\u201d). Under the s 20 IRA procedure, where a workman considers that he has been dismissed without just cause or excuse by his employer, he may make representations to the Director General, who may in turn notify the Malaysian Minister for Industrial Relations. Under s 20(3) of the IRA, the Minister may, if he thinks fit, refer the matter to the Malaysian Industrial Court (\u201cMIC\u201d) to consider and if thought fit make an award.', '17\\u2003The Director General then sent letters dated 7 March 2014 to BTO (at its registered address in Malaysia) and the respondents, requesting them to attend a conciliation meeting. An e-mail was sent on the same day to BTO\u2019s manager, one Mr C, and two other BTO employees, inviting them to the conciliation meeting. According to the appellants, Mr C was then the only employee at BTO\u2019s office in Malaysia. All its other employees were based in, and operated out of, Thailand and India. Correspondence to BTO was sent to its registered address and collected from this address by Mr C. He was responsible for keeping BTO\u2019s senior management apprised of this correspondence as well as keeping them aware of all developments in Malaysia.', '18\\u2003The conciliation meeting was attended by the respondents and representatives of BTO. Representing BTO were Mr C and Mr K. While Mr K was wearing his BTO hat at that meeting, he still occupied his position on the BTN board. No settlement was reached, and the cases were referred to the MIC on 8 August 2014. The respondents and BTO were copied in these referral letters. From October 2014 to January 2015, the MIC fixed and then adjourned the hearings of the cases multiple times due to the non-attendance of BTO. In the process, numerous notices of the proceedings and various related documents were sent to BTO via registered post to its registered office. In the end, the hearings in respect of the respondents\u2019 cases proceeded, in BTO\u2019s absence, in March and May 2015.', '19\\u2003Awards against BTO were issued by the MIC on 6 April 2015 and 29 July 2015 in favour of the respondents (\u201cthe MIC Awards\u201d). The MIC found that their dismissals had been \u201cwithout just cause or excuse\u201d under s 20 of the IRA, and accordingly awarded them compensatory remedies based on their monthly salaries. In the MIC Awards, the reasoning was essentially that the burden of proof was on BTO to justify the respondents\u2019 dismissal. Given that BTO elected not to appear, the evidence of the respondents on the wrongfulness of their dismissals remained unrebutted and their dismissals were held to be unjustified.', '20\\u2003Subsequent to the MIC Awards, repeated letters from the respondents to BTO demanding payment of the compensation awarded were ignored.', '21\\u2003On 19 November 2015, the respondents commenced non-compliance proceedings under the IRA against BTO. Both sets of non-compliance proceedings were fixed for mention on 30 December 2015. Notice of the same was sent to BTO. BTO did not attend either mention. The hearing of the non-compliance applications was fixed on 17 February 2016. Notice of the same was served on BTO on the same date.', '22\\u2003According to BTO, it was only on 16 February 2016, a day before the non-compliance hearing, that Mr C notified the relevant BTO senior personnel of the hearing notices. Up till then, although he had collected the same from the registered office, he had kept all the correspondence away from BTN\u2019s senior management. On 17 February 2016, BTO appeared at the hearing through its counsel. In these proceedings, both before the Judge and this court, BTO has not disputed that all the notices mentioned above were validly served on it at BTO\u2019s registered address.', '23\\u2003By two awards dated 1 March 2016, the MIC ordered BTO to pay the sums ordered under the MIC Awards within 30 days to the respondents. Therein, it was also stated that at the 17 February 2016 hearing, BTO\u2019s counsel had initially requested an adjournment of the hearing. After hearing the respondents\u2019 grounds for objecting to the adjournment, namely, that the time to file judicial review applications against the MIC Awards had long lapsed, BTO\u2019s counsel agreed that there was no point in having the adjournment and conceded that any adjournment would further delay proceedings.', '24\\u2003On 21 April 2016, BTO wrote to the President of the MIC (copying the respondents\u2019 solicitors) to inform the MIC that BTO had complied with the MIC Awards and effected full payment as required. BTO also conveyed its apologies for its absence at the MIC proceedings and explained that \u201cthe fact of the said proceedings have [sic] been inexplicably withheld from [BTO], [which was] an internal\/domestic issue which [BTO was] currently addressing\u201d.', '25\\u2003On 31 May 2016, the respondents\u2019 solicitors wrote to both BTO and BTN demanding payment of the sums due as Earn Out Consideration, in the total amount of US$35m. No payment was made. On 12 July 2016, the respondents commenced arbitration proceedings against both the appellants under the SPA, claiming that they were dismissed Without Cause and were therefore entitled to receive their Earn Outs in the sum of US$35m. A three-member tribunal (\u201cthe Tribunal\u201d) was constituted to conduct the arbitration.', '26\\u2003In the arbitration proceedings, the appellants took the position that the dismissals were With Cause and put forward various bases in support of this. Apart from defending the claim, the appellants also filed a counterclaim against the respondents. The respondents responded that issues dealing with cause of termination were res judicata by virtue of the MIC Awards (\u201cthe Res Judicata Issue\u201d) and that as a matter of construction of the SPA and the PEAs, a determination under the PEAs by the MIC that the dismissals were without cause was binding for the purposes of the SPA (\u201cthe Construction Issue\u201d).', '27\\u2003In a procedural order issued on 13 March 2017, the Tribunal set out the timetable for the arbitration, which included timelines for the filing of pleadings and the production of documents. It also fixed the hearing dates of the arbitration as being from 6 December 2017 to 8 December 2017. In early November 2017, certain events occurred as a result of which the respondents applied for an adjournment of the hearing. On 27 November 2017, the Tribunal informed the parties that it was inclined to adjourn the hearing on evidentiary issues but was willing to proceed with a hearing on legal issues alone if the parties were agreeable. The evidentiary hearing was formally adjourned on 28 November. Thereafter, parties were able to agree on the legal issues, and on 29 November 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 5 setting out the agreed list of legal issues as follows:', '28\\u2003The Tribunal further explained in its Partial Award that the hearing was meant to \u201chear discrete issues on points of law insofar that they could be entirely divorced from factual matters\u201d, and it had become apparent that \u201cthere were potentially determinative points of law capable of resolution in this way, that the parties were aware of those points of law and were fully prepared to argue them\u201d.', '29\\u2003The Tribunal duly conducted the hearing on legal issues on 6 and 7 December 2017. Counsel for all the parties appeared at the hearing. They made submissions in two rounds and in response to Tribunal questions. Further, expert evidence on Mauritian law was presented and each party\u2019s expert was cross-examined by counsel. At the close of the hearing, all counsel agreed that there should be no post-hearing memorials.', '30\\u2003The Tribunal released the Partial Award on 30 April 2018. A brief summary of the Partial Award follows.', '31\\u2003The Tribunal held that the dispute resolution clause stipulating arbitration in the PEAs was mandatory in nature but was conditional on one party actually invoking it. Where the clause was not invoked, a party could have recourse to the Malaysian courts under the exclusive jurisdiction clause of the PEAs, subject to an application by the other party for a stay of proceedings or for an anti-suit injunction. In the present case, neither BTN nor BTO had sought to stay or restrain the proceedings or to commence arbitration. Nor were proceedings for judicial review commenced against the MIC Awards.', '32\\u2003On the Construction Issue, the Tribunal considered the characteristics of the SPA and the PEAs, and concluded that \u201cthe PEAs and the SPA \u2026 [were] closely interconnected parts of the same transaction\u201d. The Tribunal further decided that termination Without Cause under the PEAs meant the same thing as termination Without Cause under the SPA, and vice versa.', '33\\u2003On the Res Judicata Issue, the Tribunal held that both the appellants were prevented from arguing that the respondents were terminated With Cause under the SPA and PEAs by the doctrine of issue estoppel under Singapore law, as the question of whether this had occurred was essentially the same as the issue that the MIC had already determined.', '34\\u2003The effect of the Partial Award was that the appellants would not be able to adduce evidence in the arbitration proceedings to make out their assertion that the respondents were terminated With Cause. The appellants therefore filed OS 683 on 1 June 2018, seeking the following:', '(a)\\u2003a declaration, pursuant to s 10(3)(b) of the IAA, that the Tribunal had jurisdiction to determine whether the respondents were terminated \u201cWithout Cause\u201d for the purposes of the SPA;', '(b)\\u2003in the alternative, a setting aside of the Partial Award with respect to both the appellants pursuant to:', '(c)\\u2003in the further alternative, a setting aside of the Partial Award with respect to BTN only.'"}

Biomax Technologies was the second defendant in the trial below, but was not named as a party to the appeal.', '8\\u2003The dispute between the parties arose out of a convertible loan of S$5m extended by the appellant to the respondent pursuant to a Convertible Loan Agreement (\u201cthe CLA\u201d) dated 6 January 2015. While the appellant was the investor on record, the CLA was negotiated by Mr Han Jianpeng (\u201cMr Han\u201d), the appellant\u2019s husband, and Mr Sim Eng Tong (\u201cMr Sim\u201d), the controlling shareholder of the respondent.', '9\\u2003Under cl 3 of the CLA, the S$5m loan was extended for a period of two years. In return, the respondent would have to pay interest at the rate of 10% per annum. The interest was to be paid in two instalments: the first interest payment of S$500,000 was due on 5 January 2016 and the second interest payment of the same amount was due on 5 January 2017 together with repayment of the principal, making a total of S$5.5m payable on that date. Additionally, the appellant was granted an option to require the respondent to procure a transfer of 15% of the shares in Biomax Holdings to her in lieu of paying the sum of S$5.5m due on 5 January 2017.', '10\\u2003Although the CLA provided that the whole of the loan amount (ie, S$5m) was to be disbursed on the date of the CLA (see cl 2.2), the sum of S$5m was in fact disbursed to the respondent in three tranches on the following dates:', '(a)\\u2003S$2.5m on 6 January 2015;', '(b)\\u2003S$1m on 14 January 2015; and', '(c)\\u2003S$1.5m on 30 March 2015.', '11\\u2003Within two months of entering into the CLA, the appellant and Mr Han became unhappy with the respondent\u2019s financial results. This caused Mr Han to re-negotiate some of the terms of the CLA with Mr Sim sometime in March 2015. This resulted in the appellant and the respondent entering into the \u201cSupplemental Agreement relating to a S$5,000,000 Convertible Loan Agreement Dated 6 January 2015\u201d (\u201cthe SA\u201d) on 16 April 2015. The two recitals to the SA provided that it was \u201csupplemental to\u201d the CLA, and that the appellant had agreed to amend the CLA to the extent set out in the SA at the respondent\u2019s request.', '12\\u2003The SA essentially imposed additional obligations on the respondent by stipulating several amendments to the CLA. First, the proportion of Biomax Holdings shares in respect of which the appellant could exercise a call option on 5 January 2017 increased from 15% to 20%. Second, the SA imposed an additional \u201clump sum facility fee\u201d of S$250,000 to be paid on the same day as the first interest payment (ie, 5 January 2016). These amendments were to take effect on 16 April 2015. Notably, the appellant did not assume any additional obligations to the respondent under the terms of the SA.', '13\\u2003There were a number of other transactions which the appellant was involved in which were of relevance to the appeal. Shortly after entering into the SA on 16 April 2015, the appellant entered into a Share Investment Agreement with Biomax Technologies (\u201cthe SIA\u201d) under which she agreed to extend a loan of not more than S$5m to Biomax Technologies for the purpose of setting up a recycling plant, though the loan facility under the SIA was eventually not disbursed. The appellant also separately extended a number of loans totalling S$6m to Biomax Technologies between June and October 2015 (\u201cthe June to October 2015 loan agreements\u201d). Of these, only S$1m was eventually repaid by Biomax Technologies to the appellant.', '14\\u2003In January 2016, the respondent made payment of S$500,000 but neglected to pay the S$250,000 facility fee which was provided for under the SA. The appellant thus commenced proceedings in Suit No 765 of 2016 (from which the present appeal arose) to obtain payment of the facility fee from the respondent and repayment of the outstanding loans and interest from Biomax Technologies.', '15\\u2003Two further points bear mentioning before we turn to the Judge\u2019s decision. First, there was no appeal against the Judge\u2019s decision in respect of the appellant\u2019s claims against Biomax Technologies. Second, the appellant had commenced a separate suit against the respondent following its failure to repay the sum of S$5.5m due on 5 January 2017.

We refer to these as the \u201cSulphur Contracts\u201d. It is undisputed that the Sulphur Contracts were not written. The key details of the Sulphur Contracts may be found in six invoices dated from 11 May 2012 to 10 June 2013 (\u201cthe Six Invoices\u201d).

Payment for this shipment was to be made within 90 days of the Bill of Lading (\u201cBL\u201d) date (ie, by 19 July 2012).

Affert purchased this shipment from Transfert FZCO (\u201cTransfert\u201d) for US$5,674,313.09. Affert, however, did not make any payment to Transfert. This subsequently led to a dispute between Transfert and Affert, with Transfert commencing Suit No 1072 of 2014 against Affert on 9 October 2014.

Affert\u2019s Ledger Account for the period from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2012 indicated that Solvadis Commodity Chemicals Gmbh (\u201cSolvadis\u201d) had charged Affert US$5,761,740 for this shipment. Presumably, Affert intended to make the difference of US$713,610 as profit by on-selling the sulphur to ICS.', '(d)\\u2003An invoice dated 7 March 2013 for US$6,012,500 issued by Affert to ICS for the delivery of sulphur from Ukraine to Senegal (\u201cthe MV Amanda C Shipment\u201d): RV1 claims the full price of US$6,012,500.

Payment was to be made within 60 days from the BL date (ie, by 5 July 2013). This shipment was purchased by Affert from the Mineral Trade Group based in Dubai.

According to ICS, it informed Affert in 2012 and 2013 that the sub-standard quality of the Solvadis Shipment sulphur had led to the closure of one its plants. Affert had, in a letter to the Inland Revenue Authority dated on 14 June 2016, recorded the sum of US$6,475,350 (the sum due pursuant to the Solvadis Shipment) as a \u201cdoubtful debt\u201d for the 2014 Year of Assessment. RV1\u2019s representative, Mr Damian John Prentice (\u201cMr Prentice\u201d) exhibited in his affidavit certain answers provided by Ms Vandana in Examination of Judgment Debtor proceedings commenced by Solvadis against Affert. There, Ms Vandana stated that Affert had not pursued ICS for the Solvadis Shipment as it did not have the funds to \u201cfight\u201d ICS and that it did not wish to provoke a counter-claim by ICS for damage to ICS\u2019s plant, which purportedly came up to US$22.4 million.', '13\\u2003In the proceedings before the Judge, a key aspect of ICS\u2019s defence against RV1\u2019s claim under the Sulphur Contracts was that Affert had waived the ICS Debt (\u201cthe Waiver Defence\u201d). According to ICS, Affert had agreed in or around October 2014 to waive the ICS Debt as part of an acquisition of Senfer\u2019s stake in ICS (\u201cthe Acquisition\u201d) by Indorama Holdings B.V. (\u201cIndorama\u201d).', '14\\u2003The Acquisition was to proceed in the following manner. First, Indorama would inject the sum of US$50 million to various other entities in the Archean Group and its creditors. In exchange, Indorama would receive 66% of the shareholdings in ICS. As part of the Acquisition, Affert would unconditionally waive and forego all of its past claims against ICS, including the ICS Debt.', '15\\u2003ICS relies on a number of documents to prove the Waiver Defence. We refer to the first category of documents as \u201cthe Acquisition Documents\u201d, which consist of the following:', '(a)\\u2003The Share Transfer Agreement: This was executed in Senegal by Senfer and Indorama. Under this agreement, Indorama paid US$11 million for Senfer\u2019s ICS\u2019s shares.

The DOT mainly concerned the issue of payment for the Transfert Shipment. Recital B of the DOT provided that \u201c[Affert] further confirmed in [the 7 October 2014 letter] to ICS that they have no further claim on ICS for any amounts whatsoever\u201d [emphasis added]. On 25 February 2015, Ms Vandana and Affert\u2019s company secretary, Mr Hanumanth Rao Bhounsle, signed a board resolution authorising Mr Syam to sign the DOT on behalf of Affert.', '18\\u2003It is RV1\u2019s position that Affert had not waived the ICS Debt and that the Waiver is a sham in that it is devoid of consideration and\/or should be set aside as an undervalued transaction. In support of this, Mr Prentice made several allegations, including the claim that ICS had surreptitiously entered into an agreement with Affert\u2019s former directors who acted with the knowledge that they were in breach of their fiduciary duties.', '19\\u2003On 8 February 2017, Affert was placed in creditor\u2019s voluntary winding-up and appointed Foo Kon Tan LLP (\u201cFKT\u201d) as its liquidators. On 7 June 2017, FKT sent ICS a letter demanding payment of the ICS Debt. ICS\u2019s Senegalese lawyers responded on 3 July 2017 stating that \u201c[a]ll amounts then due from ICS to Affert were settled as part of the acquisition of ICS from [the Archean Group] by [Indorama] in 2014\u201d whilst also denying that it owed any sum to Affert. In that same letter, ICS\u2019s Senegalese lawyers attached, amongst other things, the 7 October 2014 Letter and the DOT. That letter, however, was only received by FKT on 24 July 2017.', '20\\u2003On 18 September 2017, Affert was compulsorily wound up by Solvadis in Companies Winding Up No 17 of 2017 (\u201cCWU No 17\u201d). Affert\u2019s current liquidators are AAG Corporate Advisory Pte Ltd (\u201cthe Liquidators\u201d). On 26 September 2017, the Liquidators also sent a letter of demand to ICS to recover the ICS Debt.', '21\\u2003On 18 July 2018, the Liquidators filed a writ of summons with an endorsement of claim, seeking the repayment of the sums due under the Sulphur Contracts. On 17 September 2018, Affert (through its Liquidators) assigned to RV1, pursuant to a document entitled \u201cDeed of Assignment of Receivable\u201d, the ICS Debt with effect from 29 August 2018. On 4 October 2018, RV1 filed an amended writ of summons (\u201cthe Amended Writ\u201d) substituting RV1 in place of the Liquidators as the plaintiff in the present suit.', '22\\u2003On 9 October 2018, RV1 filed an ex parte application in Summons No 4699 of 2018 for leave to serve the Amended Writ on ICS in Senegal. RV1 did not inform the court of the Waiver Defence at this stage. On 10 October 2018, ICS\u2019s Senegalese lawyers sent a letter to RV1 enclosing the following: (a) a letter it had sent to FKT dated 3 July 2017 (in which it stated that the ICS Debt had been settled as part of the acquisition of ICS by Indorama); (b) the 1 October 2014 email; (c) the 7 October 2014 letter; and (d) the DOT (\u201cthe 10 October 2018 Letter\u201d). In the letter, ICS\u2019s Senegalese lawyers also stated that \u201call amounts due from ICS to Affert have been settled as part of the acquisition of ICS from the  Archean Group by [Indorama] in 2014 and therefore, there is nothing due and payable from ICS\u201d [emphasis added].', '23\\u2003On 11 October 2018, leave was granted to RV1 to serve the Amended Writ out of jurisdiction (\u201cthe Leave Order\u201d).

He noted that FKT was privy to the information and there was therefore sufficient ground to set aside the Amended Writ and\/or the service of the Amended Writ. The main reason for setting aside the Amended Writ and\/or the service of the Amended Writ was premised on RV1\u2019s purported failure to comply with its duty of full and frank disclosure in the ex parte application.', '27\\u2003On 24 April 2019, the Liquidators filed an application in Originating Summons No 544 of 2019 (\u201cOS 544\u201d) to set aside the Waiver of the ICS Debt on the basis that it was a transaction at an undervalue under s 329 read with s 98 of the Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20, 2009 Rev Ed) and is therefore void and unenforceable. The summons was served on ICS in Senegal on 7 June 2019. On 11 October 2019, OS 544 was stayed pending the determination of these proceedings. The Liquidators have filed an appeal against the decision to stay OS 544.', '28\\u2003Amidst the Singapore proceedings, ICS commenced proceedings against RV1 in Senegal (\u201cthe Dakar proceedings\u201d).', '29\\u2003On 19 December 2018, ICS applied by summons to the Dakar Commercial Court in Senegal for a \u201cDeclaration to Extinguish Debt\u201d on the basis of the Waiver Defence as evidenced by the 7 October 2014 Letter. Whilst ICS claimed to have satisfied the procedural requirements for service of the summons in the Dakar proceedings, it was not disputed that neither Affert, the Liquidators nor RV1 were notified of the summons and they came to know of the Dakar proceedings only after ICS had obtained a default judgment and served the default judgment on Affert and the Liquidators.', '30\\u2003Two hearings took place in Dakar, Senegal on 31 December 2018 and 16 January 2019 and on 23 January 2019, the Dakar Commercial Court gave default judgment in favour of ICS, holding that Affert\u2019s 7 October 2014 Letter constituted a unilateral act of debt relief, was valid under Senegalese law, and that Affert had waived the ICS Debt.

The SPV had entered into the BPTA with a grid company in 2009 (before the entry of the Buyer). Under the BPTA, the SPV agreed to pay transmission charges to the grid company in exchange for access to its power grid for 25 years. Access to this grid was necessary for the SPV to transmit electricity generated by the Project to consumers and to thereby earn revenue from the Project.', '10\\u2003This BPTA obliged the SPV to begin paying transmission charges to the grid company before the Wet Commissioning Date. To minimise the Buyer\u2019s outlay under the BPTA in the event that the Wet Commissioning Date was delayed, cl 11.4 of the SPA required the Seller (and another party whose identity is not material) to indemnify the SPV \u201cagainst all payment obligations and Losses in relation to or arising under the [BPTA] on or before the Wet Commissioning Date\u201d [emphasis added]. 8', '11\\u2003The Project failed to achieve wet commissioning on the contemplated date of 31 March 2013.

However, the Buyer did not formally exercise its right to take control of the Project until March 2014, when, in accordance with cl 9.10(a) of the SPA (see [8(a)(ii)] above), the Buyer issued a takeover notice, and took over full control of the Project. This included the taking of steps to address the penstock failure as well as to rectify defects in other areas of the Project, such as the transmission line.', '14\\u2003On 31 December 2014, while the Project was still under construction, the Buyer initiated arbitration proceedings against the Seller and its parent company (who is no longer a party to the present proceedings) pursuant to the arbitration agreement in cl 14 of the SPA. 11', '15\\u2003In the arbitration, the Buyer sought a range of reliefs, the main ones being orders: 12', '(a)\\u2003for the Seller to pay the SPV the Cost Overrun amount, or, in the alternative, to indemnify the Buyer for the Cost Overrun amount of about S$70.8m (\u201cthe Cost Overrun claim\u201d); and', '(b)\\u2003for the Seller to indemnify and hold the SPV harmless for any payment obligations and losses incurred by the latter in relation to the BPTA until the achievement of the wet commissioning on 31 October 2015, amounting to S$13.7m (\u201cthe BPTA claim\u201d).', '16\\u2003Apart from denying liability, 13', 'the Seller brought a counterclaim, seeking, among others, an order that the Buyer and the SPV pay about S$5.1m million, representing the portion of the SSL that was allegedly due to the Seller. 14', '17\\u2003For the purposes of the arbitration and the present applications, the parties have proceeded on the basis that the Project was wet commissioned on 31 October 2015, which was when the first discrete part of the Project was wet commissioned.', '18\\u2003The Award was issued on 24 January 2018 but received by the parties on 31 January 2018.

{"casename":"2020_SGCA_109","fact":"'2\\u2003The Husband is a practising lawyer and an equity partner of a law firm which has been referred to in these proceedings as [P] LLP. From 2010 to August 2013, the Wife worked as an administrator at [P] LLP. According to the Wife, the parties fell out around August 2013 as a result of her discovery of the Husband\u2019s adultery. Eventually, in November 2014, the Husband filed a writ for divorce and the Wife filed a counterclaim in December 2014. The interim judgment of divorce was granted on 24 March 2016 (\u201cthe IJ date\u201d).', '3\\u2003The Judge valued the pool of matrimonial assets at $1,908,602.19, comprising $372,372.41 of assets in the Wife\u2019s name, and $1,536,229.78 of assets in the Husband\u2019s name: the Judgment at [57]. The matrimonial assets that were liable to be divided under s 112 of the Women\u2019s Charter were identified as at the IJ date and valued as at the date of the AM hearing (14 January 2019). The Judge made it clear that he included amongst the matrimonial assets the sums of money held in the parties\u2019 various bank accounts as at the IJ date, and not the accounts themselves: the Judgment at [9].', '4\\u2003There was a dispute over how the Husband\u2019s earnings from [P] LLP ought to be reflected in the pool of matrimonial assets. It was not disputed that the Husband\u2019s income from 2010 to 2016 totalled at least $4,549,959: the Judgment at [22]. For convenience, we will refer to this sum as the Husband\u2019s \u201ctotal earnings\u201d, although it accounts only for his earnings over this seven-year period. The Wife\u2019s submission before the Judge was that the Husband\u2019s total earnings ought to be included in the pool in their entirety. On the other hand, the Husband tendered a report prepared by an accounting expert, Mr Wong Joo Wan (\u201cMr Wong\u201d), to account for his expenditure of his total earnings so as to show why this large sum no longer formed part of his assets as at the IJ date. Mr Wong\u2019s analysis assumes a great deal of importance because of the way in which the parties have run their cases on appeal, and we therefore set out below his tabulation of what the Husband\u2019s cash balance ought to have been on 31 December 2016. We note that although 31 December 2016 was not the IJ date, the parties and the Judge were content to rely on Mr Wong\u2019s analysis to determine whether the Husband had any assets which he had failed to disclose, and there is no challenge with regard to the use of this date.', '5\\u2003In Mr Wong\u2019s analysis, the Husband\u2019s total expenditure from 2010 to 2016 was as follows:', '6\\u2003Deducting the Husband\u2019s 2010\u20132016 expenditure from his total earnings of $4,549,959 over this same period, Mr Wong derived a balance sum of $428,678.36. According to Mr Wong, this sum ought to have been the Husband\u2019s cash balance as at 31 December 2016.', '7\\u2003The Judge observed that, according to the Husband, the total balance in all the Husband\u2019s bank accounts as at 31 August 2016 (which was the closest date to the IJ date for which this information was available: see the Judgment at [9] and [17]) amounted to less than $500. The Judge found this suspicious in the light of the Husband\u2019s considerable past earnings, as well as Mr Wong\u2019s own conclusion that the Husband should have had a cash balance of $428,678.36: the Judgment at [26]\u2013[27]. In fact, the Judge went further and expressly rejected certain items of expenditure which Mr Wong had included in his analysis \u2013 namely, the amounts spent on pilgrimage trips, gifts to various relatives, traffic accident repairs, and astrological advice (S\/N 8\u201311 of the table above), totalling $310,000. He also rejected the Husband\u2019s assertion that his yearly living expenses from 2010 to 2016 were between $280,000 and $320,000, adding up to $2,045,000. Mr Wong had taken this amount of living expenses into account in his calculations (see S\/N 6 of the table above) even though, on Mr Wong\u2019s own analysis, he had taken the view that only a total of $1,163,162.68 of living expenses from 2010 to 2016 could be substantiated. (To be clear, when we refer to the term \u201cliving expenses\u201d in the remainder of this judgment, its scope follows that in Mr Wong\u2019s analysis, in contrast with the other items of expenditure incurred by the Husband outside of this category.) Given the discrepancy between the Husband\u2019s disclosed bank balances and his total earnings, the Judge drew an adverse inference against the Husband.', '8\\u2003It is worth noting that the Judge also drew an adverse inference against the Wife, albeit on a significantly smaller scale: the Judgment at [41]. This stemmed from arguments over an amount of slightly over $300,000 which the Husband had placed in one of the Wife\u2019s bank accounts. The Judge found that the Wife could account for her expenditure of the entirety of this sum, except for $10,500 which she claimed had been withdrawn to pay for her legal fees in relation to the divorce. The Judge drew an adverse inference against the Wife for failing to provide documentary evidence of this expenditure. In any event, the Judge observed that legal fees incurred in the matrimonial proceedings could not be deducted from the matrimonial pool (citing UFU (M.W.) v UFV [2017] SGHCF 23 (\u201cUFU\u201d) at [105]). He therefore returned a \u201crough figure\u201d of $10,000 to the matrimonial pool (which was included in the Wife\u2019s total assets of $372,372.41 as stated at [3] above): the Judgment at [32]\u2013[41].', '9\\u2003The Judge applied the ANJ structured approach in dividing the matrimonial assets: the Judgment at [58]\u2013[76]. He found the ratio of direct financial contributions to be 86:14 in favour of the Husband. In the light of the fact that the Husband had made larger indirect financial contributions and the Wife had made more significant indirect non-financial contributions, the Judge found the ratio of indirect contributions to be 50:50. As a result, the overall average ratio of the parties\u2019 contributions to the marriage was 68:32 in favour of the Husband.', '10\\u2003The Judge then adjusted the overall ratio by 8% in favour of the Wife to account for the Husband\u2019s undisclosed assets: the Judgment at [76]. The final ratio was therefore 60:40 in favour of the Husband. This resulted in the Wife being entitled to 40% or $763,440.88 of the pool of matrimonial assets, and the Husband $1,145,161.31.', '11\\u2003The Judge further ordered the Husband to pay the Wife a monthly maintenance of $3,000 for 18 months, to account for the period of time before she was able to resume gainful employment: the Judgment at [83].'"}

The drugs would have been packed in motorcycle helmets by Lao Ban\u2019s associates.', '(b)\\u2003Khor would then cross from Malaysia into Singapore on his motorcycle.

Lao Ban would send him text messages containing phone numbers, code names and the amount of money to collect from each recipient, while also identifying the bundles that were to be handed to each recipient.', '(c)\\u2003Khor would then liaise with each recipient and make arrangements for each delivery. After Khor completed the deliveries, he would return to Malaysia and hand the money that he had collected to Lao Ban.', '9\\u2003On 2 March 2016, at about 12.10am, Khor entered Singapore through Woodlands Checkpoint.

As mentioned at [2] above, he agreed to assist in a follow-up operation against the intended recipients of the drugs. The follow-up operation was conducted in the following manner:', '(a)\\u2003The CNB officers instructed Khor to communicate with Lao Ban and the intended recipients of the drugs in order to make arrangements to meet the intended recipients.', '(b)\\u2003All the phone conversations between Khor and Lao Ban, as well as between Khor and the intended recipients of the drugs were recorded by the CNB officers.', '(c)\\u2003Based on the information obtained by and through Khor, CNB officers were despatched to various parts of Singapore to effect arrests.', '12\\u2003At about 1.55am on 2 March 2016, Khor called Lao Ban to explain his delay and requested instructions on the drug deliveries. Lao Ban accepted Khor\u2019s explanation and told him that he would send him \u201cthe phone number\u201d.', '13\\u2003At 2.02am and 2.04am, Khor received two text messages from Lao Ban. Each text message contained a code name, a phone number and an amount of money. For instance, the message sent at 2.04am read \u201cT-98676050=$3600\u201d. Shortly after, Lao Ban called Khor and gave instructions for the delivery of the drugs to three individuals, whom Lao Ban referred to as \u201c99\u201d, \u201cT\u201d and \u201cKen\u201d. Lao Ban told Khor to deliver \u201c[t]wo big bundles, yellow one\u201d to 99 and \u201cone yellow bundle\u201d to T, while the rest of the bundles would be \u201c[a]ll for Ah Ken\u201d. Lao Ban also told Khor to collect $3,600 from T. As we have already noted, all the bundles had yellow stickers on them, though none of the bundles were in fact yellow.', '14\\u2003The call records show that Han received a phone call from Lao Ban at 2.43am, and again at 2.45am. In between, at 2.44am, Khor received a phone call from Lao Ban, who told Khor that he would ask T to call Khor. At 2.45am, Han received a text message from Lao Ban stating \u201cT-86531409=$3600\u201d. At 2.47am, Han called Khor and introduced himself as T.', '15\\u2003During this period, Khor also engaged in several recorded conversations with 99 and Ken. Using the information obtained in these conversations, CNB officers arrested 99 and Ken at 3.20am and 3.30am respectively.', '16\\u2003Subsequently, over four phone calls that took place between 4.02am and 4.40am, Han and Khor made arrangements to meet at Block 5, Lorong 7, Toa Payoh (\u201cBlock 5\u201d). While Han was making those arrangements, CNB officers were despatched to the arranged location to effect his arrest. A CNB officer assumed the place of Khor and travelled to Block 5 in a taxi. Upon reaching Block 5, that officer remained in the taxi and did not alight or attempt to approach Han because the CNB officers had learnt that Han knew what Khor looked like. Instead, after the officer confirmed Han\u2019s identity from within the taxi, CNB officers trailing the taxi in another vehicle alighted to effect the arrest. As the CNB officers approached Han, he started walking away quickly and was eventually arrested at Block 4, Lorong 7, Toa Payoh. He was searched, and $3,600 in cash was found in the front left pocket of his shorts. The cash was bundled with a rubber band and was kept separate from his wallet, which contained some other cash. The CNB officers brought Han to his apartment and searched it. Various other amounts of drugs were recovered there, including a bundle, which was subsequently analysed and found to contain not less than 6.77g of diamorphine, and a small packet, which was likewise analysed and found to contain not less than 0.19g of diamorphine. There are, however, no pending charges in relation to the drugs found in Han\u2019s apartment.', '17\\u2003The circumstances of Han\u2019s arrest were unusual in that there was no possibility of Han consummating the offence of possessing controlled drugs for the purpose of trafficking because, at the material time, the drugs were already in the CNB\u2019s custody and there was never any intention to deliver the drugs to Han; and also because, according to Han, he had ordered from Lao Ban a different selection of drugs which were not in the consignment that Khor had transported into Singapore. The significance of these circumstances will be explored in greater detail below.', '18\\u2003In the course of the investigations, the CNB officers recorded six statements from Han, namely:', '(a)\\u2003two contemporaneous statements recorded pursuant to s 22 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (\u201cCPC\u201d) at 5.15am and 10.55am on 2 March 2016, the day of his arrest;', '(b)\\u2003a cautioned statement recorded pursuant to s 23 of the CPC at 10.45pm on 2 March 2016;', '(c)\\u2003two long statements recorded pursuant to s 22 of the CPC on 8 and 9 March 2016; and', '(d)\\u2003one long statement recorded pursuant to s 22 of the CPC on 31 August 2016.', '19\\u2003We will only briefly summarise the contents of these statements and leave detailed discussion, where needed, to the relevant sections below. In his first contemporaneous statement, Han claimed that the sum of $3,600 that was found on him at the time of his arrest was \u201cmeant for gambling\u201d. In his cautioned statement, in response to a charge that he had engaged in a conspiracy with Khor and other unknown persons to import diamorphine into Singapore, Han stated that he did not know Khor and \u201cdid not tell him to bring this over to Singapore\u201d. In his long statement recorded on 8 March 2016, Han stated that he had ordered 100g of ketamine and 25g of \u201cIce\u201d (a street name for methamphetamine), and not diamorphine, from Lao Ban. He reiterated this defence in his long statements recorded on 9 March and 31 August 2016.', '20\\u2003Han faced the following charge at the trial:', '21\\u2003As we noted earlier (see [9(e)] above), the diamorphine listed in the charge corresponded with the drugs found in D1B, which was the bundle that contained the smallest amount of diamorphine among the three bundles of diamorphine.', '22\\u2003At the trial, the crux of Han\u2019s defence was that he had ordered only ketamine and Ice, and not diamorphine, from Lao Ban. At certain points during the trial, Han also suggested that he had not made any prior arrangements to meet Khor, and had intended to use the sum of money found on him at the time of his arrest primarily to gamble; however, he also said that if someone had arrived with the drugs that he had ordered, he would have used the money intended for gambling to pay for the drugs. Han admitted at the trial that he sold Ice, erimin and ketamine to fund his daily expenses.'"}

{"casename":"2020_SGCA_115","fact":"'2\\u2003The facts may be briefly stated. On 22 July 2015, Hadi entered Johor Bahru in the morning and picked up two bundles wrapped in black tape from a woman known to him only as \u201cKakak\u201d. It is undisputed that Salleh was the one who instructed Hadi on the collection of the bundles, and who also coordinated the transaction with \u201cKakak\u201d. Hadi had also performed a number of similar deliveries on Salleh\u2019s instructions prior to this occasion. Upon collecting the bundles from \u201cKakak\u201d, Hadi hid the two bundles within a hidden compartment under the seat of his motorcycle and returned to Singapore at about 12.41pm.', '3\\u2003Later that night, Hadi and Salleh were arrested in raids conducted by the Central Narcotics Bureau (\u201cCNB\u201d). At about 7.10pm, CNB officers arrested Hadi at his unit at Block 53 Marine Terrace. Under questioning, Hadi informed the CNB officers that he had two bundles collected from Johor Bahru in his motorcycle. The CNB officers seized the two bundles, as well as three mobile phones that were in Hadi\u2019s possession.', '4\\u2003At about 9.08pm, Salleh was arrested by CNB officers at a coffee shop at 85 Kallang Avenue, and a total of four mobile phones and one tablet were seized from Salleh\u2019s person and at his flat.', '5\\u2003The two bundles recovered from Hadi were analysed by the Health Sciences Authority (\u201cHSA\u201d). The first bundle, A1, contained three packets of crystalline substance. The second bundle, A2, contained two packets of crystalline substance. Upon analysis by the HSA, each packet of crystalline substance was found to weigh roughly 100g. Accordingly, A1 weighed roughly 300g in total, while A2 weighed roughly 200g in total.

The appellant was the only person in possession of the remote control at the material time. There were also seven mobile phones, two tablet computers and two thumb-drives in the rented room.', '10\\u2003The arrest took place at around 4.45pm on 23 June 2016. The CNB officers forced their way into the appellant\u2019s rented room and found the appellant lying on his bed using his mobile phone. One of the officers asked whether the appellant had anything to surrender and he responded by saying \u201cthree\u201d and using his head to gesture towards the wardrobe.', '11\\u2003A search was conducted in the wardrobe and the drugs in question were found in the second drawer there. 2', 'The rest of the room was also searched and the other drug exhibits were found at the appellant\u2019s bedside table (B) and underneath his bed (C).

The process took approximately 32 minutes, ending at around 6.27pm.', '13\\u2003The contemporaneous statement consisted of a series of 29 questions and answers. In the contemporaneous statement, the appellant admitted that the drugs in question belonged to him, identified them as heroin and stated that they were intended for consumption and for sale. 3', '14\\u2003At the trial, the appellant took issue with the contemporaneous statement in two main respects. First, he alleged that before the commencement of the contemporaneous statement, the recording officer offered an inducement to him by telling him to \u201cmake it fast then you go and rest\u201d. 4', 'Second, the appellant asserted that he was in a vulnerable mental state during the recording of the contemporaneous statement due to the confluence of three factors: 5', '(a)\\u2003He had consumed diamorphine that morning and had begun to experience withdrawal symptoms;', '(b)\\u2003He was high on methamphetamine having consumed it shortly before the CNB officers entered his room; and', '(c)\\u2003He had not slept for three days due to the effects of methamphetamine.', 'Accordingly, the appellant argued that the contemporaneous statement should be excluded as it was involuntary within the meaning of s 258(3) of the CPC or on the basis of the common law discretion to exclude evidence under the Kadar principles. As a result of the appellant\u2019s challenge to the admission of the contemporaneous statement, an ancillary hearing was convened in accordance with s 279 of the CPC.', '15\\u2003We set out below an overview of the key events concerning the appellant\u2019s arrest and the recording of the contemporaneous statement:', '(a)\\u2003On 23 June 2016:', '(b)\\u2003On 24 June 2016:', '(c)\\u2003On 25 June 2016 at around 4.10pm, the appellant was admitted into the Complex Medical Centre (\u201cCMC\u201d) for drug withdrawal assessment.

The thrust of the appellant\u2019s case was that his mental state at the time of the contemporaneous statement was impaired.

The appellant stated that he would have to consider whether to continue to engage the respondent to act for him. 7', 'The respondent sent a follow-up electronic mail (\u201cemail\u201d) on 9 January 2018, and again on 17 January 2018, 8', 'seeking the appellant\u2019s confirmation as to whether he intended to continue engaging the respondent. On 19 January 2018, the appellant confirmed that he wished to continue doing so but the respondent inquired about payment of the 26 October 2017 invoice. 9', 'On 22 January 2018, the respondent was informed by Optimus Chambers LLC (\u201cOptimus Chambers\u201d) that it had been instructed to take over the continuing trial of the Consolidated Suits. 10', '5\\u2003On 27 March 2018, the respondent wrote to Optimus Chambers, enclosing the 26 October 2017 invoice and another invoice, ie, Invoice No 152152 dated 13 March 2018 (\u201cthe 13 March 2018 invoice\u201d) for work done in the Consolidated Suits between 1 August 2017 to 22 January 2018. 11', 'The respondent informed Optimus Chambers that it would be setting off the sum of $176,008.04 held on account for the appellant against the unpaid invoices. 12', 'According to the respondent, Optimus Chambers suggested that the respondent speak to the appellant personally, and the respondent did so on 23 April 2018, informing the appellant that if he disputed any of the unpaid invoices, he was entitled to apply to the court to tax those invoices. On the other hand, the appellant suggested that the respondent communicate with Optimus Chambers. 13', 'On 7 September 2018, the respondent again wrote to Optimus Chambers to state that the sum of $176,008.04 had been set off against the \u201ctotal amount owing to [the respondent]\u201d. The respondent reiterated that the appellant was entitled to proceed to taxation if he disputed any part of its professional charges. At that time, no distinction was drawn between the two invoices for the purpose of set-off. 14', '6\\u2003The respondent then issued three statutory demands in relation to the 26 October 2017 invoice.

We note that for the 26 October 2017 invoice, the appellant did not require leave for an order for taxation so long as he satisfied the requirement of special circumstances under s 122 of the LPA. In the supporting affidavit filed for OS 67\/19, the appellant stated that he had informed the respondent that there was no reason for it to have issued a statutory demand since the invoices were disputed and he was willing to have them taxed. 17', 'No further steps were taken in respect of the statutory demand dated 29 November 2018.', '8\\u2003Aedit Abdullah J, who heard OS 67\/19, granted the order for taxation of the 13 March 2018 invoice but dismissed the application in relation to the 26 October 2017 invoice.

Cairnhill Law LLC (\u201cCairnhill Law\u201d), his current solicitors, were appointed in relation to the taxation proceedings on 20 August 2019 (see GD at [7]). The bill of costs for the 13 March 2018 invoice has since been taxed by an AR. According to the respondent, aside from Section 2 costs, 12.38% of the bill of costs relating to the 13 March 2018 invoice was taxed off. 18', 'The appellant\u2019s application for review of the taxation was dismissed by Abdullah J on 19 October 2020. 19', '9\\u2003Subsequently, a fresh statutory demand dated 10 May 2019 was issued by the respondent on the basis of the 26 October 2017 invoice.

LVM Law Chambers LLC went on record as the appellant\u2019s solicitors in the appeal on 6 June 2019.

The net sum includes interest under para 5 of the Legal Profession (Solicitors\u2019 Remuneration) Order (Cap 161, O 1, 2010 Rev Ed). The other invoice, ie, the 13 March 2018 invoice, was being taxed at that time. The respondent had asked Cairnhill Law on 18 September 2019 if it had instructions to accept personal service of process on behalf of the appellant, but apparently received no reply. 21', 'The respondent then attempted to serve the SD on the appellant in the following ways:', '(a)\\u2003On 30 September 2019 and 1 October 2019, the respondent\u2019s clerk attempted personal service at the Bayshore Road property, but on each occasion the door was locked. At the time these attempts were made, the respondent was aware that the appellant no longer owned the Bayshore Road property, which was instead owned by a third party. In contrast, the appellant had been the owner of the Bayshore Road property in March 2019, although a title search then had shown that the third party had already lodged a caveat as a purchaser. An Enhanced Individual Search on the appellant conducted on 29 October 2019 did not reveal any details of the appellant\u2019s residential address. 22', 'The appellant accepts that two unsuccessful attempts had been made at personal service. 23', '(b)\\u2003Subsequently, on 4 October 2019, the respondent placed an advertisement (\u201cthe Advertisement\u201d) in the Straits Times of a notice of the SD. The notice referred specifically to r 96(4)(d) of the Bankruptcy Rules (Cap 20, R1, 2006 Rev Ed) (\u201cBR\u201d), the 26 October 2017 invoice, and the sum of $106,133.52. 24', '(c)\\u2003A copy of the notice advertised was also sent to Cairnhill Law by email on 4 October 2019 at 12.03pm (\u201cthe 4 October 2019 email\u201d). 25', 'On 22 October 2019, Mr Ashok Kumar (\u201cMr Kumar\u201d) from Cairnhill Law replied to the email. He referred to the notice of statutory demand and requested documents such as a breakdown of the time spent by the respondent\u2019s solicitors \u201cwhich was the subject of all the invoices\u201d issued by the respondent to the appellant. The respondent declined to provide a breakdown and sent Mr Kumar a copy of the SD on the same day. Subsequently, on 23 October 2019, Mr Kumar stated that Cairnhill Law did not, at that time, have instructions to accept service of the SD and that his email of 22 October 2019 should not be construed otherwise. On that same day, he reiterated that Cairnhill Law did not appear on the record for the appellant in any proceeding relating to the SD. 26', '11\\u2003A bankruptcy application (HC\/B 2786\/2019 (\u201cB 2786\u201d)) was filed by the respondent on 29 October 2019 on the basis of the SD. Copies of the cause papers were sent to Cairnhill Law. 27', 'The appellant filed OSB 129 on 31 October 2019 to set aside the SD. Before the AR, the respondent argued that the Advertisement was the only way to bring the SD to the appellant\u2019s attention, aside from \u201cthe most obvious manner of service on the [appellant\u2019s] solicitors\u201d. The respondent also emphasised that a copy of the Advertisement had been immediately sent to Cairnhill Law on the same day and noted that the Advertisement was again referred to in the email to Cairnhill Law sent on 22 October 2019, which also attached a copy of the entire SD. 28', 'The AR held that there was good service of the SD and that the Application was unmeritorious, and dismissed it accordingly. 29'"}
{"casename":"2020_SGCA_119","fact":"'7\\u2003The present appeals arise from the consolidated trial below of HC\/S 1328\/2014 and HC\/S 1329\/2014 (\u201cthe Suits\u201d). The plaintiff in the Suits is Seraya Energy Pte Ltd (\u201cSeraya\u201d). It is a retailer of electricity and a wholly owned subsidiary of YTL PowerSeraya Pte Ltd (\u201cYTL\u201d), an electricity generator. Together, Seraya and YTL form what is known as a \u201cgentailer\u201d, which refers to the vertical integration of a generation company and its corresponding retailer chiefly for the purpose of mitigating the group\u2019s exposure to price fluctuations. YTL is the third party to the counterclaims in the Suits.', '8\\u2003The defendants in the Suits are Denka Advantech Pte Ltd (\u201cDAPL\u201d) and Denka Singapore Pte Ltd (\u201cDSPL\u201d). DAPL and DSPL are customers of Seraya. As many of the claims and arguments are common to both entities, we refer to the two defendants simply as \u201cDenka\u201d where it is not important to differentiate between them.', '9\\u2003Seraya commenced the Suits against DAPL and DSPL, claiming Denka\u2019s repudiatory breach of three electricity retail agreements (\u201cERAs\u201d). Seraya claimed damages under the liquidated damages (\u201cLD\u201d) clause contained in each ERA, or common law damages in the alternative.', '10\\u2003To understand the issues in contention, it is necessary to set out briefly the structure of the electricity market and the context in which the parties entered into the ERAs. As most of these facts are comprehensively set out in the decision of the High Court judge (\u201cthe Judge\u201d) below, we detail only the facts that are essential to the appeals.', '11\\u2003All electricity in Singapore is bought and sold through the National Electricity Market of Singapore (\u201cNEMS\u201d). NEMS is regulated by the Energy Market Authority, which facilitates market transactions through the Energy Market Company Pte Ltd (\u201cEMC\u201d). The electricity market is divided into two sections: the wholesale market in which generation companies operate, and the retail market in which retailers operate.', '12\\u2003In the wholesale market, electricity generators such as YTL are required to sell electricity to NEMS. Every half hour, generation companies submit bids to NEMS for the quantity and price of electricity they are able and willing to supply. Based on supply and demand, NEMS\u2019s computer model generates a fixed price known as the Uniform Singapore Energy Price (\u201cUSEP\u201d). The USEP represents the weighted average of all the nodal prices of nodes from which electricity is deemed to be withdrawn in that half hour. All bids that do not exceed the USEP are accepted, and generators whose bids are accepted will be called upon to supply electricity and are paid at the USEP.', '13\\u2003In turn, NEMS sells electricity to energy retailers such as Seraya. The price of electricity sold to retailers is known as the Pool Price, which is derived, in the main, by adding an Hourly Energy Uplift Charge (\u201cHEUC\u201d) to the USEP.', '14\\u2003In turn, energy retailers may only sell electricity to contestable consumers such as Denka. Contestable consumers are consumers with a high average electricity consumption of at least 2,000 kWh per month and are typically commercial or industrial entities.', '15\\u2003If a contestable consumer does not wish to purchase electricity from a specific retailer, it may also purchase from the wholesale market, either from the Market Support Services Licensee (\u201cMSSL\u201d), ie, SP Services Ltd, at the Pool Price, or as a direct market customer registered with the EMC. Purchasing from one retailer, however, allows the parties to fix the price of electricity or peg the price to a different index, instead of being subject to fluctuations in the USEP and the Pool Price.', '16\\u2003As between YTL, NEMS, Seraya and Denka, the pricing relationship between them is illustrated as follows:', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '17\\u2003We pause to note Seraya\u2019s submission that in a gentailer, it is common for parties to enter into a contract for differences to enable the group as a whole to mitigate its exposure to the fluctuations of the USEP and Pool Price. YTL and Seraya had a Contract for Differences dated 1 April 2012 (\u201cthe CFD\u201d) under which YTL bore most of the risk from Seraya\u2019s contracts with its customers. Should Seraya suffer losses from its contract price being lower than the Pool Price, the CFD provided for YTL to pay the difference to Seraya. Conversely, if Seraya made a profit from its contract price being higher than the Pool Price, Seraya would pay a portion of the excess of the contract price over the Pool Price to YTL. We return to this point later as it assumes some significance in analysing Seraya\u2019s remedies for breach of contract.', '18\\u2003With this context in mind, we turn to the specifics of the parties\u2019 contractual relationships.', '19\\u2003Denka first became customers of Seraya in May 2005, although they did change electricity retailers from time to time. In 2012, DSPL also entered into a steam supply agreement dated 16 January 2012 (\u201cthe SSA\u201d) with PowerSeraya Limited, who novated the contract to YTL with effect from 1 April 2012.', '20\\u2003DSPL had two core obligations with regard to its purchase of steam under the SSA. These were:', '(a)\\u2003to take or pay (\u201cTOP\u201d) a certain minimum volume of steam from YTL each month (\u201cthe TOP Volume\u201d); and', '(b)\\u2003to ensure that DSPL\u2019s steam consumption for the duration of the contract did not:', '21\\u2003These obligations for the supply and consumption of steam were to take effect from the Commercial Operation Date under the SSA, which was initially scheduled for 1 February 2012 but was eventually delayed to 1 September 2012.', '22\\u2003Sometime in June 2012, DSPL requested to reduce the amount of steam that it was obliged to buy under the SSA. It sought a reduction of the Minimum Flow and Committed Capacity, which in turn affected the TOP Volume. YTL agreed to discuss the request and this resulted in negotiations over July 2012.', '23\\u2003By a letter dated 7 August 2012, YTL offered DSPL a concession of the original terms of the SSA (\u201cthe Concession Offer\u201d) on the terms and conditions set out in the letter (\u201cthe Concession Terms\u201d). The Concession Terms provided, inter alia, that:', '(a)\\u2003the Committed Capacity and TOP Volume would be reduced;', '(b)\\u2003that \u201cDSPL shall execute or procure the execution of any ancillary supplemental agreement(s) prepared by [YTL] to record the parties\u2019 agreement in respect of the Concession Terms as set out in this letter\u201d; and', '(c)\\u2003that \u201cDSPL shall \u2026 execute an electricity retail agreement with [Seraya] on [Seraya\u2019s] standard terms and conditions for the supply of electricity to all of DSPL\u2019s premises in Singapore, for the period commencing from 1 September 2012 to 31 January 2021 \u2026\u201d [emphasis added].', 'DSPL accepted the Concession Terms by counter-signing on the acceptance slip on 14 August 2012.', '24\\u2003As it turned out, the ancillary supplemental agreement (\u201cASA\u201d) referenced in the Concession Terms could not be finalised and executed by 1 September 2012 because the parties had yet to agree on the scope of modification works needed to accommodate the reduced steam supply. In an e-mail on 30 August 2012, YTL proposed to DSPL additional terms to the earlier Concession Offer (\u201cAdditional Concession Terms\u201d), including that YTL would not be liable for any non-delivery of steam prior to the completion of any modification works on Denka\u2019s end. DSPL accepted those additional terms.', '25\\u2003The parties began implementing the SSA, as amended by the Concession Terms and the Additional Concession Terms, on 1 September 2012. YTL began supplying steam to DSPL pending agreement on the modification works to be done to DSPL\u2019s premises.', '26\\u2003Since YTL\u2019s offer of the Concession Terms on 7 August 2012, Seraya had also been negotiating separately with Denka on the standard terms of the ERAs for the supply of electricity to all three of Denka\u2019s plants in Singapore. Seraya began supplying electricity under the ERAs on 1 September 2012, although the ERAs were only signed between 4 September 2012 and 9 November 2012. In total, Denka and Seraya entered into three ERAs, as follows:', '(a)\\u2003ERA 2012\/099 between Seraya and DSPL, as later amended by a supplemental agreement dated 1 November 2013 (\u201cERA 99\u201d);', '(b)\\u2003ERA 2012\/100 between Seraya and DSPL, which was later superseded by an updated agreement signed on or about 21 February 2014 (\u201cERA 100\u201d) and which is the relevant agreement for present purposes; and', '(c)\\u2003ERA 2012\/101 between Seraya and DAPL, as later amended by a supplemental agreement dated 1 November 2013 (\u201cERA 101\u201d).', '27\\u2003The parties agreed that the pricing plan under the three ERAs would be based on a formula which took into account the prevailing High Sulphur Fuel Oil prices and Foreign Exchange rates. This was referred to in the ERAs as the Index Price Plan. Nevertheless, Denka also had the right to request Seraya to fix the price of electricity for a period of three years, at any point during the duration of the ERAs. As contemplated in the Concession Terms, the ERAs were for a duration of 101 months and were due to expire only on 31 January 2021.', '28\\u2003Finally, as alluded to in our introduction, the ERAs each contained an LD clause. These LD clauses were tied, among other things, to Seraya\u2019s express contractual right to terminate the ERAs under various scenarios, but most notably for any breach by Denka of its obligations under the ERAs. This point will assume central importance in our analysis of the enforceability of the LD clauses later in this judgment.', '29\\u2003On 23 July 2014, representatives from YTL and Denka met. At that meeting, Denka\u2019s General Manager, Ms Chia Miaw Ling (\u201cMs Chia\u201d), mentioned that Denka wanted to \u201cget out\u201d of the ERAs as the price under the ERAs was significantly higher than the prevailing market conditions at the time. Denka had recently completed a round of steam testing and discovered that Denka\u2019s steam usage across all three plants was close to 10.5 tonnes per hour. Accordingly, Ms Chia stated that Denka no longer required the steam reduction under the Concession Terms and desired to return to the original terms of the SSA, and at the same time cease the operation of the ERAs. Denka followed up on the meeting with an e-mail to YTL with presentation slides \u201coutlining Denka\u2019s effort to revert back to the original SSA T&C and hence redeem [themselves] from the electricity contract [ie, the ERAs]\u201d [emphasis added].', '30\\u2003Discussions continued between the parties, as evidenced by a proposal attached to an e-mail from YTL on 11 August 2014. YTL proposed that in exchange for an increase in the TOP Volume and Committed Capacity to 6.0 tonnes per hour and 10.5 tonnes per hour respectively (ie, the original TOP Volume and Committed Capacity envisioned under the SSA (see [20] above)), YTL would grant Denka certain reductions in the price of electricity under the ERAs. Denka indicated that it would consider this proposal.', '31\\u2003On 20 August 2014, however, DSPL wrote to YTL stating that after some consideration, it was unable to take up YTL\u2019s proposal. The letter went on to state:', '32\\u2003YTL and Seraya regarded this letter as evidence of Denka\u2019s intention to repudiate the ERAs. In relation to the SSA, YTL agreed to return to the original terms of the SSA, without amendment. But where the ERAs were concerned, YTL wrote back on 25 August 2014 to state that:', '(a)\\u2003YTL regarded DSPL\u2019s unilateral termination of the ERAs as a repudiatory breach of ERA 99 and ERA 100.', '(b)\\u2003As ERA 101 was between Seraya and DAPL, YTL sought written confirmation that DAPL likewise wished to cease its supply of electricity under the ERA.', '33\\u2003On 28 August 2014, DSPL wrote back to YTL on behalf of the Denka companies, strongly denying any allegations of repudiation or other breaches of the ERAs. Denka stated that the Concession Offer was \u201csubject to contract\u201d, namely the execution of the ASA. Since the ASA was never signed, under the original terms of the SSA, Denka was only required to purchase steam and not electricity under the ERAs.', '34\\u2003Further correspondence was exchanged between YTL, Denka and Seraya in the ensuing months. Eventually, each of the ERAs was terminated as follows:', '(a)\\u2003ERA 100: By way of a letter dated 28 August 2014, Seraya accepted DSPL\u2019s cessation of ERA 100 and indicated that the effective date of termination was 1 September 2014.', '(b)\\u2003ERA 99: On 4 September 2014, Seraya wrote to DSPL and again gave notice to the latter to perform its obligations under ERA 99. DSPL was invited to reconsider its cessation of the contract, and to confirm its position by 11 September 2014. DSPL responded on 7 October 2014 to confirm its intention to cease performing both ERA 99 and ERA 101, and contended that it was only required to pay for electricity based on the open market rates charged by MSSL after 1 September 2014. ERA 99 was terminated by Seraya with effect from 15 October 2014.', '(c)\\u2003ERA 101: Notwithstanding DSPL\u2019s reply to YTL on DAPL\u2019s behalf (see [33] above), Seraya wrote to DAPL on several occasions between 4 September 2014 and 13 October 2014 to further confirm DAPL\u2019s position on whether it would cease performing its obligations under ERA 101. DAPL did not reply. Eventually, Seraya gave notice of termination of ERA 101 with effect from 14 November 2014.', 'Seraya claimed LD under all three ERAs. For ERA 99 and ERA 101, Seraya additionally claimed payment for electricity supplied up to their respective dates of termination.', '35\\u2003It also bears mentioning that in a letter dated 3 September 2014, Denka offered to continue purchasing electricity under the three ERAs while the dispute was being determined by the court (\u201cthe Mitigation Offer\u201d). This was, as Denka added, \u201cto protect [its] rights\u201d. Seraya did not accept the Mitigation Offer.', '36\\u2003On 19 December 2014, Seraya commenced the Suits against DAPL and DSPL for breaches of their respective ERAs and sought LD or common law damages in the alternative. YTL was joined as a third party to Denka\u2019s counterclaims in the Suits. The Suits were eventually consolidated by consent of the parties.'"}
{"casename":"2020_SGCA_12","fact":"'5\\u2003The present parties went to arbitration over disputes relating to the construction of a power generation plant in Guatemala (\u201cthe Plant\u201d and \u201cthe Project\u201d). The appellant, China Machine New Energy Corporation (\u201cCMNC\u201d), was the contractor, and the respondents, Jaguar Energy Guatemala LLC (\u201cJaguar Energy\u201d) and AEI Guatemala Jaguar Ltd (\u201cAEI Guatemala\u201d) (collectively referred to as \u201cJaguar\u201d), were the owners of the Plant.', '6\\u2003The substantive contractual dispute between the parties concerned two key agreements. The first was the Engineering, Procurement and Construction Contract (\u201cthe EPC Contract\u201d) entered into in March 2008 between CMNC and Jaguar Energy. The EPC Contract provided for the construction of the Plant for an approximate sum of US$450m, to be paid by Jaguar Energy to CMNC in instalments upon the completion of certain milestones. The second was the Deferred Payment Security Agreement (\u201cDPSA\u201d), entered into sometime in November 2009. Under the DPSA, CMNC agreed to finance the Project by allowing Jaguar Energy the option of issuing debit notes in its favour instead of making the relevant milestone payments. These debit notes were secured by interests in Jaguar Energy\u2019s assets, including its rights under the EPC Contract.', '7\\u2003Work on the Project\u2019s two phases commenced in March 2010, and was expected to be completed in March and June 2013 respectively. Sometime in November 2010, Jaguar Energy exercised its option under the DPSA to issue debit notes in lieu of making cash payments. In all, Jaguar Energy issued a total of 61 debit notes with a total value of approximately US$129m.', '8\\u2003Signs of trouble first appeared in 2013, when CMNC failed to meet the scheduled take-over dates for both phases of the works. In October and November 2013, Jaguar Energy issued notices of breach, and reserved its right to terminate the EPC Contract. In response, on 28 November 2013, CMNC purported to exercise its \u201cstep-in rights\u201d as secured lender under the DPSA to take over Jaguar Energy\u2019s rights under the EPC Contract. On the next day, 29 November 2013, Jaguar Energy notified CMNC of its intention to terminate the EPC Contract, and requested that CMNC vacate the work site (\u201cthe Site\u201d) within 15 days.', '9\\u2003The Site comprised two separate areas: the Construction Area and the Living Quarters. On 11 December 2013, Jaguar Energy fenced off the Construction Area and prevented CMNC\u2019s employees from entering CMNC\u2019s site office, which contained documents related to the construction of the Plant. At that stage, CMNC retained access to the Living Quarters and therefore to project documents that were stored in laptops and computers that had been kept in the Living Quarters.', '10\\u2003On 14 December 2013 (upon the expiry of the 15-day notice period), Jaguar Energy informed CMNC of the termination of the EPC Contract with immediate effect, and asserted that the DPSA was also therefore automatically terminated by its own terms. On the same day, Jaguar Energy terminated CMNC\u2019s access to Project Solve, which was a shared online document platform which contained communications and construction documentation relating to the Project.', '11\\u2003CMNC\u2019s staff continued to reside in the Living Quarters until 20 June 2014, when CMNC\u2019s employees were, by an order of the Guatemalan courts, sent to an immigration shelter. According to CMNC, Jaguar then seized two desktop computers and hard drives containing documents concerning the Project from the Living Quarters. CMNC\u2019s employees were subsequently released from the immigration shelter on 28 July 2014.', '12\\u2003On 28 January 2014, Jaguar commenced arbitral proceedings (\u201cthe Arbitration\u201d) against CMNC under cl 20.2 of the EPC Contract. Clause 20.2 provided for disputes to be referred to a Singapore-seated arbitration conducted under the 1998 Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce. Notably, cl 20.2 provided for an expedited arbitration: it required that the award be issued within 90 days of the selection of the third arbitrator; or, if the majority of the arbitrators agreed, within a further 90 days.', '13\\u2003In gist, Jaguar\u2019s case in the Arbitration was that it had validly terminated the EPC Contract for CMNC\u2019s breach, and that it was entitled to, amongst other reliefs, the aggregate cost of completing the Project (\u201cthe Estimate to Complete Claim\u201d, or \u201cthe ETC Claim\u201d). CMNC denied Jaguar\u2019s claims, and made counterclaims asserting Jaguar\u2019s breach of the DPSA. The ETC Claim, which was allowed, almost in its entirety, by the arbitral tribunal (\u201cthe Tribunal\u201d), is central to these proceedings because the nub of CMNC\u2019s complaint is that it was not allowed a full opportunity to respond to that claim.', '14\\u2003According to CMNC, its response to the ETC claim required it to undertake two strands of analyses:', '(a)\\u2003The Interrogation Analysis: This involved interrogating the quantum of the ETC Claim by reference to Jaguar\u2019s supporting documents. This entailed checking whether Jaguar\u2019s post-termination contractors (being those engaged to complete the remaining works after CMNC\u2019s termination) had been procured competitively; whether invoices issued were adequately supported by contracts or purchase orders, and were consistent with Jaguar\u2019s construction records; and assessing whether the work done and equipment purchased were within the scope of the EPC Contract. On the last aspect, CMNC\u2019s point was that the cost of any work done that was over and above the contractual specification would constitute betterment and would not be claimable.', '(b)\\u2003The Comparison Analysis: This involved ascertaining the quantities of work that CMNC left incomplete by reference to the quantities of work that CMNC did complete (\u201cthe Completed Work Quantities\u201d), and comparing that against the quantities of work procured by Jaguar from the post-termination contractors. According to CMNC, the Comparison Analysis was critical because the reasonableness of the quantum of Jaguar\u2019s ETC Claim was inherently suspect given that it exceeded the remaining value under the EPC Contract by more than 300%. In other words, according to CMNC, Jaguar spent more than three times what it would have cost had CMNC been allowed to complete the remaining works.', '15\\u2003To carry out the Interrogation and Comparison Analyses, CMNC claimed that it needed access to the following categories of documents:', '(a)\\u2003The Construction Documents: This comprised pre-termination documentary records of the works that were necessary for the determination of the Completed Work Quantities (and were therefore essential to the Comparison Analysis). According to CMNC, it was deprived of the Construction Documents by Jaguar\u2019s seizure of the Site before the EPC Contract was terminated (see [9] above).', '(b)\\u2003The Bid Documents: This comprised documents related to the bid and tender process leading to the engagement of the post-termination contractors by Jaguar to complete the Project after CMNC\u2019s departure, and these were required in order to assess whether Jaguar\u2019s ETC Claim was unreasonable and excessive as a result of its failure to conduct a competitive bid process. This was a part of the Interrogation Analysis.', '(c)\\u2003The Costs Documents: This comprised invoices, contracts and purchase orders relating to Jaguar\u2019s post-termination construction expenditure. The Costs Documents were necessary for CMNC\u2019s assessment of the costs incurred by Jaguar (both actual and committed) in completing the works, and were therefore essential to the Comparison Analysis. The production of the Costs Documents was complicated by the fact that the Project completion works and the Arbitration were running in parallel. This meant that new Costs Documents were being generated (and produced to the Tribunal) on a rolling basis, and that accordingly, the quantum of the ETC Claim (which comprised both estimated and actual costs of completion) had to be continually updated as previously \u201cestimated\u201d costs became \u201cactual\u201d costs upon their being incurred in the course of the works. Ultimately, work on the Project was only completed after the conclusion of the main evidentiary hearing (see [72] below).', '16\\u2003We return to the procedural history of the arbitral proceedings. The last member of the three-man Tribunal was appointed on 27 March 2014. This meant that the 90-day period prescribed under cl 20.2 of the EPC Contract for the completion of the arbitration would have expired on 25 June 2014, or, if extended a further 90 days, on 23 September 2014.', '17\\u2003On 1 May 2014, the parties agreed to amend this timeline. The agreed timelines were set out in Procedural Order No 2 (\u201cPO 2\u201d) dated 7 May 2014. PO 2 provided for the exchange of the parties\u2019 experts\u2019 reports on 19 December 2014, and fixed the main evidentiary hearing for January and February 2015. We note that these hearing dates fell well after even the extended 180-day deadline for the issue of the Tribunal\u2019s award stipulated in cl 20.2.', '18\\u2003Notably, notwithstanding that parties had agreed on the timelines in PO 2 on 1 May 2014, CMNC requested, on 6 May 2014, that the main evidentiary hearing be brought forward to October 2014. Jaguar opposed CMNC\u2019s request on the basis that the proposed revised timelines were not realistic given the state of the parties\u2019 preparations. On 14 May 2014, the Tribunal rejected CMNC\u2019s request to bring forward the main evidentiary hearing, reasoning that the extended timelines already represented the most expeditious process having regard to the demands of due process and the need to ensure a fair hearing.', '19\\u2003Thereafter, the parties continued with the process of document disclosure. In its Statement of Case filed on 13 August 2014, Jaguar stated that it was withholding production of 13 of the 375 documentary exhibits referenced in its Statement of Case (\u201cthe 13 Exhibits\u201d). According to Jaguar, there were real concerns that CMNC would misuse the information contained therein (in particular, information identifying Jaguar\u2019s post-termination contractors) to interfere with the Project. In this regard, Jaguar alleged that CMNC had already engaged in a series of \u201cthreatening actions\u201d against it and its contractors, including bribing contractors away from working with Jaguar and physically intimidating contractors, suppliers and employees. For this reason, Jaguar indicated that it would only be willing to disclose the 13 Exhibits to CMNC on an Attorneys\u2019 Eyes Only (\u201cAEO\u201d) basis, so that the documents would only be made available to CMNC\u2019s external counsel and expert witnesses but not to CMNC\u2019s employees. Jaguar took the same position in respect of certain documents (other than the 13 Exhibits) in response to several of CMNC\u2019s requests to produce, on the basis that these too implicated similar confidentiality concerns.', '20\\u2003CMNC denied the allegations, and insisted that Jaguar produce, without restriction, the 13 Exhibits, which comprised contracts and purchase orders issued to post-termination contractors, post-termination completion schedules and daily reports. According to CMNC, these documents were necessary for it to evaluate the reasonableness of the ETC Claim, and prohibiting disclosure of these documents to CMNC\u2019s employees by imposing an AEO regime would handicap CMNC\u2019s ability to assess and instruct counsel on those documents. Further correspondence was exchanged by the parties in an attempt to agree upon a disclosure regime that would meet Jaguar\u2019s concerns over confidentiality, but to no avail.', '21\\u2003On 22 September 2014, Jaguar applied to the Tribunal for an order permitting it to produce the 13 Exhibits (as well as certain other documents requested by CMNC) on an AEO basis (\u201cAEO Order\u201d). These documents fell within three broad categories: (i) post-termination contracts, project schedules and reports containing information identifying Jaguar\u2019s post-termination contractors; (ii) high-level corporate information pertaining to Jaguar Energy\u2019s parent company, AEI Ltd; and (iii) bid documents containing information about the corporate structure of AEI Ltd. Jaguar submitted that there were real concerns that this information might be misused by CMNC to \u201cinterfere in the Project or otherwise interfere with [AEI Ltd] and its shareholders\u201d.', '22\\u2003CMNC objected to Jaguar\u2019s request for the AEO Order on four grounds. First, an AEO Order that prohibited CMNC\u2019s employees from accessing the documents in question would be procedurally unfair because CMNC\u2019s employees would be best placed to comment and give instructions on them, and if the order was made, these employees would not be able properly to instruct counsel. Second, CMNC would not in fact misuse the information. Third, Jaguar\u2019s request was tantamount to an invitation to the Tribunal to pre-judge fiercely disputed matters concerning CMNC\u2019s conduct. Fourth, the concept of AEO disclosure was a feature of domestic dispute resolution in the US and should not be imported into international arbitration.', '23\\u2003On 25 September 2014, the Tribunal ruled in favour of Jaguar, and permitted its disclosure of the 13 Exhibits and the other documents on an AEO basis. On CMNC\u2019s point that the use of AEO orders was a peculiarity of domestic dispute resolution in the US, the Tribunal noted that such orders have in fact been employed in international arbitrations to preserve the confidentiality of disclosed documents. The real question was whether such an order was required in the present, and in determining that issue the Tribunal weighed and balanced the competing interests of both parties as follows:', '24\\u2003While the Tribunal did not reach any concluded view on Jaguar\u2019s allegations that CMNC would misuse the relevant documents, it nevertheless considered the possibility of misuse to be a \u201cserious concern\u201d which needed to be addressed. Having regard to both CMNC\u2019s interest in access for the purpose of preparing its case, and Jaguar\u2019s concerns over confidentiality, the Tribunal crafted an AEO regime (\u201cthe AEO Regime\u201d) which in its view struck an appropriate balance between these competing considerations.', '25\\u2003This balance was achieved by the establishment of a two-stage process by which documents subject to the AEO Regime would be disclosed. At the first stage, and as a default position, any material designated \u201cAEO\u201d would be disclosed to CMNC\u2019s external counsel (and, as was subsequently clarified, to expert witnesses as well), but not to CMNC\u2019s employees. This addressed Jaguar\u2019s concern for confidentiality. However, at the second stage, CMNC was expressly entitled to apply to the Tribunal for its employees to be given access to AEO-designated documents for the purposes of giving instructions to counsel, on the basis that the specified individuals to whom access was to be granted be identified, the necessity of their having access established, and an undertaking as to confidentiality be furnished.', '26\\u2003On 26 September 2014, CMNC requested that the Tribunal reconsider its decision to allow Jaguar to disclose documents under the AEO Regime, relying on, amongst other things, the concern that such disclosure would hinder the preparation of its defence. On 30 September 2014, in Tribunal Communication (\u201cTC\u201d) No 51, the Tribunal upheld its decision, noting that CMNC\u2019s concerns relating to the preparation of its defence were adequately addressed by its right to apply for employee access to the documents under the second stage of the AEO Regime:', '27\\u2003Despite the Tribunal\u2019s express reference to CMNC\u2019s right to apply for disclosure under the second stage, it is undisputed that CMNC never made any such application to the Tribunal.', '28\\u2003On 2 October 2014, pursuant to the AEO Order, Jaguar disclosed the 13 Exhibits to CMNC\u2019s external counsel and expert witnesses. This was seven days after the AEO Order had been made.', '29\\u2003Just ten days after the creation of the AEO Regime, CMNC sought, by Respondent\u2019s Communication (\u201cRC\u201d) No 43 dated 5 October 2014, to have the AEO Regime lifted and replaced by a disclosure regime under which documents would be produced to CMNC\u2019s employees, albeit with sensitive information pertaining to Jaguar\u2019s contractors\u2019 names redacted. The parties subsequently managed to reach an agreement regarding the production of one of the 13 Exhibits, and CMNC requested that the Tribunal lift the AEO Regime in respect of the remaining 12 exhibits which the parties could not agree on.', '30\\u2003Besides the disclosure of documents, a second procedural issue which required resolution concerned the timelines leading to the main evidentiary hearing. By RC No 48 dated 15 October 2014, CMNC sought a reset of the timelines previously agreed and recorded in PO 2 on the basis that its preparations had been delayed by the dispute over the AEO Regime, which had \u201cimposed severe practical limitations on effective defence preparation\u201d. Jaguar objected to CMNC\u2019s request.', '31\\u2003On 17 October 2014, a teleconference involving the Tribunal and the parties was convened to address both the redaction issue raised in RC No 43 and the timelines issue raised in RC No 48.', '(a)\\u2003On the redaction issue, CMNC submitted that redaction of the names and identifying information of Jaguar\u2019s post-termination contractors would adequately address Jaguar\u2019s concern as to maintaining the confidentiality of that information, and that the AEO Regime was therefore no longer necessary and should be lifted. Jaguar did not contest CMNC\u2019s point that redaction was in principle an adequate substitute for AEO-designation, but sought permission to redact an additional category of information \u2013 information relating to the dates of key construction activities and dates of deliveries \u2013 on the basis that that information might also be misused by CMNC to interfere with the Project works.', '(b)\\u2003On the issue of timelines, CMNC informed the Tribunal that its preparations were behind schedule; in particular, its experts would not be able to file their reports as planned in December 2014, and would instead require an additional two or three months, thus necessitating an adjournment of the main evidentiary hearing previously fixed for January and February 2015. For the same reasons, it was submitted that a hearing which had been fixed on 6\u20137 November 2014 in Toronto (\u201cthe Toronto Hearing\u201d) for the experts to discuss draft outlines of their opinions would likely be unfruitful. The Tribunal requested that CMNC provide it a written update on the status of its experts\u2019 preparation, and indicated that it was minded to proceed with the Toronto Hearing for the parties to discuss case management, amongst other things.', '32\\u2003On 19 October 2014, the Tribunal ruled in favour of CMNC on the redaction issue and lifted the AEO Regime. The 12 disputed exhibits (see [29] above) were to be disclosed to CMNC (including to its employees) albeit with information identifying Jaguar\u2019s contractors redacted (\u201cthe Redaction Ruling\u201d). As regards Jaguar\u2019s request that information pertaining to the dates of key construction activities also be redacted, the Tribunal rejected this and concluded that \u201cthe redactions which [CMNC] \u2026 proposed adequately represents an appropriate balance of the interests of the Parties\u201d.', '33\\u2003It bears noting that the Redaction Ruling came less than a month after the AEO Order was made (in other words, the AEO Regime was lifted after less than a month of operation) and more than eight months before the main evidentiary hearing (which was eventually postponed to July 2015).', '34\\u2003On 25 October 2014, six days after the Redaction Ruling, Jaguar began to disclose the relevant redacted documents to CMNC. This involved two parallel tracks of disclosure: redacted copies of the documents were furnished to CMNC\u2019s employees, and sister sets of unredacted documents were furnished to CMNC\u2019s external counsel and experts. According to CMNC, the way in which the sister sets were produced made them difficult to review. In particular, the sets were not indexed or numbered uniformly, making it difficult to correlate documents in the redacted and unredacted sets. It was also undisputed that there were discrepancies in the redacted and unredacted sets initially produced, in that Jaguar did not provide redacted versions of every document initially. Redacted versions of these documents were eventually provided to CMNC by 15 November 2014.', '35\\u2003On 6\u20137 November 2014, at the Toronto Hearing, the Tribunal addressed CMNC\u2019s request for an adjournment of the dates for the main evidentiary hearing. The following transpired at the hearing:', '(a)\\u2003It was decided that it was no longer possible to hold the main evidentiary hearing in January and February 2015 given the state of CMNC\u2019s preparations. CMNC claimed that the delay in its preparations was caused by its lack of access to the Construction Documents (following its eviction from the Site) as well as the imposition of the AEO Regime.', '(b)\\u2003It was also decided that the main evidentiary hearing would be postponed to July 2015. Adjusted timelines based on the new hearing dates were to be discussed and agreed between the parties, and subsequently recorded in a new procedural order to be issued by the Tribunal.', '(c)\\u2003It was agreed that a virtual data room would be set up to facilitate the sharing of documents amongst the parties\u2019 experts.', '36\\u2003Pursuant to what had been discussed at the Toronto Hearing, the parties subsequently worked together on drafting a new procedural order. Three aspects of the draft procedural order are pertinent. The first relates to the procedural timelines leading to the main evidentiary hearing (including, for example, timelines for the filing of the parties\u2019 cases and expert reports). The second pertains to the provision made for the rolling production of Jaguar\u2019s Costs Documents due to the ongoing completion of the Project works (see [15(c)] above). Both of these points were agreed between the parties.', '37\\u2003The third point, which the parties were unable to agree on, pertained to Jaguar\u2019s request that it be relieved of its obligation to provide redacted copies of contracts and purchase orders with a value of less than US$100,000, leaving such documents to be produced on an AEO basis (meaning that they would be produced only to CMNC\u2019s external counsel and experts). It appeared that CMNC was initially amenable to this arrangement; it had, by way of an email dated 28 October 2014 (just nine days after the Redaction Ruling), indicated that it was agreeable \u201cfor now\u201d to relieve Jaguar of its obligation to produce redacted copies of contracts and purchase orders involving sums of $100,000 or less. In fact, when this matter was first raised in initial discussions on the draft PO 3, CMNC\u2019s counsel agreed to a similar concession. It was only subsequently, after Jaguar proposed the insertion of language formalising the concession in the draft procedural order, that CMNC resiled from its position, stating that, after \u201cfurther consideration\u201d, CMNC \u201cdid not see any reason for inclusion of this language\u201d and concluded that it \u201cdoes need access to such documents\u201d to be afforded to its employees for the purposes of preparing its defence against the ETC Claim.', '38\\u2003These three points were then addressed by the Tribunal in Procedural Order No 3 dated 18 December 2014 (\u201cPO 3\u201d).', '(a)\\u2003A new procedural timetable was set pursuant to CMNC\u2019s request for an adjournment of the main evidentiary hearing to July 2015. As mentioned, these timelines had been agreed between the parties.', '(b)\\u2003Provision was made for Jaguar to \u201ccontinue to supplement their production of documents\u2026 (to the extent such documents exist or come into existence) due to the ongoing nature of the Project completion effort\u201d. This too had been agreed between the parties.', '(c)\\u2003On Jaguar\u2019s obligations under the Redaction Ruling, which the parties had been unable to agree, the Tribunal granted Jaguar\u2019s request for the modification of the Redaction Ruling. Under this modified regime, the status quo under the Redaction Ruling was to remain in relation to documents already redacted and disclosed. However, in relation to any further documents to be disclosed by Jaguar (whether in response to CMNC\u2019s requests to produce, or as part of the material which its experts would seek to rely on), only contracts, purchase orders or invoices with a value of US$100,000 or more needed to be redacted and disclosed; documents with a value below that threshold could simply be produced on an AEO basis (meaning only to CMNC\u2019s external counsel and experts), albeit subject to CMNC\u2019s right to apply for production of such documents.', '39\\u2003The effect of PO 3 on the parties\u2019 preparation of their respective cases was significant in three respects. First, PO 3 modified the application of the Redaction Ruling to any further contracts, purchase orders and invoices to be disclosed by reinstating the AEO Regime in relation to documents pertaining to claims with a value of less than US$100,000. The practical effect that this modification had on the parties\u2019 preparation may be assessed both in terms of the absolute number of documents affected as well as the monetary value they represented. On CMNC\u2019s estimate, there were 143 documents each concerned with a value exceeding US$100,000 (worth a total of US$188,790,048.92), against about 2,900 documents each concerned with a value at or below that threshold (worth a total of US$14,521,839.56). Therefore, while the majority of documents (by number) were now no longer subject to the Redaction Ruling, the total value of the claim represented by documents still subject to the Redaction Ruling was far higher than the total value represented by those which were not.', '40\\u2003Second, PO 3 postponed the date of the main evidentiary hearing and reset all ancillary procedural timelines to take into account the concerns and considerations of the parties. It must be emphasised that these new timelines were agreed between the parties, and, critically, agreed in the context of all that had transpired up to then, such as the imposition of the AEO Regime and its subsequent lifting by the Redaction Ruling, and all the difficulties which CMNC claims it suffered as a result of these orders. While the Tribunal did modify the Redaction Ruling by PO 3 (see [38(c)] and [39] above), CMNC did not, at the time PO 3 was issued, request a further adjustment of the agreed procedural timelines on account of that.', '41\\u2003Third, PO 3 recorded the parties\u2019 agreement that Jaguar be permitted to produce contracts, purchase orders and invoices pertaining to the completion of the Project on a rolling basis as the works progressed. These documents evidenced Jaguar\u2019s costs of completion, which, as mentioned, formed the basis of its ETC Claim, and therefore enabled Jaguar to continually update the quantum of its ETC Claim (see [15(c)] above). Over the course of the Arbitration, Jaguar produced a total of four updates to the initial ETC Claim quantum first stated in Jaguar\u2019s Statement of Case. The ETC Claim quantum included both (i) costs actually incurred, and (ii) estimates of costs expected to be incurred. Primarily, the updates to the ETC Claim reflected complementary changes in (i) and (ii), as estimated costs were actually incurred in the course of the Project works. Notably, however, the updates also reflected overall increases in the total sum claimed. Each tranche of the documents supporting each update was accompanied by a \u201ctransaction log\u201d, which was a list of transactions corresponding to the documents uploaded. For convenience, we refer to each tranche of documents by the exhibit number of the transaction log accompanying it, as follows:', '42\\u2003Even as PO 3 was an attempt to resolve a number of the key case management issues, other developments were taking place. In January and February 2015, some six months or so prior to the main evidentiary hearing, CMNC made extensive changes to its team of external counsel and expert witnesses. On 15 January 2015, CMNC informed the Tribunal that its counsel for the expert issues of design, scheduling and quantum, Reed Smith LLP, would be replaced by MinterEllison. Three days later, CMNC announced that its counsel for all remaining matters, Herbert Smith Freehills LLP, would be replaced by King & Wood Mallesons (\u201cKWM\u201d). On 27 May 2015, at the doorstep of the main evidentiary hearing, CMNC replaced MinterEllison with counsel from State Chambers.', '43\\u2003Over the course of January and February 2015, CMNC also replaced its experts on quantum, scheduling and Guatemala law. The most significant change, for present purposes, concerns the replacement of CMNC\u2019s quantum expert, Mr Iain Wishart, with Mr Charles Gurnham (\u201cMr Gurnham\u201d) on 24 January 2015. The expert evidence on quantum lies at the heart of the present proceedings because the main thrust of CMNC\u2019s case is that it was not given a full opportunity to respond to Jaguar\u2019s case on the quantum of the ETC Claim. We return to this at [127] below.', '44\\u2003Another developing issue concerned the rolling production of Costs Documents. Over the course of the Arbitration, Jaguar produced a total of four tranches of Costs Documents supporting four corresponding updates to the quantum of its ETC Claim (see [41] above). The first tranche of documents was uploaded on 10 February 2015 upon the establishment of the experts\u2019 shared data room (see [35(c)] above). This was followed by a protracted exchange of correspondence (beginning in February 2015 and ending only in June 2015) between the parties\u2019 counsel in relation to alleged irregularities and discrepancies in the documents uploaded by Jaguar\u2019s counsel, Varela, Lee, Metz & Guarino LLP (\u201cVLMG\u201d).', '45\\u2003KWM\u2019s chief complaint pertained to VLMG\u2019s failure to provide an index to the documents uploaded in the data room, which, KWM said, had significantly slowed its review because the documents had not been classified or grouped according to their nature, and their file names were non-descript and not in the least illuminative. This was compounded by the fact that there were discrepancies between the entries in the transaction logs and the supporting invoices uploaded to the data room, and that Jaguar, in uploading each new batch of invoices, had simply replaced the existing invoice folder rather than placing new invoices in a separate folder, with the result that CMNC had to go through every invoice in the replacement folder to determine whether or not it had been provided before.', '46\\u2003In relation to KWM\u2019s request for an index, VLMG explained that the transaction logs accompanying each upload themselves served as indices to the documents uploaded. Over the course of several e-mail exchanges, VLMG (i) provided step-by-step instructions to KWM as to how specific documents in the data room could be located by reference to the entries listed in the transaction logs, (ii) offered to walk KWM through the documents uploaded through teleconferences between counsel and\/or the parties\u2019 quantum experts, and (iii) uploaded documents listed in the transaction logs which it had omitted to upload.', '47\\u2003Ultimately, the parties remained unable to resolve the matter; KWM\u2019s final email to VLMG on this subject (dated 28 May 2015) noted that there remained discrepancies between the invoices listed in the C-699 transaction logs and the invoices uploaded to the data room. Notably, CMNC did not raise these concerns to the Tribunal over the course of the entire four-month exchange, despite Jaguar\u2019s position (repeated over the course of that exchange) that it would proceed as directed by the Tribunal should CMNC decide to bring its complaints to the Tribunal\u2019s attention.', '48\\u2003Separately, on 17 February 2015, CMNC applied to the Tribunal for the AEO Regime to be lifted altogether on the basis that the Project was due to be completed by May 2015, and further that the names of Jaguar\u2019s contractors were, by then, public knowledge. It was submitted that in these circumstances, there could be no real risk of impropriety by CMNC that could affect the completion of the Project.', '49\\u2003The parties then entered into discussions, and, on 17 March 2015, informed the Tribunal that they had agreed that Jaguar would disclose all material (both that previously disclosed, as well as any further material to be disclosed) in unredacted form to 28 specified CMNC employees. This agreement was then recorded in a Supplemental Order issued by the Tribunal dated 18 March 2015.', '50\\u2003In other words, on 18 March 2015, some three and a half months before the main evidentiary hearing in July 2015, the AEO Regime was completely lifted; all documents was thenceforth to be produced in unredacted form to CMNC\u2019s (specified) employees.', '51\\u2003CMNC did not make any application at this stage to postpone the main evidentiary hearing. On the contrary, CMNC had, in the weeks before the AEO Regime was lifted, applied (successfully) to amend its case, and in doing so contended that acceptance of its proposed amendments \u201cwould not impact the July 2015 Main Evidentiary Hearing dates\u201d, stating \u201cexpressly that its intention is to proceed with the hearing dates as they stand\u201d.', '52\\u2003By Procedural Order No 4 (\u201cPO 4\u201d) dated 18 March 2015, the Tribunal issued timelines for the remainder of the Arbitration. Most pertinently for present purposes, this included the timeline for the submission of Mr Gurnham\u2019s report (\u201cthe Gurnham Responsive Report\u201d) in response to the report prepared by Jaguar\u2019s quantum expert, Mr Patrick McGeehin (\u201cMr McGeehin\u201d), which was due for submission on 15 May 2015, and was eventually filed late by CMNC (see [65] below). We set out the key timelines that were stipulated in PO 4 in the table below:', '53\\u2003As late as 14 April 2015, Mr Gurnham confirmed in a teleconference with the Tribunal that he would be able to meet the 15 May 2015 deadline for the Gurnham Responsive Report:', '54\\u2003Mr Gurnham\u2019s assurances notwithstanding, on 8 May 2015, the parties agreed an extension of time for CMNC\u2019s submission of the Gurnham Responsive Report to 5 June 2015 (instead of 15 May 2015).', '55\\u2003On 22 May 2015, Jaguar uploaded a third tranche of supporting documents corresponding to the C-840 update (see [41] above).', '56\\u2003On 29 May 2015, CMNC sought by RC No 217 a short extension of time for the submission of the Gurnham Responsive Report to 10 June 2015 (from 5 June 2015) on the basis that it was \u201cnot possible or reasonable for Mr Gurnham to have had a proper opportunity to analyse the large number of documents relied upon by [Mr McGeehin]\u201d which had been uploaded to the data room since February 2015, including the aforementioned 22 May 2015 disclosure corresponding to the C-840 update (see [55] above).', '57\\u2003Before the Tribunal could rule on CMNC\u2019s request dated 29 May 2015 for an extension of time for the filing of the Gurnham Responsive Report to 10 June 2015, CMNC requested (by RC No 219) on the very next day, 30 May 2015, that (a) a cut-off date of 3 April 2015 be imposed on documents to be relied upon by Mr McGeehin; or, (b) in the event the Tribunal was minded to allow Jaguar to rely on documents produced after 3 April 2015, that, in the alternative, Mr Gurnham be granted an extension of time for the filing of the Gurnham Responsive Report, to 18 June 2015. RC No 219 stated, in material part, as follows:', '58\\u2003Notably, CMNC still did not request a postponement of the July 2015 main evidentiary hearing. Nor was any explanation given as to what had transpired overnight such that the request made the previous day was no longer sufficient.', '59\\u2003In TC No 208 dated 2 June 2015, the Tribunal ordered as follows: (i) a cut-off date was to be imposed for the production of documents and particulars relating to Jaguar\u2019s costs to complete, though not of 3 April 2015, but of 5 June 2015 instead; and (ii) CMNC\u2019s request for an extension of the deadline for the filing of the Gurnham Responsive Report to 18 June 2015 was granted. In other words, the Tribunal granted CMNC the relief it sought in terms of para 12(b) of its request dated 30 May 2015.', '60\\u2003In deciding not to impose a cut-off date of 3 April 2015 (and thereby exclude from its consideration documents produced after that date), the Tribunal was clearly conscious of the need to allow each party an opportunity to present its case, and to respond to the case against it, a task complicated by the very short timelines remaining available in the lead-up to the main evidentiary hearing in July 2015:', '61\\u2003We note that CMNC did not thereafter object to or challenge the Tribunal\u2019s decision to allow Jaguar\u2019s continued production of documents up till 5 June 2015.', '62\\u2003On 5 June 2015, the last day for the production of documents pertaining to Jaguar\u2019s costs to complete, Jaguar uploaded the final tranche of Costs Documents to the data room (see [41] above).', '63\\u2003On 17 June 2015, one day before the Gurnham Responsive Report was due for submission, CMNC sought yet another extension to 25 June 2015. According to CMNC, the volume of material disclosed on 5 June 2015 was of \u201cextraordinary size\u201d, and this, coupled with Jaguar\u2019s recent production of documents relating to Exhibits C-699, C-773 and C-840, meant that Mr Gurnham required more time to properly review the material in preparing his responsive report. Jaguar opposed CMNC\u2019s request, noting that it would have to consider Mr Gurnham\u2019s report in the submission of its pre-hearing brief, which was due to the Tribunal on 26 June 2015.', '64\\u2003On 18 June 2015, the Tribunal rejected CMNC\u2019s request for an extension. In its reasons for that decision, the Tribunal noted the following:', '(a)\\u2003the material to be provided by Jaguar to CMNC on 5 June 2015 had already been taken into account in the Tribunal\u2019s extension of the deadline to 18 June 2015;', '(b)\\u2003the Tribunal\u2019s repeated reminders to the parties that applications for extensions of time should be made adequately in advance of, and not on the eve of the expiry of the deadline; and', '(c)\\u2003the \u201cvery close proximity to the Main Evidentiary Hearing\u201d.', 'Given these circumstances, the Tribunal held that CMNC had not \u201cmade out a case for disturbing the balance which the Tribunal struck in [TC No 208]\u201d.', '65\\u2003On 22 June 2015, CMNC filed the Gurnham Responsive Report out of time. Upon reviewing that document, Jaguar discovered that it referred to a further report by CMNC\u2019s design expert, Mr Adam Aspinall (\u201cMr Aspinall\u201d and \u201cthe Aspinall Report\u201d). The Aspinall Report had not hitherto been mentioned by CMNC, and no leave had been sought for its submission. Nor had it been filed at that stage. On the same day, Jaguar objected to any belated filing of the Gurnham Responsive Report, and drew the Tribunal\u2019s attention to the references therein to the Aspinall Report.', '66\\u2003On 25 June 2015, one day before the parties\u2019 pre-hearing submissions were due for filing, CMNC filed the Aspinall Report, along with six witness statements which it said were responsive to the material produced by Jaguar on 5 June 2015 (and for the submission of which too, no leave had been granted). As to how Jaguar could be expected to respond to these new filings given the short notice, CMNC\u2019s position was simply that \u201c[s]hould [Jaguar] wish to respond or make further submissions, they can either raise them now or respond at the main hearing\u201d. Again, CMNC did not suggest that the evidentiary hearing could not proceed as scheduled.', '67\\u2003On 27 June 2015, by RC No 245, CMNC formally applied to admit the Gurnham Responsive Report, the Aspinall Report, as well as the six witness statements. CMNC submitted that these reports and statements were necessary in order that CMNC might \u201cproperly present its case\u201d. In support of its application, CMNC submitted that the Tribunal\u2019s imposition of the AEO Regime and its decision to allow Jaguar to produce copious documents on an ongoing basis and to update its ETC Claim significantly impacted CMNC\u2019s ability to properly respond to the factual issues raised by Jaguar\u2019s expert and lay witnesses. CMNC referred to the Tribunal\u2019s duty under Art 18 of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration (\u201cthe Model Law\u201d) to treat the parties equally and ensure that each is given a full opportunity to present its case, and submitted that its reports and statements should be admitted, as \u201c[Jaguar], despite [its] strident protestations, have sufficient opportunity to review this supplemental evidence, and deal with it [at the main evidentiary hearing] in Dublin\u201d.', '68\\u2003On 29 June 2015, the Tribunal reserved the issue of whether to exclude the evidence referred to in RC No 245 for consideration at the \u201cappropriate time\u201d. The Tribunal clarified shortly thereafter that \u201c[n]o rulings have been made as to the capacity of [CMNC] to rely, or the extent of any reliance, upon the objected material\u201d.', '69\\u2003On the same day, Jaguar formally filed its objection to CMNC\u2019s application. Jaguar noted that CMNC had not given it or the Tribunal any forewarning of its intention to file the witness statements, notwithstanding that the filing of those statements was purportedly done in response to Jaguar\u2019s 5 June 2015 disclosure, and therefore would have been within CMNC\u2019s contemplation shortly after that date. Jaguar noted the \u201cextreme and irreparable\u201d prejudice it would suffer if CMNC were permitted to introduce this \u201cvoluminous\u201d new evidence on the eve of the main evidentiary hearing.', '70\\u2003By TC No 230 dated 3 July 2015, the Tribunal declined to grant CMNC leave to rely upon the Aspinall Report:', '71\\u2003In TC No 230, the Tribunal did not make any ruling in relation to the admissibility of the witness statements and the Gurnham Responsive Report. The Tribunal considered it premature to make any ruling in relation to the admissibility of the witness statements and the Gurnham Responsive Report. However, in respect of the latter two categories of evidence, the Tribunal\u2019s stance should be set out in full:', '72\\u2003The main evidentiary hearing of the Arbitration was held in Dublin from 6 July 2015 to 21 July 2015. Meanwhile, the Project works were completed on 26 July 2015.', '73\\u2003On 25 November 2015, the Tribunal rendered its award (\u201cthe Award\u201d), in which it unanimously found that Jaguar Energy had validly terminated the EPC Contract for default by CMNC. The Tribunal substantially allowed Jaguar\u2019s claims, pertinently, the ETC Claim.', '74\\u2003On 25 February 2016, CMNC commenced Originating Summons No 185 of 2016, seeking to set aside the Award on three grounds:', '(a)\\u2003The Due Process Ground: The Award was obtained in breach of Art 34(2)(a)(ii) of the Model Law and s 24(b) of the International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe IAA\u201d), because (i) the AEO Regime deprived CMNC of a reasonable opportunity to present its case, and (ii) the Tribunal failed to consider CMNC\u2019s arguments in relation to the DPSA.', '(b)\\u2003Defective Arbitral Procedure Ground: The Award was obtained in breach of Art 34(2)(a)(iv) of the Model Law and the parties\u2019 agreement to arbitrate, because (i) the Tribunal breached Art 18 of the Model Law in failing to treat the parties equally and to ensure that CMNC was given a full opportunity of presenting its case; and\/or (ii) Jaguar breached its obligation to arbitrate in good faith, and the Tribunal failed to restrain Jaguar from doing so.', '(c)\\u2003Public Policy and Corruption Ground: The Award was liable to be set aside as being contrary to public policy under (i) Art 34(2)(b)(ii) of the Model Law on the basis that Jaguar had engaged in \u201cguerrilla tactics\u201d in the Arbitration, such as, for example, Jaguar\u2019s seizure of CMNC\u2019s documents by securing the eviction of CMNC\u2019s employees from the site (see [11] above), and\/or (ii) Art 34(2)(b)(ii) of the Model Law and s 24(a) of the IAA, because the Tribunal failed to investigate allegations of corruption and fraud, and\/or the Award was induced or affected by corruption.'"}
{"casename":"2020_SGCA_120","fact":"'3\\u2003In the morning of 8 February 2017, Pragas Krissamy (\u201cPragas\u201d) and Tamilselvam a\/l Yagasvranan (\u201cTamil\u201d) passed Imran Bin Mohd Arip (\u201cImran\u201d) a white plastic bag (\u201cthe white plastic bag\u201d) with two packets containing 894.2g of granular\/powdery substance (\u201cthe Drugs\u201d). This was subsequently analysed and found to contain not less than 19.42g of diamorphine (hereinafter referred to by its street name \u201cheroin\u201d).

The Judge found, inter alia, that Imran and Tamil had actual knowledge of the nature of the Drugs while Pragas was wilfully blind to the same.

Tamil and Pragas walked towards Block 518 Jurong West Street 52 (\u201cBlock 518\u201d), with Pragas carrying a black haversack. Before Tamil entered the lift at Block 518, Tamil passed Pragas a handphone (GD at [7]).', '8\\u2003At about 7.09am, Tamil came out of the lift at the fourth floor of Block 518. He met Imran, who came out of #04-139 of Block 518 (\u201cthe Unit\u201d). Tamil called Pragas, who answered using the handphone.

His appeal to this court in CA\/CCA 38\/2015 (\u201cCCA 38\/2015\u201d) was ultimately dismissed on 18 October 2018.', '3\\u2003Following the final imposition of the death sentence after the disposal of any appeal by the Court of Appeal, a number of legally prescribed steps must be taken before the death sentence can be carried out. For the purposes of the present discussion, it is useful for us to outline them briefly.', '(a)\\u2003Under Art 22P(2) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1985 Rev Ed, 1999 Reprint) (\u201cthe Constitution\u201d), the trial judge and the presiding judge of the Court of Appeal that dealt with the case must furnish reports to the President, who will forward them to the Attorney-General (\u201cthe AG\u201d). The AG provides his opinion on them, and the reports and the AG\u2019s opinion are sent to the Cabinet so that it may advise the President on the exercise of the clemency power under Art 22P(1).', '(b)\\u2003Under s 313(e) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (\u201cCPC\u201d), a more comprehensive set of documents relating to the case must also be forwarded to the Minister by the presiding judge of the Court of Appeal that dealt with the case.', '(c)\\u2003Under Art 22P(1) of the Constitution, the Cabinet is to consider whether to advise the President to grant clemency, and the President is obliged to act in accordance with the Cabinet\u2019s advice (see Yong Vui Kong v Attorney-General [2011] 2 SLR 1189 (\u201cYong Vui Kong (Clemency)\u201d) at [82] and [180]).', '(d)\\u2003If clemency is not granted, then under s 313(f) of the CPC, the President is to transmit to the Court of Appeal an order stating the time and place of execution. Section 313(f) stipulates that this must be done \u201cin accordance with the Constitution\u201d. By virtue of Art 21(1) of the Constitution, this means that the President must act in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet (or a Minister acting under the general authority of the Cabinet) when setting the time and place of execution.', '(e)\\u2003Under s 313(g) of the CPC, upon receiving the President\u2019s order under s 313(f) the Court of Appeal will cause a warrant to be issued under the seal of the Supreme Court setting out the prescribed time and place of execution. The warrant is directed to the Commissioner of Prisons who must then carry out the execution (s 313(i) of the CPC).', '(f)\\u2003Under s 313(h) of the CPC, the President may order a respite of the execution before it is carried out, and subsequently appoint some other time or place for the execution. The President\u2019s power to order a respite of the execution of any sentence is set out in Art 22P(1)(b) of the Constitution, and this power must therefore also be exercised in accordance with the Cabinet\u2019s advice.', '4\\u2003The events described above unfolded in the present case as follows.', '5\\u2003The appellant filed the application on 16 September 2020 seeking leave to apply for a prohibiting order against the Singapore Prison Service (\u201cthe SPS\u201d) in order to stay his execution. The application was supported by an affidavit filed by the appellant\u2019s counsel, Mr Ravi s\/o Madasamy (\u201cMr Ravi\u201d), on the appellant\u2019s behalf (\u201cMr Ravi\u2019s supporting affidavit\u201d).', '6\\u2003The application was brought on two grounds. Under the clemency ground, the appellant contended that his execution would be in breach of Art 22P and\/or Art 9 of the Constitution, on the basis that the clemency power under Art 22P had been extinguished owing to disuse. In Mr Ravi\u2019s supporting affidavit, it was asserted that clemency had not been granted in any capital case since 1998 despite there having been many executions, and that this suggested that there was a blanket policy by the Cabinet of disregarding clemency petitions in all drug-related cases. On this basis, it was submitted that the appellant\u2019s case received no individual consideration. Mr Ravi\u2019s supporting affidavit further argued that the disuse of the clemency power in drug-related cases since 1998 resulted in the clemency power being \u201cwholly extinguished\u201d. For this, he relied on the decision of the Federal Court of Australia in Ruddock v Vadarlis (2001) 110 FCR 491 (\u201cRuddock\u201d). The foregoing arguments were said to have two implications: first, the failure to consider the appellant\u2019s clemency petition individually amounted to a breach of natural justice contrary to Art 9(1) of the Constitution (\u201cArt 9(1)\u201d), and second, the extinction by disuse of the clemency power, which was essential in mitigating the harshness of the death penalty, violated his right to life under Art 9(1).', '7\\u2003Under the scheduling ground, the appellant contended that the fixing of the date of his execution violated his right to equality under Art 12 of the Constitution (\u201cArt 12\u201d). Mr Ravi\u2019s supporting affidavit claimed that no executions had been carried out to date in 2020, and that there were other prisoners awaiting capital punishment who had been sentenced to death prior to the appellant. He further alleged that the reason the appellant had been scheduled for execution ahead of other such prisoners was because of a decision by the State not to execute foreigners while border restrictions owing to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) were in place, as this prevented their family members from entering Singapore and the repatriation of their remains. The appellant advanced two arguments under this ground:', '(a)\\u2003First, he argued that the order of execution of prisoners should follow the order in which they were sentenced to death. The failure to follow this order deprived the appellant of his right to a fair trial, as he would thereby be deprived of time within which he might have been able to adduce new evidence to seek to have his conviction reopened by the court (\u201cthe new evidence argument\u201d).', '(b)\\u2003Second, the appellant argued that the scheduling of the executions of Singaporeans ahead of those of foreigners was an act of \u201cdiscrimination based on expediency\u201d that violated his right to equal protection under Art 12(1) of the Constitution (\u201cArt 12(1)\u201d) (\u201cthe discrimination argument\u201d). He further argued that such discrimination based on nationality was expressly prohibited by Art 12(2).', '8\\u2003At the same time, the appellant also applied for leave under s 394H of the CPC to make a review application under s 394J of the CPC, seeking to reopen his concluded appeal in CCA 38\/2015 on the basis that relevant evidence had not been adduced. The appellant was granted leave, and we heard his review application together with the present appeal on 22 September 2020. On 16 October 2020, we issued our judgment, Syed Suhail bin Syed Zin v Public Prosecutor [2020] SGCA 101, dismissing the review application. The issues in the review application have no bearing on the present appeal, and we need say nothing further about them.'"}

As the result of motion 10.1 had not yet been determined, it was not known whether the 13th MC would consist of 11 or 13 members and the attendees of the AGM were told to vote for 13 candidates. 14', '15\\u2003Once again, an unidentified speaker raised a concern about what would happen if the motion could not be resolved in time.

For motion 10.1, he declared that the AGM had decided to have 11 members in the 13th MC. 18', 'To save time, the AGM also proceeded to pass resolutions for motions 10.3 and 10.4 which concerned the powers of the 13th MC. 19', '17\\u2003At this point, a subsidiary proprietor asked whether they would vote on other resolutions after the results were announced.

Mr Chan suggested holding the run-off election at the adjourned meeting. This was met with suggestions for a re-count and for the run-off election to be held that night. Mr Chan replied that he had no objections to a re-count but that it should not be done at that meeting as the AGM had exceeded 8pm already.

Mr Ng helped her run the firm and her brother, Randy Kor, who was in the same business referred certain cleaning contracts to YFX. By May 2011, YFX was providing cleaning services to nine developments. We recognise that legally YFX and Ms Kor are not separate entities since YFX is a sole-proprietorship firm and not an incorporated company but, for clarity, we will when dealing with Ms Kor\u2019s personal business refer to it by the acronym YFX. Of the nine contracts YFX had just before AFPL was formed, four were in respect of developments belonging to companies owned by Mr Tee and his friend and business partner, Mr Ching Chiat Kwong (\u201cMr Ching\u201d).', '7\\u2003Mr Tee is a businessman involved in property development. He and Mr Ng are first cousins and, according to Mr Tee, were close while they were growing up and remained in regular contact as adults. Mr Ching is the Chief Executive Officer of Oxley Holdings Ltd (\u201cOHL\u201d). He is also the sole owner of Oxley Construction Pte Ltd (\u201cOCPL\u201d).

No shareholders\u2019 agreement was entered into and although both men agreed they had had an informal understanding prior to the incorporation of AFPL, subsequently the content of that informal understanding was in dispute. We expand upon their disagreement later in this judgment at [41] et seq. Mr Ng and Mr Tee were directors of AFPL at its incorporation. Although Mr Tee claimed that he resigned as a director in 2012 at Mr Ng\u2019s request, records from the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (\u201cACRA\u201d) showed that his resignation as director took effect on the date of AFPL\u2019s incorporation.', '9\\u2003AFPL had an initial share capital of $100,000 and since incorporation Mr Ng and Mr Tee have each held 50,000 shares in the company, making them equal shareholders at all times. Mr Ng did not contribute any capital to AFPL, however. Instead, Mr Ching and Mr Tee each contributed $50,000 to AFPL\u2019s initial paid-up capital. According to Mr Tee, half of his shares (viz, 25% of the shares in AFPL) were held on trust for Mr Ching.', '10\\u2003It was not disputed that Mr Ng effectively ran AFPL from its inception or that it was awarded several cleaning contracts by the Oxley businesses. Ms Kor assisted Mr Ng by performing administrative and accounting work for AFPL (for which she was paid a salary) while continuing to run YFX. She was also appointed the company secretary of APFL.', '11\\u2003An OCPL employee, Mr Jason Wang (\u201cMr Wang\u201d), was in charge of AFPL\u2019s accounts. After AFPL\u2019s incorporation, YFX transferred funds to AFPL pursuant to monthly \u201cmanagement fee\u201d invoices bearing dates between 15 June 2011 and 15 December 2012. Some sales revenue was also transferred from YFX to AFPL from January 2013 to May 2013. During this period, YFX referred and transferred employees and business opportunities to AFPL.', '12\\u2003By Mr Tee\u2019s account, the fund transfers from YFX were part of the informal understanding between him and Mr Ng that YFX would cease operations after AFPL was incorporated. However, Mr Ng had control of both AFPL and YFX at the material time. Mr Ng and Ms Kor claimed that these fund transfers were made despite Ms Kor\u2019s objections, in order to ameliorate AFPL\u2019s weak financial position at a time when Mr Tee was unwilling to provide additional capital to AFPL.', '13\\u2003Mr Tee was initially a signatory of AFPL\u2019s bank account. He withdrew as signatory in 2012 and was reinstated in March 2015. He claimed to have discovered various lapses in AFPL\u2019s management after his reinstatement, including AFPL\u2019s payment of \u201cservice fees\u201d to YFX and the deployment of AFPL\u2019s employees to YFX\u2019s projects. According to Mr Ng, the \u201cservice fee\u201d payments covered the salaries of YFX employees who were subcontracted to AFPL to address AFPL\u2019s shortage in manpower.', '14\\u2003Around 2016, Mr Tee and Mr Ching grew concerned about Mr Ng\u2019s management of AFPL and decided that AFPL\u2019s operations had to be restructured. Mr Tee, Mr Ching and Mr Ng agreed in March 2016 that: (a) the use of AFPL\u2019s banking facilities had to receive Mr Tee\u2019s prior approval; (b) the salaries of AFPL\u2019s employees were to be paid via cheque instead of cash; and (c) AFPL was to hire Mr Ho Bok Cheok, who had previously worked with Mr Ching, as an operations manager.', '15\\u2003The relationship between Mr Ng and Mr Tee broke down in spite of the restructuring efforts. In May 2016, Mr Ching began mediating share buyout discussions with Mr Ng on Mr Tee\u2019s behalf, but no deal was finalised. Mr Tee also engaged a private investigator and obtained evidence that Mr Ng had deployed AFPL\u2019s employees, equipment and resources for YFX\u2019s benefit. Mr Ng claimed that Mr Ching and Mr Tee arranged for AFPL\u2019s cleaning contracts with third parties to be terminated from May to June 2016. On 9 June 2016, Mr Ng removed Mr Tee as a signatory of AFPL\u2019s bank account.', '16\\u2003It was not disputed that five contracts to clean the following premises were diverted from AFPL to YFX from April 2016 to July 2016:', '(a)\\u2003No 10 Tebing Lane @ Punggol Pte Ltd (\u201cNo 10 Tebing Lane contract\u201d);', '(b)\\u2003Sports Hub @ Punggol Pte Ltd (\u201cSports Hub contract\u201d);', '(c)\\u200360 Punggol East @ Par Golf Resources Pte Ltd (\u201cPar Golf contract\u201d);', '(d)\\u2003223 @ Mountbatten Edge Pte Ltd (\u201cMountbatten contract\u201d); and', '(e)\\u2003Edward Boustead Centre @ Boustead Services Pte Ltd (\u201cBoustead contract\u201d).', 'We refer to the contracts at [16(a)]\u2013[16(c)] as the \u201cPunggol contracts\u201d.

OCPL was to award its cleaning contracts to AFPL, and AFPL was to prioritise serving OCPL and sites related to it.

{"casename":"2020_SGCA_17","fact":"'3\\u2003The facts have been set out in detail in the Contempt Judgment. We set out only those facts that are necessary to come to our decision.', '4\\u2003The appellant was the administrator of the estates of his father (\u201cthe Father\u2019s Estate\u201d) and of his mother (\u201cthe Mother\u2019s Estate\u201d). Due to this appointment, he had been involved in various disputes with his sister, Ms Ong Wui Soon (\u201cthe Sister\u201d), in Suit No 385 of 2011 (\u201cSuit 385\u201d) concerning the Father\u2019s Estate. These disputes were adjudicated by Woo J, who found in favour of the appellant in relation to the most valuable assets in the Father\u2019s Estate. Woo J also held, however, that the appellant had failed to give a proper account of the assets of the Father\u2019s Estate. He thus ordered an inquiry to determine the net total value of the Father\u2019s Estate for distribution to the beneficiaries (\u201cthe Inquiry\u201d). Woo J\u2019s grounds of decision can be found in Ong Wui Soon v Ong Wui Teck [2013] 1 SLR 733 (\u201cthe 2012 Judgment\u201d). No appeal was filed against the 2012 Judgment. On 3 March 2014, Woo J fixed costs of Suit 385 at $10,000 in favour of the Sister (\u201cthe Suit 385 Costs Order\u201d).', '5\\u2003The Inquiry was conducted by an Assistant Registrar (\u201cthe AR\u201d). The AR found that the Father\u2019s Estate had a positive value of $15,756 and ordered the appellant to pay the Sister her one-twelfth share of the Father\u2019s Estate and her costs of the Inquiry. The appellant was granted an extension of time to appeal out of time against the AR\u2019s decision in the Inquiry and filed his appeal (\u201cRA 54\u201d). The Sister in turn appealed against the grant of an extension of time to the appellant (\u201cRA 72\u201d). We shall hereafter refer to RA 54 and RA 72 collectively as \u201cthe Registrar\u2019s Appeals\u201d.', '6\\u2003The Registrar\u2019s Appeals came on for hearing together before a Judicial Commissioner (\u201cthe JC\u201d). At the hearing, counsel for the Sister submitted that both appeals should be heard before Woo J as he was more familiar with the matter. The appellant did not object and the Registrar\u2019s Appeals were then adjourned to be heard before Woo J. In May 2014, Woo J heard the Registrar\u2019s Appeals. He held that the appellant should not have been granted an extension of time. RA 72 was, therefore, allowed while RA 54, the appellant\u2019s appeal against the outcome of the Inquiry, was dismissed. Woo J, however, changed the costs\u2019 order made by the AR in respect of the Inquiry from costs to be taxed to fixed costs of $400. This part of the decision was in the appellant\u2019s favour. The grounds of this decision can be found in Ong Wui Swoon v Ong Wui Teck and another matter [2014] SGHC 157 (\u201cthe 2014 GD\u201d).', '7\\u2003The appellant appealed against the findings in the 2014 GD but both his appeals were struck out by this Court. This meant that the appellant could no longer dispute the findings made in the Inquiry. The appellant remained deeply unhappy at the outcome of the Inquiry as he could not accept the basis on which the Father\u2019s Estate had been found to have a positive value.', '8\\u2003In 2013, the Sister sought a revocation of the appellant\u2019s appointment as the executor of the Mother\u2019s Estate. The Sister\u2019s application in the District Court was dismissed, and she appealed to the High Court by District Court Appeal No 21 of 2015 (\u201cDCA 21\u201d). The appellant then filed Originating Summons No 11 of 2016 (\u201cOS 11\u201d) to, inter alia, compel the Sister to apply for an extension of time to serve the appeal documents in DCA 21 on him.', '9\\u2003The appellant and the Sister\u2019s counsel attended a pre-trial conference in the High Court on 26 January 2016 (\u201cthe PTC\u201d).

Two days later, the appellant sent a letter to the Chief Justice of Singapore, alleging that Woo J\u2019s \u201cindependence is compromised\u201d. On 22 February 2016, the appellant filed OS 165 seeking an order that Woo J be recused. On 4 March 2016, Woo J heard OS 165 and, while he found that the appellant\u2019s allegations of bias were baseless, he recused himself as he intended to lodge a formal complaint against the appellant for contempt. Woo J\u2019s reasoning can be found in Ong Wui Teck v Ong Wui Swoon [2016] 2 SLR 1067 (\u201cthe Recusal GD\u201d).', '10\\u2003In May 2016, the respondent informed the appellant that the Allegations made in the OS 165 Affidavits were in contempt of court. The respondent requested that the appellant withdraw the Allegations and apologise to both Woo J and the Supreme Court. The appellant refused to do so. After a preliminary leave application was heard and allowed, the respondent applied for an order of committal against the appellant under O 52 r 2(2) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed). As the focus of these appeals is on whether the Allegations constitute fair criticism made in good faith, it is necessary for us to set them out in some detail. The Allegations can be grouped into five categories.', '11\\u2003First, allegations of extreme bias:', '(a)\\u2003\u201cthere is extreme biasness [sic] in the way Woo J had conducted the trial of [the Father\u2019s Estate]\u201d;', '(b)\\u2003\u201calthough it was brought up to Woo J in [Suit 385], he vehemently refused to recognise the material fact that the opposing party had obstructed the accounting of the estate\u201d;', '(c)\\u2003Woo J \u201cwas steering towards a biased finding of failure to give proper account in any event\u201d and \u201c[e]ither \u2026 failed to recognise \u2026 relevant material evidence \u2026 or \u2026 biasedly [sic] chose to ignore it\u201d.

Woo J \u201cwould not bring an impartial mind to the issues relating to his prior findings [in the Father\u2019s Estate Proceedings], thereby making fair hearings [in the Mother\u2019s Estate actions] unattainable\u201d;', '(g)\\u2003\u201cWoo J has a vested interest to uphold his rulings in [Suit 385], even though they are plainly wrong against the weight of the evidence, which he biasedly refuse [sic] to acknowledge\u201d;', '(h)\\u2003\u201cWoo J had conducted himself [such] that a high probability arises of a bias inconsistent with the fair performance of his duties\u201d. \u201cThere is a miscarriage of justice in [Woo J\u2019s] conduct of the action on [the Father\u2019s Estate] and given [Woo J\u2019s] vested interest to uphold his ruling, he would, in all likelihood, rule to [the appellant\u2019s] detriment and to the detriment of [the Mother\u2019s Estate]\u201d;', '(i)\\u2003\u201cWoo J, in this instance, has morphed from a judge into a supernumery [sic] opposing lawyer.\u201d He cannot \u201cfully remove all trace of odour from the air of impartiality.

The recital to the Order of Court No 4561 of 2014 in RA 54 (\u201cthe Order of Court\u201d) erroneously identified the Sister as the appellant in the appeal.

{"casename":"2020_SGCA_18","fact":"'2\\u2003Tan Chua Joo (\u201cthe Deceased\u201d) was the husband of the appellant (\u201cToh\u201d). In 2008, Toh filed for divorce.

The Deceased and Toh agreed on all ancillary matters and the consent orders relating to all these were set out in the interim judgment accordingly. In particular, the Deceased and Toh agreed to have their matrimonial flat transferred to Toh and their investment private property known as 6, Kitchener Link #24-12 Citysquare Residences Singapore 207227 (\u201cthe apartment\u201d) transferred to the Deceased upon payment by him of a sum in cash to Toh.', '3\\u2003The relevant terms of the interim judgment are set out below (with paragraph indentations added for easy reading).

However, they disagreed about the legal status of the apartment. Tao\u2019s position was that clause 3(b) severed the joint tenancy and the Deceased had become the sole owner of the apartment. This meant that the apartment was to be distributed according to the law of intestate succession upon his death (ie, 50% to Tao as the Deceased\u2019s wife and 25% each to TYT and TYX as the Deceased\u2019s children from his first marriage). TYT\u2019s and TYX\u2019s position, which was also Toh\u2019s position on appeal before us, was that clause 3(b) did not sever the joint tenancy and it followed that Toh became the sole owner of the apartment under the right of survivorship.', '6\\u2003The Family Court took the view that it lacked jurisdiction to determine the ownership of the apartment as the dispute involved a third party (Toh) claiming an interest in the apartment. Tao then took out Originating Summons No 431 of 2019 (\u201cOS 431\u201d), from which this appeal originates, against Toh, TYT and TYX. In OS 431, Tao sought a declaration that clause 3(b) had the effect of severing the joint tenancy in the apartment between Toh and the Deceased and also asked that all three defendants pay damages to be assessed.', '7\\u2003The only issue in OS 431 was whether clause 3(b) severed the joint tenancy where the condition of paying the sum of $60,000 in cash had not been complied with. The High Court judge (\u201cthe Judge\u201d) held that it did and found in favour of Tao. Only Toh appealed.'"}

On 6 February 2014, at about 6.10pm, a party of officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (\u201cCNB\u201d) was despatched to conduct surveillance in the vicinity of Choa Chu Kang Way on Farid who was expected to be using a car bearing registration number SJK 5768J (\u201cthe Car\u201d). The CNB officers were also told to look out for a Malaysian-registered bus which was suspected to be carrying a consignment of drugs.', '6\\u2003At about 8.35pm, a Malaysian-registered bus bearing registration number JHD 5635 (\u201cthe Bus\u201d) was seen parked beside the multi-storey car park at Block 610A, Choa Chu Kang Way.', '7\\u2003At about 9.20pm, the Car, whose driver was later identified as Farid, was seen travelling along Choa Chu Kang Way and making a U-turn. Shortly thereafter, the Car stopped in front of the Bus. A male Indian, later identified as Ranjit, alighted from the Bus. Ranjit was observed to be carrying a white plastic bag in one hand. Ranjit walked towards the Car. Through the open window at the front passenger side of the Car, Ranjit placed the said plastic bag on the front passenger seat. Farid then passed Ranjit a red and yellow package. Ranjit walked back to the Bus and boarded it. Thereafter, both of them went their separate ways in their respective vehicles.', '8\\u2003The Car and the Bus were followed separately by two groups of CNB officers. At about 9.25pm, the CNB officers intercepted the Car at the slip road of Choa Chu Kang North 6 and Choa Chu Kang Drive, beside Yew Tee MRT station and placed Farid under arrest. At about 10.10pm, the CNB officers intercepted the Bus along Seletar Expressway and arrested Ranjit. Inside the Bus, the CNB officers found two envelopes under the driver\u2019s seat containing $4,050 and $1,470 in cash.', '9\\u2003Inside the Car, a white and black plastic bag with the word \u201cROBINSONS\u201d was recovered (\u201cthe Robinsons Bag\u201d). The Robinsons Bag contained a blue plastic bag containing another blue plastic bag containing three bundles wrapped in newspapers. One of the bundles contained one plastic packet containing a brownish granular\/powdery substance. The other two bundles each contained two plastic packets containing a brownish granular\/powdery substance. In total therefore, there were five such plastic packets.', '10\\u2003The five plastic packets containing the brownish granular\/powdery substance were sent to the Health Sciences Authority (\u201cHSA\u201d) for analysis. The HSA found that the five packets collectively contained not less than 1,359.9g of granular\/powdery substances which contained not less than 35.21g of diamorphine (\u201cthe drugs\u201d). 1', '11\\u2003After Farid\u2019s arrest, the CNB officers recorded his statement and then escorted him to his flat in Choa Chu Kang Street 52 which was his residential address on record. They did not find anything incriminating in his flat. Upon further questioning about whether there was anything else in Farid\u2019s unit at the Regent Grove Condominium (\u201cthe Unit\u201d), Farid answered in English \u201cGot balance. About half.\u201d This was recorded by a CNB officer. Farid was then escorted to the Unit. The CNB officers entered the Unit using the combination lock number given by Farid and his keys. Inside the Unit, Farid told the CNB officers where he kept the \u201cbalance\u201d packet. Among other things, numerous empty plastic packets, two electronic weighing scales and a total of $13,888 in cash were found and seized.', '12\\u2003Farid faced three charges under the MDA. The Prosecution stood down two of the charges at the start of the trial in the High Court and proceeded with the first charge, which was a capital charge. The first charge under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the MDA was as follows: 2', '13\\u2003Ranjit faced one charge under s 5(1)(a) of the MDA.

In those two weeks, he had collected three drug consignments, inclusive of the consignment on the day of his arrest (the Robinsons Bag).

However, he had not received any payments from Abang at the time of his arrest because he had not discussed payment terms with Abang yet. 15', '(c)\\u2003Farid admitted that the empty plastic packets and two electronic weighing scales found in the Unit belonged to him and were used by him to weigh and pack the heroin that he collected on Abang\u2019s instructions. 16', 'With one of the weighing scales found in the Unit, Farid would weigh the heroin so as to pack it into half or one-pound orders.

On 5 February 2014, Abang contacted him and instructed him to pack the heroin into one one-pound packet and two half-pound packets. After doing so, he received instructions from Abang to pass one half-pound packet and one one-pound packet to his customers at Yio Chu Kang Stadium and at Bedok Stadium respectively. 19', 'After he made those deliveries, Abang telephoned him and asked him to collect and to find buyers for a consignment of \u201cAir Batu\u201d (which was methamphetamine) as the original customer was uncontactable. Farid agreed. Farid then collected the Air Batu from the same Chinese woman.

He explained that sometime in May 2013, he took a loan of RM6,000 from loan sharks to help one of his friends. At the start of August 2013, he started facing financial problems with his business and he had to sell some of his buses to sustain it. Eventually, he was unable to maintain the liquidity necessary to keep his business going. Siva then offered him a job to deliver makan into Singapore. He said that Siva did not know what these items were because they were all pre-packed. The frequency of his deliveries of makan increased when Farid started to place orders. 34', '(c)\\u2003Whenever Ranjit was unable to make a delivery for Siva, he would ask a woman known as \u201cPerl\u201d to make the delivery instead.

Perl was to change the money into a different currency, keep RM1,000 for herself as payment for accepting the job and deposit the remainder into Ranjit\u2019s account.

{"casename":"2020_SGCA_2","fact":"'4\\u2003The Respondent was 32 years old at the material time. He had been working at the Home since 2010, initially as a housekeeping attendant. After suffering a back injury in 2013, the Respondent stopped working in that capacity, and instead undertook maintenance and cleaning duties as a maintenance technician for the Home. Those were his duties at the time of the alleged incident on 26 November 2016.', '5\\u2003The Victim was 55 years old at the material time. She had suffered a series of strokes some years earlier, which limited her mobility on the left side of her body and impeded her speech. As a result of those strokes, the Victim displayed easily-changing moods, alternating between crying and giggling. She was generally unable to raise her voice, and would make high-pitched cries of a soft to moderate volume. Due to her cognitive disabilities, the Victim was certified unfit to testify at the trial.', '6\\u2003The Victim occupied Bed 7 of a room that was exclusively for female residents (\u201cthe Room\u201d). The Room was located on one of the upper levels of the Home and contained 12 beds. It was partially divided by a wall into an inner section and an outer section. The Victim was bed-bound, and her bed was located at the far corner of the inner section of the Room next to the windows. For ease of reference, a repurposed sketch of the Room is set out at Annex A to this judgment.', '7\\u2003The Prosecution\u2019s case at the trial and in the appeal depended principally on the testimony of Nurse MJ, who had been working at the Home since April 2016. The Victim was one of the residents under Nurse MJ\u2019s nursing care.', '8\\u2003On 26 November 2016, the Home was hosting a community involvement programme on the ground floor. The programme was scheduled to last from 2.00pm to 4.00pm. An administrative officer of the Home, Mdm RM, testified that all of the Home\u2019s staff, including its maintenance staff, would have been made aware of the programme through the noticeboards. Mdm RM further testified that the Respondent was the only maintenance staffer on duty that day. At around 1.00pm, the Respondent assisted Mdm RM in setting up audio-visual equipment for the programme.', '9\\u2003Mr ST, the director of the Home, testified that five residents in the Room (including the Victim) remained in their beds during the community involvement programme. They did not join in the programme because they were asocial, required assistance in movement, or were suffering from mental disabilities that rendered them unable to mingle with members of the public.', '10\\u2003Dr S, who was the resident physician of the Home, opined that the other four residents who were present in the Room at the material time had dementia, amnesia, or were otherwise incapable of communicating a narrative. In his view, none of them were mentally capable of testifying.', '11\\u2003Nurse MJ testified that she started her shift at 7.00am on 26 November 2016. At around 3.41pm, she proceeded on her rounds to the Room.', '12\\u2003Nurse MJ noticed that the curtains around the beds in the inner section of the Room were fully drawn, except for the curtains around the Victim\u2019s bed (Bed 7), which were half-drawn. She found this odd as the curtains were usually only drawn when the residents\u2019 diapers were being changed. However, none of the residents in the Room was having her diaper changed at that time. In fact, several of the residents were not even occupying their beds, as they were either at the dining hall or at the community involvement programme. Aside from the Victim, the only other resident present in the inner section of the Room was Mdm MG in Bed 6, located across from the Victim.', '13\\u2003Nurse MJ walked towards Mdm MG to check on her. As she was drawing open the curtains to Bed 6, she heard a crying sound emanating from Bed 7. Nurse MJ recognised this sound as one that the Victim would make whenever she was being moved or was in pain.', '14\\u2003When Nurse MJ turned, she saw that the curtains to Bed 7 were half-closed. She testified that she had a full view of Bed 7 because the curtains were not drawn across the bed\u2019s width and she was only about one-and-a-half arm\u2019s lengths away. She saw the Respondent on the bed with his knees astride the Victim. The Respondent\u2019s pants were lowered and Nurse MJ saw his exposed buttocks. The Victim\u2019s pants were also lowered and the left side of her diaper was open.', '15\\u2003Nurse MJ was shocked. She testified that \u201c[the Respondent\u2019s] groin area and [the Victim\u2019s] groin area w[ere] together\u201d, and she thought \u201cit was something to do with sex and it was wrong\u201d. She had a half-view of the Respondent\u2019s face and recognised him as an employee of the Home. The Victim continued to make the crying sound. Nurse MJ observed the scene for about five seconds before leaving. She did not attempt to stop the Respondent because she was frightened.', '16\\u2003Nurse MJ was not aware if the Respondent had noticed her. She did not know why the Respondent had entered the Room. It was the Home\u2019s policy that male staffers had to be escorted by a female staffer when entering a room occupied exclusively by female residents.', '17\\u2003The timing of the events recounted by Nurse MJ was consistent with what was recorded on the close-circuit television (\u201cCCTV\u201d) situated at the entrance to the Room. The CCTV footage showed that Nurse MJ entered the Room at 3.41.32pm and remained there for a total of 11 seconds.', 'Nurse DS\u2019s testimony', '18\\u2003Nurse MJ immediately headed to the dining hall on the same level of the Home and called out to a male nursing aide, Nurse DS, who subsequently testified that Nurse MJ\u2019s tone and appearance were not normal and that she sounded as if there was an emergency. On the first two times Nurse MJ called to him, Nurse DS told her to wait as he was tending to a patient, but on the third time, she shouted at him and asked him to \u201c[p]lease go and see what [the Respondent] is doing on [the Victim\u2019s] bed\u201d.', '19\\u2003The CCTV footage showed that about a minute and 40 seconds after Nurse MJ left the Room, Nurse DS entered. Nurse DS saw that the curtains around Bed 8 were fully drawn, which he too found strange as that would only be done when the residents\u2019 diapers were being changed. Standing on tiptoe, Nurse DS was able to peer through the upper netting portion of the curtains around Bed 8 to get a view of Bed 7. He saw the Respondent kneeling on the floor in the space between Bed 7 and Bed 8 and apparently looking at his mobile phone. The curtains around Bed 7 were fully open, and Nurse DS observed that the Victim was sleeping on the bed. She appeared normal and there were no sounds coming from her.', '20\\u2003The Respondent claimed that sometime around lunchtime on 26 November 2016, one of the Room\u2019s residents, Mdm JP, asked him to repair her portable television as he had done on previous occasions. At around 3.30pm, the Respondent remembered Mdm JP\u2019s request and decided to attend to it in the Room. He claimed not to have known of the Home\u2019s policy forbidding male staffers from entering any room occupied exclusively by female residents without being accompanied by a female staffer.', '21\\u2003The Respondent headed to Mdm JP\u2019s bed, Bed 8, which was adjacent to the Victim\u2019s bed, Bed 7. Mdm JP was not present at that time. The Respondent knelt on the floor between Bed 7 and Bed 8, and changed the fuse for Mdm JP\u2019s portable television. He switched on the power for the television and was adjusting the channels when he heard a sound from Bed 7, which sounded as though \u201csomeone was tapping on the [railing] of the bed\u201d.', '22\\u2003The Respondent claimed to have turned and seen the Victim\u2019s head touching the side railing of her bed. He noticed that her pillow was displaced. He observed tears flowing from the Victim\u2019s eyes and thought the Victim must be in pain as her head was bent towards the railing. There was another round pillow to the side of the Victim. The Respondent claimed to have placed his left knee between the bars of the side railing to reach for the round pillow. No part of his body touched the Victim while he was reaching for the round pillow. He placed the round pillow under the Victim\u2019s head. The Victim then smiled a little.', '23\\u2003As the Respondent returned to adjusting the channels on Mdm JP\u2019s portable television, he noticed some \u201cfood greens\u201d consisting of rice grains and crushed biscuits on Mdm JP\u2019s bed. He proceeded to the toilet to dispose of those items. He then returned to the Room and placed Mdm JP\u2019s television on her bedside table. At about the time he replaced the television, a friend of Mdm JP, Ms SBR, came by Bed 8 to retrieve Mdm JP\u2019s spectacles for her. The Respondent then left the Room. He had not noticed Nurse MJ or Nurse DS entering the Room.', '24\\u2003Nurse MJ left work at the end of her shift. She then telephoned a senior staff nurse, SSN JS, because she remained troubled by what she had seen despite Nurse DS having told her that he had seen nothing amiss. SSN JS met Nurse MJ to discuss the incident, and SSN JS then called Mr ST. The Victim was not sent for an immediate medical examination. Instead, Mr ST interviewed the Victim on the following day (27 November 2016), and viewed the CCTV footage on 28 November 2016. The matter was then escalated to management.', '25\\u2003On 23 January 2017, a police report was lodged against the Respondent, who was arrested on the same day.', '26\\u2003The Respondent was interviewed on 26 January 2017 by Assistant Superintendent Razali bin Razak (\u201cASP Razali\u201d) under s 22 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe CPC\u201d). In contrast to his oral testimony at the trial that he had placed only his left knee on Bed 7 while he was reaching for the Victim\u2019s round pillow, the Respondent claimed in his statement to ASP Razali on 26 January 2017 (the \u201cFirst Statement\u201d) that \u201c[a]s the bed was too high and difficult for [him] to retrieve the \u2026 pillow\u201d, he had \u201cplaced both [his] knees at the left side of the bed and [taken] the pillow\u201d [emphasis added]. A drawing of Bed 7 was also appended to the First Statement, with two line markings made on the Victim\u2019s left side to indicate where the Respondent had allegedly placed his knees.', '27\\u2003ASP Razali interviewed the Respondent again on 30 January 2017 and recorded another statement from him (the \u201cSecond Statement\u201d). Among other things, the Respondent said as follows in the Second Statement:', 'The two \u201c\/ \/\u201d markings was [sic] where I placed my knee on the side of the bed. \u2026 [emphasis added]', '28\\u2003In his evidence-in-chief, the Respondent claimed that in the Second Statement, he was referring to only one of his knees. He explained that after he had given his First Statement, he had spoken to some of the other remandees in the lock-up. They \u201cgave [him] courage and told [him] that [he should] just tell what actually happened, nothing to fear. Then [he] started thinking and [he] could recollect what actually happened.\u201d', '29\\u2003In contrast, ASP Razali testified that the reference to \u201cmy knee\u201d in the Second Statement was a typographical error, and that the phrase ought to refer to both the Respondent\u2019s knees.', '30\\u2003On 31 January 2017, the day after the Respondent\u2019s Second Statement was recorded, ASP Razali escorted the Respondent to the Home for a scene investigation (\u201cthe Scene Investigation\u201d). A photograph, Exhibit P19, was taken on ASP Razali\u2019s directions. P19 showed two arrows placed on Bed 7. At the trial, the Respondent agreed that the arrows corresponded to both his knees, and that he had indicated as such to ASP Razali during the Scene Investigation. He claimed that he had mistakenly told ASP Razali that he had placed both his knees on the bed because he was \u201cscared\u201d at that time, having been told by some of the remandees in the lock-up that he was facing \u201ca very dangerous allegation\u201d. He had not informed ASP Razali of this mistake because he was \u201cafraid that if [he] tell that [he] had made a mistake, the officer would be angry with [him]\u201d.'"}

Investigations revealed that a French company, B Concept, had committed VAT fraud by purchasing tax-free carbon emission allowances and then selling the allowances to French companies with tax included. The VAT money charged to the buyers was not paid to the French Treasury and were instead kept by B Concept. The proceeds of the VAT fraud were then laundered into bank accounts owned by companies incorporated in various countries. These bank accounts and companies were owned beneficially by Mr Touil, his siblings and other related persons identified as part of the VAT fraud, which was said to have caused the French government some \u20ac68.5m in lost tax revenue.', '5\\u2003Upon discovering suspicious transfers of money into a bank account in Singapore owned by Axcel Inc, the French Ministry of Justice sent an International Request for Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters dated 17 September 2014 (\u201cthe First Request\u201d) to the AG. The First Request sought principally the AG\u2019s assistance to obtain banking documents related to the Axcel Inc account and to Mr Touil generally and requested the freezing of that account.', '6\\u2003 With the documents obtained pursuant to the First Request, the French authorities discovered that all the funds in the Axcel Inc account had been transferred into the appellant\u2019s BOS Account. On 28 October 2015, the French Ministry of Justice sent another International Request for Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters (\u201cthe Second Request\u201d) to the AG. In the Second Request, the French authorities similarly asked for banking documents related to the BOS Account and for the freezing of the BOS Account.', '7\\u2003 On 8 August 2017, the AG filed an ex parte application in Originating Summons No 898 of 2017 (\u201cOS 898\u201d) to restrain dealings with the funds in the BOS Account. 1', 'The application was made under s 29 of the MACMA which enables the court to restrain property in Singapore that may be the subject of foreign confiscation orders.', '8\\u2003Based on the information obtained from the French authorities, the affidavit filed in support of OS 898 stated that the requirements for obtaining a restraint order under the MACMA were satisfied. In particular: (a) judicial proceedings within the definition of MACMA were to be instituted in France and (b) there were reasonable grounds for believing that a confiscation order may be made in the French proceedings over the funds in the BOS Account, since French law allowed for the confiscation of the proceeds of fraud. 2', 'The affidavit in support of the application referred to two principal documents: (a) a certificate issued by the Tribunal de Grande Instance de Paris on 22 June 2017 (\u201cthe 1st Certificate\u201d), and (b) an email from the French authorities on 26 July 2017 confirming that judicial proceedings would be commenced in August 2017. 3', 'The affidavit did not refer to or mention the First and Second Requests (collectively \u201cthe Requests\u201d) specifically.', '9\\u2003On 22 August 2017, the Judge granted the Restraint Order.

The said seizure took place one year before the AG\u2019s application for the Restraint Order. 6', 'Coincidentally, a report on the seizure was made to the Magistrate in the State Courts on 22 August 2017, the very day that the Judge heard the application for and granted the Restraint Order.', '12\\u2003On 3 October 2018, the appellant applied to discharge the Restraint Order. 7', 'The appellant argued that the order should be discharged because the AG was in breach of his duty of full and frank disclosure. First, the AG failed to disclose that the French authorities\u2019 stated purpose for seeking the Restraint Order under the Requests was to \u201cguarantee the effectiveness of a fine\u201d and not to support a confiscation order that may be made in the foreign proceedings. Second, the AG also failed to disclose that any payment purportedly received by the appellant in connection with the VAT fraud and money-laundering offences was approximately \u20ac3m at most.', '13\\u2003The appellant also argued that the Restraint Order ought to be discharged because it was defective and was made ultra vires. The appellant relied on essentially the same arguments as set out earlier. It alleged that the purpose of the Restraint Order was to satisfy a potential fine and thus was not within the scope of the MACMA and further, that the Restraint Order should not have restrained more than \u20ac3m in the BOS Account. The BOS Account had more than US$8.8m. Finally, the appellant also argued that the Restraint Order should be discharged because the AG failed to demonstrate a risk of dissipation of the funds in the BOS Account. The BOS Account was already subject to the CPC seizure order at the time of the AG\u2019s application for the Restraint Order and the funds in the account were therefore under no risk of being dissipated.'"}

The stipulated deadline for the submission of an EOI was 31 December 2013. It is unclear whether PCL submitted its EOI by the stipulated deadline.

SUM 2794 was for a variation of an order of court dated 25 January 2013 (the \u201cProprietary Injunction\u201d) (as previously varied pursuant to an order of court dated 6 April 2018), to allow the release of the following funds from the account holding the enjoined sums:', '(a)\\u2003US$60,000 per month, to be released to Ernest\u2019s personal bank account; and', '(b)\\u2003US$6m as a lump sum for legal expenses reasonably incurred, to be released to Cavanagh Law LLP, Ernest\u2019s lawyers.', '5\\u2003SUM 2794 was filed pursuant to s 56 of the Trustees Act and\/or the inherent jurisdiction of the court in Suit 178. In essence, Ernest sought the court\u2019s exercise of its jurisdiction to release, from trust assets, the requested moneys for his living and legal expenses.', '6\\u2003The Judge below dismissed SUM 2794. Instead, he varied a previously-granted carve-out of a Mareva injunction (which is distinct from the Proprietary Injunction), such that Ernest was permitted to spend S$10,000 per week on living expenses and S$40,000 per week on legal expenses.', '7\\u2003Ernest had taken over his family business and assets following his father\u2019s death. This included the management of the first to sixth respondents in this appeal (the first to sixth plaintiffs and fourth to ninth defendants in the counterclaim in Suit 178) (\u201cthe Companies\u201d). In the course of such management, Ernest had transferred to himself certain assets of the Companies (\u201cthe Assets\u201d). Suit 178 was brought by the Companies to seek, in the main, (a) recovery of the Assets; and (b) a declaration that the Assets in each of their names belonged absolutely to each of them. Ernest\u2019s defence was that he was the sole and beneficial owner of the Companies and the Assets.', '8\\u2003The key members of the family involved in the dispute in Suit 178 were Ernest\u2019s mother and three siblings. Ernest, his siblings and his mother were referred to collectively in the proceedings below as \u201cJERIC\u201d, while JERIC sans Ernest was referred to as \u201cJRIC\u201d. For consistency, we adopt these abbreviations here.', '9\\u2003The seventh to ninth respondents in this appeal, which we refer to collectively as \u201cECJ\u201d, were involved in the management of the Companies as directors.', '10\\u2003The Proprietary Injunction was granted by an order of court dated 25 January 2013, following the Companies\u2019 application in Summons No 1098 of 2012 for an injunction \u201cto preserve and restore assets of the Compan[ies]\u201d. Ernest had moved monies from the Companies out of their accounts, and the Proprietary Injunction compelled Ernest to procure the transfer of the sum of US$200m to an account with Credit Suisse AG in the name of John Manners And Co (Malaya) Pte Ltd, the fourth respondent (\u201cthe Injunction Account\u201d).', '11\\u2003The Proprietary Injunction was thereafter varied on several occasions. Notably, the enjoined sum in the Injunction Account was increased to US$250m on 17 May 2017.', '12\\u2003On 22 March 2018, the Court of Appeal pronounced judgment on the appeals arising out of the High Court\u2019s decision in Suit 178 \u2013 Civil Appeals Nos 34, 35, 59 and 60 of 2017 \u2013 as reported in Ernest Ferdinand Perez De La Sala v Compa\u00f1ia De Navegaci\u00f3n Palomar, SA and others and other appeals [2018] 1 SLR 894 (\u201cErnest Ferdinand Perez De La Sala (CA)\u201d). Therein, this Court found that:', '(a)\\u2003Ernest is not the sole beneficial owner of the Companies or the Assets (at [154]).', '(b)\\u2003The Companies are also not the absolute owners of the Assets. Instead, by operation of a presumption of resulting trust, the Companies hold the Assets on resulting trust for two Hong Kong companies, Northern Enterprises Ltd (\u201cNEL\u201d) and John Manners and Company Limited (Hong Kong) (\u201cJMC\u201d) (at [121]\u2013[124] and [155]).', '(c)\\u2003It was clear that a significant portion of the Assets existed for the benefit of JRIC in addition to Ernest, and that Ernest and JRIC had beneficial interests in NEL and JMC. The court held that the issues of precisely who else had a beneficial interest in the Assets, and what the nature and proportion of that beneficial interest is, did not arise to be determined in Suit 178 (at [5], [144] and [186]).', '13\\u2003Thereafter, in Summons No 1587 of 2018 (\u201cSUM 1587\u201d), the Companies sought a further proprietary injunction over the portion of the Assets which were held in Ernest\u2019s personal accounts with UBS Bank (Canada) and UBS AG (Singapore branch) (\u201cthe SUM 1587 proprietary injunction\u201d). On 6 April 2018, upon Ernest\u2019s counsel\u2019s request, the Judge granted a lump sum carve out of S$500,000 for Ernest\u2019s living and medical expenses on compassionate grounds (the \u201cS$500,000 Carve-out\u201d). Ernest was, however, to file an affidavit within two weeks of the hearing to justify this carve-out, and to state whether he had any other funds elsewhere. However, Ernest later declined to file this affidavit. As a result, on 21 May 2018, the S$500,000 Carve-out was rescinded. On the same day, the SUM 1587 proprietary injunction was granted.', '14\\u2003On 7 March 2019, the Companies applied (vide Summons No 1168 of 2019) for a worldwide Mareva injunction over the assets in Ernest\u2019s name and\/or under his control up to US$430m (the \u201cMareva Injunction\u201d). This was the difference between the amount of the Assets Ernest was obliged to account for arising from this court\u2019s decision in Ernest Ferdinand Perez De La Sala (CA) (ie, over US$680m) and the enjoined sum pursuant to the varied Proprietary Injunction (ie, US$250m). On 12 March 2019, the Mareva Injunction for US$430m was granted. The Order of Court further stated that \u201c[f]or the avoidance of doubt, the sum of US$430,000,000 enjoined [under the Mareva Injunction] shall include all sums enjoined [under the SUM 1587 proprietary injunction]\u201d (see [13] above).', '15\\u2003Alongside the Mareva Injunction, several conditions were imposed by the court:', '(a)\\u2003The Mareva Injunction was subject to a carve-out (the \u201cMareva Carve-out\u201d): Ernest was allowed to spend S$5,000 a week towards his ordinary living expenses and S$20,000 a week on legal advice and representation. The Mareva Carve-out was subject to the following conditions:', '(b)\\u2003In addition, Ernest was to disclose all assets worldwide in which he had any interest whatsoever, giving the value, location and details including the nature of interest of all such assets, via an affidavit (\u201cDisclosure Affidavit\u201d).', 'It should be noted that, from this juncture onwards, both the Mareva Injunction and the Proprietary Injunction were in force concurrently. Ernest\u2019s Disclosure Affidavit (his 72nd affidavit) was filed on 27 March 2019.', '16\\u2003On 12 March 2019, Originating Summons No 317 of 2019 (\u201cOS 317\u201d) was filed by the Companies for a determination of the precise beneficial interests, whether direct or indirect, in the Assets found to be held on resulting trust by the Companies for NEL and JMC. This was the issue left outstanding in Ernest Ferdinand Perez De La Sala (CA). OS 317 was pending before the courts at the time of the hearing of this appeal.', '17\\u2003Coming back to SUM 2794, which was filed on 6 June 2019, the application was for a variation of the Proprietary Injunction to permit trust assets (ie, the Assets held on trust by the Companies) to be released, in the amount of US$60,000 per week for living expenses and a lump sum of US$6m for legal expenses incurred before or after the date of SUM 2794. At the hearing on 8 July 2019, the Judge directed that Ernest file a further affidavit to justify the orders sought in SUM 2794. Ernest filed his 77th affidavit on 15 July 2019, and the hearing was resumed on 22 October 2019. At this second hearing, the Judge dismissed SUM 2794. The Judge, however, accepted the Companies\u2019 submission that a variation of the Mareva Carve-out was more appropriate than a variation of the Proprietary Injunction. The Judge therefore doubled the Mareva Carve-out: Ernest was thereby allowed to spend S$10,000 a week towards his ordinary living expenses and S$40,000 a week on legal advice and representation. Ernest thereafter brought this appeal, ie, Civil Appeal No 193 of 2019 (\u201cCA 193\u201d), against the Judge\u2019s dismissal of SUM 2794.'"}
{"casename":"2020_SGCA_25","fact":"Background facts\nThe events leading to the Appellant\u2019s arrest\n6 We begin our narrative by setting out the events leading to the \nAppellant\u2019s arrest. In doing so, we largely use the account given by the \nAppellant at the trial, which was generally consistent with the contents of the \nlast four of his ten statements to the Central Narcotics Bureau (\u201cCNB\u201d). The \nAppellant admitted that the account reflected in his first six statements, in which \nhe referred to the involvement of someone called \u201cDanish\u201d, was essentially \nuntrue, a point to which we will return below (at [ 83]\u2013[ 88]). \n7 At the material time, the Appellant lived with his wife, Mashitta binte \nDawood (\u201cMashitta\u201d), their children and their domestic helper (\u201cthe Helper\u201d) in \ntheir flat at Fernvale Link (\u201cthe Flat\u201d). The Appellant\u2019s cousin, Sheikh Sufian \nbin Sheikh Zainal Abidin (\u201cSufian\u201d), also stayed with them in the Flat. The \nAppellant and Mashitta occupied the master bedroom, the children and the \nHelper occupied one bedroom, while Sufian occupied another bedroom \n(\u201cBedroom 1\u201d).\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nMuhammad Nabill bin Mohd Fuad v PP[2020] SGCA 25\n48 The Appellant would smoke methamphetamine in the Flat daily. \nSometimes he would do so alone, and several times a week, he would do so with \nother individuals in Bedroom 1. These individuals included Sufian and two of \nthe Appellant\u2019s friends, Muhammad Faizal bin Mohd Shariff (\u201cFaizal\u201d) and \nMohammad Khairul bin Jabar (\u201cKhairul\u201d). Faizal, in particular, provided the \nAppellant with his supply of methamphetamine. \n9 On 26 January 2016, at around 8.20pm, Faizal brought a trolley bag \n(\u201cthe trolley bag\u201d) to the Flat, and the Helper let him into the Flat. The Appellant \nclaimed that unknown to him at the time, the trolley bag was placed in the \nstoreroom of the Flat by the Helper. \n10 A key issue that was raised in this case was whether the Appellant knew \nthat Faizal would be bringing the trolley bag to the Flat on 26 January 2016, and \nthat the trolley bag contained drugs. The Prosecution\u2019s case is that the Appellant \nknowingly received the trolley bag, which contained both the diamorphine and \nthe cannabis, from Faizal. The diamorphine was found in Bedroom 1 after the \nAppellant\u2019s arrest, while the cannabis was found in the trolley bag (see [ 16]\u2013\n[17] below).\n11 The Appellant, however, testified that he did not know that Faizal would \nbe bringing the trolley bag to the Flat on 26 January 2016. He claimed that he \nhad been asleep from about 7.00pm until about 10.00pm on the night of \n26 January 2016, and after he woke up, he left the Flat with Faizal at about \n10.20pm. It was only on the next day, 27 January 2016, that he discovered the \ndiamorphine and the trolley bag in the Flat. According to the Appellant, on \n27 January 2016, at about 2.00pm, he noticed several packets of diamorphine \nlaid out on the bed in Bedroom 1. He got into a quarrel with his wife, Mashitta, \nwho was angry that the Appellant allowed people to come to the Flat to \u201cdo \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nMuhammad Nabill bin Mohd Fuad v PP[2020] SGCA 25\n5\u2018drugs\u2019\u201d and \u201cmake use of [him]\u201d. The Appellant then placed the packets of \ndiamorphine into an \u201cAkira\u201d fan box (\u201cthe Akira box\u201d) which was in Bedroom 1. \nHe suspected that it was Sufian, the occupier of Bedroom 1, who had laid out \nthe diamorphine on the bed. \n12 Shortly thereafter, at about 4.00pm, the Appellant discovered the trolley \nbag in the storeroom. He was informed by Mashitta, who in turn had been told \nby the Helper, that Faizal had brought the trolley bag to the Flat. According to \nthe Appellant, the diamorphine must have been taken out of the trolley bag as \nthere had been no drugs in the Flat on the previous day, apart from some drugs \nin the master bedroom which were for his own consumption. \n13 On the same afternoon, the Appellant called Sufian and Faizal and asked \nthem to return to the Flat to \u201cclear the stuff\u201d. They both agreed to do so. The \nAppellant testified that he called Faizal \u201cstraightaway\u201d upon discovering the \ntrolley bag. While the Appellant initially suspected that the trolley bag might \ncontain drugs, Faizal apparently informed him that it contained cigarettes \ninstead, and the Appellant did not check whether this was true. He evidently \ntrusted Faizal. He claimed that Faizal had previously left drugs of various types \nand in various quantities, as well as cigarettes, in the Flat. On those occasions, \nthe Appellant would call Faizal to ask him to retrieve the relevant items and he \nwould do so. \n14 The Appellant\u2019s iPhone call records were not referred to at the trial to \nidentify the phone calls that he claimed he had made to Sufian and Faizal on the \nafternoon of 27 January 2016 after discovering the trolley bag and the \ndiamorphine in the Flat.

Three of the six charges against the Applicant related to incidents where the Applicant had instructed the Victim to commit acts of self-harm by, amongst other things, pouring hot water onto herself. Before the District Judge, these three charges had been framed in terms of the Applicant having abetted the commission of these offences by instigating the Victim to voluntarily cause hurt to herself (\u201cthe Abetment charges\u201d). Following the conclusion of the trial, the District Judge convicted the Applicant of all six charges, including the Abetment charges, and sentenced her to an aggregate term of imprisonment of 36 months and also ordered her to pay compensation of $11,800 to the Victim.', '2\\u2003On appeal, the Judge considered that the Abetment charges had been inappropriately framed. He came to this view reasoning that because the act of harming oneself is not an offence and certainly not an offence under s 323 of the PC, it was not appropriate to frame the charge in terms that the Applicant had abetted an act, namely self-harm by the Victim, that is not itself an offence. In short, there ordinarily could not be an abetment offence if there was no primary offence to be abetted. The Judge was evidently satisfied that there was an offence here, save that it had not been framed properly. He therefore amended the Abetment charges in terms of the Applicant having voluntarily caused hurt to the Victim by instructing the latter to commit the acts of self-harm, removing all references to abetment. The Judge convicted the Applicant on the amended charges and imposed the same sentence as had been meted out by the District Judge.', '3\\u2003In the present application, the Applicant seeks the leave of this court to refer the following questions which arise from the amendments made to the Abetment charges:', '(a)\\u2003First, whether the offence of voluntarily causing hurt under s 323 of the PC can be committed by a person (the \u201cfirst person\u201d) who instructs a second person to carry out acts which form the actus reus of the said offence, if such acts are carried out by the second person in consequence of the said instructions? (\u201cthe first question\u201d)', '(b)\\u2003Second, if the answer to the first question is in the affirmative, whether the said offence under s 323 of the PC is made out if the second person has, in consequence of the first person\u2019s instructions, performed the said acts on himself?

Mr Navin started working in Evergreen from the middle of 1991 after completing his full-time National Service. On', '13 March 1993, Mr Navin, then 23 years old, exercised an option to purchase the Poole Road Property for S$2.88m: GD ([1] supra) at [9] and [11]\u2013[13].', '8\\u2003Two days after he did so, Mr Navin applied to the Land Dealings (Approval) Unit (\u201cLDU\u201d) for Mr Ram and him to hold title to the Poole Road Property as tenants in common having a 65% (Mr Ram) and 35% interest', '(Mr Navin) respectively. 4', 'This application, which also stated that the Poole Road Property was intended to be used as a family residence, was rejected by the Controller of Residential Property.

S$2.3m of the S$2.88m was paid using a mortgage loan from Overseas Union Bank Limited. 7', 'In turn, the mortgage included a S$1.8m overdraft facility in both Mr Ram\u2019s and Mr Navin\u2019s names. The parties disputed whether it was Mr Ram or Mr Navin who had paid for the Poole Road Property: GD at [13]. Both Mr Navin and Mr Ram claimed to have paid for the Poole Road Property in full. 8', 'According to Mr Navin, he repaid the mortgage loan within six years. 9', 'Mr Ram pleaded that he had paid for the Poole Road Property in reliance on the common understanding and intent between the Rams and Mr Navin that the Rams would have a \u201clife interest\u201d in the Poole Road Property. 10', '10\\u2003While the Poole Road Property was registered in Mr Navin\u2019s name, it effectively functioned as the family home for the next 23 years. However, the Rams alleged that in February 2016, the Navins had given the family\u2019s driver and domestic helpers instructions not to serve or help the Rams or to allow them to use the family\u2019s cars. It was also alleged that the Navins had installed locks on common areas of the home, such as the television room, store room and fridge, to prevent access by the Rams, who were effectively confined to their bedroom. 11', 'On the part of the Navins, closed-circuit television footage was shown at the trial in an attempt to demonstrate Mr Ram\u2019s allegedly unreasonable behaviour while living at the Poole Road Property. On 12 July 2016, Mrs Navin obtained an expedited protection order against Mr Ram on the basis that there was imminent danger of family violence being committed against her children. This order was later discharged since, inter alia, Mrs Navin had only proven one incident of family violence committed against her, which did not include physical violence, and Mr Ram had confirmed that he would not return to the Poole Road Property while the Navins lived there: GD at [37].', '11\\u2003The police were also called on a number of occasions.

On 31 July 2016, the police were called again after Mr Ram reacted to something Mr Navin had said by pulling down his pants and exposing himself in front of Mrs Navin and her son. Mr Ram returned the next day, and Mr Navin called the police again. Subsequently, the Rams were arrested and charged with criminal trespass. Allegedly, the Rams have not been able to access the Poole Road Property to retrieve their belongings since then. 12', 'Mr Navin engaged professional movers to pack and send their belongings to them, but the Rams alleged that many items were missing. This formed the basis for their claims of conversion and\/or detinue: GD ([1] supra) at [38]\u2013[40].', '12\\u2003It was not disputed that by 2006, Mr Ram and Mr Navin were at loggerheads for various reasons which we need not go into. At the trial, some emphasis was placed by Mr Navin on the fact that the family is part of the Marwari community, which he described as a \u201ctightly knit ethnolinguistic group with origins in India and Nepal\u201d. 13', 'It was common ground that the tradition within the Marwari community is to have disputes between family members resolved by having elders within the community conduct mediation. 14', 'Consistent with this tradition, Mr Ram\u2019s youngest daughter, Ms Kalpana Binani (\u201cKalpana\u201d), and her husband, Mr Braj Binani (\u201cBraj\u201d), stepped in to mediate.

The Bonds were instead held in the name of La Brasserie Corporation Ltd, an entity controlled by the Navins.

Mr Navin explained that he held onto the entire sale proceeds as he wanted to discuss a global settlement with Mr Ram arising from their various disputes. 17', 'Mr Ram claimed that', 'Mr Navin held the sale proceeds on constructive trust for him, and that Mr Navin had breached his fiduciary duties in failing to transfer the sale proceeds to him. 18', 'At the trial below, the key dispute concerning the Bonds was whether the Bonds (and the sale proceeds) were wholly owned by Mr Ram or whether they were a joint investment by Mr Navin and Mr Ram in \u201cabout equal shares\u201d: GD at [21].', '19\\u2003On or about 21 November 2014, Mrs Ram left Mr Ram.

Pending that transfer, Mrs Ram was to grant, and she indeed granted, an irrevocable power of attorney (\u201cPOA\u201d) to Mr Navin to deal with all the rights and interests with respect to the shares including voting rights. In the event that Mrs Ram breached the terms of the January 2015 SPA, Mr Navin would be entitled to transfer the shares to himself: GD ([1] supra) at [27].', '20\\u2003However, Mrs Ram signed a Revocation of Power of Attorney on', '26 March 2015, purporting to revoke the POA.

He found the appellant\u2019s software, in particular its payroll calculation engine, flawed and inadequate for the tasks it had to perform. The appellant\u2019s calculation engine computes the components of its clients\u2019 monthly employee remuneration such as basic salary, overtime pay, bonuses, Central Provident Fund (\u201cCPF\u201d) payments and so on. Sometime in 2009, the first respondent expressed his frustrations to the second respondent, who shared his desire to design a better payroll software. To that end, they embarked on a personal venture called the \u201cKikocci Project\u201d and incorporated \u201cKikocci Corporation\u201d in the British Virgin Islands.

{"casename":"2020_SGCA_33","fact":"'4\\u2003The appellant is AnAn Group (Singapore) Pte Ltd (\u201cAnAn\u201d), a Singapore holding company. The respondent is VTB Bank (Public Joint Stock Company) (\u201cVTB\u201d), a state-owned Russian bank. On 3 November 2017, AnAn and VTB entered into a global master repurchase agreement (\u201cGMRA\u201d) under which AnAn would sell VTB global depository receipts (\u201cGDRs\u201d) of shares in EN+ Group PLC (\u201cEN+\u201d) and then repurchase the GDRs from VTB at a later date at pre-agreed rates. The pre-agreed rates that AnAn would pay VTB at the date of repurchase amounted in essence to the original purchase price paid by VTB plus interest and other costs. Despite the structure of the transaction as a sale and repurchase, this was in substance a loan from VTB to AnAn. 1', '5\\u2003According to the GMRA, AnAn was under an obligation to maintain sufficient collateral, with the level of collateral being measured by an indicator known as the Repo Ratio which was essentially calculated based on the purchase price of the GDRs plus accrued interest, divided by the prevailing value of the GDRs. As the value of the GDRs dropped, the Repo Ratio would rise accordingly. Under cl 2(a)(i) of Annex 1 to the GMRA, AnAn was obliged to maintain the Repo Ratio at below 60%. 2', 'Should the Repo Ratio exceed 60%, VTB would be entitled under the GMRA to issue a Margin Trigger Event Notice, requiring AnAn to provide sufficient cash to reduce the Repo Ratio to the Initial Repo Ratio of 50%. If AnAn failed to do so, an event of default would be deemed to have occurred under cl 10(b)(xiii) of Annex 1 to the GMRA. 3', 'Separately, the GMRA required AnAn to maintain the Repo Ratio below the Liquidation Repo Ratio of 75%. If the Repo Ratio equalled or exceeded the Liquidation Repo Ratio, a Liquidation Event would be deemed to have occurred, and this would constitute another event of default under cl 10(b)(xxiii) of Annex 1 to the GMRA. 4', '6\\u2003Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the non-defaulting party was entitled to provide a notice to the defaulting party specifying the relevant event of default, and to designate the early termination date. The repurchase date of the GDRs would then be brought forward to the early termination date, 5', 'and the non-defaulting party would undertake an exercise to calculate the amounts owed by each party. Where VTB was the non-defaulting party, and since it held the GDRs from the date of purchase, it would first have to determine the default market value of the GDRs held and to ask AnAn for a top up if the value of the GDRs fell short of the repurchase price. Clause 10(f) of the GMRA provided for three possible \u201croutes\u201d by which this default market value could be assessed by VTB: 6', '(a)\\u2003first, under cl 10(f)(i), VTB could sell the GDRs on or about the early termination date and treat the sale price as the default market value of the GDRs;', '(b)\\u2003secondly, under cl 10(f)(ii), VTB could obtain bid quotations from two or more market makers or regular dealers in the appropriate market in a commercially reasonable size, using customary pricing methodology, and treat the price quoted (or the arithmetic mean of multiple quotes) with commercially reasonable adjustments, as the default market value;', '(c)\\u2003thirdly, under cl 10(f)(iii), if VTB had endeavoured but was unable to sell the GDRs or obtain quotations for the GDRs, or had determined that it would not be commercially reasonable to sell the GDRs at the prices bidded or to obtain quotations or to use any of the quotations obtained, it could treat the \u201cNet Value\u201d of the GDRs as the default market value.', 'Where this third route under cl 10(f)(iii) was adopted, cl 10(e)(iii) of the GMRA further provided that the \u201cNet Value\u201d refers to \u201cthe amount which, in the reasonable opinion of the non-Defaulting Party, represents their fair market value, having regard to such pricing sources (including trading prices) and methods (which may include, without limitation, available prices for Securities with similar maturities, terms and credit characteristics as [the GDRs] as the non-Defaulting Party considers appropriate\u2026)\u201d. 7', '7\\u2003Clause 15(a) of Annex 1 to the GMRA provided that the GMRA is governed by English law while cl 15(b) contains the following arbitration clause: 8', '8\\u2003On 7 November 2017, pursuant to the GMRA, AnAn sold 35,715,295 EN+ GDRs for approximately US$249,999,990 to VTB. At the time of the sale, the price of EN+ shares was approximately US$13 per share.', '9\\u2003A few months later, on 6 April 2018, sanctions were imposed on major shareholders of EN+ by the United States Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cthe OFAC sanctions\u201d), causing EN+ shares to plummet to about US$5.60 per share. 9', 'On the same day that the OFAC sanctions were imposed (ie, 6 April 2018), VTB issued a Margin Trigger Event Notice, informing AnAn that the Repo Ratio was at approximately 74.57%, thus exceeding the Margin Trigger Repo Ratio of 60%. In this notice, VTB asked AnAn to top up a cash margin of approximately US$85m by 10 April 2018, so as to bring the Repo Ratio to 50% or below. 10', 'AnAn failed to restore its collateral by transferring the cash margin within the stipulated timeframe.', '10\\u2003On 12 April 2018, VTB sent a default notice to AnAn, designating 16 April 2018 as the early termination date of the GMRA. According to this notice, two events of default had occurred \u2013 first, the Repo Ratio had exceeded the Liquidation Repo Ratio of 75%, thus constituting a Liquidation Event; second, the Repo Ratio had exceeded the Margin Trigger Repo Ratio of 60% and AnAn had failed to top up a cash margin of approximately US$85m by 10 April 2018 as stipulated in the Margin Trigger Event Notice, and this constituted a further event of default under the GMRA. 11', '11\\u2003On 24 April 2018, VTB sent a calculation notice to AnAn, stating that a sum of approximately US$170m was owed by AnAn. 12', 'According to the calculation notice, this figure was arrived at by subtracting the Net Value of the GDRs from the purchase price and interest and costs. 13', 'As stated at [6] above, the designation of a Net Value of the GDRs as its default market value was one of three routes available to VTB under cl 10(f) of the GMRA. In this case, VTB stated that it had not sold the GDRs under cl 10(f)(i) of the GMRA, and that it had sought firm bids under cl 10(f)(ii) of the GMRA but \u201cnone of the brokers and\/or dealers provided [VTB] with a firm quote\u201d. 14', 'Thus, VTB elected to use the Net Value to determine the default market value of the GDRs pursuant to cl 10(f)(iii) of the GMRA, and arrived at a Net Value of US$2.50 per GDR, which it purported to be an arithmetic average of all the indicative quotes that it had received from market makers and dealers.', '12\\u2003On 23 July 2018, VTB served a statutory demand for the sum of approximately US$170m (\u201cthe Claimed Sum\u201d), which sum AnAn failed to repay within the three-week period. 15'"}

{"casename":"2020_SGCA_35","fact":"'5\\u2003Winsta Holding Pte Ltd (\u201cWinsta Holding\u201d) is the holding company, and beneath it were seven subsidiaries (singly, a \u201cWinsta Subsidiary\u201d and collectively, \u201cthe Winsta Subsidiaries\u201d). Six of these subsidiaries were primarily in the hostel business, and the last ran a serviced apartments business. Winsta Holding and its 51% shareholder, M Development Ltd (\u201cM Development\u201d), were the plaintiffs in the action below. Because cross-appeals have been brought against the Judge\u2019s decision, we refer to Winsta Holding and M Development collectively as \u201cthe Winsta Companies\u201d for convenience. We will also refer hereafter to Winsta Holding as well as the Winsta Subsidiaries as \u201cthe Winsta Group\u201d.', '6\\u2003The chief antagonists in the action were Mr Sim Poh Ping (\u201cMr Sim\u201d), Ms Sim Pei Yee (\u201cMs Lynn Sim\u201d) and Ms Sim Pei San (\u201cMs Joyce Sim\u201d) (collectively, \u201cthe Sims\u201d or the \u201cSim family\u201d). Mr Sim is the father of Ms Lynn Sim and Ms Joyce Sim. Each of them was a director of Winsta Holding and of all of the Winsta Subsidiaries. The allegations were that they had breached their fiduciary duties by diverting opportunities away from the Winsta Group to their own corporate vehicles or by entering into interested party transactions between the Winsta Group and these corporate vehicles. These are the seven named corporate defendants in the suit below (which are separate and distinct from the Winsta Subsidiaries, and are therefore not to be confused with the latter; see also [17] below); we will refer to them as \u201cthe Corporate Defendants\u201d. In addition, the Winsta Companies pursued claims against three other individuals, Mr Kong Weijia (\u201cMr Dave Kong\u201d), Ms Ng Connie (\u201cMs Connie Ng\u201d), and Mr Tan Choon Leong (\u201cMr Shawn Tan\u201d). These individuals allegedly dishonestly assisted the Sims in breaching their fiduciary duties to the Winsta Group. The total value of the claims pursued was in the range of $16.3m to $39.8m, as quantified by the Winsta Companies\u2019 expert. The thirteen defendants are collectively referred to as \u201cthe Defendants\u201d.', '7\\u2003The Judge explained his holdings in the Judgment. The Judge found that the Sims had committed a large number of breaches of fiduciary duty against the Winsta Group. Some of these included the diversion of corporate opportunities from a Winsta Subsidiary to their own vehicles, but most of them concerned interested party transactions where the Sim sisters (Ms Lynn Sim and Ms Joyce Sim) stood on both sides of the transaction. Although liability for breach of fiduciary duty was established, the Judge determined that the burden fell on the Winsta Companies to establish but-for causation, rejecting the rule in the Privy Council decision (on appeal from the Supreme Court of Canada) of Brickenden v London Loan & Savings Co et al [1934] 3 DLR 465 (\u201cBrickenden\u201d, and therefore commonly referred to as \u201cthe Brickenden rule\u201d) that had been interpreted (in the Singapore context (though cf the strict reading of the Brickenden rule, as to which see [89] below)) to entail the burden being placed on the wrongdoing fiduciaries instead to prove that their principals would have suffered the loss in any event. The Winsta Companies faced significant difficulties in proving but-for causation, and ultimately only two of their claims, concerning the diversion of two opportunities, succeeded. Mr Dave Kong, Ms Connie Ng and Mr Shawn Tan were also found to have assisted the Sims in carrying out the breaches of fiduciary duty.', '8\\u2003The Winsta Companies and some of the Defendants filed appeals against the Judge\u2019s decision. We summarise the thrust of these three appeals briefly. Civil Appeal No 218 of 2018 (\u201cCA 218\u201d) is Mr Sim\u2019s appeal against the Judge\u2019s decision finding him liable for breaching his fiduciary duties towards the Winsta Group. The Judge accepted that the evidence did not show that Mr Sim had an interest or control in any of the corporate defendants which had benefited from the various breaches of fiduciary duty, apart from Overseas Students Placement Centre Pte Ltd (\u201cOSPC\u201d), but nevertheless found Mr Sim to have breached the no-conflict and no-profit rules. Mr Sim alleges that this is a \u201cquantum leap\u201d in reasoning and must be overturned on appeal.', '9\\u2003Civil Appeal No 219 of 2018 (\u201cCA 219\u201d) is the appeal brought by the Sim sisters and their corporate vehicles OSPC and Jiu Mao Jiu Hotpot Pte Ltd (\u201cJMJ Hotpot\u201d). By this appeal, the Sim sisters seek to reduce the amount of equitable compensation and costs ordered to be paid to the Winsta Companies.', '10\\u2003Civil Appeal No 220 of 2018 (\u201cCA 220\u201d) is the most legally complex of the three appeals. In this appeal, the Winsta Companies appeal against the Judge\u2019s decision to reject Brickenden and require them to prove but-for causation. They say that Brickenden is justified on the basis of authority, principle, and policy, and is particularly apt for this case where they, as principals, face difficulty in establishing but-for causation given that the Sims as directors had such pervasive control over the Winsta Subsidiaries.', '11\\u2003We now go into the facts in greater detail.', '12\\u2003Winsta Holding, the first respondent in CA 218 and CA 219 and the first appellant in CA 220, was the first plaintiff in the High Court. It is the holding company in a group of companies (viz, the Winsta Group) which are in the hostel and serviced apartments business. The Winsta Group comprises Winsta Holding and the following wholly owned subsidiaries of Winsta Holding (viz, the Winsta Subsidiaries):', '13\\u2003On 20 May 2015, Winsta Holding and the Winsta Subsidiaries commenced Suit No 491 of 2015 (\u201cthe Suit\u201d) in the High Court claiming breach of fiduciary and other duties, knowing receipt, dishonest assistance, conspiracy to injure and\/or deceit. The Winsta Subsidiaries were placed under creditors\u2019 voluntary liquidation between 3 August 2015 and 4 August 2015.', '14\\u2003M Development, the second respondent in CA 218 and CA 219 and the second appellant in CA 220, was the second plaintiff in the Suit. M Development holds 51% of the issued share capital of Winsta Holding and is a public company listed on the Singapore Exchange. M Development was assigned the claims by the Winsta Subsidiaries in the Suit on 29 October 2015.', '15\\u2003Mr Sim, the appellant in CA 218 and the first respondent in CA 220, was the first defendant in the Suit.

Mr Sim and Ms Joyce Sim, together with two related companies, held 34% of the shares in Winsta Holding. The remaining 15% of the shareholding was owned by various unrelated third parties.', '16\\u2003The directorships of the Sims in the Winsta Group at all material times were as follows:', '17\\u2003Seven companies were made defendants to the action below (viz, the Corporate Defendants). The Corporate Defendants were alleged to have been the vehicles of the Sim family which were used to facilitate the Sims\u2019 wrongdoing, and are as follows:', '18\\u2003In addition (and as alluded to above), claims were brought against three other individuals who were alleged to have dishonestly assisted the Sims in their breaches of fiduciary duty:', '19\\u2003The Judge has comprehensively set out the facts in the Judgment at [17]\u2013[36] and in his discussion of each of the claims. Here, we offer only a brief summary of the most pertinent facts that are germane to the present appeals.', '20\\u2003The Sims, in particular Mr Sim, were the original driving force behind the Winsta Subsidiaries and the creation of the Winsta Group. Mr Sim entered the property leasing business and hostel business in 2002\u20132003. In 2003, Katong Hostel was incorporated and it started its first student hostel. The business was profitable and Mr Sim expanded it by opening more hostels. For each new hostel opened, a new company would also be incorporated to manage it. Pearl Hill Hostel was incorporated on 25 May 2004 and Hill Lodge on 9 January 2006. Mr Sim then decided to strike out into the business of managing serviced residences in 2007, and incorporated Global Residence that year to manage rented serviced apartments.', '21\\u2003Winsta Holding was incorporated on 27 February 2008 and became the holding company of the various individual hostel and serviced apartment companies. Expansion of the hostel business also continued at a steady pace. On 13 March 2008, Queensway Hostel was incorporated as another subsidiary of Winsta Holding. In 2009, Winsta Holding acquired Carlisle Hostel. Evan Hostel was later incorporated in 2012.', '22\\u2003M Development entered the picture in January 2010. It bought 51% of the shares of Winsta Holding. Mr Sim was invited but declined to join the board of M Development. Ms Lynn Sim was appointed to the board of M Development by September 2010. As stipulated under the terms of M Development\u2019s purchase of the shares in Winsta Holding, the Sims continued to manage Winsta Holding and its subsidiaries. Mr Sim was in charge of charting the overall direction of the Winsta Group and handling key contracts with governmental authorities whilst the Sim sisters were the directors in charge of the day-to-day operations. In 2011, Mr Huang Wen-Lai, a nominee of M Development, was appointed to the board of Winsta Holding.', '23\\u2003The profits of the Winsta Subsidiaries declined between 2010 and 2012. In 2013, the Winsta Group registered a loss of $8.5m. Further losses were projected for 2014. In July 2014, M Development appointed additional directors, Ms Huang Tzu Ting (\u201cMs Huang\u201d), Mr David Chin and Mr Yap Kian Peng, to the board of Winsta Holding. At the same time, Mr Sim was appointed as managing director of Winsta Holding.', '24\\u2003Winsta Holding and M Development began to suspect very significant interested party transactions in the Winsta Group after the additional directors were appointed to the board of Winsta Holding. Ms Huang was given the authority to take necessary steps to protect, secure and preserve the company\u2019s records and financial information. She engaged KordaMentha Pte Ltd (\u201cKordaMentha\u201d), a company specialising in forensic accounting, review and investigation services. In April 2015, KordaMentha produced its draft Preliminary Findings. On 7 May 2015, the Preliminary Findings were discussed by the Winsta Holding board. Two weeks later, the Suit was commenced. The dispute concerns alleged breaches of fiduciary duty in respect of duties owed to the Winsta Subsidiaries.', '25\\u2003On 22 May 2015, the Sims\u2019 employment with Winsta Holding was terminated. Ms Lynn Sim\u2019s directorship in M Development was also terminated. But the Sims remained directors of Winsta Holding. In June 2015, Winsta Holding appointed The Uncharted Co (\u201cTUC\u201d) to provide management services to its businesses, primarily in relation to Katong Hostel, Evan Hostel, Hill Lodge and Global Residence. In July 2015, the TUC produced its report on its observations and suggested steps to turn around the business units. It stated that Katong Hostel\u2019s losses for the first half of 2015 were about $0.5m and its losses might be about $1.8m by December 2015, and that it did not have enough cash to meet all its obligations. It also stated that the Winsta Group was expected to face a shortfall of about $11.2m in December 2015.', '26\\u2003The Winsta Subsidiaries were placed under creditors\u2019 voluntary liquidation between 3 August 2015 and 4 August 2015. The decisions were made by the directors nominated by M Development. Winsta Holding and M Development alleged that the liquidations were due to the subsidiaries having been run to the ground by the Sims\u2019 fraudulent and\/or wrongful conduct. This is a matter of contention in these appeals as well.', '27\\u2003Katong Hostel and Evan Hostel had leases with the Singapore Land Authority (\u201cSLA\u201d). The latter called on the insurance bonds issued as security in connection with the leases after Katong Hostel and Evan Hostel were placed under liquidation. The bonds amounted to $2.1m, and were guaranteed by Winsta Holding, the Sims and the four directors of Winsta Holding nominated by M Development. Mr Sim paid $276,666.67 in this regard. In addition, ORIX Leasing Singapore Limited (\u201cORIX\u201d) called on the guarantees provided by Mr Sim, Ms Lynn Sim, Winsta Holding and Global Residence for a $2.5m loan facility to renovate a hostel leased to Evan Hostel. Mr Sim paid ORIX $681,542.20.'"}

Then, X would pay the respondent within 89 days of the tender of the NOR. Lastly, the respondent was obliged to pay the appellant within 90 days of the tender of the NOR.

In the appellant-respondent contract, the respondent was obliged to pay the appellant a sum of US$30,245,600 while in the respondent-X contract, X was obliged to pay the respondent a sum of US$30,253,600. Therefore, under this string of contracts, the respondent would make a modest gain of US$8,000 while the appellant stood to gain around US$300,000.', '9\\u2003Based on the above timelines, the respondent was due to pay the appellant by 11 July 2018. However, the respondent did not make payment by this date because its position was that it was obliged to pay the appellant only upon being paid by X. There is no dispute that X failed to pay the respondent by 10 July 2018, as required under the respondent-X contract.', '10\\u2003The respondent\u2019s failure to pay the appellant by 11 July 2018 was preceded and followed by a number of discussions involving representatives of the respondent, the appellant and X.', '11\\u2003On 2 July 2018, Shi (an oil trader with X) and two senior employees of X (Muda and Machida) requested to meet Anh, the Deputy Director (Head of Training) of the respondent, who was partially involved in arranging the deal with the respondent and X. Anh was informed by Shi that X would not be able to make payment to the respondent for the Cargo by 10 July 2018.', '12\\u2003Anh agreed to meet X\u2019s representatives on 3 July 2018. The meeting was attended by Anh, Thanh (the respondent\u2019s finance manager), Machida and X\u2019s Chief Operation Officer, Jun. There appears to have been some discussion on an \u201calternative\u201d payment plan by X to the respondent. A second meeting also took place on 3 July 2018, but this time involving Chew, a trader in the appellant\u2019s Singapore office, with Machida and Jun.', '13\\u2003On 4 July 2018, a further meeting took place between Anh and Chew. It appears that it was during this meeting that the respondent first became aware that the appellant had initially bought the Cargo from X, and that the appellant had procured its bank, UBS, to issue a letter of credit to X. In other words, it was during this meeting that the respondent found out that X was both the ultimate buyer and the ultimate seller of the Cargo. In a second meeting on 4 July 2018, the respondent\u2019s representatives again met with X\u2019s representatives together with Chew of the appellant. According to Chew, all the parties had discussed payment by way of instalments by X to the respondent. These sums would in turn be paid by the respondent to the appellant.', '14\\u2003Pursuant to these discussions, on 12 July 2018, the respondent entered into a settlement agreement with X for the unpaid sum of US$30,253,600 (\u201cthe Settlement Agreement\u201d). It is worth reiterating that the appellant was privy to the specific discussions leading up to the Settlement Agreement. In particular, Chew was present during the meeting on 4 July 2018 when representatives of X and representatives of the respondent discussed the plan to make delayed payment by way of instalments. Indeed, as we mention below at [20], Chew would later acknowledge that he received a copy of the \u201cpayment proposal\u201d by X on 6 July 2018.', '15\\u2003In essence, the Settlement Agreement required X to pay the outstanding sum over four instalments from 10 August to 9 November 2018. The Settlement Agreement also contained an undertaking for Sit, the Chief Executive Officer of X, to execute a personal guarantee for the outstanding sums under the Settlement Agreement. Under the Settlement Agreement, the first payment fell due on 10 August 2018. X, however, only made part-payment of US$50,000 each on 17 and 30 August 2018, and thereafter failed to make payment of the remaining sums.', '16\\u2003What should be emphasised is that, during these discussions, the respondent appeared to accept that it should pay the appellant, but only after it was paid by X under the respondent-X contract. On 3 May 2018, a WhatsApp exchange took place between Shi and Anh, and Shi informed Anh as follows:', '17\\u2003Thereafter, on 3 July 2018, one day before Anh\u2019s meeting with Chew, Shi again informed Anh that the respondent was to pay the appellant only after it was paid by X. The WhatsApp conversation between Anh and Shi reads as follows:', '18\\u2003Consistent with what he was informed of by Shi, Anh told Chew, during their discussion on 4 July 2018, that the respondent would pay the appellant if and when it received payment from X. On 5 July 2018, Chew sent Anh an e-mail asking him to \u201cconfirm that the payment shall be paid on [the] due date\u201d.', '19\\u2003On 6 July 2018, Anh responded to Chew as follows:', '20\\u2003Presumably, the reference to \u201cWednesday\u2019s meeting between all three parties\u201d [emphasis added] was to the second meeting that took place on 4 July 2018. Chew acknowledged that Anh had e-mailed him a copy of the \u201cpayment proposal\u201d received by the respondent from X. Significantly, the appellant did not dispute the contents of the respondent\u2019s e-mail of 6 July 2018 \u2013 specifically that the appellant had agreed to accept the rescheduled payments after payment by X to the respondent.', '21\\u2003On 9 July 2018, the appellant sent a reminder to the respondent that payment was due on 11 July 2018. Having failed to receive payment by 11 July 2018, a second reminder was sent by the appellant on 12 July 2018. On 12 July 2018, Anh replied to the appellant by an e-mail which reads as follows:', '22\\u2003Faced with these demands for payment by the appellant, and having not received payment from X on 10 July 2018, the respondent entered into the Settlement Agreement with X on 12 July 2018.', '23\\u2003Having failed to receive full payment of the first instalment due under the Settlement Agreement on 10 August 2018, the respondent was not in a position to make payment of the sums claimed by the appellant under the appellant-respondent contract. It is undisputed that the respondent did not make any payment under the appellant-respondent contract.', '24\\u2003 On 13 August 2018, the appellant served a statutory demand under s 254(2)(a) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) on the respondent. It is significant that the appellant\u2019s statutory demand was made after X failed to pay the respondent the first instalment due under the Settlement Agreement on 10 August 2018. On 20 August 2018, the respondent\u2019s solicitors responded by way of letter, disputing the claim. In the letter, the respondent\u2019s solicitors refuted the appellant\u2019s assertion of a debt, stating, among other things, that \u201cthe transaction was on a \u2018pay to be paid\u2019 basis\u201d. In other words, \u201c[the respondent] would only pay [the appellant] after they received payment from [X]\u201d [emphasis added]. The respondents also took the position that the appellant-respondent contract was \u201ca sham and unenforceable\u201d, because it was \u201cpart of a circuitous arrangement between [X] and [the appellant]\u201d.', '25\\u2003Further, the respondent\u2019s solicitors requested that the appellant withdraw the statutory demand, since the appellant-respondent contract contained the following arbitration clause:', '26\\u2003The appellant\u2019s solicitors replied on 28 August 2018, rejecting the request. On 3 September 2018, the respondent took out HC\/OS 1086\/2018 to set aside the statutory demand and to restrain the appellant\u2019s pending winding-up proceedings.', '27\\u2003In reaction to the appellant\u2019s proceedings against the respondent for US$30,245,600, the respondent commenced proceedings against X for non-payment of the outstanding sums under the Settlement Agreement.', '28\\u2003On 30 August 2018, the respondent likewise served a statutory demand on X. X failed to pay the sums due under the Settlement Agreement. Thereafter, on 1 November 2018, the respondent commenced HC\/CWU 260\/2018 (\u201cCWU 260\u201d) against X.', '29\\u2003On 13 December 2018, X applied by way of HC\/OS 1539\/2018 (\u201cOS 1539\u201d) for a moratorium on proceedings against it. An affidavit filed by a representative of X in support of OS 1539 revealed that X was facing significant debts of approximately US$870m. The moratorium was granted and was subsequently extended until 30 January 2020. At the same time, X sought more time to restructure its debts for the wider corporate group of which X was part. In the meantime, CWU 260 has been stayed since 14 December 2018, pending the outcome of OS 1539.', '30\\u2003Further, on 11 April 2019, the respondent successfully obtained a bankruptcy order in Hong Kong against Sit for non-payment under the personal guarantee, which was provided in connection with the Settlement Agreement. Based on the evidence before us, it is not entirely clear when formal legal proceedings against Sit were commenced (see below at [92]).'"}

The amount reflected in the payment response would be what was due from Shimizu to Stargood.', '9\\u2003Following certain alleged breaches of the Subcontract on the part of Stargood, Shimizu issued a notice of default on 4 March 2019. This was followed on 22 March 2019 by an exercise of its termination rights under cl 33.2 of the Subcontract, which reads:', '10\\u2003On 30 April 2019, after termination of the Subcontract, Stargood served Payment Claim No 12 (\u201cPC 12\u201d) on Shimizu for the sum of $2,599,359.44 as payment for works done up till April 2019. Shimizu did not serve a payment response to PC 12. Stargood then proceeded to lodge Adjudication Determination No SOP\/AA203\/2019 (\u201cAA 203\u201d) on 4 June 2019. In its adjudication response, Shimizu claimed that: (a) PC 12 had not been properly served; and (b) PC 12 was outside the purview of the SOPA.', '11\\u2003It appears that Stargood was alive to the possibility that PC 12 had been improperly served on Shimizu. It then elected to serve Payment Claim No 13 (\u201cPC 13\u201d) on 31 May 2019 prior to the commencement of AA 203, which was for all intents and purposes identical to PC 12, save that the claimed sum of $2,599,359.44 was stated to be for works done up till May 2019. Shimizu\u2019s payment response to PC 13 served on 21 June 2019 stated the response amount as \u201cnil\u201d.', '12\\u2003AA 203 was dismissed by the adjudicator on 27 June 2019 on two distinct grounds:', '(a)\\u2003first, PC 12 had not been properly served on Shimizu; and', '(b)\\u2003second, PC 12 was served after Shimizu had already terminated the Subcontract. This rendered the Project Director functus officio as regards his certifying function under the Subcontract. Since no post-termination payment certification regime existed under the Subcontract, Stargood could no longer serve a payment claim as the Project Director did not have power under the Subcontract to certify the same.', '13\\u2003Stargood subsequently lodged Adjudication Determination No SOP\/AA245\/2019 (\u201cAA 245\u201d) on 5 July 2019 for the adjudication of PC 13.

That does not mean that he or she will win. That is why a court has to make the decision. A decision may be given orally or by way of a written judgment. The absence of a written judgment does not make a valid decision invalid.', '34\\u2003Furthermore, a decision which appears to a litigant to be contrary to the authorities does not in itself mean a breach of constitutional rights. Also, an oral decision may expand on reasons given below or it may not. There is no necessity to repeat reasons already given or to expand on reasons if the expansion serves no useful purpose.', '35\\u2003If BHH were right, every litigant who is unhappy with a court decision, based on his own perception of the law and\/or the facts, will be able to seek another hearing until he gets the result that he wants even though he has exhausted his avenues of appeal. That cannot be right.', '36\\u2003Accordingly, CA 119\/2019 is doomed to fail and we dismiss SUM 129 for an extension of time for BHH to file his record of appeal and core bundle for CA 119\/2019.', '37\\u2003It follows that since SUM 129 has been dismissed, the appeal in CA 119\/2019 is still deemed withdrawn. We order BHH to pay HSL the costs of the application and of the appeal fixed at $3,000, inclusive of disbursements, forthwith with the usual consequential orders.', '38\\u2003As mentioned at [13] above, BHH was to file a correctly amended SOC by 28 November 2018. Apparently he has not done so. We direct him to file and serve it within 14 days from the date of this decision.'"}

MBB extended credit facilities to the shipbuilder, NGV Tech Sdn Bhd (\u201cNGV\u201d), between 2004 and 2012 for the purpose of its ordinary business which was to build vessels for sale at its shipyard in Malaysia. NGV is not a party to the action.', '7\\u2003The first respondent is Bakri Navigation Company Ltd (\u201cBakri\u201d), the original buyer of Hull 1118 and its sister vessel, Hull 1117, pursuant to two shipbuilding contracts with NGV entered into in August 2007. These shipbuilding contracts were novated to Red Sea Marine Services Ltd (\u201cRed Sea\u201d), the second respondent, on 12 December 2007. Bakri and Red Sea are part of the Bakri group of companies. They have the same registered address, and are incorporated in Saudi Arabia. Bakri owns and operates ships, while Red Sea manages ships.', '8\\u2003The credit facilities extended by MBB to NGV were secured by six debentures executed by NGV in favour of MBB. It is not necessary to distinguish between the six debentures, their terms being identical, and hence the court below referred to them collectively as \u201cthe Debenture\u201d.', '9\\u2003Clause 3.1(b) of the Debenture created a floating charge in favour of MBB over, inter alia, all of NGV\u2019s movable and immovable property and other assets. The Debenture provided two mechanisms for the crystallisation of the floating charge:', '(a)\\u2003MBB could crystallise the floating charge by notice in writing to that effect to NGV (cl 4.2); and', '(b)\\u2003The floating charge would crystallise automatically if NGV \u201cencumbered\u201d in favour of a third party any property which was subject to the floating charge (cl 4.3). Clause 4.3 is also referred to as the \u201cautomatic crystallisation clause\u201d.', '10\\u2003The word \u201cencumbrance\u201d played a significant part in MBB\u2019s claim. The word is defined in cl 1.2 of the Debenture:', '11\\u2003The Debenture was expressly governed by Malaysian law (cl 22.14). However, the parties agreed in the court below to proceed on the basis that the court would be able to refer to cases from Singapore, Malaysia and other Commonwealth jurisdictions in order to determine any question of Malaysian law arising in connection with the Debenture. Accordingly, no expert evidence on Malaysian law was required or adduced in the court below.', '12\\u2003To repay MBB for sums advanced, NGV assigned the proceeds of all its shipbuilding contracts to MBB by way of agreements for assignment executed in 2008 and 2010 (referred to collectively as the \u201cAssignments\u201d). The Debenture and the Assignments were duly registered at the Malaysian Registry of Companies in order to preserve their enforceability in the event of the liquidation of NGV.', '13\\u2003The relationship between NGV (as a shipbuilder) and Bakri (as a purchaser of vessels) led to the construction of four vessels, ie, Hulls 1090, 1091, 1117 and 1118. Hulls 1090 and 1091 were commissioned in late 2006, while Hulls 1117 and 1118 were commissioned in August 2007. The price to be paid for Hulls 1117 and 1118 was US$6.33m each.', '14\\u2003 The mode of payment for vessels commissioned from NGV changed over time. From December 2005 to March 2006, the shipbuilding contracts provided that payment for vessels was to be by way of fixed instalment payments. From 2006 to 2010, the relevant shipbuilding contracts provided for what we refer to as the \u201cNew Mode\u201d. Under the New Mode, payment was to be made in one lump sum on completion and delivery of the vessels by irrevocable letters of credit issued by the respondents\u2019 bank (\u201cRiyad Bank\u201d) against, inter alia, a statement from MBB (\u201cthe Statement\u201d) stating that:', '(a)\\u2003The letters of credit for the vessels had not been assigned or transferred by MBB to any other party or bank;', '(b)\\u2003MBB agreed with the delivery of the vessels to the buyer; and', '(c)\\u2003MBB did not have a charge, mortgage, encumbrance, interest or lien over the vessels and the materials, equipment and machinery thereon.', '15\\u2003The New Mode of payment applied to Hulls 1117 and 1118.', '16\\u2003Unbeknownst to MBB, several transactions were entered into by NGV and Red Sea between 2009 and 2012. MBB asserted that the net result of these transactions was that Red Sea secured title and possession of Hulls 1117 and 1118, without making payment to NGV. These transactions were impugned by MBB in the action as being outside the ordinary course of business and\/or fraudulent and were used as a basis for its submissions on crystallisation and conspiracy. Red Sea relied on the same transactions to claim its status as bona fide purchaser of legal title for value without notice. The transactions are collectively referred to in the Judgment as the \u201cImpugned Transactions\u201d, and we adopt the same usage here.', '17\\u2003 First, in April 2009, NGV and Red Sea entered into agreements to reduce the purchase price of Hulls 1117 and 1118 by US$1.5m each, the shipbuilding contracts having been novated to Red Sea in late 2007. The respondents alleged in the trial that the reduction was made for the purpose of providing \u201cfull and final compensation\u201d from NGV to Bakri for NGV\u2019s delay in delivering Hulls 1090 and 1091. It was asserted that as a result of the delay, NGV had become liable to pay Bakri liquidated damages.', '18\\u2003Despite the price reduction, Red Sea continued from 2009 until 2012 to procure extensions of the letters of credit for Hulls 1117 and 1118 at the full contract price of US$6.33m each. According to MBB, it was not aware of the price reduction until after the commencement of the action below.', '19\\u2003Second, in January 2011, NGV entered into two agreements (\u201cthe Agency Agreements\u201d) with Quoin Island Marine WLL (\u201cQIM\u201d). Under the Agency Agreements QIM was appointed NGV\u2019s agent to take over the construction of Hulls 1117 and 1118. By subsequent addenda to the Agency Agreements, QIM was further authorised to agree to the terms of the delivery of the vessels to Red Sea and empowered as NGV\u2019s attorney to deliver title and possession of the vessels.', '20\\u2003 Third, according to Red Sea, it paid US$16.8m directly to NGV\u2019s subcontractors in order for them to complete construction of Hulls 1117 and 1118 (\u201cDirect Payments\u201d). Evidence of this includes meeting minutes that were signed in January 2013 by NGV acknowledging this debt to Red Sea, as well as a variety of invoices and other documents.', '21\\u2003NGV then allegedly agreed to set off its debt for the Direct Payments against the purchase price of Hulls 1117 and 1118, the net result being that Red Sea became entitled to take delivery of the two vessels without any payment to NGV. The fact of the Direct Payments and set off was contested between the parties in the trial below.', '22\\u2003Fourth, on 18 May 2011, NGV and Red Sea executed two contracts (known as the \u201cCompletion Contracts\u201d) which provided for transfer of title to, and possession of, Hulls 1117 and 1118 to Red Sea while providing that the risk in the two vessels remained with NGV. On 16 June 2011, NGV effected transfer of legal title of Hulls 1117 and 1118 to Red Sea pursuant to the Completion Contracts. The vessels were still under construction at the time of transfer of title. Red Sea registered the vessels under its ownership at the ship registry of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines on the same day. MBB was not informed of the purported transfer of title or the subsequent registration of the vessels.', '23\\u2003Fifth, in July 2012, NGV informed Red Sea that it was unable to complete construction of Hulls 1117 and 1118. NGV then physically transferred the partly-completed Hulls 1117 and 1118, with Red Sea\u2019s consent but without MBB\u2019s knowledge, to shipyards in Singapore and Batam to be completed. These shipyards were run by ASL Marine Holdings Ltd, a Singapore company, and PT ASL Shipyard Indonesia, its Indonesian associate. For convenience we refer to both companies as \u201cASL\u201d.', '24\\u2003In March 2013, the vessels were de-registered from the ship registry of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. In April 2013, Hulls 1117 and 1118 were re-registered in the ship registry of Saudi Arabia under the ownership of Saudi Arabia Govt Ports under the names \u201cRadhwa 22\u201d and \u201cRadhwa 23\u201d respectively. According to ASL, by then Hull 1117 had left its yard but Hull 1118 was still in its possession.', '25\\u2003NGV defaulted on the credit facilities granted by MBB \u2013 as of February 2013, it owed MBB in excess of RM698m. In March 2013, MBB served two notices in writing on NGV, pursuant to cl 4.2 of the Debenture, to crystallise its floating charge. In May 2013, on the application of a creditor unrelated to this dispute, NGV was ordered to be wound up in Malaysia.', '26\\u2003In the meantime, in mid-2012, MBB had discovered that the vessels had been removed to Singapore and Batam without its consent and without any payment having been made to NGV by Bakri or Red Sea. On 5 February 2013, it notified Red Sea that all sale proceeds of Hull 1118 had been assigned to it and demanded payment from Red Sea. Red Sea did not reply. On 12 March 2013, MBB notified ASL that the vessels had been charged to it by NGV and that the vessels were not to be removed or released from ASL\u2019s custody without MBB\u2019s consent. Various correspondence took place thereafter in the course of which ASL asked for evidence of the charge asserted by MBB. On 22 July 2013, ASL\u2019s Singapore solicitors wrote to MBB\u2019s solicitors to state that as they had not been given evidence of MBB\u2019s rights, they intended to deliver Hull 1118 to Red Sea on 30 July 2013. They also notified MBB that Hull 1117 had left their possession prior to 12 March 2013 (ie, the date of MBB\u2019s notification to ASL of its interest). ASL informed MBB that if it still considered it had rights over Hull 1118 it should commence the appropriate action in the Singapore courts.'"}
{"casename":"2020_SGCA_42","fact":"'3\\u2003The appellant\u2019s charges cover three separate incidents: two involving the first victim and one involving the second victim. We observe at the outset that the victims\u2019 narratives of their respective encounters with the appellant bear striking similarities. The thrust of their evidence at trial was as follows.', '4\\u2003The first victim was introduced to the appellant on the evening of 29 October 2017. She agreed to take care of his flat in exchange for a mobile phone and accompanied him home. Whilst there, the appellant pulled the first victim into his bedroom and instructed her to remove her clothes. He made her fellate him and raped her twice. The appellant recorded videos of these assaults on his mobile phone and forced the first victim\u2019s continued compliance by threatening to make the videos go \u201cviral\u201d. He also said he would call his friends to come over and \u201cgang bang\u201d her unless she complied with his demands. The appellant sent the first victim home in the early hours of 30 October 2017. He gave her $20 and warned her not to tell anyone about what had happened, or else he would make the videos of her assault go \u201cviral\u201d.', '5\\u2003The appellant next saw the first victim on the evening of 2 November 2017 at the void deck of her then-boyfriend\u2019s flat. Afraid he would make good on his threat to circulate the abovementioned videos, the first victim agreed to speak with the appellant at a nearby coffee shop. To her shock, the appellant took her on his motorcycle to the coffee shop near his flat instead. The first victim accompanied the appellant up to his flat to put down his motorcycle helmet. Thereafter, he brought her to the void deck to talk. At around midnight, the appellant asked the first victim to follow him back to the flat. In the flat, he raped her again, repeating his threat to make the said videos go \u201cviral\u201d. He then took her home.', '6\\u2003On 22 September 2017, the second victim received a Whatsapp message from an unknown sender, who turned out to be the appellant. The pair remained in intermittent contact. On 14 October 2017, the second victim asked to borrow $20 from the appellant. This prompted him to offer her $150 to clean his flat, a proposal she accepted. The appellant picked up the second victim on the afternoon of 15 October 2017 and took her to his flat. Once there, he pulled her into his bedroom and removed her clothes. He raped the second victim and forced her to fellate him, threatening to call fellow members of his motorcycle gang to come over to the flat if she did not cooperate. These acts were recorded on his mobile phone. Sometime later, the appellant sent the second victim home and gave her $20, a motorcycle helmet and a Bluetooth earpiece.'"}

These two charges read as follows:', '4\\u2003The Appellant was arrested at Woodlands Checkpoint on 6 November 2014 after driving a Malaysian-registered rental car (\u201cthe Car\u201d) from Malaysia into Singapore through the checkpoint. The Car was searched at the checkpoint, and ten bundles, concealed in two areas of the Car, were discovered by the enforcement authorities: six bundles were in the armrest of the left rear passenger seat, and four bundles were in that of the right rear passenger seat. These ten bundles were subsequently reported by the HSA to contain an aggregate of not less than 1,383.6g of cannabis and not less than 3,295.7g of fragmented vegetable matter containing CBN and THC. These bundles are the subject of the two charges brought against the Appellant. The ten bundles that are referred to in each of these charges are the same bundles.', '5\\u2003An agreed statement of facts (\u201cthe Statement of Facts\u201d) was tendered at the trial pursuant to s 267(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe CPC\u201d). There, it was stated that sometime in August 2014, the Appellant met an unidentified Malaysian man called \u201cAya\u201d. The Appellant knew that Aya was a drug syndicate leader in Malaysia who arranged deliveries of drug consignments to Singapore and accepted Aya\u2019s offer to employ him as his driver.', '6\\u2003On 5 November 2014, the Appellant agreed, at Aya\u2019s direction, to deliver ten bundles to a client in Singapore, for which he was to be paid S$5,000. On the witness stand, the Appellant testified that Aya had instructed him to collect the Car from a specified venue in Johor Bahru and then get its windows tinted. The Appellant followed these instructions. Subsequently, he met Aya, who handed him a blue bag containing the ten bundles. Aya allegedly told him that the bundles contained tembakau (meaning tobacco in the Malay language) and were to be concealed in the Car. The Appellant then consumed some methamphetamine with Aya. According to the Appellant, this was the first time he had consumed that drug, and having done so, he felt \u201cvery brave\u201d. On Aya\u2019s instructions, the Appellant placed four of the ten bundles in the armrest of the right rear passenger seat and the remaining six bundles in the armrest of the left rear passenger seat. He then parked the Car near his residence and handed the keys of the Car to Aya. The next morning, a relative of Aya handed the keys back to the Appellant, and on Aya\u2019s instructions, the Appellant drove the Car to Singapore. The Appellant admitted bringing the ten bundles into Singapore. After entering Singapore, he was to call a Malaysian number to obtain instructions from Aya pertaining to the delivery of the bundles to the intended recipient in Singapore.', '7\\u2003After his arrest, two statements were recorded from the Appellant, one under s 22 of the CPC on 6 November 2014, and one under s 23 of the CPC on 7 November 2014.'"}
{"casename":"2020_SGCA_44","fact":"'5\\u2003The facts have been set out exhaustively at [8]\u2013[31] of the Judgment and we do not propose to restate them in their entirety. Briefly, the background to this dispute originates with an agreement between the appellant and BHP Minerals Holdings Pty Ltd (\u201cBHP\u201d), presently the world\u2019s largest mining company, to develop the Ok Tedi gold and copper mine in the Western Province of PNG. Ok Tedi Mining Limited (\u201cOTML\u201d) was incorporated for this purpose. There were four shareholders: the appellant, BHP, Inmet Mining Corporation and Mineral Resources Ok Tedi No 2 Limited: (Judgment at [8]). The operations at the Ok Tedi mine, whilst profitable, caused extensive environmental damage in the Western Province. In late 2000, the growing economic and reputational cost of this damage prompted BHP to express its intention to shut down the mine prematurely. The appellant, however, was strongly of the view that the mine should remain operational because its profits contributed substantially to the gross domestic product of PNG. In an effort to accommodate the positions of both parties, which were pulling in opposite directions, OTML\u2019s stakeholders commenced extensive negotiations on arrangements that would facilitate BHP\u2019s exit from OTML without compromising the mine\u2019s operations: (Judgment at [9]\u2013[12]).', '6\\u2003By October 2001, these negotiations were in their final stages. The terms of the resulting agreement are captured in a letter dated 18 October 2001 from OTML to the Controller of Foreign Exchange of the Bank of PNG, whose approval was required for some of the envisaged transactions. In broad terms, it was agreed that the Ok Tedi mine would remain operational subject to enhanced environmental arrangements. BHP would divest its entire 52% shareholding in OTML to a special purpose vehicle which would be independent of OTML as well as OTML\u2019s past and present shareholders. As that special purpose vehicle, the respondent was incorporated in Singapore on 20 October 2001 as a company limited by guarantee. Its initial members were two lawyers from a Singapore law firm who retired after the admission of three new members, these being two of the respondent\u2019s directors and a Singapore-resident director. It was also decided that the transfer of BHP\u2019s shares to the respondent would be conditional upon its release from liabilities arising under the Interim Management Agreement and indemnification by the respondent against claims for environmental damage caused by the Ok Tedi mine.', '7\\u2003The substance of the parties\u2019 arrangements were subsequently recorded in a suite of written contracts (the \u201cWritten Contracts\u201d), to which the respondent was also a party. The most relevant of these for the present appeal are a security trust deed in respect of the OTML shares (\u201cSecurity Trust Deed\u201d) and a master agreement setting out the parties\u2019 primary obligations (\u201cMaster Agreement\u201d).

The transfer of BHP\u2019s shareholding in OTML to the respondent was effected on 7 February 2002: (Judgment at [22]).', '8\\u2003The respondent\u2019s corporate constitution is set out in the (i) Memorandum of Association (the \u201cMemorandum\u201d); (ii) Articles of Association (the \u201cArticles\u201d); and (iii) Rules of the PNG Sustainable Development Program (the \u201cProgram Rules\u201d), a document of considerable importance to the present appeal, that was annexed to and formed part of the Articles (collectively, the \u201cConstitutional Documents\u201d). Its objects are set out in the Memorandum, and these are, among other things, to apply the income from the Ok Tedi mine to \u201cpromote sustainable development within, and advance the general welfare of the people of, [PNG], particularly those of the Western Province of [PNG]\u201d (the \u201cSustainable Development Purposes\u201d). The objects clause in the Memorandum is a provision of especial importance because it defines the very purposes for which the venture existed and it was suggested that this was foundational to the entire plan. In the premises, much attention was devoted at the hearing before us to the questions of how readily the objects clause could be amended to effect drastic changes to the purposes for which the respondent had been brought into existence in the first place, and how this would frustrate and defeat the entire premise of the parties\u2019 agreement. We will turn to that shortly.', '9\\u2003The appellant\u2019s case in Suit 795\/2014 was premised on the existence of a \u201cpartly oral and partly written\u201d agreement concluded \u201cin or around October 2001\u201d between the appellant and BHP on behalf of themselves and the respondent (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) even though the latter might not yet have been in existence at the time. Besides the terms outlined at [6] above, the substance of the Agreement as pleaded is said to be as follows:', '(a)\\u2003The respondent\u2019s structure and Constitutional Documents would be specifically agreed such that oversight of the company would be vested equally in the appellant and BHP (the \u201cAgreed Oversight Structure\u201d). In particular, the Agreed Oversight Structure contemplated that:', '(b)\\u2003Even though the Agreed Oversight Structure was meant to regulate the appellant\u2019s and BHP\u2019s rights in respect of the control of the affairs of the respondent, it was to be directly enforceable against the respondent (the \u201cDirect Enforceability Term\u201d). Further, it could not be amended without the consent of the appellant and BHP (the \u201cConsent Term\u201d).', '(c)\\u2003Pursuant to the Agreement, the respondent would hold the OTML shares on a charitable trust (the \u201cTrust\u201d) for, among other things, the Sustainable Development Purposes.', '10\\u2003The appellant contended that the respondent breached the Agreement and the terms of the Trust by (i) effecting changes to its Constitutional Documents in contravention of the Agreed Oversight Structure; (ii) failing to provide an account of its dealings and assets; and (iii) dealing with assets in breach of its objects in the Memorandum and the Program Rules.', '11\\u2003The Judge patiently addressed the multiplicity of arguments before him and set out his reasoning in considerable detail. In summary, he found the existence of the Agreement to be unsupported by the available evidence: (Judgment at [104], [198] and [289]). It followed that the Trust did not exist because it was pleaded to arise \u201c[p]ursuant to the Agreement\u201d: (Judgment at [305]). Moreover, he found that there was no evidence to support a finding of an intention to create the Trust and in any case, the Trust was never constituted. Further, even if it had been constituted, the Trust\u2019s purposes could not be regarded as exclusively charitable: (Judgment at [306]). Flowing from these findings, the Judge dismissed the pleaded breaches of the Agreement and Trust: (Judgment at [343]). The present appeal challenges the entirety of the Judge\u2019s findings.'"}

At this time, Zulkarnain was driving a black Honda car.', '8\\u2003At about 9.55pm, Zulkarnain was observed positioning his car close to the junction of Chin Bee Drive and Quality Road. A black Mitsubishi Lancer car bearing registration number SGC4606C (\u201cthe Black Mitsubishi\u201d) was parked in front of Zulkarnain\u2019s car. The driver was observed to be plump and to be wearing a cap. The Black Mitsubishi was registered in Rizwan\u2019s name.', '9\\u2003Subsequently, both these cars moved from Chin Bee Drive into Quality Road. The cars drove past a stationary trailer with Malaysian registration number WER 2508 (\u201cthe Trailer\u201d) which was parked along Quality Road in the direction of Chin Bee Drive. The Trailer had its hazard lights turned on. The Black Mitsubishi stopped further down along Quality Road in the direction of International Road. Meanwhile, Zulkarnain\u2019s car made a U-turn and parked in front of the Trailer. The driver of the Trailer, a male Indian, alighted and placed some items in Zulkarnain\u2019s car through the left rear passenger side. He then returned to the Trailer. After this, all three vehicles left Quality Road and each was separately tailed by CNB officers.', '10\\u2003Zulkarnain\u2019s car was followed to Tagore Industrial Avenue where it was stopped by CNB officers who arrested him. A search conducted in Zulkarnain\u2019s car found two red plastic bags on the floor mat of the rear of the car. The first (marked \u201cA1\u201d) contained 15 black-taped bundles (marked \u201cA1A\u201d collectively and \u201cA1A1\u201d to \u201cA1A15\u201d individually), while the second (marked \u201cB1\u201d) contained 20 black-taped bundles (marked \u201cB1A\u201d collectively and \u201cB1A1\u201d to \u201cB1A20\u201d individually). These 35 bundles formed the subject of the above mentioned charges.', '11\\u2003CNB officers tailed the Black Mitsubishi to Tampines Avenue 7.

In essence, Zulkarnain stated that he acted at the behest of a person whom he knew by various names including \u201cBos\u201d, \u201cBoss\u201d and \u201cBatman\u201d. This person, whom we shall refer to as \u201cBoss\u201d, had called Zulkarnain at about 5pm to inform him that there was work that night. 8', 'Boss called Zulkarnain again at about 8pm 9', 'and told him to go to Chin Bee Drive.

This identification was first made in Zulkarnain\u2019s long statement recorded on 21 November 2013. 18', 'At the taking of a further statement on 4 December 2013, Zulkarnain identified Rizwan as \u201cmy boss\u201d when shown a photograph of Rizwan. 19', 'Zulkarnain stated that he had worked for Rizwan on previous occasions. Each time, he would be instructed to travel to a particular location in a rented car where items would be placed into the car by a man in a trailer. He would then meet Rizwan at Tagore Lane where Rizwan would collect the items from him. Zulkarnain would meet Rizwan subsequently to collect payment. 20', '21\\u2003A total of four long statements and one cautioned statement recorded from Rizwan were produced at trial. In these statements, Rizwan denied having any involvement in the transaction which took place on 20 November 2013. In his cautioned statement recorded on 29 November 2013, the day of his arrest, he denied having asked Zulkarnain to collect the drugs or to go to Tagore Lane. He stated in his final sentence that \u201cI\u2019m also following instructions from \u2018Uncle\u2019\u201d. 21', 'In his other statements, Rizwan stated that he could not recall what he had done on the night of 20 November 2013 as he was on medication. He was also initially unable to provide details about his whereabouts in the following days, save that he remembered leaving Singapore for Malaysia in the boot of a car on 25 November 2013. 22', 'Subsequently, he mentioned that he spent the night of 21 November 2013 with his friend, Farhan, and Farhan\u2019s girlfriend in a room in the Siloso Beach Resort in Sentosa.

In it, Saminathan stated that he had worked as a delivery driver for a company known as MKG Logistics (\u201cMKG\u201d). His boss at MKG was Mr Murugan a\/l Silvarajoo (\u201cMurugan\u201d). Saminathan would drive into Singapore four to six times a week. He drove the Trailer at all times save for one occasion when he drove a different lorry.

While he could not remember why he had entered Singapore that evening, three possible reasons were given by him: (a) first, to deliver goods such as cement; (b) second, to load clay at Shipyard Crescent; and (c) third, to load a consignment of goods, though he might have left Singapore with an empty lorry due to unforeseen circumstances. 25'"}
{"casename":"2020_SGCA_46","fact":"the facts of each case. As the nature of the complaint and the appropriate relief \nare different in the two statutory regimes, the central inquiry for the court \nhearing a s 216 claim is whether the plaintiff shareholder is relying on unlawful \nconduct and conduct that constitutes commercial unfairness to found his claim \nof oppression. Even where the very same facts may found a derivative action or \nan action from oppression, the evidence will be examined critically to ensure \nthat there is no blurring of the two different statutory regimes. In this regard, the \nobiter remarks of this court in Ng Kek Wee at [69] are a helpful guide: \nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nSuying Design Pte Ltd v Ng Kian Huan Edmund[2020] SGCA 46\n19\u2026 an action for s 216 [of the Companies Act] is appropriately \nbrought where the complainant is relying on the unlawfulness \nof the wrongdoer\u2019s conduct as evidence of the manner in which \nthe wrongdoer had conducted the company\u2019s affairs in \ndisregard of the complainant\u2019s interest as a minority \nshareholder and where the complaint cannot be adequately \naddressed by the remedy provided by law for that wrong. \u2026\n[emphasis in original]\n33 Recently, in Sakae Holdings at [116], we set out an analytical framework \nto ascertain whether it is an abuse of process for a particular claim to be brought \nunder s 216, as follows (see Ascend Field at [38]):\n (a) Injury\n(i) What is the real injury that the plaintiff seeks to \nvindicate?\n(ii) Is that injury distinct from the injury to the \ncompany and does it amount to commercial unfairness \nagainst the plaintiff?\n(b) Remedy\n(i) What is the essential remedy that is being \nsought and is it a remedy that meaningfully vindicates \nthe real injury that the plaintiff has suffered?\n(ii) Is it a remedy that can only be obtained under \ns 216 (eg, a winding-up order or a share buyout order) \nand not under s 216A?\n34 It is clear that the framework we set out in Sakae Holdings did not in \nany way limit or diminish the importance of the proper plaintiff rule. Rather, it \nremains a prerequisite, even where \u201coverlapping\u201d wrongs are concerned, that a \ndistinct injury must be suffered by the shareholder. The injury to the minority \nshareholder thus cannot merely reflect the injury suffered by the company. It \nmust further be shown that the distinct injury amounts to commercial unfairness \nagainst the plaintiff as a member of the company. Commercial unfairness should \nbe assessed against the behaviour the shareholder is entitled to expect or rely \non, whether this expectation arises from a formal document or an informal \nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nSuying Design Pte Ltd v Ng Kian Huan Edmund[2020] SGCA 46\n20understanding, such as the alleged Oral Agreement in the present case: see \nAscend Field at [29]; Hans Tjio, Pearlie Koh and Lee Pey Woon, Corporate \nLaw (Academy Publishing, 2015) (\u201cHans Tjio\u201d) at para 11.052. The Judge had \nregard to the framework in Sakae Holdings in concluding that it was not an \nabuse of process for Mr Ng to pursue his claims, including the overlap claims, \nunder s 216. As we explain below from [ 108], with respect, we disagree.\n35 The cases decided under s 216 do not support the proposition that \nshareholders have a general right of unilateral withdrawal from the company. In \nshort, s 216 cannot be invoked in a \u201cno-fault\u201d corporate divorce situation. As \nsuch, s 216 cannot generally be used where a minority shareholder seeks to \nwithdraw his investment for personal reasons and is not driven to do so because \nof the actions of his co-directors and controlling shareholders. This sort of case \nis different from the situation where the minority shareholder seeks relief such \nas a buy-out or winding up order pursuant to s 216 because of, for example, \nexclusion from the management of the business contrary to the legitimate \nexpectations of the minority. In all cases, what is essential is a fact-sensitive \nanalysis of whether there has been commercial unfairness. We emphasise, in \nthis regard, that the purpose and policy behind s 216 of the Companies Act is to \ngrant relief from oppressive behaviour to shareholders who would otherwise be \nunable to stop that abuse: see Ng Kek Wee at [42].\n36 It is well-established that recourse to s 216 is not available where a \nminority shareholder simply wishes to leave and take his investment in the \ncompany with him; he is not entitled to start an action under s 216 for the \npurpose of enabling him to sell his shares without a discount to reflect his \nminority holding. However, if the minority shareholder is nonetheless able to \nestablish some conduct on which an oppression action may be grounded, and so \nlong as he retains his shareholding, as matter of principle, he should be entitled \nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nSuying Design Pte Ltd v Ng Kian Huan Edmund[2020] SGCA 46\n21to rely on s 216, which is designed for the protection of members of companies. \nIt is in that capacity that members of companies seek its protection, not as \ndirectors or employees. At the same time, the fact that the minority shareholder \nseeks to withdraw from the company for reasons other than oppression remains \na useful cross-check, given its significant probative value. It may, for example, \nshow that the alleged oppression was not as systemic or wide-ranging, or even \nthat the minority shareholder has brought the s 216 claim for ancillary purposes. \nAs in all cases, the court should ask whether there is evidence of commercially \nunfair conduct affecting the minority shareholder\u2019s interests as a shareholder \nthat would serve to ground an action under s 216.\nWhether minority oppression can be established\nPreliminary points\n37 By the time of the trial in 2018, it was common ground that SMSPL \nshould be wound up. While the primary relief sought by Mr Ng had initially \nbeen an order that Ms Tan buy his shares in SMSPL at a fair value, this shift \nwas unsurprising since SMSPL had ceased business in April 2016. As regards \nMr Ng\u2019s various claims, both on behalf of SMSPL and in his own personal \ncapacity, as well as whether oppression had been established, these matters \ncontinued to be disputed. \n38 We note at the outset that the Judge\u2019s finding of oppression was critical \nfor at least two reasons. First, if oppression had not been established, Mr Ng \nwould not have standing to bring claims which rightly belonged to SMSPL \nwithout recourse to some other cause of action \u2013 such as s 216A of the \nCompanies Act. \nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nSuying Design Pte Ltd v Ng Kian Huan Edmund[2020] SGCA 46\n2239 Second and more fundamentally, where there is no finding of minority \noppression, Mr Ng\u2019s only means of withdrawing his investment in SMSPL, \nshort of a voluntary agreement to buy-out his shares, would have been to wind \nup the company. Mr Ng\u2019s decision to exit SMSPL ended the underlying purpose \nof their collaboration. Closing down SMSPL was a course of action which he \nand Ms Tan had agreed to take back in July 2015. We will now elaborate. \n40 In private companies, disputes amongst shareholders are common. A \ndisenchanted shareholder who wishes to unlock the monetary value of his \nshareholding has three options, as we explained in Liew Kit Fah and others v \nKoh Keng Chew and others [2020] 1 SLR 275 (\u201cLiew Kit Fah\u201d) at [58]. We \nobserved in Liew Kit Fah at [60] that:\n\u2026 When a minority shareholder is dissatisfied with the manner \nin which the company is managed by the majority, he \nessentially has three options: (a) accept the status quo and \nremain in the company; (b) invoke the articles of the company \nand offer to sell out; and (c) commence a minority oppression \naction under s 216(2) to secure a court-ordered buyout. Clearly, \nthe third option is the most difficult to establish but it typically \ncomes with certain benefits such as the non-application of \nminority discounts in order not to confer any windfall on the \ndelinquent majority shareholder. \u2026\n41 In the present case, Mr Ng wanted to exit the company with his \ninvestment but the articles of the company did not cater for a sale of his shares \nto the other shareholders. As such, he took the third option and sought a buy-\nout or, in the alternative, a winding up order under s 216(2) of the Companies \nAct. \nMr Ng\u2019s announcement of his intention to leave SMSPL \n42 Mr Ng\u2019s evidence was that he had, at around 1 pm on 13 July 2015, \ninformed Ms Tan and Ms Chiu that he intended to leave SMSPL and that he \nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nSuying Design Pte Ltd v Ng Kian Huan Edmund[2020] SGCA 46\n23was prepared to give them three months\u2019 notice in order to ensure any \noutstanding matters could be attended to. Mr Ng had apparently decided to do \nthis because he realised Ms Tan had no genuine intention to leave SMSPL, \nbecause differences in their working styles had resulted in a \u201crift\u201d between them, \nand because he wanted more time for his personal commitments (see [ 6] above). \nNo decision was reached then and the issue of Mr Ng\u2019s departure was revisited \nthat evening. According to Mr Ng, he again informed Ms Tan that he wanted to \nleave SMSPL, and also that he wanted to sell his shares back to the company or \nthe other shareholders. Ms Tan was allegedly outraged that Mr Ng wanted to \n\u201cwash [his] hands of the partnership\u201d; she responded by saying that she would \nnever purchase Mr Ng\u2019s shares, and that they were worth nothing as she was \nable to make them \u201cworth only 20 cents\u201d. Ms Tan disputed this account and \nstated in her Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief (\u201cAEIC\u201d) that there was no \ndiscussion of any intention to sell SMSPL\u2019s shares, and the agreement had \ninstead been to wind up the company. However, what is material for present \npurposes is that it appears that on his own case, Mr Ng had preferred a buy-out \norder, at least initially. This is corroborated by the fact that in his pleadings, Mr \nNg sought a buy-out order, or, in the alternative, an order that SMSPL be wound \nup. Mr Ng\u2019s counsel had also said in his opening statement that the \u201cultimate \nquestion\u201d was the value of Mr Ng\u2019s shares.\n43 While the minority in a small private company might be more \nsusceptible to exploitative conduct by the majority because there are no obvious \nlegal remedies spelt out in the memorandum and articles of association and the \nshares may be difficult to dispose of (see Over & Over ([ 29] supra) at [83]), it \nis evident that this alone would not suffice for a s 216 action. In the present case, \nas stated, Mr Ng had no means of exiting the company under its articles of \nassociation. While he might have been able to sell his shares to a third party, \nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nSuying Design Pte Ltd v Ng Kian Huan Edmund[2020] SGCA 46\n24Article 20 of SMSPL\u2019s Articles of Association imposes a restriction on such \ntransfers. Article 20 states that \u201cno transfer of shares is to be made except to a \nperson approved by the directors of the company.\u201d Any attempt to sell his shares \nwould therefore have been subject to the directors\u2019 approval. Even so, s 216 is \nnot satisfied merely or primarily because a minority shareholder wishes, for his \nown personal reasons, to leave the company but has no other means to do so. \nThe lynchpin of a s 216 claim is still a finding of oppression. \n44 It is therefore vital for us to consider whether the wrongs alleged by Mr \nNg provide a sufficient basis (both legal and factual) on which to find minority \noppression. Put another way, having regard to Mr Ng\u2019s unilateral withdrawal \nfrom the company, Mr Ng as a minority shareholder must show something more \nthan the unlawfulness of Ms Tan\u2019s conduct in the conduct of the corporate \naffairs of SMSPL. Mr Ng must also show that there has been injury to his \ninterests as a shareholder which does not merely reflect that suffered by the \ncompany, SMSPL.\nPre-13 July 2015 conduct \n45 We begin by examining the Oral Agreement as explained at [ 11] above. \nThe alleged breaches of the Oral Agreement are a central aspect of the alleged \nwrongs that form the basis of the oppression claim at the heart of Suit 867. \nBearing in mind the principle that a member of a company will not ordinarily \nbe entitled to complain of oppression unless there has been some breach of the \nterms on which he agreed that the affairs of the company should be conducted, \nas we mentioned at [ 33] above, the Oral Agreement, if established, would be a \ncritical yardstick against which commercial unfairness could be measured. \nIndeed, all of the overlap claims, other than the Gratuity Payments, turn on \nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nSuying Design Pte Ltd v Ng Kian Huan Edmund[2020] SGCA 46\n25whether there was an Oral Agreement at all and which version of the Oral \nAgreement is to be accepted.\n46 Unfortunately, there is no direct documentary evidence of the Oral \nAgreement. As we will see, the lack of reliable documentary evidence is a \nproblem that bedevils these proceedings. As such, resort has been had to two \nkinds of considerations in determining the true Oral Agreement. First, there are \narguments about the likelihood or truthfulness of Mr Ng or Ms Tan\u2019s Versions \nas a whole \u2013 for example, which version makes more commercial sense. Second, \nthere are the specific transfers made to SMSPL. The question is whether each \nset of transfers is more consistent with Mr Ng\u2019s Version or Ms Tan\u2019s Version. \nOn the other hand, a decision on the true Oral Agreement would also in turn \ncolour the analysis of the individual sets of transfers, since those transfers would \nhave been made in the light of the true Oral Agreement. We bear this \ninterconnectedness in mind when analysing the Oral Agreement.\n47 The parties do not offer any third possibility \u2013 on their cases, it is either \nMr Ng\u2019s Version or Ms Tan\u2019s Version that governs the business relationship \nbetween the parties. However, given the considerable difficulties with the \nevidence in the present case, and despite the Judge\u2019s conclusion, we ultimately \nfind it impossible to exclude the possibility that the truth is neither that presented \nby Mr Ng nor by Ms Tan. We return to this issue at [ 93]\u2013[ 97] below.\nThe consistency of Mr Ng\u2019s case\n48 We start with a point which SDPL complains was not addressed by the \nJudge. SDPL submits that Mr Ng\u2019s case underwent two significant and \nunexplained shifts: first, there was a shift from his pleaded case, that the Oral \nAgreement envisaged the transfer of all receivables, to his case at trial, that it \nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nSuying Design Pte Ltd v Ng Kian Huan Edmund[2020] SGCA 46\n26entailed the transfer of net receivables (which is the version of the Oral \nAgreement we have termed \u201cMr Ng\u2019s Version\u201d: see [ 12] above) (\u201cthe first \nshift\u201d); second, while Mr Ng\u2019s pleaded case was that all post-incorporation \ninvoices constituted receivables transferrable under the Oral Agreement, during \nthe trial Mr Ng arbitrarily withdrew from the ambit of his action those SDPL \ninvoices that were paid shortly after SMSPL\u2019s incorporation (on 20 February \n2012) on the basis that such invoices were likely for work done pre-\nincorporation (\u201cthe second shift\u201d). SDPL\u2019s submission is that these shifts \nundermined the credibility of Mr Ng\u2019s Version.\n49 Mr Ng submits that the first shift did not take place; his case all along \nentailed a transfer of net receivables. In our view, this is simply an implausible \nreading of Mr Ng\u2019s pleadings, which asserted that the Oral Agreement \nenvisaged that: \nAll receivables collected by [SDPL] and MOX pursuant to \ninvoices dated on or after the date of incorporation of [SMSPL] \nwere to be transferred to [SMSPL]. [emphasis added]\nMr Ng also brought claims against SDPL for furniture, fitting and equipment \n(\u201cFF&E\u201d) expenses incurred by SMSPL on SDPL\u2019s behalf. These claims were \nenumerated in his Statement of Claim at Annexes E, H1 and H2. The Statement \nof Claim therefore implied that SDPL should have borne its own FF&E \nexpenses even while transferring all its receivables to SMSPL. This was clearly \nan unsustainable arrangement from SDPL\u2019s perspective, since it would be left \nwith no revenue with which to fund its expenses, and would eventually become \ninsolvent. Mr Ng\u2019s Version in its eventual form, entailing the transfer of net \nreceivables, only emerged on the first day of trial, during his cross-examination. \nFurther, it was only on the 15th day of trial that Mr Tan confirmed that Annex \nE was simply Mr Ng\u2019s \u201calternative case\u201d in case he did not succeed on the Oral \nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nSuying Design Pte Ltd v Ng Kian Huan Edmund[2020] SGCA 46\n27Agreement. That there was a shift in Mr Ng\u2019s case in relation to the Oral \nAgreement from his pleadings to the trial cannot be denied. This goes to the \ncredibility and hence veracity of Mr Ng\u2019s Version.\n50 Mr Ng\u2019s explanation for this apparent shift was evidently that after \nSMSPL\u2019s incorporation, it \u201cpaid for everything\u201d and the costs borne by MOX \nand SDPL would be \u201cvery small\u201d, and mainly entailed consultants\u2019 fees or other \nsimilar fees. The implication was that there was little distinction between the \ntransfer of all receivables or net receivables as far as Mr Ng saw it. Against this, \nSDPL contended that it incurred considerable costs of its own even after \nSMSPL\u2019s incorporation. However, whilst SDPL has not shown that Mr Ng \nwould have known this, and its situation therefore did not necessarily cast doubt \non Mr Ng\u2019s explanation, there was still no good reason for Mr Ng to have \ninaccurately pleaded that the Oral Agreement involved the transfer of all \nreceivables if it in fact involved the transfer of net receivables. The difference \nin monetary terms between transfers of all receivables and net receivables is \nsignificant bearing in mind that the volumes and values of SDPL\u2019s projects far \nexceeded those of MOX\u2019s projects (see [ 54] below). That Mr Ng saw little \ndistinction between the transfer of all receivables or net receivables is an \nunsatisfactory explanation. \n51 There is another nuance to the framing of Mr Ng\u2019s pleaded case. His \nStatement of Claim asserts that the Oral Agreement was \u201c[e]ssentially\u201d to \n\u201ccombine both companies, namely MOX and [SDPL], into one, i.e. [SMSPL]\u201d \n[emphasis added]. Although Ms Tan and SDPL deny that there was any plan to \nmerge the businesses, former SMSPL employees Mr Cabigas Joseph Francis \nPerez and Mr Seah gave evidence that no practical distinction was drawn \nbetween MOX, SDPL and SMSPL after the latter\u2019s incorporation. This \nevidence was not challenged in cross-examination. In fact, when Mr Seah \nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nSuying Design Pte Ltd v Ng Kian Huan Edmund[2020] SGCA 46\n28tendered his letter of resignation, long before any dispute had broken out, he \nmade reference to \u201cthe merger\u201d of MOX and SDPL. The practical treatment of \nMOX, SDPL and SMSPL as a combined business is potentially significant \nbecause, as Mr Owen Hawkes, Mr Ng\u2019s accounting expert, suggested, it was \npossible that the parties paid attention only to the revenue aspect of their \nbusiness arrangements, without giving much thought to the expenses. It was \ninevitable that the expenses of such a business would have to be settled on the \nbasis of some informal understanding or ad hoc arrangement, or MOX and \nSDPL would become insolvent. On the other hand, there is some force in the \nargument advanced by counsel for SDPL, Mr William Ong (\u201cMr Ong\u201d), that \nSDPL has other shareholders whose interests have to be borne in mind when \nevaluating the veracity of Mr Ng\u2019s Version. Indeed, Ms Tan\u2019s shareholding in \nSDPL is only 30%, with the remaining shares held by Ms Tan\u2019s son, sister, and \nbrother-in-law. Mr Ong\u2019s contention is part and parcel of the argument that Mr \nNg\u2019s Version made no commercial sense.\n52 Although we accept SDPL\u2019s contention that the first shift did take place, \nthat alone does not conclusively debunk Mr Ng\u2019s Version, though it casts some \ndoubt on its credibility. \n53 As for the alleged second shift, the Judge gave this complaint short shrift \nduring the trial. The Judge said that it was Mr Ng\u2019s prerogative to maintain his \npleaded case while also withdrawing certain claims which were close to the date \nof SMSPL\u2019s incorporation. Further, the Judge accepted Mr Ng\u2019s explanation \nthat there had been no conscious consideration of how such borderline invoices \nwould be treated (see the Judgment at [26]). Thus, the second shift was not a \nreal change in Mr Ng\u2019s case. Nevertheless, we find some force in SDPL\u2019s \nargument that such a strict and potentially arbitrary line based on the date of the \nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nSuying Design Pte Ltd v Ng Kian Huan Edmund[2020] SGCA 46\n29invoice makes Mr Ng\u2019s Version inherently less plausible. We go on to discuss \nthis issue of plausibility next.\nThe plausibility of the two versions\n54 We first consider the plausibility of Mr Ng\u2019s Version. SDPL strenuously \ncontended that Mr Ng\u2019s Version made no commercial sense for Ms Tan. The \nevidence was that over a period of about six months in 2012, SDPL had \nrevenues of about $2.82m, while over a similar period of about eight months in \n2012, MOX had revenues of about $451,000. SDPL argued that such a large \ndisparity in MOX and SDPL\u2019s revenues made it implausible that Ms Tan would \nhave agreed to share these revenues in the proportion of the parties\u2019 \nshareholdings in SMSPL. That Mr Ng\u2019s Version lacked commercial sense is \nalso borne out by the fact that no due diligence on the finances of MOX or SDPL \nwas done prior to incorporation. \n55 SDPL\u2019s submission in relation to the alleged second shift in Mr Ng\u2019s \ncase is related to this point. As SDPL\u2019s counsel submitted at the hearing before \nus, Mr Ng\u2019s Version generates unfairness because an invoice could be issued \npost-incorporation even though almost all the work could have been done pre-\nincorporation. This would disadvantage Ms Tan and SDPL, given the much \nlarger amount of revenue SDPL was generating. We agree that this unduly \nadvantaged Mr Ng.\n56 Although the Judge found that Ms Tan knew \u201cthat SDPL\u2019s unbilled fees \nexceeded MOX\u2019s\u201d (the Judgment at [72]), this hardly speaks to the magnitude \nof the difference between the degrees of success of the two companies. Ms Tan\u2019s \nown evidence was that prior to SMSPL\u2019s incorporation, all that she knew was \nthat Mr Ng had told her MOX\u2019s annual revenue ranged between $550,000 and \nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nSuying Design Pte Ltd v Ng Kian Huan Edmund[2020] SGCA 46\n30$750,000, against overheads of about $420,000 to $456,000. These relatively \nbroad estimates, in the absence of supporting documentation, did not paint a \nclear picture of MOX\u2019s likely prospects or profitability. As such, accepting Mr \nNg\u2019s Version would mean that Ms Tan agreed to give up a significant proportion \nof SDPL\u2019s future income without knowing how much income from MOX she \nwould have the benefit of in return. \n57 On the other hand, the Judge was of the view that Ms Tan would be \nwilling to agree to Mr Ng\u2019s Version because she \u201cwas planning her retirement \nand intended that [Mr Ng] would take over the running of SMSPL and preserve \nthe \u2018Suying\u2019 name\u201d (the Judgment at [71]). Ms Tan\u2019s evidence was also that she \nhoped to \u201cenjoy future passive income\u201d from SMSPL even after she retired. Mr \nNg further submitted that Ms Tan went into business with him in the hopes of \nstarting an interior design practice that could hold itself out as having \narchitectural expertise or as having the services of an architect. For the purposes \nof an article in \u201cCubes\u201d magazine which described SMSPL as \u201cblur[ring] the \nboundaries between architecture and interior design\u201d, Ms Tan had sent an email \nin which she said that SDPL and MOX did complementary work, and they \ntherefore agreed without any hesitation to a collaboration. We accept that these \nwere amongst the reasons for Ms Tan\u2019s decision to start SMSPL with Mr Ng. \nBut these attractions alone are not sufficient. The likely magnitude of the \nmonetary benefit to Mr Ng arising from the transfer of post-incorporation \ninvoiced receivables compared to that to Ms Tan, and the lack of due diligence, \ngive us pause.\n58 Ms Tan\u2019s Version of the Oral Agreement, which we turn to next, is \nequally not without significant difficulties. \nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nSuying Design Pte Ltd v Ng Kian Huan Edmund[2020] SGCA 46\n3159 In finding against Ms Tan\u2019s Version, the Judge placed significant weight \non the fact that SMSPL did not track the use of its manpower by SDPL and \nMOX (see the Judgment at [27]\u2013[30]). SDPL submits that this was because the \nparties operated on an \u201chonour system\u201d for reimbursements. Her evidence is \nthat SDPL made \u201cproject-linked loans\u201d to SMSPL consisting of the entirety of \nthe receivables earned under certain invoices for SDPL projects which used \nSMSPL\u2019s resources; the reimbursements for the use of these resources would \nbe effected by a deduction of the relevant sums when these loans were repaid to \nSDPL (see the Judgment at [58]). If this were true, the serious difficulty with \nthis testimony is that Ms Tan actively delayed the process of making these \nreimbursements. According to Ms Tan, after Mr Ng\u2019s resignation, she caused \nSMSPL to repay the loans given by SDPL via the Debit Notes, but only after \ndeducting $230,000 to account for SDPL\u2019s use of SMSPL\u2019s manpower (see the \nJudgment at [89], [91]). The Judge assessed Ms Tan\u2019s best efforts at estimating \nthe amount owed to SMSPL for use of its manpower as having \u201cbordered on \nbeing arbitrary\u201d (the Judgment at [30]). In short, Ms Tan could not abide by her \nversion of the Oral Agreement even if she wanted to, because she delayed the \nmaking of reimbursements for years even while keeping no records that could \nshed light on how much these reimbursements ought to be. Ms Tan\u2019s difficulty \nlies in the absence of proper records to effect accurate reimbursements. Indeed, \nit has not been suggested that there existed any proper formula by which such \nreimbursements were to be made to SMSPL. This implies either that the parties \nnever discussed the issue of reimbursements, or that they were prepared to \naccept an arbitrary approach.\n60 Further, Mr Ng estimated that SMSPL\u2019s non-manpower overheads \naccounted for between 40% and 60% of all its expenses. Ms Tan appeared to \naccept as much in cross-examination. However, Ms Tan\u2019s case is that \nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nSuying Design Pte Ltd v Ng Kian Huan Edmund[2020] SGCA 46\n32reimbursements were made only for use of SMSPL\u2019s manpower (see the \nJudgment at [31]). As Mr Ng submits, it is unclear why the parties would have \nagreed to reimburse SMSPL for the use of its resources, and yet omit to take \ninto account approximately half of these resources, by failing to include the use \nof non-manpower resources in the Oral Agreement. However, this is the effect \nof Ms Tan\u2019s Version. \n61 In our judgment, there are gaps in either party\u2019s case. Considerations of \nplausibility therefore cannot determine which version of the Oral Agreement is \ntrue.\nOther considerations\n62 We now turn to address the other factors pertaining to the Oral \nAgreement as a whole. First, after Mr Ng resigned, Ms Tan sent him what the \nJudge described as a \u201cconfrontational email\u201d on 8 August 2015 (see the \nJudgment at [73]). This lengthy email started with a description of the \nagreement between SMSPL\u2019s shareholders as to its paid-up capital and their \nexpectations on the turnover Mr Ng was to bring into the company, and ended \nwith a section titled \u201cCompany Accounts\u201d, which stated, inter alia, that SDPL \nhad provided SMSPL with approximately $800,000 to $1,000,000 in loans to \ndate, which had now been repaid. The Judge placed weight on Ms Tan\u2019s failure \nto refer to her version of the Oral Agreement and the reimbursements for the \nuse of SMSPL\u2019s resources thereunder in this email (the Judgment at [74]). In \nour judgment, these omissions are not probative of the veracity of Ms Ng\u2019s \nVersion. This email is stated to be Ms Tan\u2019s response to Mr Ng\u2019s email dated \n28 July 2015, in which Mr Ng raised the issue of handover arrangements and \nsought SMSPL\u2019s accounts. Moreover, as we have observed at [ 12] above, up to \nthat point Mr Ng had not specifically raised the Oral Agreement or any issue \nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nSuying Design Pte Ltd v Ng Kian Huan Edmund[2020] SGCA 46\n33arising therefrom. Thus, there was nothing that compelled Ms Tan to set out her \nversion of the Oral Agreement in her 8 August 2015 reply.\n63 As for the purported $800,000 to $1,000,000 in loans, we observe that \nthe amount Ms Tan withdrew by way of the Debit Notes shortly before sending \nthis email was more than $1.6m (see [ 8] above). Ms Tan\u2019s email therefore \nappears to significantly understate the amount of the loans compared to her case \nat the trial, which was that the Debit Notes constituted repayments of loans. We \nwill return to this point starting from [ 66] below.\n64 Second, SDPL submits that the Judge failed to consider Mr Ng\u2019s \nproposal to Ms Tan for her to buy 40% of MOX\u2019s shares for $240,000 after \nSMSPL\u2019s incorporation. SDPL argues that if Mr Ng\u2019s Version were true, and \nMOX had to transfer all its receivables to SMSPL post-incorporation, its shares \nwould have no value, and there would be no reason for Mr Ng to make this \nproposal. Mr Ng, on the other hand, submits, rhetorically in our view, that this \nproposal was part of a larger plan for a share swap between himself and Ms Tan, \nwhich was meant to be a symbolic transaction reflecting the merger of SDPL \nand SMSPL. We do not find Mr Ng\u2019s share proposal to be of much help to either \nparty, not least because the stance seems to us to be purely argumentative rather \nthan constituting objective evidence in support of either version. Ultimately, no \nsale or swap of the shares took place.\n65 Third, SDPL submits that Ms Tan\u2019s Version should be preferred because \nit was corroborated by Ms Chiu and Mr Lim, who were the only other persons \nwho would have been present when the Oral Agreement was reached. On the \nother hand, the only witness to corroborate Mr Ng\u2019s Version was Mr Seah, a \nformer associate of Mr Ng who had no first-hand knowledge of the Oral \nAgreement. Ultimately, the Judge placed very little weight on the credibility of \nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nSuying Design Pte Ltd v Ng Kian Huan Edmund[2020] SGCA 46\n34the witnesses. Instead, all he said was that the conflicting evidence of all the \nwitnesses, including Mr Ng and Ms Tan, had to be considered against the \ntotality of the evidence (the Judgment at [75]). We do not see any reason to \nplace greater reliance on the conflicting oral testimony of those witnesses than \nthe Judge did, especially considering that he had the benefit of seeing the \nwitnesses testify. Instead, we turn to the specific transfers between MOX and \nSDPL on the one hand and SMSPL on the other, and consider whether the \ncircumstances of each transfer support either version of the Oral Agreement.\nThe transfers to SMSPL\n66 The parties each argue that the transfers to SMSPL were made for \npurposes consistent with their version of the Oral Agreement. We summarise \nthe transfers, which we have set out at [ 19(d)] above, in the following table:\nFrom DateMr Ng\u2019s \nCaseMs Tan\u2019s \nCaseJudge\u2019s \nFinding\nThe $203k SDPLFeb \u2013 Mar \n2012Undisputed to be a loan\nThe $600k SDPLAug \u2013 Sep \n2012Receivable Loan Loan\nThe $100k MOX Oct 2012 ReceivableReimburse-\nmentUnable to \ndetermine\nThe $162kOde to \nArtFeb 2013 Receivable Loan Loan\nThe $719k SDPLJul 2013 \u2013 \nDec 2014Receivable Loan Receivable\nThe $148k MOXAug 2013 \n\u2013 Jul 2014ReceivableReimburse-\nmentReceivable\nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nSuying Design Pte Ltd v Ng Kian Huan Edmund[2020] SGCA 46\n35(1) The $203k\n67 The $203k, which was undisputedly in the nature of advances made \nbecause SMSPL had no bank account at the time, illustrates a central point in \nthe present case. To obtain repayment of these advances, SDPL issued two \ninvoices to SMSPL both for \u201cAdministrative Fee[s]\u201d, even though that was not \nwhat they were. These invoices included GST, even though GST need not be \npaid on such transactions. This shows the poor grasp SMSPL and SDPL\u2019s staff \nhad of their accounts, and their adoption of incorrect practices and inaccurate \ndocumentation surrounding transfers of money. As the Judge found, SMSPL\u2019s \naccounts \u201cwere in a state of mess\u201d (the Judgment at [50]), and its bookkeeper \nwas \u201csomewhat muddleheaded\u201d (the Judgment at [182]). SDPL also had the \nsame bookkeeper. The fact that the documentary evidence is so unsatisfactory \nand unreliable in the present case poses a significant problem in establishing the \ntruth behind the numerous disputed facts.\n(2) The $600k\n68 These were sums of $176,000 and $424,000 transferred from SDPL to \nSMSPL in August and September 2012 respectively, which the Judge found to \nbe loans (see the Judgment at [45]\u2013[55]). Mr Ng contends, however, that these \nwere transfers of receivables.\n69 In our view, the most compelling piece of evidence in support of these \nsums being loans is the WhatsApp messages between Mr Ng and Ms Tan before \n13 July 2015. It is common ground that there was a meeting on 8 June 2015 at \nwhich Mr Ng and Ms Tan had discussed the issue of loans from SDPL to \nSMSPL, and that the outstanding loans were estimated at $800,000. According \nto Ms Tan, this referred to the outstanding loans from 2012 only. On 1 July \n2015, Ms Tan sent a WhatsApp message to Mr Ng and Ms Martinez stating the \nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nSuying Design Pte Ltd v Ng Kian Huan Edmund[2020] SGCA 46\n36\u201c[g]ood news\u201d that the relevant amount owed was only about $600,000. To this, \nMr Ng replied \u201c[t]hank you so much\u201d (see the Judgment at [53]). Mr Ng\u2019s only \nexplanation of this message is that it was an expression of gratitude to Ms Tan \nfor taking the time to check, and not an acknowledgement of the loans. Like the \nJudge, we find his explanation unpersuasive. Since Mr Ng\u2019s position all along \nhas been that SMSPL had never needed loans, there is no reason for Mr Ng to \nhave simply accepted the figure of $600,000 without protest. This strongly \nindicates that Mr Ng accepted that SMSPL took such loans from SDPL. \n70 We are also unable to agree with Mr Ng\u2019s submission that Ms Tan had \nno basis to think that SMSPL was short of funds and required the $600k in loans. \nAccording to Ms Tan, she paid close attention to SMSPL\u2019s cash flow (see [ 80] \nbelow); in August and September 2012, when the $600k was transferred, \nSMSPL\u2019s net cash flow had been significantly negative for every single \npreceding month since its incorporation. It would therefore have been obvious \nto Ms Tan that SMSPL needed funds. Indeed, Mr Ng himself accepted that Ms \nTan had told him in August 2012 that SMSPL\u2019s bank balance was low (see the \nJudgment at [54]).\n71 The conclusion that the $600k were loans is further supported by \nSDPL\u2019s list of expenses for August and September 2012, which recorded the \n$600k as \u201cpayout[s] to Suying Metropolitan to cover expenses\u201d [emphasis \nadded] (see the Judgment at [51]). This is language clearly suggestive of the \npayments being loans. The Judge also relied on a number of handwritten notes \nto the same effect (see the Judgment at [49] and [51]). Mr Ng contends that \nthese were fabrications. We do not think any reliance needs to be placed on \nthese handwritten notes, given the other evidence we have outlined above. We \ntherefore uphold the Judge\u2019s findings that the $600k were loans from SDPL to \nSMSPL.\nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nSuying Design Pte Ltd v Ng Kian Huan Edmund[2020] SGCA 46\n37(3) The $100k\n72 This is a single transfer from MOX to SMSPL in October 2012 pursuant \nto an SMSPL invoice describing the amount as a \u201cDesign Consultancy Fee\u201d. \nThe Judge was unable to determine the purpose of this transfer (see the \nJudgment at [36]). Mr Ng contends that this $100k was a transfer of receivables, \nwhile Ms Tan contends that it was a reimbursement for the use of SMSPL\u2019s \nresources, in the form of MOX\u2019s former employees who were on SMSPL\u2019s \npayroll, but were still working on MOX projects. \n73 In our view, the evidence clearly points towards the $100k being a \nreimbursement from MOX to SMSPL. This is shown, first of all, by an email \nfrom Twopoint, MOX\u2019s bookkeeper, to Mr Ng on 21 August 2012. The email \nstated that Twopoint would advise Mr Ng \u201con the amount owing to [SMSPL] \nfor expenses (i.e. salaries) paid on behalf\u201d. The only reasonable reading of this \nsentence is that Twopoint believed that MOX owed SMSPL money for salaries \nSMSPL paid on MOX\u2019s behalf. If this impression was wrong, Mr Ng did not \ncorrect it.\n74 We also accept the explanation given by SDPL\u2019s counsel of the \ntreatment of the $100k in MOX\u2019s accounts. It is clear to us from MOX\u2019s general \nledger that the $100k was paid in satisfaction of debts recorded in the general \nledger as being owed to SMSPL for various salaries in 2012, totalling \n$104,535.11. After the payment of the $100k, the remaining balance of \n$4,535.11 was transferred to Mr Ng\u2019s director\u2019s account in the general ledger. \nIn the absence of any credible explanation, these records reflect that the $100k \nwas a reimbursement to SMSPL for salaries paid by SMSPL. Although Mr Ng \nwas in sole control of MOX\u2019s accounts, Mr Tan conceded that Mr Ng had no \nexplanation for these records.\nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nSuying Design Pte Ltd v Ng Kian Huan Edmund[2020] SGCA 46\n3875 On the other hand, the only positive evidence that this $100k could have \nbeen a transfer of receivables is the fact that on SMSPL\u2019s list of incoming funds, \nthis transfer was linked to the names of two of MOX\u2019s pre-incorporation \nprojects (see the Judgment at [33]). However, Mr Ng concedes that the sum of \n$100k did not correspond to any fees received on the invoices for these projects, \nnor was there any other evidence linking the $100k to these projects. In the \ncircumstances, the weight of the evidence shows that the $100k was a \nreimbursement from MOX to SMSPL for salaries paid by SMSPL for MOX\u2019s \nformer employees who had moved over to SMSPL. The one-off nature of this \ntransfer accords with Ms Tan\u2019s case that it was made only because she had \ncomplained to Mr Ng that \u201cmost, if not all\u201d of these employees\u2019 time was spent \non MOX projects alone. We therefore overturn the Judge\u2019s finding on the \n$100k, and find that it was a reimbursement from MOX to SMSPL.\n(4) The $162k\n76 This is a transfer of $162,193.93 from Ode to Art (the business run by \nMs Chong, Mr Ng\u2019s wife) to SMSPL in February 2013, which the Judge found \nto be a loan from SDPL to SMSPL (see the Judgment at [70]). \n77 This amount reflected, in Singapore dollars, a sum SDPL\u2019s branch in \nShanghai (\u201cSD (Shanghai)\u201d) had paid in Chinese yuan to various artists in China \non Ode to Art\u2019s behalf (see the Judgment at [68]). The Judge accepted Ms Tan\u2019s \naccount that she had arranged for Ode to Art to repay this sum in Singapore \ndollars to SMSPL instead, because SMSPL was in need of funds (see the \nJudgment at [69]). Mr Ng contends, on the other hand, that this sum was paid \nto SMSPL as a means of effecting the payment of receivables collected by SD \n(Shanghai) pursuant to his version of the Oral Agreement. We agree with the \nJudge that Mr Ng has failed to discharge his burden of proof, as he is ultimately \nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nSuying Design Pte Ltd v Ng Kian Huan Edmund[2020] SGCA 46\n39unable to draw any link between income from specific SD (Shanghai) projects \nand this $162k. In the absence of any proof to the contrary, the natural inference \nto draw when Ode to Art made repayment to SMSPL for a loan which Ode to \nArt owed to SDPL was that this transfer amounted to a loan from SDPL to \nSMSPL. We therefore affirm the Judge\u2019s finding that the $162k was effectively \na loan from SDPL to SMSPL.\n(5) The $719k\n78 These are sums totalling $719,652.02 which SDPL transferred SMSPL \nin April, July and September 2013 and December 2014 (see the Judgment at \n[56]\u2013[57]). They were paid pursuant to ten invoices relating to a number of \nSDPL\u2019s pre-incorporation projects, which described the sums as \u201cconsultancy \nfee[s]\u201d. The Judge found the $719k to be transfers of receivables from SDPL to \nSMSPL pursuant to Mr Ng\u2019s Version (see the Judgment at [67]). \n79 SDPL contends, however, that the $719k were \u201cproject-linked loans\u201d. \nAccording to Ms Tan, these loans were made in order to ensure that SMSPL \nmaintained a cash buffer of three times its monthly operational expenses, as well \nas any additional cash needed to fund FF&E purchases for its projects (see the \nJudgment at [58]). As alluded to at [ 59] above, the \u201cproject-linked loans\u201d were \ntransfers of the entirety of the receivables earned under certain invoices.\n80 We begin with Ms Tan\u2019s explanation that she maintained a cash buffer \nfor SMSPL. Such a suggestion is plausible since a cash buffer is intended to \ntake care of cash flow problems and emergency expenses, and is a part and \nparcel of good business management. However, Ms Tan\u2019s evidence on her \nimplementation of this cash buffer raises some doubts as to whether the practice \nof a cash buffer existed in SMSPL or, if it did, whether it was arbitrary. In her \nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nSuying Design Pte Ltd v Ng Kian Huan Edmund[2020] SGCA 46\n40AEIC, Ms Tan stated that she maintained the cash buffer by deducting cash set \naside for FF&E expenses from SMSPL\u2019s bank balance. This was no longer Ms \nTan\u2019s position when she took the stand at the trial: she then claimed that she \nnever looked at SMSPL\u2019s bank statements or its general ledger; instead, she \nonly managed its cash buffer by looking at its incoming cheque listing and its \nlist of expenses. Ms Tan\u2019s accounts in her AEIC and at trial are clearly \ncontradictory. On"}

Financial services consultants were to advise clients on insurance, unit trust products and estate planning.', '7\\u2003Sometime in 2004, Saimee, then a professional horse jockey, consulted one Candice Lee (\u201cLee\u201d) from Prudential Insurance Company (\u201cPrudential\u201d) with a view to purchasing insurance cover for himself. In 2005, when Lee left Prudential, she became a financial adviser on behalf of IPP. Saimee thereafter procured insurance policies through IPP. After Lee left IPP\u2019s employ in 2009, Moi and Quek took over Saimee\u2019s portfolio with IPP from Lee.', '8\\u2003Around the time of the handover of Saimee\u2019s portfolio, Moi and Quek also advised Saimee to make changes to some of his policies and investments. Saimee\u2019s evidence was that he \u201ctrusted their opinions and advice\u201d, and \u201ctook their advice on moving funds around when necessary\u201d.', '9\\u2003Sometime in January to April 2011, Moi and Quek suggested to Saimee the possibility of investing in the foreign exchange market. Moi and Quek advised him to sell his shares in various companies, and to invest in the foreign exchange market through a trading account with a company known as SMLG Inc (\u201cSMLG\u201d).', '10\\u2003This was referred to in the proceedings below as the \u201cSMLG Investment\u201d. More specifically, the trading account was based on an \u201calgorithm trading system\u201d operated by SMLG, and investors using the SMLG trading system would transfer the desired capital into their online trading account. The trading system would thereafter perform automated trades.', '11\\u2003Saimee alleged that Moi and Quek made the following representations:', '(a)\\u2003Within a year from the date of investment, SMLG would pay Saimee the principal amount invested along with a profit of 40%.', '(b)\\u2003The SMLG Investment was safe and capital guaranteed.', '(c)\\u2003Moi and Quek had recommended the same to all of their clients.', '12\\u2003On 11 April 2011, Moi introduced one Seeni (not called as a witness in the trial below) to Saimee. Saimee was told that Seeni was the Fund Manager for SMLG. This meeting was held outside IPP\u2019s premises, at a hotel caf\u00e9. After the meeting, Saimee, on the advice of Moi and Quek, opened a trading account with FX Primus Ltd (\u201cFX Primus\u201d) for the purposes of the SMLG Investment.', '13\\u2003Moi assisted Saimee in registering with SMLG and opening the online trading account with FX Primus. According to Moi, FX Primus was the online trading broker who held the online trading account on behalf of Saimee. The relationship between FX Primus and SMLG was not explored in any detail in the trial below. According to Moi, the setting up of these online accounts was all that was needed to complete the sign-up process, after which the investor could transfer funds to his online trading account for trading to commence.', '14\\u2003Thereafter, Saimee transferred a total of US$620,900 into a bank account (held by FX Primus) in Mauritius, in three tranches:', '(a)\\u2003US$80,300 on 27 April 2011;', '(b)\\u2003US$240,300 on 17 June 2011; and', '(c)\\u2003US$300,300 on 3 February 2012.', '15\\u2003Unbeknownst to Saimee at this point, Moi and Quek had also invested in SMLG, in the amount of US$49,701.12 and US$21,023.84 respectively. In fact, they had invested in SMLG prior to recommending the SMLG Investment to Saimee.', '16\\u2003Sometime in May 2012, after payment for the first tranche of US$80,300 plus profits became due to Saimee, Moi and Quek told Saimee that SMLG was unable to pay, due to a \u201ctechnical glitch\u201d. According to Moi\u2019s evidence, he first knew about the technical glitch in March or April 2012 and it caused \u201cthe whole [of Moi\u2019s] account [to] be wiped out\u201d, and Saimee\u2019s and Quek\u2019s account were similarly affected at around the same time. Moi was, however, unable to explain exactly why this happened. He was also unclear whether the accounts of other clients of SMLG were also affected. Moi and Quek thereafter told Saimee that SMLG required a loan of US$200,000 before SMLG could begin trading again, so that it could make the repayment to Saimee, and that SMLG would repay the loan within two months. At this point, Moi and Quek also disclosed to Saimee for the first time that they too had invested in SMLG. Hence, according to Moi and Quek, the loan to SMLG was essential to recover all their investments.', '17\\u2003Thereafter, Saimee gave SMLG the US$200,000 loan. On 17 May 2012, on Moi and Quek\u2019s advice, Saimee signed a \u201cTerm Loan Guarantee\u201d with Moi, witnessed by Quek. The Term Loan Guarantee provided that Moi would guarantee the repayment of the US$200,000 loan to Saimee. In addition, the Term Loan Guarantee stated that:', '(a)\\u2003The US$200,000 loan to SMLG was for a period of two months, starting from 25 April 2012.', '(b)\\u2003Moi would guarantee that Saimee receive an interest of 15% on the loan at the end of the two-month period, ending on 24 June 2012.', '18\\u2003On 24 June 2012, ie, two months later, the loan was not repaid. From June to September 2012, Saimee continuously asked Moi and Quek for repayment of his moneys, ie, the US$200,000 loan and the SMLG Investment. On 17 September 2012, on Moi and Quek\u2019s advice, Saimee entered into three separate settlement agreements with SMLG (\u201cSettlement Agreements\u201d). These Settlement Agreements provided that SMLG would pay Saimee US$84,000, US$252,000 and US$375,000 respectively, a total of US$711,000 (\u201cthe Settlement Sum\u201d), by 21 September 2012 as the full and final settlement of all claims against SMLG in relation to the SMLG Investment.', '19\\u2003As it turned out, Moi and Quek had themselves signed their own settlement agreements with SMLG for their invested sums. Their settlement agreements were all dated 11 September 2012.', '20\\u2003On 21 September 2012, however, no sums were repaid to Saimee. Thereafter, from November 2012 to December 2013, each time Saimee (repeatedly) asked about the Settlement Sum, Moi would reassure him that it would be paid shortly.', '21\\u2003On 2 December 2013, Saimee and Moi had a Whatsapp conversation in which Moi again reassured him that his investment would be repaid. In addition, Moi informed Saimee for the first time that the SMLG Investment was not offered by IPP. Prior to this message, and at all material times, it was Saimee\u2019s evidence that he was under the impression that the SMLG Investment was \u201capproved\u201d by IPP. Saimee\u2019s response to Moi\u2019s text is quite telling \u2013 he had asked Moi: \u201cWhy would you advise me to invest in FX when it\u2019s not approved by IPP\u201d. Moi understood \u201cFX\u201d to mean \u201cforeign exchange\u201d. Moi did not respond to Saimee\u2019s message.', '22\\u2003The loan of US$200,000 was eventually repaid in Singapore dollars \u2013S$50,000 paid on 16 October 2012 and S$240,000 a year later \u2013 although the promised interest of 15% was never paid.', '23\\u2003On 1 August 2014, Saimee\u2019s legal advisers at the time, Stamford Law Corporation, issued a letter of demand to all three appellants on Saimee\u2019s behalf.

In summary, the Judge ordered that:', '(a)\\u2003the Brothers were to pay to the Estate:', '(b)\\u2003there be no surcharge on the Estate\u2019s account for rental income that might have been collected from the Eastern Mansion unit (the Judgment at [65]);', '(c)\\u2003the sum of $1m stated as owing from the Estate to the Mother\u2019s estate be falsified and removed as an outstanding liability from the Estate\u2019s accounts (the Judgment at [60]);', '(d)\\u2003the probate granted to the Brothers be revoked, ie, the Brothers be removed as executors of the Estate (the Judgment at [74]); 6', '(e)\\u2003the Brothers were to pay the Sisters costs of $360,000 plus reasonable disbursements; 7', '(f)\\u2003letters of administration with P\u2019s Will annexed be granted to two lawyers; 8', 'and', '(g)\\u2003the Brothers were to pay to the Estate interest on the sums stated in [12(a)(i)] to [12(a)(iii)] above at 5.33% per annum from the date of the Writ until payment (the Supp GD at [37]).', '13\\u2003The sums which the Brothers were ordered to pay as mentioned at [12(a)(i)] and [12(a)(ii)] above were sums which arose by way of an account of profits made by the Brothers: see the Judgment at [51].', '14\\u2003The Brothers then filed CA\/CA 127\/2019 (\u201cCA 127\u201d) to appeal against some of the orders made by the Judge, ie:', '(a)\\u2003that they were to pay the Estate their:', '(b)\\u2003the decision to falsify the $1m entry for the Mother\u2019s estate; and', '(c)\\u2003their removal as executors of the Estate.', '15\\u2003The Sisters filed CA\/CA 172\/2019 (\u201cCA 172\u201d) to appeal against the Judge\u2019s decision to award them interest only from the date of their Writ of Summons (\u201cthe Writ\u201d) and not from an earlier date before the Writ. There was no appeal by the Sisters against the decision of the Judge refusing to impose a surcharge on the Estate\u2019s account for rental income that might have been earned from the Eastern Mansion unit.', '16\\u2003Therefore, the main substantive issues in dispute before us arise from the appeal of the Brothers.', '17\\u2003However, the Brothers also disputed the process under which they were ordered to account for profits and removed as executors.

{"casename":"2020_SGCA_5","fact":"'4\\u2003The appellant is a Singapore citizen and is resident here. The first respondent (and first defendant in Suit 580), J S Yeh & Co (\u201cJSY\u201d), is a local law firm. The second respondent (and second defendant in Suit 580), Ms Yasmin binte Abdullah (\u201cMs Yasmin\u201d), is a solicitor and was employed by JSY at the material time. The appellant alleged that the respondents had been negligent in acting for him in the purchase of a local residential property.', '5\\u2003In 2006, Mr Sekhon, who is the appellant\u2019s cousin, sought to purchase a house in Singapore (\u201cthe Property\u201d) for occupation by himself and his family. Being a foreigner, however, Mr Sekhon could not purchase the Property without the prior approval of the Land Dealings Approval Unit (\u201cthe LDU\u201d) pursuant to s 3 of the Residential Property Act (Cap 274, 2009 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe RPA\u201d), which places restrictions on foreign nationals\u2019 ownership of local residential property. Mr Sekhon applied for permanent residency in Singapore in June 2006. Sometime during the period from July to August 2006, he engaged JSY to act as his solicitors in his application for the LDU\u2019s approval (\u201cthe LDU application\u201d) and his acquisition of the Property. During this period, he liaised directly with Ms Yasmin and a Ms Quah Kwee Suan (\u201cMs Quah\u201d) who was also a solicitor employed by JSY at the material time. Unfortunately, Mr Sekhon did not obtain the necessary approval from the LDU and therefore could not purchase the Property in his own name.', '6\\u2003In October 2006, Mr Sekhon approached the appellant and asked if the appellant would be willing to consider purchasing the Property as Mr Sekhon\u2019s \u201cnominee\u201d. According to the appellant:', '(a)\\u2003he had agreed to consider Mr Sekhon\u2019s request on the condition that participating in such an arrangement would not expose him to any risk, legal or otherwise;', '(b)\\u2003consequently, Mr Sekhon sought Ms Yasmin\u2019s advice on the legality of the appellant holding the Property on his behalf, and Ms Yasmin had advised that this was an \u201cacceptable\u201d arrangement;', '(c)\\u2003Mr Sekhon then communicated Ms Yasmin\u2019s advice to the appellant, and the appellant agreed to act as Mr Sekhon\u2019s nominee;', '(d)\\u2003thereafter, both the appellant and Mr Sekhon met with Ms Yasmin in October or November 2006 and informed her that: (i) the appellant had agreed to purchase the Property on Mr Sekhon\u2019s behalf; and (ii) Mr Sekhon would make the mortgage payments, and would be a co-borrower or guarantor for the housing loan. At this meeting, Ms Yasmin confirmed to both men that the arrangement was acceptable and that JSY would handle the necessary paperwork.', '7\\u2003The respondents disputed this version of events, and instead contended that:', '(a)\\u2003After the LDU application had been turned down, Mr Sekhon informed Ms Quah that the appellant would be purchasing the Property instead in his own name.', '(b)\\u2003At a subsequent meeting attended by the appellant and Mr Sekhon, Ms Yasmin told the appellant that it was unlawful for him to purchase and hold the Property on Mr Sekhon\u2019s behalf. Ms Yasmin also told the appellant that if he wished to purchase the Property, he must do so on the basis that he would be its legal and beneficial owner. She then sought and obtained the appellant\u2019s confirmation that he was purchasing the Property \u201cin his personal and legal capacity\u201d.', '8\\u2003A fresh option to purchase the Property was issued by the vendors in the appellant\u2019s favour in November 2006. Shortly afterwards, the appellant appointed JSY as his solicitors in the Property\u2019s acquisition. The appellant eventually acquired the Property in his own name with the transaction being completed in late December 2006. He claimed that both he and Mr Sekhon were unaware that it was unlawful for him to act as the latter\u2019s nominee in the purchase of the Property.', '9\\u2003According to the appellant, the Property was sold in mid-2012 for about $5.5m. The proceeds of sale were used to discharge the mortgage and pay for other related outstanding expenses, with the balance, amounting to about $3m, being returned to Mr Sekhon who by then had left Singapore for Australia.', '10\\u2003In December 2012, the Commercial Affairs Department of the Singapore Police Force (\u201cCAD\u201d) commenced an investigation into the purchase of the Property and seized documents from the appellant\u2019s house. The appellant informed Mr Sekhon of this investigation, and the two men started communicating on the steps that they should take to raise the necessary funds for the purposes of making restitution to the State. Both men hoped that the criminal investigation would be dropped after they had made full restitution to the State. They also discussed the commencement of legal proceedings against the respondents with the expectation that the respondents would indemnify them against any sum payable as restitution to the State. Mr Sekhon remitted about $2m to the appellant between May 2014 and March 2015 for this purpose. However, their relationship subsequently deteriorated as Mr Sekhon was unable to deliver on his promise to provide the appellant with sufficient funds to cover the amount that the appellant might have to pay the State under a confiscation of benefits order. The appellant has not received any further sums from Mr Sekhon.', '11\\u2003In January 2015, the appellant was charged with an offence under s 23 of the RPA for his role in the purchase of the Property as a nominee\/trustee of Mr Sekhon, a foreigner, with the intention of holding the Property on trust for the latter. He claimed trial to the charge. In July 2015, the Prosecution also informed the appellant that the proceeds from the sale of the Property (ie, $5,502,038.06) were liable to confiscation if the appellant were to be convicted on the charge.', '12\\u2003As mentioned above, the appellant claimed trial to the charge. His criminal trial was originally scheduled to take place at the end of 2016. However, the appellant sought and obtained an adjournment of the criminal trial on the basis that it would be more expedient if his negligence claim against the respondents in Suit 580 was determined first. It appeared that his defence against the charge was that s 23 of the RPA required proof that he had purchased the Property on Mr Sekhon\u2019s behalf without knowing that his conduct was unlawful, and that he had no knowledge that his conduct was unlawful because the respondents had advised him otherwise. The criminal trial was thus re-fixed to dates at the end of 2018. Those dates, however, were vacated due to the appellant\u2019s ill health. At the time of this appeal, the criminal trial had not been heard.', '13\\u2003In the meantime, in June 2016, the appellant had commenced Suit 580 against the respondents, alleging that they had acted negligently as his solicitors for the transaction. He also alleged that the respondents\u2019 negligence had resulted in his being charged with a criminal offence under s 23 of the RPA, being liable to make restitution to the State, having to incur legal costs in defending himself in the criminal trial, and incurring loss of income as he could not seek or pursue employment due to the ongoing criminal trial. He therefore claimed:', '(a)\\u2003the sum of $5,502,038.06, being the proceeds of sale from the Property, and\/or in the alternative, the sum liable for confiscation should he be found guilty under s 23A(4) of the RPA;', '(b)\\u2003the fine payable pursuant to s 23(4) of the RPA, should he be found guilty;', '(c)\\u2003his legal costs incurred in the criminal proceedings; and', '(d)\\u2003loss of income to be assessed.', '14\\u2003Suit 580 was initially fixed for trial in July 2018 (\u201cthe July trial dates\u201d). The parties were also directed to file and exchange their affidavits of evidence-in-chief by 14 March 2018. On 4 April 2018, the appellant filed the leave application to seek the court\u2019s leave for Mr Sekhon to testify in Suit 580 via video link. The July trial dates were vacated at some point, and Suit 580 was re-fixed for trial before the Judge in September 2018. The Judge heard the leave application on 1 August 2018 and dismissed it on 6 August 2018. He granted the appellant leave to appeal against his decision on 31 August 2018 and ordered that the September trial dates be vacated.'"}

On 14 November 2018, the appellant offered settlement on certain terms by signing and sending a proposed settlement agreement (hereinafter, \u201cthe SA\u201d) to the respondents by email. The respondents did not countersign or otherwise indicate their acceptance of the settlement terms for a considerable time. According to the appellant, this was because the settlement discussions in respect of the court proceedings took place in the context of wider negotiations involving the licensing of the appellant\u2019s computer game to the respondents in other regions. The appellant contends that it was aware that the respondents would not sign the SA until all negotiations were concluded. It is undisputed that the respondents did not sign the SA for several months.', '4\\u2003On 12 April 2019, seemingly without any prior intimation, the respondents purported to accept the appellant\u2019s offer of settlement by countersigning the SA and returning it by email to the appellant\u2019s solicitors. The appellant\u2019s solicitors responded on 16 April 2019, protesting that the offer contained in the SA was no longer capable of being accepted, and that accordingly there was no valid settlement.', '5\\u2003Clause 7.2 of the SA provides for \u201cany dispute, controversy, claim or difference of any kind\u201d arising in connection with the SA to be resolved by arbitration.

A three-member tribunal was appointed by the parties, with the participation of the appellant, and the hearing has been fixed for 3 August 2020.

We therefore recount the facts only to the extent necessary.', '5\\u2003The respondents, NRL and NGL, are part of Noble, a global supply chain manager of energy, gas and power products, metals and minerals. The first respondent, NRL, is a Hong Kong incorporated company and a principal subsidiary of the second respondent, NGL, a Bermuda incorporated company listed in Singapore. NGL is currently subject to a winding-up order in Bermuda, and it was not present at the hearing of this appeal.', '6\\u2003The first appellant, Mr Leiman, is a Dutch national. He was employed by NRL on 31 March 2006 as the Chief Operating Officer of NGL. The terms of his employment are set out in an employment agreement dated 6 December 2005 between him and NRL (the \u201cEmployment Agreement\u201d). He was promoted and appointed the Chief Executive Officer (\u201cCEO\u201d) of NGL on 1 January 2010, and was also appointed an Executive Director of NGL from 1 April 2009 to 1 December 2011.', '7\\u2003Mr Leiman was awarded NGL share options and shares and paid discretionary annual bonuses during his employment by Noble. He assigned his shares and share options to the Adelaide Trust, a trust that he established. The second appellant, Rothschild Trust, administers the Adelaide Trust as trustee.', '8\\u2003Although Mr Leiman was formally employed by NRL, which was the Noble entity that employed Hong Kong-based staff, he was responsible for Noble\u2019s global operations. The award of his benefits under the Employment Agreement was, for all practical purposes, determined by NGL\u2019s R&O Committee. At the material time from November 2011 to May 2012, the R&O Committee comprised Mr Richard Samuel Elman (\u201cMr Elman\u201d), Mr Edward Walter Rubin (\u201cMr Rubin\u201d) and Mr Robert Chan Tze Leung (\u201cMr Chan\u201d). Mr Elman was the Chairman of NGL, and Mr Rubin and Mr Chan were independent directors of NGL at the time. The R&O Committee was also assisted by Mr Jeffrey Mark Alam (\u201cMr Alam\u201d), NGL\u2019s Group General Counsel and a director of NRL, who oversaw the legal affairs of Noble. Mr Leiman also sat on the R&O Committee prior to his resignation.', '9\\u2003The NGL share options that are the subject of the present appeal were issued to Mr Leiman pursuant to the Noble Group Share Option Scheme 2004 (\u201cthe Share Option Rules\u201d). 44,818,182 share options had yet to be exercised at the time Mr Leiman resigned. These share options were assigned to and held by the Adelaide Trust on the following terms:', '10\\u2003Under cl 8.3(a) of the Share Option Rules, any unexercised share options held by Mr Leiman would lapse if he ceased to be employed by NRL. Clause 8.3(a) states:', 'However, as noted earlier, the parties entered into an agreement in anticipation of Mr Leiman\u2019s resignation from NRL. We will turn to this shortly to consider its significance in the light of the other agreements that Mr Leiman was party to, and that also made provision for the vesting, divesting or exercise of his employment-related benefits.', '11\\u2003Mr Leiman was also issued NGL shares pursuant to Noble\u2019s Annual Incentive Plan (revised 10 September 2008) (\u201cAIP\u201d). The AIP is an incentive remuneration programme under which common stock is issued to Noble employees, but held by a discretionary trust established by NGL for a stipulated period (\u201cthe Restricted Period\u201d), during which time it cannot be transferred or assigned except in the event of the employee\u2019s death. Of the shares awarded to Mr Leiman under the AIP, those that are in issue in this appeal consist of: (a) 17,276,013 shares which had already been allotted at the material time, and which Mr Leiman had in turn assigned to the Adelaide Trust; and (b) 5,652,421 shares which were awarded by way of a letter dated 4 May 2011 (\u201cthe 4 May 2011 letter\u201d), and whose allotment was pending shareholder approval.

Such an employee would also be able to trade them. The exceptions were if his employment had been terminated for cause, if he had engaged in activity inimical or contrary to NGL\u2019s interests, or if he, within six months of his resignation, entered into competition with NGL. The relevant paragraphs of the AIP state:', 'The terms under which the 5,652,421 shares were awarded to Mr Leiman by way of the 4 May 2011 letter were identical to those in the AIP, apart from the fact that references to the \u201cCompany\u201d in the AIP were changed to \u201cthe Noble Group\u201d in the 4 May 2011 letter.', '13\\u2003Mr Leiman and Mr Elman got into some disagreements sometime in the middle of 2011. Mr Leiman expressed concern that Noble was adopting questionable accounting and corporate governance practices. Mr Elman, on the other hand, had concerns regarding Mr Leiman\u2019s integrity and suitability to continue as NGL\u2019s CEO, citing some decisions that Mr Leiman had allegedly made capriciously and his failure to comply with Noble\u2019s internal protocols.', '14\\u2003The parties began to plan for Mr Leiman\u2019s exit from Noble sometime in late 2011. This was done by e-mail and in the course of some conversations.', '15\\u2003On 24 or 25 October 2011, Mr Elman informed Mr Alam that he had decided that Mr Leiman should leave Noble and that his resignation would be effective from 1 December 2011. Mr Elman instructed Mr Alam to prepare an agreement on that basis. Although this agreement was, in essence, a separation agreement, it was referred to before us as a \u201csettlement agreement\u201d, and for convenience, we adopt the same convention since it signifies the parties\u2019 intent to avoid Mr Leiman\u2019s exit turning contentious. Mr Alam understood that Mr Elman intended, through the settlement agreement, to ensure that Mr Leiman would preserve his entitlements under the Employment Agreement that would otherwise be automatically lost upon termination. Mr Leiman also wished to be hired in an advisory capacity for a term of a year until December 2012, and Mr Elman was open to this.', '16\\u2003Mr Alam and Mr Leiman negotiated the terms of the agreement from around 25 October 2011 until 31 October 2011. Mr Alam sought input from Mr Elman during these negotiations.', '17\\u2003The agreement was signed by Mr Leiman on 1 November 2011 and by Mr Elman, on NRL\u2019s behalf, on 2 November 2011 (\u201cthe Settlement Agreement\u201d). It was dated 9 November 2011.', '18\\u2003On 8 November 2011, Mr Alam sent Mr Leiman a draft of the agreement pursuant to which he would provide advisory services to NRL.

The PI\u2019s reports to Noble revealed that Mr Leiman had met with current and former Noble employees between late 2011 and early 2012. The PI also found e-mail printouts in Mr Leiman\u2019s garbage bin outside his home in England, disclosing e-mail correspondence with Mr Alexander Vinokurov (\u201cMr Vinokurov\u201d), the President and CEO of Summa Capital. Summa Capital is part of the Summa group of companies, which is one of Noble\u2019s business and strategic partners. In particular, in an e-mail dated 16 February 2012, Mr Leiman told Mr Vinokurov that he had spent two days in Brazil with the CEO and partners of BTG Pactual, a Brazilian financial investment management company. Mr Leiman explained that BTG Pactual had a strong presence in Brazil and was expanding into Latin America, and was ready to move quickly on his \u201cbusiness plan\u201d. He added that he had told BTG Pactual that Summa Capital would be \u201ca great potential partner to build this into the new Glencore\u201d.

It was not disputed that the reference to Glencore related to Glencore plc, a global commodities trading company.', '30\\u2003On 21 and 22 December 2011, Mr Peter Koenig (\u201cMr Koenig\u201d), a Senior Trust Manager at Rothschild Trust (Switzerland) Ltd, a company related to Rothschild Trust, informed NGL that Mr Leiman intended to exercise some of his NGL Share Options and to sell the shares obtained from that exercise. Mr Koenig requested the use of what was referred to as the Collins Stewart cashless facility to carry out the simultaneous exercise of the Share Options and sale of the resultant shares, such that Mr Leiman would not have to make a cash payment when carrying out the transaction. Mr Alam testified that Mr Koenig was referring to a cashless facility under which Noble permitted its employees to be \u201cforward[ed] \u2026 cash to pay up \u2026 shares to get them issued\u201d. Mr Alam replied by e-mail on NGL\u2019s behalf on 29 December 2011, stating that Mr Leiman could not sell the shares obtained from the proposed exercise of the Share Options as he was a significant employee shareholder, in accordance with a policy that applied to all significant employee shareholders. He also conveyed that \u201cManagement\u201d had recommended that Mr Leiman was not to use the Collins Stewart cashless facility or any other similar facility until further notice, as doing so was not in the best interests of Noble or its shareholders. Mr Alam later stated in an e-mail on 1 February 2012 that a separate \u201cshare dealing blackout\u201d generally imposed on Noble employees prior to the announcement of Noble\u2019s quarterly results would be lifted on 28 February 2012, after which Mr Leiman would be given approval to sell up to five million shares.', '31\\u2003In February 2012, Mr Alam, acting on Noble\u2019s behalf, engaged Wolfe Associates, a boutique consulting firm, to conduct an investigation into Mr Leiman\u2019s dealings with Mr Ferdinando Carlier and Mr Ozeias Silva de Oliveira (collectively, \u201cMessrs Carlier and Ozeias\u201d). Mr Leiman had been involved in hiring them in 2006 to run one of Noble\u2019s sugar mills in Brazil. Noble had earlier engaged Wolfe Associates in 2008 to investigate the relationship between Mr Leiman and Messrs Carlier and Ozeias. Although some red flags were raised at the time, it did not appear that any action was taken by Noble.', '32\\u2003Mr Koenig informed Mr Alam on 23 February 2012 that Rothschild Trust wished to exercise five million of Mr Leiman\u2019s Share Options and to sell the shares obtained from such exercise, and requested the use of the Collins Stewart cashless facility to carry out the transaction. On 28 February 2012, Mr Alam e-mailed Mr Leiman to state that this cashless facility was not available for his use. Mr Koenig then e-mailed NGL on 29 February 2012 to state that Rothschild Trust wished to exercise five million of Mr Leiman\u2019s Share Options without using this cashless facility. Mr Alam informed the R&O Committee of the e-mail on the same day, and sent the Committee a preliminary report that Wolfe Associates had provided him on 23 February 2012 (\u201cthe 2012 Wolfe Report\u201d) as well as copies of Mr Leiman\u2019s e-mails to Summa Capital that the PI had obtained. The 2012 Wolfe Report set out Wolfe Associates\u2019 preliminary findings on, among other things, the alleged fraudulent mismanagement of a company in Brazil by Messrs Carlier and Ozeias and other legal proceedings against them, and Mr Leiman\u2019s involvement in their hiring notwithstanding his knowledge of various allegations against them.', '33\\u2003The R&O Committee convened on 1 March 2012. All three members, Mr Elman, Mr Rubin and Mr Chan, were present. Mr Alam attended part of the meeting. The R&O Committee reviewed the 2012 Wolfe Report and copies of Mr Leiman\u2019s e-mails with Summa Capital, and unanimously resolved to refuse to approve the exercise of five million of Mr Leiman\u2019s Share Options. Mr Alam informed Rothschild Trust of this decision on the same day.', '34\\u2003Rothschild Trust protested the R&O Committee\u2019s 1 March 2012 decision in a letter dated 7 March 2012. Rothschild Trust subsequently wrote asking for details of the information upon which the decision had been based, but Mr Alam did not provide these details. We discuss the contents of the parties\u2019 correspondence in further detail below.', '35\\u2003The R&O Committee reconvened on 27 March 2012 and reaffirmed its 1 March 2012 decision. On the same day, Mr Alam informed Rothschild Trust, by way of a memorandum attached to an e-mail sent to Mr Koenig, that the Committee\u2019s 1 March 2012 decision would stand. Mr Alam explained that Mr Leiman\u2019s right to exercise the Share Options was \u201cconditional on [his] not \u2018acting in any way to the detriment of Noble prior to exercise\u2019\u201d. The R&O Committee considered that this condition had not been satisfied as Mr Leiman had breached his non-competition and confidentiality obligations, and had appointed certain persons to run Noble\u2019s sugar and ethanol mills in Brazil from 2006 even though they were not qualified to manage the business and might have participated in \u201cfraudulent conduct at a previous employer\u201d.', '36\\u2003On 3 April 2012, Mr Koenig wrote to Mr Alam to inquire if Mr Leiman was entitled to the 11,098,782 Shares and the 7,727,272 Share Options that were to vest on 31 March 2012 and 2 April 2012 respectively (see above at [9] and [11(a)]). Mr Alam replied on 10 April 2012, stating that the R&O Committee had determined that \u201cthe conditions for [the] exercise of the [Share O]ptions had not been satisfied\u201d as \u201cMr. Leiman had acted to the detriment of Noble\u201d. These conditions also applied to the vesting of the 11,098,782 Shares that Mr Koenig referred to, which therefore would not be transferred to Rothschild Trust. Further, Mr Leiman would have no entitlement to the Shares and the accrued dividends under cl 3(d) of the Settlement Agreement.', '37\\u2003Mr Alam sent a further letter to Rothschild Trust on 26 April 2012 clarifying that the R&O Committee also did not approve the vesting of the 5,652,421 shares that had been awarded to Mr Leiman under the AIP by way of the 4 May 2011 letter. This was because the Committee considered that \u201cMr Leiman ha[d] acted or engaged \u2018in activity or conduct which [was] inimical or contrary to or against the interests of [Noble]\u2019\u201d. On 3 May 2012, Mr Alam e-mailed Mr Leiman to state that the R&O Committee had confirmed that he was not awarded a discretionary bonus for 2011 (\u201cthe 2011 Bonus\u201d).'"}
{"casename":"2020_SGCA_53","fact":"'8\\u2003It would be helpful to establish the timelines of the salient events in this dispute to appreciate some of the issues that arose and how they came to be resolved by the arbitral tribunal.', '9\\u2003BAZ approached BBA at the end of 2007 to negotiate the purchase of the Shares. The parties signed the Sale and Purchase Agreement (the \u201cSPA\u201d) on 11 June 2008. Completion of the SPA took place on 7 November 2008. BAZ paid the Sellers around INR 198 billion (about US$4.6 billion) for the Shares. After completion, BBA initially continued as a director of C, but he subsequently resigned on 24 May 2009 following differences of opinion with BAZ\u2019s appointees on the Board. By that time relations between BBA and BAZ had become strained.', '10\\u2003The disputes that led to the arbitration arose over an internal report which BAZ alleged the Sellers had concealed from it. It transpired that in September 2004, the then-President of C\u2019s Research and Development Department had issued a Self-Assessment Report (\u201cthe Report\u201d) detailing how C engaged in data falsification to expedite the obtaining of regulatory approval for numerous drug products around the world. The Report did not garner much attention within C, but in 2005, an employee of C blew the whistle by secretly disclosing the Report to the United States authorities. The United States Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) and the United States Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) began investigations in early 2006. BAZ and the Sellers dispute when BAZ came to know of the Report or when BAZ could, with reasonable diligence have discovered it. Be that as it may, negotiations with the DOJ and FDA led to a settlement or consent decree in December 2011, and C made provision for paying an anticipated settlement sum of US$500 million.', '11\\u2003As noted, on 14 November 2012, BAZ commenced arbitration against the Sellers under the SPA alleging misrepresentation and concealment of facts regarding the extent of the investigations by the DOJ and FDA.', '12\\u2003After BAZ commenced arbitration, the following events occurred:', '(a)\\u2003On 13 May 2013, C paid the DOJ the settlement sum of US$500 million.', '(b)\\u2003On 6 April 2014, BAZ announced the merger of C with another company (\u201cY Co\u201d), under which all of C\u2019s shareholders would receive 0.8 Y Co shares for every one share in C (\u201cthe Merger\u201d).', '(c)\\u2003From 29 September to 10 October 2014, the substantive hearings of the arbitration were held in Singapore.', '(d)\\u2003On 25 March 2015, the Merger of C with Y Co was completed.', '(e)\\u2003On 21 April 2015, BAZ sold all its shares in Y Co in the open market.', '(f)\\u2003On 29 April 2016, the Majority rendered their Award.', '13\\u2003We note at this juncture that the governing law of the SPA is Indian law and the SPA contains the following arbitration clause:', '14\\u2003 In its Award dated 29 April 2016, the Majority addressing the following key issues.', '15\\u2003The Sellers argued that BAZ\u2019s claim was time-barred under s 17 of the Indian Limitation Act 1963 (Act No 36 of 1963) (India) (\u201cIndian Limitation Act\u201d). This provided that for a claim based on the defendant\u2019s fraud, time begins to run once the plaintiff has discovered, or could with reasonable diligence have discovered, the fraud. BAZ could have discovered the concealment of the Report with reasonable diligence following multiple events occurring between October 2008 and end April 2009. A person in a senior leadership position in BAZ was allegedly informed that the US authorities were in possession of the Report. BAZ, on the other hand, argued that it only became aware of the concealment of the Report on 19 November 2009, such that the commencement of arbitration on 14 November 2012 was within the limitation period.', '16\\u2003The Majority found that the commencement of the arbitration was not time-barred. It made a finding of fact that notwithstanding two meetings in March 2009 at which the Report was mentioned, this was insufficient to fix BAZ with the requisite knowledge of the fraud. BAZ had acted with reasonable diligence in the entire context and could not have discovered the Report before 19 November 2009 without having to take exceptional measures which it could not reasonably have been expected to take.', '17\\u2003The Majority awarded about INR 25 billion in damages for fraudulent misrepresentation after finding that BBA was liable for fraud under the Indian Contract Act 1872 (Act No 9 of 1872) (India) (\u201cIndian Contract Act\u201d). BAZ had not sought rescission but instead relied on s 19 of the Indian Contract Act to seek damages that would put it in the same positon as if the representation had been true. Section 19 states:', '18\\u2003The Majority stated that it was \u201cnot disputed\u201d that under Indian law, the measure of damages recoverable under the second limb of s 19 of the Indian Contract Act would be similar to those recoverable for fraudulent misrepresentation under general tort principles. The Majority relied on the Gujarat High Court decision in R C Thakkar v Gujarat Housing Board AIR 1973 Guj 34 (\u201cRC Thakkar (HC)\u201d) and the House of Lords decision of Smith New Court Securities Ltd v Citibank NA [1997] AC 254 (\u201cSmith New Court\u201d). The Majority noted that because both sides had indicated that the relevant principles were those in Smith New Court, \u201c[BAZ] is entitled to recover damages in a sum equal to the difference (if any) between what it paid for its C shares and any other direct losses less any benefits it has received. The object is to restore the Claimant to its position before the acquisition\u201d.', '19\\u2003We pause to make some observations on the nature of the problem the tribunal had to grapple with. The relevant events spanned a number of years and this caused temporal issues in the assessment of damages; a simple comparison of the purchase price for the C shares and sale of the Y Co shares over six years later may not have revealed BAZ\u2019s true losses. Further complexities arose in quantifying the loss as the Indian rupee (the denomination in which these transactions were carried out) was not stable, there was a foreign currency element involved as BAZ was a Japanese company, and historical interest rates also had to be considered.', '20\\u2003The Majority considered several approaches to quantifying damages:', '(a)\\u2003The approach proposed by BAZ\u2019s expert (\u201cDr Ball\u201d), which involved taking the difference between what BAZ paid for and eventually received in exchange for the Shares, less any benefits BAZ was able to obtain (including amounts recoverable through the sale of the Shares and any dividends).', '(b)\\u2003The discounted cash flow (\u201cDCF\u201d) method endorsed by the Sellers, which calculated the value of shares based on the present values of expected future cash flows.', '(c)\\u2003An alternative methodology proposed by the Sellers\u2019 expert, (\u201cDr Saunders\u201d), during his oral testimony, which linked any possible loss suffered by BAZ due to the Sellers\u2019 failure to disclose the Report to the settlement amount paid by C under the consent decree. This was premised on the incremental effect the Report potentially had on the final settlement sum of US$500 million, and on how much the purchase price paid for C would have been affected if the Report and its effect were known at the time of entering into the SPA.', '(d)\\u2003Two other methodologies modified from the Sellers\u2019 proposals. The first was the Sellers\u2019 \u201cSAR [ie, Self-Assessment Report] adjusted calculation\u201d, which took into account the incremental effect of the Report on share prices. The second was the Sellers\u2019 \u201cprincipled alternative market value approach\u201d, which considered the market price of the Shares in their \u201cdisaster-impregnated\u201d state in May 2013 with a premium for the controlling interest.', '21\\u2003The Majority held that Dr Ball\u2019s approach of quantifying loss and benefit and then setting them off was correct \u201cas a matter of principle\u201d, and in line with Smith New Court. However, it noted several difficulties and modified Dr Ball\u2019s method, by (a) using the closing date for the Merger instead of the Merger transaction date as proposed by Dr Ball as the relevant date for calculation, and (b) accounting for the 6-year time gap between the SPA and the Merger by calculating the \u201cpresent day value\u201d of money. Regarding the latter, the Majority applied a discount rate of 4.44% which was the midpoint of BAZ\u2019s Weighted Average Cost of Capital (\u201cWACC\u201d) (see [47] below for the Majority\u2019s calculations). The WACC represented the average rate of return that BAZ would seek to make from its investments. Using the WACC as a discount rate was in fact a suggestion by the Sellers\u2019 expert.', '22\\u2003Finally, the Majority reminded itself that damages awarded must not be contrary to the prohibition on \u201cpunitive, exemplary, multiple or consequential damages\u201d, and therefore benchmarked the sum awarded against the two alternative methods of calculation based on the Sellers\u2019 approaches. The SAR adjusted calculation yielded a figure of INR 8 billion and the principled alternative market value approach yielded INR 30 billion.', '23\\u2003Liability for damages was joint and several amongst all the Sellers, with no distinction made with respect to the Minors or the size of the respective shareholding of each seller.', '24\\u2003The Majority awarded pre-award interest of about INR 8 billion, being computed as simple interest of 4.44% per annum on the damages sum of INR 25 billion commencing from the date of closing of the SPA to the date of the Award. The Majority relied on cl 14.14.1 of the SPA (see [13] above) and s 20 of the IAA, which governs interest on awards. It stated that it was mindful of the danger of double counting in providing both for an adjustment to account for the present value of money using BAZ\u2019s WACC and also allowing interest from the date of closing. It ultimately concluded that these were \u201ctwo distinct matters\u201d, with the former concerned with the need to adjust for the present value of money and the latter to account for the fact that BAZ had borrowed money and committed its resources to acquiring the Shares at the expense of other matters. The 4.44% interest rate was arrived at having regard to the average of BAZ\u2019s WACC.', '25\\u2003On 17 May 2016, BAZ commenced simultaneous proceedings for leave to enforce the Award as a court judgment in New Delhi and in Singapore.', '26\\u2003Before the New Delhi High Court (\u201cthe DHC\u201d), both parties stated that the pendency of the Singapore proceedings would not prevent the DHC from adjudicating the enforcement proceedings in India. The DHC reserved judgment on 6 September 2017 and pronounced judgment on 31 January 2018 (\u201cthe DHC Judgment\u201d).', '27\\u2003The issues before the DHC were: (a) whether the damages awarded were contrary to s 19 of the Indian Contract Act and would shock the conscience of the court, (b) whether the Award granted consequential damages which were beyond the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, (c) whether the claim was barred by limitation, and (d) whether the pre-award interest amounted to an award of multiple damages. The DHC also considered whether the Award against the Minors was illegal, non est and void, and against the public policy of India.', '28\\u2003Nath J denied enforcement against the Minors on public policy grounds, but allowed enforcement against the remaining Sellers after deciding the above issues in favour of BAZ.', '29\\u2003As noted above, an ex parte leave order was made in Singapore on 18 May 2016. The Sellers applied to set aside that order on 15 September 2016. They also filed OS 784 and OS 787 to set aside the Award on 3 August 2016. The hearing was conducted in April 2018, and the Judge delivered her decision (\u201cthe Judgment\u201d) in December 2018.'"}

GL Thailand filed its accounts on a quarterly and annual basis and GLH\u2019s revenue, assets and profits were duly reflected in GL Thailand\u2019s quarterly and annual financial statements. In particular, over a period of just over two years which corresponded to the period of the alleged fraud, (ie, from 1Q2015 to 2Q2017), GL Thailand\u2019s reported quarterly net profits increased approximately 300% from 110,238,000 to 336,852,000 Thai Baht.

Some seven months after GL Thailand\u2019s clarificatory note, on 16 October 2017, the Commission issued a news release stating that GLH, a subsidiary of GL Thailand, had issued sham loans the interest on which was repaid using the loan principals under a round-tripping scheme designed to inflate GL Thailand\u2019s operating results. The borrowers included the Cyprus Borrowers and Cougar ie, the third to seventh respondents, who were allegedly owned and controlled ultimately by MK. The principal in the loans had been used by the Cyprus Borrowers and Cougar to repay the interest on the GLH Loans. That interest was recorded as income in GLH\u2019s 2016 financial statements, which was in turn a \u201cfabrication of accounting records and exaggeration of [GL Thailand\u2019s] operating results\u201d. As a result, the Commission lodged a criminal complaint against GL Thailand and banned MK from occupying directorships in Thai companies.', '21\\u2003After the Commission\u2019s news release, Ernst & Young, who was the independent auditor of GL Thailand and its subsidiaries, issued on 13 November 2017 a \u201cReport on Review of Interim Financial Information\u201d to the shareholders of GL Thailand (\u201cEY Interim Report\u201d) which revised GL Thailand\u2019s 2015, 2016, 1Q2017 and 2Q2017 profits and net assets downwards.

By way of background, at the time this action was commenced, NHPL\u2019s assets comprised:', '(a)\\u2003more than 27 million shares in Sino-America Tours Corporation Pte Ltd (\u201cSA Tours\u201d), which made NHPL the majority shareholder of SA Tours; and', '(b)\\u2003an apartment at Cairnhill Road (\u201cthe Cairnhill Apartment\u201d), which served as the family home for the appellant, the respondent and Ms Wu since 1991 (see the Judgment at [8]).', '5\\u2003The litigation representatives advanced two claims in respect of the NHPL Shares:', '(a)\\u2003First, they submitted that the respondent holds the NHPL Shares on a resulting trust for the appellant (\u201cthe resulting trust claim\u201d).', '(b)\\u2003Second, and in the alternative, the litigation representatives submitted that the respondent is in breach of contract as she failed to provide the $1m consideration stipulated on the share transfer form (\u201cthe contractual claim\u201d).', '6\\u2003Both claims were dismissed by the High Court judge (\u201cthe Judge\u201d) in their entirety. In essence, the Judge found that the $1m consideration represented loans which the appellant had extended to the respondent, and household expenses which she had incurred over their many years of cohabitation. When these loans and payments were made, the respondent did not envisage that they would be applied towards the NHPL Shares. Thus, the $1m consideration was past consideration which does not amount to valid consideration in law (see the Judgment at [26]\u2013[31]).', '7\\u2003Since the respondent did not provide any consideration for the NHPL Shares, a presumption of resulting trust arose in favour of the appellant. However, this presumption was rebutted by the respondent. The Judge, having thoroughly considered the entirety of the evidence, found that the appellant intended to benefit the respondent in transferring the NHPL Shares. The appellant had transferred both the legal and beneficial interest in the NHPL Shares to the respondent (see the Judgment at [159]).', '8\\u2003Turning to the contractual claim, since there was no consideration provided by the respondent, there was no contract formed between the parties. Thus, the respondent could not be in breach of contract (see the Judgment at [175]).', '9\\u2003Having carefully considered the parties\u2019 arguments, we are amply satisfied that the Judge did not err in dismissing both the resulting trust claim and the contractual claim. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal. These are the brief grounds for our decision.'"}
{"casename":"2020_SGCA_56","fact":"'8\\u2003We begin our narrative by setting out the parties\u2019 respective versions of the events on 25 November 2015, which was the day on which Dr Wee allegedly outraged V\u2019s modesty. V was a 23-year-old student at a local tertiary institution at the time of the alleged offences. Dr Wee was a 65-year-old general medical practitioner at that time and V\u2019s regular doctor. According to V, on 25 November 2015, she experienced gastric discomfort and consulted Dr Wee in the late afternoon. Dr Wee spoke to her briefly in the consultation room before directing her to the examination room in his medical clinic. The examination room could only be accessed through the consultation room, and the two rooms were separated by a sliding door. The examination room had a bed for patients to lie on during an examination.', '9\\u2003Dr Wee instructed V to unbuckle and unzip her jeans to enable him to check her pelvic area and she complied. He began by palpating V\u2019s lower abdominal area and then pressed on the \u201cjoint area\u201d near V\u2019s groin and remarked that there was a lump. V claimed that Dr Wee proceeded to press on V\u2019s vagina over her panties using the fingers of his right hand and said \u201cokay, okay\u201d while he was doing so. V replied \u201cokay\u201d because there was no pain. Dr Wee then allegedly slid his right hand under V\u2019s panties and started stroking her vagina with his right fingers in an up and down motion. He then asked V to sit up, and as she did so, he continued stroking V\u2019s vagina with his right fingers. After some time, V heard Dr Wee say \u201cokay\u201d before withdrawing his right hand. They both then returned to the consultation room.', '10\\u2003V claimed that she thought Dr Wee\u2019s actions were \u201cweird\u201d because this was the first time someone of the opposite gender had touched her at her vaginal area. She said she felt \u201cuneasy\u201d because Dr Wee was standing very close to her (GD at [19]). However, she said nothing because she assumed that these actions were all part of the medical examination.', '11\\u2003Unknown to Dr Wee, V subsequently scheduled an appointment on 5 December 2015 at a polyclinic ostensibly to have the lump in her groin area checked. She asked to see a female doctor and was attended to by Dr Sheena K Gendeh Jekinder Singh (\u201cDr Sheena\u201d). She told Dr Sheena that a lump was suspected near her groin. Dr Sheena checked and found that there was indeed a lump, at which point V felt assured that what Dr Wee had previously done to her was, after all, part of a legitimate medical examination. However, the logic behind this was not evident to us since Dr Wee had apparently observed the presence of the lump well before allegedly venturing to touch V in her vaginal area both over and under her panties. We are also unable to fathom how those actions could have been in any way connected with the lump, and we will elaborate on this later in this judgment. We digress to note that on 20 April 2018, the Prosecution obtained a copy of the report from the polyclinic as to what had transpired (\u201cthe Polyclinic Record\u201d). This showed that V visited Dr Sheena complaining of \u201cpain over the left groin area for 3 days\u201d. There is nothing in the Polyclinic Record to suggest that V had visited the polyclinic in order to check on a lump that was already suspected as V maintained, or to verify what Dr Wee had said of the lump, or even to suggest that V had mentioned her earlier consultation with Dr Wee to Dr Sheena. The Prosecution did not disclose the Polyclinic Record to the Defence until 7 May 2018, by which time V had already completed giving evidence at the trial.', '12\\u2003Dr Wee denied that he had outraged V\u2019s modesty during the consultation on 25 November 2015. He claimed that V complained of gastric pain and phlegm, and he first performed a routine check of V\u2019s blood pressure, heart and lungs. He then directed V to the examination room and palpated her abdominal area, which was the standard abdominal examination he would have performed on all his patients in these circumstances. After the examination, he prescribed some medication for phlegm and gastritis and V left the consultation room. Dr Wee\u2019s clinic notes did not record any observation of a lump found at V\u2019s groin area.', '13\\u2003We turn to the events that led to the Rape Charge. We begin with V\u2019s version of the events. On the morning of 30 December 2015, V felt an itch at her genital area and noticed that she was urinating frequently. She went to a polyclinic in the afternoon to see a doctor but found it was very crowded, as a result of which, she would have a long wait. She then scheduled an appointment with Dr Wee\u2019s clinic for around 11.00pm on the same day. She had not seen Dr Wee since her last visit on 25 November 2015.', '14\\u2003V was eventually attended to by Dr Wee at about 11.50pm and there were two more patients waiting to see him after her. She entered the consultation room and informed Dr Wee of her symptoms. Dr Wee directed her to the examination room. V lay down on the examination bed and Dr Wee examined and palpated her abdomen area. He then pushed V\u2019s shorts lower with his hands and began examining her pelvic area. He allegedly pressed on the same \u201cjoint area\u201d as he had done on 25 November 2015 and again told her that there was a lump. Using his right fingers, Dr Wee then rubbed V\u2019s vagina in an up and down motion over her panties. He asked V if this was where she felt the itch and she confirmed this.', '15\\u2003He then asked V to pull down her shorts and panties. V did so to her thigh level which she thought was low enough to enable Dr Wee to conduct a genital examination. However, Dr Wee asked V to remove them completely. As V hesitated, he proceeded to remove her shorts and panties and placed them next to her left leg. V testified that she felt \u201cvery naked at that point in time\u201d but said nothing because she thought this was just part of the medical examination.', '16\\u2003Dr Wee positioned V on the examination bed such that her legs were apart and he was standing between them. He then grabbed V\u2019s legs and moved her to her right. V\u2019s buttocks and left thigh were still on the examination bed but her right leg was hanging off the bed and supported by Dr Wee\u2019s hand. V weighed about 48kg and was 1.64m tall at the material time.', '17\\u2003V heard the sound of a zipper and from the corner of her eyes, saw Dr Wee\u2019s hand move toward his zipper. She thought that Dr Wee must have forgotten to zip his pants. She did not question Dr Wee and was not provided any explanation of what he was doing to her. From her position, she could only see Dr Wee\u2019s upper chest and head. Her legs were supported at Dr Wee\u2019s waist level and he was firmly holding them below her knees. In this position, Dr Wee pulled V towards him and she felt \u201csomething horizontal\u201d poke into her vagina. V saw Dr Wee\u2019s body moving forward and backward with each poking sensation, while his hands were holding V\u2019s legs below her knees at all times. After a few moments, V told Dr Wee that she felt pain. He then released V\u2019s legs, and at the same time, moved his hands to support her lower back and pulled her closer to him in a \u201chalf-seated\u201d position. V tried to stabilise herself by resting her right toes on the top of the photocopier that was in the examination room. She also felt something push deeper into her vagina and when she looked down, she saw Dr Wee\u2019s penis partially inside her vagina. She was shocked and put up her left hand as a gesture to Dr Wee to stop.', '18\\u2003Dr Wee then withdrew his penis and let go of V. He turned his back to her and she again heard the sound of a zipper. V put on her shorts and panties and got off the examination bed. Both V and Dr Wee then returned to the consultation room. V testified that she was in a state of shock. She said that she was functioning at that point on \u201cauto-pilot\u201d and was merely going \u201cthrough the motions\u201d. Before leaving the consultation room, V requested medication to delay the onset of her period as she was about to leave on a school trip. She went to the toilet after leaving the consultation room. As there was no toilet paper available, she used her panty liner to wipe herself and saw streaks of blood on her panty liner. She could not find a bin to dispose of the panty liner and so held it in her hand.', '19\\u2003V returned to the waiting area and collected her medication, which included some medication that she was allergic to. As V was walking home from the clinic, she disposed of her stained panty liner in a bin outside a coffee shop. V arrived home at about 1.00am on 31 December 2015. All her family members were asleep. V then took a shower because she \u201cfelt very dirty\u201d as a result of what Dr Wee had done to her. V threw the panties that she had been wearing into a pail of water. V was not able to sleep that night as she felt \u201cnumb\u201d and \u201cconfused\u201d and tried to \u201cregister what [had] happened at the [clinic]\u201d.', '20\\u2003Dr Wee denied raping V. He also denied penetrating her vagina with his penis. According to Dr Wee, V presented with complaints of gastric reflux, frequent urination and cough. In the examination room, he performed the standard abdominal examination, and when he palpated V\u2019s left lower abdomen, V told him that there was discomfort. After Dr Wee told V that the abdominal examination was over, V mentioned, \u201cout of the blue\u201d, that she had a genital itch. Dr Wee was concerned that V might have PID which, if not treated early, could lead to infertility in young women. With V\u2019s express consent, Dr Wee proceeded to conduct a vaginal examination.', '21\\u2003Dr Wee instructed V to remove her shorts and panties, which she did. He observed slight redness around her vulva and a slight clear discharge on the right side of the lower vulva. Because of this, he thought PID might be a \u201cmuch more likely\u201d possibility. He asked V if he could conduct an internal pelvic examination to exclude PID and V agreed. Dr Wee informed V of what he was about to do and V had no complaints. According to Dr Wee, he wet his right fingers using his saliva and then inserted his right index and middle fingers deep into V\u2019s vagina towards V\u2019s right pelvic area to check for pain and discharge. V said there was no pain or discomfort. He then repeated this process in V\u2019s middle and left pelvic area, and V said that she felt a slight discomfort in both of these areas. He informed V that if the discomfort continued, V should go to a hospital for a check-up. He then told her the examination was over and V got up while he was withdrawing his fingers.', '22\\u2003After the examination, Dr Wee went back to the consultation room, washed his hands and started to record the medication to be prescribed to V. Before he finished, V came to the consultation room and requested medication to delay her period as she was about to leave for a school trip. Dr Wee testified that V was calm and relaxed when she returned to the consultation room. V did not raise any concern or make any complaint throughout the entire time that she was in the clinic. The clinic assistants also testified that V appeared to be calm and left the clinic after collecting her medication. Dr Wee attended to another three patients or so, and then left the clinic for his home at around 12.40am on 31 December 2015.', '23\\u2003We next outline the events that led to Dr Wee\u2019s arrest. V\u2019s mother woke up around 4.30am on 31 December 2015 and went into V\u2019s room to retrieve some clothes. She saw V tossing in her bed and asked her why she was not asleep. At around 5.00am, they spoke in the living room. V informed her mother that she had visited Dr Wee\u2019s clinic, and questioned her mother as to the circumstances in which a doctor could properly \u201ccheck a patient\u2019s private parts\u201d. V also told her mother that Dr Wee had taken something and \u201cpoked [her]\u201d in her private part and that she felt violated as a result. V said nothing about Dr Wee having inserted his penis into her vagina. V\u2019s mother asked whether Dr Wee had been on top of her and when V replied that he had not been, and that he had used something to poke her, she told V that it was a \u201c50\/50 situation\u201d. It appeared from V\u2019s testimony at trial that what her mother meant by this was that it was not clear whether he had or had not done anything improper. The conversation lasted about 20 minutes.', '24\\u2003V told her mother that she intended to make a police report and left home at around 5.30am for this purpose. V\u2019s mother left for work thereafter and did not accompany V to the police station. V arrived at the police station at about 6.00am and filed a First Information Report at 9.24am. Two police officers accompanied V back to her home and seized the clothing that she was wearing at the material time (including her panties that were still soaking in the pail of water).', '25\\u2003At about 1.41pm on 31 December 2015, three officers from the Serious Sexual Crimes Branch of the Singapore Police Force arrived at Dr Wee\u2019s clinic and seized Dr Wee\u2019s case notes on V. The officers took photographs of the clinic and obtained Dr Wee\u2019s blood sample for DNA profiling. At around 4.05pm on the same day, the officers proceeded to Dr Wee\u2019s home where they arrested him and seized all the clothing that he had been wearing at the time of the alleged offences. The items seized from V and from Dr Wee were sent to the Health Sciences Authority for testing. Nothing incriminating was found in this regard.', '26\\u2003On the same day, V was brought to KK Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Hospital (\u201cKKH\u201d) where she was examined by Dr Janice Tung Su Zhen (\u201cDr Tung\u201d) at 4.35pm. Dr Tung issued a report dated 26 January 2016 (\u201cDr Tung\u2019s Report\u201d), in which she stated that there were two small superficial midline split-skin wounds in the posterior fourchette area of V\u2019s vagina and a very shallow fresh tear of the hymen. Dr Tung\u2019s testified that the injuries found on V were consistent with either penile or digital penetration of the vagina.', '27\\u2003We turn to the evidence on Dr Wee\u2019s erectile function. In his further statement to the police on 1 January 2016 (\u201cFurther Statement\u201d), when asked whether he was suffering from ED, he answered in the negative. However, in his cautioned statement dated 16 February 2017 (\u201cCautioned Statement\u201d), he asserted that he did have ED at the time of the offence. At the trial, Dr Wee testified that he had suffered from ED for more than a year before his arrest and had a low sex drive, but had nonetheless been able to have sex with his wife about \u201conce or twice a month\u201d and was able to have penetrative sexual intercourse \u201cmost of the time\u201d.', '28\\u2003This was somewhat corroborated by Dr Wee\u2019s wife (\u201cMrs Wee\u201d), who testified that from 2014, there had been a decrease in the hardness of Dr Wee\u2019s erection. She claimed that in 2015, Dr Wee\u2019s penis was \u201csoft like a noodle\u201d, and every time they had sexual intercourse, he would need to use his hand to direct his penis into her vagina. She also claimed that Dr Wee was not always able to achieve an erection.', '29\\u2003Dr Wee underwent three separate medical examinations on his erectile function. The first was a doppler ultrasonography conducted at the request of Dr Peter Lim Huat Chye (\u201cDr Lim\u201d) on 5 January 2016. Dr Lim is a Senior Consultant and Medical Director of the Andrology, Urology & Continence Centre at Gleneagles Hospital. During Dr Wee\u2019s first consultation with Dr Lim on 5 January 2016, he informed Dr Lim that he had been suffering from ED for the past three years, and, in addition, that he had diabetes and hypertension. Dr Lim thought that Dr Wee might have vasculogenic ED, which is a condition of insufficient blood flow in the penile shaft. Dr Lim ordered a testosterone test and a doppler ultrasonography for Dr Wee. Dr Lim also conducted a transrectal ultrasound and an uroflowmetry examination. The former confirmed that Dr Wee had an enlarged prostate gland, and the latter suggested that Dr Wee had a bladder outlet obstruction. The doppler ultrasonography was conducted by Dr Gan Yu Unn (\u201cDr Gan\u201d), a consultant radiologist at the Andrology, Urology and Continence Centre, on 13 January 2016. Dr Gan injected 10 micrograms of Caverject, a chemical to help Dr Wee achieve maximum erection. An observing probe which sat transversely on the penis was used to measure Dr Wee\u2019s penile blood flow. In Dr Gan\u2019s report dated 13 January 2016 (\u201cthe First Doppler Report\u201d), Dr Gan concluded that Dr Wee had bilateral varicoceles, which is the enlargement of the veins within the scrotum, and that there was no evidence of \u201carterial insufficiency or venous leak\u201d. The clinical laboratory report dated 5 January 2016 from Parkway Laboratory Services Limited showed that the accused\u2019s testosterone levels were in the low range of normality. Dr Lim summarised the results of the transrectal ultrasound, the uroflowmetry examination, the testosterone test and the doppler ultrasonography in a medical report dated 8 March 2016.', '30\\u2003More importantly, in a medical memorandum to Asia Health Partners dated 13 January 2016 (\u201cDr Lim\u2019s Report\u201d), Dr Lim reported that Dr Wee was able \u201cto erect only 50 \u2013 60% [and could not] maintain\u201d an erection, and had a maximum Erection Hardness Score (\u201cEHS\u201d) of three out of four, which could not be sustained. An EHS of three meant that the \u201cpenis [was] hard enough for penetration but not completely hard\u201d. An EHS of four would signify that the \u201cpenis [was] completely hard and fully rigid\u201d. In contrast, an EHS of two meant that the \u201cpenis [was] hard but not hard enough for penetration\u201d while an EHS of one meant that the \u201cpenis [was] larger but not hard\u201d. At the trial, Dr Lim said he was surprised that the First Doppler Report showed that Dr Wee had no vasculogenic ED, which was contrary to his diagnosis. Dr Lim also explained that he arrived at an EHS of three by asking Dr Wee to elaborate on the maximum erection that he could have achieved during their consultation on 5 January 2016.', '31\\u2003On 22 March 2016, at the direction of the police, Dr Wee saw Dr Teo Jin Kiat (\u201cDr Teo\u201d), a Consultant Urologist at Changi General Hospital. Dr Teo initially prepared a report based on the results of the First Doppler Report. He was then informed by the police that a second penile doppler ultrasonography was required and this was ordered on 22 April 2016. It was carried out by Dr Wong Kai Min (\u201cDr Wong\u201d), a Consultant at Changi General Hospital. In his report (\u201cthe Second Doppler Report\u201d), Dr Wong stated that a full erection was not achieved and Dr Wee\u2019s penile shaft was flexible at his best-achieved erection. We digress to observe that the Prosecution did not disclose the Second Doppler Report to Dr Wee until 21 September 2018, which was after Dr Wee had given his evidence. We found this unsatisfactory because: (a) this had been requested by the police who must have considered it relevant; and (b) it was plainly material to the Defence. We will elaborate on this later.', '32\\u2003On 7 June 2018, after the conclusion of Dr Wee\u2019s cross-examination, he underwent a haemodynamic test for erectile function administrated by Dr Sriram Narayanan (\u201cDr Sriram\u201d), a Senior Consultant, Vascular and Endovascular Surgeon at Gleneagles Hospital and Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. The haemodynamic test was conducted by injecting 20 micrograms of Caverject. In Dr Sriram\u2019s report dated 7 June 2018 (\u201cthe Haemodynamic Report\u201d), he stated that Dr Wee had significant bilateral venous leak, and could only achieve an EHS of one after ten minutes, with no improvement at 20 minutes. At the trial, Dr Sriram testified that Dr Wee essentially achieved \u201cno erection\u201d after an injection of 20 micrograms of Caverject. Dr Sriram also explained that the haemodynamic test was \u201cmore accurate\u201d than the doppler ultrasonography and may pick up results that the latter did not. This is because there is difficulty in keeping the observing probe stable in a doppler ultrasonography and there is an intrinsic risk of variations due to the observer.', '33\\u2003It appears that the findings of the First Doppler Report were not consistent with the Second Doppler Report, while the latter was more consistent with the Haemodynamic Report. It may also be noted that the First Doppler Report was based on a test conducted a week or so after the alleged rape offence, while the Second Doppler Report was based on a test done about three months later. The Haemodynamic Report was based on a test done some 2\u00bd years after the alleged offences. According to Dr Sriram, the First Doppler Report suggested that Dr Wee had an erectile function of a typical 16-year-old who had varicoceles (meaning, the enlargement of the veins within the scrotum). Dr Sriram thought this was \u201cstrange\u201d because Dr Wee, who was 65-years-old at the time of the alleged offences would be expected to have some degree of ED. Further, the First Doppler Report was inconsistent with Dr Lim\u2019s Report, which reflected that Dr Wee could only achieve 50-60% erection. Dr Teo, on the other hand, was not troubled by the results reflected in the First Doppler Report because he thought that it was possible that someone of Dr Wee\u2019s age and presenting with his medical conditions could obtain a \u201cperfect score\u201d. Both Dr Teo and Dr Sriram agreed that the Second Doppler Report, which reflected that Dr Wee\u2019s penile shaft was flexible at his best-achieved erection, would have obtained an EHS score of between two and three. They also agreed that Dr Wee\u2019s condition as reflected in the Second Doppler Report would have existed well before April 2016, and they therefore concluded that the two Doppler Reports could not be reconciled with each other. Dr Sriram was also of the view that the Second Doppler Report was more consistent with his findings in the Haemodynamic Report, which showed a progression of Dr Wee\u2019s ED.'"}

{"casename":"2020_SGCA_58","fact":"the facts. In our \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLow Yin Ni v Tay Yuan Wei Jaycie[2020] SGCA 58\n3judgment, the Judge erred in that on the evidence before the court it was clear \nthat the presumption of advancement was amply rebutted.\n5 In Lau Siew Kim v Yeo Guan Chye Terence and another [2008] 2 \nSLR(R) 108 at [78], this court noted that the key inquiry when considering the \npresumption of advancement is in substance directed at discerning the presumed \nintention of the transferor. This is plainly correct. After all where the \ntransferor\u2019s intention has been explicitly articulated there will generally be no \nroom for invoking any presumption in this regard. Hence the presumption \noperates in circumstances where on the face of the transaction, the transferor \nappears to have paid for the acquisition of an interest in property in the name of \na third party or to have transferred some interest in property to a third party. The \nlaw deals with these situations with a pair of presumptive positions. Where there \nis no relationship between the parties, in general it is presumed that the payer or \nthe transferor, as the case may be, intended to retain the beneficial interest in \nthe property and this is achieved by the device of a presumption of resulting \ntrust. The effect of this is that the transferee or recipient is constituted a trustee \nof the property for the benefit of the transferor or the payer. But in certain \ncircumstances, in particular where the transaction occurs in the context of \ncertain recognised categories of relationships, one of which is that between \nparents and their children, the presumption of advancement operates to rebut \nthe presumed resulting trust and it rests on the notion that the parents intended \nto benefit the child in question by the transaction. This is so because in these \ncategories of cases, parties do often act in line with such a presumptive intention \nto benefit their children. However, this is no more than a rough and ready guide \nand is not meant to be approached rigidly. On the contrary this is a flexible \ndoctrine that is designed to guide the court in its ultimate inquiry into just what \nthe parties intended rather than operating as a strict rule. It follows from this \nthat the strength of the presumption will vary based on the prevailing \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLow Yin Ni v Tay Yuan Wei Jaycie[2020] SGCA 58\n4circumstances of the case, with key elements in the inquiry including in \nparticular the nature and state of the relationship between the parties. This \nmakes perfect sense, of course, because if the basis of the presumption is the \nfact of the relationship, then the state of that relationship will have a bearing on \nthe strength of the presumption and the amount of evidence required to rebut it. \nAlso specific to the parent-child context, the number of children the parent has \nmight be another of the factors which the court will take into account in \nassessing the strength of the presumption. These are not necessarily meant to \nconstrain the inquiry, which should really be concerned with examining all the \nsurrounding and relevant circumstances. Included among these is the \nplausibility of the intention to make a gift having regard to the financial status \nof the parties at the relevant time.\n6 Against that backdrop, we turn to the facts before us. At the outset, it \nmay be noted that this case was plagued with certain difficulties because of the \nway in which it arose and was approached by the parties. The context in which \nthe issue arose was this: the respondents became spouses and then became co-\nregistered proprietors of the Flat which had been acquired by the appellants \nearlier. When the respondents subsequently embarked on matrimonial \nproceedings leading to their divorce, it became necessary to determine what if \nany interest they each had in the Flat. This was relevant at two levels: first, to \nthe extent they each had an interest arising directly from any monetary \ncontribution that they had made, the first respondent was keen to realise her \nshare given the divorce; and second, if either of the respondents otherwise \nacquired a share, that too could fall to be divided as part of the matrimonial \nassets in the divorce. Indeed, as counsel for the first respondent, Mr Mohammad \nShafiq, candidly accepted before us, his client was seeking to maximise the size \nof the pool of matrimonial assets for the purposes of the ancillary matrimonial \nproceedings. In that light, it was significant in our judgment that the second \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLow Yin Ni v Tay Yuan Wei Jaycie[2020] SGCA 58\n5respondent did not participate in the proceedings below. The appellants were \ntherefore principally concerned with meeting the first respondent\u2019s claim to \nsome share in the Flat. Among the positions the appellants took before the Judge \nwas a contention that that they did not know about or remember signing the \ntransfer forms. The Judge rejected this, in our view, correctly. However, the \nappellants did not also contend, in the alternative, that even if they had agreed \nto the addition of the respondents as joint owners, they never intended in effect \nto gift a half share in the Flat to the respondents so that each person\u2019s share in \nthe Flat would thereafter be a quarter, or indeed a third share to their son. \nBecause of their focus on the first respondent\u2019s claims, the appellants\u2019 \nsubmissions before the Judge addressed the calculations of the respondents\u2019 \nalleged financial contributions to the purchase price of the Flat, which was \nmaterial to the first respondent\u2019s claim that was founded primarily on a resulting \ntrust analysis;1 but given the passive role of the second respondent, the \nappellants never dealt with the application of the presumption of advancement \nin relation to the second respondent, or indeed what his beneficial ownership in \nthe Flat should be. The Judge might have been assisted if she had considered \ninviting submissions on these points before ruling on the latter question of the \npresumption of advancement in favour of the second respondent as she did. In \nour judgment, this contributed to what we consider was her implausible ruling \nthat left the appellants potentially losing a third of their principal asset to the \nsecond respondent and through that potentially some part to the first respondent \nthrough the matrimonial proceedings.\n7 We turn to the surrounding circumstances, which the Judge did not \nadequately take into consideration.\n1 Record of Proceedings (\u201cROP\u201d) Vol 4A, p 30 at para 6.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLow Yin Ni v Tay Yuan Wei Jaycie[2020] SGCA 58\n68 In this case, it is clear on the evidence that any presumption of \nadvancement in favour of the second respondent at the time he was added as a \nregistered co-owner of the Flat would have been an extremely weak one. In her \naffidavit at para 13, the second appellant set out some critical background to the \nmarriage between the respondents. Amongst other things, she was unhappy that \nher son had chosen to marry the second respondent who was a divorcee with \ntwo children from a previous marriage to a convicted offender. Her disapproval \nof the proposed union between the respondent was so vehement that she refused \neven to attend the registration ceremony of their marriage. In these \ncircumstances, it does not seem to us conceivable that the presumption of \nadvancement could be said to apply such that in adding the respondents as co-\nregistered proprietors, the appellants should be taken to have intended thereby \nto confer on the second respondent an equal share in the Flat. Mr Mohammad \nShafiq submitted that the issue should be approached by reference to what was \nhappening at the time of the transfer. In this case, that took place slightly more \nthan a year after the marriage. The respondents lived with the appellants during \nthat time. We agree that the material time would be the time of the transfer, but \nit is impossible to read too much into the fact that the parties had all been living \ntogether for that brief period. In truth, it seems that they were trying to make the \nbest of a difficult situation. The real question in the end is what was likely to be \nthe operating motive behind the transaction? This leads us to the second critical \npoint.\n9 It is a point of importance that aside from the difficulties in the \nrelationship between the appellants and the respondents arising from the \nconcerns they harboured over the first respondent in particular, the appellants\u2019 \nfinancial circumstances at the time of the transfer were such that it would not \nhave been consistent with any intention on their part to make a gift of a \nsubstantial part of what was in truth their principal asset. From the time of their \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLow Yin Ni v Tay Yuan Wei Jaycie[2020] SGCA 58\n7initial purchase of the Flat in 1999, the appellants had faced persistent \ndifficulties in making payments on the mortgage. These payments were made \nirregularly and were often missed or insufficient to even cover the interest \ncomponent of the mortgage. This caused the balance of the mortgage to increase \nin the years between 1999 and 2010.2 Given these financial realities, we do not \nsee how the appellants could realistically have contemplated making a gift of a \nquarter or a third of their beneficial interest in the Flat to the second respondent. \nRather, it appears to us that what was really happening was precisely as the first \nrespondent claimed in her affidavit: namely that the respondents were added as \nlegal co-owners of the Flat to enable them to use their moneys in the Central \nProvident Fund to help pay down part of the mortgage because of the appellants\u2019 \ndire financial straits.3\n10 For these reasons, we are satisfied that the presumption of advancement \nin favour of the second respondent was amply rebutted in the circumstances. In \nthe absence of any evidence that the parties are to hold the beneficial interest in \na proportion different from their respective contributions to the purchase price, \nthe presumption of resulting trust applies."}

{"casename":"2020_SGCA_62","fact":"'5\\u2003Mr Ivanishvili became a customer of the Bank in Switzerland in 2004. It is his case that sometime in December 2004, the Bank\u2019s representatives approached him with an offer to provide private wealth management services to him and his family. The Bank\u2019s advice was that he should set up a trust to be administered by the Trustee in Singapore. Mr Ivanishvili accepted this advice. The Mandalay Trust was then established by the Trustee pursuant to a declaration of trust dated 7 March 2005. The trust deed of the Mandalay Trust (\u201cthe Trust Deed\u201d) contained a clause providing for the trust to be governed by Singapore law, and for the Singapore courts to be its forum of administration (\u201ccl 2(a)\u201d).', '6\\u2003In March 2005, Mr Ivanishvili settled some US$1.1bn on the Mandalay Trust. Half of this sum was held in an account (\u201cthe Soothsayer account\u201d) with the Bank\u2019s Singapore branch in the name of a Bahamian company, Soothsayer Ltd (\u201cSoothsayer\u201d), and the other half was held in accounts (\u201cthe Meadowsweet accounts\u201d) with the Bank\u2019s Geneva branch in the name of a BVI company, Meadowsweet Assets Ltd (\u201cMeadowsweet\u201d). Both these companies were wholly owned and controlled by the Trustee. The sums held in the Soothsayer account were gradually repatriated by Mr Ivanishvili to accounts at the Bank in Switzerland. The Soothsayer account was closed in 2014.', '7\\u2003The Trustee delegated its asset management and investment powers under the Mandalay Trust to the Bank pursuant to discretionary portfolio management agreements with Soothsayer and Meadowsweet. The Bank therefore managed the assets in the Mandalay Trust (\u201cthe Trust assets\u201d) and provided investment reports detailing their performance to the Trustee (\u201cthe Investment Reports\u201d). It is also undisputed that the Bank performed these tasks primarily at its Geneva branch. Mr Ivanishvili\u2019s relationship manager at the Bank was, initially, Ms Daria Mihaesco (\u201cMs Mihaesco\u201d). Mr Lescaudron took over as the relationship manager in August 2006.', '8\\u2003Mr Ivanishvili frequently communicated directly with Mr Lescaudron on the management of the Trust assets, either personally or through his representative Mr George Bachiashvili (\u201cMr Bachiashvili\u201d). Pursuant to cl 10(b) of the Trust Deed, Mr Ivanishvili had the right to choose an investment manager to make decisions in relation to the investment of the Trust assets. Initially, Mr Ivanishvili appointed himself as investment manager. Subsequently, in December 2013, he also appointed Mr Bachiashvili as investment manager.', '9\\u2003Besides the Mandalay Trust, Mr Ivanishvili\u2019s relationship with the Bank and its associates also extended to numerous other accounts and offshore structures, many of which have also given rise to disputes:', '(a)\\u2003Mr Ivanishvili held accounts with the Bank in his own name, as well as in the name of Wellminstone SA, a BVI company of which he was the ultimate beneficial owner (\u201cthe Wellminstone accounts\u201d).', '(b)\\u2003An account was held with the Bank by Sandcay Investment Limited (\u201cSandcay\u201d), under the Green Vals Trust. Mr Ivanishvili transferred assets of more than US$210m to this account in early 2015. The beneficiaries of the Green Vals Trust are the appellants. The current trustee of the Green Vals Trust is Credit Suisse Trust Limited (New Zealand), a subsidiary of Credit Suisse Trust AG.', '(c)\\u2003An account with Credit Suisse Life (Bermuda) Ltd (\u201cCS Life\u201d) held investments made on a premium of US$480m paid for a life insurance policy obtained by Meadowsweet, as well as another life insurance policy obtained by Sandcay (\u201cthe CS Life policies\u201d).', '10\\u2003On 5 July 2013, the Trustee amended the Trust Deed by way of a Deed of Amendment and Restatement (\u201cthe Amended Trust Deed\u201d). The validity of the Amended Trust Deed is one of the issues in Suit 790.', '11\\u2003According to Mr Ivanishvili, Mr Lescaudron sent him and Mr Bachiashvili regular reports summarising the performance of Mr Ivanishvili\u2019s investments, including the Trust assets, together with spreadsheets setting out the current value of each of Mr Ivanishvili\u2019s accounts (\u201cthe Direct Reports\u201d). The Direct Reports were distinct from the Investment Reports from the Bank, which were made available to the Trustee.', '12\\u2003In September and October 2015, the Bank made margin calls totalling US$45.89m on the accounts within the Mandalay Trust. Following one of the margin calls, another representative of the Bank sent Mr Ivanishvili copies of some of the Investment Reports. Mr Ivanishvili claims that this was the first time he had seen these Investment Reports, and having compared them with the Direct Reports from Mr Lescaudron, he realised that the value of the Trust assets as reported by Mr Lescaudron was very different from the reality. According to Mr Ivanishvili, the Investment Reports showed that from 31 December 2014 to 25 September 2015 the value of the Trust assets had declined from US$697.68m to US$437.8m; on the other hand, the Direct Reports from Mr Lescaudron in this period showed an upward trend in the value of the Trust assets.', '13\\u2003The other accounts with the Bank which belonged to Mr Ivanishvili had also suffered similar previously undisclosed losses. In this regard, on 2 April 2015, Mr Lescaudron sent a presentation on behalf of the Bank to Mr Bachiashvili (\u201cthe Presentation\u201d), stating that the Bank held a total of US$1.04bn in all the trusts set up by Mr Ivanishvili, including US$439m in the Mandalay Trust, when according to Mr Ivanishvili\u2019s calculations the true value of the Trust assets at the time would have been around US$326.9m. Mr Ivanishvili alleged that the incorrect figures from the Presentation were then repeated to him by representatives of the Trustee at discussions and meetings in the subsequent months. According to Mr Ivanishvili, as a result of these representations by the Bank and the Trustee, he was persuaded to transfer further assets from other banks to be managed and invested by the Bank.', '14\\u2003In December 2015, the Bank made a criminal complaint against Mr Lescaudron in Switzerland for offences relating to assets under his management. Similar criminal complaints were also made by, inter alia, Mr Ivanishvili and Meadowsweet. Criminal charges were brought against Mr Lescaudron, and following a trial in the Swiss Correctional Court, Mr Lescaudron was convicted on 9 February 2018 on charges of embezzlement, misappropriation and forgery. Mr Lescaudron was sentenced to five years\u2019 imprisonment, and his assets ordered to be confiscated and applied towards compensating the victims of his fraud. However, the extent of such recovery, if any, has not been made known in the present proceedings. Appeals against the court\u2019s decision by the Bank, Mr Lescaudron, and other customers are said to be pending. The progress and outcome of such appeals has not been made known in the present proceedings.', '15\\u2003The appellants entered into representation agreements in order to allow them to act on behalf of Meadowsweet to sue the Bank for any losses suffered by the Mandalay Trust, or to sue CS Life in Bermuda for the same, as well as to act on behalf of Sandcay to bring claims in relation to losses suffered by the Green Vals Trust.', '16\\u2003The appellants have not filed any civil suit against the Bank or the Trustee in Switzerland, nor did Mr Ivanishvili file any civil claim in the criminal proceedings against Mr Lescaudron. The appellants have told us that they are willing to confirm that they will not bring any proceedings in Switzerland (either in their own names or on behalf of Meadowsweet or Soothsayer) against the Bank in respect of losses caused to the Mandalay Trust until the conclusion of Suit 790 (other than protective steps to guard against the expiry of limitation periods).', '17\\u2003The appellants commenced a claim in New Zealand against the Bank and the current and former trustees of the Green Vals Trust on 7 August 2017, in respect of the losses suffered by that trust. The New Zealand High Court held that Switzerland was the appropriate forum for the case to be tried. The appellants say that they have decided not to appeal against the decision of the New Zealand High Court.', '18\\u2003The appellants, Meadowsweet and Sandcay commenced a claim in Bermuda against CS Life on 17 August 2017 in respect of the losses suffered by the CS Life policies as a result of CS Life\u2019s conduct. These proceedings have not been stayed. Although the CS Life policy obtained by Meadowsweet is a part of the Mandalay Trust and therefore also the subject of Suit 790, the appellants have undertaken to give credit in Suit 790 for any recovery obtained in Bermuda, and not to seek double recovery.', '19\\u2003The existing Statement of Claim in Suit 790 is framed against both the Bank and the Trustee.', '(a)\\u2003Against the Trustee, the appellants alleged that:', '(b)\\u2003Against the Bank, the appellants alleged that:', '20\\u2003Neither the Bank nor the Trustee filed a defence in Suit 790. Instead, they each filed an application for a stay of the proceedings. As we have noted, the AR granted the stay on the basis that Switzerland was the more appropriate forum and this decision was upheld by the Judge on appeal.', '21\\u2003The first issue considered by the Judge was whether the Bank and the Trustee had accepted the exclusive jurisdiction of the Singapore courts in respect of disputes with the appellants. She held that forum administration clauses like cl 2(a) were relevant for some kinds of disputes arising out of the trust, but did not serve as an exclusive jurisdiction clause for all disputes relating to the trust (the Judgment at [28] and [43]\u2013[44]). This was particularly true of the disputes in Suit 790 between the appellants and the Bank \u2013 cl 2(a) could not in any way be said to bind the Bank, and the allegations in the Statement of Claim went beyond the Mandalay Trust and included Mr Ivanishvili\u2019s personal accounts and the Wellminstone accounts (the Judgment at [44]\u2013[46]). In this connection, the Judge pointed out that there was a different contractual exclusive jurisdiction clause which was binding as between Mr Ivanishvili and the Bank, stipulating Geneva as the exclusive forum, but this was likewise not dispositive as the other appellants were not privy to this clause (the Judgment at [47]\u2013[54]).', '22\\u2003The Judge therefore went on to consider the two-stage test from Spiliada Maritime Corporation v Cansulex Ltd [1987] AC 460 (\u201cSpiliada\u201d) in order to determine the appropriate forum. At the first stage, the Judge held that the governing law of the dispute was not determinative, since the trust-related claims were governed by Singapore law, while the negligence and misrepresentation claims were governed by Swiss law (the Judgment at [55]\u2013[58]). The location of the evidence and the ease of trial, on the other hand, were found to point firmly in favour of Switzerland: the oral testimony of Mr Lescaudron was critical to the defendants\u2019 defence, but he was non- compellable in Singapore, as were the other European witnesses who were not or were no longer linked to the Bank; likewise, Swiss documents may not be available in Singapore proceedings due to Swiss banking secrecy laws (the Judgment at [59]\u2013[64]). Finally, the \u201cshape of the litigation\u201d was found to point in favour of Switzerland, as the claims and remedies pleaded were essentially focused on the entirety of the Bank\u2019s conduct in its banking relationship with Mr Ivanishvili, which was the subject of the contractual exclusive jurisdiction clause in favour of Geneva (the Judgment at [69]\u2013[70]).', '23\\u2003Turning to the second stage of the Spiliada test, the Judge found that there were no reasons of justice militating against a stay. In particular, the loss of juridical advantages by bringing the claims in Switzerland was not sufficient to constitute a denial of justice (the Judgment at [74]). It was also inappropriate to order a stay only in respect of the claims against the Bank, because the Trustee\u2019s conduct could only be properly understood in the context of the Bank\u2019s conduct (the Judgment at [78]). The Judge accordingly dismissed the appeals.'"}

In particular, pursuant to the EJD proceedings, a number of questions in the form of a questionnaire had been directed to an officer of the appellant, in preparation for the oral examination of the said officer. The appellant objected to some of the questions which fell within two categories. The first category concerned assets of corporate entities related to the appellant or the said officer.

The present appeal is with regard to the decision of the Judge vis-\u00e0-vis this particular category of questions.', '6\\u2003Put simply, the main thrust of the appellant\u2019s argument in this appeal is that the language of O 48 r 1(1) and of Form 99 of the Rules of Court (\u201cForm 99\u201d), considered together with this court\u2019s decision in PT Bakrie Investindo v Global Distressed Alpha Fund I Ltd Partnership [2013] 4 SLR 1116 (\u201cPT Bakrie\u201d), meant that the Rules of Court permit questions as part of the EJD proceedings only if the judgment concerned (here, the Singapore Judgment) could be enforced in the foreign jurisdiction itself (here, the Maldives).

The High Court also made a declaration and several ancillary orders. On 6 February 2020, the High Court ordered the appellant to pay the respondent $460,000 in costs and disbursements fixed at $286,639.48 and RMB40,466. The judgment amount and the costs and disbursements have not been paid.', '2\\u2003On 6 March 2020, the appellant applied in person for a bankruptcy order against himself in HC\/B 940\/2020 (\u201cB 940\u201d), declaring in his supporting affidavit that he had no assets but had liabilities amounting to $676,350 owing to a potential judgment creditor, Liberty Sky Investments Ltd (\u201cLiberty Sky\u201d), which has a judgment against him for damages to be assessed. He also affirmed that he was unable to pay his debts and that the cause of his insolvency was business failure. In his Statement of Affairs, he declared that he was still married and that his wife\u2019s net income was $3,000. He also listed out the names of his two daughters aged 34 and 33 and two sons aged 29 and 26. He also stated that his previous employer was AMP, his previous job title was director and the last date of his employment was July 2014. His last net monthly salary was declared as $250,000. In both his affidavit and his Statement of Affairs, the appellant stated his address as 20 Yew Siang Road #01-01, Singapore 117756 (\u201cthe Flynn Park apartment\u201d). This is the address of a condominium called Flynn Park which is more than 30 years old.', '3\\u2003On 19 March 2020, the appellant was adjudged a bankrupt on his own application. It turned out that he had applied for the bankruptcy order in B 940 without consulting his lawyers (who included a Senior Counsel) or even informing them although they were in the midst of preparing for his appeal in CA 225. As a result, his lawyers filed the appellant\u2019s appeal papers on 23 March 2020 without having sought the sanction of the Official Assignee to continue with the appeal.', '4\\u2003On 26 May 2020, the respondent applied in CA\/SUM 62\/2020 (\u201cSUM 62\u201d) for various orders including an order that CA 225 be deemed withdrawn or struck out without further order as the appellant had not obtained the Official Assignee\u2019s sanction. Later that same day, the appellant\u2019s lawyers applied in CA\/SUM 65\/2020 (\u201cSUM 65\u201d) for the time for the filing of the appeal papers in CA 225 to be extended while they sorted out the matter of the sanction with the Official Assignee\u2019s office.', '5\\u2003By way of correspondence, we directed that both SUM 62 and SUM 65 be heard first as they concerned the capacity of the appellant to maintain his appeal in CA 225. On 17 June 2020, the Official Assignee granted the sanction under s 131(1)(a) of the Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20, 2009 Rev Ed) to the appellant upon certain conditions, including the requirement for the appellant from time to time to increase the amount of the security deposit which had been placed with the Official Assignee by a third party, depending on the progress of the action.', '6\\u2003As a result of the above developments, the respondent informed the Court and the appellant that she would not object to the appellant\u2019s SUM 65 except that the appellant should pay costs to her (the amount was proposed at $2,000, inclusive of disbursements, in the respondent\u2019s submissions before us). The respondent also indicated that she would not be proceeding with the prayer in her SUM 62 to strike out the appeal but would proceed with the other prayers with some modifications. Those other prayers initially sought further security for costs at $50,000 (on top of the $20,000 provided in the Rules of Court, in order to have a total of $70,000) and payment of the costs and disbursements ordered by the High Court within a specified time frame, failing which CA 225 was to be struck out without further order with costs to be awarded to the respondent. The respondent now asks for further security for costs to be set at $20,000 instead of $50,000 because, as a condition for the grant of sanction, the Official Assignee directed the appellant to raise $30,000 as further security to be held by his lawyers and that has been done. By asking for the further amount of $20,000, the respondent would have a total of $70,000 as security for the costs of the appeal, the amount that she asked for originally. The respondent justifies this amount by relying on the Appendix G guidelines for party-and-party costs awards in the Supreme Court Practice Directions which state the range of costs for appeals from complex trials to be from $60,000 to $100,000.'"}

Helen Lee allegedly told Dr Chen that she was a director of Immunotec Research (S) Pte Ltd (\u201cIRS\u201d) and that she was the sole distributor of Immunotec Products in Singapore. On 24 March 2006, the appellant was incorporated by Dr Chen and two other doctors. 2', 'On the same day, the appellant signed an agreement with IRS pursuant to which the appellant was appointed as the sole distributor of Immunotec Products in Singapore (\u201cthe IRS Distributorship Agreement\u201d).', '4\\u2003Sometime in July or August 2006, the appellant believed that there was another distributor of Immunotec Products in Singapore. However, it was assured by Helen Lee that it was the sole distributor here. Around this time, Helen Lee also informed Dr Chen that IRS had changed its name to United Yield International Pte Ltd (\u201cUYI\u201d) and that the distributorship agreement had to be changed accordingly. 3', 'Accordingly, a new agreement was signed between the appellant and UYI on 18 August 2006 (\u201cthe UYI Distributorship Agreement\u201d) (GD at [4]).', '5\\u2003Dr Chen alleged that he subsequently discovered that IRS and UYI were in fact two separate companies and that there were other parallel importers in Singapore distributing Immunotec Products (GD at [5]). Further, the appellant was not recognised by Immunotec Inc as its sole distributor in Singapore because Helen Lee had not sought approval for this arrangement. However, after Dr Chen raised these matters to Helen Lee, UYI sent the appellant a notice on 18 October 2006 purporting to terminate the UYI Distributorship Agreement.', '6\\u2003On 8 October 2012 (ten days short of six years from the date of UYI\u2019s notice of termination), Dr Chen met Mr Edmond Pereira (the second respondent) and informed him that he wanted his law firm, Edmond Pereira Law Corporation (the first respondent), to commence legal proceedings against Helen Lee and UYI (GD at [6]). On 13 October 2012, Dr Chen wrote to the respondents giving his views on the dispute. On 15 October 2012, Dr Chen wrote again to the respondents instructing them to commence action against Helen Lee and UYI as soon as possible. The same day, the respondents advised him that proceedings against UYI would not be easy as it had been struck off the register of companies. The respondents also advised that the claim against Helen Lee was unlikely to succeed as the agreement was between the appellant and UYI. On 16 October 2012, Dr Chen replied maintaining that Helen Lee had acted in her personal capacity. The same day, the respondents advised that both IRS and UYI had been struck off the register of companies, that Helen Lee had signed the distributorship agreements in her capacity as a director of IRS and UYI respectively and that piercing the corporate veil would require fraud and\/or deceit. The respondents\u2019 opinion was that there was insufficient evidence to succeed against Helen Lee but Dr Chen was adamant that there was sufficient evidence.', '7\\u2003In the morning of 17 October 2012, the second respondent met Dr Chen and advised him of the difficulties in his case and also the urgency to commence action before the limitation period set in. The second respondent also advised that UYI could not be sued as it had been struck off and that there was insufficient evidence to substantiate the appellant\u2019s claim. However, Dr Chen instructed that an action be commenced against only Helen Lee so as to stop the claim from being time-barred. It was in these circumstances that the respondents commenced HC\/S 896\/2012 (\u201cthe Original Suit\u201d) against Helen Lee that same evening. It was not disputed that there was urgency in filing the Original Suit as the action would become time-barred the following day (GD at [42]).', '8\\u2003In April 2013, Helen Lee filed an application to strike out the appellant\u2019s claim in the Original Suit (\u201cthe Striking Out Application\u201d). The Striking Out Application was allowed by an Assistant Registrar (\u201cAR\u201d) who held that the claim against Helen Lee could not succeed because it would require the piercing of the corporate veil of IRS and\/or UYI and this was not adequately pleaded. Moreover, there was no evidence to suggest that the corporate veil could be pierced.', '9\\u2003Following the AR\u2019s decision, the respondents recommended to the appellant not to appeal to a Judge of the High Court. 4', 'As a result, no appeal was filed and the Original Suit remained struck out.'"}

Her claim against R1 was as drawer of the Cheque. Her claim against R2 for the $316,000 was for the option fee payable under the OTP.', '6\\u2003On 6 October 2017, the Respondents saw an online advertisement for the sale of the Property. 2', 'The Property was marketed by the Appellant under the name of Jeannette Ong. At all material times, the Respondents discussed the Property with the Appellant in the belief that she was a real estate agent representing the owner. They only knew her by the name Jeannette Ong. They did not know that her formal name was Ong Keh Choo or that she was the owner. Such information only surfaced later as we elaborate below.', '7\\u2003A series of events took place on 7 October 2017. First, on that morning, the Respondents viewed the Property and were shown around it by the Appellant.', '8\\u2003There was a second meeting at about 2.00pm that same day between the Appellant and the Respondents at the residence of the Respondents. During that meeting, R1 issued the Cheque in favour of \u201cOng Keh Choo\u201d.', '9\\u2003There was a third meeting that day at about 7.00pm between R2 and the Appellant. The Appellant was accompanied by another real estate agent, one Lee Chew Hsia who is also known as Judi Lee (\u201cJL\u201d). The Respondents had met JL earlier that same day while JL was marketing another unit in the same development as the Property. The third meeting was at the residence of R2\u2019s friend where R2 was attending a dinner party hosted by her friend. At that meeting, the OTP was handed to R2.', '10\\u2003After the Appellant and JL left the third meeting, R2 sent a copy of the OTP to her lawyer who advised her on it that same night of 7 October 2017. The substance of the advice was that, normally, the terms of an OTP would provide for payment of 1% of the price as the option fee and for another 4% to be paid upon exercise of the OTP, with the 4% being held by the owner\u2019s lawyer pending completion of the sale. 3', 'However, under the terms of the OTP, 10% of the price was payable as the option fee and 90% was payable upon exercise of the option by 4.00pm of 23 October 2017. Completion was to take place only some 14 weeks thereafter.', '11\\u2003R2 conveyed this advice to the Appellant either directly or through JL, who was acting as an intermediary. Thereafter, R2 and the Appellant discussed amendments to the OTP. R2 wanted to bring the terms of the OTP in line with those normally found.', '12\\u2003However, later that night, R2 asked the Appellant if the Cheque could be cancelled as R1 was worried that the Respondents might not have enough money to cover their expenses if it were cashed.', '13\\u2003The next day, on 8 October 2017, the Respondents learned that the Appellant was the owner of the Property but R2 continued to discuss amendments to the payment terms in the OTP with the Appellant.', '14\\u2003Later in the evening, there was a flurry of messages about the cancellation of the Cheque and a telephone call between R2 and the Appellant. The Respondents\u2019 position was that they were entitled to terminate the OTP for misrepresentation and they did do so that evening. The Respondents also asserted that during the telephone conversation, the Appellant had agreed to terminate the OTP and to return the Cheque after she returned from an intended trip overseas. R2 also informed the Appellant that the Respondents had countermanded the Cheque. The Appellant\u2019s version was that she had only agreed not to bank in the Cheque while she was away in Zurich and until the parties had a chance to meet to resolve the matter. This aspect of the OTP was also heavily disputed and we will elaborate on it later.', '15\\u2003Although the Appellant knew that R2 had said that the Cheque had been countermanded, she proceeded to deposit the Cheque for payment into her bank account on 21 October 2017. Unsurprisingly, she was notified on 24 October 2017 by her bank that payment on the Cheque had been countermanded.', '16\\u2003 On 1 November 2017, the Appellant\u2019s lawyer sent a written notice of dishonour of the Cheque to R2 and demanded payment of $316,000. On 6 November 2017, R2\u2019s lawyer replied to deny liability to pay the sum. The Writ of Summons against the Respondents was filed on 9 March 2018.

Aishamudin accepted that of the ten statements that he gave in the course of the investigations, the account in his first seven statements was largely inaccurate, in so far as he sought to distance himself from the drug transaction with Roszaidi. In his eighth statement, which was recorded on 11 July 2016 at 10.22am, he admitted that while he initially sought to pin the blame entirely on Suhaizam, he did not wish to \u201chide the truth\u201d any longer. At the trial, Aishamudin accepted in cross-examination that his eighth, ninth and tenth statements were accurately recorded. We therefore take the account given by Aishamudin in these statements.', '7\\u2003In essence, at the material time, Aishamudin and Suhaizam were colleagues employed as truck drivers to deliver goods from Malaysia to Singapore. In the course of these deliveries, Aishamudin would, for monetary reward, deliver drugs to recipients in Singapore on behalf of drug traffickers known to him as \u201cTambi\u201d and \u201cSuhadi\u201d. There were at least two prior occasions on which Aishamudin had delivered drugs on behalf of Tambi and Suhadi, and Suhaizam had collaborated with him in delivering the drugs on the second occasion.', '8\\u2003On 6 October 2015, Aishamudin was informed by Suhadi that there was a \u201cjob\u201d that day. Accordingly, Aishamudin went to Suhadi\u2019s house and collected a red plastic bag. Suhadi explicitly told Aishamudin that there were packets in the red plastic bag which contained \u201cheroin and a bit of sejuk\u201d (heroin being a common name for diamorphine, and sejuk being a street name for methamphetamine). On the same day, Aishamudin asked Suhaizam to help him transport these drugs to Singapore and deliver them, and Suhaizam agreed to do so. Aishamudin expected that they would receive RM4,000 for performing this delivery.', '9\\u2003At the trial, Aishamudin testified that when he entered the truck driven by Suhaizam on 6 October 2015, he had the red plastic bag with him, and he informed Suhaizam that there was diamorphine and methamphetamine in it. After clearing Tuas Checkpoint, Aishamudin and Suhaizam proceeded to Changi Cargo Complex to perform a cargo delivery. Sometime after 9.00pm, Suhaizam drove the truck to Bulim Avenue and parked it along the road. Unknown to them, they were being observed by officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (\u201cCNB\u201d). Shortly thereafter, a car driven by Azli turned into Bulim Avenue. Roszaidi alighted from the car and collected the red plastic bag from Aishamudin before returning to the car. Both vehicles then exited Bulim Avenue. Throughout the incident, Aishamudin received instructions from Tambi and Suhadi. All the individuals involved in the transportation, delivery and collection of the red plastic bag and its contents were subsequently arrested by CNB officers at various locations.'"}

The respondent, the Singapore Rifle Association (\u201cSRA\u201d), is a member of the Singapore Shooting Association (\u201cSSA\u201d). The appellant, Mr Michael Vaz Lorrain (\u201cMr Vaz\u201d), is the president of SSA\u2019s council. On 8 February 2017, SRA commenced HC\/S 109\/2017 (\u201cSuit 109\u201d) against Mr Vaz, alleging that he had breached a mediation agreement and\/or a duty of confidence. Mr Vaz did not dispute liability. Accordingly, interlocutory judgment for damages to be assessed was entered against Mr Vaz on 23 May 2017.', '3\\u2003In due course, damages were assessed and on 25 February 2019, the High Court judge (\u201cthe Judge\u201d) awarded damages in favour of SRA in the sum of $8,100 along with interest and costs. Subsequently, he also held that O 22A r 9(3) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) did not apply to an offer to settle made by Mr Vaz on 3 April 2017 (\u201cthe OTS\u201d) as it was not more favourable than the judgment sum obtained by SRA and the costs it had incurred up to the date of the OTS. The terms of the OTS are as follows: 1', '4\\u2003In CA\/CA 60\/2019 (\u201cCA 60\u201d), Mr Vaz appealed against the damages and costs assessed by the Judge. On 5 May 2020, prior to the hearing of the appeal before us, SRA purportedly accepted the OTS. 2', 'The parties accepted that CA 60 should be withdrawn but consent to a withdrawal was not forthcoming because of costs. Pursuant to O 57 r 11(3)(a) of the Rules of Court, this court was asked to determine whether the OTS provided for costs. The dispute was on whether O 22A r 9(2) of the Rules of Court applied to the OTS. Order 22A r 9(2) provides for certain costs consequences where \u201can accepted offer to settle does not provide for costs\u201d. Mr Vaz contended that the OTS did not provide for costs, while SRA took the contrary position. The parties were thus directed to file submissions in respect of that issue.', '5\\u2003In the course of reviewing the parties\u2019 costs submissions, we noted that the OTS contained a term requiring SRA to file a \u201cNotice of Discontinuance of Claim\u201d within three working days of the receipt of the sum of $25,000 (see [3] above). We also noted that SRA had prepared its Notice of Discontinuance in readiness for filing after accepting the OTS. In context, the term requiring SRA to file its \u201cNotice of Discontinuance of Claim\u201d in the OTS meant that the action had to be discontinued, apparently despite the fact that judgment had already been given in the High Court. We therefore directed the parties to file further submissions on the following preliminary issue:', '6\\u2003For convenience, we refer to a term that requires the action to be discontinued as a \u201cDiscontinuance Term\u201d. In addition, unless otherwise stated, a \u201cjudgment\u201d refers to a first instance judgment that completely disposes of the cause of action or matter (both with regard to liability and damages).'"}
{"casename":"2020_SGCA_73","fact":"'3\\u2003The appellant commenced legal proceedings against the Company in HC\/S 373\/2012 (\u201cSuit 373\u201d) on 8 May 2012, in relation to disputes arising out of two purchase orders under which the Company agreed to manufacture diesel generators for the appellant. On 6 August 2012, the appellant filed an ex parte summons for a Mareva injunction against the Company. The injunction was granted on 8 August 2012 and it was ordered that:', '(a)\\u2003The Company must not remove from Singapore in any way dispose of or deal with or diminish the value of any of its assets which were then in Singapore whether in its own name or not and whether solely or jointly owned up to the value of $1.5m.', '(b)\\u2003The prohibition included the following assets in particular:', '(c)\\u2003The eight engines in the possession of the Company at its premises at 13 Tuas Avenue 11 or wherever the same were situated be detained and\/or placed in custody and\/or preserved, and disposal of these engines was prohibited until after the trial of Suit 373 or any appeal therefrom.', '(d)\\u2003If the total unencumbered value of the Company\u2019s assets in Singapore exceeded $1.5m, the Company may remove any of those assets from Singapore or may dispose of or deal with them so long as the total unencumbered value of its assets still in Singapore was not less than $1.5m.', '(e)\\u2003The Company must inform the appellant in writing at once of all its assets whether in Singapore whether in its own name or not and whether solely or jointly owned, giving the value, location and details of all such assets. The information must be confirmed in an affidavit which must be served on the appellant\u2019s solicitors within 21 days after service of the order.', '(f)\\u2003The Company may spend $1,500 a week towards ordinary living expenses and $2,000 a week on legal advice and representation, but must tell the appellant\u2019s solicitors where the money was to come from before spending any money.', '(g)\\u2003The Company may deal with or dispose of any of its assets in the ordinary and proper course of business and shall account to the appellant monthly for the amount of money spent in this regard.', '4\\u2003Pursuant to the Mareva order, Mdm Mageswari affirmed an affidavit on 28 August 2012 setting out a list of 70 assets wholly owned by the Company allegedly amounting to $3,256,637.75 in value and, additionally, listing trade receivables of $1,114,288.95 and cash and bank balances of $44,183.24. Thus, the total value of the assets disclosed in the affidavit of 28 August 2012 amounted to approximately $4.4m. It is undisputed that the Company did not engage the services of an independent valuer to value the physical assets, but rather valued these itself according to what it believed to be the market price of these assets, as the Company was \u201cone of the few companies \u2026 in this line of business dealing with the sales of new and used engines, generators and reconditioned parts\u201d and was thus \u201cfamiliar with current market prices\u201d. It was the evidence of Mdm Mageswari that the values were given by Mr Tanabalan, and that her involvement in the preparation of the affidavit was simply to read and sign the affidavit given that she was the Company\u2019s sole director. Mr Tanabalan\u2019s evidence corroborates this, and he was not contradicted on this point. Mr Tanabalan explained during cross-examination that the values were arrived at based on his own personal knowledge or the knowledge of friends in the same line of business.', '5\\u2003Mdm Mageswari further affirmed in the same affidavit that of the 70 assets listed, two were located at the premises of Transvictory Winch System Pte Ltd at 20 Third Chin Bee Road (\u201cthe Transvictory premises\u201d), one at Tuas South whereas the remaining assets were at the Company\u2019s own premises at 13 Tuas Avenue 11.', '6\\u2003On 28 March 2013, having heard evidence and submissions in Suit 373, the Judge found in favour of the appellant, allowing the appellant\u2019s claim and dismissing the Company\u2019s counterclaim. The company was ordered to deliver up the eight engines (or the sale proceeds thereof) mentioned in the Mareva order at [3(c)] above, pay the appellant a sum of US$252,000 and pay the appellant damages for breach of contract to be assessed. The eight engines which were delivered to the appellant appear to be among the 70 items listed in the affidavit of 28 August 2012.', '7\\u2003The Company\u2019s appeal against the findings in Suit 373 was heard on 26 November 2013. The Court of Appeal upheld the Judge\u2019s findings in relation to the appellant\u2019s claims but allowed the appeal in respect of the Company\u2019s counterclaim in the sum of US$96,000. The damages payable to the appellant were subsequently assessed on 5 January 2016 at $606,418.27, with interest thereon at the usual rate of 5.33% per annum from 15 August 2014 to 30 November 2015. Apart from the damages, the Company was also ordered to pay the appellant a total of $53,000 in costs arising from Suit 373 and the appeal. Given the appellant\u2019s unsuccessful attempts to levy execution (see below at [15]), the appellant remains a substantial creditor of the Company.', '8\\u2003As stated above, the majority of the 70 assets listed in the affidavit of 28 August 2012 were located at the Company\u2019s premises at 13 Tuas Avenue 11. In March 2014, the Company vacated these premises. On 25 March 2014, in a letter signed by Mdm Mageswari, the Company informed the appellant (\u201cthe March 2014 Letter\u201d) as follows:', '9\\u2003The March 2014 Letter appended a list of 36 assets allegedly valued at a total of $1,505,574.92. The values given for these 36 assets were identical to the values for the corresponding assets listed in the affidavit of 28 August 2012. The Company was apparently advised that it was not obliged to disclose the location of the remaining 34 assets since the 36 assets in the March 2014 Letter were valued in excess of the limit of $1.5m in the Mareva order. During cross-examination, Mr Tanabalan testified that the remaining 34 items were either sold, given away or left in the premises of Singatec Engineering Pte Ltd at 21 Tuas Basin Lane (\u201cthe Singatac premises\u201d).', '10\\u2003The premises in which the 36 assets were allegedly stored belonged to companies which were owned or controlled by Mr Tanabalan\u2019s business associates or friends. Of these 36 assets, one was further split into units stored in two separate locations. Treating these split units separately and as distinctive assets (as the Judge did in his Grounds of Decision reported as Aero-Gate Pte Ltd v Engen Marine Engineering Pte Ltd [2018] SGHC 267 (\u201cthe GD\u201d)), a total of 37 assets were disclosed in the March 2014 Letter. These 37 assets were said to be at the following locations:', '11\\u2003Engen Spares and Engen Offshore share the name \u201cEngen\u201d with the Company and use the same logo as it did. The sole shareholders and directors of both companies are the two adult children of the contemnors. Mdm Mageswari was a director of Engen Spares up to June 2013, but neither Mdm Mageswari nor Mr Tanabalan hold any direct interest in Engen Spares or Engen Offshore.', '12\\u2003The assets at the Singatac premises were subsequently disposed of by Singatac as it wished to recover rental arrears of $24,000 owed to it by the Company. This is undisputed. According to Singatac\u2019s representative, one Mr Tan Soon Keong (\u201cMr Tan\u201d), he was unaware that the assets were subject to a Mareva injunction. Singatac agreed with Mr Tanabalan that the assets could be stored at its premises for two months, but Mr Tanabalan failed to move the assets out of the premises on schedule. Thereafter, he could not be contacted for eight months. Mr Tan told the court that the assets had to be removed as they were obstructing ongoing works at the premises. Subsequently, the assets were scrapped by Singatac for $8,626.80.', '13\\u2003According to Mr Tanabalan\u2019s affidavit of evidence-in-chief, the assets at the Transvictory premises were disposed of in a similar fashion by Transvictory, in satisfaction of a debt of $300,000 owing by the Company. This was denied by Transvictory. Its lawyers stated that the arrangement between Transvictory, represented by one Richard Chiang (\u201cMr Chiang\u201d), and Mr Tanabalan was that Mr Tanabalan and the Company had been given uninhibited access to the premises to store the items or retrieve the items stored. Transvictory asserted that it had no knowledge whether any of the Company\u2019s assets were actually stored at its premises, and that it did not dispose of any of the assets. During cross-examination, Mr Tanabalan corrected his evidence and said that Transvictory disposed of the assets not because of the $300,000 loan, which had been repaid in full, but because of a separate personal loan of $65,000 owed by Mr Tanabalan to Mr Chiang himself. Mr Tanabalan also testified that he did not inform Transvictory that the assets stored at its premises were subject to a Mareva order.', '14\\u2003As stated above at [3(b)(ii)], the Mareva injunction also contained a specific prohibition in relation to the SCB SGD account. In March 2014, Mdm Mageswari instructed Standard Chartered Bank to close the SCB SGD account. Standard Chartered Bank thereafter lifted the \u201cfreeze\u201d on the account that had been in place since the Mareva injunction, released the balance of some $6,804.73 to the Company and closed the account. This sum was subsequently spent.', '15\\u2003On 10 September 2013, the sheriff seized 19 of the Company\u2019s assets from its premises at 13 Tuas Avenue 11 under a writ of seizure and sale (\u201cWSS\u201d). These 19 assets had been valued by Mdm Mageswari at $1.045m in her affidavit of 28 August 2012 but were valued by the appellant\u2019s valuer at only $117,400. Mr Tanabalan disputes this valuation and says that the appointed valuer might not have been familiar with the industry, and further that it was unfair that the Company was not requested to appoint its own valuer at the same time. It appears that the 19 assets were returned to the Company on 31 October 2013 but it is unclear what happened to them after that.', '16\\u2003In June 2014, two assets in the Singatac premises were seized by the sheriff pursuant to another WSS. The seizure was effected by stickers being affixed by the sheriff onto these assets. No further action was carried out in respect of these two assets from the time of seizure up to the time they were disposed of by Singatac.', '17\\u2003According to the March 2014 Letter, 12 assets had been moved to the premises at Soon Lee Street. In December 2016, the appellant executed a WSS on the assets at Soon Lee Street and found only seven assets there. Five assets were missing. The missing five assets form the subject matter of the sixth charge against Mdm Mageswari and the seventh charge against Mr Tanabalan. The seven assets found in Soon Lee Street had been valued at $188,000 in the March 2014 Letter but the appellant\u2019s valuer valued them at only $15,600. When auctioned later, they realised $2,100. In July 2017, Mdm Mageswari disclosed that the missing five assets were to be moved shortly thereafter to a warehouse known as the \u201cHock Ann Warehouse\u201d. The appellant\u2019s representative visited the Hock Ann Warehouse and saw items corresponding with the relevant description there but thought the items looked too new to be the original ones subject to the Mareva order.'"}
{"casename":"2020_SGCA_74","fact":"'3\\u2003On 25 January 2014, the complainant was invited to Mr Muhammad Elmi Ching bin Aman\u2019s (\u201cMr Elmi\u201d) birthday party which was being held at the Duxton Hotel (\u201cthe hotel\u201d). She arrived at the hotel with Mr Mohamed Affandi bin Ibrahim (\u201cMr Affandi\u201d) on 26 January 2014 just after midnight. The appellant and other individuals were already in the hotel room that had been booked for the birthday party (\u201cthe hotel room\u201d). At the time, the complainant was 18 years old. She had not previously met any of the persons present apart from Mr Affandi and one Mr Muhammad Fadly bin Abdull Wahab (\u201cMr Fadly\u201d) who had extended the invitation to her.', '4\\u2003The hotel room contained two floors connected by a spiral staircase, with the bedroom and bathroom on the second floor. After arriving, the complainant sat next to Mr Fadly on a sofa on the first floor and had a number of alcoholic drinks, served by Mr Fadly and possibly the appellant. Mr Fadly testified that he had told another guest, Mr Muhammad Hazly bin Mohamad Halimi (\u201cMr Hazly\u201d), earlier that night that he wanted to get the complainant drunk. It was not entirely clear how much alcohol the complainant consumed in the hotel room. The Judge described the witnesses\u2019 evidence on this as comprising \u201cvague and inconsistent estimations\u201d: the Judgment at [141]. The complainant testified that she drank roughly three or four half-full cups of an unknown liquor mixed with an unknown soft drink before drinking another four three-quarter full cups of vodka mixed with Red Bull. While there was some variation in the other witnesses\u2019 evidence on the amount of alcohol she had consumed, they generally testified that she had drunk about three or four cups of an alcohol and soft drink mixture. Two of the witnesses, Mr Elmi and Mr Muhammad Faris bin Ramlee (\u201cMr Faris\u201d), acknowledged that these estimations were assumptions and that they did not in fact recall how much the complainant had drunk: the Judgment at [141(c)] and [141(f)].', '5\\u2003At around 1.00am, some of the other attendees prepared to leave for the Zouk nightclub (\u201cZouk\u201d). However, the complainant had difficulty standing up on her own. She collapsed on the ground of the first floor and some evidence suggested she also vomited there. Mr Fadly took the complainant up to the bathroom, where she vomited again. Mr Fadly and Mr Hazly stayed behind with the complainant while the others left for Zouk at 1.15am. The complainant testified that she could not recall the others talking about or leaving for Zouk.', '6\\u2003After the others left, Mr Fadly and\/or Mr Hazly took the complainant out of the bathroom and placed her on the bed on the second floor. There was some suggestion that the complainant had also vomited while she was lying on the bed at some point that morning. Mr Thangavelu, counsel for the appellant, appeared to accept this at the hearing before us. At about 1.52am, Mr Fadly and Mr Hazly took a photograph of themselves with the complainant partially undressed and her breasts exposed. She was unconscious at the time.', '7\\u2003At around 2.20am, Mr Elmi returned to the hotel room to pick up his girlfriend\u2019s identification card. He testified that he saw the complainant fully dressed but in an unconscious state on the floor of the bedroom. Mr Elmi left the hotel room one or two minutes later. After Mr Elmi left, Mr Fadly and Mr Hazly raped the complainant. By the time of the appellant\u2019s trial, they had pleaded guilty to charges of rape and had been convicted and sentenced: the Judgment at [13].', '8\\u2003The appellant returned to the hotel room alone at around 3.45am after an altercation at Zouk. He went into the bathroom and saw the complainant seated in the bathtub. As we explain in more detail below, his position as to the complainant\u2019s condition at this point, as indicated in the investigative statements recorded from him, differed from the account he gave at the trial. After checking whether he had sustained any injuries from the altercation, he left the bathroom, leaving the complainant inside it. He later went down to the hotel lobby to help another friend, Mr Ridhaudin Ridhwan bin Bakri (\u201cMr Ridhwan\u201d) enter the hotel. He returned to the hotel room with Mr Faris and Mr Ridhwan at around 3.57am.', '9\\u2003At some point thereafter, Mr Faris went into the bathroom. The complainant was still in the bathroom and Mr Faris then had sexual intercourse with her there. The statement given by the appellant to the police on 16 October 2014 (\u201cthe second statement\u201d) recorded him as saying that he did not think the complainant could have consented to having sexual intercourse with Mr Faris at the material time. The Judge, in convicting Mr Faris of rape, found that the complainant had been severely intoxicated, \u201cat least close to unconsciousness at the material time\u201d and had not had the capacity to consent to sexual activity. He found that the complainant\u2019s physical condition and level of sedation meant that she could not have been, and was not, simply suffering from anterograde amnesia (the term anterograde amnesia is explained at [13] below). The Judge further stated that his view was that the complainant did not in fact consent, even if she could have: the Judgment at [165]. Mr Faris did not appeal against his conviction.', '10\\u2003The appellant was waiting outside the bathroom while Mr Faris was inside and as soon as Mr Faris emerged alone, the appellant went in. It was common ground that while the appellant was in the bathroom, his penis had been inserted into the complainant\u2019s mouth, and that he had attempted to insert his penis into her vagina, although he had not managed to do so as he could not sustain his erection. While the appellant and complainant were in the bathroom, Mr Elmi and his girlfriend returned to the hotel room and one of them pushed the bathroom door open. Mr Elmi testified that although the bathroom was dark, he saw the appellant\u2019s and complainant\u2019s reflections in the mirror. His evidence was that, at that time, they were standing near the sink about shoulder-width apart, and that both were topless. While he claimed that the complainant \u201clooked drunk\u201d at that time, judging from her face, Mr Elmi later agreed that he could not remember whether he could see her face. The appellant quickly pushed the door shut, and left the bathroom alone a few minutes later. Mr Elmi then asked Mr Fadly to help the complainant out of the bathroom. Mr Fadly took the complainant down to the first floor by placing the complainant\u2019s arm over his shoulder. Mr Elmi\u2019s impression was that she had been weak and drunk at that point. Thereafter the complainant went to sleep on the floor of the living room.', '11\\u2003Mr Ridhwan and Mr Faris were accused of committing sexual offences against the complainant when she was lying in the living room: the Judgment at [2] and [3]. The appellant was jointly tried with both of them. Including the appellant, five men were alleged to have committed sexual offences against the complainant on 26 January 2014. The defence of the appellant was that the complainant had consented to the acts for which he was charged.'"}
{"casename":"2020_SGCA_75","fact":"Background\n3 The present contempt proceedings were initiated by the husband prior \nto the Judge\u2019s final order on care and control. On 28 June 2019, he filed \nSummons No 169 of 2019 for leave to commence committal proceedings \nagainst the appellant on the basis that she had breached court orders. The Judge \ngranted leave to the husband who then filed Summons No 190 of 2019 \n(\u201cSUM 190\u201d) for an order of committal against the appellant on 11 July 2019.\n4 SUM 190 was premised on the appellant\u2019s purported breach of two court \norders dated 4 September 2017 (\u201cthe 2017 Order\u201d) and 27 June 2018 (\u201cthe \n2018 Order\u201d).

The [wife] disparages the [husband] to the children \u2026 and \nencourages them to hate and reject the [husband] as their \nfather totally and completely.\n2. The [wife] has provided at least one of the children \u2026 with \ndocuments, photograph [sic] and information from her \naffidavits and other related documents filed in the divorce \nproceedings and has encouraged, instigated and\/or allowed \n[the daughter] to make public such information as follows:\na. Posting on facebook on or about 24th June 2019;\nb. Posting on Instagram on or about 24th June 2019;\nc. Giving press interview to the [newspapers] on or about \n26th June 2019, resulting in a news article on 27th June \n2019.\n3. The language, comments and allegations made by [the \ndaughter] on the said posts are mostly regurgitations of the \nallegations made by the [wife] and\/or the children in her \nvarious affidavits and submissions in the divorce proceedings.\n7 It was not disputed that on or about 24 June 2019, the daughter made a \nseries of posts on her Facebook and Instagram social media accounts. The posts \nalleged that the husband was a pervert and sexual predator who had engaged in \nextra-marital affairs, sexually groomed the children and ruined the parties\u2019 \nmarriage. The posts also revealed the husband\u2019s full name and employment \ndetails, and were widely viewed by various members of the public (including \nthe husband\u2019s colleagues and superior). \n8 Following the daughter\u2019s posts, a reporter from the newspaper contacted \nthe daughter and was granted an interview at the former matrimonial home. The \nappellant allowed the interview, on the basis that there was \u201cnothing wrong\u201d \nwith the children giving an interview to the press, and that they were entitled to \n\u201cshare their experiences with anybody\u2026[and] to voice out their frustration, their \nhatred, their bitterness\u201d. The article, which reported on the circulation of the \ndaughter\u2019s social media posts, was published on 27 June 2019.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nVDZ v VEA[2020] SGCA 75\n69 On 4 July 2019, the daughter made another social media post on \nInstagram. The post purported to document how the Family Court had acted \nunfairly towards the appellant between January 2019 and May 2019, and alleged \nthat the husband had abused the court process to harm the appellant and the \nchildren.\n10 The next day, on 5 July 2019, the daughter made yet another social \nmedia post on Facebook. This post, while similar to the one that was posted on \nInstagram, focused on how the appellant and the children had suffered as a result \nof court orders and the husband\u2019s actions from February 2018 to January 2019.\n11 On 16 July 2019, the children submitted a police report titled \u201cStatement \nof Confession\u201d. The Statement of Confession stated:\n\u2026 We wish to state that the recent online postings \u2026 on our \nabused life experiences were done solely by both of us. We are \nsolely responsible for all these sharing. We answer for our own \nactions. No one else is involved. From writing to online postings \nto newspaper interview, we did all these together and by \nourselves \u2026 \nOur Mother does not know anything about our online postings. \nShe did not tell us, did not share with us and did not give us \nany information for our Postings. She is innocent \u2026 \nWe also wanted to keep the newspaper interview away from our \nMother, but the reporters asked her to be around during our \ninterview. Then, our Mother only came to know a bit of our \nonline postings. We told our Mother, this issue is between \nme & [my brother] and our father & his family. This has \nnothing to do with her. Anyway, she also does not want to be \ninvolved.

The alleged information which had been misappropriated included lists of Amber\u2019s patients, clients, prices, stocks, vendors, and standard operating procedures. Such lists, it was alleged, were specific to Amber\u2019s operations, and constituted sensitive information that had to be strictly guarded. 2', '6\\u2003To support its claim against the defendants, on 15 March 2018, Amber applied ex parte for search orders against the defendants.

In the application, the defendants prayed, inter alia, for the discharge of the search orders, for Amber to return all items seized pursuant to the said orders, and for Amber to destroy all duplicates, copies and\/or imaging of all items made during the searches. To support the application, the defendants alleged that: (a) there were irregularities in the execution of the search orders as the solicitors who had supervised the search did not advise the defendants of their right to refuse entry to \u201canyone who could gain commercially from anything he might read or see on the premises\u201d; (b) Amber had not returned the originals of all the seized documents within two days of their removal, in breach of Paragraph 2 of Schedule 4 of the search orders; and (c) the ambit of the search orders was too wide, as it gave Amber \u201ccarte blanche to all documents belonging\/relating\u201d to the defendants. 10', '15\\u2003The Judge first heard the setting-aside application at a Judge Pre-Trial Conference (\u201cJPTC\u201d) on 23 May 2018.

Both Amber\u2019s and the defendants\u2019 counsel agreed that documents which belonged to the other party ought to be returned to that party. However, the defendants\u2019 counsel, Mr George Pereira, reserved the defendants\u2019 position that Amber was not entitled to take whatever documents it wanted. 13', '18\\u2003As the parties were in agreement that the documents ought to be returned to their rightful owners, the Judge directed the parties to come to a workable solution to sort out the ownership of the documents. She also reminded the parties that a search order was not the time to do comprehensive discovery of documents, and that discovery would take place in the course of the proceedings. 14', '19\\u2003The parties returned before the Judge on 18 July 2018. Instead of dealing with the setting-aside application proper, the Judge directed, based on their agreement that the documents would be returned to their rightful owners, that the parties were to carry out a \u201cListing Exercise\u201d, whereby: 15', '(a)\\u2003Amber was to determine the ownership of the documents based on 32 search terms by 8 August 2018.

This was to be done by 17 September 2018.', '20\\u2003The Listing Exercise was not completed by the stipulated dates. On 28 September 2018, at a JPTC, counsel for Amber informed the Judge that pursuant to the search terms, Amber had identified 64,000 documents, of which 10,000 belonged to an unrelated third party, while the ownership of the remaining 54,000 was still unascertained. The Judge ordered that the 10,000 documents belonging to the third party were to be deleted forthwith. As for the remaining 54,000 documents, the Judge reiterated that Amber was to comply with her previous directions, so that the ownership of the documents could be determined, and all documents which belonged to the defendants were to be returned to them, and not to be kept in any form by Amber. Furthermore, documents of which the ownership was disputed were to be kept by the defendants\u2019 counsel only.

This was an offence under s 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241, 1993 Rev Ed) (\u201cPCA\u201d), which states that it is an offence for any person to corruptly give or agree to give any gratification to any agent as an inducement or reward for doing any act in relation to his principal\u2019s business.', '(d)\\u2003Fourth, Lim had inserted her personal thumb drive into a computer belonging to Amber without authorisation and downloaded many documents, some of which were seized under the search orders, and this constituted an offence under s 3(1) of the Computer Misuse Act (Cap 50A, 2007 Rev Ed) (\u201cCMA\u201d).', '23\\u2003Spurred by the view that \u201cserious criminal offences\u201d had been committed by the defendants, and allegedly out of civic-mindedness, Amber\u2019s representative, Sudesh Samuel, made reports to the Singapore Police Force, Ministry of Manpower, and the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (collectively, \u201cthe authorities\u201d), disclosing ten of the Documents or excerpts of them in the process. These reports were allegedly made \u201cin or around the 3rd Quarter of 2018.\u201d 20', 'It is not clear whether the reports were made with or without legal advice, though we observe that it is likely that some legal input must have been provided in identifying the above offences.', '24\\u2003On 14 December 2018, after the reports were made, Lee & Lee was appointed to take over the conduct of the matter from Amber\u2019s previous solicitors. 21', '25\\u2003On 23 January 2019, at a pre-trial conference (\u201cPTC\u201d) before the senior assistant registrar (\u201cSAR\u201d), Lee & Lee explained that Amber\u2019s persistent failure to comply with the timelines set by the Judge for the Listing Exercise was due to \u201cthe sheer number of documents involved\u201d. 22', 'No mention whatsoever was made about the use of certain documents for the reports to the authorities.', '26\\u2003In the meantime, on 25 January 2019, Lee & Lee wrote to the defendants\u2019 solicitors to seek their consent for an extension of time for the Listing Exercise to be completed by 5 April 2019. 23', 'Again, no mention whatsoever was made that various documents belonging to the defendants had been used in making reports to the authorities without leave of court. The impression given by Amber was that it was still endeavouring to sort out the ownership of the seized documents, so as to comply with the Judge\u2019s direction to return the defendants\u2019 documents.', '27\\u2003Subsequently, on 29 January 2019, Amber took out the present leave application (HC\/SUM 484\/2019) ex parte seeking, among other orders, prospective and retrospective leave to use the Documents for the purpose of making reports to the authorities. According to Amber, having recently instructed Lee & Lee, it was \u201cinformed and advised that it would be best \u2013 indeed, necessary \u2026 to seek leave\u201d of court to use the Documents in support of the reports given, or further reports to be made. 24', '28\\u2003As the leave application was taken out ex parte, the defendants did not have notice of the extraneous purpose which Amber had used, and was seeking to use, the Documents for. Without such knowledge, on 31 January 2019, the defendants agreed to the extension of time sought by Amber to comply with the Listing Exercise. 25', 'Based on the defendants\u2019 agreement, on 8 February 2019, the Judge granted Amber an extension of time to comply with the terms of the Listing Exercise by April 2019. 26', '29\\u2003After the extension of time was obtained, and because the Judge had directed, on 8 February 2019, that Amber serve the summons for leave and the supporting affidavit on the defendants, 27', 'Amber served the papers on the defendants on 12 February 2019. 28', 'This was when the defendants first came to know that Amber had used, and intended to use, the Documents for the extraneous purpose of making criminal reports to the authorities. Prior to that, the impression which Amber had given to the court and to the defendants was that it was taking time to comply with the Listing Exercise (which only required the parties to determine the ownership of the seized documents) because of \u201cthe sheer number of documents involved\u201d.'"}

In the meantime, an AD was issued on 22 May 2019 in respect of SOP 98\/2019. 17', '15\\u2003It was not in dispute that the nub of Samsung\u2019s complaint about overpayment concerned matters that had already been adjudicated under 1AD. The Judge noted that for the dispute on the final quantities disposed of, the Subcontract had provided for different methods of measurement for different kinds of work and different types of material disposed of (Soon Li Heng Civil Engineering Pte Ltd v Samsung C&T Corp and another [2019] SGHC 267 (\u201cthe Judgment\u201d) at [69]). Accordingly, he did not agree that the alleged new evidence to which Samsung had referred (see [10] above) entitled Samsung to conclude that there was an overpayment as Samsung\u2019s approach did not take into account the various charges for different work or different types of material (the Judgment at [69] and [71]).', '16\\u2003On the dispute about the quantity of hardcore material disposed of, the Judge noted that in the bills of quantities in the Subcontract, the measurement was done in terms of lorry loads and some by the \u201cas built drawings\u201d. Thus it was not correct to approach the measurement solely by lorry loads as Samsung had done (the Judgment at [70]).', '17\\u2003The Judge also noted that Samsung\u2019s claim of overpayment was allegedly supported by a table or annex attached to its further notice of dispute dated 6 March 2019. However, the breakdown in that annex did not correlate to the new evidence allegedly discovered by Samsung. Instead, it was a mere reference back to the figures in PR 20 (the Judgment at [24], [72]\u2013[73]). After referring to various specific items of dispute, the Judge concluded that Samsung\u2019s claim of overpayment based on alleged new evidence (\u201cthe New Evidence argument\u201d) was raised as a facade to justify its call on the PB (the Judgment at [78]).', '18\\u2003As regards the question whether Samsung\u2019s demand was unconscionable, the Judge distinguished the relevant statutory provisions in Singapore from those applying in New South Wales, Australia. He noted that New South Wales does not have the equivalent of s 21 of the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act (Cap 30B, 2006 Rev Ed) (\u201cSOPA\u201d) which provides for the temporary finality of an AD. He concluded that Samsung\u2019s demand on the PB had sought to undermine the temporary finality of 1AD and this was unconscionable (the Judgment at [89]\u2013[91]).', '19\\u2003The Judge also considered whether Samsung was entitled under the Subcontract to demand payment under the PB to satisfy its overpayment claim. He referred to cl 17.7 which states:', '20\\u2003The Judge was of the view that the phrase \u201cunder the Subcontract\u201d in cl 17.7 must refer to a sum due to Samsung under a particular provision of the Subcontract (the Judgment at [100]\u2013[101]). As Samsung\u2019s demand was not made pursuant to any such provision, its demand was not consistent with the Subcontract and was not in respect of an amount for which Samsung could make a demand under the PB.'"}

That the marriage broke down sometime in 2001 is also evident from the numerous legal proceedings the parties have been embroiled in, including a criminal trial.', '5\\u2003We raise this to highlight that although this was a long marriage, the facts relating to the breakdown of the marriage were highly unusual. First, as mentioned, the marriage broke down in 2001 even though IJ was granted only in 2016. Second, there was a negative value in the Wife\u2019s indirect contributions (see [130] to [132]).

He began his career with the Ministry of Health in 1989, until he paid off his bond and set up a clinic as a sole proprietorship (\u201cthe Clinic\u201d) in April 1991, where he worked as the resident doctor until it closed down in 2003. The Wife, who was then working as an accountant, quit her job to work in the Clinic from the time it was set up until 2001. In 2001, the parties also set up a bubble tea shop within the same premises as the Clinic to generate income on the side, although this closed down within a year.', '7\\u2003In 1989, prior to the marriage, the Husband\u2019s father passed away. It is not disputed that he was generous with the Husband and gave assets to the Husband during his lifetime and by his will. These included 500,000 shares and 35,000 shares in two family companies, \u201cTQA\u201d and \u201cTQB\u201d, respectively. In 1993, during the marriage, the Husband incorporated a company named \u201cTQCDE\u201d and transferred 499,909 of his 500,000 TQA shares and all 35,000 of his TQB shares to TQCDE. 4', 'The Husband held approximately 90% of the 100,000 shares in TQCDE, while the Wife held approximately 10%. The Husband\u2019s mother held one of the 100,000 shares. The Husband\u2019s mother passed away in 2000 and, according to the Husband, he inherited even more assets upon her death. TQCDE was eventually liquidated in 2014. By then, the Husband\u2019s two sisters had become shareholders of TQCDE. When TQCDE was liquidated, its shares in TQA and TQB were distributed to its shareholders according to their shareholding at that time. Both the Husband and the Wife thereafter held shares in TQA and TQB directly.', '8\\u2003The Wife left the matrimonial home on 1 September 2001. She filed her first divorce action on 14 December 2001 and, two weeks later, took the two sons to live with her. The first divorce application was dismissed in 2005, whereupon the Wife moved back into the family home with the two sons. Less than a year later, she moved out again and never moved back to live with the family. The two sons were shuttled between the two homes until March 2010, when they moved back in with the Husband, and there they have stayed. The Wife\u2019s second divorce action was filed on 27 December 2010 and dismissed in February 2015.

The present dispute arises out of attempts to enter into one such transaction during the months of March and April 2017, involving three shipments of Indonesian steam coal (\u201cthe Cargo\u201d) which Avra asserted China Coal had agreed to buy from it.', '4\\u2003In the exchanges recounted below, China Coal was represented by its deputy purchasing manager, Mr Wei Pengfei (\u201cMr Wei\u201d), who is also known as \u201cRichard\u201d. Avra was represented mainly by its coal marketer, Mr Zhou Jungang (\u201cMr Zhou\u201d, also known as \u201cGary\u201d), and its director, Mr Benjamin William Burgess (\u201cMr Burgess\u201d).', '5\\u2003On 29 March 2017, Avra and China Coal exchanged the First Four E-mails, which are reproduced in full in the GD at [9]\u2013[13]. The exchange commenced in the morning at around 11.00am with an e-mail from Avra to China Coal offering to sell the latter about 185,000mt of Indonesian steam coal. China Coal responded at about 2.00pm with a counter-offer which included a revised price. In its reply at about 2.20pm, Avra accepted the price offered for gearless vessels but put in a counter-offer regarding the price for geared vessels. At 4.14pm, China Coal sent the last of this series of e-mails stating \u201cConfirm your good offer as below\u201d. Essentially, by the First Four E-mails, the parties agreed on the quantity and quality of cargo, price, laycan and type of vessel to be deployed. The first of these e-mails also indicated that in respect of sampling or analysis, an \u201cIndependent Surveyor [was] to be mutually agreed\u201d. It was the First Four E-mails that grounded the Judge\u2019s finding that there was a concluded contract for the sale of the coal. Mr Zhou testified that there were also telephone discussions between himself and Mr Wei on 29 March 2017 that touched on price, though he could not recall most of the other contents of the discussions.', '6\\u2003Later on the evening of 29 March 2017, some four hours after the last of the First Four E-mails was sent out, Avra sent China Coal a draft contract entitled \u201cFOB Coal Sale Agreement\u201d containing its standard terms (\u201cthe Draft Contract\u201d) for China Coal\u2019s \u201creview\/confirmation\u201d. The Draft Contract contained terms reflecting the matters agreed on in the First Four E-mails, as well as other terms such as nomination of vessels, loading terms and allocation of risk. Relevant to this dispute are cll 7 and 8 (\u201cthe surveyor clauses\u201d) as well as cl 26 (an entire agreement clause with both \u201csubject-to-signature\u201d and \u201cBuyer\u2019s nomination\u201d provisos):', '7\\u2003On 6 April 2017, China Coal replied to propose amendments to the Draft Contract. It did not revisit the matters agreed on in the First Four E-mails, the surveyor clauses, or the entire agreement clause in cl 26. Instead, China Coal proposed amendments to clauses dealing with the minimum specifications for the vessels China Coal was to nominate, demurrage, loading terms, force majeure, limitation of liability, payment conditions, and remedies. Avra rejected all of China Coal\u2019s proposed amendments, save for an amendment to cl 10.2, reiterating that the other clauses were either \u201cnon-negotiable terms from [the] shipper\u201d or \u201cstandard terms as accepted in business confirmation and previous contracts\u201d. This exchange concluded with Avra executing the final draft of the Draft Contract on 18 April 2017 and sending it to China Coal asking the latter to execute the final draft and to return a scanned copy to Avra.', '8\\u2003China Coal did not execute the final draft despite a reminder sent by Avra on 2 May 2017 and a \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d e-mail on 3 May 2017 seeking that China Coal confirm that it would perform its obligation to purchase the Cargo. This e-mail went on to state that the signing of the final draft was a mere formality and that a binding agreement had come into existence between the parties. On 4 May 2017, China Coal e-mailed Avra as follows:', '9\\u2003Parties met on 14 May 2017 to attempt to settle their differences but could not agree. Avra then sent a lawyers\u2019 letter to China Coal, reiterating the point made in its \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d e-mail that China Coal\u2019s execution of the final draft was only a formality that did not affect the conclusion of the contract. In a letter dated 19 May 2017, China Coal indicated its position that it did not breach any contract because no contract came into force by virtue of cl 26. There was a cryptic reference to \u201cWe didn\u2019t sent [sic] you our signed copy or nominated a performing vessel, so this Contract is not come into force \u2026 all these situations we have already noticed you through telephone in April and on the conference made on 4th May \u2026\u201d, but counsel for both sides confirmed at the hearing before us that no evidence was led regarding the contents of the phone calls or conference. We therefore say no more about this.', '10\\u2003On 29 May 2017, Avra\u2019s lawyers wrote to China Coal purporting to formally terminate the contract on the basis of the latter\u2019s \u201cmaterial breaches\u201d or \u201canticipatory repudiatory and\/or repudiatory breach\u201d of contract. It is not disputed that China Coal never sent any vessel nomination to Avra or procured any letter of credit. On 7 August 2017, Avra filed the suit against China Coal claiming damages for breach of contract which led to the present appeal.', '11\\u2003It is at this point relevant to introduce facts relating to previous dealings between the parties as they were relied on, mainly by China Coal, but also to an extent by Avra, to demonstrate what the parties\u2019 understanding and intentions were when they were dealing with each other in March and April 2017.', '12\\u2003The parties had transacted with each other on three previous occasions, making a total of four transactions with the inclusion of the one that is at issue in this appeal: GD at [35]\u2013[39].

In the 2015 dealing, the parties\u2019 positions were reversed \u2013 it was Avra who failed to execute the draft formal contract and China Coal who insisted that the parties had nevertheless entered into a concluded contract. Avra informed China Coal that it was unable to meet the agreed laycan due to its supplier\u2019s difficulties, and proposed a new laycan which would delay delivery by 15 days. China Coal did not accept the new laycan, replying instead that Avra\u2019s delay had caused China Coal to breach its own delivery obligations in an onward sale and that its legal team would \u201cfollow [up on] the issue\u201d with Avra soon.

The Victim recalled one occasion where the Respondent punched her in the eye and caused it to turn red because a blood vessel burst.

When the Respondent returned home, she complained about the smell, ostensibly because her dog was very annoyed by it. When the Victim explained that she was having a headache, the Respondent asked her to hand over the glass bottle. She then held the glass bottle in her hand with the base of the glass bottle protruding out and used it to hit the Victim\u2019s face somewhere below her left eye several times.

These three patents (the \u201cprocess patents\u201d) were valid and subsisting at the material time. 4', 'It was undisputed that Zyfas did not declare the existence of the process patents when it applied to the HSA to register Myborte as a therapeutic product.', '5\\u2003Zyfas\u2019s application was approved by the HSA on 5 July 2019. 5', 'Shortly thereafter, Millennium discovered that Zyfas had obtained registration for Myborte and contacted Zyfas to ask for a copy of its declaration made in its application to the HSA. Zyfas took the position that the manufacturing process for bortezomib in Myborte did not infringe the process patents and that there was therefore no need to declare the process patents. 6', '6\\u2003On 19 August 2019, Millennium filed OS 1034 seeking a declaration that Zyfas\u2019s declaration to the HSA under reg 23(2) of the Health Products (Therapeutic Products) Regulations 2016 (S 329\/2016) (\u201cTPR\u201d) contained a statement that was false or misleading in a material particular or omitted to disclose a matter that was material to the application for the registration of Myborte. It also sought costs for OS 1034.', '7\\u2003Therapeutic products are regulated under the Health Products Act (Cap 122D, 2008 Rev Ed) (\u201cHPA\u201d) and the TPR. All therapeutic products must be registered before they can be supplied in Singapore. Regulation 23(1) of the TPR requires the HSA to consider, in dealing with an application for registration, whether a patent under the Patents Act (Cap 221, 2005 Rev Ed) (\u201cPatents Act\u201d) is in force in respect of the therapeutic product. Regulation 23(2) stipulates that the applicant must furnish a declaration to the HSA stating whether there is a patent under the Patents Act in force in respect of the therapeutic product and whether the applicant is the proprietor of the patent. Where the applicant is not the proprietor of the patent, reg 23(3) states that it has to provide information about the proprietor of the patent and state certain things. Under reg 24(1)(a)(ii), where a court has determined that the applicant\u2019s declaration contains a statement that is false or misleading in a material particular or omits to disclose any matter that is material to the application, the HSA may cancel the registration of the therapeutic product.', '8\\u2003Regulations 23 to 25 of the TPR, which form part of the registration scheme, are set out below:', '9\\u2003Recently, this court considered the above registration scheme in Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc v Drug Houses of Australia Pte Ltd and another appeal [2019] SGCA 31 (\u201cDrug Houses of Australia\u201d). In that case, the same patent proprietor, Millennium, commenced an action against Drug Houses of Australia Pte Ltd (\u201cDHA\u201d) for obtaining registration of bortezomib as a therapeutic product without declaring the existence of the process patents. DHA\u2019s position was that its process for manufacturing bortezomib did not infringe Millennium\u2019s patents and the patents therefore did not have to be disclosed. DHA applied to strike out Millennium\u2019s statement of claim on the ground that it disclosed no reasonable cause of action and the High Court judge permitted certain claims to be struck out.', '10\\u2003On appeal, this court restored the claims and held that Millennium\u2019s patents fell within the description set out in reg 23(2)(a) of the TPR (Drug Houses of Australia at [2]). Although DHA averred that its product did not infringe the processes protected by Millennium\u2019s patents, this court held that DHA had to declare the existence of the patents and then state that the patents were invalid or would not be infringed by the doing of the act for which the registration was sought. It was then for HSA to decide whether to invoke reg 23(5) to require DHA to serve a notice on Millennium as the proprietor of the patents (Drug Houses of Australia at [3]). The suit in Drug Houses of Australia was eventually discontinued before trial.'"}

For the purpose of this judgment, the active Receivers are the third to fifth named respondents.', '4\\u2003Given the nature of the factual disputes in these appeals, we set out some background to the commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings and the making of the bankruptcy orders in Indonesia.', '5\\u2003By way of a facility agreement dated 26 October 2011 and subsequently amended on 20 December 2011, PT Bank Artha Graha Internasional Tbk (\u201cBAG\u201d) granted a loan of IDR200bn to PT Megalestari Unggul (\u201cMLU\u201d). The majority shareholder of MLU is Mr Tannos, who holds 60% of MLU\u2019s shares. The appellants are alleged to be the guarantors of the loan to MLU, by way of four deeds of personal guarantee purportedly signed by the appellants and dated 26 October 2011.', '6\\u2003MLU was unable to repay the loan to BAG when it fell due on 26 October 2012. BAG sent several letters of demand to MLU from December 2012 to May 2013, but to no avail. BAG subsequently assigned its accounts receivables to another Indonesian company in November 2015, which in turn assigned all its receivables to PT Senja Imaji Prisma (\u201cPT Senja\u201d) on 2 December 2016. PT Senja assigned a small part of its receivables to Satrio Wibowo and Jeffri Pane. The debt arising from the loan to MLU was accordingly owed to the following creditors in these proportions:', '(a)\\u2003PT Senja as to approximately 90% of the debt;', '(b)\\u2003Satrio Wibowo as to approximately 5% of the debt; and', '(c)\\u2003Jeffri Pane as to approximately 5% of the debt.', '7\\u2003Under Indonesian law (Law No. 37 of 2004 on Bankruptcy and Suspension of Obligation for Payment of Debts (\u201cthe Indonesian Bankruptcy Law\u201d)), a process known as Penundaan Kewajiban Pembayaran Utang (\u201cPKPU\u201d) exists. A creditor who suspects that a debtor may default on its obligations may petition the court to make a PKPU order. The making of a PKPU order temporarily suspends the debtor\u2019s repayment obligations, so that the debtor may propose a composition plan to its creditors for the restructuring of its loans. If the debtor fails to propose a composition plan that is approved by the requisite majority of its creditors, this will lead to the making of a bankruptcy order against the debtor. In effect, the PKPU proceedings require the debtor to initiate an acceptable restructuring or face bankruptcy. On 8 December 2016, PT Senja commenced PKPU proceedings against MLU and the appellants, as guarantors. For the reasons outlined above, this was in effect the precursor to the eventual making of a bankruptcy order against each of the appellants and MLU. Between 20 December 2016 and 23 December 2016, PT Senja attempted to serve the notice of the PKPU proceedings on the appellants at their registered address at Depok, Indonesia. An advertisement of the filing of PKPU proceedings was also placed in the Rakyat Merdeka, a local Indonesian newspaper with limited circulation.', '8\\u2003On 9 January 2017, the matter was heard by the Commercial Court of the Central Jakarta District Court. MLU was represented by counsel, but none of the appellants nor their counsel were present. The court granted the application and ordered the parties to undergo an interim debt rescheduling for 45 days to arrive at a composition plan that was agreeable to the creditors. We refer to the decision given on 9 January 2017 as \u201cthe PKPU Decision\u201d.', '9\\u2003The PKPU Decision was followed by three creditors\u2019 meetings between 20 January 2017 and 17 February 2017. It was here that the appellants made their first appearance in the proceedings through their counsel. The appellants\u2019 counsel contended that the appellants had not received notice of the PKPU application or the PKPU Decision. The appellants also argued that the personal guarantees they had allegedly given in relation to the MLU loan were fraudulently obtained and invalid, as reflected in a number of related Indonesian proceedings that had been commenced in relation to the MLU loan and the guarantees.', '10\\u2003As the creditors\u2019 meetings did not result in a successful composition plan, at the hearing on 22 February 2017, the Indonesian court pronounced MLU insolvent and the appellants bankrupt and appointed the first and second respondents as Receivers to administer the insolvency process. We refer to the decision given on 22 February 2017 as \u201cthe Bankruptcy Decision\u201d. The third respondent was subsequently added as a Receiver on 17 April 2017.', '11\\u2003On 28 December 2017, the Receivers filed Originating Summons No 1468 of 2017 in the Singapore High Court to recognise the bankruptcy orders against MLU and the appellants.

{"casename":"2020_SGCA_86","fact":"'4\\u2003The relevant facts for the purposes of this appeal are not in dispute, and the exchanges between the parties in relation to the defects were comprehensively set out by the Judge (see the High Court\u2019s decision in Thio Keng Thay v Sandy Island Pte Ltd [2019] SGHC 175 (\u201cthe Judgment\u201d)). We shall therefore only set out the salient facts for the purposes of our decision.', '5\\u2003The appellant was the developer of Sandy Island, a collection of 18 waterfront villas located in Sentosa Cove. 1', 'By way of the SPA, the respondent purchased a four-storey detached bungalow at 7 Sandy Island, Singapore 098243 in Sentosa Cove at the price of $14.32m (\u201cthe Property\u201d) from the appellant. The appellant\u2019s main contractor for the development was YTL Construction (S) Pte Ltd (\u201cYTL\u201d).', '6\\u2003The SPA was in the standard form prescribed by r 12(1) of the Housing Developers Rules (Cap 130, R1, 2008 Rev Ed) (\u201cHousing Developers Rules\u201d). The relevant clauses of the SPA, viz, the appellant\u2019s obligations in relation to the building and the defects liability period (\u201cDLP\u201d), were as follows: 2', '7\\u2003The respondent received notice of vacant possession from the appellant on 28 February 2012 and took possession of the Property on 15 March 2012. Soon after entering into possession, the respondent complained of numerous defects in the Property. On 5 April 2012, the respondent, through his personal assistant, sent to the appellant an email that included a table listing some 277 defects which he had discovered in the Property. 3', 'This table referred to numbered photographs of each defect but the photographs were not sent with the email. The respondent sent an additional email to the appellant on 19 April 2012, alleging the existence of some fundamental defects, including extensive leaks which were concealed by coats of paint, failures of design, workmanship, materials and\/or supervision and requested that rectification works be carried out. 4', 'The appellant replied, seeking access to the Property in order to inspect the defects.', '8\\u2003Eventually, the parties carried out a joint inspection of the Property on 3 May 2012. In an email dated 15 May 2012, the appellant replied that from its information, most of the alleged defects in the respondent\u2019s list of defects were not truly defects and were capable of rectification within a reasonable period of time. Whilst it made no admissions as to the respondent\u2019s allegations and reserved all its rights, the appellant nonetheless asked for access to investigate the defects, establish the causes of the same and propose rectification steps. However, despite the appellant\u2019s provision of numerous method statements to the respondent, the latter refused to grant the appellant permission to carry out rectification works, on the basis that the proposed works were unsatisfactory and insufficient. Eventually, as the parties remained at an impasse, on 16 July 2014, the respondent, after conducting two tender exercises, engaged a new contractor, JTA Construction Pte Ltd (\u201cJTA Construction\u201d), to carry out the rectification works.', '9\\u2003On 10 October 2016, the respondent instituted High Court Suit No 1073 of 2016 against the appellant on the basis that the latter had breached certain express and implied terms of the SPA. It was not in contention that although the respondent had initially sought to invoke cl 17 of the SPA, his suit was premised on claims under the common law. He sought:', '(a)\\u2003damages for the costs of engaging JTA Construction to rectify a total of 492 defects in the Property (excluding the lifts) (\u201cthe general defects\u201d) in the sum of S$894,688.10;', '(b)\\u2003damages for the costs incurred in engaging independent third parties to investigate the defects in the Property in the sum of S$129,372.29;', '(c)\\u2003damages for the loss of the use of Property from 15 March 2012 to 28 May 2015 in the sum of S$867,519.64; and', '(d)\\u2003damages for the costs of engaging contractors to rectify the lifts in the Property (\u201cthe lift defects\u201d), to be assessed.', '10\\u2003The respondent alleged a total of 492 defects. 5', 'The appellant admitted to 222 defects in full and 85 defects in part, 6', 'but emphasised that it had been prevented by the respondent from accessing the Property to carry out rectification works.'"}
{"casename":"2020_SGCA_87","fact":"'5\\u2003The appellant, Mr Dennis Kam Thai Leong (\u201cMr Kam\u201d), is a self-described investor and entrepreneur. In the course of his business activities, he became a shareholder and director of Accelera Precious Timber & Strategic Agriculture Ltd (\u201cAPTSA\u201d), a Cayman Islands incorporated company with limited liability. APTSA in turn owned a majority stake in PT Aceh Rubber Industries (\u201cPT ARI\u201d), an Indonesia incorporated company which owned and operated a rubber factory in Aceh, Indonesia, and of which Mr Kam was appointed a Komisaris (or commissioner). Mr Kam was also the director and sole shareholder of Perfect Earth Management Pte Ltd (\u201cPEM\u201d), a Singapore incorporated company which was utilised to channel the loan moneys (the subject matter of this action) to PT ARI to be used as working capital.', '6\\u2003The respondent, Asian Infrastructure Ltd (\u201cAIL\u201d), is a company owned and controlled by Mr Malcolm Chang (\u201cMr Chang\u201d). Mr Chang also owned and controlled a number of other corporate entities including ARI Investments Ltd (\u201cARI\u201d) and Infraavest Private Ltd (\u201cInfraavest\u201d) which are of particular relevance to this case.', '7\\u2003The present appeal arises out of two personal guarantees Mr Kam entered into in relation to two loans extended by AIL to PEM. Though both loans were extended to PEM, they were in reality for the purposes of PT ARI. Mr Chang preferred the borrower of the loans to be a Singapore incorporated company for ease of enforcement, hence the involvement of PEM.', '8\\u2003The first loan, which was for a sum of US$500,000, was extended by AIL on 23 September 2013 and was due to be repaid on 23 December 2013 with a monthly interest rate of 1%. Mr Kam provided a personal guarantee on the same day for the repayment of PEM\u2019s obligations. By mid-January 2014, only US$150,000 had been repaid by PT ARI on behalf of PEM. AIL subsequently agreed to extend the repayment date for the balance sum to 31 December 2014.', '9\\u2003The second loan, which was for a sum of US$650,000, was extended by AIL on 11 March 2014 and was due to be repaid on 31 December 2014 with interest at the same rate of 1% per month. Mr Kam again provided a personal guarantee for the repayment of PEM\u2019s obligations. It is undisputed between the parties that PEM did not make any further payments to AIL under both loans.', '10\\u2003AIL commenced proceedings in the suit below against Mr Kam on 2 May 2017 to enforce the personal guarantees for PEM\u2019s obligations under the two loans. In his Defence, Mr Kam did not deny that the personal guarantees were valid when they were executed. Rather, he contended that the personal guarantees had been discharged and\/or were unenforceable for three reasons:', '(a)\\u2003First, the personal guarantees had been discharged pursuant to a \u201cjoint venture\u201d agreement entered into between PEM, PT ARI, APTSA, ARI and AIL sometime in September 2015 (\u201cthe Agreement\u201d).', '(b)\\u2003Second, a collateral oral agreement (\u201cthe alleged oral agreement\u201d) was reached in a meeting on 24 July 2015 at Infraavest\u2019s office in Singapore (\u201cthe 24 July 2015 Meeting\u201d) which discharged his liability under the personal guarantees.', '(c)\\u2003Third, AIL was estopped from denying that the personal guarantees had been discharged. The terms of the Agreement constituted a representation to Mr Kam that he would no longer be bound by the personal guarantees and he acted to his detriment in allowing Mr Chang and Mr Tin Jing Soon (\u201cMr Tin\u201d), an employee of Infraavest, to take control of PT ARI\u2019s business and by not taking steps to repay PEM\u2019s obligations leading to increased accrued interest. Alternatively, the same representation was made out to Mr Kam by AIL\u2019s failure to demand repayment of the loans extended to PEM from the signing of the Agreement up till 13 February 2017.', '11\\u2003In its Reply (Amendment No 3), AIL contended that the Agreement, properly construed, did not have the effect that Mr Kam claimed it did. In the alternative, AIL argued that the Agreement should be rescinded by virtue of a number of misrepresentations and breach of warranties on the part of Mr Kam. As there is no cross-appeal by AIL against the Judge\u2019s decision in dismissing its claims for misrepresentation and breach of warranty, we will not address them any further.', '12\\u2003It is clear from the foregoing that the dispute centres on the interpretation of the Agreement. We therefore take this opportunity to set out its salient features, including the key clauses which the parties are in dispute over. The Agreement is a relatively concise document comprising six pages and 12 pages of associated appendices. The preamble states that the parties to the Agreement are APTSA, ARI and AIL, although, as we will elaborate on below, PEM and PT ARI also signed the Agreement in acknowledgment. The parties broadly agree that the Agreement was entered into in a bid to facilitate a turnaround of PT ARI\u2019s business which by all accounts was struggling at the material time, with considerable debts at both the APTSA and PT ARI levels. Pursuant to this, Mr Chang through his special purpose vehicle, ARI, would inject up to US$750,000 in the form of a convertible loan to APTSA (in-effect PT ARI\u2019s parent company). When the convertible loan was fully converted, it would entitle ARI to 70% of APTSA\u2019s participating shares, which was the class of shares entitled to dividends. ARI would also be transferred 70% of APTSA\u2019s management shares, which was the class of shares entitled to vote at general meetings, while Mr Kam would hold the remaining 30% of both the participating and management shares. In order to prevent ARI\u2019s investment from being used to pay off existing debts, the Agreement contemplated a restructuring of APTSA\u2019s and PT ARI\u2019s existing obligations. This entailed negotiating substantial haircuts on the companies\u2019 existing debts and obtaining the agreement of existing shareholders that any loans extended to the companies would be paid off only with dividends. As part of this restructuring, PEM\u2019s loan obligations to AIL would be novated to ARI and Mr Kam\u2019s personal guarantees discharged, though the parties were at odds as to when this would occur under the Agreement.', '13\\u2003With this background in mind, we set out in full cll 4 and 5 of the Agreement, which are the material clauses dealing with ARI\u2019s investment into APTSA and the novation of PEM\u2019s loan obligations to ARI:', '14\\u2003It can be readily observed that cll 5(d) and 5(e) of the Agreement clearly contemplate that PEM\u2019s obligations to AIL under the two loan agreements would be novated to ARI and that Mr Kam\u2019s corresponding personal guarantees would be dissolved. The question, then, is when these events would take place, and whether there were any conditions precedent which needed to be satisfied. Mr Kam\u2019s pleaded case was that the novation of the loans and the discharge of the personal guarantees took place upon the signing of the Agreement in September 2015. As against this, AIL\u2019s pleaded case was that the novation of the loans and the discharge of Mr Kam\u2019s personal guarantees would only take place after the occurrence of a number of events, including the successful turnaround of PT ARI\u2019s business and the shutdown of PEM. AIL also took the position that the Agreement could not have novated PEM\u2019s obligations to AIL under the two loan agreements as PEM was not a party to the Agreement, and that a separate novation agreement was required.'"}

The respondent, Mero Asia Pacific Pte Ltd, was the main contractor of a development project (\u201cthe Project\u201d). On 3 August 2018, the appellant was engaged by the respondent as a subcontractor to fabricate, deliver and install 864 window panels at the Project site (\u201cthe Sub-Contract\u201d). 1', 'The appellant in turn, engaged a Chinese supplier, known as \u201cRontec\u201d, to fabricate the window panels for the Project.', '5\\u2003The dispute involved payments which were payable to the appellant under the Sub-Contract. The appellant commenced adjudication proceedings on the basis that no payment response was served in response to its payment claim dated 25 September 2019 (\u201cthe Payment Claim\u201d). The Payment Claim was for a total sum of $830,938.73, which substantially comprised payments due to the appellant for the fabrication of 864 window panels and related storage costs. It was not disputed that at the time of the Payment Claim, 489 out of the 864 window panels remained undelivered (\u201cundelivered panels\u201d). 2', 'The adjudication proceedings were heard over two days, on 25 October 2019 and 6 November 2019 leading to the issuance of an Adjudication Determination in the sum of $671,081.01 (\u201cthe Adjudicated Sum\u201d) on 15 November 2019.', '6\\u2003For the purposes of this appeal, the only relevant issue arising from the adjudication proceedings was whether the appellant was entitled to payment for the undelivered panels that had been fabricated but not delivered. The appellant submitted that it was so entitled by virtue of s 7(2)(c) of the Act, while the respondent contended otherwise that the appellant was only entitled to payment upon delivery of all the undelivered panels. 3', 'The adjudicator followed the High Court decision of Chuang Long Engineering Pte Ltd v Nan Huat Aluminium & Glass Pte Ltd [2019] 4 SLR 901 (\u201cChuang Long\u201d) and held that the appellant was entitled to claim payment for the undelivered panels valued under s 7(2) of the Act. The appellant also claimed storage costs for \u201cmaterials \u2026 kept in [its] warehouse for 6 months\u201d. The \u201cmaterials\u201d here referred to the undelivered panels and this claim for storage costs was included as part of the Adjudicated Sum.', '7\\u2003In the appellant\u2019s written submissions for the adjudication proceedings (\u201cappellant\u2019s AD Submissions\u201d), the appellant claimed that it was entitled to payment as it had \u201ccompleted all of the supply works\u201d and that \u201csome of the materials [were] stored at [the appellant\u2019s] warehouse and some [were] stored at the [respondent\u2019s] warehouse\u201d. 4', 'Throughout the adjudication proceedings, it was the appellant\u2019s case that it had control over all the undelivered panels and was hence, willing and able to perform the Sub-Contract, ie, deliver the undelivered window panels to the Project site. The appellant, however, failed to disclose the difficulty that it had encountered in obtaining the undelivered panels from Rontec. These facts, which will be elaborated below, were crucial in our dismissal of the appeal.', '8\\u2003After the issuance of the AD, it transpired that the appellant had, throughout the adjudication proceedings, faced difficulty in securing delivery of 169 of the undelivered panels (\u201cthe 169 panels\u201d) from Rontec. Following the AD, on 19 November 2019, the respondent asked the appellant to confirm if it would deliver the undelivered panels in exchange for the Adjudicated Sum. 5', 'The appellant did not respond. Two days later, the appellant submitted an additional claim for the storage of \u201c3rd & 4th batch materials in Singapore warehouse\u201d, which presumably referred to the undelivered panels, at $15,000 per month for six months (\u201cthe November Storage Claim\u201d). 6', 'On 22 November 2019, Rontec emailed the respondent and introduced itself as the supplier of the window panels for the Project. Rontec informed the respondent in the same email that it had withheld the 169 panels in the light of ongoing disputes with the appellant. Rontec then offered to sell those panels directly to the respondent for a sum of S$251,791.59 (RMB1.3m). 7', 'On 7 December 2019, the appellant exercised a lien on the goods that it had supplied to the respondent and suspended all works in relation to the Project.', '9\\u2003Following Rontec\u2019s contact with the respondent, the respondent engaged a lawyer in China, visited Rontec\u2019s factory in China on 2 December 2019 and confirmed that Rontec indeed had possession of the 169 panels. 8', 'The respondent then requested documentation from the appellant in support of its November Storage Claim and proposed a visit to the appellant\u2019s warehouse to physically verify that the undelivered panels were in the appellant\u2019s possession as claimed. 9', 'The appellant once again did not respond to this request. On 9 December 2019, the respondent applied in Originating Summons No 1448 of 2019 (\u201cthe Suit\u201d) to set aside the AD on the grounds of fraud and breach of natural justice.', '10\\u2003The appellant sought to explain the background of its dispute with Rontec.

In or around December 2016, the Appellant lent $565,000 to the Debtor. The Debtor agreed to return the Appellant $265,000 on 5 January 2017 and $330,000 on 28 March 2017.', '5\\u2003The Debtor ran into financial difficulties, and did not make the scheduled repayments. In April 2017, the Appellant became worried that the Debtor would not be able to repay the debt and from then on frequently pressed the Debtor for repayment.', '6\\u2003In May 2017, an institutional creditor took out bankruptcy proceedings against the Debtor on the basis of another debt, as a result of which he was made a bankrupt in July 2017. Thereafter, the Debtor \u201c[tried] hard to annul the bankruptcy order\u201d. He was advised by his trustee in bankruptcy that if all his creditors agreed to an annulment, the bankruptcy order could be annulled.', '7\\u2003Sometime between July and September 2017, the Debtor proposed to the Appellant that his mother, the Respondent, act as guarantor for the sums owed. The Debtor explained that the Respondent was in the course of selling her properties, and that she could help repay his debt from the sale proceeds of the properties.', '8\\u2003The Debtor then told the Respondent that he was in financial trouble, and asked her to guarantee his debt to the Appellant. He explained that he would continue to repay the loan, and that she would only be required to pay the loan on his behalf if he defaulted on his payment. The Respondent agreed to give the guarantee.', '9\\u2003Thereafter, the Appellant and the Debtor met the Respondent. At the meeting, the Appellant informed the Respondent that he had given a large loan to the Debtor and asked if it was true that she was selling her properties. The Respondent confirmed that she was doing so, and that she was agreeable to guaranteeing the loan so that if the Debtor did not repay it, she would do so from the sale proceeds of her properties.', '10\\u2003In mid-September 2017, the Appellant gave the Debtor a document entitled \u201cDeed of Guarantee\u201d to be signed by the Respondent. He asked the Debtor to arrange for the Respondent to execute the Guarantee before a witness.', '11\\u2003Under the Guarantee, it was acknowledged that the sum of $490,000 remained outstanding to the Appellant, as the \u201cCreditor\u201d, and that the Respondent would act as the \u201cGuarantor\u201d for the Debtor. The salient terms of the Guarantee provided that:', '12\\u2003The Respondent received the Guarantee from the Debtor, who read it to her and asked her to sign it before a lawyer. On 28 September 2017, the Respondent took the Guarantee to a lawyer, who read the document and translated it into Mandarin for her. The lawyer explained that if the Debtor defaulted on the payment of the loan, she would have to pay the Appellant from the sale proceeds of her properties. After witnessing the Respondent\u2019s signing of the Guarantee, the lawyer appended his signature as a witness, and wrote next to it that he had \u201c[o]nly explained this document to [the Respondent] \u2013 not acting as her lawyer\u201d.', '13\\u2003The signed Guarantee was passed to the Appellant, who returned it to the Respondent after amendments were made to include a timeline for repayment. The Respondent signed against the amendments.', '14\\u2003After some time, the Debtor informed the Respondent that he could not cope with the payments, and asked for her help. On 21 November 2017, the Respondent paid the Appellant the sum of $40,000 from the sale proceeds of her Kampong Eunos property. Thereafter, she did not make any further payments.', '15\\u2003On 27 February 2018, the Appellant messaged the Respondent, stating that she had defaulted on the payment terms in the Guarantee, which provided that $150,000 of the sale proceeds from the Kampong Eunos property were payable on or before 11 November 2017, and that the sum of $5,000 was payable on or before the 15th day of each month, beginning 15 February 2018. In view of her default, the Appellant stated that he was demanding the repayment of all the outstanding sums immediately. The Respondent did not make any payment. On 28 March 2018, the Appellant lodged a proof of debt for the sum of $447,000 against the Debtor, who remained a bankrupt.'"}
{"casename":"2020_SGCA_9","fact":"'2\\u2003The first respondent in both appeals, Jurong Aromatics Corp Pte Ltd (\u201cJAC\u201d), is a Singapore company that was incorporated for the purposes of constructing, developing and operating a condensate splitter integrated with an aromatics plant on Jurong Island (\u201cthe Plant\u201d). The Plant was designed to process condensate feedstock and other raw materials in order to produce aromatics and petroleum products.', '3\\u2003In April 2011, a syndicate of financiers (\u201cthe Senior Lenders\u201d) provided loans to JAC totalling approximately US$1.68bn. By way of a debenture dated 30 April 2011 (\u201cthe Debenture\u201d) entered into between JAC and BNP Paribas, Singapore Branch (\u201cthe Agent\u201d) for and on behalf of the Senior Lenders, the Senior Lenders obtained from JAC a comprehensive security package over all of JAC\u2019s undertaking and assets to secure their loans. In particular, by cl 3.1(c) of the Debenture, JAC granted in favour of the Agent a first fixed charge over all its assets listed in that clause, including all its present and future book debts. By cl 4.1, JAC granted in favour of the Agent a first floating charge over its undertaking and all its present and future assets, including all assets charged under cl 3.1.', '4\\u2003The appellant in Civil Appeal No 28 of 2019, BP Singapore Pte Ltd (\u201cBP\u201d), and the appellant in Civil Appeal No 29 of 2019, Glencore Singapore Pte Ltd (\u201cGlencore\u201d), were both suppliers and customers of JAC. In March 2011, they each entered into feedstock supply and product offtake agreements with JAC (the \u201cBP-JAC feedstock supply agreement\u201d, \u201cBP-JAC product offtake agreement\u201d, \u201cGlencore-JAC feedstock supply agreement\u201d and \u201cGlencore-JAC product offtake agreement\u201d, collectively \u201cthe Trade Agreements\u201d). Under each feedstock supply agreement, JAC agreed to purchase feedstock from the particular supplier for processing into aromatics and petroleum products. Under each product offtake agreement, JAC agreed to sell the products back to the relevant supplier of the feedstock.', '5\\u2003The Glencore-JAC feedstock supply agreement and Glencore-JAC product offtake agreement themselves expressly provide, by cl 10(a) and cl 2.6(f) respectively, that parties are not entitled to exercise a right of set-off in respect of any sums due under those agreements. Parties subsequently varied these terms by way of a set-off agreement dated 23 December 2014 (\u201cthe Set-Off Agreement\u201d), under which Glencore and JAC agreed to set-off mutual claims arising out of the Glencore-JAC feedstock supply agreement and Glencore-JAC product offtake agreement. It is common ground that the net effect of the Set-Off Agreement is the creation of a debt (\u201cthe Set-Off Agreement Debt\u201d) payable by Glencore to JAC. No such debt is owed by BP.', '6\\u2003JAC ran into financial difficulties sometime in 2014. The operations of the Plant were shut down in December 2014. Eventually, on 28 September 2015, Mr Cosimo Borelli and Mr Jason Kardachi, respectively the second and third respondents in these appeals, were appointed receivers and managers of JAC pursuant to the terms of the Debenture. We will refer to them as \u201cthe Receivers\u201d hereafter. The appellants were given notice of this appointment on 29 September 2015.', '7\\u2003Later that year, both BP and Glencore issued enforcement notices stating their intention, amongst other things, to apply for the winding-up of JAC. As at November 2015, Glencore quantified the amount which JAC owed it as being US$162,293,222.38 and BP quantified the amount which JAC owed it as being US$106,433,075.32. There was, subsequently, dispute about some of the amounts claimed by Glencore but it was common ground in these proceedings that nevertheless, prior to the appointment of the Receivers, JAC was substantially indebted to both appellants as a result of the Trade Agreements. We refer to this indebtedness as \u201cthe JAC indebtedness\u201d.', '8\\u2003The plan to wind up JAC was postponed because the Receivers put forward a plan for the continued functioning of the Plant while a purchaser for the Plant was sought. Negotiations in this regard between the appellants and the Receivers resulted in an agreement dated 19 April 2016 (\u201cthe Tolling Agreement\u201d) under which the appellants would be able to use the Plant for production of their products until its sale. As a condition precedent to entering into the Tolling Agreement, the appellants required that the Senior Lenders provide an irrevocable undertaking in respect of two matters: (a) not to remove the Receivers from their position as JAC\u2019s receivers until the tolling and transitional period thereafter was completed; and (b) not to take any step that would have the effect of frustrating, preventing or interfering with the performance of the Receivers\u2019 and\/or JAC\u2019s obligations under the Tolling Agreement. Various letters of undertaking to this effect were accordingly issued by the Senior Lenders prior to the commencement of the tolling process under the Tolling Agreement.', '9\\u2003Essentially, tolling was a process in which the appellants utilised the Plant to process the feedstock they supplied into aromatics and petroleum products which they could sell. In exchange, JAC was to be paid a monthly tolling fee by the appellants for the use of the Plant. Between August 2016 and August 2017, the appellants duly paid the monthly tolling fees under the Tolling Agreement. They did not, however, pay the tolling fee for the month of August 2017 amounting to some US$5.46m due from each of Glencore and BP (\u201cthe Tolling Fee Debt\u201d).', '10\\u2003Instead, on 28 August 2017, Glencore, with the support of BP, instituted winding-up proceedings against JAC. This action was followed on 20 September 2017 by a letter from the appellants to JAC in which they asserted, for the first time, that the Tolling Fee Debt was subject to insolvency set-off against the JAC indebtedness. JAC was ordered to be wound up on 18 February 2019.', '11\\u2003In the meantime, in May 2017, a purchaser for the Plant, ExxonMobil Asia Pacific Pte Ltd (\u201cExxonMobil\u201d), had been found. BP, Glencore, JAC and ExxonMobil entered into a transitional agreement dated 16 June 2017 (\u201cthe Transitional Agreement\u201d). BP, Glencore and JAC entered into a supplemental agreement in respect of the Transitional Agreement dated 16 June 2017 as well (\u201cthe Transitional Supplemental Agreement\u201d). These agreements facilitated the \u201chot transition\u201d of the Plant. A \u201chot transition\u201d\u2019, as opposed to a \u201ccold\u201d one, would allow the Plant to be transferred to ExxonMobil while operations were ongoing rather than JAC having to shut down the Plant before effecting its transfer. The sale of the Plant in this way would fetch a substantially higher price than if it were sold to ExxonMobil in a \u201ccold transition\u201d.', '12\\u2003The appellants had agreed to undertake various obligations to facilitate the hot transition. One of these was their agreement pursuant to cl 2.1 of the Transitional Supplemental Agreement to pay JAC a sum of money known as the Final Payment Amount. The Final Payment Amount represented the value of certain feedstock (\u201cthe Initial Inventory\u201d), that JAC had transferred to the appellants at the start of the tolling process and which the appellants were obliged to return to JAC at the end of tolling pursuant to cl 5.3 of the Tolling Agreement. For present purposes, it suffices to note that the Initial Inventory consisted of that residual base of feedstock that, for physical reasons, could not be extracted from the Plant\u2019s processing machinery. The Final Payment Amount, a sum of US$16,205,334.86, was not paid when due and, as with the Tolling Fee Debt, the appellants asserted on 20 September 2017 that the Final Payment Amount was subject to insolvency set-off against the JAC indebtedness.', '13\\u2003As part of the entire tolling arrangement, the Receivers also agreed with Glencore and BP that they would receive a monetary incentive (\u201cthe Performance Incentive\u201d) if certain key performance indicators relating to the output capability of the Plant were achieved in the course of tolling. The appellants were eventually paid some US$110m on 28 August 2017 under this arrangement. This was also the date on which the sale of the Plant to ExxonMobil was completed.'"}
{"casename":"2020_SGCA_90","fact":"'188\\u2003The facts have been set out in detail in the majority judgment and I shall therefore mention only the more salient facts which are necessary for this judgment. I highlight at the outset that the factual account that the Applicant gave in his statements during the course of investigations differed significantly from the account that he gave during his oral testimony at the trial (\u201cthe 2014 trial\u201d) and his further oral testimony at the remitted hearing before the Judge.', '189\\u2003The Applicant\u2019s oral evidence at the 2014 trial was that he had been introduced by \u201cIzuchukwu\u201d to \u201cKingsley\u201d, an individual who had contacts in Singapore who would help him with his plans to purchase second-hand laptops for sale in Nigeria. 92', 'On the day of his departure from Nigeria, he met Kingsley and Izuchukwu at the airport there. Kingsley passed him the Black Luggage, told him it contained clothes and asked him to pass it to a contact in Singapore. The Applicant asserted that he did not know of this in advance and that he did not have any details of Kingsley\u2019s contact but agreed to do this nevertheless as a favour to Kingsley. The Applicant claimed that the request that he convey the Black Luggage assured him that there would be somebody waiting for him in Singapore. The fact that Kingsley had called this person from the Lagos airport further reassured him. 93', 'The Applicant claimed that he had opened the Black Luggage and saw clothes and a pair of shoes inside. 94', '190\\u2003When the Applicant arrived in Singapore on 13 November 2011, he experienced some delay in the immigration section of the airport. The Judge in Public Prosecutor v Hamidah Binte Awang and another [2015] SGHC 4 (\u201cHC (Acquittal)\u201d) at [52] observed that notwithstanding this delay, the Applicant remained composed and collected the Black Luggage before leaving the airport. The Applicant then took a taxi to Kim Tian Hotel in Geylang. This was because Kingsley had given him a \u201chotel card\u201d from Kim Tian Hotel. 95', 'However, after he reached the hotel, Kingsley called and told him that there was a change of plans and that he should stay at Hotel 81 in Chinatown instead as that hotel would be nearer to Kingsley\u2019s contact. 96', '191\\u2003 Upon reaching the said Hotel 81, the Applicant realised that he did not have enough Singaporean currency to pay for the room. He therefore walked out of the hotel to go to a moneychanger located across the road. 97', 'During this time, he left the Black Luggage in the hotel lobby for about 12 minutes because the hotel staff recommended that he do that. 98', '192\\u2003Subsequently, he took the Black Luggage and went to Clarke Quay to meet Hamidah at a bus stop. After meeting Hamidah, who was driving a car and who introduced herself as \u201cMaria\u201d, 99', 'he handed her the Black Luggage which was then placed in the car. He then got into her car and she suggested that they eat at an African restaurant. 100', 'As the restaurant was closed, 101', 'Hamidah offered him drinks kept in the trunk of her car. 102', 'The Applicant dropped his mobile phone accidentally into Hamidah\u2019s drink. 103', 'Later, he made his way back to Hotel 81.', '193\\u2003That night, Hamidah was arrested at the Woodlands Checkpoint when she tried to leave for Malaysia in her car with the Black Luggage inside. The drugs that were the subject of the Applicant\u2019s charge were found in the Black Luggage. The next morning, 14 November 2011, a team of CNB officers went to Hotel 81 to arrest the Applicant who was inside his room. A total of six statements were recorded from the Applicant after his arrest. These were the statements which contained the Applicant\u2019s various lies and omissions which became the centre of contention in these proceedings. I will elaborate on this subsequently.'"}
{"casename":"2020_SGCA_91","fact":"'4\\u2003The applicants were tried along with another co-accused person, Narenthiran s\/o Kathireson (\u201cB2\u201d), who faced four similar conspiracy to cheat charges, but was acquitted of the said charges following the trial. References to B2 were thereafter deleted from the cheating charges against the applicants, who were then convicted of the amended charges (see the GD at [7]).', '5\\u2003The amended charges alleged that on 30 April 2017, the applicants had engaged in a conspiracy to cheat four individuals (collectively, \u201cthe victims\u201d) and that pursuant to this conspiracy, Miah Sohel (\u201cV1\u201d) and Afsari Mohammad Malek (\u201cV2\u201d) had been deceived into believing that the applicants were police officers, and Hossain Mohommad Amir (\u201cV3\u201d) and Hossain Jalal (\u201cV4\u201d) had been deceived into believing that the applicants were personnel from the Criminal Investigation Department (\u201cCID\u201d). It was alleged that the applicants had known this to be false, and, that by such \u201cmanner of deception\u201d, B1 and B4 had dishonestly induced the victims to deliver to B1 a total of S$18,115 in cash and six mobile phones. B3 was also charged with having voluntarily caused hurt to V3 by punching him on the face and the abdomen.', '6\\u2003The applicants claimed that they had approached the victims because B1 had been told that V1 and V3 had been selling false safety certificates allegedly issued by A Star Safety Centre Pte Ltd (\u201cA Star\u201d), a company which B1 operated. In this regard, the applicants\u2019 position was that B1 had previously reported other individuals, including one \u201cSufon\u201d to the police for selling fake safety certificates. The applicants denied having told the victims they were police officers or CID personnel and argued instead that the victims had followed them back to B1\u2019s office (\u201cthe Office\u201d) because they knew that they were \u201cin the wrong\u201d. They denied taking money from the victims and claimed that V1, V2 and V3 had handed over their phones as it had been agreed that the applicants would delete their business contacts from the victims\u2019 phones, in exchange for not reporting the victims to the police.', '7\\u2003In convicting the applicants of the cheating charges, the trial judge found the victims to be internally consistent in their evidence and to have corroborated each other on material matters (see the GD at [115]). In particular, the trial judge observed that the victims had consistently rejected the applicants\u2019 accounts that they had been asked and had agreed to leave their phones behind so that the contacts and contents of their phones could be deleted, and had denied having been involved in the selling of fake safety certificates (see the GD at [119]). While the applicants took issue with the fact that the money which they had allegedly received from the victims as a result of cheating them was not recovered, which their counsel argued cast doubt on the victims\u2019 accounts, the trial judge noted that the Office was not searched immediately after the incident, and that a mini-mart, which was owned by B1\u2019s family and situated a short distance away from the Office, was not searched. The accused persons had travelled between the Office and the mini-mart on the date of the incident. While B1 and B2 were arrested on 30 April 2017, B3 and B4 were not arrested until after 30 April 2017 (see the GD at [128]).', '8\\u2003The trial judge observed that the victims\u2019 evidence was also corroborated by other witnesses as well as by external evidence. For instance, the prosecution adduced a statement from Jahangir, an employee of B1, which stated that one of the victims had told him that B1 had taken S$10,000 from him, and that Jahangir had told B1 to return the money, albeit to no avail. The trial judge considered that Jahangir\u2019s statement should be given full weight despite the fact that he did not give evidence since he would only have known about S$10,000 being taken from V3 if this had been told to him by the latter (see the GD at [131]).', '9\\u2003In contrast, the trial judge held that the applicants\u2019 evidence was largely illogical, unsubstantiated and quite incredible (see the GD at [148]). B1\u2019s story about having received a tip-off that V1 and V3 were selling fake certificates on the date of the incident was unbelievable. Further, B1\u2019s explanation as to why he had asked the victims to go to the Office, their willingness to do so, and B1\u2019s account as to why he had \u201cretained\u201d the victims\u2019 handphones made no sense (see the GD at [149]\u2013[151]). The applicants\u2019 assertions were also uncorroborated and contradicted by objective evidence (see the GD at [155]). Finally, the trial judge held that there were material discrepancies in the applicants\u2019 evidence in court, the account given in their statements, and their Case for the Defence, some of which related to material matters (see the GD at [160]). For the above reasons, the trial judge convicted the applicants on all the cheating charges.', '10\\u2003On the charge of voluntarily causing hurt against B3, the trial judge found V3\u2019s evidence to be credible, convincing, clear and internally consistent. V3 was also found to be a forthcoming witness whose testimony was supported by that of Mr Victor Kuah (\u201cMr Kuah\u201d), who was an independent eyewitness to the assault (see the GD at [165]\u2013[170]). B1\u2019s claim that V3 had grabbed his arm and his pouch when they were outside the Office made no sense if, as B1 claimed, V3 had amicably surrendered his phone to him in exchange for B1\u2019s agreement to not file a police report (see the GD at [172]). B1\u2019s and B3\u2019s evidence were also contradictory. The trial judge therefore convicted B3 on the charge for voluntarily causing hurt (see the GD at [176]).', '11\\u2003The applicants were each sentenced to a global term of 14 months\u2019 imprisonment for the four cheating charges. B3 was sentenced to an additional 2 weeks\u2019 imprisonment for the s 323 charge, making a total of 14 months and 2 weeks\u2019 imprisonment (see the GD at [200]). The Judge also made compensation orders, which are summarised at [9] of the GD.', '12\\u2003The applicants then filed an appeal against the convictions and sentences imposed. Before the High Court, they sought to challenge the findings of fact made by the trial judge. They argued that the victims should not be believed as (a) their evidence was internally and externally inconsistent; (b) they had been evasive and\/or lied and\/or embellished their evidence and had reason to collude against the applicants; and (c) there was no corroborative evidence to plug the weaknesses in the victims\u2019 testimonies. They argued that, in contrast, the applicants\u2019 testimonies were consistent and amply supported by external evidence, and that they had therefore adduced enough evidence to raise a reasonable doubt. In an oral judgment, the High Court dismissed the appeals against both conviction and sentence.'"}

As for psychological harm, both \nthe Trial Judge and the Judge held that this was a case of \u201cless serious \npsychological harm\u201d. The Trial Judge did so even though she proceeded \ncorrectly by taking into account the fact that the Respondent knew about the \nVictim\u2019s previous injuries because she was the person responsible for them. \nWhile we explained at [81] to [83] of the earlier judgment that we were puzzled \nby that finding, we emphasised that this was still a finding of fact that was not \nwithin the province of a criminal reference on questions of law. For that reason, \nwe do not think we can change the categorisation of psychological harm with \nits indicative starting range of three to six months\u2019 imprisonment.\n8 However, we explained at [88] of the earlier judgment that the fact that \nthe Respondent knew about the Victim\u2019s particular vulnerability because she \nwas the person responsible for it meant that the Respondent\u2019s level of \nculpability should be at a much higher level than if her awareness of the \nVictim\u2019s worsening eyesight had come solely from what the Victim told her. \nWe also observed at [78] that \u201c[c]oncomitant with psychological harm suffered \nby a victim is the level of culpability exhibited by an offender\u201d. \n9 In our view, the indicative starting range should be given a significant \nuplift to reflect the Respondent\u2019s high culpability. Bearing in mind the \nRespondent\u2019s use of the glass bottle, the entire relationship between the \nRespondent and the Victim and the persistent abuse culminating in the incident \non 17 May 2015, we think that the sentence of eight months\u2019 imprisonment \nshould be enhanced to 14 months\u2019 imprisonment to reflect more accurately the \ntrue level of the Respondent\u2019s culpability.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Bong Sim Swan, Suzanna[2020] SGCA 93\n610 On compensation, however, we decline to vary the order made by the \nJudge. Both the Trial Judge and the Judge agreed that there was psychological \nharm and on the categorisation of the psychological harm. However, it is not \nclear how they chose to compensate for it. The Trial Judge had awarded \ncompensation of $10,000 for pain and suffering without identifying the \nproportions for physical and psychological harm. The Judge reduced this on"}

The purpose and precise mechanics of the BMT structure are disputed, and we set these out only as far as they constitute the necessary background to these appeals.', '4\\u2003The BMT structure involved three back-to-back contracts per transaction, with each transaction being termed a \u201cstring sale\u201d. The \u201cimport leg\u201d involved a contract between GRIPT as seller and AOPL as intermediary buyer (\u201cGRIPT-AOPL contract\u201d); the \u201cintermediate leg\u201d involved a contract between AOPL as seller and an offshore entity (being either Arabian Commodities FZE (\u201cACF\u201d) or Tracon General Trading LLC (\u201cTracon\u201d)) as buyer; and the \u201cexport leg\u201d involved a contract between ACF or Tracon as seller and BSA as buyer. Not all legs of each string sale contract had the same governing law and exclusive jurisdiction (\u201cEJ\u201d) clauses, a point we will return to below.', '5\\u2003For each shipment of goods, BSA would transfer around 98.5% of the transaction\u2019s value to AOPL as payment. AOPL would place the funds in fixed deposits with SBI, and issue a mandate letter to SBI for the latter to issue an irrevocable payment undertaking (\u201cIPU\u201d) in favour of GRIPT. The fixed deposits were originally for a term of one year. Sometime after late 2014, the funds were instead placed in two-year fixed deposits to secure higher interest rates. Under the IPU, SBI promised to either procure a letter of credit due for payment within six months for 100% of the transaction\u2019s value, or, if the letter of credit was not issued, pay that sum to GRIPT within five days. Upon maturity of the fixed deposits, AOPL would retain some interest and return the balance to the Bunge Group. Because AOPL was required to maintain the two-year fixed deposits even whilst funds were paid out to GRIPT at six-month intervals, there was a need to periodically inject funds through \u201crollover\u201d transactions, these being fresh transactions for new shipments of goods.', '6\\u2003According to AOPL and Mr Bhasi, the true purpose of the BMT structure was interest arbitrage: The Bunge Group would engage in circular trade with itself, thereby bringing in large amounts of foreign funds to place in Indian banks in circumvention of Indian foreign exchange regulations. The Bunge Entities accepted that interest could be earned under the BMT structure but denied that the purpose was interest arbitrage.'"}

On 26 October 2016, at about 5.20am, he entered Singapore from Malaysia at the Woodlands Checkpoint riding a Malaysian-registered motorcycle with registration number JRN177 (\u201cthe Motorcycle\u201d). The registered owner of the Motorcycle was Lew Shyang Huei (\u201cLew\u201d), Beh\u2019s friend and ex-colleague. Beh\u2019s girlfriend, Ting Swee Ling (\u201cTing\u201d), was riding pillion on the Motorcycle.', '6\\u2003Beh was stopped at the checkpoint for a routine check by Police Constable Israel Rajan (\u201cPC Rajan\u201d). He was instructed by PC Rajan to lift up the Motorcycle\u2019s seat. In the storage compartment under the seat, a blue plastic bag (\u201cA1\u201d), stored beneath a black jacket, a rain-coat and rain-pants, was found, together with a power bank and a set of car keys. The power bank belonged to Yeo Kim Huat Mervin (\u201cAh Huat\u201d), Beh\u2019s friend. The car keys were for Beh\u2019s Malaysian-registered car. Upon opening A1 and finding several bundles of substance inside, PC Rajan activated the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (\u201cICA\u201d) Task Force.', '7\\u2003Sergeant Dave Ong Kah Huat (\u201cSgt Ong\u201d) from the ICA Task Force arrived at the motorcycle checking bay, together with Staff Sergeant Ganesh s\/o Amarthalingam (\u201cSSgt Ganesh\u201d), Senior Staff Sergeant Muhammad Khairul bin Khairudin (\u201cSSSgt Khairul\u201d) and Staff Sergeant Razif bin Rahim (\u201cSSgt Razif\u201d) from the Central Narcotics Bureau (\u201cCNB\u201d). SSSgt Khairul and SSgt Razif opened and examined the contents of the bundles in the presence of Beh and Ting. There were four bundles inside A1. The biggest bundle contained, among other things, three black bundles. One of the three black bundles (\u201cA1A4\u201d) contained several blister packages of Erimin-5 tablets. The second of the four bundles was wrapped in plastic (\u201cA1E\u201d) and contained 20 silver packages. The third of the four bundles contained a black bundle which in turn contained ten silver packages. The last of the four bundles was wrapped in a plastic bag and cling wrap (\u201cA1D\u201d) and contained, among other things, two black bundles (\u201cA1D5\u201d and \u201cA1D6\u201d respectively), one of which was opened and found to contain several silver packages.', '8\\u2003The seized drug exhibits contained not less than 742.82g of crystalline substance, which was analysed and found to contain not less than 499.97g of methamphetamine. The analysis of the drug exhibits, the HSA results and the chain of custody of the various drug exhibits were not disputed.', '9\\u2003It appears from court records that Lew, the owner of the Motorcycle that Beh rode into Singapore, was subsequently arrested in Singapore for some charges under the MDA which were unrelated to the charge here against Beh. On 20 July 2018, Lew was sentenced by the District Court to seven years\u2019 imprisonment (with effect from 29 April 2017) and five strokes of the cane for drug importation and possession of drug-related utensils. Lew was serving his imprisonment term here when the trial against Beh proceeded from July 2019. Lew is still serving his sentence.'"}
{"casename":"2020_SGCA_99","fact":"'2\\u2003The facts are straightforward. The judgment debtor in question is one Mr Danial Patrick Higgins (\u201cthe Debtor\u201d). He co-owned an apartment unit in Pasir Ris (\u201cthe Property\u201d) which was mortgaged to the second respondent, Malayan Banking Berhad (\u201cthe Bank\u201d). On 26 September 2016, judgment was entered against the Debtor in the sum of US$340,500 in favour of the appellant herein, Singapore Air Charter Pte Ltd (\u201cSAC\u201d). Two years later in March 2018, judgment for $394,254.13 against the Debtor was obtained by the first respondent herein, Peter Low & Choo LLC (\u201cPLC\u201d) on account of its legal fees when it represented the Debtor in the action taken by SAC against him. Because the Debtor did not settle the judgment debts, both his creditors took steps to enforce their respective judgments against the Property, using the execution procedures provided for by the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R5, 2014 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe Rules\u201d). These procedures are time-sensitive in that they are valid for only limited periods as prescribed by the relevant provisions in the Rules and the legislation regulating the ownership of registered land, the Land Titles Act (Cap 157, 2004 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe LTA\u201d). The Property is registered land falling under the LTA.', '3\\u2003We now digress from the facts to describe the provisions which set out the possible enforcement actions available to a judgment creditor in respect of real property owned by the judgment debtor. Thereafter, we will come back to the various steps taken by SAC and PLC to attach the Debtor\u2019s interest in the Property.', '4\\u2003As is well known, the LTA provides a comprehensive scheme for the ownership of immovable property in Singapore. Most land in Singapore, which term includes apartment units like the Property, is registered on the land-register maintained by the Registrar of Titles. All dealings with a piece of registered land must be entered in the land-register. Generally, interests in registered land must also be notified on the land-register to be effective. The foregoing is stated by way of general introduction only.', '5\\u2003Part XIII of the LTA is entitled \u201cWrits and Orders of Court\u201d (\u201cPart XIII\u201d). It is the chapter of the LTA that deals specifically with enforcement action taken by a judgment creditor against registered land belonging to a judgment debtor. There are sections in other parts of the LTA that might have some bearing on issues raised by an enforcement action, but any consideration must start with Part XIII.', '6\\u2003The primary sections of Part XIII that we need to have regard to are ss 132 and 134. We reproduce the sections later in this judgment (at [21]). At this point it is sufficient to give a general explanation of the same. Under s 132(1), in order for a parcel of land to be affected by a writ of execution or an order of court which empowers a third party to sell the same, that writ or order of court must be entered in the land-register. The registration of the writ or order will enable the Sheriff or the person named in the order to sell the land and execute a transfer of the land which can be registered against it in the land-register. Once registered, the writ remains valid for a year but, at the expiration of that year, the registration lapses: s 134(1). After the first writ has lapsed, the judgment creditor can still procure the issue of a renewed writ or a subsequent writ on the same judgment and tender the same for registration: s 134(2).', '7\\u2003To invoke the seizure provisions of the LTA, the judgment creditor has first to obtain a registrable instrument from the court. The procedure to do so is set out in O 47 of the Rules, the Order being entitled \u201cWrits of Seizure and Sale\u201d. Order 47 Rule 4(1)(a) provides that where a judgment creditor wishes to seize immovable property, that seizure shall be effected by registering an order of court in Form 96 (\u201cthe Form 96 Order\u201d) attaching the interest of the judgment debtor in the immovable property. Upon registration, that interest is deemed to be seized by the Sheriff. Under the Rules, the Form 96 Order remains in force for six months unless it is registered on the land-register within that period: O 47 r 4(1)(f).', '8\\u2003After registering the Form 96 Order, by O 47 r 4(1)(e), the judgment creditor must file a writ of seizure and sale in Form 83 (\u201cForm 83 Writ\u201d) and an undertaking, declaration and indemnity in Form 87. The Sheriff must then serve a copy of the Form 83 Writ, the corresponding Form 96 Order and the notice of seizure in Form 97 on the judgment debtor or, if the judgment debtor cannot be found, affix the Form 83 Writ to the immovable property: O 47 r 4(1)(e)(iii). Thereafter, the Sheriff can sell the interest of the judgment debtor in the property. The Form 83 Writ remains valid for 12 months from its date of issue but may be renewed: O 46 r 6(1).', '9\\u2003The essential question that has arisen in this case is whether it is the Form 96 Order or the Form 83 Writ which qualifies as the \u201cwrit of execution\u201d that must be registered under s 132(1) of the LTA.', '10\\u2003We now go back to the steps taken by the parties herein to attach the Property in satisfaction of their respective judgment debts.', '11\\u2003We list first the steps taken by SAC:', '12\\u2003As far as PLC was concerned, the steps it took were as follows:', '13\\u2003In the meantime, the Bank had been making efforts to sell the Property. These efforts resulted in an option to purchase being issued in November 2018 and in a mortgagee sale being effected on 13 December 2018. The proceeds of sale were more than sufficient to satisfy the indebtedness due to the Bank and the question then arose as the whether the Debtor\u2019s share of the surplus sales proceeds (\u201cthe surplus proceeds\u201d) ought to be paid to SAC or PLC.'"}
