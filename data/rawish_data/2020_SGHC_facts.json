In this section, I will canvass the salient facts whilst going through the parties\u2019 contrasting characterisations of the various key events.', '4\\u2003The basis of the Plaintiff\u2019s claim goes back to 2008 when the siblings\u2019 parents lived at another HDB flat situated at Block 12A, Ghim Moh Road #14-28, Singapore 271012 (\u201cthe old flat\u201d).

The purchase of the Flat was completed on 19 October 2011. In addition to his contribution towards the purchase price of the Flat, the Plaintiff claimed he paid in November 2011 another S$82,385 towards the interior design and renovation cost of the Flat. As will be made clear, the Flat was at the heart of the disagreement between the parties.', '5\\u2003The Father passed away in 2010. Upon his death, the Father\u2019s share in the old flat passed to the Deceased presumably, under the right of survivorship in a joint tenancy. The Deceased and the Defendant moved into the Flat in or about December 2011.', '6\\u2003According to the Plaintiff, he went to work in foreign exchange companies in Russia starting from 1995. Over the years, the Plaintiff continued working in the foreign exchange industry, first in Russia, then in Japan (Tokyo), Indonesia, Cambodia, Myanmar and finally in Vietnam where he is currently based.', '7\\u2003It was while he was working in Vietnam in 2006 that the Plaintiff met one Tran Thi Ngo Thanh, a Vietnamese lady who was his girlfriend at that point. They returned to Singapore together in 2007 and got married. With his wife, the Plaintiff has had a daughter and a son. The Plaintiff deposed in his AEIC 1', 'that his family of three (including his daughter who was born in November 2007) lived at the old flat for about a year with his parents and the Defendant prior to the Father\u2019s demise. According to the Defendant, the Plaintiff\u2019s wife and the Deceased had a big fight one day and the Deceased chased out the Plaintiff\u2019s family. 2', 'The Defendant testified the Plaintiff had to rent a flat to house his family. The Plaintiff\u2019s son was born in January 2013 after he acquired his own HDB flat in 2009.', '8\\u2003While working overseas, the Plaintiff claimed he made and lost a lot of money. When he made money, he said he would pass to the Deceased 30% of his salaries for safekeeping, starting in 2008. The first sum the Plaintiff handed to the Deceased was S$100,000 followed by S$28,000 which the Plaintiff deposed was used by his parents to repay the outstanding HDB loan on the old flat. It was also the Plaintiff\u2019s case that he doted on his younger brother so much that he gave the Defendant S$30,000 to help the latter buy a motor vehicle without the need to take out a car loan.', '9\\u2003On 9 April 2008, the Plaintiff won S$1m (\u201cthe lottery winnings\u201d) from S$500 worth of 4D lottery tickets that he bought. He received the cheque for S$1m issued by Singapore Pools the next day and immediately deposited it into his POSB account number xxx-xxxxx-9 (\u201cthe Plaintiff\u2019s POSB account\u201d). Upon the cheque\u2019s clearance, he said he transferred S$800,000 therefrom to the Deceased\u2019s DBS account on 12 April 2008. However the evidence produced in court showed that the Deceased placed into four deposits in her DBS joint fixed deposit account number xxx-xxxxxx-17 (\u201cthe DBS joint fixed deposit account\u201d), which she held jointly with the Defendant, only S$700,000, comprising three deposits of S$200,000 each and one deposit of S$100,000. The Plaintiff deposed in his AEIC that he did not know what the Deceased did with the remaining S$100,000 from the S$800,000 he gave to her, and postulated that she might have placed it \u201cin another bank account, as she thought fit and proper\u201d.', '10\\u2003In March 2009, the Plaintiff purchased a HDB flat at Block 7, Ghim Moh Road #13-267, Singapore 270007 (\u201cthe Plaintiff\u2019s Flat\u201d) at a price of S$594,527.60; completion of the purchase was scheduled for July 2009.

The Deceased liquidated her various fixed deposits and transferred S$595,000 to the Plaintiff\u2019s POSB account.', '11\\u2003The Plaintiff deposed he would give to the Deceased sums of money amounting to either \u201c$10,000 or $20,000 or $30,000\u201d in cash to hold on trust and left it to her to decide what she would do with his money. Although he deposed he did not keep track of the various sums of money he passed to the Deceased over the years until her demise, the Plaintiff nevertheless claimed he could recall roughly how much he had passed to her over the years. He deposed 3', 'that as recent as two months before her demise, ie, December 2012, he \u201cremembered\u201d handing over to the Deceased cash of S$100,000.

He dwelt at length on all three accounts.', '15\\u2003By the Plaintiff\u2019s reckoning, the Deceased had at her death the following fixed deposits in the DBS joint fixed deposit account:', 'In his AEIC, 7', 'the Plaintiff said the total deposits were S$350,302.89 (inclusive of interest thrown away). At another paragraph of his AEIC, 8', 'the Plaintiff deposed that as at 31 December 2010, the Deceased held five deposits, of which the principal amount totalled S$349,998.00 which she held in trust for him. At yet another paragraph of his AEIC, 9', 'the Plaintiff asserted that the total entrusted funds with the Deceased should be S$550,302.89.', '16\\u2003The Plaintiff further claimed that as at the date of her demise, the POSB joint alternate account had a balance of S$140,183.80; he claimed he was entitled to 50% of this balance, amounting to S$70,091.90. As for the Deceased\u2019s POSB sole account, the balance was S$20,352.11 of which he claimed S$10,176.06.', '17\\u2003As for the Flat, the Plaintiff claimed that the manner of holding of the HDB lease by way of a tenancy in common with 99% held by the Deceased and 1% held by the Defendant showed that the Deceased did not intend that whatever she possessed or inherited from the Father, or the money she held on trust for him, should devolve to the Defendant.', '18\\u2003As the Deceased died intestate and the Plaintiff was often away from Singapore traveling to Cambodia and Vietnam, he renounced his right and entitlement to letters of administration of the Deceased\u2019s estate on 4 July 2013 with the result that the Defendant became the sole administrator of her estate.', '19\\u2003The Defendant applied to the State Courts on 4 July 2013 for letters of administration to the Deceased\u2019s estate. The grant of letters of administration was issued to the Defendant on 24 July 2013. The only asset declared for the Deceased\u2019s estate was the Flat with the value stated to be S$594,000.', '20\\u2003The Plaintiff deposed that on 21 December 2013, he transferred to the Defendant, in consideration of natural love and affection, his (the Plaintiff\u2019s) interest in the Flat (amounting to 49.5%) that devolved to him from the 99% interest the Deceased had in the Flat. The Plaintiff\u2019s version of events was that he had reached an oral agreement with the Defendant in or about December 2013. Under this agreement, the Plaintiff would transfer to the Defendant free of consideration the Plaintiff\u2019s share in the Flat. Subsequently, when the Plaintiff requested, the Defendant would sell the Flat and divide the net sale proceeds equally between them, in accordance with the Intestate Succession Act (Cap 146, 2013 Rev Ed).', '21\\u2003The Plaintiff alleged that the Defendant gave the following reasons for the transfer of the Plaintiff\u2019s interest in the Flat to him to be free of consideration:', '(a)\\u2003the Defendant needed the Flat as he was getting married (which he did on 10 November 2013);', '(b)\\u2003the Defendant did not have sufficient funds and\/or CPF monies to purchase a HDB flat;', '(c)\\u2003even if the Defendant had sufficient funds to purchase the Plaintiff\u2019s interest in the Flat, the Defendant would still have to pay stamp duty; and', '(d)\\u2003as the Flat was a family home, it would be better for the siblings to hold it in memory of their late parents for a while before it was sold in the open market.', 'The Plaintiff also deposed that the Flat could not be sold in the open market after the letters of administration of the Deceased\u2019s estate were extracted as the minimum occupation period (five years) had not yet been fulfilled.', '22\\u2003The Defendant on the other hand asserted that he paid the Plaintiff S$325,000 on or about 16 June 2013 to buy over the Plaintiff\u2019s 49.5% interest in the Flat. This sum comprised S$294,030, representing 49.5% of the estimated value of the Flat, and an extra S$30,970 which was for the Defendant to show his appreciation for the Plaintiff\u2019s financial support over the years. This was not the only aspect where the Defendant\u2019s account of events materially deviated from that of the Plaintiff\u2019s. In fact, in his AEIC, the Defendant\u2019s version of other major events was completely different from that given by the Plaintiff, as can be seen from the paragraphs set out below.', '23\\u2003According to the Defendant, when the Plaintiff started working in Russia in 1995, he would only return to Singapore every two or three years and would voluntarily give the Deceased about US$20,000 each time \u2013 the Deceased never asked the Plaintiff for this money. Sometime in 2000, the Plaintiff ran into some financial trouble in Russia. The Plaintiff asked the Father for help as he would not have been able to return to Singapore if he did not resolve his financial issues. The Father thus used about S$200,000 of his pension money (from working as a police officer for almost 30 years until 1998) to bail out the Plaintiff who subsequently returned to Singapore.', '24\\u2003Between 2001 and 2004, the Plaintiff conducted business in Russia remotely, from Singapore. Then in 2004, the Plaintiff ventured into business in Vietnam. He returned to Singapore occasionally and would hand to the Deceased sums of between S$5,000 and S$20,000 without being asked; the money was meant for housekeeping expenses.', '25\\u2003As for the purchase of the Flat, the Defendant deposed in his AEIC that the Deceased included his name as purchaser as she intended for him to inherit the property upon her demise. This was around the time the Father passed on, in 2010. The Plaintiff\u2019s Flat had already been purchased by then.', '26\\u2003When he, the Plaintiff and the Deceased visited the HDB\u2019s office in 2011 and they wanted to include the Defendant\u2019s name as co-owner, the Defendant was unaware of the differences between a joint tenancy and a tenancy in common. The HDB officer who was attending to them did not explain the differences either. The Plaintiff immediately told the HDB officer that 99% of the Flat would be held by the Deceased and 1% by the Defendant. Consequently, the Flat came to be held by the Deceased and the Defendant as tenants in common in the aforementioned ratio. The Defendant\u2019s usage of his CPF contributions of S$54,564.70 towards the purchase price of the Flat was disproportionate in comparison; his contribution amounted to about 16% (S$54,565.70 \u00f7 S$342,086.05) of the price of the Flat, whereas he owned only 1% of the Flat.', '27\\u2003After the passing of the Deceased and her funeral, the Defendant contacted the HDB to inquire about transferring the Deceased\u2019s share in the Flat to himself. To his surprise, a HDB officer, one Mr Seah Bin Seng (\u201cMr Seah\u201d), informed him that he would not inherit the Deceased\u2019s share as the lease was a tenancy in common. The Defendant was told to engage a lawyer to obtain either letters of administration (if there was no will) or a grant of probate (if there was a will) of the Deceased\u2019s estate. Mr Seah also informed the Defendant that the Flat would have to be divided equally with the Plaintiff in the event of intestacy.', '28\\u2003The Defendant appointed a lawyer to apply for letters of administration of the Deceased\u2019s estate. He deposed that in order to save costs, he agreed with the Plaintiff that only the Flat would be listed as an asset of the Deceased\u2019s estate and they would distribute the rest of her assets amongst themselves (gold and monies in the Deceased\u2019s POSB sole account), which they did. Further discussions the Defendant held with the Plaintiff resulted in the following oral agreement:', '(a)\\u2003the Defendant would be the sole administrator of the Deceased\u2019s estate; and', '(b)\\u2003the Plaintiff would renounce all his rights and title to letters of administration of the Deceased\u2019s estate.', '29\\u2003As regards the Flat, the Defendant told the Plaintiff that they could either:', '(a)\\u2003sell the Flat in the open market and divide the sale proceedings equally between them; or', '(b)\\u2003transfer the Flat to the Defendant as the Deceased intended in exchange for the Defendant\u2019s payment of S$325,000.', '(collectively \u201cthe Proposal\u201d)', '30\\u2003Before 17 June 2013, the Plaintiff reverted to the Defendant to accept para (b) of the Proposal but only on the condition that the Defendant was married. If the Defendant was not married by then, the Plaintiff required the Flat to be sold. The Defendant agreed as he and his girlfriend had already planned to get married in mid-2013 but postponed the wedding because of the demise of the Deceased. The Defendant then arrived at a second oral agreement with the Plaintiff in that regard. He paid the Plaintiff S$325,000 instead of half the declared value of the Deceased\u2019s share of the Flat, ie, 49.5% of the Flat\u2019s value amounting to S$294,030 (S$594,000 x 0.495) on 16 June 2013 because the Defendant wanted to compensate the Plaintiff for whatever monetary contributions the Plaintiff had made towards the Flat. The source of the Defendant\u2019s payment was \u201cfixed deposit bank accounts held jointly by [the Deceased] and [the Defendant]\u201d, which monies devolved to him upon her passing \u2013 it was unclear, at the portion of the Defendant\u2019s AEIC where he asserted this, whether this was a reference to the DBS joint fixed deposit account (see [9] above).', '31\\u2003On 6 August 2013, after the Defendant obtained the grant of letters of administration of the Deceased on 18 July 2013, he contacted Mr Seah of the HDB office to inquire as to the steps to be taken to transfer the Flat to his name. With Mr Seah\u2019s guidance, the Defendant applied for the transfer for which HDB granted its approval on 24 October 2013.', '32\\u2003On 21 December 2013, both siblings attended at HDB\u2019s office to sign the transfer documents. With Mr Seah\u2019s assistance, the Defendant drafted for the Plaintiff\u2019s signature the following document:', 'The Plaintiff raised no objections to signing either the transfer or the above document.', '33\\u2003Thereafter, the siblings pursued their respective careers while meeting regularly (they were close) until the Plaintiff began experiencing financial problems. The Defendant became aware of the Plaintiff\u2019s financial troubles sometime in February 2016. The Defendant understood from the Plaintiff that the Plaintiff\u2019s business in Cambodia was doing badly and his family was in financial difficulties. The Plaintiff said he wanted to venture into Myanmar for which he needed a sum of S$450,000 which he wanted to borrow from the Defendant. The Defendant told the Plaintiff he did not have such a huge sum to lend to him, whereupon the Plaintiff suggested that the Defendant sell the Flat. The Defendant reminded the Plaintiff that the Flat had been passed down to him (ie, the Defendant), and he had no intention of selling it. The Plaintiff then suggested that the Defendant mortgage the Flat.', '34\\u2003The Defendant felt obliged to assist the Plaintiff even though he was reluctant to mortgage the Flat. However, when he made inquiries, he found out that HDB flats cannot be mortgaged. He thus informed the Plaintiff that he could not lend him S$450,000. The Plaintiff then asked if the Defendant could lend him some money from the latter\u2019s savings. The Defendant\u2019s wife was then due to deliver their daughter in May 2016 and although he needed money for his wife\u2019s delivery and the baby\u2019s expenses, he nevertheless agreed to and did lend the Plaintiff S$71,300 in five tranches between March 2016 and January 2017.', '35\\u2003After the Defendant had transferred the first four tranches of money to the Plaintiff, which amounted to S$65,000, the Plaintiff again requested for money. Between October 2016 and January 2017, the Plaintiff informed the Defendant of his difficulties in doing business in Myanmar. He requested the Defendant to lend him more money so that he could send some money to his family. The Defendant refused as his savings were depleted and he had to ensure that his family\u2019s needs were covered.', '36\\u2003However, the Defendant still wanted to help the Plaintiff. He did so by selling the Deceased\u2019s jewellery on two occasions in January 2017 for S$6,250. He then transferred S$6,300 to the Plaintiff on 8 January 2017; that was the last of the five advances he made to the Plaintiff totalling S$71,300.', '37\\u2003The Plaintiff did not stop there. He sent the Defendant multiple WhatsApp messages between 3 May and 11 May 2017, which the Defendant exhibited in his AEIC. In these messages, the Plaintiff asked the Defendant to lend him even more money.', '38\\u2003Specifically, on 11 May 2017, the Plaintiff again raised the issue of selling the Flat. He informed the Defendant that he was in financial trouble and had incurred debts of S$450,000. That day, beyond asking the Defendant for more money, the Plaintiff in fact changed his tune: he claimed that he had a share in the Flat and he wanted to take back what was his. On that basis, he demanded that the Flat be sold. The Defendant rejected the Plaintiff\u2019s request, reminding him of the oral agreements that they had as set out at [28(b)] and [29(b)] above.', '39\\u2003As an alternative to selling the Flat, the Plaintiff proposed that the Defendant give to the Plaintiff\u2019s wife a monthly sum of S$2,500 for household expenses. The Defendant declined the proposal as he could not see how that arrangement would help to pay the Plaintiff\u2019s debts. Moreover, in May 2017, the Defendant\u2019s wife had stopped working and he was the sole breadwinner in his family. According to the Defendant, the Plaintiff then gave him an ultimatum: the Defendant was either to allow the Plaintiff to move into the Flat, or he was to find money amounting to half the current value of the Flat (as at May 2017) and give it to the Plaintiff. The Defendant did not reply to this ultimatum \u2013 neither option was acceptable to him.', '40\\u2003As a result, the Plaintiff became increasingly unhappy and continued to press the Defendant to sell the Flat. Things between the siblings came to a head on 22 May 2017 when the Plaintiff visited the Flat that night to try to resolve matters with the Defendant. The Plaintiff allegedly raised his voice and became increasingly agitated. The Defendant feared the Plaintiff may resort to violence. The Defendant thus ultimately relented that day and offered to sell the Flat to assist the Plaintiff with his debts. He agreed to try to sell the Flat by Chinese New Year 2018.', '41\\u2003The Defendant qualified his agreement to sell the Flat with two conditions. First, he insisted that he would decide when he would sell the Flat and it would certainly not be at a loss. By then, the Flat was worth about S$900,000, and selling it would have netted the Plaintiff around S$450,000 (half of the sale price, as per his demands), which would have enabled the Plaintiff to clear his debts. Second, the Defendant would sell the Flat only after he had found a flat for his family to move to. The Defendant\u2019s conditions were captured in his WhatsApp messages to the Plaintiff on 23 May 2017', '42\\u2003Unfortunately, the Defendant\u2019s agreement to sell the Flat made the Plaintiff even more eager to get it sold. He kept hounding the Defendant by sending WhatsApp messages, chasing him to make the sale. The Defendant was in no hurry to sell the Flat, and insisted on his conditions, as stated above, being met prior to any sale. The Plaintiff chased the Defendant on the following occasions:', '(a)\\u2003The Plaintiff sent a Whatsapp message to the Defendant on 10 June 2017 asking about whether there had been progress with the sale. The Defendant responded by saying he would sell no earlier than in 2018, and the Plaintiff should inform his creditor(s) who lent him money.', '(b)\\u2003That response earned the Defendant some respite from the Plaintiff who did not chase the Defendant again until 5 July 2017 via a WhatsApp message. The Defendant did not reply to this message.', '(c)\\u2003On 10 July, the Plaintiff asked again whether there was progress with the sale. The Defendant replied saying he had received offers below the market price of about S$980,000 at that point in time. He also had difficulty finding a suitably priced alternative flat for his family. In response, the Plaintiff accused the Defendant of \u201cdelay tactics\u201d.', '43\\u2003A further exchange of WhatsApp messages between the siblings from July 2017 to September 2017 did not resolve the impasse or differences between the siblings. During this period, the Defendant gradually got tired of the Plaintiff\u2019s antics \u2013 despite the Defendant\u2019s best efforts in searching for a suitable buyer for the Flat, and despite having done the above with his brother\u2019s interests in mind, the Plaintiff simply accused the Defendant of \u201cwanting to take his share of the Flat\u201d.', '44\\u2003On the night of 24 September 2017, the Plaintiff met the Defendant at the void deck of the Flat\u2019s block. The Defendant claimed the Plaintiff was insistent and demanded that he sell the Flat. When the Defendant refused, the Plaintiff became even more agitated. Despite being reminded by the Defendant that he had been transferred S$325,000 by the Defendant in exchange for his share of the Flat, the Plaintiff repeatedly insisted that half of the Flat still belonged to him. The parties did not reach an agreement that night. After the Plaintiff left, the Defendant received a WhatsApp message from him stating he would look for the Defendant the following day.', '45\\u2003The Plaintiff returned to the Flat on the night of 25 September 2017 but the Defendant refused to open the door to allow him entry. The Defendant\u2019s conduct infuriated the Plaintiff who shouted at the Defendant and caused a ruckus, prompting the Defendant to call the police. The Plaintiff only left the scene after the police arrived. The Defendant lodged a police report against the Plaintiff on 1 November 2017 10', 'as he felt threatened by the Plaintiff.', '46\\u2003After first sending two letters of demand to the Defendant dated 10 October 2017 and 20 October 2017 respectively (the first of which the Defendant ignored on his lawyers\u2019 advice), the Plaintiff issued the Writ of Summons on 25 November 2018.'"}

For present purposes, I will narrate the background events relating to the Shares, including GGAM\u2019s acquisition of the Shares, Bloomberry\u2019s injunction to restrain GGAM\u2019s disposal of the Shares, and the Tribunal\u2019s decision pertaining to the aforementioned injunction.', '12\\u2003The first plaintiff, BRHI, is Solaire\u2019s casino operator. The second plaintiff, Sureste, wholly owns BRHI and manages the hotel and non-gaming aspects of Solaire. Sureste is wholly owned by BRC, a listed company in the Philippines. BRC\u2019s chairman and chief executive officer is Mr Enrique K Razon, Jr (\u201cMr Razon\u201d) and its majority shareholder is PMHI. PMHI is wholly-owned by Mr Razon.', '13\\u2003The first defendant, GGAM Philippines, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Global Gaming Asset Management L.P., a firm that develops, invests, and advises hospitality companies, projects and casinos. Mr William P. Weidner (\u201cMr Weidner\u201d) is one of the firm\u2019s management principals. GGAM Philippines wholly owns GGAM Netherlands, the second defendant.', '14\\u2003On 16 March 2011, Mr Razon and Mr Weidner met to negotiate GGAM\u2019s role in designing, operating and managing Solaire. Eventually, on 9 September 2011, GGAM Philippines and Bloomberry signed the MSA, under which GGAM Philippines agreed to provide management and technical services for the development of Solaire and to supervise its operation for ten years (the \u201cPost-Opening Services\u201d). Clause 18.3 of the MSA granted GGAM the option to purchase up to 10% of the shares in BRC for US$15m plus 10% of the equity that Bloomberry had infused into the Solaire project. On 16 April 2012, GGAM Philippines signed the Equity Option Agreement (\u201cEOA\u201d) with BRC and Prime Metroline Transit Corp (\u201cPMTC\u201d, the predecessor in interest to PMHI), in accordance with cl 18.3 of the MSA. Under the EOA, PMTC granted GGAM Philippines an option to purchase 921,184,056 of PMTC\u2019s shares in BRC at PHP 1.67 per share (the \u201cOption\u201d). While the MSA provided the framework for the grant of the Option, the EOA granted the Option itself and set out the terms for exercising the Option. Clause 18.3 of the MSA states:', '15\\u2003BRC launched its initial public offering in 2012 with an issue price of PHP 7.50 per share. On 20 December 2012, GGAM Philippines exercised the Option and purchased PMTC\u2019s shares in BRC (ie, the Shares) for US$37.43m. On 8 March 2013, GGAM Philippines assigned to GGAM Netherlands, pursuant to cl 16.2 of the MSA, its rights under the MSA with respect to the Post-Opening Services.', '16\\u2003Solaire opened on 16 March 2013. However, shortly thereafter on 12 July 2013, Bloomberry sent a letter to GGAM listing GGAM\u2019s alleged breaches of contract and stating its intention to terminate the MSA. GGAM denied the allegations and the parties could not arrive at a settlement. On 12 September 2013, Bloomberry issued to GGAM a notice of termination. That same day, GGAM commenced the Arbitration against Bloomberry for, inter alia, Bloomberry\u2019s material breach and wrongful termination of the MSA.', '17\\u2003After its removal from Solaire\u2019s operations, GGAM Philippines sought to sell the Shares. By 16 January 2014, GGAM Philippines\u2019 agents had confirmed the sale of the Shares to over fifty institutional investors at a price of PHP 8.05 per share and the transaction was scheduled to take place on 21 January 2014. However, on 16 January 2014, the Philippine Stock Exchange (the \u201cPSE\u201d) suspended all trading in respect of BRC shares at BRC\u2019s request the day before. Then, on 17 January 2014, Bloomberry and PMHI filed with the RTC a petition seeking writs of preliminary injunction and attachment with regard to GGAM\u2019s sale of the Shares and requesting a temporary restraining order to preserve the status quo of the Shares. In this petition, Bloomberry and PMHI argued that the Shares were the subject of Bloomberry\u2019s Counterclaim in the Arbitration under the MSA. On 20 January 2014, the RTC granted a temporary order restraining the disposition of the Shares for a 20-day period. On 25 February 2014, the RTC issued a preliminary injunction order (the \u201cRTC Order\u201d) restraining GGAM from selling or transferring the Shares.', '18\\u2003On 27 February 2014, the RTC issued writs of preliminary injunction and attachment pursuant to the RTC Order. In response, on 11 March 2014, GGAM applied to the Philippine Court of Appeals to reverse the RTC Order and to cancel the preliminary injunction and preliminary attachment.', '19\\u2003The Tribunal was constituted on 28 March 2014. On 9 December 2014, the Tribunal issued the Interim Measures Order (the \u201cIM Order\u201d) to supersede the RTC Order and vacate the RTC\u2019s writs of preliminary injunction and attachment. The IM Order resolved that GGAM would be free to deal with the Shares, including the right to sell or dispose of the Shares. The Tribunal then directed the parties to \u201cbring this resolution before the Philippine Court of Appeals \u2026 and to the Regional Trial Court of Makati City, Philippines \u2026 and to assure its implementation\u201d. Following the issuance of the IM Order, Bloomberry renewed, on an annual basis, the preliminary injunction and preliminary attachment bonds ordered by the RTC pursuant to the RTC Order.', '20\\u2003Besides GGAM\u2019s petition to the Philippine Court of Appeals on 11 March 2014 for review on certiorari to reverse the RTC Order (see [18] above), on 15 December 2014, GGAM filed with the RTC a manifestation (a document notifying the Philippine court of an event or factual development) drawing attention to the IM Order and asking the court to implement it. Bloomberry responded on or around 19 December 2014 by filing a counter-manifestation before the RTC to block the implementation of the IM Order on the basis that GGAM failed to: (a) comply with the Philippines Rules of Court requiring every written motion to be set for hearing by the applicant (ie, GGAM); (b) provide verification of the manifestation; and (c) provide an authenticated or original copy of the IM Order.', '21\\u2003Also on 15 December 2014, GGAM filed a manifestation and motion in the Philippine Court of Appeals seeking to annul the RTC Order. GGAM requested the Philippine Court of Appeals to render a judgment confirming the IM Order and to remand the case to the RTC. In response, Bloomberry filed an opposition to this manifestation and motion with the Philippine Court of Appeals on 29 January 2015.', '22\\u2003On 29 May 2015, the Philippine Court of Appeals held that GGAM\u2019s 11 March 2014 appeal for review was \u201crendered moot and academic by the Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s Order\u201d (ie, the IM Order). The Court of Appeals further recognised that the RTC Order was no longer valid. In addition, the Philippine Court of Appeals held that the RTC was the proper venue for recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards under Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of 2004, Philippines Republic Act No. 9285 (the \u201cADR Act\u201d), section 3(f) (RE-2) and Rule 13 of the Special Rules of Court on Alternative Dispute Resolution (RL-3) (the \u201cSpecial ADR Rules\u201d), holding that:', '23\\u2003On 4 June 2015, Bloomberry filed a motion to the Philippine Court of Appeals seeking clarification on a statement in the resolution dated 29 May 2015 providing that \u201c[c]onsidering that the Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s Order dated December 9, 2014 not only superseded the assailed February 25, 2014 Order but also vacated and lifted the writs of preliminary injunction and attachment, then nothing is left for this Court to annul or act upon\u201d. Bloomberry took the view that the statement could be misinterpreted to mean that the lifting of the writs of preliminary injunction and attachment were ipso facto consequences of the IM Order. Subsequently, the Philippine Court of Appeals issued a second resolution on 27 November 2015 reiterating its resolution dated 29 May 2015. In the second resolution, the Philippine Court of Appeals stated:', 'On 17 May 2016, the Philippine Court of Appeals issued a judgment making final the 29 May 2015 resolution.', '24\\u2003On 20 September 2016, the Tribunal issued the Partial Award, deciding that Bloomberry\u2019s termination of the MSA constituted a breach of the MSA.

The Tribunal also reserved the matter of remedies such as damages to the remedies phase of the Arbitration. On 28 September 2016, following the issuance of the Partial Award, BRC disclosed to the PSE the following information:', '25\\u2003On 10 October 2016, GGAM\u2019s counsel in the Arbitration asked Bloomberry\u2019s counsel for their response to Deutsche Bank\u2019s question \u201c[d]oes Bloomberry have any objection to Deutsche Bank unfreezing the BRC shares held by GGAM and releasing the dividends paid by BRC on those shares?\u201d. Bloomberry\u2019s counsel replied on 11 October 2016:', '26\\u2003In February 2017, Bloomberry renewed the bonds ordered in February 2014 by the RTC in connection with the RTC Order.

That day, GGAM renewed its request that Bloomberry allow GGAM to sell the Shares.', '29\\u2003By a letter dated 10 April 2017, Bloomberry responded as follows:', '30\\u2003Throughout this period, Deutsche Bank (Bloomberry\u2019s custodian) declined to release the Shares because it did not receive written consent from Bloomberry.'"}
{"casename":"2020_SGHC_114","fact":"'4\\u2003The relevant background facts are found in the Statement of Facts which the Appellant had admitted to without qualification. The Appellant is a 72-year-old male Singaporean. APO Yii, the victim, is an Auxiliary Police Officer who was, at all material times, an Enforcement Officer authorised to carry out enforcement action on behalf of the National Environment Agency (\u201cNEA\u201d).', '5\\u2003On 22 October 2018, APO Yii and her partner, Auxiliary Police Officer Parthiban (\u201cAPO Parthiban\u201d) were on duty at Boon Lay MRT Station to enforce rules against littering and spitting. At around 10.10am, they noticed the Appellant spitting twice into the drain located at Exit C of Boon Lay MRT Station.', '6\\u2003APO Yii approached the Appellant and identified herself as an enforcement officer authorised by the NEA. She then informed the Appellant that he had committed an offence by spitting in a public area and requested for the Appellant\u2019s particulars. The Appellant refused to comply. Instead, he claimed that he was sick and in a rush, and started walking towards Jurong Point Shopping Centre. APO Yii followed the Appellant and asked him to stop, but he continued walking and ignored her instructions. At the entrance of Jurong Point Shopping Centre, APO Yii grabbed hold of the Appellant\u2019s right wrist to restrain him, but to no avail. The Appellant continued walking into Jurong Point Shopping Centre with APO Yii still holding on to his wrist.', '7\\u2003Inside Jurong Point Shopping Centre, APO Yii placed herself in front of the Appellant and blocked his path in order to confront him head-on. However, the Appellant suddenly grabbed APO Yii\u2019s right forearm with his left hand. When she shouted for him not to touch her, he let go of her arm and pushed her on her chest area above her breast. This caused APO Yii to stagger backwards. The Appellant then started to walk away quickly. Although APO Yii attempted to use both hands to restrain the Appellant, he struggled and manage to break free from her grip.', '8\\u2003The events described at [6] above were consistent with video footage from a body camera worn by APO Parthiban. The events described at [7] above were also consistent with video footage from a CCTV camera located inside Jurong Point Shopping Centre.', '9\\u2003APO Yii and APO Parthiban lost sight of the Appellant when he entered the bus interchange at Jurong Point Shopping Centre. Although the Appellant had originally intended to take a bus from the bus interchange, he was afraid of being spotted by APO Yii and APO Parthiban. As such, he exited the bus interchange, crossed the road, and walked through several HDB blocks to reach another bus stop. He then boarded a bus and headed to his workplace at Lim Chu Kang.', '10\\u2003In the proceedings below, the Prosecution sought a sentence of at least six weeks\u2019 imprisonment. The Defence urged the court to impose a fine of $4,000.', '11\\u2003The DJ held that the sentencing considerations in Public Prosecutor v Yeo Ek Boon Jeffrey and another matter [2018] 3 SLR 1080 (\u201cJeffrey Yeo\u201d) were applicable to the instant case even though Jeffrey Yeo involved the more serious offence of voluntarily causing hurt to a public servant under s 332 of the Penal Code. In the DJ\u2019s view, offences under ss 332 and 353 were similar in nature as they were both \u201caimed at protecting public servants in the execution of their duties\u201d. Where these public officers were exercising law enforcement or similar duties, a sentencing \u201cpremium\u201d was required to uphold and emphasise the authority of these officers, in order to enable them to carry out their onerous duties more effectively. Accordingly, the key sentencing consideration in the present case was that of deterrence.', '12\\u2003The DJ also placed emphasis on the case of Public Prosecutor v Chua Cheng Hong [2018] SGDC 158 (\u201cChua Cheng Hong\u201d), which coincidentally involved APO Yii as well. In Chua Cheng Hong, the accused was a 21year-old male Singaporean who was spotted flicking a cigarette butt onto the ground near the bicycle bay of Causeway Point Shopping Centre. When APO Yii attempted to block his path, the accused grabbed her arm and pushed her on the chest, causing her to lose her balance and move back a step. He fled but was subsequently identified and arrested by the police.', '13\\u2003The accused in Chua Cheng Hong was a first-time offender. He was sentenced to three weeks\u2019 imprisonment by the District Court, but this sentence was reduced to seven days\u2019 imprisonment on appeal. 1', 'In the DJ\u2019s view, it was clear from Jeffrey Yeo and Chua Cheng Hong that the \u201cstarting tariff\u201d for a s 353 offence was a short custodial term, and that fines would only be imposed in \u201cexceptional\u201d circumstances.', '14\\u2003The DJ declined to find that the present case lay at the low end of the low-harm, low-culpability spectrum. On the issue of harm, the DJ opined that the precedent cases tendered by the Defence should not be given much weight as they were decided pre-Jeffrey Yeo. In addition, although APO Yii did not suffer any visible injury, the nature of a s 353 offence meant that any hurt caused was bound to be slight or minimal. Otherwise, the Appellant could have been charged with a more serious offence under s 332 of the Penal Code.', '15\\u2003On the issue of culpability, the DJ found that the Defence\u2019s submissions that the Appellant had acted in a state of \u201cfear and panic\u201d were disingenuous, as it was clear that APO Yii had only restrained him because of his own refusal to submit to enforcement action. The fact that the Appellant had eventually pleaded guilty to the predicate offence was irrelevant and did not detract from the fact that he had successfully evaded enforcement action. Moreover, the DJ assessed the culpability of the Appellant in the instant case to be higher than that of the accused in Chua Cheng Hong. In particular, he noted that the Appellant had brushed past APO Yii several times when she stood in front of him to prevent him from leaving. He also observed that the incident began outside Jurong Point Shopping Centre, where members of the public could be seen milling around, and continued all the way into the mall. Accordingly, the DJ took the position that the sentence in the instant case should be higher than the sentence of seven days\u2019 imprisonment imposed by the High Court in Chua Cheng Hong. After considering the applicable mitigating and compassionate factors, he concluded that a sentence of four weeks\u2019 imprisonment was appropriate.'"}

He \nsaid he was going to have sex with her. Again, he said that he would deal with \nher first and then her mother. The complainant cried, begged and pleaded with \nhim not to do so. She feared for her life. While still holding the penknife to her \nneck, the accused told her to take out her clothes and to do as he told. He \nthreatened to cut her \u201cuntil [she] die[d]\u201d if she did not comply.\n(5) Fifth charge of aggravated outrage of modesty  \n21 The complainant complied with the accused\u2019s instructions, fearing for \nher life. She removed her T-shirt and her bra. Then, the accused asked her to \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v BSV[2020] SGHC 115\n8remove her shorts and panties. When she said that she did not want to do so, the \naccused pulled her shorts and panties off and threw them aside. He spread out \nher legs, moved himself in between them, and while holding the penknife in his \nhand, he licked her vagina. The complainant felt very disgusted, and tried to \nmake him stop. She cried and begged him, and moved her legs. He stopped after \na few more seconds. \n(6) Sixth charge of aggravated rape\n22 Then, the accused told the complainant that he was going to have sex \nwith her. Repeatedly, she begged him not to, saying she did not want to and that \nshe was his daughter. Ignoring her pleas, he forced his penis into her vagina, \nand moved in and out for a few seconds. He was still holding the penknife in \nhis hand. The complainant felt very disgusted. She also felt pain in her vagina. \nAfter a few seconds, he stopped.\n(7) Seventh charge of voluntarily causing hurt  \n23 Sitting beside the complainant, the accused said that \u201cfinally, he released \nafter seven years\u201d. He then said that he was going to kill or do something to the \ncomplainant if she were to report the rape. Still crying, she asked why he was \ndoing this to her. She said that she had been there for him all these years, \nincluding visiting him while he was in prison. As she pleaded with him, she \nraised her voice in the hope of attracting the attention of a neighbour. The \naccused saw through her plan, and asked her not to \u201cact smart\u201d. \n24 At this juncture, the complainant snatched the penknife from the \naccused, clasped it tightly between both hands and hid it below her pillow, \nunderneath the right side of her face. The accused then punched her head with \nboth his fists. One punch landed near the top of her head and the other landed \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v BSV[2020] SGHC 115\n9on her left ear. It was very painful, and the punch which landed on her head left \nher feeling \u201ca bit blur for a few seconds\u201d. \n(8) Eighth charge of voluntarily causing hurt \n25 After punching the complainant, the accused used one hand to strangle \nher neck. He held her so tightly that she had difficulties breathing. She was in \npain. \n(9) Ninth charge of aggravated rape   \n26 In order to breathe, the complainant kicked the accused. He fell to the \nfloor. Then, he stood up, and said, \u201cTrying to show your strength to me, is it?\u201d \nWhile he struggled to snatch the penknife back from her, the blade of the \npenknife fell out of the casing. The complainant also lost her grip of the casing. \nThe accused managed to snatch the casing, and placed the blade back into the \ncasing. Then, he told her, \u201c[D]on\u2019t try too much\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ll let you go if you \nlisten to me and do as I [say].\u201d He said he was going to have sex with her one \nmore time, and repeated that he would let her go if she did as he said. While \nholding the penknife to the right side of the complainant\u2019s neck, the accused \nagain spread out her legs and sat between them. He had sex with her again, \nmoving his penis in and out of her vagina for a few seconds \u2013 \u201cnot for very \nlong\u201d. Then, she felt \u201cwet at [her] vagina\u201d, and knew that he had \u201c[shot] out \n[his] sperm on \u2013 into me or what, I am not sure\u201d. The complainant felt very \ndisgusted. \nThe immediate aftermath \n27 After that, the accused again threatened the complainant, saying that he \nwas going to do something to her, and that he was then going to do something \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v BSV[2020] SGHC 115\n10to her mother. He was still holding onto the penknife. In fear, she begged and \ncried. She tried to calm him down by assuring him that she would not tell anyone \nwhat had happened or report the matter to the police. It would be shameful for \nher as well. She also made him promise the same. The complainant said that she \nwas trying to \u201cbrainwash\u201d and \u201cmanipulate\u201d him, so that he would not hurt or \nkill her. After a long time, she finally succeeded in calming him down. The \naccused then kept the penknife in the bag he used for work. This bag was where \nthe police recovered the penknife subsequently. \n28    The complainant then went to the toilet to wash up. She brought her \nclothes with her, but could not find her panties. She felt a \u201cburning sensation\u201d \nat the right side of her neck, but could not see clearly as she did not turn the \ntoilet light on. After she left the toilet, she started hyperventilating. After \nbreathing in and out of a plastic bag for a few seconds, she regained control of \nher breathing. At some point, she asked the accused whether there was any mark \non her neck, and he replied that he could see a red mark on her neck. When she \nasked the accused for her handphone, he said that it was with him. To calm \nherself down, and to think of what to do, she asked the accused for a cigarette. \nThe accused replied that he would go downstairs to buy cigarettes. \n29 As the accused opened the door, the complainant noticed that the gate \nwas fastened with a padlock. She thought this was peculiar. Usually, the gate \nwould not be padlocked. As for the padlock, it was one bought by the accused, \nand only the accused had the key to it. The accused told her to accompany him \nto the shop. The complainant said she would rather rest. At that point, she was \ncontemplating committing suicide by jumping down from the flat. The accused \ninsisted that she went downstairs with him, and she had no choice but to comply.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v BSV[2020] SGHC 115\n1130 From the bottom of the block of flats, they had to walk past a wet market \nto get to a 7-Eleven store. It took about five minutes. There, the accused entered \nthe store to buy a pack of cigarettes. Then, the complainant wanted a drink to \ncalm herself down, and asked the accused to buy alcohol for her. As it was about \n6.55am at that time, ie, before 7.00am, they could not purchase alcohol from the \n7-Eleven store. At her suggestion, they walked to a nearby coffee shop (the \n\u201cKoufu coffee shop\u201d) where they bought a bottle of Heineken beer. Then, they \nreturned to the flat. \n31 Back at the flat, again, the complainant asked the accused for her \nhandphone. It had been wedged in between the washing machine and the wall. \nHe retrieved it, and handed it to her. Then, the complainant called SS to pick \nher up, striving to speak in a \u201cnormal\u201d way. On the pretext of wanting to buy a \nbottle of Red Bull to drink with the Heineken beer, she was allowed to leave the \nflat. The complainant explained that she had used a \u201cnormal tone\u201d to speak to \nthe accused, and she reiterated that they should pretend that nothing had \nhappened.\n32 When SS picked her up in his car, she broke down, and told him that her \nfather had raped her. They went to pick up RR. She also briefly told RR what \nhad happened.\nThe police investigations   \n33 Eventually, later that day, accompanied by SS and RR, the complainant \nwent to the Nanyang Neighbourhood Police Centre to lodge a police report. \nThere, K met them. The police report alleging rape by the accused was lodged \nat 12.46pm. \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v BSV[2020] SGHC 115\n1234 On the same day, the accused was arrested. He was interviewed by the \ninvestigation officer, Vimala Raj s\/o Pathmanathan (\u201cIO Vimala\u201d), on both 27 \nand 28 March 2016. IO Vimala testified as to what the accused had said to him \n(and I shall discuss this at [ 129]). The accused also gave statements to the police \nwhich were introduced into evidence by the Defence (see [ 53] below). \nThe other supporting evidence    \n35  In addition to the complainant, SS, RR and K gave evidence, inter alia, \nregarding their interaction with the complainant on 27 March 2016. In the main, \nthey testified as to the complainant\u2019s state of distress, as well as seeing a red \nmark on her neck. SS and K testified that she told them that the accused had \nraped her.  \n36 Dr Qi Maili (\u201cDr Qi\u201d) from the KK Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Hospital \nexamined the complainant on 27 and 28 March 2016. She furnished a medical \nreport of the two medical examinations dated 12 April 2016. In it, she noted a \n\u201c3-4cm linear shaped laceration\u201d on the complainant\u2019s neck. The report also \ncontained an account given by the complainant of the offences.\n37 On 15 August 2016, Dr Zheng Zhimin (\u201cDr Zheng\u201d) from the Institute \nof Mental Health examined the complainant. In her report dated 15 August \n2016, she concluded that the complainant was suffering from post-traumatic \nstress disorder (\u201cPTSD\u201d) of moderate severity, with co-morbid depressive \nsymptoms. In a follow-up report dated 29 August 2019, Dr Zheng stated that \nthe complainant continued to suffer from PTSD. This was prepared after Dr \nZheng examined the complainant on 26 and 28 August 2019. \n38 I should add that the Prosecution also produced CCTV recordings. These \nwere obtained from the security cameras at various lift landings and within the \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v BSV[2020] SGHC 115\n13lifts of the block of flats in which the flat was situated, as well as the cameras \nof the Koufu coffee shop. The Prosecution also relied on records from the \nhandphone of the complainant. With that, I turn to the evidence for the Defence. \nThe Defence\u2019s case \nThe accused\u2019s evidence \n39 The accused elected to give evidence. In doing so, the accused claimed \nthat the sexual encounter on 27 March 2016 was consensual in nature. In fact, \nhe asserted that the complainant first seduced him on 25 March 2016. \nEvents on 25 March 2016\n40 On the night of 24 March 2016, the accused returned from work at about \n11.00pm, and he saw the complainant and RR drinking whisky. Then, the \ncomplainant accompanied RR home. When she returned to the flat, it was about \n1.30am. The accused and the complainant drank whisky together until about \n3.30am.\n41 After the accused took a shower, he went to bed. At about 4.00am, the \ncomplainant tapped the accused on his shoulder, pulled at his T-shirt and said \nthat she was \u201chorny\u201d. The accused told her that she should not say such words \nto him as he was her father. However, she replied, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, no one is here. \nCome and make me happy. I feel very horny.\u201d The complainant said she could \nnot control herself, and asked the accused to help her. Then, she grabbed his \nneck and kissed him. The accused said that he felt very lost at that point, and he \ndid not know why she was acting in that manner. He did not stop her because \nhe had never raised his hand to hit her before. He was very loving towards her, \nand would often just give in to her.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v BSV[2020] SGHC 115\n1442 Then, the complainant hugged him, put her hand into his shorts and \nmasturbated him. She then removed their clothes and pulled him onto the bed \non top of her. She got him to suck her breasts, and then pushed him down to lick \nher vagina. Then, she lifted him up by his head, and fellated him. He then \ngrabbed both her legs, and she took his penis and placed it inside her vagina. \nShe told him to push, and he had sex with her until he ejaculated. During this \ntime, he knew very well that he was making a mistake. \n43 After the accused wiped himself, the complainant said that she was not \nable to control herself, and told him to make her happy again. As he had already \nmade a mistake, he felt that if he did not do it again, she would be angry. Hence, \nhe agreed to do whatever she told him to do. Afterwards, she got on top of him, \nmasturbated him, and then placed his penis into her vagina again to have sex \nwith him, until he ejaculated for a second time. \n44 Subsequently, they agreed not to tell anybody about what had happened. \nThe accused then left for work, and they did not speak about the matter \nafterwards.\nEvents on 26 and 27 March 2016\n45 As for the events in the evening of 26 March 2016, the accused\u2019s account \nwas similar to that of the complainant. He spoke of how RR, the complainant \nand he drank together at the residents\u2019 corner near the flat. Then, they continued \ndrinking in the flat. The complainant returned home at about 1.00am on 27 \nMarch 2016 after sending RR home. They continued drinking. From this point, \nthe accused\u2019s account diverged from the complainant\u2019s version. \n46 The accused said that he showered and went to bed. Sometime later, the \ncomplainant tapped him on the shoulder and woke him up. She said she needed \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v BSV[2020] SGHC 115\n15to talk to him, and wanted him to buy beer for her. He said he would do so later \nin the morning. Then, she touched him on his face, and said, \u201cI am horny, do \nme again.\u201d He refused, and said it would be a mistake as he was her father. She \nsaid there was no one around, and asked him to make her happy one last time. \nShe then hugged him, kissed him, and touched his head, neck and body. \n47 After that, she put her hand into his shorts, and began to masturbate him. \nThen, she removed her clothes, and said that she would make him happy so that \nhe would buy beer for her. Then, she took off the accused\u2019s shorts. She fellated \nhim, got him to suck her breasts, then pushed him back down and got him to \nlick her vagina. She then pulled him up by his head until they were face-to-face. \nThen, she placed his penis into her vagina, and told him to push \u201cvery fast\u201d until \nhe ejaculated. After about ten to 15 minutes, he pulled himself out, and \nejaculated. \n48 The accused did as he was told because he thought that the complainant \nwould tell someone about their prior mistake if he did not comply. Out of fear \nand not knowing what to do, he complied and had sexual intercourse with her.  \nThen, the complainant said he did not do it properly. She wanted him to make \nher happy, and to do it one more time. The accused protested that he was feeling \nvery tired. However, the complainant insisted. She got on top of him, \nmasturbated him and had sex with him again until he ejaculated a second time. \nHer eyes were closed, and he did not know who she had in mind at the time. \nShe then said she would not tell anyone about the incident, and that this would \nbe the last time. He agreed not to tell anyone about the sexual encounter. \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v BSV[2020] SGHC 115\n16The aftermath \n49 As the complainant wanted a cigarette, they went down together to buy \ncigarettes. They also bought a bottle of beer from the Koufu coffee shop. Back \nin the flat, the complainant wanted to drink the beer with Red Bull. However, \nshe said the open can in the refrigerator was spoilt. She asked for $2, to go \ndownstairs to buy a can of Red Bull.  She also asked him for her handphone. In \nfact, the complainant had left the handphone charging by the sofa in the flat. \nHowever, she had forgotten about it. The accused located it, unplugged it and \ngave it back to her.\n50 After the complainant left the flat, the accused looked out of the kitchen \nwindow. She did not seem to be heading towards the market or the Koufu coffee \nshop. He called her at least 40 times. The calls went unanswered. He also called \nRR a few times during this period to ask if she knew the complainant\u2019s \nwhereabouts. Indeed, his handphone records showed him calling the \ncomplainant 20 times from 7.57am to 10.50am. In addition, as shown in his \nhandphone records, at 10.47am, he sent her a message saying, \u201cpls pls pls [the \ncomplainant\u2019s nickname] call me appa I am sorry\u201d. He explained that he had \nsent the message because he knew that both of them had made a mistake. He \nwanted to admit that he had made a mistake and to ask for forgiveness. He \nwanted her to call and talk to him.  \nOther matters \n51 The accused explained that for his work, the company issued him with \ntwo penknives to cut cartons. He did not use a penknife to threaten the \ncomplainant. As for the padlock, he admitted that he bought it. However, both \nhe and the complainant used the padlock; the complainant had a key for the \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v BSV[2020] SGHC 115\n17padlock. When the complainant returned home on 27 March 2016 after sending \nRR home, she used the padlock to secure the gate. \n52 The accused ventured quite a few reasons why the complainant, having \nbeen the one to initiate the sexual encounters with him, then turned around to \nframe him. I shall set out these allegations later (see [ 106]\u2013[ 123] below).\nStatements of the accused \n53 The accused first mentioned the two consensual sexual encounters in a \nstatement recorded from him pursuant to s 22 of the Criminal Procedure Code \n(Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe CPC\u201d) in Tamil on 31 March 2016 at 10.40am \n(\u201cthe 31 March 10.40am statement\u201d). In addition, two other statements recorded \npursuant to s 22 of the CPC dated 31 March 2016 at 7.14pm (\u201cthe 31 March \n7.14pm statement\u201d) and 4 April 2016 at 4.05pm (\u201cthe 4 April statement\u201d) \nrespectively were admitted into evidence. I shall refer to the contents of these \nstatements in due course. The Defence also adduced ten statements recorded \nfrom the accused pursuant to s 23 of the CPC, ie, cautioned statements, into \nevidence.       \nThe supporting evidence \n54 Dr Munidasa Winslow (\u201cDr Winslow\u201d) of Winslow Clinic also gave \nevidence for the Defence. In his report dated 19 November 2019, Dr Winslow \nstated that it was \u201cpossible\u201d that the drinking of whisky had impaired the \ncomplainant\u2019s impulse control, as well as lowered her inhibitions at the time of \nthe sexual encounter on 27 March 2016. Dr Winslow also commented on some \nother matters which I shall deal with below. Dr Winslow did not interview the \naccused or the complainant.    \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v BSV[2020] SGHC 115\n18"}

{"casename":"2020_SGHC_137","fact":"facts behind this are murky at this point. The 1st defendant explained in his \naffidavit that Peter Ong paid about one-third of the Ferrari\u2019s purchase price, \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nChan Pik Sun v Wan Hoe Keet[2020] SGHC 137 \n4with the 2nd defendant and him paying for the remainder. He also explained that \nPeter Ong gave them the full purchase price of the yacht in cash, and they made \nthe payment using the 4th defendant\u2019s bank account. The exact transactions may \nhave to be explored at trial \u2014 if they are proved to be materially relevant.\n12 The relevant matter at this moment is that the schemes by \u201cSureWin4U\u201d \nenvisage that investors bring other investors to join in the merriment of \nwonderful investments with high returns.\n13 The investors are given ranking statuses judged by the number of \ninvestors they bring to the scheme. Hence, the 1st and 2nd defendants who had \nbeen in the scheme for a year or two, were given the accolade \u201cseven-star \nagents\u201d. The plaintiff herself, in a much shorter time, had risen to achieve the \naward of \u201cfive-star agent\u201d and was told by Peter Ong that she was on the verge \nof becoming a \u201cseven-star agent\u201d.\n14 Finally, according to the plaintiff,  investments in and through \n\u201cSureWin4U\u201d were made by purchasing \u201cying-bi\u201d at the fixed exchange rates \nlisted on the \u201cSureWin4U\u201d website. If an investor wishes to purchase \u201cYing \nBi\u201d, she pays S$1.38 for one \u201cying-bi\u201d. If she is selling \u201cying-bi\u201d, the going rate \nis S$1.20 for one \u201cying-bi\u201d. What is this \u201cying-bi\u201d? The \u201cying-bi\u201d is the fantasy \ncurrency created by Peter Ong. He is the central bank of the \u201cying-bi\u201d.\n15 Taiwanese news media reported on 10 September 2014 that Taiwanese \npolice had uncovered a fraudulent scheme known as \u201cSureWin4U\u201d. A man \nknown as Chen Jin Teng, who was allegedly the scheme\u2019s representative in \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nChan Pik Sun v Wan Hoe Keet[2020] SGHC 137 \n5Taiwan, was arrested. The revelation of this news created panic among the \ninvestors.\n16 The plaintiff sought the 1st and 2nd defendants to help her recover her \ninvestments. The 1st and 2nd defendants themselves, according to the \n1st defendant\u2019s affidavit, were in a state of shock. They went to consult lawyers, \nand then held a meeting among the investors.\n17 The investors, including the plaintiff, but not the 1st and 2nd defendants, \nthen went to the casinos themselves in an attempt to recover their losses by using \nthe \u201c100% success rate method\u201d that they were taught at Peter Ong\u2019s seminars. \nAfter losing more money at the casinos, the investors realised that they did not \ncomprehend how the method worked in the first place.\n18 Hence, the plaintiff brought this action to recover her losses from the \ndefendants. She hopes, by this present application, to stop the 1st and 2nd \ndefendants from dissipating their assets.\n19 A Mareva injunction may be granted if the court is satisfied that there is \ncredible evidence that a defendant is attempting to dissipate her assets such that \nthere will be little or nothing for a successful plaintiff to recover should she win \nthe suit. Until the trial is over, it will not be certain whether the plaintiff will \nsucceed, and therefore, a Mareva injunction is not to be used to insure the \nplaintiff. At this stage of the action, the plaintiff and defendants stand on equally \nuncertain terms.\n20 The plaintiff here claims that the 1st and 2nd defendants were dissipating \ntheir assets by their attempt to sell their Property. Mr Cavinder Bull SC, counsel \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nChan Pik Sun v Wan Hoe Keet[2020] SGHC 137 \n6for the 1st and 2nd defendants, pointed out that the 1st and 2nd defendants had \nlisted their Property for sale before the \u201cSureWin4U\u201d scam was discovered. \nTheir son had completed secondary school and they no longer need to stay near \nthe school. More importantly, although the Property was put on sale more than \na year ago, it has not been sold because there have been no buyers willing to \npay the asking price. Even if sold, the mere conversion of an asset to another \nform in itself is not sufficient proof of dissipation.\n21 That brings us to the second point that Mr Bull SC raised. He submitted \ncorrectly, that a plaintiff seeking a Mareva injunction must act in good time. \nThis application was made on 24 March 2020 after the action was filed on \n15 August 2018. When both sides have a good arguable case, evidence of \ndissipation and prompt action become more significant factors.\n22 In response, counsel for the plaintiff, Mr Lok Vi Ming SC, submitted \nthat he had been busy in getting the injunction against his acting for the plaintiff \ndischarged (see Originating Summons No 13 of 2019). I am not convinced that \nthis was a justifiable reason for not acting more swiftly. The plaintiff could have \nbeen advised to apply through another solicitor as this was a stand-alone \napplication. Secondly, Originating Summons No 13 of 2019 was only a brief \ninterlude after the writ was filed. Mr Lok SC, surely cannot be saying that he \nplaced the priority of keeping his brief over that of advancing the plaintiff\u2019s \nmore pressing need to secure a Mareva injunction.\n23 More importantly, the 1st and 2nd defendants\u2019 conduct did not indicate \nthat they had been rushing to dissipate their assets. People who are rushing to \ndissipate their assets do not dally in the way they did.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nChan Pik Sun v Wan Hoe Keet[2020] SGHC 137 \n724 Finally, from the plaintiff\u2019s perspective, the 1st and 2nd defendants were \nequal participants with Peter Ong in the \u201cSureWin4U\u201d scheme to defraud her of \nher money. From the 1st and 2nd defendants\u2019 perspective, they were no less \nvictims of the scam than the plaintiff. For them, the trial may perhaps determine \nwhich party had been the more foolish, and whether the lesser one has a cause \nof action against the other. The trial will probably reveal even more facts and \nfacets of this case, but I am presently not satisfied that there are sufficient \ngrounds to grant the plaintiff a Mareva injunction. \n25 The application was heard by me on 18 June 2020 and judgment was \nreserved with leave to the 1st defendant to file an affidavit by 23 June 2020. \nMr Lok SC later wrote to the registrar, asking for leave to file an affidavit to \nraise further issues in respect of the ownership of the yacht (mentioned in [ 11] \nabove), and objecting to paragraph 10 of the 1st defendant\u2019s affidavit filed on \n22 June 2020.  It had transpired that the 1st and 2nd defendants had sold the yacht, \nand paragraph 10 stated what they did with the sale proceeds. They apparently \npaid $190,000 towards the mortgage for their Property, and $415,836 to their \nprevious solicitors. I had asked for this information since, as I mentioned, the \nmere conversion of an asset to another form in itself does not show dissipation, \nand what is important is whether the converted asset is still in the defendants\u2019 \nhands. What Mr Lok SC wanted, however, was not to respond to paragraph 10, \nbut merely to \u201crecord his objection\u2026as this was not within the scope of [my] \ndirections\u201d. As I have already indicated, this is incorrect. As far as the \nownership of the yacht is concerned, I do not think the issue is sufficiently \nimportant to justify potentially endless replies from both parties; what is \nimportant, and already in evidence, is what the 1st and 2nd defendants did with \nthe proceeds from the sale of the yacht. I do not need further affidavits about \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nChan Pik Sun v Wan Hoe Keet[2020] SGHC 137 \n8the yacht and its history at this stage, bearing in mind that this is an application \nfor a Mareva injunction.\n26 For the reasons above, I am of the view that the injunction sought should \nbe refused and this application is therefore dismissed with costs reserved.\n     - Sgd -\nChoo Han Teck\nJudge\nLok Vi Ming SC, Lee Sien Liang Joseph, Muk Chen Yeen Jonathan \nand Tan Yan Ting Tanya (LVM Law Chambers LLC) for the \nplaintiff;\nCavinder Bull SC (instructed counsel), Lin Shumin and Ho Wei Wen \nDaryl (Drew & Napier LLC) for the first and second defendants.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)"}

Poh stated that the key features of the Bunker Trading System are as follows. 5', 'First, an open position trading limit for Vermont was imposed, at a maximum of 10,000 metric tonnes of bunker fuel (\u201cthe Trading Limit\u201d). Second, Vermont\u2019s trading operations would be financed solely by trade receivable financing from banks. In this regard, the Guangxin Group would assist Vermont in obtaining the necessary banking facilities to finance its operations.', '11\\u2003The day-to-day running of Vermont was left to the Majority Directors. Poh claimed that the Applicants were content to leave the daily operations of Vermont to the Majority Directors because Vermont\u2019s business risk would be regulated by the Bunker Trading System. Zhao was one of the initial Majority Directors (nominated by the Guangxin Group through VGL) and served as both the executive director and general manager of Vermont, effectively making all its management and trading decisions. 6', '12\\u2003In 2010, Zhao informed Koh and Poh that the Guangxin Group had sourced for trade receivable financial facilities from various banks. However, the banks required the Guangxin Group to provide parent company guarantees to secure Vermont\u2019s obligations. Poh and Koh then executed counter-guarantees in favour of Goldsland and Sin Hua in 2010 and 2014 (\u201cthe Counter-Guarantees\u201d), under which they would each be responsible for a 24.5% share of any call on the parent company guarantees by the banks. 7', '13\\u2003In 2011, it was discovered that Zhao had traded wrongfully in breach of the agreed Trading Limit, resulting in massive losses to Vermont. Poh claimed that he and Koh were not given much information on the internal investigations on Zhao pertaining to that matter. 8', '14\\u2003A meeting was held in May 2011 in Hong Kong (\u201c2011 HK Meeting\u201d) at which Poh and Koh were informed that the estimated loss suffered by Vermont was more than US$10 million. That meeting was also attended by the Respondents and the Guangxin Group. 9', 'According to Koh, he emphasised at that meeting that, as Zhao was the Guangxin Group\u2019s representative on Vermont\u2019s board of directors, the Guangxin Group should bear full responsibility for Zhao\u2019s wrongful trading. Further, the breach of the Trading Limit and resulting losses were hidden from Poh and Koh. Hence, they and Vermont should not be held responsible for Zhao\u2019s actions. Lu, then a director of Goldsland, Sin Hua and the Respondents, allegedly agreed that the Guangxin Group would be responsible for the consequences of Zhao\u2019s trading and not the minority shareholders and Vermont. 10', 'Some two months later, Poh claimed that he and Koh travelled to Guangzhou for another meeting attended by representatives of the Guangxin Group, and reiterated their position as stated at the 2011 HK Meeting. Poh claimed that, thereafter, an agreement was reached among Vermont, the Guangxin Group, Poh and Koh, that neither Vermont nor its minority shareholders (ie, Poh and Koh) would be responsible for the consequences of Zhao\u2019s trading, and that these consequences would be the Guangxin Group\u2019s sole responsibility (\u201cGuangxin Agreement\u201d). 11', '15\\u2003On 29 June 2011, Zhao was removed as a director by the Guangxin Group for his wrongful trading, and replaced by Yang Sanhua (\u201cYang\u201d), who ran the day-to-day operations of Vermont. 12', '16\\u2003Li, a director of VGL, claimed that, around June 2010, Vermont ran into cash flow difficulties and requested for financial assistance from its shareholders, but Poh and Koh were not agreeable to provide further funding. 13', 'A Request for Instructions on Borrowing Working Capital dated 14 June 2010 (\u201cJune 2010 Request to Borrow Capital\u201d) was then issued by the board of directors to Goldsland, which stated that: 14', '(a) as at 13 June 2010, Vermont had borrowed US$8.19 million (and a standby letter of credit of US$4.5 million) and US$4.6 million (and a credit line of US$11 million granted by the Bank of Communications) from Goldsland and VGL; (b) it was still difficult for the current borrowing to meet the funding needs for Vermont\u2019s existing operations and the gap was about US$2.27 million; and (c) Vermont hoped that Goldsland would be able to lend it another US$3.6 million.', '17\\u2003Li stated that sometime around late 2011, the Guangxin Group agreed to lend monies to Vermont as follows (\u201cthe Loan Agreement\u201d): 15', '(a) including the sums that the Guangxin Group had extended to Vermont, the former agreed to extend a credit facility of up to US$37 million to the latter as working capital (\u201cthe Credit Facility\u201d); (b) upon Vermont\u2019s request, VGL and\/or the Guangxin Group would make payments on Vermont\u2019s behalf to third parties, with such payments to be regarded as a draw down on the Credit Facility; and (c) Vermont shall pay interest to the Guangxin Group on the sums extended. This Loan Agreement was apparently recorded in the minutes of a board meeting on 2 December 2011 (\u201c2 Dec 2011 Meeting\u201d), which Poh and Koh attended. 16', '18\\u2003Li alleged that pursuant to the Loan Agreement, between 2011 and 2016: 17', '(a) Vermont requested for drawdowns of the Credit Facility by requesting VGL and\/or the Guangxin Group (through Goldsland and\/or Sin Hua) to make payments to third parties on its behalf, or requesting for cash loans from VGL and\/or the Guangxin Group; (b) Vermont requested, and the Guangxin Group granted, further increases to the limits on the Credit Facility; and (c) Vermont made partial repayments of the sums due to VGL and\/or the Guangxin Group. The drawdowns of the Credit Facility and Loan Agreement are the subject of Suits 260 and 261, as Li claimed that the debts in these Suits are owed by Vermont \u201cpursuant to the Credit Facility and Loan Agreement\u201d. 18', '19\\u2003Around 2016, the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau of Singapore (\u201cCPIB\u201d) commenced investigations into Vermont\u2019s trading activities. At that time, Vermont was managed by Yang. Around November 2017, Vermont, the Applicants, Lee Kok Leong (Vermont\u2019s former bunker manager), Yang, and Mac Xing Tao (\u201cMac\u201d) (Vermont\u2019s then-financial controller) were charged, inter alia, for cheating and criminal breach of trust. The Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore then revoked Vermont\u2019s bunker supply licence (\u201cMPA Licence\u201d) with effect from 27 April 2016. 19', 'The licence allowed Vermont to trade directly with ship-owners.', '20\\u2003Despite the revocation of the MPA Licence, Poh claimed that Vermont could still operate as it had vessels it could charter. 20', 'However, Yang apparently decided to unilaterally close all of Vermont\u2019s open trade positions at a significant loss, and Poh and Koh only found out about this on 29 June 2016 at a meeting in Hong Kong. Poh claimed that Yang\u2019s actions were a breach of his duties to act in Vermont\u2019s best interest and prevented Vermont from using its revenue stream to sustain its operations and reduce any debt owed to third parties. In early July 2016, Yang and Mac disappeared. Around September or October 2016, Yang was removed as a director of Vermont and replaced by Zou Bin, who was the director and chief executive of Goldsland. Poh claimed that Zou Bin refused to engage the Applicants on continuing Vermont\u2019s business. 21', '21\\u2003On 12 March 2018, Goldsland commenced Suit 260 against Vermont to recover a loan of US$22,443,995.61, and Sin Hua commenced Suit 261 against Vermont to recover a loan of US$18,360,759.33, on the basis that they had provided financial assistance to Vermont for bunkering transactions between 2010 and 2016. They alleged that Vermont requested them to transfer the monies directly to Vermont\u2019s suppliers, which they did. Goldsland and Sin Hua obtained the Default Judgments against Vermont on 23 March 2018.', '22\\u2003Poh claimed that the Majority Directors did not reach out to the Applicants to discuss how Vermont should deal with Suits 260 and 261, and did not engage external legal counsel to provide advice on the appropriate course of action. 22', 'In fact, Vermont did not enter an appearance or contest the Suits.', '23\\u2003Separately, on 22 January 2018, Goldsland commenced proceedings in Hong Kong against the Applicants for US$9,433,013.27 each (\u201cHK Proceedings\u201d). 23', 'Goldsland claimed that, from 21 April 2010 to 10 December 2013, it made payments of US$34,002,094.98 on Vermont\u2019s behalf to suppliers; and, on 20 June 2016, it made payments of US$4,500,000 on Vermont\u2019s behalf to the Bank of China. The Applicants signed the Counter-Guarantees in respect of these loans and were thus personally liable for 24.5% of the loan amounts each. On 27 April 2018, Goldsland obtained the leave of the Hong Kong High Court to serve the writ and statement of claim on the Applicants in Singapore. Li stated that Goldsland served the writ and statement of claim on Koh on or around 4 July 2018, and Poh was served sometime thereafter. On 21 September 2018, Goldsland began efforts to enforce the Default Judgments by obtaining an order for the examination of judgment debtor against the Applicants. 24', '24\\u2003On 29 April 2019, the Applicants commenced OS 166. On 19 July 2019, Vermont applied (through Zou Bin, a Majority Director) to wind itself up.'"}
{"casename":"2020_SGHC_14","fact":"'4\\u2003 The Victim\u2019s biological parents were separated when she was an infant. The Victim\u2019s mother then re-married the accused in 2008, when the Victim was about two years of age. The accused and the Victim\u2019s mother have four children arising out of their marriage. Together with the Victim, all seven members of the family resided in a one-room Housing and Development Board flat somewhere in the central region of Singapore (\u201cthe flat\u201d). The entire family usually slept together in the living room of the flat.', '5\\u2003 The Victim and the accused had a good relationship prior to the offences. She treated him as her real father and was closer to the accused than to her own biological father. This changed abruptly when the accused started to sexually abuse the Victim in 2012.', '6\\u2003The Victim was only six years of age at the time of the first incident, which occurred sometime in 2012, when she had just started her Primary School education. She was sleeping on a mattress in the living room of the flat when, at about 5 a.m., the accused woke her up and rubbed her vagina over her clothes. The accused then told the Victim to keep silent about the incident. This forms the subject of the 1st charge.', '7\\u2003 The accused did not stop after the first incident and instead his sexual abuse of the Victim started escalating the following year. Sometime between January and July 2013, while the Victim was asleep, the accused turned her over and removed her pants and panties. He then removed his shorts before penetrating the Victim\u2019s anus with his penis. This caused the Victim to cry as she felt a tearing pain at her anus, but the accused covered her mouth and slapped her. He then put his finger to his lips, telling the Victim to be quiet. This forms the subject of the 2nd charge.', '8\\u2003The accused subsequently performed or attempted to perform these acts of penile-anal penetration on five other occasions from 2014 to 2018, one time each year. These acts form the subject of the 4th, 6th, 12th, 14th and 15th charges.', '9\\u2003The sexual abuse of the Victim also extended to acts of fellatio, beginning sometime in 2014. On the first instance, the accused summoned the Victim to his bedroom, closed the door and began groping the Victim\u2019s body. She protested and told the accused to stop, to which he retorted that her body was his and he could touch her anywhere he wanted. The accused then stood in front of the Victim and removed his underwear, exposing his penis to her. He then pulled her head towards his penis, instructing her to open her mouth and told her to \u201csuck\u201d. Despite the Victim\u2019s unwillingness, the accused proceeded to insert his penis into her mouth, held on to her head and thrusted his penis in and out of her mouth before ejaculating in it. This forms the subject of the 3rd charge.', '10\\u2003Following the acts forming the 3rd charge, the accused warned the Victim to keep it a secret, at the same time promising that he would cease all such acts. Despite this, the accused persisted in his abuse of the Victim, performing these acts of penile-oral penetration on three other occasions from 2015 to 2017, one time each year. These acts form the subject of the 8th, 11th and 13th charges.', '11\\u2003 The accused also raped the Victim on two occasions (forming the subject of the 5th and 7th charges) in 2014 and 2015. He also outraged her modesty by touching the Victim\u2019s vagina over her clothes in 2016 (9th charge). In the same year he again outraged her modesty by touching her buttocks skin-on-skin (10th charge).', '12\\u2003The accused did not use a condom when he raped the Victim and also when he used his penis to penetrate the Victim\u2019s anus. For fellatio, the accused would ejaculate into the Victim\u2019s mouth and on other instances, he would ejaculate onto her stomach or her back.', '13\\u2003This state of affairs continued till 17 January 2018. On that day when the Victim was getting ready for school, the accused summoned her to the bedroom of the flat. He made her lie on the mattress with her legs on the floor. He removed her skirt and panties and attempted to penetrate her anus with his penis. The Victim prevented any penetration by moving her body. The accused gave up after a while and masturbated, eventually ejaculating on her back.', '14\\u2003This was the final straw for the Victim. On her way to school, the Victim sent her maternal aunt a text message stating: \u201cI need your help,.. my daddy went crazy today morning he forced me to have \u2018sex\u2019 with him\u2026he then opened my skirt and touched my butt\u201d. The aunt then called the Victim, who confided in her. The Victim was also observed by a teacher to be crying in despair and she was brought to a school counsellor. The matter was reported to the Police on the same day.', '15\\u2003Subsequently, the Victim underwent a medical examination at the KK Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Hospital. The doctor who examined the Victim noted that there were old hymenal tears at 3 o\u2019clock, 9 o\u2019clock and 12 o\u2019clock positions.', '16\\u2003The Victim also underwent a psychiatric assessment at the Child Guidance Clinic on 26 April 2018. Dr Parvathy Pathy\u2019s report disclosed that the Victim was \u201cvery scared\u201d of the accused, and she \u201cfeels angry, ashamed and embarrassed that she has lost her virginity at a young age\u201d.', '17\\u2003In her Victim Impact Statement, the Victim said that the abuse by the accused caused her to suffer from insecurity and a constant worry of judgment from others for the acts that had been done to her. She also disclosed that she still suffers flashbacks of the incidents. She is also afraid of the accused\u2019s reprisal and she finds it difficult to trust male individuals.', '18\\u2003In 2014 the accused raped the Victim for the first time. At that time she was very young, between eight and nine years of age. She was sleeping in the living room of the flat when the accused woke her up and told her that he wanted to \u201cdo the front hole\u201d. The Victim complied as she did not want to anger him. He then proceeded to remove her pants and panties and penetrated her vagina with his penis. This caused exceptional pain to the Victim, far beyond the previous instances of penile-anal penetration. Yet, out of fear of the accused, the Victim did not dare to respond by pushing him away. When she responded to the pain by shouting softly, the accused scolded her and told her to shut up. The accused continued penetrating the Victim\u2019s vagina for about a minute, while she continued crying silently.', '19\\u2003 This was the third instance of penile-oral penetration, which occurred sometime in the morning of December 2016, when the Victim was 11 years old. The accused called the Victim to the bedroom and instructed her to remove her clothes, which she reluctantly complied with. The accused then instructed her to suck his penis, but this time, she refused to do so. Despite the refusal, the accused proceeded to force the Victim\u2019s head towards his penis and penetrated it into her mouth for about 15 seconds, before ejaculating in it.', '20\\u2003 Immediately after committing the act of fellatio that forms the 11th charge, the accused informed the Victim that he wanted to penetrate her anus. She resisted and made known to the accused that it would be painful for her. However, he informed her that it would only be for a short while and instructed the Victim to lie with her hands lifting her upper body and knees propped on the mattress. He then used his penis to penetrate her anus and he only stopped when his penis went flaccid.'"}
{"casename":"2020_SGHC_140","fact":"'2\\u2003I highlight here the key facts relevant to the issue of costs. The plaintiff (\u201cE6\u201d), incorporated in the United Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d), designs, develops, and manufactures synthetic diamond products. E6 owns Singapore Patent No 115872 (\u201cSG 872\u201d) and Singapore Patent No 110508 (\u201cSG 508\u201d). The first is a patent for the manufacture of synthetic diamond using chemical vapour deposition (\u201cCVD\u201d); the second is a patent to convert a coloured single crystal CVD diamond to another colour under suitable heat treatment conditions, a process referred to as annealing. The defendant (\u201cIIa\u201d), a Singapore company, deals in the manufacture of CVD diamond products and the colour treatment of diamonds. E6 contended that three Samples (referred to as \u201cSample 2\u201d, \u201cSample 3\u201d, and \u201cSample 4\u201d respectively, and collectively as the \u201cSamples\u201d) that originated from IIa infringed SG 872. Samples 2 and 4 were CVD diamond optical applications, while Sample 3 was a pink CVD diamond gemstone, which E6 contended infringed SG 508 as well. IIa\u2019s response was a threefold denial: first, it denied that the Samples originated from them; second, even if they did, the Samples were manufactured using IIa\u2019s confidential process; and third, it counterclaimed that SG 872 and SG 508 were invalid.', '3\\u2003In the Judgment, I found that IIa was responsible for manufacturing all three Samples. On the counterclaim for revocation, I found that SG 872 was valid while SG 508 was not. IIa\u2019s confidential process did not withstand scrutiny. E6 was able to show that IIa had used SG 872 to manufacture the Samples, while the result on SG 508 was not conclusive in view of my finding as to its anticipation by prior art. Therefore, infringement was made out on SG 872 while the invalidity of SG 508 functioned as a defence to any infringement of SG 508.'"}

{"casename":"2020_SGHC_144","fact":"'3\\u2003The facts are drawn from the joint statement of facts which Wong and Chia admitted to without qualification (the \u201cJSOF\u201d).', '4\\u2003Wong was an employee of CPG Facilities Management Pte Ltd (\u201cCPG\u201d), the managing agent of Ang Mo Kio Town Council (\u201cAMKTC\u201d). Pursuant to his employment, Wong was appointed as the General Manager of AMKTC in November 2013 and held a concurrent appointment as Secretary of AMKTC until November 2016. In these capacities, Wong was in charge of AMKTC\u2019s operations and his duties included overseeing and providing inputs on the selection of contractors for the execution of works. Wong was privy to important contract information and attended meetings at which contractors were recommended and selected.', '5\\u2003Chia was a shareholder and the directing mind and will of two companies, 19-ANC Enterprise Pte Ltd (\u201c19-ANC\u201d) and 19-NS2 Enterprise Pte Ltd (\u201c19-NS2\u201d) (collectively, \u201cthe Companies\u201d). Chia held 50% of the shares in 19-ANC and 40% of the shares in 19-NS2. 19-ANC was in the business of, among other things, tendering for construction-related works at various Town Councils, while 19-NS2 acted mainly as a subcontractor to 19-ANC.', '6\\u2003Wong and Chia were introduced to each other in February 2015 by either Mr Tay Eng Chuan (\u201cTay\u201d) or Ms Alisa Yip (\u201cYip\u201d), both of whom were shareholders in 19-NS2.', '7\\u2003Between 2014 and 2016, Wong received various types of gratification as inducement for advancing the business interests of the Companies in their business dealings with AMKTC. Wong and Chia each pleaded guilty to three charges under s 6 read with s 7 of the PCA corresponding to three types of gratification given to Wong, which were all procured or provided by Chia. The first type consisted of a discount given to Wong in relation to the purchase of a motor car from 19-ANC (\u201cthe Discount Charge\u201d). The second type consisted of remittances made to Wong\u2019s mistress in China (\u201cthe Remittance Charge\u201d). The third type consisted of entertainment expenses incurred at various establishments (\u201cthe Entertainment Charge\u201d).', '8\\u2003Before considering the proceeded charges in greater detail, it is helpful to digress briefly here in order to set out the processes in place at AMKTC to decide on the award of contracts. This will help explain precisely how Wong was able to, and in fact did, intervene to advance the interests of the Companies. There were two mechanisms for the award of contracts by AMKTC. The first was by tender, which was employed for larger scale works. The contracts department of AMKTC (the \u201cContracts Department\u201d) would publicly call for tenders and interested contractors would submit their bids. This would sometimes be followed by an interview with shortlisted candidates conducted by Wong, the Secretary of the Estate Maintenance Committee (\u201cEMC\u201d), the relevant property managers and members of the Contracts Department. A Tender Evaluation Report (\u201cTER\u201d) would be prepared by the contract manager in charge of the tender and vetted by Wong, who would give his input on the draft and propose amendments. The TER would include a recommendation to award a contract based on the \u201cPrice Quality Methodology\u201d (\u201cPQM\u201d) and would be submitted to the EMC. The EMC, in turn, would make a recommendation to the Town Council, which would then vote on whether to accept the EMC\u2019s recommendations.', '9\\u2003The second mechanism was called an Invitation to Quote (\u201cITQ\u201d) and this was used for smaller scale works valued at less than S$70,000. The Contracts Department would invite contractors to submit quotes for these projects. The list of invited contractors was prepared by the Contracts Department and approved by Wong. Based on the quotes received, a recommendation as to the contractor to which a particular project should be awarded would be made by the Contracts Department to Wong and the Chairman of AMKTC, and the contractor\u2019s appointment depended upon securing the approval of both of them.', '10\\u2003As mentioned above at [7], the Discount Charge related to a discount that was extended to Wong when he purchased a motor car from 19-ANC. This occurred sometime towards the end of 2014, when Wong was looking to purchase a new motor car and informed Yip of this. Yip told Wong that 19-ANC was looking to upgrade a 16-month-old motor car that it owned, and that Wong could consider purchasing it. Wong wanted a discount because of the motor car\u2019s high mileage. Yip then discussed this with Chia, who had yet to be introduced to Wong (see [6] above). Chia decided to sell the motor car to Wong at a discounted price to gain favour for the Companies with AMKTC.', '11\\u2003The motor car in question was estimated to be worth S$85,000 at the time. Wong purchased the motor car from 19-ANC at a price of S$75,000. As part of the transaction, 19-NS2 also purchased Wong\u2019s old motor car for S$20,000 and then traded it in for S$16,500, incurring a loss of S$3,500. The overall discount obtained by Wong from the transaction, taking into account the loss that was absorbed by 19-NS2 on its purchase of Wong\u2019s old motor car, thus worked out to about S$13,500.', '12\\u2003The Remittance Charge related to two overseas remittances made to Wong\u2019s mistress Ms Xu Hongmei (\u201cXu\u201d) in China between June 2015 and November 2015.', '13\\u2003The first remittance occurred in June 2015 when Xu asked Wong to transfer her some money for renovations to her home. Wong approached Chia who, together with Tay, decided to remit S$20,000 (approximately RMB 92,400) to Xu through an intermediary. In the event, Xu eventually received RMB 80,000, the balance having been retained by the intermediary.', '14\\u2003The second remittance took place in November 2015 when Xu informed Wong that she had fallen victim to an investment scam and had lost around RMB 50,000 (approximately S$10,480). Wong again approached Chia who agreed to transfer RMB 50,000 to Xu. A sum of RMB 50,000 was transferred to Xu through an intermediary.', '15\\u2003In total, the remittances made by Chia to Xu amounted to about RMB 130,000 (approximately S$27,796.02).', '16\\u2003The Entertainment Charge related to entertainment expenses incurred by Chia at various KTV lounges, restaurants, spas and a hotel totalling S$34,070.04. The Entertainment Charge was an amalgamated charge under s 124(4) of the CPC and covered 29 separate occasions between 18 May 2015 and 13 July 2016. All the expenses incurred by Chia on these occasions were made the subject of the Entertainment Charge, without any apportionment of the amounts spent on persons other than Wong who might have been present at the time.', '17\\u2003Considerable effort was expended to conceal the entertainment expenses incurred in cultivating Wong. Chia initially paid such expenses in cash and was reimbursed these sums by Tay. Later, Chia began charging these expenses to a corporate debit card maintained by one of Tay\u2019s companies. Tay kept a handwritten record of cash claims made by Chia, keeping these off the corporate books, and separately recorded the debit card expenses that were incurred.', '18\\u2003Apart from the charges that they pleaded guilty to, Wong and Chia also each consented to having two charges taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. The first of these related to Chia procuring the employment of Wong\u2019s daughter-in-law by a company, with S$8,247.67 of her salary being paid for by 19-ANC. The second concerned Chia\u2019s payment of S$2,527.76 for a mobile phone line which was used by Wong.', '19\\u2003The various types of gratification given to Wong, unlike in many cases of this nature, were not tied to him showing favour to the Companies in any particular transaction. Rather, they were given to cultivate Wong such that he would become beholden to Chia and behave in a manner that would advance the business interests of the Companies in dealings with AMKTC.', '20\\u2003Wong advanced the business interests of the Companies with AMKTC in various ways, including in relation to some specific tenders:', '(a)\\u2003First, in a tender for repair and redecoration works pertaining to Housing and Development Board (\u201cHDB\u201d) residential blocks in the Teck Ghee Division in August 2015, 19-ANC and 19-NS2 were the second-lowest bidders for the tender. Yip then informed Wong that the lowest bidder, Foong Ah Weng Construction Pte Ltd (\u201cFoong Ah Weng\u201d), had recently been subject to a stop work order by another Town Council. Following from this, Wong directed AMKTC staff to look into the matter, and this resulted in Foong Ah Weng\u2019s PQM score being adjusted downward. Consequently, 19-NS2 was awarded the tender. Wong was recorded as having highlighted the unsatisfactory track record of Foong Ah Weng and recommending 19-NS2 during the EMC meeting to determine which contractor should be awarded the tender.', '(b)\\u2003Second, in a tender for repair and redecoration works pertaining to HDB residential blocks in the Yio Chu Kang Division in March 2015, Wong supported the award of the contract to 19-ANC over the lowest bidder Aik San Construction Pte Ltd (\u201cAik San\u201d), asserting that 19-ANC, unlike Aik San, had experience painting markets. During the preparation of the TER, Wong also inserted a line to emphasise the importance of prior experience in painting markets due to the timelines involved.', '(c)\\u2003Third, in a tender for a contract to supply low emission incense burners in August 2016, Wong instructed his staff to prioritise eco-friendly features because he knew that 19-ANC\u2019s proposal was the most eco-friendly amongst those participating in the tender process. Wong also gave instructions to increase the PQM score of 19-ANC while reducing those of a competitor. Wong further denied the requests of other bidders for additional time to produce a mock-up that met AMKTC\u2019s requirements. This meant that the competitors were unable to compete on equal terms with 19-ANC, which was the incumbent contractor supplying incense burners to AMKTC under a prior award.', '21\\u2003Wong also advanced the business interests of the Companies with AMKTC in relation to ITQs. Wong influenced the staff in the Contracts Department to include 19-ANC in the list of contractors invited to quote for jobs. This meant that 19-ANC was automatically included in the list of invited contractors on the understanding that this was Wong\u2019s preference, unless it was incapable of providing the required works.', '22\\u2003Wong also provided inputs, advice and assistance to the Companies by affording access to and maintaining an open channel of communication with Yip and Chia. Examples of this included: (a) assisting with the taking of photos and videos of a testing session for the eco-burner tender and seeking Yip\u2019s views on the drafting of the TER when 19-ANC was one of the bidders (see [20(c)] above); (b) advising on the appropriate bid pricing in relation to a tender; (c) sharing information about personnel changes at AMKTC; and (d) assisting to resolve disputes that sometimes cropped up between AMKTC staff and the Companies\u2019 staff in relation to the performance of contracts.'"}

The \nfifth applicant noted that there were objections in the US to roll-ups, but \ndistinguished them, as the objections were due to a US-specific statutory \npriority scheme which applies to reorganisation (or restructuring) proceedings \nunder US law, and would not apply in Singapore as Singapore\u2019s statutory \nscheme of creditor priorities only applies in the context of a liquidation and not \na scheme of arrangement.17\n8 In addition, roll-ups should not be disqualified from constituting \u201crescue \nfinancing\u201d as:18 s 211E(9) of the Companies Act imposes no such restriction; \nthe statutory framework for rescue financing is meant to be flexible; and the \ncourt in Re Attilan Group Ltd [2018] 3 SLR 898 (\u201cAttilan\u201d) held that s 211E(9) \ndoes not prohibit a rescue financier from stipulating conditions for the grant of \n13 5AS at paras 4(a), 8 to 14\n14 5AS at para 19\n15 5AS at para 15\n16 5AS at para 15\n17 5AS at para 18\n18 5AS at para 19\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nRe Design Studio Group Ltd[2020] SGHC 148\n5rescue finance. Endorsement of the roll-up in this case would not amount to \nendorsement of all roll-ups as each rescue financing offer has to be considered \non its own facts.19 In the present case, the roll-up should not disqualify the loan \nfrom constituting rescue finance as not all of the loan was refinance \u2013 part of it \nwould be fresh working capital.20 \n9 Second, the factors supporting the exercise of the court\u2019s discretion to \ngrant super-priority, as set out in my previous decision in Attilan, were met. \nReasonable attempts had been made to secure financing from alternative \nsources which would not require conferring of super-priority, but these were \nunsuccessful.21 There were no alternative financing options or better offers.22 \nThe terms of the proposed rescue financing were fair, reasonable and adequate; \nthey were negotiated in good faith, at arm\u2019s length, and with the exercise of \nsound and reasonable business judgment.23 The rescue financing was in the best \ninterests of the DSG Group and its creditors.24\nHSBC\u2019s arguments\n10 HSBC supported the application to grant the debt arising from the rescue \nfinancing super-priority status,25 and submitted as follows.\n19 5AS at para 19\n20 5AS at para 19\n21 5AS at paras 4(b), 20 to 26\n22 5AS at paras 4(b), 20 to 26\n23 5AS at paras 4(c), 31 to 37\n24 5AS at paras 4(c), 28 to 30\n25 HSBC\u2019s submissions dated 22 May 2020 (\u201cHS\u201d) at paras 1 and 57\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nRe Design Studio Group Ltd[2020] SGHC 148\n611 First, the proposed financing constitutes rescue financing under \ns 211E(9) of the Companies Act.26 It is necessary for the survival of the fifth \napplicant as a going concern, and necessary to achieve a more advantageous \nrealisation of its assets than on a winding up.27 \n12 Although the proposed rescue financing would be a roll-up, such roll-\nups are permitted under s 211E as they can fall within the scope of \u201crescue \nfinancing\u201d under s 211E(9), and such an interpretation would promote the \npolicy objectives undergirding the rescue financing regime, which is to \nincentivise financial institutions to provide rescue financing to distressed \ncompanies.28 A restrictive interpretation of \u201crescue financing\u201d is not needed as \nsuper-priority is discretionary and the court can consider a multitude of factors \nto decide whether to grant super-priority to rescue financing.29\n13 In addition, debts from roll-ups have been given super-priority status in \nUS cases such as Lyondell ([ 7] supra).30 The factors considered by the court in \nLyondell in deciding whether to grant super-priority to a roll-up debt were \nsimilar to those in Attilan ([ 8] supra).31 \n14 Although the present case did not involve cross-collateralisation, it was \npointed out for completeness that US courts have allowed cross-collateralisation \n26 HS at para 57\n27 HS at para 58\n28 HS at para 48\n29 HS at para 48\n30 HS at paras 9 and 14\n31 HS at paras 10 to 11\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nRe Design Studio Group Ltd[2020] SGHC 148\n7in some limited circumstances.32 Cross-collateralisation refers to the granting of \nthe debtor\u2019s assets as collateral for both the new and pre-existing loans.33 In \ncross-collateralisation cases, the factors applied to determine if super-priority \nshould be granted were similar to the factors applied in roll-up cases.34 \n15 Although there were US cases prohibiting cross-collateralisation, the \nreasons for the objections were not applicable in Singapore given the different \nlanguage of s 211E as compared to the relevant US provision.35 Section 364 of \nthe Bankruptcy Code 11 USC (US) was interpreted to allow super-priority only \nfor post-petition debts, whereas s 211E(1)(b) of the Companies Act allows \nsuper-priority for debts \u201cobtained or to be obtained\u201d, and would include pre-\npetition debt.36 Further, US has a statutory priority scheme for reorganisations, \nwhereas Singapore does not, as the statutory priority provisions in s 328 of the \nCompanies Act only apply in winding up situations.37 Alternatively, these \ndecisions should not be followed in Singapore.38  \n16 Second, the fifth applicant would not have been able to obtain rescue \nfinancing from any party unless super-priority was given.39 This fulfils the \nrequirement under s 211E(1)(b) of the Companies Act.40\n32 HS at para 17\n33 HS at para 15\n34 HS at para 15\n35 HS at paras 17, 35 to 36\n36 HS at paras 35 to 36\n37 HS at paras 39, 42 to 45\n38 HS at para 17\n39 HS at para 68\n40 HS at para 68\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nRe Design Studio Group Ltd[2020] SGHC 148\n817 Third, the court should exercise its discretion to grant the super-priority \nas:41 the fifth applicant has been unable to find financing on more favourable \nterms from other sources; the proposed financing arrangement was negotiated \nin good faith and at arm\u2019s length; the terms were fair, reasonable and adequate \nin light of the circumstances; and no creditors have opposed the application.\nThe Decision\n18 I was satisfied that super-priority should be granted to the debt under \ns 211E(1)(b), for the reasons that follow.\nRequirements to grant super-priority\nSection 211E\n19 Section 211E is titled \u201cSuper priority for rescue financing\u201d, and allows \nthe court to make various orders which have the general effect of giving the debt \narising from rescue financing priority over existing debts. The fifth applicant \napplied for super-priority under ss 211E(1)(a) and 211E(1)(b), which read:\nSuper priority for rescue financing\n211E.\u2014(1) Where a company has made an application under \nsection 210(1) or 211B(1), the Court may, on an application by \nthe company under this subsection, make one or more of the \nfollowing orders:\n(a) an order that if the company is wound up, the \ndebt arising from any rescue financing obtained, or to \nbe obtained, by the company is to be treated as if it were \npart of the costs and expenses of the winding up \nmentioned in section 328(1)(a);\n(b) an order that if the company is wound up, the \ndebt arising from any rescue financing obtained, or to \nbe obtained, by the company is to have priority over all \n41 HS at para 72\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nRe Design Studio Group Ltd[2020] SGHC 148\n9the preferential debts specified in section 328(1)(a) to (g) \nand all other unsecured debts, if the company would not \nhave been able to obtain the rescue financing from any \nperson unless the debt arising from the rescue financing \nis given the priority mentioned in this paragraph;\n\u2026\n20 A s 211E(1)(a) order treats the rescue financing as part of the costs and \nexpenses of the winding up, whereas a s 211E(1)(b) order gives the rescue \nfinancing priority over unsecured debts and the statutory preferential debts in \ninsolvency. In the latter case, only secured debt would have priority over the \nrescue financing. \nMandatory requirements to grant super-priority\n21 The mandatory requirements to grant super-priority under ss 211E(1)(a) \nor 211E(1)(b) are as follows (see also Attilan ([ 8] supra) at [53]):\n(a) An application must have had been made for a scheme meeting \nunder s 210(1), or a moratorium under s 211B(1) of the Companies Act;\n(b) The proposed financing must constitute \u201crescue financing\u201d \nunder s 211E(9) of the Companies Act; and\n(c) It must be that the company would not have been able to obtain \nthe rescue financing from any person unless the debt arising from the \nrescue financing is given the priority mentioned in the provision (only a \nrequirement under s 211E(1)(b) but not s 211E(1)(a); see Attilan at \n[61]).\n22 These requirements must be fulfilled before the court can determine \nwhether to exercise its discretion to grant super-priority. The requisite standard \nof proof is that the applicant must satisfy the court on a balance of probabilities \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nRe Design Studio Group Ltd[2020] SGHC 148\n10that there is a basis for the matters raised in the affidavit to satisfy the above \nrequirements (Attilan at [57]).\nDiscretionary requirements to grant super-priority \n23 Even if the mandatory requirements are met, the court has discretion to \ndetermine whether to grant super-priority. Although s 211E is silent on the \nfactors that the court should consider in exercising its discretion (Attilan at [67]), \nlegislative intent, committee reports and US cases provide some guidance as to \nthe factors that the court ought to consider in this inquiry. I had previously \nenumerated some of these factors in Attilan (at [65] to [67]). I remain satisfied \nthat these factors are material, but a definitive statement would have to await a \ncontested hearing. \n(1) Parliamentary debates\n24 The rescue financing scheme in s 211E of the Companies Act was \nintroduced in 2017 via s 22 of the Companies (Amendment) Act 2017 (No 15 \nof 2017). In the Second Reading of the Companies (Amendment) Bill (Bill No \n13\/2017) (\u201cBill\u201d) (Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (10 \nMarch 2017) vol 94 (\u201cSecond Reading\u201d), the Senior Minister of State moving \nthe Bill explained that the objective of the super-priority scheme is to facilitate \nrescue financing, to allow viable companies to be able to restructure.42 Mr Edwin \nTong, a member of the Insolvency Law Review Committee,43 caveated that \nsuper-priority is allowed only in appropriate circumstances,44 that new lending \n42 HSBC\u2019s Bundle of Authorities dated 22 May 2020 (\u201cHBOA\u201d) at Tab 6, p 41\n43 HBOA at p 43\n44 HBOA at p 46\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nRe Design Studio Group Ltd[2020] SGHC 148\n11should create new value for the company, and that courts are called upon to \nassess the viability of the purpose behind the proposed financing:45 \n\u2026 the Bill also introduces safeguards which will be scrutinised \nand policed by the Courts. It is only allowed in appropriate \ncircumstances and the court must be satisfied that there is \n\u201cadequate protection\u201d given to an existing security interest \nholder. This, as the Senior Minister of State mentioned, draws \ninspiration from the US Chapter 11 model. The rationale for the \nabove safeguard was that new lending should create new value \nfor the company such that it is in a position to protect the \ninterests of the security holder, whether by cash payments or \nby providing another form of security. In this way, the Courts \nare called upon to \u201cassess the viability of the purpose behind \nthe proposed financing\u201d.\nThe Bill facilitates rescue financing for distressed companies, \nwhist [sic] also managing any entailing risks. The US experience \nin Chapter 11 proceedings has been that rescue financings are \ninvariably value enhancing and are usually associated with a \nhigher probability of successful recovery. I hope that, with these \namendments, the same will be seen in Singapore. \n25 It can be seen from this that Parliament intended that the courts ensure \nthat super-priority is only granted in meritorious and appropriate cases. From \nthe above, it may be gleaned that the court should consider if:\n(a) the restructuring is viable and has a good probability of success;\n(b) the proposed financing is for a viable purpose and the new \nlending will be put to good use;\n(c) the new lending would create new value for the company; \n(d) there is adequate protection given to existing security interest \nholders; and\n(e) the risks entailed can be managed.\n45 HBOA at p 46\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nRe Design Studio Group Ltd[2020] SGHC 148\n12(2) Committee reports\n26 The rescue finance provisions introduced in 2017 were based on \nrecommendations by the Committee to Strengthen Singapore as an International \ncentre for Debt Restructuring in its Report of the Committee to Strengthen \nSingapore as an International centre for Debt Restructuring (20 April 2016) \n(\u201c2016 Restructuring Report\u201d) and by the Insolvency Law Review Committee \nin the Report of the Insolvency Law Review Committee (2013) (\u201c2013 ILRC \nReport\u201d). These reports provide some guidance on the relevant factors that the \ncourt should consider. \n27 The 2013 ILRC Report raised certain concerns about super-priority, at \npara 69 at pp 110 to 111:\n(1) Rescue proceedings often fail to successfully rehabilitate the \ninsolvent company. However, given their super-priority status, \nif the new financiers are fully secured, they may have little \nincentive to carry out costly screening or monitoring of the \ninsolvent borrower and may allow over-investment in riskier \n(even negative NPV) projects. Consequently, other creditors may \nend up suffering even greater losses once the rescue \nproceedings fail. This harm may be particularly pronounced in \nschemes of arrangement, where the management of the \ncompany remains in control of the insolvent company and there \nare greater incentives for equity holders of insolvent companies \nto advocate shifting into riskier, negative NPV projects.\n(2) In times of corporate trouble, it may be difficult for the court \nto predict in advance that the proposed rescue funding is likely \nto aid the body of creditors rather than prejudice them. In \nurgent cases, it may also be difficult to make a commercially \ninformed judgment in the time available.\n(3) The expenses involved in a contested court application for \napproval for super-priority rescue financing may negate the \nvalue of that financing for many smaller companies.\n(4)"}

In 2018, pursuant to an Indenture dated 11 May 2018, the Applicant issued USD$231,000,000 worth of 9% Senior Secured Notes, due in May 2021 (the \u201cNotes\u201d). These Notes, importantly for the purposes of the present case, are listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange. They are secured by moneys in a debt service account, and pledges of shares in some of the Applicant\u2019s subsidiaries.', '3\\u2003The 2020 Coronavirus pandemic has apparently gravely affected the Applicant and its subsidiaries, engendering a significant decrease in income and increasing the repayment burden under the Notes. The increased repayment burden is explicable on the basis that the Applicant\u2019s income is primarily denominated in Indonesian Rupiah (\u201cIDR\u201d) while its liabilities are in US Dollars (\u201cUSD\u201d), with the latter having appreciated against the IDR over the course of the pandemic. The Applicant was therefore unable to top up the amount in the aforementioned debt servicing account prior to the making of an interest payment due in May 2020, though it did release funds from that account in order to meet the said interest payment. Put in other words, the debt servicing account has been drawn-down to pay the May 2020 interest payment, and has not been topped up to its initial levels. The failure to top up the debt servicing account is a failure on the part of the Applicant to meet its obligations under the Notes.', '4\\u2003Given its financial difficulties, the Applicant intends to propose a scheme of arrangement under s 210(1) of the Companies Act. It therefore sought the moratorium which is the subject of the present application to protect it while negotiations are ongoing. A video meeting was held with some noteholders in May 2020, at which there was some discussion of the present difficulties faced by the Applicant and its subsidiaries, as well as of potential future courses of action. Some matters relating to potential future courses of action remain under discussion with the noteholders.', '5\\u2003Subsequent to the Applicant filing this application, it sought an adjournment of the hearing of this application as a number of its noteholders wanted time to consider their position with respect to the moratorium extension. However, I turned down the Applicant\u2019s request for an adjournment and interim extension as that would functionally have been an extension of the automatic moratorium without the statutory requirements for such an extension having been fulfilled beforehand. Instead, I required the company to establish that it had met those requirements before any extension was granted.', '6\\u2003In the event, I was so satisfied, and granted a two month extension of the moratorium until August 2020. These brief grounds will only touch on the question of the legal standing of the Applicant, a foreign company, to apply for a moratorium under s 211B of the Companies Act.'"}

In any event, the first defendant has itself applied to the arbitrator to stay the arbitration. The parties\u2019 intention now is for the plaintiff to commence an action against the first defendant and then to have that action consolidated with the Third Party Proceedings against Mr Ong and the Guarantee Suit so that all the claims be tried together. 12', 'The Conspiracy Suit has fallen away because it has now been entirely discontinued, even as against Mr Ong. 13'"}

{"casename":"2020_SGHC_159","fact":"The facts\n3 The partnership in question is Lee Huat Company (\u201cLee Huat\u201d or \u201cthe \nPartnership\u201d), which started as a sole-proprietorship in 1958. It is a retailer of \nmotorcycles and motor scooters, spare parts and accessories as well as a \nworkshop. Lee Huat operates at a shophouse in Upper Bukit Timah Road \nlocated at Nos. 873 to 875 (\u201cthe shophouse\u201d). Prior to 1975, Lee Huat was a \nsole-proprietorship of the late Lee Kim Eng (\u201cthe father\u201d) who started the \nbusiness in 1958 and was the father of the Plaintiff and the Defendants.\n4 On 4 February 1975, the Plaintiff joined Lee Huat as a partner. After the \nfather passed away on 4 October 1981, the Deceased was registered as a partner. \nAs the Deceased was illiterate, the business of Lee Huat was \nconducted\/managed by the Plaintiff. In July 2014, the Plaintiff suffered a severe \nstroke that incapacitated him. Thereafter Lee Huat\u2019s business was managed by \nLee Kai Leong Jeffrey (\u201cJeffrey\u201d) the Plaintiff\u2019s second son. On 22 February \n2016, Roland obtained an order of court under the Mental Capacity Act (Cap \n177A, 2010 Rev Ed), to be appointed the Plaintiff\u2019s litigation representative.\n5 According to the Defendants,1 the Deceased did not have any say in the \nmanagement or running of Lee Huat which was always a profitable and cash \norientated business. Neither did the Deceased share in the profits made by Lee \nHuat. The Defendants claimed that the Plaintiff took all the profits and only \ngave to the Deceased a monthly allowance of about $1,000.\n6 The Deceased had seven children and after they grew up and married, \nthey moved out from the shophouse, save for the two Defendants who never \n1 See the second defendant\u2019s affidavit of evidence in chief (AEIC) at para 6(b)   \nVersion No 3: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLee Ker Min v Lee Gin Hong[2020] SGHC 159\n3married. The second and first Defendants commenced working for Lee Huat in \n1984 and 1989 respectively, as administration clerks until they resigned in \nAugust 2016. During their employment with Lee Huat, the Defendants were \nresponsible for such matters as renewing the road taxes and certificates of \nentitlement and hire-purchase instalments of the motorcycles of Lee Huat\u2019s \ncustomers. These duties were described by the defendants as \u201cinside\u201d duties \nwere opposed to \u201coutside\u201d duties, which comprised of the workshop and the \nselling\/servicing of motorcycles\/motor scooters and spare parts by the Plaintiff, \nwho was assisted by Jeffrey. Lee Huat\u2019s business was usually transacted in cash \nsave for dealings with sub-dealers for new motorcycles, hire-purchase \ninstalment payments, sales of motorcycles or trade-in transactions.\n7 According to the Defendants, after the demise of the father, the Plaintiff \nhad a free hand in how he conducted Lee Huat\u2019s business. Apart from \nperforming simple tasks such as sweeping the floor, cooking and making \nbeverages as it was a family business, the Deceased took no part in the business \nof Lee Huat.\n8 ln or around 1994, the Plaintiff decided to set up LH Motor Pte Ltd \n(\"LHMPL\") in which he would park new motorcycles for trading. The Plaintiff \nheld 70% of LHMPL's shares while the Deceased and the two Defendants each \nheld 10%. The Partnership's business in the sale and purchase of new \nmotorcycles was then moved to LHMPL.\n9 The Plaintiff used the Partnership\u2019s monies for the initial capital \ninvestment in LHMPL. As and when LHMPL made sales, the money was either \ncollected directly by the Partnership, or repaid by LHMPL to the Partnership. \nVersion No 3: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLee Ker Min v Lee Gin Hong[2020] SGHC 159\n410 The Defendants alleged that the Plaintiff also made use of the \nPartnership\u2019s monies, profits it made as well its overdraft facility with United \nOverseas Bank (\u201cUOB\u2019s overdraft facility\u201d) and funds from its other banks for \nhis and his family\u2019s expenses. The UOB overdraft facility for the sum of $1.5m \nwas obtained on 22 Aug 2000. It is payable on demand with an interest of 1.5% \nover UOB\u2019s prevailing prime rate. The facility and all monies owed by the \nPartnership was secured by a mortgage of a 3-storey semi-detached house at \n59A Choa Chu Kang Road, Singapore 689482 (\u201c59A CCK\u201d), which is solely \nowned by the Plaintiff but acquired using Lee Huat\u2019s monies.

He told the Defendants that he had \nreceived an offer to sell 615 Balestier for $800,000.00 and asked the Defendants \nfor details of the outstanding sum on the UOB Overdraft Facility as he intended \nto use the proceeds of sale to repay the loan. He mentioned that he was hoping \nto increase the sale price to $1,000,000. However, the sale did not materialise \nfor reasons not known to the Defendants.  \n12 In her affidavit-of-evidence (\u201cAEIC\u201d),3 the second Defendant tabulated \nthe monies the Plaintiff had withdrawn from Lee Huat as follows:-\nParticulars Amount the \nPlaintiff took Profits\/sums \naccounted \nforSums to be accounted \nfor\/ constructive trustee \nof  \nBlk 223 \nCCK$123,999.50 $251,665.16 $0\n59A CCK $890,253.82 $0 $890,253.82\n615 \nBalestier $605,131 .50 $475,000.00 $130,131.50\nEverfit $46.910.00 $190,000.00 $0\nBikelink $88,000.00 $0 $88,000.00\nCycle \nTrade$103,531.31  $0 $103,531.31\n2  See para 85 of the second Defendant\u2019s AEIC.\n3 At para 39 of the second Defendant\u2019s AEIC.\nVersion No 3: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLee Ker Min v Lee Gin Hong[2020] SGHC 159\n7Arrow \nSpeed  $5,000.00 $0 $5,000.00\n34 Norris \nRoad $294,627.73 $0 $294,627.73\nPurchases \nof vehicles$126,974.37 $0 $126,974.37\nFamily $222,614.35 $140,000.00 $82,614.35\nOthers $92,500.00 $0 $92,500.00\nTotal $2,599,542.58 $1,813,632.78\n13 Initially, the Deceased and the Defendants lived in the rooms above the \nshophouse. After the premises were compulsorily acquired by the Housing and \nDevelopment Board (\u201cthe HDB\u201d) in or around mid-1980s, all three moved to \nNo 75 Chua Chu Kang Road (\u201c75 CCK\u201d) where the Defendants took care of the \nDeceased until she passed away. In recognition of their devotion to her for over \n30 years, the Deceased bequeathed 75 CCK to the Defendants in her Will where \nthey reside to this day.\n14 The genesis of this litigation was a letter dated 29 January 2015 that the \nDefendants received from the Plaintiff\u2019s solicitors, acting for the Plaintiff\u2019s \ndaughter Lee Ling Ling Jamie. The letter stated that the Partnership had a \n\"substantial amount of overdraft\", and requested that the Defendants make \nprovision to set aside $1.3m to deal with this issue.\n15 The solicitors acting for the estate of the Deceased replied to the \nPlaintiff\u2019s solicitors\u2019 letter at [ 14] on 13 February 2015 stating that the Deceased \nhad passed away and that to the Defendants\u2019 understanding, the Deceased held \n50% shares in the Partnership. They requested for the value of the Deceased\u2019s \nVersion No 3: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLee Ker Min v Lee Gin Hong[2020] SGHC 159\n8shares as at the date of her death on 19 December 2014. The Defendants were \nthe executors of the Deceased\u2019s estate under her Will dated 15 January 2013. \nThe Defendants applied for and were granted probate of her estate in 2015. They \ndistributed her assets in accordance with the Deceased\u2019s Will in or about May \nand June 2016. \n16 On 22 February 2015, the Defendants had a meeting with the Plaintiff\u2019s \nwife NLL, Jeffrey and Lee Kai Chuan Keith (\u201cKeith\u201d) who is the Plaintiff\u2019s \nyoungest son and an accountant. The following matters were discussed:\n(a) the Defendants highlighted that the Partnership's business had \nalways been profitable year on year. Most of the UOB Overdraft Facility \nwas used by the Plaintiff for his personal affairs. Shortly before his \nstroke, the Plaintiff told the Defendants that he intended to sell 615 \nBalestier Road to pay off the UOB Overdraft Facility; and\n(b) NLL, Jeffrey and Keith indicated they would not be dealing with \nthe matter until the court appointed one of them as the Plaintiff\u2019s deputy. \n17 The Estate\u2019s solicitors wrote to the Plaintiff\u2019s solicitors on 25 February \n2015 to say that a substantial portion of the debt under the UOB Overdraft \nFacility was utilised by the Plaintiff for his personal use.\n18 ln the meantime, Jeffrey was in the process of formally taking over the \nbusiness of the Partnership. He wrote to the HDB on 23 March 2015 seeking to \ntransfer the tenancy of the shophouse to his personal name. After the shophouse \nwas compulsorily acquired by HDB in 1994, it had been leased back to the \nDeceased in her sole name. As such, the second Defendant felt that Jeffrey had \nno basis to request that the lease be transferred to his name. However, as they \nare his aunts, the Defendants felt there was no need at that time to contest the \nVersion No 3: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLee Ker Min v Lee Gin Hong[2020] SGHC 159\n9issue even though the lease was valuable, being situated in a prime location with \na long history of being a successful motorcycle workshop; and the name Lee \nHuat was well known in the market. The cost of the lease from HDB was only \n$1,499.07 per month.\n19 The Defendants did not receive a response from the Plaintiff\u2019s solicitors \non the issue of the lease. Instead, on or about 11 April 2015, the Estate\u2019s \nsolicitors received a copy of the Partnership's balance sheet, profit & loss \naccounts and statement of rental account for the period of 1 January 2014 to \n19 December 2014 (\u201cthe 2014 Accounting Records\"). The 2014 Accounting \nRecords showed that the Partnership was solvent and had earned net profits of \n$78,259.02 for the period of 1 January 2014 to 19 December 2014.\n20 Due to the increasingly tense relationship between the Defendants and \nthe Plaintiff\u2019s family, the two sisters decided to resign from Lee Huat, which \nthey did with effect from 1 August 2016. In the course of consolidating the \nrecords to be handed over to the Plaintiff's family, the Defendants discovered \nthat the bank journal records from 1991 to June 1999 were missing. They \nalleged that throughout that period, both NLL and Jeffrey had access to the \noffice of Lee Huat where the records were kept.\n21 By a letter dated 6 May 2016, Roland as the Plaintiff's deputy, wrote to \nthe Defendants to state that the Estate had an obligation to settle all debts of the \nPartnership. The Estate\u2019s solicitors replied to Roland on 16 May 2016 \nreiterating that \"a very substantial portion of the UOB Debt was utilized by [the \nPlaintiff] for his personal affairs\u201d.\n22 In his email reply dated 20 May 2016, Roland took the position that the \nEstate\u2019s solicitors were in conflict of interest because they were the solicitors \nVersion No 3: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLee Ker Min v Lee Gin Hong[2020] SGHC 159\n10who drafted the Will of the Deceased. The Defendants responded by letter dated \n24 May 2016 disagreeing with Roland\u2019s position.\n23 Roland sent a further letter to the Defendants dated 10 June 2016 \nalleging that they were running the business of Lee Huat after the death of the \nDeceased, when in actual fact (according to the Defendants), it was his brother, \nJeffrey who did. Roland also asserted that 615 Balestier Road belonged to the \nPlaintiff personally and had nothing to do with Lee Huat. Further, Roland \ncontended that the Estate must pay all the debts of the Partnership.  \n24 In their letter dated 12 July 2016 in reply to Roland\u2019s letter dated 10 June \n2016, the Defendants pointed out that Roland well knew Jeffrey was running \nthe business of Lee Huat and that they were mere employees. They added that \nRoland was aware that the Plaintiff had utilised the Partnership\u2019s assets to pay \nfor 615 Balestier Road and, the Plaintiff must repay the monies he had taken \nfrom Lee Huat for his personal use.\n25 In a further letter dated 4 August 2016 to Roland, the Defendants placed \non record that they had met Roland, Jeffrey and NLL on 1 August 2016 at which \nthey had tendered their resignation letters which Roland had accepted.  Further, \nthey had spent hours with Roland going through the Partnership\u2019s accounts and \nhad shown him documents that proved the Plaintiff took monies from the \nPartnership for: (i) medical expenses; (ii) personal utilities bills; \n(iii) miscellaneous expenses, and they had handed over (iv) a file on 59A CCK \nand (v) a file on 615 Balestier Road. \n26 By its letter dated 23 September 2016, the Plaintiff\u2019s solicitors \ndemanded that the Defendants withdraw their allegation that the Plaintiff had \nused the Partnership\u2019s assets to purchase 615 Balestier Road and added that they \nVersion No 3: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLee Ker Min v Lee Gin Hong[2020] SGHC 159\n11must bear half of the outstanding sum owed by the Partnership on UOB\u2019s \nOverdraft Facility. The Defendants replied to the letter on 29 August 2016 \nreiterating their position in their letter dated 12 July 2016, as above at [ 24].  \n27 By his letter dated 30 September 2016 to the Defendants, Roland \nasserted that he was unaware of how the Defendants had managed the \nPartnership. \n28 In May 2017, Jeffrey visited the Defendants bringing with him HDB\u2019s \nletter dated 25 May 2017. HDB\u2019s letter requested evidence from Jeffrey that the \nexecutors of the Estate were agreeable to his taking over the motorcycle \nworkshop operating at the shophouse.\n29 The Estate\u2019s solicitors\u2019 letter to the HDB dated 11 August 20174 pointed \nout that the last temporary occupation licence (\u201cTOL\u201d) issued to the Deceased \nlapsed on 31 March 2015 and that the Defendants had informed the HDB on \n10 March 2015 of the demise of the Deceased. The letter noted that the HDB \nhad been dealing directly with Jeffrey to the exclusion of the Defendants \nsubsequent to 10 March 2015 after Jeffrey wrote to the HDB to say he wanted \nto take over the TOL for the shophouse.  Consequently, the Estate had nothing \nto do with the Partnership after the HDB allowed Jeffrey to take over the TOL \nand the operations of the business at the shophouse.\n30 Under cover of the Plaintiff\u2019s solicitors\u2019 letter dated 23 October 2018,5 \nthe Estate\u2019s solicitors received the expert report of Tee Wey Lih (\u201cTee\u201d) dated \n4  At AB 132\n5 At AB135\nVersion No 3: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLee Ker Min v Lee Gin Hong[2020] SGHC 159\n1216 April 2018 (\u201cTee\u2019s Report\u201d);6 Tee is from Acres Advisory Pte Ltd. Relying \non para 8.10 of Tee\u2019s report, the letter stated that the Partnership\u2019s liabilities \nwere in the region of $710,214 under the UOB Overdraft Facility excluding \ninterest accrued after 19 December 2014. Further, Tee\u2019s Report at para 5.61 \nstated that the Defendants had withdrawn a sum of $20,000 from the \nPartnership\u2019s UOB account on 20 December 2014 for the funeral expenses of \nthe Deceased. The Plaintiff\u2019s solicitors demanded that the Defendants repay half \nthe overdraft amount plus the accrued interest as well as the aforesaid $20,000. \nIt should be noted at this juncture that Tee subsequently issued a supplementary \nreport dated 24 May 2019 (\u201cTee\u2019s Supplementary Report\u201d)7 which will be \naddressed together with Tee\u2019s Report when the court reviews Tee\u2019s testimony.\n31 In response to the Plaintiff\u2019s solicitors\u2019 letter at [ 30], the Defendants\u2019 \nnew\/current solicitors wrote on 10 December 2018,8 rejecting the demands for \nrepayment of the overdraft amount as well as the $20,000 and giving the reasons \ntherefor. The Defendants\u2019 solicitors criticised Tee\u2019s Report on many counts and \npointed out that the Plaintiff\u2019s conduct in withdrawing monies from the \nPartnership for his own personal use was a breach of trust and a breach of his \nfiduciary duties as a partner of Lee Huat. As such, it was for the Plaintiff to \nsettle the liabilities under UOB\u2019s Overdraft Facility. The letter added that the \n$20,000 meant for funeral expenses for the Deceased had been credited back to \nLee Huat\u2019s UOB account. The letter asked for a response from the Plaintiff by \n10 January 2019. \n6 At AB6196- 6310 \n7 See AB6311-6341 \n8 At AB261-265\nVersion No 3: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLee Ker Min v Lee Gin Hong[2020] SGHC 159\n1332 The response dated 13 December 20189 from the Plaintiff\u2019s solicitors \nwas to inquire whether the Defendants\u2019 solicitors had instructions to accept \nservice of the writ of summons.  On 21 December 2018, the Plaintiff filed this \nsuit and the statement of claim.\nThe pleadings\n33 In the statement of claim Amendment No 1 (\u201cthe SOC\u201d), the Plaintiff \nreferred to the overdraft facility of $1.5m extended by UOB to the Partnership \non 22 August 2000, which was repayable on demand. The Plaintiff stated that \nas at the date of the demise of the Deceased (19 December 2014), the amount \nof the overdraft was $940,986.20. As of 30 November 2018, the overdraft sum \nhad ballooned to $1,110,221.20. \n34 The Plaintiff alleged that the parties could not agree on the value and \nliabilities of the Deceased as at the date of her death, despite exchanges of \ncorrespondence between the parties\u2019 solicitors. Consequently, the Plaintiff \naverred that he engaged Tee to go through the accounts of the Partnership and \nto produce a report as at 19 December 2014.\n35 The Plaintiff relied on Tee\u2019s Report to substantiate his allegation that the \nDefendants had breached the Partnership and the Partnership Act (Cap 391, \n1994 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe Partnership Act\u201d) in that they had failed to pay half of the \noverdraft amount of $710,214 together with interest (from 19 December 2014) \nowed to UOB.10 With interest, the overdraft amount increased to $940,986.20 \nas at 19 December 2014. \n9 At AB266\n10 At para 18 of the SOC \nVersion No 3: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLee Ker Min v Lee Gin Hong[2020] SGHC 159\n1436 The Plaintiff further alleged that $20,000 referred to at [ 30] was meant \nfor the funeral expenses of the Deceased when such expenses should have been \nborne by the Estate. \n37 The Plaintiff alleged that the Defendants\u2019 failure to pay half of the \noverdraft amount was a breach of s 9 of the Partnership Act. The section states:\nEvery partner in a firm is liable jointly with the other partners \nfor all debts and obligations of the firm incurred while he is a \npartner; and after his death his estate is also severally liable in \na due course of administration for such debts and obligations, \nso far as they remain unsatisfied, but subject to the prior \npayment of his separate debts.\n38 The Plaintiff asserted that the Defendants had acted in bad faith in \nadministering the estate of the Deceased in breach of trust and their fiduciary \nduties without regard for the debts of the Partnership when they were aware of \nthe UOB Overdraft Facility. The Plaintiff alleged that the Defendants operated \nthe UOB Overdraft Facility themselves, were employees of the Partnership and \nwere directly involved with the accounts of the Partnership.11 In the event that \nthe Defendants had fully distributed the assets of the Estate without paying their \nshare of the debts of the Partnership, the Plaintiff averred that they should be \nmade personally liable for those debts.\n39 The Plaintiff prayed for a declaration that as at the date of the death of \nthe Deceased on 19 December 2014, the Partnership had a debt of $740,214 and \nthat the Defendants as the executors of the Deceased\u2019s estate pay half the said \ndebt. The Plaintiff further claimed $20,000 from the Defendants, as otherwise \nthey would be unjustly enriched at the expense of the Plaintiff.12 \n11 See para 28 of the SOC. \n12 At para 27 of the SOC\nVersion No 3: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLee Ker Min v Lee Gin Hong[2020] SGHC 159\n1540 In the Defence and Counterclaim (\u201cD&CC\u201d) filed by the Defendants, \nthey contended that the Deceased never received any profits from the \nPartnership while she was a partner, that the Plaintiff managed the business of \nthe Partnership solely until he suffered a stroke in July 2014 after which Jeffrey \ntook over the business.\n41 The Defendants criticised Tee\u2019s Report and asserted that his report on \nthe accounts of the Partnership as at 19 December 2014 was inaccurate as Tee \nfailed to take into account the substantial sums the Plaintiff had taken from the \nPartnership, which sums were the basis of the Defendants\u2019 counterclaim.  The \nDefendants asserted that the Plaintiff had withdrawn from the Partnership large \nsums from the UOB Overdraft Facility as well as from the Partnership\u2019s other \nbank accounts (\u201cthe Misapplied Sums\u201d) for his personal use, which were wholly \nunrelated to the Partnership, in breach of his fiduciary duties to the Partnership.\n42 Particulars of the Misapplied Sums were provided in Annexures A and \nB to the D&CC. The total sum in Annex A is $1,160,003.62 while in Annex B \n(which commencement date was May 1991), it is $782,895.38. The two sums \ntotal $1,942,899.00. Those sums far exceeded the UOB Overdraft Facility \namount, which the Defendants claimed to be $940,986.21 as at 19 December \n2014. \n43 The Defendants averred that they believed and relied on the accounts \nRoland had forwarded to them,13 which stated that the Partnership was solvent \nand profitable in 2014 before they distributed the assets of the Estate of the \nDeceased in July 2016. They denied the Plaintiff\u2019s allegation that they prepared \n13 See [18] infra\nVersion No 3: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLee Ker Min v Lee Gin Hong[2020] SGHC 159\n16the accounts pointing out that the Plaintiff engaged an external bookkeeper Yeo \nAh Hong (\u201cYeo\u201d) every year to prepare the accounts of Lee Huat.   \n44 In the alternative, in the event the Estate is found liable for the overdraft \namount of $710,214 or any part thereof, the Defendants averred that the Estate \nis entitled to a set-off and counterclaim for the sums taken out from Lee Huat \nby the Plaintiff for his personal use for which the Defendants prayed for an \ninquiry to be held to determine the amounts. In the further alternative, the \nDefendants pleaded to be relieved from personal liability of their administration \nof the Estate under s 60 of the Trustees Act (Cap 337, 2005 Rev Ed) \n45 The Defendants denied the Partnership paid for the funeral expenses of \nthe Deceased; they asserted they paid the expenses. The Defendants further \ndenied they operated the UOB Overdraft Facility. The Defendants added they \nhad returned to the UOB account the $20,000 cash that Jeffrey passed to them \non:\n(a) 14 February 2015 $15,000.00\n(b) 6 March 2015 $ 5,000.00\n46 The Defendants further alleged that Lee Huat had over the years since \n4 October 1981 up to 19 December 1984 made profits of $2,250,896.98, which \nprofits the Deceased never received. They alleged that the Plaintiff must have \nwithdrawn and\/or misapplied those profits since the Partnership had alleged net \nliabilities of $710,214 as at 19 December 2014. The Defendants contended that \npursuant to s 29 of the Partnership Act, the Plaintiff was liable to account to the \nPartnership for all private profits withdrawn from the Partnership for the period \n4 October 1981 to 19 December 2014. The Defendants added that the Plaintiff \nheld the Misapplied Sums and profits that he had taken from the Partnership as \nVersion No 3: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLee Ker Min v Lee Gin Hong[2020] SGHC 159\n17constructive trustee and is liable to account to the Partnership and the Estate for \nthe sums taken.\n47 In the Reply and Defence of the Counterclaim filed by Roland on the \nPlaintiff\u2019s behalf, he did not admit that the Deceased was illiterate. Instead, \nRoland described the Deceased as a savvy business woman who was extremely \nsmart and well versed with every aspect of Lee Huat\u2019s business of which she \nwas a cheque signatory. Roland claimed that when the Deceased went to the \nshophouse every morning, she could handle the cashier\u2019s machine, collect \npayments from customers and gave them change as well as make payment to \nvendors. He claimed that apart from being a director and shareholder of \nLHMPL, the Deceased was the sole-proprietor of Chip Huat Electronic Co., \nChip Huat Motor as well as Halford Impex.\n48 It was pleaded that the Plaintiff only went to work at Lee Huat in the \nafternoons. Roland denied the Plaintiff managed Lee Huat solely and that the \nDeceased took no part in the management. He alleged that after the Plaintiff \nsuffered a stroke in July 2014, the Deceased retained control while the \nDefendants, from whom Jeffrey took instructions, ran the entire business. \nMonies collected by Jeffrey were handed to the Defendants at the end of every \nbusiness day. The Defendants also kept the cheque books of Lee Huat. They \nheld pre-signed cheques of the Deceased that they used to withdraw monies \nfrom the UOB Overdraft Facility after the Deceased\u2019s demise. Roland alleged \nthat the Defendants used Lee Huat\u2019s monies to purchase shares personally.\n49 Roland disagreed that Tee\u2019s Report was inaccurate and that the \nDefendants had repaid the $20,000 withdrawn from Lee Huat\u2019s UOB account \nfor the Deceased\u2019s funeral expenses. \nVersion No 3: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLee Ker Min v Lee Gin Hong[2020] SGHC 159\n1850 Roland also alleged that the Deceased had pre-signed cheques for the \nPartnership and the Defendants utilised those cheques to make withdrawals \nfrom the UOB Overdraft Facility account after the demise of the Deceased by \nbackdating the cheques. He alleged that the UOB Overdraft account was \noperated by the Defendants who siphoned monies from the Partnership to buy \nshares in their own names. Thereafter, the second defendant opened another \naccount for the Partnership with RHB bank with herself and Jeffrey as alternate \nsignatories. Control of the RHB account was vested solely in the second \nDefendant who kept the cheque books.  \n51 Roland further alleged that the Defendants had never made full \ndisclosure of the assets of the estate. He alleged that the Defendants relied on \n2014 accounts that they had prepared themselves.\n52 In short the Plaintiff denied all the allegations made by the Defendants.\nThe evidence\n53 The court will deal with the evidence of the factual witnesses for both \nparties and then address the expert testimony separately. \n(i) The Plaintiff\u2019s case \n54 The Plaintiff had four witnesses namely Roland, Jeffrey, the expert Tee \nand a former employee of Lee Huat called Giam Cheng (\u201cGiam\u201d). On their part, \nboth Defendants testified together with their expert who was Mun Siong Yoong \n(\u201cMun\u201d) from Vallaris Deal Advisory Pte Ltd whose report was dated \n6 December 2019 (\u201cMun\u2019s Report\u201d). Mun also issued a supplementary report \ndated 24 January 2020 (\u201cMun\u2019s Supplementary Report\u201d).   \nVersion No 3: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLee Ker Min v Lee Gin Hong[2020] SGHC 159\n1955 In his AEIC,14 Roland primarily repeated what was set out in the Reply \nand Defence to the Counterclaim,15 namely that the Deceased \u201cwas an extremely \nsmart woman and well versed with every aspect of the partnership business\u201d \nwho was also the cheque signatory for the Partnership.  \n56 Roland claimed that the first Defendant had her own electrical appliance \nbusiness called Chip Huat Electronic Co. that operated along the same stretch \nof shops from Lee Huat. The shop was also compulsorily acquired by the HDB \nat the same time as the shophouse.  Roland claimed his two uncles were not on \ngood terms with the first Defendant and refused to allow her to work at Lee \nHuat until pressured by the Deceased to do so in or around 1989.\n57 Although they worked as administration clerks in Lee Huat, Roland \ndeposed that the Defendants\u2019 responsibilities and powers were essentially the \nsame as directors. They were also the Deceased\u2019s most trusted and beloved \nchildren as reflected in the fact that they were appointed the executors and \ntrustees of the Estate and were the main beneficiaries under the Deceased\u2019s Will.\n58 Roland claimed the Plaintiff only went to work at Lee Huat in the \nafternoons because he usually woke up late having spent the previous night and \nthe wee hours of that morning socialising and entertaining to generate business \nfor Lee Huat. He claimed the Defendants ran the Partnership in its entirety in \nthe mornings together with the Deceased. \n14 At para 13\n15 At para 2(i),(iii) and (vi).\nVersion No 3: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLee Ker Min v Lee Gin Hong[2020] SGHC 159\n2059 He deposed that the Plaintiff employed Yeo as an external bookkeeper \nto finalise the Partnership\u2019s accounts on a yearly basis, and those accounts were \nprepared based on the handwritten data entries of the second Defendant.\n60 Roland claimed that the Partnership\u2019s monies were controlled by the \nDeceased as the matriarch of the family. She would give her other children \nmoney from the Partnership including using $50,790.02 from the Partnership\u2019s \nmonies to bail out her eldest son Lee Kerk Hen (\u201cKerk Hen\u201d) from bankruptcy. \nHe alleged that the first Defendant utilised $233,921.56 of the Partnership\u2019s \nmonies to buy shares for herself between 1997 and 2000. \n61 Roland claimed that the net profits of the Partnership, like its capital, \nwere divided equally between the Plaintiff and the Deceased although in some \nyears, the Plaintiff contributed more towards the capital. He deposed that Lee \nHuat\u2019s former employee Giam would be able to testify to the modus operandi \nof the Partnership.  \n62 Roland alleged that because the UOB Overdraft Facility was secured by \nthe Plaintiff\u2019s personal property at 59A CCK, the Defendants as the executors \nof the Estate of the Deceased had chosen to frustrate any attempts by him or his \nfamily to resolve the matter with UOB. The result was that interest continued to \nto run on the overdraft amount of $940,986.20 (as at 19 December 2014) and \nthe amount had ballooned to $1,119,294.78 as of 28 February 2019.   \n63 Roland denied the Plaintiff had used significant sums of money from \nLee Huat for his personal affairs let alone that the sundry debtor amounts were \ndue from the Plaintiff. Hence he brought Tee in as the expert to review the \nbalance sheet and other relevant documents of Lee Huat to determine the value \nVersion No 3: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLee Ker Min v Lee Gin Hong[2020] SGHC 159\n21of the assets and liabilities and finalise the accounts between the Plaintiff and \nthe Estate as at 19 December 2014.\n64 Roland relied heavily if not totally on Tee\u2019s Report for his contention \nthat the Estate\/the Defendants are liable to pay half plus the interest on, the UOB \nOverdraft Facility\u2019s outstanding amount of $710,214. Roland also relied on the \nAEIC of Jeffrey to support the Plaintiff\u2019s claim, which he described as simple \nand straightforward and to which the Defendants had no defence. He accused \nthe Defendants of acting mala fides and asserted their Counterclaim was \nunfounded and conjured up to deny and frustrate the Plaintiff\u2019s claim.\n65 At the outset, the court notes that Roland does not work and has never \nworked in Lee Huat; he works in a local bank. Neither did he live at the \nshophouse after he married in 2001. He therefore does not have any personal \nknowledge of the goings-on in the Partnership. During cross-examination, the \nfollowing evidence was adduced from Roland:\n(a) he had limited knowledge of the business of Lee Huat, and even \nless of the business affairs of his father\u2019s brothers including Kerk Hen, \nparticularly on property ownership;\n(b) he did not know if the Plaintiff had other sources of income apart \nfrom Lee Huat but was aware the Partnership was the Plaintiff\u2019s main \nsource of income;\n(c) he was \u201cnot very sure\u201d on matters relating to the immoveable \nproperties held by the Deceased and why she bequeathed specific \nproperties to the Defendants and to his uncle Kerk Hen;\nVersion No 3: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLee Ker Min v Lee Gin Hong[2020] SGHC 159\n22(d) Chip Huat Electronic Co. that he claimed was the first \nDefendant\u2019s business was actually left to the Deceased by his \ngrandfather and the first Defendant helped the Deceased to run it until \nits premises were compulsorily acquired by HDB.\n66 In fact, cross-examination of Roland proved him wrong on several \nallegations including his claim that the Deceased used the Partnership monies \nto bail out his uncle Kerk Hen from bankruptcy. In actual fact, the Deceased did \nnot give Kerk Hen any money from Lee Huat. She gave Kerk Hen (who is her \neldest son) $50,000 from the compensation sum paid by HDB for compulsorily \nacquiring Nos. 873 and 875 Upper Bukit Timah Road, which properties were \njointly owned by the father and Kerk Hen.16\n67 Roland was also unable to substantiate his other allegation17 that the \nDeceased paid $39,395.52 on 12 July 1990 together with another $11,394.50 on \n5 September 1984 to the Official Assignee\u2019s office on behalf of Kerk Hen.\n68 Equally, Roland\u2019s allegation that the first Defendant used the \nPartnership\u2019s monies to purchase shares was also unfounded. The Defendants\u2019 \nsolicitors had written a lengthy letter dated 24 January 202018 to the Plaintiff\u2019s \nsolicitors with supporting documents to explain that the share purchases were \nmade on the instructions of the Plaintiff. When the purchased shares were sold, \nthe proceeds were returned to the Partnership\u2019s bank account, on the directions \nof the Plaintiff, together with the profits made. Similarly, for shares bought on \nbehalf of the Deceased, the same modus operandi applied.\n16 See HDB\u2019s letter dated 18 Nov 1994 addressed to the Deceased and the father at AB5378\n17 At para 21 of his AEIC\n18 At 2AB464 -470\nVersion No 3: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLee Ker Min v Lee Gin Hong[2020] SGHC 159\n2369 Shares that the Defendants purchased for the Plaintiff that remained \nunsold were held by the Defendants who were ready to transfer them to the \nPlaintiff. Where the first Defendant purchased shares personally using cheques \nissued from Lee Huat\u2019s bank account, she reimbursed the Partnership. After \nbeing pressed by the court,19 Roland eventually conceded that this complaint \nwas frivolous.\n70 In their letter dated 24 January 2020, the Defendants\u2019 solicitors had \ninvited Roland to withdraw \u201cthe several scandalous allegations\u2026.that are \ncompletely irrelevant to"}

{"casename":"2020_SGHC_162","fact":"'11\\u2003The appellant, a Singaporean, was born on 19 July 1955 in Singapore. The Passport with which he travelled on the 46 occasions reflected the bearer\u2019s name as \u201cNgo Boris Jacinto\u201d, a Philippine national born on 27 August 1967 in San Juan, Rizal. 2', 'However, the Passport bore the appellant\u2019s photograph. On each of the 23 occasions when the appellant entered Singapore using the Passport, he produced a disembarkation form which reflected the particulars stated in the Passport, and contained the declaration that he had never \u201cused a passport under [a] different name to enter Singapore\u201d. 3', '12\\u2003The appellant did not dispute the facts above: GD at [34]\u2013[37]. According to him, in 2004, his passport was detained by the Chinese authorities while he was in China on business. As a result, he could not leave China. In 2009, one \u201cMr Tsai\u201d from the Huashin Group, the company the appellant worked for, asked him to go to Taiwan to attend to some business matters. Eventually, in March 2010, \u201cMr Tsai\u201d, who was anxious for the appellant to go to Taiwan, introduced him to one \u201cMr Huang\u201d. The latter told the appellant that he could obtain an investment passport from the Philippines for the appellant. The appellant claimed that at this time, his mother was also very sick, and he wanted to visit her in Singapore. Therefore, the appellant agreed to pay US$250,000 to \u201cMr Huang\u201d to buy a company in the Philippines. Subsequently, in March 2011, the appellant received the Passport.', '13\\u2003The appellant\u2019s defence was that he believed the Passport to be a genuine Philippine passport although the date and place of birth were wrong: GD at [38]\u2013[41]. He asserted that the information stated in the disembarkation forms accordingly was also not false. According to the appellant, he had given \u201cMr Huang\u201d his personal particulars, photograph, and fingerprints for the purposes of the passport application. 4', 'Furthermore, the appellant said that he had successfully used the Passport on 188 occasions without encountering any problems.', '14\\u2003The appellant claimed that he was also known as \u201cBoris\u201d, that \u201cNgo\u201d was the Filipino equivalent of his surname, ie, Goh, and that \u201cJacinto\u201d was the middle name which \u201cMr Huang\u201d provided for the purposes of the passport application. This was because the Philippines was a matrilineal society which required the appellant\u2019s mother\u2019s name to be reflected in the passport, and \u201cJacinto\u201d was the Filipino equivalent of the appellant\u2019s mother\u2019s name.', '15\\u2003As for the incorrect particulars in the Passport, such as the date and place of birth, the appellant said that he had pointed these problems out to \u201cMr Huang\u201d, but \u201cMr Huang\u201d said that the appellant would need to go to the Philippines to reapply for the passport to get them rectified. As the appellant urgently needed to travel, he did not do so.', '16\\u2003According to the Prosecution, the appellant was made a bankrupt in Singapore sometime in 2001, and was discharged from bankruptcy in June 2015. 5', 'During this period, the appellant required the permission of the Official Assignee to travel out of Singapore. However, the appellant had no such permission until 7 September 2012, which was the day of his arrest: GD at [30].', '17\\u2003Based on the records of the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (\u201cICA\u201d), on 28 April 2010, the appellant had submitted an application for a Singapore passport at the Consulate-General of Singapore in Xiamen, China. This application was rejected due to \u201coutstanding issues\u201d with the Insolvency and Public Trustee\u2019s Office and ICA\u2019s Identification Card Unit. 6', 'At this time, the appellant was in possession of a Singapore passport expiring in November 2010. Subsequently, in January 2012, the appellant submitted another application for a Singapore passport. This time, the application was approved. ICA\u2019s records showed that the appellant collected this Singapore passport on 17 February 2012 in person at the Consulate-General of Singapore in Xiamen. 7', 'However, the appellant disputed this, and claimed that his Singapore passport was collected by his agent. He only received this passport sometime in December 2012: GD at [45].', '18\\u2003The Prosecution called the Consul-General of the Philippine Embassy in Singapore, Mr Victorio Mario M Dimagiba Jr (\u201cMr Dimagiba\u201d), as a witness. Mr Dimagiba testified that the Philippine authorities had no record of any passport being issued to a \u201cBoris Jacinto Ngo\u201d under the passport number stated in the Passport. 8', 'In other words, the Passport was false.', '19\\u2003As such, on the Prosecution\u2019s case, the appellant travelled in and out of Singapore using the Passport because he did not have the Official Assignee\u2019s permission to travel until 7 September 2012, and wished to avoid detection: GD at [30]\u2013[31]. However, despite the evidence of Mr Dimagiba, the trial proceeded on the basis that the Passport was a genuine foreign travel document which was not issued to the appellant.', '20\\u2003In the Defence\u2019s closing submissions, it was pointed out for the first time that the actus reus of the s 47(3) charges was not made out: GD at [44]. This was because s 47(3) of the Passports Act did not apply to the use of a false foreign travel document, which is what the Passport was (an issue I discuss in detail at [40]\u2013[42] below). In response, the Prosecution argued that the District Judge ought to amend each of the s 47(6) charges to a charge under s 47(1) of the Passports Act, and convict the appellant accordingly: GD at [47].', '21\\u2003Sections 47(1), (3) and (6) provide:', '22\\u2003The District Judge declined to frame charges under s 47(1) of the Passports Act: GD at [54]. The District Judge explained that s 47(1) required proof that the offender had furnished the false foreign travel document with the intention of dishonestly inducing another person to accept it as though it were genuine, and thereby influenced that person as to the exercise of a public duty. However, none of the ICA officers who dealt with the appellant on the 46 occasions he entered or left Singapore using the Passport was called to testify that they were influenced in this manner.', '23\\u2003Instead, the District Judge amended the s 47(3) charges to the s 47(6) charges. Due to the significance that the reasons given by the District Judge in making the amendments have assumed in these proceedings, I set out the material portions of these remarks (which I shall refer to as \u201cthe amendment remarks\u201d) in full: 9', '24\\u2003Therefore, the District Judge amended each of the s 47(3) charges along the following lines: 10', '25\\u2003At this point, the District Judge also convicted the appellant of the Immigration Act charges. 11', '26\\u2003Following the amendment of the s 47(3) charges to the s 47(6) charges, the appellant\u2019s counsel for the trial applied for the District Judge to recuse herself on the basis that her remarks amounted to prejudging the amended charges: GD at [57]\u2013[58]. The District Judge declined to recuse herself, explaining that she was required to explain why she was satisfied that there was sufficient evidence for her to amend the charges.', '27\\u2003At that juncture, the Prosecution confirmed that it did not intend to recall any witnesses in relation to the s 47(6) charges. The District Judge adjourned the proceedings for a week to allow the Defence to decide whether it wished to recall any witnesses. When the trial resumed, the Defence confirmed that it would recall four Prosecution witnesses, which the District Judge allowed accordingly: GD at [59]. All four witnesses were ICA officers. The appellant did not, however, recall himself to the stand.', '28\\u2003The Defence also applied to call two new witnesses, Huang Yueh Chao and Tsai You Cang: GD at [62]\u2013[63]. I will refer to them as Mr Huang and Mr Tsai respectively, without quotation marks. In short, they were alleged to be the \u201cMr Huang\u201d and \u201cMr Tsai\u201d said to have been involved in the procurement of the Passport (see [12] above). The District Judge dismissed this application, holding that what was crucial was the appellant\u2019s own state of mind, including his knowledge of what Mr Huang and Mr Tsai had done, and this evidence would come from the appellant himself.', '29\\u2003Subsequently, the District Judge convicted the appellant on the s 47(6) charges. She rejected the Defence\u2019s submission that the mentes reae of the s 47(3) charges and the s 47(6) charges were mutually exclusive, since s 47(3) was predicated on the involvement of a genuine foreign travel document, and s 47(6), a false foreign travel document: GD at [75]\u2013[78]. Instead, the District Judge found that the appellant was \u201cwilfully blind to the circumstances under which he obtained [the Passport]\u201d (GD at [76]), since the circumstances under which the appellant had obtained it, as well as the particulars stated on the Passport itself, were both deeply problematic. Also, he had made no checks with the Philippine authorities. The appellant\u2019s mental state was therefore compatible with the mens rea under both the s 47(3) charges as well as the s 47(6) charges. The District Judge also disbelieved the appellant\u2019s claim that he had acquired the Passport under a genuine investment scheme: GD at [80]\u2013[83] and [88]. She found that even if the appellant had believed that he could obtain a genuine Philippine passport in this manner, it would have been clear to him that this was not the case when he actually saw the Passport.', '30\\u2003I note that the Defence had further submitted that in any event, the appellant had a reasonable excuse for using the Passport, which was a defence under s 47(7) to offences under ss 47(2)\u2013(6) of the Passports Act. This was because ICA had wrongly denied him a Singapore passport in 2010, and he therefore had no choice but to use the Passport.', '31\\u2003The District Judge found that the appellant had no reasonable excuse in relation to the s 47(6) charges: GD at [95]\u2013[97]. The appellant did not follow up with the relevant authorities when ICA rejected his passport application in 2010, and he also made no attempt to ask the Singapore authorities for help in travelling out of China, especially since he never told them that his existing Singapore passport had, as he alleged, been taken away from him by the Chinese authorities.', '32\\u2003The District Judge also rejected the Defence\u2019s submission that the appellant\u2019s actus reus could only constitute a single charge under s 47(6), since the offence was one of possession, and his possession of the Passport was continuous. 12', 'She found that there was no evidence to either confirm or deny the appellant\u2019s continuous possession of the Passport. Instead, the evidence related only to his possession of the Passport on each of the 46 occasions: GD at [74].', '33\\u2003In relation to the Immigration Act charges, the District Judge explained that she had convicted the appellant on them as she did not accept his explanation of how the name \u201cNgo Boris Jacinto\u201d came about, and it was undisputed that the remaining details on the disembarkation cards which reflected the particulars of the Passport, as well as the declaration that the appellant had never entered Singapore using a passport under a different name, were also false: GD at [69].', '34\\u2003Following the appellant\u2019s conviction, the Defence submitted that he should be sentenced to a fine in relation to both the s 47(6) charges and the Immigration Act charges: GD at [109]. On the other hand, the Prosecution sought a sentence of eight weeks\u2019 imprisonment for each Immigration Act charge, and 12 months\u2019 imprisonment for each s 47(6) charge. Further, the Prosecution submitted that the sentences for one Immigration Act charge and three s 47(6) charges should run consecutively, for a global sentence of 36 months and eight weeks\u2019 imprisonment: 13', 'GD at [100], [105] and [108].', '35\\u2003The District Judge agreed that the Prosecution\u2019s sentencing position for each charge reflected the usual starting point for the appellant\u2019s respective offences: GD at [111]. She rejected the appellant\u2019s contentions that ICA was to blame for his decision to travel on the Passport, and that there was no public interest or need for general deterrence in his case owing to the fact that he was a Singaporean entitled to enter Singapore: GD at [113] and [116]. The District Judge also rejected the appellant\u2019s contention that his \u201crisk of sudden cardiac death and a sudden onset of stroke\u201d 14', 'justified a reduction in his sentence, because the prison authorities were able to care for diverse medical ailments and there was no specific contention that the appellant was unfit to go to prison: GD at [118].', '36\\u2003However, the District Judge differed from the Prosecution on the appropriate sentences to run consecutively. She ordered two sentences in relation to the s 47(6) charges and two sentences in relation to the Immigration Act charges to run consecutively, for a global sentence of 28 months\u2019 imprisonment.'"}

Profits were not shared between the different areas. 5', 'Avenue 1, where the dispute arose, was the most profitable. The largest number of workers lived in the dormitories in that area. 6', '6\\u2003In late August or early September 2016, Jahidul was slated to leave Singapore. According to Toton, Jahidul initially intended to hand over Avenue 1 to one \u201cFaraque\u201d. Eventually, control of Avenue 1 was given to Shopon, who was in turn to pay Faraque and two men working for him, one \u201cRabbi\u201d and one \u201cBadsha\u201d, a nightly sum. 7', 'Faraque, however, formed a breakaway faction (\u201cthe rival syndicate\u201d) in order to take control of the field at which the sales were conducted at Avenue 1. 8', 'Rahim was a member of this rival syndicate. 9', '7\\u2003Manik reported to and assisted Shopon with cigarette sales at Avenue 1.

Throughout these events, Manik was the only one wearing a cap. 17', '9\\u2003Subsequent to this meeting, a group of them started to make their way to the field at Avenue 1. 18', 'It was not disputed that among these were Rasal, Ripon, Goni, Aziz and Mitho, the latter two being the \u201cAziz\u201d and \u201cMitho\u201d referred to in the charge. For clarity, I should mention that some of the witnesses distinguished between a \u201ctall Mitho\u201d and a \u201cshort Mitho\u201d, and in this context, the Mitho named in the charge was referenced as \u201ctall Mitho\u201d. 19', 'The identity of the \u201cMitho\u201d named in the charge is not at issue in the present case.', '10\\u2003At Avenue 1, Fahad, Mamun, Toton, and Sohel arrived by taxi, stopping inside the carpark of Tuas View Dormitory at Avenue 1. 20', 'Toton approached Rahim, a member of the rival syndicate, and asked Rahim why he was selling cigarettes in the area.

In other words, \nthis was a case in which the first defendant carried out variation works before \nits quotation was approved.156\n123 In cross-examination Mr Ram stated the process for a variation order \nwas that the first defendant would issue a quotation followed by the plaintiff\u2019s \npurchase order.

The first defendant would then carry out the work and \nmark it in a drawing and then get the second defendant to verify the works. Only \nupon verification would the second defendant submit the quotation, which \nwould be followed by a purchase order and then an invoice.158\n124 The plaintiff rebuts this by arguing that the first defendant has merely \nshown that there was a quotation from the plaintiff to Lead, but has not pointed \nto any quotation from the first defendant or a purchase order issued to the first \ndefendant. Additionally, in respect of CVO4, the plaintiff points to Ms Lew\u2019s \nclarification in re-examination that certain facets of the variations were required \n155 Agreed Bundle of Documents, Vol 2, p834.\n156 Notes of Evidence, 23 April 2019, p100(3) to 100(20), p42(5) to 43(23).\n157 Notes of Evidence, 17 April 2019, p73(13) to 73(17).\n158 Notes of Evidence, 17 April 2019, p104(3) to 104(13).\nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nComfort Management Pte Ltd v  [2020] SGHC 165\nOGSP Engineering Pte Ltd\n59to be completed only by 25 March 2015 and thus the quotations issued by the \nplaintiff to Lead on 17 March in fact preceded it.159\n125 At trial, the second defendant was adamant that he did not give any oral \ninstructions to the first defendant to carry out variation works and that he did \nnot consider himself to have any authority to instruct the first defendant to carry \nout variation works.160\n126 I do not accept that the plaintiff waived the condition precedent of an \ninstruction in writing before its liability to pay the first defendant for a variation \nunder cl 11.1 is engaged. While there is some evidence of a high degree of \ninformality in how the parties dealt with variations in performing both parties\u2019 \nobligations under the Comfort Contract, there is no evidence that in respect of \nVO2 specifically, the plaintiff waived the condition precedent of a written \ninstruction, much less in clear and unequivocal terms. That finding is sufficient \nto dispose of the first defendant\u2019s contractual claim on VO2.\nQuantum meruit\n127 My rejection of the first defendant\u2019s contractual claim for VO2 does not \nleave the first defendant without recourse. As the learned author of Law and \nPractice of Construction Contracts states at para 5.019:\nAs a general principle, it is clear that two consequences flow \nfrom an invalid variation order.

{"casename":"2020_SGHC_166","fact":"facts \uf02d specifically: (a) that the Term Sheet had not been signed \nby Mr Kuek and was produced for the first time only late in the day when \nMr Tan was cross-examining Mr Kuek; (b) Mr Kuek\u2019s clear evidence that he \nhad never seen the Term Sheet before; and (c) the fact that Mr Tan never gave \nevidence at all, much less on this specific point and so was not cross-examined \non it \uf02d left us in no doubt that we had to reject Mr Tan\u2019s bare assertion that the \nletters of engagement had been superseded by some other agreement, whether \nin the form of the Term Sheet or otherwise. \n13 We noted that, consistent with this, Mr Eugene Thuraisingam \n(\u201cMr Thuraisingam\u201d), who represented Mr Tan at various stages of the \nproceedings before the Tribunal, conceded before the Tribunal that Mr Kuek \nwould not have invested his monies in the two investment schemes promoted \nby Mr Tan without the assurance that a firm of lawyers, specifically Keystone, \nwould supervise his investments. Mr Thuraisingam went so far as to accept that \nthere was an obligation on Keystone to perform the terms of the engagement, \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLaw Society of Singapore v Tan Chun Chuen Malcolm[2020] SGHC 166\n9although he submitted that its failure to do so was a separate matter altogether. \nIn view of the evidence we have referred to above, these concessions were \nrightly made. It was on the basis of the assurance that Keystone would safeguard \nhis interests that Mr Kuek went ahead and invested in the two investment \nschemes. We were therefore satisfied that Mr Tan was at all times subject to the \nduties incumbent upon him as a solicitor in a solicitor-client relationship with \nMr Kuek. \n14 We turn, in that light, to the substantive charges against Mr Tan. \nThe first charge\n15 The first charge alleged that Mr Tan sought to solicit Mr Kuek\u2019s \nengagement of his and\/or Keystone\u2019s services in respect of the investment sum \nby falsely and fraudulently representing to Mr Kuek that: \n(a) he was qualified and able to promote investment products and \nprovide investment advice in his capacity as an advocate and solicitor \nwith Keystone; and \n(b) his professional indemnity insurance as an advocate and solicitor \npractising with Keystone would assure or guarantee the promised \nreturns in respect of the \u201c12% guaranteed returns investment\u201d scheme \npromoted to Mr Kuek. \n16 The Tribunal held that the representation at [ 15(b)] above but not that at \n[15(a)] above had been proved: see the Decision at [74] and [75]. Before us, the \nLaw Society argued that the evidence showed that both representations had been \nmade by Mr Tan, who must also have known that they were untrue. It submitted \nthat these representations resulted in Mr Kuek entering into the letters of \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLaw Society of Singapore v Tan Chun Chuen Malcolm[2020] SGHC 166\n10engagement with Keystone. On the other hand, Mr Tan claimed that it had not \nbeen shown that the March Statement was made fraudulently, or that it had \ninduced Mr Kuek to invest his monies in the two investment schemes promoted \nto him.\nOur decision\n17 We address the two representations in turn. We agreed with the \nTribunal\u2019s finding that the representation at [ 15(b)] above relating to Mr Tan\u2019s \nprofessional indemnity insurance had been proved beyond reasonable doubt. It \nwas undisputed that when Mr Tan met Mr Kuek in March 2017, Mr Tan had \nbeen introduced to Mr Kuek as a lawyer. Mr Tan subsequently told Mr Kuek \nabout an investment product with 12% guaranteed returns, and on 28 March \n2017, sent Mr Kuek the March Statement (see [ 4] above). \n18 Mr Tan accepted that, \u201cat first blush\u201d, the March Statement \u201clook[ed] \nlike a guarantee of returns\u201d. However, he contended that, read in context, it was \nin fact an attempt to show Mr Kuek that he would be investing his monies with \nlegitimate entities because Mr Tan was a lawyer. He pointed to the second half \nof the March Statement, which made the point that Mr Tan\u2019s business entities \n\u201c[would] be fully [Monetary Authority of Singapore] licensed\u201d and would \ntherefore be legitimate. We did not accept this submission. First, the plain \nlanguage of the March Statement was clear and unambiguous. The reference to \nMr Tan\u2019s professional indemnity insurance was made in answer to the question \n(which was set out within the March Statement itself) of how the profits under \nthe \u201c12% guaranteed returns investment\u201d scheme could be guaranteed. \nNotably, on 18 July 2017, when Mr Kuek asked for Mr Tan\u2019s comments on a \nseparate investment scheme, Mr Tan had responded by saying, amongst other \nthings, that Mr Kuek should \u201cask them how they \u2018guarantee\u2019 [his] investment\u201d. \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLaw Society of Singapore v Tan Chun Chuen Malcolm[2020] SGHC 166\n11This appeared to be an attempt by Mr Tan to demonstrate that investing in the \n\u201c12% guaranteed returns investment\u201d scheme promoted by him would be \npreferable because this scheme carried the additional assurance provided by his \nprofessional indemnity insurance as a lawyer. Second, Mr Kuek stated in his \naffidavit that Mr Tan had also orally told him that his professional indemnity \ninsurance \u201ccould guarantee investment returns\u201d and would also cover any losses \nthat might materialise (see [ 4] above). This affirmed the plain reading of the \nMarch Statement, and as Mr Tan did not give evidence, it was not contradicted. \n19 It is pertinent to note that Mr Tan did not dispute the fact that the March \nStatement, as understood above, was untrue. It was simply inconceivable that \nMr Tan could have honestly believed that the promised 12% investment returns \ncould in any way be guaranteed by his professional indemnity insurance. Faced \nwith this, Mr Tan contended that the March Statement had been made not \nfraudulently, but rather, \u201ccarelessly and imprudently\u201d as \u201can overzealous sale[s] \npitch\u201d. These euphemistic expressions in no way altered the substance of what \nhad transpired, namely, that Mr Tan had lied to Mr Kuek in order to persuade \nhim to do something that was ultimately in Mr Tan\u2019s interests. The reference to \nan \u201coverzealous sale[s] pitch\u201d made it plain that Mr Tan had been trying to \nimpress Mr Kuek by suggesting that the risk of investing with him was low, and \nthat the promised high investment returns were guaranteed because he was a \nlawyer who was covered by professional indemnity insurance. It was also \nevident that the \u201csale[s] pitch\u201d was made in order to induce Mr Kuek to invest \nin the \u201c12% guaranteed returns investment\u201d scheme. As we have noted above, \nMr Kuek\u2019s evidence was that Mr Tan had orally repeated the representation \npertaining to his professional indemnity insurance as well. Given the blatantly \nfalse nature of this representation and the fact that it had been repeated, we had \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLaw Society of Singapore v Tan Chun Chuen Malcolm[2020] SGHC 166\n12no hesitation in concluding that it had been fraudulently made in an effort to \nprocure Mr Kuek\u2019s engagement of Keystone in order to secure his investment. \n20 In our judgment, this was sufficient to establish the first charge, which \nwas made out on the basis of this representation alone. To be clear, while \nMr Tan suggested in his submissions that the Law Society also had to show that \nthis representation in fact induced Mr Kuek to invest his monies with him, this \nwas erroneous and not an element of the first charge. This charge was directed \nat Mr Tan\u2019s conduct in making the false and fraudulent representation, and the \nnature of that conduct did not depend on establishing the effect of the \nrepresentation on Mr Kuek.\n21 Separately, we were also satisfied that Mr Tan had falsely and \nfraudulently represented that he was qualified and able to promote investment \nproducts and provide investment advice in his capacity as an advocate and \nsolicitor with Keystone, which is the representation set out at [ 15(a)] above. In \nthis regard, we respectfully disagreed with the Tribunal\u2019s finding that this \nrepresentation had not been proved beyond reasonable doubt. In our judgment, \nthe question was not whether Mr Tan was or was not in fact in a position to \npromote investment products and provide investment advice as an advocate and \nsolicitor; rather, as we have explained in the previous paragraph, the critical \nissue was what Mr Tan had told Mr Kuek and why. The March Statement \nspecifically referred to Mr Tan\u2019s standing as a \u201cpractising lawyer\u201d and drew a \nclear link between this fact and the purported guarantee that his professional \nindemnity insurance would provide. Further, Mr Kuek testified that Mr Tan had \ntold him that \u201cif anything \u2026 [went] wrong, the insurance [would] help to cover \nthe lawyers\u2019 mistake\u201d. Read together with Mr Tan\u2019s assurance that his \nprofessional indemnity insurance would guarantee the promised investment \nreturns, the implication was that Mr Tan, as an advocate and solicitor, could \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLaw Society of Singapore v Tan Chun Chuen Malcolm[2020] SGHC 166\n13provide the relevant services that would ensure that the investment returns that \nhad been promised to Mr Kuek would be forthcoming. This was the only way \nto make sense of Mr Tan\u2019s unequivocal representation, both in the March \nStatement and orally, that his professional indemnity insurance as a lawyer \ncould be invoked to guarantee the payment of the promised investment returns. \nWe did not understand Mr Tan to be contending that this representation was \ntrue, and we were satisfied that it had been made fraudulently for largely the \nsame reasons as those set out at [ 19] above. \n22 We were therefore satisfied that the first charge was made out not only \nby Mr Tan\u2019s false and fraudulent representation concerning his professional \nindemnity insurance, but also by his false and fraudulent representation that he \nwas qualified and able to provide the relevant services, including investment \nadvice, in his capacity as an advocate and solicitor with Keystone.\n23 We had no difficulty in concluding that due cause had been shown in \nrespect of this charge. Mr Tan had used his standing as an advocate and solicitor \nto make false representations in order to encourage Mr Kuek to invest money \nwith his company and to enter into an engagement with his law firm. The \ndishonesty was both flagrant and an abuse of the trust Mr Kuek had placed in \nhim specifically as an advocate and solicitor. This was fraudulent and grossly \nimproper conduct under s 83(2)(b) of the LPA. \nThe second charge\n24 The second charge preferred by the Law Society alleged that Mr Tan \nhad procured Mr Kuek\u2019s execution of the two letters of engagement under \nimproper and dishonest circumstances, in that Mr Tan: \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLaw Society of Singapore v Tan Chun Chuen Malcolm[2020] SGHC 166\n14(a) did not in fact provide the legal services stipulated in the letters \nof engagement; \n(b) instead provided investment services under the false pretence \nreflected by the letters of engagement; \n(c) procured Mr Kuek to pay the investment sum into Bluesky\u2019s \naccount notwithstanding the fact that the letters of engagement provided \nthat it was to be paid into Keystone\u2019s client account; and \n(d) represented to Mr Kuek and\/or led him to believe that the \ninvestment services provided to him and the payment of the investment \nsum to Bluesky were in accordance with the terms of the letters of \nengagement. \n25 In essence, the allegation in the second charge was that Mr Tan had led \nMr Kuek to understand that Keystone was being engaged to act as trustee of the \ninvestment sum and to supervise Mr Kuek\u2019s investments, despite the fact that \nhe never intended to provide any such services. This, as we understood it, was \nthe \u201cfalse pretence\u201d referred to in the second charge (see [ 24(b)] above). In this \nregard, the Tribunal, despite holding that the second charge had been proved \nbeyond reasonable doubt, also found that \u201c[the] specific allegation that \n[Mr Tan] provided investment services to [Mr Kuek] under the false pretence \nof the letters of engagement\u201d was not made out because Mr Kuek knew that \nKeystone was not providing investment services, and that Mr Tan was likewise \nnot providing such services through Keystone (see the Decision at [79]). With \nrespect, the Tribunal was mistaken in so finding. First, this ruling was premised \non a misreading of the second charge. Second, it was predicated on a view of \nthe facts taken by the Tribunal which we have overturned for the reasons set out \nat [21] above. The central issue in this context was not whether Mr Kuek had a \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLaw Society of Singapore v Tan Chun Chuen Malcolm[2020] SGHC 166\n15precise understanding or belief as to the sort of investment services Keystone \nwould or would not provide. Instead, the real question was what Mr Tan had \nrepresented to Mr Kuek. As we have explained at [ 21] above, this was to the \neffect that Mr Tan, as an advocate and solicitor acting through Keystone, could \nand would provide the relevant services to ensure that the investment returns \nthat had been promised to Mr Kuek would be forthcoming. This was precisely \nthe false pretence that was encompassed in the elaborate hoax constituted by the \nletters of engagement and the Warrants to Act.\n26 The Law Society emphasised Mr Kuek\u2019s evidence that he would not \nhave invested in the two investment schemes promoted to him by Mr Tan if he \nhad known that his monies could and would be used by Mr Tan without any \nsupervision by a law firm, namely, Keystone. It argued that this was why \nMr Tan had framed the terms of agreement between Mr Kuek and Keystone as \nstandard engagement letters. Having gained Mr Kuek\u2019s trust in the arrangement, \nMr Tan then procured him to pay the investment sum to Bluesky, contrary to \nwhat was provided for in the letters of engagement. In contrast, Mr Tan argued \nthat the letters of engagement were not signed under false pretences since \nMr Kuek had known that he was making an investment directly with Bluesky, \nwhich had issued him a payment voucher. The addition of Keystone, Mr Tan \nsubmitted, \u201cadded nothing\u201d, and Mr Kuek had known that his investments \nwould be subject to the normal attendant risks of investing. Mr Tan also asserted \nthat deliberate deceit had not been proved. \nOur decision\n27 We were satisfied that the second charge was amply made out. The terms \nof the letters of engagement clearly indicated that Keystone was being engaged \nto supervise Mr Kuek\u2019s investments, among other duties. Indeed, this was \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLaw Society of Singapore v Tan Chun Chuen Malcolm[2020] SGHC 166\n16Mr Kuek\u2019s understanding, as he testified that he would not have invested his \nmonies in the two investment schemes promoted by Mr Tan if he had known \nthat the monies could and would be used without any supervision by a law firm. \nAs we have already noted above (at [ 13]), Mr Tan\u2019s previous counsel, \nMr Thuraisingam, also conceded as much, and, as we have observed, we \nthought this concession was rightly made. This was the very reason the letters \nof engagement were signed. And, for the reasons explained at [ 12] above, we \nrejected Mr Tan\u2019s submission that the letters of engagement had been \nsuperseded by the Term Sheet. It followed from this that Keystone had a \nprofessional and fiduciary duty to act in Mr Kuek\u2019s interests, including to ensure \nthat his investments were subject to the protections Keystone had been engaged \nto provide. \n28 It was common ground that, in spite of this, the legal services stipulated \nin the letters of engagement were not provided. In fact, the evidence showed \nthat Mr Tan had never intended to provide those services. For instance, the \nletters of engagement provided that the investment sum was to be paid into \nKeystone\u2019s client account and that Keystone would act as trustee of the monies \ninvested by Mr Kuek. Despite these clear provisions, Mr Tan instead procured \nthe payment of the investment sum to Bluesky on 28 August 2017, which was \nthe same day on which the letters of engagement were signed. Further, while \nthe letters of engagement provided that Mr Tan, on behalf of Keystone, was to \nsupervise Mr Kuek\u2019s investments, it was unclear how Mr Tan could seriously \nhave intended to supervise investments made by his client in his own private \ncompany. Indeed, it was plain on the evidence that Mr Tan never intended to \ncomply with the terms of the letters of engagement from the outset. \n29 This, in fact, was in line with Mr Tan\u2019s own position, which was that the \nletters of engagement had been superseded by the Term Sheet (which argument \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLaw Society of Singapore v Tan Chun Chuen Malcolm[2020] SGHC 166\n17we rejected at [ 12] above), and, further, that these letters had been signed despite \nthe fact that the parties had at that time already begun to discuss alternative \nmodes of investing Mr Kuek\u2019s monies. He asserted that it was Mr Kuek who \nhad nevertheless insisted on signing the letters of engagement as they were \u201cat \nthe time, the only legal documents which had been prepared\u201d. This submission \nsuggested that, even as at 28 August 2017, Mr Tan did not intend to carry out \nor act in accordance with the terms of the letters of engagement. We also found \nit significant that these letters stated that while Mr Tan would normally charge \nan hourly rate for his services, no time-based costs would be charged in this \ninstance because the \u201cInvestment Company\u201d (meaning, according to Mr Tan, \nBluesky) would cover his fees. This again suggested that the letters of \nengagement served no real purpose, at least from Mr Tan\u2019s perspective, other \nthan to convince Mr Kuek that his investments would be supervised by a law \nfirm and that the profits promised under the \u201c12% guaranteed returns \ninvestment\u201d scheme would be protected by Mr Tan\u2019s professional indemnity \ninsurance as a lawyer, when Mr Tan knew this was all untrue. In short, as we \nhave noted at [ 25] above, this was all part of an elaborate hoax to convince \nMr Kuek that he was protected by the device of having engaged Keystone to \nsupervise his investments, which Mr Tan knew not to be the case at all. \n30 Mr Tan made much of the fact that Mr Kuek had issued the cheque for \nthe investment sum to Bluesky. The suggestion was that there had been no \ndishonesty since this showed that Mr Kuek knew that he was investing that sum \ndirectly with Bluesky and that Keystone would not be acting as trustee of that \nsum. This, with respect, was misguided. While Mr Kuek had issued the cheque \nfor the investment sum to Bluesky, he had done so after being assured by \nMr Tan that this would be \u201cthe same\u201d as issuing the cheque to Keystone (see \n[6] above). In addition, Mr Kuek\u2019s knowledge that the investment sum was \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLaw Society of Singapore v Tan Chun Chuen Malcolm[2020] SGHC 166\n18being paid to Bluesky directly had to be seen in the light of the fact that what \nwas material to him was his belief that Keystone would be supervising his \ninvestments. However, Keystone\u2019s supervision, or rather, the lack thereof, was \nalso the key fact as to which he was being deceived by Mr Tan. In this regard, \nwe reiterate Mr Kuek\u2019s evidence that he would not have invested his monies in \nthe two investment schemes promoted by Mr Tan at all, and, by extension, \nwould not have made any payment to Bluesky, but for the assurance of \nKeystone\u2019s supervision of his investments. We also reiterate \nMr Thuraisingam\u2019s acceptance of this fact. \n31 Further, there were other falsehoods operating at the material time. For \ninstance, the evidence suggested that Mr Tan had also represented to Mr Kuek \nthat the investment company, Bluesky, would soon be licensed by the Monetary \nAuthority of Singapore (\u201cMAS\u201d). As mentioned at [ 4] above, he had said in the \nMarch Statement that:\n\u2026 We are also coming under a Monetary Authority of Singapore \ncms [Capital Markets Services] licence very soon, as we are now \nnegotiating with some external asset management companies \nand will be fully mas [Monetary Authority of Singapore] \nlicensed.\nThe parties appeared to agree that this was a representation that Mr Tan\u2019s \nbusiness entities would soon qualify for a licence issued by the MAS. It seemed \nto us that the relevant business entity must have been Bluesky, since there was \nno other entity Mr Tan could have been referring to. However, there was no \nevidence that Bluesky was at any time licensed, or going to be licensed, by the \nMAS, and Mr Tan did not contend otherwise. This was something that Mr Tan \nmust have known at the time the letters of engagement were signed. Yet, there \nwas no evidence that this had been disclosed to Mr Kuek. Moreover, while \nMr Tan asserted that Pilgrim Partners Asia (\u201cPilgrim\u201d), the entity involved in \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLaw Society of Singapore v Tan Chun Chuen Malcolm[2020] SGHC 166\n19the \u201c[f]ull sum non guaranteed\u201d investment scheme (see [ 5] above), had been \nlicensed by the MAS, he did not dispute the fact that no investments were ever \nmade with Pilgrim, contrary to the terms of the letter of engagement pertaining \nto that scheme. Instead, he suggested in his cross-examination of Mr Kuek that \nMr Kuek had been told \u201cin the course of signing the [letters of engagement]\u201d \nthat the investment product with Pilgrim had not yet been confirmed, and that \nthe sum earmarked for investment with Pilgrim would instead be going into \nBluesky. Even if this were true, it would not be material unless it was brought \nhome to Mr Kuek that: (a) his money was not going to be invested in an entity \nlicensed by the MAS; and (b) his investments would not be supervised by a law \nfirm. It was clear that this had not been done. In addition, this also underscored \nMr Tan\u2019s lack of intention to comply with the terms of the letters of \nengagement.\n32 In sum, the evidence showed that Mr Tan had procured Mr Kuek to sign \nthe letters of engagement on the false pretext that Keystone would supervise his \ninvestments. This was dishonest and improper since Mr Tan had never intended \nfor there to have been any such supervision. In line with this, Mr Tan had asked \nMr Kuek to pay the investment sum directly to Bluesky, contrary to the terms \nof the letters of engagement, and had falsely assured him that this was in effect \nthe same as paying the money to Keystone. This was aggravated by the fact that \nMr Tan did not inform Mr Kuek that, contrary to his earlier representations, \nBluesky was not licensed by the MAS, and there was no way for Keystone to \nguarantee the promised 12% profits or make good any losses resulting from the \ninvestments. We therefore concluded that the second charge was made out as \nwell. It was evident that Mr Tan\u2019s conduct amply met the threshold for \nfraudulent and grossly improper conduct under s 83(2)(b) of the LPA because \nhis dishonesty was targeted at obtaining Mr Kuek\u2019s engagement of Keystone so \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLaw Society of Singapore v Tan Chun Chuen Malcolm[2020] SGHC 166\n20as to give him the false assurance that his investments would thereby be \nprotected.\nThe fifth charge\n33 The fifth charge alleged that Mr Tan, in procuring and\/or instructing \nMr Kuek to pay the investment sum to Bluesky, had placed himself in a position \nwhere his duty to serve Mr Kuek\u2019s best interests was in conflict with his own \ninterests. This charge further alleged that notwithstanding the conflict, Mr Tan: \n(a) failed to make full and frank disclosure of his interest in the matter to \nMr Kuek; (b) failed to advise Mr Kuek to obtain independent legal advice or, \nalternatively, to ensure that Mr Kuek was not under the impression that he was \nprotecting Mr Kuek\u2019s best interests; and, finally, (c) failed to obtain Mr Kuek\u2019s \ninformed consent in writing for him to continue acting as Mr Kuek\u2019s solicitor \ndespite the conflict. \n34 The Tribunal found that Mr Tan\u2019s conflict of interest in acting for \nMr Kuek and his failure to advise the latter to obtain independent legal advice \nwere clearly established by the evidence: see the Decision at [83] and [85]. This \nwas despite its finding that Mr Tan had not failed to make full and frank \ndisclosure of his interest in the matter. On this particular point, the Tribunal \nreasoned that because Mr Kuek had been aware that Bluesky was Mr Tan\u2019s \ncompany, it was not clear what other disclosure was required: see the Decision \nat [84]. \n35 The Law Society submitted that while Mr Kuek might have known of \nMr Tan\u2019s interest in Bluesky, Mr Tan had not fully explained to him the extent \nand implications of the conflict of interest, or that Mr Tan was effectively being \nengaged to supervise investments managed by his own company. Rather than \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLaw Society of Singapore v Tan Chun Chuen Malcolm[2020] SGHC 166\n21advising Mr Kuek to seek independent legal advice, Mr Tan had instead assured \nhim that he could safely invest in the two investment schemes promoted to him \nbecause \u201cif anything \u2026 [went] wrong, the insurance [would] help to cover the \nlawyers\u2019 mistake\u201d (see [ 21] above). There was therefore no informed consent \nby Mr Kuek to Mr Tan\u2019s continuing to act as his solicitor.\n36 In rebuttal, Mr Tan made two submissions. The first was that it was \nnecessary to establish with precision the relationships which were said to have \ngiven rise to the conflict of interest, although he stopped short of submitting that \nthere was no situation of conflict in the present case. Second, he observed that \nsince Mr Kuek had been advised by another solicitor in respect of the letters of \nengagement, any breach would have been limited to his failure to obtain \nMr Kuek\u2019s written consent for him to continue acting for Mr Kuek.  \nOur decision\n37 In Law Society of Singapore v Ezekiel Peter Latimer [2019] 4 SLR 1427 \n(\u201cEzekiel Peter Latimer\u201d) at [60] and [63], we held that cases involving a \nsolicitor who preferred his own interests over those of his client would \npresumptively involve more serious misconduct, since a solicitor who prefers \nhis own interests inevitably abuses the trust and confidence reposed in him. We \nfurther noted in Ezekiel Peter Latimer that an abuse of trust may occur where a \nsolicitor enters into a transaction with his client on terms that may be more \nfavourable to the solicitor\u2019s own interests (at [63]). This aptly described the \npresent case. \n38 The conflict of interest in the present case can be readily perceived from \nthe facts we have already outlined above. Indeed, Mr Thio Shen Yi SC, who \nappeared on behalf of Mr Tan in the proceedings before us, accepted at the oral \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLaw Society of Singapore v Tan Chun Chuen Malcolm[2020] SGHC 166\n22hearing that once the first two charges were made out, it followed that the fifth \ncharge would also necessarily be made out. Mr Tan\u2019s interest lay in procuring \nMr Kuek to invest his monies with Bluesky, which he achieved by making a \nnumber of false and fraudulent representations, most significantly, that \nKeystone would supervise Mr Kuek\u2019s investments, and that if anything went \nwrong, Mr Tan, the designated solicitor in charge under the two letters of \nengagement, could be sued under the cover of his professional indemnity \ninsurance. This was therefore a case in which Mr Tan convinced Mr Kuek, his \nclient, to enter into a transaction which furthered Mr Tan\u2019s own interests under \nfalse pretences. In doing so, Mr Tan preferred his own interest, which was \nultimately to procure Mr Kuek to invest his monies with Bluesky through the \nfalse assurances made in connection with the role and involvement of Keystone, \nover that of Mr Kuek, which was to have his investments safeguarded in \naccordance with the assurances that had been given to him. Consistent with our \nobservations in Ezekiel Peter Latimer, we were satisfied that the present case \ninvolved a very serious conflict of interest and an abuse of trust. \n39 It was incumbent on Mr Tan to take steps to obviate the conflict, if that \ncould even be done in this situation. Rule 22(3) of the Legal Profession \n(Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 (S 706\/2015) (\u201cPCR\u201d) provides that:\nWhere a legal practitioner, any immediate family member of the \nlegal practitioner, or the law practice in which the legal \npractitioner practises has an interest in any matter entrusted \nto the legal practitioner by a client of the legal practitioner \u2014\n(a) in any case where the interest is adverse to the \nclient\u2019s interests, the legal practitioner must withdraw \nfrom representing the client, unless \u2014\n(i) the legal practitioner makes a full and frank \ndisclosure of the adverse interest to the client;\n(ii) the legal practitioner advises the client to \nobtain independent legal advice;\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLaw Society of Singapore v Tan Chun Chuen Malcolm[2020] SGHC 166\n23(iii) if the client does not obtain independent legal \nadvice, the legal practitioner ensures that the \nclient is not under an impression that the legal \npractitioner is protecting the client\u2019s interests; \nand\n(iv) despite sub\u2011paragraphs (i) and (ii), the client \ngives the client\u2019s informed consent in writing to \nthe legal practitioner acting, or continuing to act, \non the client\u2019s behalf \u2026\n\u2026\n40 The requirement of full and frank disclosure seeks to ensure that: (a) the \nclient is apprised of the nature, extent and implications of the conflict of interest \nsuch that a decision as to whether or not to obtain independent legal advice can \nbe made; and (b) if such legal advice is not sought, the client is not under the \nimpression that the legal practitioner is protecting the client\u2019s interests. In this \nconnection, we emphasise also that whether independent legal advice has been \nsought cannot be viewed in a technical manner \u2013 instead, the crux of the matter \nis whether the client has been placed in a position to assess whether he should \nallow the conflicted solicitor to continue acting for him. In this regard, Mr Tan \nplaced emphasis on the fact that Mr Kuek had given the letters of engagement \nto a \u201clawyer friend\u201d over a meal and had been told that they were \u201ccommon and \ngeneral terms of engagement\u201d. With respect, this struck us as woefully \ninadequate, and we were dismayed by Mr Tan\u2019s submission that this could in \nany way constitute adequate independent legal advice. In truth, this in no way \naddressed Mr Tan\u2019s conflicted position.\n41 Mr Tan was squarely under an obligation to ensure that Mr Kuek was \nnot under the impression that his interests were being protected by Mr Tan. That \nimpression had been intentionally created by Mr Tan, and it was simply untrue, \nas he well knew. Yet, he wholly failed to apprise Mr Kuek of this fact, precisely \nbecause he was placed in a position of acute conflict between his own interest, \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLaw Society of Singapore v Tan Chun Chuen Malcolm[2020] SGHC 166\n24which was to get Mr Kuek to invest his monies with Bluesky and which, in turn, \ndepended on Mr Kuek believing the false assurances he had been given, and his \nduty to safeguard Mr Kuek\u2019s interests. The mere fact that Mr Kuek knew that \nBluesky was Mr Tan\u2019s company was beside the point. Rather, it was critical for \nMr Tan to disclose the fact that Keystone would not supervise Mr Kuek\u2019s \ninvestments since this was the matter of central importance to Mr Kuek. As we \nhave repeatedly emphasised above, this was the basis on which Mr Kuek had \nagreed to invest his money in the two investment schemes promoted by Mr Tan. \nThe false expectation of Keystone\u2019s supervision also lay at the heart of the \nconflict of interest in the present case since this was the means by which Mr Tan \nconvinced Mr Kuek to invest his money in those two investment schemes (see \n[38] above). Where the very premise on which Mr Kuek had agreed to invest in \nthose two investment schemes was false and not corrected, there could be no \nconceivable argument that Mr Tan had adequately disclosed his conflict of \ninterest to Mr Kuek. We therefore disagreed with the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion to \nthe contrary: see the Decision at [84]. With respect, this conflict was so \nfundamental that we found it difficult to see how it could have been resolved at \nall.\n42 It was clear beyond peradventure that due cause was made out in respect \nof the fifth charge. We held in Ezekiel Peter Latimer ([ 37] supra) at [48] that \nmisconduct arising from a conflict of interest is reprehensible because it entails \n\u201ca grievous violation of a lawyer\u2019s duty of unflinching and undivided loyalty to \na client\u201d. We also held that striking off is the presumptive penalty in cases where \na solicitor personally transacts with a client to his own advantage, or in any \nmanner places himself in a situation where his personal interest conflicts with \nthat of a client, unless truly exceptional circumstances exist which render \nstriking off disproportionate (at [67]). An example where a solicitor was struck \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLaw Society of Singapore v Tan Chun Chuen Malcolm[2020] SGHC 166\n25off for misconduct involving a conflict of interest is Law Society of Singapore \nv Khushvinder Singh Chopra [1998] 3 SLR(R) 490 (\u201cKhushvinder Singh \nChopra\u201d). There, the respondent solicitor had been engaged to act for the \nvendors in an unsuccessful re-mortgage and aborted sale of their property. The \nrespondent subsequently negotiated and obtained an option to purchase the \nproperty from two of the vendors on terms that were less favourable to them \nthan the option that would have been granted under the aborted sale. The \nvendors\u2019 new solicitors wrote to the respondent disputing the validity of the \noption granted and demanding that the caveat lodged by the respondent be \nwithdrawn. A complaint was subsequently filed with the Law Society. \nNotwithstanding his knowledge of at least one vendor\u2019s unwillingness to \nproceed with the sale, the respondent persuaded the vendors to sign a statutory \ndeclaration which upheld the option he had been granted, and which purported \nto absolve him of all allegations of fraud and impropriety. The court there held \nthat there was no alternative but to strike the respondent off the roll since he had \nknowingly placed himself in a position of \u201caggravated conflict of interest\u201d, \n\u201csingle-mindedly pursued and preferred his interest over [that] of his clients\u201d \nand behaved in a \u201ccunning and deceitful\u201d manner. The court also observed that \n\u201cconsiderations of public interest generally, and the interest of the \nadministration of justice in particular\u201d were engaged (at [67]). \n43 In the present case, it was no overstatement to describe Mr Tan as having \nbeen single-minded in his pursuit of his own interests over those of Mr Kuek, \nor to say that he had been deceitful in doing so. He procured Mr Kuek to enter \ninto a solicitor-client relationship with him under false pretences in order to \nfurther his own financial interests over those of Mr Kuek, without having any \nintention of providing the services stipulated in the letters of engagement. We \nnoted that not only were there no exceptional circumstances in the present case, \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLaw Society of Singapore v Tan Chun Chuen Malcolm[2020] SGHC 166\n26the evidence also suggested that, upon learning of the complaint that Mr Kuek \nhad filed against him, Mr Tan tried to make its withdrawal a condition of his \nrepaying part of the investment sum to Mr Kuek. In this context, it was apparent \nthat Mr Tan\u2019s conduct as set out in the fifth charge not only contravened rr 22(1) \nto 22(3) of the PCR and constituted improper conduct as an advocate and \nsolicitor under s 83(2)(b) of the LPA, but also, on its own, merited striking off. \nWe return to this point momentarily.  \nThe remaining charges\n44 The effect of our findings above was that Mr Tan had procured \nMr Kuek\u2019s execution of the letters of engagement on the false pretext that \nKeystone would be supervising Mr Kuek\u2019s investments, which assured \nMr Kuek that the promised 12% investment returns could be regarded as \nguaranteed since, so he had been told, Mr Tan\u2019s professional indemnity \ninsurance would cover any failure to pay the promised returns as well as any \nlosses that might materialise. We have found also that this was a fraudulent \npretext, in that Mr Tan never intended to provide any of the services stipulated \nin the letters of engagement. This was in fact the premise of the first, second \nand fifth charges, as well as the Law Society\u2019s position. \n45 Having accepted these points, the Law Society could not, with respect, \npossibly sustain the third and fourth charges. The third and fourth charges \nessentially alleged that, in the course of advising and\/or acting on behalf of \nMr Kuek pursuant to the letters of engagement, Mr Tan: (a) failed to keep \nMr Kuek reasonably informed of the progress of his matters and to provide \nsatisfactory responses and\/or updates despite his queries (the third charge); and \n(b) failed to keep contemporaneous records of instructions received from and \nadvice rendered to Mr Kuek (the fourth charge). In our judgment, it was \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLaw Society of Singapore v Tan Chun Chuen Malcolm[2020] SGHC 166\n27incorrect to charge Mr Tan both for fraudulently representing that he would act \nas Mr Kuek\u2019s lawyer despite having no intention to do so, and at the same time \nfor failing to perform the particular duties which he would have been obliged to \nperform in the course of the very engagement that he never intended to carry \nout. The fact that Mr Tan never kept contemporaneous attendance notes nor kept \nMr Kuek reasonably informed of the progress of his matters was simply a \nconsequence of the fact that the solicitor-client relationship had been entered \ninto on a fraudulent basis, with Mr Tan having had no intention to act as \nMr Kuek\u2019s lawyer. The latter fact is a central feature of the first, second and \nfifth charges. It was therefore inconsistent for the Law Society to prefer those \ncharges and simultaneously bring separate charges (that is to say, the third and \nfourth charges) on the premise that Mr Tan was nevertheless expected to \nperform the duties that he would have been required to perform as Mr Kuek\u2019s \nlawyer. We therefore set aside Mr Tan\u2019s conviction on the third and fourth \ncharges. \nThe appropriate sanction\n46 We have said above (at [ 43]) that Mr Tan\u2019s conduct as set out in the fifth \ncharge alone warranted striking him off the roll. We add that the first and second \ncharges, which were closely tied to the fifth charge, also provided ample basis \nto conclude that striking off was the appropriate sanction.\n47 In Law Society of Singapore v Chia Choon Yang [2018] 5 SLR 1068 \n(\u201cChia Choon Yang\u201d) at [39] and [40], we set out the following framework for \ndetermining the appropriate sanction in cases of misconduct involving \ndishonesty:\n39 In summary, misconduct involving dishonesty will \nalmost invariably warrant an order for striking off where the \ndishonesty reveals a character defect rendering the errant \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLaw Society of Singapore v Tan Chun Chuen Malcolm[2020] SGHC 166\n28solicitor unsuitable for the profession, or undermines the \nadministration of justice. This would typically be the case \n(a) where the dishonesty is integral to the commission of a \ncriminal offence of which the solicitor has been convicted; \n(b) where the dishonesty violates the relationship of trust and \nconfidence inherent in a solicitor-client relationship; and \n(c) where the dishonesty leads to a breach of the solicitor\u2019s duty \nto the court or otherwise impedes the administration of justice. \nIn such cases, striking off will be the presumptive penalty \nunless there are truly exceptional facts to show that a striking \noff would be disproportionate. As we have noted in [Law Society \nof Singapore v Ong Cheong Wei [2018] 3 SLR 937] at [7], such a \ncase will be \u201cextremely rare\u201d. And as [Law Society of Singapore \nv Choy Chee Yean [2010] 3 SLR 560] shows, personal \nculpability (as well as mitigating factors generally) has little \nrelevance in cases where the presumptive position of striking \noff applies, save that the court might entertain an application \nfor reinstatement earlier than would otherwise be the case.\n40 But for cases that do not fall into these categories, the \ncourt should examine the facts closely to determine whether \nstriking off is warranted. In particular, it should ascertain:\n(a) the real nature of the wrong and the interest that has \nbeen implicated;\n(b) the extent and nature of the deception;\n(c) the motivations and reasons behind the dishonesty \nand whether it indicates a fundamental lack of integrity \non the one hand or a case of misjudgment on the other;\n(d) whether the errant solicitor benefited from the \ndishonesty; and\n(e) whether the dishonesty caused actual harm or had \nthe potential to cause harm that the errant solicitor \nought to have or in fact recognised.\n[emphasis added]\n48 In our judgment, the present case is one in which the presumptive \nsanction is that of striking off. The first, second and fifth charges all involved \ndishonesty that violated the relationship of trust and confidence that inheres in \nthe solicitor-client relationship: see Chia Choon Yang at [39]. As we have \nemphasised above, this was a case in which Mr Tan acted dishonestly in \nfavouring his own interests over those of Mr Kuek. Specifically, Mr Tan \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLaw Society of Singapore v Tan Chun Chuen Malcolm[2020] SGHC 166\n29procured Mr Kuek\u2019s engagement of Keystone\u2019s services (and, in turn, his \nservices as the designated solicitor in charge under the two letters of \nengagement) by making representations that created false expectations as to \nwhat assurances the solicitor-client relationship could provide, going so far as \nto claim that his professional indemnity insurance could guarantee Mr Kuek\u2019s \ninvestment returns as well as cover any losses that might materialise. These \nrepresentations were directly tied to his standing as an advocate and solicitor, \nand his dishonesty was exacerbated by the fact that he constructed an elaborate \nhoax using the letters of engagement and the Warrants to Act as a pretext to \nsecure payment of the investment sum into the account of a company that he \ncontrolled. As such, given the absence of any truly exceptional facts, the \nappropriate penalty was that of striking off. \n49 To be clear, even if we applied the factors set out in Chia Choon Yang \nat [40], the test for striking out would still be amply met. In Chia Choon Yang \nat [31], we observed that cases such as John Irvine Burrowes v Law Society \n[2002] EWHC 2900 (Admin) and Fraser v The Council of the Law Society of \nNew South Wales [1992] NSWCA 72, where the sanction of striking off was \nnot imposed, involved dishonest acts that were done in the belief that they were \nwhat the clients wanted, and that the acts \u201cappeared to be driven by what was \nthought to be a harmless pursuit of convenience\u201d. Those were not cases in which \nthe solicitors concerned had acted in total disregard of their clients\u2019 interests or \nbenefited from their own misconduct. Similarly, we observed that in Law \nSociety of Singapore v Chung Ting Fai [2006] 4 SLR(R) 587, where the errant \nsolicitor had been found guilty of drafting a false affidavit, the court, in ordering \nthe solicitor to be suspended from practice for one year instead of striking him \noff the roll, had been satisfied that he had not been acting in flagrant pursuit of \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLaw Society of Singapore v Tan Chun Chuen Malcolm[2020] SGHC 166\n30his self-interest at the expense of his client, but had instead been motivated by \n\u201cmisplaced zealousness\u201d (see Chia Choon Yang at [36]). \n50 The present case was wholly distinguishable. Mr Tan had, in blatant \ndisregard of Mr Kuek\u2019s interests, fraudulently procured Mr Kuek\u2019s engagement \nof Keystone in order to secure Mr Kuek\u2019s investment of his monies with \nBluesky, an act which was, from start to finish, intended by Mr Tan to benefit \nhimself. The patent falsehoods which underpinned the first, second and fifth \ncharges clearly evinced a fundamental lack of integrity, as opposed to mere \nmisjudgement. \n51 One of the factors identified in Chia Choon Yang at [40] was \u201cwhether \nthe dishonesty caused actual harm or had the potential to cause harm that the \nerrant solicitor ought to have or in fact recognised\u201d. In this regard, we noted that \nMr Tan attempted to rely on a settlement agreement reached on 7 June 2020 \n(\u201cthe settlement agreement\u201d), which he argued was mitigating. Amongst other \nthings, the settlement agreement provided that Mr Kuek would be repaid a sum \nof $122,000, which was the remaining portion of the investment sum after \ntaking into account a sum of $125,000 repaid by Mr Tan on the eve of the \nproceedings before the Tribunal and a further $3,000 paid to Mr Kuek by one \nMr Gabriel Loo, who was the person who had introduced Mr Kuek to Mr Tan. \nWhile such repayment would have reduced any harm that might have been \nsuffered by Mr Kuek as a result of the hoax perpetrated by Mr Tan, we \nconsidered that this was not in fact mitigating, nor did it suggest that striking \noff would be disproportionate. To the contrary, we would have considered any \nharm that Mr Kuek in fact suffered to be aggravating (see Ezekiel Peter Latimer \n([37] supra) at [56]; see also Law Society of Singapore v Yap Bock Heng \nChristopher [2014] 4 SLR 877 at [30] in the context of prohibited borrowing \ntransactions). This is consistent with the fact that one of the key functions of \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLaw Society of Singapore v Tan Chun Chuen Malcolm[2020] SGHC 166\n31disciplinary sanctions under s 83 of the LPA is to uphold public confidence in \nthe administration of justice and in the integrity of the legal profession. This \nwas a consideration that was squarely engaged by Mr Tan\u2019s deceitful conduct, \nand striking off could not be said to be disproportionate by any measure.\n52 For completeness, we note that Mr Tan relied on the settlement \nagreement to argue that the complaint against him had not been made in good \nfaith. In the alternative, he argued that his efforts in making amends to Mr Kuek \nand the fact that he and Mr Kuek continue to have a good relationship were at \nleast mitigating. These efforts by Mr Tan to settle the matter with Mr Kuek and \nhis repayment of half of the investment sum to Mr Kuek (see [ 51] above), which \ntook place shortly before the relevant hearings, might reduce his personal \nculpability in any criminal proceedings that might ensue. However, as we \nindicated in Chia Choon Yang at [39], personal culpability and mitigating \ncircumstances have little relevance in the context of disciplinary proceedings \nconcerning dishonesty, particularly in cases where striking off is the \npresumptive penalty (see also Law Society of Singapore v Ravi s\/o Madasamy \n[2016] 5 SLR 1141 at [54] and [67]). The need to protect the public and uphold \npublic confidence in the legal profession were the predominant considerations \nin the present case, and none of the factors raised by Mr Tan in any way \npersuaded us that he had the requisite character and trustworthiness to remain \non the roll. \nConclusion\n53 For these reasons, we held that the only appropriate sanction in the \npresent case would be for Mr Tan to be struck off the roll under s 83(1)(a) of \nthe LPA, and we ordered accordingly. In addition, Mr Tan was ordered to bear \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLaw Society of Singapore v Tan Chun Chuen Malcolm[2020] SGHC 166\n32the costs of the proceedings before this court and the Tribunal, which we fixed \nin the aggregate amount of $25,000.\n54 Given the gravity of the allegations against Mr Tan, we will also refer \nthe matter to the Public Prosecutor to consider whether any criminal charges \nought to be brought against Mr Tan. \nCoda on business transactions between solicitors and their clients\n55 The present case exemplifies the difficulties that are prone to arise when \na solicitor transacts with a client both as a solicitor and in some other capacity. \nWhile the PCR identifies examples of conduct which would generally be \nincompatible with a solicitor\u2019s obligation as a fiduciary to advance his client\u2019s \nbest interests unaffected by those of his own (for instance, prohibited borrowing \ntransactions or the receipt of gifts from clients), these are by no means \nexhaustive of the sorts of conduct which solicitors should avoid engaging in \nwith their clients. Rather, we consider that, as a general rule, it is inadvisable \nfor solicitors to enter into business transactions with their clients since this will \noften have a real potential to give rise to a conflict of interest. In Khushvinder \nSingh Chopra ([ 42] supra) at [34], the High Court referred to the following \nobservations of Street CJ in Law Society of New South Wales v Harvey [1976] \n2 NSWLR 154 at 171B:\nA conflict of interest which is avoidable, and ought to be \navoided, is that which arises from a deliberate proposal of \nthe solicitor that his client deal with him. If, for example, a \nclient seeks aid or advice from a solicitor concerning lending or \nborrowing, or the acquisition or disposal or dealing with assets, \nthe solicitor will disregard his primary duty as a solicitor \nreferred to so trenchantly by Lord Westbury [in Timothy \nTyrrell v The Bank of London and Sir J V Shelley and \nOthers (1862) 11 ER 934], if he uses the occasion to become \nthe party who deals with his client. It can make no difference \nif he is not a party directly, but the transaction is with a \ncompany in which he has an interest. Even the tender of advice \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLaw Society of Singapore v Tan Chun Chuen Malcolm[2020] SGHC 166\n33to his client to have independent legal advice, although of \nimportance, does not really overcome the objection to the \nsolicitor having proposed, invited or encouraged the client to \ndeal with him or his company in the proposed transaction. \u2026 \nIn the absence of very special circumstances, a solicitor who \npromotes himself as the dealer with his client misuses his \nposition \u2026 The price of being a member of an honourable \nprofession, whose duty to his client ought not to be prejudiced in \nany degree, is that a solicitor is denied the freedom to take the \nbenefit of any opportunity to deal with persons whom he has \naccepted as clients. Therefore he ought neither to promote, \nsuggest, nor encourage a client to deal with him, but rather \nshould take all reasonable steps positively to avoid dealing \ndirectly, or indirectly, with his client. There are of course \nexceptional cases where the transaction may be in the special \ninterest of a particular client, but such cases will be isolated \nand need to be dealt with conscientious regard for the \nprocedures referred to. [High Court\u2019s emphasis in Khushvinder \nSingh Chopra in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]\n56 The court then held that \u201cin general, a solicitor ought not to put himself \nforward as a prospective principal to deal with his client\u201d (see Khushvinder \nSingh Chopra at [39]). The court observed that while this was not an absolute \nrule, the most appropriate action for a solicitor to take if he nonetheless wished \nto transact with a client would be to discharge himself and advise the client to \nappoint new solicitors, or, at the very least, ensure that the client had the benefit \nof truly independent legal advice (likewise at [39]). While the observations we \nhave reproduced above were made in the context of a solicitor who had procured \nan option from his existing clients to purchase their property (see [ 42] above), \nthe same reasoning will apply where a solicitor consummates a solicitor-client \nrelationship with an individual with whom he intends to transact in a different \ncapacity. This highlights the real danger that lurks where the solicitor-client \nrelationship is intended to facilitate the latter transaction, as in the present case. \n57 Similar, although perhaps less culpable, circumstances featured in Ohm \nPacific Sdn Bhd v Ng Hwee Cheng Doreen [1994] 2 SLR(R) 633. The \nrespondent solicitor in that case was a director and shareholder of Pacific \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLaw Society of Singapore v Tan Chun Chuen Malcolm[2020] SGHC 166\n34Navigation Pte Ltd (\u201cPacific Navigation\u201d), a company which provided bridging \nfinance for the appellant\u2019s purchase and operation of a vessel. The respondent\u2019s \nlaw firm acted for both the appellant and Pacific Navigation. Two forms of \nconflict were identified: (a) a conflict between the respondent\u2019s duty to the \nappellant and her personal interest in Pacific Navigation; and (b) a conflict \nbetween the respondent\u2019s duty to the appellant and her duty to Pacific \nNavigation, which was also her client (at [19]).

The relevant background \nincludes the particular industry in which the parties operate, the character of the \ndocument which contains the terms in question as well as the course of dealings \nbetween the parties (Lonstroff at [51]). \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nGA Engineering Pte Ltd v Sun Moon Construction Pte Ltd  [2020] SGHC 167\n15Reliance on Glass Specifications is an afterthought\n36 The first point that the defendant makes is that the plaintiff\u2019s reliance on \nthe Glass Specifications is an afterthought, raised in bad faith and without \nproper basis. The defendant points out correctly that the plaintiff\u2019s statement of \nclaim originally did not plead any failure to meet the Glass Specifications. The \nplaintiff referred to the Glass Specifications only when it amended its statement \nof claim in March 2019. The defendant submits that the plaintiff amended its \nstatement of claim to include this plea as an afterthought, only because the \nexperts\u2019 joint report confirmed that the white spots affected only the coating on \nthe dark green panels and that there was no delamination as originally pleaded.24 \nThe belated amendment is a \u201csignificant factor\u201d which the court should consider \nin determining whether the Subcontract incorporated the Glass Specifications.25\n37 I reject this submission. The timing of the plaintiff\u2019s amendment or the \nmotivation for the amendment has no direct bearing on whether the Glass \nSpecifications were incorporated into the Subcontract. The defendant cites no \nauthority to support this argument. The parties\u2019 objective intention at the time \nof contracting is the only relevant criterion for incorporation. Even if the plea is \nan afterthought, it has been raised by the appropriate procedure, ie amendment. \nI must determine it on its merits.\nThe plaintiff never gave the defendant a copy of the main contract \n38 The second point that the defendant makes is that the plaintiff never gave \nthe defendant a copy of the main contract. The defendant refers to the evidence \nof the plaintiff\u2019s contracts manager, Mr Danny Cheng (\u201cMr Cheng\u201d), at trial. \n24 Defendant\u2019s Closing Submissions at para 91.\n25 Defendant\u2019s Closing Submissions at para 8.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nGA Engineering Pte Ltd v Sun Moon Construction Pte Ltd  [2020] SGHC 167\n16Mr Cheng said that the main contract did not accompany the letter of award \nwhich was eventually issued to the defendant.26 \n39 I do not consider this submission to be relevant on the issue of \nincorporation. \n40 Clause 8.1 of the Subcontract provides that the defendant shall be \n\u201cdeemed to have full knowledge of the provisions of the Main Contract\u201d. It also \nexplicitly gives the defendant a right to inspect the main contract at the \nplaintiff\u2019s office. As a matter of law, it is well-established that in the absence of \nfraud or misrepresentation, a party is bound by all the terms of a contract that it \nsigns, even if that party did not read or understand those terms (Bintai Kindenko \nPte Ltd v Samsung C&T Corp and another [2019] 2 SLR 295 at [58]). The \ndefendant is therefore bound by cl 8.1. \n41 I also find to be reasonable Mr Cheng\u2019s explanation that the main \ncontract did not accompany the letter of award because the documents were too \nbulky. It was always within the defendant\u2019s power to exercise its right under \ncl 8.1 to inspect the main contract at the plaintiff\u2019s office. The defendant cannot \nnow rely on the plaintiff\u2019s failure to supply a copy of the main contract to \ndisclaim the clear effect of cl 8.1 and to argue that the Glass Specifications were \nnot incorporated into the Subcontract. \nThe Glass Specifications came into existence after the Subcontract\n42 The defendant\u2019s final argument is that the Glass Specifications came \ninto existence only after the plaintiff and the defendant entered into the \n26 Notes of Evidence, 1 July 2019, p20(11) to 20(16).\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nGA Engineering Pte Ltd v Sun Moon Construction Pte Ltd  [2020] SGHC 167\n17Subcontract.

The \ndefendant argues that July 2014 reflects the date of the creation of the main \ncontract, including the AS, and therefore suggests that the main contract came \ninto existence after the Subcontract.\n(1) Glass Specifications incorporated into the Subcontract even if they \ncame into existence after June 2014\n44 I start by pointing out that there is no principle of law that a document \nwhich comes into existence only after a contract is formed cannot be \nincorporated by reference into that contract. It all depends on the parties\u2019 \nintention, objectively ascertained from the terms of their contract. Indeed, \u201cit is \nnot uncommon for parties to first agree on a set of essential terms which the \nparties may be bound by as a matter of law and on the basis of which they may \nact, even while there may be ongoing discussions on the incorporation of other \nusually detailed terms\u201d (Lonstroff ([34] supra) at [52]). \n45Lonstroff was, of course, considering ongoing discussions of more \ndetailed terms between the contractual counterparties themselves. But there is \nno reason in principle why the contractual counterparties may not also agree to \nincorporate by reference the terms of a future contract which one of the \ncontractual counterparties will negotiate and then enter into with a third party. \n27 Cheng Jiu How Danny\u2019s AEIC at p40; Plaintiff\u2019s Bundle of Documents at p106.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nGA Engineering Pte Ltd v Sun Moon Construction Pte Ltd  [2020] SGHC 167\n18Whether the terms of that later contract are in fact incorporated into the parties\u2019 \nearlier contract is simply a matter of contractual construction. \n46 Thus, for example, the Court of"}

Rejecting the accused, the victim stated that she was a child and that sex could lead to pregnancy. The accused assured her that to protect her from pregnancy, he would use a condom.', '9\\u2003Thereafter, the accused brought the victim to an empty flat within a block of flats that was about to be demolished to have sex.

Despite her fear and disgust, the victim fellated the accused and the accused used his penis to penetrate the victim\u2019s mouth for approximately two minutes.

This would be repeated in subsequent occasions whenever the victim performed fellatio on the accused.', '13\\u2003Then, the accused asked the victim to lean against the wall. After putting a condom on his erect penis, he pulled down her shorts and panties and penetrated her vagina with his penis for four to five minutes.

This formed the basis of the third charge proceeded with (but which was the sixth charge in the series of nine charges against the accused) (\u201cthe sixth charge\u201d). On this occasion, and on subsequent occasions, the accused did not use a condom.', '16\\u2003Sometime in July 2013, the victim began a relationship with another man. In August 2013, the accused asked her about her relationship status. When the victim said she had a boyfriend, the accused asked her whether they had sex. She replied that they had sex on one occasion. Then, the accused told her he no longer wanted to have sex with her as he felt she was \u201cdirty\u201d.', '17\\u2003Sometime after that, the victim developed symptoms akin to morning sickness. She informed the accused of her suspicion that she might be pregnant. After using a pregnancy test kit she received from the accused, the victim discovered that she was indeed pregnant. The victim informed the accused of the result. On the same day, he told her to remain silent about their sexual activities. With the intention of inducing a miscarriage, the accused bought pineapple juice and fermented rice for the victim to consume. The accused did so for three successive days.', '18\\u2003The victim then told her mother about the pregnancy and said that it was her boyfriend\u2019s child. In April 2014, the victim, who was only 14 years old at the time, gave birth to a boy (\u201cthe first child\u201d). As the victim was a minor, the police commenced investigations into the matter. The victim did not disclose that she had sexual intercourse with the accused. She was afraid that the accused might show to other people the videos and photographs that he had captured of her engaging in intercourse and performing fellatio (see [14] above). Also, she wanted to protect the accused, and she was afraid he would get into trouble if she were to reveal the truth. Further, she did not want to ruin the relationship between her mother and the accused. Thus, she informed the police that she had sex with her boyfriend.', '19\\u2003In 2016, the victim gave birth to another boy, whose father was another boyfriend. In early 2017, when the victim\u2019s mother confronted her about her sexual activities, the victim revealed that it was the accused who had \u201cmade her like this\u201d. The victim\u2019s mother agreed to let the matter rest when the accused and the victim said they did not have sex after the victim became pregnant with the first child, and they promised her not to have sex anymore.', '20\\u2003In February 2018, the victim gave birth to a daughter. In May 2018, the victim brought her daughter to the hospital for a medical check-up. The victim\u2019s Child Protection Officer (\u201cthe CPO\u201d) from the Ministry of Social and Family Development approached them and asked about the first child\u2019s paternity. The victim disclosed that she had sex with the accused in 2013. Although the CPO advised the victim and her mother to make a police report, they were unwilling to do so immediately.', '21\\u2003On 22 May 2018, the CPO approached the victim at the void deck of her home and urged her to report the matter without delay as the CPO was concerned about the safety of the victim\u2019s daughter. The victim proceeded to make the police report on 23 May 2018. Even then, she still evinced an intention to protect the accused.', '22\\u2003Following further investigations, blood samples belonging to the accused, the victim and the child were sent to the Health Sciences Authority (\u201cHSA\u201d) for analysis. Based on the DNA profiles, the HSA analysis shows that the probability of the accused\u2019s paternity of the child was 99.9999%.'"}

After the creditors submitted their notices of claim, the Nominee recommended that a creditors\u2019 meeting be called to consider Aathar\u2019s proposed 3rd VA. The Nominee had adjudicated OUELH\u2019s claim at one third of its claimed sum ($19.3 million instead of $58 million). 5', 'OUELH\u2019s claim against Aathar was a contingent claim based on its suit (Suit 441\/2016) against, among others, Aathar for loss and damages relating to a Standby Facility extended by investment funds (the Crest Entities).', '9\\u2003In April 2019, the AR allowed the creditors\u2019 meeting to be called.

On 24 May 2019, they informed the Nominee of OUELH\u2019s concerns on the veracity of Golden Cliff\u2019s and the Indonesian creditors\u2019 claims. In particular, they stated that: (a) the material irregularities raised by the courts in the previous two proposed VAs needed to be fully and adequately addressed; (b) Golden Cliff\u2019s claim should be excluded in full; and (c) the Indonesian creditors\u2019 claims should be excluded as the Indonesian creditors\u2019 bona fides had been seriously questioned by the courts in the previous decisions. 7', '10\\u2003On 28 May 2019, a day before the Creditors\u2019 Meeting, the Nominee sent OUELH\u2019s counsel an excel spreadsheet setting out the final adjudication of all claims (\u201cFinal Adjudication\u201d), which included the following.', '(a)\\u2003The Nominee reduced the interest component under the Standby Facility to 15% per annum as the Standby Facility contractual interest of 3.5% per month with default interest of 2.0% per month was too high. He adjudicated the total amount claimable by OUELH at $28.76 million, before discounting OUELH\u2019s claim to 10% of its adjudicated value, or $2.876 million. He also marked OUELH\u2019s claim as \u201cobjected to\u201d. 8', '(b)\\u2003The Nominee adjudicated claims by over 20 Indonesian creditors \u2013 the same creditors involved in the previous two VAs \u2013 at over $159 million, which comprised about 65% of Aathar\u2019s overall adjudicated liabilities of around $245 million. Of this $159 million, around $113 million of the claims belonged to Fajar ($51.5 million), Berkah ($36.8 million) and Entete ($25 million). 9', '11\\u2003The Nominee stated in his Chairman\u2019s Report dated 12 June 2019 of the Creditors\u2019 Meeting (\u201cChairman\u2019s Report\u201d) that he \u201cha[d] not seen clear evidence\u201d that third party creditors had triggered the Indon Entities\u2019 liabilities under their respective SCG Deeds.

The respondent had acted for MSK in a dispute with JKC Consultant (\u201cJKC\u201d), MSK\u2019s sub-contractor on a building project. JKC had served a writ and statement of claim on MSK on or around 2 August 2017 to claim the value of electrical works they had performed. The complainant had initially approached Mr Gurdaib Singh. The two men agreed that Mr Singh would find another lawyer to deal with the matter.

Terms of engagement and a warrant to act were signed on this occasion. The respondent, who had been provided the necessary documents, was told to file the Defence. On his part, the respondent asked the complainant to check if he had other documents for the counterclaim. On 25 August 2017, the complainant sent an email stating that he could not find the documents for the counterclaim, and gave instructions for the Defence to be filed without the counterclaim. The Defence was not filed, and enquiries from the client went unattended. 2', '4\\u2003Default judgment was entered against MSK on 31 August 2017. 3', 'Although notice of the default judgment was served on the respondent on 31 August 2017, 4', 'he was unaware of it.

On this occasion, the respondent sought to persuade the complainant to file an affidavit stating that the Defence was filed late due to MSK\u2019s delay in providing details to its lawyers. The complainant refused because he had given instructions timeously and had specifically instructed the respondent to file the Defence earlier. Meeting the complainant again on 21 September 2017, the respondent again did not explain how default judgment had been entered. This was despite the complainant\u2019s repeated request for an explanation of the same. Instead, pointing to the purported procedural defects in the default judgment, the respondent obtained the complainant\u2019s signed consent on a letter to JKC\u2019s solicitors. The letter communicated that the respondent had instructions to set aside the default judgment (on the basis of those procedural defects) and sought JKC\u2019s indulgence for MSK to file its Defence and Counterclaim in the suit. 7', '5\\u2003By a letter of 4 October 2017, the respondent requested instructions from the complainant to continue the suit. 8', 'The complainant replied on the same day asking for an explanation in respect of the default judgment. 9', 'Again when the respondent replied, he did not answer the questions but informed that he had drafted a simple affidavit to set aside the default judgment and that the Defence and Counterclaim were ready to be filed subject to a few clarifications. 10', 'The complainant did not respond to this letter: instead, he lodged a complaint with the Law Society against the respondent on 16 October 2017. 11', 'Eventually the respondent informed the complainant on 24 October 2017 that he would discharge himself 12', 'and rendered his invoice for work done in the suit. 13', '6\\u2003The primary charge against the respondent read as follows:', 'The alternative charge was worded in exactly the same manner, save that it alleged that the same actions amounted to \u201cmisconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court of Singapore or as a member of an honourable profession within the meaning of Section 83(2)(h) of the Legal Profession Act (Chapter 161)\u201d. 15', '7\\u2003The gravamen of Law Society\u2019s charges against the respondent was that upon finding out about the default judgment, the respondent did not follow the procedure set out in r 22(3)(a) of the LPPR.

{"casename":"2020_SGHC_177","fact":"'3\\u2003The business was initially set up by Raymond\u2019s and Roland\u2019s father as a sole proprietorship and subsequently incorporated as the Company with the father and sons holding one share each. It was in the business of importing and exporting household products, with its principal business in wholesale trade and the manufacture of chemical products. The father then left his share equally to Raymond and Roland when he passed away.', '4\\u2003Raymond\u2019s case is as follows. As the father grew older, Roland and Raymond were tasked to grow the business. Although the brothers had their disputes even in 2004, they nevertheless continued to manage the Company together and it became more of a quasi-partnership. Despite their differences, there was a relationship of mutual trust and confidence, with the division of responsibilities between the brothers in the Company. Subsequently, matters took a turn for the worse which led to the breakdown of the relationship and conflict within the Company. This included Roland\u2019s deliberate exclusion or obstruction of Raymond from participating in human resource matters in the Company, Roland\u2019s abuse of his access rights to the computer system to monitor Raymond\u2019s emails, and Roland\u2019s conduct vis-\u00e0-vis third parties which affected the Company\u2019s reputation. The Company is dysfunctional and the brothers no longer communicate with each other and can no longer make decisions for the Company. Essentially there is a deadlock and a loss of substratum in the Company which had been formed as a family business and quasi-partnership. Raymond attempted to utilise the buy-out mechanism in the Company\u2019s Constitution, but Roland was not agreeable to any offer that he made.', '5\\u2003Roland resisted the winding up. He asserted that the Company was never started as a quasi-partnership nor ever ran as such, and that it was not founded on mutual trust or confidence between the brothers. The brothers regarded each other strictly as business colleagues. They had many disagreements over the years and did not see eye to eye on many issues. However, Roland disputed Raymond\u2019s allegations of what Roland had allegedly done to cause the breakdown in trust and confidence between them. In any event, the Company\u2019s Constitution provided for a share buy-out mechanism. The winding up procedure was an abuse of process and Raymond was using it for a collateral purpose to pressure Roland into agreeing to his unreasonable buy-out terms. A winding up was also not appropriate as the Company is a going concern and a viable business.', '6\\u2003I set out briefly some of the broader areas of dispute, as they formed the backdrop to the applications made in these proceedings.', '7\\u2003The first concerned the supply of gloves. According to Roland, Raymond had caused the Company to enter into a glove-supply contract with White Glove Co Ltd (\u201cWhite Glove\u201d) on unconscionable terms and caused the Company to terminate the previous contract with Dupallo Industries Sdn Bhd (\u201cDupallo\u201d). The gloves supplied by White Glove were consigned to a Singapore company, Motusgen Pte Ltd (\u201cMotusgen\u201d), which belonged to Raymond\u2019s son, Kenneth. The Company was also issued payment invoices from another entity, Century Plastic Manufacturing Company (Private) Limited (\u201cCentury Plastic\u201d), for the shipment of the products. Raymond\u2019s friend, one \u201cKang\u201d, is the owner of Century Plastic. Roland found these arrangements problematic as White Glove only charged about $0.54 per glove, whereas Century Plastic sold the gloves to the Company at $1.07 per glove. Roland hence began investigations into these transactions.', '8\\u2003The second dispute involved Raymond\u2019s decision to hire one Michael Tan (\u201cMichael\u201d) as the General Manager of the Company, which Roland did not agree with. The third dispute involved NTUC Fairprice Co-operative Ltd\u2019s (\u201cNTUC Fairprice\u201d) decision not to renew a particular contract with the Company, which Roland claimed was Raymond\u2019s fault. He claimed that Raymond had delayed in raising the necessary purchase orders to be issued by the Company to ANS Orient (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd for the latter to supply the product to meet NTUC Fairprice\u2019s requirements.', '9\\u2003Roland thus filed SUM 563 and applied to examine Raymond, Kenneth, Kang and Michael. He also sought an order that Raymond produce all documents pertaining to: (a) the supply contracts between the Company and NTUC Fairprice; (b) the supply of gloves by Dupallo to the Company; (c) the supply of gloves from White Glove to the Company through Century Plastic; and (d) the appointment or involvement of Motusgen as consignee in respect of the gloves supplied. Further, Roland sought orders that: (a) Kenneth produce all documents pertaining to Motusgen\u2019s involvement in the supply of the gloves; and (b) Kang produce all documents pertaining to Century Plastic\u2019s involvement in the supply of the gloves. Roland premised his application on s 285 of the CA read with r 49 of the Companies (Winding Up) Rules (Cap 50, R 1, 2006 Rev Ed) (\u201cCWU Rules\u201d) and ss 257(2)(c) and\/or 257(2)(f) of the CA (based on the provisions as they stood at the material time).', '10\\u2003Additionally the following persons (\u201cNon-Parties\u201d) filed notices of intention to appear in the proceedings and filed affidavits, namely: (a) Ang Chek Joo (\u201cChek Joo\u201d), the sister of Raymond and Roland, who has been employed at the Company for over 30 years and is the present admin manager of the Company; (b) Yuen Chin Ching (\u201cYuen\u201d), who has been employed at the Company for 20 years and is the present Senior Admin Executive of the Company; and (c) Liew Kit Yee (\u201cLiew\u201d), a former employee of the Company.'"}

I will not repeat them here. It suffices to note that the Energy Market Authority of Singapore (\u201cEMA\u201d) had established the Enhanced Forward Sales Contract Scheme (\u201cthe Scheme\u201d) to facilitate participation in Singapore\u2019s electric futures market. SEPL was accepted as a participant in the Scheme. 11', 'SEPL later engaged Menrva as a consultant pursuant to the consultancy agreement.', '7\\u2003Under the consultancy agreement, Menrva was obliged to provide Mr Chan\u2019s services to SEPL (liability judgment at [1]). Two of the legal issues were (a) whether Menrva had breached the consultancy agreement and (b) whether SEPL was contractually liable to pay Menrva certain fees under the same agreement (liability judgment at [27]). Coomaraswamy J held largely in favour of the defendants to the claim, who are also the applicants in the present case. He held for Menrva in the counterclaim, leaving damages to be assessed (at [153] and [154]).', '8\\u2003SEPL and SEPPL appealed against the liability judgment. This is reported in Sun Electric Pte Ltd and another v Menrva Solutions Pte Ltd and another [2019] SGCA 51. The appeal was dismissed with SEPL and SEPPL ordered to pay costs in the sum of S$45,000. Meanwhile, the parties proceeded with the assessment of damages for Menrva\u2019s counterclaim. 12', 'The hearing of oral closing submissions was fixed on 30 September 2019. 13', 'Menrva had quantified its counterclaim at S$1,495,452.53 and interest at S$262,489.20. Both applicants also filed a Bill of Costs against SEPL and demanded costs amounting to S$622,771.81. 14', 'However, these sums were disputed by SEPL and SEPPL.', '9\\u2003Although the respondents have not sought leave to appeal against my decision to grant the applicants the Mareva injunction on 24 September 2019, I set out the matters that transpired during all four hearings. These also encompass my reasons for granting the Mareva injunction.', '10\\u2003It must be highlighted that one of the respondents, SEPPL, the second plaintiff in the suit, had become the subject of judicial management proceedings (\u201cJM proceedings\u201d) (see Originating Summon 1060 of 2019). 15', 'This was made known to the applicants on 21 August 2019 through the disclosure of Mr Peloso\u2019s affidavit in support of the JM proceedings. 16', 'Mr Peloso applied for SEPPL to be placed under judicial management on two grounds. First, that SEPPL was unable to pay its debts. Second, that the interests of SEPPL\u2019s shareholders would be better served through the winding down of its operations.', '11\\u2003Based on Mr Peloso\u2019s affidavit, SEPPL\u2019s issued share capital was S$45,605,994. As of the date of Mr Peloso\u2019s affidavit, SEPPL\u2019s cash on hand amounted to a meagre $93,599.64. In his affidavit, Mr Peloso claimed that SEPPL\u2019s major creditors were SESPL and SEPL, various customers of SEPPL, Wong Partnership LLP, and an entity known as Kashish. 17', 'Kashish was listed as SEPPL\u2019s largest creditor with an outstanding debt of S$927,594.61. The role of Kashish in the present proceedings was significant and I will explain the relevance of this in greater detail below. As of the date of the final hearing on 22 October 2019, judicial managers had not yet been appointed. 18', 'The applicants had stressed that judicial management applications (\u201cJM applications\u201d) were not always successful and that in the meantime, SEPPL should be restrained from dissipating its assets. 19', '12\\u2003Before the 12 September 2019 hearing, Andrew Ang SJ had granted a Mareva injunction and various disclosure orders on 30 August 2019 on an ex parte basis. On 4 September 2019, Tan Lee Meng SJ ordered that compliance with the disclosure orders be put on hold until the disposal of the inter partes hearing.', '13\\u2003At the inter partes hearing on 12 September 2019, the applicants sought, inter alia, the following orders: 20', '(a)\\u2003an order restraining the respondents from disposing of their assets in Singapore and any jurisdiction outside Singapore up to the value of S$2,512,817.80;', '(b)\\u2003further and in the alternative, an order restraining SEPPL from disposing of its assets in Singapore and any jurisdiction outside Singapore up to the value of S$709,263.81; and', '(c)\\u2003various ancillary disclosure orders.', '14\\u2003On the basis of the evidence before me, I was inclined to grant both the Mareva injunction and Disclosure Orders at the first hearing on 12 September 2019. However, for reasons which will be made clear, both the Mareva injunction and the Disclosure Orders were not granted that day but only at the subsequent hearings held on 24 September 2019 and 22 October 2019.', '15\\u2003To obtain Mareva relief against a party to the suit, a plaintiff must establish a good arguable case on the merits and a real risk that the defendant will dissipate its assets to frustrate the enforcement of an anticipated judgment of the court (Bouvier, Yves Charles Edgar and another v Accent Delight International Ltd and another and another appeal [2015] 5 SLR 558 (\u201cBouvier\u201d) at [36]). The issue of there being a \u201cgood arguable case\u201d did not arise because the plaintiff in the counterclaim, Menrva, had successfully established its counterclaim against SEPL, with judgment having been entered.', '16\\u2003In an application for a Mareva injunction against a third party to the suit, the applicant must show a \u201cgood arguable\u201d case that a third party is holding assets that belong to the defendant (Teo Siew Har v Lee Kuan Yew [1999] 3 SLR(R) 410 (\u201cTeo Siew Har\u201d) at [19]). The Court of Appeal (\u201cCA\u201d) in Bouvier affirmed the court\u2019s jurisdiction to include in a Mareva court order assets belonging to a third party on the basis that the assets are \u201cin truth the assets of the defendant\u201d (at [124]). I was mindful that the respondents, save for SEPL and SEPPL, were third parties in Suit No 200 of 2016. I was equally cognisant that each respondent was a separate legal personality. In arriving at my decision to grant Mareva relief against the respondents, I did not rely on the single economic entity doctrine, which has been rejected by the CA in Goh Chan Peng and others v Beyonics Technology Ltd and another and another appeal [2017] 2 SLR 592 at [70]\u2013[75].', '17\\u2003Applying the test in Teo Siew Har, I was of the view that the assets of the third parties were, on a good arguable standard, the assets of the defendant in the counterclaim, SEPL. It is not necessary for me to elaborate further as the respondents did not seek leave to appeal against this point (see [9] above).', '18\\u2003The parties\u2019 main point of contention at the four hearings was the existence of a \u201creal risk\u201d of asset dissipation.', '19\\u2003The evidence cited by the applicants included the following matters, which I accepted as showing a \u201creal risk\u201d of dissipation. First, there appeared to have been a breach of an existing Order of Court, ie, an interim injunction obtained by RCMA Asia Pte Ltd (\u201cRCMA\u201d) against SEPPL (\u201cthe RCMA Injunction\u201d, explained further at [21] below), through SEPPL\u2019s withdrawal or transfer of large sums of money out of a bank account it held. Second, SEPL had sold several of its patents for a sum of S$80,000. SEPL was then made the exclusive licensee of those patents. The terms of the licenses were not shown to court. Third, there was a large depletion of assets from SEPPL, the company that is now the subject of JM proceedings, to the tune of $16.8 million.', '20\\u2003As part of the same Scheme established by the EMA, SEPPL had entered into an agreement with RCMA. 21', 'Pursuant to this, RCMA agreed to perform certain obligations undertaken by SEPPL. SEPPL was to receive 70% of the payouts made by the EMA and RCMA the remaining 30%. Collectively, these were known as the \u201cFSC Payments\u201d. 22', '21\\u2003A dispute arose between RCMA and SEPPL. 23', 'RCMA commenced Suit 191 of 2018 to recover its share of the FSC Payments under the agreement. Subsequently, on 26 February 2018, RCMA obtained the RCMA injunction on the following terms: 24', '22\\u2003The applicants contended that there had been a blatant disregard of the RCMA injunction. This was evident from various transfers out of SEPPL\u2019s OCBC Account (\u201cthe OCBC Account\u201d) made in direct contravention of the terms of the RCMA Injunction. 25', 'This in turn evidenced a \u201creal risk\u201d of dissipation of assets.', '23\\u2003It is undisputed that there was initially a certain sum of money in the OCBC Account. The OCBC Account was a joint account specifically opened to receive money under the FSC Scheme. 26', 'Pursuant to the terms of the agreement between RCMA and SEPPL, both parties were joint signatories to the OCBC Account. 27', '24\\u2003After the RCMA Injunction was imposed by the court, there were at least three transfers or withdrawals from the OCBC Account for various purposes. I highlight two of the more significant ones, which demonstrated a \u201creal risk\u201d of dissipation. The first was made on 24 September 2018, where a sum of S$1,500,000 was withdrawn from the OCBC Account. Mr Peloso attempted to explain this withdrawal in the following manner: 28', '25\\u2003In other words, Mr Peloso was aware that the money should not have been withdrawn from the OCBC Account. He was conscious that removing the sum constituted a breach of the terms of the RCMA injunction. Still, he proceeded to withdraw the sum of money from the OCBC Account. Mr Peloso\u2019s justification for defying a clear court order (ie, the RCMA Injunction) was that SEEAPL \u201curgently required monies to pay a contractor\u201d and that \u201cthe funds in SEPPL\u2019s OCBC Account were the only option available at the time\u201d.', '26\\u2003Thereafter, sometime between 27 November 2018 to 17 December 2018, money was again taken out of the OCBC Account, in apparent contravention of the RCMA Injunction. This time, the entire sum of money in the OCBC Account was transferred to a DBS Account held by SEPPL (\u201cthe DBS account\u201d). The sum amounted to approximately S$6 million. 29', 'This sum of money was subsequently garnished by an UAE entity, known as \u201cKashish\u201d, in highly suspicious circumstances.', '27\\u2003In January 2019, a mere one month after the sum was transferred from the OCBC Account to the DBS Account, Kashish commenced proceedings in Singapore against SEPPL for the sum of $6,995,755.78 in Suit 74 of 2019. The losses were allegedly incurred by SEPPL through trading under various contracts for differences (\u201cCFDs\u201d) that SEPPL had entered into with Kashish from 2016 to 2018. 30', '28\\u2003As it turned out, after the commencement of the proceedings, SEPPL decided not to enter an appearance in Suit 74 of 2019. This was apparently done on the advice of its solicitors. Consequently, Kashish obtained default judgment for the sum of S$6,995,755.78. 31', '29\\u2003The evidence showed that Kashish had found out about this sum of money through Mr Peloso himself. This was by way of a letter sent by SEPPL through Mr Peloso on 3 December 2018. This letter was sent about one month before Kashish commenced proceedings against SEPPL.', '30\\u2003The letter reads as follows:', '31\\u2003This letter was signed by Mr Peloso on behalf of SEPPL. 32', 'Just as with the earlier withdrawal on 24 September 2018, it was evident that Mr Peloso knew that \u201cthe money in the account [could not] be moved due to the injunction order\u201d.', '32\\u2003Yet, as it later emerged, all of the money in the OCBC Account found its way into the hands of Kashish.', '33\\u2003On 14 February 2019, about a month or so after the S$6 million was moved from the OCBC Account to the DBS Account, Kashish applied to garnish the DBS Account in HC\/SUM 767\/2019. 33', 'Kashish successfully obtained the garnishee order. A copy of the order was served on SEPPL on 21 February 2019. 34', '34\\u2003I found the manner in which Kashish obtained SEPPL\u2019s DBS Account details highly troubling. According to Mr Peloso, he himself had informed Kashish of the DBS Bank Account number. On 9 January 2019, Mr Peloso met with Mr Arpan Saha (\u201cMr Saha\u201d), Kashish\u2019s Account Manager. 35', 'During this meeting, Mr Peloso claimed that Mr Saha had asked him for \u201cproof of funds\u201d that SEPPL could satisfy the default judgment. In response, Mr Peloso disclosed the DBS Account number and the fact that the account held approximately $6 million in funds. 36', 'It was not made clear to me why it was necessary for Mr Peloso to inform Mr Saha of the DBS Account number.', '35\\u2003It was undisputed that the money that was removed from the OCBC Account to the DBS Account was not ultimately replaced by SEPPL. In other words, there was a net depletion of approximately S$6 million from the OCBC Account. This had been done despite Mr Peloso having stated in his letter to Kashish that \u201cthe money in the account cannot be moved due to the [RCMA Injunction]\u201d.', '36\\u2003Mr Peloso\u2019s explanation for the above events did not withstand scrutiny. He claimed that Kashish was a legitimate commercial entity. He cited the fact that Kashish\u2019s website listed it as a \u201cwholly-owned subsidiary of a publicly listed company on the Bombay Stock Exchange\u201d (a company known as \u201cKushal Ltd\u201d). 37', 'The relatively large losses suffered, totalling approximately S$6.9 million, was explained as having been incurred under several separate CFDs. The losses were also said to have been sustained over a period of 11 separate quarters. 38', '37\\u2003Despite Mr Peloso\u2019s explanation, there was no evidence on how or why SEPPL entered into a commercial relationship with Kashish, an UAE entity. Details of the CFDs were not provided. I was not given an explanation as to why SEPPL continued entering into new CFDs with Kashish despite continuously suffering from such large losses over several quarters. In my judgment, the lack of evidence was wholly unsatisfactory. Given the above circumstances, I was satisfied that there was a real risk of dissipation of assets.', '38\\u2003About six months after the liability judgment was released, SEPL transferred eight of its 11 patents (or pending patent applications) to SEDSL, a BVI entity. 39', 'These patents were collectively sold by SEPL for S$80,000 and exclusively licensed back to entities in the SE Group. The respondents failed to produce the terms of these licenses. No explanation was furnished regarding why the patents were sold at this price. In this connection, it is worth noting that a much larger sum of $1.2m had been spent registering the patents (see below at [43]). I thus inferred that there was a real risk of dissipation.', '39\\u2003The final point concerned the SE Group\u2019s losses of about S$16.8 million.', '40\\u2003Mr Peloso claimed that SE Group entities earned approximately S$16.8 million in revenue from their share of FSC Payments under the Scheme. 40', 'It was unchallenged that the payments were received in SEPPL\u2019s OCBC Account. 41', 'The applicants submitted that there was no explanation as to how this large sum of money was used. 42', '41\\u2003Based on SEPPL\u2019s unaudited management accounts, its total cash and current assets, as at 31 July 2019, amounted to S$287,295.29, of which only S$93,599.64 was in the form of cash in bank accounts. 43', 'According to Mr Peloso, SEPPL\u2019s creditors included the following entities: 44', '(a)\\u2003Kashish, for the sum of $927,594.61;', '(b)\\u2003SESPL, for the sum of S$635,647.62;', '(c)\\u2003SEPL, for the sum of S$15,800.00;', '(d)\\u200340 customers of SEPPL, who had placed security deposits with SEPPL, for the total sum of $287,138.24 (the identities of the customers allegedly constituted commercially sensitive and confidential information and were therefore not disclosed); and', '(e)\\u2003WongPartnership LLP, for the sum of S$139,145.14.', '42\\u2003I have expressed my disquiet as regards the Kashish matter. Apart from Kashish, I noted that SEPPL\u2019s major creditors were primarily related entities who were also parties to the present proceedings.', '43\\u2003The respondents claimed that SEPPL\u2019s losses arose from the following matters. S$1.46 million had been used to pay for losses made on CFDs that Mr Chan had placed on behalf of SEPPL. 45', 'Of the remaining S$15.24 million, part of it had been used to pay off substantial expenses incurred by SEPPL in the ordinary course of business, while a large part of the sum had been channelled towards supporting the SE Group\u2019s capital-intensive projects. 46', 'For example, S$8,636,457 had been used to build photovoltaic systems. The other major expenses of the SE Group included nearly S$1.5m in legal costs, comprising the costs of the present litigation as well as Suit 1229 of 2016 involving Sunseap Group Pte Ltd. Another $1.2m in legal costs was incurred for registering patents. 47', '44\\u2003I was satisfied that the manner in which part of the $16.8 million had been spent gave rise to a real risk of dissipation.', '45\\u2003There were several reasons for this.', '46\\u2003First, there was very little documentary evidence supporting Mr Peloso\u2019s assertions on affidavit. The only supporting document was a redacted document titled \u201cIndependent Practitioner\u2019s Review\u201d. This, however, pertained to the affairs of SEEAPL and not SEPPL (ie, the party subject to the JM proceedings). The document showed that SEEAPL had incurred S$8,636,457 in costs for a \u201cphotovoltaic system\u201d, 48', 'as opposed to SEPPL, the party that had received the FSC Payments and had become the subject of JM proceedings. In relation to the other alleged debts, no documents were produced to evidence the losses allegedly made on the CFDs involving Mr Chan, or indeed any of the other expenses incurred by SEPPL.', '47\\u2003Second, it was clear that a large amount of the expenses listed by Mr Peloso in his affidavit for SEPPL was incurred by other entities in the SE Group. However, there was a noticeable omission by Mr Peloso to mention any reason why the sums that were received by SEPPL in the OCBC Account ended up being used by other entities in the SE Group.', '48\\u2003Third, while SEPPL claimed to have incurred almost S$1.5 million in legal costs, at least some of these costs were incurred for entities other than SEPPL. For instance, Suit 1229 of 2016 did not involve SEPPL. Further, although $1.2 million was allegedly incurred for the registration of patents, none of these registered patents were owned by SEPPL. Finally, it is worth mentioning that the FSC Payments were credited into SEPPL\u2019s OCBC Account and this was the same account jointly maintained with RCMA and the same account from which approximately S$6 million had been garnished by Kashish in highly suspicious circumstances. This too gave me reason to doubt Mr Peloso\u2019s version of events regarding the S$16.8 million.', '49\\u2003As stated above, I was prepared to grant the Mareva injunction and the Disclosure Orders based on the evidence before me. However, the respondents\u2019 counsel, Ms Koh Swee Yen (\u201cMs Koh\u201d), informed me of a potential deal with a foreign investor to acquire a controlling majority stake in SEEAPL. 49', 'A non-binding sheet had been signed and \u201cdefinitive agreements\u201d were to be signed by mid-September 2019. Final completion was supposed to take place by the end of September 2019.', '50\\u2003I should state that the applicants had claimed that the impending sale of shares in SEEAPL was also evidence of a real risk of dissipation. In this respect, the applicants relied on, inter alia, the respondent\u2019s failure to disclose the identity of the foreign investor 50', 'or any other details of the proposed sale.', '51\\u2003One option that I proposed was for some part of the sum received from the sale (the quantum of which had yet to be decided) to be paid into court. At this stage, it was not entirely clear how much money the SE Group would receive from the sale. The proposal would obviate the need for the Mareva injunction and the Disclosure Orders. 51', 'In the circumstances, I adjourned the matter to 16 September 2019. This was to allow Ms Koh to take her clients\u2019 instructions and consider the workability of the proposal.', '52\\u2003During the hearing, Ms Koh informed me that Mr Peloso had conferred with the other stakeholders in the SE Group. The SE Group was willing to set aside \u201ccash consideration\u201d of up to $1,605,452.53 from the sale of the majority stake in SEEAPL by way of payment into court.', '53\\u2003Counsel for the applicants, Ms Jennifer Sia (\u201cMs Sia\u201d), requested that the Mareva injunction remain in place until payment was made into court. Ms Koh, however, informed me that the deal would not go through if a Mareva injunction was in force. To overcome this, I granted the Mareva injunction with a proviso so that the sale could go ahead pending the payment of a sum of approximately $1.86 million (a revised figure from Ms Koh\u2019s proposal) into court (\u201cthe Enjoined Sum\u201d)). This sum represented the alleged quantum of damages arising from Menrva\u2019s counterclaim against SEPL, interest accruing from the date of the liability judgment and various legal costs. The Mareva injunction would be discharged with immediate effect upon the payment of the Enjoined Sum into court.', '54\\u2003The parties were to work out the precise terms of the draft order for the Mareva injunction. I decided not to grant the Disclosure Orders at this stage. This was to give the respondents some breathing space to successfully carry out the deal with the foreign investor. 52', '55\\u2003The parties were unable to agree on the terms of the draft order. I therefore fixed a hearing on 24 September 2019 to finalise the terms of the Mareva injunction.', '56\\u2003On 24 September 2019, the terms of the Mareva injunction were finalised. During the hearing, counsel for the respondents, Mr Daniel Liu (\u201cMr Liu\u201d), informed me that the foreign investor had become concerned about contingent liabilities arising from the Mareva injunction. Mr Liu told me that the initial amount of cash consideration proposed by the foreign investor had not taken into account these contingent liabilities. 53', '57\\u2003In response, I informed parties that I would make the Disclosure Orders if the proposed acquisition did not go ahead and the Enjoined Sum was not paid into court.', '58\\u2003On 22 October 2019, I granted the Disclosure Orders which formed the subject of the respondents\u2019 application for leave to appeal.', '59\\u2003As it turned out, the proposed deal for the acquisition of SEEAPL\u2019s majority stake did not go through. Apparently, RCMA had found out the foreign investor\u2019s identity and alerted it to the Mareva injunction. However, Mr Liu acknowledged that it was \u201cstill possible that the deal may go through\u201d in the future. 54', '60\\u2003I had indicated to the respondents during the earlier hearings that I was minded to grant the Disclosure Orders. Mr Liu stated that the respondents were willing to accept the Disclosure Orders being made against the corporate entities. Mr Liu, however, requested that no order be made against Mr Peloso on the ground that his only foreign asset was allegedly located in Canada. Ironically, the fact that Mr Peloso\u2019s foreign asset was confined to Canada, even if true, would have made it easier for him to comply with the Disclosure Orders. I thus granted substantially all the orders sought by the applicants.', '61\\u2003The full set of Disclosure Orders were as follows: 55', '62\\u2003I also ordered that the disclosure affidavits be sealed.'"}

In or around September 2019, Mr Chng sought for Kaefer Germany to purchase his 20% shareholding. This was governed by a Shareholders Agreement of 20 July 2016 and an Addendum of 1 September 2016 between Mr Chng, the Company and Kaefer Germany (collectively, \u201cthe SHA\u201d). The SHA gave Kaefer Germany the exclusive option to require Mr Chng to sell his shares. A formula was set out in the SHA to calculate the value of Mr Chng\u2019s shares. This formula was premised on the Company\u2019s average annual audited earnings before tax for the financial period from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2018, with a proviso for a minimum base price of S$3m if exercised by Kaefer Germany. Kaefer Germany declined to exercise the option. When Mr Chng sought to sell his shares, he valued his shares at S$3m. Kaefer Germany\u2019s price, calculated using the formula prescribed by the SHA but without the price floor of S$3m, was about S$792,000. The share buyout fell through but formed the context for this dispute. Mr Chng first raised the issue of the Sum in that negotiation, and the respondents contended that Mr Chng\u2019s motive for taking out a derivative action arose out of this failed negotiation.'"}

{"casename":"2020_SGHC_182","fact":"'5\\u2003I start by summarising the key facts of this case before explaining why I found the SPA to have been rescinded by mutual agreement. As the defendants have not filed any appeal, I will explain briefly my findings on the alleged misrepresentations and other related issues but will not go into any great detail in respect of these findings.', '6\\u2003As a preliminary issue, the defendants refused to admit the authenticity of the two copies of the SPA adduced in evidence by the first plaintiff 4', '. It was not disputed that the plaintiffs were unable to produce the originals of the SPA at trial. However, I noted that in refusing to admit the authenticity of the two copies of the SPA, the defendants did not actually deny that the signatures on the last page of each copy were their signatures. Indeed, no allegation of forgery or fabrication was pleaded by the defendants. The defendants themselves had on 24 October 2014 obtained a copy of the SPA from M\/s Rodyk & Davidson LLP (\u201cRodyk\u201d), the law firm which prepared the SPA 5', 'and which was on record as having been engaged by the defendants in the matter of the SPA 6', '. The copy obtained by the defendants 7', 'corresponded to the first copy exhibited by the first plaintiff in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief (\u201cAEIC\u201d) 8', '; and it did not appear that the defendants had at any time raised any query about the appearance \u2013 much less, the contents \u2013 of this document. The second defendant testified that two documents were signed by the defendants on 17 September 2014 9', ', and I concluded that in all probability the parties had signed two sets with the same terms and conditions (the second set being the document exhibited at pages 48\u201351 of the first plaintiff\u2019s AEIC). In coming to this conclusion, I noted that the Rodyk partner overseeing the matter \u2013 one Low Chai Chong (\u201cMr Low\u201d) \u2013 had apparently signed as a witness on both copies of the SPA exhibited in the first plaintiff\u2019s AEIC 10', '. Mr Low did not suggest \u2013 nor was it suggested to him \u2013 that his signature on one or other of these copies was a forgery.', '7\\u2003In short, having considered the evidence before me, I saw no reason to doubt the authenticity of the two copies of the SPA exhibited in the first plaintiff\u2019s AEIC.', '8\\u2003I next considered the defendants\u2019 contention that any SPA they had signed must have been vitiated by fraudulent misrepresentations made by the first plaintiff. In this connection, the defendants did not dispute that since they were the parties who had alleged fraudulent misrepresentation and counterclaimed damages for it, they bore the legal burden and the corresponding evidential burden of proving these allegations.', '9\\u2003It is not disputed that the two defendants are close associates of another Malaysian businessman known as \u201cTedy Teow\u201d. It is also not disputed that prior to the signing of the SPA on 17 September 2014, the first plaintiff had met with Tedy Teow (\u201cTeow\u201d) and had spoken with him about the sale of PSL shares. The defendants asserted that their interest in purchasing PSL shares arose solely because Teow was interested in purchasing agarwood (a type of timber). The second defendant claimed that sometime in early September 2014, he had \u2013 at Teow\u2019s request \u2013 spoken with the first plaintiff over the telephone after one Bernard Lim informed Teow that the first plaintiff had a business proposal to make concerning the supply of agarwood 11', '. According to the second defendant, the first plaintiff had represented in the course of their telephone conversation that Bernard Lim had a contact in Myanmar willing to \u201csupply large quantities of agarwood\u201d, but only to \u201clarge established companies\u201d and not \u201cprivate companies\u201d 12', '. The first plaintiff had explained that this was because the sale of agarwood was tightly controlled by the Myanmar government. It was also the first plaintiff who had purported to identify PSL as a company \u201clikely\u201d to be \u201cacceptable\u201d to the Myanmar government 13', '. According to the defendants, he had represented that he owned \u201ca large number of shares in PSL\u201d which he could sell to them to enable them to \u201cdo a reverse takeover of PSL\u201d and \u201cto gain control of PSL\u201d 14', '. After the reverse takeover of PSL was completed, the company \u201ccould then be used to buy agarwood from the contact in Myanmar\u201d 15', '.', '10\\u2003 The first plaintiff denied having represented that the defendants\u2019 purchase of his PSL shares would enable Teow to gain control of PSL and to use the company as the vehicle for acquiring agarwood from Myanmar. Instead, the first plaintiff claimed that the SPA was entered into simply because Teow himself \u201cwas interested in procuring a substantial stake in a listed company for his business purposes\u201d 16', '.', '11\\u2003Having reviewed the evidence, I accepted that Teow \u2013 and by extension, the defendants \u2013 had wanted to purchase PSL shares from the first plaintiff because they believed this would enable them to gain control of a publicly listed company and to use that company as a vehicle for the acquisition of agarwood in Myanmar. Inter alia, I noted that the first plaintiff himself admitted that he had met Teow during a trip to Laos 17', '; that he had been invited to Laos by one George Lim to \u201clook at some possible investments\u201d which the latter was \u201cintroducing\u201d him to 18', '; that he had been shown agarwood trees during this trip 19', '; and that George Lim and Teow had been \u201cvery excited\u201d about the agarwood and had discussed how valuable it was, how Teow could \u201cmake some very good things\u201d from the agarwood to \u201csell to his 4 million members or 2 million members\u201d 20', '. From the first plaintiff\u2019s own admissions, it was evident that the meeting arranged by George Lim was centred on Teow\u2019s interest in acquiring agarwood. It was also the first plaintiff\u2019s evidence that during the same meeting in which George Lim and Teow had discussed the value of agarwood, he himself had \u201cjust told [Teow] that [there was] a list co that [he was] holding on has cash and \u2026 no major shareholder \u2026\u201d 21', '. The first plaintiff further admitted that he brought this up because he had the \u201cintention of selling [his] shares\u201d to Teow 22', '.', '12\\u2003Given the first plaintiff\u2019s admissions, I did not believe his assertion that his proposal to sell PSL shares to Teow was made on the spur of the moment, with no connection whatsoever to Teow\u2019s interest in acquiring a supply of agarwood. Clearly, having observed Teow\u2019s interest in getting hold of a supply of agarwood, the first plaintiff saw the opportunity to use that interest as a springboard to pitch the sale of PSL shares to Teow. It is not disputed that by September 2014, the first plaintiff had purchased 9.755 million PSL shares using his mother\u2019s (ie, the second plaintiff\u2019s) UOB Kay Hian account 23', 'and another 5.735 million PSL shares using his wife\u2019s (Seow Ee Fun Yvonne\u2019s, \u201cYvonne\u201d\u2019s) account 24', '. On the first plaintiff\u2019s own evidence, several of his private banking clients also held a considerable number of PSL shares thanks to him: Chung Sook Yin (\u201cDr Chung\u201d) held not less than 4 million PSL shares 25', 'and Tan Seung Yuen (\u201cTan SY\u201d) held not less than 15.51 million PSL shares 26', '.', '13\\u2003In my view, the first plaintiff\u2019s admissions supported the inference that Teow\u2019s (and by extension, the defendants\u2019) interest in the PSL shares arose not because of any real interest in the company per se, but because it was suggested as a potential vehicle for facilitating the acquisition of agarwood. Teow then got his brother-in-law (ie, the second defendant) to follow up with the first plaintiff on his business proposal. The second defendant did so by phoning the first plaintiff sometime in September 2014 27', '. It was in this telephone conversation that the first plaintiff spoke about Bernard Lim having a contact in Myanmar who was able to supply agarwood but only to \u201clarge established companies\u201d, and about PSL being potentially a suitable vehicle for that purpose \u2013 should the defendants acquire control of it.', '14\\u2003However, I did not find that the evidence went far enough to prove that in this telephone call, the first plaintiff had represented that he \u201cowned\u201d all the PSL shares he was proposing to sell and\/or that the purchase of \u201chis\u201d shares per se would enable the defendants to gain control of PSL via a \u201creverse takeover\u201d.', '15\\u2003In respect of the alleged representation as to the ownership of the PSL shares to be sold, given that PSL was a publicly listed company and not some closely-held private company, there was no reason why Teow and the defendants should have been so anxious about whom the true owner of the shares was \u2013 and therefore no reason why the first plaintiff should have needed to represent that he was the owner of all the shares.', '16\\u2003In respect of the alleged representation about the \u201creverse takeover\u201d of PSL, the second defendant was very hazy about what a \u201creverse takeover\u201d meant: he was only able to say that he thought it meant \u201ccontrolling\u201d a company \u201cwith a large amount of shares\u201d 28', ', but he could not say what percentage of the shares in PSL they would have needed to purchase in order to achieve such control 29', '. Moreover, the parties were agreed that the 35 million shares to be sold pursuant to the SPA would not have been enough to enable the defendants to achieve a \u201creverse takeover\u201d of PSL. PSL being a publicly listed company, it would not have been difficult for Teow and\/or the defendants to verify the total number of shares issued by PSL and thus the number of shares required to achieve a \u201creverse takeover\u201d: the first plaintiff would have had no way of knowing whether they would conduct such checks. In the circumstances, I was of the view that even if the notion of a \u201creverse takeover\u201d of PSL had been mentioned during the telephone call between the first plaintiff and the second defendant, it was unlikely that the first plaintiff would have so boldly represented as a fact the defendants\u2019 ability to achieve a \u201creverse takeover\u201d of PSL with the number of shares he was selling them. As I alluded to at [13] earlier, it seemed likely that in speaking to Teow and subsequently to the second defendant, the first plaintiff must have suggested PSL as an appropriate vehicle for facilitating the purchase of the Myanmar agarwood \u2013 should the defendants gain control of it. It also seemed likely that he must have talked up the large number of shares he could sell them to aid an attempt at gaining control. However, the evidence fell short of proving that he must further have represented as a fact their ability to gain control via a \u201creverse takeover\u201d solely with the shares he was selling them.', '17\\u2003Following the telephone conversation between the first plaintiff and the second defendant, Bernard Lim informed the defendants that the first plaintiff had arranged for Singaporean lawyers to prepare an agreement for the sale and purchase of the PSL shares and to represent the defendants in the matter. Bernard Lim requested that the defendants fly to Singapore on 17 September 2014 to sign the SPA. The draft SPA was forwarded to the first defendant by Bernard Lim on 16 September 2014 30', '; and the following day, both defendants travelled to Singapore, where they were brought by the first plaintiff to the Rodyk office. The first defendant\u2019s personal assistant, Lang Cheah Yean (\u201cCarrie\u201d), and Bernard Lim also came along. They were met by Mr Low and his associate Liong Wei Kiat Alvin (\u201cAlvin\u201d).', '18\\u2003In this connection, it should be noted that although the plaintiffs sought to portray the defendants as having been advised and represented by Rodyk throughout the transaction, Mr Low\u2019s testimony revealed that it was actually the first plaintiff who had asked him \u201cfor a draft sale and purchase agreement \u2026 [as] he wanted to sell some PSL Holdings Ltd shares\u201d 31', '. Mr Low had never met nor spoken to the defendants until they turned up at his office on 17 September 2014. While the plaintiffs sought to make much of the letter of engagement signed by the defendants and the Rodyk invoice showing \u201cwork done\u201d and \u201cprofessional services rendered\u201d to the defendants 32', ', Mr Low testified that all he really did was 33', ':', '19\\u2003Mr Low\u2019s recollection was that the meeting at Rodyk (\u201cthe Rodyk meeting\u201d) was \u201cshort\u201d 34', '. He did not have \u201cany particular recollection\u201d of what the first plaintiff said at the meeting 35', '. Alvin too did not remember very much about the meeting 36', '. His evidence was that based on the documentary records, the lawyers\u2019 understanding of the transaction was that it was a sale by the plaintiffs of 35 million PSL shares for a total consideration of $10.5 million 37', '. When asked if there was any \u201cdiscussion where the transaction involved the crossing of a 30% shareholding limit which would trigger a general offer for PSL Holdings\u201d, Alvin testified that he did not remember such a discussion, and that if such a matter had been \u201cdiscussed between the parties and agreed to be part of the documentation\u201d, he \u201cwould have drafted it in \u2026 as per an agreement between the parties\u201d 38', '.', '20\\u2003Mr Low and Alvin appeared to me to be objective witnesses: neither had any ties to any of the parties, and both impressed me as endeavouring to give evidence as accurately as they could based on their recollection. Their evidence of the Rodyk meeting was completely at odds with the defendants\u2019 account of the meeting, in which \u2013 according to the defendants \u2013 the first plaintiff had spoken at length on how they would achieve a \u201creverse takeover\u201d of PSL with the shares they were buying from him and how they would be able to nominate directors to the PSL board once they effected the takeover 39', '.', '21\\u2003In so far as Carrie\u2019s notes of the Rodyk meeting were concerned 40', ', I accepted that these notes were authentic and genuine. The notes of the meeting were recorded by hand in a notebook and sandwiched between other handwritten notes about unrelated matters. It did not appear to me likely that Carrie would have falsified an entire notebook just for the purpose of enabling the defendants to introduce into evidence a few pages of notes. Indeed, it was not put to Carrie in cross-examination that she must have fabricated or falsified the notes. However, whilst I accepted the authenticity of her notes of the meeting, these notes merely showed that there was some reference to matters such as a reverse takeover during the meeting. These notes did not actually prove that the first plaintiff had made the alleged representations of fact during the meeting. In this connection, I would reiterate the observations I made at [16]. I would also add that given the weighty consequences of the alleged representations about a reverse takeover of a publicly listed company, if they had indeed been made in all seriousness by the first plaintiff, it would have been extremely odd for Mr Low and Alvin to take no note at all of such representations.', '22\\u2003As to the alleged representation regarding the first plaintiff\u2019s beneficial ownership of all the shares to be sold, whilst the preamble to the SPA did refer to the \u201cVendors\u201d as \u201cthe legal and\/or beneficial owner [of] 35,000,000 ordinary shares of [PSL]\u201d, I did not think that the defendants were induced by such a statement to enter into the SPA. I would reiterate the observations I made at [15]: namely, that given that PSL was a publicly listed company and not some closely-held private company, there was no reason why the defendants should have found it so important to chase down the real beneficial owner(s) of the shares being sold under the SPA. Moreover, as Mr Low pointed out in his testimony, it was the first plaintiff who would need to arrange for the transfer of the shares, either by presenting the requisite documentation at the Central Depository or by getting a broker to arrange for a married deal 41', '. There was no need, in other words, for the defendants to worry about whom the beneficial owner(s) of the shares were.', '23\\u2003As to the first plaintiff\u2019s alleged representation that the share price of PSL \u201cwould increase to $0.60 per share once the reverse takeover was completed\u201d 42', ', I did not find the allegation proven on the basis of the evidence before me. Whilst the first plaintiff would likely have exaggerated what an attractive buy the PSL shares were, \u201cmere praise by a man of his own goods or undertaking is a matter of puffing and pushing and does not amount to representation\u201d 43', '. I did not think it believable that the first plaintiff would have made such bold and specific representations as to what the price of PSL shares would be following a reverse takeover. In any event, a statement as to the future price of the PSL shares \u2013 being a statement as to a future state of affairs \u2013 \u201ccan in itself be neither true nor false\u201d, since \u201cthe future cannot be foretold\u201d: per Saville J in Bank Leumi le Israel BM v British National Insurance Co Ltd [1988] 1 Lloyd\u2019s Rep 71 at 75. For a statement to be actionable, the statement must relate to a matter of fact either present or past: Tan Chin Seng and others v Raffles Town Club Pte Ltd [2003] 3 SLR(R) 307 at [21]. As such, even if the first plaintiff had made statements about the future price of PSL shares, such statements would not have amounted to actionable representations. In the interest of completeness, I should add that having regard to the defendants\u2019 pleaded case and the evidence available, there was also no basis for me to find any representation by the first plaintiff that he possessed an \u201chonest belief \u2026 based on reasonable grounds\u201d that the future price of PSL shares would \u201cturn out as forecasted\u201d (Tan Swee Wan and another v Johnny Lian Tian Yong [2018] SGHC 169 at [260]).', '24\\u2003I also did not find it believable that the first plaintiff would have promised the defendants he would \u201carrange for the issuance or transfer of additional PSL shares\u201d to them \u201cfor no additional cost\u201d 44', '(\u201cthe Free Shares\u201d). There was simply no reason for him to make such a generous promise. Moreover, assuming the first plaintiff had indeed made such a generous promise, it seemed unbelievable that the defendants would not have asked for this to be documented \u2013 especially since (according to them) the first plaintiff had promised that the issuance or transfer of the Free Shares would be \u201crecorded in an addendum agreement (the \u201cAddendum Agreement\u201d) 45', '. Neither Mr Low nor Alvin gave any evidence that they were instructed by the defendants to document such a promise or statement made by the first plaintiff.', '25\\u2003The defendants argued that since the market price of the PSL shares was $0.17 per share at the time of the Rodyk meeting, they would not have agreed to pay the first plaintiff $0.30 per share had he not made the alleged representations 46', '. I did not accept this argument. In my view, bearing in mind the large number of shares which the defendants were purchasing under the SPA, I did not think it unreasonable or improbable that they would have agreed to pay a premium above the market price. After all, as a matter of common sense, if they had attempted to purchase 35 million shares in the market, it was highly unlikely that they would have been able to acquire all 35 million shares at one go, or for that matter, all 35 million shares at $0.17 per share.', '26\\u2003I should stress that while I did not find the evidence sufficient to prove the specific misrepresentations pleaded by the defendants, I did not believe the first plaintiff\u2019s assertion that he had never spoken with the defendants about getting control of PSL and\/or using PSL as the vehicle for acquiring agarwood from Myanmar. As I alluded to earlier (at [12]), it appeared to me the first plaintiff had latched on to Teow\u2019s interest in acquiring agarwood to present to him \u2013 and the defendants \u2013 a proposal for how a supply source for agarwood could be secured using PSL as the vehicle. If (as the first plaintiff claimed) the defendants had simply wanted to come up with a story about misrepresentations in order to justify repudiating the SPA, there was simply no need for them to come up with a complicated story involving diverse elements such as the acquisition of agarwood and the takeover of PSL. Carrie\u2019s notes of the Rodyk meeting (which I found to be authentic and genuine) also supported the inference that there was some mention of a reverse takeover of PSL during the meeting. I reiterate that in my view, and having regard in particular to the premium which the defendants were paying, the first plaintiff would very likely have talked up how the shares he was selling them would aid them in any attempt to gain control of PSL \u2013 just as he would very likely have talked up the possibility of an upside to the PSL share price.', '27\\u2003On the other hand, the defendants were quite open about not having checked up on the size and composition of PSL\u2019s shareholding prior to entering into the SPA. In the circumstances, while I accepted that they appeared to have thought the 35 million shares would enable them to effect a reverse takeover of PSL, it seemed to me possible \u2013 perhaps even likely \u2013 that this impression resulted from their own misunderstanding or misapprehension of the discussions with the first plaintiff. At any rate, as I have noted, the evidence was just not enough to prove that the first plaintiff had made the specific misrepresentations pleaded, or that the defendants were induced by these alleged misrepresentations to enter into the SPA.', '28\\u2003I should add that in respect of the second plaintiff, the parties were agreed that the defendants never met her and that she was not present at the Rodyk meeting on 17 September 2014. Mr Low testified that she was brought to the Rodyk office by the first plaintiff on 18 September 2014 and that she signed the SPA in his presence 47', '.', '29\\u2003It is apposite at this point to set out some of the key terms of the SPA. These were as follows:', '30\\u2003The defendants testified that upon the signing of the SPA, the first plaintiff was to arrange for them to open bank accounts with UOB, which accounts would then be used to make payment for the shares 48', '. This was not disputed by the plaintiffs. It was also not disputed that although clause 1.1 of the SPA stated that completion was to take place on 17 October 2014, the first defendant\u2019s UOB account was only opened on 24 October 2014, whereas the second defendant\u2019s account had not yet been opened as at that date 49', '.', '31\\u2003Around the same period, the first defendant and the first plaintiff also had several discussions about reducing the number of shares to be purchased by the defendants under the SPA 50', '. The first defendant had discovered that his bank in Malaysia (Bank Negara Malaysia) \u201cimposed certain limits on the quantum of investments in foreign currency assets which could be made in one year\u201d 51', '. Moreover, according to the first defendant, he had gone \u201conline to do checks\u201d and had \u201crealised that [the first plaintiff] was not one of the top 20 shareholders\u201d of PSL 52', '. At this stage, Teow and the defendants \u201cwere starting to have doubts on whether [the first plaintiff] had 35 million shares\u201d 53', '. The first defendant testified that sometime before his text message to the first plaintiff on 23 October 2014 54', ', he had already spoken to the first plaintiff about \u201ccancellation\u201d of the SPA 55', '. The first plaintiff had not wanted the SPA cancelled but was willing to consider a reduction in the number of shares to be sold 56', '. The first defendant therefore texted the first plaintiff on 23 October 2014 to ask him 57', ':', '32\\u2003The first defendant explained that by \u201cmy boss\u201d, he was referring to Teow; and that he was seeking to find out from the first plaintiff in this text message how many shares the latter needed Teow to buy 58', '; a negotiation, in other words, for a reduced number of shares. For his part, the first plaintiff denied having spoken with the first defendant between 17 October 2014 and 22 October 2014 about cancelling the SPA and\/or reducing the number of shares to be sold under the SPA. His position was that there was \u201cradio silence\u201d from the defendants in the period between 17 October 2014 and 22 October 2014 59', '. It should be noted, however, that his reply to the first defendant\u2019s text query (\u201cThe total need my boss help u how many share?\u201d) was 60', ':', '33\\u2003On 24 October 2014, the first defendant informed the first plaintiff of a new problem: Teow\u2019s son was apparently raising objections to the purchase price of $0.30 per share 61', ':', '34\\u2003There followed further text messages between the first defendant and the first plaintiff on 24 October 2014 after the latter complained that he was unable to get hold of Teow and the former urged him to \u201csettle\u201d with Teow 62', ':', '35\\u2003In cross-examination, the first defendant explained that \u201cpening\u201d was a colloquial term meaning \u201cdizzy\u201d \u2013 which was how he felt, \u201cstuck\u201d in the middle between his \u201cboss\u201d Teow on the one hand and the first plaintiff on the other 63', '. By 25 October 2014, it appeared that parties had yet to come to any firm resolution: the first defendant received an email from Mr Low stating that he had \u201creceived a message from [the first plaintiff]\u201d 64', ':', '36\\u2003To this, the first defendant replied that he needed to \u201cwait\u201d to see \u201chow much money [he could] bank in to [his] uob bank account within 1 week\u201d 65', '. It would appear that at this point, parties were still discussing a possible reduction in the number of shares to be purchased by the defendants: on 27 October 2014, Mr Low emailed the first defendant again stating 66', ':', '37\\u2003The first defendant replied that it still depended on \u201chow much money\u201d he could bank into his \u201cnew uob account within 1 week\u201d 67', '. However, an amended agreement for a reduced number of shares did not eventually materialise. Instead, sometime between 28 October 2014 and 31 October 2014 68', ', the first defendant came across announcements made by a listed company in Singapore (Nordic Group Limited, \u201cNordic\u201d) from which he discovered that 69', ':', '38\\u2003As noted earlier, by this time the first defendant had also discovered from PSL\u2019s annual reports for 2014 and 2015 that the first plaintiff was not named in the annual lists of PSL\u2019s 20 largest shareholders 70', '. This added to his suspicion that the first plaintiff did not actually own 35 million PSL shares. What happened thereafter formed the main bone of contention \u2013 factually speaking \u2013 between the plaintiffs and the defendants.', '39\\u2003On the defendants\u2019 account, the first defendant spoke to the first plaintiff over the telephone on 31 October 2014, essentially to confront him with the Nordic announcements. The first defendant could not recall the exact words that were spoken, but he was clear that in that tele-conversation, he had come to an agreement with the first plaintiff that the SPA signed by the defendants \u201cwas cancelled and would no longer be effective\u201d 71', '. At the same time, the first defendant also mentioned to the first plaintiff, firstly, that \u201cthere was still interest in agarwood and any other business deals he [ie, the first plaintiff] may have\u201d, and that parties \u201cshould pursue such other business opportunities\u201d; secondly, that both defendants would \u201ccontinue to appoint [the first plaintiff] as [their] relationship manager for the private wealth accounts that [they] had opened with UOB\u201d. The first defendant\u2019s evidence was that 72', '\u2013', '40\\u2003As for the second defendant, although he did not speak directly to the first plaintiff after the contractually stipulated completion date of 17 October 2014, he was kept informed by the first defendant of all relevant developments, including the discovery of the Nordic announcements 73', '. The second defendant testified that the first defendant had informed him \u201cthere were problems\u201d with their proposed purchase of PSL shares after seeing the Nordic announcements, and that he had authorised the latter to agree with the first plaintiff on the cancellation of the SPA 74', '. His assertion about having authorised the first defendant to agree on his behalf to the cancellation of the SPA was not refuted.', '41\\u2003It should be noted that the defendants\u2019 position was that the mention of future business opportunities did not amount to a binding promise to provide the first plaintiff with any specific business deal. The second defendant, for example, testified that as far as he was concerned, the first plaintiff was not promised anything for the cancellation of the SPA 75', '. The first defendant testified that although the first plaintiff had said that he would propose \u201cother business deals\u201d in place of the SPA, he (the first defendant) \u201cdid not promise that [he] must accept the deals\u201d: it \u201cwould have to depend on whether the deals were attractive.\u201d 76', '42\\u2003As far as the defendants were concerned, they heard nothing more of the SPA from the first plaintiff after October 2014; and he continued to serve as their relationship manager at UOB. They were shocked, therefore, when on 3 May 2018 \u2013 nearly four years later \u2013 they received a letter from the plaintiffs\u2019 solicitors demanding that they complete the transaction under the SPA 77', '.', '43\\u2003Not surprisingly, the first plaintiff denied the defendants\u2019 version of the events from mid-October 2014 onwards. In particular, he denied having agreed to the cancellation of the SPA during a tele-conversation with the first defendant on 31 October 2014. For that matter, he denied even having had a tele-conversation with the first defendant on 31 October 2014 78', '. According to the first plaintiff, \u201c[o]ver the course of October 2014 to around May 2018\u201d, he \u201ctried to contact the [d]efendants both directly and indirectly through either George Lim or Bernard Lim, to chase them to complete the sale transaction set out in the [SPA]\u201d 79', '. He claimed that the defendants were \u201cnon-committal\u201d and \u201crequested for multiple extensions of time\u201d to \u201ctake instructions\u201d from Teow. The defendants also allegedly \u201coffered to get [him] involved in business deals\/opportunities as a way of compensation for the delay in the completion\u201d, but no details were furnished of any such deals or opportunities; and in any event, he \u201ccertainly did not agree to this\u201d 80', '.', '44\\u2003The first plaintiff also claimed that in 2017, he discovered that Teow was being investigated in Malaysia for offences such as money laundering and the promotion of a pyramid scheme. He then concluded that \u201c[g]iven Tedy Teow\u2019s criminal record\u201d, it was \u201cmore likely than not that Tedy Teow and his associates, namely the [d]efendants, did not have a genuine intention of honouring their obligations under the [SPA], and their requests for more time were merely delay tactics\u201d 81', '. However, he was only able to seek legal advice in \u201cearly 2018\u201d when he managed to obtain sufficient funds from the sale of his property 82', '.', '45\\u2003As for the second plaintiff, apart from confirming that the 9.755 million PSL shares in her UOB Kay Hian account were purchased by the first plaintiff and that he was the beneficial owner of these shares 83', ', she also testified that she had never met nor spoken with the defendants; that she had left the SPA transaction entirely to the first plaintiff to handle; and that she did not know what was set out in the SPA 84', '. The first plaintiff did not deny that he was handling the SPA transaction on behalf of the second plaintiff.'"}

A permanent stay \nwould discontinue the proceedings, while a conditional stay would impose \nconditions before a prosecution can be re-instituted. \n14 In support of its argument, the Prosecution relied on Yunani and Phyllis \nTan. The three cases which preceded Phyllis Tan did not deal with the \nconstitutionality point. The Prosecution also distinguished the cases from \nEngland, Australia and New Zealand on the basis that these jurisdictions do not \nhave a similar constitutional provision. Although Article 63 of the Basic Law \nof Hong Kong vests in the Secretary of Justice the control of criminal \nprosecutions, in Lee Ming Tee ([ 10] supra), the court did not specifically \nconsider if an inherent power to stay criminal proceedings would impinge on \nArticle 63 of the Basic Law. The Prosecution\u2019s argument was thus premised on \nthe view that Art 35(8) of the Constitution confers exclusive powers on the AG \nto \u201cinstitute, conduct or discontinue proceedings\u201d. If these powers are not \nexclusively conferred on the AG, the argument that the English, Australia and \nNew Zealand authorities are inapplicable would consequently fall away. \n15 I begin my analysis by observing that the parties did not dispute that in \nEngland, Australia and New Zealand, the consistent position is that the superior \ncourts have an inherent power to stay criminal proceedings for an abuse of \nprocess. In the UK Supreme Court case of Maxwell ([ 9] supra), Lord Dyson \nJSC stated as follows at [13]:\nIt is well established that the court has the power to stay \nproceedings in two categories of case, namely (i) where it will be \nimpossible to give the accused a fair trial, and (ii) where it \nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Soh Chee Wen [2020] SGHC 186\n6offenders the court\u2019s sense of justice and propriety to be asked \nto try the accused in the particular circumstances of the case.\n16 On the rationale for any such inherent power, Lord Morris of Borth-y-\nGest observed in Connelly ([ 9] supra) at 1153: \nThere can be no doubt that a court which is endowed with a \nparticular jurisdiction has powers which are necessary to \nenable it to act effectively within such jurisdiction. I would \nregard them as powers which are inherent in its jurisdiction. A \ncourt must enjoy such powers in order to enforce its rules of \npractice and to suppress any abuses of its process and to defeat \nany attempted thwarting of its process\u2026The power (which is \ninherent in a court\u2019s jurisdiction) to prevent abuses of its process \nand to control its own procedure must in a criminal court include \na power to safeguard an accused from oppression or prejudice. \n[emphasis added] \n17 However, the position in Singapore is less clear.

Parti would pass the items to Robin, who would then pass the items to Ismail, who would then place them into the three jumbo boxes. 22', 'The same process was carried out for all three jumbo boxes. 23', 'Parti also packed her own luggage bag and hand-carry bag herself. 24', 'Mdm Ng was present at the dining area during that period of time. 25', '15\\u2003During the packing process, Mdm Ng saw an unopened piece of thermal wear in its packaging in the box and asked Parti if the item belonged to Mr Liew, to which Parti replied that the item was bought as a second-hand good at the price of $1. 26', 'Mdm Ng did not pursue it further.', '16\\u2003After the boxes were packed, Parti sealed the first box using many rounds of tape as the boxes were \u201cvery fully packed\u201d. 27', 'Parti only wrote her address on the first box. 28', 'However, before the second and third boxes were sealed, the representative from the employment agency returned and informed Parti that the time was up and that she had to leave. 29', 'At that point in time, Robin and Ismail sealed the covers of the second and third boxes in Parti\u2019s presence and \u201cdid not use much tape\u201d. 30', 'Parti asked Mrs Liew to send the three boxes to the address on the first box. 31', 'Robin testified that at the time when Parti was informed by the agent to leave, there was a mess on the floor around the dining area and the fridge area. 32', 'After the boxes were sealed, Parti demanded that Karl pay for all three boxes to be shipped back to Indonesia. 33', 'Karl initially refused but he subsequently agreed to do so after being advised by the employment agency representative to resolve the issue amicably. 34', '17\\u2003Thereafter, Parti left the house with the employment agency representatives and returned to Indonesia.', '18\\u2003After Parti left, Mdm Ng told Karl about her suspicion regarding Parti\u2019s alleged theft of the thermal wear that ostensibly belonged to Mr Liew. 35', 'Heather also voiced her concern to Karl that it was not prudent for them to be shipping three large jumbo boxes to Parti without being aware of the contents of said boxes. This is because by shipping the boxes to Parti, they would have to declare what items were being shipped. The items could potentially be illegal. 36', '19\\u2003Based on these suspicions and concerns, Mdm Ng, Karl and Heather checked the contents of the jumbo boxes at 49 CL on 29 October 2016. They opened the three boxes and discovered items in the boxes that allegedly belonged to members of the Liew household. They spent approximately two hours taking out and sorting through the items from the boxes. 37', 'A 21-second video was recorded of the items that they had taken out, which was admitted into evidence as Exhibit P28 (\u201cthe Video\u201d). 38', 'The Video footage showed Karl, Heather and Mdm Ng examining the contents of the three jumbo boxes. Grinis, the Liew family\u2019s new domestic helper, was also present at the time when the boxes were opened. 39', '20\\u2003Thereafter, Mr Liew returned to Singapore on 30 October 2016. He discussed with the rest of the Liew family regarding Parti\u2019s termination and the subsequent discovery of items in the three boxes. Mr Liew, who was accompanied by Karl, proceeded to file a police report on 30 October 2016. 40', '21\\u2003On 2 December 2016, Parti returned to Singapore and was arrested upon her arrival at the airport. 41', 'She was found in possession of the following items that allegedly belonged to the complainants (Judgment at [14]): 42', '(a)\\u2003two Longchamp bags (P1-2 and P1-3);', '(b)\\u2003one Gerald Genta watch (P1-19);', '(c)\\u2003one Helix watch (P1-18);', '(d)\\u2003two white iPhones with accessories (P1-20, P1-21 and P1-22);', '(e)\\u2003one black Braun Buffel wallet (P1-17);', '(f)\\u2003one black Gucci wallet (P1-16);', '(g)\\u2003one Prada bag (P1-42); and', '(h)\\u2003one Gucci sunglasses with red stains (P1-43).', 'These items formed part of the subject of the proceeded charges (see [6] above).', '22\\u2003Parti\u2019s defence is, in essence, a denial that any of the items listed in the four charges had been stolen. Her explanation for each of the items can be grouped broadly as follows:', '(a)\\u2003Some of the items were purchased by her;', '(b)\\u2003Some of the items were given to her;', '(c)\\u2003Some of the items were discarded and found by her; and', '(d)\\u2003Some of the items were not packed by her in the three jumbo boxes.', 'The specifics of her defence for each item will be further discussed and evaluated in the respective sections of this judgment.', '23\\u2003Additionally, when Parti was packing her things before she left on 28 October 2016, she expressed an intention to lodge a complaint with the MOM. She did not elaborate about the details of her intended complaint. This statement was heard by both Mrs Liew and Karl. 43', 'It is important to note that Parti had expressed her intention to complain to the MOM before Mr Liew filed the police report on 30 October 2016.', '24\\u2003Parti\u2019s defence is that the belated discovery of the aforementioned items in the jumbo boxes was a convenient avenue to pre-empt any complaint made by her against the Liew family. This is because a formal complaint or accusation against Parti of having committed an offence (such as through the lodging of a police report) would jeopardise the possibility of her future employment in Singapore. 44', 'The Defence submits that the Liew family had falsely alleged that Parti was a thief in a bid to prevent her from returning to Singapore and thereby stymie her future attempt to make a formal report to MOM about her illegal deployment as a maid in Karl\u2019s office and his home at 39 CL. 45'"}

{"casename":"2020_SGHC_190","fact":"'5\\u2003The Mectrade Group had its beginnings in the incorporation of Mectrade Engineering (Pte) Ltd (\u201cMEPL\u201d) sometime around 1975. It is unclear whether MEPL was set-up by CHH\u2019s late husband, one Foo Sack You (\u201cFSY\u201d), the third defendant, or both. However, it is agreed that FSY and the third defendant did enter into business together. They grew their business as close friends. In the years that followed, other companies were established and became part of the Mectrade Group. The plaintiff was one such company and was incorporated in 1998. The Mectrade Group comprised several companies; the ownership of these companies prior to FSY\u2019s demise on 14 October 2011 was as follows:', '(a)\\u2003The plaintiff \u2013 the shares were held by FSY and the first defendant in the ratio of 55:45 respectively.', '(b)\\u2003Mectrade Fabricators Pte Ltd (\u201cMFPL\u201d) \u2013 the shares were held by FSY and the third defendant in the ratio of 50:50.', '(c)\\u2003MEPL \u2013 the shares were held by FSY and the third defendant in the ratio of 50:50.', '(d)\\u2003Sen-Hong Piping and Engineering Pte Ltd \u2013 the shares were held by FSY, one Lee Hui, and the third defendant\u2019s wife in the ratio of 55:22.5:22.5 respectively.', '(e)\\u2003Mec-Sin Precision Engineering Services, which was a sole-proprietorship owned by FSY.', '(f)\\u2003Mec-Con Industries Pte Ltd (\u201cMec-Con\u201d), which was wholly owned by the defendants\u2019 family.', '6\\u2003The Mectrade Group functioned as a group for about 30 years. The companies in the Mectrade Group, in particular the first four companies listed above, operated primarily in the marine services industry. There was some overlap in terms of the nature of the work undertaken by the companies (I elaborate on this at [24] below). It is common ground that the companies in the Mectrade Group \u201cshared common resources\u201d, and that there were inter-company transactions and inter-company billings as a result.', '7\\u2003A significant part of the business of the plaintiff involved work with Dyna-Mac Engineering Services Pte Ltd (\u201cDyna-Mac\u201d). Dyna-Mac is a registered shipyard in Singapore at 45 Gul Road, Singapore 629350. As the operator of the shipyard, Dyna-Mac\u2019s business had some 40 to 50 resident contractors (\u201cRC(s)\u201d) under it who were awarded various projects from time to time depending on the nature of the skillsets and expertise that were needed. The plaintiff was one such RC, and was a contractor of Dyna-Mac between 2007 and 2014. The plaintiff undertook mainly structural works for Dyna-Mac such as steel fabrication.', '8\\u2003In accordance with regulations issued by the Ministry of Manpower (\u201cMOM\u201d), Dyna-Mac was required to sponsor foreign workers employed by its RCs. Sponsorship carried with it several obligations and responsibilities. One such obligation was Dyna-Mac\u2019s guarantee to the authorities that its RCs would perform their obligations as employers. Accordingly, if the RCs defaulted, eg, by failing to pay foreign worker levies, Dyna-Mac would be liable for the same. Two consequences followed as a result. First, Dyna-Mac exercised control over the number of foreign workers each RC employed for a given project. This was negotiated with the relevant RC. Second, each RC and its foreign workers were only allowed to work on projects for other shipyards if Dyna-Mac\u2019s permission was obtained.', '9\\u2003The third defendant and the owner of Dyna-Mac had a good personal and professional relationship. All the projects undertaken by the plaintiff for Dyna-Mac were supervised by the third defendant. Dyna-Mac was generally satisfied with the plaintiff\u2019s work. Given the relationship that the third defendant had with Dyna-Mac and the quality of its work, the plaintiff was able to secure several projects between 2007 and 2014. The plaintiff\u2019s work for Dyna-Mac concluded around 2014. This broadly coincided with the removal of the first and second defendants as directors of the plaintiff.', '10\\u2003Assisted by some of their family members, FSY and the third defendant operated the Mectrade Group together. They were the patriarchs of their respective families. FSY mainly managed the backroom. He worked in the office and handled inter alia administrative and accounting matters. The third defendant, on the other hand, was in charge of operations. He was on the ground at the relevant shipyards. The first and second defendants worked in the office and assisted FSY with the finance and accounting matters for the Mectrade Group. The Shareholders were not involved in the running of the business. While CHH was FSY\u2019s personal assistant, she was rarely present in the office. This was the arrangement until FSY passed away, suddenly, on 14 October 2011.', '11\\u2003Up until FSY\u2019s passing, FSY and the first defendant were the only two registered directors of the plaintiff. The first defendant was brought into the plaintiff\u2019s business by FSY. Upon FSY\u2019s passing, the second defendant was appointed a director of the plaintiff. The first defendant invited the second defendant to assume the role after consulting her and the third defendant. The first defendant did not see it as \u201cnatural\u201d for one of FSY\u2019s family members to succeed him as director because \u201cthey were actually not working in [the plaintiff]\u201d. I understand this to mean that the Shareholders were not involved in or familiar with the business of the Mectrade Group generally, and the plaintiff specifically.', '12\\u2003After FSY\u2019s passing, his shares in the Mectrade Group companies devolved to the Shareholders. This happened in or around early 2012. It is the plaintiff\u2019s case that at or about that time, the defendants began freezing the Shareholders out of the business of the plaintiff. The defendants, on the other hand, describe CHH as having \u201c[taken] up arms\u201d against them. The ensuing friction resulted in the commencement of several lawsuits. The disputes culminated in a settlement agreement being entered into on or about 2 March 2016 between MEPL, MFPL, the first and third defendants, and CHH (the \u201cSettlement Agreement\u201d). Under the Settlement Agreement, the first defendant\u2019s 45% shareholding in the plaintiff was transferred to CHH. No payment was provided for in the Settlement Agreement for the transfer of these shares. Further, the Settlement Agreement provided for payment by the first and second defendants to CHH of the sum of $1,600,000 for CHH\u2019s shares in MEPL. This payment was made and the shares transferred.', '13\\u2003The Settlement Agreement did not put an end to litigation between the parties. According to the defendants, CHH did not abide by her obligations under the Settlement Agreement, compelling the defendants to commence HC\/S 667\/2017 against CHH in 2017 (\u201cSuit 667\u201d). In Suit 667, the defendants claimed that CHH had not complied with the Settlement Agreement, and sought an order that CHH specifically perform her obligations therein. In retaliation, the Shareholders commenced the present action in the name of the plaintiff. Suit 667 was discontinued on 22 July 2019.', '14\\u2003As a result of the breakdown in the relationship between the Shareholders and the defendants, the first and second defendants were removed as directors of the plaintiff. On 12 September 2014, two resolutions were passed by the Shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting (\u201cEGM\u201d) of the plaintiff in the first and second defendants\u2019 absence. It was resolved that the first and second defendants be removed as directors. Notably, notice of the EGM, which had purportedly been sent to the first and second defendants, was never produced in this suit. When questioned, CHH simply stated that the notice \u201ccan be found in another file\u201d. This raised questions of whether the first and second defendants had been properly removed as directors. That said, counsel for the defendants confirmed at trial that the first and second defendants were not challenging their removal as directors.'"}

Pinnacle Development was involved in the present suit as the purchaser of 107 Namly Avenue, Singapore 267676 (the \u201cNamly property\u201d), which Mdm Liew had previously owned. 3', 'Karen, in her capacity as donee under the LPA, had sought an injunction preventing the sale of the Namly property. This was refused by Lee Seiu Kin J on 1 March 2018 and the sale went ahead. 4', 'Subsequently, the claims against Pinnacle Development were struck out in their entirety, and it ceased to be a participant in this suit. 5', '4\\u2003Karen and the defendant have had a strained relationship for some time. From the evidence, this stemmed from the time of their father\u2019s death in 1998. 6', 'At the time their father (\u201cMr Goh\u201d) passed away, he had two main assets to his name. One was the Namly property, and the other was a bungalow at Siglap Bank. Both properties were left to Mdm Liew, his spouse. Mr Goh\u2019s intentions, which Mdm Liew informed her two children she intended to honour, were that after Mdm Liew passed away, the Namly property would be given to Karen and the Siglap Bank property would be given to the defendant. 7', 'When informed of this, the defendant and his wife felt that this was unfair because there remained a substantial loan secured by a mortgage over the Siglap Bank property, as compared to the mortgage on the Namly property which had been paid off. 8', 'Apart from the housing loans over both properties, Mr Goh had taken a loan for some investments he had made, and had secured that loan by encumbering the Siglap Bank property. 9', '5\\u2003The defendant\u2019s evidence is that he had assisted Mdm Liew by agreeing to be a guarantor for the loans which remained unpaid after Mr Goh\u2019s passing. His evidence is that, because of this help, the tenure of the loans was extended, the monthly mortgage payments were reduced, and the existing mortgage on the Namly property was discharged. 10', 'In any event, Mdm Liew still found it difficult to meet the monthly payments for the mortgage on the Siglap Bank property. In 2006, before moving to Melbourne, Australia to stay with Karen and her family, Mdm Liew decided to sell the property.', '6\\u2003After Mdm Liew\u2019s husband died in 1998 but prior to her moving to Melbourne in 2006, she would alternate between staying with Karen\u2019s family at Kellock Lodge and the defendant\u2019s family at Seasons Park. 11', 'Mdm Liew did not want to live alone. Both the Namly and Siglap Bank properties were rented out. When the Namly property became vacant in 2003 because the tenant moved out, Karen\u2019s family moved into the house with Mdm Liew. 12', '7\\u2003In 2006, Karen\u2019s husband, Dr Peter Hwang (\u201cDr Hwang\u201d), got a job at a hospital in Melbourne, Australia. 13', 'Karen and her family decided to emigrate from Singapore to Australia, and she invited Mdm Liew to move there with them. Mdm Liew agreed, and sold the Siglap Bank property before she left, as described above. 14', '8\\u2003In mid-2009, Mdm Liew decided to move back to Singapore. 15', 'This was because, among other things, she missed her friends and the food in Singapore. 16', 'She asked the defendant and his family to move in with her at the Namly property, and they did so. 17', '9\\u2003In around March or April 2015, Dr Hwang left his position at the Melbourne hospital. In December 2015, he returned to Singapore to assume a position at the National Neuroscience Institute. 18', 'Karen remained in Australia with their children, who were attending school there. Her evidence is that she was planning to return to Singapore once her two daughters finished their schooling in Australia.', '10\\u2003Despite Mdm Liew having moved back to Singapore in 2009, she remained close with Karen. They spoke frequently over the phone. 19', 'Karen would travel to Singapore several times each year to see her mother. These visits to Singapore increased in 2016 because by then, Dr Hwang was working in Singapore. 20', 'In 2014, Mdm Liew executed the LPA in favour of Karen. The LPA provided that, inter alia, Karen would \u201chave authority to make decisions and act for [Mdm Liew] in respect of ALL matters relating to [Mdm Liew\u2019s] personal welfare of every description as fully and effectually as [Mdm Liew] could do if [she] had the mental capacity\u201d (emphasis original). The LPA also stipulated that: 21', '11\\u2003In the second half of 2017, Karen came back to Singapore on about five occasions. 22', 'On each return, she would stay for a period ranging from a few days up to a few weeks. She would visit and see Mdm Liew regularly during the time that she was in Singapore. Karen\u2019s visits to Mdm Liew at the Namly property would typically coincide with times when the defendant and his wife were not at home, though they were aware of such visits. Karen would also regularly take Mdm Liew out for lunch. 23', '12\\u2003Karen\u2019s evidence was that, from around June 2017, she started noticing that her mother was behaving more oddly. The evidence on this will be explored in more detail below, but it suffices for me to say at this juncture that Karen\u2019s evidence is that Mdm Liew started to exhibit some signs of mental decline and confusion.', '13\\u2003On 9 September 2017, during a visit in Singapore, Karen brought Mdm Liew to see a neurologist, Dr Ho King Hee (\u201cDr Ho\u201d). 24', 'His evidence is quite critical on the issue of Mdm Liew\u2019s mental capacity, and will be detailed in the course of this judgment. As this juncture, I need only point out that Dr Ho got Mdm Liew to take a Mini Mental State Examination (\u201cMMSE\u201d), which is a screening tool for dementia. Dr Ho\u2019s evidence is that Mdm Liew scored 26\/30 on the MMSE, which is a \u201cborderline abnormal\u201d score. 25', '14\\u2003In mid-November 2017, the defendant\u2019s evidence is that his mother had become less mobile because of weakness in her legs and could not get around without a wheelchair. 26', 'According to the defendant, Mdm Liew told him that she wanted to sell the Namly property and buy a condominium unit for her and his family to stay. She then instructed him to see a lawyer because she wanted to appoint him as an attorney to execute her instructions. 27', '15\\u2003The defendant then approached Teo Eng Thye (\u201cMr Teo\u201d), who practises under the name and style of City Law LLC, for assistance. Mr Teo prepared two irrevocable powers of attorney for Mdm Liew to execute (the \u201cPOAs\u201d). 28', 'The first of them authorised the defendant to act on Mdm Liew\u2019s behalf to sell the Namly property and have the sale proceeds paid to Daniel Goh Eng Sheng (\u201cDaniel\u201d), then 19 years\u2019 old, who is the older of the defendant\u2019s two sons. The second Power of Attorney authorised the defendant to purchase a condominium unit in Mdm Liew and Daniel\u2019s names, but the defendant was given the authority to add himself as a joint owner.', '16\\u2003 Mr Teo then visited the Namly property on 20 November 2017 and met Mdm Liew for the first time. 29', 'She executed the POAs without asking Mr Teo any questions. On 22 November 2017, the defendant granted an option to \u201cLeow Tang Lie and\/or nominees\u201d to purchase the Namly property. Leow Tang Lie was, at the material time, a director of Pinnacle Development, which had also acquired the two neighbouring houses. The option to purchase was exercised on 7 December 2017. 30', '17\\u2003 Karen attempted to contact Mdm Liew through Mdm Liew\u2019s mobile phone throughout November 2017, but was largely unsuccessful. 31', 'She was able to briefly speak to Mdm Liew on 20 November 2017, but was unable to reach her thereafter. Karen therefore asked Dr Hwang to visit Mdm Liew at the Namly property, which he did on 22 November 2017. 32', 'Dr Hwang informed Karen that Mdm Liew\u2019s condition appeared to have deteriorated significantly in that she seemed confused and disoriented. Karen continued to have difficulty contacting Mdm Liew, and had to contact Mdm Liew\u2019s domestic helper, Juwanti, in order to reach Mdm Liew. 33', '18\\u2003On 3 December 2017, the defendant, his family, and Mdm Liew moved out of the Namly property to the Capella Residence at Sentosa. 34', 'They stayed there for six weeks until mid-January 2018. They then moved to the Great World City serviced apartment. It is not disputed that for the period from December 2017 until February 2018, the defendant and his wife refused to inform Karen where they were residing or where Mdm Liew was. Instead, Karen was merely told that Mdm Liew was on \u201choliday\u201d. 35', 'A few phone calls with Mdm Liew were permitted by the defendant and his family, but Karen was specifically instructed not to ask for Mdm Liew\u2019s location. 36', 'As a result, she could not see Mdm Liew in person, despite repeated requests in person and through lawyers. There was only one occasion, on 8 December 2017, where a meeting with Mdm Liew was arranged at the Toast Box caf\u00e9 in Sentosa. The details of that meeting and how Mdm Liew behaved are relevant to the question of her mental capacity and will be delved into in more detail in the course of this judgment.', '19\\u2003After discovering, on or about 13 December 2017, that a purchasers\u2019 caveat had been lodged against the Namly property by Pinnacle Development, Karen commenced proceedings against Kelvin and the purchaser. She applied urgently for an interlocutory injunction to restrain the sale of the Namly property from being completed. 37', 'As alluded to at [3] above, this was refused as Lee Seiu Kin J was of the view that the balance of convenience was in favour of not granting an interim injunction. 38', 'Eventually, the sale was allowed to proceed, and the sale proceeds were paid into Court. As stated above, Karen\u2019s claims against Pinnacle Development were subsequently struck out, with Kelvin remaining as the sole defendant in these proceedings.', '20\\u2003In the course of those proceedings for an injunction, it was revealed by the defendant that Mdm Liew had been hospitalised at Mount Elizabeth Hospital (\u201cMEH\u201d) for some periods from December 2017 to February 2018. She was found to have suffered from pneumonia in her first admission from 16 December 2017 to 23 December 2017, chest infection with congestive cardiac failure during her second admission from 25 December 2017 to 8 January 2018, and cardiac arrhythmia with chest infection during her third admission from 15 January 2018 to 20 April 2018. 39', 'Eventually, Mdm Liew was transferred to Karen\u2019s charge, pursuant to the directions in the LPA. In April 2018, she was transferred from MEH to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (\u201cTTSH\u201d), where she came under the care of Dr Mark Chan, a Senior Consultant at TTSH\u2019s Department of Geriatric Medicine. 40', 'It is common ground between the parties that, by the time of her admission to TTSH, she was suffering from moderate to severe dementia.', '21\\u2003Mdm Liew was subsequently discharged from TTSH on 1 October 2018 into Soo\u2019s Nursing Home. 41', 'Subsequently, she passed away on 10 June 2020. This was after the trial had been heard before me from 5 February 2020 to 26 February 2020, and also after written closing and reply submissions had been exchanged. Karen was named as the sole executrix in Mdm Liew\u2019s final will dated 17 July 2007, and the Grant of Probate was issued to her on 9 July 2020. I granted leave for further submissions to be made on the effect of Mdm Liew\u2019s passing on the present action. Karen subsequently sought to be made a party to the suit and for the proceedings to be carried on as if she had been substituted for Mdm Liew pursuant to O 15, r 7(2) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, 2014 Rev Ed, R 5). This was granted on 14 July 2020. 42'"}

The Defendant has owned the Defendant\u2019s Property since 2 August 2010. The Plaintiff\u2019s purchase of the Plaintiff\u2019s Property came with an existing tenancy.', '4\\u2003In or around December 2015, the Plaintiff obtained permission from the Building and Construction Authority to convert the second to fifth storeys of the Plaintiff\u2019s Property into an approved temporary backpackers\u2019 hostel, change the use of the first storey from a temporary backpackers\u2019 hostel to a shop, and add a new fifth storey extension at the rear for office use (collectively \u201cthe Redevelopment Works\u201d).', '5\\u2003On 13 September 2016, the Plaintiff commenced proceedings against the Defendant in Suit No 974 of 2016 (\u201cthe 2016 Suit\u201d).', '6\\u2003The Plaintiff\u2019s claim in the 2016 Suit related to the Defendant\u2019s unreasonable refusal (according to the Plaintiff) to allow the Plaintiff to demolish its own boundary wall at the rear of the fifth storey. It was the Plaintiff\u2019s case that the Defendant\u2019s refusal caused the Plaintiff to have to adopt a more costly alternative construction method, thereby incurring increased construction costs and consultants\u2019 fees as well as loss of potential rental from tenancy agreements that the Plaintiff had entered into with two entities, namely Peramakan Pte Ltd (\u201cPeramakan\u201d) and The Keepers Inn Pte Ltd (\u201cKeepers Inn\u201d).', '7\\u2003The Plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim (\u201cSOC\u201d) in the 2016 Suit alleged that the Defendant and\/or its tenant had encroached onto the Plaintiff\u2019s boundary wall by mounting and\/or installing kitchen cabinets and furnishings directly onto the Plaintiff\u2019s boundary wall. Further, the metal roof on the fifth storey of the Defendant\u2019s Property and its support protruded beyond the boundary line of the Defendant\u2019s Property and encroached or trespassed upon the Plaintiff\u2019s Property.', '8\\u2003As part of the Redevelopment Works, the Plaintiff intended to demolish the existing boundary wall and to re-erect a new boundary wall seated exactly on the boundary line of the Plaintiff\u2019s Property.', '9\\u2003Mr Chew Chin Hui (\u201cChew\u201d), the Plaintiff\u2019s project manager, sent emails to the Defendant on 25 April and on 6 May 2016 to give notice that the Defendant should demolish the kitchen fittings on the boundary wall and re-locate the metal roof and support prior to the Plaintiff\u2019s demolition works. By another email dated 16 May 2016, Chew gave notice that the Defendant\u2019s refusal to remove their fittings from the boundary wall meant that the Redevelopment Works would be delayed and the Plaintiff would thereby suffer loss and damages.', '10\\u2003On 29 June 2016, the Defendant via Wong replied by letter to the Plaintiff refusing to consent to the Plaintiff\u2019s demolition of the boundary and claiming, without substantiation, that the boundary wall should logically belong to the Defendant\u2019s Property.', '11\\u2003Further, in response to the Plaintiff\u2019s SOC, the Defendant filed a defence and counterclaim not only denying that it encroached onto the Plaintiff\u2019s Property but also counterclaiming for the alleged encroachment by the Plaintiff onto the Defendant\u2019s Property by the erection of standing platforms at the encroachment area.', '12\\u2003In the interim, the Plaintiff had entered into a tenancy agreement with Peramakan dated 1 June 2016 3', 'under which the first storey of the Plaintiff\u2019s Property would be operated as a restaurant at $12,000 rent per month. Separately, it entered into a lease with Keepers Inn dated 1 July 2016 4', 'for rental of the second to fifth storeys as well as the mezzanine floor at the fifth storey and the roof terrace at $65,000 per month, to let out rooms.', '13\\u2003According to Stanley, sometime in 2017 or early 2018, he came up with the idea of using the Plaintiff\u2019s Property as a co-working space and a boutique hotel in order to maximise yield. At about the same time, Stanley was introduced to Mr Lim Wei Siong (\u201cLim\u201d), a director of Nuve Holdings Ltd (\u201cNuve\u201d), which is a hotel operator. Stanley was keen to get Nuve to operate a hotel at the Plaintiff\u2019s Property and broached the subject to Lim. However, Lim declined saying he could not commit Nuve to operating another boutique hotel as Nuve had just taken on a third boutique hotel project.', '14\\u2003In 2018, while the 2016 Suit was ongoing, the Plaintiff changed lawyers to their present solicitors who, upon taking over conduct of the proceedings, decided to amend the SOC. The draft amended SOC was forwarded to the Defendant\u2019s solicitors by the Plaintiff\u2019s solicitors on 20 June 2018. In the draft amended SOC, the Plaintiff claimed in excess of $3m for the increased construction costs due to using an alternative construction method and the resultant prolonged construction period as well as loss of rental under the tenancies with Peramakan and Keepers Inn due to the delay in completion.', '15\\u2003With a view to an amicable settlement of the dispute, both parties agreed, and proceeded, to mediation. The session was held on 26 June 2018 and chaired by a retired judge (\u201cthe Mediator\u201d) of the Supreme Court. Apart from its solicitors, the attendees from the Plaintiff\u2019s side were Stanley, Michael, Richard, and Chew (whose wife Mdm Chan Ren Tze is a shareholder of the Plaintiff). Richard left the mediation session sometime in the afternoon.', '16\\u2003Representing the Defendant at the mediation session were Wong, Mr Ng Dick Young (a professional engineer) and the Defendant\u2019s solicitors. At one stage (about 7.25pm), Mrs Wong joined the mediation session at the suggestion of the Mediator since he understood from Wong that the latter needed to consult his wife and obtain her consent to any agreement with the Plaintiff.', '17\\u2003The mediation session continued into the early hours (2.30am) of 27 June 2018 and culminated in the Settlement Agreement. 5', 'A contemporaneous attendance note of the mediation session (\u201cthe Attendance Note\u201d 6', ') drafted by Ms Mabel Wei Suying (\u201cMabel\u201d), a trainee solicitor from the Plaintiff\u2019s solicitors\u2019 firm, was produced in court; it recorded what transpired during the open sessions of the mediation when all the parties and their counsel were present together with the Mediator.', '18\\u2003In his affidavit of evidence in chief (\u201cAEIC\u201d), 7', 'Stanley recounted what transpired at the mediation session, his recollection being aided by the abovementioned Attendance Note (see [17] above).', '19\\u2003Amongst the key terms of the Settlement Agreement were the following:', '(a)\\u2003under clauses 1 to 3, the Defendant would contribute $250,000 payable in two tranches (of $100,000 and $150,000) towards the Plaintiff\u2019s cost of renovating the Defendant\u2019s Property;', '(b)\\u2003under clause 4.1, the renovations would be to the Plaintiff\u2019s desired requirements and\/or specifications (\u201cthe Renovation Works\u201d) and the Defendant would give the Plaintiff access to all floors of the Defendant\u2019s Property;', '(c)\\u2003under clause 4.2, both parties would apply for regulatory approval for change of use of the Defendant\u2019s Property for which the Plaintiff would bear all the costs and expenses with respect to the submissions and applications;', '(d)\\u2003under clause 6, the Defendant would lease the second to fifth storeys of the Defendant\u2019s Property to the Plaintiff at $8,000 per month for a term of three years with rent payable three months after 1 August 2018 on the following terms for handover to the Plaintiff:', '(e)\\u2003under clause 7, the Defendant would lease to the Plaintiff the second to fifth storeys of the Defendant\u2019s Property at the rate of $12,000 per month for two years after the expiry of the lease in [19(d)] above; and', '(f)\\u2003the parties agreed to enter into a tenancy agreement to reflect the key terms set out in [19(d)] and [19(e)] above, with the Defendant giving the Plaintiff the first option to renew the tenancy agreement at the conclusion of the first five year tenancy at the prevailing market rental rate.', '20\\u2003The terms of the Settlement Agreement (which were reflected in the Attendance Note) clearly envisaged that the Defendant\u2019s Property would be part and parcel of the Plaintiff\u2019s plan to convert the Plaintiff\u2019s Property into a boutique hotel and\/or co-working space. This was also Stanley\u2019s understanding, as seen from his deposition in his AEIC 8', 'that he intended the hotel lobby for the boutique hotel to be located on the fifth storey of the Plaintiff\u2019s Property opening out to a roof terrace. If the Plaintiff could create an access opening on that floor to the Defendant\u2019s Property, the entire fifth floor could be expanded and the Plaintiff could use the extra space either for additional rooms or an expanded rooftop terrace coupled with a trendy rooftop bar.', '21\\u2003After the execution of the Settlement Agreement, the Plaintiff resumed discussions with Lim of Nuve. On 15 July 2018, Nuve issued a letter of intent 9', '(\u201cthe Letter of Intent\u201d) to the Plaintiff stating that it intended to rent the second to fifth storeys of the Defendant\u2019s Property at $1,650 plus 10% room revenue per room per month commencing from 15 November 2018 subject to the Plaintiff entering into a tenancy agreement with the Defendant.', '22\\u2003At about the same time, the Plaintiff came to know another boutique hotel operator, Commeansure Pte Ltd (more commonly known as \u201cRed Doorz\u201d). In September 2018, Red Doorz gave the Plaintiff a letter of intent setting out their intention to operate the Plaintiff\u2019s boutique hotel at a hybrid rent\/profit arrangement, which comprised a fixed component of $46,000 rent per month plus a variable 12.5% profit sharing component (for amounts above $10,000 net profit).', '23\\u2003When Stanley conveyed Red Doorz\u2019s offer to Lim, he offered the Plaintiff the same hybrid payment arrangement with a higher fixed rent of $49,000 per month plus 10% of gross revenue less a notional fixed sum to account for operating expenses (which was later agreed at $80,000). The Plaintiff and Nuve subsequently signed a hotel management agreement for the Plaintiff\u2019s Property on 3 February 2019 (\u201cthe Hotel Management Agreement\u201d). To-date the Hotel Management Agreement for the Defendant\u2019s Property cannot be implemented because it is the Plaintiff\u2019s case that the Defendant has refused to sign a tenancy agreement with, as well as hand over the Defendant\u2019s Property to, the Plaintiff.', '24\\u2003Problems arose subsequent to the signing of the Settlement Agreement. On 5 July 2018, 10', 'Wong emailed on behalf of the Defendant to the Plaintiff to say that the first tranche of $100,000 of the Defendant\u2019s contribution of $250,000 would be paid \u201cin stages\u201d when billed. After consulting the Plaintiff\u2019s solicitors, Michael replied on behalf of the Plaintiff to the Defendant\u2019s email on the same day 11', 'rejecting the Defendant\u2019s proposal. Michael conveyed the advice from the Plaintiff\u2019s solicitors that the first instalment, for which an invoice was unnecessary, was payable in full on 1 August 2018 under clause 2 of the Settlement Agreement.', '25\\u2003Wong followed up with a second email on 18 July 2018 12', 'in which he inquired whether the Plaintiff was open to the idea of the Defendant paying the $100,000 by five monthly instalments of $20,000 each with the Plaintiff withdrawing the 2016 Suit upon the Defendant\u2019s payment of the first instalment and the Plaintiff\u2019s payment of the security deposit under the tenancy agreement.', '26\\u2003Michael replied to the Defendant on 20 July 2018 13', 'rejecting the Defendant\u2019s proposal and counter-proposing that the Defendant make payment of the $100,000 by two equal instalments of $50,000 each, payable in August and September 2018. It was only upon the Defendant\u2019s full payment of the $100,000 that the Plaintiff would withdraw the 2016 Suit. The Defendant eventually paid the $100,000 on 30 July 2018. 14', 'The Plaintiff then discontinued the 2016 suit on 8 August 2018.', '27\\u2003Michael had attached to his email of 20 July 2018 a draft tenancy agreement from the Plaintiff\u2019s solicitors (\u201cthe Plaintiff\u2019s draft TA\u201d). He stated that there should not be any security deposit for the rent as the Defendant still owed the Plaintiff $150,000 for renovation costs.', '28\\u2003On 20 July 2018, 15', 'Wong replied to Michael\u2019s email of 20 July 2018 (see [26]\u2013[27] above) stating that any draft tenancy agreement should come from the Defendant as the owner\/landlord and not from the Plaintiff tenant. He wanted to save on legal costs by not involving lawyers in the tenancy agreement. Michael replied to Wong\u2019s email on the same day requesting that the Defendant forward its draft tenancy agreement to the Plaintiff before their proposed meeting on Monday 23 July 2018.', '29\\u2003Wong followed up on 21 July 2018 16', 'with another email to Michael stating he would not be forwarding the Defendant\u2019s draft tenancy agreement. Instead, Wong would let the Plaintiff see this draft (\u201cthe Defendant\u2019s first draft TA\u201d) at their 23 July 2018 meeting. He duly did so.', '30\\u2003On 4 August 2018, Chew responded to Wong\u2019s email (see [29] above) attaching the Plaintiff\u2019s draft TA which was prepared based on the Settlement Agreement. He pointed out that there were no costs saving as the Plaintiff had already incurred legal fees in preparing the Plaintiff\u2019s draft TA and each party was in any event required to bear their own legal fees under the Settlement Agreement.', '31\\u2003On 10 August 2018, Wong repeated his earlier contention that the draft tenancy agreement should come from the Defendant as the landlord. He said he had made amendments to the Plaintiff\u2019s draft TA. He disagreed with Chew\u2019s complaint that the Defendant\u2019s first draft TA, which he had handed over to the Plaintiff at the meeting on 23 July 2018, contravened the terms of the Settlement Agreement.', '32\\u2003In his AEIC, 17', 'Michael deposed that Wong forwarded to the Plaintiff no less than six draft tenancy agreements between 23 July and 5 October 2018 with each successive draft containing fresh terms, some of which were inconsistent with or contravened the Settlement Agreement. Each of the Defendant\u2019s draft tenancy agreements will henceforth be referred to via their numerical order (that is, \u201cthe Defendant\u2019s second draft TA\u201d, \u201cthe Defendant\u2019s third draft TA\u201d, and so on).

The Amended Statement of Claim, besides revising the figure claimed downwards to S$4,971,098.65, follows, fairly consistently, the precautionary attachment stating that it was a claim for an outstanding balance for works done to the Vessel, pursuant to a contract with LCS. However, there was a very material change in the claim. It now stated that the outstanding debt was owed \u201cby the Defendants\u201d, ie, LCS and the Plaintiff. The order prayed for was that \u201cthe Defendants to jointly and severally pay the Claimant the amount of SGD 4,971,098.65 \u2026 together with legal interest at the rate of 12% from the due date up to full payment.\u201d (emphasis in bold and underlined). There was a similar prayer for \u201cthe Defendants to pay charges, costs and attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d There is no explanation or statement in the Amended Statement of Claim as to why the Plaintiff owners were jointly and severally liable together with LCS for LCS\u2019s outstanding debt to the Defendant under a contract entered into between LCS and the Defendant, other than the averment that the Plaintiff was the owner of the Vessel.', '15\\u2003The Plaintiff\u2019s solicitors, R&T, issued a Notice of Assignment (under the GA) to put the Defendant on notice of the Plaintiff\u2019s rights under the CUA. The Plaintiff\u2019s solicitors also commenced negotiations to provide security with the Defendant\u2019s solicitors. The Plaintiff\u2019s solicitors offered security in the form of a solicitor\u2019s letter of undertaking to the Defendant or a bank guarantee to be issued by a Singapore bank or a Singapore branch of an international bank which would cover the Defendant\u2019s alleged claims in full. The Defendant rejected these offers of security and insisted on security provided by a bank guarantee issued by a UAE bank or cash to be paid into the Sharjah Court.', '16\\u2003The Plaintiff contended that they had no banking arrangements in UAE and arranging for security via a bank guarantee issued by a UAE bank would cause delays. Further the Plaintiff alleged that by providing such form of security, even if the Plaintiff is held not liable but LCS is liable to the Defendant, that security would go towards satisfying the Defendant\u2019s claim against LCS.', '17\\u2003The Plaintiff also contended that the Vessel was on charter, was alongside the quay in the midst of mobilisation and preparation for a project for the Saudi Arabian Oil Company and was due to depart Port Khalid on 18 January 2018. The Plaintiff would face huge losses if the Vessel failed to leave Port Khalid on that date.', '18\\u2003The Plaintiff received the Defendant\u2019s UAE lawyers letter of 16 January 2018 stating that the Defendant\u2019s intention of arresting the Vessel was to \u201c\u2026pursue full recovery of the debts [under the CUA] before the UAE Courts, with costs, expenses and interest, to completion.\u201d', '19\\u2003The Plaintiff brought an action HC\/OS 83\/2018 and applied, inter alia, for an anti-suit injunction (\u201cASI\u201d) against the Defendant restraining it from maintaining the arrest of the vessel through the Sharjah Proceedings on the basis that the Sharjah Proceedings are oppressive and vexatious and\/or that the Sharjah Proceedings has been brought in breach of an arbitration agreement. At the ex parte stage, with the Defendant present, the Plaintiff offered and I ordered that the Plaintiff\u2019s solicitors were to give a letter of undertaking on the usual terms, to the Defendant\u2019s solicitors and the Defendants were to release the Vessel from arrest. This was to preserve the status quo and it was equivalent to the Defendant obtaining security in in rem proceedings against the vessel. This would avoid an enormous escalation of damages by preventing the Vessel from performing its obligations under the Subsea 7 bareboat charter and the Saudi Arabian Company contract. The parties then came back before me to argue whether the ASI should be granted and\/or continued. The Plaintiff based its application for an ASI on two alternative and independent grounds:', '(a)\\u2003under s 4(10) of the Civil Law Act and s 18(2) read with the First Schedule of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act on the basis that the Defendant\u2019s commencement and conduct of the Sharjah proceedings are vexatious and\/or oppressive;', '(b)\\u2003pursuant to s 12A of the International Arbitration Act read with O 69A of the Rules of Court, on the basis that the Plaintiff is enforcing its contractual rights as assignee of LCS\u2019s contractual rights under the CUA between LCS and the Defendant.'"}

{"casename":"2020_SGHC_202","fact":"'8\\u2003The collective sale process which culminated in OS 1424\/2019 began in July 2017. On 28 July 2017, the 3rd plaintiff sent an email to the then-members of the management council and representatives of various subsidiary proprietors, stating that he was of the opinion that there was a high probability of a successful enbloc sale. He therefore put up a requisition for a General Meeting, and attached requisition forms to the email for the other subsidiary proprietors to sign. 10', 'On 14 August 2017, the 3rd plaintiff sent an email to Mr Richard Boey from HBA Group Property Consultants, which was the Managing Agent, 11', 'stating that he had received requisition forms from the owners of 15 units, and that the General Meeting could accordingly be arranged. 12', 'The collective sale was thus included as an agenda item at an Annual General Meeting held on 12 December 2017 (\u201cAGM\u201d).', '9\\u2003During the AGM, the members of the CSC were elected to act on behalf of the subsidiary proprietors in the collective sale. 13', 'The plaintiffs and the defendant were among the 11 persons in total who were elected as members of the CSC. At the 1st CSC meeting held on 12 December 2017 after the AGM, the 1st plaintiff was unanimously appointed as chairperson of the CSC, Mr Phee Thian Chye (\u201cMr Phee\u201d) the co-chairperson and the 3rd plaintiff the secretary. 14', '10\\u2003At the 2nd CSC meeting held on 19 January 2018, the CSC agreed to appoint Cushman & Wakefield (S) Pte Ltd (\u201cC&W\u201d) as the marketing agent and Donaldson & Burkinshaw LLP (\u201cD&B\u201d) as the solicitors for the collective sale. 15', 'It is relevant and would be helpful at this point to set out the different methods of apportionment that were raised and discussed by the CSC, how the present method of apportionment came to be adopted by the CSC, and the involvement of the plaintiffs and C&W in the process.', '11\\u2003At the 2nd CSC Meeting, a two-tier method of apportionment (hereafter referred to as \u201cMOA1\u201d) was discussed in general terms as part of a general discussion on what would be an acceptable method of apportionment. 16', 'Under MOA1, the sale proceeds would be paid out (a) first, based on the market value of the 36 individual strata lots and (b) for the net balance of the sale proceeds to be distributed to each subsidiary proprietor in equal shares. This was on the basis of an assumption that the common property was owned jointly or severally by all the subsidiary proprietors as tenants-in-common and therefore divisible equally based on their individual share value holdings. It is relevant to point out at this juncture that the share value structure of the Development was unusual in that all subsidiary proprietors were assigned one share value, irrespective of the size of their units (see table at [3] above). As will become apparent later in these grounds, this factor was one of the main reasons contributing to the defendant\u2019s objections to the sale. 17', '12\\u2003Reverting to the facts, it was recorded in the meeting minutes of the 2nd CSC meeting that the co-chairperson Mr Phee acknowledged that the apportionment formula would be the most challenging issue to resolve. The minutes then recorded various comments and suggestions by various CSC members. For example, one unnamed CSC member commented, inter alia, that ultimately the premium received by each unit must be fair and equitable. The minutes also recorded, by way of a comment by another CSC member as a preliminary suggestion on an apportionment formula, that most of the CSC members were familiar with MOA1 as it had been discussed in a previous unsuccessful collective sale exercise, and that it was \u201cquite a good formula\u201d. 18', 'If the formula could generally be agreed on, this CSC member felt that they would have \u201csome solid ground to start working on\u201d. Another CSC member commented that first \u201c\u2026we agree on an apportionment method then we shall all abide by the method and respect the professional valuation reports\u2026\u201d. After further discussion by the CSC members, the minutes recorded the 1st Plaintiff, in her capacity as the chairperson, concluding that there was a \u201cneed to consult the professionals to see whether the apportion [sic] method mentioned by the CSC members is workable\u201d, to \u201censure that it stands [sic] the scrutiny of the Strata Title Board\u201d. Lastly, the minutes recorded that Mr Albert Ching, representing The Singapore Cancer Society (the \u201cSociety\u201d) informed the rest of the CSC that the Society would not be supporting the collective sale. 19', 'As an aside, the Society occupied a total of six office units on the 4th and 6th floors of the Development.', '13\\u2003The 3rd CSC meeting held on 7 February 2018 was the first meeting with the appointed marketing agent and solicitors, C&W and D&B respectively. It was noted in the meeting minutes that \u201cone major reason why the previous enbloc exercise failed was because the initial proposed Apportionment Formula was tweaked several times in trying to suit subsequent changes in valuation of some property units\u201d. 20', '14\\u2003At the 4th CSC meeting held on 13 April 2018, Ms Christina Sim from C&W (\u201cMs Sim\u201d) explained to the CSC that MOA1 was \u201cinequitable\u201d and would \u201cnot stand up under scrutiny at the Strata Titles Board\u201d as it resulted in a very large premium variance between the highest and smallest premiums. The minutes of this meeting recorded that after discussion and deliberation, the CSC tentatively accepted a second method of apportionment. This method was discussed and proposed during the meeting, with one abstention from Mr Albert Ching representing the Society and one objection from the defendant. 21', 'This second method of apportionment was based on a ratio of 70% valuation, 20% share value, and 10% strata area 22', '(hereafter referred to as \u201cMOA2\u201d). MOA2 gave more weight to the valuation component in light of the fact that the Development was a mixed-use development comprising retail and office units.', '15\\u2003At the 5th CSC meeting held on 18 April 2018, Mr David Mitchell of D&B (\u201cMr Mitchell\u201d) informed the CSC that if 100% approval from the subsidiary proprietors cannot be obtained, the owners would have to pay for an application for sale to be made to the STB and for an independent valuation commentary report on the chosen method of apportionment. Mr Mitchell also explained that the STB\u2019s role is to mediate, and if objections to a sale are not withdrawn, the STB would issue a Stop Order. Ms Sim added that the CSC must appoint a valuer, who will comment on whether the method of apportionment adopted was fair and equitable taking into account the circumstances of the Development. 23', 'Ms Sim informed the CSC that based on comments from experts in other cases she was involved in, the \u201cvariance band should not be more than 20%\u201d, and that unless 100% consensus was achieved amongst all of the subsidiary proprietors, C&W will face difficulty in finding a valuer to endorse MOA2 which had a variance band which was higher than 20%. Mr Mitchell cautioned the CSC that it would be difficult for the sale to proceed if the independent valuation expert did not support whichever was the chosen method of apportionment. The chosen method had to be fair and equitable as an application to the STB would be required and there was also the possibility of an application to the High Court. Several apportionment permutations were then presented to the CSC for discussion and deliberation. 24', '16\\u2003I pause at this point to set out Ms Sim\u2019s explanation of the premium variance test which she referred to in her advice to the CSC. In a nutshell, the premium variance is the difference between the highest premium that a subsidiary proprietor would obtain and the lowest premium that another subsidiary proprietor would obtain in the same development based on a particular collective sale price and the chosen method of apportionment of the proceeds from the collective sale. In simple terms, a premium is represented mathematically as follows: 25', 'Where:', 'A: Represents the proceeds of sale that a subsidiary proprietor would stand to receive for his unit under the collective sale by using the specified method of apportionment; and', 'B: Represents the valuation of that said unit', '17\\u2003The concept of the premium variance test was explained by Ms Sim as follows 26', ':', 'The underlying principle behind the [premium variance test] is to narrow the premium variance so as to ensure that all owners gain near-similar premiums from this collective sale. A large premium variance would suggest that certain units are obtaining far more premium from the sale price than the other units, which may make it inequitable to these other units. In short, a large premium variance suggests that certain units are enjoying an advantage at the expense of others. It is a good indicator of whether the MOA chosen is fair.', 'This explanation is, I note, consistent with the analysis undertaken by Tan Siong Thye J in Deorukhkar Sameer Vinay and others v Quek Chin Kheam [2018] SGHC 171 (\u201cThe Albracca\u201d), at [49]\u2013[54]. Applying the premium variance test, MOA1 would give a premium variance of 130% based on the original reserve price of $165 million, and a premium variance of 106% based on the revised reserved price of $148 million (see [22] below). In contrast, MOA2 would result in a premium variance of 53% based on the original reserve price, and a premium variance of 48% based on the revised reserved price. 27', '18\\u2003At the 6th CSC meeting held on 2 May 2018, Mr Phee, the CSC co-chairperson, explained that some of the owners in the Development may be \u201cfixated\u201d on MOA1 and may not agree to MOA2. He suggested tweaking MOA2 slightly to get more owners onboard. The 1st plaintiff opined that MOA1 had a \u201cvery high premium variance and the retail units may not support such a method\u201d. She also stated that it \u201cmay not be able [to] stand up to the scrutiny of the Strata Titles Board\u201d. Ms Sim added that it may be challenging to engage a third party independent valuer to provide a commentary in respect of and to endorse MOA1. After deliberation, the CSC agreed to proceed with a conditional collective sale agreement on the basis of MOA2, which agreement would require 100% consensus to be obtained from all the owners within four weeks. 28', '19\\u2003At the 7th CSC meeting held on 20 June 2018, Ms Sim provided an update to the CSC that only 24 out of 36 owners had signed the conditional agreement, representing 68% of strata area and 66.67% of share values. The four-week period to obtain 100% consensus had lapsed on 19 June 2018, with no unanimous consent to the conditional agreement. 29', 'The CSC then decided to proceed to convene an Extraordinary General Meeting (\u201cEGM\u201d) to, inter alia, vote on the collective sale. It was agreed that the EGM would take place on 17 July 2018.', '20\\u2003At the EGM held on 17 July 2018, MOA2 with a reserve sale price of $165 million was put to a vote. The quorum of the meeting was reached with owners representing 21 of the total of 36 share values present. 30', 'Of the votes cast, owners representing 19 out of 21 share values voted in favour, two share values voted against and six share values were void. Based on the voting results, the reserve sale price was set at $165 million and MOA2 was adopted as the method of apportionment of the sale proceeds. 31', 'It is worth mentioning at this point that based on the EGM minutes of meeting, no one raised any questions as to why MOA1 was not being adopted. This was despite Mr Phee\u2019s comment at the 6th CSC meeting that a number of owners were fixated with MOA1 and may not agree to MOA2 (see [18]), and his earlier email of 16 April 2018 to various CSC members that, inter alia, many other office unit owners may not agree to \u201chaving to discard\u201d MOA1. More will be said about this later in these grounds.', '21\\u2003By 7 December 2018, subsidiary proprietors making up 88.26% of strata area and 88.89% of share value had signed the Collective Sales Agreement (the \u201cCSA\u201d). As the requisite thresholds under the LTSA had been met, the Development was accordingly put up for sale. 32', 'At the close of tender on 21 February 2019, only one firm bid was received for $133 million, which was well below the reserve price of $165 million. 33', '22\\u2003At the 12th CSC meeting on 10 April 2019 (following a meeting of the subsidiary proprietors on 20 March 2019), the CSC was advised by C&W that consent had been obtained from subsidiary proprietors representing 81.17% of strata area and 83.3% of share value to enter into a supplemental agreement (\u201cSupplemental Agreement\u201d), agreeing to a revised reserve price of $148 million. 34', 'This downward revision was largely due to the fact that the one firm bid received for the Development was only for $133 million, as against an assessment by Savills Valuation and Professional Services (S) Pte Ltd (\u201cSavills\u201d) of $132 million. 35', '23\\u2003Negotiations then ensued with a prospective purchaser, The Place Holdings Ltd (\u201cThe Place Holdings\u201d), who eventually made an offer at the revised reserve price. On or about 16 April 2019, C&W received a cashier\u2019s order from The Place Holdings for the sum of $1.48 million, representing 1% of the purchase price. 36', 'On 18 April 2019, The Place Holdings informed the CSC that it had nominated the Purchaser to take over as tenderer. 37', 'On 22 April 2019, D&B wrote to the Purchaser, stating that they were instructed to accept the Purchaser\u2019s offer to purchase the Development at the revised reserved price, under the terms and conditions as negotiated between the parties and encapsulated in a sale and purchase agreement dated 22 April 2019. 38', 'At a CSC meeting on 26 April 2019, C&W advised that the Development had been sold at the revised reserve price. 39', '24\\u2003At the time of the application to the STB (see [3] above), subsidiary proprietors representing 87% of the total strata area and 86.11% of the share value in the Development had signed the CSA and the Supplemental Agreement. 40', 'The CSA utilised MOA2 as the method of apportionment of the sale proceeds. 41', 'As there was no unanimous consent and the STB\u2019s attempt to mediate a resolution of the dispute between the CSC and the objectors was unsuccessful, a stop order was eventually issued by the STB on 7 November 2019.

First, he submitted that the CSC and the marketing agent C&W did not conduct themselves in good faith in the process of arriving at the method of apportionment of the sale proceeds (the \u201cfirst objection\u201d).

{"casename":"2020_SGHC_204","fact":"'4\\u2003NOWM is a company in the business of treating marine and land-based \u201cslop\u201d, a collective term to describe a liquid mixture of water, hydrocarbons and solids. 1', 'This is to be distinguished from \u201csludge\", which describes semi-liquid slurry waste oil sediments. 2', 'At the material time, NOWM did not have its own slop collection operation and relied entirely on contractors to collect and deliver slop to its MARPOL 1 Marine Waste Management Reception Centre (\u201cNOWM\u2019s plant\u201d or \u201cthe plant\u201d). Once there, the slop is treated within reactor tanks which separate the sediment, oil and water in the slop via a process involving heating and settlement. 3', 'Besides the revenue earned from receiving and treating marine and land-based slop, NOWM profits from selling recycled fuel oil (\u201cRFO\u201d) extracted from the slop.', '5\\u2003Prosper Marine\u2019s commercial relationship with NOWM dates back to the time of its incorporation in 2002. A \u201cone-stop centre\u201d for various maritime services including the collection, transport and disposal of marine slop within Singapore port limits, 4', 'Prosper Marine had a longstanding practice of treating its marine slop at NOWM\u2019s plant. I pause to observe that the only other National Environment Agency (\u201cNEA\u201d)-approved slop reception facility in Singapore belongs to Singapore Cleanseas Pte Ltd (\u201cCleanseas\u201d). 5', 'In addition to disposing marine slop at NOWM\u2019s plant, Prosper Marine would purchase RFO produced at the plant, which it would resell to its customers outside Singapore at a mark-up of approximately 15%. 6', '6\\u2003The parties\u2019 symbiotic commercial arrangement depended heavily on a finely balanced system of capacity management. The process begins with slop being delivered by Proper Marine\u2019s slop tankers to the reactor tank. Once full, the slop in the tank is heated by steam piped through an array of heating tubes at the base of the tank. The slop surrounding the tubes get heated up and rise to the top of the tank while the cooler slop flows down. This convection process ensures the slop is evenly heated. The elevated temperature promotes separation of the oil from the water. The oil, being of lower density, rises to the top. Solid matter, being the densest, descends to the bottom. Water remains in between. Separation may take anything from a few days to a week or more. When it is completed, the oil is removed to be stored in RFO tanks to await collection by RFO tankers. The water would be piped to the on-site wastewater treatment plant where it will be treated to the level of purity required by NEA and before it is discharged into the sea. NOWM had seven reactor tanks and three RFO tanks. 7', 'NOWM relied on Prosper Marine to maintain sufficient capacity in its fleet of RFO tankers to remove the RFO from the RFO tank. If the RFO tank is full, then the oil from a reactor tank cannot be discharged into the RFO tank. And if the reactor tank is full, NOWM would not be able to receive slop brought in by Prosper Marine\u2019s slop tankers. This is further complicated by two factors. The first is that the plant has a jetty which is affected by the tides which means that vessels bringing slop or removing RFO might be delayed on this account. The second is that the processing time for oil\/water separation is sometimes affected by the quality of the slop brought in and it is not uncommon for separation in a particular tank to take a much longer period to complete. Therefore, given the number of reactor tanks and RFO tanks, as well as the processing time to separate the oil from the water in the slop, there would need to be a certain rate at which Prosper Marine is required to remove the RFO and deliver slop in order for the plant to operate at optimum level. The commercial arrangement between the parties was as precarious as it was complementary. Despite this, the early years of the parties\u2019 relationship were smooth sailing.', '7\\u2003The first notable hiccup arose in 2007 when a fire broke out at NOWM\u2019s plant. NOWM was suspended from receiving marine slop for a year (from 2007 to 2008). During this time, Prosper Marine discharged marine slop at Cleanseas\u2019 facility instead. 8', 'After NOWM\u2019s licence was restored, Prosper Marine would deposit marine slop at Cleanseas when there was a processing issue at NOWM\u2019s plant. 9', 'There were also times when Prosper Marine would have more slop to collect from its customers than what its tankers could carry. In those situations, they arranged for Cleanseas, which had its own slop collection vessels, to collect the slop and finally treat it at their plant. 10', '8\\u2003Importantly, however, business with Cleanseas was never considered to be a long-term solution. Cleanseas was Prosper Marine\u2019s direct competitor. 11', 'With its own slop collection vessels, Cleanseas had its own customer base for the sale of RFO and naturally prioritised its own jobs over Prosper Marine\u2019s. 12', 'Cleanseas\u2019 treatment services were also more expensive than NOWM\u2019s. Up until 2014, Cleanseas charged Prosper Marine $13 per cubic metre (\u201ccbm\u201d) of marine slop discharged at its plant and imposed a minimum charge of $2,400 on the total volume of slop discharged. 13', 'In contrast, NOWM only charged $3 per cbm of slop. 14', '9\\u2003The 2007 fire also affected NOWM. Two of its slop processing reactor tanks (Tanks A and B) were damaged, compromising the plant\u2019s overall slop processing capacity. This eventually prompted Prosper Marine to request for NOWM to refurbish these tanks . 15', 'NOWM agreed, on condition that it would receive a minimum monthly revenue of $54,000 from slop discharge over two years to defray its costs. 16', 'Prosper Marine guaranteed this $54,000 figure by offering to deliver 18,000 cbm of slop for treatment at NOWM\u2019s plant every month, at a rate of $3 per cbm of slop. Additionally, Prosper Marine agreed to pay liquidated damages of $3 for every cbm of shortfall. The parties agreed to these terms via a letter dated 26 May 2010: 17', '10\\u2003The finalised arrangement was in effect from March 2011 to March 2013. 18', 'Yet, even after March 2013, Prosper Marine continued to pay NOWM a monthly fee of $54,000 for discharging slop at NOWM\u2019s plant. 19', 'According to NOWM, this was done on the understanding that this would help to defray the costs of slop treatment operations. 20', 'The benefit of this arrangement for Prosper Marine was that it continued to receive a preferential rate for slop disposal vis-\u00e0-vis the rate being offered at Cleanseas. 21', '11\\u2003There was one other notable aspect of the parties\u2019 commercial arrangements. Since at least 2003, NOWM had extended multiple lines of credit to Prosper Marine. 22', 'This had allowed Prosper Marine to, among other things, 23', 'continue purchasing RFO from NOWM for reselling to its customers. 24', 'But the credit extended by NOWM had limits. NOWM\u2019s ability to extend this credit depended on how much trade insurance its insurer, Atradius Credit Insurance NV (\u201cAtradius\u201d), was prepared to cover. Atradius\u2019 willingness, in turn, was determined by the size of Proper Marine\u2019s debt to NOWM. 25', 'In other words, Prosper Marine\u2019s access to credit depended heavily on its ability to manage its debts to NOWM. 26', 'As I shall explain, Prosper Marine was clearly unable to do so.', '12\\u2003As of February 2013, Prosper Marine was heavily in arrears, owing NOWM some $10.63m. 27', 'In an attempt to rectify this, Prosper Marine proposed a payment schedule promising monthly payments of at least $2m between April 2013 to October 2013 (\u201cApril 2013 Agreement\u201d). 28', 'This was done with a view to bringing the accounts receivable balance (\u201cAR Balance\u201d) down to $6m, which would have brought the balance comfortably below the $7m trade credit limit later set by Atradius. 29', 'However, the plan proved too optimistic, and Prosper Marine eventually failed to honour the agreement. 30', 'As of January 2014, the AR balance remained at around $9m. 31', 'This would be the first of many (failed) attempts to manage Prosper Marine\u2019s debts.', '13\\u2003Against this backdrop, the parties entered into two contracts on 5 May 2014 (the \u201c2014 Contracts\u201d) to formalise and mirror their business relationship. The first of these pertained to the disposal of marine slop and\/or sludge at the NOWM plant (\u201cthe Disposal Contract\u201d). 32', 'The second concerned the sale of RFO (\u201cthe RFO Contract\u201d). 33', '14\\u2003The Disposal Contract governed Prosper Marine\u2019s discharge of waste slop and sludge at NOWM\u2019s wharf. The 2014 Contract suits centred on four main parts of the contract. The first was a minimum volume obligation. Pursuant to cl 2.6, para 1.1 of Schedule 1 and para 1.5 of Schedule 1, Prosper Marine undertook to deliver for treatment at least 18,000 cbm of waste slop every month (at a rate of $3 per cbm) and further, to pay $3 for every cbm of shortfall. In this sense, the Disposal Contract was very much a continuation of the parties\u2019 May 2010 business arrangement (see [9] above). Clause 2.6 is reproduced below: 34', 'Prosper Marine was also obliged, pursuant to cl 4.3, to make prompt payments to NOWM, \u201cwithout withholding, set-off, counterclaim or any other deduction of any nature whatsoever\u201d. 35', '15\\u2003Second, in the event of non-payment, NOWM was granted several entitlements under the Disposal Contract. These are set out in cl 4.5: 36', 'Conversely, cl 5.1 entitled Prosper Marine to challenge invoices issued by NOWM where there was a bona fide dispute. This was subject to Prosper Marine providing written notice of the nature of the dispute within seven days of receipt of the invoice along with any relevant details. 37', '16\\u2003Third, the Disposal Contract provided for both a minimum and maximum loading rate for slop discharge at NOWM\u2019s plant (see cl 6.5). The minimum loading rate was 50 m3 per hour while the maximum was 100 m3 per hour. 38', 'The minimum and maximum loading rates were to form the two poles of a safety range. That is, it was contractually agreed between the parties that, in the interest of safety, slop should be discharged at a rate between 50 to 100 m3 per hour. 39', 'Prosper Marine also undertook to exercise due diligence in maintaining the rate of discharge between the specified rates and was \u201cliable to [NOWM] for any loss, damage or injury arising out of the failure of [Prosper Marine\u2019s] Vessel to maintain or observe the \u2026 maximum discharge rate\u2026\u201d 40', '17\\u2003Fourth, certain clauses under the Disposal Contract indemnified NOWM against liability: 41', '18\\u2003The crux of the RFO Contract is found at Schedule 1 wherein the parties agreed to the following: 42', '19\\u2003Several of the provisions in the RFO Contract mirror those in the Disposal Contract. For example, NOWM had the option of charging Prosper Marine late payment interest (under cl 5.5). It was also entitled to \u201cimmediately suspend the performance or any further performance of its obligations under [the RFO Contract] without any liability to [Prosper Marine], whatsoever, howsoever caused\u201d. 43', '20\\u2003Besides this, there are several other terms of interest. It is notable that under cl 3.2, NOWM made no representation or warranty as to the quality of its RFO 44', 'save that it would correspond in quality with the samples taken from Prosper Marine\u2019s vessels (cl 3.1). 45', 'NOWM was also at liberty to direct Prosper Marine to take delivery of RFO from its plant at any time on any working day by way of a \u201cSales cum Delivery Order\u201d in writing or a notification. All verbal communications were to be confirmed in writing (cl 2.7). 46', 'Prosper Marine in turn undertook to take delivery of the RFO within two working days or a later date as agreed, pursuant to cl 2.8. 47', 'It was also required to raise any disputes as to the quality of NOWM\u2019s RFO within three working days of delivery, together with details of the loss and\/or damage suffered and other relevant details (cl 12.4). 48', '21\\u2003There was no provision for NOWM to give notice of its suspension of performance and cl 6.1 excluded claims against NOWM \u201carising out of the demurrage, detention or port dues\u201d. 49', 'Prosper Marine was also entitled to raise any disputes on invoices issued by NOWM within 14 days of receipt by way of notice together with relevant details (cl 5.6). 50', '22\\u2003As stated earlier, the April 2013 Agreement ultimately fell through (see [12] above) and by October 2013, the AR balance had ballooned to $9.1m, 51', 'significantly in excess of the original $6m target (set by NOWM) and the $7m trade credit limit (set by Atradius). Consequently, Prosper Marine sought to secure a bank guarantee from United Overseas Bank (\u201cUOB\u201d) in NOWM\u2019s favour. 52', 'This was obtained in March 2014 (the \u201c2014 UOB Guarantee\u201d), guaranteeing a sum of up to $2m and being valid from 14 February 2014 to 13 February 2015. 53', 'Prosper Marine subsequently secured a further guarantee from UOB dated 21 April 2015 (the \u201c2015 UOB Guarantee\u201d). 54', 'On NOWM\u2019s insistence, Prosper Marine renewed the 2015 UOB Guarantee on 31 March 2016, thereby extending it to 20 April 2017. 55', '23\\u2003Despite the issuance of the 2014 UOB Guarantee, Prosper Marine\u2019s AR balance continued to escalate throughout 2014. This directly threatened NOWM\u2019s trade insurance coverage. As such, in a letter dated 6 June 2014, NOWM requested a minimum of $1.6m to be paid every month in order to bring down the AR balance. 56', 'In that regard, Prosper Marine was told at a meeting between the parties\u2019 representatives on 4 August 2014 that its AR balance of about $9m had to be brought down to $7m. 57', '24\\u2003Following negotiations, the parties reached an agreement on repayment, the details of which were recorded in the following manner in an email from Mr Lim Teck Kee, NOWM\u2019s finance manager from 2012 to 2015, (the \u201c20 January 2015 Email\u201d): 58', '25\\u2003It is not surprising why NOWM was so keen to reduce Prosper Marine\u2019s large AR balance. As noted at [11] above, the credit limit extended to Prosper Marine depended on the amount of trade insurance coverage provided to NOWM by Atradius. Pursuant to the terms of this insurance policy, invoices had to be paid within 210 days (i.e. the sum of a maximum extension period (\u201cMEP\u201d) of 150 days and a maximum credit term of 60 days). 59', 'Failing this, there would be an automatic stoppage of insurance coverage 60', 'and NOWM would not be insured for any loss sustained in relation to invoices submitted at the expiry of the MEP 61', '.', '26\\u2003Unfortunately, by 31 March 2015, three invoices totalling $535,354.12 remained outstanding beyond the MEP. 62', 'Atradius\u2019 coverage was therefore suspended for all new invoices issued by NOWM to Prosper Marine on credit terms from 1 April 2015. 63', 'NOWM was caught in a difficult position. On one hand, there was good reason to withhold further business from Prosper Marine, lest it dug itself into a bigger hole. On the other hand, it was necessary for Prosper Marine to resell RFO and collect slops for discharge at NOWM in order to generate revenue that could go towards paying down the AR balance. 64', 'On balance, NOWM decided to continue its business with Prosper Marine but sought to minimise its exposure to risks from new transactions. Thus, with effect from July 2015, NOWM decided to impose a credit hold on Prosper Marine such that subsequent RFO purchases by the company were strictly on cash terms. 65', '27\\u2003By 11 May 2015, Prosper Marine was once again behind on its payment commitments. 66', 'In another attempt to reduce its AR balance, Prosper Marine executed a deed for \u201cSale & Purchase of the Vessel \u2018Prosper 9\u2019\u201d (\u201cthe Deed\u201d) on 12 August 2015. 67', 'Under cl 3.1 of the Deed, the purchase price of $7.5m was to be applied in the following manner: 68', '(a)\\u2003 $5,817,400 to settle the outstanding mortgage on Prosper 9; and', '(b)\\u2003 $1,682,600 to set-off Prosper Marine\u2019s outstanding liabilities as set out in Schedule B of the Deed.', '28\\u2003NOWM (or its nominee) also agreed to charter Prosper 9 back to Proper Marine for slop\/sludge collection operations at a monthly hire of $120,000 for a period of 36 months (cl 8.1 of the Deed). 69', 'Pursuant to this agreement, NSL Oilchem Marine Pte Ltd (\u201cNOM\u201d), NOWM\u2019s nominee company, entered into the \u201cBIMCO Standard Bareboat Charter, Code Name: \u2018BARECON 2001\u2019\u201d (the \u201cCharterparty\u201d) on 27 August 2015. 70', 'Prosper Marine was to make payment of its monthly charter fees in a lump sum, no later than every 30 running days in advance. 71', 'Delays would result in a 1% late payment interest (cl 11 of the Charterparty). Moreover, failure to make payment in accordance with cl 11 would entitle NOM to terminate the Charterparty and repossess Prosper 9 (cl 28(a)(i) and 29 of the Charterparty). 72', '29\\u2003During the charter period, Prosper Marine was to maintain Prosper 9 in (i) a good state of repair; (ii) efficient operating condition; and (iii) in accordance with good commercial maintenance practice (cl 10 of the Charterparty). 73', 'Prosper Marine was also required to keep Prosper 9\u2019s \u201c[c]lass fully up to date with the Classification Society\u201d specified in the Charterparty, ie, Bureau Veritas, as well as maintain necessary certificates (cl 10(a)(i)). 74', 'By way of background, Bureau Veritas is a classification society appointed by the Marine Port Authority (\u201cMPA\u201d) to perform statutory certification and survey services for Singapore-flagged vessels. 75', 'A certification by Bureau Veritas is necessary for vessels, such as Prosper 9, to legally operate in Singapore waters. 76', '30\\u2003Lastly, upon expiration\/termination of the Charterparty, Prosper Marine was to redeliver Prosper 9 \u201cin the same state and condition as she was delivered \u2026 at the commencement of [the charter], ordinary fair wear and tear excepted\u201d (cl 38 of the Charterparty). 77', 'This included \u201call outfit, equipment and appliances\u201d on-board Prosper 9 as at 25 August 2015 (cl 10(f) of the Charterparty). 78', '31\\u2003Shortly after signing the Charterparty, NOM came to know of potential maintenance issues with Prosper 9. In that regard, NOM engaged Captain Thanabalasingam s\/o Balakrishnan (\u201cCaptain Thana\u201d) as a consultant to advise it as well as to liaise with surveyors in relation to the maintenance of Prosper 9 and her class certification. This role extended to monitoring the vessel\u2019s Bureau Veritas survey status reports. A report of particular interest was Bureau Veritas\u2019 attestation to the condition of the ship following an inspection on 19 September 2016 (the \u201c19 September Report\u201d). 79', 'This report listed some 37 outstanding deficiencies on Prosper 9. Prosper Marine had to address these issues as a condition for class certification. 80', 'Besides this, OHC Shipmanagement Pte Ltd carried out a separate survey, revealing further problems with Prosper 9, 81', 'and the inspection report issued by Petrotech Marine Consultants Pte Ltd (\u201cPetrotech\u201d) identified still further issues. 82', '32\\u2003Even with the sale of Prosper 9, Prosper Marine\u2019s AR balance as of August 2015 remained significantly above its stipulated credit limit. 83', 'It was also unable to catch up with its running breaches of the MEP on outstanding invoices. NOWM therefore considered it necessary to take even greater steps to minimise its exposure. In line with these considerations, Mr Raymond Tay Chun Yee (\u201cMr Raymond\u201d), who had taken over as NOWM\u2019s finance manager in June 2015, secured confirmation (via an email dated 17 September 2015) that Prosper Marine would (i) give a joint and several guarantee by its shareholders and directors in NOWM\u2019s favour (\u201cdeed of guarantee\u201d); and (ii) allow a second charge on its properties as collateral on the outstanding AR balance. 84', '33\\u2003Accordingly, Mr Ong Cheng Ho (\u201cMr Ong\u201d or \u201cAlbert Ong\u201d), Miss Eileen Ong (\u201cMiss Ong\u201d) and Mr Daniel Lee (collectively, the \u201cProsper Directors\u201d) executed a \u201cDeed of Guarantee and Indemnity of the Obligations of Prosper Marine Pte Ltd to NSL Oilchem Waste Management Pte.

The main change in respect of the Disposal Contract was that the fixed monthly sum of $54,000 which Prosper Marine had been paying for slop treatment (see [14] above) was replaced with a new fee structure based on the amount of marine slop discharged each month. The relevant changes to Schedule 1 of the Disposal Contract are reproduced below. 90', 'The 24 March letter clarified that all other terms within the Disposal Contract would remain valid. 91', '36\\u2003Schedule 1 of the RFO Contract also saw notable changes. While Prosper Marine had previously been obliged to purchase, at NOWM\u2019s option, 4,000 to 4,500 cbm of RFO per month (see [18] above), the 24 March letter stipulated that Prosper Marine would only have to purchase as much RFO as that extracted from the slop it discharged at NOWM\u2019s plant every month: 92', '37\\u2003As acknowledged by Mr Ong in cross-examination, the effect of the above changes was to link the amount of slop discharged by Prosper Marine to its monthly RFO collection. 93', '38\\u2003Despite all of this, Prosper Marine continued to fall behind on payments due to NOWM\/NOM. 94', 'Additionally, it continually tried to renegotiate the terms that had been set out in the 24 March letter. 95', 'It also transpired that the Properties were not worth $2m, as initially represented. 96', 'They were therefore insufficient forms of security.

{"casename":"2020_SGHC_208","fact":"'8\\u2003In 2006, a group of companies known as the Cairn Group restructured its Indian assets. As part of that restructuring, a British company known as Cairn UK Holdings Ltd (\u201cCUHL\u201d) transferred most of those assets to an Indian company known as Cairn India Limited (\u201cCIL\u201d). The Cairn Group carried out the restructuring by having CIL undergo an initial public offering (\u201cIPO\u201d) in India and then use the proceeds to acquire the Cairn Group\u2019s Indian assets from CUHL through a series of share purchases and share swaps.', '9\\u2003The plaintiff\u2019s position has always been that this restructuring is a tax abusive transaction and that the resulting capital gain of about US$3.9bn in CUHL\u2019s hands has been subject to Indian capital gains tax from 2006.', '10\\u2003Under Indian revenue law, the plaintiff is entitled to recover the tax which it claims to be due either from CUHL as a capital gains tax or from CIL as a withholding tax. In any event, neither company has paid the tax. The plaintiff has accordingly treated both CUHL and CIL as assessees-in-default since 2006. 4', '11\\u2003In 2011, the Cairn Group sold 100% of CIL to the defendant and its group of companies.', '12\\u2003In 2015, the Indian revenue authorities issued a tax assessment order against CUHL and another against CIL (the \u201cAssessment Orders\u201d). 5', '13\\u2003The Vedanta Arbitration and the Cairn Arbitration are the direct result of the Assessment Orders. The two arbitrations have a number of common features. Both arbitrations arise from the same underlying transaction. Both are brought under the bilateral investment treaty (\u201cBIT\u201d) known as the Agreement between the Government of the Republic of India and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for the Promotion and Protection of Investments signed on 14 March 1994 (\u201cIndia-UK BIT\u201d). 6', 'Both are administered by the Permanent Court of Arbitration (\u201cPCA\u201d).

The Cairn Arbitration is seated in the Netherlands. Cairn\u2019s case is that the Assessment Order against CUHL is contrary to CUHL\u2019s legitimate expectations in 2006 that the Cairn Group\u2019s restructuring that year did not attract any liability for capital gains tax under Indian revenue law. 8', '16\\u2003The defendant commenced arbitration against the plaintiff in November 2015. The Vedanta Arbitration is seated in Singapore. The defendant\u2019s case in the arbitration is that it had a legitimate expectation in 2011 that the Cairn Group\u2019s restructuring in 2006 had not attracted any tax liability on a capital gain in the hands of CUHL.', '17\\u2003Because both arbitrations arise from the same underlying transaction and under the same BIT, the plaintiff is concerned about the risk of inconsistent findings by the two tribunals. Inconsistent findings are not only a possibility on the merits of the parties\u2019 disputes 9', 'but also on jurisdictional issues common to both arbitrations. 10', 'The plaintiff\u2019s position is that, in order to mitigate this risk, a regime is needed in both arbitrations to permit cross-disclosure of documents between the two arbitrations.', '18\\u2003This application arises out of the plaintiff\u2019s efforts to put such a regime in place in both arbitrations. The background to this application therefore requires an examination of four of the many procedural orders in both arbitrations: one procedural order issued in the Cairn Arbitration and three issued in the Vedanta Arbitration. I now summarise these four procedural orders.', '19\\u2003In September 2017, on the plaintiff\u2019s application, the Cairn tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 10 (\u201cCPO 10\u201d). CPO 10 set out the Cairn tribunal\u2019s cross-disclosure regime. CPO 10 allows cross-disclosure with the consent of the opposing party or with the permission of the tribunal.', '20\\u2003One of the premises of CPO 10 is that the parties to an investment-treaty arbitration are subject to no general obligation of confidentiality under the law of the Netherlands as the Cairn Arbitration\u2019s lex arbitri. 11', 'As a result, CPO 10 is premised on a regime of open document disclosure. It therefore includes express language that the Cairn tribunal will uphold objections to disclosure only rarely. In particular, in describing a party\u2019s right to object to disclosure, CPO 10 provides as follows at para 24(b): 12', '21\\u2003In May 2018, also on the plaintiff\u2019s application, the Vedanta tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 (\u201cVPO 3\u201d). VPO 3 is the Vedanta tribunal\u2019s analogue of CPO 10. VPO 3, like CPO 10, allows cross-disclosure with the consent of the opposing party or with the permission of the tribunal. VPO 3, however, proceeds on a slightly different premise to CPO 10.', '22\\u2003One of the premises of VPO 3 is that the parties to an investment-treaty arbitration are subject to a general obligation of confidentiality under Singapore law as the Vedanta Arbitration\u2019s lex arbitri. 13', 'The Vedanta tribunal nevertheless held in VPO 3 that the general obligation of confidentiality under Singapore law is subject to an exception which permits the tribunal to consider cross-disclosure on a case-by-case basis. 14', 'The Vedanta tribunal preferred a case-by-case approach to the approach advocated by the plaintiff, which would have given the parties a general licence to make cross-disclosures. 15', '23\\u2003Consistent with these holdings, paras 129.3 and 129.4 of VPO 3 set out the general rule and then the exception: 16', '24\\u2003The cross-disclosure regime in VPO 3 is quite similar to that in CPO 10 (see [19] above). 17', 'Both regimes eschew a general licence to both parties to make cross-disclosure in favour of a case-by-case approach. Both regimes thus require a party seeking to make cross-disclosure, in the event of opposition, to apply to the tribunal for permission to make the cross-disclosure. The sole difference between CPO 10 and VPO 3 is who carries the burden on any such application. Cross-disclosure under CPO 10 takes place within what the Cairn tribunal found to be the general rule. The burden in an application under CPO 10 therefore lies on the party opposing cross-disclosure. Cross-disclosure under VPO 3, on the other hand, takes place within what the Vedanta Tribunal found to be an exception to the general rule. The burden in an application under VPO 3 therefore lies on the party seeking cross-disclosure.', '25\\u2003In May 2018, the plaintiff applied to the Vedanta tribunal under VPO 3 for permission to make cross-disclosure of three categories of documents: (a) a decision issued by the Vedanta tribunal in December 2017 rejecting some of the plaintiff\u2019s jurisdictional objections (\u201cthe DPO\u201d); (b) memorials and materials related to that decision, with the accompanying evidence; and (c) the transcripts of the arguments leading to the that decision.', '26\\u2003In June 2018, the Vedanta tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6 (\u201cVPO 6\u201d) determining the plaintiff\u2019s application. VPO 6 permitted cross-disclosure of the DPO subject to redaction as agreed between the parties. But the tribunal rejected cross-disclosure of the other two categories of documents as lacking specificity 18', 'and being too wide. 19', 'In the event, the parties were unable to agree on the redactions to the DPO. So even the DPO has yet to be cross-disclosed. 20', '27\\u2003The plaintiff now lists, in a schedule to the application before me, the DPO as well as fourteen specific documents said to fall within the two rejected categories in VPO 6. The purpose of the schedule is to set out a non-exhaustive list of documents which the plaintiff is inviting the court to declare under the second declaration (see [3(b)] above) it may cross-disclose without breaching any obligation of confidentiality or privacy.', '28\\u2003In August 2018, the plaintiff applied urgently in the Vedanta Arbitration under VPO 3 for permission to cross-disclose into the Cairn Arbitration a section of a transcript in the Vedanta Arbitration recording the parties\u2019 submissions on jurisdiction. The plaintiff submitted that the purpose of cross-disclosure was to show the Cairn tribunal that Vedanta and Cairn \u2013 at that time represented in the two arbitrations by the same senior advocate from the Indian bar \u2013 were taking inconsistent positions in the two arbitrations on the same issue of Indian constitutional law. 21', '29\\u2003In September 2018, the Vedanta tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 7 (\u201cVPO 7\u201d) rejecting the plaintiff\u2019s application.

Mr Saiful executed the contract as the respondent\u2019s employee and with the respondent\u2019s actual or ostensible authority. 18', 'The contract was therefore valid and binding on the respondent. 19', '11\\u2003The arbitrator accepted the applicant\u2019s account in its entirety in her award.', '12\\u2003The respondent\u2019s account is as follows. Mr Saiful was not an employee of the respondent and had no authority to enter into the purported contract with the applicant on the respondent\u2019s behalf. 20', 'Mr Saiful in fact conspired with the applicant to defraud the respondent 21', 'by purporting to bind it to a contract which he procured for his own personal benefit by offering corrupt gratifications to Mr Taufik and Mr Ong. 22', '13\\u2003Two clauses in the contract are relevant for present purposes: 23', '14\\u2003The applicant asserted in the arbitration and asserts on this application that the final clause of the contract is an arbitration agreement within the meaning of s 2A(1) of the Act. The respondent did not deny this assertion at any time in the course of the arbitration. But the respondent denies the applicant\u2019s assertion now, in order to resist enforcement of the award. The respondent\u2019s case on this application is that the award is unenforceable under Art 36(1)(a)(i) of the Model Law on the ground that there is no valid arbitration agreement between the parties.', '15\\u2003The respondent failed to comply with the performance deposit clause. It also failed to deliver any gas oil to the applicant. This failure was despite several reminders which the applicant sent to Mr Saiful reminding him to comply with both obligations. Ms Choo was copied on some of this correspondence. 24', '16\\u2003The applicant took the position that the respondent\u2019s failures amounted to repudiatory breaches of the contract. 25', 'In May 2018, the applicant served notice on the respondent accepting the repudiatory breaches and terminating the contract with immediate effect. 26', '17\\u2003Ms Choo received the notice of termination. 27', 'But she did not respond to it. Her evidence is as follows. The notice of termination was the first time she knew anything about any purported contract between the respondent and the applicant. 28', 'She investigated internally. She discovered that all of the emails between the applicant and Mr Saiful about the contract which had been copied to her had gone into her junk mail folder. 29', 'She retrieved these emails from her junk mail folder. She also retrieved emails from Mr Saiful\u2019s email account. 30', 'As a result, she read the full email chain for the first time. 31', 'She pieced together Mr Saiful\u2019s conspiracy with the applicant to defraud the respondent. 32', 'She confronted Mr Saiful with the applicant\u2019s notice of termination and interrogated him about the contract. 33', 'But Mr Saiful disappeared in June 2018 without offering any explanation at all. 34', '18\\u2003It is probably at this point that the applicant engaged Kennedys Legal Solutions (\u201cKennedys\u201d). Kennedys are the firm of solicitors who have acted for the applicant throughout this dispute, including in this application.', '19\\u2003In mid-July 2018, Kennedys sent a letter before action to the respondent. 35', 'The letter claimed that the applicant was entitled to recover damages quantified at about US$279,000 from the respondent for the losses which the applicant had suffered as a result of the respondent\u2019s repudiatory breaches of the contract. 36', 'The letter demanded that the respondent pay the US$279,000 within 14 days. 37', '20\\u2003Up until this point, Ms Choo had not communicated with the applicant.

The other six charges were pursuant to s 47(1)(c) read with s 47(6)(a) of the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (Cap 65A, 2000 Rev Ed) (\u201cCDSA\u201d).', '7\\u2003In the proceedings below, the parties agreed to a statement of facts (\u201cASOF\u201d). I set out below a summarised version of the ASOF together with other undisputed facts.', '8\\u2003The Appellant was a project manager employed by RCS Engineering Pte Ltd (\u201cRCS\u201d) which is in the business of carrying out electrical and cabling works (\u201celectrical works\u201d) as a sub-contractor.', '9\\u2003The Appellant reported to Sia Ik Ting (\u201cSia\u201d), who was the main witness for the Respondent. For all intents and purposes, Sia owned RCS, which he founded in 2001. Sia was the Appellant\u2019s boss. RCS was engaged to install electrical works at two building projects. These electrical works included the installation of copper cables. Upon the completion of these works, there would usually be excess cables (\u201cwastage\u201d) ranging from a few centimetres to two metres in length. It was the obligation of RCS to clear the wastage from the work site.', '10\\u2003RCS left it to its project managers (including the Appellant) to manage the disposal of the wastage. Project managers may request RCS\u2019s sub-contractors to dispose of the wastage. They may also dispose of the wastage themselves by selling them as scrap. The sale proceeds may thereafter be used for site expenses and\/or personal usage and out of pocket expenses and incentives (for staff) which may not be claimable under RCS\u2019s petty cash.', '11\\u2003Examples of such site expenses\/incentives include reimbursement for taxi fares so that engineers and workers may come to work early or work late\/overtime; purchase of food and drinks for site staff and workers or the main contractor\u2019s hoisting\/lift operators when RCS required them to work after office hours; or replacement of missing test instruments and tools.', '12\\u2003The Appellant handled the disposal and sale of wastage in respect of two projects and deposited the sale proceeds into his bank accounts as follows:', '', '', '13\\u2003The Appellant also deposited $40,000 on 10 April 2013 into another POSB bank account (\u201cPOSB Acc 2\u201d), which was a joint account held by the Appellant and his mother. According to the Appellant, however, this was his mother\u2019s savings, rather than sale proceeds from the wastage. Apart from this deposit, it is not in contention that the remaining deposits represented proceeds of the sale of wastage by the Appellant. The total amount of deposits, inclusive of the $40,000, was $214,000.', '14\\u2003The Appellant subsequently withdrew various sums of money for the following purposes:', '', '15\\u2003The Appellant\u2019s withdrawals and subsequent spending form the subject-matter of the six CDSA charges.', '16\\u2003With regard to the CBT offences, the DJ found, relying on the Appellant\u2019s statements to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (\u201cCPIB\u201d), that the disputed $40,000 deposit constituted sale proceeds rather than the Appellant\u2019s mother\u2019s savings (see the decision below at [35]).', '17\\u2003The DJ also found that the Appellant had been entrusted with the proceeds arising from the sale of the wastage, and had acted dishonestly in misappropriating those sale proceeds (see the decision below at [48] and [67]).', '18\\u2003As for the CDSA charges, the DJ held that the sale proceeds, when deposited into the Appellant\u2019s various bank accounts, had \u201ctainted\u201d the entire pool of funds (see the decision below at [69]). The Appellant had then used these \u201ctainted\u201d funds in his purchase of the condominium unit and car, as well as payment for credit card charges and term insurance. His usage of the \u201ctainted\u201d funds constituted the essential element of the CDSA offences (see the decision below at [76]).', '19\\u2003Finally, the DJ sentenced the Appellant to a global imprisonment sentence of 39 months (see the decision below at [93]). The sentences in respect of two CBT charges (the 5th and 6th Charges) and one CDSA charge (the 11th Charge) were ordered to run consecutively, with those in respect of the remaining charges to run concurrently.', '20\\u2003In reaching his decision, the DJ noted that then counsel for the Appellant neither sought to distinguish any of the sentencing precedents raised by the Respondent, nor made submissions on sentence except for a request for a non-custodial sentence (see the decision below at [87]\u2013[88]).'"}

Clause 31(15)(a) of the SIA Conditions requires the Employer (ie, the plaintiff) to respond to an interim payment claim by the Contractor (ie, the defendant) by providing a payment response \u201cwithin 21 days\u201d after the interim payment claim is served on the Employer.', '6\\u2003The payment claim in the present case was served on the plaintiff on 20 April 2020, and it provided the payment response on 15 May 2020.

The defendant disagreed, contending that \u201cday\u201d in that clause had the same meaning as defined in s 2 of the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act (Cap 30B, 2006 Rev Ed) (the \u201cSOPA\u201d), ie, unless the context otherwise requires: \u201c\u2018day\u2019 means any day other than a public holiday within the meaning of the Holidays Act (Cap. 126)\u201d.', '8\\u2003On the plaintiff\u2019s case, with the contractual 21-day period for the payment response running from 20 April 2020 when the payment claim was served, the payment response was due on 11 May 2020. This meant that the dispute settlement period was from 12 to 18 May 2020 (per ss 12(2)(b) and 12(5) of the SOPA). After the end of the dispute settlement period, the defendant had to lodge its AA within seven days (under s 13(3)(a) read with s 12(2)(b) of the SOPA). As 24 and 25 May 2020 were public holidays (Hari Raya Puasa), and the SOPA definition of \u201cday\u201d would apply to that period, the plaintiff submitted that the AA had to be lodged by 27 May 2020.', '9\\u2003On the defendant\u2019s case, however, the public holidays on 1 May 2020 (Labour Day) and 7 May 2020 (Vesak Day) should be excluded from the computation of the due date of the payment response. On that basis, the payment response was only due on 13 May 2020, such that the defendant had to submit the AA by 29 May 2020. The defendant was entitled to lodge an AA (per s 12(2)(b) of the SOPA) as the plaintiff had failed to provide a payment response on time \u2013 whether the payment response was due on 11 or 13 May 2020, the plaintiff failed to meet the deadline and only provided the payment response on 15 May 2020.

This argument found favour in a previous adjudication matter, ATY Pte Ltd v ATZ Pte Ltd [2016] SCAdjR 39 (\u201cATY\u201d) at [57]\u2013[65], where the learned adjudicator held that \u201cday\u201d in clause 31(15)(a) of the SIA Conditions, as incorporated into the contract there, included public holidays.', '15\\u2003The defendant sought to distinguish ATY on the basis that the letter of award in that case had used the term \u201ccalendar day\u201d in relation to liquidated damages, whereas the appendix to the SIA Conditions had used the term \u201cday\u201d (when referring to the same matter). The adjudicator in ATY said this pointed to the parties regarding \u201ccalendar day\u201d and \u201cday\u201d as synonymous (ATY at [68]\u2013[71]). This was, however, only one of five points listed by the adjudicator to support his decision that \u201cday\u201d in that contract included public holidays (ATY at [57]\u2013[73]), and it does not appear that the letter of award\u2019s reference to \u201ccalendar day\u201d tipped the scales.', '16\\u2003The adjudicator in ATY also cited the decision in AFR Pte Ltd v AFS Pte Ltd [2011] SCAdjR 70 (\u201cAFR\u201d) where another learned adjudicator had likewise interpreted \u201cday\u201d in clause 31(15)(a) of the SIA Conditions (albeit the 7th Ed) to include public holidays (see [24]\u2013[28] of AFR).', '17\\u2003The defendant urged me not to follow the decisions in AFR and ATY. It argued that there was no need for article 9 of the SIA Conditions to expressly incorporate the definition of \u201cday\u201d in the SOPA \u2013 by incorporating \u201cpayment response\u201d, the SIA Conditions incorporated not only what a payment response was under the SOPA, but also when a payment response had to be provided under the SOPA. I did not agree with this argument. The SIA Conditions made a \u201cpayment response\u201d under the SIA Conditions what it was under the SOPA, but the SIA Conditions themselves made provision for when a payment response was to be provided, in the form of clause 31(15)(a). Article 9(d) of the SIA Conditions only states that \u201cpayment response\u201d shall have the same \u201cmeaning and effect\u201d as those words in the SOPA, which is a separate matter from when a payment response has to be provided under the SOPA.', '18\\u2003In this regard, s 11(1) of the SOPA reads as follows:', '19\\u2003Where a contract makes provision for when a payment response is to be provided (as was the case here), s 11(1)(a) of the SOPA applies and the payment response is to be provided by that contractual date, or within 21 days after the payment claim is served under s 10 of the SOPA, whichever is the earlier. The statutory \u201clong stop\u201d stipulation is \u201cwithin 21 days after the payment claim is served under section 10\u201d (and that 21-day period would exclude public holidays because of the definition of \u201cday\u201d in s 2 of the SOPA), but the SOPA expressly allows the parties to agree on a shorter period, and if they did, that agreed shorter period would then be applicable.', '20\\u2003The question remains whether the 21-day period in clause 31(15)(a) of the SIA Conditions is the same as the 21-day period in s 11(1)(a) of the SOPA. If \u201cday\u201d in the SIA Conditions excluded public holidays, then the two periods would be the same; but if \u201cday\u201d in the SIA Conditions included public holidays (and there were public holidays in the period in question), then the period under the SIA Conditions would be shorter.', '21\\u2003 \u201cDay\u201d was also used elsewhere in the Contract. Paragraph 3 of the letter of award stated that in the event of late completion, liquidated damages would be imposed at a rate of \u201c$500\/- per day\u201d. 1', 'The same paragraph expressed the Contract Period as \u201csix (6) calendar months including Sundays, Public Holidays and rest days\u201d, but this was more simply stated as \u201csix months\u201d in the appendix. 2', 'It appears that the parties regarded \u201ccalendar months\u201d (including public holidays) and \u201cmonths\u201d as synonymous. Their agreement on a Contract Period that specifically included public holidays suggests that they also intended other periods of time in the Contract to include public holidays.', '22\\u2003If the defendant failed to complete the construction works within the Contract Period, it would be liable to liquidated damages. It would not matter whether the first day after the Contract Period were a public holiday: that would not give the defendant an extra day to complete the works; he had already exceeded the Contract Period. Under clause 24(2), liquidated damages would be payable for the period during which the works remained incomplete, and there is no stipulation relieving the defendant from liability for any public holidays in that period.', '23\\u2003The defendant accepted that, in the Contract, \u201cday\u201d in relation to liquidated damages included public holidays. The defendant submitted that this was commercially justified because the cost of late completion to an Employer would continue day after day, whether any day was a public holiday. However, the defendant argued that the context of reckoning time for provision of a payment response was different, and so the meaning of \u201cday\u201d in relation to liquidated damages should not influence my decision on what \u201cday\u201d in clause 31(15) meant; moreover, the SOPA only addressed the payment mechanism, and not liquidated damages.', '24\\u2003The defendant\u2019s argument would however lead to \u201cday\u201d in relation to liquidated damages having a different meaning from \u201cday\u201d in relation to provision of a payment response within the same contract, whereas consistency of usage would generally be expected.', '25\\u2003The letter of award contained various other references to periods of time: \u201c1 week\u201d for mobilisation under paragraph 4, \u201c14 days\u201d for provision of a performance bond under paragraph 5, \u201cfourteen (14) days\u201d for submission of a programme of works under paragraph 6, and \u201ctwelve (12) months\u201d for the defects liability period under paragraph 9. 3', 'Did all these periods of time include public holidays (as with the Contract Period, and any period for which liquidated damages might be imposed)? Or did they exclude public holidays in line with the SOPA definition of \u201cday\u201d? Or did the answer to this vary from provision to provision in the same contract, as the defendant seemed to suggest?', '26\\u2003The same questions may be asked about the various periods of time stipulated in the SIA Conditions, on which the parties contracted. The learned adjudicator in ATY ([14] supra) referred to various such periods of time at [63] of his decision: \u201c28 days\u201d under clause 23(2) for the Contractor to give notice as a precursor to seeking an extension of time, \u201c14 days\u201d under clause 1(1) for written confirmation of the Architect\u2019s verbal directions or instructions, \u201c7 days\u201d under clause 1(7) for the Contractor to comply with a written notice from the Architect, \u201c14 days\u201d before scheduled commencement of work for the Contractor to submit a programme under clause 4(1), etc.', '27\\u2003The learned adjudicator in ATY ([14] supra) went on to say at [64]\u2013[65] that \u201c[i]t cannot be that the drafters of the SIA Conditions intended the term \u201cday\u201d in one clause to have a different meaning when used in another clause within the same contract\u201d; and that \u201c[i]t can only lead to confusion and ambiguity if such a \u201cpick and choose\u201d approach were adopted\u201d.', '28\\u2003The issue in the present case concerns clause 31(15)(a) of the SIA Conditions, but other subclauses of the same clause 31 also use the word \u201cday\u201d (or \u201cdays\u201d).', '29\\u2003Clause 31(2)(b) of the SIA Conditions reads:', '30\\u2003If \u201cday\u201d in the SIA Conditions excluded public holidays (in line with the SOPA definition), then the time for submission of any payment claim under clause 31(2) of the SIA Conditions could never fall due \u201con a day which is [a] \u2026 Public Holiday\u201d since such a day would, by definition, have been excluded, and the reference to public holidays in clause 31(2)(b) would thus be meaningless. Clause 31(2)(b) of the SIA Conditions was premised on \u201cday\u201d in clause 31(2)(a) including public holidays, and so it made specific provision for instances where the day on which a payment claim was to be submitted was a public holiday.', '31\\u2003If a payment claim were due on a Saturday, Sunday, or statutory or public holiday, clause 31(2)(b) gave the Contractor the leeway of submitting the payment claim on the next day which was not itself a Saturday, Sunday, or statutory or public holiday. There is, however, no equivalent of clause 31(2)(b) in relation to clause 31(3) which requires the Architect to issue an Interim Certificate within 14 days after receipt of the interim payment claim, or clause 31(15) which requires the Employer to respond to the interim payment claim within 21 days after the interim payment claim is served. Thus, if the Architect\u2019s Interim Certificate, or the Employer\u2019s payment response, fell due on a Saturday, Sunday, or statutory or public holiday, the Architect and the Employer could not point to anything like clause 31(2)(b) to justify a later response.', '32\\u2003If, from the language of clause 31(2)(b), \u201cday\u201d in clause 31(2) includes public holidays (see [29]\u2013[30] above), that points to \u201cday\u201d in clauses 31(3) and 31(15) likewise including public holidays. Generally, the same term should bear the same meaning wherever it is used in the same contract, and especially in the same clause (here, clause 31).', '33\\u2003As against the adjudication decisions in AFR ([16] supra) and ATY ([14] supra), which involved the SIA Conditions, the defendant relied on the High Court decisions in Fujitec Singapore Corp Ltd v GS Engineering & Construction Corp [2016] 1 SLR 1307 (\u201cFujitec\u201d) and Foges ([12] supra), both of which however did not involve the SIA Conditions.', '34\\u2003In Fujitec, the court held that the term \u201ccalendar day\u201d in the contract included public holidays, and did not mean the same as \u201cday\u201d in the SOPA. However, the judge commented at [10] that if the word used in that contract had been \u201cday\u201d, he would have had little hesitation interpreting \u201cday\u201d the same way it was defined in the SOPA. I pause to observe that from the judgment in Fujitec, there is no suggestion that the contract there had expressly adopted only certain SOPA definitions, unlike the Contract in the present case.', '35\\u2003In Foges ([12] supra), the court held that \u201cday\u201d in the subcontract there should be interpreted in line with the SOPA definition of \u201cday\u201d. The judge accepted that the parties had not expressly agreed that the statutory definition should apply to the word \u201cday\u201d in that contract, but held (at [100]) that \u201c[w]hen parties contract with the provisions of a statute in mind, and when the terms of those statutory provisions are defined by that statute, then generally, if the contract uses the same terms, the terms should be interpreted in accordance with the statutory definitions, unless the context yields a different interpretation\u201d.', '36\\u2003 What readily distinguishes Foges from the instant case is that the contract in the former had stated that \u201cthe relevant provisions of the SOPA shall apply to this Sub-Contract in respect of payment claim(s), payment response(s) and the date(s) on which progress payment(s) become(s) due and payable\u201d [emphasis added] \u2013 the court held that the SOPA definition of \u201cday\u201d was fundamental to the provisions of the SOPA relevant to payment claims and payment responses, and the parties had expressly acknowledged that those provisions would apply (see [93] and [101] of the judgment). The contract in Foges was therefore worded very differently from the Contract in this case; article 9 of the SIA Conditions was more limited in only providing for \u201cpayment claim\u201d and \u201cpayment response\u201d to \u201chave the same meaning and effect\u201d as those words in the SOPA and the regulations thereunder.', '37\\u2003Ultimately, the particular contract in each case stands to be construed.', '38\\u2003In my opinion, the drafters of the SIA Conditions chose not to incorporate the SOPA definition of \u201cday\u201d, while incorporating the SOPA definitions of \u201cpayment claim\u201d and \u201cpayment response\u201d (see [13]\u2013[17] above).', '39\\u2003Moreover, the parties agreed on a Contract Period of six calendar months that expressly included public holidays (see [21] above). It was also common ground that \u201cday\u201d in relation to liquidated damages included public holidays (see [22]\u2013[23] above). These points further support an interpretation of \u201cday\u201d in the Contract as including public holidays.', '40\\u2003Various other periods of time are provided for in the Contract, both in the letter of award and the SIA Conditions. A consistent treatment of them all (in terms of whether public holidays are included or excluded) would avoid confusion and ambiguity, and be preferable (see [25]\u2013[32] above).', '41\\u2003In particular, clause 31(2)(b) of the SIA Conditions is based on the concept of a \u201cday\u201d including public holidays, and cannot sit with the SOPA definition of \u201cday\u201d as excluding public holidays (see [28]\u2013[32] above). I would avoid interpreting \u201cday\u201d in clause 31(2) in relation to the Contractor, differently than in clause 31(3) in relation to the Architect, or in clause 31(15) in relation to the Employer.', '42\\u2003For the above reasons, I find that \u201cday\u201d in clause 31(15)(a) of the SIA Conditions, and in the Contract (which incorporates the SIA Conditions), includes public holidays. In that regard, it is different from \u201cday\u201d as defined in the SOPA, which excludes public holidays.', '43\\u2003Section 11(1)(a) of the SOPA expressly allows the parties to contractually agree on a more stringent deadline for the provision of a payment response than the long stop period under the SOPA (21 days excluding public holidays). That is what the parties did here. From the perspective of a Contractor wishing to get paid quickly, an interpretation of \u201cday\u201d in the SIA Conditions as including public holidays favours the Contractor: the Architect would then have a strict 14-day period to issue an Interim Certificate, and the Employer a strict 21-day period to provide a payment response. It was ironic that the Contractor (ie, defendant) in the present case argued that the Employer (ie, plaintiff) had more time for its payment response on account of public holidays, so as to save itself from the consequences of having made a late AA.'"}

{"casename":"2020_SGHC_22","fact":"'2\\u2003Between 2013 and 2015, the plaintiff and the 1st defendant were involved in discussions about setting up a solar cell production line at a factory in the city of Jiangyin in Jiangsu Province in China (\u201cthe Jiangyin Factory\u201d). The extent of each party\u2019s involvement in these efforts was a matter vigorously disputed by both sides in the course of these proceedings. In gist, the plaintiff claimed in the present suit that the 3rd defendant had made various representations to Soh, in order to induce the plaintiff to enter into an oral agreement (\u201cthe Oral Contract\u201d) with the 1st defendant in September 2013. It was the plaintiff\u2019s case that it had taken a number of actions following the Oral Contract in order to fulfil its obligations under the agreement. It was also the plaintiff\u2019s case that that it had agreed to vary the Oral Contract on 30 January 2014 by entering into an agreement to subscribe for shares in the 1st defendant; and that it had entered into this Share Subscription Agreement (\u201cthe SSA\u201d) on the basis of further representations made to Soh by both the 2nd and 3rd defendants. The plaintiff alleged that it had made various payments \u2013 but that the 1st defendant had subsequently refused to proceed with the arrangements agreed under the Oral Contract. According to the plaintiff, it also discovered the falsity of the representations made to Soh by the 2nd and 3rd defendants.', '3\\u2003According to the plaintiff\u2019s narrative, therefore, the defendants had basically hoodwinked Soh into committing the plaintiff to the Oral Contract and the SSA, causing him to make numerous payments before Schweizer Electronic AG pulled the plug on the 1st defendant\u2019s participation in the solar energy business and left the plaintiff high and dry. The plaintiff\u2019s claims in the present suit were based primarily on the defendants\u2019 alleged liability for fraudulent or negligent misrepresentation or on s 2 of the Misrepresentation Act. Alternatively, the plaintiff claimed that the 1st defendant had committed \u201crepudiatory breaches\u201d of the Oral Contract by refusing to perform its obligations under the said contract, which repudiatory breaches the plaintiff said it had accepted. As another alternative, the plaintiff claimed that the 1st defendant had been unjustly enriched due to \u201cfailure of consideration and\/or basis\u201d in respect of certain monies received by it under the Share Subscription Agreement. The plaintiff sought the return of the monies paid to the 1st defendant under the Share Subscription Agreement and of monies paid to Schmid under a contract with the latter for the purchase of equipment. It also sought damages related to the acquisition and maintenance of the Jiangyin Factory.', '4\\u2003The defendants denied having made the representations pleaded by the plaintiff. They also denied any oral contract having been entered into between the plaintiff and the 1st defendant in September 2013. According to the defendants, Soh was the one who had expressed interest in investing in the solar energy business after finding out about the 1st defendant\u2019s efforts to develop a solar cell production plant. Prior to Soh coming on the scene, the 1st defendant had been working on developing a solar cell production line in Nantong, another city in Jiangsu Province. To this end, the 1st defendant had entered into a contract with its wholly-owned subsidiary in Nantong \u2013 a company called Schweizer Energy Nantong Co Ltd (\u201cPNT\u201d) \u2013 in Nov 2012, to supply the latter with a production line for the production of solar cells. The 1st defendant had also entered into a separate contract with Schmid to purchase the equipment needed for PNT\u2019s production line. Soh sought to convince the 1st defendant to start its solar cell production line in Jiangyin (where Soh was based), by offering to rent the 1st defendant a factory he claimed to own in Jiangyin and to provide US$18 million in financing for the purchase of equipment.', '5\\u2003Although the defendants did engage in discussions with Soh on potential partnership models, they did not ultimately enter into any contract for the rental of the Jiangyin Factory or for equipment purchase financing. The only binding contract which resulted from these discussions was the SSA. Soh was the one who decided of his own accord that the plaintiff should contract to subscribe for 40% of the shares in the 1st defendant at a total contract price of US$9 million in several tranches. However, the plaintiff was constantly late in making the share subscription payments and ended up paying only a total of US$2 million. There was subsequently a capital reduction of US$1.25 million of the plaintiff\u2019s shares. Soh was also the one who decided to enter into a contract with Schmid for the purchase of equipment for the development of a solar cell production line at the Jiangyin Factory. Soh used a company named Darcet Jiangyin as the nominee in the Schmid contract even though Darcet Jiangyin had not been incorporated at the time he purported to sign the contract on its behalf. In March 2014, the plaintiff paid US$1.5 million to Schmid under this contract, but no equipment was ever delivered because the payment fell far short of the 40% of the purchase price which was required before the contract would come into effect. It was also around this time that the plaintiff experienced financial difficulties and borrowed a total of US$1.2 million from the 1st defendant.', '6\\u2003According to the defendants\u2019 narrative, therefore, Soh was the one who had been actively interested in getting his companies into the solar energy business and who had made big promises which the plaintiff was financially unable to fulfil. The present suit was really his attempt to foist the blame for his own poor business decisions on the defendants.', '7\\u2003At the conclusion of the trial, I dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s action as I found that it had failed to make out its claims on the basis of the evidence adduced. As the plaintiff has appealed against my decision, I have set out below my reasons. I will start by summarising the evidence led by each side.'"}

This was done without SingNet making any application to a copyright tribunal established under the Act (\u201cTribunal\u201d) between 1 April 2013 and 30 January 2019.', '5\\u2003On 11 March 2019, COMPASS commenced Suit No 261 of 2019 (the \u201cSuit\u201d) against SingNet for acts of copyright infringement allegedly committed since on or about 1 April 2013 in respect of various musical works belonging to the owners represented by COMPASS.

COMPASS submits that the answer to the Question is \u201cNo\u201d, whereas SingNet says the answer is \u201cYes\u201d.', '7\\u2003Section 9A(1) of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed) provides that \u201c[i]n the interpretation of a provision of a written law, an interpretation that would promote the purpose or object underlying the written law (whether that purpose or object is expressly stated in the written law or not) shall be preferred to an interpretation that would not promote that purpose or object\u201d. As set out by the Court of Appeal in Attorney-General v Ting Choon Meng and another appeal [2017] 1 SLR 373 (\u201cTing Choon Meng\u201d) at [59], the process of purposive statutory interpretation consists of three steps:', '8\\u2003Taking a purposive interpretation of ss 163(2) and 163(6)(b), within the context of the Act as a whole, my view is that the Question is to be answered in the negative. I elaborate on my reasons and deal with the parties\u2019 arguments below. For ease of reference, sections 163(2) and 163(6)(b) of the Act state as follows:', '9\\u2003Under s 163(2) of the Act, a person may apply to the Tribunal where it claims, in a case to which a licence scheme applies, that it requires a licence but that the applicable charges and\/or conditions are not reasonable. Pursuant to s 163(6)(b) of the Act, the Tribunal may then make orders determining the application (\u201cfinal orders\u201d), which specify the charges and conditions that it considers reasonable in the circumstances. On a plain reading of these two provisions, nothing indicates to me that Parliament intended the Tribunal to have the jurisdiction to make final orders having retrospective effect.', '10\\u2003Having considered the two provisions in isolation, the next task is to consider them in the wider context of the statutory framework under s 163 read with ss 165 and 168 of the Act (the \u201cstatutory framework\u201d). Under s 163 of the Act, applications to the Tribunal may not only be made under s 163(2), but also under ss 163(1), (3) and (4). Although the Question only relates to two specific provisions in s 163 (ie, subsections (2) and (6)(b)), it is important to appreciate how all the provisions in ss 163, 165 and 168 are intended to work together, in order to understand the scope and purpose of the individual provisions (see Ting Choon Meng at [59(a)]).', '11\\u2003I will thus start by setting out the parties\u2019 interpretations of how the relevant provisions in the Act are intended to work, before discussing my own interpretation.', '12\\u2003COMPASS submits that where there is a dispute over the reasonableness of the charges and conditions applicable to the grant of a licence under an existing licence scheme, the Act is intended to work as follows. First, the copyright user (ie, SingNet) ought to make an application to the Tribunal in relation to the licence under s 163(2) of the Act. The onus lies on the user to do so because only users have the locus standi to make applications under that provision. 5', 'Once the application has been made, then:', '(a)\\u2003while the application is pending before the Tribunal (the \u201cinterim period\u201d), the applicant will be able to obtain prospective protection against liability for copyright infringement (\u201cinfringement liability\u201d) under s 164(1) of the Act if it has (i) complied with the conditions of the applicable licence scheme, and (ii) either paid or undertaken to pay the applicable charges 6', '; and', '(b)\\u2003after the Tribunal makes its final orders on the application under s 163(2) of the Act, the applicant may then obtain prospective protection against infringement liability under s 165(4) if the applicant has (i) complied with such conditions as specified in the final orders; and (ii) either paid or undertaken to pay any applicable charges. 7', '13\\u2003Given the availability of the prospective protections above, COMPASS argues that SingNet ought to have applied to the Tribunal under s 163(2) of the Act at an early stage, before SingNet made use of the copyright works. 8', 'If SingNet wishes to use the copyright works pending the determination of its Application, it should comply with the terms of COMPASS\u2019 existing licence scheme so as to obtain the prospective protection of s 164(1) of the Act. Once the Tribunal makes its final orders on the application, SingNet should then comply with the terms of such orders so as to obtain the prospective protection of s 165(4) of the Act. Having failed to do any of these things, COMPASS says that SingNet cannot now seek retrospective protection from the Tribunal under the Act. Parliament has already contemplated and provided for the prospective protection of copyright users during the interim period and after the Tribunal makes its final orders, as set out at [12] above. There was simply no further legislative intention for the Tribunal to also have the jurisdiction to make final orders with retrospective effect.', '14\\u2003To reinforce its case, COMPASS cites the reasoning of an earlier decision by the Tribunal in Sunvic Production Pte Ltd v Composers and Authors Society of Singapore Ltd [1993] SGCRT 1 (\u201cSunvic\u201d). 9', 'In Sunvic 10', ', the applicant originally applied to the Tribunal under s 163(2) of the Act, but the application was later amended to a reference under s 161(1)(b) in respect of a licence scheme operated by the respondent. The original application in Sunvic was made on the basis that the applicant \u201crequires licences for the public performance of copyright music\u201d in three of its concerts that had already taken place (\u201cthree past concerts\u201d), as well as for \u201call [its] future concerts\u201d. By the date of the hearing before the Tribunal in Sunvic, 12 of the \u201cfuture concerts\u201d had already taken place, and are hereinafter referred to as the \u201cinterim concerts\u201d.', '15\\u2003The Tribunal in Sunvic held that it had no jurisdiction under s 163(2) read with s 165(4) of the Act to make retrospective final orders as to the charges and conditions applicable to the three past concerts and the interim concerts. COMPASS relies, inter alia, on the following portions of the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning (at [3.2]\u2013[3.4] and [4.5]):', 'Although an in-depth discussion of Sunvic is not necessary, I will discuss the relevant parts of the decision below, where appropriate.', '16\\u2003SingNet offers a different interpretation of the Act. Contrary to COMPASS\u2019 submission, SingNet argues that pending the determination of its Application under s 163(2) of the Act, the protection under s 164 would not apply. 11', 'This is because s 164 only applies where there is a \u201clicence scheme\u2026in operation by virtue of [Part VII of the Act]\u201d. In SingNet\u2019s case, however, the only licence scheme in question is that unilaterally put into operation by the licensor, COMPASS. Section 164 is instead meant to apply to licence schemes which remain in operation by virtue of s 161(8) of the Act. Section 161(8) provides that \u201c[an existing] licence scheme\u2026referred to a Tribunal under [s 161 of the Act] shall remain in operation\u2026until the Tribunal makes an order in pursuance of the reference\u201d. According to SingNet, if Parliament had intended a copyright user to comply with any existing licence scheme pending the Tribunal\u2019s final orders (ie, because the Tribunal has no power to retrospectively vary the licence scheme in respect of the period pre-dating the final orders), then it would have been straightforward to include licence schemes unilaterally imposed by the licensor within s 164. However, since Parliament did not do so, that could therefore not have been Parliament\u2019s intention.', '17\\u2003SingNet further contends that if the Question is answered in the negative, a licensor would be incentivised to drag out negotiations and Tribunal proceedings to allow itself to continue dictating licence terms for as long as possible during the interim period. 12', 'This creates the potential for abuse since the said licence terms may very well be unreasonable. In such a situation, prior to obtaining final orders from the Tribunal, SingNet says that a copyright user is left with three unenviable options: 13', '(a)\\u2003first, refrain completely from using the copyright works;', '(b)\\u2003second, continue to use the copyright works under threat from the owner who has a \u201cvested\u201d right to sue for copyright infringement, however unreasonable the terms of the licence scheme may be; or', '(c)\\u2003third, adhere to the terms of the licence scheme under protest, but with no prospect of recovering any overpayment.', '18\\u2003In SingNet\u2019s view, such an outcome could not have been intended by Parliament. Instead, SingNet submits that the Tribunal\u2019s powers under s 163(2) read with s 163(6)(b) of the Act should be interpreted in accordance with Parliament\u2019s intentions in establishing the Tribunal. 14', 'As explained during the Second Reading of the Copyright (Amendment) Bill (Bill No 16\/2009), Parliament\u2019s objective in establishing the Act was to \u201cstrike a fair balance between the rights of copyright owners and copyright users\u201d, and its objective in establishing the Tribunal was to \u201cprovide an expeditious forum\u201d for the resolution of licensing disputes without the need for court proceedings, and for the Tribunal to \u201cact as a check against licensors imposing unreasonable licensing fees and terms\u201d (Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (15 September 2009) vol 86 at cols 1497\u201399). 15', '19\\u2003To promote these purposes, SingNet argues that the Tribunal must have wide powers in relation to the disputes before it, including the power to make retrospective final orders under s 163(2) read with s 163(6)(b) of the Act. It also points out that neither provision expressly excludes the power to make a retrospective final order from the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction 16', '. On the contrary, the Tribunal was established for the very purpose of altering the relative legal positions of copyright owners and users, based on what it considers reasonable in the circumstances. 17', '20\\u2003Having set out each party\u2019s interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Act, I now discuss my own interpretation. The Copyright Act 1987 (Act 2 of 1987), which established the Tribunal, was first enacted in 1987. The Second Reading for the Copyright Bill (Bill No 8\/1986) at the time does not shed particular light on the purpose of either the legislation or the Tribunal which is relevant to our present inquiry. Nonetheless, subsequent amendments have been made to the relevant provisions (ie, in Part VII) of the Act through the Copyright (Amendment) Bill (Bill No 16\/2009). As stated by the Court of Appeal in Tan Cheng Bock v Attorney-General [2017] 2 SLR 850 (at [35]):', '21\\u2003In my view, the statements in the Second Reading of the Copyright (Amendment) Bill (Bill No 16\/2009), referred to by SingNet at [18] above, are broadly reflective of the general purpose of the Act and the specific purpose of the provisions establishing the Tribunal and its statutory framework. SingNet\u2019s case is, however, based on a misconception as to how the relevant provisions in the Act carry out these purposes. Based on my analysis of the statutory framework, there are three main reasons why the Question should be answered in the negative. I discuss these reasons in turn.', '22\\u2003First, both SingNet\u2019s and COMPASS\u2019 understanding of the Act fails to address a crucial provision in the statutory framework \u2013 namely, section 168. I reproduce the section here for ease of reference:', '23\\u2003Section 168 of the Act is the missing piece of the puzzle. This section provides that the Tribunal is empowered to make interim orders on any \u201capplication or reference\u2026to a Tribunal under [the] Act\u201d, which includes an application made under ss 163(1), (2), (3) or (4). The wording of s 168 expressly indicates that it is intended to govern the parties\u2019 relative legal positions during the interim period (ie, while applications or references are pending before the Tribunal). Contrary to SingNet\u2019s case at [17] above, there is therefore at least a fourth option open to an aggrieved copyright user (including one in SingNet\u2019s position) under the statutory framework. Specifically, it is open to such a user to:', '(a)\\u2003make an application to the Tribunal under s 163(2) of the Act; and', '(b)\\u2003concurrently or as soon as practicable, seek interim orders under s 168 of the Act.', '24\\u2003Where the Tribunal makes any interim or final orders on an application under ss 163(1), (2) or (3) of the Act, section 165(4) provides for the legal effect of such orders. I reproduce that provision here for reference:', '25\\u2003In the above provision, the phrase \u201can order on an application under section 163(1), (2) or (3) specifying charges, if any, and conditions, in relation to the applicant\u201d includes both interim orders and final orders made to that effect. Section 149 of the Act clearly states that under Part VII, which sets out the statutory framework, the term \u201corder\u201d includes \u201can interim order\u201d. This is unless the context otherwise requires, which it does not. The effect of s 165(4) is therefore this. It covers the situation where the Tribunal has made interim or final orders on an application under ss 163(1), (2) or (3) of the Act specifying the conditions and any charges in relation to the applicant in question. In such a situation, if the applicant has complied with the conditions specified in the orders, and either paid or undertaken to pay any applicable charges, then in any proceedings for copyright infringement, the applicant shall be in the like position as if it had at all material times been the holder of the requisite licence.', '26\\u2003In a similar vein, for applications under s 163(4) of the Act, where the Tribunal makes any interim or final orders \u201cspecifying the charges (if any) and conditions in relation to the persons, or to persons included in the classes of persons, specified in the order\u201d, s 165(5) (read with s 149 in the case of interim orders) provides for the orders\u2019 legal effect. Section 165(5) affords the aforementioned persons with protection against infringement liability if they have complied with the conditions specified in the interim or final orders, and paid or undertaken to pay any specified charges.', '27\\u2003It is hence clear that when an application is made under s 163 of the Act, copyright users may be protected against infringement liability not only after the Tribunal has made its final orders (under s 165), but also during the preceding interim period (under ss 168 read with 165). At the hearing before me, SingNet\u2019s counsel accepted that on hindsight, at the time that SingNet made its Application, it was also possibly open to SingNet to have sought interim orders under s 168 during the interim period.', '28\\u2003In the absence of s 168 of the Act, the two scenarios painted before me by SingNet and COMPASS are likely to follow. First, assuming the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to make retrospective final orders in applications under s 163 of the Act, there would be an incentive for copyright owners to deliberately delay negotiations and\/or Tribunal proceedings so that they can dictate terms for as long as possible pending the Tribunal\u2019s final determination. Alternatively, if the Tribunal has the jurisdiction to make retrospective final orders, copyright users may make the strategic choice of infringing upon the copyright works first. As the Tribunal in Sunvic ([14] supra at [4.5]) highlighted, copyright users may choose to wait until very late in the day when the copyright owner finally commences Tribunal or court proceedings, before seeking final orders that retrospectively vary the charges and conditions applicable at the time of their infringement. This would then allow them to obtain protection from infringement liability under s 165 of the Act. To my mind, Parliament could not have intended either of these two scenarios, given that each allows for potential abuse in the manner I have just described. Instead, Parliament enacted s 168 of the Act to allow parties to seek the necessary prospective interim orders, thereby excluding the potential for such abuse. This understanding of the role of s 168 in the statutory framework is consistent with, and furthers, the general purpose of the Act. It \u201cstrike[s] a fair balance between the rights of copyright owners and copyright users\u201d, and \u201cact[s] as a check\u201d against potential abuse by either party.', '29\\u2003I emphasise, however, that s 168 read with s 165 of the Act is not meant as a licence for copyright users to engage in copyright infringement. It is only meant to afford copyright users, who have sought, obtained and complied with the Tribunal\u2019s interim orders, a defence in copyright infringement proceedings for the limited period of time pending the Tribunal\u2019s final determination. In particular, nothing in the wording of s 168 of the Act indicates that interim orders are intended to apply retrospectively. This means that if a copyright user wishes to avail itself of the protection under s 168 read with s 165, it is incumbent upon it to make an application to the Tribunal, as well as seek interim orders pending the Tribunal\u2019s determination, as early as possible. This would allow the Tribunal to consider the matter at an early stage, so that it may pre-emptively address any foreseeable issues and make flexible adjustments that take into account the specific circumstances of the parties. All of these go towards striking a fair balance between the interests of the copyright owner and user, in line with the purposes of the Act. Although s 168 of the Act does not indicate that only the copyright user may seek an interim order, the onus may often lie upon the user to do so. This is because in the absence of any interim orders, the applicant would not be able to avail itself of the protection under s 165 during the interim period, and any use of the copyright works may expose it to civil, and even criminal, liability for copyright infringement.', '30\\u2003I also note that on the face of s 168, there is no express restriction on the types of interim orders that the Tribunal may make. There is therefore a potentially wide range of flexible orders that the Tribunal may resort to in order to achieve fairness between the parties, pending the determination of the application. I will return to this point later in my examination of the relevant Australian legislation and case authorities (see [47]\u2013[55] below).', '31\\u2003Seen in the above light, there is simply no need for the Tribunal to have the jurisdiction to make retrospective final orders under ss 163(2) and 163(6)(b) of the Act (or any of the other subsections in s 163). Nothing in the wording or purpose of the aforesaid provisions, as well as s 165 of the Act, supports the existence of such a jurisdiction. On the contrary, the existence of such a jurisdiction would allow copyright users to abuse the statutory framework in the manner described at [28] above. This would render the prospective interim protection provided by s 168 read with s 165 of the Act redundant to a large extent, which cannot have been intended by Parliament.', '32\\u2003At this juncture, I also make a related observation. When an existing licence scheme is referred to the Tribunal under s 161 of the Act, s 161(8) states that the scheme \u201cshall remain in operation\u2026until the Tribunal makes an order in pursuance of the reference\u201d. Similarly, where a further reference is made under s 162 of the Act, s 162(5) states that \u201c[s 161(8)] shall apply\u201d with respect to the licence scheme that is the subject of the further reference. It appears that, in situations where ss 161(8) and 162(5) of the Act operate, there is a \u201clicence scheme\u2026in operation by virtue of [Part VII of the Act] pending the making of an order on a reference\u201d which triggers the protection for copyright users under s 164. Under s 164 of the Act, the copyright user will be protected against infringement liability if, at the material times, it has complied with the conditions and paid or undertaken to pay the charges under the applicable licence scheme. This means that for references under ss 161 and 162 of the Act, there is protection for copyright users pending the making of any interim or final orders. In my view, this protection strengthens the position that there is no need for final orders that take retrospective effect in respect of the same interim period.', '33\\u2003On the other hand, there is no equivalent of ss 161(8) or 162(5) which applies to applications under s 163(2) of the Act. The result is that for such applications, there is no \u201clicence scheme\u2026 in operation by virtue of [Part VII of the Act]\u201d to trigger the protection under s 164. This is an argument also raised by SingNet\u2019s counsel, as set out at [16] above. It appears, however, that for applications under s 163(2), there is no need for the protection under s 164 of the Act to be available pending the making of any interim or final orders. Quite apart from s 164, insofar as (a) the licensor would grant a licence provided that the charges (which are the subject of the application) continue to apply, and (b) the user agrees to pay those charges for the licence, there would be no liability for copyright infringement in any event. This is because there would essentially be an agreement between the parties as to the terms of the use of the copyright works.', '34\\u2003Once, however, the Tribunal makes interim or final orders, the said orders may vary the charges applicable to the applicant user. In such a situation, there would be no agreement between the parties as to the terms of use. Thus, it would not suffice for the copyright user to merely pay the charges as varied by the Tribunal. There is still a need to expressly provide in s 165(4) of the Act that upon paying the said charges (and complying with the conditions specified in the orders), the user is treated as if it had the requisite licence at the material times. This is notwithstanding that no such licence may have actually been granted by the licensor.', '35\\u2003As such, even if the protection under s 164 of Act is not available in applications under s 163(2), this does not necessitate the Tribunal having the jurisdiction to make retrospective final orders under ss 163(2) and 163(6)(b). In any case, as mentioned, s 168 read with s 165 of the Act still provides protection for copyright users during the interim period. I thus maintain my view as set out at [31] above.', '36\\u2003Lastly, the foregoing discussion at [22]\u2013[35] above also makes the following point clear. Prior to an application to the Tribunal being made under s 163(2) of the Act, there is simply no protection under the statutory framework for a copyright user to use copyright works without paying the applicable charges for the requisite licence. The copyright user is not entitled to such use and would be liable for copyright infringement if it cannot raise any other defence under the remaining provisions of the Act. As mentioned at [29] above, if a copyright user disputes the applicable charges but needs to use the copyright works prior to the issuance of the Tribunal\u2019s final orders, the appropriate course of action is to apply under s 163(2) of the Act and seek interim protection under s 168 at an early stage. A failure to do so is no defence to infringement liability.', '37\\u2003My second main reason for answering the Question in the negative is this. Under the Act, acts of copyright infringement may not only attract civil liability, but also criminal liability. Such liability, if any, would accrue at the date of the infringement. When the Tribunal makes its final orders on an application under s 163(2) of the Act, the effect of its orders, as set out in s 165(4), is that if the applicant complies with the conditions specified in the orders and pays or undertakes to pay any applicable charges, the applicant will have a defence in not only civil proceedings for copyright infringement, but also criminal proceedings for an alleged contravention of s 136(6): see s 149(2)(d).', '38\\u2003The paradigm situation where a copyright user would want to seek retrospective final orders is when it has used the licensor\u2019s copyright works without paying the applicable charges, which use would in itself amount to copyright infringement. In such a situation, granting the user retrospective final orders means that upon fulfilling the conditions of s 165(4), the user will be able to retrospectively absolve itself of both criminal liability (where applicable) and civil liability for infringements committed during the period predating the final orders. This is a point also raised by the Tribunal in Sunvic ([14] supra at [3.4]) and relied on by COMPASS. 18', '39\\u2003I see no basis for finding that Parliament had intended s 163(2) (read with ss 163(6)(b) and 165(4) of the Act) to be used for such a far-reaching purpose. Crucially, based on the wording of s 165(4) of the Act, the copyright user can still be protected from liability even if the Tribunal\u2019s final orders (a) specify that the original charges are reasonable and should stay in place; or (b) retrospectively raise the applicable charges, in respect of the period predating the orders. It cannot be right that a copyright user, who has committed copyright infringement and refused to pay the original applicable charges (that were ultimately found not to be unreasonable to the user), could nonetheless be allowed to retrospectively \u201cwhitewash\u201d its civil and criminal liability for past infringements. The Tribunal was simply not intended to act as a dhobi to \u201cwhitewash\u201d such infringing activities.', '40\\u2003At the hearing before me, SingNet\u2019s counsel implored this court to take into account the specific circumstances of the parties\u2019 underlying dispute. 19', 'Counsel argued that SingNet had engaged in protracted negotiations with COMPASS over the previous six years, during which time COMPASS had apparently tolerated SingNet\u2019s use of its copyright works without threatening civil proceedings or relying upon the penal provisions in the Act. According to counsel, this is not a situation where COMPASS had actively sought to enforce its rights (in a civil action).', '41\\u2003I am unable to accept this. The issue before me is a question of law, which should not be determined based on the parties\u2019 specific circumstances, except perhaps insofar as they are representative of the general or systemic effect that any particular interpretation of s 163(2) and s 163(6)(b) of the Act might have. The parties\u2019 specific circumstances are not representative in such a way, since during the previous six years, SingNet failed to avail itself of the protection it could have sought. If SingNet had intended to use the copyright works without reaching a compromise with COMPASS and wanted to avoid infringement liability, SingNet ought to have applied to the Tribunal under s 163(2) of the Act, and concurrently sought interim orders under s 168 (and complied with the same). Yet, it only chose to do the former on 31 January 2019 and completely omitted to do the latter even as of the date of the hearing before me. Given that SingNet would not be in its current position had it used the statutory framework in the way that the framework was intended to be used, SingNet cannot now rely on its specific circumstances to ask this court to ignore the general, far-reaching consequences of its position (at [37]\u2013[39] above).', '42\\u2003Turning to my third main reason for answering the Question in the negative, I highlight two related situations in which SingNet\u2019s case faces difficulties. The first is the same paradigm situation mentioned in [38] above. In such a situation, the licensor must surely be entitled to interest on the charges that the user ought to have paid at the time of its use of the copyright works but did not. COMPASS makes the argument, with which I agree, that such interest would properly be recoverable in an action for copyright infringement. 20', 'The Tribunal, however, does not have the power to award interest under the statutory framework. At the hearing before me, SingNet\u2019s counsel did not dispute this and, in any event, was unable to direct me to any provision in the Act conferring such a power. If the Tribunal has the jurisdiction to retrospectively determine the charges applicable to the period predating its final orders, then in an application under s 163 of the Act, the wording of ss 165(4) and 165(5) means that the copyright user can \u201cwhitewash\u201d its liability for past infringements by paying only the said charges after the final orders have been made. The user would not have to pay any interest for the delayed payment in order to avail itself of that protection (see also s 165(6) of the Act). Such an outcome would be highly unfair and prejudicial to the licensor, and surely could not have been intended by Parliament.', '43\\u2003The second related situation is where the Tribunal, assuming it has the necessary jurisdiction, makes final orders that retrospectively vary the charges applicable to the period predating the said orders. If the said charges are adjusted downwards, one would expect that any excess paid by the copyright user at the time should be returned. Conversely, if the charges are adjusted upwards, then the copyright user should have to pay the shortfall to the licensor. There are, however, no express provisions in the Act which mandate the return of such excess charges, or the payment of the shortfall (as the case may be). Furthermore, as mentioned, there is no provision under the Act allowing the Tribunal to order that interest be paid on those amounts. To my mind, Parliament could not have intended to omit such an important requirement for the excess charges or shortfall to be repaid\/paid (as the case may be), or to unfairly deprive the relevant party of interest. The lack of these two features thus supports my view that the Tribunal was not intended to have the jurisdiction to retrospectively vary the applicable charges.', '44\\u2003For the reasons above and taking into account the context of the entire statutory framework, my view is that Parliament had no intention for the Tribunal to have the jurisdiction to make retrospective final orders under ss 163(2) and 163(6)(b) of the Act.', '45\\u2003I now briefly address the decision in Singapore Broadcasting Corporation v The Performing Right Society Ltd (Composers and Authors Society of Singapore Ltd, Third Party) [1991] SGCRT 1 (\u201cSBC\u201d), which SingNet cites. 21', 'In that case, the applicant made an application under s 163(2) of the Act in respect of a licence scheme operated by the respondent (which was published prior to the date of the application). The Tribunal there decided to vary the licence scheme, and it held that \u201c[s]ince [it] is essentially considering the reasonableness of the published licence scheme, in [the scheme\u2019s] application to SBC, \u2026 the licence set out in its order can properly date back to the date when the scheme was published\u201d. SingNet submits that SBC is authority for the proposition that the Tribunal has the jurisdiction to make retrospective final orders under s 163(2) of the Act. COMPASS denies this. It cites a point made by the Tribunal in Sunvic ([14] supra) at [3.7] \u2013 namely, that in SBC, the party which had asked for the final order to take retrospective effect was the respondent, and there was no objection by the applicant. 22', '46\\u2003The difficulty with COMPASS\u2019 response is this. As SingNet correctly argues, parties cannot, by agreement or a lack of objection, confer on the Tribunal jurisdiction which the Tribunal does not have. That said, insofar as the Tribunal in SBC decided that it has the jurisdiction under s 163(2) of the Act to make retrospective orders, I respectfully disagree for all the reasons set out above. Counsel in that case do not appear to have raised any arguments for the Tribunal\u2019s consideration which address the three reasons I have given. In my view, should parties wish to apply the Tribunal\u2019s orders in a retrospective manner, it is for them to implement such an arrangement between themselves, and not for the Tribunal to make final orders under the statutory framework to that effect.'"}

The AGC also noted the plaintiff\u2019s \u201crefusal to particularise\u201d the material that he claimed is privileged.

{"casename":"2020_SGHC_224","fact":"'4\\u2003I begin by outlining how Chong, Tan, and the Lims came to be shareholders in Richinn.', '5\\u2003Before 2003, Chong and Tan had been colleagues in Applied Cutting Technology Pte Ltd (\u201cApplied Cutting\u201d), a company which provided laser cutting services. Tan worked in sales, while Chong worked in production. 3', 'Tan left the company in March or April 2003, with a view towards setting up his own laser cutting business. As laser cutting machines were expensive, and Tan did not have the capital, he met with several potential investors who expressed interest in his plans. According to Tan, he was approached by Robert in the first quarter of 2004 as Robert was interested in entering into a laser cutting business. I note for completeness that the Lims claim that it was Tan who had approached Robert with an offer of collaboration, though in my view nothing specifically turns on this point.', '6\\u2003Eventually, Chong, Tan, and the Lims agreed to set up a new laser cutting business. Chong left his job at Applied Cutting to embark on this venture. The Lims injected the initial capital for the enterprise.', '7\\u2003The plaintiffs and the Lims agreed to use an existing company for the laser cutting business. This company was the first defendant, which was then called Richinn Trading Pte Ltd, and which had previously been incorporated by the Lims in 2002. The first defendant had been used by the Lims up to that time to trade in silicone. The laser cutting business was an altogether new business for the Lims, and the first defendant\u2019s name was changed from \u201cRichinn Trading Pte Ltd\u201d to its present name, Richinn Technology Pte Ltd, to reflect the new business of laser cutting services.', '8\\u2003Tan and Chong joined Richinn in April 2004. 4', 'About six months later, on 15 October 2004, Tan, Chong, and the Lims entered into a written agreement (the \u201cShareholders\u2019 Agreement\u201d) which provided, inter alia, for an increase in the paid up capital of Richinn and the sale and purchase of shares in the company such that the parties\u2019 respective holdings were as follows: 5', '(a)\\u2003Richard Lim and\/or Robert Lim: 180,000 ordinary shares (60%)', '(b)\\u2003Tan or his nominee Mdm Lee Lye San (Tan\u2019s wife, \u201cMdm Lee\u201d): 69,000 ordinary shares (23%)', '(c)\\u2003Chong: 51,000 ordinary shares (17%)', 'Even though it is not specifically stated in the Shareholders\u2019 Agreement, it was agreed between the parties that the plaintiffs would be employed by Richinn to manage and run the business. The directors of the company were specifically stated as being the Lims, Tan (or his wife as nominee), and Chong. 6', 'In addition, cl 4.2 of the Shareholders\u2019 Agreement (\u201cthe Non-Competition Covenant\u201d) stipulated that the shareholders undertook that they would not, directly or indirectly, be involved in a business in the same business as Richinn while they were still shareholders or directors of Richinn, or for a period of five years from the date of the Shareholders\u2019 Agreement, whichever was later.', '9\\u2003Clause 4.2 of the October 2004 Shareholders\u2019 Agreement was later specifically extended by a written Extension Agreement dated 1 October 2013 (the \u201cExtension Agreement\u201d). 7', 'The Extension Agreement recognised that the Shareholders\u2019 Agreement remained in \u201cfull force and effect\u201d, 8', 'and made clear that all the Extension Agreement sought to do was to extend the shareholders\u2019 undertaking under cl 4.2 of the Shareholders\u2019 Agreement. 9', 'Clause 2 of the Extension Agreement thus provides that each of the shareholders will not participate in a business with the same business as that of Richinn for a period of five years from the date of the Extension Agreement, or while he is still a shareholder or director of Richinn, whichever is later. I note also a separate agreement entered into in 2007 (the \u201cBusiness Continuity Agreement\u201d) to provide for continuity of business in the event of the demise of one of the four shareholders. 10', 'The Business Continuity Agreement provided that if one of the shareholders were to pass away, the deceased shareholder\u2019s family would be provided with a monthly stipend, and the deceased\u2019s shares would devolve to one of the surviving shareholders, who would hold the shares on trust for the beneficiaries of the deceased shareholder.', '10\\u2003The day-to-day business of laser cutting was run and managed by the plaintiffs. Specifically, Tan, who had previously worked in sales for Applied Cutting, was in charge of sales and business development, while Chong, who had prior experience in production, took charge of that area. 11', 'Tan and Chong were not only directors of Richinn, they also held executive positions in the company. They both drew salaries from Richinn from the end of 2005 up to the time of the dispute. Tan was managing Richinn until January 2018. Up to 2013, Chong had been involved in the day-to-day management of Richinn, but since 2014, his primary responsibility in this venture was to manage the Malaysian operations, as is described below from [12] to [14]. 12', '11\\u2003As for the Lims, they controlled the finance and administration of the company. Specifically, they controlled all payments out, in that one of them had to countersign or give authorisation on all payments made by the company. They also held the tokens for Richinn\u2019s electronic banking accounts, and liaised with banks for banking facilities. 13', 'The Lims attended monthly management meetings to update themselves on the business and how well it was doing.', '12\\u2003The business grew and was successful. Other corporate entities were set up in Singapore, Malaysia, and the Middle East by the shareholders of Richinn. Of note is the company incorporated in Malaysia in 2004 called CJ Stainless Steel Sdn. Bhd. (\u201cCJSS\u201d). 14', 'That company was established to act as a subcontractor for Richinn and Choon Hin Stainless Steel Pte Ltd (part of the Choon Hin group of companies owned by the Lims) to take advantage of the lower production costs in Malaysia. 15', 'CJSS was initially incorporated by seven shareholders, which then became six \u2013 the two plaintiffs, the Lims, Simon Puah Koh Choon (\u201cPuah\u201d), and Paul Ho Sang Bin (\u201cHo\u201d) \u2013 in 2015 when one of the original shareholders left. 16', 'Puah and Ho are the Lims\u2019 brothers-in-law. CJSS has now been wound up pursuant to an order of the High Court of Malaya at Johor Bahru, on the application of Tan and Chong. This had been resisted by the Lims and is, as at the time of the trial, pending appeal. 17', '13\\u2003Another Malaysian company which features in these proceedings is CKM Metal Technologies Sdn Bhd (\u201cCKMMT\u201d). 18', 'That company was incorporated in 2014 by Chong and his brother, who were the initial shareholders and directors of CKMMT. Tan joined CKMMT as a shareholder and director not long after. CJSS\u2019s license only permitted 20% of its work to be Malaysian, while the other 80% had to be foreign-related (see [20] below). CKMMT\u2019s predecessor company, CKM Stainless Steel Works, had been set up as a sole proprietorship under Chong as a \u201cstandby\u201d in case CJSS\u2019s Malaysian work exceeded that 20% limit. CKMMT was subsequently incorporated on 16 July 2014 to handle the bulk of CJSS\u2019s Malaysian work, and CKM Stainless Steel Works ceased its business after CKMMT was incorporated. 19', '14\\u2003After having worked full-time at Richinn from 2004 to 2011, Chong was asked by Tan and the Lims to assist in the management of CJSS. 20', 'In 2012 and 2013, Chong worked two days a week at Richinn and spent the rest of the work week at CJSS in Malaysia. From 2014, Chong transferred to work full time at CJSS and CKMMT, where he remained up to the time of the dispute. 21', '15\\u2003For completeness, I should also note that, over the years, as their working relationship grew closer, Chong, Tan, and the Lims also made investments together, either directly or through various corporate vehicles. They invested in a condominium unit at Lakeside Towers in Singapore. In Malaysia, they invested in properties at Yong Peng and Ulu Tiram, and also in two swiftlet houses, which farmed birds\u2019 nests. 22', 'The four of them also held bank accounts in their joint names in Singapore and Malaysia. 23', '16\\u2003On 22 September 2017, there was a monthly management meeting of CJSS, which was held in Singapore. 24', 'The six shareholders and directors of CJSS were present. At that meeting, Robert said that he was facing some health problems. As such, he and Richard wanted to exit from the businesses of CJSS and Richinn. This was a significant development because the Lims were declaring their intention to end the venture between them and the plaintiffs. In their oral evidence at trial, the Lims both agreed that their intention was for both sides to end their business relationship and for the Lims and the plaintiffs to go their separate ways. 25', '17\\u2003There was a discussion which followed at the management meeting where the Lims proposed that CJSS be sold to an \u201coutside buyer\u201d, to which Tan and Chong agreed. A brief note of the important points that arose from this meeting was recorded in a contemporaneous email by Ho, which was sent to the other shareholders on 23 September 2017. 26', 'It was recorded in that note that the necessary corporate and shareholders resolutions would be prepared by the company secretary of CJSS. Significantly, Ho also recorded the shareholders\u2019 agreement that, if there were no buyers for CJSS, the company would \u201ccease operation\u201d and they would \u201ctake necessary action for closure of\u201d CJSS (emphasis added).', '18\\u2003In early October 2017, some of CJSS\u2019s shareholders had a meeting with the auditor of CJSS to discuss the likely value of the company, and to give instructions for the valuation of CJSS\u2019s assets. 27', '19\\u2003On 24 October 2017, the shareholders and directors of CJSS passed written resolutions to the effect that (a) the shares of CJSS would be sold before 31 January 2018; and (b) the machinery of CJSS would be sold after 31 January 2018 if there was no sale of the shares in CJSS. 28', 'It was stipulated in the resolutions that the deadline for the sale, whether it be the machinery or the shares, would be 31 March 2018 or the date on which CJSS paid the final remuneration of its employees, whichever was later. 29', '20\\u2003After this meeting, Puah and Ho were asked by the Lims to take over the management of CJSS from Chong. 30', 'Following this, by early November 2017, CJSS started terminating the employment of its employees as part of the process of winding down its business. 31', 'Ho also instructed Chong not to renew CJSS\u2019s Licensed Manufacturing Warehouse license (\u201cLMW license\u201d), stating that it would be \u201cuseless\u201d. 32', 'For context, it is not in dispute that the LMW license is a license granted by the Malaysian government on the condition that the licensee handles 80% \u201cforeign work\u201d, ie, products for export, and a maximum of 20% \u201clocal work\u201d, ie, products for sale in Malaysia. 33', '21\\u2003As for Richinn, sometime in the middle of October 2017, Tan and Chong made a proposal to acquire the Lims\u2019 shares in the company, which involved a divestment of all their other joint investments in Singapore and Malaysia. 34', 'Tan communicated the offer to Richard. The offer was not accepted by the Lims, but there was no counter-offer from them. Instead, toward the latter part of October 2017, the auditor of Richinn, one Frederick Yap (\u201cYap\u201d), was asked to come up with an indicative valuation of the company. 35', 'On 13 November 2017, Yap circulated his indicative valuation of Richinn, valuing it at approximately S$2.3m. 36', 'At around this time, the Lims indicated that they were expecting to be bought out at a premium. 37', 'While the reasons for this were not expressed, this must have been because the Lims held a controlling 60% stake of Richinn, and therefore felt that their shares accordingly commanded a premium.', '22\\u2003 An extraordinary general meeting (\u201cEGM\u201d) of Richinn\u2019s shareholders was then convened on 29 November 2017. This meeting was audio recorded and the transcripts of the recording were adduced in evidence. The transcripts show that the parties had discussed the possibility of the sale and purchase of the shares in Richinn between the shareholders. From the transcript, it is clear that this was to be a potential sale of the Lims\u2019 shares in Richinn to Tan and Chong, if all parties could agree on a price. 38', 'This is hardly surprising since the Lims\u2019 expressed intention was to exit from the business. If no agreement could be reached on the sale of the shares, the consensus was that the shareholders would proceed with a voluntary winding up of Richinn. 39', 'At the conclusion of the meeting, the following resolutions were unanimously passed by the four shareholders: 40', '23\\u2003In early December, Tan informed the sales and purchasing teams that the Lims would be leaving Richinn. 41', 'His oral evidence was that he did not tell the Richinn employees then that the company would be ceasing its business or that it would be wound up. In this regard, Tan acknowledged that his affidavit of evidence-in-chief at [37] was inaccurate. There, he had claimed that he informed the sales and purchasing teams about the potential winding up of Richinn. 42', 'Tan explained at the trial that his frame of mind then was that he and Chong might yet buy over the Lims\u2019 shares, and it was only if they could not come to an agreement that Richinn would be wound up. 43', '24\\u2003In mid-December 2017, Tan re-activated a dormant company that he owned. 44', 'This was a company that his wife, Mdm Lee, had incorporated in June 2015, called Wow Research Pte Ltd. The purpose of Wow Research Pte Ltd had been to carry out a business in the sale of e-scooters and other personal mobility devices, which it did until sometime in 2016. On 13 December 2017, Tan changed the name of that company to Novatac Pte Ltd (\u201cNovatac\u201d), with the intention that it be used to carry out the business of laser cutting.', '25\\u2003Then, in the second half of December 2017, Tan separately met with two customers of Richinn, FA Systems Automation (S) Pte Ltd (\u201cFA Systems\u201d) 45', 'and Nutek Pte Ltd (\u201cNutek\u201d), 46', 'and he informed them that Richinn might be ceasing its operations very shortly. 47', 'He informed these customers that he would continue being in the laser cutting business and would be operating through Novatac after the cessation of Richinn\u2019s business. Further, in early January 2018, Tan travelled to Sri Lanka, where he met another customer of Richinn\u2019s, Kosan Crisplant Lanka (Private) Limited (\u201cKosan\u201d), which he also informed about the likely cessation of Richinn\u2019s business, and his new laser cutting business through Novatac. 48', '26\\u2003By late December 2017 to early January 2018, Novatac was accepting orders for laser cutting from FA Systems and Nutek. 49', 'Novatac then made back-to-back orders with Richinn for the work commissioned by FA Systems and Nutek. In other words, Novatac was interposed between these two customers and Richinn. There was a mark-up in price between what Novatac charged FA Systems and Nutek, and what Richinn charged Novatac. 50', 'Quite clearly, Novatac was making a profit at the expense of Richinn.', '27\\u2003Tan\u2019s actions were quickly discovered by the Lims. On 8 January 2018, the Lims\u2019 solicitors, KSCGP Juris LLP (\u201cKSCGP\u201d), wrote to Tan about his conduct and accused him of breaching his duties as a director of Richinn. 51', 'What is significant though is that this letter was also addressed to Chong, and also accused him of breaching his duties as a director. However, it was common ground by the time of the trial that Chong was not aware of what Tan had done, whether before or at the time of Tan\u2019s actions. 52', 'Chong was not even aware of the existence of Novatac until he was told by Tan after they had received KSCGP\u2019s letter. 53', '28\\u2003It is also notable that KSCGP\u2019s letter of 8 January 2018 also touched on other matters apart from Novatac. It also raised a number of serious allegations against both Tan and Chong. 54', 'These included the allegations that they had misappropriated Richinn\u2019s customer information, diverted the business of Richinn to CKMMT, were competing with Richinn through companies such as Straits Industries Pte Ltd, and had persistently prevented the Lims from having access to Richinn\u2019s accounts. What is not disputed is that there was no evidence before me in these proceedings that any of these allegations against Tan and Chong were substantiated. 55', '29\\u2003KSCGP\u2019s letter ended with a statement that an EGM of Richinn would be convened to remove both Tan and Chong as directors of the company. 56', 'True to their word, what shortly followed was a notice signed off by the Lims as directors of Richinn dated 11 January 2018, giving notice of an EGM to be convened on 26 January 2018 to pass resolutions for, inter alia, the removal of Tan and Chong as directors of the company. 57', '30\\u2003Two days later, on 13 January 2018, another notice of an EGM for Richinn was issued. 58', 'In this second notice, the proposed resolutions to be passed at the EGM, scheduled for a new date on 29 January 2018, were now changed to merely terminating the \u201cmanaging powers\u201d of Tan and Chong, and also terminating their employment as executives of the company. To replace them, it was proposed that Richard be appointed as the managing director of Richinn. In this second notice, there was a further proposed resolution to revoke the resolution of the company made at the EGM of 29 November 2017 that Richinn proceed with a members\u2019 voluntary winding up if there was no agreement reached on the sale and purchase of the shares in the company.', '31\\u2003Not unexpectedly, given the serious allegations now raised against Tan and Chong, the two of them declined to meet with the Lims to discuss the sale and purchase of the shares in Richinn, as had been envisaged in the shareholders\u2019 resolutions passed on 29 November 2017.', '32\\u2003At the EGM on 29 January 2018, Tan and Chong were absent. The Lims then proceeded to pass the resolutions referred to at [30] above. 59', 'As such, both Tan and Chong were removed from their executive positions in Richinn, though they continued to remain as directors of the company. I should just add for completeness that Tan and Chong resigned from their directorships of Richinn on 25 June 2019. 60', '33\\u2003On 27 April 2018, Tan and Chong commenced proceedings by way of an originating summons seeking to wind up Richinn on three separate but related grounds: (a) that the shareholders had agreed by their resolutions passed on 29 November 2017 to wind up the company; (b) that the Lims had acted in a manner that constitutes minority oppression; and (c) that it would be just and equitable for the company to be wound up. 61', 'On 20 September 2018, by consent of the parties, I ordered that the proceedings be converted into writ proceedings given the substantial disputes of facts that were raised in the affidavits filed by the parties. 62', '34\\u2003In the meantime, the Lims caused Richinn to commence Suit 1008 of 2018 (\u201cSuit 1008\u201d) against, inter alia, Tan and Chong, claiming that they had breached their duties as directors of the company by, inter alia, (a) carrying on a laser cutting business in competition with Richinn using two entities \u2013 first with Novatac and then later with, inter alia, another company called Brown Metal Engineering Pte Ltd (\u201cBME\u201d); 63', 'and (b) causing and\/or conspiring to cause and conceal the diversion of business away from Richinn to, in particular, Novatac and BME. 64', 'It was alleged that Tan commenced competing with Richinn and diverting business to Novatac from December 2017, 65', 'while for Chong, it appears that he only became a director and shareholder of Novatac in August 2019. 66', 'As for BME, it was alleged that Tan and Chong became shareholders and directors of BME on or about 11 June 2018, and that competition and diversion of business occurred at or around that time. 67', 'In addition, several former employees of Richinn were also named as defendants in Suit 1008 because they had left Richinn to join Novatac and\/or BME. These ex-employees were accused of conspiring with Tan and Chong to cause loss to Richinn. Novatac and BME were also defendants in Suit 1008 because they too were alleged to be part of the conspiracy.', '35\\u2003Suit 1008 was then consolidated with this suit, and the consolidated action proceeded to trial before me. On 17 March 2020, in the midst of the trial, I was informed by counsel that Suit 1008 was settled. I granted leave for Richinn to discontinue Suit 1008, with no order as to costs. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed to me.', '36\\u2003Tan and Chong also commenced proceedings in Malaysia to seek the winding up of CJSS on the ground that it would be just and equitable to do so. After four days of hearing in 2019, where Chong and Robert were cross-examined, the High Court of Malaya at Johor Bahru (Commercial Division) found that CJSS was a quasi-partnership, and that the relationship of trust and confidence between the shareholders had broken down due to the Lims\u2019 actions. 68', 'On 24 September 2019, the court made an order that CJSS was to be wound up. The Lims, Ho, and Puah have appealed against that decision, and as at the time of this trial, that appeal remains pending. In the meantime, the order for winding up against CJSS has been stayed pending the appeal.', '37\\u2003I should further add that the Lims have also commenced proceedings in Malaysia claiming that, inter alia, Tan and Chong hold shares in CKMMT on their behalf. This is denied by Tan and Chong, who claim to own the entirety of the legal and beneficial interests of their shareholdings in CKMMT. 69', 'Those proceedings are underway in Malaysia, and nothing stated in this judgment is intended to express any opinion on the merits of that dispute.'"}

{"casename":"2020_SGHC_227","fact":"'4\\u2003The facts surrounding the applicant\u2019s conviction and subsequent acquittal have been comprehensively set out in the Judge\u2019s decision in Parti Liyani (HC). I therefore mention only the salient facts relevant to the present application. The applicant was a foreign worker, employed as a domestic helper by Mr Liew. In October 2016, Mr Liew filed a police report against the applicant, alleging that she had stolen numerous items from members of the Liew household. The applicant\u2019s complaint in OS 559 is confined to the DPPs\u2019 conduct in relation to the Device, which was one of the items that formed the subject of the s 381 charge. In brief, the applicant\u2019s defence at trial and on appeal in relation to the Device was that it was faulty and that Mr Liew\u2019s wife, Mdm Ng Lai Peng (\u201cMdm Ng\u201d), had told her this and indicated that she wished to dispose of it (see Parti Liyani (DC) at [22]; Parti Liyani (HC) at [80]). The applicant maintained that it was in these circumstances that she came into possession of the Device.', '5\\u2003At trial, the functionality of the Device became a live issue. Both parties sought to address and eventually took divergent positions on this before the District Judge (\u201cthe DJ\u201d). On 16 August 2018, under cross-examination, Mr Liew testified that he did not think the Device was in working condition because it had not been used in a long time. While he admitted the possibility that the applicant might have asked Mdm Ng whether she could take the Device and get it fixed for her use in Indonesia, he declined to speculate whether such a conversation had taken place. Subsequently, on 17 August 2018 and 7 September 2018, in the course of her examination-in-chief and cross-examination respectively, Mdm Ng testified that the Device was in fact functional and further that the applicant had never sought permission to take it.', '6\\u2003As against this, on 25 September 2018, in the course of her examination-in-chief, the applicant testified that Mdm Ng had told her that the Device was damaged and that she intended to throw it away. While there were slight inconsistencies in the applicant\u2019s evidence as to whether Mdm Ng had explicitly allowed her to take the Device or if she had simply taken it after being told it was to be discarded because it was not working (see Parti Liyani (HC) at [95]), her position even prior to the trial (as disclosed in the Case for the Defence and her statements), had been that she had believed the Device was spoilt.', '7\\u2003On 26 September 2018, during the cross-examination of the applicant, the DPPs conducted a demonstration of the Device. Some images were displayed on a monitor when the Device was connected to it via a HDMI cable. The DPPs did not inform the court, the applicant or her counsel, Mr Anil Balchandani (\u201cMr Balchandani\u201d), that the Device had been operating in the HDD mode (see [10] below) or that they had difficulties playing a \u201cCapitaland\u201d DVD, which had been found in the Device, earlier that morning (see [15] below). However, Ms Tan, when asked by the DJ, said that she had not inserted anything into the Device prior to her demonstration (see [32] below). Under cross-examination by Ms Tan, the applicant agreed that the Device had been working during the demonstration. Since the applicant herself had not claimed at any time to have tested the Device, the point of this was primarily to demonstrate that if the Device was working, it was implausible that Mdm Ng would have said that it was not, or for that matter, that she would have wanted to discard the Device. This would contradict the applicant\u2019s contention and undermine her case. Ms Tan then put to the applicant that she had been lying when she claimed that Mdm Ng had told her the Device was spoilt.', '8\\u2003On 27 September 2018, during the lunch recess, Mr Balchandani sought and was afforded the opportunity to inspect the Device with the assistance of the DPPs. Thereafter, he informed the court that the Device was not functional despite the DPPs\u2019 demonstration the previous day. The DJ invited him to take the issue up in re-examination since the DPPs were still in the midst of their cross-examination of the applicant at that point.', '9\\u2003On 20 November 2018, during the re-examination of the applicant, Mr Balchandani highlighted to the DJ that the DPPs had in their demonstration used certain equipment which was not part of the courtroom (presumably he was referring to the HDMI cable which the DPPs had brought and used) and that therefore he was at a disadvantage. From this, he argued that, amongst other things, the DJ ought to consider the fact that the DPPs had not shown how the Liew household had used the Device, specifically how it was connected to any television, for instance. The implication appeared to have been that the specific setup might have a bearing on the functionality of the Device and the veracity of the applicant\u2019s defence. In response, Ms Tan stated that Mr Balchandani misunderstood the purpose of their demonstration which was \u201cin relation to the [applicant\u2019s] evidence on the condition of [the Device]\u201d and notably, that their demonstration \u201cproved that [the Device] was indeed working\u201d [emphasis added].', '10\\u2003On 4 December 2018, Mr Balchandani conducted a live demonstration of the Device during the continued re-examination of the applicant. Ms Tan objected to the relevance of his demonstration, contending that Mr Balchandani would, in doing so, be giving evidence from the Bar. She further submitted that there had been \u201cno confusion\u201d as to whether the Device could work since the applicant had \u201ctestified explicitly and expressly\u201d on this issue, and the DJ had already seen the demonstration on 26 September 2018. Notwithstanding these objections, Mr Balchandani was allowed to proceed. It emerged that the Device had two modes in which it could function: the first was the DVD mode, in which DVDs could be played; the second was the HDD mode, in which images could be recorded on the Device\u2019s hard drive and then played back. In addition to the \u201cCapitaland\u201d DVD which had been found in the Device, Mr Balchandani also brought along other DVDs. When Mr Balchandani attempted to play the \u201cCapitaland\u201d DVD and another DVD he had brought on the Device using the DVD mode, various error messages were displayed. However, when the Device was switched to HDD mode, the footage that had been displayed during the DPPs\u2019 demonstration appeared on the monitor. On this basis, Mr Balchandani observed that the DPPs had not informed the court that they had operated the Device using the HDD function during their demonstration. He stated that while the DPPs had conducted their demonstration in the manner they did to show that the Device was working, he had shown that to be untrue.', '11\\u2003While the applicant did not specifically refer to this, for completeness it should be noted that in the closing submissions, the DPPs argued that the fact the Device had failed to play a DVD which Mr Balchandani had brought and inserted was more likely to have been because of a problem with Mr Balchandani\u2019s DVD rather than the functionality of the Device. Their submissions also did not mention the fact that their own demonstration had utilised the HDD mode of the Device; nor did they address the difficulties that Mr Balchandani had encountered in attempting to play back the \u201cCapitaland\u201d DVD. The DPPs further submitted that the applicant\u2019s case that the Device had been discarded by Mdm Ng because it was spoilt had been \u201crubbished by the demonstrations in court which clearly showed that the said items [including the Device] were working\u201d.', '12\\u2003In the light of what transpired, the applicant alleged in her closing submissions before the DJ that the DPPs\u2019 actions showed \u201ca larger scheme \u2026 to mislead the court\u201d. This was because the Device could not have been operating in the HDD mode without it being deliberately engaged and the DPPs had \u201cprovided no explanation of what they were doing\u201d and \u201chow they got the [Device] to display the moving image\u201d during the demonstration. According to the applicant, the DPPs \u201cknew they were fudging the facts so they could score an immediate victory and discredit [the applicant]\u201d and had performed their demonstration in the shortest time possible \u201cto catch [Mr Balchandani] off-guard\u201d. In their reply submissions, the DPPs argued that their demonstration had been done \u201copenly\u201d, and proved that the Device had been working because it had been able to turn on, open, close and display appropriate error messages.', '13\\u2003At the end of the trial, the DJ held that the key question in relation to the Device was not its functionality but rather whether the applicant had permission to take the Device. On this, the DJ accepted Mdm Ng\u2019s evidence that the applicant had not had permission to do so. The DJ also relied on what she considered was an admission by the applicant to this fact in her statements (see Parti Liyani (DC) at [22]\u2013[23]). No finding was made as to the Device\u2019s functionality or whether Mdm Ng had intended to throw it away. I digress to observe that the DJ appeared not to have appreciated the potential significance of whether the Device was or was not working in assessing the credibility of Mdm Ng and the applicant. It was not disputed that the applicant had not herself tested the Device. However, if it turned out that the Device was faulty, it would lend weight to her contention that she had been told it was faulty; and would cut against Mdm Ng\u2019s contention that it was perfectly functional. This could then bear on the credibility of each of them on the question of whether the Device had been discarded or not.', '14\\u2003On appeal, the Judge thought that the evidence as to the working condition of the Device was in fact of crucial relevance to the applicant\u2019s defence. In this regard, the Prosecution conceded on appeal that during the trial, difficulties had been encountered when attempts were made to play a DVD using the Device. However, it could play the clip that was recorded on the hard drive. The Judge noted that the fact that there had been at least some difficulties with the functionality of the Device had not been disclosed to the applicant prior to her being cross-examined on the Device\u2019s condition or to the DJ in the trial below (see Parti Liyani (HC) at [90]). The Judge considered that the Device could fairly be described as spoilt in so far as the DVD function appeared to be faulty. Accordingly, he accepted the applicant\u2019s defence that her employers had no longer wanted the faulty Device and acquitted the applicant of the s 381 charge in relation to the Device (see Parti Liyani (HC) at [94]\u2013[96]).', '15\\u2003The DPPs stated in the affidavit they filed on 4 August 2020 in support of their application to intervene in OS 559 (see [21] below) that on the morning of 26 September 2018, before the commencement of the day\u2019s hearing, they had tested the Device on their own.

{"casename":"2020_SGHC_228","fact":"'2\\u2003Mr Leong (the \u201cappellant\u201d) was the accredited checker for the construction of the viaduct. As outlined in the statement of facts, which the appellant admitted to without qualification, he was appointed in June 2016 pursuant to s 8 of the BC Act as an accredited checker by the Land Transport Authority (the \u201cDeveloper\u201d) for the building works related to the construction and completion of the viaduct. 3', 'At the material time, the other parties involved in the construction of the viaduct were one Robert Arianto Tjandra, the qualified person (\u201cQP\u201d) appointed under s 11 of the BC Act to design the building works of the viaduct and the QP appointed under s 8 of the Act to supervise the building works of the viaduct, and Or Kim Peow Contractors (Private) Limited, the builder of the viaduct.', '3\\u2003The viaduct itself is, as described in the statement of facts, approximately 1.8 kilometres long. It consists of eight flyovers. Each flyover is a monolithic structure supported by five to nine columns which are integrated with the flyover structure. Each flyover has expansion joints at each end.', '4\\u2003Each end of a flyover rests on a permanent corbel, a short reinforced concrete projection from the crosshead at an expansion joint. Part of the vehicular load on a flyover would have been transferred to an independent column through the permanent corbel. The permanent corbels are a key structural element of the viaduct as they are essential for the support and overall structural stability of the viaduct.', '5\\u2003The appellant accepted that under s 18(1) of the BC Act read with paragraph 7(1) of the Building Control (Accredited Checkers and Accredited Checking Organisations) Regulations (Cap 29, Rg 2, 2002 Rev Ed) (the \u201cRegulations\u201d), he was under a duty as the accredited checker to evaluate, analyse, and review the structural design in the plans of any building works and perform such original calculations with a view to determining the adequacy of the key structural elements of the building to be erected or affected by the building works carried out in accordance with those plans. Section 2(1) of the BC Act defines \u201ckey structural elements\u201d to mean the foundations, columns, beams, shear cores, structural walls, struts, ground anchors, and such other parts of a building which are essential for its support and overall structural stability. It is admitted by the appellant that the permanent corbels were a key structural element for the purposes of the abovementioned duty.', '6\\u2003On 14 July 2017, the crossheads at two piers of the viaduct, which were temporary structures, gave way. As a result, the precast girders and formwork supporting the casting of the concrete deck slab of the viaduct collapsed, tragically causing the death of one worker involved in the building works at the material time and injuring ten others with varying degrees of injury. Following that collapse, which did not implicate the appellant, the calculations for the whole structure were checked and several of the permanent corbels were found to have been inadequately designed (see [8] below in particular).', '7\\u2003It was not contested that in the design calculations submitted to the Building and Construction Authority (\u201cBCA\u201d) for the relevant plans of the viaduct works, there were no independent calculations for the permanent corbels of the viaduct prepared or submitted by the appellant. Further, the appellant, as the accredited checker, acknowledged that he had failed to evaluate, analyse, and review the structural design in the relevant plans and perform original calculations for the permanent corbels of the viaduct, as was his statutory duty under the BC Act.', '8\\u2003On 26 July 2017, in the midst of the BCA\u2019s investigations, the appellant initially claimed that he had performed original calculations, checked the adequacy of the permanent corbels, and found them to be adequate. The appellant was then asked to provide evidence of such original calculations, but was unable to do so. He admitted on 21 September 2017 to having been untruthful in his initial claim, and conceded that no calculations had been done on his part at all. Subsequently, investigations revealed that corbels at eight out of the 10 piers with permanent corbels were inadequately designed, with five piers being unable to support their intended weight during the construction stage. These five permanent corbels would have collapsed during the casting of the slab at the construction stage. As for the remaining three piers, while they may have supported the requisite weight during the construction stage, the corbels would have showed significant structural cracks upon the viaduct being opened to a full traffic load, leading to sudden brittle failure and in turn leading to collapse.', '9\\u2003Apart from the consequences already outlined at [6] and [8] above, the collapse of the viaduct caused the estimated completion date for the construction of the viaduct to be delayed by at least two years. For the avoidance of doubt, however, I reiterate that the collapse of the viaduct on 14 July 2017 was not caused by any of the permanent corbels which formed the subject matter of the proceeded charge against the appellant. Rather, the appellant\u2019s failure to properly evaluate, analyse, and review the structural designs and plans for the permanent corbels was discovered before any actual harm was caused.'"}

In its covering email, the Bank suggested to the arbitrator that there was no necessity for witnesses to be called as the dispute between the parties turned \u201cprimarily on the contractual interpretation\u201d of the second agreement only [emphasis in original]. Furthermore, while the Buyer had put forward a list of witnesses, \u201cit [had] not explained its position\/reasons for calling these witnesses\u201d. 39', 'On its part, the Bank informed the arbitrator that it was not intending to call any witnesses or submit any witness statements. Accordingly, the Bank submitted that the arbitration should proceed on a documents-only basis. Alternatively, should the arbitrator find that an oral hearing was necessary, the Bank suggested that, pursuant to r 28.1 of the SCMA Rules, such a hearing could be conducted for the hearing of oral submissions only, without the need for any witnesses to be called. 40', '30\\u2003At this juncture, two points must be noted. The first is in relation to the arbitrator\u2019s request that parties consider a \u201cdocuments-only\u201d arbitration (see [26] above). While there is no fixed definition of a documents-only arbitration, this commonly refers to an arbitration that is to be determined without an oral hearing. The arbitral tribunal will review the written documents and arguments submitted by the parties before making its decision. The tribunal does not hold an oral hearing for the presentation of evidence or for oral argument (see Arbitration in Singapore: A Practical Guide (Sundaresh Menon et al) (Sweet & Maxwell, 2nd Ed, 2018) at para 11.041). The written documents that parties submit may include pleadings, documentary evidence and, in certain instances, witness statements (see, eg, Taigo Ltd v China Master Shipping Ltd [2010] HKEC 952 at [5]). It would be obvious from my description that a documents-only arbitration, where parties have submitted witness statements, would only be available if all parties are of the view that (i) there is no need to cross-examine any of the witnesses on their witness statements, and (ii) they are content to make written submissions to the arbitral tribunal, without the need for any oral submissions.', '31\\u2003The second point is that the precise request of the Bank was for the arbitrator to decide whether there was any need for witness testimony, be it by way of witness statements or oral evidence, in order for the dispute in the arbitration to be determined. The Bank\u2019s position was that there was no need for any witness testimony. This is quite different from a request that the arbitrator proceed on a documents-only basis which, as I have explained above, may include the submission of witness statements, but with no cross-examination of the makers of the statements.', '32\\u2003Following the Bank\u2019s proposal for the disposition of witnesses, the arbitrator asked the Buyer to provide \u201cits position\/reasons for calling the 7 witnesses and\/or the need for their oral testimony.\u201d 41', 'In response, the Buyer replied, emphasising that \u201can Oral Hearing is required and necessary.\u201d 42', 'No detailed arguments were furnished, except that the witnesses had \u201cto be examined and evidenced [sic] adduced with respect to the submissions made by [the Buyer] in its defence.\u201d 43', 'Finding the Buyer\u2019s response to be unsatisfactory, the arbitrator again requested \u201ca descriptive basis of what [the Buyer] expects to develop with the introduction of the proposed witnesses\u201d. 44', 'To this, the Buyer re-asserted that \u201c[t]here is a necessity of examining the witnesses\u201d as \u201cthe case does not solely turn on the documents (sic) interpretation as submitted by\u201d the Bank. 45', '33\\u2003After the above exchange, the arbitrator then made a direction on 1 June 2018 that, before he was to rule on whether it would be a \u201cdocuments-only\u201d proceeding or if an oral hearing was necessary, he would require detailed written statements from each of the Buyer\u2019s named witnesses. 46', '34\\u2003The Buyer replied on the same day, stating that it was a breach of the rules of natural justice for the arbitrator to require the Buyer to submit a written statement from each witness before he decided whether to hold an oral hearing for the witnesses to be examined. It was also highlighted than some of the witnesses which it intended to call were representatives of the Seller. Further, it was submitted that an oral hearing was necessary for the Buyer to cross-examine these witnesses. In closing, the Buyer refused to provide any of the witness statements that was requested by the arbitrator, stating that any submission of such statements before the arbitrator\u2019s decision as to whether an oral hearing would be held was \u201ccontrary to [the] interest of justice and law.\u201d 47', '35\\u2003The arbitrator replied to the Buyer\u2019s email on 4 June 2018, assuring parties that he had not made any decisions on whether a hearing ought to be held and if so, what the form of such hearing would be. The arbitrator also informed parties that, pursuant to r 33.1(c) of the SCMA Rules, he had the authority to \u201cconduct such enquiries as may appear to the Tribunal to be necessary or expedient\u201d. 48', '36\\u2003The Buyer replied on 6 June 2018, stating that the calling of witnesses was within its entitlement under r 28.1 of the SCMA Rules, which provides that an arbitrator \u201cshall hold a hearing for the presentation of evidence by witnesses, including expert witnesses, or for oral submissions\u201d [emphasis added] unless parties have agreed on a documents-only arbitration. This rule, in the Buyer\u2019s view, was \u201cclear and simple\u201d; since the Buyer had not agreed to a documents-only arbitration, an oral hearing ought to be held for it to present its witness testimony. The Buyer further stated that the SCMA Rules did not impede its ability to call witnesses even if it failed to provide detailed written statements of its witnesses. 49', '37\\u2003The arbitrator replied on 7 June 2018 stating, with unmistakable sarcasm, that it was \u201cencouraging to see that [the Buyer had] a copy of the applicable SCMA rules to hand\u201d.

However, the arbitrator also stated that, pursuant to the same rule, there would be no witnesses presented at the hearing as the Buyer had \u201cfailed to provide witness statements or any evidence of the substantive value of presenting witnesses.\u201d Finally, it was directed that the Buyer\u2019s counterclaim would not be heard at the oral hearing as the Buyer had failed to deposit the necessary funds with the SCMA despite having been requested to do so on several occasions. 54', '41\\u2003A day before the hearing was due to be conducted, on 20 August 2018, the Buyer wrote to the arbitrator to reiterate that the denial of witness examination was \u201ca violation of [the] principles of natural justice and also against the principles of [a] full and fair hearing.\u201d In the absence of a full and fair hearing of its witnesses, it asserted that the hearing would be a \u201cmere formality\u201d, and that the arbitrator had pre-judged the matter. 55', 'In response, the arbitrator wrote to the parties assuring them that he had not made up his mind on the matter, and that he had only briefly reviewed the submissions. 56', '42\\u2003On 21 August 2018, the arbitrator conducted the hearing via telephone, which was delayed from 15:00 to 15:15 to give the Buyer additional time to phone in to participate.

No new or additional documents, evidence or submissions were presented by the Bank during the hearing. 57', '43\\u2003The final award was issued on 16 November 2018. 58', 'The arbitrator found that two of the main issues were (a) whether the contractual quantity and quality of coal had been delivered pursuant to the terms of the second agreement; and (b) whether there was an agreement between the Buyer and the Seller for a price adjustment. 59', '44\\u2003With regard to the first issue, the arbitrator found that 20,000 MT of coal had been delivered by the Seller, as this was supported by the documentation provided.

{"casename":"2020_SGHC_230","fact":"'5\\u2003The respondent admitted to the Statement of Facts (\u201cSOF\u201d) without qualification. At the material time, he was a 30-year old Singaporean permanent resident and a British citizen, employed as a fuel oil trader with Lukoil.', '6\\u2003In or around March 2016, Lukoil entered into a contract with a buyer, Transocean, for the sale and purchase of high sulphur fuel oil. Under the contract, Transocean would order oil in tranches from Lukoil. To trigger the delivery of each tranche, Transocean would inform Lukoil of the quantity of oil it wanted to purchase for that order. The price of the oil purchased was based on the date on which the trigger (ie, purchase) was declared by Transocean.', '7\\u2003The respondent was the sole trader in charge of the contract with Transocean. The respondent was tasked to contemporaneously enter the details of each trade into Lukoil\u2019s internal record system, including the time, quantity, price and\/or exposure for that trade. He also had to contemporaneously carry out back-to-back trades in order to hedge the trade and cover pricing exposure resulting from the trade on the same day, in order to prevent Lukoil from suffering huge losses. However, the respondent failed to contemporaneously hedge all the trades relating to the Transocean contract which were carried out between 6 April and 29 July 2016. Instead, he attempted to wait for a more favourable price to hedge the trades in order to gain a financial advantage for his fuel oil book. The respondent\u2019s delayed entering of the trigger declarations received from Transocean and his consequent late hedging at a correspondingly higher price resulted in losses to Lukoil. Of the 18 irregular trades performed, 17 trades led to losses amounting to S$1,024,208 in total. This figure was based on further clarificatory evidence adduced by way of Criminal Motion 34 of 2020 brought by the appellant, which I had allowed.', '8\\u2003Lukoil used daily mark-to-market updates to monitor its trading position and risk exposure. The mark-to-market updates were intended to provide Lukoil with a realistic appraisal of its financial situation based on prevailing market conditions. However, the respondent entered false mark-to-market updates projecting gains into Lukoil\u2019s system, so as to negate or mitigate the losses caused by the irregular trades. These false updates therefore concealed the losses resulting from the late hedging. The respondent\u2019s recording of false mark-to-market updates in Lukoil\u2019s system was the subject of the charges under s 477A of the Penal Code. In respect of the five proceeded charges, the false entries were made from 17 May to 1 July 2016.', '9\\u2003The respondent later cancelled the Transocean contract prematurely without the approval or knowledge of Lukoil\u2019s management, and resigned from Lukoil a day after having done so, on 29 July 2016. These events led to internal investigations, which were carried out by Lukoil, and the subsequent discovery of the offences. A police report was lodged on 3 February 2017 with the Commercial Affairs Department, alleging that the respondent had backdated trades that resulted in losses for Lukoil.', '10\\u2003As the respondent did not cooperate with police investigations, significant investigative resources had to be expended between March 2017 and April 2018. The respondent eventually admitted to the offences on 28 April 2018. The respondent also gave false information in his statements that his colleagues could have performed the irregular trades.'"}

Her younger brother and sister were aged 11 and 9 years old respectively. Among the three children, the victim shared the closest relationship with the accused.', '5\\u2003Following a divorce from the victim\u2019s father in October 2002, the victim\u2019s mother and her three children (including the victim) lived with the victim\u2019s grandmother in a flat located in Woodlands (the \u201cWoodlands Flat\u201d). The victim\u2019s mother and the accused began a romantic relationship sometime in 2013. The accused was known to the three children as \u201cUncle Adam\u201d. On occasion, he would stay overnight in the living room of the Woodlands Flat. The victim\u2019s mother and the three children slept in one of the bedrooms.', '6\\u2003In July 2015, the victim\u2019s mother and her three children moved into a two-room rental flat (the \u201cFlat\u201d). In August 2015, the accused moved into the Flat. He purchased groceries for the household and, every two weeks, provided the victim\u2019s mother with an allowance of $150 to $200.', '7\\u2003The household was akin to a family, and the accused assumed the role of a father figure to all three children. The accused and the three children did many things together, such as playing, watching television, travelling to Malaysia and going for walks and swims. On occasion, the victim would play with the accused\u2019s head and sit on his stomach when he was lying down.', '8\\u2003In March 2016, the accused and the victim\u2019s mother quarrelled. Subsequently, the accused moved out of the Flat. In August 2016, he eventually moved back into the flat. While he lived at the Flat, the accused and the victim\u2019s mother had sexual intercourse about once or twice a week. It was sometime in August 2016 that the facts pertaining to the fourth and seventh charges, as set out below at [12] and [15] respectively, took place.', '9\\u2003In December 2016, the victim\u2019s mother stopped having sexual intercourse with the accused because she became more religious. She did not want to have sex until the couple got married. Around the end of February 2017, the accused moved out of the Flat, though he still visited the household occasionally. The facts pertaining to the 23rd charge took place after the accused moved out, sometime on the night of 28 April 2017 (see [18] to [20] below).', '10\\u2003The relevant period during which the accused sexually abused the victim in the Flat was between 26 February 2016 and 28 April 2017, a time span of 14 months. During this period, the victim was nine to ten years old. The accused committed the acts at night when the victim\u2019s mother was not beside the victim, who the accused knew slept on the extreme right side of her two siblings. He did so because (a) the victim\u2019s mother did not satisfy his sexual urges, and (b) the victim\u2019s grandmother did not accept him into the family and the accused wanted to get back at her by abusing the victim, who was her grandmother\u2019s favourite grandchild. What follows are the particulars of the three proceeded charges, namely the fourth, the seventh and the 23rd charges.', '11\\u2003 One night in August 2016, when the victim was ten years old, she was sleeping on a sofa bed in the living room along with her siblings. The accused, who wore only a pair of pants without a top or underwear, and the victim\u2019s mother were sleeping in a bedroom.', '12\\u2003Sometime during the night, the accused laid down beside the victim (who was sleeping sideways on the sofa cushions) and pulled her close to him. Covering both the victim and himself with a blanket to conceal his actions, the accused pulled the victim\u2019s shorts and panties down to her thighs, spat saliva on his palm, and rubbed her buttocks and vulva with his fingers. The accused then sexually penetrated the victim\u2019s vagina with his finger without her consent. As a result, the victim felt a sharp pain in her vagina which she had not felt before.', '13\\u2003Thereafter, the accused rubbed his erect penis between her anus and vagina for a few minutes. The victim also felt pain. When the accused stopped his actions, the victim pulled her shorts up and washed herself up in the toilet. She continued to feel pain in her vagina.', '14\\u2003A few weeks later, in the same month of August 2016, the victim, along with her siblings, was in the Flat sleeping on the living room\u2019s sofa cushions. The victim\u2019s mother and the accused, who wore only a pair of pants without a top or underwear, were sleeping in a bedroom.', '15\\u2003Sometime during the night, the accused laid down beside the victim and pulled her close to him. Covering both the victim and himself with a blanket to conceal his actions, the accused pulled the victim\u2019s shorts and panties down to her knees, spat saliva on his palm, and rubbed her buttocks and vulva with his fingers. The accused then sexually penetrated the victim\u2019s vagina with his finger without her consent. Consequently, the victim felt a sharp pain in her vagina. Moreover, the victim could not move her body because the accused had grabbed her close to him.', '16\\u2003Then, the accused rubbed his erect penis between the victim\u2019s anus and vagina. The victim felt a lot of pain. Once the accused stopped, the victim pulled her shorts up and washed herself in the toilet. After this episode, the victim felt pain when she urinated.', '17\\u2003On 27 April 2017, the victim\u2019s mother, having been hospitalised, entrusted the accused to take care of the victim and her two siblings. On 28 April 2017, the accused fetched the victim from school because she had a fever.', '18\\u2003On the night of 28 April 2017, the victim and her siblings were sleeping on a mattress in the Flat\u2019s living room. By the time that the accused returned from visiting the victim\u2019s mother in hospital, the siblings were asleep. At the material time, the accused was wearing only a pair of shorts without a top or underwear.', '19\\u2003Sometime later that night, the accused laid beside the victim, who was sleeping sideways on the mattress. He covered both the victim and himself with a blanket to conceal his actions. After pulling the victim\u2019s pants and panties down to her knees, the accused pulled her towards him.', '20\\u2003On this occasion, he began by rubbing his erect penis between her anus and vagina. Spitting saliva into his hand, he rubbed the victim\u2019s vulva with his fingers. The victim felt pain. The accused then sexually penetrated the victim\u2019s vagina with his finger without her consent. The victim experienced sharp pain in her vagina.', '21\\u2003Subsequently, the accused slid his hand into the victim\u2019s bra to squeeze and pinch her breasts. The victim felt pain and tried to pull his hand away, but to no avail. When the accused stopped, the victim pulled her pants and panties up and went to the toilet to wash herself.', '22\\u2003On 30 April 2017, the victim\u2019s mother was discharged after being hospitalised for three days.', '23\\u2003On 5 May 2017, the victim told her primary school teacher that the accused had touched her private parts. The victim did not want the accused to touch her anymore. She was worried that the accused would use her mother\u2019s illness as an excuse to stay overnight again. Accordingly, the victim\u2019s school alerted the Ministry of Social and Family Development. That same day, the victim\u2019s Child Protection Officer lodged a police report that the victim had been sexually assaulted by the accused. Later that day, the accused was arrested.', '24\\u2003Following his arrest, the accused was assessed at the Institute of Mental Health (\u201cIMH\u201d). A report from the IMH dated 1 June 2017 (the \u201cIMH report\u201d) states that the accused had no depressive or psychotic symptoms prior to 27 April 2017.

To address those concerns, the plaintiff amended the 2012 BCA Plans to elevate the softscape areas by 300mm from the hardscape areas.', '8\\u2003In April 2012, the FSSD approved the plaintiff\u2019s plans as amended. I shall refer to these amended plans as \u201cthe 2012 FSSD Plans\u201d. From April 2012, therefore, the 2012 FSSD Plans became the building plans for the construction of Oxley Tower in place of the 2012 BCA Plans.', '9\\u2003In November 2012, the defendant\u2019s representatives visited the showroom for Oxley Tower and received a copy of the plaintiff\u2019s marketing brochure. The marketing brochure stated expressly that its contents were based on building plans for Oxley Tower described by a particular building plan number and dated 6 March 2012. 4', 'The only building plans which match the description in the brochure are the 2012 BCA Plans. It appears therefore that the plaintiffs did not amend the brochure to reflect the amendments to the 2012 BCA Plans. The brochure therefore does not mention the 2012 FSSD Plans or depict the softscape areas as elevated from the hardscape areas. As shown in the 2012 BCA Plans, the illustrations in the brochure show the softscape areas on the fourth floor flush with the hardscape areas. 5', '10\\u2003The defendant decided to purchase both Unit 1 and Unit 2. The defendant completed two reservation forms, one for each Unit. The reservation forms are a precursor to an option to purchase. The defendant\u2019s reservation of Unit 2 for purchase was unconditional. But its reservation of Unit 1 was conditional. The condition was recorded in the reservation form for Unit 1 by the following manuscript words inserted just above the signature of the defendant\u2019s representative: \u201cThis unit is purchased based on converting from gym\/spa to restaurant (exactly like #04-02)\u201d. 6', 'What the defendant wanted was for the plaintiff to make two changes to Unit 1 to make it exactly like Unit 2: (a) change the indoor area of Unit 1 from a gym or a spa to a restaurant; and (b) change its outdoor area from a swimming pool to a garden.', '11\\u2003In late November 2012, the plaintiff granted the defendant an option to purchase Unit 2 at $12m. The defendant paid the 5% booking fee for Unit 2 unconditionally.', '12\\u2003A few days later, the plaintiff granted the defendant a separate option to purchase Unit 1 at just over $9m. But the plaintiff had not yet confirmed that the two changes to Unit 1 were feasible. The plaintiff therefore granted to the defendant a conditional option to purchase Unit 1 and received the defendants\u2019 booking fee conditionally. The condition was that if the plaintiff subsequently informed the defendant that the two changes to Unit 1 were not possible, the defendant could cancel the option for Unit 1 and receive a full refund of its booking fee. 7', '13\\u2003Having consulted its architects, the plaintiff confirmed to the defendant that it was indeed possible to carry out the two changes to Unit 1. 8', 'The defendant therefore decided to proceed with the purchase of Unit 1.', '14\\u2003 The parties then exchanged drafts of the sale and purchase agreements for both Units. As required by s 5 of the Sale of Commercial Properties Act (Cap 281, 1985 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe Act\u201d) read with r 7 of the Sale of Commercial Properties Rules (Cap 281, R 1, 1999 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe Rules\u201d), the draft agreement for each unit was in the standard form prescribed by Form D to the Rules. I shall refer collectively to the Act and to the Rules, including Form D, as \u201cthe legislative scheme\u201d.', '15\\u2003In the course of their correspondence over the sale and purchase agreements, the plaintiff supplied to the defendant a copy of the BCA Approval 9', '(see [6] above).', '16\\u2003By a letter dated 3 December 2012 (\u201cDecember 2012 Letter\u201d) and addressed to the defendant, the plaintiff set out formally the conditions on which it would agree to carry out the two changes to Unit 1. 10', 'The letter runs to three pages. It subjects the plaintiff\u2019s agreement to carry out the two changes to 19 detailed conditions. It is obvious \u2013 and quite understandable in my view \u2013 that the plaintiff\u2019s solicitors drafted the December 2012 Letter for the plaintiff to issue on its own letterhead.', '17\\u2003The effect of the December 2012 Letter is that, if any of the conditions set out in it were not satisfied, the plaintiff would remain entitled to deliver vacant possession of Unit 1 to the defendant upon completion without the two changes, ie, as a gym or a spa with an outdoor swimming pool.', '18\\u2003The conditions which the plaintiff set out in the December 2012 Letter which are material for present purposes may be summarised as follows:', '(a)\\u2003Subject to the condition which I set out at [18(b)] below:', '(b)\\u2003The plaintiff undertook to give notice in writing to the defendant if any of the events described at [18(a)] above occurred.', '(c)\\u2003If the plaintiff gave such notice, the defendant had the right to terminate the agreement within 14 days of receiving the notice. If that happened, the plaintiff would be obliged to repay to the defendant all of its progress payments. 15', '(d)\\u2003If the plaintiff gave such notice but the defendant did not exercise the right to terminate the agreement, the defendant was obliged to accept Unit 1 constructed by the plaintiff as it saw fit, whether with or without the two changes. 16', '19\\u2003The defendant accepted the conditions set out in the December 2012 Letter on 10 December 2012. 17', 'The plaintiff thereby undertook a critical obligation to the defendant and conferred on the defendant a critical right with respect to Unit 1. The plaintiff undertook an unqualified obligation to give notice to the defendant if the authorities were to impose any terms for approving the two changes which terms the plaintiff decided to accept. The plaintiff conferred upon the defendant an unqualified right to terminate the contract upon receiving such notice.', '20\\u2003In late December 2012, the defendant entered into two sale and purchase agreements with the plaintiff, one for each Unit. The agreements were both in Form D and were identical in all material respects save, of course, for the quantum of the purchase consideration and the description of the Units.', '21\\u2003Schedule B of the agreement for Unit 2 read with the definition of \u201cthe Unit\u201d in cl 1.1.1 describes the unit as \u201cThe Restaurant Unit in the Building known or to be known as Oxley Tower \u2026 situated on the 4th storey of the Building\u2026\u201d. 18', 'The agreement for Unit 1, however, recognised that the plaintiff\u2019s agreement to carry out the two changes to Unit 1 was subject to the conditions set out in the December 2012 Letter. Thus, Schedule B of the agreement for Unit 1 continues to describe Unit 1 as: \u201cThe Gymnasium\/Spa Unit in the Building known or to be known as Oxley Tower \u2026 situated on the 4th storey of the Building\u2026\u201d. 19', '22\\u2003Clause 26 of both agreements expressly bars the defendant from using the roof gardens of both Units for any commercial activities. 20', 'This clause was mandated by and reflected a prohibition in the planning permission granted by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (\u201cURA\u201d) for the fourth floor of Oxley Tower.', '23\\u2003Two points are important to note about cl 26. First, this provision is not part of the standard terms prescribed by Form D. Instead, it is a customised term inserted into the second schedule of the agreements. Second, neither the URA\u2019s planning permission nor cl 26 of the agreements prohibits the patrons of the restaurants in either of the Units from having access to the roof gardens otherwise than as part of the commercial activities at the restaurants. The only prohibition is against the defendant conducting or permitting commercial activities in the roof gardens.', '24\\u2003The plaintiff did not, at any time before the parties\u2019 dispute arose, supply a copy of the 2012 FSSD Plans to the defendant, even though these plans were in the plaintiff\u2019s possession from April 2012, even though those plans obliged the plaintiff to construct the fourth floor of Oxley Tower with the softscape areas elevated by 300mm from the hardscape areas and even though the 2012 FSSD Plans were contrary to the 2012 BCA Plans and the depiction of the fourth floor in the brochure. Further, none of the documents which the plaintiff did supply to the defendant, whether before the parties entered into the agreements or on the occasion of entering into those agreements, made any reference to the 2012 FSSD Plans or to the fact that the 2012 BCA Plans were no longer the approved building plans for Oxley Tower.', '25\\u2003The two changes to Unit 1 required amendments to the plans for Oxley Tower. Making the two changes, however, proved to be more difficult for the plaintiff to carry out than simply re-designating Unit 1\u2019s indoor and outdoor areas exactly like Unit 2\u2019s.', '26\\u2003The difficulty arose because of the maximum occupant load (\u201cMOL\u201d) for the fourth floor of Oxley Tower as calculated in accordance with the Singapore Fire Code. The MOL for a given floor of a building is the maximum number of occupants which the Singapore Fire Code deems can be evacuated safely and in a timely manner from that floor in the event of fire. The MOL for a floor is determined by factors which are unrelated to the use of the units on the floor. 21', '27\\u2003The occupant load of a particular floor calculated in accordance with the Singapore Fire Code cannot exceed the MOL for the floor. The occupant load of a floor is calculated by dividing its floor area into a number of sections based on the intended use of each section as indicated on the building plans. The area of each section in square metres is then multiplied by the occupant load factor which the Singapore Fire Code assigns to the intended use for that section. That calculation gives the occupant load for each section. The occupant load for the whole floor is simply the sum of the occupant loads for all of the sections in use on that floor.', '28\\u2003The MOL for the fourth floor of Oxley Tower is 240 persons. The difficulty which the plaintiff faced in making the two changes to Unit 1 is that the Singapore Fire Code allocates to a gym or spa an occupant load factor which is less than one-third that of a restaurant. The plaintiff therefore could not carry out the two changes simply by re-designating Unit 1\u2019s indoor area as a restaurant and its outdoor area as a garden.', '29\\u2003There were two alternatives open to the plaintiff to carry out the two changes. First, the plaintiff could have left the occupant load for Unit 1 unchanged from that of a gym or a spa, ie, less than one-third that of a restaurant. This would have left the fourth floor\u2019s occupant load unchanged, ie, less than or equal to the MOL, but at the cost of impairing Unit 1\u2019s viability as a restaurant. That would also have meant that Unit 1 would arguably no longer be \u201cexactly like\u201d Unit 2 (see [10] above), having a maximum occupancy of less than one-third that of Unit 2. The alternative was to increase the occupant load of Unit 1 by a factor of more than three to that of a restaurant while making corresponding reductions to the occupant load for the remaining sections of the fourth floor to ensure that the MOL was not exceeded.', '30\\u2003The plaintiff chose the second alternative. It reduced the occupant load in other sections of the fourth floor by raising the softscape areas on the whole of the fourth floor and by rendering them inaccessible to human traffic. This allowed the plaintiff to allocate zero occupant load to the enlarged softscape areas and to allocate the occupant load thereby saved to increase the occupant load of Unit 1.', '31\\u2003The plaintiff executed this second alternative by making four changes to the building plans for the fourth floor of Oxley Tower. First, the plaintiff reduced the hardscape areas by about 20%. Second, it increased the softscape areas by about 12%. Third, it elevated the increased softscape areas by 450mm (from 300mm as reflected in the 2012 FSSD Plans) from the hardscape areas and planted them over with trees and shrubs. Fourth, it reduced the occupant load for Unit 2 and allocated that occupant load also to Unit 1. These changes affected the whole of the fourth floor: not only the hardscape and softscape areas of Unit 1 but also of Unit 2. 22', '32\\u2003The plaintiff reflected these four changes in a further set of plans which it submitted to the BCA and the FSSD in 2016 (\u201cthe 2016 Plans\u201d). The BCA and the FSSD duly approved the 2016 Plans. The plaintiff constructed the fourth floor of Oxley Tower in accordance with the 2016 Plans.', '33\\u2003At some point before it committed itself to constructing Oxley Tower in accordance with the 2016 Plans, the plaintiff had the right under the December 2012 Letter either to decline to carry out the two changes which the defendant had requested or to accept the terms imposed by the authorities for carrying out the two changes. In either event, the plaintiff was obliged to serve notice on the defendant either: (a) informing the defendant that the plaintiff had decided not to carry out the changes; or (b) informing the defendant of the terms which the authorities had imposed for making the two changes. That would then have given the defendant 14 days in which to terminate the contract and claim a refund of all progress payments. For whatever reason, the plaintiff did not serve notice on the defendant under the December 2012 Letter. The plaintiff instead decided unilaterally to carry out the two changes and to accept the terms imposed by the authorities for doing so.', '34\\u2003The plaintiff delivered vacant possession of the Units to the defendant under the agreements in December 2016. The defendant was dissatisfied with both Unit 1 and Unit 2. Amongst other things, the softscape areas for the entire fourth floor had been rendered completely inaccessible to human traffic. The defendant claimed to be entitled to exercise a contractual right under cl 15.4 of the agreements to terminate the agreements and to seek a refund from the plaintiff. 23', 'The plaintiff rejected the defendant\u2019s claim.', '35\\u2003The defendant therefore commenced the arbitration under the agreements.', '36\\u2003Clause 15.4 of Form D governs the defendant\u2019s right to terminate the agreements and to secure a refund. A purchaser\u2019s right to terminate an agreement in Form D arises under cl 15.4 only if a comparison of \u201cthe final approved building plans\u201d to \u201cthe plans and specifications approved by the Purchaser at the date of this Agreement\u201d show that they \u201cdiffer substantially\u201d. If this condition is satisfied, the purchaser is entitled to terminate the agreement and the vendor is obliged to \u201crefund all moneys paid by the Purchaser with interest\u201d. If the condition is not satisfied, the purchaser is obliged to complete. The five questions on appeal turn on the interpretation, within the meaning of cl 15.4, of these three critical phrases which I have put in quotation marks in the preceding sentences.', '37\\u2003I now set cl 15.4 out in full, with the three critical phrases in italics: 24', '38\\u2003There is no dispute that the 2016 Plans are the \u201cfinal approved building plans\u201d within the meaning of cl 15.4. There is also no dispute that the four changes which the plaintiff made in the 2016 Plans (see [31] above) amount to differences from the 2012 BCA Plans within the meaning of cl 15.4.', '39\\u2003The defendant succeeded in persuading the arbitrator on all of the remaining points relating to the three critical phrases. The arbitrator held as follows. First, \u201cthe plans and specifications\u201d in cl 15.4 were the 2012 BCA Plans, subject only to the two changes which the defendant requested, and thus did not include the 2016 Plans or the 2012 FSSD Plans. 25', 'Second, the four changes (see [31] above) between the 2012 BCA Plans and the 2016 Plans meant that the 2016 Plans did \u201cdiffer substantially\u201d from the 2012 BCA Plans subject to the two changes. 26', 'The condition in clause 15.4 was therefore satisfied. The defendant was accordingly entitled to terminate the agreements. 27', 'Finally, the plaintiff\u2019s obligation to \u201crefund all moneys\u201d to the defendant under cl 15.4 encompassed not only money which the defendant had paid to the plaintiff by reason of the terminated agreements but also the money which the defendant had paid to third parties by reason of the agreements. 28'"}
{"casename":"2020_SGHC_236","fact":"The facts fit directly under \ns 33(1)(a) as well as s 33(1)(c).\n9. The question remains whether Dr Wee\u2019s arrangement with ACOC is \nexempted from s 33(1) by virtue of s 33(3)(b), a provision that is straightforward \nand clear. But because it is expressed in wide terms, intending to be applicable \nin varied circumstances, applicants can latch on to those terms as their escape \nroute.\n10. In this case, for example, Dr Wee argues that SPL was a legitimate \nbusiness concern and established for the bona fide commercial reason of \noperating a dental clinic. If that was all, I would not hesitate to agree that \ns 33(3)(b) does not apply here. But there is a second condition to s 33(3)(b) and \nthat is that the arrangement must not have \u201cas one of its main purposes the \navoidance of tax\u201d.\n11. It may be argued that one of the purposes of the arrangement was to \nseparate the personal liability of Dr Wee from that of the clinic\u2019s; but this was \nby no means its only purpose. It is clear to me that one of the main purposes of \nthe arrangement was to allow Dr Wee to receive the same income he used to \nreceive from ACOC but now, through the arrangement, reduce his tax liability. \nHe claims that SPL was intended for general practice but in truth, the only \npatients he had throughout the material tax period were ACOC\u2019s patients. The \nVersion No 2: 18 Jan 2021 (10:02 hrs)\nWee Teng Yau v Comptroller of Income Tax[2020] SGHC 236\n5inescapable conclusion on these facts is that the purpose of this arrangement \nwas to reduce Dr Wee\u2019s personal tax.\n12. Dr Wee left the employ of ACOC exactly on the day SPL was \nincorporated. The terms of his termination were not recorded in writing nor were \nthe terms of his continued service to ACOC. He claims that this was because \nthe owner of ACOC was a traditional businessman and did not want contracts \nin writing. That is unfortunate for Dr Wee.\n13. Sections 33(1) and 33(3) are not complicated statutory provisions. The \nlanguage is simple and unambiguous, but those provisions are intended to have \na long and wide reach. Consequently, difficulties arise mainly in applying them \nto the given facts of each case. And so sometimes courts invent steps to help \nthem understand how the arrangement works in the peculiar facts of those cases. \nIn so doing, additional words like \u201creasonableness\u201d and \u201ctwo-step test\u201d or \n\u201cthree-step test\u201d often find their way into judgments. But they need not be \nconstrued as creating new elements not found in the statutory provisions, or \nadding requirements not intended by Parliament. They are often just guides to \nthe proper application of the law to the facts.\n14. Mr Lau argues that the ITBR erred in law in finding that the \n\u201creasonableness\u201d of the taxpayer\u2019s acts had to be considered under s 33(1) even \nthough this was not an element specified in the provision. That is true, \n\u201creasonableness\u201d is not mentioned in s 33(1), but when lawyers and judges \napply the law, they are invariably guided by the unseen hand of reason.

Under s 13 of the MRA, such registration would, in conjunction with a valid practising certificate, allow him to practise as a house officer and obtain the certificate of experience needed to apply for either full or conditional registration under the MRA. As a result of a complaint made by a patient against Dr Chua, which formed the basis of one of the charges Dr Chua faced before the DT and which we elaborate on below, he was temporarily suspended from clinical duties on 20 May 2016. This meant that Dr Chua was unable to complete his housemanship within the usual period of one year, and it necessitated the extension of his provisional registration on 5 August 2016 by four months. Dr Chua eventually completed his housemanship in December 2016 and obtained a certificate of experience.', '5\\u2003During the course of Dr Chua\u2019s housemanship, a formal complaint was filed against him with the Chairman of the SMC\u2019s Complaints Panel on 25 May 2016, by the Training and Assessment Standards Committee of the Ministry of Health (\u201cthe MOH\u201d), alleging a number of instances of professional misconduct. A Complaints Committee was subsequently appointed to inquire into the complaint. The Complaints Committee directed that an investigation be conducted by the MOH\u2019s Investigation Unit. Dr Chua was invited to furnish a written explanation in response to the complaint, which he did on 5 December 2016. The Complaints Committee eventually determined that a formal inquiry by a DT was warranted and conveyed its decision to Dr Chua by a letter dated 31 August 2017. This was followed more than a year later by a Notice of Inquiry dated 26 February 2019 setting out a total of six charges under s 53(1)(d) of the MRA.', '6\\u2003The charges against Dr Chua set out in the Notice of Inquiry fall into two broad categories. The first, which consists of the 1st charge, concerns a breach of medical confidentiality (\u201cthe confidentiality charge\u201d) by violating guideline 4.2.3.1 of SMC\u2019s Ethical Code and Ethical Guidelines (2002 Edition) (\u201cthe ECEG\u201d), which states:', '7\\u2003The confidentiality charge stems from the patient complaint we have alluded to at [4] above, and it concerns an incident which occurred on or around 27 April 2016 when Dr Chua was posted to the general surgery team at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital and was one of the doctors who examined and treated a patient, and handled the patient\u2019s discharge. Following his discharge, the patient returned for a number of physiotherapy sessions. The patient approached Dr Chua as he was unhappy with the length of medical leave he had been issued. It appears that after a phone conversation with the patient, Dr Chua issued an extended medical certificate without meeting the patient or conducting any assessment. Dr Chua was subsequently approached by the patient\u2019s employer to clarify the condition of the patient who had refused to resume work and had made a claim for loss of income on the basis of the medical certificate issued by Dr Chua. Without the patient\u2019s consent, Dr Chua prepared and issued to the patient\u2019s employer a letter on the hospital\u2019s letterhead informing the employer of the patient\u2019s medical condition, diagnosis and treatment, as well as other information that had been conveyed by the patient in the course of the consultations.', '8\\u2003The second category of charges, which consists of the 2nd to 6th charges (which we refer to collectively as \u201cthe false information charges\u201d), concerns the provision of inaccurate or misleading information in breach of guidelines 4.4.2 and 4.4.3.1 of the ECEG, which read as follows:', '9\\u2003The 2nd charge relates to a breach of guideline 4.4.2 read with guideline 4.4.3.1 of the ECEG in a research letter, which is a form of correspondence used for publishing preliminary research or short summaries of primary research, submitted by Dr Chua on or about 16 August 2015 to the British Journal of Dermatology (\u201cthe BJD\u201d). There, he presented himself in the author biography as \u201cChua Shunjie, BEng, MD, National Skin Centre, Singapore\u201d [emphasis added]. This gave the impression that Dr Chua was affiliated with the National Skin Centre (\u201cNSC\u201d) or that the study was somehow affiliated with the NSC, both of which were inaccurate and misleading. Dr Chua did not hold any official appointment or role in the NSC and the contents of the research letter did not involve either patients or doctors at the NSC.', '10\\u2003The 3rd and 4th charges relate to breaches of guideline 4.4.2 read with guideline 4.4.3.1 of the ECEG and concern a pair of letters Dr Chua sent to two academic publications. The 3rd charge concerns a clinical letter, which is a form of correspondence used to describe patient cases of novel and extraordinary significance, submitted in August or September 2015 to the Journal der Deutschen Dermatologischen Gesellschaft (\u201cthe JDDG\u201d) and published in March 2016, in which Dr Chua claimed that his co-authors included one \u201cMark Pitts\u201d. The 4th charge concerns a letter submitted in September 2015 to the Obstetrics & Gynecology Journal (\u201cthe OGJ\u201d) and published in January 2016 responding to a previously published article, and in which Dr Chua claimed that his co-authors included \u201cMark Pitts\u201d and \u201cPeter Lemark\u201d. These were both inaccurate and misleading because there were no such co-authors.', '11\\u2003The 5th and 6th charges relate to a breach of guideline 4.4.2 of the ECEG and concern a pair of applications that Dr Chua made to the Centralised Institutional Review Board (\u201cCIRB\u201d) on or about 1 July 2015 and 28 October 2015 respectively, seeking approval to conduct two studies. In these, Dr Chua claimed that he was a member of the Singapore General Hospital\u2019s (\u201cSGH\u2019s\u201d) Dermatology Department. These claims were inaccurate and misleading because at the time of the applications, Dr Chua was not in any way involved with SGH\u2019s Dermatology Department.', '12\\u2003At the inquiry before the DT, which took place over three days in June and November 2019, Dr Chua initially raised a preliminary objection against the DT\u2019s jurisdiction. In summary, Dr Chua argued that under s 53(1) read with s 53(2) of the MRA, a DT\u2019s powers could only be exercised in respect of a registered medical practitioner as defined by the MRA (\u201cRMP\u201d). Dr Chua submitted that he had ceased to be a RMP upon the expiration of his provisional registration in December 2016. As against this, the SMC appears to have originally taken the position that the DT would have jurisdiction over Dr Chua so long as he had been a RMP at the time of the conduct forming the subject matter of the charges against him. The SMC later clarified that its position was that Dr Chua remained a RMP even after the expiry of his provisional registration because his name was still on its electronic register.', '13\\u2003The DT agreed with the SMC\u2019s submissions and held, adopting a purposive interpretation of the MRA, that it sufficed that the misconduct occurred whilst the doctor in question was a RMP. Since there was no dispute that Dr Chua was a RMP at the material time, the DT found it had jurisdiction to determine the matter.', '14\\u2003Following this, Dr Chua elected to plead guilty to four of the six charges (namely, the 1st, 2nd, 5th and 6th charges) (\u201cthe proceeded charges\u201d) with their particulars set out in the Notice of Inquiry, and admitted to the SOF without qualification. Dr Chua also consented to having the 3rd and 4th charges taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing (\u201cthe TIC charges\u201d).', '15\\u2003The DT accepted Dr Chua\u2019s plea of guilt and the only remaining issue was the question of sentence. On this, the three-member DT arrived at a split decision. The majority disagreed with the position of the SMC and concluded that Dr Chua\u2019s misconduct did not warrant a striking off order. The majority decided instead to impose a suspension for a period of 18 months. The minority, on the other hand, considered that a striking off order was called for.', '16\\u2003The majority sought to apply the sentencing framework set out in Wong Meng Hang ([3] supra). It noted that cases where striking off orders had been made involved conduct at the \u201cextreme spectrum of the culpability and harm matrix, with medical negligence as a predominant factor\u201d, and that \u201c[d]ishonesty [had] also played a major part in these cases\u201d. Dealing first with the confidentiality charge, the majority considered that Dr Chua\u2019s breach of patient confidentiality was not serious because he had seen the patient before, and that a striking off order would only be appropriate in cases involving recalcitrant offenders. As for the false information charges, these did not concern misconduct within the professional realm, in the sense that that they did not pertain to the care of patients, and did not bring disrepute to the medical profession. Rather, they concerned research integrity issues that were unrelated to medical practice. The majority also took into account the fact that, with the exception of 3rd and 4th charges where the letters with fictitious co-authors were published by the JDDG and OGJ, the remaining charges did not involve the inaccurate affiliations claimed by Dr Chua being put into the public domain. Further, no harm had been caused to patients.', '17\\u2003Separately, the majority thought it relevant that Duke-NUS, having investigated and found Dr Chua\u2019s research work dating back to his time as a student to be generally sound and well-supervised, had not seen fit to revoke his degree, and that he would have been eligible to practise had the charges not been brought against him. The majority also took into consideration a number of factors which it regarded as mitigating: (a) Dr Chua was a young medical graduate and committed the breaches as a result of his excessive enthusiasm to gain entry into the NSC\u2019s Seamless Dermatology Training Programme; (b) he had been divorced and lost the support of his family as a result of the disciplinary proceedings; (c) he was not gainfully employed and would have to repay MOH if he failed to fulfil his bond; and (d) he had apologised and expressed deep remorse in his letter of explanation to the SMC. In all the circumstances, the majority considered that the appropriate sentence would be a suspension for a term of 36 months, but then reduced this to a term of 18 months on account of the fact that Dr Chua had already been unable to practise during the three year period when the disciplinary proceedings were ongoing and had endured considerable stress on this account. Dr Chua was also ordered to: (a) give an undertaking to the SMC that he would not engage in similar conduct; (b) take steps to rectify the errors made including by writing to the publications and institutions concerned; and (c) pay the costs and expenses of the SMC.', '18\\u2003The minority, on the other hand, agreed that each incident on its own might not have warranted a striking off order, but thought that the entirety of Dr Chua\u2019s conduct, particularly the numerous false statements made by him, could not be dismissed as \u201cmisguided assumptions\u201d or as being confined to issues of research integrity. Rather, these demonstrated a pattern of dishonesty and a troubling lack of integrity. The minority noted in relation to the TIC charges, that even after investigations had commenced, Dr Chua had not acted honestly in his responses to the Complaints Committee and had attempted to convince it that he had tried his best to contact the co-authors. This, however, was entirely fictitious because there were no such co-authors. Applying the analytical framework set out in Wong Meng Hang, the minority concluded that the dishonesty manifested by Dr Chua had the potential to undermine the standing and reputation of the medical profession as a whole. These were not one-off aberrations, but reflected a persistent course of behaviour. Furthermore, when the articles containing the false statements of affiliation were written, Dr Chua was in the process of seeking admission to NSC\u2019s Seamless Dermatology Training Programme and his actions, seen in this light, were clearly motivated by his desire to secure a personal benefit in terms of gaining admission to this prestigious programme.', '19\\u2003The minority also considered that since Dr Chua had committed serious breaches of the medical profession\u2019s ethical rules, his personal mitigating circumstances should not be accorded any weight. The evidence against him was overwhelming and he had obfuscated in his response to the Complaints Committee instead of admitting to the charges at the earliest opportunity. Dr Chua had also mounted an unmeritorious preliminary objection to the DT\u2019s jurisdiction and failed to take steps to retract the articles with misleading information. These were inconsistent with his claims of deep remorse over his actions. In the circumstances, the minority concluded that the appropriate sanction was a striking off order.'"}

Before the Disciplinary Tribunal (\u201cDT\u201d), Dr Foo faced three charges, which included a charge of failing to keep clear and accurate medical records (\u201cthe charge\u201d). Dr Foo pleaded guilty to the charge and the DT imposed a term of three months\u2019 suspension in that respect. It is that charge alone which forms the sole subject matter of the present appeal.', '2\\u2003 We begin with a brief outline of the salient facts. The patient first consulted Dr Foo on 18 January 2012 at Parkway East Hospital. She was referred to Dr Foo by one Dr Roger Heng. Dr Foo diagnosed the patient with rectal cancer and discussed various treatment options with her. These were documented in a clinical case note, along with, among other things, Dr Foo\u2019s physical findings and the results of the various tests conducted on the patient.', '3\\u2003It is not disputed that during this initial consultation, Dr Foo did explain the material risks and possible complications of the treatment options to the patient. However, he was unable to obtain the patient\u2019s consent at that time as she had expressed financial concerns regarding immediate admission to Parkway East Hospital. He advised her to seek urgent admission to a restructured hospital instead.', '4\\u2003On 24 January 2012, the patient contacted Dr Foo again to seek treatment under him. Dr Foo was overseas at the time and therefore advised the patient to contact Dr Heng. On the following day, Dr Heng conducted various tests on the patient. On 26 January 2012, he documented her written consent for two procedures to be carried out by Dr Foo and himself, namely, a \u201cTotal Hysterectomy and Anterior Resection\u201d. The two procedures are more fully described as a Total Abdominal Hysterectomy with Bilateral Salpingo-oophorectomy and a Lower Anterior Resection (\u201cLAR\u201d) but it does not seem to us that anything turns on the slight difference in the terms in which it was described in the relevant forms.', '5\\u2003The procedures were performed on 31 January 2012. Subsequently, the patient developed complications and passed away on 4 February 2012.'"}

The victim knew him as her stepfather. The family lived in a one-room flat where a screen was set up to partition a \u201croom\u201d from the main living area. The victim and her brother slept in the room while their mother and the appellant usually slept in the living area. At the material time, the victim was 12 years old.', '5\\u2003The charge in question concerned an incident in the early hours of 28 August 2019. The victim testified that at some time between 3.00am and 4.00am, she was woken up by the appellant calling her name. Her brother was asleep in the room with her. The appellant was also in the room and told her that her mother had left the house. This was evidently untrue. The victim went back to sleep but then felt the appellant\u2019s hand under her bra on her left breast for about a minute, applying a significant amount of force. The victim testified that the appellant pulled her hair and brought her face close to his groin three or four times, but she did not see if his private parts were exposed as she had turned away. She did not shout for help because she was afraid and did not think anyone would or could help her. Ten minutes after he had pulled her hair, the appellant slapped her twice. During those ten minutes, she tried to avoid the appellant\u2019s overtures and to move to her brother\u2019s bed. As a result, she did not see precisely what the appellant was doing in that time. The victim used a bolster, pillow and jacket to try to cover herself, and eventually managed to move to her brother\u2019s bed. The appellant continued trying to touch her but stopped when her brother woke up briefly. The victim stayed in bed until about 5.00am, when her mother came into the room and the appellant left.', '6\\u2003The victim went to school that day and told her school counsellor that her father had touched her and she felt dirty.

{"casename":"2020_SGHC_242","fact":"'4\\u2003Goodwood is a Singapore-incorporated company involved in the wholesale of petrochemical products. Mr Lee is its sole director and shareholder. 1', 'He is also a director of New Silkroutes Group Limited, formerly known as Digiland International Limited (\u201cDigiland\u201d), 2', 'a publicly listed company in which Goodwood has a substantial shareholding (ranging from 6.85% to 14.83% from sometime between 2015 and 2017). 3', '5\\u2003Mr Lim was the Head of the Oil Trading Division of International Energy Group Pte Ltd (\u201cIEG\u201d), a wholly owned subsidiary of Digiland and its oil and gas trading arm. 4', 'He was responsible for cultivating and maintaining relationships with trading counter-parties, negotiating spot and term contracts, and ensuring the successful execution of IEG\u2019s trades. 5', '6\\u2003As for SPPL and SPSPL, they are Singapore-incorporated companies which are part of a group of companies headquartered in the People\u2019s Republic of China.

This is Goodwood\u2019s account given by Mr Lee. 8', '8\\u2003Sometime after Goodwood was incorporated in August 2014, Mr Lee directed its Senior Operations Manager, Mr Lim Yew Piow (\u201cMr Lim Y P\u201d), to register as a trading counter-party with SPPL to facilitate future trading between the two companies. 9', '9\\u2003Then, sometime in March 2015, Mr Lim informed the management of Digiland and IEG that SPPL wanted to purchase fuel oil from BMS United Bunkers (Asia) Pte Ltd (\u201cBMS\u201d), another oil trading company, but was unable to do so because SPPL did not have a trading credit limit with BMS. 10', 'Mr Lim suggested that Digiland and IEG get involved as intermediaries to purchase fuel oil from BMS, as Digiland was a publicly-listed company and was therefore able to secure a trading credit limit with BMS. Digiland could transfer its trading credit limit to IEG after securing it with BMS. 11', 'However, Digiland realised that the trading credit limit of US$5m extended by IEG and Digiland to SPPL had been exhausted by previous trades. Therefore, it was proposed that Goodwood would be involved as another intermediary. Goodwood\u2019s role would be to purchase fuel oil from IEG\/Digiland (which in turn would buy the fuel oil from BMS), and sell it on to SPPL, in exchange for a fee. 12', '10\\u2003Due to the credit risks involved, Goodwood required a corporate guarantee from SPPL\u2019s parent company, Southernpec Corporation, before it would agree to act as an intermediary. 13', 'This, according to Mr Wu, was a \u201ccustomary\u201d practice to \u201csupport actual purchases\u201d (emphasis added). 14', 'Thereafter, Southernpec Corporation and SPSPL each executed a guarantee of US$5m in favour of Goodwood (the latter of which is the SPSPL Guarantee dated 1 June 2015).', '11\\u2003With the guarantees in place, Goodwood entered into two transactions to buy 1,500 MT and 1,700 MT of fuel oil from BMS through IEG to sell the same to SPPL on 10 June 2015 (the \u201cJune Contracts\u201d), followed by the two transactions to buy 2,000 MT and 1,200 MT of fuel oil from BMS through Digiland to sell the same to SPPL on 2 July 2015 (as documented by the July Contracts). The key terms of the July Contracts are set out at [38] below.', '12\\u2003In these transactions, Mr Lim Y P represented Goodwood, and dealt with Mr Wu of SPPL. Mr Lim represented IEG, and Mr Lim Koon Hock (\u201cMr Lim K H\u201d), the former chief financial officer of Digiland, represented Digiland. 15', 'Mr Lim was not an employee of Goodwood; nor was he an agent of Goodwood. 16', '13\\u2003Thus, Goodwood played a limited role as an intermediary or \u201ccredit sleeve\u201d to facilitate the sales of fuel oil between BMS and SPPL for a margin of US$3 per MT. Goodwood only knew of the involvement of BMS, IEG (for the June Contracts) and Digiland (for the July Contracts as Goodwood\u2019s procurement agent), Goodwood itself, and SPPL. Mr Lee did not know the reason for SPPL entering into the deals or what it would be using the fuel oil for. Such credit sleeving transactions are routine in the industry. 17', '14\\u2003In accordance with the July Contracts, Goodwood duly performed its obligations to SPPL. This is based on inter-tank transfers supported by inter-tank transfer certificates (the \u201cITT certificates\u201d) and cargo release notices (the \u201cCRNs\u201d) issued by SPSPL (which I shall describe in more detail at [19]-[20] below).', '15\\u2003According to Mr Wu, however, in May 2015, Mr Lim spoke to him about the possibility of doing fictitious \u201cpaper\u201d deals in fuel oil, purportedly to help improve Goodwood\u2019s revenue figures. Mr Wu brought the matter up to Mr Xu, who agreed to do so. 18', 'This was because Mr Xu and Mr Wu had enjoyed a good working relationship with Mr Lee, Mr Lim and Dr Goh Jin Han (\u201cDr Goh\u201d), the director and chief executive officer of Digiland, when the latter three were involved with another oil trading company IAG-Pacific Petroleum Pte Ltd. 19', '16\\u2003To that end, Mr Lim came up with a scheme involving a circular series of fictitious trades (the \u201cScheme\u201d) with BMS on board. 20', 'In particular, Mr Lim introduced Mr Mohammad Arif bin Abdol Rahman (\u201cMr Arif\u201d), a BMS bunker oil trader, who, according to Mr Wu, would \u201chandle day-to-day running of the Scheme for BMS\u201d with the blessing of his superior, Mr George Markos Kounalakis (\u201cMr Kounalakis\u201d), the managing director of BMS. 21', '17\\u2003As Mr Wu understood it, the Scheme was intended to comprise a circular chain of \u201cback-to-back sales\u201d of non-existent \u201cfuel oil\u201d from one entity in the chain to another lower down the chain. To start the chain, BMS would provide actual funds to Universal Alliance Limited (\u201cUA\u201d), another oil trading company, which would then use the funds to make payment to the next fictitious \u201csub-seller\u201d above it in the chain for an ostensible purchase of fictitious fuel oil, until the funds found their way back to BMS. 22', '18\\u2003Pursuant to the Scheme, two series of transactions were structured in June 2015 for 1,500 MT and 1,700 MT of fuel oil (the \u201cJune Arrangements\u201d) as described graphically below.', '', '', '19\\u2003These transactions were supported by ITT certificates which on their face confirmed that the fuel oil transacted had been physically transferred from one ship tank to another aboard the same fuel-storage vessel. As the fuel oil transacted was stored aboard a vessel, the MT Marine Star, which was owned and operated by SPSPL, the ITT certificates were issued by SPSPL. Another supporting document was a CRN for each transaction on SPPL\u2019s letterhead which represented that the volume of fuel oil traded was being held in SPPL\u2019s lawful possession. The various transactions in the June Arrangement were duly executed and performed without any issues, including the June Contracts between Goodwood and SPPL. 23', '20\\u2003The parties then entered into another two series of transactions in July 2015 for 2,000 MT and 1,200 MT of fuel oil (the \u201cJuly Arrangements\u201d) as described graphically below. Similar to the June Arrangements, these transactions were supported by ITT certificates and CRNs in the same form as those described in the preceding paragraph, save that the vessel in question was MT Star Bright. Another counterparty, Taigu (Singapore) Energy Pte Ltd (\u201cTaigu\u201d), was also involved.', '', '21\\u2003In relation to the July Contracts, it is Southernpec\u2019s position that at all material times, Goodwood and Mr Lee well knew that while ostensibly purporting to be agreements for the sale and purchase of fuel oil, these were in fact fa\u00e7ades. Mr Lim, who orchestrated the Scheme including the use of fictitious documents, was an employee of Goodwood, or an agent of Goodwood and Mr Lee. Indeed, all the parties knew of the details of the June and July Arrangements. 24', 'All the transactions were done pursuant to the Scheme for the transmission of money once received (with BMS providing the cash upfront to UA to fund the chain of transactions for some unknown benefit) so as to artificially improve the reported financial performance of Goodwood. 25', 'There was no trading in fuel oil at all. Indeed, the fuel oil was \u201cnon-existent\u201d. 26', 'Therefore, the July Contracts were not enforceable.', '22\\u2003According to Mr Lim, he introduced Mr Wu to Goodwood, BMS and UA. In turn, Mr Wu introduced Taigu to UA. Represented by their own employees, the parties then separately entered into the trades on their own accord in relation to the fuel oil on board vessels owned and operated by SPSPL. 27', 'Mr Lim was merely the introducer; he was not an employee of or agent for Goodwood or Mr Lee. 28', 'Admittedly, there was circularity to the June and July Arrangements (as set out in the diagrams above). However, these were not fictitious transactions. The transactions were credit sleeving trades of fuel oil owned by SPPL (for which title to the fuel oil passed without any physical delivery of the goods). 29', '23\\u2003From the documents produced at the trial, it would appear, as Southernpec contends and Mr Lim admits, that the June and July Contracts formed part of the June and July Arrangements. I pause to make three observations on the structure of the arrangements. First, the arrangements involved real, and not merely apparent, profits for each party (except UA) in the chain. Second, UA obtained the benefit of immediate cash from BMS, but needed to pay a substantial premium to SSPL\/Taigu within 26\u201327 days. While it is not entirely clear what UA\u2019s commercial reasons for entering into the transactions were, this is not relevant to the issues at hand. Third, the fuel oil in question (if in existence) originated with SPPL and remained with SPPL.', '24\\u2003In any event, in relation to the July Arrangements, UA defaulted on its payment to Taigu, which in turn did not pay SPPL. 30', 'This led to SPPL\u2019s default on its payment obligations to Goodwood under the July Contracts. Nonetheless, Southernpec asserts that the July Contracts are not enforceable. Goodwood, however, completely disavows knowledge of the July Arrangements (and no knowledge of the Scheme). In fact, BMS was duly paid by Digiland (on behalf of Goodwood as its procurement agent) on 27 August 2015. 31', 'Having set out the essence of the dispute, I turn to the parties\u2019 cases.'"}

The Property is a two-storey shophouse. 9', 'The title search on the Property shows that the Defendant is registered as a tenant in common for one half-share in the Property, and also as the owner of the other half-share on trust in his capacity as executor of the Estate. 10', 'The dispute only concerns the former half-share which appears, on the register, to be owned by the Defendant.', '9\\u2003On 2 May 1967, the Property had been conveyed by one Loo Ting Soo to one Jiwan Singh (\u201cMr Jiwan\u201d) and the Testator as tenants in common in equal shares, for the total purchase price of $30,000.00. 11', 'On 10 July 1984, Mr Jiwan conveyed his half-share in the Property to the Defendant for a consideration of $50,000.00. This sum of $50,000.00 was fully funded by the Testator. 12', 'On the same day, the Defendant executed a power of attorney (\u201cthe Power of Attorney\u201d), which appointed the Testator as his attorney in matters relating to the Property. The scope and significance of the Power of Attorney are subjects of dispute in this case.', '10\\u2003It is not disputed that after the purchase of Mr Jiwan\u2019s share in the Property, the Testator, his wife, and the Defendant, together with the Defendant\u2019s family, moved into the Property. The Testator also employed part of the Property to derive income from rental or license fees. This income (\u201cthe Income\u201d) consisted of monies paid by persons who either operated businesses in the shop premises in the Property or stayed in the various rooms of the Property. The facts surrounding how the Testator dealt with the Income of the Property during his lifetime are disputed. After the Testator passed away, the Defendant continued to stay there with his family, and also rented out part of the Property for income. 13', 'In December 1996, the Plaintiff returned to Singapore from India, where he had been living since 1968 after completing his primary education here, and where the parties\u2019 three sisters were also living. Upon his return, the Plaintiff moved into one room in the Property. 14'"}
{"casename":"2020_SGHC_244","fact":"'4\\u2003Given the considerable overlap between the present application and the prior proceedings, the detailed background can be found in my grounds of decision in OS 1339\/2019, Jethanand Harkishindas Bhojwani v Lakshmi Prataprai Bhojwani (alias Mrs Lakshmi Jethanand Bhojwani) [2020] SGHC 216 (\u201cJethanand\u201d). I summarise the main points briefly.', '5\\u2003The underlying dispute arose from the last will and testament (\u201cthe Will\u201d) of the late Harkishindas Ghumanmal Bhojwani (\u201cthe Testator\u201d). The Husband is one of the Testator\u2019s three sons: Jethanand at [4].', '6\\u2003The three Companies are all incorporated in Singapore. They are Shankar\u2019s Emporium Pte Ltd (\u201cSE\u201d), Malaya Silk Store Pte Ltd (\u201cMSS\u201d), and Liberty Merchandising Company Pte Ltd (\u201cLMC\u201d). The Husband is a director of all three Companies. Various family members related to the Testator and the Husband are involved in the management of the Companies. The Companies\u2019 involvement in the dispute between the Husband and the Wife arose from the fact that various shares in the Companies (\u201cthe Shares\u201d) are part of the subject matter of a trust established by the Testator\u2019s Will, for which the Husband is a trustee and the Wife (previously) one of the beneficiaries.', '7\\u2003The Testator\u2019s Will established five discretionary trusts: Jethanand at [6]. The relevant trust in this case was established by cl 5 of the Will. The property in this trust (\u201cthe Clause 5 Trust\u201d) was defined by cl 5.1(iv) of the Will to include, inter alia, the Shares in the Companies, as follows: 1', '(a)\\u20039,000 shares in MSS;', '(b)\\u2003150,000 shares and one founder\u2019s share (and any conversion therefrom to shares of any other class) in SE; and', '(c)\\u2003one share in LMC.', '8\\u2003The Husband is the trustee of the Clause 5 Trust. The Will defined the beneficiaries of the trust as, inter alia, the Wife and their three sons: Jethanand ([4] supra) at [7]. The exact nature of the Clause 5 Trust is not at issue in the present case, and it is sufficient to note that the Husband was given a discretionary power of appointment.', '9\\u2003The Testator passed away on 4 March 2007 and on 1 August 2008, the Shares were transferred to the Husband: Jethanand at [10]. As such, from that date onwards, the Husband held the Shares in the Companies as a trustee for the Clause 5 Trust.', '10\\u2003Over the course of several actions, the courts have addressed the issue of the Husband\u2019s obligation to account for the trust property to the Wife.', '11\\u2003The Wife commenced OS 1407\/2017 seeking an account of the trust property from the Husband. On 21 November 2018, the High Court granted the Wife\u2019s application on the following terms as recorded in ORC 50\/2019 (later amended in HC\/SUM 1941\/2019):', '12\\u2003The annexed document, P1, provided a list of documents which the Husband was to disclose to the Wife. The present proceedings concern three categories of documents in that list, at S\/Ns 5, 7, and 8, which I have referred to as the \u201cCorporate Documents\u201d. I reproduce the relevant parts of P1 as follows:', '13\\u2003The Husband appealed against the decision. On 17 September 2019, the Court of Appeal heard the appeal in CA\/CA 231\/2018 (\u201cCA 231\/2018\u201d) and dismissed it. As part of the appeal, the Court of Appeal considered the range of documents in P1 and affirmed the High Court\u2019s orders on the documents to be provided: Jethanand ([4] supra) at [16].', '14\\u2003The Companies had previously made an application in HC\/SUM 3013\/2019 (\u201cSUM 3013\/2019\u201d) on 17 June 2019 for leave to intervene in OS 1407\/2017. This application was filed after ORC 50\/2019 but before the appeal in CA 231\/2018 was heard. The relevant prayers in SUM 3013\/2019 were as follows:', '15\\u2003In view of the fact that the appeal was pending, the High Court adjourned SUM 3013\/2019 to a date to be fixed after the appeal, since SUM 3013\/2019 would have been rendered otiose if the appeal had been allowed: Jethanand at [84]. After the appeal was determined on 17 September 2019, the Companies wrote to court on 4 March 2020 for a hearing date to be fixed for SUM 3013\/2019. 2', 'However, before a hearing date could be fixed, the Companies wrote in on 18 March 2020 to indicate that they would be seeking leave to withdraw SUM 3013\/2019. 3', 'In the meantime, as noted below, the Companies commenced OS 365\/2020. Leave to withdraw and the relevant costs orders were granted on 9 April 2020.', '16\\u2003After CA 231\/2018, the Husband executed a number of deeds purporting to exclude the Wife from any future interest in the Clause 5 Trust, by way of his discretionary power of appointment. The application in OS 1339\/2019 was concerned primarily with the effect of these deeds. In Jethanand, I held that the deeds executed on 10 January 2020 were sufficient to exclude the Wife\u2019s interest as a beneficiary from that date onwards. This meant that her entitlement to an account from the Husband had ceased by 10 January 2020: Jethanand at [78].', '17\\u2003While the focus of OS 1339\/2019 was on the effect of those deeds, the Husband had also raised the issue of the scope of the documents to be disclosed, citing issues relating to the Companies. He argued that the scope of the documents should be varied to account for those issues. In that case, I held that issue estoppel prevented the Husband from revisiting the scope of the documents on the basis of the alleged objections by the Companies: Jethanand ([4] supra) at [39]. In any event, I would not have granted the variation sought by the Husband, since the Companies were not before me in OS 1339\/2019 (Jethanand at [84]) and, as between the Husband and the Wife, the Husband\u2019s difficulty, if any, in obtaining the documents did not warrant a variation of the Wife\u2019s entitlement to the account: Jethanand at [86].', '18\\u2003In substance, the Order modified ORC 50\/2019 such that the Husband\u2019s obligation to account was given an endpoint, and reads as follows:', 'The order arising from OS 1339\/2019 is the subject of the application for variation in OS 365\/2020.'"}

S 187\/2014 was a claim by Wellness and Manoj for oppression; it was dismissed (see The Wellness Group Pte Ltd and another v OSIM International Ltd and others and another suit [2016] SGHC 64) and the appeal to the Court of Appeal in Civil Appeal No 64 of 2016 was also dismissed.', '(b)\\u2003Manoj had caused Wellness to distribute dividends to Wellness\u2019 shareholders in excess of the company\u2019s accumulated profit for the year ended 31 March 2011.

{"casename":"2020_SGHC_247","fact":"'3\\u2003EHL was a company listed on the Catalist Board of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited. Its business involved the retail of Apple brand products as well as complementary third-party and proprietary products through its stores in Singapore and Malaysia. Mr Kenneth Lim Tiong Hian (\u201cLim\u201d) was appointed to EHL\u2019s board on 24 June 2016. From 31 July 2016 to 30 July 2019, Lim was its Executive Chairman and Acting Chief Executive Officer (\u201cActing CEO\u201d). At all material times, he was also the sole shareholder of Broadwell Limited (\u201cBroadwell\u201d), a company incorporated and having its registered address in the British Virgin Islands.', '4\\u2003The Plaintiffs are citizens of Spain. They are husband and wife. Sometime in late 2014 or early 2015, they decided to invest in EHL on the recommendation of Mr Michael Lee (\u201cMr Lee\u201d), their relationship manager in United Overseas Bank Limited. They each entered into agreements with Broadwell described as the \u201cSGX Listed Company Financing Agreement\u201d (collectively, \u201cthe Broadwell Agreements\u201d). The Broadwell Agreements were signed by Lim on behalf of Broadwell. However, as I will elaborate below at [7], the Plaintiffs only met Lim on 6 November 2018.', '5\\u2003Under the Broadwell Agreements, the Plaintiffs were to grant loans to Broadwell (\u201cthe Broadwell Loans\u201d) and receive monthly interest at a prescribed rate until the loans matured, whereupon they would become payable. The Broadwell Loans matured in 2017. The Broadwell Agreements provided that the Broadwell Loans were to be used towards \u201cthe investment in the shares, and the funding of the projects\u201d of EHL. The Plaintiffs duly disbursed the loans to Broadwell by telegraphic transfers and cheques on five separate occasions between 15 July 2016 and 15 February 2017. The Plaintiffs received monthly interest payments from Broadwell by cheques up to May 2019.', '6\\u2003When the Broadwell Loans matured, they were offered to the Plaintiffs for renewal on substantially the same terms. The Plaintiffs agreed as the monthly interest payments had been prompt. Consequently, Broadwell issued letters confirming both the maturity and the renewal of the Broadwell Loans (\u201cthe Broadwell Confirmations\u201d). The letters contained the corporate logos of both Broadwell and EHL, and were signed as \u201cKenneth Lim Tiong Hian, Broadwell Limited and Epicentre Holdings Limited\u201d. The Plaintiffs then signed fresh \u201cSGX Listed Company Financing Agreements\u201d with Broadwell on substantially the same terms as the Broadwell Agreements. These agreements were again signed by Lim on behalf of Broadwell. The renewed Broadwell Loans matured in 2019.', '7\\u2003On 6 November 2018, Mr Lee arranged a meeting between the Plaintiffs and Lim at the latter\u2019s office. This was the first meeting between the Plaintiffs and Lim. Lim introduced himself as the CEO of EHL and its subsidiaries and discussed the Broadwell Loans with the Plaintiffs. According to the Plaintiffs, Lim explained that Broadwell was part of EHL\u2019s \u201cstructure\u201d as a vehicle to drive investments in EHL. He also shared information on new investment projects and invited Ms Gemma to invest in them.', '8\\u2003When the renewed Broadwell Loans matured in 2019, they were once again renewed between 15 January 2019 and 15 March 2019. This time, however, there was a significant difference. The renewal confirmations (\u201cthe EHL Confirmations\u201d) this time only bore EHL\u2019s corporate logo. They were signed by Lim as a representative of EHL. By confirming the maturity and renewal of loans originally disbursed under the Broadwell Agreements, the EHL Confirmations purported to roll over and \u201crenew\u201d the Broadwell Loans as debts owed by EHL to the Plaintiffs. For ease of reference, I shall refer to the loans that were purportedly rolled over and renewed on this occasion as \u201cthe EHL Loans\u201d.', '9\\u2003New \u201cSGX Listed Company Financing Agreements\u201d were executed between the Plaintiffs and EHL (\u201cthe EHL Agreements\u201d), not Broadwell, on substantially the same terms as the Broadwell Agreements. The EHL Agreements were signed by Lim \u201c[f]or and on behalf\u201d of EHL. Clause 3 of the EHL Agreements provided for fresh loans to be made by the Plaintiffs to EHL. In particular, it provided that \u201cthe proceeds of the [EHL Loans] shall be disbursed to [EHL] in one lump sum on the date of [the EHL Agreements] and made payable to [EHL] in the form of a cheque or cashier\u2019s order\u201d [emphasis added]. However, notwithstanding the terms of the EHL Agreements, it was common ground that no fresh loans were in fact made. As far as the Plaintiffs were concerned, by the EHL Agreements, the Broadwell Loans were being rolled over and renewed upon maturity in the same way they were in 2017, except that this time, they were rolled over and renewed as loans due from EHL (instead of Broadwell). In other words, EHL assumed Broadwell\u2019s debts without receiving the proceeds of any fresh loans. Clause 8(iv) of the EHL Agreements made this plain by stating that the EHL Loans (previously the Broadwell Loans) were enforceable against EHL. The clause provided as follows:', 'The Plaintiffs\u2019 claims are therefore brought on the basis of the EHL Agreements for the purported debts owed thereunder.', '10\\u2003As before, the Plaintiffs continued to receive monthly interest payments until payments completely ceased in June 2019. When that happened, Ms Gemma made inquiries with Mr Lee to understand the reasons for the cessation. The Plaintiffs discovered that: (a) Lim had gone missing and (b) in an announcement on 30 May 2019, EHL had disclosed based on a report by Deloitte & Touche LLP (\u201cthe D&T Report\u201d) that EHL\u2019s management had considered it prudent for certain funds to be received by Broadwell as a conduit, before onward transmission to EHL. Notably, the D&T report did not conclude that the EHL Loans were raised for EHL using this arrangement.', '11\\u2003On 11 July 2019, the Plaintiffs issued statutory demands against EHL for repayment of the EHL Loans. EHL\u2019s solicitors replied on 16 July 2019, disputing the Plaintiffs\u2019 claims on the grounds that EHL and its Independent Directors had \u201cno knowledge of [the EHL Loans] or their existence at all times\u201d until the receipt of the Plaintiffs\u2019 statutory demands, and stated that Lim had no authority to enter into the EHL Agreements on behalf of EHL at any material time.', '12\\u2003The Defendants were appointed the Interim Judicial Managers and Judicial Managers of EHL on 2 August 2019 and 4 September 2019 respectively. On 27 September 2019, the Plaintiffs submitted the Proofs of Debt. The Proofs of Debt were for the loans which the Plaintiffs had disbursed to Broadwell (ie, the Broadwell Loans) under the Broadwell Agreements and interest thereon, which according to the Plaintiffs became liabilities owed by EHL upon the issuance of the EHL Confirmations and the execution of the EHL Agreements. The Proofs of Debt were met with a request for documents from the Defendants. The documents sought by the Defendants pertained to two things: first, whether the Plaintiffs had disbursed loans to EHL in accordance with and in performance of the terms of the EHL Agreements, and second, whether monthly interest payments had been made by EHL to the Plaintiffs pursuant to the EHL Agreements. On 24 December 2019, the Plaintiffs responded by furnishing proof of their transfers of funds to Broadwell under the Broadwell Agreements as well as proof that they had received interest payments in 2019 (which did not, however, show that the payments were from EHL).', '13\\u2003On 13 January 2020, the Defendants issued Notices of Rejection of the Proofs of Debt.

In sum, a sentence of two weeks\u2019 imprisonment and a fine of \n$30,000 was submitted as being appropriate.\nSummary of the Prosecution\u2019s Arguments\n5 The Prosecution argued that the sentence below should be maintained.  \nThe precedents were said to indicate that sentences of between four and eight \nmonths\u2019 imprisonment should be imposed for losses between $1,000 and \n$15,000, and that, generally, the custodial threshold is crossed when the offence \nis committed for financial gain: Gan Chai Bee Anne v PP [2019] 4 SLR 838 \n(\u201cAnne Gan\u201d).  The DJ was said to have correctly applied the principles to \nconclude that a substantial custodial sentence was warranted. Aggravating \nfactors featured in the misuse of the DBS Bank\u2019s name, the planning and \npremeditation which underpinned the offending behaviour, the exploitation of \na vulnerable victim, and the post-offence conduct by the Appellant. In \ncomparison, the mitigating factors were said to have limited weight. The plea \nof guilt was not timely in that the Appellant only pleaded guilty two days before \nthe start of the trial. Further, while full restitution had been made, this did not \nVersion No 1: 16 Nov 2020 (11:09 hrs)\nRachel Ann Fernandez v PP[2020] SGHC 248\n4show genuine remorse given that it was made late in the day. I note for \ncompleteness that the DJ did accept that mitigating weight should still be given \nbecause the restitution had caused a reduction of the economic harm \nengendered. Nonetheless, the Prosecution argued that the making of full \nrestitution does not negate the need for a custodial sentence. \n6 The Prosecution further argued that two of the precedents relied upon \nby the Appellant were unreported and did not have written grounds rendered, \nand were in any event decided before the 2008 amendments to the Penal Code \nwhich increased the relevant punishments.  \n7 The Prosecution instead submitted that the sentencing precedents \nindicated a range of sentences of approximately three months\u2019 imprisonment for \ncases involving around $10,000, and four to five months\u2019 imprisonment for \namounts of about $20,000 to $25,000.   In light of these precedents, a sentence \nof seven months\u2019 imprisonment for the amount involved of $56,000 was \nappropriate. \nDecision\n8 While some factors were not properly weighted, I conclude that the \nsentence should not be disturbed as it is, overall, appropriate.\nSentencing Approach\n9 Of the various factors considered or argued for, I am primarily \nconcerned in these remarks with the age of the victim, the impact on the \nfinancial industry, restitution, and premeditation or planning. I am also \nconcerned that parties and the sentencing court should be mindful of the need \nVersion No 1: 16 Nov 2020 (11:09 hrs)\nRachel Ann Fernandez v PP[2020] SGHC 248\n5to consider applicable factors carefully and not treat the sentencing process as \none of merely affixing labels without deeper consideration.\nVulnerability\n10 While this was not a substantial plank on which the DJ rested his \ndecision on sentence, the Prosecution did argue that the victim, who was 60 at \nthe time of the offence, was a vulnerable victim because of her age. \n11 A person being 60 cannot by itself show vulnerability. 60 is far too \nyoung for that. There are many lawyers and judges who are in their 60s and are \nvery far from being vulnerable. The same holds true of most, if not all \nprofessions.  \n12 In the context of cheating charges, for age to indicate vulnerability, there \nwould have to be an impact on mental faculties, or something to indicate an \nincreased dependency on others, or a proclivity to misplacing trust. Someone \nbeing 60 is not automatically vulnerable in that regard; I am in fact doubtful that \neven many at 70 or 75 could be, without more, so described. If the assertion by \nthe Prosecution is that there has been some exploitation of a particular \nvulnerability present in someone of the age of 60, it should point to that \nvulnerability specifically. Such vulnerability might take the form of some \nmental illness, an unusual lack of expertise of understanding of ordinary \nconcepts, or a deterioration in mental abilities caused by the onset of some \ndisease.  But, the Prosecution cannot ask the court to take a 60 year old as being \nvulnerable to an offence of cheating without more. Where the Court may more \nreadily accept vulnerability because of age is where the crime involves some \nphysical threat or use of force. The Court would be willing to accept that in \nVersion No 1: 16 Nov 2020 (11:09 hrs)\nRachel Ann Fernandez v PP[2020] SGHC 248\n6general, in the absence of other evidence, a victim of 60 and above would be \nphysically vulnerable. \nThreat to the financial industry, a financial institution or a facility\n13 I am doubtful that there has been anything of a nature that would engage \nthis factor here. What the Appellant did was to use a letter purportedly in the \nname of the Chief Executive of the DBS Bank. She had also told the victim that \nthe scheme in question was one that involved the DBS Bank. \n14 The invocation of the names of personalities, corporate leaders, and \npolitical leaders is not unknown and importantly not uncommon in cheating \ncases.  Neither is the use of the name of a recognised financial institution\n15 It is clear that it is not every such invocation or use of the names of \nprominent individuals or of existing financial institutions that would bring a \ncase within the ambit of the principle in PP v Fernando Payagala Waduge \nMalitha Kuma [2007] 2 SLR(R) 334 (\u201cPayagala\u201d). Payagala involved charges \nof misappropriation of a credit card, as well as cheating through the fraudulent \nuse of that credit card. The Court in that case recognised at [19] that the \nfraudulent use of a credit card increased the gravity of a cheating offence. At \n[20], the Court further noted that:\nSingapore\u2019s standing as an international financial, commercial \nand transit hub is premised upon its ability to ensure that \nfinancial transactions are easily carried out and yet adequately \nsafeguarded. The prevalence of credit card offences will erode \npublic confidence and could have a deleterious effect on \nSingapore\u2019s standing as a preferred destination for tourism, \ntrade and investment. To check the abuse of credit cards, a \nsevere stance has to be consistently adopted and applied \nagainst all credit card offenders, regardless of whether they are \ncitizens, residents or transient visitors. In the present case, the \nrespondent was a transit passenger in a Singapore airport. I \nstress that deterrence should be of equal, if not greater, concern \nVersion No 1: 16 Nov 2020 (11:09 hrs)\nRachel Ann Fernandez v PP[2020] SGHC 248\n7in such cases, as short-term visitors to Singapore should not \nbe permitted to take advantage of and abuse the hospitality \naccorded and commercial opportunities available to them.\n16 The consideration in Payagala was of a threat to the international \nstanding of Singapore; prevalent credit card fraud would undermine \nSingapore\u2019s tourism, trade, and investment landscape by affecting genuine \ntransactions.  Credit card fraud is pernicious since it can be hard to detect, both \nin respect of a) forgeries, that is the use of counterfeit cards, as well as b) the \nuse of genuine cards by persons other than the actual cardholder.  Measures \ntaken to combat either of these will likely affect the ease of use of credit cards \nand undermine confidence in their use and acceptance. It is with that in mind \nthat general deterrence was merited for the credit card fraud committed in that \ncase, despite the offender being young and only in Singapore on transit.\n17 However, that need to protect the general standing of Singapore, and to \nsafeguard financial transactions carried on in Singapore, is not triggered in the \npresent case. The actions of the Appellant are not the sort as to undermine \nconfidence in the financial system on a systemic level, and would seem to be \nreadily detectable. Genuine investment in genuine products would likely not be \ndiscouraged by the criminal acts of the Appellant, reprehensible though the \nAppellant\u2019s acts may be. Nor would her acts conceivably affect the reputation \nof the DBS Bank or its CEO: all the Appellant had to sustain her assertion \nconcerning DBS Bank were her words and a fake email, without even anything \nlike a DBS Bank letterhead. It may be otherwise if one were to encounter a well-\ncrafted fake website, or even fake brochures or other such investment-linked \nparaphernalia.\nVersion No 1: 16 Nov 2020 (11:09 hrs)\nRachel Ann Fernandez v PP[2020] SGHC 248\n8Planning and premeditation \n18 The DJ found that there had been some planning in the present case, and \nthat such planning was a factor which went towards sentencing. Certainly, there \nhad been some planning involved, but it was not something of the nature as to \nattract a substantial increase in sentence. The level of sophistication and \npreparation here did not indicate a markedly increased level of criminal \nculpability, nor did it indicate any substantive degree of subterfuge or \npremeditation.\nRestitution\n19 Even if full restitution is given, such restitution may be of limited effect \nin showing remorse, and really only goes to reducing the economic harm \ncaused.  Here the DJ found, citing Anne Gan, that where economic harm is \nreduced, late restitution would still be mitigatory. I would note however that the \nChief Justice\u2019s consideration of the issue in Anne Gan was made in the context \nof a  situation where there was no intention on the part of the accused to \npersonally benefit, and it may be that the overall effect of late restitution as \nregards offenders who have benefited personally would have to be considered \nmore fully on another occasion.\nLabelling\n20 At this juncture, I would like to highlight that parties and Judges all have \nto be careful in how they approach sentencing submissions. Sentencing is not \nan exercise in labelling or slotting features into categories of aggravating and\/or \nmitigating factors. Taxonomy should not take centre-stage in sentencing for its \nown sake. Where particular facts are relied upon to evidence either aggravating \nor mitigating considerations, regard must be had to the actual ambit of the facts \nVersion No 1: 16 Nov 2020 (11:09 hrs)\nRachel Ann Fernandez v PP[2020] SGHC 248\n9and their relevance, purpose, and function in the sentencing process. Labelling \na particular fact as showing \u2018old age\u2019, \u2018vulnerability\u2019 or \u2018misuse of a financial \ninstrument\u2019 without going deeper would rarely be useful, and often, as is the \ncase here, might actually be unhelpful. In determining the appropriate sentence, \nJudges should carefully weigh and consider how these factors are actually in \nplay in the cases before them.\nSentencing Precedents.\n21 No sentencing framework has yet been laid down for offences of this \nnature. This is not to my mind, however, an appropriate case for such a \nframework to be laid down. It is sufficient in this case to consider how the \ncurrent circumstances sit alongside the precedents relied upon by both sides.   \nThe primary considerations in this regard are:\n(a) The quantum involved;\n(b) The effect of the restitution; and\n(c) The weight that can be attributed to the plea of guilt.\nI note in addition that the DJ had accepted that the victim was vulnerable \nbecause of her age, and that there had been an impact on the financial system \nwhich was aggravating. As has been noted above, I was not convinced that, \nbased on the evidence, these factors were actually engaged on the instant facts. \n22 I will consider in these remarks only some of the precedents cited, and \nin particular those which I find most useful to comment on. I note in PP v Chen \nYoung Ja [2014] SGDC 454, a total of 5 months\u2019 imprisonment was imposed \nfollowing the accused\u2019s plea of guilt in facts concerning a sum of about $21,000 \nthat was cheated, with full restitution having been made.  That sentence would \nVersion No 1: 16 Nov 2020 (11:09 hrs)\nRachel Ann Fernandez v PP[2020] SGHC 248\n10appear to be appropriate. In comparison, in Lee Hwai San, 4 months\u2019 \nimprisonment was imposed for a total of $65,000 cheated, with full restitution \nalso having been made. It is of note that the accused in Lee Hwai San had made \na substantial amount of partial restitution to the victim even before having been \ncharged.  Given that factor, the ultimate sentence in Lee Hwai San may have \nbeen correct, though perhaps at the lower end of the appropriate range.  \n23  The quantum involved in the present case called for the imposition of a \nsubstantial term of imprisonment. Deterrence was an important sentencing \nconsideration on the facts. Taking the other factors into account, I am of the \nview that the DJ only really erred in ascribing some aggravating weight to an \nalleged impact on the financial industry on the facts. It would not seem that \nsubstantial store was placed by the DJ on the supposed vulnerability of the \nvictim simply because of her age. The primary sentencing factor, as the DJ \ncorrectly identified, was the quantum cheated, though the DJ may have given \nsomewhat more weight to the erasing of harm by restitution that I would have \ndone myself. In any event, that operated to the benefit of the Appellant, and is \nnot being"}

Most of the facts before us were uncontroversial and supported by contemporaneous evidence. Where the facts were contentious, given that these are disciplinary proceedings which have the potential to adversely impact the Respondent\u2019s livelihood and reputation, we apply the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt: see Law Society of Singapore v Ahmad Khalis bin Abdul Ghani [2006] 4 SLR(R) 308 (\u201cAhmad Khalis\u201d) at [6], Law Society of Singapore v Wan Hui Hong James [2013] 3 SLR 221 (\u201cJames Wan\u201d) at [46]\u2013[52] and Law Society of Singapore v Udeh Kumar s\/o Sethuraju [2013] 3 SLR 875 at [47].', '5\\u2003We begin by setting out some key events that preceded and are relevant to our ensuing discussion and analysis of the events surrounding the execution of the Testator\u2019s last will. Between 20 August 2011 and 2 November 2012, the Testator executed six wills (referred to as the \u201cFirst Will\u201d to the \u201cSixth Will\u201d respectively). Each of these was prepared by Ms Kwa Kim Li (\u201cMs Kwa\u201d), a partner in the law firm, Lee & Lee. The wills reflected the Testator\u2019s evolving wishes with regard to the bequest of his estate. Some of the key changes in the terms of his various wills are summarised below:', '(a)\\u2003In the First Will, which was dated 20 August 2011, the Testator granted a one-third share of his estate to each of his three children, namely, Mr Lee Hsien Loong (\u201cMr LHL\u201d), Dr Lee Wei Ling (\u201cDr LWL\u201d) and the Respondent\u2019s husband, Mr Lee Hsien Yang (\u201cMr LHY\u201d). It was agreed between the children that each of them would take a specific property of the Testator\u2019s, rather than have his properties jointly held in their names. 2', 'Pursuant to this agreement, the Testator\u2019s house at 38 Oxley Road (\u201cthe Oxley House\u201d) was bequeathed to Mr LHL, while Dr LWL and Mr LHY received various other properties owned by the Testator. The First Will also granted Dr LWL the right to reside rent-free at the Oxley House for as long as she desired, 3', 'and stipulated the Testator\u2019s wish that the Oxley House be demolished either upon his passing or after Dr LWL had moved out, whichever was later (\u201cthe Demolition Clause\u201d). 4', 'In addition, there was a clause providing for the valuation of the Testator\u2019s properties, with such valuation to be undertaken as at the date of his death (\u201cthe Valuation Clause\u201d). 5', '(b)\\u2003In the Second Will, which was dated 21 December 2011, Dr LWL\u2019s right to reside at the Oxley House was removed. 6', '(c)\\u2003In the Third Will, which was dated 6 September 2012, each child\u2019s one-third share of the Testator\u2019s estate was altered, such that Mr LHL and Mr LHY each received three shares absolutely, while Dr LWL received four shares that were held upon trust for her life, and after her death, upon trust for Mr LHL and Mr LHY in equal shares. 7', '(d)\\u2003In the Fourth Will, which was dated 20 September 2012, the Testator reverted in substance to his Second Will, such that each child\u2019s one-third share in the estate was reinstated, 8', 'save that the Valuation Clause was removed. 9', '(e)\\u2003In the Fifth Will, which was dated 4 October 2012, Dr LWL was once again granted the right to reside at the Oxley House (which had been removed in the Second Will, and which was not reinstated in the Third and Fourth Wills). However, this right was made subject to the consent of Mr LHL, who was bequeathed the Oxley House as part of his one-third share of the Testator\u2019s estate, and, unlike the First Will, there was no mention that it was a right to reside at the Oxley House \u201cfree of rent\u201d. 10', 'The Demolition Clause, which had featured in the first four wills, was removed. 11', '(f)\\u2003In the Sixth Will, which was dated 2 November 2012, the Testator changed the shares in which his estate would be left to his children. This will provided for a total of seven shares, with Mr LHL and Mr LHY to receive two shares each, and Dr LWL, three shares (1\/7 more than her brothers). 12', 'As with the Fifth Will, there was no Demolition Clause in the Sixth Will.', '6\\u2003It is not clear on the evidence whether the Testator\u2019s children knew about the precise contents of each of the six wills. But, for the purposes of the present proceedings, it is not necessary for us to come to a firm view on this, save to note that it was not disputed that all three of them were aware that they were beneficiaries under each of the Testator\u2019s wills. 13', '7\\u2003Sometime after the execution of the Sixth Will on 2 November 2012, the Testator\u2019s health deteriorated markedly. Between September and October 2013, he was hospitalised for an extended period with a number of medical issues, the details of which are not material.', '8\\u2003Following his discharge from hospital, the Testator initiated discussions with Ms Kwa on or around 29 November 2013 about making some changes to the Sixth Will. Certain aspects of their discussions were recorded in a series of emails beginning on 30 November 2013. In her email of that date, Ms Kwa summarised some of the key provisions of the Sixth Will. This included the bequest of the Oxley House to Mr LHL as part of his share of the estate. As noted earlier, the Testator\u2019s children had evidently agreed that each of them would be left specific properties from the Testator\u2019s estate, rather than have his various properties jointly held in their names. In the same email, Ms Kwa also recalled that the Testator had raised the possibility of the Oxley House becoming \u201cde-gazetted\u201d after his passing, in which event the value of that property might escalate. The Testator was concerned to ensure that if that happened, Dr LWL and Mr LHY should also benefit from any increased value. Ms Kwa outlined various options to address this concern. 14', '9\\u2003It appears that there were further discussions between the Testator and Ms Kwa, although these are not reflected in the email chain before us. On 12 December 2013, Ms Kwa wrote to the Testator again, noting his wish to revert to leaving equal shares of his estate to each of his children. In other words, unlike what had been provided for in the Sixth Will, Dr LWL would not be left an additional share. Ms Kwa also noted the Testator\u2019s wish that a codicil be prepared to effect this. Ms Kwa stated that she would prepare the codicil for the Testator to sign \u201cthis week, or when [he was] ready\u201d. Finally, she stated that \u201c[r]egarding the Oxley [House], [she had] some thoughts and [would] call [the Testator] later\u201d that day to discuss. 15', '10\\u2003The Testator replied to Ms Kwa on 13 December 2013 at 10.50pm, stating that \u201c[the] codicil [was also] to specify that two carpets \u2026 go to [Mr LHY]\u201d. 16', '11\\u2003The email correspondence between Ms Kwa and the Testator ceased with the Testator\u2019s 10.50pm email on 13 December 2013, which was a Friday. The Respondent was not involved or copied in any of the foregoing discussions. As at 13 December 2013, which was three days before the Testator received from the Respondent a draft of what became his last will, the Testator\u2019s professed intention that had been discussed over a two-week period with his solicitor, Ms Kwa, was to execute a codicil to his Sixth Will that would: (a) revert to leaving his estate to his three children in equal shares; and (b) make provision for two carpets to be bequeathed to Mr LHY. While there had been discussions about making provision for any escalation of the value of the Oxley House in the event that it was \u201cde-gazetted\u201d, there had been no discussions about replacing the Sixth Will with another will, nor about reinstating either the First Will as a whole or the Demolition Clause in particular.', '12\\u2003No evidence was led as to what transpired over the weekend of 14 and 15 December 2013. On 16 December 2013, the Respondent sent an email to the Testator at 7.08pm, copying her husband, Mr LHY, and, evidently (based on the list of addressees), also Ms Kwa, although it appears that Ms Kwa, for some unknown reason, did not receive that email (the \u201c7.08pm email\u201d). 17', 'To that email, the Respondent attached a draft will that appeared to have been dated 19 August 2011, and informed the Testator that \u201c[t]his was the original agreed Will which ensures that all 3 children receive equal shares\u201d [emphasis added]. She also addressed Ms Kwa, stating that she would be \u201c[g]rateful if [Ms Kwa] could please engross\u201d the enclosed draft. 18', '13\\u2003The circumstances which led to the Respondent sending the 7.08pm email and the means by which she obtained the draft will attached to that email are the subject of much contention between the parties, and we shall address these two issues later in this judgment (see [71]\u2013[103] below).', '14\\u2003What is undisputed, however, is that the words \u201coriginal agreed Will\u201d in the 7.08pm email were intended by the Respondent to refer to the Testator\u2019s First Will (dated 20 August 2011), and would have been understood by the Testator as such. 19', 'It is also undisputed that the draft will attached to that email was engrossed and eventually executed by the Testator on 17 December 2013 without any substantive amendment, and became his last will. For ease of distinction, we shall hereafter use the term \u201cDraft Last Will\u201d when referring specifically to the draft will attached to the 7.08pm email, and the term \u201cLast Will\u201d when referring to the Testator\u2019s final will in all other instances.', '15\\u2003The Respondent had assisted the Testator in drafting certain aspects of his First Will, 20', 'and when she sent him the Draft Last Will on 16 December 2013, she thought that it was the same as the First Will. 21', 'Hence, she told him that the Draft Last Will was \u201cthe original agreed Will\u201d (meaning the First Will).

While it appears to have been similar in many respects to the First Will, nothing by way of evidence was led as to its provenance. The most that might be inferred is that it was one of the drafts that was prepared in the period leading up to the finalisation and execution of the First Will. However, even on that basis, it is not known what led to that draft subsequently being modified into the final form that the First Will took, giving rise to (among other differences) the differences noted above. What is clear on the evidence, and also accepted by the parties, is that:', '(a)\\u2003the Testator was told by the Respondent in the 7.08pm email that the Draft Last Will was the First Will;', '(b)\\u2003the Testator would have believed that representation at the time he signed the Last Will; and', '(c)\\u2003the document that the Testator signed was, as we have noted, in fact not the same as the First Will.', '17\\u2003At 7.31pm on 16 December 2013, shortly after the Respondent\u2019s 7.08pm email, Mr LHY sent the following email (the \u201c7.31pm email\u201d) to the Respondent, copying the Testator and the Testator\u2019s personal secretary, Ms Wong Lin Hoe (\u201cMs Wong\u201d), while removing Ms Kwa from the list of addressees: 22', '18\\u2003Before the Testator had even responded to the above suggestion by Mr LHY, the Respondent emailed Ms Wong at 8.12pm, copying Mr LHY and her colleague, Mr Bernard Lui (\u201cMr Lui\u201d).

In 2003, the defendant obtained its license to operate a taxi business. The defendant\u2019s taxis were called \u201cSmart taxis\u201d. At the relevant time, the defendant had a fleet of approximately 650 Smart taxis. 5', 'The defendant\u2019s taxi business ceased in 2013 as its license for operating taxi services was not renewed, and expired sometime in or around September 2013. 6', '4\\u2003As outlined above, the plaintiff was the defendant\u2019s insurer for its Smart taxis under the Policy. Under the Policy, the plaintiff provided cover for any third party accident claims against all taxis operated by the defendant within Singapore for the period of insurance, which was a duration of three years from 1 March 2009 to 29 February 2012. HL Suntek Insurance Brokers Pte Ltd (\u201cHL Suntek\u201d) was the defendant\u2019s insurance broker in respect of the Policy. 7', '5\\u2003The premium that the defendant had to pay under the Policy was structured in the following way. First, the defendant was required to pay a \u201cMinimum Deposit Premium\u201d (\u201cMDP\u201d), which was calculated at the rate of S$1,800 per taxi per annum. 8', '6\\u2003Second, the defendant was also required to pay what is known as the \u201cBurning Cost Premium\u201d (\u201cBCP\u201d). 9', 'This is calculated based on two components. 10', 'The first component is the sum of the claims paid by the plaintiff less the excess payment for each claim. The second component is the amount in the reasonable opinion of the plaintiff that is needed to settle outstanding claims, again less the excess payment. Both these component sums are multiplied by 100\/75 in order the derive the total amount of BCP payable. 11', '7\\u2003However, significantly, the Policy also set a cap on the maximum amount of premium that was payable by the defendant. That cap is described as the \u201cMaximum Premium\u201d (\u201cMP\u201d) and was set at S$3,000 per taxi per annum. 12', 'So, as an example, if 650 taxis were insured, then the sum of the MDP and BCP chargeable by the plaintiff cannot exceed S$1.95m (650 multiplied by S$3,000) in a year.', '8\\u2003The other element under the Policy which is somewhat relevant to some of the factual disputes in this case is the amount of excess payments (also known as deductibles) that must be made by the defendant for claims under the Policy. As in the case of any motor insurance policy, the insured is liable to make excess payments, and the insurer is liable only for the amount over and above the excess. In the Policy, the parties agreed to set the excess at S$5,000 per claim, which meant that the defendant has to bear any claim under the Policy up to the amount of S$5,000. 13', 'These excess payments are collected from the defendant in arrears.', '9\\u2003The defendant\u2019s license to carry out a taxi business expired in September 2013.

In summary, after taking into account that the MP under the Policy was capped at S$6,135,603.60, the amount of BCP that the plaintiff was claiming from the defendant was the amount of S$2,626,900.76, inclusive of goods and services tax (\u201cGST\u201d). 19', 'The plaintiff\u2019s solicitors\u2019 letters of 16 and 19 August 2013 to the defendant, when read together, also stated the same figure of BCP being claimed from the defendant. 20', '13\\u2003Second, the plaintiff and its solicitors also wrote separately to the defendant on the excess payments due from the defendant. 21', 'The amount in question was said to be S$606,955.72. In the plaintiff\u2019s letter of 16 August 2013, it was also stated that there were, additionally, another 567 \u201cpending claims\u201d, and that the \u201ctotal estimated policy excess recoverable\u201d from the defendant in respect of those claims was S$1,533,265.48. 22', 'The plaintiff asked the defendant to provide a bank guarantee for the amount of S$1.5m as security for the \u201canticipated [p]olicy excess recovery for these 567 pending claims\u201d. This was subsequently clarified in another letter from the plaintiff where the number of pending claims was revised to 575. 23', '14\\u2003The defendant made payment of S$100,000 to reduce the outstanding amount owed as excess payments. 24', 'Then, HL Suntek requested that the plaintiff provide a breakdown of the BCP amount claimed between the figures for \u201cpaid claims\u201d and for \u201coutstanding claims\u201d (see [6] above). This breakdown was furnished by the plaintiff in Tan Hue Peng\u2019s (\u201cHP Tan\u201d) email of 6 September 2013. 25', 'Following this, the plaintiff continued to chase the defendant for payment of both the outstanding excess amounts and the BCP.

For instance, there was an agreed cap of S$64,000 in quantum for excess payments that the defendant would be liable for in relation to those 25 third party claims. 45', '28\\u2003The defendant duly presented the plaintiff with two cheques on the day of the execution of the Settlement Agreement.

The syndicate comprised, amongst others, the following personnel:', '(a)\\u2003Three leaders, namely, Eric Seet, Steven Seet and Philip Seet (collectively, \u201cthe Seet brothers\u201d). They operated two remote gambling four-digit (\u201c4D\u201d) websites: www.asure6.net (\u201cthe asure6 website\u201d) and www.888pool.net (\u201cthe 888pool website\u201d).', '(b)\\u2003One chief runner, who on instructions from the Seet brothers, would collect and distribute monies for illegal gambling operations.', '(c)\\u2003Three administrative staff, namely, the appellant, Sunny Lai Yen San (\u201cSunny Lai\u201d) and a third person.', 'The syndicate had three main clusters, each comprising agents who collected bets and shareholders who shared in the profits and losses flowing from the asure6 and 888pool websites.', '5\\u2003The operations of the asure6 and 888pool websites were centrally managed and controlled from Singapore. Illegal 4D bets placed by agents and punters were keyed into these websites. Public lotteries were then conducted using remote communications.', '6\\u2003Sometime in early 2012, the appellant, who was then in Malaysia, received a call from Steven Seet, one of the syndicate leaders. The two had become acquainted when the appellant worked for Steven Seet as a secretary in a massage parlour in Singapore back in 2009. Steven Seet offered the appellant a job in Singapore as an accounts assistant with an entity called Erictex Trading (\u201cErictex\u201d). The appellant was informed by Steven Seet that Erictex was an IT company supporting licensed gambling in Philippines and she accepted the job offer.', '7\\u2003In February 2012, the appellant commenced work at Erictex. Its premises were located at Ubi Road. There, she worked together with some IT programming workers, who assisted in troubleshooting the asure6 and 888pool websites as well as a bookkeeping website called www.ES123.net (\u201cthe ES123 website\u201d). Shortly thereafter, the appellant came to learn that Erictex was dealing with illegal 4D and horse betting activities. Specifically, she learnt that asure6 and 888pool were illegal 4D betting websites operated by Eric Seet and Steven Seet. She also learnt that the ES123 website was a bookkeeping platform maintained by the syndicate to track the syndicate\u2019s cash flow and expenses for illegal 4D bets.', '8\\u2003Further, the appellant learnt that apart from Erictex, two other companies, namely SB IT Developer (\u201cSB IT\u201d) and Best Laser Music House, had also been established by Eric Seet and Steven Seet. These two companies, along with Erictex, were companies that had no real legitimate business activities and together, they shared three office units at Ubi Road. The appellant knew that these three shell companies had been established only for the purpose of carrying out illegal 4D and horse betting activities through the asure6 and 888pool websites. Whilst the appellant was, strictly speaking, employed by Erictex, she managed and attended to administrative matters for all three shell companies.', '9\\u2003The appellant\u2019s administrative work consisted of the following:', '(a)\\u2003preparing the payroll for all employees of Erictex and SB IT by obtaining Steven Seet\u2019s approval of the list of employees and the amounts payable to them.

In addition to her work in the syndicate as outlined above, the appellant also assisted with the administrative matters of other legitimate businesses set up by Eric Seet and Steven Seet, specifically, a caf\u00e9, a coffee shop and a bakery.', '11\\u2003Notably, the appellant also recruited another administrative staff, one Sunny Lai, into the syndicate. Sometime in 2013, the appellant learnt that Steven Seet was looking for someone to help key in reports relating to illegal 4D activities. The appellant, despite knowing that the syndicate was engaged in illegal activities, asked Sunny Lai if she would be interested to join Steven Seet\u2019s operation and told her that her job would involve keying in data related to illegal gambling activities.

After their late father\u2019s death, the parties reached a compromise agreement (\u201cthe Compromise Agreement\u201d), which was executed on 29 December 2010. 1', 'The relevant terms of the Compromise Agreement were as follows: 2', '(a)\\u2003Seven out of the 27 properties in India would be allocated to the plaintiff, while the rest were allocated to the defendants. Specific valuations were attributed to each of the 27 properties.', '(b)\\u2003The share in the property in Singapore would be sold. The plaintiff would keep 20% of the sale proceeds whereas the remaining 80% would be paid by the plaintiff to the defendants.', '(c)\\u2003The plaintiff was to pay to each of the defendants the sum of $262,500, amounting to $1,050,000 in total within 12 months following the execution of the Compromise Agreement.', '4\\u2003Subsequently, the share in the property in Singapore was sold and the total sale proceeds amounted to slightly less than $100,000, which was held by the plaintiff. The plaintiff also failed to pay the sum of $1,050,000 to the defendants. 3', '5\\u2003In 2012, the defendants commenced an action in the Singapore High Court against the plaintiff to claim for the sum of $1,050,000 and their share of the sale proceeds of the share in the property in Singapore. The plaintiff resisted the defendants\u2019 claim and instituted a counterclaim. On 25 May 2016, the High Court found that the Compromise Agreement was valid and allowed the defendants\u2019 claim, ordering the plaintiff to pay to the defendants the sum of $1,050,000 and 80% of the sale proceeds of the share in the Singapore property as claimed, as well as interest of 5.33% per annum from 25 May 2012 (\u201cthe Judgment Sum\u201d) (see L Manimuthu and others v L Shanmuganathan [2016] 5 SLR 719 at [31]). The High Court also allowed the plaintiff\u2019s counterclaim, ordering the defendants to transfer to the plaintiff six out of the seven properties allocated under the Compromise Agreement (\u201cthe Six Properties\u201d). For the remaining property that had been sold by the defendants (\u201cthe Seventh Property\u201d), the High Court ordered the defendants to return to the plaintiff the relevant documents and the sale proceeds amounting to $10,000. On appeal, the Court of Appeal upheld the High Court\u2019s decision. 4', '6\\u2003Following the High Court\u2019s decision, the defendants provided the plaintiff with the documentation regarding the sale of the Seventh Property. The defendants also offered to transfer the Six Properties to the plaintiff as well as pay the plaintiff the sale proceeds of the Seventh Property amounting to $10,000. The defendants also demanded that the plaintiff pay them the Judgment Sum, which amounted to more than $2m because of the accumulated interest accrued.

{"casename":"2020_SGHC_264","fact":"the facts of the present case, Ho\u2019s evidence was that when he \nhad first sought funding from Jesper, \u201cthis funding was discussed as a personal \nloan from Jesper Lim\u201d. It was only later on that Jesper had informed him that \nVersion No 1: 03 Dec 2020 (12:00 hrs)\nGA Machinery Pte Ltd v Yue Xiang Pte Ltd[2020] SGHC 264\n9the loan ought to be structured as an inter-company loan so as to avoid \n\u201cmoneylending behaviour\u201d. This was disputed by Jesper, who claimed GA \nMachinery had \u201ca lot of used machinery to transfer or sell to Yue Xiang\u201d, and  \nbecause GA Machinery, Yue Xiang and PT Terus might \u201cen[d] up with a three-\nparty joint venture\u201d, GA agreed to help Yue Xiang by lending money directly \nto Yue Xiang. Jesper did not provide any further explanation of how this \nconvoluted transaction might work. \n23 As there was no contemporaneous evidence of the circumstances \nsurrounding the Loan Agreements, my findings on this issue turn primarily on \nthe parties\u2019 testimonies. Despite the presence of several discrepancies between \nhis affidavits, Ho struck me as a candid and forthright witness. I accept that Ho \nhad readily entered into the Loan Agreements despite knowing that they were \nmoneylending transactions because he had been facing severe cash-flow \nproblems and was desperate to secure additional funding on short notice. By \ncontrast, Jesper\u2019s explanation that GA Machinery and Yue Xiang might \neventually form a joint venture seems contrived. Despite its obvious \nsignificance, this explanation had not been raised in any of Jesper\u2019s affidavits \nand had only emerged for the first time at trial. I therefore prefer Ho\u2019s account \nof the events which had transpired between Jesper and himself.  \n24 Admittedly, this was not a case where the Loans had been granted to Ho \nfor his own domestic or social expenses. Rather, as Ho himself conceded during \ncross-examination, the loans were intended to fund Ho\u2019s iron sand mining \nprojects (which, presumably, he was undertaking through Yue Xiang). \nHowever, it is important to note that Ho was, at all material times, the sole \ndirector and shareholder of Yue Xiang. The evidence suggests not only that Ho \nwas the only person behind Yue Xiang, but also that he treated Yue Xiang as an \nextension of himself. It did not matter to Ho whether the Loans were extended \nVersion No 1: 03 Dec 2020 (12:00 hrs)\nGA Machinery Pte Ltd v Yue Xiang Pte Ltd[2020] SGHC 264\n10to Yue Xiang or to himself personally. In fact, but for Jesper\u2019s insistence that \nthe Loans be furnished to Yue Xiang instead of Ho in order to circumvent the \nMLA provisions, it is likely that the Loans would have been structured as \npersonal loans. Therefore, although the Loans may have been commercial loans \nin form, I am satisfied that they are personal loans in substance. I thus reject the \nplaintiffs\u2019 argument that GA Machinery was an excluded moneylender under \nthe MLA. \n25 I now proceed to determine whether GA Machinery was \u201cin the business \nof moneylending\u201d. Although the burden of proving this fact lies on the \nborrower, s 3 of the MLA provides that \u201c[a]ny person, other than an excluded \nmoneylender, who lends a sum of money in consideration of a larger sum being \nrepaid shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, to be a moneylender\u201d. \n26 It is undisputed that the Loans were, on their face, interest-free. \nAccording to Ho, however, Jesper told him that the interest on the Loans was \n4% per month, and that the amounts of interest due each month were set out \nunder the payment schedules of the Sales Contracts. Thus, were the Sales \nContracts sham agreements that did not reflect genuine sales of machinery by \nSolid Mining to Yue Xiang?\n27 According to the defendants, the four magnetic extractors which Yue \nXiang took possession of in 2014 were purchased directly from PT Terus, and \nnot from Solid Mining as alleged by the plaintiffs. After the commencement of \nthis action, Jesper had requested for Ho sign a backdated letter acknowledging \nreceipt of Item No. 3, as well as a backdated delivery order for Item No. 3. \nHowever, Ho had not signed these documents as he believed their contents to \nbe untrue. There is therefore no evidence whatsoever evidencing the delivery of \nequipment under the Sales Contracts. \nVersion No 1: 03 Dec 2020 (12:00 hrs)\nGA Machinery Pte Ltd v Yue Xiang Pte Ltd[2020] SGHC 264\n1128 In response, the plaintiffs argue that Ho had expressly stated in his AEIC \ndated 25 January 2018 (\u201cthe 2018 Affidavit\u201d) that the four magnetic extractors \nwere purchased under the Second Sales Contract as Item No. 3. Additionally, \nthere was no evidence of the purported sales contract between Yue Xiang and \nPT Terus.\n29 The state of the evidence before me is certainly not satisfactory, but I \nam inclined to accept the defendants\u2019 account. First, although there were clear \ninconsistencies between the 2018 Affidavit and Ho\u2019s testimony at trial, I am of \nthe view that these inconsistencies are not fatal to the defendants\u2019 case. The \ncontext of the 2018 Affidavit must be borne in mind. At the time, the plaintiffs \nhad obtained a default judgment against Ho, and the plaintiffs\u2019 solicitors had \nprocured Ho to depose the 2018 Affidavit on matters of fact relating to the \nproceedings between the plaintiffs and Tay. Although the plaintiffs\u2019 solicitors\u2019 \nactions were not incorrect in law, Ho was not represented at the material time \nand was, it seemed to me, not fully apprised of the significance of the 2018 \nAffidavit and the statements therein. I caveat, however, that my view is that the \ndiscrepancies in the 2018 Affidavit were likely the product of Ho\u2019s own \nignorance, and not (as counsel for the defendants claim) the result of any \nmisconduct or negligence on the plaintiffs\u2019 solicitors\u2019 part. \n30 Second, the plaintiffs did not tender any documentary evidence to prove \nthat a delivery (or deliveries) had taken place under the Second Sales Contract. \nIn contrast, the defendants adduced various documents showing that Yue Xiang \nhad remitted monies to various parties for its purchase of the four magnetic \nextractors from PT Terus. These include (a) a transfer slip showing that Yue \nXiang had made a S$63,318.06 remittance to an entity called Unibest Shipping \nand Logistics Co (\u201cUnibest\u201d), and (b) a transfer slip showing that Yue Xiang \nhad remitted NTD 150,000 to a Taiwanese bank account belonging to an \nVersion No 1: 03 Dec 2020 (12:00 hrs)\nGA Machinery Pte Ltd v Yue Xiang Pte Ltd[2020] SGHC 264\n12individual called Yu Chi Han (\u201cYu\u201d). There was also a WhatsApp conversation \nbetween Ho and Tay dated 11 January 2018 which I reproduce below for \nconvenience: \nHo: I told [Jesper] how to sign [the backdated letter \nacknowledging receipt of the magnetic extractors]? He \nsaid is true I took the machines. \nTay: But the machines not from him \nTay: Not he sold you\nHo: Both know from Lee.\n31 Admittedly, the defendants\u2019 evidence is not without problems. Aside \nfrom Ho\u2019s and Tay\u2019s testimonies, there is no evidence to show that Yu was, as \nthe defendants claim, Lee\u2019s wife. Nor is there any documentary evidence to \nshow that Unibest was a company that was owned by or related to Lee. The \nWhatsApp conversation must also be treated with circumspection given that it \nis not contemporaneous with the purchase of the magnetic extractors. \nNevertheless, and as stated at [23] above, I am satisfied that Ho is a more \ncredible witness than Jesper. I find it incredible that Solid Mining does not have \neven a shred of evidence to prove that delivery had taken place under the Sales \nContracts. Overall, the weight of the evidence leans in the defendants\u2019 favour. \nFurthermore, the absence of documentary evidence belies the simple fact that \nHo was in need of money urgently. In the broader context, this supports the \ndefendants\u2019 case as it demonstrates that Ho was the type of vulnerable and \ninexperienced victim contemplated by the MLA. \n32 Finally, the timing of the Loan Agreements and the Sales Contracts \nsupports the defendants\u2019 claims that they were in fact related. Tellingly, the First \nLoan Agreement and the First Sales Contract were signed on the very same day. \nThe Second Sales Contract was signed just four days after the Second Loan \nVersion No 1: 03 Dec 2020 (12:00 hrs)\nGA Machinery Pte Ltd v Yue Xiang Pte Ltd[2020] SGHC 264\n13Agreement was signed. When asked about this coincidence of dates during \ncross-examination, Jesper\u2019s explanation was as follows:\nA: This is part of the commercial negotiation to extend the \nloan for the cash flow without interest so that we can \ndispose of my machine, my mining equipment to sell it \nto [Ho] so that he can have it for the operation. So it\u2019s \npart and parcel of the commercial decision. \nQ: What decision? \nA: Commercial decision. \nQ: What decision?\nA: Commercial decision that I extend to him the loan, he \npromise to buy my equipment.  \n33 This explanation, like Jesper\u2019s clarification that he had wanted to form \na joint venture with Yue Xiang, only surfaced at trial. There were no records \nwhatsoever, eg in the form of correspondence or meeting minutes, documenting \nthe alleged \u201ccommercial negotiation\u201d between Jesper and Ho. Given Jesper\u2019s \napparent tendency to embellish his evidence, it appeared to me that this \n\u201ccommercial negotiation\u201d was simply another excuse which Jesper had devised \nto avoid liability under the MLA. \n34 In the premises, I am satisfied that Ho did not take possession of Item \nNo. 3, and is therefore not obliged to pay the Varied Sale Price to Solid Mining. \nI also find that the Sales Contracts were not bona fide contracts for the sale and \npurchase of mining equipment, but sham agreements that were designed to \nconceal the interest that Jesper (through GA Machinery) was charging for the \nLoans. \n35 I acknowledge that the payment schedules in the Sales Contracts appear \nto disclose a substantially higher monthly interest rate than the 4% alleged by \nHo. Under the First Sales Contract, Yue Xiang was required to pay Solid Mining \nVersion No 1: 03 Dec 2020 (12:00 hrs)\nGA Machinery Pte Ltd v Yue Xiang Pte Ltd[2020] SGHC 264\n14instalments of S$10,000 from 1 July 2014 to 1 September 2014, and instalments \nof S$22,800 per month from 1 October 2014 to 1 July 2015. This works out to \nan interest rate of 4% per month for the first three months, and 9.12% per month \nfor the next ten months, on a loan of S$250,000. Under the Second Sales \nContract, Yue Xiang was required to play Solid Mining instalments of S$22,800 \nper month from 1 March 2015 to 1 July 2015, and instalments of S$33,800 per \nmonth from 1 August 2015 to 1 December 2015. This works out to an interest \nrate of 6.08% per month for the first five months, and 9.01% for the next five \nmonths, on a loan of S$375,000 (ie, the combined value of the First and Second \nLoans). \n36 Notwithstanding the inconsistency, I accept Ho\u2019s testimony that the \nLoans were not disbursed interest-free, and that the amount of interest payable \n\u2e3b regardless of whether it was 4% per month or 9.12% per month or more \u2e3a \nwas fixed at an exorbitant rate. Thus, the presumption under s 3 of the MLA \napplies and the burden shifts to the plaintiffs to prove that GA Machinery was \nnot in the business of moneylending. \n37 There are two tests to determine whether a person is in the business of \nmoneylending (E C Investment at [135]). The first is whether there is a certain \ndegree of system and continuity in the moneylending transactions. If the answer \nis no, the court applies the second test, which is whether the alleged \nmoneylender is one who is willing to lend to all and sundry provided that they \nare from his point of view eligible.\n38 I accept that there was no system and continuity in the transactions. In \nthis case, only two loans were made, and it does not appear that the loan \namounts, the interest amounts or the methods of disbursing the loans were fixed \nor organised in a systematic manner. The defendants\u2019 claims that Jesper had set \nVersion No 1: 03 Dec 2020 (12:00 hrs)\nGA Machinery Pte Ltd v Yue Xiang Pte Ltd[2020] SGHC 264\n15up various companies to conduct moneylending transactions under the guise of \ndealing in machinery are entirely speculative. Moreover, the plaintiffs have \ndisclosed the bank statements of GA for May to June 2014 which do not reveal \nany routine series of loans, whether to Yue Xiang or otherwise. \n39 Nonetheless, I accept the defendants\u2019 argument that Yue Xiang was, for \nall intents and purposes, \u201call and sundry\u201d. Jesper and Ho had barely known each \nother at the time of the relevant transactions and, as stated at [ 23] above, I \ndisbelieve Jesper\u2019s evidence that he had intended for GA Machinery to enter \ninto a joint venture with Yue Xiang. In my view, Jesper had procured GA \nMachinery to extend the Loans to Yue Xiang because he foresaw an opportunity \nto make a profit therefrom. Ho had no choice but to agree to the exorbitant \ninterest rates because of his desperate need for money. This was precisely the \nkind of transaction that the MLA was designed to prevent. \n40 I therefore find that GA Machinery is a \u201cmoneylender\u201d for the purposes \nof s 2 of the MLA, and that the Loans and the Fixed Fees are not recoverable \npursuant to s 14(2) of the MLA.\n41 Although it is no longer necessary for me to deal with the defendants\u2019 \nfinal two contentions, I will address them briefly for completeness. \n42 I turn first to the defendants\u2019 submission that GA Machinery lacks the \nlocus standi to make a claim for the First and Second Loans. According to the \ndefendants, the monies for the First Loan had been provided by a company \ncalled J Lim Piling Pte Ltd (\u201cJ Lim\u201d), and the monies for the Second Loan had \nbeen provided by a company called Jay Machinery Pte Ltd (\u201cJay Machinery\u201d). \nAs such, GA Machinery is not the proper party to recover the First and Second \nLoans since it has not suffered any loss therefrom. \nVersion No 1: 03 Dec 2020 (12:00 hrs)\nGA Machinery Pte Ltd v Yue Xiang Pte Ltd[2020] SGHC 264\n1643 I agree with the plaintiffs that this argument is bound to fail. It is \nundisputed that the monies for the Loans were transferred by J Lim and Jay \nMachinery to GA Machinery, which then disbursed these sums to Yue Xiang \ndirectly. There is no legal requirement that the source of funds for a loan \ntransaction must originate from the lender in question. There is accordingly no \ndoubt that GA Machinery, being the party with which Yue Xiang, Ho and Tay \ncontracted, has the standing to bring"}
{"casename":"2020_SGHC_265","fact":"'4\\u2003The present appeals concern one of Singapore\u2019s largest private sector corruption cases to date.

Worse still, Koh estimated that as the industrial flour business flourished, the tax liability on the industrial flour business which fell directly on him and Chia Lee, would increase correspondingly as well. 32', '(c)\\u2003Koh was unable to extricate himself from the scheme, 33', 'even when it became harmful to Chia Lee, and by extension, Koh who depended on it for his livelihood. 34', 'When he voiced his concerns about the scheme, the appellants threatened him with the withdrawal of their support and protection for the edible flour business. 35', 'As a result, Koh felt that he had no choice but to continue his payments to the appellants even when Chia Lee faced grave financial difficulties in 2005. 36', '27\\u2003By June 2005, it was clear to the appellants that Chia Lee was in parlous financial straits. 37', 'On 15 June 2005, the appellants transferred US$240,000 to Chia Lee. 38', 'The payment was meant to keep the struggling Chia Lee afloat so that their corrupt scheme could continue. 39', '28\\u2003Nonetheless, Koh continued to make payments to the appellants up till 26 November 2007. 40', 'After November 2007, the global financial crisis negatively hit the industrial flour industry. 41', 'Koh had no more money to pay the appellants and the profit-sharing arrangement thus came to an end. 42', '29\\u2003The profit-sharing arrangement was discovered by Sojitz Japan around end 2009. 43', 'Subsequently, on 26 February 2010, Sojitz Japan terminated the appellants\u2019 employment. 44', '30\\u2003Chia Lee continued being the sole distributor of edible flour for Nippon Flour Mills until May 2015 when it ceased operations. 45', '31\\u2003In this section, I will explain my decision to amend C21 and C25 and deal with Ishibe\u2019s new argument on appeal that he had only received US$50,000 from the profit-sharing arrangement.', '32\\u2003I begin by laying out how the bribes were quantified.', '33\\u2003The DJ found that the appellants had received payments totalling S$2,051,402 from Koh. This finding was based on photocopies of Koh\u2019s contemporaneous handwritten notes which listed various amounts earned from the distribution of industrial flour and the sums paid to the appellants (Decision at [19]\u2013[25]).', '34\\u2003On appeal, the appellants dispute the exact sums received from Koh on the 28 occasions that gave rise to their respective 28 charges, arguing that the documentary records relied upon by the Prosecution to prove these sums were incomplete and unreliable. 46', '35\\u2003I should explain that the Prosecution framed the 28 charges against each appellant with reference to several photocopied documents and Koh\u2019s evidence. 47', 'The sequence of events as narrated by Koh is as follows: 48', '(a)\\u2003Koh would make contemporaneous handwritten records of the amounts earned from the distribution of the industrial flour (\u201cHandwritten Notes\u201d). These notes included his calculations of the amounts owed to the appellants and the relevant USD\/SGD exchange rates at the various points in time.', '(b)\\u2003Koh would then photocopy the original Handwritten Notes using the \u201cphotocopy function\u201d on his facsimile machine which then printed them out on thermal paper (ie, exhibit P24). I refer to these as the \u201cThermal Paper Records\u201d.', '(c)\\u2003Koh would then hand over the amounts owed to Masui along with the original copy of his Handwritten Notes.', '(d)\\u2003Subsequently further copies were made of these Thermal Paper Records (ie, exhibits P21, P22, P23 and P26). I refer to these as the \u201cPhotocopied Records\u201d.', '36\\u2003Counsel for Masui, Mr Nicolas Tang, embarked upon an extensive and meticulous analysis of the Photocopied Records and argued that they do not prove the amounts of gratification received by the appellants beyond a reasonable doubt. His most convincing reasons were as follows:', '(a)\\u2003The Photocopied Records were not accurate reproductions of the Thermal Paper Records. Pages were missing from the Photocopied Records, which also included additional markings. 49', '(b)\\u2003The Photocopied Records could not be relied upon to prove that the appellants received an aggregate sum of S$2,051,402. Koh testified that he would refer to the invoices from the Singapore Company to Chia Lee to determine the buying price of industrial flour, and to the invoices issued by Chia Lee to the buyer to determine the selling price. While some of the Photocopied Records could be verified by referring to those invoices, not all the relevant invoices had been adduced during the trial. In respect of the Photocopied Records in exhibit P26, there were no invoices nor any calculations for the industrial flour transactions from 25 March 2006 to 26 November 2007. 50', '(c)\\u2003The invoices from Chia Lee and the Singapore Company were unreliable. Koh testified that the invoices from the Singapore Company (ie, to sell Chia Lee the industrial flour) would always be generated earlier than the invoices issued by Chia Lee (ie, to the buyers who purchased the shipment of industrial flour from Chia Lee). 51', 'Koh agreed that the dates on the original handwritten notes would be the dates on which he received payment from Chia Lee\u2019s buyers for the industrial flour. However, the Photocopied Records in P21, P22 and P23 sometimes predated the dates reflected on those invoices. 52', '(d)\\u2003Four of the Photocopied Records were visually unclear. 53', '37\\u2003To corroborate the sums stated in the Photocopied Records, the Prosecution adduced OCBC bank deposit slips to show that Koh deposited sums into Masui\u2019s OCBC bank account, and bank account statements from Chia Lee\u2019s UOB account to show that Koh withdrew sums of cash from Chia Lee\u2019s UOB account to pay Masui. In respect of this, Mr Tang pointed out that the OCBC deposit slips only covered two payments from Koh to Masui on 7 April 2006 and 26 November 2007. 54', '38\\u2003Mr Tang also argued that there were gaps in Koh\u2019s memory as he was also unable to concretely identify which withdrawals from Chia Lee\u2019s UOB bank accounts were for the purpose of paying Masui, as reflected in the Photocopied Records. Koh admitted that he would sometimes withdraw amounts in excess of the sums that had to be paid to Masui for use as petty cash and to pay his workers. He thus could not fully remember the purposes for each withdrawal made. 55', 'It was also strange that Koh testified that the payments which were the subject of C12 to C15 were \u201ccollected by Mr Masui\u201d in cash when Masui was not in Singapore during the relevant period. 56', '39\\u2003In the light of the arguments raised by Mr Tang, I directed the Prosecution to prepare a table of evidence (\u201cTable of Evidence\u201d) and allowed parties to file supplementary submissions in respect of this. Subsequently, the Prosecution filed two further table of profits (\u201cthe Tables of Profits\u201d).', '(a)\\u2003The Table of Evidence summarised the testimonies of Koh, Masui and Ishibe and listed the invoices and OCBC deposit slips which were available to corroborate the stated quantum of gratification in each charge, along with the relevant references to the Records of Appeal.', '(b)\\u2003The first Table of Profits concerned C1 to C18 and provided a breakdown per charge of the amount of gratification that could be corroborated by reference to Chia Lee\u2019s invoices, the Singapore Company\u2019s invoices, both types of invoices and any further additions or deductions that ought to be made to the various sums. This table also included an additional column listing sums for which there was no corroborating documentary evidence.', '(c)\\u2003The second Table of Profits concerned C19 to C28 and listed the amounts stated, the amounts withdrawn from Chia Lee\u2019s bank account or deposited into Masui\u2019s bank account as reflected in the bank statements and Koh\u2019s explanation in respect of each charge.', '40\\u2003On 24 February 2020, after reviewing the parties\u2019 submissions and the available evidence in substantial detail, I found that the Prosecution had proved the amounts of gratification received by the appellants from Koh beyond a reasonable doubt, except for C21 and C25 which were respectively amended to reflect a lower amount of gratification received. 57', 'The appellants did not object to the amendment of C21 and C25.', '41\\u2003I agreed with the DJ that Koh gave a cogent and credible account of how the Handwritten Notes and the Photocopied Records came to be created, which was corroborated by objective evidence. 58', 'Koh was able to explain the process of creating each Handwritten Note (see above at [35]). 59', 'Crucially, Koh was also able to explain the contents within each Handwritten Note as reflected in the Photocopied Records. The Photocopied Records can be split into two groups \u2013 those with calculations in P21, P22 and P23 (which reflected the bribe quanta in C1 to C18) and those without calculations in P26 (which reflected the bribe quanta in C19 to C28).', '42\\u2003First, Koh was able to explain the calculations within each of the Photocopied Records in P21, P22 and P23 in extensive detail. I use the first Photocopied Record (ie, the photocopy of the first Handwritten Note from which the bribe quantum in C1 was derived) as an illustration of this. There were four groups of transactions totaling S$71,773 (ie, the bribe quantum stated in C1). Koh explained that: 60', '43\\u2003The sum of S$71,773 was the bribe quantum reflected in C1. As could be seen from the bolded words, the calculation of this sum was in accordance with the profit-sharing arrangement. The same process was repeated for each of the other 17 charges. 61', 'During cross-examination, Masui agreed that the method of calculation in each Photocopied Record correctly reflected the profit-sharing arrangement between Koh and the appellants. 62', '44\\u2003For C1 to C18, Koh\u2019s testimony and the Photocopied Records could be corroborated partially by a mix of invoices from Chia Lee and the Singapore Company. Using the Table of Evidence, the Prosecution pointed out that a total of 306 transactions made up the 18 payments to the appellants (ie, the first 18 charges). Of these 306 transactions, 83% of them were corroborated by at least one invoice (ie, 255 transactions) and 51% of them were corroborated by both Chia Lee and Singapore Company\u2019s invoices (ie, 155 transactions). 63', 'I agreed with the Prosecution that taken as a whole, there was a high degree of corroboration.', '45\\u2003Second, in respect of the Photocopied Record in P26 (ie, corresponding to C19 to C28), Koh provided a cogent explanation for why there were no calculations but simply a list of sums passed to the Appellants: in June 2005, Chia Lee was facing grave financial difficulties and Koh simply paid the appellants whatever he could afford. 64', 'As recognised by Mr Tang (see above at [37]), two of the sums listed in P26 were corroborated by the OCBC bank deposit slips which showed deposits into Masui\u2019s bank account on 7 April 2006 and 26 November 2007 (exhibit P27). These two deposits of S$13,750 and S$82,900 were the same amounts reflected in the C19 and C28.', '46\\u2003In respect of the Defence\u2019s argument that there were no bank records from Chia Lee prior to 2005, Koh explained that the bank statements might have been thrown away or lost when he shifted his warehouse. 65', 'For C11 to C28 (excluding C19), Chia Lee\u2019s bank records were available and Koh was able to identify various withdrawals which corresponded to some of the payments made to Masui. 66', '47\\u2003While I noted the Defence\u2019s argument that Koh was at times confused and unable to recall details about specific withdrawals in Chia Lee\u2019s bank records, this was unsurprising given the voluminous number of transactions which made up 28 different payments to the appellants and the fact that more than 10 years had passed since the last payment and the first day of trial. Furthermore, as the Prosecution rightly pointed out, Koh did not rely solely on his memory when he identified various withdrawals in the bank statements, but also referred to the exchange rates stated in the bank statements which tallied with what he had recorded in the Handwritten Notes. 67', '48\\u2003Ishibe\u2019s counsel, Mr Sunil Sudheesan, submitted that the charges were not made out because the Prosecution did not adduce a complete set of documents. A complete set would mean: (a) signed invoices from Chia Lee; (b) invoices from the Japan Company; (c) bank records showing the withdrawal of moneys by Koh corresponding to each charge in terms of date and amount; and (d) Photocopied Records or Handwritten Notes with legible writing inclusive of dates that corresponded to the withdrawals and\/or invoices. 68', '49\\u2003I disagreed. The Prosecution must prove the quantum of gratification in each of the 28 charges beyond a reasonable doubt, but this did not mean that the Prosecution had to produce a perfect set of evidence to prove it beyond all doubt. It must be appreciated that the invoices, bank statements and deposit slips served a corroborative purpose. The key evidence relied upon by the Prosecution was the Photocopied Records and Koh\u2019s explanation in respect of them (see above at [35]). 69', '50\\u2003It will be obvious from the foregoing paragraphs that the mix of objective records adduced by the Prosecution was capable of corroborating almost all the values stated in the Photocopied Records such that they collectively strengthened their reliability. 70', '51\\u2003Furthermore, as observed by the DJ, Koh was an honest witness, \u201creadily admitting when he was unable to recall, rather than fudge.\u201d (Decision at [23]). This gave his evidence (which was already corroborated) a ring of truth and reinforced his credibility. In contrast, Masui, the direct recipient of those moneys, was not a credible witness (Decision at [24]\u2013[25]). He feigned ignorance about the amounts received from Koh and claimed that he did not keep records of the payments. He also asserted that he had never seen or received the Handwritten Notes from Koh. When questioned on how he knew that Koh would not short-change the appellants, Masui blithely claimed that he did not check. This seemed illogical in the light of (a) Masui\u2019s concession that it was important to the appellants that Koh was keeping to his part of the agreement, and (b) the appellants\u2019 joint defence at trial that they had taken joint responsibility for the risks of the industrial flour business and would use the payments to them to cover these risks, if needed. 71', '52\\u2003On the whole, I accepted that the Prosecution had proved the values of the bribe quanta in the individual charges (except C21 and C25) beyond a reasonable doubt.', '53\\u2003C21 stated that Masui received S$102,115 from Koh on or about 12 July 2006. 72', 'This sum was reflected as US$65,000 in the Photocopied Record in exhibit P26 (USD\/SGD exchange rate of 1\/1.571 per the Photocopied Record). 73', 'The only corroborative evidence in respect of this was Chia Lee\u2019s bank account statements from which Koh identified four withdrawals totalling S$101,734. 74', 'Koh also stated that he had approximately S$400 on hand which he used to make up the sum of S$102,115. 75', 'However, Chia Lee\u2019s bank account statement stated that one of the four withdrawals was made on 17 July 2006, five days after the purported payment in C21. 76', 'This withdrawal was of US$10,000 (ie, S$15,840). 77', '54\\u2003C25 stated that Koh passed S$137,340 to Masui on or about 15 February 2007. 78', 'This sum was reflected as US$90,000 in the Photocopied Record in exhibit P26 (USD\/SGD exchange rate of 1\/1.576 as stated in the Photocopied Record). 79', 'However, according to the Photocopied Record, the US$90,000 was transferred on 8 February 2007. 80', 'Again, the only corroborative evidence was Chia Lee\u2019s bank account statements from which Koh identified four withdrawals totalling $145,237 and stated that he only paid $137,340 and had either kept the remainder or deposited it in the SGD account for other uses. 81', 'Crucially, the bank statement shows that one of the four withdrawals was made on 13 February 2007, five days after the purported payment in the Photocopied Record. This withdrawal was of US$17,000 (ie, $26,129). 82', '55\\u2003Given that the two abovementioned withdrawals occurred after the date reflected in either the charge or the documentary evidence, I was unable to accept that they should be factored into the gratification sums in the charges. I thus deducted the two withdrawals from the respective gratification quantum in C21 and C25. This gave sums of $86,275 and $111,211 respectively.', '56\\u2003The total gratification quantum was thus reduced from $2,051,402 to $2,009,433. A breakdown of the total gratification quantum is set out at [303] below.', '57\\u2003During the trial, it was common ground between the appellants that Koh always passed the money directly to Masui who would then split it equally with Ishibe.', '58\\u2003On appeal, Ishibe advanced a new position. He claimed that while there was an agreement to split the moneys equally, he had no knowledge of the true sum passed to Masui and had in fact only received US$50,000. 83', 'As proof of this, Ishibe pointed to his long statements given to officers from the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (\u201cCPIB\u201d) on 12 March 2012 and 29 July 2013, and Masui\u2019s statement to CPIB officers on 12 March 2013 that Masui passed \u201c$50,000 to Ishibe\u201d. 84', 'Ishibe added that there was no objective evidence of the exact sum that Ishibe had received from Masui. 85', '59\\u2003I did not accept this argument. During the trial below, the appellants had run their defences on the basis that they had split the moneys equally, as per their agreement. Interestingly, when the sum of US$50,000 was brought up by the Prosecution, this was in the context of exploring inconsistencies between Ishibe\u2019s testimony in court and the version of events given in his CPIB statements. Ishibe\u2019s response was telling and worth reproducing in full: 86', '60\\u2003A few minutes later, Ishibe said that the sum of US$50,000 was a net figure that he was left with after covering the losses from the profit-sharing arrangement, but added that \u201c[i]f you ask me that this amount is [a] hundred per cent correct, I am not confident\u201d. 87', '61\\u2003Furthermore, it was stated in their joint mitigation plea that \u201c[i]t is also undisputed that Ishibe and Masui shared whatever money received from Koh equally with each other\u201d. 88', '62\\u2003In Mohd Suief bin Ismail v Public Prosecutor [2016] 2 SLR 893, the Court of Appeal clarified that an accused person is, strictly speaking, not precluded from relying upon a defence that is raised for the first time on appeal. However, the appellate court will have regard only to the evidence which had been led at the trial itself to ascertain whether that defence was reasonably available on the evidence before the court at the trial (at [25]). Accordingly, the \u201cdefence\u201d that Ishibe only received US$50,000 was not available to Ishibe on appeal as it was unsupported (and in fact, contradicted) by his own testimony and position at trial.', '63\\u2003On the face of the evidence, I found no reason to disagree with the finding of the DJ that the appellants split the bribe moneys equally. I will return to this point later for my decision on the appropriate penalty order.', '64\\u2003The DJ found it appropriate to adopt a sentencing framework for corruption offences under ss 5 and 6 of the PCA (Decision at [81]) and adopted a sentencing band approach modelled after the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in Ng Kean Meng Terence v Public Prosecutor [2017] 2 SLR 449 (\u201cTerence Ng\u201d) (Decision at [85]). This comprised four broad steps (Decision at [86] \u2013 [111]):', '(a)\\u2003Step 1: Identify the significant offence-specific factors, such as the triggering of the public service rationale, premeditation, and abuse of trust and confidence.', '(b)\\u2003Step 2: Classify the offence into one of the four sentencing bands based on the number of significant offence-specific factors present, and their severity, to derive the indicative starting point sentence within the relevant sentencing band. The sentencing bands set out by the DJ were as follows (Decision at [102]):', '(c)\\u2003Step 3: Adjust the indicative starting point sentence to account for offender-specific factors, such as a plea of guilt or criminal antecedents.', '(d)\\u2003Step 4: Adjust the sentence to take into account the totality principle where an offender faced multiple charges, to ensure that the global sentence was not crushing.', '65\\u2003The DJ referred to the decision of Menon CJ in Public Prosecutor v Syed Mostofa Romel [2015] 3 SLR 1166 (\u201cRomel\u201d), which dealt with private sector corruption. By way of background, Menon CJ identified, for the purposes of sentencing, three categories of cases concerning three different ways by which private sector corruption could manifest (at [26]). In the first category, the receiving party confers a benefit on the paying party, without regard to whether the paying party ought properly to have received the benefit. In the second category, the receiving party forbears from doing what he was duty bound to do, and thus confers a benefit on the paying party. In the third category, the receiving party forbears from inflicting harm on the paying party, even though there may be no lawful basis for such harm to be inflicted. This analytical tool devised by Menon CJ is commonly known, and shall be referred to in this judgment, as the \u201cRomel categories\u201d (for further elaboration, see [A.10] below). Consequently, when I am referring to the Romel categories, I will use the terminology \u201cRomel category 1\/2\/3\u201d, as the case may be. The DJ found that the appellant\u2019s conduct fell within Romel category 3 as their corrupt scheme interfered with, and deprived Koh of, his legitimate rights. The DJ identified five offence-specific factors (Decision at [112]\u2013[113]): (a) high quantum of gratification; (b) sustained period of offending; (c) heightened culpability of Masui and Ishibe as the masterminds behind the corrupt transactions; (d) significant abuse of trust and authority; and (e) premeditation.', '66\\u2003The DJ imposed the following starting point sentences (Decision at [121]):', '(a)\\u200312 months\u2019 imprisonment for charges where the amount of gratification was less than $30,000;', '(b)\\u2003at least 12 months\u2019 imprisonment for charges where the amount of gratification ranged from $30,000 to $50,000;', '(c)\\u2003at least 15 months\u2019 imprisonment for charges where the amount of gratification was more than $50,000 to $100,000;', '(d)\\u2003at least 18 months\u2019 imprisonment for charges where the amount of gratification was more than $100,000.', '67\\u2003There were no offender-specific factors which warranted a downward adjustment of the individual starting point sentences (Decision at [122]). After considering the totality principle, the DJ ordered the sentences for four charges C2, C6, C25 and C27 to run consecutively for both appellants, resulting in a sentence of 66 months\u2019 imprisonment (Decision at [127]\u2013[128]). As the total gratification involved was $2,051,402, he also ordered Masui and Ishibe to each pay a penalty of $1,025,701 (in-default six months\u2019 imprisonment) under s 13 of the PCA.'"}

The victim testified that she accepted his offer because it was free, and because the appellant was trained to offer Thai massages and \u201cshould know\u2026the places to avoid on a woman\u2019s body\u201d. 7', '7\\u2003The appellant testified that on the day of the alleged incident, he had told the other students to wait for the victim to arrive as she was late for class. When she reached, they commenced the Muay Thai training. 8', 'He stopped the class for five-minute breaks as he wanted to take smoke breaks. He went down from the Gym which was on the second level to the open area at ground level to smoke, and he testified that the victim also went down to the same area to smoke. They made some small talk, and the victim asked him what the massage bed in the Gym was for. The appellant informed her that it was mainly for sports therapy and \u201cmyofascial\u201d, which according to the appellant, was meant for muscle relaxation. 9', 'The victim then asked whether the table was used for massages, as she was under the impression that the Gym would also offer Thai massages since it was a Muay Thai gym. The appellant testified that he initially stated that the Gym did not offer massages. However, as the Gym had recently opened and he would do anything to obtain more sales, he told the victim that he could try to give her a Thai massage if she really wanted one, but that he was \u201cnot well-trained\u201d and did not have a licence for it. 10', '8\\u2003After class, the victim asked the appellant whether there was any way to cut down fats. The appellant told her that the only method he used was to drink \u2018Kopi-o Kosong\u2019, and offered to make a cup for her, which she accepted. When the other students had left and the victim was drinking her coffee, the appellant asked her whether she still wanted to have a Thai massage. 11', '9\\u2003On the victim\u2019s account, the appellant then told her to go behind the curtain and to take off all her clothes except for her panties and lie face down on the massage table. The victim did as instructed and used a towel to cover her back. 12', 'When the appellant came into the area covered by the curtain, she turned around to check that it was the appellant. He then switched off the lights. 13', 'According to the victim, he rubbed Ginvera olive oil on his hands and started to massage her calf. He then moved to massaging her thigh and then her back. Afterwards, he moved back to massaging her calf, and proceeded to massage her inner thigh area with both hands. 14', 'This made her feel uncomfortable, and she therefore moved her legs to indicate to the appellant that he was \u201cnot supposed to massage that\u201d. The appellant then went back to massaging her calf. 15', 'She testified that the appellant had shifted the towel such that his hands were in direct contact with her skin during the massage. 16', 'At this point, the towel was shifted to the top of her back, 17', 'but was still covering her buttocks. 18', '10\\u2003The appellant then went up to her inner thigh area near her vagina, 19', 'before his finger \u201cwent under [her] panty\u201d and he inserted his finger into her vagina. 20', 'She testified that something was inserted which had the texture of a fingernail. 21', 'When asked to use a ruler to estimate the approximate depth to which he inserted his finger, she estimated 2.5cm. 22', 'According to the victim, it was an \u201cin and out thing\u201d and he put his finger into her vagina for a \u201cfew seconds\u201d 23', 'because she turned and shouted \u201cOi\u201d at him when it happened. He then looked at her with a straight face with a \u201clook that he didn\u2019t did [sic] anything wrong\u201d. 24', 'She testified that she felt \u201cangry\u201d, \u201cupset\u201d and \u201cvery violated\u201d because she had demonstrated trust in the appellant by accepting his offer of a massage but he had broken that trust. 25', '11\\u2003Thereafter, he asked her to flip over, and he continued to massage her shoulder and legs. 26', 'She testified that she did not leave because she was only wearing her panties and she was fearful that if she tried to leave suddenly, he could hit her or rape her. He was a Muay Thai instructor and likely to be stronger than she was. 27', '12\\u2003When the massage ended an hour to an hour and a half later, the appellant walked out of the curtained area. She put on her clothes and went down the staircase to leave. She then discovered that the door was locked from the inside. 28', 'She was able to unlock the door to let herself out. 29', 'She testified that although she did not see the appellant locking the door, he was the only staff member present and the door was locked from the inside. 30', '13\\u2003The appellant admitted to offering the victim a massage but denied sexually assaulting her. On his account, he started the massage from the victim\u2019s shoulder before moving down to her legs. After he told her to flip over, he massaged her front shoulder, her knee area, her thigh and her calf. The massage lasted for about 45 to 50 minutes. Thereafter, she changed back into her clothes, and he asked her whether she would sign up for lessons with the Gym. She said that she would give it a thought and left. 31', '14\\u2003During the cross-examination of the victim, Mr Walter Silvester (\u201cMr Silvester\u201d) was still representing the appellant and had not yet discharged himself. Mr Silvester specifically put to the victim that the appellant \u201c[might] have accidentally touched [her] around the vagina area and when he realised his mistake, he immediately stopped massaging the area\u201d. The victim replied that it was not an accident. 32', 'Mr Silvester later put to the victim that the appellant \u201c[might] have had some accidental contact with [her] vagina but it was a mistake\u201d. The victim responded that if it had been a mistake, the appellant would have apologised. 33', 'Thereafter, Mr Silvester put to the victim that \u201cif there was any contact with [her] private parts, it was \u2026 [an] accident and [she was] actually aware that it may have been an accident\u201d. 34', 'He then put to the victim again that she \u201cdid not tell anyone [about the alleged incident] because at that time [she was] unsure that [it] was actually intentional\u201d and that she \u201cthought it \u2026 could have been an accident\u201d, to which the victim disagreed and confirmed that the act was intentional. 35', 'He subsequently put to the victim again that she \u201cdid not say or do anything [during the massage], because nothing actually happened\u201d, and that \u201c[a]t most, it was an accidental touch \u2026 [b]ecause\u2026it was dark\u201d. 36', 'The appellant\u2019s counsel further put to the victim that \u201cat most, [the appellant] may have accidentally touched [her] vagina area and [she] may have felt it such that it was a bit more forceful that [sic] she thought\u201d, and that it was \u201can accident basically\u201d. 37', 'Finally, it was again put to the victim that \u201cbecause it was slippery, it was oily, [the appellant might] have accidentally touched [her] vagina area, and [she] misconstrued this to be an insertion\u201d, and that \u201cthis was an accident and never intentional\u201d. 38', '15\\u2003However, during the appellant\u2019s evidence-in-chief, when he was no longer represented, he testified that there was \u201cno way\u201d he could have sexually assaulted the victim because \u201cshe was wearing her \u2026 undergarment and plus the \u2026 towel is covered already\u201d. He also testified that he stopped his massage at the lower half of the victim\u2019s thighs. In order to have sexually penetrated her, he would have needed to go nearer to the victim\u2019s inner thighs but he did not do so. 39', '16\\u2003It was undisputed that the victim did not make a police report immediately after the alleged incident. The victim testified that she had intended to make a police report, but that she needed to head home to look after her son who was ill. As she was about to leave the Gym, she checked her phone and noticed that her sister had sent her a WhatsApp message stating that she was taking a long time. She interpreted this message to mean that something was wrong with her son, who had already been having a fever the day before. 40', 'She explained that she did not relate the incident to her family or friends as it was \u201cvery personal\u201d and she \u201c[did not] want to get judged\u201d by them. 41', '17\\u2003It was also undisputed that the victim had sent text messages to the phone operated by the Gym on 2 October 2016 (ie, the day after the alleged incident) at about 11.33am, and that Ms Chan Li Ping, Vivian (\u201cVivian\u201d), who was an instructor and co-owner at the Gym, had responded to the victim\u2019s text messages and told the victim to give her a call.

The appellant said that \u201cafter he conducted the trial, then [the victim] left together with the rest [of the girls who came for the trial]\u201d. Vivian further testified that she decided to make a police report because the company\u2019s image was at stake.

{"casename":"2020_SGHC_268","fact":"Background\n4 Corporation\u2019s main witness at trial was Henry.  Henry held 65% of the \nshares in Corporation while Phang held the remaining 35%.  The company was \nfounded by both men; and Henry testified that they were its only two executive \ndirectors.  The company\u2019s operations were split into two divisions \u2013 medical \nequipment and medical consumables.  Henry took charge of medical equipment \nVersion No 1: 04 Dec 2020 (17:30 hrs)\nBluestone Corp Pte Ltd v Phang Cher Choon[2020] SGHC 268\n3and Phang took charge of medical consumables.

If not \naccepted, we would be free to pursue such interests \nindependently.  We were free to pursue our independent \ninterests in non-related businesses.\n6 Henry claimed that in accordance with these ground rules, when an \nopportunity to market and sell Sonosite machines in Malaysia came up in 2012, \nhe had informed Phang sometime about it3.  These machines were already being \nsold by Corporation in Singapore.  Henry claimed that selling the machines in \nMalaysia would have required Corporation to expand its Malaysian operations \nby setting up a Sendirian Berhad (\u201cSdn Bhd\u201d, the Malaysian equivalent of a \nprivate limited company); and that when Phang showed a lack of interest in \ndoing so, he had \u201cinformed [Phang he] would go ahead to sell Sonosite \n1 [10] and p 85 of Henry\u2019s affidavit of evidence-in-chief (\u201cAEIC\u201d).\n2 [21] of Henry\u2019s AEIC.\n3 [38] of Henry\u2019s AEIC.\nVersion No 1: 04 Dec 2020 (17:30 hrs)\nBluestone Corp Pte Ltd v Phang Cher Choon[2020] SGHC 268\n4machines in Malaysia\u201d but that Phang had not responded.  Henry then proceeded \nto set up a Malaysian-registered company called Absolmed Sdn Bhd \n(\u201cAbsolmed\u201d), which dealt with the distributorship of Sonosite until it closed \nsometime in 2016 or 2017.  It was not disputed that Absolmed was for all intents \nand purposes Henry\u2019s own company, although he did not hold the shares in his \nname, nor did he have himself appointed as director.\n7 As will be seen later, Phang denied that he was informed by Henry about \nhis intention to set up Absolmed to sell Sonosite machines in Malaysia4.\nMedisol Pte Ltd\n8 In March 2006, Corporation set up a company called Medisol Pte Ltd \n(\u201cMedisol\u201d) offering tele-radiology services in Singapore.  Corporation held \n75% of the shares in Medisol, with the remaining shares being held by Henry\u2019s \nfriend, one Ernest Phua Eng Tong (\u201cPhua\u201d), through a company called \nBridgevision Pte Ltd (\u201cBridgevision\u201d)5.  Henry claimed that Phang had refused \nto get involved in the operations of Medisol and that he had left Henry and Phua \nto manage this company. \n9 Medisol was sold to RadLink-Asia Pte Ltd (\u201cRadLink\u201d) in 2017.\nThe Malaysian branch office\n10 On 20 March 2000, Corporation registered a branch office in Malaysia \n(\u201cthe Malaysian branch office\u201d).  As Phang was a Malaysian citizen who spoke \n4 [104]-[108] of Phang\u2019s AEIC.\n5 [35] of Henry\u2019s AEIC.\nVersion No 1: 04 Dec 2020 (17:30 hrs)\nBluestone Corp Pte Ltd v Phang Cher Choon[2020] SGHC 268\n5fluent Malay, it was agreed that he would oversee the Malaysian branch office6.  \nFor the purposes of the trial, it was not disputed that the Malaysian branch office \nis not a Sdn Bhd; and that not being a Sdn Bhd, it cannot accept orders directly \nfrom customers in Malaysia.  However, the circumstances in which the \nMalaysian branch office were set up and the objective behind it were a matter \nof dispute as between Henry and Phang.  According to Henry7: \nThe object of the Malaysian office was to explore business \nopportunities, market [Corporation\u2019s] consumable products, \nand at the same time explore, identify and develop business \nopportunities in Malaysia.  Enquiries from Malaysian \ncustomers through the Malaysian office would be channelled to \n[Corporation\u2019s] Singapore office.

Indeed, as seen \nearlier, he claimed it was this refusal on Phang\u2019s part to contemplate the \nincorporation by Corporation of a Sdn Bhd in Malaysia which had led him to \nset up Absolmed on his own: his story was that when he approached Phang \nabout the idea of incorporating a Sdn Bhd to market Sonosite machines in \nMalaysia, Phang had fobbed him off by saying, \u201c\u2026 We are not ready yet.  \nDifficult lah, difficult.\u201d8\nThe employment of the third defendant, Hooi Loo\n12 A few months after the Malaysian branch office was set up, Hooi Loo \u2013 \na Malaysian citizen \u2013 was hired by Corporation to work in the branch office as \na product specialist.

You will also practice high ethical \nstandards in your daily dealings of company affairs.\nThe breakdown of the relationship between Henry and Phang\n13 Henry testified that he and Phang ran their respective divisions \u2013 medical \nequipment (Henry) and medical consumables (Phang) \u2013 independently of each \nother10.  Moreover, as he found Phang \u201ca forceful personality\u201d, he also sought \nto \u201cminimise conflict\u201d with Phang by \u201cgiv[ing] way\u201d11.  Corporation\u2019s business \nwas doing well and turning a profit every year \u2013 until the year 2016, when the \n10 [22] of Henry\u2019s AEIC.\n11 [24]-[25] of Henry\u2019s AEIC.\nVersion No 1: 04 Dec 2020 (17:30 hrs)\nBluestone Corp Pte Ltd v Phang Cher Choon[2020] SGHC 268\n8relationship between Henry and Phang started to deteriorate for several \nreasons12.  \n14Inter alia, Henry was aggrieved at Phang\u2019s refusal to give a personal \nguarantee to secure certain bank facilities, and at Phang\u2019s decision to declare \nbonuses for himself and his team in early 2017 before the finalisation of \nCorporation\u2019s audited accounts for 2016.  When he learnt that Phang had \nalready encashed his bonus cheques, he took back possession of Corporation\u2019s \ncheque books from Phang13.  Henry\u2019s sense of grievance against Phang was also \nincreased by discovering \u2013 from the accounts forwarded to him by \nCorporation\u2019s bookkeeper, Chong Yok Fong (\u201cYok Fong\u201d) \u2013  that there was \u201ca \nsum of more than S$90,000.00\/RM300,000.00 in the Malaysian [branch] \noffice\u2019s account\u201d.  He felt \u201cdisappointed\u201d that Phang had not taken the initiative \nto transfer this sum to the Singapore office\u2019s account; and in July 2016, he told \nthe latter to transfer S$100,000 from the Malaysian account to Corporation\u2019s \nSingapore bank account14.  These incidents paled in comparison, however, to \nhis discovery of the existence of Healthcare and of Phang\u2019s and Hooi Loo\u2019s \ninvolvement in Healthcare.\n15 In his affidavit of evidence-in-chief (\u201cAEIC\u201d), Henry claimed that he \nhad previously heard some mention of \u201cBluestone Healthcare\u201d from Yok Fong \nand another staff, Phua Peck Sian Jasmine (\u201cJasmine\u201d), but had not inquired \ninto the matter.  According to Henry, he had asked Phang about Healthcare on \n\u201can occasion early on\u201d after Jasmine mentioned to him that \u201cthere was an entity \n12 [43] of Henry\u2019s AEIC.\n13 [43] and [45] of Henry\u2019s AEIC.\n14 [44] of Henry\u2019s AEIC.\nVersion No 1: 04 Dec 2020 (17:30 hrs)\nBluestone Corp Pte Ltd v Phang Cher Choon[2020] SGHC 268\n9bearing the name \u2018Bluestone Healthcare\u2019 in Malaysia\u201d, but when Phang \n\u201cbrushed [him] off\u201d by telling him \u201cyou don\u2019t have to know\u201d,  he had taken \nPhang at his word and asked no further questions15.  As to the fact that \nHealthcare had been mentioned in Corporation\u2019s audited accounts over the \nyears as a related party16, Henry claimed that he had never noticed these \nreferences.  He said that he was out of the office most of the time and had left it \nto Phang to give instructions on the preparation of the accounts17.  He conceded \nthat as Corporation\u2019s director, he had signed off yearly on these accounts, but \nclaimed that he would sign \u201c[a]fter hearing affirmatively from Jasmine or Yok \nFong [that Phang] had seen and signed off on the year-end accounts\u201d18.  He also \nclaimed that he \u201cwas not in the practice\u201d of perusing the accounts unless either \nPhang or Yok Fong brought specific issues to his attention; and neither of them \nhad ever brought to his attention the fact that Healthcare was stated in the \naccounts to be a related party19.  \n16 Henry claimed that he only \u201ccame to know of [Healthcare\u2019s] \nincorporation, [Phang\u2019s] and [Hooi Loo\u2019s] involvement in [Healthcare], on or \nafter 2.2.2018\u201d20 \u2013 after the new auditor he had engaged for Corporation assisted \nhim to carry out some searches in Malaysia.  According to Henry, it was only \nwhen he received the search results from the new auditor that he realised for the \nfirst time that Phang had set up Healthcare in Malaysia \u201cas far back as 2004\u201d, \n15 [53] of Henry\u2019s AEIC\n16 [200] of Henry\u2019s AEIC.\n17 [197] of Henry\u2019s AEIC.\n18 [199] of Henry\u2019s AEIC.\n19 [198] and [201] of Henry\u2019s AEIC.\n20 [47] of Henry\u2019s AEIC.\nVersion No 1: 04 Dec 2020 (17:30 hrs)\nBluestone Corp Pte Ltd v Phang Cher Choon[2020] SGHC 268\n10and that both Phang and Hooi Loo were directors and shareholders of \nHealthcare21.  \n17 On 9 August 2018, Henry visited Kuala Lumpur together with his \nbrother-in-law David Loh Mun Choong (\u201cDavid\u201d), his solicitor Mr Martin De \nCruz (who subsequently had conduct of the proceedings in the present suit), and \na representative from a computer forensics firm.  Henry said he was convinced \nthat Healthcare was indeed carrying out business in Kuala Lumpur after David \nreported to him that the room rented by Corporation\u2019s Malaysian branch office \nwas being occupied by a Healthcare employee and that the \u201coffice block \nbusiness directory disclosed [Healthcare\u2019s] name, but not [Corporation\u2019s]\u201d22. \n18 On 8 August 2018, prior to visiting Kuala Lumpur, Henry had already \nfiled writs of summonses and statements of claim against all three defendants, \nalthough he had yet to serve the papers on them.  At that stage, Phang and \nHealthcare were named as the defendants in the present suit (HC\/S 793\/2018), \nwhile Hooi Loo and Healthcare were named as the defendants in a separate suit \n(HC\/S 794\/2018).  \n19 On 24 August 2018, Henry returned to Kuala Lumpur together with \nDavid, who attended at Corporation\u2019s Malaysian office premises with \nrepresentatives from the computer forensics firm and from Corporation\u2019s \nMalaysian lawyers.  According to David, he had joined Corporation\u2019s \nemployment on 24 August 2018 itself and had been appointed the general \nmanager on the same day23.  David served on Hooi Loo a notice of termination \n21 [52] of Henry\u2019s AEIC.\n22 [55] of Henry\u2019s AEIC.\n23 See transcript of 28 February 2020 at p 4 line 3 and p 5 lines 8-16.\nVersion No 1: 04 Dec 2020 (17:30 hrs)\nBluestone Corp Pte Ltd v Phang Cher Choon[2020] SGHC 268\n11of employment and also extended her a copy of the writ of summons and \nstatement of claim.  Subsequently, Henry met up with Hooi Loo on the same \nday because he wanted to hear from her about her involvement in Healthcare.  \nHenry claimed that he concluded during their meeting that she had acted with \nthe knowledge that \u201cwhat she did was wrong\u201d24.  HC\/S 793\/2018 was \nconsequently amended to add Hooi Loo as the third defendant, so that \nCorporation could proceed against all three defendants in the same suit.\n20 Phang too was served with a notice of termination of employment on \n24 August 2018.  His laptop, mobile phone and thumb-drives were seized from \nhim on that day as these were said to belong to Corporation25.\nPhang\u2019s incorporation of Prius Pte Ltd and Primuz Pte Ltd\n21 Henry alleged that it was also after 6 July 2018 that he discovered \u2013 \nthrough searches done by the company secretary \u2013 that Phang had previously \nincorporated two other companies in Singapore26.  The first was a company \ncalled Prius Pte Ltd (\u201cPrius\u201d) which Phang had incorporated on 18 July 2009.  \nAlthough Prius had subsequently been struck off the Accounting and Corporate \nRegulatory Authority (\u201cACRA\u201d) register in March 2017, Henry said he had \nfound four delivery orders issued by Prius to four entities \u2013 the National \nUniversity of Singapore, Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Impres Trading and Yong Her \nSin Medical Store27; and he contended that \u201c[p]roducts sold or sought to be sold \nby Prius could and should have been sold by [Corporation]\u201d.

Henry did not produce any \ndocumentary records of sales by Primuz, but his contention was that since the \ncompany search on Primuz revealed its principal objects to be \u201ctrading of \nhealthcare equipment\u201d29, it was \u201cin a position to compete with [Corporation] is \n[sic] sales of healthcare equipment\u201d30.  Moreover, Phang had not disclosed to \nHenry or to Corporation his interests in Primuz and in Prius.\n23 I next outline Corporation\u2019s various claims.  With respect, these were \nset out in a rather confusing manner in its amended statement of claim; and the \ncontents of Henry\u2019s AEIC did not always appear to comport with what was \npleaded.  The summary of Corporation\u2019s claims below is gleaned from its \npleadings; and I have also referred to the broad areas or issues on which Henry\u2019s \nevidence appeared to add to or differ from the pleadings.  \nCorporation\u2019s claim against Phang for breach of fiduciary duties\n24 As against Phang, it was asserted31 that he owed \u2013 in his capacity \u201cas a \ndirector and agent of [Corporation]\u201d multiple fiduciary duties, including, inter \nalia \u2013\n28 [59] and [62]-[63] of Henry\u2019s AEIC.\n29 pp 863-864 of Henry\u2019s AEIC.\n30 [65] of Henry\u2019s AEIC.\n31 [6] of Corporation\u2019s Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 2).\nVersion No 1: 04 Dec 2020 (17:30 hrs)\nBluestone Corp Pte Ltd v Phang Cher Choon[2020] SGHC 268\n13(a) a duty to \u201cact bona fide and in good faith in the interest of \n[Corporation] in the discharge of all duties, powers, responsibilities, \nobligations and functions assigned to or vested in or attached to [him] as \na director of [Corporation]\u201d;\n(b) a duty to \u201cserve [Corporation] faithfully and dutifully and not to \nadvance or promote [his] own or other external interests to the prejudice \nof or contrary to or in conflict with the corporate interests of \n[Corporation];\n(c) a duty \u201cnot to place or allow [himself] to be placed in a situation \nor position whereby any of [his] duties and obligations to [Corporation] \nconflicted or may conflict with [his] own personal interests\u201d; and\n(d) a duty not to make secret profits whilst engaged as a director of \nCorporation.\n25 In addition to such fiduciary duties, it was pleaded that Phang owed \nCorporation \u201cobligations under the Companies Act Cap 50, under common law \nand equity, including the duty to exercise reasonable care, to act honestly and \nuse reasonable diligence in the discharge of the office as a director of \n[Corporation]\u201d32.\n26 In gist, Corporation claimed that Phang had breached these duties by \nsetting up Healthcare, Prius and Primuz; by using Hooi Loo\u2019s services as a \ndirector of Healthcare; by causing Healthcare to compete with Corporation\u2019s \n32 [8] of Corporation\u2019s Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 2).\nVersion No 1: 04 Dec 2020 (17:30 hrs)\nBluestone Corp Pte Ltd v Phang Cher Choon[2020] SGHC 268\n14business; and by making \u201csecret profits\u201d from Healthcare\u2019s business33.   Henry\u2019s \nAEIC added the allegation that Phang had been \u201cself-dealing\u201d by arranging for \nHealthcare to sell Coeur products to Corporation at prices which were marked \nup by 15%34.\n27 Corporation contended that \u201c[i]n the premises\u201d, any \u201csecret profits \nand\/or profits made by [Phang] as a result of his breach of fiduciary duties\u201d were \n\u201cheld on a constructive trust for [Corporation]\u201d35.  An \u201caccount\u201d of such profits \nwas sought.  The amended statement of claim did not explain what these \u201csecret \nprofits\u201d might be or how they might have been made.  However, in Henry\u2019s \nAEIC, it was alleged that the \u201cdirectors\u2019 fees and dividends\u201d received by Phang \nand\/or Hooi Loo from Healthcare over the period from 2004 to 2016 constituted \n\u201csecret profits\u201d because they had received these payments \u201csurreptitiously\u201d and \n\u201cunconscionabl[y]\u201d while acting in breach of their \u201cduties of loyalty and fidelity \nto [Corporation]\u201d36.  Henry claimed that as Healthcare\u2019s audited accounts over \nthis period showed that they had together received an aggregate amount of \nRM1,240,000 in directors\u2019 fees and dividends, this was the amount which \nshould be \u201cdisgorged\u201d from them.\n28 Apart from claiming all \u201csecret profits and\/or profits made by [Phang] \nas a result of his breach of fiduciary duties\u201d, Corporation also claimed the \u201cclaw-\nback\u201d of all bonuses paid to him over the period from 2005 to July 2018, on the \ngrounds that it had paid him these bonuses \u201cas a result of a mistake\u201d, in \n33 [25A] of Corporation\u2019s Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 2).\n34 [104] of Henry\u2019s AEIC.\n35 [26] of Corporation\u2019s Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 2).\n36 [165]-[169] of Henry\u2019s AEIC.\nVersion No 1: 04 Dec 2020 (17:30 hrs)\nBluestone Corp Pte Ltd v Phang Cher Choon[2020] SGHC 268\n15circumstances where it \u201cdid not know [he] was engaged as a director of \n[Healthcare], acting for the benefit and interests of [Healthcare]\u201d37.  The \nbonuses to be clawed back were quantified at $675,000 at para 26 and Schedule \n3 of the amended Statement of Claim, but in his AEIC, Henry said that the total \namount of bonuses to be clawed back came to $555,00038.  \n29 In addition, although the recovery of salary payments from Phang was \nnot specifically pleaded in the amended statement of claim, Henry claimed in \nhis AEIC that Corporation was also entitled to damages from Phang \u201cin the form \nof clawback of part of salaries [paid] out to [him], over the period when [he] \nwas a director of [Healthcare]\u201d [emphasis added]39.  The salary payments by \nCorporation to Phang over the period from 2005 to July 2018 totalled \n$1,723,50040.  Henry claimed that Corporation was entitled to claw back \n80.31% of this amount, on the basis that an examination of the WhatsApp \nmessages on Phang\u2019s mobile phone had shown that 80.31% of his messages \nwere with Healthcare employees while 19.69% of his messages were with \nCorporation employees41. \n30 According to Henry, the basis for seeking claw-back of the remuneration \npaid to Phang was as follows42:\nRemuneration to [Phang] \u2026 was paid out as a result of a \nmistake, on the part of [Corporation].  If [Corporation] had \nknown, [Phang] \u2026 breached [his] obligations to [Corporation] \n37 [26] of Corporation\u2019s Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 2).\n38 [180] of Henry\u2019s AEIC.\n39 [178] of Henry\u2019s AEIC.\n40 [175] of Henry\u2019s AEIC.\n41 [174] of Henry\u2019s AEIC.\n42 [190]-[191] of Henry\u2019s AEIC.\nVersion No 1: 04 Dec 2020 (17:30 hrs)\nBluestone Corp Pte Ltd v Phang Cher Choon[2020] SGHC 268\n16(in 2004 \u2026), by acting as [director] in [Healthcare] and \ncompeting with [Corporation\u2019s] interests, [Corporation] would \nhave terminated the employment of [Phang] \u2026 at the material \ntime.\nBut for [Phang\u2019s] \u2026 non-disclosure of interests in [Healthcare], \n[Corporation[ would not have paid to [him] \u2026 remuneration in \nthe sum of S$2,529,785.00 [ie, S$1,723,500 + $555,000] \u2026 \n[Corporation] had suffered a detriment to the extent of at least \nthe sums of S$2,529,785.00 \u2026 caused by [Phang\u2019s] \u2026 breach \nof duties owed to [Corporation].

As to the prayer in relation to piercing of the corporate veil, \nHenry\u2019s AEIC simply stated that Phang was \u201cthe controlling mind of the \nbusiness of [Healthcare]\u201d because of his directorship, his dominant \nshareholding and \u201cthe manner in which [Hooi Loo] reported to [him]\u201d; and that \nit was as a result of his \u201cbreach of fiduciary duties\u201d that Corporation had \n\u201csuffered the losses which arose from the business activities of [Healthcare] in \nMalaysia\u201d44.  Somewhat puzzlingly, the same portion of Henry\u2019s AEIC also \nmade reference to Phang\u2019s majority shareholding and directorship of Prius, as \nwell as the losses allegedly caused to Corporation by the \u201cbusiness activities \u2026 \n43 Prayers (6) and (7) at p 24 of Corporation\u2019s Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 2).\n44 [193]-[194] of Henry\u2019s AEIC.\nVersion No 1: 04 Dec 2020 (17:30 hrs)\nBluestone Corp Pte Ltd v Phang Cher Choon[2020] SGHC 268\n17of Primuz Pte Ltd in Singapore\u201d [emphasis added], without elaborating on how \nthese allegations related to the prayer for piercing of the corporate veil45.   \nCorporation\u2019s claim against Healthcare for \u201cknowing assistance\u201d\n32 It was further pleaded by Corporation that Healthcare had \u201cacted in \ndishonest and\/or knowing assistance\u201d [emphasis added] in relation to Phang\u2019s \nalleged breaches of fiduciary duties46.

This did not have any impact on his decision to go ahead with the purchase because Mr Hau assured him that the plaintiff \u201ccould just look for another tenant\u201d for the third storey. Given this assurance, Mr Lee \u201cwas not too concerned that the [t]hird [s]torey was vacant\u201d. 27', '15\\u2003Almost a year after the OTP was issued, the plaintiff exercised the OTP on 12 February 2016. The first defendant had granted extensions of time to the plaintiff to allow the late exercise of the OTP. 28', 'Mr Lee explained that the long time taken to decide whether to exercise the OTP was because he had never purchased a coffee shop which operated an Indian Muslim eatery. He had long discussions with Mr Hau about the transaction before deciding to go ahead. Mr Hau had persuaded him that it was a good deal. 29', 'The sale of the Property was completed on 12 April 2016. 30', '16\\u2003According to the plaintiff, sometime after exercising the OTP (on 12 February 2016) and before completion on 12 April 2016, Mr Lee met with the third and fourth defendants to discuss the plaintiff\u2019s plans to renovate the Property. Mr Lee explained that he wanted to carry out such renovations because he felt that the building was old. The plaintiff mooted the idea that a rental of about S$45,000 per month would be sought from the tenants after such renovations were complete. However, the fourth defendant did not agree to this proposal. He and his father, the third defendant, in fact wanted a reduction in the rental and saw no need for any renovations to the building. The meeting thus concluded without an agreement being reached. 31', '17\\u2003The parties then met again in September 2016, where the tenants proposed to renew the tenancy, which would expire in May 2017, at a rental of S$12,000 per month.

Accordingly, this second meeting also concluded without any agreement being reached between the parties. 32', '18\\u2003However, what is also notable about this meeting is that the plaintiff alleges in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief that the third defendant had told him that S$12,000 was the \u201cprevious rental\u201d the tenants had paid and that they only agreed to enter into the 2013 Lease and to pay a higher rental of S$30,000 to help the first defendant sell the Property. 33', '19\\u2003Subsequent to the meeting in September 2016, Mr Lee asked Ms Tang Lee Swan (\u201cMs Tang\u201d) to discuss the renewal of the tenancy with the fourth defendant.

The transcript of the Recording (the \u201cTranscript\u201d) captures Mr Clements suggesting to Ms Tang that the rental of the Property was only S$12,000 per month, and that the monthly rental of S$30,000 per month that had been paid by the tenants was merely \u201con paper\u201d to inflate the value of the Property. 38', 'This was done to facilitate the sale of the Property at an inflated price by the first defendant to the plaintiff. 39', 'The plaintiff refers to this revelation as proof of a \u201cconspiracy\u201d between the defendants.', '22\\u2003Upon their discovery of the \u201cconspiracy\u201d, the plaintiff sought legal advice in respect of the defendants\u2019 deceit. 40', '23\\u2003Eventually, the parties could not agree to the revised rental for the renewal of the tenancy of the Property, and the tenants thus vacated the Property in May 2017 upon the expiry of the 2013 Lease. 41', '24\\u2003With Mr Ng having passed on, the first defendant\u2019s only witness was one Ms Chew Kooi Choon (\u201cMs Chew\u201d). She is an administrative staff working for the first defendant. She had assisted Mr Ng in preparing the 2013 Lease. She denied having knowledge of any conspiracy between Mr Ng and the tenants to inflate the rental of the Property in the 2013 Lease. While there was a substantial increase in rent from the previous tenancy agreement of the tenants dated 15 April 2011 (\u201cthe 2011 Lease\u201d), Ms Chew did point out that the 2011 Lease only let the first storey to the tenants, while the 2013 Lease let to them the first and second storeys of the Property. 42', '25\\u2003Through the evidence of the fourth defendant, the second to fourth defendants deny the existence of a conspiracy between themselves and the first defendant. The third defendant did not give evidence. According to the fourth defendant, this was because his father was recuperating from a fall and had a heart problem. 43', '26\\u2003As regards the alleged inflation in the rent, the fourth defendant\u2019s evidence was that the tenants were practically forced to take up the 2013 Lease by Mr Ng at the rent of S$30,000 per month. 44', 'While it was true that the second to fourth defendants wanted to take up a lease of the second storey to house the restaurant\u2019s foreign workers, they baulked at the rental that Mr Ng was demanding for both storeys. However, according to the fourth defendant, they had already by that time incurred significant costs in renovating the premises so that it could operate as a restaurant. 45', 'In this regard, he claimed that about S$250,000 had been spent by them from 2011 to early 2013 to renovate the Property. 46', 'Prior to that, while they had leased the first storey of the Property from the first defendant since 2007, they had sub-let it to a storekeeper. 47', '27\\u2003So, when in 2013, Mr Ng, who controlled the first defendant, threatened to evict them unless they agreed to the terms of the 2013 Lease, they felt that they had little choice. They made a business decision to go ahead with the lease. They felt that the business could still be run profitably. The tenants thus signed the 2013 Lease and honoured its terms until expiry. 48', 'To demonstrate this, the tenants tendered bank account statements showing their due payment of the full S$30,000 rent throughout the duration of the 2013 Lease, both to the first defendant and then later to the plaintiff. 49', '28\\u2003As for the negotiations for the renewal of the tenancy, the fourth defendant\u2019s evidence was that the plaintiff was reluctant to consider retaining the same rent of S$30,000 per month, but instead proposed an increased rent of S$42,000 per month, or S$50,000 per month in the event that the premises were renovated. 50', 'The second to fourth defendants could not meet the plaintiff\u2019s proposal, and instead counter-offered renewal of the tenancy at the rental of S$24,000 per month. 51', 'The reason given was that the business was not doing as well as before. The plaintiff was unwilling to accept the tenants\u2019 counter-offer, leaving the tenants with no choice but to move out. 52', '29\\u2003As for the September 2016 meeting, the fourth defendant denied under cross-examination that his father, the third defendant, had ever said at that meeting that they had only signed the 2013 Lease to help the first defendant sell the Property. 53', '30\\u2003With regard to the March 2017 meeting with Mr Clements and Ms Tang, the fourth defendant\u2019s evidence was that the meeting took place at the restaurant premises and he was on a phone call for several minutes during the course of the discussions. 54', 'As he was on a call, the fourth defendant claimed not to have heard what Mr Clements said to Ms Tang about the 2013 Lease being signed to help the first defendant sell the Property. 55', 'Having since reviewed the Transcript and listened to the Recording, he does not now deny that Mr Clements said what he said to Ms Tang, 56', 'but he completely denies that there was any agreement with the first defendant to enter into a sham lease arrangement. 57', 'Instead, his evidence is that he had been forced by Mr Ng to take up the 2013 Lease at the increased rent, and that he had made a \u201cbusiness decision\u201d to do so in light of, amongst others, the goodwill that had been generated by the restaurant at the Property. 58', '31\\u2003Regardless, the 2013 Lease was never renewed. Thus, on the expiry of the 2013 Lease in May 2017, possession of the first and second storey of the Property was returned to the plaintiff. 59', 'As at the time of the trial, Har Yasin restaurant now operates at 48A Changi Road, 60', 'which is adjacent 61', 'to the Property. The restaurant\u2019s workers are housed at 48C and 48D Changi Road, which are on the upper levels of the property where the restaurant now operates. 62', '32\\u2003After the tenants vacated the Property, the Property remained vacant from 15 May 2017 to 31 July 2017. 63', '33\\u2003Thereafter, from 1 August 2017 to 31 July 2018, the first storey of the Property was leased to a company related to the plaintiff at the rent of S$25,000 per month. 64', 'This figure is higher than the S$24,000 rent per month that the tenants were paying under the 2013 Lease for the first storey.', '34\\u2003The Property was then vacant from 1 August 2018 to 30 September 2018. Subsequently, a new tenant of all three storeys of the Property signed a lease at a rental of S$28,000 per month for a period of two years, commencing on 1 October 2018. 65'"}
{"casename":"2020_SGHC_270","fact":"'2\\u2003As stated, the plaintiff is currently the subject of two criminal investigations (\u201cthe investigations\u201d). The first is conducted by Investigation Officer Desmond Toh (\u201cIO Toh\u201d) of the Commercial Affairs Department (\u201cCAD\u201d) of the Singapore Police Force. It concerns the alleged commission by the plaintiff of the offence of criminal breach of trust under s 409 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (\u201cPenal Code\u201d) (\u201cCAD investigations\u201d). This is because the plaintiff had allegedly misappropriated a sum of S$30,000 which he received from AXA Insurance Pte Ltd (\u201cAXA Insurance\u201d) on behalf of one of his former clients, Mr Suresh Kumar s\/o A Jesupal (\u201cMr Kumar\u201d).', '3\\u2003This sum of S$30,000 was part of a larger sum of S$50,000 which the defendant in DC\/DC 387\/2015 (\u201cDC 387\u201d), Mr Guo Nengqing (\u201cMr Guo\u201d), was ordered to pay Mr Kumar as damages. The plaintiff had represented Mr Kumar as counsel in DC 387, which was a motor accident claim. Mr Kumar had been injured in an accident which was caused entirely by the negligence of Mr Guo. In the course of DC 387, the plaintiff was replaced by Mr Joseph Chen (\u201cMr Chen\u201d), who has his own law firm, as the lawyer for Mr Kumar. Nevertheless, it is said that AXA Insurance, the insurer for Mr Guo, made the payment of the S$30,000 to the plaintiff\u2019s firm even though they were no longer the solicitors on record. Mr Kumar claims that, to date, he has not received this sum of S$30,000 from the plaintiff. Mr Chen then made a complaint to the police, on behalf of Mr Guo, about the alleged criminal breach of trust of the S$30,000 by the plaintiff. 1', '4\\u2003The second investigation is conducted by Investigating Officer Hannah Cheong (\u201cIO Cheong\u201d) of the police\u2019s Central Division regarding alleged unlawful stalking under s 7(1) read with s 7(6) of the Protection from Harassment Act (Cap 256A, 2015 Rev Ed) (\u201cPOHA\u201d) by the plaintiff against his former employee (\u201cPOHA investigations\u201d). The complainant\u2019s allegation is that the plaintiff had invited her for dinner and drinks at his home and persistently addressed her using inappropriate terms such as \u201cdarling\u201d and \u201cbaby\u201d, even after she told him that she felt uncomfortable with this. 2', '5\\u2003On 23 September 2020, IO Toh and IO Cheong made a telephone call to the plaintiff together to inform him that he was required to attend the CAD\u2019s office on 28 September 2020 to answer questions in relation to suspected offences of criminal breach of trust and unlawful stalking. The plaintiff stated that he would be unable to attend any interview until after 9 October 2020. IO Toh informed the plaintiff that he would nevertheless be writing to the plaintiff to require him to attend an interview on 28 September 2020, and that the plaintiff should write in formally if he wished to request to reschedule the interview. Later that day, IO Toh duly wrote to the plaintiff to fix the interview at CAD\u2019s office on 28 September 2020 at 9.00am. 3', '6\\u2003On 27 September 2020, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel (by which I am referring to Mr Ravi s\/o Madasamy) emailed a letter to IO Toh (copying IO Cheong) to state, inter alia, that the plaintiff had \u201cno intention of turning up for any interview\u201d because CAD was \u201cinvestigating trumped up charges against [the plaintiff] which [were] politically motivated\u201d and \u201cin furtherance of the Minister\u2019s political agenda\u201d. 4', 'No mention was made as to why the investigation was said to be \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d, nor was there any mention as to which Minister was being referred to.', '7\\u2003On 28 September 2020, the plaintiff did not attend the CAD\u2019s office for the scheduled interview.

IO Toh replied that afternoon to state that they would respond shortly. 5', '8\\u2003On 30 September 2020, IO Toh received another letter from the plaintiff\u2019s counsel (copying IO Cheong) which complained that Mr Chen, who is Mr Kumar\u2019s present lawyer, had \u201ctrespassed\u201d on the plaintiff\u2019s office and shouted at his staff. 6', '9\\u2003On 1 October 2020, IO Toh sent his response to the plaintiff\u2019s counsel (copying IO Cheong) to clarify that the CAD was investigating an offence under s 409 of the Penal Code, while Central Division was investigating an offence under s 7(1) of the POHA. IO Toh rejected \u201cany assertion that the investigations [were] politically motivated\u201d. IO Toh also noted the plaintiff\u2019s position not to attend any interviews with the police. IO Toh stated that the police have the \u201cresponsibility to investigate\u201d the allegations and will \u201ctake all necessary steps to do so\u201d. 7', '10\\u2003Since the plaintiff, through his counsel, had explicitly stated that he did not intend to turn up for any interviews with the police, the CAD assessed that it was necessary to arrest the plaintiff pursuant to s 64(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (\u201cCPC\u201d). CAD officers duly arrested the plaintiff on 2 October 2020 at around 10.40am at the plaintiff\u2019s office and brought the plaintiff back to the Police Cantonment Complex. IO Toh then attempted to interview the plaintiff regarding the CAD investigations, but the plaintiff did not, according to IO Toh, answer any of his questions. 8', '11\\u2003At about 4.03pm on the same day, IO Toh offered the plaintiff bail at S$30,000 with one surety, on condition that his passport be impounded as part of the bail conditions. The plaintiff agreed to the bail conditions. The plaintiff was also allowed phone calls to make arrangements for a bailor to post bail. IO Toh kept IO Cheong informed of the plaintiff\u2019s arrest. While waiting for the plaintiff\u2019s bailor to arrive, IO Toh left the interview room for IO Cheong to interview the plaintiff regarding the POHA investigations. According to IO Toh and IO Cheong, the plaintiff refused to be interviewed by IO Cheong.', '12\\u2003IO Cheong then served a notice on the plaintiff that stated that he was required to attend the Central Division\u2019s office on 12 October 2020 at 9.00am for an interview in relation to the POHA investigations. According to IO Cheong, the plaintiff said that he would not be attending the interview due to other engagements, but did not elaborate further. IO Cheong then emailed a copy of the notice to the plaintiff, who was released on bail later that day at around 7.16pm. The plaintiff\u2019s bail conditions included the condition that he was to surrender to custody or to make himself available for investigations at the date, time and place appointed for him to do so.

IO Cheong replied on 10 October 2020 with a letter from the police\u2019s Central Division stating that the plaintiff\u2019s interview would be rescheduled to 20 October 2020 at 9.00am. 10', '14\\u2003From 9 to 13 October 2020, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel wrote letters to IO Toh (copying IO Cheong) to state that the arrest of the plaintiff was unlawful and to demand for the names of the CAD officers involved in the arrest. 11', 'On 15 October 2020 at about 10.35am, IO Toh responded to the plaintiff\u2019s counsel to reject as baseless the claim that the plaintiff\u2019s arrest was unlawful and to reject the demand for the names of the CAD officers. IO Toh also stated that the plaintiff and his bailor were required to attend CAD\u2019s office on 16 October 2020 at 10.00am to extend his bail (\u201c15 October letter\u201d): 12', '15\\u2003A short while later at about 10.59am, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel telephoned IO Toh to ask if the plaintiff was going to be interviewed when he reported to the CAD\u2019s office on 16 October 2020. According to IO Toh, after he replied \u201cyes\u201d, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel informed him that he would be taking \u201cnecessary steps\u201d and immediately ended the call.

{"casename":"2020_SGHC_273","fact":"the facts material to such a claim. \n7 The law on pleadings is well-established. The general rule is that parties \nare bound by their pleadings and that the court is precluded from deciding on a \nmatter or cause of action that the parties themselves have decided not to put into \nissue. A departure from this rule is permitted only in limited circumstances, \nwhere no prejudice is caused to the other party in the trial or where it would be \nclearly unjust for the court not to do so (see V Nithia (co-administratrix of the \nestate of Ponnusamy Sivapakiam, deceased) v Buthmanaban s\/o Vaithilingam \nand another [2015] 5 SLR 1422 (\u201cV Nithia\u201d) at [38] and [40]). \n8 These principles are also set out in O 18 r 8 of the Rules of Court \n(Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (\u201cROC\u201d), which provides as follows: \n8.\u2014(1)  A party must in any pleading subsequent to a statement \nof claim plead specifically any matter, for example, \nperformance, release, any relevant statute of limitation, fraud \nor any fact showing illegality \u2014\n(a) which he alleges makes any claim or defence of the \nopposite party not maintainable;\n(b) which, if not specifically pleaded, might take the \nopposite party by surprise; or\n(c) which raises issues of fact not arising out of the \npreceding pleading.\nVersion No 1: 11 Dec 2020 (09:45 hrs)\nTian Kong Buddhist Temple v[2020] SGHC 273\nTuan Kong Beo (Teochew) Temple\n49 Counsel for the respondent, Ms Devi Haridas, argues that the general \nrule in V Nithia does not apply to matters of law, which need not be specifically \npleaded except where they relate to matters such as time bars prescribed by law. \nThus, according to Ms Haridas, it was not necessary for the respondent to plead \nthe doctrine of ostensible authority, provided that the material facts relating to \nsuch a claim were expressly pleaded. \n10 With respect, counsel appears to have confused the concept of pleading \nlaw with the concept of raising a point of law in a pleading. It is trite that the \nlegal conclusions which a party seeks to draw from the facts need not be \nexplicitly pleaded (see MK (Project Management) Ltd v Baker Marine Energy \nPte Ltd [1994] 3 SLR(R) 823 at [26]). Indeed, parties are discouraged from \npleading legal principles at length as this tends to obscure and overcomplicate \nthe matters to which the court must direct its attention. However, if a party \nintends to raise a particular point of law on the facts as pleaded, he ought in my \nview to plead such a point expressly or, at the very least, give the opponent fair \nnotice of the substance of his claim through his pleadings (see V Nithia at [43]\u2013\n[44]). That is part of the purpose underlying the law of pleadings, namely, to \nprevent surprises at trial (see SIC College of Business and Technology Pte Ltd \nv Yeo Poh Siah and others [2016] 2 SLR 118 at [46]). \n11 In the present case, the appellant pleaded, at paragraph 4 of the Defence, \nthat: \n4. \u2026\na) The 2011 Agreement (as defined in the SOC) was not \napproved by the trustees or Board members of the \n[appellant]; \nb) Neither was the [appellant] authorised to represent the \nother 3 organisations, namely, Tien Chow Foo Temple, Swee \nVersion No 1: 11 Dec 2020 (09:45 hrs)\nTian Kong Buddhist Temple v[2020] SGHC 273\nTuan Kong Beo (Teochew) Temple\n5Fah Sirh Temple and Wan Fook Kong Temple, for the \npurpose of entering into the 2011 Agreement; \nc) Due to the above reasons as well as the fact that the Pulau \nTekong Joint Temple, which is not a registered charity \nunlike the [appellant], did not have the funds to pay for the \nrenewal of the lease of [the Premises] in or about September \n2016, the 2011 Agreement is invalid and the parties agree \nthat the 2011 Agreement is invalid. \n12 In my view, this paragraph makes clear that insofar as the validity of the \n2011 Agreement was concerned, the appellant\u2019s case rested on three claims: \n(a) first, that Chin did not have the actual authority to enter into the 2011 \nAgreement on the appellant\u2019s behalf; (b) second, that the appellant was not \nauthorised to represent the other three temples on behalf of whom it had \nallegedly contracted; and (c) third, that the Joint Temple did not have the funds \nto pay for the renewal of the lease of the Premises. \n13 In response to these contentions, the respondent merely pleaded at \nparagraph 3 of its Reply that: \n3. The [respondent] does not plead to Paragraphs 4(a) and 4(b) \nof the Defence and puts the [appellant] to strict proof thereof. \nNotably, there was no indication from this statement, or from the rest of the \nReply, that the respondent intended to rely on the doctrine of ostensible \nauthority to counter the appellant\u2019s challenges to the validity of the 2011 \nAgreement. \n14 I acknowledge that the words \u201costensible authority\u201d or \u201capparent \nauthority\u201d do not have to be specifically pleaded in the Reply so long as the \npleadings as a whole had disclosed the material facts which would have \nsupported such a claim. The disclosure of such facts would, in my view, have \nVersion No 1: 11 Dec 2020 (09:45 hrs)\nTian Kong Buddhist Temple v[2020] SGHC 273\nTuan Kong Beo (Teochew) Temple\n6been sufficient to apprise the appellant of the substance of the respondent\u2019s case, \nand allow it to prepare for trial accordingly. \n15 But this was not the case here. It is trite that in order for the doctrine of \nostensible authority to be invoked, two elements must be present: (a) there must \nbe a representation, made by the principal to the contractor, that the agent has \nthe authority to enter on behalf of the principal into a contract of a kind within \nthe scope of the ostensible authority; and (b) the contractor must rely or act upon \nthe representation when entering into a contract with the agent.

As counsel for the appellant, Mr Lim, points out, the respondent did not \nplead any facts or particulars showing that either of the two elements above \nwere satisfied.  I am therefore unable to agree with Ms Haridas\u2019 submission that \nit had pleaded facts leading to the \u201cinevitable legal inference\u201d that Chin was \ncloaked with ostensible authority. \n16 Moreover, I accept that the respondent\u2019s failure to plead its case has led \nthe appellant to suffer irreparable prejudice in the course of the trial. Owing to \nthe respondent\u2019s actions, the appellant did not have the opportunity to adduce \nor challenge evidence which may have been relevant to the issue of ostensible \nauthority. For example, counsel for the appellant, Mr Lim Chee San, did not \ncross-examine the respondent\u2019s witnesses on the issue of whether they had \nrelied on any specific representation(s), whether by words or conduct, from the \nappellant indicating that Chin had the authority to enter into the 2011 \nAgreement. Instead, the bulk of Mr Lim\u2019s cross-examination focused on other \nissues, such as whether the parties had intended for the 2011 Agreement to be \nVersion No 1: 11 Dec 2020 (09:45 hrs)\nTian Kong Buddhist Temple v[2020] SGHC 273\nTuan Kong Beo (Teochew) Temple\n7of a temporary character. It appears that the issue of ostensible authority was \nonly brought to the appellant\u2019s attention for the first time during Ms Haridas\u2019 \ncross-examination of the respondent\u2019s final witness, Chin, and this took place \nafter the close of the respondent\u2019s case. The appellant was thus unable to mount \na substantive response to the respondent\u2019s arguments on this issue. \n17 For the reasons aforesaid, I disagree with the District Judge\u2019s conclusion \nthat the respondent was entitled to rely on the doctrine of ostensible authority, \neven though I acknowledge that this could potentially have been a strong case \nof ostensible authority \u2014 had that been pleaded. The question arises as to \nwhether I can order a re-trial on the basis that some substantial wrong or \nmiscarriage of justice has taken place. \n18 The High Court\u2019s power to order a new trial on the hearing of any"}

The plaintiff had repeatedly failed to provide information requested by the Architect, and the latter had also never granted the necessary approval as a result.', '10\\u2003There was hence never any offer that had been accepted by either party.

At that point, there was only one outstanding matter of discussion \u2013 whether the down-payment was to be paid upon the signing of the agreement or upon provision of an advance payment bond.

At all material times, Mr Pelletier was and continues to be the sole shareholder of Richard Pelletier Holdings Inc (\u201cRPHI\u201d), a company incorporated in Alberta, Canada.', '3\\u2003In 2014, pursuant to a share purchase agreement (\u201cSPA\u201d), MasTec Inc (\u201cMasTec\u201d), a company incorporated in Florida, acquired a Canadian company, Pacer Construction Holdings Corporation (\u201cPacer\u201d), and its related entities from Mr Pelletier, RPHI and various other sellers (\u201cOther Sellers\u201d). It was alleged that Mr Pelletier was the founder and former CEO of Pacer, and also that RPHI owned 47.09% of the shares in Pacer at the time the SPA was entered into, the remaining shares being owned by the Other Sellers. MasTec paid RPHI C$59,296,699.23 for its shares in Pacer.', '4\\u2003After completion of the sale of Pacer to MasTec, it became apparent that Mr Pelletier had falsely represented the financial condition of Pacer and its related entities and that the purchase price for Pacer would have to be adjusted downwards substantially from what was provided for in the SPA. In addition, there was a breach of a representation in the SPA made jointly or severally by Mr Pelletier and RPHI, and severally (but not jointly) by the Other Sellers, that certain of Pacer\u2019s related entities would not require or were not reasonably likely to require additional funding from Pacer to maintain their current or planned operations (the \u201cNo Additional Funding Representation\u201d). This led to MasTec and Pacer commencing arbitral proceedings against Mr Pelletier RPHI and the Other Sellers in 2016.', '5\\u2003In 2019, three arbitral awards were granted against Mr Pelletier, RPHI, and the Other Sellers. The first and principal award pertained to liability, while the second and third awards were for interest and costs respectively.', '6\\u2003The joint and several liability of Mr Pelletier and RPHI under these awards amounted to C$76,833,744.50. The Other Sellers having paid the amounts they were severally liable for, Mr Pelletier and RPHI remained liable to Pacer in the amount of C$33,556,822.50. The amount remains outstanding, save for a small amount of C$4,037.40.', '7\\u2003Pacer then sought to enforce the arbitral awards through multiple applications in various jurisdictions. An application against Mr Pelletier was taken out in the courts of the Cayman Islands (the \u201cCayman courts\u201d) for recognition of the principal award. An application against Mr Pelletier and RPHI was also taken out in the courts of Alberta for recognition and enforcement of all three awards. Applications were also taken in Alberta to bankrupt RPHI and also in the US District Court for the Southern District of California.', '8\\u2003The efforts to enforce the awards against Mr Pelletier have not been successful because Mr Pelletier claims that he has no assets and is unable to repay his debt despite having received approximately C$59 million, through RPHI, for the sale of Pacer. Specifically, Mr Pelletier claims to have gifted a sum of between C$20 million and C$25 million to the first Defendant to fulfil a promise he made to split the proceeds with her if he sold Pacer (the \u201cOlga Transfer\u201d). This promise was purportedly made a decade prior to the present events.', '9\\u2003The Plaintiff also alleges, based on its own investigations, that Mr Pelletier had subsequently engaged in further suspicious activities. It is alleged that in 2014, Mr Pelletier had incorporated PDP Corporation in the Cayman Islands, with himself as the sole shareholder and director. He also established a trust, STAR Trust, with Butterfield Bank (Cayman) Limited (\u201cButterfield Bank\u201d) as the original trustee. Mr Pelletier then transferred US$4 million to PDP Corporation. Once this was done, Mr Pelletier then transferred his shares in PDP Corporation to Butterfield Bank. It is claimed that PDP Corporation had utilised the US$4 million to purchase a condominium in Grand Cayman.', '10\\u2003That was not the end of it. It is further alleged that Mr Pelletier had then incorporated the second Defendant in the Cayman Islands in August 2015, again with himself as the sole shareholder and director. In a single month, in September 2015, Mr Pelletier then made a series of transfers from bank accounts in his name in Butterfield Bank to bank accounts held by the second Defendant (also with Butterfield Bank). These transfers totalled approximately US$15 million and included:', '(a)\\u2003C$12,798,522.71 transferred on 1 September 2015;', '(b)\\u2003US$4,735,074.03 transferred on 1 September 2015;', '(c)\\u2003US$264,925.97 transferred on 11 September 2015; and', '(d)\\u2003C$1,201,477.29 transferred on 15 September 2015.', '11\\u2003The Olga Transfer, the transfers to PDP Corporation, and the transfers to the second Defendant (collectively, save for the transfer set out in [10(b)], the \u201cDisputed Transfers\u201d) were made in circumstances where Mr Pelletier admits he had dissipated the proceeds from the sale of Pacer.', '12\\u2003In August 2019, Pacer applied to the clerk of the Cayman courts to issue a bankruptcy notice against Mr Pelletier. This notice was issued, allowing Pacer to subsequently commence bankruptcy proceedings. In November 2019, the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands granted an interim bankruptcy order against Mr Pelletier. This order was made absolute in March 2020.', '13\\u2003The Plaintiff, as the trustee-in-bankruptcy of the estate of Mr Pelletier, then commenced proceedings in the Cayman court in January 2020, seeking to set aside the Disputed Transfers that Mr Pelletier had made. The proceedings were made pursuant to s 107(1) of the Cayman Bankruptcy Law. On 8 January 2020, the Plaintiff also obtained a worldwide Mareva injunction against the Defendants, as well as against three other related entities (the \u201cCayman worldwide injunction\u201d). On 13 January 2020, the Cayman worldwide injunction was amended, allowing the Plaintiff to seek a similar order in Singapore.', '14\\u2003On 14 January 2020, the Plaintiff then commenced the present Suit by filing a writ of summons. That writ was accompanied by three ex parte applications, namely:', '(a)\\u2003 HC\/SUM 212\/2020, by which the Plaintiff sought an order for leave to serve the cause papers in the Suit on the Defendants out of jurisdiction and for the requirement for two prior attempts at personal service to be dispensed with (the \u201cLeave Application\u201d);', '(b)\\u2003HC\/SUM 213\/2020, by which the Plaintiff sought a stay of all proceedings in the Suit save for (c) below (the \u201cStay Application\u201d);', '(c)\\u2003HC\/SUM 203\/2020, by which the Plaintiff sought a Mareva injunction in Singapore (the \u201cSingapore Injunction\u201d) against the Defendants to prohibit them from removing from Singapore assets up to the value of CAN$20m (for the first Defendant) and CAN$20,586,000 (for the second Defendant). Those assets included two Singapore bank accounts with LGT Singapore and Global Precious Metals (the \u201cLGT Account\u201d and \u201cGPM Account\u201d respectively).', '15\\u2003I heard the ex parte applications on 16 January 2020 and granted all three applications. The orders of court and cause papers were thereafter served on the Defendants, and the first Defendant filed her first affidavit on 6 February 2020 in compliance with the disclosure requirements of the Singapore Injunction.', '16\\u2003On 21 February 2020, the Defendants filed HC\/SUM 884\/2020 seeking clarification of the Singapore Injunction (the \u201cClarification Application\u201d). In the Defendants\u2019 view, this was necessitated by certain events, which I will elaborate upon further at [98]. I heard the Clarification Application on 20 April 2020 and dismissed it.', '17\\u2003On 29 April 2020, the Defendants then filed HC\/SUM 1859\/2020, seeking leave to appeal against my decision in the Clarification Application (the \u201cLeave to Appeal Application\u201d). On 20 May 2020, the Plaintiff filed HC\/SUM 2041\/2020, seeking an order that the first Defendant, amongst other things, immediately transfer the sums which had been transferred to Priestleys, the Defendants\u2019 Cayman lawyers, back to Singapore for the same to be paid into court (the \u201cApplication to Restore Funds\u201d). I heard the Application to Restore Funds on 19 June 2020, where the parties agreed to the following:', '(a)\\u2003that the Defendants were to provide the Plaintiff with evidence of payments made from the GPM account since the Singapore Injunction was served on 23 January 2020;', '(b)\\u2003that the funds paid from the GPM Account, which had been repatriated to the client account of Shook Lin & Bok LLP (\u201cShook Lin & Bok\u201d), be subjected to the Singapore Injunction; and', '(c)\\u2003that the Defendants would not deal with the funds mentioned above without the Plaintiff\u2019s written agreement or an Order of Court until the discharge of variation of the Singapore Injunction.', 'In the proceedings referred to in [16] and [17] above, the Defendants were represented by Shook Lin & Bok.', '18\\u2003The present application was filed on 9 June 2020. Under this application, in which Mr Harpreet Singh SC and Mr Jordan Tan appeared as instructed counsel, the Defendants seek the following orders:', '(a)\\u2003that the order granting the Leave Application be set aside;', '(b)\\u2003that the Singapore Injunction be discharged; and', '(c)\\u2003an order that the Stay Application be varied to allow the Defendants to apply for orders (a) and (b) above.', '19\\u2003The Defendants make this application, challenging the jurisdiction of the Singapore court. In particular, they argue that the Singapore court has no subject-matter jurisdiction and\/or that it does not have in personam jurisdiction over the Defendants. In the alternative, the Defendants ask that the Singapore Injunction be set aside as the requirements for granting a Mareva injunction have not been satisfied.'"}

At the time, after her creation of a trust in late 2010, Mdm A was experiencing difficulties in transferring her assets out of two bank accounts because various family members had expressed concerns to her bankers that she could possibly be under the undue influence of her daughter and son-in-law. In view of the contents of the letters sent to these bankers, Mdm A was concerned that these family members might commence litigation. As anticipated, on 18 February 2011, two of Mdm A\u2019s sisters (\u201cthe Sisters\u201d) commenced Originating Summons (Family) No 71 of 2011 (\u201cOSF 71\/2011\u201d). OSF 71\/2011 was an application under s 20 of the Mental Capacity Act (Cap 177A, 2010 Rev Ed) for a declaration that Mdm A was unable to make decisions regarding her property and affairs, and for a consequential order that deputies be appointed to make all decisions regarding such matters on her behalf.', '4\\u2003OSF 71\/2011 was heavily contested by Mdm A\u2019s daughter and son-in-law (as the first and second defendants), as well as Mdm A herself (as the third defendant). The case was heard at first instance by a senior district judge of the Subordinate Courts (as the State Courts were then known). Following a 30-day trial, the senior district judge found that Mdm A lacked decision-making capacity. This decision was reversed on appeal by the High Court. Eventually, OSF 71\/2011 culminated in the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in Civil Appeal No 27 of 2014 , reported as Re BKR [2015] 4 SLR 81 (\u201cRe BKR\u201d). The Court of Appeal allowed the Sisters\u2019 appeal and held that Mdm A lacked capacity. Deputies were also appointed to act on her behalf. The first and second defendants were ordered to pay the costs of all proceedings, taxed on an indemnity basis, which included Mdm A\u2019s solicitor-and-client costs. 2', '5\\u2003It is not necessary in these review applications to examine Re BKR in detail. What is pertinent to note at this stage is that the Court of Appeal held that Mdm A lacked decision-making capacity as early as 26 October 2010 when she created a particular trust (Re BKR at [206]\u2013[208]). It follows from this holding that Mdm A would have lacked capacity throughout WP\u2019s retainer from 28 December 2010 to 29 June 2015.', '6\\u2003The complaint that gave rise to these proceedings arose out of the Court of Appeal\u2019s concern first expressed as a direction in November 2015 to Mdm A\u2019s deputies to investigate into the quantum and validity of fees paid to WP. Correspondence between the Court of Appeal and the deputies and WP, which will be detailed below, then followed. Finally on 31 July 2017, the Court of Appeal referred a complaint against the respondent (\u201cthe Complaint\u201d) to the Council of the Law Society (\u201cthe Council\u201d), 3', 'pursuant to s 85(3)(b) of the LPA, which reads:', '7\\u2003The text of the Complaint, as well as the correspondence between the Court of Appeal and the parties leading to the Complaint, will be examined in greater detail below. It suffices to state that one key contention in these review applications concerns the scope of the Complaint.', '8\\u2003After receipt of the Complaint, on 8 November 2017, the Law Society preferred four charges against the respondent. The 1st charge read as follows: 4', '9\\u2003The 2nd and 3rd charges which were initially preferred against the respondent were identically worded to the 1st charge, save that they concerned breaches of rr 35 and 40 of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules (Cap 161, R 1, 2010 Rev Ed) (\u201cPCR 2010\u201d) respectively.', '10\\u2003The 4th charge, in its initial form, read as follows: 5', '11\\u2003At the first pre-hearing conference on 19 February 2018, the disciplinary tribunal (\u201cthe DT\u201d) directed the parties to seek clarification from the Registrar of the Supreme Court (\u201cthe Registrar\u201d) as to the scope of the Complaint. Accordingly, the Law Society wrote to the Registrar on 21 February 2018, seeking clarification as to whether the Complaint is limited to overcharging (ie, the alleged breach of r 38 of PCR 2010), or whether the Complaint included breaches of rr 13, 35 and 40 of PCR 2010 (which were the subject matter of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd charges respectively). 6', 'As for the respondent, counsel for the respondent wrote to the Registrar on 23 February 2018, stating that the respondent \u201c[was] prepared to treat the scope of the Complaint to include whether steps were taken to ascertain [Mdm A\u2019s] capacity to engage [WP], to give instructions in legal proceedings and to incur legal fees\u201d. 7', 'By way of a letter dated 2 March 2018, the Registrar replied that \u201c[i]t [was] for the Law Society, based on the information it [had] received, to frame the Charges to be heard and investigated by the Disciplinary Tribunal\u201d. 8', '12\\u2003Thereafter, at the next pre-hearing conference on 20 April 2018, the DT queried counsel for the Law Society, Mr Jason Lim, on whether the Law Society had a position on whether the scope of the Complaint was confined to overcharging, or included issues concerning Mdm A\u2019s mental capacity. 9', 'Both Mr Lim and counsel for the respondent, Mr Chelva Rajah SC, confirmed that their clients were taking the position that the scope of the Complaint included both elements. The DT recognised that the scope of the Complaint went directly towards their \u201cjurisdiction\u201d, and requested for both parties to confirm their positions in writing. The DT indicated that it would make a \u201cdetermination\u201d after receiving the parties\u2019 views, and not hear the charges which were \u201cexcessive\u201d: 10', '13\\u2003Later during the pre-hearing conference, the President also added: 11', '14\\u2003It is clear from these extracts that the DT took the view that the Complaint was exclusively confined to the issue of overcharging and that issues concerning Mdm A\u2019s mental capacity were not relevant. Yet, it is also evident that the DT recognised that it was the role of the Law Society to frame and proceed with the appropriate charges arising from the Complaint. Although the DT had stated that it would not \u201chear the part that \u2026 [is] excessive\u201d, given the informal nature of pre-hearing conferences, this might not have been their eventual position. This is supported by the Law Society\u2019s letter to the Registrar dated 26 February 2018, where it is stated that \u201cthe [DT] also explained that it would not interfere with the Law Society\u2019s prerogative to frame the Charges or to proceed with the [initial four charges] as stated\u201d. 12', '15\\u2003On 25 April 2018, the respondent informed the DT in writing that he was prepared to treat the scope of the Complaint \u201cas including the question of whether or not steps were taken to ascertain [Mdm A\u2019s] capacity to engage [WP] and give them instructions in legal proceedings\u201d. 13', 'On the same day, the Law Society also informed the DT in writing that it would be proceeding with three amended charges (ie, the 1st, 3rd and 4th charges) and would be withdrawing the 2nd charge. The Law Society was of the view that the scope of the Complaint covered the three amended charges. 14', '16\\u2003The next pre-hearing conference took place on 22 May 2018. Although no transcript was furnished for this conference, a summary of the matters raised and directions given by the DT during this pre-hearing conference is found in a letter by counsel for the respondent dated 22 June 2018 to the DT secretariat. The salient paragraphs read: 15', '17\\u2003It would thus appear that on 22 May 2018, the DT made a determination that the scope of the Complaint pertained solely to overcharging, with the caveat that it was for the Law Society to frame the charges it saw fit. That the DT had made this determination is also supported by Mr K Gopalan\u2019s (the Director of the Conduct Department of the Law Society) affidavit of evidence-in-chief at para 7, which was unchallenged in the proceedings before the DT: 16', '18\\u2003Thereafter, on 18 June 2018, the Law Society preferred a 5th charge against the respondent. In addition, the Law Society, for the second time, sought to further amend the 1st and 3rd charges. The DT rejected these amendments on the basis that they were not within the scope of the Complaint. The proposed amendments to the 1st charge were as follows: 17', '19\\u2003As for the 3rd charge, the proposed amendments were as follows: 18', '20\\u2003On 16 July 2018, the Law Society informed the DT that it would be withdrawing the 1st and 3rd charges, on the ground that the DT had disallowed the amendments to the 1st and 3rd charges. 19', '21\\u2003The Law Society subsequently amended the 4th charge, and proceeded with the 4th and 5th charges, which read in their ultimate form: 20', '22\\u2003The substantive proceedings before the DT took place over five days, between 26 September 2018 and 25 March 2019. 21', 'The DT rendered its determination on 28 May 2019. It appears from the face of the Determination that the DT was only focused on the issue of overcharging without any regard to issues of mental capacity.', '23\\u2003The DT held that the Law Society had not discharged its burden of proving overcharging for both the 4th and 5th charges: the Determination at [48]. Further, as for the 5th charge, the DT was of the view that given that both the first and second defendants in OSF 71\/2011 had agreed to pay WP\u2019s costs at the reduced amount, \u201cit [was] difficult to come to a conclusion that this [was] not a fee that a reasonable practitioner [could] in good faith charge or receive\u201d: the Determination at [54].

{"casename":"2020_SGHC_36","fact":"'46\\u2003TOC contends that the Subject Statement is not a \u201cstatement of fact\u201d under the first limb of s 17(5)(b) of the POFMA because it is neither a fact nor an opinion but rather a report based on hearsay. In TOC\u2019s view, it has never affirmed that the Subject Statement contained statements of facts or that the events described in the Subject Statement took place in fact. Given that the Ministry of Home Affairs has neither responded to TOC\u2019s queries nor engaged in a fact-finding process, TOC concludes that the Subject Statement cannot qualify as a fact. Notably, TOC denies that the Subject Statement is a statement of opinion. Rather, TOC argues that it merely reported in an even-handed way that LFL had made certain allegations. As such, its statements fall into a separate third category of its own, and the reasonable reader would perceive that the Subject Statement is a report based on hearsay and not a fact nor an opinion.', '47\\u2003I am unable to accept TOC\u2019s hearsay argument. TOC makes two critical errors.', '48\\u2003First, TOC mistakenly assumes that it is entitled to introduce a different category of statement that is not a statement of opinion within the meaning of s 17(5)(b). This is incorrect. In the genus of \u201cstatements\u201d there exist only two species for the purposes of s 17 of the POFMA, \u201cfacts\u201d and \u201copinions\u201d. The two options are exhaustive, for Parliament clearly intended that the POFMA distinguish statements of facts that are captured by the Act from \u201c[o]pinions, comments, [and] criticisms, [that] are not covered by the [Act]\u201d: Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (7 May 2019) vol 94 (K Shanmugam, Minister for Law). Inherent in TOC\u2019s characterisation of the Subject Statement as a hearsay statement- is an implicit acceptance that the Subject Statement is a statement of fact that TOC has no personal knowledge about in the legal sense. Notwithstanding that a statement-maker has no personal knowledge about a statement and is thus unable to testify as to its veracity or otherwise, a hearsay statement can still be a statement of fact. This analysis brings TOC within the ambit of s 11(4) of the POFMA, which is the respondent\u2019s case.', '49\\u2003Secondly, TOC wrongly assumes that the determination of a \u201cstatement of fact\u201d as defined in s 2(2)(a) of the POFMA depends on the outcome of a verification procedure or fact-finding exercise. In doing so, TOC conflates two different inquiries. The first inquiry is the fact-or-opinion inquiry under the first limb of s 17(5)(b) of the POFMA. The second inquiry concerns the truth of the statement under the second limb of s 17(5)(b) of the POFMA. Logically, the first inquiry precedes the second. Only after a statement is ascertained to be a fact and not an opinion does one then proceed to determine whether the statement of fact is true. As such, a verification exercise only takes place during the second inquiry to determine whether a \u201cstatement of fact\u201d is true. In contrast, a verification exercise is not necessary for the purposes of the fact-or-opinion inquiry, which tends to focus on the semantics of the subject statement rather than the evidence in support of the statement. Indeed, a statement that is verifiable or capable of being proved is usually a statement of fact, regardless of whether the statement is true or false. As such, an unverified but verifiable report based on hearsay can be a statement of fact.', '50\\u2003I now reproduce the Subject Statement here:', '51\\u2003Applying the \u201creasonable person\u201d test as articulated in s 2(2)(a) of the POFMA, I find that a reasonable person who reads the Subject Statement would regard the statement as a \u201cstatement of fact\u201d. Accordingly, TOC\u2019s basis to set aside the January 2020 CD under the first limb of s 17(5)(b) of the POFMA fails.'"}

First, REC had not disclosed the identities of the placees; second, there was no assurance that these placees would add value to REC that an investor like Yang would, which was Oei\u2019s preference; and third, there did not appear to be a financial need for the Placement Agreement.

Chew said that Oei accused him of issuing the Placement Shares to parties acting in concert with him, which Chew denied. Oei also threatened to cause trouble for Chew if he did not give in to his various demands namely, to issue shares to Yang or to cancel the Placement Agreement.

He also suggested that the Placement Shares should be issued to Yang as a \u201cstrategic investor\u201d. 18', 'Putting aside this divergence in accounts, it is undisputed that the two men were unable to resolve their differences over the Placement Agreement.

He then asked Chew to help him find a buyer. Chew cautioned Oei that it would be difficult to find a buyer at that price, as it was significantly higher than the trading price of about $0.33 per share at the time. 33', 'Chew said that nevertheless, because of their longstanding friendship, he agreed to \u201ctry and help [Oei] find a buyer\u201d within a month. 34', 'Chew suggested a deadline of one month because it was unlikely that the plaintiffs\u2019 shares could be sold if a buyer was not found within that time. Chew said that, Oei then said that he would withdraw the Notice of Requisition.', '16\\u2003Oei\u2019s evidence on this is different. He said that it was Chew who suggested the sale price of $0.44 per share, which reflected the value of REC\u2019s net tangible assets. 35', 'He also undertook to \u201cprocure a buyer to buy [the plaintiffs\u2019] shares. [Chew] said he would be able to complete the sale and purchase \u2026 within one month\u201d. 36', 'When Oei asked whether the transaction could be completed sooner, Chew said he would be more comfortable if he had a month to do so.

Oei informed Tan about the events of the previous evening. Oei\u2019s evidence is that he told Tan that Chew had offered to procure a buyer for the plaintiffs\u2019 shares and the plaintiffs had agreed to withdraw the Notice of Requisition subject to certain conditions. 43', 'Oei said he and Tan had a \u201cgood conversation on how to resolve the issues at hand\u201d. 44', 'It was agreed that Tan was to prepare a draft announcement specifying the plaintiffs\u2019 withdrawal of the Notice of Requisition. According to Oei, this announcement would only be issued after Chew procured a buyer for the plaintiffs\u2019 shares. 45', '19\\u2003Oei had a follow-up meeting with Tan on 19 October 2017 at which Oei proposed to either buy out the Chews\u2019 shares in REC or that he be bought out by Chew. If not, then Chew would have to find a buyer for the plaintiffs\u2019 shares. 46', 'Tan informed Chew of this development via Whatsapp, 47', 'but it appears that no substantive action was taken to address Oei\u2019s new proposals. On 23 October 2017, a draft withdrawal letter and announcement, prepared by Allen & Gledhill LLP, was circulated by Tan to REC\u2019s other independent directors. 48', 'The approved drafts were then shown to Oei for his approval on 25 October 2017.

However, Oei made it clear that he would not accept RMB.

But the \nchoice of advancing further sums to the defendant had nothing to do with the \nparties\u2019 rights and obligations under the Agreement. The advances took place \nentirely outside the contractual context of the Agreement. Making those \nadvances could in no way be the second plaintiff\u2019s exercise of a contractual right \nunder the Agreement.

I accept the second \nplaintiff\u2019s evidence that the reason for the plaintiffs\u2019 later advances to the \ndefendant was because they took a calculated risk that those advances would \nenhance their prospects of recovering the $375,000. The advances are not an \nindication, let alone a clear and unequivocal one, that they waived the right to \nrecover the $375,000.\n16 Ultimately, the defendant\u2019s bare assertions that the plaintiffs \u201cwere not \nconcerned with the sum of $375,000\u201d12 or that they were \u201cno longer interested \nin the advance of $375,000.00 since there was no money left in [INS]\u201d13 are \ninsufficient to engage the doctrine of waiver by election.

The defendant failed to transfer 10% of INS\u2019s \nshares to the second plaintiff by 24 April 2011. The defendant was therefore in \nbreach of clause (c) of the Agreement. The second plaintiff\u2019s cause of action for \na breach of contract accrued on 24 April 2011. The second plaintiff commenced \nthis action on 11 April 2018, more than six years after the cause of action \naccrued. Mr Wijaya therefore argues that the action is prima facie time-barred \nunder s 6(1)(a) of the Limitation Act (Cap 163, 1996 Rev Ed). \n18 Mr Padman argues that the defendant made later payments which \nconstitute part-payments resulting in a fresh accrual of a cause of action under \ns 26(2) of the Limitation Act. This argument is misconceived in so far as it \nrelates to a claim in damages. Section 26(2) applies only to \u201ca cause of action \n\u2026 to recover any debt or other liquidated pecuniary claim\u201d. A claim in damages \nis not a claim to recover a debt or other liquidated pecuniary claim. Section \n26(2) cannot assist the second plaintiff on his claim in damages. \n19 The second plaintiff\u2019s claim in damages for a breach of the Agreement \nis not only prima facie time barred but is in fact time-barred. \n20 At this point, I observe that I find that the second plaintiff has suffered \nno recoverable loss by reason of the defendant\u2019s breach of contract. This is not \na reason for dismissing the second plaintiff\u2019s claim. This finding \u2013 if the second \nplaintiff\u2019s claim in damages were not time-barred \u2013 would entitle the second \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLoh Chiang Tien v Saman Dharmatilleke  [2020] SGHC 45\n8plaintiff to enter judgment against the defendant but limited to nominal \ndamages. I make this point because it demonstrates the commercial \npointlessness of the second plaintiff\u2019s claim. \n21 Mr Padman submits that the second plaintiff has suffered loss and \ndamage quantified at $375,000 as a result of the defendant\u2019s breach.  I do not \naccept that he has.\n22 The prima facie measure of damages in contract is as follows: \u201cwhere a \nparty sustains a loss by reason of a breach of contract, he is, so far as money can \ndo it, to be placed in the same situation, with respect to damages, as if the \ncontract had been performed\u201d (Robinson v Hartman (1848) 1 Exch 850 at 855). \nWhere a promisor\u2019s breach has caused the promisee to lose something that the \npromisee would have gained but for the breach, the promisee\u2019s loss is prima \nfacie the value of the benefit that the promisor failed to deliver or provide. This \nis known as the promisee\u2019s expectation loss. \n23  In this case, if the defendant had transferred 10% of INS to the second \nplaintiff in compliance with the Agreement on or before 24 April 2011, the \nAgreement would have become an executed contract. However, soon after, the \nOrder of Court would have cancelled the shares and the sale to the second \nplaintiff entirely. In effect, the position the second plaintiff would be in if the \nAgreement had been performed would have been to have his bargained-for \nbenefit nullified by court order. \n24 Moreover, even if the transfer had not been nullified, the INS shares \nwould also have soon after become worthless. INS went into insolvent \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLoh Chiang Tien v Saman Dharmatilleke  [2020] SGHC 45\n9liquidation in February 2013.14 The second plaintiff has led no evidence on \nwhich I can assess the value of INS shares on 24 April 2011, the date of the \nbreach, or at any point after that date until February 2013, by which time it was \nmanifest that the shares were worthless. If it had been necessary to make a \nfinding on the value of the INS shares as at 24 April 2011, in the absence of any \nevidence from the second plaintiff to the contrary, my finding would be that \nthey were already by then worthless because of the financial difficulties that \nINS was facing and the internal shareholder conflict which afflicted the \ncompany. On that basis, under the expectation loss metric, the second plaintiff \nwould recover nothing at all. \n25 The alternative measure of damages in contract is the promisee\u2019s \nreliance loss. A claim for reliance loss allows a promisee to recover from the \npromisor the costs and expenses which the promisee incurred in reliance on the \npromisor\u2019s performing his obligations under the contract, where such costs and \nexpenses are then wasted by the promisor\u2019s breach. A promisee cannot, \nhowever, elect reliance loss as the measure of its damages if it has made a bad \nbargain (C & P Haulage v Middleton [1983] 1 WLR 1461). The burden is on \nthe promisor to prove that the bargain was a bad one (Commonwealth Bank of \nAustralia v Amann Aviation Pty Ltd (1991) 17 CLR 64).\n26 As the learned authors of The Law of Contract in Singapore (Andrew \nPhang Boon Leong gen ed) (Academy Publishing, 2012) (\u201cThe Law of Contract \nin Singapore\u201d) explain at para 21.052, this limitation on the recovery of reliance \nloss is to prevent overcompensating promisees. A promisee who has made a bad \nbargain would not have recovered its reliance expenditure in full even if the \npromisor had performed its obligations under the contract. When the contract is \n14 Notes of Evidence, 30 October 2019 at p 7(10) to 7(27); First Plaintiff\u2019s Affidavit of \nEvidence in Chief at para 11.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLoh Chiang Tien v Saman Dharmatilleke  [2020] SGHC 45\n10breached, to compensate that promisee by an award of its reliance loss would \nput the promisee in a position better than it would have been in had the contract \nbeen performed.\n27 Undoubtedly, the second plaintiff could frame his claim in damages for \nbreach of contract as a claim for his reliance loss in the alternative to his claim \nfor expectation loss. That would be a claim to recover the amount of money \nwhich the second plaintiff paid to the defendant under the Agreement, ie \n$375,000. However, as the second plaintiff made a bad bargain, in that he agreed \nto lend $375,000 in exchange for what I have found to be worthless shares on \n24 April 2011, the second plaintiff is unable to recover the $375,000 in damages \nas reliance loss either. \n28 In any event, this analysis is unnecessary for my decision."}

The other items comprised, inter alia, individual gifts from the plaintiff, the defendant and Eric to Mdm Seah, and certain gold items that she had purchased herself. It appeared that the other items had been distributed amongst the plaintiff, the defendant and Eric sometime on or about 14 or 15 July 2009 at a meeting at the Mandarin Hotel.', '7\\u2003On or about 23 June 2009, shortly after Mdm Seah passed away, the plaintiff and Eric emptied the First Box of its contents and brought them to DBS Bank, Siglap Branch (\u201cthe Siglap Branch\u201d). There, a new safe deposit box was opened in the plaintiff\u2019s sole name (\u201cthe Second Box\u201d). The plaintiff deposited the contents of the First Box in the Second Box.

I address this below.', '9\\u2003The parties\u2019 stories diverged with respect to the precise circumstances surrounding the visit to Lim.

There, the other items were divided amongst themselves. The items that had been gifted to Mdm Seah by the plaintiff, defendant and Eric were returned to the respective donors whilst the gold items were distributed amongst them in an agreed proportion.

The defendant never informed the plaintiff of this.', '11\\u2003The defendant did not dispute the events of 14 July 2009 in so far as they relate to the distribution of the other items at the meeting at the Mandarin Hotel. The defendant also accepted that she was added as an account holder to the Second Box on 15 July 2009.

Prior to this meeting, the plaintiff had met Lim alone at the latter\u2019s office and asked him to prepare the inventory of the disputed items \u2013 neither the defendant nor Eric were present at this meeting. The defendant and Eric arrived at Lim\u2019s office only after the preparation of the inventory.

These were set out in the S 178 CA Judgment at [11]\u2013[12] as follows:', '9\\u2003The main rift in the family arose as a result of a breakdown in relationship between two factions sometime in August 2011. 5', 'This was between Ernest and Edward De La Sala (\u201cEdward\u201d), Christina De La Sala (\u201cChristina\u201d) and James, collectively known as \u201cECJ\u201d.', '10\\u2003Between 2004 and 2011, ECJ had actively been managing the assets held by the Plaintiff Companies, under the direction of Ernest, as it was time for the next generation to \u201ctake on the baton\u201d to run the family business. 6', 'The relationship between ECJ and Ernest took a nose dive in August 2011, when Ernest instructed ECJ to remit all US dollar deposits held in Singapore to CFC\u2019s account with UBS Bank (Canada) Vancouver, which was under Ernest\u2019s control. 7', 'Although ECJ were puzzled at these instructions, which left no funds for them to manage in Singapore, Edward testified that they complied as they trusted Ernest and were \u201cgenerally deferential\u201d to him. 8', 'However, Ernest then informed ECJ that they were placed on \u201cpermanent holiday, [and that] he had made a burden for himself (in reference to [ECJ])\u201d. 9', 'It was also at this point that Ernest alleged that the Plaintiff Companies\u2019 assets belonged to him. 10', 'This allegation spurred ECJ to pass resolutions on 8 August 2011 to limit Ernest\u2019s authority to operate as sole signatory for the accounts of PAL, CFC and DOM with UBS Bank (Canada) Vancouver. 11', 'The effect of these resolutions sent Ernest into a rage, who then complained to Isabel who in turn contacted Edward and Christina\u2019s father, Robert Perez De La Sala (\u201cBobby\u201d). Eventually, after Isabel had spoken to Bobby, ECJ relented and reversed their earlier resolutions. 12', '11\\u2003Subsequently, in an email marked \u201clo siento mucho\u201d (translated to mean \u201cI\u2019m very sorry\u201d in Spanish), 13', 'Edward apologised to Ernest for the role that he had played in passing the resolutions, 14', 'but Ernest did not respond. ECJ then collectively emailed Ernest to apologise. 15', 'This also elicited no reply from Ernest. However, ECJ received, inter alia, an email from Isabel via Bobby, berating them for their actions. 16', 'Over the next few months, ECJ discovered that Ernest had been transferring assets from the various family companies to his UBS Bank (Canada) personal account (the \u201cPersonal UBS Account\u201d). These were done without the knowledge of the respective board of directors of the Plaintiff Companies, much less approval. Moreover, Ernest continued to remain silent when ECJ queried him about the assets that were transferred to his Personal UBS Account. However, by then, Ernest had already transferred assets worth a total of CAD 663,033,557.61 (at the material time) into his Personal UBS Account. On 5 March 2012, the Plaintiff Companies eventually commenced S 178 in order to recover the assets from Ernest.', '12\\u2003The legal basis for the Plaintiff Companies\u2019 claim in S 178 was essentially that Ernest had breached his fiduciary duties as a director of the Plaintiff Companies by transferring the assets of the Plaintiff Companies into his Personal UBS Account without notifying or seeking the approval of the respective boards of the Plaintiff Companies. There were three main grounds of the claim, namely:', '(a)\\u2003Ernest instructed UBS (Singapore) to transfer approximately S$1,244,308.90 out of JMM\u2019s UBS account to himself, and thereafter to close the JMM UBS account.', '(b)\\u2003Ernest instructed UBS (Singapore) to close the UBS accounts belonging to PAL and CFC, with the balance sums in these accounts likely diverted to Ernest or applied for his benefit.', '(c)\\u2003Ernest diverted to himself, and applied for his own benefit, shares in SMC that belonged beneficially to PEN, and legally to James and Edward.', '13\\u2003On these bases, the Plaintiff Companies sought, inter alia, a declaration that the assets listed in the Schedule of Statement of Claim belonged \u201cbeneficially and absolutely to the [Plaintiff Companies]\u201d (as found in the S 178 HC Judgment at [38]). These assets were valued at CAD 663,033,557.61 as at August 2011. 17', 'Crucially, the Plaintiff Companies also sought orders for Ernest to account for the assets that were disposed by him, and also to account for the assets formerly standing to the credit of the JMM, PAL and CFC UBS accounts.', '14\\u2003Ernest\u2019s defence in S 178 was essentially a denial of any breaches of director\u2019s duties. He alleged that all the money transfers from the Plaintiff Companies were legitimate as the Plaintiff Companies were his \u201cpersonal investment holding companies used\u2026to hold and invest his personal funds and assets\u201d (as summarised in the S 178 HC Judgment at [39]).', '15\\u2003In Ernest\u2019s counterclaims against the Plaintiff Companies and ECJ, he alleged that ECJ were in breach of trust and their fiduciary duties as they had failed to comply with his instructions in managing his personal assets that were held by the Plaintiff Companies. He also alleged that ECJ had knowingly assisted the Plaintiff Companies in breach of trust by instituting S 178 and the related applications. Ernest further claimed that ECJ was engaged in a conspiracy to injure him by lawful and unlawful means.', '16\\u2003Thus, Ernest sought, inter alia, declarations that he was the sole beneficial shareholder of the Plaintiff Companies (in the alternative, of PAL, CFC and PEN), and that the Plaintiff Companies\u2019 assets were beneficially owned by him and held on trust solely for him.', '17\\u2003The CA and the Singapore High Court (\u201cHC\u201d) in S 178 dealt with an extensive number of issues (both factual and legal). However, only some findings are material to the instant case either directly or by way of context.', '18\\u2003Firstly, the central plank in S 178 was to ascertain the owner of the assets that Ernest had removed from the Plaintiff Companies. The CA in S 178 found that the moneys and assets that went into the Personal UBS Account did not belong to him. This was clearly expressed in the S 178 CA Judgment at [116]:', '19\\u2003Secondly, the CA\u2019s finding that Ernest was not the beneficial owner of the Plaintiff Companies\u2019 assets meant that he was in breach of fiduciary duties by dealing with the assets in the manner as listed above at [12]. The corollary is that Ernest was required to disclose to the Plaintiff Companies all correspondences with the banks relating to the relevant bank accounts and account to the relevant Plaintiff Companies the assets that were removed by Ernest, including what had become of the same, what interest had been earned thereon and what profits had been made from these assets. He was also required to return the same to the Plaintiff Companies (S 178 CA Judgment at [155] and [231]). An Order of Court dated 22 March 2018 was issued, requiring him to account to the Plaintiff Companies (the \u201cAccounting Order\u201d).', '20\\u2003Thirdly, as a result of the above, Ernest\u2019s counterclaims against ECJ failed. As stated in the S 178 CA Judgment at [159]: \u201c[t]he lynchpin of Ernest\u2019s claims against ECJ is his ownership of the Companies\u2019 shares and\/or assets. Without that, the factual basis for a fiduciary relationship falls away.\u201d', '21\\u2003Finally, in the course of the proceedings, Loh J made certain findings and observations regarding the credibility of various witnesses in S 178. This included Ernest, Isabel, James, amongst others, and his observations were affirmed in the S 178 CA Judgment. I shall make references to these comments in this case at appropriate junctures.', '22\\u2003Following the S 178 CA Judgment, the Plaintiff Companies wasted no time and, in a series of letters all dated 29 March 2018, informed Isabel of the CA\u2019s findings that Ernest had breached his fiduciary duties as director of the Plaintiff Companies. 18', 'At the same time, the Plaintiff Companies, relying on the findings of the CA in S 178, requested Isabel to return the sum of US$2.75m that was transferred to her by Ernest in breach of his fiduciary duties as director of the Plaintiff Companies.', '23\\u2003In S 178, Isabel had initially testified that she had not received any money from Ernest after 2005. However, she subsequently conceded that she had received a sum of approximately $14m that was related to a property transaction (see the S 178 HC Judgment at [239]\u2013[246]). However, this was proven to be a prevarication by subsequent discovery, as stated in the S 178 HC Judgment at [247]:', '24\\u2003It is notable that, as stated above in the S 178 HC Judgment at [247(a)], Ernest had attempted to transfer US$50m to Isabel on 6 March 2012. On the very same day, the Plaintiff Companies filed an interim injunction against him. This was one day after S 178 had commenced. As explained by the Plaintiff Companies\u2019 counsel, this attempted transfer had failed to go through only because of banking issues, the large sum of US$50m might also have caused certain \u201cred flags\u201d to be raised. 19', 'When this transfer failed, Ernest decided to transfer relatively smaller sums to Isabel and these successfully went through.', '25\\u2003The sum of US$2.75m is the subject matter of this suit. It is derived from an aggregate of the five transfers from Ernest to Isabel listed in the S 178 HC Judgment from [247(b)] to [247(f)]. When Isabel failed to pay, the Plaintiff Companies commenced the current action against her.', '26\\u2003On 31 July 2018, Ernest filed an affidavit (\u201cErnest\u2019s Accounting Affidavit\u201d) to comply with the Accounting Order. 20', 'In it, Ernest revealed transactions involving two personal accounts namely, the Personal UBS Account and the account with UBS AG (Singapore). Given that the Plaintiff Companies base their claim in the current action on the Personal UBS Account, I shall focus solely on the transactions processed therein.', '27\\u2003The sums and transactions in the Personal UBS Account, as detailed in Ernest\u2019s Accounting Affidavit, 21', 'may be broadly categorised into seven categories:', '(a)\\u2003As at 1 July 2011, there were assets valued at CAD 4,035,697.02 (\u201cCAD 4m\u201d) standing to the credit of Ernest\u2019s Personal UBS Account.', '(b)\\u2003In August 2011, assets valued at CAD 663,033,557.61 were transferred into the Personal UBS Account. These assets, as mentioned above at [19], were those that Ernest had transferred from the Plaintiff Companies to himself in breach of his fiduciary duties.', '(c)\\u2003A total sum of CAD 227,795,690.00 was withdrawn from the Personal UBS Account and transferred to the stake-holding account in JMM\u2019s name with Credit Suisse bank. This was the aggregate sum of a series of transactions to satisfy various court orders, which are as follows:', '(d)\\u2003On 28 February 2017, a sum of CAD 236,980.00 was withdrawn from the Personal UBS Account and transferred to Rajah & Tann LLP. This was the deposit for the transferee\u2019s engagement to act on behalf of the Plaintiff Companies.', '(e)\\u2003Between 29 July 2011 and 30 June 2018, a total sum of CAD 28,564,674.63 was withdrawn from the Personal UBS Account for Ernest\u2019s personal and legal expenses which included the US$2.75m. He had further annexed a table of withdrawals, which will be further elaborated on below (at [56]\u2013[60]).', '(f)\\u2003From 23 February 2012 to 7 June 2017, a total sum of CAD 109,813.53 was withdrawn from the Personal UBS Account allegedly for various expenses relating to the Plaintiff Companies.', '(g)\\u2003From 17 October 2011 to 30 April 2018, a total sum of CAD 1,637,520.78 was withdrawn from the Personal UBS Account allegedly for safekeeping fees for precious metals held in the custody of UBS Bank (Canada).'"}

The documentary evidence shows that the downpayment for the Jurong West flat was made by the plaintiff\u2019s late wife. It is not in dispute that the monthly instalment payments were made by VC using funds from his Central Provident Fund (\u201cCPF\u201d) account. The Jurong West flat was registered only in the names of the plaintiff\u2019s late wife and VC. On her passing, VC became the sole registered owner of the Jurong West flat. The Jurong West flat and the dispute in relation to its ownership became enmeshed with the main dispute, as I outline below.', '9\\u2003According to the plaintiff, in 1995 or 1996, he was approached by the first defendant on two separate occasions, less than six months apart, to invest money in York. He gave the first defendant S$20,000 on the first occasion and S$25,000 on the second occasion, both times in cash. He claimed that the agreement with the first defendant was for him to have a \u201cslightly more than 6%\u201d shareholding in York, which would be held by the first defendant on trust for him.', '10\\u2003This account is disputed by the first defendant and LT. The first defendant\u2019s evidence was that, in 1997, an opportunity arose for him to buy over one of his fellow shareholder\u2019s 51% stake in York. However, he did not have the funds even after selling his flat at Pasir Ris. He and LT decided to approach LT\u2019s siblings to borrow money. He and LT gave evidence that they approached the plaintiff on one occasion and borrowed about S$45,000 from him. The agreement was that the plaintiff was to receive interest payments until he asked for the return of the principal amount. The amount of interest was left to the first defendant to decide.', '11\\u2003What is not in dispute is that, from 1997, the plaintiff started receiving monthly payments for his alleged \u201cinvestment\u201d. At that time, VC had already been working in York for a few years. From sometime in 1997 or 1998, after the alleged \u2018investment\u2019, VC would pass the plaintiff S$720 every month in cash. According to VC, the first defendant had initially passed him cash and asked him to pass the cash on to his father. This was for convenience because VC lived at the Jurong West flat with the plaintiff. Thereafter, VC was informed by the first defendant that his salary from York would be increased to include the monthly interest that was due to the plaintiff. He was to withdraw S$720 in cash and pass it to the plaintiff. The first defendant told VC that this was the monthly interest that was owed to the plaintiff for a loan.', '12\\u2003VC left York in 1998 to set up a business of his own. According to the first defendant, York continued to pay a \u201csalary\u201d to VC, of which S$720 was for VC to hand over to the plaintiff. Sometimes, the first defendant would pass cash directly to the plaintiff when he visited the Jurong West flat.', '13\\u2003When VC rejoined York in 1999, the practice continued of the plaintiff\u2019s monthly payments being credited together with VC\u2019s salary. He would dutifully withdraw S$720 every month and hand the cash to his father.', '14\\u2003VC left York in 2001, returned for a short while, and then left the company again in 2002. Despite no longer being an employee of York, VC\u2019s account continued to be credited with a \u201csalary\u201d every month that included S$720, as above, which sum he duly withdrew in cash and handed over to the plaintiff. This practice continued until the end of 2011. Throughout this period, according to VC, when he handed over the cash to the plaintiff, he would tell his father that the moneys came from the first defendant.', '15\\u2003The plaintiff disputes VC\u2019s account of the monthly payments from 1997 to 2011 in three main respects. First, he denies that VC told him the cash payments were from the first defendant. Instead, he claims that VC had told him that the money was from York. Second, he recalls that the cash payments were about S$600 to S$700, instead of S$720. Third, the plaintiff claims that after initially receiving payments for about three years from 1997, there followed a period of about five to six years where he did not receive any payments at all.', '16\\u2003From January 2012 to July 2014, the plaintiff received about S$1,030 monthly from his younger brother, NK. The cash was handed to him each time in a sealed envelope. According to the plaintiff, NK told him that the moneys came from York. NK\u2019s evidence, on the other hand, was that he told the plaintiff each time when he handed the moneys over that these were interest payments from the first defendant.', '17\\u2003Then, for a period of about a year from August 2014 to September 2015, monthly cheques from York in the amount of S$1,039 were made out to the plaintiff and banked directly into his UOB account. Thereafter, VC re-joined York in October 2015 and the practice vis-\u00e0-vis payments to the plaintiff reverted to the earlier arrangement: VC would hand around S$1,000 in cash every month to the plaintiff. This went on until July 2017, when the payments stopped. This was because, by that time, the plaintiff was no longer on speaking terms with the first defendant. How that transpired will be explained below.', '18\\u2003VC married for the third time in 2014. He wanted to add his wife, who was referred to by the witnesses as \u201cLili\u201d, as a co-owner of the Jurong West flat. VC was of the view that he did not need the plaintiff\u2019s consent since he was the sole owner of the Jurong West flat. But, he thought he should inform the plaintiff out of respect since the plaintiff also lived there and treated the Jurong West flat as the family home. VC raised the topic with SE, which was an indirect way of telling his father. He knew that SE would tell the plaintiff of his intention to register Lili as a co-owner of the Jurong West flat.', '19\\u2003The plaintiff\u2019s evidence was that he was not happy with the idea of Lili being a co-owner of the Jurong West flat. He felt that he owned an interest in the Jurong West flat. He claimed that he had given his late wife S$17,000 in cash and that she then used her CPF funds to pay for the downpayment, which was for the same amount. The plaintiff also claimed to have paid another S$17,000 for renovations for the flat when it was first purchased.', '20\\u2003As he was getting on in years, the plaintiff had started discussing with SE and SH on how he would distribute his interest in the Jurong West flat after his passing. According to VC, SH started telling him in May 2017 that the plaintiff was claiming that he owned a 50% interest in the Jurong West flat and that part of this interest would be distributed to his daughters when he died. VC disagreed with this because his position was that the Jurong West flat had been paid for entirely by his late mother and him.', '21\\u2003SH and VC started bickering about the issue of the ownership of the Jurong West flat. In the course of their dispute over the Jurong West flat, SH told VC that the plaintiff also owned shares in York and that these shares were being held by VC on trust for the plaintiff. SH wanted to know how many shares VC held in York and where his share certificates were.', '22\\u2003The history to SH\u2019s allegation about VC holding shares in York on trust for the plaintiff must be explained. SH gave evidence that the plaintiff had told her about his investment in York made in the 1990s and his agreement with the first defendant. The plaintiff had also told her that her uncle, NK, had said to him that his shares in York were being held by VC.', '23\\u2003NK\u2019s evidence was that, sometime in 2009, when he was chatting with his sister, LT, the topic of VC came up. LT had mentioned that VC was then working in China and spending quite a bit of time there. LT also said that the plaintiff had some shares in York to the tune of 5% of the company, and that his shares were in VC\u2019s name. Subsequently, when he met the plaintiff for tea, NK recounted this conversation with LT to him.', '24\\u2003VC\u2019s evidence was that he was upset with SH\u2019s accusation that his shares in York were not owned outright by him, which he knew not to be true. His unchallenged evidence on how he acquired his shares in York is this. He joined York in 1994. In 1997, the first defendant gave him 27,360 shares in York, amounting to 3% of the company\u2019s shareholding at that time. He believed that this was because of his hard work in the company. The first defendant never told him that the shares given to him belonged to the plaintiff.', '25\\u2003Then, in mid-1999, VC bought over 35,568 shares in York from another shareholder, Florina Wong. He had an arrangement with the first defendant for the purchase of these shares. The first defendant paid S$33,000 to Florina Wong for the shares, and then VC was to repay him (the first defendant) in instalments of S$369 per month. But, after one to two years, the first defendant told VC that there was no need to continue with the instalment payments and hence he never paid for the shares in full. He agreed with the first defendant then that, if he wanted to sell the shares, he would sell them back to the first defendant at half price.', '26\\u2003The last tranche of 12,072 shares was acquired by VC in 2011 when there was a rights issue. This was fully paid for by the second defendant because he wanted to reward VC for his contributions over the years. As such, this last tranche of shares was a gift to VC.', '27\\u2003Hence, VC was adamant that the shares in his name were not held on trust for the plaintiff. SH and SE did not believe him, and this led to the deterioration of their relationship. Throughout the quarrelling, the plaintiff remained silent and never once told VC that he was making a claim to ownership of the shares in VC\u2019s name. He let SH and SE do the talking for him.', '28\\u2003On or around 7 June 2017, the plaintiff, SH, SE and VC had a meeting about the plaintiff\u2019s claims to the Jurong West flat and VC\u2019s shares in York. The latter issue could not be resolved, but as for the Jurong West flat, one suggestion was for the plaintiff to buy over the flat from VC. The plaintiff was prepared to pay S$160,000 to buy over the Jurong West flat, but VC wanted S$200,000. In the end, no agreement was reached.', '29\\u2003On the issue of the plaintiff\u2019s claim to VC\u2019s shares in York, several phone calls were placed to LT during that same meeting to ask her to shed light on what she had said to NK about the plaintiff\u2019s shares being placed with VC. SE and SH both gave evidence that LT had first said that the York shares in VC\u2019s name belonged to the plaintiff, but had backpedalled in a later call on what she had said. LT\u2019s and VC\u2019s evidence was that LT had told VC not to argue with his sisters over this issue, and just tell them that the plaintiff\u2019s shares were with him. 9', 'LT wanted VC to avoid getting into a conflict with SH and SE. 10', '30\\u2003After this incident, VC decided that he did not want the shares that he held in York to be a source of contention with SE and SH. He went to see his cousin, the second defendant, and told him that he wanted to sell all the shares that he held in York. VC was also thinking then of leaving Singapore for China, where he had worked for a number of years when he was not working for York.', '31\\u2003After some discussion, VC agreed on or around 7 June 2017 to sell all his shares in York to the second defendant at the price of S$31,464. The second defendant issued VC a cheque on 9 June 2017 for this amount, which VC forgot to bank in until some time later. But, that was not the end of the matter.', '32\\u2003On 11 June 2017, SE called for a meeting with the first defendant and LT. This meeting was to take place at the Jurong West flat. VC, Lili, SH, the plaintiff, NK and ST were also present. By all accounts, this was a fractious affair, with accusations being hurled about and much shouting taking place. SH was one the main protagonists. She accused LT of flip-flopping on the issue of whether the shares in VC\u2019s name belonged to the plaintiff. The first defendant intervened in the argument and said that VC owned his shares, and, in the course of the meeting, explained that the plaintiff had no shares in York because he had only given a loan.', '33\\u2003As things got increasingly acrimonious, it was decided that the plaintiff would speak privately in one of the bedrooms with his sister, LT. Their siblings, NK and ST, also joined them in the room, although ST left after a short while because there was a loud quarrel in the living room between VC and Lili on one side, and SH and SE on the other. ST wanted to calm things down.', '34\\u2003In the bedroom, the plaintiff asked LT for S$50,000 so that he could top up his own funds and buy over the Jurong West flat from VC. LT agreed. The plaintiff also asked LT to continue with the monthly payments so that he could pay for his living expenses. They argued about how much the monthly payments should be. Eventually, LT agreed to pay the plaintiff S$800 monthly for the rest of his life. The plaintiff then said that SH and SE wanted half of VC\u2019s shares. LT then asked VC, SH and SE to come into the bedroom and she asked VC whether he would give up half of his shares to his two sisters. VC stayed silent for a while. He did not tell LT or the plaintiff that he had already sold all of his York shares to the second defendant. VC then nodded and walked off. LT\u2019s evidence was that all these proposals and agreements were an attempt by her to keep the peace and resolve the disputes in the family.', '35\\u2003That night, after the events of that day, LT told the first and second defendants separately what had transpired in the bedroom at the Jurong West flat. 11', 'They were upset at her. The first defendant told her that she had no authority to make any decisions about VC\u2019s shares, and the second defendant told his mother that VC\u2019s shares in York did not belong to the plaintiff. LT then called VC to explain that she had acted under pressure from the plaintiff. VC told her that she had been taken advantage of.', '36\\u2003The second defendant then called for another meeting of the family and his relatives on 24 June 2017 at the Jurong West flat. SE could not attend as she had already gone home to Bandung. The second defendant announced at the start of the meeting that the plaintiff held no ownership interest in York, and then he had only given a loan to the first defendant, for which he had been regularly receiving interest for many years. He also told those present that he had bought over VC\u2019s shares in York. This caused much consternation to SH, who began to raise her voice and make accusations against LT. The plaintiff remained silent and let SH speak for him.', '37\\u2003The second defendant and the plaintiff then had a private discussion in one of the bedrooms. To resolve matters, he offered to pay the plaintiff S$50,000 as a one-off lump sum, and S$800 a month for five years. The plaintiff did not accept his offer, but said that he needed to talk things over with SH. It was agreed that SH and the second defendant would get in touch, on behalf of the plaintiff and the first defendant respectively, and discuss to see if matters could be resolved.', '38\\u2003Thereafter, and until early August 2017, the second defendant and SH exchanged WhatsApp messages on a possible settlement. On 26 June 2017, the second defendant repeated the terms of settlement that he had conveyed to the plaintiff on 24 June 2017. By a return message on the same day, SH confirmed that the plaintiff \u201cwill accept the offer\u201d. Drafts of a settlement agreement were prepared by the second defendant and sent over to SH and the plaintiff. SH gave detailed comments to the second defendant, and chased for the agreement to the finalised and signed. By 10 August 2017, the terms of the agreement had been agreed. SH sent a message on that date stating that the plaintiff would sign the settlement agreement the following week.', '39\\u2003However, while the first and second defendants proceeded to execute the settlement agreement, the plaintiff did not do so. Instead, less than two weeks later, on 23 August 2017, the plaintiff\u2019s solicitors sent a letter to the first defendant threatening legal proceedings if the first defendant did not transfer to the plaintiff the shares in York which purportedly belonged to him, or pay the \u201creasonable current value\u201d of such shares.', '40\\u2003 The plaintiff commenced these legal proceedings against the first defendant as the sole defendant in September 2017. The matter was fixed before me for trial in August and September 2018. But, shortly before the trial, the first defendant suffered a stroke and was incapacitated for a period of time. In light of this, I vacated the trial dates despite the objections of the plaintiff.', '41\\u2003Thereafter, the plaintiff amended his pleadings to add the second defendant as a defendant. New trial dates were fixed and the matter was heard by me in September and October of 2019. By then, the first defendant had recovered somewhat, although he is now confined to a wheelchair and could barely speak audibly when giving evidence.'"}

The parties, however, also viewed another property at 9 Hillcrest Road (\u201c9 Hillcrest Road\u201d), which was also part of Hillcrest Villa, the following day. 23', 'The Plaintiff eventually changed his mind about 3H Hillcrest Road and, on 25 January 2017 decided to purchase 9 Hillcrest Road. The option fee for 3H Hillcrest Road was forfeited. 24', 'The purchase price for 9 Hillcrest Road was $3,080,000 and, apart from bank financing, a balance capital outlay of approximately $2m was needed. 25', 'According to the Defendant, the Plaintiff wanted the property to be in her sole name to shield the asset from matrimonial division when he divorced his wife. 26', '16\\u2003The Plaintiff transferred a further sum of $154,000, which was 5% of the purchase price for 9 Hillcrest Road, to the Defendant for the purpose of purchasing the property. With this transfer, the Plaintiff had advanced a total sum of $878,000 (being the sum of $724,532 and $154,000, rounded to the nearest thousand). 27', 'It goes without saying that this sum is characterised as a loan by the Plaintiff on the basis that the Defendant wanted to purchase 9 Hillcrest Road as an investment property and had sought a loan from him. 28', '17\\u2003Apart from the $878,000 already transferred to the Defendant, the Plaintiff avers that the Defendant requested for a further sum of $1.122m to complete the purchase of 9 Hillcrest Road 29', '. This eventually led to the drafting of a Loan Facility Agreement dated 24 March 2017 (\u201c$2m Loan Agreement\u201d). On or about 21 March 2017, whilst the $2m Loan Agreement was being negotiated, the Plaintiff transferred a further sum of $250,000 to the Defendant.

The Plaintiff\u2019s case is that the $2m Loan Agreement evidences his intention that the various sums advanced or to be advanced to the Defendant were loans. The Defendant, however, argues that the $2m Loan Agreement is a sham document meant to be used as a bargaining chip by the Plaintiff for negotiating the division of assets with his wife in relation to their intended divorce 32', '. The Defendant also asserts that the Plaintiff had made promises that the $2m Loan Agreement would not be enforced against her 33', '. Suffice it to say for now that before the $2m Loan Agreement was signed, the Plaintiff\u2019s wife had already discovered the parties\u2019 relationship. 34', '21\\u2003The Defendant claims that on 31 March 2017, the Plaintiff asked the Defendant to lend him a sum of $150,000 so that he could show his wife that the Defendant was willing to give him any amount that he asked for. 35', 'The Defendant advanced the sum to the Plaintiff. The Defendant testified that her lawyer had advised her to record the loan formally in writing. She eventually asked her lawyer to prepare a Deed of Gift, the first draft of which recorded that the Plaintiff was to repay the $150,000 by 15 May 2017 failing which the $2m Loan Agreement was to be deemed irrevocably a gift to the Defendant. 36', 'There were two further drafts of the Deed of Gift. None of the drafts was ever signed by the Plaintiff. 37', '22\\u2003The Defendant deposes that from 12 April 2017, she was unable to contact the Plaintiff as he had refused to reply to her texts or answer her calls. On 19 April 2017, the Defendant discovered that she was pregnant and informed the Plaintiff. 38', 'The Plaintiff eventually replied to the Defendant on 25 April 2017.

At best, this could only have been \ninferred, based on the amended pleading that the loan agreements were shams. \nThe defendants argued that the loans were actually given to the 2nd and 3rd \ndefendants instead of the 1st defendant, and that since the 2nd and 3rd \ndefendants were not corporations, the plaintiff is not an excluded \nmoneylender.40 Apart from this inference, there was no other pleaded fact to \nsuggest that the plaintiff is not an excluded moneylender. For example, it was \nnot pleaded that the plaintiff had lent money to some other non-corporation. The \nUML defence hence seemed to have been based on and was linked to the sham \ndefence.\n21 Second, even accepting the above inference, the sham defence in itself \nwas just a bare assertion that was not supported by any pleaded fact. O 18 r 8(1) \nof the ROC provides that a party must specifically plead any fact showing \nillegality, which he alleges makes any claim not maintainable. Further, although \n40 Udehkumar\u2019s affidavit at pp 12\u201313\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLee Wen Jervis v Jask Pte Ltd [2020] SGHC 75\n10the pleadings need not contain evidence, they must contain the material facts \nwhich are relied upon (O 18 r 7(1) ROC). In the present case, no facts were \npleaded to support that the loan agreements were shams. Even if the \namendments had been allowed, the defendants will not be able to show how the \nagreements were shams, since the defendants cannot rely on material facts not \npleaded in the pleadings (Sheagar [4] supra) at [94]). \n22 Third, it is unclear how far the defendants can go with the sham \nargument. The plaintiff submitted that the loan agreements were drafted by the \ndefendants\u2019 counsel\u2019s law firm and the 3rd defendant was a former partner of \nthis law firm. This was not contested by the defendants. The sham defence hence \nseemed to be confessing that the defendants\u2019 law firm had drafted a sham \nagreement. \n23 The defendants argued that the plaintiff had not even pleaded that he \nwas an excluded moneylender, and that the plaintiff had a burden to plead as \nsuch before the burden shifted to the defendants to disprove this. I did not accept \nthis contention. The defendants relied on Sheagar but did not show how that \ncase stands for this proposition.41 In the present case, the UML defence had not \nbeen pleaded in the defendants\u2019 original Defence, and hence there had been no \nneed for the plaintiff to plead that he was an excluded moneylender in the Reply. \nIn any case, the plaintiff had submitted before me (although not previously \nbefore the learned AR) that he has not made any other loans to any non-\ncorporate entities (above at [14]), and this was sufficient. In any case, as stated, \nthe burden is on the defendants to show that the plaintiff was not an excluded \nmoneylender.\n41 Defendants\u2019 submissions to AR at para 9\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLee Wen Jervis v Jask Pte Ltd [2020] SGHC 75\n1124 For these reasons, the proposed amendments relating to the UML \ndefence did not disclose a reasonable defence.\n25 I note that the learned AR had reached the same conclusion, but on \ndifferent grounds, by finding that the plaintiff was prima facie an excluded \nmoneylender. With respect, the learned AR\u2019s finding that the plaintiff lent \nmoney to one corporation does not mean that the plaintiff solely lent money to \ncorporations. Further, there had been no basis to have made such a finding, since \nthe plaintiffs had not even submitted before the learned AR that they were an \nexcluded moneylender, merely stating that it was the defendants\u2019 burden to \nshow otherwise.42 In any case, even if the plaintiff was prima facie an excluded \nmoneylender, this did not mean that the UML defence was not a reasonable \ndefence, since such a prima facie finding can be reversed with evidence. The \ncentral issue that should have been addressed was whether the amended facts \npleaded were sufficient to make out a reasonable defence.\nSham defence\n26 For the reasons discussed under the UML defence, the proposed \namendments relating to the sham defence also did not disclose reasonable \ndefence. No facts were pleaded to substantiate breaches of any other legislation. \nUnconscionability defence\n27 The defendants had pleaded in the original Defence that the OTPs were \nso undervalued as to be invalid.43 They had sought leave to amend the Defence \n42 Plaintiff\u2019s 2nd submissions to AR (especially at para 11); Plaintiff\u2019s submission to AR; \nAR Hearing\n43 Defence at para 1\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLee Wen Jervis v Jask Pte Ltd [2020] SGHC 75\n12to plead that the agreements were unconscionable, as the purchase prices to the \nOTPs were unilaterally determined by the plaintiff, and were below market \nvalue. The purpose of this amendment seemed to be to elaborate on what was \nalready pleaded in the original Defence by arguing that the doctrinal basis for \nthis defence is the doctrine of unconscionability. The learned AR rejected the \namendment sought, reasoning that defendants had provided no legal basis to \nshow that an undervalued OTP is ipso facto invalid (per [8] above). I do note \nthat the amendment was for the purpose of pleading the legal basis of \nunconscionability, and to elaborate on the facts supporting it.

{"casename":"2020_SGHC_81","fact":"'2\\u2003A brief chronology of the relevant facts is as follows.', '3\\u2003On 15 January 2013, CKR and Asplenium entered into a contract (\u201cthe Contract\u201d) concerning the development of the \u201cSeletar Park Residence\u201d, a condominium project at Seletar Road (\u201cthe Project\u201d). 1', 'Asplenium had engaged CKR as the main contractor to carry out building and construction works for the Project. Two points bear note in relation to the Contract:', '(a)\\u2003First, the Contract incorporated the Singapore Institute of Architects\u2019 Articles and Conditions of Building Contract (Lump Sum Contract) 9th Edition (Reprint August 2011) (the \u201cSIA Conditions\u201d) and the Supplemental Articles and Conditions of Contract. 2', '(b)\\u2003Second, pursuant to the Contract, a performance bond was procured by CKR in favour of Asplenium in the sum of S$8,806,383.80. 3', '4\\u2003On 24 October 2014, for reasons which are not directly relevant to the present judgment, Asplenium terminated CKR\u2019s employment under the Contract. A replacement contract tender exercise was held and a new contractor was appointed to complete the Project.', '5\\u2003On 4 November 2014, consequent to the termination of the Contract, Asplenium made a call on the performance bond for the full sum. While the call amount was subsequently reduced by Asplenium to around S$7.7 million, Asplenium made a second call on the performance bond for the remaining balance of around S$1.1 million on 17 December 2015.', '6\\u2003On 10 November 2014, CKR commenced arbitration against Asplenium pursuant to the parties\u2019 arbitration agreement in clause 37 of the SIA Conditions. The arbitration clause provided that any dispute between the parties arising out of the Contract was to be \u201creferred to the arbitration and final decision of a person to be agreed by the parties\u201d. 4', 'CKR proposed the appointment of Mr Chow Kok Fong as the sole arbitrator, and Asplenium agreed. 5', 'Mr Chow (hereafter referred to as the \u201carbitrator\u201d or the \u201ctribunal\u201d) was accordingly appointed as the sole arbitrator.', '7\\u2003On the application of CKR, the arbitration proceedings were bifurcated into two phases \u2013 a liability phase and a quantum phase. The liability phase of the arbitration ran from 10 November 2014 to 14 February 2018, and two awards were issued on this regard. The first of these two awards, Partial Award 1, was dated 11 October 2017. It set out the tribunal\u2019s findings on liability. In essence, the arbitrator found that the Contract had been validly terminated by Asplenium. 6', 'The second award, Partial Award 2, was dated 14 February 2018, pursuant to which Asplenium was awarded costs for the liability phase in the sum of S$4,162,000. 7', '8\\u2003The arbitration then proceeded to the quantum phase. The hearing took place from 20 August to 30 August 2018. The tribunal issued Partial Award 3 on 9 April 2019. Corrections to Partial Award 3 followed on 26 April 2019 and 15 May 2019. In Partial Award 3, the tribunal found that CKR was liable to Asplenium for sums due and liquidated damages arising from Asplenium\u2019s valid termination of the Contract. However, in view of the amount already received by Asplenium pursuant to its call on the performance bond, the tribunal found that the net balance owing from Asplenium to CKR was S$6,405,536.34 (the \u201cAward Sum\u201d). This net balance reflected that Asplenium had been \u201cover-paid\u201d pursuant to the call on the performance bond, and the over-payment was therefore had to be repaid to CKR. 8', '9\\u2003Partial Award 4 was issued on 3 July 2019 to deal with costs related to the quantum phase (the \u201cQuantum Costs Award\u201d). The tribunal\u2019s reasoning in the Quantum Costs Award was largely premised on the fact that Asplenium had issued a Calderbank letter on 6 August 2018 before the hearing of the quantum phase (the \u201cCalderbank Offer\u201d) which went unaccepted, and the fact that CKR had not achieved a more favourable outcome than what was offered in the Calderbank Offer. 9', '10\\u2003Calderbank letters have their genesis in the English Court of Appeal decision of Calderbank v Calderbank [1976] Fam 93 (CA). The crux of the decision, for present purposes, is that where a party receives a written offer to settle proceedings for a particular sum but refuses the offer, contests proceedings, and obtains a judgment for less than that particular sum, an adverse costs order may be made against him. The later English decision of Cutts v Head [1984] Ch 290 accepted from 302 to 312 that where a party had made a written offer to settle \u201cwithout prejudice save as to costs\u201d, that offer could be validly considered by the Court in determining the final costs order. A useful summary of these developments is set out by Lee Seiu Kin J in Ong & Ong Pte Ltd v Fairview Developments Pte Ltd [2014] 2 SLR 1285 from [32] to [35], but it suffices to note for present purposes that the Calderbank letter is an accepted part of Singapore law: Shi Fang v Koh Pee Huat [1996] 1 SLR(R) 906 at [54] to [55].', '11\\u2003Under the terms of the Calderbank Offer, Asplenium had offered to pay CKR S$9.5 million in full and final settlement of \u201cany and all claims, counterclaims, disputes, controversies and\/or costs arising out of or in connection with the [Project], including, but not limited to the arbitration proceedings between [CKR and Asplenium]\u201d. 10', '12\\u2003In their submissions to the arbitrator, the reference to \u201cany and all claims, counterclaims \u2026 and\/or costs\u201d was contested between CKR and Asplenium. CKR contended that the Calderbank Offer related to: 11', '(a)\\u2003the arbitration;', '(b)\\u2003HC\/S 1274\/2015, a claim in, inter alia, conspiracy commenced by CKR against Asplenium and eight other parties (\u201cSuit 1274\u201d) whilst the arbitration was ongoing;', '(c)\\u2003CA 179\/2017, an appeal by CKR against a decision of the High Court in an interlocutory order made in relation to non-disclosure of privileged documents in favour of Asplenium and three other parties (\u201cCA 179\u201d) in the course of HC\/S 37\/2015, which was a claim in negligence against the quantity surveyor and quantity surveying firms that priced the replacement tender referred to at [4] above (\u201cSuit 37\u201d); and', '(d)\\u2003HC\/S 349\/2018, a claim in deceit against the architects working on the Project (\u201cSuit 349\u201d).', '13\\u2003On the other hand, Asplenium contended that the Calderbank Offer related only to items [12(a)] to [12(c)] above. Asplenium argued that Suit 349 was not included within the ambit of the Calderbank Offer because Asplenium was not party to Suit 349 at all. 12', '14\\u2003In the Quantum Costs Award, the tribunal accepted that the Calderbank Offer related only to items [12(a)] to [12(c)] above. Observing that the Calderbank Offer sum of S$9.5 million was approximately S$3.1 million more than the Award Sum of around S$6.4 million, the tribunal determined that \u201cthis excess of $3.1 million suggests irresistibly that [CKR] would have been better off in accepting the Offer Sum\u201d. 13', 'The tribunal therefore found that CKR was entitled to costs of S$950,758.27, representing the proportion of costs for the quantum phase incurred up to 13 August 2018 (the last day for acceptance of the Calderbank Offer), but that Asplenium was entitled to S$826,540.88, representing the proportion of costs from 14 August 2018 (after the expiry of the Calderbank Offer) to the close of arbitration proceedings. 14', 'The tribunal concluded the Quantum Costs Award by finding that the net costs of S$124,217.39 were payable to CKR. 15', '15\\u2003The Quantum Costs Award forms the subject matter for the present application.', '16\\u2003I pause at this point to note the fairly extensive and protracted nature of the arbitration. Spanning a period of around five years, the bifurcated arbitration involved four Partial Awards, many days of hearing, and multiple rounds of submissions before the arbitrator. Apart from this present application, there also have been three earlier applications to the Court for leave to appeal against questions of law arising from the tribunal\u2019s awards. The complexity of the matter undoubtedly engendered considerable costs on both sides. CKR\u2019s failure to even respond to the Calderbank Offer perhaps regrettably extinguished an opportunity to resolve the dispute before costs continued to escalate.'"}

Terence Siow Kai Yuan (\u201cthe Respondent\u201d) was 22 years of age when he saw the victim taking a seat on the train.

The first defendant did not contest the application for winding-up.', '9\\u2003On 23 November 2018, the plaintiff commenced these proceedings for, inter alia, a stay of the winding-up order. The plaintiff then filed an urgent application seeking an interim stay of the winding-up order. Having heard parties on 12 December 2018, I ordered an interim stay of the winding-up order pending the final disposal of this OS. I also directed that the Liquidator furnish a report on the financial standing of the first defendant one month prior to the hearing of this OS, and made clear that the directors of the first defendant were to provide such documents and information as may be required by the Liquidator for the preparation of this report. 4', '10\\u2003In these proceedings, there was no dispute that a sum of US$2m had indeed been transferred from the second defendant to the first defendant on 12 June 2013. 5', 'Rather, the dispute centred on the nature of this transfer. The plaintiff claimed that the sum was part of the consideration paid for the purchase, by the second defendant from the first defendant, of shares in Raycom Engineering & Aerospace Pte Ltd (\u201cRaycom\u201d), a subsidiary of the first defendant, and hence was not a loan. 6', '11\\u2003On the other hand, the second defendant insisted that the sum of US$2m was a loan extended by the second defendant to the first defendant which has not been repaid. 7', 'The source of the money was the GV Reddy Irrevocable Trust, which had transferred this sum of US$2m to the second defendant on 4 June 2013. This trust was a family trust of the Reddy family and had been set up by Dr Gollamudi Venka Reddy (\u201cDr Reddy\u201d), a United States-based businessman. 8', 'The second defendant then lent this sum to the first defendant. The US$2m was ultimately intended to be passed from the first defendant to Mr Mahesh Triplicani Gowri Sankar (\u201cMr Mahesh\u201d), who owns and controls the plaintiff, and, through it, the first defendant. 9', 'According to the second defendant, Mr Mahesh had asked for a loan from Dr Reddy for a business venture and had asked for the moneys to be sent to the first defendant. Dr Reddy had agreed. Dr Reddy\u2019s evidence was that Mr Mahesh had sought the US$2m loan to finance the acquisition of a plant from the Shell Oil Company as part of a project in the petrochemicals sector. 10', '12\\u2003While the above arrangement for what was ultimately the extending of a loan from Dr Reddy to Mr Mahesh might seem unusual, the second defendant\u2019s case was that this was an arrangement that was agreed to by the two principal individuals, ie, that the intermediaries (the first and second defendants) would be the borrower and lender. 11'"}
{"casename":"2020_SGHC_88","fact":"'4\\u2003The defendant is the management corporation of a condominium called The Caribbean at Keppel Bay (\u201cThe Caribbean\u201d). Its managing agent, the company appointed to supervise the day-to-day administration of the condominium, is Savills Property Management Pte Ltd (\u201cSavills\u201d). Mr Chan Kok Hong (\u201cKok Hong\u201d) is Savills\u2019 representative. As in normal in such cases, he was the person in charge of organising the AGM and guided Lee in chairing the proceedings at the AGM. At this point I should mention that the defendant has adopted a neutral position in these proceedings. This is entirely understandable since the management corporation has no real interest in this dispute (save perhaps, an interest in \u201chaving the matter resolved with finality\u201d 5', ') and the real quarrel was between Lee and Chan.', '5\\u2003Lee was the chairperson of the outgoing management council (\u201cthe 12th Management Council\u201d). 6', 'By virtue of that position, she chaired the AGM. During the AGM, she stood for elections to be part of the 13th Management Council. 7', '6\\u2003Chan also stood for election at the AGM. She was one of the ten candidates duly elected to the 13th Management Council. 8', 'Lee, on the other hand, was tied with another candidate for the 11th and last seat of the 13th Management Council. 9', 'Before the tie could be broken by a runoff vote of the two candidates, Lee declared the AGM to be adjourned. I now set out the circumstances leading to this event.', '7\\u2003The AGM began fairly unremarkably. When it was called to order at 2.30p.m., 10', 'there were minimal interruptions to the chairperson\u2019s address, few questions were posed and all was proceeding according to the agenda that had been circulated earlier. 11', 'This state of affairs however, did not last long.', '8\\u2003Simple requests for clarification soon gave way to extensive explanations and defensive posturing. These in turn invited further questions and criticism. A question about the management corporation\u2019s expenditure on legal fees, for example, prompted an extensive historical account of controversies that arose at the previous annual general meeting. 12', 'Personal grievances, legitimate or otherwise, hijacked the discussion for extended periods of time. 13', 'Accusations of \u201cdraconian\u201d mismanagement, 14', 'tokenistic engagement with the residents (\u201cfake dialogue\u201d) 15', 'and opaque governance 16', 'pockmarked the proceedings. As one resident memorably put it, the AGM resembled a stage for personal grievances more than a meeting about condominium administration. 17', '9\\u2003There were multiple attempts to rein in the meeting. Lee urged attendees to keep their comments relevant to the item being discussed, 18', 'limited the number of questions asked per item 19', 'and restricted the amount of time given for personal speeches. 20', 'Notwithstanding this, it soon became apparent that the AGM would not conclude its business by 7pm as originally intended. 21', 'Indeed, at 6pm, the candidates for the 13th Management Council had barely started introducing themselves. 22', 'With some 23 candidates standing for election, there was hardly enough time to hear 23 campaign speeches from these candidates, let alone time for voters to deliberate and for the organisers to count the votes. In light of this, Kok Hong secured an extension till 8pm hoping to finish this item on the agenda. Kok Hong announced to the meeting, somewhat over-optimistically that: \u201cWe have been able to get an extension of one more hour to stay here, so it looks like we will be able to go through the elections and counting of the votes, okay?\u201d. 23', 'Lee shared the same sentiment: \u201cI think we should just hear everybody out and at least get this done\u201d. 24', '10\\u2003Unfortunately, further complications arose. More issues were raised. Term limits, 25', 'voter secrecy, 26', 'and other ancillary matters captured the attention of the attendees. 27', 'Kok Hong did his best to address them 28', 'but it was apparent that time was running out. The AGM was already operating on borrowed time and the goodwill of the venue operator and Kok Hong was acutely aware of the (extended) deadline - this much was clear from the way he hurried proceedings along 29', 'and from his peremptory declarations that an adjournment was inevitable. Indeed, he insisted on it on multiple occasions \u2013 first as the AGM approached its initial 7pm deadline, 30', 'again as it neared its 8pm deadline 31', 'and once more right before he announced the results of the elections. 32', '11\\u2003Despite Kok Hong\u2019s efforts, one more hiccup awaited the AGM. The elections themselves were hamstrung by a tie at the very last minute. Whilst counting the votes, it transpired that there had been a tie for the 11th seat on the 13th Management Council and that a \u2018run-off\u2019 between the two contenders would be necessary. 33', 'Kok Hong declared that an adjournment was in order and Lee agreed, and promptly declared the AGM adjourned to another date. By this time, it was around 9pm, two hours after the scheduled time of 7pm.', '12\\u2003To be clear, Lee\u2019s call for an adjournment was hardly a democratic decision. No motion for adjournment was called and Lee simply declared the meeting to be adjourned. In fact, there had been multiple objections to an adjournment before the elections were fully concluded. One resident suggested continuing the AGM at The Caribbean\u2019s clubhouse. 34', 'Another asked whether October was too late for an adjourned AGM, 35', 'while others questioned whether an adjournment was warranted at all \u2013 \u201cthe election should not be split into two different meetings\u201d someone said. 36', 'Even a recount was suggested, following the unexpected tie for the 11th seat, 37', 'but Kok Hong did not entertain any such requests:', '13\\u2003Lee adjourned the AGM shortly after this exchange. 39', 'Notwithstanding the adjournment, there was one final objection by a concerned and hitherto unidentified resident. He said that because of the nature of the tie, which was between Lee and another electoral candidate, there was a \u201cconflict of interest with the current chairlady\u201d. 40', 'He questioned whether the postponement was fair and asked for his objection to be put on record.'"}
{"casename":"2020_SGHC_89","fact":"'2\\u2003I will start by setting out the undisputed facts in this case. The Plaintiffs and the 1st and the 2nd Defendants are sisters. The 1st Defendant (\u201cDoreen\u201d) is the oldest sister, followed by the 2nd Plaintiff (\u201cIvy\u201d), then by the 1st Plaintiff (\u201cBlossom\u201d), and finally by the 2nd Defendant (\u201cJulie\u201d).

These other siblings did not give evidence at the trial, although some reference was made to them by the Sisters during their testimonies.', '5\\u2003The companies which form the subject of the Plaintiffs\u2019 winding-up application in this case (the 3rd to the 6th Defendants) are as follows:', '(a)\\u2003Chiap Chuan Management Pte Ltd (\u201cCCM\u201d);', '(b)\\u2003Yong Peng Realty (Pte) Limited (\u201cYP\u201d);', '(c)\\u2003Tan Boon Liat And Company (Singapore) Private Limited (\u201cTBL\u201d); and', '(d)\\u2003Chiap Chuan Holdings Pte Ltd (\u201cCCH\u201d).', '6\\u2003In these written grounds, when all of these four companies are referred to collectively, I will refer to them as \u201cthe Companies\u201d.', '7\\u2003The number of shares in each company, as well as the amount of issued and paid-up capital, are as follows:', '8\\u2003CCH, YP and TBL are all property holding companies, while CCM provides management services to these three. CCH, YP and TBL derive their main source of revenue from rental collected from the tenants of units in their buildings, while CCM\u2019s main source of revenue comes from service management payments which it receives from the other three companies. Only CCM employs staff.', '9\\u2003It is not disputed that the various properties owned by the Companies were acquired by Father during his lifetime as investment properties.', '10\\u2003Within Singapore, CCH, YP and TBL own freehold strata titles in the following properties:', '(a)\\u2003The RV Building.', 'This is a mixed residential and commercial development located at 460\/A\/B\/C to 484\/A\/B\/C (even numbers) River Valley Road, Singapore 248345 to 248369 (\u201cRV Building\u201d). The building comprises 56 units, of which CCH owns 44 units (11 stacks of 4 units per stack) and YP owns 12 units (3 stacks of 4 units per stack).', 'The RV Building is managed by Management Corporation Strata Title 325 (\u201cMCST 325\u201d). Blossom and Ivy are the Council members of the MCST 325 Council. The MCST 325 Council has a physical office at the RV Building. CCM served as the Managing Agent for MCST 325 until on or about 30 April 2017. The Plaintiffs and the Defendants presented opposing explanations as to how and why CCM ceased to be the Managing Agent, with Blossom and Ivy pointing the finger of blame at Doreen and Julie, and vice versa. Suntec Real Estate Consultants Pte Ltd was appointed as interim Managing Agent after 30 April 2017 and as Managing Agent with effect from 1 June 2017. CCM also managed the accounts in respect of the RV Building until on or about 1 June 2017, following which Suntec Real Estate Consultants Pte Ltd took on the management of the accounts.', 'It is not disputed that the Companies share the same principal place of business and physical office at a unit in the RV Building (though Blossom and Ivy have asserted that Doreen and Julie later \u201cunilaterally\u201d moved \u201cTBL or part of TBL\u201d out to another unit in the RV Building).', '11\\u2003At the time of Father\u2019s death in June 2003, CCH also owned properties in Johor Bahru (\u201dJB\u201d) (\u201cJB Properties\u201d), Kuala Lumpur (\u201cKL\u201d) (\u201cKL Properties\u201d), Melaka (\u201cMelaka Properties\u201d) and Ipoh. 2', 'The JB Properties and the KL Properties were subsequently sold. Indeed, the sale of the JB Properties \u2013 as well as the abortive sale of the Melaka Properties \u2013 became contentious issues which were canvassed by Blossom and Ivy on the one hand and Doreen and Julie on the other, in their respective bids to demonstrate the other side\u2019s unreasonable or even underhanded behaviour.', '12\\u2003The respective shareholding of each of the Sisters in the Companies is as follows:', '13\\u2003The Sisters acquired the bulk of their shareholding in the Companies via inheritance. 3', 'Prior to Father\u2019s death, he was the majority shareholder in each of the Companies, and Mother was the minority shareholder, but none of the children held any shares. 4', 'In his will, 5', 'Father gave cash gifts to Mother, the Sisters, and their three other siblings (Charlie, Victor, and Lena). The residue of his estate \u2013 including shares in the Companies \u2013 was given to the Sisters \u201cin equal shares absolutely\u201d. Mother and the three other siblings did not receive any shares of the Companies under Father\u2019s will. The Sisters were appointed as the trustees and executors of Father\u2019s will.', '14\\u2003It will be seen that after Father\u2019s death, the Sisters each hold 25% of the shares in each company, subject to the following minor differences. In TBL, Doreen holds one more share than the other Sisters; and in YP, Doreen and Blossom each hold one share more than Ivy and July. These differences in the TBL and YP shareholdings came about through the following events.', '15\\u2003In the case of TBL, the company has an odd number of shares in TBL (4,261 shares). After 1,065 shares were apportioned to each sister, the extra share ended up with Doreen. It is Blossom\u2019s and Ivy\u2019s case that Doreen had represented to them that ownership in the extra TBL share could not be divided between shareholders; and that on the basis that each sister would have an equal one-quarter share in the extra TBL share, they had \u201centrusted\u201d Doreen with their respective one-quarter shares for her to hold on their behalf. 6', 'It is Doreen\u2019s and Julie\u2019s case that Blossom, Ivy and Julie had unanimously and unconditionally agreed to let Doreen have the extra TBL share because she was the eldest sibling. According to Doreen and Julie, there was never any understanding or agreement that each sister would own a one-quarter interest in this extra TBL share: Doreen has at all material times been (and continues to be) the sole legal and beneficial owner of the extra TBL share. 7', '16\\u2003In the case of YP, Doreen and Blossom had each purchased one of Mother\u2019s YP Shares. Prior to her death, Mother held 3,000 shares in CCH; 2,000 shares in CCM; 100 shares in TBL; and 2 shares in YP. Sometime in late 2013 or early 2014, Mother sold her shares to the Sisters in equal proportions - save for her YP shares. Ivy and Julie had declined to purchase Mother\u2019s YP shares; and eventually, it was Doreen and Blossom who each purchased one of Mother\u2019s YP Shares.', '17\\u2003Prior to his death, Father was a director of all four Companies. Up to the point of her death on 27 June 2016, Mother too was a director of each of the Companies; 8', 'and specific to CCH, Father had appointed her as \u201cLife Director\u201d pursuant to Article 77 of CCH\u2019s articles of association. 9', 'Prior to his death, Father had also appointed Blossom and Ivy as directors of CCH; Doreen as a director of TBL; and Julie as a director of YP. Chua \u2013 who is a relative of the Sisters\u2019 \u2013 was also appointed as a director of CCM and YP. 10', '18\\u2003Father\u2019s will expressly stipulated that \u201cno son of [his] shall be \u2026 appointed as officer or employee or agent\u201d of any of the Companies. 11', 'Apart from this express stipulation, Father\u2019s will did not say anything either specifically about the directorships of the Companies or more generally about the management of the Companies\u2019 affairs.', '19\\u2003It will be recalled that pursuant to the terms of Father\u2019s will, the shares in the Companies were bequeathed to the Sisters in equal shares; and that all four Sisters were appointed as the trustees and executors of the will. Following Father\u2019s death and on or around 17 June 2003, the Sisters appointed themselves as directors of all the four Companies (insofar as they were not already directors). 12', 'As to why they became directors of the Companies, Blossom and Ivy had a different version of events from that put forward by Doreen and Julie.', '20\\u2003While there were varying accounts among the Sisters as to how the Companies\u2019 affairs were managed post 17 June 2003, broadly speaking it was not disputed that in the immediate aftermath of Father\u2019s death in April 2003, Julie was the only one of the four Sisters who worked fulltime in CCM (the company providing management services to the three property-owning companies). At that point, Doreen was an academic who split her time between Singapore and Australia; Ivy resided primarily in Malaysia and also Australia; and Blossom, whilst based in Singapore, was then in fulltime employment with Hewlett-Packard (although at trial she alleged that even whilst employed by Hewlett-Packard, she had spent a portion of her time working in the CCM office).', '21\\u2003In 2004, Doreen gave up her academic position in order to work alongside Julie in CCM. In February 2010, Julie took a leave of absence from CCM which lasted till August 2010. Sometime in 2010, following Julie\u2019s decision to go on a leave of absence, Doreen invited Blossom to join her in working in CCM, and Blossom agreed. When Julie returned to work in August 2010, Blossom had already started working fulltime in CCM; and she continued to do so until her resignation on 28 July 2016.', '22\\u2003Throughout these proceedings, Doreen and Julie have used the term \u201cworking directors\u201d to describe their positions in CCM. 13', 'Whilst Blossom and Ivy expressed reservations about the use of this term and\/or professed at times not to understand what it meant, I was prepared to accept the term as a form of convenient shorthand for referring to those directors who worked fulltime in CCM. This would cover not only Doreen and Julie but also Blossom during the period between 2010 and July 2016 when \u2013 post her resignation from Hewlett-Packard \u2013 she was working fulltime in CCM.', '23\\u2003As for Ivy, it was not disputed that during the period she was living in Malaysia and Australia, she assisted to look after the Malaysian properties. It was also not disputed that she continued to do so after her return from Australia to Singapore in 2012. Ivy herself has alleged that she was \u201cgenerally prepared to leave the day to day handling of Singapore business operations to the other Sisters (which concerned Singapore properties), but \u2026 expected to be kept abreast on all matters pertaining to the Companies\u201d. 14', 'On 28 July 2016 (the date of Blossom\u2019s resignation), however, she wrote to the other Sisters stating that she was retiring \u201cfrom involvement in the Singapore operations\u201d. 15', '24\\u2003I will next summarise the versions of events put forward by Blossom and Ivy on the one hand, and by Doreen and Julie on the other.'"}

As no other interests in the Land had been registered with the Registry of Land Titles and Deeds (\u201cthe Registry\u201d), the 1987 Gazette named Mr Moona as the \u201cowner\u201d and Mr Chitty as the \u201cmortgagee\u201d of the Land (\u201cthe paper owners\u201d). 2', 'Notices of Acquisition under s 8 of the LAA 1987 dated 7 January 1988 (\u201c7 January 1988 Notices\u201d) were addressed to the paper owners but could not be personally served on them as they could not be traced. These notices were thus posted on the Land Office\u2019s notice board. 3', 'The 7 January 1988 Notices called on the paper owners to appear at the Office of the Collector on 3 March 1988 to state the nature of their interest in the land, any claim in compensation that they may have and any objections to the measurements cited in respect of the Land.', '4\\u2003On 22 January 1988, a Land Office Notice (\u201c22 January 1988 Notice\u201d) was posted on the Land pursuant to s 8 of the LAA 1987. It stated that the Land was required under the LAA 1987 and invited persons interested to appear at the Land Office on 3 March 1988 to state their interest in the Land and any claims to compensation. 4', 'The 22 January 1988 Notice was posted on the Land by one Mr Halim.

Ms Tan Hwee Ching (\u201cMs Tan\u201d) from the Singapore Land Authority (\u201cSLA\u201d) attested that Mr Halim, who was 71 years old at the time of hearing, was unable to recall the Land. 5', '5\\u2003However, no one appeared before the Land Office to state their claims. On 18 March 1988, the Collector awarded $18,800 (ie, the 1988 Award) as compensation for the Acquisition to the paper owners under s 10 of the LAA 1987. As the 1988 Award could not be served on the paper owners, it was posted on the Land Office Notice Board on the same day. The paper owners did not collect the award and the sum was paid into court pursuant to a court order of 20 June 1988 in Originating Summons No 600 of 1988 (\u201cOS 600 of 1988\u201d). 6', '6\\u2003The Land was vested in the State on 12 September 1988.

The September 1988 Notice also showed that the notice was posted on the Land by one Mr Khosni, a Land Inspector with the Land Office. 7', '7\\u2003Mr Khosni attested as follows. 8', 'He went to Palm Drive to take possession of the cemetery. He saw houses on both sides of the road, until the road came to an end where \u201cthere was a temporary structure which looked like a house made of wood and other materials (\u2018the Structure\u2019)\u201d [emphasis in original]. He did not notice anyone around the Structure, and saw that behind the Structure was a cemetery with graves going up a high slope. The Land Office\u2019s practice was to post the notice at a conspicuous place. Where there was a structure on the land, the practice was to post the notice on the structure. Accordingly, he posted the September 1988 Notice on the Structure. He also recalled that the Structure looked very different from other houses that he saw along Palm Drive because the other houses were permanent structures.', '8\\u2003Mr Khosni, in his affidavit, marked the location of the Structure on a plan showing Palm Drive and the Land. Ms Tan attested that the location of the Structure as described by Mr Khosni corresponded to the location of the House on the Land. 9', '9\\u2003The cemetery was exhumed in 2009. 10', '10\\u2003Mr Ahmad stated as follows. His grandfather helped to maintain and upkeep the cemetery, and subsequently built a Malay-style kampong house (the House) on the Land as his new permanent abode by around 1955. Thereafter, his grandfather\u2019s family resided and occupied the Land, with Mr Adam taking care of the Land after Mr Ahmad\u2019s grandfather passed away. 11', '11\\u2003Mr Ahmad claimed that the 22 January 1988 Notice was never posted on the Land and, in any event, Mr Ahmad and his family (who were residing on the Land at the material time) were entirely unaware of that notice. Also, notices similar to the 7 January 1988 Notices were never sent to him or Mr Adam. Even after the Collector had made the 1988 Award, Mr Adam, Mr Ahmad and his family continued to reside in the House and were oblivious to the Acquisition. 12', '12\\u2003Mr Ahmad claimed that from 1964 to 2013, the government recognised Mr Adam as the \u201cregistered owner\u201d of the House. Mr Adam paid the property taxes from 1964 until his demise in May 1997 and for the sanitary and drainage system installed for the House in 1974.

He then made inquiries and discovered that the Land had been compulsorily acquired in 1988. Feeling aggrieved, Mr Ahmad wrote a letter on 5 February 2010 (\u201cthe MP Letter\u201d) to a Member of Parliament overseeing his constituency. In particular, he stated as follows: 14', '(a)\\u2003He and his family had lived in the House for more than five decades since the mid-1950s. About six months before 5 February 2010, he discovered that the Land had been acquired by the government in 1988 and his family was kept in the dark about it. He was later told by SLA to vacate the premises.', '(b)\\u2003He and his family never wanted and did not wish to impose any claim on the Land as they knew it was waqaf land and they believed that it was bequeathed for public use. They did not wish to challenge the government\u2019s right to the premises, nor did they send the MP Letter \u201cas a legal case to stake a claim on the right of the land\u201d. That said, they were upset at not being given any notice of the Acquisition all these years. They also \u201cconcede[d]\u201d that they were not in a capacity to challenge the vacation order and will eventually leave the House and let \u201cthe bulldozer to run it down\u201d.', '(c)\\u2003However, Mr Ahmad and his family asked for some gratuity payment or another house, for the effort they had put in all those decades in maintaining the Land at their own expense. Mr Ahmad also stated that they \u201cnever registered interest nor claimed ownership by adverse possession and [they] never regretted it as [they] never owned that land\u201d.', '14\\u2003The MP Letter was forwarded to SLA who received it on 11 February 2010. 15', 'The following then ensued.', '15\\u2003After some discussions between SLA and Mr Ahmad, SLA formally replied on 9 July 2012 to state that it was unable to accede to his request for a replacement house or payment of reasonable compensation, and also informed him that he was occupying the Land without lawful authority. SLA further stated that, on a strictly without prejudice basis, it was evaluating an ex gratia payment and would update Mr Ahmad. 16', 'SLA then offered an ex gratia payment of $17,882.05 to Mr Ahmad on 17 October 2012 and again on 20 November 2012, which he rejected. Mr Ahmad did not make any counter-offer. 17', '16\\u2003On 22 November 2013, SLA reiterated to Mr Ahmad that he (or Mr Adam) was not entitled to remain on the Land or the House regardless of whether they were a \u201cperson interested\u201d under the Land Acquisition Act. SLA reiterated its offer of ex gratia payment of $17,882.05. Alternatively, if they did not wish to relocate, SLA was willing to offer a Temporary Occupation Licence (\u201cTOL\u201d), on a without prejudice basis, for one year and which may be renewed on a yearly basis. 18', 'Mr Ahmad did not accept the ex gratia payment or the TOL.', '17\\u2003On 26 May 2014, SLA informed Mr Ahmad that he was in \u201cunauthorised and unlawful occupation of the Land\u201d as a trespasser and asked him to vacate the Land. 19', 'On 2 July 2014, SLA informed Mr Ahmad that it could not accede to his requests to extend time to vacate the Land and for a higher compensation amount. SLA stated that, on 22 November 2013, it had offered him an ex gratia payment of $17,882.05 which he did not accept. It would allow Mr Ahmad up to early August 2014 to vacate the Land. 20', '18\\u2003On 31 July 2014, Mr Ahmad\u2019s lawyers informed SLA for the first time that the Acquisition of the Land was carried out in breach of natural justice; that Mr Ahmad was the rightful owner in possession of the Land; and that Mr Ahmad was entitled to compensation assessed at the prevailing market rate as the \u201cadverse possessory owner\u201d. Mr Ahmad also requested SLA to inform him of the basis of assessment for the ex gratia payment. 21', '19\\u2003On 16 September 2014, SLA responded to re-open its offer of an ex gratia payment of $17,882.05, which could be sufficient for a down payment of a Housing and Development Board (\u201cHDB\u201d) studio apartment \u201cbased on the selling prices at recent BTO exercises\u201d and granted Mr Ahmad an extension of time to vacate the Land. The next day, the Attorney-General\u2019s Chambers (\u201cAGC\u201d) also responded to state the government\u2019s position that there was no breach of natural justice in the Acquisition of the Land, amongst other things. On 29 September 2014, SLA requested Mr Ahmad\u2019s cooperation to \u201cquickly vacate the Land in compliance with the law\u201d and offered an ex gratia payment of $36,000 to facilitate an amicable settlement of the matter if he would vacate the Land by 15 October 2014. 22', '20\\u2003On 3 October 2014, Mr Ahmad replied to AGC and SLA to say that he was \u201cnot disputing in respect of the acquisition as declared under [s]ection 5 of the [LAA 1987]\u201d. He maintained that no notice of the Acquisition was posted on the Land, as otherwise he would have sought timely legal advice and submitted his claims as an adverse owner of the Land. He also rejected SLA\u2019s offer of $36,000, but accepted SLA\u2019s earlier offer of a TOL. 23', '21\\u2003SLA then issued three successive TOLs that covered the period from 2014 to 2016 and Mr Ahmad was allowed to continue living at the House.

He sought the following:', '(a)\\u2003A declaration that he, either personally or as the personal representative of Mr Adam\u2019s estate, as at 12 September 1988, had acquired title by adverse possession to the Land, including the House, and that the rights and titles of the paper owners be extinguished.', '(b)\\u2003A declaration that the 1988 Award was invalid and should be set aside.', '(c)\\u2003A declaration that prior to or at 27 November 1987, Mr Ahmad and\/or Mr Adam was a person interested in the Land including the House.', '(d)\\u2003An order for a re-hearing under s 8 of the LAA 1987 for the assessment of compensation for the Acquisition which Mr Ahmad or Mr Adam\u2019s estate should be entitled to.', '23\\u2003Mr Ahmad did not challenge the Acquisition of the Land. 25', 'The High Court dismissed Mr Ahmad\u2019s claim and found that he had not acquired title to the Land by adverse possession.', '24\\u2003Mr Ahmad appealed against the decision in OS 397, in Civil Appeal No 4 of 2017 (\u201cCA 4\/2017\u201d). The Court of Appeal (\u201cCA\u201d) gave its judgment in Ahmad Kasim bin Adam (suing as an administrator of the estate of Adam bin Haji Anwar and in his own personal capacity) v Moona Esmail Tamby Merican s\/o Mohamed Ganse and others [2019] 1 SLR 1185 (\u201cCA Judgment\u201d). There, it considered the following issues:', '(a)\\u2003Whether Mr Ahmad or Mr Adam had acquired title to the Land or House by adverse possession.', '(b)\\u2003If the answer to (a) is \u201cyes\u201d, whether the Collector had failed to comply with the notice requirements under s 7 of the LAA 1987 or committed a breach of natural justice by failing to give notice of the Acquisition and inquiry to Mr Ahmad or Mr Adam.', '(c)\\u2003If the answer to (b) is \u201cyes\u201d, the remedy that Mr Ahmad or Mr Adam was entitled to.', '25\\u2003The CA found that Mr Adam was in factual possession of the House from 1955 to 1967 and had adversely acquired title to the House and the Plot, and that the rights of the paper owners were extinguished in 1967.', '26\\u2003The CA further stated that whether there was a breach of natural justice turned on whether notice may be deemed to have been served on Mr Adam by the posting of the notice on the Land and whether the LAA 1987 required notice to be affixed to the House. The CA did not find it necessary to resolve that issue because even if Mr Ahmad were to succeed in proving a breach of natural justice, he had no remedy before the court. In gist, the CA stated as follows.', '(a)\\u2003There was no legal basis to award monetary compensation to Mr Adam\u2019s estate as it was not prayed for in OS 397. Moreover, the LAA 1987 does not give the court jurisdiction to issue compensation at first instance. It is the Collector who makes an award after an inquiry, which is appealable to the Appeals Board and thereafter to the CA on a question of law.', '(b)\\u2003Compensation was not a suitable form of relief for a lack of notice or breach of natural justice in the making of the 1988 Award.', '(c)\\u2003The 1988 Award cannot be set aside by declaratory relief and an order for a fresh hearing by the Collector, as s 53 of the LAA 1987 imposes an absolute bar for declarations to set aside the Collector\u2019s award.', '(d)\\u2003Any compensation which Mr Adam may be entitled to would have been paid (if at all) as an award made by the Collector. The appropriate procedure for challenging the Collector\u2019s exercise of his powers is by judicial review, and the appropriate remedy for the alleged breaches would be to quash the 1988 Award and mandate the Collector to conduct a fresh inquiry.', '27\\u2003Finally the CA opined on the principles for assessing compensation in that case. If a breach of natural justice was established, Mr Ahmad\u2019s remedy was to be placed in a position as if Mr Adam\u2019s estate had received an award of compensation in 1988, with the time value of the award being accounted for through an appropriate adjustment or award of interest.', '28\\u2003Following the CA Judgment, AGC wrote to Mr Ahmad\u2019s lawyers on 29 April 2019, highlighting that SLA had offered compensation of up to $53,029 on an \u201copen\u201d basis, and although Mr Ahmad had claimed sums of $4.33m to $11.015m, SLA\u2019s offer remained opened for acceptance. Mr Ahmad did not accept the offer. 26', '29\\u2003On 10 July 2019, Mr Ahmad filed OS 881 (\u201cLeave Application\u201d).'"}

As will become apparent, the Defendant also owned or controlled a number of other companies relevant to the present dispute. These will be discussed where relevant below.', '9\\u2003SHGCC owns and has title to a 99-year leasehold estate in state land located at Sembulan District, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, with an area approximating 95.58 hectares or 238.63 acres (\u201cthe Sembulan Land\u201d). In the SA, the Defendant had warranted to the Plaintiff, inter alia, that SHGCC owned the Sembulan Land without encumbrances.', '10\\u2003The Plaintiff alleged that by a sale and purchase agreement signed on 21 March 2014 (\u201cthe S&P\u201d) but which was apparently back-dated to 1 March 2014, SHGCC agreed to sell to the Defendant\u2019s company, Omega Brilliance Sdn Bhd (\u201cOBSB\u201d), a portion of the Sembulan Land measuring 1.459 acres (\u201cthe Subject Land\u201d) for RM1,000 as consideration (\u201cthe Transaction\u201d). 1', 'The S&P was signed by the Defendant on behalf of OBSB which company had been incorporated on 7 February 2013.

The loan from Maybank was for RM118,250,000 (\u201cthe RM118.25m loan\u201d) while the loan from Bank Islam was for US$24m (\u201cthe US$24m loan\u201d). PHSB was owned and controlled by the Defendant until it was wound up by an order of court in Malaysia on 11 January 2012 for failing to pay its debts.

Osterly\u2019s shares are owned by the Defendant. Further, the evidence adduced in court from the Defendant was that Zarazilah held the 70% shares in Vibrant in trust for him. As the Defendant owned all the shares in Osterly (which held 30% of the shares in Vibrant) and Zarazilah held the remaining 70% in trust for him, that meant that the Defendant was the ultimate owner of and wholly controlled PHSB.', '13\\u2003Since at least 2002 (see [164] below), tenancy agreements had been entered into between SHGCC and PHSB on an annual basis for the rental of the Subject Land.

Under the settlement terms, PHSB would make payment of RM33.6m to Bank Islam to discharge the charge which Bank Islam held over PHSB\u2019s plant and machinery and all other securities. The settlement sum of RM33.6m, together with various fees payable under the settlement agreement for a total of RM34.438m, was paid to Bank Islam on or about 28 March 2013 by OBSB and\/or the Defendant on behalf of PHSB.

{"casename":"2020_SGHC_96","fact":"'4\\u2003Cheang incorporated Sassax on 3 July 2015. Sassax is in the business of physical commodities trading with specific emphasis on the trading of biodiesel, methyl esters and soap noodles. It has an issued share capital of US$500,000, to which Cheang and See made equal contributions. However, as noted earlier, the shares in Sassax are held in a 60:40 ratio by Cheang and See respectively. Both See and Cheang were directors of Sassax, up until 8 August 2018 when See was removed during Sassax\u2019s annual general meeting (\u201cAGM\u201d).', '5\\u2003When See and Cheang agreed to work together, Cheang, on See\u2019s behest, employed one Phoa Mei Mei (\u201cMei Mei\u201d) as Sassax\u2019s operations manager. Mei Mei was in charge of Sassax\u2019s shipping and cargo documentation, accounts and finances, and ensuring that Sassax had the requisite certification to conduct its trade. She had a \u201clong working relationship\u201d with See, having worked with him for eight years and 11 years separately in two different companies. In fact, while she was employed by and receiving salary from Sassax, she continued to work in two other companies which were both owned by See. These companies were namely Litrocom Global Trading Sdn Bhd (\u201cLitrocom\u201d) and Edo Chemical Sdn Bhd (\u201cEdo\u201d). Both companies were incorporated in Malaysia.', '6\\u2003It is common ground that the parties came together as shareholders to grow the business of Sassax. The parties had distinct roles in Sassax; See was primarily to source for raw materials for biodiesel production, such as cooking oil and waste palm oil, whereas Cheang was to be in charge of the day-to-day sales, management and operation of the business. It appears that business was initially smooth. Between 28 October 2015 and 29 July 2016, See sourced for 3,055.09mt of used cooking oil for Sassax to trade (though it should be noted that this was only a fraction of Sassax\u2019s total business \u2013 see [26] below). In the same period, Cheang managed to close sizeable deals with foreign clients.', '7\\u2003On 24 July 2017, Sassax entered into a loan facility agreement with TransAsia Private Capital Limited (\u201cTAPCL\u201d); this loan facility (\u201cthe TAPCL Facility\u201d) was for US$3m and was jointly and severally guaranteed by See and Cheang in their personal capacities. Cheang was given the sole mandate to operate the TAPCL Facility. The parties disagree over whether the TAPCL Facility was renewed on or about 8 August 2018 and whether Cheang had wrongfully applied See\u2019s signature to the personal guarantee that was to support the renewed facility. Sassax used the TAPCL Facility to make payments to its suppliers. All drawdowns on the TAPCL Facility were authorised by Cheang as the sole account signatory. It is common ground that drawdowns on the TAPCL Facility have to be supported by invoices from Sassax\u2019s supplier and purchaser, and the proceeds thereof were channelled through Cantrust (Far East) Limited (\u201cCantrust\u201d). Cantrust is a company used by TAPCL to ensure that the relevant proceeds of drawdowns are made to the proper parties, ie, TAPCL uses Cantrust to make payments directly to the relevant suppliers. This is pertinent to See\u2019s allegations against Cheang concerning one of the transactions that See seeks to impugn (see [15] below).', '8\\u2003Additionally, in August 2017, Sassax had brought a suit in the Taiwan courts against a forwarder of its goods, and obtained judgment for the sum of US$525,000 (the \u201cTaiwan judgment sum\u201d). An appeal was then brought against the said judgment; however, Sassax did not prevail in this appeal. The parties disagree as to whether the Taiwan judgment sum was recovered by Sassax and what has become of it. This forms part of See\u2019s claims against Cheang.', '9\\u2003The parties\u2019 relationship soured over time. Cheang became increasingly disgruntled with what she perceived as See\u2019s lack of contribution towards Sassax. Cheang was of the opinion that See had been spending more time on his other businesses (see [27] below), neglecting Sassax in the process. She held a similar view of Mei Mei, her discontent fuelled by the fact that Mei Mei at that point was still an employee of and receiving salary from Sassax. Both Cheang and See agree that the significant damage that Sassax\u2019s cargo on board the vessel Maersk Honam suffered as a result of fire on 8 March 2018 (\u201cthe Maersk Honam fire\u201d) marked a turn for the worse in their relationship. See asserts in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief that the Maersk Honam fire and the parties\u2019 fallout thereafter was \u201cthe final nail in the coffin\u201d for the parties\u2019 relationship; Cheang described it as the \u201cstraw that broke the camel\u2019s back\u201d. Cheang was unhappy that Mei Mei had insured Sassax\u2019s cargo with a policy that lacked a \u201cseller\u2019s interest\u201d clause, which effectively meant that the cargo was not covered for the loss caused by the fire. When Cheang discovered this, she desperately attempted to remedy the situation by reaching out to her contacts in the insurance industry; See accused her of being careless in these attempts, and asserted that she had compromised Sassax\u2019s interests as a result. This naturally did not go down well with Cheang who saw Mei Mei\u2019s failure to adequately insure the cargo as the real issue.', '10\\u2003The increasing strain in the relationship between See and Cheang is evident from a series of WhatsApp messages exchanged between them on 13 March 2018 where harsh words were used. It was in these WhatsApp messages that See first proposed the winding up of Sassax.', '11\\u2003The relationship reached a tipping point on or about 20 April 2018 when Cheang terminated Mei Mei\u2019s employment because of inter alia her belief that Mei Mei was at fault in failing to sufficiently insure the cargo. Cheang did not consult See. This deepened the rift between the parties. The multiple acrimonious events which occurred subsequently, and which led to the eventual commencement of this suit, will be stated briefly here; I will address them in greater detail at various parts of this judgment when describing their relevance to See\u2019s claims.', '12\\u2003Acumen Bizcorp Pte Ltd (\u201cAcumen\u201d) had been engaged by Cheang on behalf of Sassax to oversee the preparation and management of its accounting and other financial records. Upon See\u2019s request to view certain portions of Sassax\u2019s financial records, on or about 25 April 2018, one Yeap Wen Haur (\u201cYeap\u201d), an accountant in Acumen, had them sent to him. See discovered several transactions that he regarded as suspicious. The transactions identified by See related firstly to QHFOXX Limited (\u201cLimited\u201d), a company registered in the British Virgin Islands (\u201cBVI\u201d) on 21 July 2017. Cheang was the sole director and shareholder of Limited from 21 July 2017 to 28 July 2017. Upon her resignation as director, she transferred her shares to one Milton Leong Eng Hai (\u201cLeong\u201d), who then became the sole director and shareholder of Limited.', '13\\u2003See discovered that money had been transferred to Limited from Sassax\u2019s bank accounts \u2013 there were five alleged transactions, the details of which will be discussed later in this judgment (see [50] below). Cheang alleges that these payments were made to discharge debts owed by Sassax to Jaykem Sdn Bhd (\u201cJaykem\u201d) for goods sold; these debts had been allegedly assigned by Jaykem to Limited.', '14\\u2003Upon discovering these payments, See carried out a search on Limited with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (\u201cACRA\u201d) thinking that it was a Singapore incorporated company. Inevitably, the search on Limited drew a blank as it was a BVI registered company. However, the search revealed another company by the name of QHFOXX Pte Ltd (\u201cPte\u201d); Cheang was listed as the sole director and shareholder. Pte was incorporated on 22 March 2018.', '15\\u2003See also discovered several invoices relating to three entities: Biocom Energia SL (\u201cBiocom\u201d), Van Wijk & Olthius BV (\u201cVan Wijk\u201d) and Hung Da Green Energy Co Ltd (\u201cHung Da\u201d).

These invoices were as follows:', '16\\u2003In the same period, on 24 May 2018, there was a drawdown on the TAPCL Facility for the sum of US$51,554.24. The drawn down sum was paid to Hung Da (\u201cthe Hung Da drawdown\u201d) by Cantrust. See found it suspicious that the Biocom invoice and the Van Wijk invoice bore the same invoice number, and that the dates of the three invoices and the Hung Da drawdown were proximate in time.', '17\\u2003On 8 August 2018, during Sassax\u2019s AGM, Cheang voted against re-electing See as a director of Sassax and he was thus removed as a director. See was absent at this AGM. While there is disagreement over the circumstances preceding the AGM and whether they rendered the situation unfair for See, there is no allegation that the meeting was improperly conducted or in contravention of Sassax\u2019s Articles of Association.', '18\\u2003At all material times, See had access to Sassax\u2019s Dropbox folder. He continued to have access even after he was removed as a director of Sassax. The Dropbox folder is a virtual folder created by Acumen and hosted on an online cloud storage software, in which Sassax\u2019s financial documents such as its invoices were stored. See discovered in the Dropbox folder an invoice dated 17 September 2018 issued by Jiangsu Ying Hui Energy Technology Co Ltd (\u201cJiangsu\u201d) to Pte (\u201cthe Jiangsu invoice\u201d). This invoice was for the purchase of used cooking oil by Pte from Jiangsu, and the invoice amount was for US$256,692.40. The figures in the Jiangsu invoice, such as the amount of cooking oil purchased, bore close resemblance to the figures in a separate invoice issued by Sassax to Mavaser SL (\u201cMavaser\u201d) dated 17 September 2018 for US$257,520.44 (\u201cthe Mavaser invoice\u201d). See alleges that the sum of US$265,000 was drawn down from the TAPCL Facility and paid to Jiangsu to discharge Pte\u2019s debt to Jiangsu under the Jiangsu invoice.'"}

{"casename":"2020_SGHC_99","fact":"'5\\u2003Most of the facts were not in dispute and were set out in a Statement of Agreed Facts dated 2 May 2018. The worksite in question was a construction site where a 9-storey industrial building was being built at Henderson Road. The construction company named in the charge was contracted to supply labour and tools for the reinforced concrete structure work which included the construction of formwork, the fixing of reinforcement and concrete casting. The labour supplied would report to and receive instructions from the main contractor of the building project. The main contractor used traditional formworks and also rented a modular formwork system from a formwork supplier.', '6\\u2003The appellant was employed by the said construction company for about one and a half years before the incident. He was deployed as a formwork supervisor at the worksite for about three months before the incident. His duties included the deployment of workers and the assignment of work to them at the worksite.', '7\\u2003On 20 January 2014 at about 2pm, the appellant was supervising the lifting of Aluma formworks (which we shall refer to as \u201ctable forms\u201d) from the fourth to the fifth floor of the building under construction. The photograph in Annex 1 of this judgment shows what such a table form looked like. Md Mastagir Rana (Sohal) Md Aminur Rahman, a 25 year old Bangladeshi national (\u201cthe deceased\u201d), Khan Alam (\u201cKhan\u201d) and their co-workers in the construction company were involved in this endeavour.', '8\\u2003The table form was approximately 1,170kg in weight and measured approximately 6m in length, 3.6m in width and 4.8m in height. Before it was lifted from the fourth floor to the fifth floor, it would be positioned such that it protruded partially from the edge of the fourth floor. The photograph in Annex 2 of this judgment shows how a table form would be positioned prior to lifting. This was meant to facilitate the lowering of lifting gears through the openings on the top of the table form to secure it. This top portion of the table form is a platform known as a \u201csoffit top\u201d but for simplicity, we refer to the whole structure as a table form. The lifting gears would be lowered using a tower crane and they would be threaded through the openings. The table form rested on rollers (or wheels) to facilitate its movement. Each table form should be secured with two guide ropes and there would ordinarily be workers holding onto the table form to further secure it.', '9\\u2003At the material time, the deceased and Khan were working on the fifth floor while their co-workers were working on the fourth floor. The role of the deceased and Khan was to facilitate the threading of the lifting gears through the openings, by descending onto the top of the table form to guide the lifting gears through the openings. The workers on the fourth floor would then secure the lifting gears to the table form. Following this, the table form would be lifted up to the fifth floor.', '10\\u2003The workers started at about 7am on 20 January 2014. The workers had lifted seven or eight table forms in this manner before they stopped for lunch at noon. At about 1pm, they resumed the lifting works. After lifting another two or three table forms, the lifting work was paused as the tower crane had to be deployed for other operations. During this pause, the table form was secured with a guide rope.', '11\\u2003At about 2pm, when the tower crane became available again, the lifting work resumed. The deceased and Khan climbed out beyond the horizontal guard rails at the edge of the fifth floor and descended onto the top of the protruding table form. While both the deceased and Khan wore body safety harnesses, only Khan secured his safety harness to the guardrail before the descent. The deceased did not secure his safety harness to an anchorage point despite being reminded to do so by Khan.', '12\\u2003The deceased, who was in front of Khan, walked towards the openings near the top edge of the table form. As he did so, the table form suddenly started to tilt downwards, causing the deceased to slide off the table form and fall to the third floor vehicle ramp. The deceased was brought to a hospital where he succumbed to his injuries four days later.', '13\\u2003It was undisputed that previously and on several occasions, the appellant had instructed his workers to descend onto the top of similar table forms to perform the same task during lifting operations.'"}
