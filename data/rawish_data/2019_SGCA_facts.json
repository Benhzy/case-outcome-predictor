In essence, Hilton highlighted that Sun\u2019s claims concerned an agreement with an arbitration clause, that the Tribunal had already issued the Awards determining and dismissing the claims brought by Sun in the Maldivian Suit, and that enforcement of the Awards was still ongoing in the Civil Court. 32', '26\\u2003On 3 January 2017, Sun filed its response to Hilton\u2019s procedural objection. 33', 'The material passages of its response are as follows:', '27\\u2003Two points about Sun\u2019s response are of note. First, Sun stated that it was raising the \u201csame subject matter of the Management Agreement [that had] already been decided by an Arbitral Tribunal\u201d. Nonetheless, Sun\u2019s case was that its claim could be subject to a retrial or a revision as the Awards were based on a contract \u201cin breach of law\u201d. Secondly, Sun stated that it was not aware that there were any ongoing enforcement proceedings. We note at this juncture that one of the arguments raised by Hilton before us was that Sun had thereby misled the Maldivian courts as it knew that Hilton was pursuing the enforcement of the Awards in the Maldives. We elaborate on this below at [122].', '28\\u2003On 11 January 2017, an oral hearing took place before the Maldivian Civil Court, and the court directed that it would determine the procedural and\/or jurisdictional matters at the same time as the merits of the case. 34', 'This turn of events was not consistent with what Hilton had anticipated. It had been advised that the Maldivian Civil Court should either have declined jurisdiction over the Maldivian Suit or dismissed the claims altogether by terminating the proceedings. 35', '29\\u2003On 30 January 2017, Hilton submitted a written statement reiterating the procedural objection it had made earlier on 27 November 2016 but it did not specifically respond to the factual allegations made against it. 36', '30\\u2003On 6 February 2017, Sun submitted a further response. 37', 'It took the position that the Maldivian Suit pursued a separate claim that was unrelated to the enforcement of the Awards and was based on a different subject matter. Sun\u2019s case was that the Arbitration \u201cwas based primarily on the manner in which [Sun] terminated the Management Agreement\u201d, whereas the Maldivian Suit focused on the fraudulent misrepresentations which Sun relied on in entering into the Management Agreement. Moreover, Sun submitted that the Maldivian Suit fell into the category of previous cases where \u201ca court of the respective country will be able to hear a case where the agreement which contains the dispute resolution clause was one which was entered into fraudulently\u201d.', '31\\u2003Sun\u2019s response on 6 February 2017 ended with a request for \u201can opportunity to present witness statements and witnesses and for the case to be concluded as soon as possible\u201d. 38', '32\\u2003On 26 February 2017, a further hearing was held. No witnesses were heard, and arguments were presented on why Sun\u2019s claim under the Maldivian Suit should be heard irrespective of the Awards. Hilton restated its procedural objection. 39', '33\\u2003On 9 March 2017, the judge hearing the Maldivian Suit, Civil Court Judge Ali Naseer, delivered a three-page written judgment 40', '(ie, the March Judgment) holding that:', '(a)\\u2003Sun had made out its case on misrepresentation. The Management Agreement was executed between the parties \u201cthrough misrepresentations by [Hilton], whereby facts that were known or believed to be false was represented as true, relying upon which the other party entered into the [Management] Agreement\u201d.', '(b)\\u2003The Management Agreement was hence deemed to be void and unenforceable pursuant to Maldivian contract law.', '(c)\\u2003Hilton was to pay US$16,671,000 in damages to Sun.', '34\\u2003The March Judgment was delivered without the hearing of any witness (despite Sun\u2019s request: see [31] above) or any oral hearings on the substantive issues. Nor did the judge refer to the Arbitration and the Awards, even though both Sun and Hilton had addressed the procedural objection in respect of the Maldivian Suit. 41', '35\\u2003The March Judgment was then subsequently relied on by Judge Hassan Faheem Ibrahim to refuse Hilton\u2019s enforcement of the Awards, as set out in the June Judgment (see [22] above).', '36\\u2003On 21 March 2017, Hilton appealed against the March Judgment (\u201cthe Maldivian Appeal\u201d) and two hearings before the High Court of the Maldives were conducted on 1 and 8 August 2017. At the end of the hearing on 8 August 2017, the High Court stated that it would reserve judgment, which would be delivered at or following a final hearing. At the time of the parties\u2019 written submissions to this court, the High Court had not issued a judgment or made any other orders or directions in respect of the Maldivian Appeal. 42', '37\\u2003On 24 July 2017, after the June Judgment was delivered and about nine months after the commencement of the Maldivian Suit, Hilton filed Originating Summons No 845 of 2017 (\u201cOS 845\u201d) for: 43', '(a)\\u2003a permanent anti-suit injunction to restrain Sun from commencing and\/or proceeding with any action against Hilton in the Maldivian courts in relation to disputes arising from the Management Agreement;', '(b)\\u2003a declaration that the Awards are final, valid and binding on the parties; and', '(c)\\u2003a declaration that Sun\u2019s claim in the Maldivian Suit and any consequential proceedings resulting therefrom (including any appeals) are in breach of the arbitration agreement in the Management Agreement.', '38\\u2003The application was heard over four days in the months of October and November 2017. On 20 November 2017, which was the final day of the hearings, counsel for Hilton, Mr Toby Landau QC, sought to amend OS 845 to include a few additions (amendments reflected in italics): 44', '39\\u2003At the close of submissions, Mr Landau agreed to drop prayer (b)(ii). 45', '40\\u2003The Judge then made the following orders on the same date: 46', 'This order will be referred to hereinafter as the Injunctive Order. The Judge also declared that:', 'The Judge also ordered that:', '41\\u2003On 14 March 2018, the Judge delivered her grounds of decision (the \u201cJudgment\u201d).', '42\\u2003In her Judgment, the Judge first established that the Singapore courts have jurisdiction over Sun as OS 845 was validly served (Judgment at [23]\u2013[37]). Next, the Judge held that the Singapore courts also have the power to grant a permanent anti-suit injunction and that the source of this power is s 18(2) read with paragraph 14 of the First Schedule to the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) (\u201cSCJA\u201d) (Judgment at [43]).', '43\\u2003The Judge then turned to the question of whether she ought to exercise her discretion to grant the anti-suit injunction. Her reasoning may be summarised as follows:', '(a)\\u2003First, the Judge found that the Maldivian Suit re-litigated the same issues and relief that were already determined in the Arbitration. Hence, the commencement of the Maldivian Suit was a breach of Sun\u2019s negative obligation not to set aside or challenge the Awards other than through the setting aside procedures of the seat court. It was also vexatious and oppressive conduct in the sense that Hilton was being vexed by further proceedings in relation to the exact same claims that it had successfully defended in the Arbitration (Judgment at [58]\u2013[59]).', '(b)\\u2003The Judge noted that courts should be more circumspect in deciding whether to grant a permanent anti-suit injunction to restrain a party to an arbitration agreement from continuing with foreign proceedings because the question of whether such foreign proceedings constitute an abuse of the foreign court\u2019s process is primarily a matter for the foreign court to determine. Even though permanent anti-suit injunctions do not directly offend the principle of comity as they operate as a restraint on the party to the arbitration agreement rather than on the foreign court, practically, such injunctions do indirectly interfere with the foreign court\u2019s processes (Judgment at [56]).', '(c)\\u2003The Judge noted that applications for anti-suit injunctions had to be made promptly and before foreign proceedings were too far advanced (Judgment at [61]). In considering the issue of delay, both the length and the consequences of the delay had to be considered. The Judge agreed with Mr Maniam that Hilton should have brought the application in Singapore more expeditiously. The Maldivian Appeal had progressed too far to warrant an anti-suit injunction to restrain Sun from involvement in the pending appeal and beyond (Judgment at [63]). Hence, the Judge did not restrain Sun from \u201ccommencing or continuing with foreign proceedings\u201d, which was what Sun had originally sought for. Instead, she allowed Hilton\u2019s amended prayer for injunctive relief to enjoin Sun from relying on the March Judgment (and any judgments upholding the March Judgment). The Judge emphasised that her order \u201cha[d] the effect of an injunction but does not stop the appeal process\u201d [emphasis added] (Judgment at [64]).', '(d)\\u2003The Judge also stressed that the orders \u201c[did] not affect the right of [Sun] as an award debtor to defend enforcement proceedings pursuant to Maldivian law\u201d (Judgment at [22]).', '44\\u2003The Judge appeared to take the view that Hilton\u2019s delay and the March Judgment could be taken into account by limiting the injunctive relief to enjoin Sun from relying on the March Judgment or any decision upholding it. She made the following observation at [22]:', 'The Judge reiterated this view at [64] of the Judgment:', '45\\u2003During the oral hearing before us on 8 November 2018, Mr Maniam informed us that a further hearing has been fixed on 12 November 2018 before the High Court of the Maldives. We asked the parties to update us on any further developments and the parties did so in their letters dated 16 November 2018 (by Hilton) and 26 November 2018 (by Sun).', '46\\u2003At the 12 November 2018 hearing, the High Court of the Maldives informed the parties that there were changes to the bench of the High Court hearing the appeal. The bench had been reconstituted, with two out of the three judges replaced. The High Court of the Maldives then invited the parties\u2019 respective Maldivian counsel to address the court on the Maldivian Appeal.', '47\\u2003In the light of the orders made by the Judge, counsel for Sun was hesitant and expressed reservations as to whether he should address the court. Nevertheless, the High Court of the Maldives invited Sun\u2019s Maldivian counsel to do so, and only then did Sun\u2019s Maldivian counsel address the court briefly on the reasons as to why the March Judgment should be upheld. The parties were then informed that a judgment would be handed down at a further hearing.', '48\\u2003In their letters, the parties were not able to agree on the consequence of the conduct of Sun\u2019s Maldivian counsel during the hearing before the Maldivian High Court on 12 November 2018. Mr Landau considered that Sun had breached the orders made by the Judge, whereas Mr Maniam took the view that Sun had not, given that the Judge\u2019s order was not intended to \u201cstop the appeal process\u201d.', '49\\u2003In addition to the updates, Mr Landau also sought leave, by way of a letter dated 23 November 2018, to tender an additional authority, the case of Qingdao Huiquan Shipping Company v Shanghai Dong He Xin Industry Group Co Ltd [2018] EWHC 3009 (Comm) (\u201cQingdao\u201d), but without furnishing any further arguments.

On 14 March 2018, Mr Liu entered an appearance in the Suit.', '11\\u2003On 20 March 2018, Mr Liu applied by way of Summons No 1345 of 2018 (\u201cSUM 1345\u201d) to set aside the Service Order. He also prayed that, consequentially, the following injunctions be set aside:', '(a)\\u2003a Mareva injunction obtained by Shanghai Turbo ex parte on 15 September 2017, which restrained Mr Liu from dealing with his assets in Singapore, including his stake in Shanghai Turbo, up to the aggregate value of $30m (\u201cthe Mareva Injunction\u201d); and', '(b)\\u2003an injunction obtained by Shanghai Turbo ex parte on 18 January 2018, restraining Mr Liu from exercising the voting and other rights attached to his shares in Shanghai Turbo, so as to stop him from replacing the new board and discontinuing and\/or delaying the proceedings (\u201cthe Voting Injunction\u201d).', '12\\u2003When SUM 1345 was heard before the Judge, Shanghai Turbo conceded that cl 17 of the Service Agreement disclosed no valid express choice of law. It nevertheless maintained that service out of jurisdiction was permissible on the following grounds:', '(a)\\u2003Notwithstanding that cl 17 did not constitute a valid choice of law, objectively, Singapore law governed the Service Agreement. The claim was therefore brought in respect of a breach of a contract which \u201cis by its terms, or by implication, governed by the law of Singapore\u201d (O 11 r 1(d)(iii) of the ROC).', '(b)\\u2003Clause 17 constituted a submission to the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts. The claim was therefore brought in respect of a breach of a contract which \u201ccontains a term to the effect that that Court shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine any action in respect of the contract\u201d (O 11 r 1(d)(iv)).', '(c)\\u2003Clause 17 also meant that the claim was brought \u201cin respect of matters in which the defendant has submitted or agreed to submit to the jurisdiction of the Court\u201d (O 11 r 1(r)).', '13\\u2003Mr Liu, on the other hand, contended that cl 17 was invalid and unenforceable in its entirety, and that Chinese law governed the Service Agreement. He also submitted that China, rather than Singapore, was a more appropriate venue for trial of the Suit, and that Singapore was therefore forum non conveniens.'"}

{"casename":"2019_SGCA_13","fact":"'9\\u2003The Appellant began to visit CGH for various medical conditions from 2007 but was only clinically diagnosed with lung cancer in 2012. Three of these visits form the subject-matter of her claim in medical negligence and we set them out in a chronological fashion below.', '10\\u2003The Appellant first visited CGH\u2019s A&E department on 31 October 2007 and was attended to by Dr Yeo Cheng Hsun Jonathan (\u201cDr Yeo\u201d). She complained of lower chest pain and shortness of breath. The records reflected Dr Yeo\u2019s note that the Appellant was a non-smoker. Dr Yeo ordered a chest X-ray (\u201cthe October 2007 X-ray\u201d) and reviewed it with Dr Steven Lim Hoon Chin. The doctors noted an opacity in the right mid-zone of the Appellant\u2019s chest.', '11\\u2003Dr Yeo diagnosed the Appellant with a possible case of gastritis and prescribed medication accordingly. He then referred her to CGH\u2019s Respiratory Medicine SOC for good measure to review the opacity, even though the incidental finding of the opacity was unrelated to the symptoms that the Appellant presented with at the A&E department.', '12\\u2003The Appellant visited CGH SOC two weeks later on 15 November 2007 and was attended to by Dr Imran, who is, as aforementioned, a respiratory physician and the Second Respondent.', '13\\u2003At the consultation, Dr Imran reviewed the notes taken by Dr Yeo. Dr Imran noted that:', '(a)\\u2003the Appellant had visited the A&E department for centralised chest discomfort, nausea and mild breathlessness;', '(b)\\u2003upon examination, the Appellant had mild epigastric discomfort and her left lower anterior ribs were mildly tender on palpation, but her heart and lung sounds were normal; and', '(c)\\u2003the Appellant was a non-smoker.', '14\\u2003Dr Imran conducted a physical examination and noted that the Appellant did not complain of respiratory symptoms such as cough or blood in her sputum and did not report any appetite or weight loss. She also did not present with symptoms of infection such as fever or cough. As the October 2007 X-ray contained \u201can artifact or an opacity in the right mid zone\u201d, Dr Imran ordered a repeat chest X-ray in two views \u2013 an erect posterior anterior view (\u201cthe erect view\u201d) and a right lateral view.', '15\\u2003The two chest X-rays (\u201cthe November 2007 X-rays\u201d) were reviewed by Dr Imran in wet film format using a light box. At that time, the state of technology was such that Dr Imran was unable to digitally manipulate the November 2007 X-rays for size, contrast or brightness. Dr Imran\u2019s assessment was that the opacity noted on the October 2007 X-ray \u201cappeared to be resolving or had resolved on its own\u201d. Dr Imran thus gave the Appellant an open date for follow-up and advised the Appellant to return if she felt unwell.', '16\\u2003The Appellant went to the A&E department again on 29 April 2010. This time, she complained of right lower chest pain which started an hour before the consultation. The Appellant said that the pain worsened with deep inhalation which caused shortness of breath. When asked, she denied having respiratory symptoms such as cough, running nose and sore throat.', '17\\u2003Dr Yap, who was then a locum medical officer at the A&E department, attended to her.', '18\\u2003Dr Yap ordered an electrocardiogram (\u201cECG\u201d) and the April 2010 X-ray. The ECG tracings showed a normal sinus rhythm and ruled out any heart-related problems. The April 2010 X-ray showed an opacity over the right mid-zone of the Appellant\u2019s lungs. Upon noticing this opacity, Dr Yap checked the Appellant\u2019s medical records and retrieved the October 2007 X-ray and the November 2007 X-rays. At that time, no radiological reports had yet been made on the 2007 X-rays. Comparing the 2007 X-rays with the April 2010 X-ray, Dr Yap saw that the opacity had been present since 2007 and noted that it appeared to be stable as its size remained more or less the same. He did not take any measurements and came to this conclusion simply by comparing the X-rays using the naked eye. Dr Yap also observed that the opacity was regular, round and did not have the feathering or speckled appearance that were typical of malignant nodules. Dr Yap also ruled out pneumothorax as there were no indications suggesting this (such as a visible visceral pleural edge, ie, very thin sharp white line, or a collapsed lung). He also ruled out pneumonia and infective causes (ie, infections) as there were \u201cno focal or diffuse opacities, air bronchograms or parapneumonic effusions\u201d on the April 2010 X-ray. Dr Yap also took the view that the presenting symptoms of the Appellant on this visit were not related to the opacity. The opacity was therefore deemed to be an \u201cincidental finding\u201d, which is a term used to refer to findings that are not related to the patient\u2019s presenting symptoms.', '19\\u2003Partly given that the pain had only started in the hour prior to the Appellant\u2019s examination and because the Appellant had told Dr Yap that she had consulted a respiratory specialist, Dr Imran and was told she was fine, Dr Yap concluded that the opacity was an incidental finding (ie, unrelated to the patient\u2019s presenting symptoms), and came to the assessment that the pain was musculoskeletal in nature and unrelated to the opacity. We note that Dr Yap did not have Dr Imran\u2019s notes and relied on the Appellant\u2019s account of what Dr Imran had told her. Dr Yap then ran his diagnosis by the senior doctor, Dr Mohan Tiruchittampalam (\u201cDr Mohan\u201d), who was on duty to supervise junior doctors like Dr Yap. Dr Mohan agreed with Dr Yap\u2019s assessment that the nodule appeared to be stable and that the pain was musculoskeletal in nature. Dr Yap recommended that the Appellant be prescribed painkillers, discharged and told to return if the symptoms persisted or worsened. Dr Yap\u2019s own notes also requested that the patient be recalled if necessary after the X-ray report was out. Dr Mohan agreed. Dr Mohan was not called as a witness for the trial.', '20\\u2003Dr Yap prescribed painkillers for the Appellant and discharged her. She was also advised to return if the symptoms persisted or worsened. Dr Yap then sent the April 2010 X-ray for reporting. The report was issued in due course but it was never received personally by Dr Yap.', '21\\u2003The Appellant returned to the A&E department more than a year later on 31 July 2011 and was attended to by Dr Soh, who was then a medical officer. The Appellant complained of intermittent left lower ribcage pain that had persisted for almost one month. She informed Dr Soh that she had consulted a General Practitioner (\u201cGP\u201d) who advised her that her pain was due to inflammation of her ribcage. She had not obtained any referral and attended at the A&E department because the pain persisted. She was 32 years old then.', '22\\u2003Dr Soh ordered two chest X-rays in the erect and left oblique views (\u201cthe July 2011 X-rays\u201d). He also ordered an ECG. The ECG tracing came back normal and ruled out cardiac causes for her left rib pain.', '23\\u2003Dr Soh noted that no rib fractures or other abnormalities showed up on the July 2011 X-rays. Read together with the ECG, Dr Soh concluded that the July 2011 X-rays ruled out life-threatening conditions such as a cardiac event, pneumothorax or pulmonary embolism. According to Dr Soh, because he was focused on the left chest, which was the region the Appellant complained about, he did not notice the opacity in the right chest which appeared on the erect view of the July 2011 X-rays (the opacity cannot be seen in the left oblique view).', '24\\u2003Dr Soh\u2019s provisional diagnosis was that the Appellant had costochondritis, which is of musculoskeletal origin. He discussed his assessment with his supervising consultant, Dr Lim Ghee Hian (\u201cDr Lim\u201d). Dr Lim agreed with Dr Soh\u2019s views and Dr Soh discharged the Appellant with analgesics. Like Dr Yap, Dr Soh gave the Appellant the typical advice that she should monitor her symptoms and consult a GP or return to the A&E department should her symptoms worsen or persist.', '25\\u2003The July 2011 X-rays were sent for reporting and the report was prepared the next day, on 1 August 2011. Dr Soh did not receive the report and was unaware that the radiologist had detected the opacity in the right mid-zone of the Appellant\u2019s lung, noted that it was stable and had been there since April 2010, and recommended a follow-up of the opacity.', '26\\u2003The three visits described above form the subject matter of the Appellant\u2019s claim in medical negligence. She was subsequently diagnosed with lung cancer. We set out below the events that led to the diagnosis.', '27\\u2003About four months after she saw Dr Soh, the Appellant attended at Raffles Medical Clinic and was seen by Dr Melvyn Wong (\u201cDr Wong\u201d) on 28 November 2011. She complained of cough, breathlessness and blood in the sputum. Dr Wong explained that he suspected that the Appellant was suffering from upper respiratory tract infection and prescribed some cough medicine. He told the Appellant to return for a chest X-ray if the bleeding in the sputum did not go away.', '28\\u2003The Appellant returned three days later, on 1 December 2011, and said that she was still coughing and had blood in the sputum. Dr Wong ordered a chest X-ray to be taken (\u201cthe December 2011 X-ray\u201d) and noticed that there was a lesion in the right mid-zone of the lung. Dr Wong informed the Appellant that the X-ray would be sent for reporting before determining the next steps. The radiological report, which was prepared by consultant radiologist Dr Yeong Kuan Yuen, confirmed the presence of a round patch and ill-defined shadows at the mid-zone of the right lung and suggested that \u201cthis is likely to be the result of infection\u201d.', '29\\u2003The Appellant returned on 7 December 2011 to discuss the findings of the report. According to Dr Wong, the Appellant told him that a shadow had been pointed out to her during a previous visit to the A&E department in July 2011. Dr Wong decided to refer the Appellant to a respiratory physician at CGH SOC for further evaluation.', '30\\u2003The Appellant was seen by a respiratory physician, Adjunct Assistant Professor Sridhar Venkateswaran (\u201cProf Sridhar\u201d) at CGH SOC pursuant to Dr Wong\u2019s referral in relation to a right mid-zone lesion. In his consultation notes, Prof Sridhar recorded that \u201cthe serial lesion seen in 2007, 2010 and July [2011] appeared stable in size\u201d. He also noted the symptoms that the Appellant had presented with during the consultations with Dr Wong and recorded that the Appellant was still coughing and with blood in sputum. The Appellant was also identified to be a smoker for the first time.', '31\\u2003Prof Sridhar ordered chest X-rays and a Computed Tomography (\u201cCT\u201d) scan of the Appellant\u2019s chest, and gave the Appellant a further appointment to follow-up on the lesion.', '32\\u2003The CT scan was conducted by consultant radiologist, Dr Elizabeth Chan (\u201cDr Chan\u201d). In her report, Dr Chan noted that the CT scan revealed a nodule that appeared to be a pulmonary hamartoma (ie, benign lesion). Nonetheless, Dr Chan recommended that a biopsy be conducted to establish a \u201cbaseline histological correlation\u201d because of the nodule\u2019s interval increase in size, lobulated margins, pleural tagging and the Appellant\u2019s smoking history. The report concluded with the tag \u201cAbnormal \u2013 Further action or early intervention required\u201d. Dr Chan also explained that she had looked at and compared the previous X-rays to determine the growth of the nodule over time.', '33\\u2003A biopsy of the nodule was conducted by Dr Andrew Tan on 16 February 2012. The biopsy confirmed that the nodule was malignant and that the Appellant had lung cancer which originated from the lung.', '34\\u2003The Appellant saw Prof Sridhar again on 1 March 2012. Prof Sridhar explained the results of the biopsy to the Appellant and informed her that there was a good chance she could have a complete cure with a lobectomy. She was clinically staged as having Stage I lung cancer. Prof Sridhar referred the Appellant to surgical oncologist Adjunct Associate Professor Koong Heng Nung (\u201cProf Koong\u201d), who advised the Appellant to undergo a lobectomy to remove the part of her lung which had the tumour.', '35\\u2003The Appellant underwent a lobectomy in March 2012 and one-third of her right lung was removed. The tumour measured 3.0 cm and was diagnosed as Stage IIA non-small cell lung cancer. We pause to note that the exact mutation type of the cancer was not identified until much later, in 2014. Prof Koong and Dr Daniel Tan Shao Weng from the National Cancer Centre Singapore (\u201cDr Daniel Tan\u201d) followed up with medical care and treatment for the Appellant. She underwent chemotherapy for about four months. She also underwent CT scans every four months.', '36\\u2003The Appellant suffered a relapse in August 2014, when a CT scan revealed a new mass-like density in the right middle lobe. A biopsy confirmed that the lung cancer had progressed to Stage IV. In December 2014, Dr Daniel Tan carried out an analysis on the tumour that was resected in 2012 to determine its mutation type. Dr Daniel Tan explained that he was unable to run the necessary tests on the tumour that was present in 2014 because the size of the sample that was extracted in 2014 was too small. He therefore ran a retrospective analysis on the tumour that was removed via lobectomy in March 2012. The resected tumour from 2012 was found to be positive for a rare echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (\u201cEML4\u201d)-ALK gene rearrangement. In other words, the Appellant was retrospectively diagnosed only in 2014 to have been suffering from ALK-positive lung cancer in 2012. According to the Respondents\u2019 expert witness, Professor Goh Boon Cher (\u201cProf Goh\u201d), ALK-positive lung cancer is caused by a rare mutation whereby there is a translocation (relocation or re-arrangement) of a part of a chromosome, which brings together two genes which are usually not together. This results in the expression of a signalling receptor called the ALK. Significantly, Prof Goh stated that it is not known what induces this genetic event or transformation. When the ALK gene is activated, two receptors called the tyrosine kinase will bind to each other and can stimulate cell proliferation (ie, cause an increase in the number of cells). When the ALK gene is expressed on the cell membrane and activated, it is oncogenic (has the potential to cause cancer) and can transform what were initially benign cells into malignant or cancerous cells. Additionally, Prof Goh explained that the ALK gene is usually silenced in a normal human tissue. What this means is that the ALK gene is not expressed except under malignant conditions.', '37\\u2003In July 2015, the Appellant started on a second-generation ALK-inhibitor, Ceritinib and Nivolumab as part of a clinical trial. She remained on that until October 2016, when the cancer progressed to her brain and mediastinal lymph node. She was then taken off the clinical trial and managed with radio surgery, chemotherapy and Ceritinib. Since March 2017, the Appellant has been treated with a third-generation ALK-inhibitor, Lorlatinib.'"}
{"casename":"2019_SGCA_14","fact":"'5\\u2003The appellant, Mr Abhilash s\/o Kunchian Krishnan (\u201cMr Abhilash\u201d) is a minority shareholder of the second respondent, a company incorporated in Singapore called JCS-Vanetec Pte Ltd (\u201cJCSV\u201d). The first respondent, Mr Yeo Hock Huat (\u201cMr Yeo\u201d), is the majority shareholder of JCSV.', '6\\u2003Mr Abhilash is a businessman in the aerospace industry who had set up two companies, Vanilla International (S) Pte Ltd and Vanilla Aviation Pte Ltd (\u201cVanilla Aviation\u201d). Sometime in 2003, he intended to launch a business to manufacture stator vanes and other related parts for the aerospace industry in India. 1', '7\\u2003Mr Yeo is an engineer and entrepreneur, with more than 20 years of experience in the equipment and machine manufacturing industry. Over the years, he started up and developed several engineering companies. One such company was JCS Automation Pte Ltd, which specialised in the manufacture of precision cleaning ultrasonic equipment. Its business was eventually transferred to JCS-Echigo Pte Ltd (\u201cJCS-Echigo\u201d) in 1999. 2', '8\\u2003At the end of 2003, Mr Abhilash was introduced to Mr Yeo by some common friends. Mr Yeo was keen on branching into the aerospace industry. The two decided to do business together, setting up JCSV in 2004 (named JCS-Vanilla Pte Ltd at the time of incorporation). 3', '9\\u2003Initially, the 10,000 shares in JCSV were held as follows: 50.99% by Mr Yeo, 49% by Mr Abhilash (through Vanilla Aviation), and 0.01% by Ms Elise Hong (an officer of JCS-Echigo). Thereafter, JCSV issued more shares, resulting in changes in the parties\u2019 respective shareholdings. Currently, JCSV has 550,000 issued shares. Mr Yeo holds 78.8%, Mr Abhilash holds 13.9%, while one of Mr Yeo\u2019s companies, JCS Group Co Ltd (\u201cJCS Group\u201d), holds the balance 7.3%. 4', 'Mr Abhilash claims that this dilution in his shareholding was an attempt by Mr Yeo to cut him out of JCSV, but Mr Yeo claims that this was due to capital injections that he had made into JCSV. 5', '10\\u2003One capital injection is of particular interest in this appeal. On 20 November 2015, Mr Yeo (through JCS Group) injected $1.5m into JCSV in exchange for 40,000 shares. 6', 'This capital injection was significant because Mr Abhilash, both below and on appeal, claimed that the subscription of the 40,000 shares for payment of $1.5m was at an \u201cimplied price\u201d of $37.50 per share.', '11\\u2003Historically, JCSV has been a loss-making company. The audited financial statements for financial year 2007 to financial year 2015 show that JCSV has had negative earnings after tax in every single year except two \u2013 2011 and 2015. The earnings after tax for these two years were fairly modest \u2013 $32,879 and $113,661 respectively \u2013 while the annual net losses between 2010 and 2014 were more substantial averaging around $400,000. 7', 'The unaudited management accounts for financial year 2016, and January to May 2017 also indicate losses. 8', 'Mr Abhilash does not contend otherwise.', '12\\u2003Mr Abhilash initially brought this action against JCSV and Mr Yeo, alleging that Mr Yeo had conducted the affairs of JCSV in a manner oppressive to him, and in disregard of his interests as a shareholder within the meaning of s 216(1) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe Act\u201d). Mr Abhilash sought an order that his shareholding in JCSV be purchased by Mr Yeo on a fair market valuation. 9', '13\\u2003On the first day of the trial, the parties reached an agreement that Mr Yeo would purchase Mr Abhilash\u2019s shares. The trial on Mr Yeo\u2019s liability for oppression under s 216(1) of the Act thus did not proceed. The parties recorded a consent order dated 19 October 2017 to the effect that the issue of liability for minority oppression would be dispensed with, and that the court shall proceed to determine, at the trial, the fair market valuation of JCSV for the purposes of sale and purchase of Mr Abhilash\u2019s shares in JCSV (\u201cthe Consent Order\u201d). Consequently, the trial proceeded for the sole purpose of examining the expert evidence that the parties had adduced to determine the valuation of JCSV, and flowing from that how much Mr Yeo ought to pay Mr Abhilash for his shares in JCSV. 10', '14\\u2003Mr Abhilash\u2019s case on appeal is largely premised on an offer by a third-party to purchase all the shares in JCSV for $50m. Mr Abhilash claims that this offer was the best evidence of JCSV\u2019s market value, and that the Judge erred in disregarding it. 11', '15\\u2003The offer was from a Chinese entity named Shanghai Ossen Aviation Technology Co, Ltd (\u201cShanghai Ossen\u201d). Shanghai Ossen was described by Mr Yeo as part of a conglomerate with annual sales exceeding RMB10b, and which has won major scientific and technological awards. 12', 'Between 2015 and 2016, Mr Yeo was involved in discussions with Shanghai Ossen regarding the possibility of the latter acquiring JCSV. As a result of their discussions, two key documents were produced.', '16\\u2003The first is a Memorandum of Understanding sent by way of email on 10 September 2015. Among other things, the Memorandum of Understanding provided as follows: 13', '(a)\\u2003Mr Yeo and Mr Abhilash, as sellers, intended to sell \u201ccertain percentage shares\u201d of JCSV, while Shanghai Ossen, as buyer, intended to acquire such shares.', '(b)\\u2003Shanghai Ossen would be permitted to carry out an exhaustive due diligence over JCSV and its subsidiaries as to \u201clegal, tax and financial, technical, labour and environmental matters\u201d.', '(c)\\u2003Neither party was under any legal obligation to enter into any form of legally binding transaction document.', '(d)\\u2003Shanghai Ossen\u2019s \u201cexpected price for the sale of 100% shares of [JCSV]\u201d was $50m, which was \u201csubject to the results of Due Diligence\u201d.', '17\\u2003The Memorandum of Understanding was followed by a document titled \u201cInvestment Framework Agreement\u201d. A version in Chinese was sent by way of email on 3 June 2016, and an English version was sent four days later on 7 June 2016. 14', 'Although it was contemplated in the Memorandum of Understanding that due diligence checks would be carried out by Shanghai Ossen, no such steps were in fact taken. 15', 'Mr Abhilash does not contend that due diligence had in fact been done. 16', '18\\u2003The Investment Framework Agreement set out the proposed structure for the acquisition of the JCSV shares. It included three parties in addition to Shanghai Ossen and JCSV. They were Shanghai Jiashi Aerospace Power Technology Co, Ltd (\u201cShanghai Jiashi\u201d), JCS INVB Pte Ltd (\u201cJCS INVB\u201d), and JCS Aero Technology Pte Ltd (\u201cJCS Aero\u201d). Shanghai Jiashi is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Shanghai Ossen. The Investment Framework Agreement contemplated that Shanghai Jiashi would own 100% of the shares in JCS Aero, which in turn would own 100% of the shares in JCSV. Among other things, the Investment Framework Agreement provided as follows: 17', '(a)\\u2003Shanghai Jiashi would acquire 100% of the shareholding in JCS Aero from JCS INVB. This would give Shanghai Jiashi indirect control over 100% of the shareholding in JCSV.', '(b)\\u2003In consideration of JCS INVB transferring 100% of the shares in JCS Aero to Shanghai Jiashi, Shanghai Jiashi would pay $50m to JCS INVB as the transfer price. The transfer price was stipulated to consist of two parts. The first part was 20% of the transfer price (ie, $10m), which would be transferred to JCS INVB\u2019s bank account and could be drawn down by JCS INVB. The second part, the other 80% of the transfer price (ie, $40m), had to be used by JCS INVB to acquire equity in Shanghai Jiashi.', '(c)\\u2003The transfer price of $50m was expressed to be a \u201ctentative price\u201d which \u201cmay be adjusted according to the results of due diligence conducted or to be conducted by Shanghai Jiashi on finance, technology and law\u201d.', '(d)\\u2003JCS INVB, using $40m out of the transfer price, would acquire a 42% stake in Shanghai Jiashi. The other 58% stake would be held by Shanghai Ossen.', '(e)\\u2003Among other things, it was a condition precedent for the transfer of shares in JCS Aero to Shanghai Jiashi that Shanghai Jiashi complete its due diligence, and that no material adverse difference would be found between the result of the due diligence and the information previously disclosed to it or Shanghai Ossen.', 'A diagram of the corporate structure of the companies contemplated under this transaction is set out below.', '', '', '', '', '', '19\\u2003In summary, the Investment Framework Agreement contemplated a purchase price of $50m for the shares in JCSV (indirectly through JCS Aero). The $50m comprised $10m in cash and $40m in equity in Shanghai Jiashi, which would be a joint venture company with Shanghai Ossen. Ultimately, neither the Memorandum of Understanding nor the Investment Framework Agreement was signed. Nevertheless, the transaction that was contemplated (as set out in this paragraph) is what was referred to by the Judge and the appellant as \u201cthe Shanghai Ossen offer\u201d. We will adopt this term. For present purposes, it is important to highlight two significant features of the Shanghai Ossen offer. First, it was not an unconditional offer \u2013 it was always subject to due diligence and second, the consideration is not $50m in cash but $50m in two components \u2013 $10m in cash and the balance $40m to be reinvested into the joint venture company. The significance of these two features in considering Mr Abhilash\u2019s new argument for the appeal will be elaborated below.', '20\\u2003By a letter dated 21 July 2016, Mr Yeo informed Mr Abhilash of the Shanghai Ossen offer, and sought his views as to whether he was agreeable to selling his shares to JCS Aero as part of the plan. Mr Yeo explained that under the terms of the offer, the existing shareholders of JCSV would receive $10m in cash, and a 42% stake in Shanghai Jiashi. This would require that the current shareholders of JCSV sell their shares to JCS Aero. They would in turn own shares in JCS INVB in the same proportion as their shareholding in JCSV. The $10m received by JCS INVB would be distributed to the shareholders in proportion to their shareholding. Mr Yeo went on to state that JCSV was in a weak financial position, having made net losses over the past three years. 18', '21\\u2003The parties procured experts to give evidence at the trial on the valuation of JCSV. Mr Abhilash called Mr Bakthavatsalam Sridhar Rao (\u201cMr Rao\u201d) as his expert on the valuation of JCSV, while Mr Yeo called Mr Thio Khiaw Ping Kelvin (\u201cMr Thio\u201d). Each of the experts filed a report in support of their respective positions.

Mr Thio\u2019s valuation yielded a mere $109,589 on a net assets basis, and, in his view, an income approach was simply not viable given JCSV\u2019s loss-making history.

His mental age was assessed by one expert to be eight years old, and by another to be between eight and ten years old. It appears that the respondent was just 11 when he first committed an offence. He was thereafter placed on a one-year guidance programme, which he completed. Between the middle of 2013 and 2014, he committed a series of offences which culminated in these proceedings.

Three months later, in July 2014, he breached that condition by acquiring an EZ-link card of unknown value which he had reason to believe was stolen property. In the same month, he also burgled another flat and stole $300 in cash as well as seven packets of cigarettes. The next day, together with three friends, he stole a mobile phone, six packets of cigarettes and $1,500 in cash from a stranger.', '5\\u2003The respondent was arrested shortly after.

In September 2014, he appropriated a friend\u2019s skateboard, and in October 2014, he grabbed the buttocks of a 21-year-old girl. For these actions, he was charged under the Penal Code with criminal breach of trust under s 406 and outrage of modesty under s 354(1) respectively. These were, respectively, the ninth and the tenth charges in this case. He was arrested, and later released on bail again.', '7\\u2003On 21 November 2014, the respondent was distributing flyers with his brother and a friend in Bukit Panjang.

He was not wearing a condom at that time. Again, the victim felt pain. He then ejaculated on her underwear. But her ordeal was not over. He went through her belongings and found a comb that was about 15cm long. He inserted it into her vagina. After taking it out, he placed it into her mouth. He had no reason to believe that she consented to his actions, but decided to have his way because, in his own words, he \u201cfelt horny\u201d. He then said, \u201cBye bye\u201d, and left the scene.', '11\\u2003The victim returned to her flat and began to cry. Her family later brought her to make a police report.

His bail was revoked and he has been remanded at the Singapore Boys\u2019 Home since then.', '12\\u2003For inserting his finger and the comb into the victim\u2019s vagina, the respondent was charged under the Penal Code with two counts of sexual assault by penetration under s 376(2)(a), which is punishable under s 376(3). For threatening to use a knife and penetrating the victim\u2019s vagina with his penis, the respondent was charged under the Penal Code with one count of aggravated rape under s 375(1)(a) read with s 375(3)(a)(ii). These three charges were the third, fourth and second charges respectively in this case. There was originally a first charge for rape, but that was later withdrawn.', '13\\u2003In April 2015, all ten charges were laid against the respondent in the Youth Court.

The other two sons are Wong Kie Yik (\u201cWKY\u201d) who was the \nsecond respondent  in both CA 44 and CA 45, and Wong  Kie Chie (\u201cWKC\u201d)  \nwho was  the third respondent in CA 44.\n4 WKN  was a shareholder and director of Trillion, Double Ace and \nFaxlink (collectively \u201cthe Companies\u201d).  He ran all the Companies  until March \n2011 when he fell ill with cancer.  WKN  passed away on 11 March 2013.\nThe business empire\n5 The Companies  originally formed  the Singapore section of the business  \nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nMa Wai Fong  Kathryn v Trillion Investment Pte  Ltd [2019]  SGCA  18\n3empire of Datuk Wong  who was a highly successful Malaysian businessman. \nHis empire covered a wide array  of businesses including timber logging and \nharvesting, land development, trading,  manufacturing, oil palm plantations, oil \nmilling, the hotel business and travel services.  WTK Realty  Sdn Bhd was the \nflagship company of the group which  comprised over 50 companies operating \nin jurisdictions like Australia,  Liberia, the British Virgin Islands, Papua New \nGuinea and Singapore.\n6  Datuk  Wong managed all his companies, including Trillion and Double \nAce, from their respective inceptions till about  1990 when he suffered a stroke.  \nWKN then took over Datuk Wong\u2019s position and managed the business  empire  \nuntil he  himself fell ill  in 2011.\nTrillion and Double Ace\n7 Trillion was incorporated in Singapore in 1979 and was brought  into \nDatuk Wong\u2019s group by WKY in 1982. The purpose of the acquisition  was to \noperate Trillion  as an investment holding company  which invested in real estate. \nAround 1984, Trillion purchased the office  unit known  as 3 Shenton Way, #20-\n08, Shenton House, Singapore (the \u201cTrillion unit\u201d). The purchase  price  was \napproximately $1.139 million. Ever  since  acquiring  it, Trillion has been  renting \nthe Trillion  unit to Double  Ace for $5,000 a month. From the accounts,  however,  \nit appeared that Double  Ace had not paid the rent and the same was reflected in \nTrillion\u2019s accounts as a debt due.\n8  As at 9 June 2017, Trillion had an issued share capital of $150,000 \ndivided into 150,000 shares of $1 each. WKY, the Appellant (as executrix  of \nWKN\u2019s estate) and WKC are recorded  as the registered shareholders, each \nholding 50,000 shares in Trillion.\nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nMa Wai Fong  Kathryn v Trillion Investment Pte  Ltd [2019]  SGCA  18\n49 Double  Ace was incorporated  on 15 May 1972  by Datuk Wong  and his \nbrother-in-law, Mr Lau Hieng King, who were the initial subscribers in equal \nshares. Double Ace was set up for the purpose of trading in spare parts  to supply \nother companies  in the group. Subsequently, Double Ace also acted  as an agent \nfor some of these other companies  and generated healthy revenues for the \nservices it  rendered.\n10 As for Double Ace\u2019s shareholding,  sometime  after 24 April  1973 WKY  \nbecame a shareholder and later WKN  became  a shareholder as well as a director. \nPresently, Double  Ace has an issued share  capital of $50,000 divided  into \n50,000 ordinary shares of $1 each.  The Appellant (as executrix  of WKN\u2019s \nestate) holds 19,500 shares, WKY  holds 19,998 shares, WKY\u2019s son holds two \nshares while the remaining 10,500 shares  belong to other members  of Datuk  \nWong\u2019s family.\n11 In the late 1970s,  Double Ace purchased  the office unit known as \n3 Shenton Way, #20-07, Shenton House, Singapore  (the \u201cDouble Ace unit\u201d) for \napproximately $71,000. Double Ace did not use these premises  as its office but \ninstead rented them  out for approximately  $2,500 per month. As mentioned, \nDouble Ace is the tenant of the Trillion  unit and uses the same as its office \naddress. According to Ong Kim Siong (\u201cMr Ong\u201d),  a director of Double Ace, \nat about the time the proceedings commenced,  its liability to Trillion  for unpaid \nrental was in the vicinity of $890,169.44. As we understood the position, no \nrental had been  paid by Double Ace thereafter and therefore the liability  had \nincreased.\n12 Prior to the death of WKN,  the Appellant  was not a shareholder of \nTrillion or Double Ace and was never  involved in the management  of these two \ncompanies.\nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nMa Wai Fong  Kathryn v Trillion Investment Pte  Ltd [2019]  SGCA  18\n5The dispute below\n13  Since WKN\u2019s  passing, the Appellant and the rest of Datuk Wong\u2019s \nfamily have been embroiled in litigation across multiple jurisdictions. \nAccording to WKY, as at 30 August 2017, a total of 69 legal proceedings had \nbeen filed by the parties in Malaysia, the British Virgin Islands and  Singapore.\n14 In August 2017, the Appellant  filed the originating  summonses  \nHC\/OS 163, 164 and 165 of 2017 to wind up Trillion, Double Ace and Faxlink \nrespectively under s 254(1)(i) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (the \n\u201cAct\u201d). The Appellant gave three  grounds for her contention that the Companies  \nshould be wound up under the section.\n15 First, the Appellant  alleged that the relationship of trust and confidence  \nshared between WKN,  WKY and WKC (\u201cthe  Wong Brothers\u201d) in the running \nof the Companies extended to the members of their respective  families.  This \nrelationship of trust and confidence had irretrievably  broken down after WKN\u2019s  \npassing as evidenced by the Appellant\u2019s  exclusion from participation in the \nmanagement of the Companies despite  her request  to be made a director of the \nCompanies.\n16 Second,  the Appellant alleged that there had been  mismanagement on \nthe part of the directors  and\/or  employees of the Companies. The Appellant \ncontended that the directors and\/or employees  of the Companies  were \n\u201cobscuring their financial misappropriations\u201d. As such, the Appellant  argued  \nthat a private liquidator  should be appointed to investigate the Companies\u2019 \naffairs.\n17 Finally, she alleged that there  had been  a loss of substratum of the \nCompanies. In particular, the Companies had abandoned  the businesses which \nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nMa Wai Fong  Kathryn v Trillion Investment Pte  Ltd [2019]  SGCA  18\n6each was set up and\/or acquired to do.\n18 In reply, the Respondents (being WKY, WKC, WKY\u2019s son and the \nrespective companies) denied all the allegations  made by the Appellant in the \nthree winding  up applications. First,  the Respondents argued that the \nrelationship of mutual  trust and confidence  in the running of the Companies  had \nonly been amongst the Wong Brothers. When  WKN passed away,  this \nrelationship ended. Second, there  was no mismanagement of the Companies  \nsuch that a winding up on just and equitable grounds was warranted.  Finally, \nthere was no loss of substratum  in respect of any of the Companies save for \nFaxlink. In any event, the Respondents  submitted that the Articles  of \nAssociation (the \u201cArticles\u201d) of Double Ace and Faxlink  contained  an exit \nmechanism which the Appellant should utilise before filing  a winding up \napplication. WKY and WKC also argued  that the court should order that the \nAppellant\u2019s shares in the Companies be bought out instead of ordering the \nwinding up the Companies.\nThe decision  below\n19 The Judge dismissed the appellant\u2019s application to wind up the \nCompanies on the grounds given  in Ma Wai Fong Kathryn v Trillion Investment \nPte Ltd and other matters [2018] SGHC  88. The Judge\u2019s  decision is summarised \nbelow.\n20 First, on the Appellant\u2019s argument that there had been a breakdown of \nmutual trust and confidence between the Appellant and the other shareholders  \nof the Companies, the Judge found that although the Companies  were  run on \nthe basis  of mutual  trust and confidence  amongst the Wong  Brothers,  this \nrelationship did not extend to the Appellant  as executrix of WKN\u2019s estate.\nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nMa Wai Fong  Kathryn v Trillion Investment Pte  Ltd [2019]  SGCA  18\n721 Secondly, on the Appellant\u2019s  contention that there  had been \nmismanagement of the Companies on the part of the Companies\u2019 directors \nand\/or employees,  the Judge found that there was no ground  to suspect any lack \nof probity  on the part of the directors of the Companies. The facts  raised  by the \nAppellant were mere  suspicions.\n22 Finally, as for the Appellant\u2019s  contention that there had been a loss of \nsubstratum of the Companies, the Judge found that the Appellant did not have \nany standing to raise this argument. On the facts, the Judge found that it could \nnot be said that the Appellant\u2019s participation in the Companies  was predicated \non the assumption that the Companies would be conducting any specific \nbusiness. As for Faxlink, although it was a dormant company, as the Judge had \nalready found that the Appellant had no basis to insist on participating  in the \nmanagement of the Companies, the demise  of Faxlink should  be left to the \nmanagers of Faxlink.\n23 Accordingly,  the Judge held that there  was no injustice  or unfairness \nwhich warranted the winding up of the Companies under s 254(1)( i) of the Act.\nIssues that arose in these"}

As members, they were eligible to participate in MBS\u2019 marketing promotions. One such promotion was the \u201cSands Bonus Dollars Rewards\u201d promotion, under which eligible members were entitled to a limited number of Sands Bonus Dollars (\u201cSBDs\u201d) that could be redeemed for an equivalent number of Free Play Credits (\u201cFPCs\u201d) at electronic kiosks situated in the casino. The FPCs had no monetary value in themselves, but could be used for gambling at the gaming machines located in the premises. For this purpose, each EPC was credited with a value of $1.', '9\\u2003On 13 April 2014, the Applicant swiped her membership card at a kiosk in the casino and selected the \u201cSands Bonus Dollars Rewards\u201d icon. The kiosk screen showed \u201cYou are eligible for $100 of Free Play Offer! Redeem offer now?\u201d The Applicant selected \u201cYes, Redeem Now\u201d and entered her personal identification number. An error message appeared which showed: \u201cSorry, service seems to be unavailable. Please try after sometime\u201d. She exited the screen showing the error message, and tried to swipe her card several more times, but the same error message continued to appear. Thereafter, she left the casino.', '10\\u2003The next day, 14 April 2014, the Applicant returned to the casino. She swiped her card at a kiosk and discovered that $800 worth of FPCs had been credited into her account. Apparently, on the previous day, even though an error message had showed each time the Applicant tried to redeem her FPCs, 100 FPCs were in fact credited to her account on every such occasion. Using these FPCs, the Applicant gambled at electronic roulette machines in the MBS casino. At the end of each game, she was given a paper slip stating her winnings which she then encashed at \u201cTicket In, Ticket Out\u201d (\u201cTITO\u201d) machines.', '11\\u2003Later that same day, the Applicant called the Co-Offenders and asked them to join her at the casino.

The Offenders then repeated numerous cycles of swiping, gambling, and encashing their winnings using the Applicant\u2019s membership card.', '12\\u2003In total, the Applicant\u2019s membership card was swiped 10,293 times during the seven-day period from 14 to 20 April 2014 leading to 1,029,300 FPCs being credited to the card. These FPCs were utilised for games at various electronic roulette machines at the casino, netting the Offenders winnings which they were able to encash at the TITO machines. In total, the Offenders obtained $875,133.56 (\u201cthe Monies\u201d) from the TITO machines.', '13\\u2003On 20 April 2014, the Applicant was detained by the police. She managed to message the Co-Offenders that the \u201cpolice [were] coming\u201d. The Co-Offenders then, on their own accord, took $500,000 of the Monies to the casino at Resorts World Sentosa (\u201cRWS\u201d) where they converted the sum into casino gambling chips and expended them on table games. The winnings from these plays were then transferred to a third party. The Co-Offenders were subsequently arrested at RWS.', '14\\u2003Based on evidence given in the trial, the precise number of FPCs that a member was eligible to redeem depended on various factors such as the frequency of his casino visits and his value to the MBS casino, and it was to be solely determined by MBS.

The Applicant obtained more FPCs than were due because of a system error at the kiosks which went undetected by MBS until 20 April 2014.', '15\\u2003Arising from the facts above, one charge for abetment by conspiracy to commit dishonest misappropriation, under s 403 read with s 109 of the Code, was brought against each of the Offenders.

He had also engaged Jaguar Express Logistics Pte Ltd (\u201cJaguar Express\u201d), which provides transportation and warehousing services, to unload the rosewood when the vessel berthed in Singapore, repack them into containers and truck them to another port managed by the Port of Singapore Authority (\u201cPSA Port\u201d).', '19\\u2003On 28 February 2014, the consignment of rosewood entered Singapore waters on board the vessel MV Oriental Pride (\u201cthe vessel\u201d) from Madagascar. Around that time, AVA officers received information that the vessel was believed to be carrying an illegal export of timber from Madagascar. The relevant shipping and customs-related documents contained the following information:', '(a)\\u2003The rosewood was shipped under two bills of lading. The port of discharge was stated as Singapore and the consignee and notify-party was \u201cKong Hoo Private Limited\u201d. The cargo particulars furnished by the shipper was \u201cpieces de BOIS\u201d, the French word for wood.', '(b)\\u2003The cargo manifest stated that the vessel was carrying a total of 30,657 logs of wood and the port of discharge was Singapore. The consignee was Jaguar Express. The manifest was submitted to Jurong Port\u2019s online system by Jaguar Express\u2019s stevedore, B.S.K. Stevedoring Pte Ltd, before the vessel berthed in Singapore. The Harmonised System Code (\u201cHS Code\u201d) entered for the goods to be shipped was \u201c44(01\u201305)\u201d, which related to wood generally instead of the specific HS Code for rosewood (which would be 44039990).', '(c)\\u2003The pre-arrival notification stated that the vessel was carrying logs. It was submitted to the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (\u201cMPA\u201d) by Mr Ernest Wee Pan Ann (\u201cMr Wee\u201d) on behalf of the vessel\u2019s manager, AMMShips Pte Ltd, on 26 February 2014, two days before the vessel entered Singapore waters.', '20\\u2003On 11 March 2014, the vessel berthed at the Jurong Port in Singapore. Over the next three days, Jaguar Express unloaded 6,164 rosewood logs from the vessel (\u201cthe unloaded rosewood\u201d) and moved them to a yard within the Jurong Port (J16). It is not disputed that the rest of the logs (\u201cthe remaining rosewood\u201d) were also intended to be unloaded to the yard but before this could be done, AVA officers boarded the vessel on 14 March 2014 and subsequently seized all the unloaded and the remaining rosewood. The shipment was subsequently ascertained to comprise 29,434 logs of rosewood in total, and not 30,657 logs as indicated in the export documents (see [23] below).', '21\\u2003The applicants\u2019 case is that they had intended to import the rosewood into Hong Kong. They did not provide any details of their buyer in Hong Kong and the country and the buyer was not stated in any of the shipping or export documents. However, two months earlier in January 2014, Jaguar Express had provided them with quotations for (a) transhipment of cargo from Jurong Port to PSA Port (including unloading, repacking, transportation) and (b) ocean freight charges from Singapore to Hong Kong and the possible vessels for that route. It is not disputed that the applicants had not selected a vessel departing to Hong Kong, had not made any confirmed bookings for the voyage and Jaguar Express\u2019s task was limited to bringing the consignment from Jurong Port to PSA Port.', '22\\u2003AVA commenced investigations into the seized rosewood. The rosewood did not have the following import permits:', '(a)\\u2003An import permit from AVA to import the rosewood into Singapore; and', '(b)\\u2003An import permit from the Hong Kong authorities for import of the rosewood. Hong Kong had not regulated this and thus did not require an import permit for rosewood at the material time. This is not disputed by the parties.', '23\\u2003As for country of export permits, during the investigations, the applicants passed AVA a set of documents ostensibly showing that they had been authorised to export the rosewood from Madagascar (collectively the \u201cMadagascan export documents\u201d). These comprised:', '(a)\\u2003a letter from the Director-General for the Madagascan Forestry Ministry dated 10 March 2010 authorising the export of 5,000 tonnes of rosewood (\u201cthe 2010 authorisation letter\u201d). This was the only document that mentioned rosewood specifically instead of \u201cwood\u201d;', '(b)\\u2003two documents dated 17 and 18 February 2014, purportedly from the Madagascan Forestry Ministry authorising a total of 3,065 cubic metres (30,657 logs) of \u201cwood\u201d (the type of wood was not specified) to be exported for commercial purposes (\u201cthe 2014 authorisation documents\u201d);', '(c)\\u2003two certificates of declaration and verification on forest products for export for a total of 3,065 cubic metres of \u201cwood\u201d dated 17 and 18 February 2014 (\u201cverification for export documents\u201d);', '(d)\\u2003two certificates of origin for 3,065 cubic metres of \u201cwood\u201d dated 17 and 18 February 2014 (\u201ccertificates of origin\u201d); and', '(e)\\u2003two phytosanitary certificates for 30,657 pieces of \u201cwood\u201d dated 17 and 18 February 2014 (\u201cphytosanitary certificates\u201d).', '24\\u2003AVA doubted the authenticity of the Madagascan export documents for two main reasons. First, the documents did not comply with CITES procedure. Second, Madagascar had imposed a zero export quota on rosewood and it was unclear whether this was still in force. If so, the applicants could not have been authorised to export the rosewood. After Madagascan rosewood was listed in CITES Appendix II in March 2013, the Madagascan government imposed a zero export quota on rosewood from 13 August 2013 to 13 February 2014. On 26 February 2014, about two weeks after the end of the zero export quota period, a notification was sent to the CITES member states stating that the Madagascan government had extended the zero export quota until 14 April 2014. However, the notification did not clarify whether the interim period between the end of the first quota period and the notification date (14 to 25 February 2014) was subject to the export embargo. This was relevant because the two bills of lading for the rosewood were issued on 19 February 2014 and they stated that the cargo was shipped on 18 February 2014. Further, most of the Madagascan export documents produced by Mr Wong were dated 17 and 18 February 2014.', '25\\u2003During AVA\u2019s investigations, the following events occurred:', '(a)\\u2003On 19 March 2014, Ms Lye wrote to the Madagascan Forestry Ministry to seek clarification on the authenticity of the export documents. A Mr Jean Claude, bearing the title of Director-General in the Ministry, replied to say that the documents were not authentic.', '(b)\\u2003On 28 March 2014, Ms Lye received an email from the Madagascan Forestry Ministry\u2019s web domain that referred to her request for authorization and stated that \u201cMr\u2026 Soilihi has been exceptionally allowed to export these merchandises under the bill of lading\u201d. Mr Soilihi was listed as a shipper in the bills of lading and was also the person ostensibly authorised to export the rosewood in the 2010 authorisation letter ([23(a)] above). Later, Ms Lye was informed by the CITES Secretariat that the Ministry\u2019s email account had been hacked.', '(c)\\u2003On 4 November 2014, the Madagascan Forestry Ministry wrote to the CITES Secretariat (with copy to Ms Lye) to say that Madagascar would send a \u201csignificant delegation to the countries that seized [rosewood], for negotiation\u2026\u201d', '(d)\\u2003On 20 January 2015, after a Madagascan delegation visited Singapore, Mr Ramparany Anth\u00e8lme from the Madagascan Forestry Ministry wrote to Ms Lye stating that the export documents were \u201cestablished in due form by the signatories authorities during the period of transition\u201d.', '(e)\\u2003On 10 February 2016, the Prime Minister of the Government of Madagascar sent a letter to the Solicitor-General of Singapore stating that \u201call export or export licence approvals are invalid since the implementation of [the rosewood export ban] on [24 March 2010]\u201d and that the applicants\u2019 documents \u201care in violation of CITES decisions and to national regulations\u201d. The Judge declined to decide whether the letter should be admitted as it was irrelevant to the charge.', '(f)\\u2003On 3 February 2017, after the hearings before the Judge had concluded, the Prosecution sought to adduce Madagascan government correspondence obtained in January 2017 that ostensibly would prove that the evidence that the applicants provided in court as to their authorization to export the rosewood from Madagascar was false. The Judge did not allow the evidence to be admitted.', '26\\u2003Ultimately, the Madagascan documents have limited relevance to the s 4(1) charge that the Prosecution pursued against the applicants, which was the lack of an import permit from AVA. The applicants agree that they do not have such an import permit. They are therefore relevant only in so far as they shed light on whether the rosewood was in transit or was imported into Singapore.'"}

The victim\u2019s younger son, Sivakumar s\/o Chinapan (\u201cMr Sivakumar\u201d), testified below that his elder brother had previously employed the accused.', '4\\u2003The victim lived in a flat in Yishun with Mr Sivakumar and his family. On 9 December 2013, the day when she was killed by the accused, Mr Sivakumar and his family were away on holiday; she was all alone in the flat.', '5\\u2003The accused lived with his wife, Parameswary A\/P Thimparayan (\u201cMdm Parameswary\u201d), in a rented room in a flat in Johor Bahru, Malaysia. On the day of the offence, the accused had asked Mdm Parameswary about the payment schedule for their new flat in Johor Bahru. The accused told her that he would try to convince his employer to lend them some money. He also told her that he would be collecting $2,000 in tontine money that day. With that, he left home at 6.30am. He returned later that afternoon around 1pm to 2pm. What happened in the interim would have been beyond Mdm Parameswary\u2019s contemplation.', '6\\u2003The accused had gone to the victim\u2019s flat in Yishun. He wanted to borrow money from either Mr Sivakumar or the victim. When he reached the flat, the victim invited him in. She offered to make him some coffee. As he was having his coffee, the accused told the victim that he needed to borrow $2,000 to $3,000 to pay the deposit for his new flat. The victim replied that she did not have that much money. The victim then went to the toilet to brush her teeth. While she was there, the accused searched each of the three rooms in the flat for valuables. He found nothing in the first two rooms. He then entered the master bedroom. He forced open the locked cupboard door and found a box containing jewellery. He decided to steal the box of jewellery.', '7\\u2003As he was holding the box, the victim entered the master bedroom. The accused placed the box on the bed. He pleaded with the victim to let him keep the jewellery. He promised to repay her the money in instalments. The victim refused. She threatened to call Mr Sivakumar. He pleaded with her not to do so. The victim came closer to him. That was when matters took an unfortunate turn.', '8\\u2003The accused shoved the victim hard. She fell onto the floor. He knelt down over her; she struggled and pleaded with him to let her go. He grabbed a pillow lying nearby and covered her face with it. With his left hand, he grabbed her neck at the same time. After about three to four minutes, he released his left hand, as he felt tired. He continued pressing the pillow down on her face. The victim struggled throughout the entire ordeal, which lasted for about ten minutes. The accused only removed the pillow at the end of those ten minutes or so when he noticed that the victim was no longer struggling. He threw the pillow onto the bed. At this moment, he noticed that the victim was gasping for air, eyes open. He took the box of jewellery and left the flat.', '9\\u2003When he arrived back in Johor Bahru that day, the accused called Mdm Parameswary and told her that he had collected $2,000 from his employer and another $2,000 in tontine money. He also bought jewellery for her. Over the next few days, he gave his wife various sums of money as well, including RM5,000 to pay the deposit for the new flat.', '10\\u2003On 17 December 2013, the couple had a heated argument. Mdm Parameswary insisted on going to Singapore to verify with the accused\u2019s employer that he had really taken a loan. While they were at the Woodlands immigration checkpoint, the accused was placed under arrest.', '11\\u2003The accused claimed trial to the following charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, an offence under s 299, punishable under s 304(a) of the Penal Code:', '12\\u2003However, the accused did not deny that he caused the victim\u2019s death. His sole defence at the trial was that he only had the knowledge that he was likely by his act to cause the victim\u2019s death, and that he should therefore be found guilty of a lesser offence within s 299, punishable under s 304(b) of the Penal Code which attracts a sentence of up to ten years\u2019 imprisonment.', '13\\u2003At the end of the trial, the accused was convicted on the charge, ie, under s 304(a) of the Penal Code, for having had the intention to cause the victim\u2019s death. He was then sentenced to 18 years\u2019 imprisonment with effect from 17 December 2013, the date he was placed in remand. Since he was more than 50 years old at the time of sentencing, he could not be caned, by virtue of s 325(1)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed). The Judge saw no reason to impose an additional term of imprisonment in lieu of caning given the substantial length of imprisonment already imposed.

{"casename":"2019_SGCA_23","fact":"'6\\u2003According to Mr Ahmad, his late grandfather, who was known as Haji Anwar, began residing on the Land sometime in the early 1950s. He cleared the dense vegetation on the Land so that it was fit for use as a Muslim cemetery. He was then entrusted with the care and maintenance of the cemetery and, in return, was given permission by the penghulu or headman of the village then known as Kampong Siglap which was located in the vicinity of the Land to \u201cbuild a simple house for [the family\u2019s] permanent abode\u201d on the Land. Haji Anwar built the House as a family home, and his son Mr Adam later expanded it as the family grew. According to Mr Ahmad, the family resided there undisturbed until 2009, oblivious to the government\u2019s acquisition in the intervening period.', '7\\u2003The Land was gazetted for compulsory acquisition on 27 November 1987 on the basis that it was needed for the public purpose of general development. At that time, the Land was zoned for \u201ccemetery\u201d use under the 1985 Master Plan promulgated by the Urban Redevelopment Authority.', '8\\u2003A notice of acquisition (\u201cthe Notice\u201d) was posted on the Land on 22 January 1988 to announce that the Land was required by the government under the 1987 LAA. The Notice invited persons interested in the Land to appear at the Land Office before the Collector on 3 March 1988 to state the nature of their interest in the Land, and the amount and particulars of their claims to compensation. There is a handwritten notation, \u201cPosted on Site\u201d, at the bottom of the Notice but it is not known precisely where on the Land it was posted. Mr Ahmad claims that his family was unaware of the Notice. A notice in similar terms was addressed to the paper owners and posted at the Land Office\u2019s notice board because they could not be traced. There is no record of any such notice having been sent to Mr Ahmad or Mr Adam.', '9\\u2003No one attended the hearing before the Collector on 3 March 1988. The Collector made the Award in favour of the paper owners. On 20 June 1988, the Collector applied for and obtained an Order of Court allowing him to pay the sum of $18,800 into court. The basis for the application was that the offer of compensation could not be served on the paper owners because they could not be found. The Land formally vested in the State on 12 September 1988.', '10\\u2003For the next 20 years, no attempts were made by the government to evict Mr Ahmad\u2019s family from the House. It appears that the government was not aware that Mr Ahmad\u2019s family was residing on State land. Mr Ahmad\u2019s family continued to pay property tax, utility bills and television licence fees in connection with the House until 2013. Sometime in 2009, Mr Ahmad noticed that the graves on the Land were being exhumed. This prompted him to make inquiries and to search the land register, which led him to discover that the Land had been acquired by the government in 1988.', '11\\u2003Feeling aggrieved that the Land had been acquired apparently without any notice or compensation to his family, Mr Ahmad wrote a letter, dated 5  February 2010, to one of the Members of Parliament overseeing his constituency (\u201cthe MP Letter\u201d). In it, he stated as follows:', '(a)\\u2003Mr Ahmad\u2019s family had lived in the House for more than five decades since the mid-1950s. While Mr Ahmad had no personal knowledge of how the family came to live on the Land, he was told by his father that the Land was \u201cwaqaf land, to be used as a burial ground for Muslims\u201d and that the family was \u201callowed to build a house on the land as [they would] not be paid for the upkeep of the cemetery and its vicinity\u201d. Mr Ahmad stated that his family \u201cnever registered interest nor claimed ownership by adverse possession and [they] never regretted it as [they] never owned [the Land]\u201d because they understood the Land to be \u201cbequeathed for public use\u201d.', '(b)\\u2003It was only when the burial grounds were being exhumed that Mr Ahmad discovered that the Land had been acquired by the government. About a week before he wrote the MP Letter, an officer from the SLA had informed Mr Ahmad that he was illegally occupying State land and asked him to vacate the premises.', '(c)\\u2003Although his family was \u201cnot challenging the government\u2019s right to the [premises]\u201d, they were upset that the government had not given them any notice of the acquisition all these years, only to now allege, out of the blue, that they were illegal occupants. They asked the government for \u201csome form of gratuity payment for the efforts [they] had put in all these decades\u201d in maintaining the Land at their own expense. They hoped that the government would show appreciation for their efforts by \u201cgiving [them] another house or some payment which [they] can use to buy another house\u201d.', '12\\u2003On 8 February 2010, the MP Letter was forwarded to the SLA. While there was a discussion between the parties shortly thereafter, the SLA only formally replied to Mr Ahmad some two years later. Its letter of 9 July 2012 informed him that it would not be able to accede to his request for a replacement house or compensation, but that it was evaluating the possibility of an ex gratia payment.', '13\\u2003On 22 November 2013, the SLA wrote to Mr Ahmad to reiterate that he was not entitled to remain in occupation of the Land or the House regardless of whether he was a \u201cperson interested\u201d in the Land under the 1987 LAA because the Land had vested in the State. It indicated that it was prepared to offer Mr Ahmad an ex gratia payment of $17,882.05 to facilitate his relocation by 22  January 2014. If Mr Ahmad wished to continue occupying the Land, however, the SLA was willing to offer him a temporary occupation licence (\u201cTOL\u201d) at a monthly fee starting at $77.20 for the first year, with a possibility of renewal on a yearly basis.', '14\\u2003Mr Ahmad did not vacate the Land or accept the offer of a TOL. On 26 May 2014, the SLA gave Mr Ahmad notice that he had failed to vacate the Land and was therefore in \u201cunauthorised and unlawful occupation of the Land\u201d. He was given 28 days to vacate the Land. Following this, Mr Ahmad attempted to negotiate for more time to vacate the Land and for a higher ex gratia payment.', '15\\u2003On 31 July 2014, Mr Ahmad\u2019s present solicitors, AC Syed & Partners (\u201cAC Syed\u201d), wrote to the SLA, alleging for the first time that the compulsory acquisition was carried out in breach of natural justice; that Mr Ahmad was a \u201crightful owner in possession of the land\u201d and not a \u201ctrespasser\u201d; that the SLA\u2019s offer of an ex gratia payment was unjustifiable; and that Mr Ahmad, as an \u201cadverse possessory owner\u201d, was entitled to compensation assessed at the prevailing market rate.', '16\\u2003On 17 September 2014, the AG responded to AC Syed, stating the government\u2019s position that there was no breach of natural justice in the execution of the compulsory acquisition; that Mr Ahmad could apply to court for the release of the $18,800 if he was of the view that he had a compensable interest as at September 1988; and that Mr Ahmad was not entitled to remain in occupation of the Land or to mount a claim of adverse possession. On 29 September 2014, the SLA wrote to Mr Ahmad to seek his cooperation to \u201cquickly vacate the Land in compliance with the law\u201d. To facilitate an amicable settlement of the matter, the SLA made a \u201cfinal offer\u201d [emphasis in original] out of goodwill to increase the ex gratia payment to $36,000, payable by 15 November 2014, if Mr Ahmad vacated the Land by 15 October 2014.', '17\\u2003On 3 October 2014, AC Syed replied to both the AG and the SLA. To the former, they maintained that notice of the compulsory acquisition had not been posted as required under the 1987 LAA, and that if such notice had been given, Mr Ahmad would have sought \u201ctimely legal advice\u201d and \u201csubmit[ted] his claims as adverse owner of the Land\u201d. In reply to the latter, AC Syed rejected the SLA\u2019s offer of $36,000. They contended that Mr Ahmad was \u201cnot just an occupant \u2026 [or] a trespasser\u201d but an \u201cadverse owner\u201d and hence, the compensation due to him ought to be \u201creasonably based on the valuation of the Land as at the period of acquisition\u201d. However, Mr Ahmad was prepared to accept the SLA\u2019s earlier offer of a TOL.', '18\\u2003The SLA thereafter issued three successive TOLs, pursuant to which Mr Ahmad was permitted to continue living in the House until 19 July 2016. Mr Ahmad redelivered vacant possession of the House to the SLA on 30 June 2016, shortly before the expiry of the third TOL. Possession of the House is therefore not in dispute in these proceedings.'"}

{"casename":"2019_SGCA_25","fact":"'2\\u2003Article 49(1) of the Constitution reads:', '3\\u2003The proper interpretation of Art 49(1) in the present case is to be approached in the context of the introduction of the GRC scheme. As such, we begin by briefly setting out the broad historical developments pertaining to Art 49(1) and the introduction of the GRC scheme. This will provide the necessary background to the discussion that follows.', '4\\u2003The drafting history of Art 49(1) was extensively discussed in Vellama at [58]\u2013[72]. For present purposes, it is sufficient to note that Art 49(1) has remained substantively unchanged since its original enactment as Art 33 in 1965, save that: (a) it was renumbered from Art 33 to Art 49; and (b) some other amendments were made as a result of the introduction of non-constituency Members (see Vellama at [60]). At the time of Art 49\u2019s original enactment as Art 33, all electoral divisions in Singapore were SMCs, which, as the name implies, are constituencies represented by a single Member.', '5\\u2003Twenty-three years after the original enactment of Art 49, the GRC scheme was brought into effect in 1988 by means of simultaneous amendments to both the Constitution and the Parliamentary Elections Act (Cap 218, 1985 Rev Ed). These were effected through the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Act 1988 (Act 9 of 1988) (\u201cthe 1988 Constitution Amendment Act\u201d) and the Parliamentary Elections (Amendment) Act 1988 (Act 10 of 1988) (\u201cthe 1988 PE Amendment Act\u201d) respectively. The key amendment introduced by the 1988 Constitution Amendment Act was the insertion into the Constitution of Art 39A, which provides for the designation of constituencies as GRCs. Article 49, which, until then, had only ever applied to SMCs, was not, however, amended. The GRC scheme was introduced to ensure multi-racial representation in Parliament by requiring some constituencies (namely, GRCs) to be contested on a group basis, with each group of candidates having at least one candidate belonging to either the Malay, Indian or other minority community: see Art 39A(2)(a) of the Constitution.', '6\\u2003The appellant (\u201cthe Appellant\u201d) is a resident of MYT GRC and a member of the Singapore Democratic Party (\u201cSDP\u201d). In the general election held in September 2015 (\u201cthe 2015 General Election\u201d), she contested MYT GRC under the SDP\u2019s banner along with three other individuals. A team from the People\u2019s Action Party (\u201cPAP\u201d) consisting of Mdm Halimah, Mr Ong Teng Koon, Mr Lawrence Wong and Mr Alex Yam also contested the GRC. Mdm Halimah was the only minority community candidate of that team. The PAP team won the election for MYT GRC.', '7\\u2003On 6 February 2017, Mr Pritam Singh, an elected Member for Aljunied GRC, asked in Parliament whether a by-election would be called in a GRC in the event that a minority community Member (\u201cminority Member\u201d) of that GRC were to step down in order to contest a presidential election. Mr Chan Chun Sing, then Minister in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, replied that there would be no need to call a by-election if a single minority Member of a GRC were to resign.', '8\\u2003As we have already noted, on 7 August 2017, Mdm Halimah resigned her seat as a Member for MYT GRC to stand for the 2017 Presidential Election. No by-election was called, and MYT GRC continues to be represented by the remaining Members of the PAP team which won that constituency in the 2015 General Election.', '9\\u2003On 13 September 2017, the SDP and the Appellant filed Originating Summons No 1034 of 2017 (\u201cOS 1034\u201d) in the High Court seeking leave to apply for the following reliefs:', '(a)\\u2003a mandatory order that the three remaining Members of MYT GRC vacate their seats, and that thereafter, a by-election be held \u201cwith all convenient speed\u201d for MYT GRC;', '(b)\\u2003a declaratory order that s 24(2A) of the Parliamentary Elections Act (Cap 218, 2011 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe PEA\u201d) must be interpreted as requiring all the remaining Members of a GRC to vacate their seats when a Member of the GRC vacates his or her seat, or, in the alternative, where the only minority Member of the GRC vacates his or her seat; and', '(c)\\u2003in the alternative, a declaratory order that s 24(2A) of the PEA is void for inconsistency with Art 49(1) of the Constitution.', '10\\u2003Initially, the Attorney-General (\u201cthe Respondent\u201d) indicated an intention to challenge the SDP\u2019s standing to make the application, but not that of the Appellant since she was a resident of MYT GRC. Since the Appellant\u2019s case remained the same regardless of the SDP\u2019s involvement as a party to the application, in the interest of saving time and costs, an amendment to OS 1034 was filed on 5 December 2017 removing the SDP as a party to the application. The rest of OS 1034 remained unchanged. As a result, there is no dispute before us as to the Appellant\u2019s standing to bring the application.', '11\\u2003At the hearing before the High Court judge (\u201cthe Judge\u201d) on 22 January 2018, the parties agreed to have the leave application and the substantive application for relief heard together. This was because the leave application turned on whether the Appellant could show an arguable or prima facie case for granting the orders sought in OS 1034, and this involved a question of constitutional interpretation that would traverse the same issues as the substantive application, albeit with a different standard of persuasion being applicable.', '12\\u2003In the proceedings below, the main thrust of the Appellant\u2019s case was that the law required that the remaining Members of MYT GRC vacate their seats and that a by-election then be held in MYT GRC. The Appellant made three main arguments in support of her position:', '(a)\\u2003first, Art 49(1) of the Constitution mandates that a by-election must be called when any seat in a GRC falls vacant for any reason other than a dissolution of Parliament;', '(b)\\u2003second, Art 39A(2) of the Constitution requires that there must be a minority Member for a GRC until the dissolution of Parliament; and', '(c)\\u2003third, voters have the right to be represented by an elected Member of their choice until the dissolution of Parliament pursuant to an \u201cimplied right to representation\u201d contained in the Constitution.', '13\\u2003The Respondent, on the other hand, submitted that s 24(2A) of the PEA specifically prohibited a by-election from being called when any seat in a GRC became vacant unless all the other seats in that GRC had also been vacated. Hence, the Respondent submitted, the issue should correctly be framed in terms of whether s 24(2A) of the PEA was unconstitutional in the light of Art 49(1) of the Constitution. The Respondent argued that on a proper interpretation of Art 49(1), it did not conflict with s 24(2A). The Respondent highlighted that Parliament, in debating the constitutional and legislative amendments that brought the GRC scheme into force, had expressly considered the issue of what would occur in the event that a Member vacated a GRC seat, and had arrived at the conclusion that was expressed in s 24(2A). In the Respondent\u2019s submission, Art 49(1) ought to be given an updating or rectifying construction to take into account the later introduction of GRCs; alternatively, Art 49(1) should be construed as being applicable only to SMCs and not to GRCs.', '14\\u2003In Wong Souk Yee v Attorney-General [2018] SGHC 80 (\u201cWong Souk Yee HC\u201d), the Judge held as follows:', '(a)\\u2003It was implicit in the Appellant\u2019s case that a by-election could not be held to fill just one seat in a GRC, and that any by-election in a GRC would have to be for the whole team of Members representing that GRC (at [15]).', '(b)\\u2003The Appellant\u2019s interpretation of Art 49(1) was unworkable because it required the remaining Members of MYT GRC to resign when there was no legal basis for compelling their resignation (at [25]\u2013[26]).', '(c)\\u2003An updating or rectifying construction should be applied to Art 49(1) to reflect the changes introduced by Art 39A. This was consistent with the clear intent and will of Parliament (at [36], [38] and [41]).', '(d)\\u2003In relation to the Appellant\u2019s argument on Art 39A(2), the Appellant had clarified in oral submissions that her case was that a by-election must be held if any seat in a GRC (whether or not held by a minority Member) was vacated. It was therefore no longer necessary to consider her separate submission on Art 39A in relation to the special interest in ensuring minority representation. In any event, there was no basis in law to compel the remaining Members of a GRC to vacate their seats when a seat in the GRC became vacant (at [52]\u2013[53]).', '(e)\\u2003Under the GRC scheme, voters in a GRC voted not for individual Members, but for the entire team of Members who would represent that GRC. Hence, voters did not lose their right to representation merely because one Member of a GRC team had vacated his or her seat (at [57]).', '(f)\\u2003The Appellant\u2019s substantive case thus did not succeed, and for the same reasons, the Appellant had not shown an arguable or prima facie case for granting the reliefs sought in OS 1034. Leave was therefore not granted for the Appellant to apply for those reliefs (at [61]\u2013[62]).', '15\\u2003The Judge awarded costs against the Appellant as the primary focus of her application was the mandatory order to compel the remaining Members of MYT GRC to vacate their seats and there was no basis at all for such an order (at [65]).'"}

{"casename":"2019_SGCA_27","fact":"'4\\u2003The respondent in this case faced 63 charges under s 22A(1)(a) of the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (Cap 91A, 2009 Rev Ed), for having received from foreign employees a sum of $2,000 (per employee) as a condition for their employment by two marine companies, of which the respondent was a senior executive. The respondent initially claimed trial to these charges, and the trial commenced in the State Courts before the District Judge.', '5\\u2003On the second day of the trial, the respondent\u2019s counsel at that time, Mr Kalidass Murugaiyan, sought an adjournment to consider a plea offer communicated by the Prosecution. The respondent subsequently pleaded guilty to 20 proceeded charges, and admitted to the statement of facts without qualification after some clarifications were made at the request of Mr Kalidass. The respondent was accordingly convicted on his plea.', '6\\u2003The Prosecution then made its submissions on sentence before the District Judge, following which Mr Kalidass sought a further adjournment for the respondent\u2019s mitigation and sentencing submissions to be made on another date. This was done notwithstanding the fact that Mr Kalidass had already prepared a written mitigation plea highlighting the respondent\u2019s personal mitigating circumstances, such as the fact that he had a pregnant wife and aging parents to support. This first mitigation plea did not contain any assertions that in any way qualified the original guilty plea.', '7\\u2003The District Judge adjourned the sentencing hearing to be heard on another date. Following the respondent\u2019s conviction, the Prosecution allowed several foreign witnesses who had been scheduled to testify at the trial to return to Myanmar.', '8\\u2003Before the adjourned sentencing hearing took place, Mr Peter Fernando took over conduct of the defence from Mr Kalidass, and he informed the court that he had been instructed by the respondent to make an application at the next hearing for permission to retract his guilty plea. On the District Judge\u2019s directions, the parties furnished written submissions in connection with the intended application.', '9\\u2003The respondent\u2019s submissions for retraction stated that he \u201cdisputes the following material allegations against him\u201d:', 'According to the submissions, these assertions \u201cmaterially affect the legal conditions of the alleged offences\u201d, and hence the court was \u201cobliged under law to reject the [respondent\u2019s] guilty plea\u201d pursuant to s 228(4) of the CPC. There was evidently some confusion in the position taken by Mr Fernando who cited s 228(4) even though he did not appear to be making any mitigation submissions.', '10\\u2003The Prosecution\u2019s written submissions on the other hand referred exclusively to the principles governing an application to retract a guilty plea as laid down in Ganesun s\/o Kannan v Public Prosecutor [1996] 3 SLR(R) 125 (\u201cGanesun\u201d). The Prosecution argued that the application should be disallowed because the respondent\u2019s plea had been validly taken, entirely in compliance with the three procedural safeguards: the respondent had pleaded guilty in his own voice and words; he had understood the nature and consequences of his plea; and he had done so intending to admit the commission of the offences without qualification. No mention of s 228(4) was made in the Prosecution\u2019s written submissions.', '11\\u2003When the parties returned to court, the District Judge sought clarification from Mr Fernando as to whether he was putting forth an application to retract the guilty plea, or whether the respondent was in fact putting forward matters in mitigation that would qualify his guilty plea. The District Judge indicated that he would not be minded to allow the application if Mr Fernando was pursuing the former course but that he might be compelled to reject the guilty plea in the event the position was the latter. Mr Fernando informed the District Judge that even though the application was termed as one to retract the guilty plea, in fact, his intention was indeed to raise matters in mitigation that would effectively qualify the respondent\u2019s guilty plea. The matter was then adjourned for Mr Fernando to prepare a written mitigation.', '12\\u2003A written mitigation plea was subsequently tendered on the respondent\u2019s behalf, in which the respondent once again disputed the six material allegations against him that had been mentioned in the submissions for retraction of plea (see [9] above).', '13\\u2003The District Judge refused to reject the respondent\u2019s guilty plea, noting that the procedural safeguards relating to his plea had been observed. The District Judge opined that the mitigation plea in reproducing the six grounds of dispute \u201cwas not done in good faith and was done with the view to compelling [the] Court to reject the plea of guilty\u201d pursuant to s 228(4) of the CPC, and as such this was an abuse of process on the respondent\u2019s part and a \u201cbackdoor way to turn back the clock\u201d and resile from his guilty plea. The District Judge sentenced the respondent to a fine of $12,000 (in default one month\u2019s imprisonment) for each of the 20 proceeded charges, for a total fine of $240,000 (in default 20 months\u2019 imprisonment). He also made an order requiring the respondent to disgorge the sum of $40,000 (in default 40 days\u2019 imprisonment), which was the aggregate amount he was found to have received in respect of the 20 charges.', '14\\u2003Dissatisfied with the District Judge\u2019s decision, the respondent filed a petition for criminal revision (HC\/CR 8\/2018) to the High Court on the basis that the District Judge had erred in law \u201cin rejecting [the] application for retraction of plea of guilt and\/or the qualification of [the] plea of guilt\u201d.'"}

We repeat only the salient facts here.', '6\\u2003On 27 May 2017, Knight Frank Pte Ltd (\u201cKnight Frank\u201d) gave the Property\u2019s subsidiary proprietors an overview of the collective sale process. Knight Frank informed them that the estimated sale price was at least $455.8m and that the estimated development charge (\u201cDC\u201d) payable for the redevelopment of the Property was $48.4m.', '7\\u2003Knight Frank\u2019s estimation of the DC was an important issue in this appeal. Essentially, the DC is a tax payable by developers to the relevant authorities when planning permission is granted to carry out a development project which increases the value of the land. This Court explained in Chua Choon Cheng and others v Allgreen Properties Ltd and another appeal [2009] 3 SLR(R) 724 as follows:', '8\\u2003On 1 July 2017, an extraordinary general meeting (\u201cEGM\u201d) of the management corporation was convened. The CSC was constituted at this EGM to act jointly on behalf of the subsidiary proprietors for the purposes of a collective sale. The CSC comprised six members, including the three respondents. The first respondent, Mr Lim Hun Joo (\u201cMr Lim\u201d) became the chairman of the CSC. Sometime in early July 2017, the CSC appointed Knight Frank as the marketing agent and Rajah & Tann Singapore LLP (\u201cR&T\u201d) as the legal advisors for the collective sale.', '9\\u2003On 9 September 2017, an EGM of the management corporation was convened. It was attended by subsidiary proprietors, in person or by proxy, who collectively own 135 units in the Property. At the EGM, Knight Frank shared a proposed reserve price of $500m for the collective sale and an estimated DC of around $58.5m, subject to verification. Knight Frank explained the apportionment method of sale proceeds while R&T went through the terms and conditions of the collective sale agreement (\u201cCSA\u201d). The CSA stated that the reserve price was $500m but was subject to change. However, no formal vote was held at the EGM for the approval of the apportionment of sale proceeds and the terms and conditions of the CSA. Instead, subsidiary proprietors who collectively own 76 units signed the CSA after the EGM was concluded, on the same day.', '10\\u2003On or around 24 November 2017, Knight Frank sent letters to the subsidiary proprietors to inform them that the CSC had resolved to increase the reserve price to $550m.', '11\\u2003By 15 January 2018, subsidiary proprietors of the lots with not less than 80% of the share values and not less than 80% of the total area of all the lots had signed the CSA. In other words, the 80% consent threshold required for making any collective sale application pursuant to s 84A(1)(b) of the LTSA was reached.', '12\\u2003On 25 January 2018, an owners\u2019 meeting was convened and Knight Frank informed the subsidiary proprietors that the Property would be launched for sale by way of public tender on 26 January 2018, that the estimated DC was $63.19m and that it had appointed an architect to carry out the DC verification.', '13\\u2003On 26 January 2018, the Property was launched for sale by way of public tender, which would close on 7 March 2018. When the Property was launched for sale, Knight Frank\u2019s sent emails to 652 potential bidders on its database to notify them of the launch. In the emails, Knight Frank mentioned that the reserve price was $550m, that there was an additional estimated DC of approximately $63.2m and that Knight Frank was awaiting a reply from the authorities on a matter relevant to the verification of the DC.', '14\\u2003On 26 February 2018, it emerged that no DC would be payable for the Property. Knight Frank immediately began updating potential bidders (but not the subsidiary proprietors) that no DC was payable. There were also urgent discussions between Knight Frank and the CSC. Knight Frank advised that there was no reason to extend the closing date of the tender which was on 7 March 2018. Instead, Knight Frank stated that if any potential bidder requested an extension of the closing date, Knight Frank would discuss the matter with the CSC. The CSC did not disagree with this approach. As it turned out, there was no request for extension of the closing date.', '15\\u2003On 7 March 2018, the tender closed as scheduled and the tender box was opened.

Taking into account the fact that no DC was payable, Colliers valued the Property at $542m.', '17\\u2003The next day, the CSC awarded the tender to the joint-bidders which had submitted the bid of $610m. Thereafter, Knight Frank sent a letter dated 8 March 2018 to the subsidiary proprietors to inform them that a sale and purchase agreement (amended as at 8 March 2018) (\u201cthe SPA\u201d) had been entered into that day in respect of the Property for the sale price of $610m. Knight Frank did not mention in this letter that there was no DC payable.', '18\\u2003On 19 March 2018, an owners\u2019 meeting was convened. It was at this meeting that the CSC informed the subsidiary proprietors for the first time that there was no DC payable. Although queries were raised as to why they were not informed more promptly, no assenting subsidiary proprietor sought to withdraw from the CSA. Subsequently, subsidiary proprietors of another ten units added their signatures to the CSA.', '19\\u2003On 25 April 2018, the respondents applied to a Strata Titles Board (\u201cthe Board\u201d) for an order for the collective sale of the Property. Various objections to the collective sale were filed. On 27 June 2018, the Board ordered a discontinuance of all proceedings before it in connection with the respondents\u2019 application. On 10 July 2018, the respondents applied to the High Court for an order for the collective sale of the Property. On 20 August 2018, the appellants filed their objections to the collective sale.', '20\\u2003The Judge heard the application from 12 September 2018 to 14 September 2018 and reserved judgment. He was informed that the respondents had to obtain an order for the collective sale by 26 November 2018, failing which the purchaser who entered into the SPA might treat it as rescinded.

It also employed 1,311 employees.', '8\\u2003The only creditors who took an active position in the appeals are the Minority Creditors who oppose Empire Capital\u2019s application. The Minority Creditors are the ultimate beneficial owners of certain notes to be compromised under the Proposed Scheme (see [13] below), and they are represented in these proceedings by their shared investment manager, Argentem Creek Partners LP.', '9\\u2003The Proposed Scheme seeks to compromise two sets of notes issued by BCR and BCE respectively on behalf of the Berau Group.', '10\\u2003The first set is the guaranteed senior secured notes issued in 2010 by BCR for an aggregate sum of US$450m at a fixed interest rate of 12.5% per annum due for maturity on 8 July 2015 (\u201cthe 2015 Notes\u201d), pursuant to an indenture dated 8 July 2010. The Bank of New York Mellon (\u201cNY Mellon\u201d) acted as the trustee for and on behalf of the noteholders (\u201cthe 2015 Noteholders\u201d). There are more than 30 security documents attached to this note issuance, the most significant of which is the Cash and Accounts Management Agreement (\u201cCAMA\u201d) that prescribes a payment and accounts mechanism in accordance with which the Berau Group is obliged to pay and hold all revenue and receipts from the sale of coal for the benefit of the 2015 Noteholders. The 2015 Notes are also guaranteed by various entities in the Berau Group, including BCE, Berau Coal, and Empire Capital. BCR lent the money it raised under the 2015 Notes to BCE to fund its capital expenditures and refinance its existing indebtedness.', '11\\u2003The second set refers to the guaranteed senior secured notes issued in 2012 by BCE for an aggregate sum of US$500m bearing a fixed interest rate of 7.25% per annum due for maturity on 13 March 2017 (\u201cthe 2017 Notes\u201d), pursuant to an indenture dated 13 March 2012. NY Mellon also acted as the trustee for these noteholders (\u201cthe 2017 Noteholders\u201d). Save for certain distinct CAMA accounts, the security package for the 2017 Notes largely overlaps with that for the 2015 Notes. Further, except for the exclusion of BCR, the 2017 Notes are guaranteed by the same guarantors as the 2015 Notes.', '12\\u2003Collectively, the two note issuances effectively securitise the Berau Group\u2019s future receivables in coal production in exchange for immediate liquidity. It is not disputed that, as at January 2016, the 2015 and the 2017 Notes were the only material external financial indebtedness of the Berau Group. Notably, Empire Capital, as the applicant before us, is a guarantor of both the 2015 and the 2017 Notes but not the issuer of either.', '13\\u2003Out of US$799,872,000 in aggregate outstanding principal under the 2015 and the 2017 Notes, the Minority Creditors collectively hold notes with a face value of around US$112,190,000 in the following proportions:', '(a)\\u200325.28% of the outstanding principal under the 2015 Notes;', '(b)\\u20034.91% of the outstanding principal under the 2017 Notes; and', '(c)\\u200314% of the aggregate outstanding principal under the 2015 and the 2017 Notes.', '14\\u2003In July 2015, following a crash in global coal prices that occurred sometime in the period 2014 to 2015 and amid several public bouts of management infighting, the Berau Group faced severe financial difficulties and could not fulfil its repayment obligations when the 2015 Notes matured. The default on the 2015 Notes in turn triggered a cross-default of the 2017 Notes.', '15\\u2003Thereafter, several applications were filed in Singapore and the US with the common broad aim of restructuring the liabilities of the group. The purpose and characterization of some of these applications are contested, but for present purposes, the proceedings in Singapore may be summarised as follows:', '(a)\\u2003In July 2015, BCR commenced HC\/OS 630\/2015 seeking a moratorium under s 210(10) of the CA to restrain proceedings against members of the Berau Group in order to facilitate a restructuring of the group\u2019s liabilities. At that time, the restructuring plan was premised on a US$150m facility that was to be extended to the group through its (then new) ultimate majority shareholder, Asia Coal Energy Ventures Limited (\u201cACE\u201d). An initial 6-month moratorium was granted by the High Court in July 2016. Thereafter, the facility was terminated due to a winding up petition being taken against ACE, and the restructuring plan could no longer be implemented as initially proposed. In January 2016, BCR applied for an extension of the moratorium and put forward a revised restructuring plan. Following discussions between the parties and arguments made before the High Court, the extension application was dismissed in March 2016.', '(b)\\u2003In June 2016, BCR applied in HC\/OS 550\/2016 to be placed under judicial management. At the same time, BCE applied in HC\/OS 551\/2016 for a moratorium under s 210(10) of the CA. According to the Berau Group, it was working towards developing a restructuring plan that might prove acceptable to its creditors.', '(c)\\u2003In November 2016, the Berau Group was ready to put forth a new restructuring proposal for consideration by its creditors. Accordingly, BCR and BCE withdrew HC\/OS 550\/2016 and HC\/OS551\/2016 and commenced HC\/OS 1175\/2016 and HC\/OS 1180\/2016 respectively, under s 210(1) of the CA seeking leave to convene a creditors\u2019 meeting to consider the new proposal. However, these proceedings were discontinued prior to the final hearing when it seemed that the proposed scheme would fail as a result of creditor opposition.', '16\\u2003On 9 April 2017, Empire Capital filed the present application under s 210 of the CA seeking, amongst other things, leave to convene a creditors\u2019 meeting to consider the Proposed Scheme and, if they thought fit, to approve it with or without modification. This is the Berau Group\u2019s fourth set of restructuring proceedings in Singapore. While all prior applications were filed by BCR and BCE in respect of the 2015 and the 2017 Noteholders separately (thereby contemplating that these noteholders should vote in different classes), the present application is the first to be filed by Empire Capital as a guarantor of those notes, and the first to propose putting all the noteholders into a single class of creditors.', '17\\u2003As is evident from the foregoing, the restructuring proposal put forward by the Berau Group has changed quite significantly over time. As it stands, the essential terms of the Proposed Scheme are as follows:', '(a)\\u2003All liabilities under the 2015 and the 2017 Notes are to be fully and finally extinguished and released. This includes the liabilities of BCE, BCR, and the co-guarantors. To that end, all accrued and unpaid interest, principal, and other amounts accrued or payable under the 2015 and the 2017 Notes will have to be waived by the noteholders.', '(b)\\u2003In consideration for the discharge of liabilities under the 2015 and the 2017 Notes, Berau Coal will issue new notes on a dollar-for-dollar basis (\u201cthe New Notes\u201d) with the following terms:', '(c)\\u2003BCE and\/or Berau Coal intend to utilise excess proceeds from the group\u2019s operations to redeem the New Notes (or any part thereof) through reverse Dutch auctions \u201cin a financially efficient manner\u201d.', '(d)\\u2003All sums in the CAMA accounts (in an amount of not less than US$47m) held in respect of the existing Notes will be released to Berau Coal for use as the working capital of the Berau Group.', '18\\u2003Information relating to the Proposed Scheme was provided by the Berau Group in the following documents:', '(a)\\u2003an explanatory statement, in accordance with s 211 of the CA (\u201cthe Explanatory Statement\u201d);', '(b)\\u2003a letter from the board of Empire Capital (\u201cthe Board Letter\u201d);', '(c)\\u2003instructions to noteholders, account holders, and intermediaries, including a \u201cQuestions and Answers\u201d section; and', '(d)\\u2003the terms of the Proposed Scheme, including appendices such as instructions on how to vote and participate, a notice of the creditors\u2019 meeting, and an information memorandum.', '19\\u2003According to the Explanatory Statement, the overall objectives of the Proposed Scheme are (a) to provide the creditors with better recovery than in the event of a liquidation, and (b) to enable the Berau Group as a whole to continue as a going concern (at para 2.1). Further, the Board Letter states that the board \u201cconsiders the [Proposed] Scheme to be in the best interests of the Scheme Creditors, the Berau Group and the stakeholders of the Berau Group\u201d (at para 2.3) and urges the creditors to vote in favour of the Proposed Scheme for the following reasons:', '(a)\\u2003the creditors stand to recover less in the event of a liquidation than under the Proposed Scheme;', '(b)\\u2003there is otherwise a danger that some individual creditors will commence enforcement action against members of the Berau Group thereby prejudicing the interests of the other creditors and the value of the group as a whole; and', '(c)\\u2003the inability of the Berau Group to operate as a going concern without the Proposed Scheme is \u201clikely\u201d to result in the Indonesian Government revoking Berau Coal\u2019s licenses to maintain its mining operations in Indonesia.'"}

{"casename":"2019_SGCA_31","fact":"the facts  or both.\n2 In this case, we think it can be fairly  implied  that the Respondent did not \ndeclare the existence of the Appellant\u2019s two patents to the Health  Sciences \nAuthority (\u201cHSA\u201d) despite  the clear  requirements in reg 23 of the Health \nProducts (Therapeutic Products) Regulations 2016 (S 329\/2016) (\u201cthe TPR\u201d).  \nIf it did, we do not see why it would not want to make this explicit when asked  \nby the Appellant on this point. The declaration  has to be made whenever  there \nis a patent in force in respect of the therapeutic product and here,  the Appellant\u2019s \npatents fell within this description and there was no allegation  by the \nRespondent that it was unaware of these  patents. In any case, it must  have \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nMillennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc v [2019] SGCA 31\nDrug Houses of Australia Pte Ltd\n2known about these patents because  its affiliate, Teva, was involved in patent \nactions with the Appellant in Canada since 2012.\n3 The Respondent avers that its product does not infringe the processes  \nprotected by the Appellant\u2019s  patents  and therefore the patents had no relevance \nto the product and there  was no need  to declare them  to HSA. However,  that is \nnot a course  of action  which the Respondent can choose to take.  It has to declare  \nthe patents  and then state, among several  possibilities, that the patents are \ninvalid or will not be infringed by the doing  of the act for which the registration \nof its product  is sought. It is then for HSA  to decide whether to invoke reg 23(5) \nof the TPR to require the Respondent to serve  the requisite notice on the \nAppellant.\n4 If such a notice was directed to be served,  there would have  been the 44-\nday moratorium in reg 23(8)  of the TPR followed by the 30-month moratorium \nin reg 23(9) of the TPR. Due to the Respondent\u2019s non-compliance with the \nregulations, it bypassed  these moratoriums.\n5 It is therefore  not open to the Respondent to then argue that the \nAppellant could  only proceed by the reg 23 TPR route when the Respondent \nwas responsible for depriving the Appellant  of that route by its non-compliance.\n6 In any event, reg 24 of the TPR opens the way for a challenge to the \nregistration of the Respondent\u2019s product  if the Appellant manages to obtain  a \ncourt order  determining either of the matters spelt out in reg 24(1)(a)(i) or (ii). \nThat appears from the statement  of claim to be precisely what the Appellant  is \nhoping to achieve.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nMillennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc v [2019] SGCA 31\nDrug Houses of Australia Pte Ltd\n37 In our opinion, reg 24(1)( a)(i) of the TPR is not necessarily about \nproving actual  or past infringement of a patent.  Instead, it envisages the situation \nwhere the Court (or the Registrar  of Patents) considers an act authorised by the \nregistration of the therapeutic product and determines whether  that act amounts \nto infringement  of a patent in the particular circumstances. As pleaded at \nparagraph (11) of the statement of claim,  the acts in question are supply, \nmanufacture, import and wholesale. The act may or may not have taken place. \nFor instance, an applicant under this provision may argue before  the Court that \nthe person  granted registration under  the TPR is thereby permitted to import the \nproduct into Singapore  but the act of importing the product would infringe  its \npatent. The question that the Court has to answer  is whether importing the \nregistered product infringes a patent,  irrespective  of whether  importation has \nalready taken place  or not.\n8 At the very least,  we think that such an interpretation of reg 24 may be \nfairly argued before  the Court and is not a hopelessly untenable one. Even  if \nactual infringement must be shown, it is also arguable that such infringement \ntook place when the Respondent participated in the hospitals\u2019 public tender for \nthe product  by offering to dispose of the product,  which the Appellant will have \nto prove was obtained directly by means of the patented process within the \nmeaning of s 66 of the Patents  Act (Cap 221, 2005 Rev Ed). This is something  \nthat can be particularised subsequently after discovery and\/or  interrogatories.\n9 Where reg 24(1)(a)(ii)  of the TPR is concerned, the High Court has held \nthat the declaration  sought by the Appellant should not be struck out and we \nagree. It is for the Appellant to prove at the trial that the declaration made  to \nHSA is false or misleading in a material particular or has omitted  to disclose a \nmaterial matter. Based  on what we have  set out above regarding the registration  \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nMillennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc v [2019] SGCA 31\nDrug Houses of Australia Pte Ltd\n4scheme in reg 23, the Appellant\u2019s case cannot  be said to be hopeless or \nobviously unsustainable.\n10 If the Appellant succeeds in obtaining either  of these determinations  in \nreg 24(1)  of the TPR from the Court, it may then apply to HSA to cancel the \nRespondent\u2019s registration. There can be no doubt that it is an \u201cinterested person\u201d  \nwithin the meaning of the regulation. We think the Respondent overstates its \ncase when  it submits that this opens the door to abuse by those who missed  the \ndeadlines in reg 23 of the TPR. That regulation  concerns the registration process \nand provides  for moratoriums  against registration. A proprietor of a patent who \nmisses any of the deadlines has to take the risk of the competitor flooding the \nmarket with generic products after registration because  he has lost the \nopportunity to delay or even stop the registration  process. There is no abuse in \nthe proprietor now wanting to have  the registration cancelled if he can obtain a \ndetermination on the  specified matters.\n11 Accordingly,  we do not see why the statement of claim seeking these \ndeterminations should  be seen as revealing no reasonable cause of action. We \ntherefore allow  Civil"}

A new board of directors was appointed by the new government on or about 7 April 2015.

The MV Mahanuwara was chartered and operated by AGMS at the material time. AGMS took the position that there was no illegality in the operation of the Galle Floating Armoury Project given that it was operated with the complete knowledge and approval of the MOD.

Thereafter, acting on the nomination of the two arbitrators, the SIAC appointed the presiding arbitrator in the reference.', '17\\u2003Also on 21 August 2015, RALL\u2019s attorney sent a letter to the SIAC stating the dispute between the parties \u201ccontemplated by falling [sic] or contain[ed] facts on matters beyond the scope of submission to arbitration\u201d, and that the arbitration proceeding was in \u201cconflict with the Public Policy of the Republic of Sri Lanka\u201d. The attorney requested the SIAC to \u201cplease lay by the Arbitration proceedings until this matter to be discussed with [AGMS]\u201d.', '18\\u2003On 23 August 2015, RALL\u2019s attorney sent a letter of demand on behalf of RALL to AGMS claiming compensation for the loss of reputation caused by the institution of the arbitration proceedings. A day later, he sent another letter to AGMS inviting AGMS to discuss the dispute. Several discussions were held thereafter in an attempt to resolve the matter. In the meantime, the arbitration continued. The SIAC confirmed the constitution of the arbitral tribunal (the \u201cTribunal\u201d) on 30 September 2015. The Tribunal informed the parties on 15 October 2015 that a preliminary meeting would be held on 16 November 2015 in Singapore (\u201cthe Preliminary Meeting\u201d), and sent them a draft procedural order on 20 October 2015.', '19\\u2003In the interim, on or about 6 October 2015, a vessel named MV Avant Garde was detained outside the port limits of Galle Harbour by the Sri Lankan Navy. At the time of this detention, AGMS was operating a floating armoury on board the vessel. After finding weapons on the MV Avant Garde, the government of Sri Lanka launched criminal investigations. AGMS claimed that the detention was unlawful because the MOD had granted approval on 23 September 2015 for the MV Avant Garde to transport RALL\u2019s weapons, ammunition and equipment from the Red Sea to Galle.', '20\\u2003On 12 November 2015, RALL\u2019s attorney wrote to the SIAC, copying AGMS, stating that AGMS had \u201calready agreed to withdraw the \u2026 matter\u201d, and thus requesting the Tribunal to \u201clay by the proceedings of the Arbitration\u201d. He informed the SIAC that a \u201ccopy of the agreement signed by the Claimant and Respondent [would] be sent by Registered post \u2026 shortly\u201d. The attorney also forwarded a letter from RALL which stated, inter alia:', '21\\u2003The settlement is encapsulated in a memorandum of understanding (\u201cMOU\u201d) dated 20 October 2015 signed by the parties. The pertinent clauses of the MOU are set out at [87] and [88] below. Basically, the MOU provided for AGMS to pay certain sums to RALL, for RALL to waive part of one of its claims against AGMS and for each party to withdraw the arbitration\/legal proceedings it had commenced against the other.', '22\\u2003Some three days later however, on 15 November 2015, AGMS sent a letter to the Tribunal, stating that in the light of certain events that had recently transpired, it was \u201cnot in a position to withdraw\u201d the arbitration. It requested the Tribunal to make an \u201caward granting an interim injunction preventing [RALL] from terminating the [Master Agreement]\u201d. AGMS took the view that in the light of the developments detailed in its letter, there was no settlement and the arbitration remained afoot.', '23\\u2003RALL did not respond to AGMS\u2019 position. The Tribunal conducted the Preliminary Meeting on 16 November 2015. RALL did not attend or participate in any way. After the hearing, the Tribunal made an order directing RALL to inform the Tribunal of its position with regard to AGMS\u2019 application that the arbitration be proceeded with and for an interim injunction, and directing AGMS to file written submissions. While AGMS filed written submissions shortly thereafter, RALL did not respond to the Tribunal\u2019s direction.', '24\\u2003On 19 December 2105, the Tribunal, by a majority, issued an Interim Order (\u201cthe Order\u201d). The Order stated that RALL had \u201cfailed to ensure the continuity of the Master Agreement, which [went] to the root of the [MOU]\u201d. Thus, \u201cthe dispute referred to in the Statement of Claim of [AGMS] [was] still alive\u201d. The Tribunal noted the public policy objection raised by RALL (see [17] above), but did not discuss it. It concluded that the arbitration ought to proceed but stated that RALL was free to make objections in a procedurally proper manner in the course of the arbitration. The Tribunal did not, however, grant the interim injunction sought by AGMS.', '25\\u2003The third arbitrator issued a dissenting opinion in relation to jurisdiction (the \u201cDissent\u201d). He took the position that the settlement under the MOU remained in place. Therefore, AGMS\u2019s obligation to withdraw its claim in the arbitration subsisted. The Dissent stated that the \u201ceffect of AGMS\u2019s agreement to withdraw its claim in this Arbitration [was] that there [was] no longer any dispute before the Tribunal to arbitrate\u201d; thus, the \u201cTribunal should declare that the dispute ha[d] been settled\u201d.', '26\\u2003The Tribunal then proceeded with the arbitration. On 16 February 2016 and 27 April 2016, RALL made enquiries of the SIAC regarding the progress of the arbitration but did nothing else.', '27\\u2003AGMS sent its witness statement to the Tribunal, copying RALL, on 24 April 2016. At the same time, it also stated that it would be paying RALL\u2019s share of the costs of arbitration and, in order to foot these costs, it decreased its claim amount to US$5 million. On 5 May 2016, the Tribunal sent further directions on the dates of the substantive hearing to both parties. Shortly after, the SIAC sent an update of the status of the arbitration. The substantive hearing took place on 21 June 2016, and RALL was informed of this. RALL did not attend the hearing, and did not submit any post-hearing written submissions or submissions on costs. AGMS sent its post-hearing written submissions dated 8 July 2016 to the Tribunal and RALL.', '28\\u2003On 29 November 2016, the Tribunal issued the Final Award dated 24 November 2016 (\u201cthe Award\u201d). This was a majority decision; a dissenting opinion was issued by the third arbitrator. The Tribunal decided that RALL had breached cl 3.1 of the Master Agreement. RALL was ordered to pay AGMS US$5 million with interest at 5.98% for the breach and S$424,891.01 for the costs of the arbitral proceedings. The Award noted that RALL \u201cha[d] not taken part in the arbitration proceedings nor ha[d] [RALL] requested any sort of relief from the Tribunal by any valid form of response or defence recognised in terms of the SIAC Rules\u201d (Award at [114]). The Award addressed RALL\u2019s jurisdictional observation raised on 21 August 2015 (see [17] above) and held that the Tribunal had jurisdiction under cl 8 of the Master Agreement.', '29\\u2003The minority arbitrator took the view, inter alia, that RALL did not breach cl 3.1 of the Master Agreement because the assistance requested by AGMS fell outside the scope of the clause.', '30\\u2003RALL commenced proceedings in the High Court of Singapore to set aside the Award on 27 February 2017.

Up until 2015, the value of Mr Aathar and Mr Fan\u2019s shareholding in IHC was in excess of $166m. As we had stated earlier, Mr Aathar claims that he suffered heavy losses in his investments in 2015.', '10\\u2003OUELH alleges that around 2015, Mr Aathar and Mr Fan procured IHC to enter into a credit facility for up to $20m (\u201cthe Standby facility\u201d) with three investment funds, The Enterprise Fund III, Value Monetization III Ltd and VMF3 Ltd, which were managed by Crest Capital Asia Fund Management Pte Ltd, which was in turn a wholly-owned subsidiary of Crest Capital Asia Pte Ltd. These funds are collectively known as the \u201cCrest entities\u201d.', '11\\u2003$17.32m was drawn down on the Standby facility to purchase 59 million shares in IHC from April to September 2015. OUELH\u2019s allegations are the subject of Originating Summons No 380 of 2017 (\u201cOS 380\u201d). In proceedings separate from the present appeals, the High Court issued written grounds of decision on OS 380 on 13 November 2018: see International Healthway Corp Ltd v The Enterprise Fund III Ltd and others [2018] SGHC 246 (\u201cInternational Healthway Corp\u201d). The decision in International Healthway Corp is currently on appeal.', '12\\u2003Mr Aathar states that in September 2015, the Singapore Exchange (\u201cSGX\u201d) issued a trading advisory triggering a devaluation of his shares. These events triggered default provisions and led to calls and demands for payments for various loans, facilities, and guarantees.', '13\\u2003The respondents in these appeals are some of Mr Aathar\u2019s creditors:', '(a)\\u2003The respondent in the first appeal, Civil Appeal No 60 of 2018 (\u201cCA 60\u201d), is CIMB Securities (Singapore) Pte Ltd (\u201cCIMB\u201d).', '(b)\\u2003The respondent in the second appeal, Civil Appeal No 61 of 2018 (\u201cCA 61\u201d), is Citibank Singapore Limited (\u201cCitibank\u201d).', '(c)\\u2003The respondent in the third appeal, CA 62, is OUELH.', '(d)\\u2003The respondent in the fourth appeal, Civil Appeal No 63 of 2018 (\u201cCA 63\u201d), is KGI Securities (Singapore) Pte Ltd (formerly known as KGI Fraser Securities Pte Ltd) (\u201cKGI\u201d).', '14\\u2003On 2 February 2016, Citibank filed a bankruptcy petition against Mr Aathar. On 5 May 2016, Mr Aathar then filed an application under s 45 of the Act (\u201cs 45\u201d), proposing his first voluntary arrangement. Although Mr Aathar\u2019s first voluntary arrangement is not the subject of the present appeals, they provide the context for the present proceedings.', '15\\u2003Under his first proposal, Mr Aathar proposed paying his creditors in several tranches after claiming to have received an interest-free loan of $1.5m from an unnamed business associate. Mr Aathar also applied for an interim order, which had the effect of preventing any bankruptcy application being made against him, and other legal processes being commenced or continued against him without leave of court: see s 45. The debtor in a voluntary arrangement is required to appoint a nominee, who will, if the proposal is approved, supervise the implementation of the voluntary arrangement. For the purposes of his first proposed voluntary arrangement, Mr Aathar\u2019s nominee was an accountant.', '16\\u2003Mr Aathar\u2019s proposal received an 83% vote share in favour of the voluntary arrangement: see the AR GD at [5]. As a creditors\u2019 meeting could by special resolution (ie, by a three-fourths majority) approve a voluntary arrangement under s 51 of the Act and r 85(1) of the Rules, this meant that Mr Aathar\u2019s first voluntary arrangement had secured the requisite approval.', '17\\u2003Nevertheless, several dissenting creditors (which included several of the respondents in the present appeals) filed an application under s 54(1) of the Act, seeking that the court review and revoke the approval of the first voluntary arrangement. Among other things, the dissenting creditors alleged that Mr Aathar had failed to provide full and candid disclosure in his statement of affairs. The nominee was also alleged to have failed to properly adjudicate on the amount of debt each creditor was owed, and had essentially deferred entirely to Mr Aathar.', '18\\u2003The dissenting creditors\u2019 application was heard before an assistant registrar, who was of the view that Mr Aathar\u2019s lack of candour in his statement of affairs, and the first nominee\u2019s insistence in relying solely on the same, were material irregularities. Accordingly, he revoked the approval for Mr Aathar\u2019s first voluntary arrangement: see the AR GD at [10]\u2013[12], [49] and [50]. Although Mr Aathar filed a notice of appeal against the assistant registrar\u2019s decision, he subsequently withdrew his appeal on the day of the hearing itself.', '19\\u2003By this time, more than 12 months had passed since Mr Aathar\u2019s first attempt at a voluntary arrangement. On 21 June 2017, availing himself of s 48(1)(b) of the Act, Mr Aathar then applied for another interim order and proceeded to file a second proposal for a voluntary arrangement.', '20\\u2003Under his second proposal, Mr Aathar claimed there were \u201cultra-high networth persons who [were] prepared to help [him] in return for working and building a business for them\u201d. Mr Aathar stated that he had obtained a letter of commitment from a financial contributor who would contribute $3m. Mr Aathar proposed to pay the total of $3m in five progressively larger tranches to his creditors within 48 months and an additional $63,600 per year out of his own earnings. Mr Aathar\u2019s statement of accounts reflected a debt of $317.7m.', '21\\u2003For the purposes of the second voluntary arrangement, Mr Aathar appointed a senior legal practitioner as his nominee (\u201cthe Nominee\u201d). The Nominee wrote to Mr Aathar requesting further documentation pursuant to his second proposal. In particular, the Nominee asked Mr Aathar to identify his financial contributor. Mr Aathar replied, attaching a letter dated 20 June 2017 from PT Cahaya Bangun Sarana (\u201cPT Cahaya\u201d), which was signed by one \u201cHerman\u201d. The letter replicated the pay-out of the loan on the terms of the progressive payments referred to earlier.', '22\\u2003At this juncture, we note that this one-page letter did not appear to indicate any concrete terms of performance by Mr Aathar toward PT Cahaya or \u201cHerman\u201d, save that Mr Aathar was required to \u201ccontinue to remain to assist [them] to explore and advise business and operational opportunities in Indonesia in the healthcare and [commodities] business\u201d (sic).', '23\\u2003On 5 October 2017, the Nominee convened the first creditors\u2019 meeting. He indicated that he was in the process of assessing several of the creditors\u2019 claims, including those of OUELH and the Crest entities, as well as the supporting documents provided by the other creditors. The Nominee told the creditors present that he was aware that approval for Mr Aathar\u2019s first voluntary arrangement had been revoked by the court and as such they were \u201cproceeding with a great deal of caution\u201d.', '24\\u2003During the first creditors\u2019 meeting, several of the respondents\u2019 counsel raised issues with regard to the transparency and veracity of Mr Aathar\u2019s assets and debts. First, questions were asked about the significant debts owed to three Indonesian companies alone \u2013 PT Fajar Perkasa Trading, PT Berkah Tujuh Saudara and PT Entete Mining \u2013 which appeared to amount to $178m. OUELH was concerned that the documentation in support of these claims did not appear to be substantial. We pause here to note that the bona fides of any alleged creditor\u2019s claim in a creditors\u2019 meeting is of necessary importance. As approval for a proposed voluntary arrangement requires a three-fourths majority in value, the amount of a creditor\u2019s debt would necessarily affect its vote share, and the weight it could cast toward approval or rejection of a debtor\u2019s proposal.', '25\\u2003Second, it was pointed out that another creditor, Golden Cliff International Limited (\u201cGolden Cliff\u201d), had claimed $29.375m in debt, but shared an address with Mr Fan. As Mr Aathar was alleged to have owed Mr Fan $25m in debt under the first voluntary arrangement, Citibank was concerned that Golden Cliff was simply taking Mr Fan\u2019s place as a creditor. This would have been of some concern because Mr Fan had been adjudged a bankrupt in March 2017 and his claim could not count towards voting rights unless done so by his private trustee: see the GD at [41].', '26\\u2003Third, counsel for another creditor Mr Low See Ching (\u201cMr Low\u201d), queried why the debt for Mr Low had been reduced by the Nominee from $8m to $1.67m, whereas Mr Low had previously been given full credit of $8m under the first voluntary arrangement. OUELH also indicated that although its claim had been listed by Mr Aathar as $1.5m, in its own estimation the claim was $55m (a figure later revised down to $35m).', '27\\u2003Having heard the concerns of some of the creditors, the Nominee agreed to look into their queries and to scrutinise any supporting documents, which he assured them had to satisfy him beyond a prima facie level. He requested that the meeting be adjourned for two weeks for him to determine the claims.', '28\\u2003The Nominee convened a second creditors\u2019 meeting on 19 October 2017. He made available a list of liabilities to show how he had arrived at his adjudication of the claims. The Nominee invited the creditors to inspect the documents he had relied upon to reach his adjudication. Mr Aathar\u2019s counsel, who had been present to hear the creditors\u2019 concerns at the first creditors\u2019 meeting, was also present at this second meeting.', '29\\u2003The Nominee explained that he had adjudicated Golden Cliff\u2019s claim from $29.375m down to $3.064m based on the fact that this was the only amount for which he was able to find supporting documentation. He also adjudicated the contingent claims by the three Indonesian companies referred to at [24] above from $88m to zero.', '30\\u2003The Nominee had written \u201cUnable to determine\u201d next to his adjudication of the claims by Mr Low (claiming over $8m), the Crest entities (claiming over $59m), and IHC (claiming over $35m). We refer to these as the \u201cLitigation claims\u201d. When asked, the Nominee stated he meant that they had a zero value, but he was then asked to reconsider by Mr Low and OUELH\u2019s counsel on an \u201cobjected to\u201d basis pursuant to this Court\u2019s decision in The Royal Bank of Scotland NV (formerly known as ABN Amro Bank NV) and others v TT International Ltd and another appeal [2012] 2 SLR 213 (\u201cTT International\u201d). The Nominee then appeared to accede to the request and stated that he would indicate where he was \u201cnot able to take a position\u201d on the claims.', '31\\u2003The Nominee then conducted a vote. He indicated that, based on his preliminary calculations, if Mr Low\u2019s (voting against), Golden Cliff\u2019s (voting for), and the Crest entities\u2019 (voting against) claims were taken into account, Mr Aathar\u2019s proposal would not receive the requisite 75% approval. However, if those claims were not taken into account, there would be sufficient votes to pass Mr Aathar\u2019s second proposal. The meeting was then concluded as the Nominee proceeded to draw up his report.', '32\\u2003On 25 October 2017, the Nominee wrote to the creditors, indicating that Mr Aathar\u2019s second proposed voluntary arrangement had passed. He enclosed a copy of the creditors\u2019 meeting report (\u201cthe Nominee\u2019s Creditors\u2019 Meeting report\u201d), which indicated two sets of results. One set of results showed an approval figure of 80.07% on total liabilities of $202.4m. Significantly, even though OUELH, the Crest entities and Mr Low had all voted against the proposed voluntary arrangement, their votes were ascribed a nil value. In the other set of results, the Nominee admitted the Crest entities\u2019 and Mr Low\u2019s claims in full, while disregarding OUELH\u2019s claims. Under this set of results, Mr Aathar\u2019s proposal for the second voluntary arrangement would not pass as it received slightly less than 60% of the votes.'"}
{"casename":"2019_SGCA_35","fact":"facts  alone.\n13 On 11 April 2001, the applicant pleaded guilty  to five charges,  two of \nwhich concerned driving when he was not the holder  of a class  3 driving licence \non 29 September 2000 and on 30 November 2000,  together  with two \nconsequential offences of driving without insurance coverage. He was not \nlegally represented at this hearing. The two statements of facts were read to him \nin English  and he then presented a written mitigation plea. The District Court  \nimposed fines for all five charges and two concurrent DQs for 5 years  each in \nrespect of all classes of driving  licences  for the insurance offences.  The record \ndoes not mention if the applicant\u2019s CRO record  was tendered or whether  the \napplicant confirmed  it to be correct. The State Court\u2019s records in this case \ncontained a very faint copy of the applicant\u2019s CRO record which did not appear \nto contain  the 1977 errors.  When the first set of offences in question here were \ncommitted on 29 September 2000, the 1998 DQ (for a period  of 2 years) had \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nChong Sher Shen v  PP [2019] SGCA 35\n7already expired by 12 May 2000. Nonetheless,  the applicant did not re-apply for \na driving licence but chose to drive  on both occasions anyway.\n14 On 21 July 2005, the applicant pleaded  guilty to one charge of driving a \ncar while under DQ and one charge of driving without insurance cover. He was \nrepresented by Mr Lim Swee Tee. The record stated that his CRO  record  was \nadmitted, however a copy  of this CRO record was not in evidence before us \n(though it presumably  contained the 1977 errors as well). The Applicant was \ngiven two concurrent DQs  for 7 years  each.\n15 On 4 June 2009, the applicant  pleaded guilty to three charges of driving \nwhile under disqualification  on 22 October  2007, 12 February  2008, and 1 \nFebruary 2009  and one charge of driving  without insurance coverage  on 1 \nFebruary 2009. Two other related offences  were  admitted and taken into \nconsideration for sentencing.  At this hearing, he was represented by Mr Leonard \nLoo. The applicant\u2019s CRO record at the time of this hearing, which was not in \nevidence before  us, was read and admitted by the applicant at some  time past \n11am. The case was then stood down by the District Court to 3pm for mitigation \nand sentence.\n16 At 3pm, Mr Leonard Loo was recorded  to have said during  mitigation  \n(among other things):\n\u2026 My client  cannot understand why he committed the offences. \nBecause he knew that he did not have a driving licence, he \ndrove even more carefully  on the road. Admits folly and wishes \nto be given another chance so that he will not appear in Court  \nagain.\nThe applicant was  also allowed to address the  court in mitigation.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nChong Sher Shen v  PP [2019] SGCA 35\n817 For the four charges proceeded  with at this hearing, the applicant  was \nsentenced to imprisonment for three  months, four months, five months, and one \nmonth respectively, together with four concurrent  DQs for 14 years each. The \nDistrict Court  ordered  the four months and one-month imprisonment  terms  to \nrun consecutively, resulting in a total of only five months\u2019 imprisonment.  \nAlthough this was not in issue before us, it could be seen that the sentencing \nwas wrong  in law because consecutive sentences  must result in a term of \nimprisonment which  is longer than the longest imprisonment sentence imposed \nfor any individual charge (see Mohamed  Shouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor \n[2014] 2 SLR 998 at [77]).  Otherwise the result is that there  were actually no \nconsecutive imprisonment  terms as mandated by law. The applicant should  \ntherefore have been imprisoned for at least one month more and it was fortunate  \nfor him that no one  pointed out this error  in sentencing.\n18 Returning to the applicant\u2019s case,  the applicant\u2019s logic flowing  from [10] \nabove is that there should  have been  a DQ of less than one year in place  for the \n1998 charges.  If this were the case, his driving licence would still have been \nvalid after the expiry  of that DQ by late 1998 or early 1999 and his driving in \n2000 would not have  been an offence.  Similarly, if there were no offence \ncommitted in 2000, then there would be no DQ for five years in 2001 and it \nfollows that there would be no offence  committed  and therefore no DQ for seven \nyears in 2005. Since there  was no offence  committed  in 2005, there would also \nbe no offence committed  and no DQ  of 14 years in 2009.\n19 If the above was correct  and all the convictions  after 1998 were set aside, \nthe applicant\u2019s view was that for the pending cases in the State Courts, he \ncommitted no offence on 23 July 2015 when he was arrested for driving while  \nunder DQ and for not having third party  insurance coverage and on 16 June \n2017 when he drove a vehicle again.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nChong Sher Shen v  PP [2019] SGCA 35\n920 It follows from the above that the foundation of the applicant\u2019s claim of \ninjustice done to him is that the 1998 DQ would definitely have  been less than \none year if the CRO  containing the 1977 errors  had not been used by the \nprosecution in court at the hearing in May 1998. According to the applicant\u2019s \nlogic, all the subsequent  offences predicated  upon the 1998 DQ for two years \nwould not have taken place. However, as pointed out earlier and as we have  \nexplained in simple language to the applicant  in court, the applicant\u2019s premise  \nregarding the 1998 DQ is totally wrong and unsupportable on facts and in law. \nIt follows that his arguments built on and consequential upon this wrong \npremise cannot stand.\n21 The above  chronology also shows that the applicant could have pointed  \nout the 1977 errors over the years in court  but did not do so although he had the \nbenefit of defence counsel on most of the occasions. It is also plain from  the \napplicant\u2019s various  traffic  offences over the years  that he would drive a vehicle  \nwhenever the need arose, regardless of whether  or not he possessed a valid \ndriving licence  or was under DQ at those times. As the Prosecution pointed out, \nthe applicant knew  that he could have  re-applied for a driving licence after the \n1998 DQ for two years expired in May 2000. However,  for his own reasons, he \ndid not do so but proceeded to drive  a vehicle knowing he had no valid driving \nlicence. In addition, as we have indicated  at [17] above, his imprisonment term \nin 2009 ought  to have been longer  but that is something long past and should \nnot be resurrected as an  issue  now.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nChong Sher Shen v  PP [2019] SGCA 35\n1022 In the circumstances, we saw no legal  or factual basis for the applicant\u2019s \nCM before us.

{"casename":"2019_SGCA_37","fact":"'5\\u2003We do not propose to restate all the facts relating to the appellant\u2019s conviction. Much of this has been set out in Nagaenthran (CA) at [5]\u2013[15] (reproduced in Nagaenthran (Criminal Motion) at [9]). Very briefly, after officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (\u201cCNB\u201d) apprehended the appellant on 22 April 2009 as he was entering Singapore from Malaysia at the Woodlands Checkpoint, the appellant stated quite unequivocally in his contemporaneous statements to the CNB officers that the bundle that was found strapped to his thigh contained heroin. When asked why the bundle had been strapped to his thigh, the appellant answered that a friend, who he called \u201cKing\u201d, had done this so that no one else would find it.', '6\\u2003At trial however, the appellant denied having knowledge of the contents of the bundle. He claimed instead that King had only told him that the bundle contained \u201ccompany spares\u201d or \u201ccompany product\u201d: see Nagaenthran (Trial) at [10]. The appellant also advanced another assertion in his defence \u2013 that he had delivered the bundle under duress with King having put him under pressure. According to this version of the appellant\u2019s case, King had slapped and punched the appellant when the latter tried to resist King\u2019s attempts to strap the bundle onto his thigh. King had allegedly also threatened to kill the appellant\u2019s girlfriend if he did not do as he was told and bring the bundle into Singapore: Nagaenthran (Trial) at [10]. Notably, however, these allegations were not in the contemporaneous statement he made after he was first arrested on 22 April 2009.', '7\\u2003At the conclusion of the trial, on 22 November 2010, the appellant was found guilty and accordingly sentenced to death. The trial Judge made a number of findings including the following:', '(a)\\u2003The appellant\u2019s contemporaneous statements to the CNB officers had been provided voluntarily and recorded accurately: Nagaenthran (Trial) at [33].', '(b)\\u2003The appellant\u2019s allegations that King had assaulted him and threatened to kill his girlfriend if he did not deliver the drugs into Singapore were fabricated. He therefore failed to establish the defence of duress: Nagaenthran (Trial) at [18]\u2013[19].', '(c)\\u2003The appellant had actual knowledge of the contents of the bundle he had been tasked with delivering, namely, that it contained diamorphine: Nagaenthran (Trial) at [33]. This finding was based largely on the appellant\u2019s contemporaneous statement to the CNB officers, where he had stated unequivocally that the bundle strapped to his thigh contained heroin.', '8\\u2003On appeal, we affirmed all of the aforementioned findings: see Nagaenthran (CA) at [18]\u2013[19]. The mandatory death sentence was therefore upheld.', '9\\u2003After his conviction, while awaiting execution of his sentence, the appellant was referred in March 2013 to Dr Kenneth Koh of the Institute of Mental Health for a forensic psychiatric evaluation. This was for the purpose of assessing the appellant\u2019s suitability for resentencing under s 33B(1)(b) read with s 33B(3) of the MDA. In his report dated 11 April 2013, Dr Koh noted the appellant\u2019s account that King had assaulted him and threatened to kill his girlfriend if he did not deliver the bundle of drugs into Singapore. Dr Koh took the view that the appellant \u201chad no mental illness at the time of the offence\u201d and was \u201cnot clinically mentally retarded\u201d. Dr Koh also acknowledged that the appellant\u2019s \u201cborderline range of intelligence\u201d might have caused him to be more susceptible than a person of normal intelligence to over-estimating the reality of King\u2019s alleged threat to kill his girlfriend. That said, Dr Koh concluded that the appellant\u2019s borderline range of intelligence \u201cwould not have diminished his ability to appreciate that the package that was taped to his thigh would most likely have contained drugs and that bringing this to Singapore was illegal\u201d.', '10\\u2003The appellant was subsequently referred to a psychiatrist in private practice, Dr Ung Eng Khean, for a psychiatric assessment in support of the appellant\u2019s re-sentencing application in CM 16. Dr Ung assessed the appellant on 19 April and 19 July 2016. In his report of 22 August 2016, Dr Ung noted the appellant\u2019s claim that he had lied to Dr Koh when the latter had assessed him in March 2013. The appellant\u2019s account to Dr Ung was that he had agreed to deliver the drugs for King, whom he referred to as his \u201cboss\u201d, because he was desperate for money and felt compelled to obey King out of a mixture of loyalty, awe, fear and gratitude. The appellant did not mention that King had threatened to kill his girlfriend.', '11\\u2003In the light of Dr Ung\u2019s 22 August 2016 report, Dr Koh referred the appellant to Dr Patricia Yap, principal clinical psychologist at the Institute of Mental Health, for a neuropsychological assessment to explore whether the appellant could have been suffering from Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (\u201cADHD\u201d). Dr Yap assessed the appellant between November 2016 and January 2017, and issued a report dated 1 February 2017. What is relevant for the present purposes is the appellant\u2019s account to Dr Yap of the reasons for his offending. This took the form of his claim that he was a member of a gang, and that he had volunteered to transport the drugs on behalf of a fellow gang member who was reluctant to do so, and that he had done so out of a misguided sense of gang loyalty and gratitude to his \u201cboss\u201d. He stressed that he had not been coerced into delivering the drugs; he had acted voluntarily. The appellant also recounted that he had reason to believe that the package he was tasked to carry contained drugs, and that he had known, at the time, of the death penalty for drug trafficking in Singapore. Nonetheless, although he did not know the specific quantity of drugs that would attract the death penalty, he did not think that the amount of drugs he was carrying was sufficient to attract it.', '12\\u2003Based on Dr Yap\u2019s 1 February 2017 report, as well as Dr Ung\u2019s 22 August 2016 report, Dr Koh himself prepared a report dated 7 February 2017, in which he concluded, among other things, that \u201c[the appellant\u2019s] borderline intelligence and concurrent cognitive deficits may have contributed toward his misdirected loyalty and poor assessment of the risks in agreeing to carry out the offence\u201d.', '13\\u2003The full procedural history relevant to CA 98 was set out by the Judge in Nagaenthran (Judicial Review) at [10]\u2013[28]. For the present purposes, it is only necessary to highlight a few points.', '14\\u2003After the amendments to the MDA came into effect on 1 January 2013, the appellant provided information to the PP, on 26 February 2013, by way of a voluntary statement for the purposes of allowing the PP to make a determination under s 33B(2)(b) of the MDA as to whether the appellant had substantively assisted the CNB in disrupting drug trafficking activities within or outside Singapore (\u201cthe first set of information\u201d): Nagaenthran (Judicial Review) at [12]. It was common ground that the first set of information was not materially different to the information that the appellant had provided to the CNB officers in his contemporaneous statements at the time of his arrest in 2009.', '15\\u2003On 22 July 2013, Attorney-General Steven Chong Horng Siong (\u201cAG Chong\u201d), who was the PP at the time, considered the first set of information, additional information pertaining to operational matters, and the views of the CNB to determine whether, based on the first set of information, the appellant had substantively assisted the CNB in disrupting drug trafficking activities within or outside Singapore. AG Chong determined that the appellant had not substantively assisted the CNB in disrupting drug trafficking activities within or outside Singapore. The appellant was duly informed of the non-certification decision in August 2013: Nagaenthran (Judicial Review) at [13]. For the avoidance of doubt, we digress to explain that the non-certification decision that was the subject of OS 272 was made after the appellant furnished a second set of information in November 2013.', '16\\u2003On separate occasions in November 2013, March 2015 and September 2015, the appellant provided the second, third and fourth sets of information respectively, each of which, we are given to understand, contained some new information not previously contained in the other. These sets of information were separately considered, together with additional information pertaining to operational matters, and the views of the CNB in relation to whether, based on the relevant set of information, the appellant had substantively assisted the CNB in disrupting drug trafficking activities within or outside Singapore. None of these sets of information, however, gave rise to the outcome the appellant sought, which was the issuance of a certificate of substantive assistance pursuant to s 33B(2)(b) of the MDA.'"}
{"casename":"2019_SGCA_38","fact":"'5\\u2003The Appellant is a Nigerian citizen from the village of Oraifite in Nigeria. He was 28 years old at the time of the offence. Prior to coming to Singapore, he had worked in Nigeria for a supplier of fan belts for motor vehicles. He later set up his own business trading in fan belts in March 2010 but this failed within a year or so, and thereafter, he remained unemployed until the time of his arrest. His highest education level is Standard 6 at the primary level and he gave all his investigation statements as well as his evidence at the trial in the Ibo language through an interpreter.', '6\\u2003The broad sequence of events leading to the Appellant\u2019s arrest is not disputed. The Appellant applied for a passport for the first time in 2011 and it was issued on 19 April 2011. Sometime in August 2011, while in Nigeria, the Appellant contacted a childhood friend by the name of Chiedu Onwuku (\u201cChiedu\u201d) for financial assistance. Chiedu agreed that he would give the Appellant a sum of between 200,000 and 300,000 naira (\u201cNa\u201d) (approximately equivalent to between US$1,324 and US$1,986). Chiedu told the Appellant to contact him in October 2011 to arrange the payment. Sometime between August and October 2011, Chiedu visited the Appellant at his village and asked for and took the Appellant\u2019s passport \u201cto do something with\u201d, but did not tell him what that was. When the Appellant later called Chiedu in October, Chiedu told the Appellant to meet him in Lagos, Nigeria. The Appellant accordingly travelled to Lagos.', '7\\u2003There, on 10 November 2011, the Appellant met with another childhood friend, one Izuchukwu Ibekwe (\u201cIzuchukwu\u201d) (who, it appears, was also working with Chiedu). Izuchukwu instructed the Appellant to travel to Singapore on 12 November 2011 with a piece of luggage, which he was to hand over to someone in Singapore. On 12 November 2011, the Appellant went to Izuchukwu\u2019s home, where Izuchukwu handed the Appellant a brown trolley case, his passport, a set of travel and other documents and US$4,900 in cash. The Appellant was told that the contact details of the person to whom he was to deliver the case were written on the back of his e-Visa. On the reverse side of his e-Visa was written \u201cESP [XXXXXXXX]\u201d. ESP apparently refers to ESP Lines (S) Pte Ltd (\u201cESP\u201d), a Singapore company run by one Kervinn Leng Seng Yau (\u201cKervinn Leng\u201d) (the GD at [16]). It seems that unbeknownst to the Appellant, Kervinn Leng had sponsored his e-Visa and [XXXXXXXX] was Kervinn Leng\u2019s handphone number.', '8\\u2003Izuchukwu and Chiedu then drove the Appellant and another male Nigerian, who was not known to the Appellant, to the airport. Izuchukwu and Chiedu dropped the Appellant and the other Nigerian man off at the airport and left. The Appellant and the other Nigerian man then each went their own way in the airport.', '9\\u2003On 12 November 2011, the Appellant took a flight from Lagos to Singapore via Doha, Qatar. He arrived at Changi Airport Terminal 3 on 13 November 2011 at about 4.25pm. The other Nigerian man evidently also took the same flight and disembarked in Singapore. He is not otherwise relevant to the Appellant\u2019s conviction or to the present appeal.', '10\\u2003After passing through the Immigration checkpoint without incident, the Appellant was stopped at Customs as he was about to exit the Arrival Hall. His case was put through an X-ray machine and an image of darker density was observed on one side of the case. The case was then physically searched but nothing incriminating was found. It was therefore brought to the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (\u201cICA\u201d) Baggage Office for further inspection. The inner lining of one side of the bag was first cut and a packet wrapped in brown masking tape was found inside; the inner lining of the other side was then cut, revealing another packet wrapped in brown tape. A small cut was made on one of the packets and it was found to contain a white crystalline substance. The Appellant was placed under arrest for importing a controlled drug at about 8.25pm.', '11\\u2003Among the Appellant\u2019s other belongings were found:', '(a)\\u2003two calling cards, one labelled \u201cEjyke Investment Ltd\u201d and the other, \u201cEjidon International Ltd\u201d, both of which bore the Appellant\u2019s name and photograph and purported to identify him as a director; and', '(b)\\u2003a vaccination certificate.', 'These documents were false: the Appellant had never been involved with either of these companies, and he had also never been vaccinated.', '12\\u2003The Appellant was subsequently charged with importing two packets containing not less than 1,961g of methamphetamine. His cautioned statement read:', 'At first blush, this might seem to imply that the Appellant was aware that the drug packets were concealed within the case since he did not disavow knowledge of the presence of \u201cthose substance\u201d in the case, but merely denied knowing precisely what that substance was. However, the contents of the Appellant\u2019s cautioned statement \u2013 and, in particular, his apparent admission that he knew he had \u201cthose substance\u201d in his possession \u2013 could not be taken at face value in the light of the evidence given at the trial by the interpreter that the Appellant did in fact say that he had no idea what was inside the case. Given that evidence of the interpreter, we do not think that what the Appellant said in his cautioned statement can be taken as an admission that he was aware of the existence of the drugs that were hidden within the suitcase.', '13\\u2003The Appellant also gave six long statements. All were admitted in evidence without objection. In these statements, consistent with our view on the correct understanding of his cautioned statement, the Appellant said that he did not pack the case himself, did not know what the case contained or why he had to deliver it, did not think about its contents, and had never asked these questions of Chiedu or Izuchukwu. In addition, he also made the following claims:', '(a)\\u2003He did not trust Izuchukwu and Chiedu.', '(b)\\u2003Izuchukwu told him to deliver the case to somebody in Singapore. After clearing Immigration and Customs, he was supposed to take a taxi to his hotel, and the person who was to collect the case would then come to the hotel. He said, \u201cI could not remember which hotel I was supposed to go to. I also did not know how to contact the person. I also did not know the name of the person who would collect the case at the hotel.\u201d', '(c)\\u2003The sum of US$4,900 was for him to spend on food, travelling expenses and accommodation during his time in Singapore \u201cas and when necessary\u201d. He thought that if there was any remaining balance after his trip, he would have to return it to Chiedu. He expressly denied that this sum of money was to be passed to anybody in Singapore.'"}

In June 2012, the First Respondent sent a Letter of Acceptance (\u201cthe First LOA\u201d) to the Appellant which contained various contractual terms.

Between March 2014 and December 2015, the Appellant wrote various letters to the First Respondent seeking extensions of time to the contractual deadlines for the respective phases of the Sub-Contract works. These requests were all rejected by the First Respondent in a letter to the Appellant dated 18 December 2015.

The First Respondent also stated that it was entitled to recover liquidated damages from the Appellant for delays caused by the Appellant and that the claim for liquidated damages would be reflected in the First Respondent\u2019s next Payment Response. The First Respondent also set out its calculation of the liquidated damages, which totalled $26,422,000.', '26\\u2003Two days after the Delay Certificate was issued, the First Respondent lodged PR No 60 in which it claimed that the Appellant owed it $26,422,000 in liquidated damages.', '27\\u2003The Appellant eventually highlighted in a letter dated 19 October 2017 that the First Respondent\u2019s computation of the periods of delay for two sub-phases, 1B1 and 1B2, was erroneous.

The First Respondent did not dispute that its initial calculation of the periods of delay for these two sub-phases was erroneous, and it eventually \u201cre-assessed\u201d the period of inexcusable delays for these two sub-phases to be 52 days. It also reduced its liquidated damages claim for these sub-periods by around $3.68 million.', '28\\u2003On 15 August 2017 the Appellant\u2019s claim in AA 190\/2017 was allowed by the adjudicator (\u201cthe Adjudication Determination\u201d) who issued written grounds for his decision. As the First Respondent did not make payment of the sum awarded to the Appellant in the Adjudication Determination, the Appellant filed Originating Summons No 975 of 2017 (\u201cOS 975\u201d) on 28 August 2017 for leave to enforce the Adjudication Determination in the same manner as a judgment or an order under s 27(1) of the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act (Cap 30B, 2006 Rev Ed). Subsequently, the First Respondent applied successfully to set aside the Adjudication Determination (see: Bintai Kindenko Pte Ltd v Samsung C&T Corp [2018] 2 SLR 532), though nothing in this appeal turns on this point.', '29\\u2003On the same day that OS 975 was filed (ie, 28 August 2017), the First Respondent wrote to the Second Respondent to demand payment on the BG for the guaranteed sum. It appeared that the Second Respondent had informed the First Respondent that payment would take one week. On 29 August 2017, the First Respondent\u2019s solicitors wrote to the Second Respondent to demand immediate payment of the guaranteed sum according to the terms of the BG. Apart from the $26,422,000 liquidated damages claim, the First Respondent\u2019s solicitors also claimed that the Appellant owed it over $4 million for claims involving damages in respect of the other trades\u2019 works, omissions from the Appellant\u2019s scope of Sub-Contract works and damage from water ingress to a lift shaft caused by the Appellant.', '30\\u2003At this juncture, we note that there was no evidence of the Employer having commenced any formal claim against the First Respondent for the delays in completing the Project. Counsel for the First Respondent confirmed this at the hearing. He also informed the Court of his instructions that there were some discussions between the First Respondent and the Employer on liability for the delays but they eventually agreed on a confidential settlement of the matter.', '31\\u2003The Appellant became aware of the First Respondent\u2019s call on the BG on 28 August 2017 and it commenced Suit No 800 of 2017 the next day. The Appellant also took out Summons No 3934 of 2017 (\u201cSUM 3934\u201d), an ex parte application for an interim injunction to restrain the First Respondent from calling on the BG and the Second Respondent from paying out on the BG. On 29 August 2017, the Judge granted an ex parte interim injunction to that effect (\u201cthe Interim Injunction\u201d).', '32\\u2003Subsequently, the First Respondent applied for the discharge of the Interim Injunction via Summons No 4313 of 2017 (\u201cSUM 4313\u201d). On 30 November 2017, the Judge granted the application and discharged the Interim Injunction.', '33\\u2003Dissatisfied, the Appellant sought the Judge\u2019s leave to appeal against his decision in SUM 4313. The Judge dismissed the application. Subsequently, the Appellant obtained this Court\u2019s leave to appeal against the Judge\u2019s decision in SUM 4313 (\u201cthe CA leave application\u201d).', '34\\u2003Pursuant to the leave granted, the Appellant appealed against the Judge\u2019s decision to discharge the ex parte Interim Injunction.'"}

The Respondent retails solar energy to consumers in Singapore. It is the registered proprietor of a Singapore patent based on Singapore Patent Application No 10201405341Y (\u201cthe Patent\u201d) filed on 29 August 2014 and granted on 8 June 2016. This patent is in respect of a power grid system and a method of determining power consumption at building connections in the system.', '20\\u2003The first appellant, Sunseap Group Pte Ltd, is the parent and holding company of the second and third appellants. The second appellant, Sunseap Energy Pte Ltd, is a licensed electricity retailer while the third appellant, Sunseap Leasing Pte Ltd, develops and manages rooftop solar photovoltaic systems. We will refer to these three entities collectively as \u201cthe Appellants\u201d.', '21\\u2003On 18 November 2016, the Respondent commenced the Suit in which it claimed that the Appellants jointly or severally infringed eight out of 12 claims in the Patent. These eight claims (ie, claims 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10 and 11) are referred to collectively as the \u201cAsserted Claims\u201d. The remaining four claims in respect of which no infringement is alleged (ie, claims 2, 6, 8 and 12) are referred to collectively as the \u201cUnasserted Claims\u201d.', '22\\u2003In response, the Appellants denied all the allegations of infringement. One basis for their denial was that the Patent is and has been at all material times invalid, for the reasons set out in the Particulars of Objection dated 5 January 2017. The objections grounded on the lack of novelty and the lack of inventive step were made in respect of all the claims in the Patent and not merely the Asserted Claims. Additionally, there was a separate objection based on insufficiency made in respect of only two of the Asserted Claims. 1', '23\\u2003In their Defence and Counterclaim (\u201cD&CC\u201d), the Appellants asked for the following relief: 2', '24\\u2003On 17 March 2017, the Respondent filed Summons No 1221 of 2017 (\u201cSUM 1221\u201d), which is an application under O 18 r 19 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (\u201cROC\u201d), to strike out certain portions of the D&CC and the Particulars of Objection to the extent that the validity of the Unasserted Claims had been put in issue improperly. In relation to the D&CC, the Respondent sought to strike out paras 4 and 14 (in the \u201cDefence\u201d section) and para 16 (in the \u201cCounterclaim\u201d section):', '25\\u2003In relation to the Particulars of Objection, the Respondent sought to strike out para 1:', '26\\u2003Subsequently, the Respondent sought and was granted leave to amend the summons for striking out such that it now sought to strike out para 16 of the D&CC in its entirety and not merely in respect of the Unasserted Claims. In effect, the Respondent was asserting that the Appellants could not put in issue the validity of any of the claims of the Patent by way of counterclaim in infringement proceedings.', '27\\u2003On 4 May 2017, Assistant Registrar Justin Yeo (\u201cthe AR\u201d) delivered his decision on SUM 1221 (see Sun Electric Pte Ltd v Sunseap Group Pte Ltd and others [2017] SGHCR 6). Two of the AR\u2019s holdings are of particular relevance to the issue before this Court. First, the AR held that the validity of the Unasserted Claims could not be put in issue by way of defence in infringement proceedings, pursuant to s 82(1)(a). In his opinion, a defendant in infringement proceedings is limited to challenging only the claims that have been asserted by the plaintiff to have been infringed. Accordingly, the AR ordered that the Appellants amend paras 4 and 14 of the D&CC, as follows:', '28\\u2003Second, the AR held that revocation proceedings could be commenced in the High Court at first instance, particularly where infringement proceedings are already before the High Court and revocation proceedings are brought by way of counterclaim. Accordingly, the validity of all the claims in the Patent could be put in issue by way of counterclaim in infringement proceedings. The AR thus declined to strike out para 16 of the D&CC and para 1 of the Particulars of Objection. Instead, he ordered the Appellants to amend para 16 of the D&CC in the interests of clarity, in the following terms:', '29\\u2003The AR\u2019s decision meant effectively that the Appellants were entitled to put in issue the validity of both the Asserted Claims (by way of defence) and the Unasserted Claims (by way of counterclaim) in infringement proceedings before the High Court. The Respondent appealed against only the second aspect of the AR\u2019s decision. There was no appeal against the AR\u2019s decision that the validity of the Unasserted Claims could not be challenged by way of defence. There was also no appeal against his orders that paras 4 and 14 of the D&CC be amended or against any other part of his decision.', '30\\u2003The Respondent\u2019s appeal in Registrar\u2019s Appeal No 135 of 2017 (\u201cRA 135\u201d) came before George Wei J (\u201cthe Judge\u201d). The Judge framed the main substantive question before the court as follows (at [2] of the Judgment): can patent revocation proceedings be properly brought before the High Court at first instance, by way of counterclaim in infringement proceedings before the Court? If this question were answered in the negative, then the prayers for an order of revocation in the pleadings would be liable to be struck out under any of the four limbs of O 18 r 19 of the ROC (at [18] of the Judgment). In the present case, this would mean that para 16 of the D&CC and para 1 of the Particulars of Objection should be struck out. It would also mean that prayers 1 and 2 of the D&CC \u2013 for a declaration that the Patent is and has always been invalid and an order that the Patent be revoked respectively \u2013 should be struck out as well (at [27(b)] and [104] of the Judgment).', '31\\u2003For present purposes, we need to focus on only four key aspects of the Judge\u2019s analysis leading to his conclusion that the High Court has no original jurisdiction to hear revocation proceedings by way of application or to grant a prayer for revocation.', '32\\u2003The first key aspect relates to the in rem nature of an order for patent revocation. It is accepted that a granted patent is a right in rem because the public at large is bound by a granted patent (at [70] of the Judgment). Given that a claim for patent revocation involves the determination of the status of a res or a thing for the very purpose of removing it from the register and depriving the patent-holder of the rights in rem bestowed on him as against the world, the Judge concluded that in rem jurisdiction is necessary to make an order revoking a patent (at [158] and [168]\u2013[169] of the Judgment).', '33\\u2003The second key aspect of the Judgment is the Judge\u2019s analysis of Parliament\u2019s intention. The Judge considered the general legislative intention behind the precursor to the PA, the Patents Act 1994 (Act 21 of 1994) (\u201cPA 1994\u201d), which introduced the change from the self-assessment system of patent registration to the positive grant system. The remarks of the then-Minister for Law Prof S Jayakumar at the second reading of the Patents Bill (Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (21 March 1994) vol 6 at col 1447)) were of particular importance:', '34\\u2003The Appellants argued below (as they do on appeal) that since Parliament\u2019s broader intention in moving disputes concerning the validity of patents from the courts to the Registry was to save costs in patent litigation, this goal would be subverted should the High Court be unable to hear revocation proceedings even by way of counterclaim when infringement proceedings in respect of the same patent were already before the court (at [123] of the Judgment).', '35\\u2003In response, the Judge opined that these concerns about parallel proceedings and costs could have been overstated. On the first point, he took the view that Parliament must have been aware of the possibility that an application for revocation under s 80 to the Registrar might be made after the commencement of infringement proceedings in the High Court and in circumstances where the defendant had mounted a defence that raises invalidity. In such cases, pursuant to s 82(7), leave is required before revocation proceedings may be brought before the Registrar. In this manner, s 82(7) acts as a \u201chousekeeping provision\u201d to mitigate any unnecessary costs and confusion that may arise from parallel proceedings on validity in different fora (at [127] and [139] of the Judgment). On the second point, the Judge disagreed that the filing of an additional application for revocation to the Registrar would be unnecessary or costly. In his view, the Registrar hearing the revocation application would be able to rely on, or at least refer to, the findings on invalidity made by the High Court in respect of the asserted claims (at [128] of the Judgment).', '36\\u2003The Judge then concluded that based on the provisions of the PA as a whole and the prevailing circumstances when the Patents Bill was being considered by Parliament in 1994, it was likely that Prof Jayakumar did not have in mind the specific question of whether the High Court should also possess the jurisdiction to hear and decide revocation proceedings by way of counterclaim where infringement proceedings were already properly before the court, when he made that general statement on litigation costs (as set out at [33] above).', '37\\u2003The Judge went on to consider statements that were made in Parliament sittings after the enactment of the PA 1994. Specifically, he considered the second reading of the Patents (Amendment) Bill (No 13 of 2012), where Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law, Ms Sim Ann, referred to the High Court\u2019s decision in ASM Assembly Automation Pte Ltd v Aurigin Technology Pte Ltd and others [2010] 1 SLR 1 (\u201cASM\u201d). By way of background, ASM was a case where only certain claims of the patent were asserted to have been infringed but the defendants counterclaimed for the revocation of the entire patent, among other relief. Tan Lee Meng J made findings on the validity of each of the asserted claims and ordered that the patent be revoked but did not deal expressly with the unasserted claims. Ms Sim Ann said that ASM was an example of a case where the defendant had succeeded in defending an infringement action \u201cand even managed to successfully revoke the ASM patent\u201d (Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (10 July 2012) vol 89 at p 417). However, in the Judge\u2019s view, Ms Sim Ann\u2019s comment was made in the context of the change from a self-assessment system to a positive grant system. It therefore did not assist in determining whether the PA was intended to confer jurisdiction on the High Court to hear revocation applications or to grant an order for revocation in the exercise of its original jurisdiction (at [130] of the Judgment).', '38\\u2003Overall, the Judge did not think that Parliamentary debates shed much light on the issue at hand and thus turned to consider the provisions of the PA. This brings us to the third key aspect to be highlighted, which is the Judge\u2019s analysis of ss 80(1), 82(7) and 91(1).', '39\\u2003With regard to s 80(1), the Judge noted that it was the sole statutory provision in the PA relating to applications for revocation and that on a literal and black-letter interpretation, it only provided that the Registrar may revoke a patent but was entirely silent on whether the High Court may do so (at [132] and [135] of the Judgment). Section 80(1) was based on s 72(1) of the UK Patents Act 1977 (c 37) (UK) (\u201cUKPA\u201d). The key difference between the two is that the latter provides expressly that the power to revoke a patent on application is vested in both the court and the comptroller (ie, the equivalent in the UK of the Registrar in our context). The UK provision reads:', 'This naturally raises the question as to why Parliament omitted any reference to the High Court when adapting s 80(1) from s 72(1) of the UKPA. As alluded to briefly at [10] above, this formed the basis of the Respondent\u2019s argument (both in the High Court and on appeal) that Parliament\u2019s deliberate omission of references to the \u201ccourt\u201d was a clear manifestation of its intention to restrict revocation proceedings at first instance to the Registrar only.', '40\\u2003Nonetheless, the Judge accepted that it could be argued that s 80(1) by itself simply empowers the Registrar to revoke a patent upon application but does not necessarily exclude the High Court from granting revocation orders on the basis of invalidity. He noted that s 80(1) begins with the qualifier \u201c[s]ubject to the provisions of this Act\u201d (at [135] of the Judgment).', '41\\u2003In relation to s 82(7), the Judge rejected the Appellants\u2019 argument that the purpose of this provision was to avoid duplicative proceedings in two fora and thus showed that Parliament intended for both the High Court and the Registrar to hear revocation proceedings. Instead, the Judge agreed with the Respondent that s 82(7) made sense even if the High Court did not have jurisdiction to hear revocation proceedings. This was on the basis that issues of validity could arise outside the context of revocation proceedings (eg, by way of defence in infringement proceedings or in groundless threat proceedings). Therefore, the effect of s 82(7) in controlling duplicative or parallel proceedings before the Registrar could apply in those other situations as well. Accordingly, s 82(7) did not necessarily suggest that the Parliament had envisioned that both the High Court and the Registrar should have original jurisdiction over revocation proceedings (at [137] and [139] of the Judgment).', '42\\u2003Although the Appellants argued that a party may be left without a remedy if the High Court cannot hear revocation applications and yet denies leave under s 82(7), the Judge thought this was an unfounded concern. He pointed out that s 82(7) only applies while proceedings are pending before the High Court and does not prevent a party from pursuing revocation before the Registrar when the court proceedings are over. Further, a party who succeeds in obtaining a declaration of invalidity can and must apply to register that order in the patent register to give the public notice of that decision. This would greatly reduce any mischief that could arise from the High Court not having the jurisdiction or the power to revoke a patent (at [142]\u2013[143] of the Judgment).', '43\\u2003The Judge further observed that the PA does not contain any provision akin to s 72(7) of the UKPA. That provision reads:', 'As can be seen, s 72(7) of the UKPA contemplates the possibility of parallel revocation proceedings before the court and the comptroller and provides that generally, a party may not apply to the court for revocation when there are pending proceedings before the comptroller. In other words, it is the counterpart to s 82(7) except that it applies specifically to revocation proceedings and deals with the reverse situation where there are pending proceedings before the comptroller instead of the court. Viewed in this way, the inclusion of s 82(7) in the PA together with the omission of s 72(7) of the UKPA made it more likely that Parliament did not intend to vest the High Court with original jurisdiction to hear and determine revocation applications (at [140] of the Judgment).', '44\\u2003The Judge therefore concluded that s 82(7) was not conclusive on the question of jurisdiction. When read in the light of other provisions of the PA, it was equally consistent with the view that the High Court was not intended to hear revocation applications in the exercise of original jurisdiction.', '45\\u2003Moving on to s 91(1), the Judge noted that academic works appeared to be of the view that this provision is the basis of the High Court\u2019s ability to hear revocation proceedings at first instance. In Ng-Loy Wee Loon, Law of Intellectual Property of Singapore (Sweet & Maxwell, 2nd Ed, 2014), para 30.0.6 states that \u201c[a]n application for revocation under s 80(1) may be made to the Registrar of Patents or to the High Court.\u201d At a footnote to that paragraph, the learned author adds that \u201c[t]he power of the High Court to hear revocation proceedings is found in s 91(1)\u201d. In a similar vein, A Guide to Patent Law in Singapore (Alban Kang gen ed) (Sweet & Maxwell, 2nd Ed, 2009) states:', '46\\u2003Nonetheless, the Judge considered that these academic texts did not consider in much detail the precise jurisdictional basis upon which the court\u2019s purported original jurisdiction over revocation proceedings is founded. The authors could be merely declaring the existing practice. As the Judge acknowledged, there have been numerous cases in which the High Court granted revocation orders when hearing counterclaims for revocation in infringement proceedings (at [116] and [118] of the Judgment). However, the court\u2019s jurisdiction could not be established on the mere basis of such a practice. Jurisdiction is conferred by statute and that is a question of law to be determined by reference to the relevant statute (at [121] of the Judgment).', '47\\u2003The Judge then turned to analyse s 91(1), with reference to the following propositions set out in this Court\u2019s decision in Re Nalpon Zero Geraldo Mario [2013] 3 SLR 258:', '(a)\\u2003The \u201cjurisdiction\u201d of a court is to be distinguished from its \u201cpowers\u201d. The \u201cjurisdiction\u201d of a court refers to its authority, however derived, to hear and determine a dispute that is brought before it. The \u201cpowers\u201d of a court constitute its capacity to give effect to its determination by making or granting the orders or reliefs sought by the successful party to the dispute (at [31]).', '(b)\\u2003It is only after the court\u2019s jurisdiction is established that the court\u2019s power can be exercised (at [45]).', '(c)\\u2003The jurisdiction of a court must be conferred by the statute constituting it (at [14]).', '48\\u2003Bearing these propositions in mind, the Judge observed that although s 91(1) grants the High Court, in determining any question in the exercise of its original or appellate jurisdiction, the powers which the Registrar possesses for determining the same question, that provision does not address the more fundamental question of what original and appellate jurisdiction the PA confers upon the High Court. In this regard, it was clear that the High Court could determine questions on revocation under s 80 in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction over decisions of the Registrar, by virtue of s 90(1) (see [15] above). However, the question of whether revocation proceedings fell within the High Court\u2019s original jurisdiction demanded careful consideration.', '49\\u2003The Judge next considered s 16(1) of the SCJA, which is the fourth and final key aspect of the Judgment. As stated in Yeo Tiong Min SC, \u201cJurisdiction of the Singapore Courts\u201d in The Singapore Legal System (Kevin YL Tan ed) (Singapore University Press, 2nd Ed, 1999) (\u201cYeo on Jurisdiction\u201d) at p 257, s 16(1) of the SCJA is the basis of the High Court\u2019s in personam jurisdiction and unlimited subject matter jurisdiction. However, in the light of the Judge\u2019s conclusion that in rem jurisdiction is necessary to make an order revoking a patent (see [32] above), s 16(1) of the SCJA could not assist the Appellants\u2019 case that the High Court has the relevant original jurisdiction.', '50\\u2003After analysing the law, the Judge concluded that the High Court has no original jurisdiction to hear and determine revocation proceedings. Without such jurisdiction, no powers of the Registrar in respect of revocation applications under s 80, including the power to revoke a patent, could vest in the High Court by operation of s 91(1) (at [167] and [169] of the Judgment).', '51\\u2003Accordingly, the Judge allowed RA 135 and made the following orders:', '(a)\\u2003that para 16 of the D&CC be amended to read:', '(b)\\u2003that prayer 2 of the D&CC for an order that the Patent be revoked be struck out;', '(c)\\u2003that para 1 of the Particulars of Objection be amended to remove all references to the invalidity of the Unasserted Claims and to revocation; and', '(d)\\u2003costs in favour of the Respondent.'"}

She wanted to remit money to pay these taxes but she did not have a bank account or a company to receive the money as she was a foreigner. She therefore needed the applicant to help her receive about US$100,000 into his bank account. The applicant agreed.', '7\\u2003On 15 May 2013, Laura requested that the applicant receive a larger amount of money for her instead \u2013 some US$420,000. She explained that her customer had ordered more goods and wanted to pay the full price instead of just half the price, and that she also needed some money to pay for a condominium apartment. Laura promised the applicant that he could retain about US$15,000 to cover any tax liabilities that arose and as an incentive. The applicant agreed.', '8\\u2003The next day, the applicant received the US$420,000 (which amounted to S$520,590) into his DBS bank account.

The respondent in both the substantive appeal and this summons is VTB Bank (Public Joint Stock Company) (\u201cVTB\u201d), a state-owned Russian bank. On 3 November 2017, Anan and VTB entered into a global master repurchase agreement (\u201cGMRA\u201d) under which Anan would sell VTB global depository receipts (\u201cGDRs\u201d) of shares in EN+ Group PLC (\u201cEN+\u201d) and then repurchase the GDRs from VTB at a later date at pre-agreed rates. The pre-agreed rates that Anan would need to pay VTB at the date of repurchase amounted in essence to the original purchase price paid by VTB plus interests and other costs. Thus, it was clear that despite the structure of the transaction as a sale and repurchase, this was in substance a loan from VTB to Anan.', '6\\u2003Under this arrangement and according to the GMRA, Anan was under an obligation to maintain sufficient collateral, with the level of collateral being measured by an indicator known as the Repo Ratio. The Repo Ratio is calculated based on the purchase price of the GDRs under the GMRA plus accrued interest, divided by the prevailing value of the GDRs. 1', 'Under the GMRA, Anan was required to maintain the Repo Ratio at a level below what is known as the Margin Trigger Repo Ratio of 60%, failing which VTB could exercise its contractual right to call on Anan to top up the amount of collateral. 2', 'Anan was also under an obligation to maintain the Repo Ratio at a level below what is known as the Liquidation Repo Ratio of 75%. The calculation of whether the Repo Ratio rises above the Margin Trigger Repo Ratio of 60% or whether it rises above the Liquidation Repo Ratio of 75% differs slightly in that the latter takes into account various additional costs. Failure to top up the requisite amount of collateral when the Repo Ratio rises above the Margin Trigger Repo Ratio of 60% constitutes an event of default under the GMRA, 3', 'as does the situation where the Repo Ratio rises above the Liquidation Repo Ratio of 75%. 4', '7\\u2003Pursuant to the GMRA, Anan sold VTB 35,714,295 EN+ GDRs for approximately US$250m, at which time EN+ shares were worth approximately US$13 per share. A few months later, on 6 April 2018, EN+ shares plummeted to about US$5.60 per share as a result of sanctions imposed on major shareholders of EN+ by the United States Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cthe OFAC sanctions\u201d). On the same day as the OFAC sanctions (ie, 6 April 2018), VTB issued a margin trigger event notice, informing Anan that the Repo Ratio was at approximately 74.57%, thus exceeding the Margin Trigger Repo Ratio of 60%. In this notice, VTB asked Anan to top up a cash margin of approximately US$85m by 10 April 2018 purportedly in accordance with cl 2(a) of the GMRA. 5', 'Anan failed to restore its collateral by transferring the cash margin within the stipulated timeframe.', '8\\u2003On 12 April 2018, VTB sent a default notice to Anan, designating 16 April 2018 as the early termination date of the GMRA. According to this notice, two events of default had occurred \u2013 first, the Repo Ratio had exceeded the Liquidation Repo Ratio of 75%, thus constituting a liquidation event and an event of default under the GMRA; second, the Repo Ratio had exceeded the Margin Trigger Repo Ratio of 60% and Anan had failed to top up a cash margin of US$85m by 10 April 2018 as stipulated, and this constituted a further event of default under the GMRA. 6', '9\\u2003The legal effect of an early termination under the GMRA was that the repurchase date was brought forward to the early termination date, such that Anan was required to repurchase the GDRs at the original purchase price plus accrued interests to this date. 7', 'In other words, Anan was compelled to repay the \u201cloan\u201d to VTB on the early termination date. What then occurs in such a case is a setting-off of the payments owed by each party, which the non-defaulting party is entitled to calculate.', '10\\u2003On 24 April 2018, VTB as the non-defaulting party sent a calculation notice to Anan stating that an outstanding debt of some US$170m was owing. This sum was arrived at by calculating the outstanding amount owed (ie, the purchase price plus interests), minus the total value of the GDRs held by VTB, which VTB ascertained to be worth US$2.50 each. VTB had arrived at the figure of US$2.50 by calling for quotations from 14 institutions, of which only two responded with indicative quotes of US$1 and US$5. VTB then purported to take an arithmetic mean of the two quotations to arrive at the valuation of US$2.50 per GDR. 8', 'It would be self-evident that this arithmetic average was erroneous. The average of US$1 and US$5 is US$3 and not US$2.50, though it would appear that this error might not be crucial for present purposes.', '11\\u2003On 23 July 2018, VTB served a statutory demand for the sum of approximately US$170m, which sum Anan failed to repay within the three- weeks period. This statutory demand then formed the basis of the winding-up petition, HC\/CWU 183\/2018 (\u201cCWU 183\u201d), presented by VTB against Anan.', '12\\u2003CWU 183 was presented by VTB on 17 August 2018. At the hearing of CWU 183 on 7 September 2018, Anan disputed the debt owed to VTB, arguing that the OFAC sanctions which caused the value of the GDRs to fall was an act of frustration as well as a force majeure event. Anan also argued in the alternative that the quantification of the debt of US$170m was erroneous, but this appeared to be a bare assertion focused largely on VTB\u2019s unsubstantiated calculations of \u201chedge unwind costs\u201d, \u201cappropriate market\u201d, \u201cnet value\u201d and the interest rate used. 9', '13\\u2003The High Court judge (\u201cthe Judge\u201d) granted the application in CWU 183 and ordered Anan to be wound up (see, VTB Bank (Public Joint Stock Co) v Anan Group (Singapore) Pte Ltd [2018] SGHC 250). The main point of contention in that hearing centred on the applicable standard of proof of a disputed debt when that debt is subject to an arbitration agreement between the parties. As this issue is anticipated to take centre stage in the substantive appeal in CA\/CA 174\/2018 (\u201cCA 174\u201d), we shall say no more of the matter here. The Judge found Anan\u2019s arguments on frustration and force majeure to be unconvincing. The Judge also found that Anan had deliberately failed to particularise its case on the issue of the quantification of the debt, because it knew that in any case a substantial debt far in excess of the statutory insolvency threshold of $10,000 would be owing and that this debt would provide a sufficient basis for the granting of a winding-up order. 10', 'We should add that Anan is no longer pursuing the frustration and force majeure arguments for the purposes of the appeal.', '14\\u2003The substantive appeal in CA 174 thus focuses on two issues: first, the applicable standard of proof where a debt governed by an arbitration agreement is disputed; second, whether this standard of proof is met in the instant case given the dispute over the quantum of debt owed by Anan to VTB.', '15\\u2003The present application was filed by Anan to adduce new evidence for CA 174 in the form of the affidavit of Andrew Ooi Lih De dated 22 March 2019 which exhibited a report prepared by Deloitte (the \u201cDeloitte Report\u201d). The Deloitte Report opines that the GDRs ought to have been valued at between US$8.01 and US$8.68 each as at the early termination date of 16 April 2018. The Deloitte Report further comments on the methodology adopted by VTB in arriving at its valuation of US$2.50. The implications of this are clear \u2013 if the valuation in the Deloitte Report were to be adopted, it would mean that the GDRs were collectively worth between US$286m and US$310m as at 16 April 2018, and thus that no debt was due and owing from Anan to VTB at the material time.', '16\\u2003VTB opposed the application on the basis that the requirements in Ladd v Marshall had not been satisfied. Notably, it took the position that the first requirement of non-availability had not been fulfilled \u2013 it argued that the Deloitte Report could clearly have been adduced in CWU 183 or before, and Anan has not provided any reasons to explain why it was not adduced before the Judge. On the other hand, Anan argued that the requirement of non-availability should not be applied strictly in the present case given that the hearing below did not have the characteristics of a full trial.', '17\\u2003It became evident at this juncture that the parties\u2019 respective positions were poles apart as regards the applicability of Ladd v Marshall to the present summons, and it is to this issue that we shall now examine.'"}
{"casename":"2019_SGCA_42","fact":"'7\\u2003We begin with an explanation of the relevant parties and the material background events.', '8\\u2003The respondent, Mr Jhaveri Darsan Jitendra, was a family friend of the appellant, Mdm Lakshmi Anil Salgaocar and her late husband, Mr Anil Vassudeva Salgaocar (\u201cMr Anil\u201d). The respondent and Mr Anil had a longstanding business relationship which began in the late 1980s. 1', '9\\u2003The main dispute between the parties that is of relevance to the present proceedings concerns the ownership of a single share in a BVI-incorporated company, Million Dragon Wealth Ltd (\u201cMDWL\u201d) (\u201cthe Share\u201d). MDWL is in turn the sole shareholder of 22 other BVI-incorporated companies (\u201cthe Subsidiaries\u201d). Each of the Subsidiaries own one unit in a condominium development in Singapore known as Newton Imperial. 2', 'The units are rented out, and the rental income is collected in Singapore by a Singapore law firm, Messrs Haridass Ho & Partners, and held in bank accounts in Singapore pursuant to an escrow agreement. 3', '10\\u2003Prior to July 2014, the Share was registered in the name of the respondent\u2019s daughter, Ms Pooja Darsan Jhaveri (\u201cMs Pooja\u201d) who held the Share as the respondent\u2019s nominee. On 8 July 2014, Ms Pooja executed a memorandum transferring the Share to Mr Anil for the nominal sum of US$1 (\u201cthe 2014 share transfer\u201d). 4', '11\\u2003The basis of the 2014 share transfer is disputed between the parties. Briefly, Mr Anil\u2019s position is that the share transfer was executed in order for the respondent to return the 22 units in Newton Imperial to him, which he alleges was wrongfully conveyed to the Subsidiaries by the respondent. On this account, the transfer is said to constitute an admission by the respondent of an oral agreement between the respondent and Mr Anil which was concluded in 2003 (\u201cthe 2003 Agreement\u201d). Under this agreement, the respondent allegedly agreed to hold on trust for Mr Anil the shares of various special purpose vehicles (\u201cSPVs\u201d) which would be set up by Mr Anil. 5', 'The respondent, on the other hand, denies the existence of the 2003 Agreement. His position is that the 2014 share transfer effected a sale of the Share by the respondent to Mr Anil, and therefore evidences a different oral agreement allegedly concluded in 2014 between Mr Anil and himself (\u201cthe 2014 Agreement\u201d). Under this agreement, it was allegedly agreed that the Share would be transferred to Mr Anil upon his payment of certain sums to the respondent equivalent to the amounts which the respondent had loaned to MDWL. On this account, the purpose of the 2014 Agreement was to allow Mr Anil to purchase the 22 units in Newton Imperial owned by the Subsidiaries in a manner that would be tax efficient. 6', '12\\u2003In January 2016, Mr Anil passed away. The appellant was subsequently appointed as the administratrix of his estate.', '13\\u2003In August 2015, Mr Anil commenced Suit No 821 of 2015 (\u201cSuit 821\u201d) in Singapore against the respondent.', '14\\u2003In Suit 821, Mr Anil claims that he had entered into the 2003 Agreement with the respondent following discussions in Hong Kong. It was allegedly agreed that: 7', '(a)\\u2003Mr Anil would set up SPVs to conduct various businesses and to hold assets. He would provide all the funds for the acquisition of the SPVs\u2019 businesses and assets and would be the sole beneficial owner of all the shares issued in the SPVs.', '(b)\\u2003The respondent would be a shareholder and\/or director of the SPVs and would hold the shares in the SPVs as Mr Anil\u2019s nominee on trust for him. He was to receive payment in consideration for this.', '15\\u2003In Suit 821, Mr Anil claims that consistently with what was agreed under the 2003 Agreement, he had set up and funded a number of SPVs in the BVI and in Singapore. 8', 'He then used the trading profits generated by the SPVs to make various investments and asset acquisitions, including real estate developments in Singapore. 9', 'One of the ways in which he is said to have used the trading profits was to set up Great Newton Properties Pte Ltd (\u201cGreat Newton Properties\u201d) which was the developer of Newton Imperial. 10', 'It is claimed that the respondent committed various breaches of trust, by amongst others, causing Great Newton Properties to transfer 22 units in Newton Imperial to the Subsidiaries. 11', '16\\u2003On 14 May 2014, Mr Anil\u2019s solicitors sent a letter of demand to the respondent, demanding, amongst other things, that the respondent return the 22 units in Newton Imperial by instructing Ms Pooja to transfer the Share to Mr Anil. 12', 'It is claimed that in compliance with the said letter of demand, the 2014 share transfer was executed by Ms Pooja on the instructions of the respondent. The fact that the Share was transferred for a nominal consideration of US$1 on 8 July 2014 is relied on as an admission by the respondent of the existence of the 2003 Agreement and his obligations thereunder. 13', '17\\u2003The respondent however allegedly failed to comply with the rest of Mr Anil\u2019s demands in relation to other assets allegedly held on trust pursuant to the 2003 Agreement (\u201cthe 2003 trust assets\u201d), and thus Mr Anil commenced Suit 821 against him in August 2015. 14', 'Following her appointment as the administratrix of the estate, the appellant has been substituted as the plaintiff in Suit 821, suing on behalf of the estate. The reliefs claimed by the estate in Suit 821 include the following: 15', '(a)\\u2003a declaration that the respondent holds the 2003 trust assets on trust for the estate and an order that the respondent convey the assets to the estate;', '(b)\\u2003 an account and inquiry of the 2003 trust assets and all traceable proceeds of the same;', '(c)\\u2003a transfer of all the books and records of MDWL and profits earned from the rental of the 22 units in Newton Imperial as may be found due to the estate upon the taking of the account and inquiry in (b).', '18\\u2003The respondent denies the existence of the 2003 Agreement. He claims that he was responsible for the development of Newton Imperial and not Mr Anil. He claims to have made a substantial sum of money through trading in precious gems and iron ore and that he had sought Mr Anil\u2019s counsel in relation to investments of his money. Eventually, various SPVs including Great Newton Properties were incorporated in Singapore allegedly for the purpose of investing his money in real estate in Singapore. 16', '19\\u2003As for the 2014 share transfer, the respondent stated in the first version of his defence dated 6 October 2015 that: 17', '20\\u2003Following Mr Anil\u2019s passing in 2016, a dispute arose in the Family Justice Courts between the appellant and Mr Anil\u2019s daughter, Ms Chandana Anil Salgaocar (\u201cMs Chandana\u201d), over the appointment of the administratrix of the estate.

{"casename":"2019_SGCA_43","fact":"'3\\u2003The appellant, Akfel Commodities Turkey Holding Anonim Sirketi (\u201cAkfel\u201d), is the main holding company for a group of companies known as the Akfel Group, which is in the business of trading gas and power in Turkey. The Akfel Group was owned by two Turkish brothers, Mr Mehmet Fatih Baltaci and Mr Murad Abdurrahman Baltaci (\u201cMFB\u201d and \u201cMAB\u201d respectively and hereinafter collectively called \u201cthe Baltaci Brothers\u201d) at all material times before end of 2015. The Baltaci Brothers held all the shares in Akfel, as well as all the shares in Akfel Commodities Pte Ltd (\u201cAkfel Singapore\u201d), the latter being a company incorporated in Singapore in March 2015. In December 2015, they transferred all their shares in Akfel to Akfel Singapore.', '4\\u2003Mr Adam Townsend, the respondent in this appeal and the plaintiff in the proceedings below, is a consultant who provides consultancy services to major energy companies around the world. Mr Townsend provided consultancy services to the Akfel Group on a non-exclusive basis since 2009, and was receiving monthly retainer fees, starting at approximately \u20ac8,000, which was periodically increased to \u20ac35,000 just before the commencement of the Consultancy Agreement (see [5] below). He was also paid bonuses and reimbursed for his expenses. There was no written agreement between the Akfel Group and Mr Townsend for his services until the execution of the Consultancy Agreement in 2016.', '5\\u2003Mr Townsend\u2019s case was that, on or about 14 March 2016, another oral agreement was reached between MFB and him where on account of his enhanced involvement in the management of the Akfel Group, his monthly retainer fee would be increased. At the time, MFB was the Chairman, a director and the majority shareholder of Akfel Singapore, which fully owned Akfel. The oral agreement was later incorporated into a written Consultancy Agreement which was executed between Mr Townsend and Akfel. By a Deed of Guarantee, Akfel Singapore guaranteed Akfel\u2019s performance of the Consultancy Agreement. The Consultancy Agreement contained, inter alia, the following terms:', '(a)\\u2003cll 3 and 4.1: Mr Townsend undertook to (i) comply with all reasonable and lawful instructions issued by Akfel, (ii) advise Akfel and its subsidiaries, (iii) endeavour to promote the interests of Akfel and the Akfel Group, (iv) work at least 25 hours a week in carrying out consulting services and representing Akfel, (v) serve as a director for Akfel and its subsidiaries, and (vi) make himself available when reasonably required by Akfel;', '(b)\\u2003cll 5.1 and 5.2: Akfel was to pay Mr Townsend \u20ac45,000 per month on a quarterly basis, within 14 days of receipt of Mr Townsend\u2019s invoices, and reimburse his reasonable expenses;', '(c)\\u2003cl 4.2: Akfel was to do everything necessary to enable Mr Townsend to fulfil the aims of the Consultancy Agreement, including providing full and unmitigated access to Mr Townsend to the offices of Akfel and its subsidiaries and to the employees of the Akfel Group;', '(d)\\u2003cll 1.3 and 2.1: the Consultancy Agreement was to commence on 1 August 2016 and run for five years unless terminated as provided for by the terms of the agreement or by Akfel giving at least 24 months\u2019 written notice or by Mr Townsend giving at least 12 months\u2019 notice;', '(e)\\u2003cll 1.12 and 9.4: if Akfel terminated the Consultancy Agreement for any reasons other than those falling within cll 2.1, 9.2(a), 9.2(b) and 9.2(c) (ie, where it was terminated without cause), Akfel was to pay Mr Townsend liquidated damages equal to 24 months of his retainer (ie, \u20ac1,080,000); and', '(f)\\u2003cl 16: Singapore was the governing law and exclusive jurisdiction was conferred on the Singapore courts.', '6\\u2003Mr Townsend claimed that Akfel had breached the Consultancy Agreement by terminating it on 16 March 2017. Akfel\u2019s primary defence was that the Consultancy Agreement was a sham contract \u2013 it was intended to operate as a device through which Mr Townsend would be compensated for agreeing to act as an intermediary of the Baltaci Brothers in furtherance of a scheme whereby the Baltaci Brothers would attempt to retain and exercise control over the affairs of Akfel and the Akfel Group whilst at the same time concealing their involvement in the said scheme. Further, Akfel averred that the Consultancy Agreement was concluded in furtherance of an illegal venture, designed to avoid or circumvent the consequences under Turkish law in respect of the Baltaci Brothers\u2019 suspected involvement with the Gulenist Terror Organisation\/Parallel State Structure (\u201cFETO\/PDY\u201d) and\/or the failed coup in Turkey that took place in July 2016. Akfel averred that the Consultancy Agreement was not enforceable, as enforcing it would be tantamount to sanctioning a contravention of two Turkish court orders. To understand Akfel\u2019s position, we will briefly set out the chronology of events that took place in Turkey during the material time and explain how the two Turkish court orders came into being.', '7\\u2003Sometime in 2014, Turkish authorities commenced large-scale investigations into the affairs of FETO\/PDY, including companies and organisations suspected to have provided financing to FETO\/PDY and persons suspected to be connected with FETO\/PDY. On 15 July 2016, FETO\/PDY launched a coup against the Turkish government, which failed. In response, the Istanbul Chief Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office commenced investigations to identify persons who financed FETO\/PDY in the coup attempt. The Istanbul Chief Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office applied for and obtained an injunction from the Istanbul courts on 18 August 2016 (\u201cthe August 2016 Injunction\u201d) for the confiscation of assets owned by various persons, including those of the Baltaci Brothers.', '8\\u2003 Against this backdrop of political turmoil in Turkey in 2016 and 2017, various changes were effected in Akfel. Starting from 28 March 2016, the Baltaci Brothers resigned from the Akfel board and Mr Townsend joined the board. From March 2016 to August 2016, the Baltaci Brothers transferred most, if not all, of their shares in Akfel Singapore to companies in which Mr Townsend was involved. As mentioned, the commencement date of the Consultancy Agreement was stated to be 1 August 2016.', '9\\u2003Four months later, on 1 December 2016, due to findings on Akfel\u2019s connection with the armed terrorist organisation of FETO\/PDY and its financial support of the organisation, the Istanbul courts accepted the Istanbul Chief Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office\u2019s request for the Savings Deposit Insurance Fund (SDIF) or Tasarruf Mevduati Sigorta Fonu (\u201cTMSF\u201d), an entity controlled by the Turkish state, to be appointed as trustee for Akfel (\u201cthe December 2016 Order\u201d). TMSF therefore took control of Akfel. TMSF asked Mr Townsend to continue his work at Akfel soon after it took over the company, but it also thwarted his work by taking measures such as blocking external consultants from communicating with him. A few days later, on 17 December 2016, Mr Townsend issued Akfel an invoice for his retainer fees for the preceding quarter which Akfel failed to pay. On 16 March 2017, TMSF\u2019s lawyers sent Mr Townsend a termination letter, claiming that the Consultancy Agreement was \u201ccollusive and legally invalid\u201d:', '10\\u2003Subsequently, in mid-2017, MAB was identified in a Turkish indictment as a suspect who had financed the FETO\/PDY. According to Mr Townsend, MAB\u2019s detention was brought to an end by the Istanbul courts after hearings were carried out in December 2017. As for MFB, Akfel took the position that investigations against MFB were still ongoing as of January 2018 because he had yet to be arrested, while Mr Townsend gave evidence that MFB was not a fugitive as his address was officially registered with the Turkish courts.', '11\\u2003After Mr Townsend\u2019s services were unilaterally terminated by TMSF in March 2017 (see [9] above), he commenced Suit No 329 of 2017 against Akfel on 13 April 2017 claiming liquidated damages or alternatively damages for breach of the notice period, his retainer fees for the months of September 2016 to March 2017 (less part payment), and reimbursements of reasonable expenses. Assistant Registrar Cheng Pei Feng (\u201cAR Cheng\u201d) granted Mr Townsend\u2019s application for summary judgment at first instance. Akfel\u2019s appeal was heard by Judicial Commissioner Pang Khang Chau (\u201cthe Judge\u201d), who granted Akfel leave to defend on condition that it furnished security of $2m within six weeks (\u201cthe Condition\u201d). Being dissatisfied with the Condition imposed by the Judge, Akfel appealed to this court against that part of the decision, seeking a revocation of the Condition.'"}
{"casename":"2019_SGCA_44","fact":"'3\\u2003We begin by setting out the undisputed facts relating to the events of that fateful day.', '4\\u2003In the early hours of 14 January 2014, the appellant returned to his lodging house after gambling at a casino. He took some sleeping tablets and went to sleep. When he awoke at about 11.00am, he discovered that a sum of around $6000, which he had kept in his pockets when he went to bed, was missing. The appellant\u2019s suspicions turned to the victim, who was working for him as a pimp and who, he recalled, had been the last to leave the lodging house the night before. The appellant called the victim and asked him to come to the lodging house.', '5\\u2003When the victim arrived at the lodging house, he was confronted by the appellant but denied taking the money. This infuriated the appellant, who slapped the victim, and this in turn led to a fight that started in the living room and ended in one of the bedrooms (\u201cBedroom 1\u201d). At some point during the fight, the appellant took hold of a 40cm-long metal dumbbell rod weighing 1.46kg, with which he hit the victim several times on his head and body. About 15 minutes after the fight had started, the victim was left bleeding on the bed in Bedroom 1.', '6\\u2003The appellant then called another member of his staff, Chua Thiam Hock (\u201cChua\u201d), and asked him to come to the lodging house. When he arrived, Chua was similarly accused of stealing the appellant\u2019s money and on denying it, he was attacked with the rod, which fractured his hands. The appellant ordered Chua to go into Bedroom 1 and see for himself what the consequences would be of stealing from him. In Chua\u2019s presence, the appellant then hit the victim with the rod again, save that he did not hit his head. Each time he was hit, the victim would groan faintly. The appellant then confined the victim and Chua in Bedroom 1 by securing the door with some rope.', '7\\u2003The appellant was in the living room when he received a call from Aw Teck Huat (\u201cAw\u201d); a member of the Sio Gi Ho secret society of which both the appellant and the victim were members.

The appellant told Gan that he had beaten the victim severely for stealing his money, and showed Gan the rod he had used to attack the victim. The appellant then removed the rope securing the door to Bedroom 1 and opened the door. Upon seeing the victim\u2019s condition, Gan called another of the appellant\u2019s staff members, Tan Keok Ling (\u201cTan\u201d), and asked him to come to the lodging house.', '9\\u2003Tan arrived at the lodging house at about 3.40pm. The appellant showed Tan the rod he had used on the victim, told Tan that he had beaten the victim for stealing his money, and asked Tan to look at him in Bedroom 1. Tan observed that the victim was unresponsive and breathing heavily.', '10\\u2003The appellant then instructed Chua to fetch a pail of water to clean the blood off the victim\u2019s body. Chua, however, was unable to do so because of his fractured hands. The appellant then took a pail of water and splashed it on the victim, shouting vulgarities and accusing the victim of pretending to be dead.', '11\\u2003When Tan admonished the appellant for hurting the victim so badly, the appellant was unremorseful and threatened to hit him again when he regained consciousness. Fearing that the appellant would carry out his threat, Tan called Aw hoping that he might prevail upon the appellant not to do so. Tan also told the appellant that an ambulance should be called given the seriousness of the victim\u2019s injuries but the appellant refused and threatened to beat up Tan if he were to do so. The appellant also instructed Gan to dispose of the rod.', '12\\u2003At about 5pm, Koh Tzer Jiiun (\u201cKoh\u201d), another member of the Sio Gi Ho secret society, who had been called by Aw arrived at the lodging house. He checked on the victim and found him unresponsive and breathing heavily. Koh informed Aw of this and also told him that the victim was in a terrible state such that an ambulance should be called. Aw then called his friend Tan Teng Huat (\u201cT H Tan\u201d) and asked him to bring the victim to the hospital.', '13\\u2003When T H Tan arrived at the lodging house, the appellant refused to allow him to bring the victim to the hospital. The appellant told T H Tan that he had beaten the victim for stealing his money, and offered to let T H Tan see him. T H Tan declined and instead called a private ambulance service. When he learnt that a private ambulance was on its way, the appellant instructed Chua and Tan to carry the victim to the front porch of the lodging house to await the private ambulance.', '14\\u2003When the paramedic in charge of the ambulance saw the victim, she refused to convey him to the hospital because his injuries were too serious. She instead called for a Singapore Civil Defence Force ambulance, which arrived at 6.34pm, followed shortly thereafter by the police at 6.42pm. When questioned by the police, the appellant claimed that he had found the victim by the roadside and had then called for the ambulance. The appellant also told the police that he brought the victim to his front porch because he was concerned that he might be run over by vehicles had he been left by the roadside.', '15\\u2003On arrival at the hospital, the victim was found to be in a coma, bleeding from his head, and with skull fractures. He passed away seven days later on 21 January 2014. The cause of his death was recorded as bronchopneumonia following multiple fractures of the skull.', '16\\u2003In the meantime, the appellant had surrendered himself to the police on 16 January 2014. On the following day, he was charged under s 326 of the PC for voluntarily causing grievous hurt with a dangerous weapon. When the victim passed away, the charge was amended to one under s 302 of the PC for murder.'"}
{"casename":"2019_SGCA_45","fact":"'3\\u2003The parties were married in May 2003 and their marriage lasted 12.5 years. The Husband was 40 years old, the Wife was 38 years old, and the three children of the marriage were 12 years old, 5 years old and 4 years old as at March 2017. The Wife filed for divorce in November 2015 based on the Husband\u2019s unreasonable behaviour. The Husband initially contested the divorce and filed a counterclaim based on the Wife\u2019s unreasonable behaviour. However, the divorce subsequently became uncontested as the Husband withdrew his counterclaim. The parties agreed that they were to have joint custody of the three children with care and control to the Wife. Interim judgment was granted on 27 January 2016.', '4\\u2003The parties, however, disputed the division of matrimonial assets and maintenance in the Family Court. Dissatisfied with the decision of the District Judge, the Husband appealed to the High Court whose appeal was substantially dismissed leading to the present appeal by the Husband. The Husband raised a multitude of issues in relation to the division of matrimonial assets including, in particular, shares that were gifted by his father to him on two separate occasions.', '5\\u2003The Husband worked in his family business, a supermarket chain (\u201cthe Supermarket\u201d), at the time of the proceedings in the Family Court. He holds 8% of the shares in the Supermarket, his father owns 85%, his mother owns 5% while his sister owns the balance 2%. The Husband also has interests in other businesses.', '6\\u2003The Wife previously worked as a senior bank officer before she resigned in February 2004, shortly after their marriage. Whether she then worked for the Supermarket and\/or the Husband\u2019s other businesses was a matter of dispute between the parties. According to her, she worked until the birth of their third child in November 2012. 1', 'In this regard, it was not disputed that she remained on the payroll of the Supermarket until November 2015. The Husband\u2019s case was that she did not actually work for the Supermarket at all and the monies that she received as salary were given by his father to her as part of the arrangement he had in place for all his daughters-in-law, and the monies were actually part of the Husband\u2019s salary. This dispute over the Wife\u2019s actual employment status thus had an impact on two key issues in the appeal: (a) whether the Husband\u2019s 80,000 shares in the Supermarket which were gifted to him by his father should be included in the matrimonial pool for division pursuant to s 112(10) of the Women\u2019s Charter; (b) which in turn would have a bearing on the parties\u2019 direct financial contribution.', '7\\u2003It was not disputed that the Husband\u2019s father gave him 20,000 shares in the Supermarket before the marriage in 1999 and 60,000 shares during the marriage in November 2012. The Husband\u2019s argument that these shares should not be considered matrimonial assets was rejected by the District Judge who found that the 80,000 shares received by the Husband from his father belonged to the matrimonial pool of assets because the Wife had played a fairly important role in the day-to-day administrative running of the Supermarket and had thus substantially improved the shares. The salary and CPF contributions received by the Wife from the Supermarket were hence correctly attributed to her, for there was no evidence supporting the Husband\u2019s claim that they were in fact part of his salary.', '8\\u2003On appeal, the High Court Judge below agreed with the District Judge that the Wife had substantively worked for the Supermarket until November 2012, and that the 20,000 shares gifted to the Husband before the marriage should be included in the matrimonial pool because they had been substantially improved by the Wife, based on s 112(10) of the Women\u2019s Charter. As for the 60,000 shares gifted to the Husband in November 2012, the Judge held that they should be viewed as a form of remuneration or reward for the Husband\u2019s prior work in the Supermarket, and not as a gift per se. They were transferred to the Husband during the marriage, so they were included as matrimonial assets by the Judge. 2', '9\\u2003We saw no reason to disturb the findings in the courts below that the Wife had worked in the Supermarket and played a fairly important role in the day-to-day administrative running of the Supermarket. However, on the question whether the 80,000 shares should be classified as matrimonial assets, it suffices to say that different treatment of the 20,000 Supermarket shares and the 60,000 Supermarket shares was warranted because they were given to the Husband at two different times: the 20,000 shares were given before the Wife started working for the Supermarket whereas the 60,000 shares were only given at about the same time the Wife stopped working for the Supermarket.', '10\\u2003As a corollary of her finding that the Wife had worked substantively for the Supermarket until November 2012, the Judge included the 20,000 shares acquired by the Husband pre-marriage in the matrimonial pool pursuant to s 112(10) of the Women\u2019s Charter. 3', 'We agreed with this decision, given that the 20,000 shares were substantially improved by the Wife during the marriage, and there was a direct causal connection between her work in the Supermarket and the improvement of the shares. We accepted that the Wife started to learn about the accounting practices of the family business in end 2003 when the business only consisted of a convenience store. When the Husband\u2019s father opened the main branch of the Supermarket in early 2004, she started contributing to the business operations in both the convenience store and the main branch. By then, the family business operations had expanded. The 20,000 shares in the Supermarket were given to the Husband at about the same time of incorporation in 1999, and the par value of each share at incorporation was $1.00. By end 2012, the net tangible asset value of each share was $3.63, based on the evidence from the Husband\u2019s expert. Significantly, at the material time of the Wife\u2019s contributions to the Supermarket, this lot of 20,000 shares were already owned by the Husband. In that sense, it was correct to find that the Wife\u2019s contributions had substantially improved an asset belonging to the Husband which was acquired by way of a gift.', '11\\u2003The Husband, on appeal, argued that the Judge mischaracterised the 60,000 Supermarket shares as part of the Husband\u2019s remuneration because the Wife never disputed that they were a gift to the Husband from his father. The Wife did not challenge the characterisation of the 60,000 shares as a gift in the appeal, despite counsel\u2019s unclear submission that the 60,000 shares were \u201cnot, strictly, third party gifts\u201d because they \u201cwere not \u2018untouched\u2019 by the Wife\u2019s contributions\u201d and thus had a connection to the non-recipient spouse. 4', 'We agreed with the Husband that the 60,000 shares were a gift from his father to him, and this evidence was not challenged by the Wife in the proceedings below. This then raised the question as to whether they were matrimonial assets pursuant to s 112(10) of the Women\u2019s Charter. The section states:', '12\\u2003Of significance is the fact that the Wife had stopped working for the Supermarket at about the same time the 60,000 shares were gifted to the Husband. As a result, any contribution made by the Wife in relation to this lot of 60,000 shares was undoubtedly past contribution vis-\u00e0-vis the receipt of the shares by the Husband, and the question was whether past contribution to an asset can be considered for the purposes of fulfilling s 112(10) when that asset was not owned by the Husband at the material time.', '13\\u2003Section 112(10) of the Women\u2019s Charter states that matrimonial assets do \u201cnot include any asset (not being a matrimonial home) that has been acquired by one party at any time by gift or inheritance and that has not been substantially improved during the marriage by the other party or by both parties to the marriage\u201d. The default position for gifts (not being matrimonial homes) is that they are not to be included in the matrimonial pool of assets unless the gifts were substantially improved by the other spouse during the marriage or by both parties to the marriage. There is, however, no stipulation that the substantial improvement must occur after the asset is gifted. Thus, a literal reading of this subsection might not necessarily preclude consideration of the Wife\u2019s substantial improvement prior to the Husband acquiring the gift, as long as the improvement was performed \u201cduring the marriage\u201d. On this reading, since the Wife had worked for the Supermarket during the marriage and improved the Supermarket\u2019s shares substantially during the marriage, they would be matrimonial assets. This reading appears to be in line with Professor Leong Wai Kum\u2019s view that a spouse who received a gift or inheritance should be prepared to share the windfall, for that is what marriage is \u2013 that spouses share their good fortune and console one another should ill fortune strike (Leong Wai Kum, Elements of Family Law in Singapore (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2018) at para 16.229). It could simply be fortuitous that the 60,000 Supermarket shares to the Husband were only given after the Wife stopped working in the Supermarket \u2013 the timing of the gift might be a matter of luck and chance, and the Husband should be prepared to share it.', '14\\u2003However, this view does not pay sufficient attention to the plain wording of the proviso to the subsection and its underlying rationale. The issue is not simply whether a spouse who has received a gift during the marriage should share it with the other spouse. If that was the intention behind the proviso, there would be no requirement to examine whether the contributions of the non-recipient spouse have improved the value of the gift. Further, the focus of the proviso is clearly directed at the non-recipient spouse and the extent to which the contributions have improved the value of the gift. In Chen Siew Hwee v Low Kee Guan (Wong Yong Yee, co-respondent) [2006] 4 SLR(R) 605 (\u201cChen Siew Hwee\u201d), Andrew Phang Boon Leong J (as he then was) explained that the rationale underlying the qualifying words in s 112(10) (as produced in the previous paragraph) \u201ccentres on the recognition of the donor\u2019s intention as well as the concomitant need to prevent unwarranted windfalls accruing to the other party to the marriage\u201d (at [32]). On the donor\u2019s intention, the starting point is, as explained by Phang J, \u201cif I give a gift to someone, I do not, ex hypothesi, intend his or her spouse to have a share in it\u201d. The inference of such an intention is even stronger where the donor, despite knowing that the other spouse had contributed to the asset, still specifically decided to give it only to the recipient spouse. This applies to the facts of the present case \u2013 there is a strong indication that the father did not intend the Wife to have a share in the gift of the 60,000 shares.', '15\\u2003After setting out the starting point, Phang J then explained that the qualifying words provide circumstances under which a party to the marriage ought to have a share in the gift out of \u201cfairness\u201d. One exception to the rule that gifts are not matrimonial assets is where the gift has been substantially improved by the other spouse. Because the other spouse contributed to the substantial enhancement of the asset concerned, it is \u201cat least arguably just and fair for that party to have a share in it even if the original intention of the donor of the asset was not to benefit that party\u201d (at [34]). This aspect of fairness is linked to the second rationale: the need to prevent unwarranted windfalls. Where the other party has contributed to improving the gift, there is less of a windfall falling on that party. However, in the case of a donor giving a gift only to one spouse despite knowing that the other spouse has contributed to it, this aspect of fairness has to be considered with the stronger inference of the donor\u2019s intention not to benefit the other spouse in mind.', '16\\u2003Another consideration is that the contribution of the other spouse to the asset in question was with the knowledge that the asset belonged to a third party without any expectation of either party to the marriage acquiring it, ie, the other spouse treated the asset as a third party\u2019s while contributing to it. Seen in this way, the gift, if included in the matrimonial pool, would be an unwarranted windfall because the contributions of the other spouse would by then be a fait accompli.', '17\\u2003Phang J\u2019s explanation for the inclusion of a gift where both spouses contributed to it further supports the view that the improvement of the gift must come after the gift is acquired. Phang J expounded that there is a strong reason for such inclusion \u201cbecause both parties were, by virtue of their collaborative and combined contribution, actually demonstrating that they both regarded the asset concerned as being part of the communal (here, matrimonial) pool of assets\u201d (at [35]). This treatment or attitude of the spouses towards the asset is given paramount weight. As explained earlier, where the contributions to the asset were made before it was acquired by a party to the marriage, the treatment and attitude towards the asset when the contributions were effected would be different: they would have been effected with the knowledge that such contribution would improve a third party\u2019s asset.', '18\\u2003Thus, taking a purposive reading of s 112(10) of the Women\u2019s Charter by considering the rationale underpinning the rule for including gifts as matrimonial assets only in certain circumstances, substantive improvement by the other party to the asset before it was gifted to the recipient spouse should not be taken into account for the purposes of s 112(10). Given that the Wife\u2019s contributions only substantially improved the 60,000 shares before they were gifted to the Husband, we found that the shares were not matrimonial assets.'"}

Two shareholders of IHC, Mr Fan Kow Hin (\u201cMr Fan\u201d) and Mr Andrew Aathar (\u201cMr Aathar\u201d), were involved in the negotiations leading up to the Transaction. Both of them were substantial shareholders in IHC, and at the traded share price of $0.31 per share in August 2015, their collective shareholdings in IHC were worth more than $166m.

The matters discussed in that call were summarised in an email sent by Mr Aathar to Mr Tan the next day. Mr Aathar, ostensibly writing on behalf of IHC, stated that IHC had noticed an unusual sale pattern of its shares on Thursday 2 April 2015. The sale pattern had been analysed with an industry specialist, and the view was taken that there was a \u201chigh probability\u201d that there was a \u201cstealth plot\u201d that would lead to an \u201cimminent shorting of IHC shares\u201d. To defend IHC against the short-selling attack, Mr Aathar asked that the Crest entities \u201cprovide a standby line of $20m for use against this activity\u201d. Significantly, one of the terms Mr Aathar proposed was that to defend IHC\u2019s share price, \u201c[IHC] [s]hares [could] be bought and held by [the Crest entities] directly\u201d. This email was copied to Mr Fan.', '13\\u2003The Crest entities were amenable to this. In his affidavit dated 10 May 2016 filed in a different matter but which was in evidence before us (the \u201c10 May 2016 affidavit\u201d), Mr Tan attested that Crest Capital, having regard to \u201cthe longstanding relationship and [IHC\u2019s] ability and willingness to provide the required collateral, \u2026 agreed to provide a standby facility for general uses [sic] by [IHC] at standard financing terms which included assets collateralisation \u2026 and personal guarantees from [Mr Fan] and [Mr Aathar]\u201d.', '14\\u2003On 6 April 2015, Crest Capital circulated a term sheet (the \u201cTerm Sheet\u201d) to IHC as well as Mr Fan and Mr Aathar in their capacity as guarantors.

Mr Tan noted in his 10 May 2016 affidavit that \u201cone of the proposed securit[ies] for the loan was a \u2018pledge of IHC shares purchased through Fund\u2019\u201d [emphasis in original omitted].', '15\\u2003On 16 April 2015, IHC, Mr Fan and Mr Aathar entered into a standby facility agreement with EFIII (the first appellant), Value Monetization III Ltd (the third appellant) and one other Crest entity (namely, the Enterprise Fund II Ltd (\u201cEFII\u201d)), by which IHC was granted a facility in the principal amount of $20m. This agreement was superseded by another standby facility agreement on 30 July 2015 for reasons which are not relevant to this appeal. It is only pertinent to note that the second appellant, VMF3 Ltd, replaced EFII as a party to the agreement, with the result that the parties to the agreement were now the Crest Funds, IHC, Mr Fan and Mr Aathar.

{"casename":"2019_SGCA_50","fact":"'3\\u2003The first respondent, China Medical Technologies, Inc (\u201cCMT\u201d), was incorporated in the Cayman Islands. Its wholly-owned subsidiary, CMED Technologies Ltd (\u201cCMED\u201d), the second respondent, was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. CMT\u2019s principal business was developing, manufacturing and marketing advanced surgical and medical equipment in China. This business was short-lived as CMT was wound up on 27 July 2012.', '4\\u2003Mr Wu Xiaodong (\u201cMr Wu\u201d) founded CMT and ran it until it was wound up. He was the largest shareholder of CMT, holding 23% of its issued share capital through a company called Chengxuan International Ltd.', '5\\u2003The appellant is Ms Bi Xiaoqiong (\u201cMs Bi\u201d or \u201cthe appellant\u201d). She is a Singapore citizen. Ms Bi and Mr Wu were married in 1995. They were divorced in 2012 but Ms Bi claims that they separated in 2001 and lived apart thereafter.', '6\\u2003After investigating the affairs of CMT and CMED, the liquidators of CMT (\u201cthe Liquidators\u201d) took the view that as much as US$521.8m had been fraudulently misappropriated from the respondents by members of their former management. The respondents therefore started a series of legal proceedings against these persons in both Hong Kong and Singapore. The present action, in which Mr Wu and Ms Bi are the defendants, is one such proceeding.', '7\\u2003In brief, the background of the alleged fraud is as follows. Between 2005 and 2010, CMT raised capital of approximately US$631m, and had US$515m of that capital at its disposal. Between February 2007 and October 2008, the respondents entered into two transactions for the acquisition of medical technology from Supreme Well Investments Limited (\u201cSW\u201d) for a total consideration of US$521.8m (\u201cthe Transactions\u201d). Allegations were made subsequently that CMT\u2019s management had acted fraudulently in respect of the Transactions.', '8\\u2003Their investigations led the Liquidators to the view that Mr Wu and other members of the respondents\u2019 management had procured the conclusion of the Transactions by withholding from CMT\u2019s full board of directors: (a) details of their personal interests in the Transactions; (b) the fact that the chief financial officer of CMT at the time was also the sole authorised signatory of SW\u2019s bank accounts; and (c) the fact that the medical technology sought to be acquired in the Transactions was worthless.', '9\\u2003In particular, the Liquidators discovered that the respondents had acquired only patent applications through the Transactions, and that none of the technology acquired had the necessary regulatory approval for sale and use in China at the time. The Liquidators were also advised by experts that the technology acquired was of little value because: (a) the technology acquired in the first transaction had already been in existence for almost 30 years; and (b) the technology acquired in the second transaction did not have any clinical application, and was \u201cinherently unsuited to use in clinical diagnosis\u201d.', '10\\u2003In the circumstances, in the various lawsuits the respondents alleged that the Transactions were used as a means of \u201cstealing US$521.8 million of purported purchase consideration, paid through a series of banking transactions involving Hong Kong bank accounts\u201d controlled by CMT\u2019s former management. Of the total of US$521.8m, between 2006 and as late as 2011:', '(a)\\u2003US$355.5m was paid by the respondents via cashier orders to SW\u2019s bank accounts. The funds were later transferred from SW\u2019s bank accounts to bank accounts of various other persons and entities (\u201cthe SW Payees\u201d), all of whom were associated with or controlled by the former management of CMT. The payment out of SW\u2019s bank accounts to the SW Payees took place, in many instances, within days of SW receiving the funds. From the SW Payees, the funds were then transferred to other persons and entities (\u201cthe Further SW Payees\u201d), a number of whom were associated with or controlled by the former management of CMT. The Further SW Payees include Mr Wu and Ms Bi. From the Further SW Payees, the funds were often further transferred to other recipients.', '(b)\\u2003The balance of US$166.3m was paid to SW through other means, such as bank transfers and cheques.', '11\\u2003Mr Wu was subsequently indicted on criminal charges relating to the alleged fraud in the United States of America (\u201cthe US\u201d). Ms Bi denied being in any way complicit in the alleged fraud. She claimed that she had no involvement in CMT and its affiliates, except in respect of a Singapore subsidiary, CMT Diagnostics (Singapore) Pte Ltd. She also denied having any knowledge of the alleged breaches of fiduciary duty or trust by the perpetrators of the fraud, or that the moneys received in her bank accounts were the proceeds of the alleged fraud.', '12\\u2003On 1 August 2013, CMT commenced proceedings in Hong Kong by way of High Court Action No 1417 of 2013 (\u201cthe first HK Suit\u201d) against Mr Wu and four others, claiming, inter alia, breach of fiduciary duties, breach of trust, conspiracy, money had and received, and knowing receipt, in respect of four specific payments made from CMT to SW. On 23 December 2016, the respondents commenced another set of proceedings in Hong Kong by way of High Court Action 3391 of 2016 (\u201cthe second HK Suit\u201d) against Mr Wu, Ms Bi and 21 other defendants. The second HK Suit was for causes of action that were similar to those pursued in the first HK Suit, but were in respect of a broader class of payments, namely, any or all payments made between November 2006 and December 2009 by the respondents and their subsidiaries to SW, its subsidiaries and\/or its nominees. Ms Bi was served with the writ for the second HK Suit through her solicitors in Singapore.', '13\\u2003On 11 December 2017, the Hong Kong High Court, pursuant to an application made in the second HK Suit, granted the respondents a worldwide Mareva injunction against, among others, Mr Wu and Ms Bi (\u201cthe HK Injunction\u201d). The HK Injunction restrained Ms Bi from removing from Hong Kong any of her assets up to a total value of at least US$17.6m. It also provided that she was not to dispose of or deal with any of her assets, whether within or outside Hong Kong, unless she had assets with a total value of at least US$17.6m. The terms of the HK Injunction specifically identified, inter alia, property and bank accounts in Singapore.', '14\\u2003On 13 December 2017, the respondents commenced this action, Suit No 1180 of 2017 (\u201cSuit 1180\u201d), in the High Court of Singapore. At the same time, they applied by way of Summons No 5689 of 2017 (\u201cSUM 5689\u201d) for Mareva injunctions against Mr Wu and the appellant. The endorsement of claim in the writ of summons for Suit 1180 set out substantially the same claims and causes of action as those pursued in the second HK Suit. The Mareva injunctions sought by way of SUM 5689 were to prevent the defendants from disposing of their assets in Singapore only (ie, the respondents did not seek worldwide Mareva injunctions). In respect of the appellant, the precise order sought was to prevent her from removing her assets from Singapore or dealing with them within the country so long as the total value of her assets in Singapore was below US$17.6m. In particular, the order sought to restrain the disposal of the following assets belonging to the appellant:', '(a)\\u2003a property at 17 Coral Island Singapore which she holds jointly with Mr Wu (\u201cthe Coral Island Property\u201d);', '(b)\\u2003moneys in an account with United Overseas Bank (\u201cUOB\u201d), held jointly with Mr Wu;', '(c)\\u2003moneys in two other UOB accounts and one account with Standard Chartered Bank, held in her own name;', '(d)\\u2003moneys in a UOB account in the name of WB International Holding Pte Ltd (\u201cWB International\u201d); and', '(e)\\u2003moneys in an account with Credit Suisse AG, Singapore Branch (\u201cCredit Suisse Singapore\u201d), in the name of Long Chart Investments Limited (\u201cLong Chart\u201d).', '15\\u2003Long Chart and WB International are alleged to be two of the Further SW Payees (see above at [10(a)]), and are defendants in the second HK Suit. The respondents claimed that the appellant controlled Long Chart and WB International for the purposes of perpetrating and concealing the fraud, and\/or laundering its proceeds for her benefit. Long Chart is a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. It is alleged to have received at least US$3m of the stolen funds. WB International is a company incorporated in Singapore. It is alleged to have received at least US$0.5m of the stolen funds. The appellant is alleged to be the sole director and shareholder of both Long Chart and WB International. At the hearing below, the appellant\u2019s counsel accepted that the moneys in both entities \u201cbelong to [the appellant], as there is no other person who has an interest in [the] two companies\u201d.', '16\\u2003The writ of summons for Suit 1180 and the papers for SUM 5689 were served on the appellant on 18 December 2017 and shortly thereafter she entered appearance to the action. The appellant thus accepted the in personam jurisdiction of the court and, in fact, has not thereafter sought to challenge it.', '17\\u2003On 4 January 2018, the High Court granted the respondents\u2019 application for a Mareva injunction against Mr Wu in SUM 5689 on an ex parte basis. Mr Wu was unrepresented at that hearing but counsel for the appellant appeared and requested an inter partes hearing in so far as the appellant was concerned. The court agreed and adjourned the hearing of SUM 5689 in respect of the appellant.', '18\\u2003On 20 February 2018, the respondents applied by way of Summons No 878 of 2018 (\u201cSUM 878\u201d) to stay Suit 1180, save for the proceedings in SUM 5689, pending the final determination of the first and second HK Suits. The respondents made clear that they intended to pursue the proceedings in Hong Kong because they considered Hong Kong to be \u201cthe most appropriate forum for the dispute\u201d. The respondents sought a stay of the Singapore proceedings so as to \u201cavoid duplicative proceedings\u201d.'"}
{"casename":"2019_SGCA_51","fact":"facts, there was \nno causal link between the breach of sub-cl (a) by the first defendant, Menrva \nSolutions Pte Ltd (\u201cMenrva Solutions\u201d), and the losses sustained by SE Power \non the contracts for differences (\u201cCFDs\u201d). The Appellants argued that it was \nnever put to Dr Peloso that he would have disregarded the daily valuations had \nthey been produced. We find, however, that there was no breach of procedural \nfairness on the facts because Dr Peloso was not deprived of the opportunity to \nput forward his case on the matter. First, a part of the cross-examination of \nDr Peloso focused on his failure to ask Menrva Solutions for the daily valuations \nand on whether the daily valuations were important for SE\u2019s purposes, and he \nhad responded to these questions, claiming that the daily valuations were \nimportant. Second, Dr Peloso also testified on matters relating to whether he \nwould have taken heed of the daily valuations: he admitted that he did not read \nmost of the SGX market updates SE Power received despite the fact that he \nknew these updates would give him information as to how the market was \nperforming, and that he did not always read the Reports produced by Tong Teik \nPte Ltd containing data on the performance of the CFDs. We are not persuaded \nthat we should interfere with the Judge\u2019s finding that it was more likely than not \nthat Dr Peloso would not have read and acted on Menrva Solutions\u2019 daily \nindicative valuations even if Menrva Solutions had produced them.\n4 In so far as the issue of privity is concerned, in particular that relating to \nthe fact that SE Power was not a party to the Consulting Agreement and that \nrelating to the question whether the losses it sustained could be claimed by SE \nunder the Consulting Agreement, we agree with the Appellants that the Judge \nshould have given parties the opportunity to address the issue. It is not definitely \nthe case that SE could never claim for the amount of losses sustained by \nSE Power if it was not a party to the Consulting Agreement. The Appellants \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nSun Electric Pte Ltd v Menrva Solutions Pte Ltd[2019] SGCA 51\n3argued that on a construction of the Consulting Agreement, SE Power\u2019s losses \nare to be treated as part of SE\u2019s losses. In the alternative, they argued that the \nexception to the general rule that a plaintiff can only recover nominal damages \nfor a breach of contract where it has suffered no loss, referred to in the case law \nas the \u201cbroad ground\u201d, applies. The \u201cbroad ground\u201d, as approved by this court \nin the cases of Chia Kok Leong v Prosperland Pte Ltd [2005] 2 SLR(R) 484 and \nFamily Food Court (a firm) v Seah Boon Lock and another (trading as Boon \nLock Duck and Noodle House) [2008] 4 SLR(R) 272 (\u201cFamily Food Court\u201d), \npermits the plaintiff to recover substantial damages for its own benefit on the \nbasis that it is recovering for its own loss. As we have explained in Family Food \nCourt (at [48]), it may be a misnomer to describe the \u201cbroad ground\u201d as an \nexception because it is based on the basic rationale of contract law centring on \nthe performance (or expectation) interest. If successful on this ground, SE can \nclaim for its own loss of performance interest caused by the non-performance \nof the Consulting Agreement by Menrva Solutions, because SE did not receive \nthe bargain for which it had contracted. The bargain it had contracted was for \nMenrva Solutions to provide its consultation services to SE Power for the \nbenefit of SE Power. The quantum of this loss of performance interest is \nreflected by the amount of losses sustained by SE Power caused by Menrva \nSolutions\u2019 breach.

SUM 58 was subsequently amended, pursuant to leave granted by this court, to include a prayer that CA 109\/2018 be struck out for being an abuse of the court\u2019s process because the appellant was in contumelious breach of the Mareva injunction mentioned at [3] above.', '6\\u2003The alleged contumelious breaches of the Mareva injunction involved the appellant\u2019s disposal of its key assets, coupled with its continued failure to account for those disposals and to restore those assets or their equivalent in value to its asset pool. The respondent argued that the appellant was also not forthcoming with the disclosure of its assets pursuant to the Mareva injunction, and throughout the proceedings, it did not provide any satisfactory explanations for its breaches.', '7\\u2003For the purpose of setting out the context in which SUM 58 arose, we will give a brief background of the parties and the events leading to the filing of SUM 58. Subsequently, where relevant, we will discuss the appellant\u2019s conduct in relation to the Mareva injunction in greater detail.', '8\\u2003The respondent is a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands and wholly owned by Suntech Power Holdings Co Ltd (\u201cSPH\u201d), a company incorporated in the Cayman Islands. The respondent operated as an investment holding company, whereas SPH was a solar panel producer previously listed on the New York Stock Exchange. SPH was the ultimate holding company for multiple subsidiaries and affiliated companies, which we will refer to collectively as \u201cthe SPH Group\u201d.', '9\\u2003The appellant is a company incorporated in Singapore and was previously part of the SPH Group. It operated as an investment holding company engaged in equity investments. The appellant was also once a wholly-owned subsidiary of the respondent. This was during the period between 8 October 2007 and 15 May 2013. Thereafter, the respondent transferred its shares in the appellant to Wuxi Suntech Power Co Ltd (\u201cWuxi Suntech\u201d), another wholly-owned subsidiary of the respondent. At that particular point in time, Wuxi Suntech was in bankruptcy reorganisation under the laws of the People\u2019s Republic of China, and a group of ten individuals was appointed as its administrator.', '10\\u2003The SPH Group\u2019s principal operations were all controlled or managed out of Wuxi Suntech\u2019s offices. It was not disputed that all the accounting and financial records were prepared, held and stored by Wuxi Suntech.', '11\\u2003On 7 November 2013, SPH was placed into provisional liquidation, and on 27 January 2015, it was placed into official liquidation. The respondent was placed into liquidation on 14 November 2013 via a sole shareholder\u2019s resolution passed by SPH\u2019s joint provisional liquidators.', '12\\u2003On 12 February 2014, Wuxi Suntech entered into an agreement with Fast Fame Global Limited (\u201cFast Fame\u201d) for the transfer of its shares in the appellant to the latter for US$1. New directors were appointed to the appellant\u2019s board. One of them was Bai Yun, who affirmed most of the affidavits filed on behalf of the appellant in the Suit below and in SUM 58.', '13\\u2003Subsequent to the transfer of Wuxi Suntech\u2019s shares in the appellant to Fast Fame, the respondent\u2019s shares in Wuxi Suntech were transferred to an entity named Jiangsu Shunfeng Photovoltaic Technology Co Ltd, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of a company known as Shunfeng Photovoltaic International Limited.', '14\\u2003As a result, the respondent no longer controls Wuxi Suntech and the appellant. Instead, one Zheng Jianming is now the controlling shareholder of Wuxi Suntech, and, as we will explain below (at [69]), it is likely that he is also the ultimate controller of the appellant.', '15\\u2003Prior to the above breaking up of the SPH Group, the respondent alleged that it had, under its previous management, entered into a number of transactions with the appellant. Those transactions formed the basis of the respondent\u2019s claims against the appellant in the Suit below. As the appellant\u2019s assets lay in the many subsidiaries it controlled either directly or indirectly, the respondent was very concerned about the appellant\u2019s actions in relation to those subsidiaries. This became an important consideration for the respondent when it took out a Mareva injunction against the appellant in the Suit, and it later also became the central focus of SUM 58.', '16\\u2003The respondent commenced the Suit against the appellant on 14 January 2014 for: (a) the amount due under three loans made by the respondent to the appellant which were repayable on demand (\u201cthe Loans claim\u201d); and (b) the purchase price of US$55.56m which was allegedly payable by the appellant to the respondent under a share transfer agreement between them dated 8 August 2008 (\u201cthe Share Price claim\u201d).

The respondent also suspected that the appellant was attempting to dispose of its shareholdings in two of its other subsidiaries.', '19\\u2003In the light of the above discovery, the respondent filed a summons in the Suit seeking a worldwide Mareva injunction against the appellant (\u201cthe Mareva injunction\u201d).

It also set out a list of specific assets of the appellant which were to be frozen (along with all the other assets of the appellant) under the Mareva injunction. This list included the appellant\u2019s shares in Shanghai Suntech.', '22\\u2003The very objective of the Mareva injunction was to freeze, internationally, the appellant\u2019s assets up to the value of US$197,501,785, which was the total amount claimed by the respondent in the Suit.', '23\\u2003The trial for the Suit was held from 14 to 17 May 2018, and on 5 July 2018, the trial judge (\u201cthe Judge\u201d) gave judgment for the respondent for the sum of US$197,501,785. She found that both the Loans claim and the Share Price claim were made out.

The Judge\u2019s decision in the Suit (\u201cthe Judgment\u201d) is reported in Power Solar System Co Ltd (in liquidation) v Suntech Power Investment Pte Ltd [2018] SGHC 233.', '24\\u2003The very next day, on 6 July 2018, the appellant filed its notice of appeal for CA 109\/2018.', '25\\u2003Up till the delivery of the Judgment and the filing of the appellant\u2019s notice of appeal above, the appellant had yet to file its disclosure of assets affidavit pursuant to the Mareva injunction even though it was by then almost four years since the Mareva injunction was ordered.', '26\\u2003After the issuance of the Judgment, the respondent applied for and obtained a 60-day extension of the Mareva injunction.', '27\\u2003On 8 August 2018, the respondent applied to convert the Mareva injunction into a post-judgment Mareva injunction to aid the enforcement of the Judgment (the \u201cconversion application\u201d). The respondent also applied for its security for costs and its fortification of its undertaking for damages under the Mareva injunction to be paid out to it (the \u201cpayment out of court application\u201d).', '28\\u2003The parties subsequently entered into a without prejudice discussion on, inter alia, the respondent\u2019s conversion application. To facilitate the negotiations as well as to preserve the status quo, the parties entered into a by-consent order on 27 August 2018 to extend the Mareva injunction until 10 September 2018 or until the disposal of the conversion application, whichever was later.', '29\\u2003The negotiations between the parties came to naught, and both the conversion application and the payment out of court application were restored and heard on 6 December 2018. The Judge granted the respondent\u2019s prayers in both applications. She also ordered that the appellant pay the respondent costs for both applications, which she fixed at S$5,500.', '30\\u2003It was evident from the by-consent order entered into by the parties on 27 August 2018 to extend the Mareva injunction that the appellant was aware of the Mareva injunction and the obligations contained therein. Despite this knowledge, the appellant breached the Mareva injunction by its continuing failure to file its disclosure of assets affidavit. This was despite the fact that as at 27 August 2018, almost four years had passed since the Mareva injunction was issued.', '31\\u2003To make matters worse, shortly after entering into the by-consent order to extend the Mareva injunction, the appellant, in breach of the Mareva injunction, disposed of a number of its assets, including its shares in Shanghai Suntech, which were a key asset in the Share Price claim brought by the respondent (see above at [17]). The appellant transferred its shares in Shanghai Suntech for a mere RMB2 to Shanghai Shihao Trade Development Co Ltd (\u201cShanghai Shihao\u201d) and Zhenjiang Rietech New Energy Technology Co Ltd (\u201cZhenjiang Rietech\u201d) sometime in September 2018. As Zhenjiang Rietech was wholly owned by Shanghai Shihao, the latter in effect became the ultimate owner of Shanghai Suntech.', '32\\u2003It also came to light that the appellant had, in addition, disposed of two of its subsidiaries after the Mareva injunction was issued. These subsidiaries were:', '(a)\\u2003Suntech R&D Australia Pty Ltd (\u201cSuntech R&D\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the appellant, which had assets worth approximately A$1.9m. This subsidiary began its voluntary winding-up process on 13 November 2014 (slightly over two months after the Mareva injunction was imposed) and was de-registered on 28 January 2017; and', '(b)\\u2003Rietech Investments Ltd (\u201cRietech Investments\u201d), a subsidiary which was struck off the register of companies in Hong Kong and dissolved on 5 January 2018. This subsidiary owned a number of subsidiaries with a combined net asset value of RMB363.2m.', '33\\u2003After the respondent discovered the above breaches of the Mareva injunction in late 2018, it sought leave on 31 January 2019, by way of Summons No 608 of 2019 (\u201cSUM 608\u201d), to commence committal proceedings against the appellant. On 12 March 2019, leave was granted and the respondent applied for an Order for Committal against the appellant.', '34\\u2003On 6 April 2019, the eve of the hearing of the committal proceedings, Bai Yun filed his 17th affidavit (\u201cBY\u2019s 17th Affidavit\u201d) to explain the appellant\u2019s breaches of the Mareva injunction.', '35\\u2003On 8 April 2019, the committal application was heard and the Judge found the appellant to be in contempt of court for committing all of the above breaches of the Mareva injunction (see [30]\u2013[32] above). As a consequence, she ordered that:', '(a)\\u2003the appellant pay a fine of S$100,000;', '(b)\\u2003the appellant pay into court S$100,000 to secure its compliance with the Mareva injunction until its expiry; and', '(c)\\u2003the appellant pay the respondent the costs of SUM 608 as well as the costs incidental to and also of the issue and execution of this order and any order made therein (collectively, \u201cthe costs of the committal proceedings\u201d), with the quantum of such costs to be fixed, if not agreed within 14 days of the order, by the court upon either party\u2019s application.', 'The above is hereafter referred to as \u201cthe Contempt Order\u201d.

It also argued that the appellant had not purged its contempt by complying with the Mareva injunction and had not complied with the Contempt Order.', '40\\u2003SUM 58 was heard over three days. This was because we granted two adjournments to give the appellant the chance to file further affidavits to account for its breaches of the Mareva injunction and to explain the steps it had taken, if any, to comply with the Mareva injunction. The appellant filed two affidavits as follows:', '(a)\\u2003During the first adjournment, the appellant filed Bai Yun\u2019s first affidavit (\u201cBY\u2019s 1st Affidavit\u201d), which was exhibited in Danitza Hon Cai Xia\u2019s first affidavit dated 30 May 2019.', '(b)\\u2003During the second adjournment, the appellant filed Bai Yun\u2019s second affidavit (\u201cBY\u2019s 2nd Affidavit\u201d), which was exhibited in Danitza Hon Cai Xia\u2019s second affidavit dated 21 June 2019.', '41\\u2003During the course of SUM 58, the appellant paid the fine and the security imposed under the Contempt Order as well as the Miscellaneous Application Costs. The respondent then filed Summons No 74 of 2019 (\u201cSUM 74\u201d) for leave to amend SUM 58 to exclude the prayers in relation to the payment of the fine, the aforesaid security and the Miscellaneous Application Costs. In SUM 74, in the light of the appellant\u2019s affidavits above, the respondent also sought to add to SUM 58 a prayer asking this court to strike out CA 109\/2018 on the grounds that it was an abuse of the court\u2019s process. This application was supported by Mr Yat Kit Jong\u2019s first affidavit in SUM 74 (\u201cYKJ\u2019s Affidavit\u201d), which was filed under the cover of Mr Leong Ji Mun Gregory\u2019s first affidavit dated 28 June 2019.', '42\\u2003We allowed the appellant to reply to YKJ\u2019s Affidavit, and the appellant did so on 11 July 2019 by way of Bai Yun\u2019s affidavit dated 8 July 2019 in SUM 74.'"}

They have three children: two daughters who are 22 and 18 years old, and a son who is ten years old. The parties and their children are all Permanent Residents of Singapore. At the time of the hearing, the Husband was residing in Singapore, while the Wife was residing in Indonesia with the children.', '4\\u2003According to the Wife, the marriage broke down because the Husband began physically and mentally abusing her and their children. The Husband eventually faced criminal proceedings in Indonesia. On 23 July 2013, the West Jakarta District Court found the Husband guilty of \u201c[d]omestic physical violence and violence against children for committing in an obscene action\u201d and sentenced the Husband to a term of imprisonment of three years and six months, with a fine of IDR100m (approximately $9,750). The Husband\u2019s appeal was dismissed on 9 January 2014 by the West Jakarta High Court, which enhanced his sentence to an imprisonment term of four years and six months. The Husband has not served his sentence.', '5\\u2003The Wife filed for divorce in Indonesia during the ongoing criminal proceedings. On 5 June 2013, the West Jakarta District Court made the following orders:', '(a)\\u2003The parties were legally divorced with effect from 5th June 2013.', '(b)\\u2003The Wife shall have custody of the three children to the marriage.', '(c)\\u2003The Husband shall pay monthly maintenance for the three children at IDR50m.', '(d)\\u2003The marital attachment to the \u201ccommunity property\u201d requested by the Wife is refused.', '6\\u2003The Husband appealed to the Jakarta High Court, which dismissed the appeal on 5 May 2014 save for varying the monthly maintenance sum downwards to IDR22.5m (approximately $2,300). A further appeal to the Indonesian Supreme Court was dismissed on 27 August 2015.', '7\\u2003From the foregoing, it is clear that the District Court\u2019s order on the marital property (see [5(d)] above) was not disturbed on appeal. Counsel for the Wife explained at the hearing below that the purpose of attachment is to free the assets and is a prelude to the division of assets. This explanation was not challenged by the counsel for the Husband.', '8\\u2003As the request for marital attachment is of some importance to the current appeal, we set out the translation of the detailed order in full:', '9\\u2003The Wife\u2019s Indonesian lawyer explained that the West Jakarta District Court declined to levy the marital attachment because:', '10\\u2003The Wife maintained that the Husband had not fully complied with the Indonesian court\u2019s directions for him to pay maintenance for the children. She had also not taken any further step in the Indonesian courts.', '11\\u2003On 21 October 2016, the Wife applied under s 121D of the Women\u2019s Charter for leave to commence Ch 4A proceedings. She sought an order for the division of a property in Singapore, which she jointly owned with the Husband (hereinafter referred to as the \u201cSeaview Property\u201d). Her application was dismissed by the District Judge (\u201cthe District Judge\u201d) on 2 May 2017 on the sole ground that the Wife should have applied to the Indonesian courts for financial relief before applying for the same in Singapore.', '12\\u2003The Wife\u2019s appeal was allowed by the Judicial Commissioner of the High Court (\u201cthe Judge\u201d). The Judge held that the doctrine of natural forum does not apply to a determination under Ch 4A. The Wife thus need not show that Singapore is the more appropriate forum. The Judge then held that s 121D, which requires the applicant to show \u201csubstantial ground\u201d for her application for financial relief, relates to the entirety of the merits of the application. That in turn requires the court to consider the nine factors enumerated under s 121F, which relate to the appropriateness of granting financial relief. Contrary to the position adopted by the District Judge, she also held that Ch 4A does not set out any rule that an applicant had to exhaust all available remedies in the jurisdiction in which the foreign divorce was obtained before making a Ch 4A application in Singapore. Instead, she emphasised that s 121F(2)(f) simply invites the court to assess whether the applicant had a good reason for choosing Singapore over any other jurisdiction in which he or she may have a right to obtain financial relief from the other party. Applying the factors in s 121F to the facts, the Judge observed that the parties have a significant connection to Singapore. She also held that given the Husband\u2019s non-compliance with Indonesian court orders, it would be unfair and impractical to require the Wife to first seek financial relief from him in Indonesia. In addition, any order affecting the Seaview Property given by the Singapore court may be enforced in Singapore. It is therefore appropriate for the relief sought to be granted by a Singapore court. Accordingly, the Judge allowed the appeal and granted the Wife leave to make her application. Given that there was no Court of Appeal decision on the scope and application of the recently introduced provisions in Ch 4A, the Judge granted the Husband leave to appeal to this Court.'"}

First, that the appellant\u2019s claim for final relief in SUM 1757 could not be brought by way of a summons within an Originating Summons (\u201cOS\u201d). 10', 'Second, there were clearly substantial disputes of fact between the parties. Third, the appellant\u2019s claims went well beyond the scope of OS 624. 11', '10\\u2003On the first ground, the Judge was prepared to waive the procedural irregularity by treating SUM 1757 as notice of a counterclaim under O 28 r 7(2) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe Rules\u201d). 12', 'In relation to the second ground, the Judge was prepared to allow the conversion of the counterclaim in SUM 1757 to a writ action under O 28 r 8 given the substantial disputes of fact involved. 13', 'However, she noted that the appellant was not asking for his application to be treated as a counterclaim or for it to be converted to a writ action. Even if the Judge should decide to do the two things stated above in order to assist the appellant (who also appeared in person before the High Court), the Judge stated that, pursuant to O 28 r 7(3), she had to consider whether the subject matter of the counterclaim should be disposed of in that manner. The appellant\u2019s claims in SUM 1757 went well beyond the scope of OS 624. The Judge was of the view that \u201cthe OS should be confined to its original scope\u201d and stated that the OS was effectively concluded in fact, since she had dismissed the OS at the earlier hearing. The Judge decided that it was not a suitable case for the appellant\u2019s claim to be considered a counterclaim in the OS and for the proceedings to be converted to a writ action.

The Appellants thereafter sought a stay of the proceedings on case management grounds, relying on a dispute resolution clause found in a shareholders\u2019 agreement that had been entered into between RME and the Respondent. The dispute resolution clause provided for arbitration (\u201cthe arbitration clause\u201d): GD at [5]. The Appellants are not privy to that shareholders\u2019 agreement and are therefore neither bound by the arbitration clause nor able on their own to invoke it.

For the sake of clarity, our subsequent references to the Judge\u2019s decision should be understood in this light.

We will discuss this further momentarily but pause here to note that this was a curious order. The dispute resolution clause would only apply to any disputes between the Respondent and RME. The Respondent has brought no claim against RME. In these circumstances, it is not entirely clear to us why the action the Respondent had commenced against the Appellants should be stayed.

Much of the case turned on the form and shape of the Accused\u2019s penis, which went towards whether the Accused was in fact capable of committing some of the alleged acts of sexual assault, such as penile penetration, as well as the credibility of the Victim and that of the Accused\u2019s wife, whose evidence was used to support that of the Victim.', '3\\u2003At the appeal hearing in January 2018, the Accused by way of criminal motion sought to adduce fresh evidence from one Mohamad Bin Alwan, who could testify as to the shape and appearance of the Accused\u2019s penis after seeing the same while at a public toilet. Directions were given for the filing of the criminal motion; as it was, when the criminal motion was filed, the Accused instead sought to adduce the evidence of another person, Muhammad Ridzwan Bin Idris (\u201cthe Witness\u201d), who also saw the Accused\u2019s penis in a public toilet.', '4\\u2003The Court of Appeal directed that this Court was to receive additional evidence, consisting of:', '(a)\\u2003the Accused\u2019s evidence, to explain the circumstances in which he found two witnesses within two weeks who had seen his penis at the time of the offences; and', '(b)\\u2003the evidence of the Witness.', 'Specifically, the Accused\u2019s evidence was to be received in order to establish whether the Accused was party to any abuse of process.', '5\\u2003As to the other, putative, witness, Mohamad Alwan, the Prosecution was to consider whether it wished to interview him to determine whether there had been abuse of process and whether it wished to adduce his evidence.

Nothing was shown that the circumstances of the observation of the penis were not as described by the Witness; nothing was adduced that they were not running a stall at the Singapore Expo in 2013, or that they not smoked cigarettes together, or that they did not happen to go to the toilet together, or that the Witness had not seen the penis then.', '10\\u2003That the Accused was able to find two persons who had seen his penis did not mean his evidence should not be accepted. In any event, the other witness did not testify. Nothing was shown that what the Accused said about this other witness was untrue.', '11\\u2003The circumstance of the meeting between the Witness and Accused were not such as to be treated as false. Coincidences do happen. The high degree of similarity between the photograph of the Accused\u2019s penis and the drawing made by the Witness could not be taken against the defence; the Accused had testified that he did not have a copy of the photograph and the Witness had testified that the first time he saw the photograph was at the proceedings. What was drawn by the Witness was just a simple drawing.', '12\\u2003No reason existed for the Witness to risk himself by giving false evidence. Nothing showed any conspiracy or collusion between the Accused and the Witness to give false evidence in court.', '13\\u2003 The Prosecution argued that the evidence received should not be accepted. Both the Witness and Accused had lied about the evidence, as shown by the falsehoods about their friendship, how they met in February 2018, and the circumstances of the occasion on which the Witness saw the Accused\u2019s penis in 2013. It was shown that the Accused had in all likelihood colluded with the Witness in an attempt to get an acquittal. The additional evidence should not have any impact on the conviction.', '14\\u2003The Prosecution submitted that the conduct of the Accused amounted to an abuse of process. In addition, the court was invited to indicate that if the matter of sentence were before it, it would have ordered an uplift in sentence.'"}

{"casename":"2019_SGCA_61","fact":"'6\\u2003Given that the present dispute has its genesis in the Will, we set out the relevant portions as follows:', '7\\u2003The Will was executed by the Deceased on 3 January 2005, while she was warded in the Singapore General Hospital. The Deceased subsequently passed away on 8 January 2005. Apart from the Appellant and the Respondents, the Deceased has two other children who are beneficiaries under the Will but are not parties to the present appeals.', '8\\u2003Upon the Deceased\u2019s passing, the Appellant commenced District Court Suit No 2260 of 2005 (\u201cDC 2260\u201d) to apply for a grant of probate in respect of the Will. The Respondents and their other two siblings (collectively, \u201cthe Four Siblings\u201d) sought to challenge the validity of the Will. In Ong Wui Teck v Ong Wui Jin and others [2008] SGDC 103 (\u201cthe Validity Decision (DC)\u201d), District Judge James Leong (\u201cDJ Leong\u201d) found that the Will was validly executed by the Deceased and granted probate of the same to the Appellant. DJ Leong\u2019s decision was subsequently upheld on appeal by Chan Sek Keong CJ in', 'Ong Wui Jin and others v Ong Wui Teck [2009] SGHC 50 (\u201cthe Validity Decision (HC)\u201d).', '9\\u2003One of the issues relevant to these appeals, specifically the $20,000 Claims, that was heavily contested before both DJ Leong and Chan CJ was in relation to $50,000 that was bequeathed to the Appellant pursuant to cl 3.1 of the Will. The Four Siblings argued before DJ Leong and Chan CJ that the Deceased could not have intended to execute the Will with cl 3.1 in it, because it went against her intention to divide the Estate equally among her five children. Chan CJ observed that the attendance note of Ms Spring Tan (\u201cMs Tan\u201d), an advocate and solicitor who was present at the signing of the Will, indicated that the Deceased was aware of the terms of the Will when she executed it: the Validity Decision (HC) at [28]. Of particular significance is the following portion from the said attendance note, which alludes to the circumstances under which the Respondents had broached the topic of the $50,000 that was bequeathed to the Appellant. It also shows how the Respondents had relied on the fact that the Appellant was being given an additional $50,000 to ask the Deceased for an additional $20,000 each for themselves:', '10\\u2003On 16 April 2014, the Appellant filed Originating Summons No 365 of 2014 (\u201cOS 365\u201d) for an application that he, as executor of the Estate, be allowed a commission of $75,000, for work done by him and his wife in the administration of the Estate. The Judge allowed the Appellant\u2019s claim in full. This will be relevant to our decision on the Administration Costs Claims.', '11\\u2003On 7 August 2014, the Appellant filed the underlying application, OS 763, claiming, inter alia, various sums which were allegedly unaccounted for by the Respondents on behalf of the Estate. The Judge heard OS 763 for the first time on 29 December 2016. He conclusively dealt with most of the prayers in OS 763, and adjourned the matter to consider the remaining prayers. At this hearing, the First Respondent raised the issue of the Deceased\u2019s medical expenses that she had allegedly paid for on the Deceased\u2019s behalf using her Central Provident Fund\u2019s Medisave account moneys and her American Express credit card. The Appellant denied these claims on the basis that the Deceased had paid for her own medical expenses while she was alive. The Judge held that the First Respondent\u2019s claim for the medical expenses that she had incurred on the Deceased\u2019s behalf was a claim for a debt as a creditor of the Estate, and that she should make a claim with the Appellant for this debt. The Judge further stated that if the Appellant did not admit to the debt, the First Respondent would then have the option of commencing legal proceedings to make a claim for the debt.', '12\\u2003At the next hearing which took place on 4 January 2017, the Judge dealt with the remaining prayers save for two, which related to the setting aside of moneys for the payment of the Estate\u2019s storage costs and to provide for possible future claims by the beneficiaries. The Judge decided that the best way forward would be to allow the Respondents to raise any claims they had against the Estate as counterclaims in OS 763, so that all possible claims could be dealt with at once thus making it unnecessary to set aside any sum of money as a contingency for future claims. The Judge adjourned the matter for the Respondents to file further affidavits in support of any counterclaims they may have against the Estate.', '13\\u2003On 31 January 2017, the First Respondent filed an affidavit stating that she wished to make a claim against the Estate for, inter alia:', '(a)\\u2003$20,000 that was promised to her by the Deceased; and', '(b)\\u2003reimbursement for the Deceased\u2019s cancer medication expenses which she paid for with her American Express credit card and moneys from her Medisave account, including interest on those amounts.', '14\\u2003On 3 February 2017, the Second Respondent filed an affidavit stating that he too wished to make a claim for the $20,000 that was also promised to him by the Deceased. The Respondents both relied on the fact that Ms Tan had witnessed the Deceased making the promise to give them $20,000 each in support of their claims.', '15\\u2003On 18 September 2017, the Appellant filed further submissions claiming various administration costs from the Estate ie, the Administration Costs Claims. His claims comprised three components, namely:', '(a)\\u2003\u201caccounting costs\u201d for accountancy services provided by the Appellant\u2019s wife in the administration of the Estate in the sum of $10,000 (\u201cthe Accounting Costs Claim\u201d);', '(b)\\u2003work done by the Appellant as a litigant-in-person representing the Estate in the sum of $20,000 (\u201cthe Litigation Costs Claim\u201d); and', '(c)\\u2003costs for storage and archiving of the Estate\u2019s records in the sum of $5,000. Given that the Judge had allowed this head of claim on a reimbursement basis, and since no appeal has been filed against this aspect of the Judge\u2019s decision, we will say no more on this.'"}
{"casename":"2019_SGCA_62","fact":"'7\\u2003The Appellant is a 45-year-old Singaporean male. He married the Victim\u2019s mother (\u201cthe Mother\u201d) in September 1999, and they were subsequently divorced in December 2014. The Victim, who was born in November 2000, is their eldest daughter. As mentioned at [1] above, she was aged between 11 and 13 at the time of the offences, which took place between the end of 2011 and 15 April 2014. The Appellant and the Mother have two other children: a boy (\u201cthe Brother\u201d) and a girl (\u201cthe Sister\u201d).', '8\\u2003At the time of the offences, the Appellant was residing with the Mother, their three children and a domestic helper at the Family Home, which was a three-bedroom flat. The Appellant, the Mother and the Sister slept in the master bedroom, while the Victim and the Brother each had their own bedrooms. The Victim\u2019s maternal grandparents would also stay at the Family Home on most weekends.', '9\\u2003The charges that were preferred against the Appellant as well as the facts relating to each of the charges based on the Victim\u2019s account of the events are set out in detail in the GD at [5] and [9]\u2013[16]. In summary, the Appellant faced a total of ten charges: five under s 354(2) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (\u201cPC\u201d), four under s 376 of the PC and one under s 7(a) of the Children and Young Persons Act (Cap 38, 2001 Rev Ed) (\u201cCYPA\u201d).', '10\\u2003The first incident occurred in the Brother\u2019s bedroom, sometime towards the end of 2011, when the Victim was just 11 years old. The Victim frequently gave the Appellant massages, and the Appellant asked the Victim to massage his legs on the day of the offence. While the Victim was massaging the Appellant\u2019s upper thigh region, he grabbed hold of her hand and rubbed it across his penis. This formed the subject of the first charge, which was brought under s 7(a) of the CYPA.', '11\\u2003A subsequent incident occurred between the end of 2011 and the end of 2012 while the Victim was alone with the Appellant in the master bedroom. The Appellant instructed the Victim to sit with her knees bent and with the soles of her feet touching each other. While facing the Victim, the Appellant lifted his sarong and pulled it over her head. The Victim said that she was shrouded in darkness, and thereafter felt the Appellant\u2019s penis rubbing against her forehead for a few minutes. This formed the subject of the second charge, which was brought under s 354(2) of the PC.', '12\\u2003Based on the Victim\u2019s reckoning, over the course of 2012, the Appellant penetrated her mouth with his penis on about ten occasions, with about 2.5 inches of his penis entering her mouth on each occasion. The first incident happened in the early part of 2012, when the Victim was in Primary Six, and the last happened almost a year later just before she started secondary school. Each time, the Appellant would ask the Victim to kneel in the toilet of the master bedroom, and then insert his penis into her mouth for a few minutes. If the Victim resisted, the Appellant would use his hands to force her mouth open. These acts formed the subject of the third and fourth charges, which were brought under s 376(1)(a) of the PC and punishable under s 376(4)(b) thereof.', '13\\u2003In two separate incidents between 2012 and 14 April 2014, the Appellant penetrated the Victim\u2019s anus, first with his finger and then with his penis. The first incident occurred while the Appellant and the Victim were alone in the master bedroom. The Appellant locked the bedroom door and asked the Victim to lie face down on the bed, with her upper body on the bed and her legs dangling over the side. The Appellant removed all of the Victim\u2019s clothes including her undergarments, took a bottle of olive oil from the shelf, and rubbed some of the oil on his fingers as well as on the Victim\u2019s anus. The Victim then felt the Appellant pushing his finger into her anus. After a few minutes, the Appellant withdrew his finger from the Victim\u2019s anus and penetrated her anus with his penis. The second incident took place in the Victim\u2019s bedroom. Similarly, the Appellant first penetrated the Victim\u2019s anus with his finger before doing so with his penis. On that occasion, however, the Appellant used the Brother\u2019s hair gel as a lubricant instead of olive oil. These acts formed the subject of the fifth and sixth charges, which were brought under s 376(2)(a) and s 376(1)(a) respectively of the PC and punishable under s 376(4)(b) thereof.', '14\\u2003The Victim also testified that the Appellant took off her clothes and licked her vagina on five to ten occasions between 2012 and 14 April 2014. These incidents happened in either the Victim\u2019s bedroom or the master bedroom. What the Appellant usually did on these occasions was to place the Victim\u2019s entire body on the bed and then position himself either on top of or beside her. Thereafter, he would remove the Victim\u2019s clothes and lick her vagina. The Victim would resist the Appellant by trying to bring her legs together, but the Appellant would press his hands against her thighs to keep them open. These incidents formed the subject of the seventh charge, which was brought under s 354(2) of the PC.', '15\\u2003On a number of occasions between 2012 and 14 April 2014, while the Victim was in the master bedroom using the family computer for her schoolwork, the Appellant hugged her from behind and massaged her shoulders. While massaging the Victim, the Appellant slipped his hands under her undergarment to grab and squeeze her breasts. He also licked her breasts. These incidents formed the subject of the eighth charge, which was brought under s 354(2) of the PC.', '16\\u2003The Victim further recounted that on an unspecified number of occasions between 2012 and 14 April 2014, the Appellant asked her to lie face up on the bed with her legs crossed so that he could \u201ccheck\u201d her vagina. The Appellant then pushed the Victim\u2019s crossed legs up towards her chest and used his finger to touch and rub the area outside her vagina. He also attempted to penetrate her vagina with his finger, but stopped when she made hissing noises to indicate that she was in pain. These incidents formed the subject of the ninth charge, which was brought under s 354(2) of the PC.', '17\\u2003On the night of 15 April 2014, the Victim was in the master bedroom using the family computer. Both the Appellant and the Mother were with her in the master bedroom. The Appellant then asked the Victim to massage him. The Mother left the master bedroom and went to the living room, leaving the Appellant alone with the Victim. The bedroom door was then locked. The Appellant asked the Victim to lie down on the bed, but she refused. The Appellant then pulled her down and made her lie face up on the bed. The Appellant removed the Victim\u2019s pants and her underwear, clambered on her, and started to rub his penis against her vagina. When the Victim turned over to try and avoid contact with the Appellant, he rubbed his penis against her anus. This formed the subject of the tenth charge, which was brought under s 354(2) of the PC.', '18\\u2003On 16 April 2014, the day after the events constituting the tenth charge, the Victim disclosed the Appellant\u2019s acts of sexual abuse against her to the Mother by way of a WhatsApp text message.', '19\\u2003The Mother was initially sceptical, and repeatedly asked the Victim whether she was speaking the truth and warned her not to lie. After the Victim reassured the Mother that she was not lying, the Mother told the Victim that she loved her and asked her to come home. On the Mother\u2019s instructions, the Victim moved to the house of an aunt the next day, 17 April 2014. The Victim only returned to the Family Home some days later, by which time the Appellant was no longer residing there. On 6 May 2014, the Mother reported the Appellant\u2019s acts of sexual abuse against the Victim to the police. The next day, 7 May 2014, the Mother applied for a Personal Protection Order against the Appellant, and also filed for divorce.', '20\\u2003As alluded to at [2] above, a central plank of the Appellant\u2019s defence was that his penis was deformed, which made it highly improbable that he could have penetrated the Victim\u2019s mouth and anus with his penis. The Appellant claimed that he had undergone a number of penis enlargement procedures in Johor Bahru between 2005 and 2009. The last of those procedures had gone wrong, resulting in the present deformed state of his penis. The Appellant contended that his penis was already in this state at the time of the offences. In support of this ground of defence, the Appellant adduced two photographs which depicted the state of his penis as at October 2016 (\u201cthe October 2016 photos\u201d), along with a medical report from Dr Lee Fang Jann (\u201cDr Lee\u201d) dated 17 October 2016. Dr Lee observed that the Appellant\u2019s penis had an \u201cuneven bulbous expansion\u201d. He also observed that in both its flaccid and its erect states, the Appellant\u2019s penis measured 9.5cm, and the corresponding maximum penile girth at the proximal shaft measured 25cm. He opined that \u201cthe large penile girth [made] it unlikely for [the Appellant] to be able to perform penile-vaginal, penile-anal and penile-oral intercourse with a[n] 11 year-old girl\u201d.', '21\\u2003The Victim and the Mother, however, gave a different description of the Appellant\u2019s penis at the time of the offences. At the trial, the Victim and the Mother each provided three drawings of the Appellant\u2019s penis. All of the Mother\u2019s drawings showed some signs of a deformity at the proximal end of the penile shaft, although the penis was of relatively normal girth at the distal end. As for the Victim, her first two drawings showed an undeformed penis, whereas her last drawing showed some signs of a bulbous growth at the proximal end of the penile shaft. The Appellant relied on this inconsistency to assert, first, that the Victim\u2019s evidence was not reliable, and, second, that there was evidence to support his contention that there was already some penile deformity in existence at the time the offences were committed.'"}

He is the maternal grandfather of the victim, an 11-year-old boy, whom we shall refer to as \u201cVB\u201d. VB was between seven and eight years old at the time of the offences. VB resided with his maternal grandparents, his parents and a domestic helper in a three-bedroom flat. BPH and his wife occupied one bedroom which had an adjoining toilet. VB and his parents occupied the other two bedrooms.', '4\\u2003Sometime in February or March 2015, VB was watching television when BPH asked him to follow him to BPH\u2019s bedroom. VB, who was seven years old then, complied. When they were in BPH\u2019s bedroom, both of them lay down on the bed, with VB on BPH\u2019s right. After a short chat, BPH pulled VB towards himself and kissed VB\u2019s face and neck before slipping his hand into VB\u2019s shorts and fondling VB\u2019s penis. VB did not consent to the touching. BPH then undressed VB completely and proceeded to undress himself completely as well. He put his thigh across VB such that it made contact with VB\u2019s penis. BPH then fondled VB\u2019s penis again. Finally, BPH positioned VB\u2019s body to cause VB\u2019s back to face him and he then grabbed VB\u2019s buttock. At this point in time, the domestic helper called for VB and BPH panicked. BPH dressed up quickly and told VB to put on his shorts. Before VB left the bedroom, BPH told VB not to tell anyone about this incident.', '5\\u2003Between 1 December 2015 and 18 September 2016, BPH did not live in the flat because he was confined in the Drug Rehabilitation Centre. He was released on a temporary release scheme on 19 September 2016 and returned to live in the flat. In the afternoon of 28 September 2016, at about 3pm, only BPH and VB (now 8 years old) were in the flat. BPH asked VB to follow him into his bedroom and VB complied. They lay in bed together. BPH undressed VB and then himself. When they were both naked, BPH hugged VB and positioned VB so that he was on top of BPH\u2019s body and facing BPH. In this position, BPH inserted his right middle finger into VB\u2019s anus. VB did not consent to the act. As BPH did this, he whispered to VB, \u201cFuck you\u201d. Upon being digitally penetrated by BPH, VB\u2019s body jerked in pain and he voiced his discomfort. However, BPH told VB to wait and he continued with the act. He only removed his finger from VB\u2019s anus when he felt faecal matter on his finger. BPH then hugged VB and instructed him not to tell anyone about the incident. VB remained on the bed while BPH went into the adjoining toilet to wash his finger. After leaving the bedroom briefly, BPH went back to the said toilet and masturbated, ejaculating into the toilet bowl.', '6\\u2003The offences came to light on the night of 22 October 2016 when VB told his mother (BPH\u2019s daughter) that he did not want to be alone with BPH the next day because BPH had molested him. The mother was shocked and confronted BPH in her bedroom in the presence of BPH\u2019s wife. BPH admitted his wrongdoing and asked his daughter for forgiveness. VB overheard the conversation and started crying. VB\u2019s father heard the boy crying and went to find out what was happening. VB\u2019s mother informed VB\u2019s father that BPH had touched VB inappropriately. VB\u2019s father told his wife to make a police report. She did so the following afternoon.', '7\\u2003BPH was eventually charged. He was represented by counsel in the High Court when he pleaded guilty to the following two charges:', '(a)\\u2003Sexual assault by penetration (digital-anal) of a person under 14 years of age punishable under s 376(2)(a) read with s 376(4)(b) of the Penal Code.

Since this case involved the former, one year\u2019s imprisonment ought to be deducted from the Pram Nair sentencing bands to reflect the lower severity of the offence.', '(b)\\u2003The aggravating factors were abuse of trust, the young age of the victim and moral corruption.', '(c)\\u2003BPH\u2019s plea of guilt and lack of antecedents were mitigating factors.', '(d)\\u2003BPH\u2019s lack of premeditation, his heterosexuality and the assessment that he was not a paedophile were not mitigating factors.', '(e)\\u2003The appropriate sentence was 11 years\u2019 imprisonment for the sexual penetration charge and 30 months\u2019 imprisonment for the outrage of modesty charge.', '(f)\\u2003Nevertheless, the sentences should be reduced to ten years\u2019 imprisonment and two years\u2019 imprisonment respectively on account of the totality principle.', '(g)\\u2003Both sentences should run consecutively with effect from the date of remand on 1 June 2017, yielding an aggregate sentence of 12 years\u2019 imprisonment.', '10\\u2003BVZ, a Singaporean, is now 50 years old. He was 49 when we dismissed his appeal against sentence which included 16 strokes of the cane. At the dates of the offences against the four female victims, he was 47 years old. The four female victims, whom we shall refer to as \u201cV1\u201d, \u201cV2\u201d, \u201cV3\u201d and \u201cV4\u201d were all 14 years old at the time of the offences in 2016 and in 2017. V3 is BVZ\u2019s biological daughter. All four victims were friends from primary school and would often spend time in V3\u2019s home and sometimes would stay over for the night. BVZ lived with his wife and V3 in a flat. At the material times, his wife worked the night shift and would only return home in the morning.', '11\\u2003Sometime one night in September 2016, V1 went to V3\u2019s flat to get some instant noodles from her. V3 and her mother were not at home. Only BVZ was. BVZ opened the door of the flat for V1. V1 went inside to collect the instant noodles from the living room of the flat. As V1 was about to leave, BVZ told her there was \u201csomething\u201d outside the flat and told her not to go home yet. V1 therefore waited a while in the flat.', '12\\u2003After some time, V1 wanted to go home. BVZ went to open the door for her. As he approached the door, he pretended to be spiritually possessed suddenly by \u201cacting strangely, performing \u2018silat\u2019 moves and speaking in a deep voice\u201d. BVZ removed his t-shirt and pulled down his jeans and told V1 that if she wanted him to \u201cbecome normal\u201d again, she had to give him a \u201cblow job\u201d (ie, fellatio).', '13\\u2003V1 felt very afraid and sat on the floor against the wall with her eyes closed. BVZ proceeded to kneel in front of her. V1 opened her eyes and saw that BVZ was completely naked, with his penis erect. BVZ asked V1 to open her mouth but she refused. BVZ continued to ask her to open her mouth. Out of fear, V1 relented and opened her mouth. BVZ then put his penis in her mouth and instructed her to suck his penis as he moved his penis in and out of her mouth. This continued for a few minutes until BVZ ejaculated in her mouth. BVZ instructed V1 to swallow his semen, which she did.', '14\\u2003BVZ then ran out of the flat. When he returned, he pretended that he was normal again and asked V1 what had happened. BVZ got dressed and gave V1 a cup of water and apologised to her. He also told her not to tell anyone what had happened. After some time, BVZ brought V1 back to her home which was one floor above his flat.', '15\\u2003Sometime in late September 2016, V4 ran away from her home and went to V3\u2019s flat. V4 told BVZ that she had run away from home and BVZ allowed her to stay in his flat. V4 stayed in the flat and slept in the bedroom with V3 at night. BVZ slept in the living room.', '16\\u2003Sometime in the morning of 4 October 2016, V4 was asleep alone in the bedroom of the flat as V3 had left for school. BVZ entered the bedroom and woke V4 up. BVZ told her that he wanted her to satisfy him.', '17\\u2003BVZ then touched V4\u2019s breast over her t-shirt. This formed the subject of the eighth charge. V4 quickly took a pillow to cover her chest. BVZ then told V4 that he wanted her to give him a \u201cblow job\u201d, telling her that she was staying for free in his flat. V4 was frightened and began crying. Pretending that she needed to relieve herself, V4 quickly went to the toilet and there, she sent text messages to V2 to seek help. V2 in turn informed V3 about what had happened. V3 then approached one of her teachers for help.', '18\\u2003Later that morning, two teachers from V3\u2019s secondary school arrived at BVZ\u2019s flat and escorted V4 away. V4 was then brought to her secondary school.', '19\\u2003After the incident that was the subject of the first sexual penetration charge, V1 only went to V3\u2019s home when she was with V3. On the night of 2 July 2017, V1 was in V3\u2019s bedroom watching movies with V3. V3 fell asleep. V1 left her room to use the toilet. She met BVZ. BVZ asked her about the location of the gaming shop which she and V3 frequented. V1 told him it was in Geylang. BVZ asked V1 to take him there. He also told her not to wake V3 up. They rode on his electronic bicycle to the gaming shop. When they arrived, V1 wanted to meet some friends but BVZ did not allow her to do so. Instead, he brought V1 to his friend\u2019s house at Chai Chee where V1 watched television while BVZ chatted with his friend. They left at about midnight.', '20\\u2003On the way back to BVZ\u2019s flat, the battery of his electronic bicycle went flat. BVZ parked the bicycle at a petrol kiosk in the vicinity of Changi Road and brought V1 to the fourth floor of the multi-storey carpark of Joo Chiat Complex, a short walk away. It was then about 12.50am on 3 July 2017.', '21\\u2003At the multi-storey carpark, BVZ asked V1 to give him a \u201cblow job\u201d. V1 started crying and told BVZ she did not want to. BVZ told her this would be the last time and that he would not disturb her any more after this. V1 refused again. BVZ became angry and continued to ask V1 to give him a \u201cblow job\u201d. V1 continued to refuse. BVZ then held her neck with his hand and threatened to punch her while making a gesture of punching her stomach. V1 kept quiet and continued crying, feeling helpless and afraid for her safety.', '22\\u2003BVZ then unzipped his jeans and took out his penis. Out of fear, V1 complied with BVZ\u2019s demand and knelt down. BVZ then inserted his penis into her mouth and moved it in and out. After some time, BVZ ejaculated in V1\u2019s mouth. She spat the semen out.', '23\\u2003BVZ then called for a private-hire car and they returned to BVZ\u2019s flat. BVZ told V1 to take care of V3 and went out. V1 did not consent to BVZ penetrating her mouth with his penis.', '24\\u2003On 16 August 2017, V1 and V2 were with V3 at V3\u2019s home. V3\u2019s parents were not at home. The three girls took BVZ\u2019s electronic bicycle and went out with their male friend. They returned to the flat sometime past 3am on 17 August 2017.', '25\\u2003BVZ returned to the flat at about 5am on 17 August 2017. He became angry with V3 when he realised that V3 and her friends had used his electronic bicycle without his permission.', '26\\u2003At about 6am, BVZ asked to speak to either V1 or V2 individually outside the flat at the staircase landing. Both of them refused to go. BVZ then brought his daughter V3 out to the staircase landing. He spoke to her for a while, then told her to ask either V1 or V2 to go to him at the staircase landing. V3 went back to her flat and told V2 that BVZ wanted to see her. V2 was reluctant to go as she was afraid but V3 assured her that she would seek help. V2 then went out to meet BVZ.', '27\\u2003At the staircase landing, BVZ asked V2 to promise to take care of V3. V2 answered that she would. BVZ gave V2 four \u201cEpam Nitrazepam BP 5mg\u201d pills, which contained Nitrazepam. He asked her to consume the pills, with the intention of facilitating the commission of an offence of sexual penetration of a minor under s 376A(1)(a) of the Penal Code. BVZ told her that if she refused, he would hit V3. V2 then consumed the pills with some Coca-cola provided by BVZ. He then gave V2 a rolled up cigarette and asked her to smoke it. V2 did as she was told. V2 began to feel dizzy. BVZ then asked her to give him a \u201cblow job\u201d.', '28\\u2003V2 managed to walk away. She saw V1 who was waiting for her. She grabbed hold of V1 and both of them went up quickly to V1\u2019s flat where they locked themselves in until the police arrived. They then returned to V3\u2019s flat to meet the police officers.', '29\\u2003Later that day, V2 was brought to the Kandang Kerbau Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Hospital. She was found to have clinical symptoms of Nitrazepam overdose, including \u201cdrowsiness, slurred speech, slowness to response and unsteady gait\u201d. A report prepared by the Health Sciences Authority showed that 7-aminonitrazepam and Nitrazepam were detected in V2\u2019s blood and urine samples. Nitrazepam is a poison listed in the Schedule to the Poisons Act (Cap 234, 1999 Rev Ed). It is a prescription-only medication used to treat insomnia or convulsions.', '30\\u2003BVZ, who was represented by counsel in the High Court, pleaded guilty and was convicted on four charges as follows:', '(a)\\u2003Two charges of sexual assault by penetration (fellatio) under', 's 376(1)(a) of the Penal Code (against V1);', '(b)\\u2003one charge of causing hurt by means of poison under s 328 of the Penal Code (against V2); and', '(c)\\u2003one charge of outrage of modesty under s 354(1) of the Penal Code (against V4).', '31\\u2003Six other charges were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing:', '(a)\\u2003Two charges of attempting to procure the commission of an indecent act with a young person (against V2 and V4) punishable under s 7(a) of the Children and Young Persons Act (Cap 38, 2001 Rev Ed);', '(b)\\u2003one charge of voluntarily causing hurt (against V3) punishable under s 323 of the Penal Code;', '(c)\\u2003one charge of criminal intimidation (against V3) punishable under s 506 of the Penal Code;', '(d)\\u2003one charge of mischief (against V4) punishable under s 426 of the Penal Code; and', '(e)\\u2003one charge of theft from a store punishable under s 380 of the Penal Code. This offence was committed in July 2012 when BVZ was 42 years old.', '32\\u2003The Judge in BVZ decided as follows:', '(a)\\u2003The six TIC charges were noted, as was the fact that BVZ was not traced for sexual offences.', '(b)\\u2003BVZ was a sexual predator who had preyed on vulnerable minors. Moreover, he had committed serious sexual offences. The principles of general deterrence and retribution therefore applied.', '(c)\\u2003The Pram Nair framework should be applied to the sentences for the sexual penetration charges.', '(d)\\u2003The charges each fell within Band 2 of the sentencing bands of the Pram Nair framework. There were five offence-specific factors: (1) the young age of the victim, V1; (2) BVZ standing in a quasi-parental relationship to V1 and therefore the abuse of trust; (3) the humiliating nature of BVZ\u2019s acts; (4) BVZ\u2019s premeditation in committing the offences; and (5) BVZ\u2019s use of force in respect of the second charge.', '(e)\\u2003BVZ\u2019s plea of guilt was a relevant mitigating factor because he spared the victims from having to relive the traumatic events by recounting them at trial. Ten years\u2019 imprisonment and eight strokes of the cane were appropriate for each of the two sexual penetration charges.', '(f)\\u2003As for the offence of causing hurt by means of poison, a sentence of three years\u2019 imprisonment was appropriate.', '(g)\\u2003For the outrage of modesty charge, the offence fell within Band 2 of the sentencing bands set out in Kunasekaran s\/o Kalimuthu Somasundara v Public Prosecutor [2018] 4 SLR 580 because of BVZ\u2019s intrusion into V4\u2019s private parts, abuse of trust and premeditation in the offence. The appropriate sentence, after accounting for BVZ\u2019s plea of guilt, was ten months\u2019 imprisonment.', '(h)\\u2003The imprisonment terms for the two most serious offences ought to run consecutively. Although the victim in both sexual penetration charges was V1, the offences took place ten months apart and were separate, distinct and unrelated. Running the sentences consecutively would ensure that BVZ received a distinct punishment for his second offence against V1; conversely, it would be unjust if BVZ effectively received no real punishment for sexually assaulting V1 again. The global sentence ordered was therefore 20 years\u2019 imprisonment and 16 strokes of the cane.'"}

{"casename":"2019_SGCA_67","fact":"'9\\u2003The background facts are concisely narrated in the Judge\u2019s decision and it is not necessary for us to repeat them save for some salient facts. The business relationship between Adinop and Rovithai began in the 1990s and this business relationship ended in 2014. Adinop did not have a formal distributorship agreement with Rovithai at the beginning of their relationship. The distributorship arrangement to distribute DSM products in Thailand was only formalised and confirmed in writing much later in a letter dated 31 January 2005 from Rovithai to Adinop. 3', 'Even then, the core terms that governed the distributorship arrangement between Adinop and Rovithai were vague or lacked clarity as to whether Adinop was an exclusive distributor. 4', 'In fact, the state of affairs was that Rovithai could make decisions on which DSM products would be made available to any given appointed distributor for a given market, and within the food, beverage and nutrition (\u201cFB&N\u201d) range of products\/ingredients, different distributors could be appointed for different ranges of DSM FB&N products\/ingredients. If anything, the Judge found that Adinop was the \u201cexclusive distributor\u201d for DSM products only in the sense that it would not sell or distribute ingredients produced by another manufacturer which were the same as those that were supplied by Rovithai. There is no appeal against the Judge\u2019s finding that Adinop was not Rovithai\u2019s exclusive distributor.', '10\\u2003Pursuant to the distributorship arrangement, Adinop would place periodic bulk orders of DSM nutritional products with Rovithai who would source the purchases from DSM Singapore. Adinop would sell these products to FB&N manufacturers in Thailand at a mark-up and price determined by Adinop. The Judge noted that Rovithai would set annual sales targets premised on the total value and quantity of purchase orders placed with Rovithai, the total number of Adinop\u2019s customers and the number of planned projects. Adinop was required to attend quarterly meetings and Adinop would produce quarterly reports on the sales performance of DSM Products, problems or difficulties that had been encountered and efforts made to expand the customer base for DSM Products (see [8]\u2013[11] of the HC Judgment). The Quarterly Customer Information were disclosed to Rovithai at the latter\u2019s request during these quarterly meetings.', '11\\u2003Naturally, Adinop and the respondents were interested in the development of Adinop\u2019s customer base for DSM products. Adinop\u2019s profits were dependent on the number of customers who purchased the DSM Products. As for the respondents, the more customers Adinop had, the more DSM products Adinop would purchase from Rovithai thereby increasing its revenues. To this end, Adinop and the respondents had worked together on several occasions to increase Adinop\u2019s market reach. For instance, the parties had participated in a number of FB&N exhibitions in Thailand in an effort to attract more customers.', '12\\u2003Rovithai issued its notice of termination to terminate the distributorship arrangement with Adinop on 10 June 2014. This notice had a month-long notice period that expired on 10 July 2014. The notification of the termination to Adinop\u2019s customers (ie, the Notice) was sent on 1 July 2014 well before the notice period expired. The parties accept that the termination of the distributorship arrangement was not an issue before the Judge.', '13\\u2003As mentioned, Adinop and the respondents are parties to the Confidentiality Agreement. Both Rovithai and DSM Singapore are collectively referred to in the Confidentiality Agreement as DSM. The parties signed the Confidentiality Agreement on 22 October 2013. The Confidentiality Agreement was for a period of one year commencing from 1 June 2013 to 30 June 2014. It is common ground that the Confidentiality Agreement was not extended.', '14\\u2003The two \u201cwhereas clauses\u201d recited at the beginning of the Confidentiality Agreement are crucial to appreciating the scope of the parties\u2019 obligations to safeguard what the agreement defined as \u201cConfidential Information\u201d. We reproduce them here 5', ':', '15\\u2003It is apparent from the first whereas clause (hereafter, the \u201cfirst recital\u201d) that what is considered as Confidential Information captures information, on the one hand disclosed by both the respondents, being \u201ccertain proprietary information relating to its products\u201d and, on the other hand disclosed by Adinop, being \u201ccertain proprietary information relating to its business.\u201d The second whereas clause (hereafter, the \u201csecond recital\u201d) contemplates disclosure of each party\u2019s confidential information to the other parties, but only insofar as the disclosure is made for \u201cthe purpose of the distribution arrangement between the parties\u201d (the \u201cPurpose\u201d).', '16\\u2003However, not all that is defined as Confidential Information in the Confidentiality Agreement is subject to the restrictions of the Confidentiality Agreement. Clause 1 of the Confidentiality Agreement indicates that disclosures of Confidential Information are subject to the Agreement only if they are reduced to writing, bear a \u201cConfidential\u201d marking, and are sent to the receiving party. Clause 1 provides as follows:', 'We will discuss the other clauses of the Confidentiality Agreement, where relevant, later in this judgment.', '17\\u2003The Key Customers List is a list of Adinop\u2019s key customers, who are Thai FB&N manufacturers, to whom Adinop had sold standard DSM ingredient products. The Key Customers List comprises six printed pages with a confidentiality statement marked at the bottom of each page in Thai script. A total of 42 customers were listed. Information provided for each customer concerned: (a) the DSM product(s) the customer purchased; (b) the application of each product; and (c) the estimated volume of each product ordered per quarter in kilograms. The Key Customers List does not set out the contact details or addresses of the customers listed and does not contain the list of all of Adinop\u2019s customers who purchase DSM Products but only the major customers. 6', 'Adinop provided the Key Customers List to Rovithai on 9 May 2014, shortly before 10 June 2014 being the date on which Rovithai informed Adinop of its decision to terminate their distributorship arrangement.

{"casename":"2019_SGCA_69","fact":"'3\\u2003The appellant, Yashwant Bajaj (\u201cMr Bajaj\u201d) and the respondent, Toru Ueda (\u201cMr Ueda\u201d) were partners in a fund management business. They were the sole directors and equal shareholders of Hachiman Capital Management (\u201cHCM\u201d), incorporated in the Cayman Islands, which managed a hedge fund in Japan, known as the Hachiman Japan Fund (\u201cthe Fund\u201d). From 2004 to 2009, Mr Bajaj and Mr Ueda managed the Fund from Japan. From 2009 to 2011, they managed the Fund in Singapore, and for that purpose, they incorporated in Singapore Hachiman Capital Management Private Limited (\u201cHCM Singapore\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of HCM.', '4\\u2003Mr Bajaj and Mr Ueda were also directors and equal shareholders in TY Advisors, which was incorporated in the Cayman Islands. From 2004 to 2009, when the Fund was managed in Japan, the business activities were conducted through TY Advisors Japan, a branch of TY Advisors registered in Japan. TY Advisors Japan provided sub-advisory services to HCM to run the Fund.', '5\\u2003Tricor Singapore Pte Ltd (\u201cTricor\u201d), an unrelated company, provided services, including book keeping and running a trust account, for HCM Singapore. Kaneyama & Associates (\u201cKaneyama\u201d), also an unrelated company, handled the financial records of TY Advisors Japan and managed a trust account for it.', '6\\u2003In September 2010, the parties decided to close the business of the Fund, and they entered into an agreement on the division of the business assets. Unfortunately, they could not agree on some subsequent transactions and business decisions as well as the nature and scope of their agreement. In the midst of the dispute, Mr Bajaj resigned as a director of the TY entities in March 2011 and also resigned as a director of the HCM entities in May 2011.', '7\\u2003In March 2013, Mr Ueda commenced a suit against Mr Bajaj and Mr Bajaj in turn filed a counterclaim. Eventually, the parties brought the litigation to an end by entering into a settlement agreement on 19 August 2014 (the \u201cSettlement Agreement\u201d). By the Settlement Agreement, the parties agreed that a neutral evaluation of the assets by an independent accountant (\u201cthe assessor\u201d) be undertaken. It was also agreed that the assessor\u2019s calculations would be final and binding. The important terms of the Settlement Agreement were the following:', '8\\u2003It was clear from the wording of the Settlement Agreement that the assessor was directed to calculate the value of each party\u2019s share of HCM as at the end of 2011 on the sub-portfolio basis (Table X) and on the 50\/50 basis (Table Y). Tables X and Y were included in the Settlement Agreement. The tables included inputs such as the Net Asset Value (\u201cNAV\u201d) of HCM as at 31 December 2010, the trading loss and the effect of certain specified transactions, to arrive at the final position at the end of 2011. The settlement amount was to be the value of Mr Bajaj\u2019s share of HCM at the end of 2011, taken to be the average of the value of his share based on the sub-portfolio basis and the value based on the 50\/50 basis (\u201cthe Settlement Amount\u201d). The Settlement Agreement provided that if the Settlement Amount was a negative sum, Mr Bajaj was to make payment of the sum to Mr Ueda, and vice versa if the Settlement Amount was a positive sum.', '9\\u2003On 4 November 2014, the parties signed a neutral evaluation agreement (the \u201cNeutral Evaluation Agreement\u201d), by which they consented to the appointment of Mr Sajjad Akhtar as the \u201cNeutral\u201d to provide the required neutral evaluation service. It was not disputed that this amounted to appointing Mr Akhtar as the assessor under the Settlement Agreement. The parties agreed to a \u201cDocuments-only Neutral Evaluation\u201d to be governed by the Singapore Mediation Centre (\u201cSMC\u201d) Neutral Evaluation Rules (the \u201cEvaluation Rules\u201d).', '10\\u2003The assessor only managed to finish his evaluation report (the \u201cEvaluation Report\u201d) in November 2017. An amendment was released on 14 March 2018 to correct a typographical error. Evidently, there was a very long delay in the neutral evaluation process, and this delay was due mostly, if not entirely, to Mr Bajaj\u2019s conduct. As counsel for Mr Bajaj, Mr Jaikanth Shankar, acknowledged on appeal, his client could have behaved better. The delay was traced by the assessor in Annexure 1 to the Evaluation Report.', '11\\u2003The case statements of the parties were submitted to the assessor in January 2015 and the replies were submitted by early February 2015. Mr Ueda submitted documents comprising various transaction records, bank statements from 2011 and management accounts provided by Tricor. In view of the complexity surrounding the submission of the documents, the assessor arranged a clarification hearing in April 2015. Mr Ueda duly attended the hearing but Mr Bajaj did not show up. Mr Bajaj claimed that he was overseas and did not receive any email notification, even though he had earlier agreed to the hearing date. The assessor expressed doubts about the genuineness of his claims. That was the beginning of Mr Bajaj\u2019s delaying tactics.', '12\\u2003The assessor attempted to arrange a separate meeting with Mr Bajaj, and this attempt lasted from April to October 2015 because of Mr Bajaj\u2019s various delays in responding. The assessor emailed the parties in October 2015 indicating that given the lack of response from Mr Bajaj and his refusal to provide reasonable alternative dates to attend a clarification hearing, he would issue his opinion on the documents submitted to date. Mr Bajaj was quick to lodge his objection the next day, stating that he would not accept the opinion without being given a chance to be heard. In subsequent emails, he alleged that the assessor was biased, and declined to accept him as the assessor on the ground that he was allegedly not given an opportunity by the assessor to be heard. The assessor attempted again to schedule a hearing for Mr Bajaj, but again to no avail. Mr Bajaj continued alleging bias on the part of the assessor. On 16 November 2015, the assessor gave Mr Bajaj a final opportunity to be heard before the assessor issued his report. Instead, Mr Bajaj proposed that the assessor be replaced or the matter be referred back to the mediator. However, the SMC and Mr Ueda rejected his proposals.', '13\\u2003Mr Bajaj finally attended the clarification hearing on 25 November 2015. He raised queries in relation to the accounts and documents submitted by Mr Ueda and also added that he had no access to the documents of HCM as they were in the possession and control of Mr Ueda. At this point, and for the first time, Mr Bajaj expressed a concern that the accounting records did not reflect a loan given by HCM to TY Advisors Japan. In his affidavit filed in the court below, Mr Bajaj explained that 50 million Yen was transferred from HCM to TY Advisors Japan, out of which 35 million Yen should still be in the accounts of TY Advisors Japan after part of the loan was used for the latter\u2019s liquidation. Mr Bajaj wanted an account of this 35 million Yen and specifically queried whether it was transferred back to HCM. To address the concerns, in January 2016, the assessor visited Tricor and performed a limited review of the documents of HCM. He reported back to the parties in February 2016, and provided a detailed breakdown of the loan from HCM to TY Advisors Japan and the repayment thereof.', '14\\u2003Mr Bajaj remained unhappy with his lack of access to the documents. He wanted to communicate with Mr Kaneyama (of Kaneyama) in connection with TY Advisors Japan to obtain confirmation of an account of transactions resulting in balances due from TY Advisors to HCM. The parties continued to argue over email until Mr Ueda finally relented and agreed to provide access to Mr Bajaj in respect of the requested documents. In June 2016, Mr Ueda authorised Tricor and Mr Kaneyama to release the relevant documents to Mr Bajaj. Tricor forwarded the requested documents to Mr Bajaj in August 2016. Mr Bajaj said that he never received any response from Mr Kaneyama.', '15\\u2003Mr Bajaj then insisted that he wanted to see the original documents from Cayman National Bank. However, Mr Ueda explained that he did not have any original bank statements. It was also undisputed that the bank account was dormant and needed to be reactivated before the original statements could be retrieved. In September 2016, the SMC attempted to arrange a meeting between the assessor and the parties, but without success. In November 2016, the SMC again attempted to arrange a meeting between the assessor, the mediator and the parties. Mr Bajaj refused to attend the meeting unless he received the documents kept with Kaneyama and the Cayman National Bank. In the same email, Mr Bajaj also raised a new issue for the first time: he alleged that HCM Singapore was wound up by Mr Ueda in 2014 without his consent and that funds in HCM Singapore were sequestered by Mr Ueda through the winding up (the \u201cWinding Up Issues\u201d). Mr Bajaj continued to make these allegations against Mr Ueda over the next few months.', '16\\u2003From December 2016 to April 2017, Mr Bajaj continued to pursue his points of contention, namely access to documents from Cayman National Bank and Mr Kaneyama, and the Winding Up Issues. Mr Ueda rebutted the Winding Up Issues while acknowledging that Mr Bajaj was free to present his allegations in an appropriate forum.', '17\\u2003In May 2017, the assessor suggested that the parties return to mediation. Mr Ueda was not agreeable to mediation, while this time, Mr Bajaj agreed to go back to mediation because in his view, no assessment could be made based on the false data submitted by Mr Ueda. Mr Bajaj listed various issues of contention in support of his claim that the data was false. In response to those contentions, the assessor replied, stating that the only relevant dispute was with regard to a sum of approximately 4.9 million Yen in the funds of TY Advisors that was allegedly not accounted for, and that the Winding Up Issues were irrelevant to his scope of work because the winding up occurred after 2011.', '18\\u2003Mr Ueda responded to the dispute over the 4.9 million Yen held in the funds of TY Advisors, and explained that there was no need to account for the sum in HCM\u2019s accounts because TY Advisors was neither a parent company nor a subsidiary of HCM. Subsequently, the assessor wrote to Tricor for the transactions between HCM and TY Advisors. Tricor confirmed that it did not have any agreement or invoices in support. The assessor duly informed the parties of this.', '19\\u2003Although the assessor explained again to the parties that the Winding Up Issues were outside the scope of his terms of reference, Mr Bajaj continued to allege that the data in the hands of the assessor was false and wanted to contact the mediator on the Winding Up Issues. The assessor did not hear further from Mr Bajaj on any discussion he had with the mediator. Thus, he decided to issue \u201ca qualified opinion\u201d. Mr Ueda paid Mr Bajaj\u2019s share of the fees in order to procure the release of the Evaluation Report.', '20\\u2003 The Evaluation Report was at the crux of the current appeal. Mr Bajaj\u2019s position was that because the valuations in the Evaluation Report were qualified, there was no accrued debt which he had to pay to Mr Ueda.', '21\\u2003The assessor noted in the Evaluation Report that it was unfortunate that the important matter of the underlying documentation was not addressed in the Settlement Agreement. After setting out the long-drawn process of the evaluation, he opined that it was \u201capparent that any further attempts to get Parties\u2019 agreement on the underlying documents and Financial Statements to be used by NE [ie, the assessor] for populating Table X and Table Y [were] futile\u201d, and the \u201conly possible alternative [was] for the Parties to jointly appoint an Independent Auditor to audit the Financial Statements of HCM\u201d. Thus, he proceeded \u201cto prepare [his] report with appropriate qualifications as per Rule 10.5 of SMC\u2019s Neutral Evaluation Rules\u201d.', '22\\u2003More pertinently, the assessor stated that he was \u201cunable to wholly carry out the terms of reference of [his] appointment\u201d [emphasis added], due to the various disagreements between the parties. While Mr Ueda presented the NAV as extracted from the accounts prepared by Tricor, Mr Bajaj refused to accept the NAV on the ground that he had been denied access to the underlying source documents and information. The assessor stated that this was \u201ca fundamental issue which Parties should have dealt with either a) prior to entering into the Settlement Agreement, or b) by providing a procedure in the Settlement Agreement as to how the NAV at end 2010 was to be determined\u201d. The assessor was of the view that it was not his role to perform an audit of HCM in order to derive the NAV as at 31 December 2010 or for the year ended 31 December 2011, especially because Tables X and Y in the Settlement Agreement stated that audited accounts of HCM were excluded from the documents the assessor would have access to.', '23\\u2003In the course of the evaluation process, the assessor stated that he had \u201cconsidered issuing an opinion on the basis of documents submitted by Mr. Ueda alone (as previously pointed out, Mr. Bajaj [had] not submitted any documents); but to do so would be inconsistent with the principle of natural justice\u201d. He opined that in order to enable the Settlement Agreement to be implemented, the parties \u201cmust adopt either of the following\u201d: (a) take the dispute back to mediation to come to an agreement on the issue of the documents to be used to determine the NAV and the Settlement Amount; or (b) appoint an independent auditor to perform an audit of the financial statements of HCM for 2010 and 2011.', '24\\u2003The assessor then proceeded to give his qualified opinion as follows:', '25\\u2003Subsequently, an amendment was released in March 2018 to correct \u201cthe typographical error in the Currency of settlement amount\u201d. In doing so, a few changes in wording were also made to para 31 of the Evaluation Report. The amended paragraph read as follows (the changes in wording are underlined):', '26\\u2003Counsel for Mr Bajaj and Mr Ueda did not place any emphasis on the changes in the wording made in the amendment. The changes in the wording were inconsequential because they did not change the meaning of para 31 of the Evaluation Report.', '27\\u2003Following the issuance of the Evaluation Report, Mr Ueda\u2019s solicitors wrote to Mr Bajaj on 9 April 2018 demanding payment of sums due under the Settlement Agreement. Mr Bajaj ignored the demand. Accordingly, on 17 April 2018, Mr Ueda served a statutory demand (the \u201cStatutory Demand\u201d) on Mr Bajaj demanding payment of the following debts:', '(a)\\u2003debt of US$50,000 pursuant to cl 10 of the Settlement Agreement (the \u201cClause 10 Sum\u201d);', '(b)\\u2003Settlement Amount of US$226,481.92 pursuant to cl 3 of the Settlement Agreement; and', '(c)\\u2003Mr Bajaj\u2019s share of the fees under cl 6 of the Settlement Agreement, being S$32,399.60 (the \u201cClause 6 Sum\u201d).'"}
{"casename":"2019_SGCA_7","fact":"'8\\u2003Having stated the gist of the dispute, we now set out the facts more fully. The appellant is a Singapore-incorporated company in the business of dealing in luxury yachts. At the material time, the appellant dealt in yachts produced by Azimut, a company incorporated in Italy. Peter Mison (\u201cMison\u201d) was a yacht broker for the appellant, based in Singapore. Paul Grange (\u201cGrange\u201d) was the appellant\u2019s Group Sales Manager and the brand representative for Azimut. Giordano Pellacani (\u201cPellacani\u201d) was Azimut\u2019s Sales Manager for Asia.', '9\\u2003Jiaravanon was a male Indonesian national. He passed away at the age of 40 in 2015, after commencing the suit below. At the time of his death, he was the Vice President Commissioner of PT Charoen Pokphand Indonesia TBK, which formed part of the Charoen Pokphand Group Indonesia (\u201cCP Group\u201d). He was informally known as \u201cChip\u201d or \u201cCip\u201d, as reflected in some of the correspondence discussed below. Jiaravanon\u2019s widow, Anita, has conduct of the proceedings as administratrix of Jiaravanon\u2019s estate. In his dealings with the appellant, Jiaravanon was assisted by Aina Taslim (\u201cTaslim\u201d), the Head of Purchasing (Commercial Division) of the CP Group.', '10\\u2003The parties\u2019 dealings began in January 2013, when Jiaravanon and Taslim met Mison as Jiaravanon was thinking of purchasing at least one yacht for use in Hong Kong or Southeast Asia. Jiaravanon initially decided to purchase an Azimut 62S but did not proceed with the purchase. On 28 February 2013, Jiaravanon informed Mison that he was considering a yacht in Azimut\u2019s 100-ft range. He was interested in either the Azimut 100L or 100G, whichever was available for an early delivery date and purchasable at a good price.', '11\\u2003On 11 April 2013, Mison informed Jiaravanon that Azimut had only two yachts, one 100L and one 100G, available for delivery within the year. He recommended that Jiaravanon place a deposit to hold both boats until Jiaravanon made a trip to Italy to decide which of the two models he preferred.', '12\\u2003On 26 April 2013, Mison met Jiaravanon at Jiaravanon\u2019s house. It is undisputed that on this occasion, Jiaravanon signed the following documents:', '(a)\\u2003A contract to purchase an Azimut 64 yacht (hull number 68) (\u201cthe Azimut 64 yacht\u201d) for \u20ac1,916,675 (\u201cthe Azimut 64 Contract\u201d) from the appellant. The claims in relation to this contract are not the subject of this appeal.', '(b)\\u2003An invoice (\u201cthe Deposit Invoice\u201d) for the payment of the sum of \u20ac1m (that is, the Deposit) by Jiaravanon to the appellant. The Deposit Invoice states that the Deposit is a \u201cholding deposit\u201d against two boats: the 100G #12 and the 100L #15. As mentioned, these were specific yachts being produced in the 100G and 100L model lines, identifiable by their hull numbers. They were already in production and were available for early delivery. The terms of the Deposit Invoice state that the Deposit is to \u201csecure both yachts until 15th May 2013 at which time the deposit will be transferred to either yacht to become the initial down payment\u201d.', '13\\u2003On 29 April 2013, one of Jiaravanon\u2019s assistants sent Mison a text message to say that Jiaravanon \u201cwould like to remit the Euro1,000,000. \u2013 for deposit of either 100Leornardo [sic] or Grande\u201d. She also sought clarification about the discount available on both boats. Mison explained that the pricing deal he offered on the 100G #12 was limited to this exact hull number. However, Mison said that Jiaravanon had \u201cagreed that if he misses [the 100G #12] [because it is sold before he places a deposit on it] he could accept [the 100G #15] which is able to ship out in December\u201d. Mison also highlighted that \u201cAzimut will only hold the 2 x 100\u2019s for [Jiaravanon] to choose from until May 15th.\u201d Mison forwarded the contents of his message to Jiaravanon via email.', '14\\u2003On 29 April 2013, Jiaravanon paid the Deposit to the appellant. A receipt was issued by the appellant on 30 April 2013. However, it transpired that one of the boats that the Deposit was meant to secure, the 100G #12, had been sold to a Mexican buyer on 27 or 28 April 2013.', '15\\u2003On 30 April 2013, Mison informed Jiaravanon that Azimut had already sold the 100G #12. Mison suggested that Jiaravanon consider the 100G #15 instead, which he said was available to be shipped out in November or December. At the same time, Mison noted that the \u201c100 Leonardo is now reserved for [him] if [he would] prefer to go that way\u201d.', '16\\u2003On 4 May 2013, Jiaravanon informed Mison in a text message that he now planned to get only one boat first and instructed him not to send the Deposit to Azimut for the boats in the Azimut 100-ft series. He said:', '17\\u2003Mison replied to say that he \u201cwill stop the transfer of the 100 deposit and return it to [Jiaravanon] right away\u201d. He reiterated his suggestion that Jiaravanon travel to Italy to view the boats. He also explained why he thought that the \u201c100 #15\u201d was a good choice for Jiaravanon.', '18\\u2003By 6 May 2013, it appears that Jiaravanon was once again considering the purchase of a 100-ft yacht because he was making plans to travel to Hong Kong to view an Azimut 100L that was docked there for another client. On 6 May 2013, Mison emailed Jiaravanon and Anita to send them technical specifications for various boat models that Jiaravanon was still considering: the 72S, 100L and 100G models. As regards the Deposit, Mison said as follows:', '19\\u2003Two days later, on 8 May 2013, Jiaravanon met Grange and Pellacani in Hong Kong and viewed an Azimut 100L yacht. The parties dispute what was agreed during this meeting. The appellant contends that Jiaravanon agreed that the Deposit should be paid to Azimut as a non-refundable deposit to reserve the 100L #15 and the 100G #15 until 31 May 2013 in order for Jiaravanon to choose between them. Jiaravanon denies that any such agreement was reached.', '20\\u2003On 9 May 2013, the appellant forwarded the Deposit to Azimut. The remittance record states as follows:', '21\\u2003On 27 May 2013, Mison sent Jiaravanon an email urging him to obtain an Italian visa so that he could make a trip to view the Azimut 100-ft boats in Italy and choose between the 100L and 100G models. This was evidently a matter of urgency from Mison\u2019s perspective, as he said:', '22\\u2003On 29 May 2013, Mison informed Jiaravanon that Azimut had agreed to \u201chold the two Azimut 100\u2019s until this Friday the 31st\u201d but that Mison had asked for an extension until 7 June 2013. Mison also inquired if Jiaravanon was prepared to make a choice between the boats being held for him without making a trip to Italy, so that he would not miss out on his preferred model.', '23\\u2003On 31 May 2013, apparently the last day that the 100L #15 and 100G #15 would be reserved against the Deposit (as the appellant claims), Mison wrote to Jiaravanon as follows:', '24\\u2003Four days later, Mison again asked if Jiaravanon was still planning to visit Azimut in Italy on 17 or 18 June as earlier planned, and asked when he could decide between the two models if he did not make a trip to Italy. He also inquired if Azimut could be released from holding the 100L for him and sell it to someone else, since he seemed to be leaning towards the 100G.', '25\\u2003It is unclear what transpired over the course of June 2013, but on 7 July 2013, Jiaravanon sent Mison a text message stating that he no longer wished to purchase a 100-ft yacht from the appellant.', '26\\u2003On 31 July 2013, Jiaravanon met Mison. According to Mison\u2019s text message to Taslim after the meeting, Jiaravanon and Mison agreed as a \u201ccompromise\u201d that half of the Deposit would be applied to the purchase price of the Azimut 64 yacht (see [12(a)] above) (\u201cCompromise Agreement\u201d), while the other half would be applied to the purchase of either an Azimut 100L or an Azimut 76 yacht.', '27\\u2003The next day, the appellant issued a revised payment invoice for the Azimut 64 yacht purchased under the Azimut 64 Contract. This invoice reflected the Compromise Agreement in its calculation of the balance payable for the Azimut 64 yacht. Mison explained the new position in the following terms in an email to Jiaravanon\u2019s assistant in which Jiaravanon was copied:', '28\\u2003In August 2013, Jiaravanon demanded the return of the Remainder in three emails dated 11, 12 and 28 August 2013. On 11 August 2013, Jiaravanon wrote to Mison:', '29\\u2003He reiterated on 12 August 2013 that \u201cI want my deposit back! And I am saying RIGHT AWAY.\u201d Notwithstanding these misgivings, it appears that Jiaravanon met with the appellant\u2019s representatives in Hong Kong on 13 August 2013 to view a 100G-model yacht. By 28 August 2013, Jiaravanon had decided that he was not buying a 100G yacht and demanded that the Remainder be returned:', '30\\u2003On 30 August 2013, Mison informed Jiaravanon that he had forwarded Jiaravanon\u2019s request for the return of the Remainder to the appellant\u2019s head office in Hong Kong. In this email, Mison stated that the Deposit \u201cwas given to Azimut to put a hold [on] two Azimut 100\u2019s for [Jiaravanon] until [he] had selected which one [he] preferred\u201d.', '31\\u2003Grange responded to Jiaravanon on 3 September 2013, explaining that \u201c[a]s agreed at the time, [his] deposit was forwarded in full to Azimut to reserve [his] choice of either the Leonardo 100-15 or Grande 100-15\u201d. Grange said that he had notified Azimut of Jiaravanon\u2019s request to have the deposit returned. Jiaravanon did not respond.', '32\\u2003On 9 September 2013, Mison explained the situation concerning the deposit to Taslim, noting that Jiaravanon had agreed to transfer the Deposit to Azimut when he met with Grange and Pellacani to view the Azimut 100L in Hong Kong:', '33\\u2003Between November 2013 and August 2014, there were further discussions between Jiaravanon and the appellant\u2019s representatives because Jiaravanon wished to return the Azimut 64 yacht he had purchased. Jiaravanon sought to apply the price paid for the Azimut 64 yacht and the Remainder to the purchase of yet another yacht, initially an Azimut 70 and later an Azimut 77S. In the end, Jiaravanon did not purchase a second yacht from Azimut.', '34\\u2003On 15 August 2014, Jiaravanon commenced the suit below to seek, among other things, the restitution of the Remainder.'"}
{"casename":"2019_SGCA_70","fact":"'6\\u2003The bulk of the applicant\u2019s pending charges relate directly to his involvement in a fraud pertaining to the PIC Scheme. The PIC Scheme is a government subsidy open to all qualifying Singapore-registered companies to improve productivity using IT and automation equipment. According to the Prosecution\u2019s case against the applicant, the applicant conspired with others to submit false PIC claims to IRAS on behalf of various companies, on the basis that these companies had incurred the qualifying expenditure. In fact, the purported expenditure had not been incurred, and the documents were in respect of sham purchases of goods and services. To carry out the fraud, the applicant allegedly also forged Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (\u201cACRA\u201d) business profiles by amending the names of the directors reflected on the business profiles. Based on these fraudulent acts, IRAS was deceived into disbursing a total of $5.56m to 71 companies in response to some of these PIC claims. These moneys were then transferred to the applicant\u2019s bank account, and out of this, he allegedly received a total of more than $1.14m. Further, there were 84 other false PIC claims filed on behalf of 58 other companies for which IRAS did not pay out the claims, and the amount in respect of these claims would have totalled $4.36m.', '7\\u2003For his alleged involvement in the PIC Scheme fraud, the applicant faces more than 400 charges of abetment by instigation or conspiracy to cheat under s 420 read with ss 109 and 116 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe Penal Code\u201d). Approximately half of these are against the applicant alone (\u201cthe individual cheating charges\u201d) while most of the rest are faced by the applicant jointly with two co-accused persons, Li Dan and Wang Jiao (\u201cthe joint cheating charges\u201d). In addition, the applicant also faces eight forgery charges under s 474 read with s 466 of the Penal Code for possessing forged ACRA business profiles (\u201cthe forgery charges\u201d), as well as not less than 23 charges under s 47(1)(c) of the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (Cap 65A, 2000 Rev Ed) (\u201cCDSA\u201d) for his receipt of approximately $1.14m from the false PIC applications (\u201cthe CDSA charges\u201d).', '8\\u2003Investigations into the applicant\u2019s involvement began on 5 October 2016 and the applicant was first charged in court on 11 November 2016, which is also the date on which he was first placed in remand. In addition to the charges associated with the PIC fraud, the applicant had also been charged under s 204A of the Penal Code with tampering with or attempting to tamper with seven witnesses. In relation to each of the latter charges, the applicant had instructed his associates to falsely inform investigators from the Commercial Affairs Department (\u201cCAD\u201d) that a Chinese national, known as Wu Hai Jun, was involved in the fraudulent PIC applications. This was done in order to mask the applicant\u2019s own involvement in the scheme. The applicant was also found to have bribed one of his associates with a payment of $3,000 to furnish false information to the CAD. The applicant was tried on four of the seven witness tampering charges and the trial was held on various dates between August 2017 and May 2018. He was convicted of the four charges on 7 September 2018 and was sentenced on 16 January 2019 to 40 months\u2019 imprisonment, with the sentence backdated to his date of remand, 11 November 2016. He would have been eligible for release on 31 January 2019, but the applicant has remained in remand for the pending charges in relation to the PIC fraud, as well as the three remaining witness tampering charges.', '9\\u2003Shortly after the applicant\u2019s conviction on and the pronouncement of sentence for the four witness tampering charges, on 24 January 2019, the Prosecution served its case for the applicant\u2019s individual cheating charges, as well as the forgery charges and the CDSA charges. The Prosecution also indicated that it would proceed against the applicant for the joint cheating charges together with the co-accused persons, Li Dan and Wang Jiao, in a separate trial, and that the joint cheating charges would accordingly be stood down for the time being. The applicant took issue with this, arguing essentially that it was unfair for him to be tried \u201cby instalments\u201d given that the investigation for all the pending charges had been completed. The Prosecution did not give any reasons for its decision to proceed in this manner when it served its case or at any time prior to the hearing of the present motion on 22 August 2019. At that hearing, we were informed that there were material differences between the applicant\u2019s individual cheating charges and the joint cheating charges. We were told that while these arose out of similar circumstances, they were not part of a single continuing scheme. It was submitted on this basis that it would be inappropriate to proceed with all 400 charges at one trial.', '10\\u2003At the time this application was heard, the applicant\u2019s joint cheating charges and the three remaining witness tampering charges were still stood down. However, the applicant has since informed us that the Prosecution had on 19 September 2019 applied to proceed with the joint cheating charges concurrently with the applicant\u2019s individual cheating charges. In other words, with the exception of the three remaining witness tampering charges which remain stood down, all of the pending charges against the applicant are being proceeded with in two ongoing and concurrent trials. We discuss the implications of this development on our decision at [37] below.'"}

At the event, Faber\u2019s representatives and salespersons approached potential investors with a view to marketing the investment.

They wanted to obtain confirmation of the representations Ms Seah had made, and to seek Mr Sim\u2019s assurance that all necessary due diligence checks for the Project had been performed. Mr Haw also wanted to speak with Mr Sim about the Project as he was concerned that Ms Seah, being a salesperson, might subsequently leave Faber whilst the Project was ongoing whereas it was less likely that the KEO would do so.', '12\\u2003At the respondents\u2019 meeting with Mr Sim, Mdm Yee told him that she herself was a real estate salesperson and asked whether she could receive a co-broking commission if she found other persons to invest in the FRR scheme.

He, however, averred that the details of the due diligence checks conducted were not included in his representation.', '14\\u2003The respondents\u2019 case was that in reliance on Representations 1 to 6, they entered into various agreements with the Developer that same day to obtain the FRR for three units in the Project. The respondents had to pay S$15,000 as reservation deposit and US$142,656.76 as the balance of the FRR price for the three units. In DC 3237, the respondents sought the return of those sums.', '15\\u2003The fact of the matter was that, amongst other things, the Developer had neither the title nor the resource consent required to develop the relevant plot of land on which the Project was supposed to be constructed.

The following facts are stated in a 19-page Agreed Statement of Facts which counsel for Moad Fadzir, counsel for Zuraimy and the Prosecution agreed upon.', '6\\u2003On the night of 11 April 2016, Moad Fadzir received a phone call from someone known to him as \u201cAbang\u201d while he was in a night class at Singapore Polytechnic. After the night class at about 10pm, Moad Fadzir went to meet Zuraimy at Block 1 Holland Close. He then drove a car to Block 157 Toa Payoh with Zuraimy in the front passenger seat. After the car was parked at the loading\/unloading bay there, an unknown Indian man walked to the driver\u2019s side and threw a white plastic bag through the front window and it landed on Moad Fadzir\u2019s lap. Moad Fadzir passed the white plastic bag to Zuraimy who tied it. The white plastic bag was subsequently placed in Moad Fadzir\u2019s black helmet sling bag (\u201cblack bag\u201d) in the car.', '7\\u2003Moad Fadzir then drove Zuraimy back to Block 1 Holland Close. At about 11.41pm, Zuraimy alighted along Commonwealth Avenue West and walked towards Block 1 Holland Close. Moad Fadzir then drove the car, with the black bag inside, to his residence at Block 623 Woodlands Drive 52.', '8\\u2003Unknown to both accused persons, Central Narcotics Bureau (\u201cCNB\u201d) officers were in the vicinity of Block 156A Toa Payoh Lorong 1 looking out for them. The CNB officers saw Moad Fadzir\u2019s car arriving and then leaving the location shortly thereafter. They followed Moad Fadzir\u2019s car as it proceeded to Holland Close. When Zuraimy alighted and walked towards Block 1 Holland Close, a team of CNB officers tailed him there. Another team of CNB officers continued to monitor and follow Moad Fadzir\u2019s car to Block 623 Woodlands Drive 52. There, he stopped and remained in the car for about seven minutes. When he alighted from the car at around 12.15am on 12 April 2016, the CNB officers moved in and arrested him. Zuraimy was arrested by CNB officers separately later in the morning of 12 April 2016 when he came down from his residence.', '9\\u2003When Moad Fadzir was arrested, he was carrying the black bag from the car. Inside the white plastic bag was a red plastic bag containing four bundles wrapped in black tape. These \u201cfour black bundles\u201d were the four packets of granular substances mentioned in the respective charges. During his arrest, some items fell from his body to the ground. Among these were a packet of granular substance, a Sampoerna cigarette box, a packet of crystalline substance, a stained straw and a packet containing two yellow tablets and some tablet fragments. After his arrest, he was brought up to his residence. Inside the flat, the CNB officers found one packet of granular substance from the drawer of the table in his bedroom and a digital weighing scale on his bed. A search conducted on the car that he was driving found nothing incriminating.', '10\\u2003Investigations continued with Senior Station Inspector (\u201cSSI\u201d) Tony Ng from the CNB recording a contemporaneous statement (\u201cP84\u201d) from Moad Fadzir inside a CNB vehicle from about 1.35am to 2.35am.

Dr Huang\u2019s clinical notes indicated that the mole had no change for years.', '22\\u2003Sometime in September 2009, Mr Traynor noticed a bloodstain on his shirt while he was changing. On 12 September 2009, Mr Traynor consulted Dr Huang again. This time, a procedure known as a \u201cshave biopsy\u201d was performed on the mole, which removed the portion of the mole on the skin. The biopsied specimen was sent to the 1st Respondent, Quest, for an examination and preparation of a pathology report. It is undisputed that this mole was the \u201cprimary tumour\u201d (ie, where all the melanoma originated from).', '23\\u2003It is this specimen from September 2009 that was the critical focus in the trial below. The 2nd Respondent, Dr Tan, a consultant pathologist from Quest, testified that the practice would have been to embed the specimen into a paraffin block. The block would be thinly sliced into cross sections and placed onto a single glass slide. On 14 September 2009, Dr Tan was given four thinly sliced and stained tissue sections of the specimen in a glass slide (\u201cthe original slide\u201d) for examination under microscopy. The original slide was accompanied by a clinical request form from Dr Huang.', '24\\u2003After examining the original slide, Dr Tan issued a pathology report (\u201cthe 2009 pathology report\u201d). In his pathology report, Dr Tan described the relevant findings as follows:', '25\\u2003The 2009 pathology report was sent to Dr Huang on 16 September 2009. The Appellant stated that Mr Traynor had received a copy of the report, and was advised on its contents by Dr Huang. They understood the 2009 pathology report to mean that the mole was not cancerous. It does not appear that any further action was taken by Mr Traynor.', '26\\u2003Some two years later, around Christmas in 2011, Mr Traynor discovered a lump under his right armpit while getting dressed. Mr Traynor consulted another general practitioner, and was recommended to undergo a biopsy. On 6 January 2012, Mr Traynor underwent a Computed Tomography (\u201cCT\u201d) scan, a core biopsy, and a Positron Emission Tomography (\u201cPET\u201d) scan. The biopsy revealed that the lymph nodes under Mr Traynor\u2019s armpits had metastatic melanoma. The CT scan showed adenopathy (ie, swelling) under Mr Traynor\u2019s right and left armpits, which was confirmed by the PET scan. However, the PET scan showed no definite evidence of distal metastasis (ie, cancer in the distant organs). Mr Traynor was placed on four rounds of chemotherapy, starting on 16 January 2012.', '27\\u2003On 9 April 2012, PET and CT scans continued to show stable lymphadenopathy (disease of the lymph nodes) and that distal metastasis was not detected. On 19 April 2012, Mr Traynor underwent a \u201cbilateral axillary clearance\u201d, ie, the removal of the right and left lymph nodes under the armpit. The removed lymph nodes were examined by a pathologist, Dr Fong Chee Meng (\u201cDr Fong\u201d). Dr Fong noted as follows:', '(a)\\u2003Four of the right lymph nodes contained metastatic melanoma. \u201c[O]ne [was] completely replaced by tumour while the remaining three show[ed] focal melanoma cells\u201d. The largest right lymph node measured 6cm x 4.5cm x 3.5cm; and', '(b)\\u2003One of the left lymph nodes was \u201ccompletely replaced by metastatic melanoma with epithelioid and spindle morphology\u201d and measured 5cm x 3.5cm x 2cm.', '28\\u2003It is undisputed that the bilateral axillary clearance on 19 April 2012 had removed the lymph nodes and the melanoma there. Also on 19 April 2012, Mr Traynor underwent a \u201cwide excision\u201d of the primary site of the tumour, ie, a removal of the skin where the mole was to remove any residual disease there. The wide excision showed there was no residual tumour in the primary site.', '29\\u2003We pause to note that, at the trial, it was eventually undisputed that the shave biopsy in 2009 had removed the primary tumour from the primary site. Dr Nigel Kirkham (\u201cDr Kirkham\u201d), the expert pathologist for the Appellant, had confirmed that if there had been some primary tumour left, this would have continued growing in the nodule. However, since the 2012 wide excision showed no residual tumour, this must have meant that in 2009 all of the primary tumour had been removed.', '30\\u2003After the wide excision and bilateral axillary clearance procedures on 19 April 2012, Mr Traynor underwent adjuvant chemotherapy. CT and PET scans were performed for subsequent monitoring on 25 June and 8 November 2012, both of which showed no detectable melanoma. In April 2013, there was \u201csome suggestion that the cancer had relapse[d]. [But], this was not definite\u201d.', '31\\u2003On 30 August 2013, the PET and CT scans showed that there were nodule growths in Mr Traynor\u2019s body suspicious of metastatic deposits. On 2 September 2013, Mr Traynor was restarted on chemotherapy. On 14 October 2013, the PET and CT scans confirmed that distal metastasis had grown relative to the August 2013 scans in some regions.', '32\\u2003Mr Traynor subsequently passed away on 6 December 2013. The Appellant\u2019s expert oncologist, Professor William McCarthy (\u201cProf McCarthy\u201d), testified that when Mr Traynor passed away, he had about 30 metastatic nodules about 3mm in size throughout his body.', '33\\u2003Concurrently, a number of events were occurring which were relevant to the Breach Question. When the core biopsy on 6 January 2012 revealed metastatic melanoma in Mr Traynor\u2019s right axilla lymph node, the original slide from 2009 was recalled.', '34\\u2003On 30 January 2012, Dr Fong examined this original slide and issued the following findings (\u201cDr Fong\u2019s pathology report\u201d):', '35\\u2003Dr Tan stated that in February 2012, he learnt that Dr Huang had recalled the original slide from 2009. Upon hearing this, Dr Tan requested another slide containing deeper levels of the specimen from the paraffin block. Then, on 13 February 2012, Dr Tan issued a supplementary report (\u201cthe 2012 supplementary report\u201d) stating as follows:', '36\\u2003Dr Tan claimed that this 2012 diagnosis indicating \u201csuggestive of a melanoma\u201d was only apparent on hindsight and with the knowledge that Mr Traynor had had a recurrence.', '37\\u2003On 22 March 2012, a third opinion was sought from Professor Lee Yoke Sun (\u201cProf Lee\u201d) and Associate Professor Tan Hong Bing (\u201cA\/Prof Tan\u201d). They reviewed the original slide from 2009 in their report (\u201cProf Lee and A\/Prof Tan\u2019s pathology report\u201d) and commented as follows:', '38\\u2003The Appellant\u2019s expert pathologist, Dr Kirkham, was of the view that the specimen was \u201cconsistent with an invasive melanoma in vertical growth phase\u201d. In his view, the Respondents\u2019 2009 diagnosis that \u201c[t]here [was] no malignancy\u201d [emphasis added] was incorrect: \u201c[N]o competent pathologist would have taken the view that the skin biopsy showed an unequivocally benign lesion. At the very least suspicion of possible malignancy should have been raised and a further expert opinion sought\u201d.', '39\\u2003Even Dr Tan\u2019s own 2012 supplementary report, after he had obtained deeper levels of the same specimen from 2009, had diagnosed an \u201c[u]lcerated atypical melanocytic lesion, suggestive of a melanoma\u201d. It was Dr Kirkham\u2019s view that it was only this later report that correctly recognised the specimen was an ulcerated melanocytic lesion. Prof McCarthy similarly considered Dr Tan\u2019s 2012 supplementary report to be \u201cso different [from the 2009 pathology report] that the reports are virtually incompatible\u201d. Prof McCarthy was of the view that the later report where Dr Tan indicated the specimen was in fact an atypical melanocytic lesion was an acknowledgment by Dr Tan that his original 2009 pathology report was both inadequate and inaccurate.', '40\\u2003In contrast, the Respondents relied on the evidence of their expert pathologist, Dr Lee Siong See Joyce (\u201cDr Joyce Lee\u201d), that Dr Tan had performed a proper examination of the specimen in 2009. She considered that his diagnosis of \u201cno malignancy\u201d was \u201can interpretation that Dr Tan made in his professional judgment based on the combination of histopathological features that he saw \u2026 favouring a benign melanocytic nevus\u201d.', '41\\u2003Dr Joyce Lee acknowledged that the correct finding was one of malignant melanoma with ulceration. But she nevertheless claimed that a \u201cgood proportion of reasonable pathologists would fail to arrive at the correct findings of malignant melanoma\u201d because of the specimen\u2019s intrinsic limitations as a shave biopsy. Dr Joyce Lee claimed that the shave biopsy which had been performed in September 2009 was a \u201csub-optimal\u201d biopsy (as compared to a more complete wide excision). She claimed that \u201cfurther interpretation was hindered by a \u201clack of full visualisation\u201d of the specimen\u201d.', '42\\u2003Dr Kirkham and Prof Joyce Lee issued a joint report (\u201cthe joint report\u201d) which stated that \u201c[u]lceration was extensive with only a small amount of residual epidermis present at the edge of the extensive ulcer\u201d, \u201c[s]ome of [the] cells appeared to be maturing towards the base of the lesion\u201d, \u201csome mild atypia was present\u201d and \u201cincreased cellularity\u201d was observed.', '43\\u2003The Judge rejected the Respondents\u2019 explanation that the original slide in 2009 could have indicated a benign Spitz naevus. He was persuaded by Dr Kirkham\u2019s evidence that this should have raised alarm bells as Mr Traynor was \u201ca 47-year old man. Spitz neavi are benign neavi seen in children\u201d (see the Judgment at [6]). We pause here to note that Mr Traynor was in fact 45 years old when he was first diagnosed by the Respondents, but this does not affect the essential point that the Judge was making, and that such information pertaining to Mr Traynor\u2019s age was in fact available to the Respondents in the accompanying information to the specimen sent to them in 2009.', '44\\u2003The Judge considered that, even accepting Dr Joyce Lee\u2019s evidence that the original slide in 2009 had insufficient features to indicate melanoma, it was clear that the slide did not present a normal, healthy cell. In this regard, Dr Tan himself had acknowledged in cross-examination that he had noticed ulceration and a lack of epidermis. The Judge was of the view that Dr Tan ought to have investigated further and that the Respondents had \u201cdeeper, clearer portions [of the specimen] with [them] at the time\u201d. Once a further check was done, the Respondents would have reached the accurate diagnosis that the specimen was suggestive of melanoma, and which Dr Tan did in fact reach in 2012 (see the Judgment at [6]).', '45\\u2003The learned Judge stated that \u201cno clever twisting and turning around\u201d the tests in Bolam v Friern Hospital Management Committee [1957] 1 WLR 582 (\u201cBolam\u201d) and Bolitho v City and Hackney Health Authority [1998] 1 AC 232 (\u201cBolitho\u201d) was \u201cof any use\u201d (see the Judgment at [8]).

We refer to the six ships as \u201cthe Vessels\u201d. 5', '11\\u2003Pursuant to its right to approve the supplier of the main engines, the first respondent entered into negotiations with the appellants. In the course of negotiations, the appellants provided to the first respondent and the shipbuilders various documents which contained representations concerning the engines\u2019 rate of fuel consumption. 6', '12\\u2003Subsequently, the first respondent chose the appellants\u2019 engines for installation in the Vessels. Between May 2001 and June 2002, as and when an engine was ready to be handed over by the first appellant to the shipbuilders, the first appellant would conduct a field acceptance test (\u201cFAT\u201d) at its factory in Germany. The purpose of the FATs were to, inter alia, verify the fuel consumption values of the engines. 7', '13\\u2003Close to ten years later, in May 2011, the first appellant issued a press release stating that there were indications of possible irregularities in the FATs (\u201cthe May 2011 Press Release\u201d). Specifically, the results of the fuel consumption measurement could have been internally manipulated. 8', 'Following investigations, the first appellant then informed the respondents that three of the six engines supplied to the Vessels could have been affected by the irregularities.

Accordingly, the Judge held that the misrepresentation of the engines\u2019 rate of fuel consumption was made in Germany, received by the respondents in Germany and relied upon in Germany. Applying the substance test, Germany was the place of the tort (IM Skaugen SE and another v MAN Diesel & Turbo SE and another [2018] SGHC 123 (\u201cthe GD\u201d) at [104]).', '15\\u2003We observe that the Judge\u2019s finding that Germany is the place of the tort is not an issue before us.

Further, the respondents also acknowledge that they did not seek a stay of either the Norwegian or Singapore proceedings. Instead, they were content to let both proceedings progress.

The parties have exchanged pleadings and responded to disclosure requests in the Norwegian proceedings, and a hearing was scheduled to take place in October 2018. 21', 'While the hearing has not taken place due to some complications arising out of the first respondent\u2019s bankruptcy (which we set out at [163]\u2013[168] below), the point still remains that the Norwegian proceedings have reached a far more advanced stage than the Singapore proceedings.

Whilst he would collect larger quantities of diamorphine for Azman, Andi\u2019s assignments involving Rusli always involved one bundle of drugs, meaning that it would be below the capital threshold.', '3\\u2003On the morning of 22 August 2014, Rusli instructed Andi to make the necessary arrangements with someone, who was variously referred to as \u201cBala\u201d or \u201cBai\u201d, and to that end, he sent Andi that person\u2019s mobile number. A series of calls were then exchanged between Andi and the person who was using that mobile number. Andi was instructed to meet in the vicinity of Block 716, Woodlands Avenue 7. He was also told to meet as soon as possible as \u201cBala\u201d or \u201cBai\u201d had a urine test to attend that same day.', '4\\u2003At about 9.45am, Andi drove his car to the agreed location. At about 10.30am, a male Indian carrying an orange plastic bag approached Andi\u2019s vehicle. He opened the front passenger door and placed the bag on the front passenger seat. During this handover, Andi testified that he had a good opportunity to observe the face of the male Indian. The male Indian was also observed by Central Narcotics Bureau (\u201cCNB\u201d) officers who were, acting on information received, conducting surveillance of the area.', '5\\u2003Shortly thereafter, Andi drove to Rusli\u2019s residence. At about 12.45pm, Andi and Rusli were arrested. The orange bag was recovered from Andi\u2019s car and was found to contain two bundles containing not less than 14.60g and 14.46g of diamorphine, respectively. Various exhibits, which Rusli admitted were his, were also recovered from Rusli\u2019s car. Seven of these were found to contain in total not less than 6.02g of methamphetamine. Upon his arrest, Rusli\u2019s urine sample was taken and traces of morphine, a known metabolite of diamorphine, were found. In the contemporaneous statement that Andi made to the arresting officers, he was shown a board containing 13 photographs and among others, he identified a photograph of Akebal as the person who had earlier handed him the drugs.', '6\\u2003On the same day, at about 8.25pm, Akebal was arrested on suspicion of being the male Indian who had placed the orange bag in Andi\u2019s car. A mobile phone was found in Akebal\u2019s possession. The number of the mobile was the same as the number that Andi had been provided earlier in the day to contact \u201cBala\u201d or \u201cBai\u201d and to arrange the handover of the drugs. Subsequent investigations showed that multiple phone calls had been exchanged between the user of that mobile phone and Rusli and Andi on 22 August 2014.', '7\\u2003Akebal\u2019s defence in the court below was that he had been incorrectly identified, by CNB officers and Andi, as the man who placed the orange bag in Andi\u2019s car. The High Court Judge (\u201cthe Judge\u201d) rejected this defence. He was satisfied that the evidence identifying Akebal was of a good quality. As a result, the presumptions under ss 18(1)(a) and 18(2) of the MDA were triggered: Akebal was presumed to have had the drugs in his possession and to have known the nature of the drugs. Since Akebal did not adduce any evidence to rebut the presumptions, and since in delivering the drugs he had plainly trafficked, the Judge convicted him on the capital charge. Akebal was not issued a certificate of substantive assistance and the Judge passed the sentence of death accordingly.', '8\\u2003On the other hand, the Judge found that the Prosecution had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Rusli had knowledge of the nature of the drugs that were contained in both the packets. Rusli had maintained, and this was supported by Andi\u2019s evidence, that he only ever dealt with one bundle because of the risk of capital punishment. The Judge amended the charge against Rusli to one of instigating Andi to traffic in not less than 14.46g of diamorphine (being the amount of diamorphine in one packet of drugs) and convicted him accordingly. Rusli was sentenced to 27.5 years\u2019 imprisonment for this charge. The Prosecution also proceeded on two other charges against Rusli, to which he pled guilty (see [1(b)] above): an enhanced possession charge and a consumption charge. The Judge imposed a sentence of 2.5 years\u2019 and 12 months\u2019 imprisonment for these respective offences. He ordered the first two sentences to run consecutively and the last concurrently, resulting in an aggregate term of imprisonment of 30 years.', '9\\u2003 Akebal submits that the Judge erred in fact and law in regarding the identification evidence before him as being of a sufficiently good quality. At the hearing before us, counsel for Akebal, Mr Rupert Seah (\u201cMr Seah\u201d) also raised, for the first time, the possibility of a conspiracy involving Azman, Rusli and Andi to frame Akebal.', '10\\u2003As for Rusli, he contends that the sentence of 27.5 years\u2019 imprisonment imposed by the Judge for his amended trafficking charge is manifestly excessive. He also submits that the sentences for the amended trafficking charge and the enhanced possession charge should run concurrently, rather than consecutively.'"}

Sometime around the first quarter of 2012, Poh invited Chan and Tan to view her newly renovated premises at 25 Link Road (\u201cNo 25\u201d). Chan and Tan were impressed with the quality of the renovation work, and decided they wanted to do similar work at No 17. They asked Poh about the identity of the contractor who had done the renovations at No 25 and queried her on her experience with him. Poh expressed satisfaction with the contractor, Chong, and said she had no hesitation in recommending him. In April 2012, Poh introduced Chong to Chan and Tan. PEX eventually decided to engage Formcraft on the strength of Poh\u2019s recommendation and what they had observed when they visited No 25. 4', '11\\u2003In or around early May 2012, PEX engaged Formcraft to install a skylight canopy, skylight windows and ventilation globes around No 17 and to carry out minor repair works on the roof (\u201cthe First Job\u201d).

{"casename":"2019_SGCA_83","fact":"'4\\u2003As we mentioned at [1] above, the first appellant, SSA, is the national sports association for the sport of shooting. It is a registered charity under the Charities Act, a registered society under the Societies Act (Cap 311, 2014 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe Societies Act\u201d), and an Institution of Public Character. The respondent, SRA, is a founder member and constituent club of SSA, as is the Singapore Gun Club (\u201cSGC\u201d). SRA, too, is a registered society under the Societies Act.', '5\\u2003The Individual Defendants occupied key leadership roles in the SSA Council at the time of the material events in this dispute. The second appellant, Mr Michael Vaz Lorrain (\u201cMr Vaz\u201d), was the president of SSA; the third appellant, Mr Yap Beng Hui (\u201cMr Yap\u201d), was the secretary-general of SSA; and the fourth appellant, Mr Chen Sam Seong Patrick (\u201cMr Patrick Chen\u201d), was the treasurer of SSA. Each of the Individual Defendants was a volunteer in respect of his work with SSA. The three Individual Defendants and one Mr Peter Teh Kah Hoon (\u201cMr Peter Teh\u201d), one of SSA\u2019s vice-presidents, comprised the SSA Executive Committee, a smaller grouping within the SSA Council.', '6\\u2003The dispute is largely concerned with events that took place at the NSC. The NSC is a complex of shooting ranges at Old Choa Chu Kang Road used by various shooting clubs and associations in Singapore.', '7\\u2003The land on which the NSC stands is owned by the State. The State leased the land to the Singapore Sports Council, which was subsequently rebranded as Sport Singapore (\u201cSport SG\u201d). Sport SG in turn sub-leased the land to SSA. SSA was entitled to manage and operate the NSC. The tenancy agreement in force at the material time was entered into on 1 August 2015, but prior to that, a tenancy agreement on similar terms had been in force from 29 December 2008.', '8\\u2003SSA entered into a \u201cProprietary Range Agreement\u201d (\u201cthe Agreement\u201d) with SRA on 18 November 2014 for SRA to construct the Proprietary Range within a specified area of the NSC. The Proprietary Range would be for SRA\u2019s exclusive use, subject to certain conditions, and would be constructed at SRA\u2019s own expense.', '9\\u2003The area given over to SRA\u2019s use had in fact been used in the past as an operational shooting range, but it had fallen into disuse by the time the Agreement was entered into. There were therefore some pre-existing structures at the Proprietary Range. SRA decided to carry out reinstatement works, including the replacement and refurbishment of dilapidated trusses, bullet baffles, and the bullet stop area, as well as construction works consisting primarily of the erection of metal roofing and insulation over the rest area. Phase 1 of the construction works commenced in or around December 2014, and was completed in or around March 2015. SRA spent nearly $300,000 in total on the construction works.', '10\\u2003At the time SRA was carrying out the construction works at the Proprietary Range, the appellants started complaining to the Building and Construction Authority (\u201cBCA\u201d) about those works. This was done without SRA\u2019s knowledge.', '11\\u2003The crucial complaint seems to have been made in September 2015. On 15 September 2015, Mr Vaz sent an email to Ms Lu Ji Ju (\u201cMs Lu\u201d) from BCA to report \u201cthe construction of illegal structures which were erected without building permits and are being occupied without a [Temporary Occupation Permit]\u201d. In that email, Mr Vaz said that the structures had been erected by SRA without approval from either Sport SG or SSA, and confirmed that SRA had never applied for a building permit. He therefore questioned the safety of the structures and \u201curgently ask[ed] that BCA [call] for the demolition of the structures before anyone [was] seriously hurt\u201d.', '12\\u2003BCA commenced investigations into this complaint and conducted a site visit at the Proprietary Range on 21 September 2015. Two members of BCA\u2019s staff, one of whom was Ms Lu, and two SSA representatives \u2013 Mr Vaz and SSA\u2019s general manager, Mr David Lieu Da-Yan (\u201cMr David Lieu\u201d) \u2013 were the only individuals present at the site visit. No SRA representative was invited.', '13\\u2003BCA verified through its investigations that no regulatory approvals or permits had been issued for the erection of the Proprietary Range. BCA therefore issued a demolition order to Sport SG, as the lessee of the NSC, on 6 November 2015, ordering the complete demolition of the Proprietary Range by 7 December 2015 (the \u201cDemolition Order\u201d).', '14\\u2003Accompanying the Demolition Order, however, were two letters also issued by BCA to Sport SG on the same day. The first, which the parties refer to as \u201cthe Regularisation Letter\u201d, described the steps that Sport SG could take if it wished to retain the Proprietary Range. The letter stated that if BCA did not receive written confirmation from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (\u201cURA\u201d) by 20 November 2015 that retention of the Proprietary Range could be supported under the Planning Act (Cap 232, 1998 Rev Ed), Sport SG would be deemed not to wish to retain the Proprietary Range, and would then be required to comply with the Demolition Order by the stipulated deadline of 7 December 2015. The second letter reminded Sport SG not to occupy the Proprietary Range, and is not material to this appeal.', '15\\u2003Mr Lim Chuan Lye (\u201cMr Lim\u201d), Senior Manager (Business Operations) of Sport SG, gave evidence that Sport SG forwarded all three documents to SSA on 11 November 2015 by email for its action. Sport SG informed SSA that it could either regularise the Proprietary Range or demolish it, and left it at SSA\u2019s option. Sport SG did not issue any direction to SSA to take any particular course of action, although it did expect SSA to take one of those two steps.', '16\\u2003On 11 November 2015 at 2.26pm, the same day that SSA received Sport SG\u2019s aforesaid email containing the three documents from BCA at 11.29am, Mr David Lieu, SSA\u2019s general manager, wrote to the SSA Executive Committee forwarding the email and the three documents. As we have stated above, the SSA Executive Committee comprised the three Individual Defendants and Mr Peter Teh. Mr David Lieu sought the committee\u2019s approval not to retain the Proprietary Range, not to seek URA\u2019s confirmation of planning approval, and to comply with the Demolition Order.', '17\\u2003The next day, 12 November 2015, Mr David Lieu again wrote to the same recipients informing them that all the members of the SSA Executive Committee had given their approval not to retain the Proprietary Range, not to seek URA\u2019s confirmation of planning approval, and to comply with the Demolition Order. This decision was conveyed to SRA that same day. The decision was cast in terms of SSA taking steps to demolish the Proprietary Range at BCA\u2019s behest: \u201cSSA will take the necessary steps to comply fully with BCA\u2019s Demolition Order \u2026 by the stipulated deadline\u201d. SRA was not informed of the option of regularising the Proprietary Range at all.', '18\\u2003On 14 November 2015, the SSA Council held a meeting to discuss its regular business and also to formalise its decision on the Demolition Order. Mr Vaz was recorded in the minutes as stating the following:', '19\\u2003Mr Ong Eng Chong (\u201cMr Ong\u201d), one of the SRA representatives present at the meeting, was recorded as having asked whether SRA could \u201crespond\u201d to the Demolition Order. Mr Vaz\u2019s reply was recorded as follows:', '20\\u2003Mr Ong followed up with another question as to whether complaints had been made about the Proprietary Range which might have prompted BCA\u2019s investigations. The minutes recorded the following:', '21\\u2003After that meeting and also on 14 November 2015, Mr David Lieu wrote again to SRA informing it that \u201cSRA is to act on the [Demolition] Order and demolish the [Proprietary Range] by Dec 7, 2015, failing which SSA will carry out the [Demolition] Order and charge the work to SRA\u201d [emphasis in original omitted]. Again, no mention was made at all of the option of regularising the Proprietary Range. That same day, Mr David Lieu also wrote to Mr Lim from Sport SG informing him that SSA had communicated to SRA that SRA would have to act on the Demolition Order by 7 December 2015, failing which SSA would demolish the Proprietary Range.', '22\\u2003In the meantime, SRA mounted its own efforts to resist the demolition of the Proprietary Range. On 17 November 2015, Mr Eng Fook Hoong (\u201cMr Eng\u201d), Chairman of SRA, had a conversation with BCA\u2019s Ms Lu, one of the engineers who had conducted the site visit on 21 September 2015 (see [12] above). Mr Eng wrote an email to Ms Lu the next day, 18 November 2015, recording that \u201cSRA shall initiate a meeting of all the parties namely [Sport] SG, SSA and SRA at a time mutually convenient. Timing and venue to be suggested by BCA on or after 30Nov2015 [sic]\u201d. This email was copied to, among other persons, Mr Vaz and Mr Yap from SSA. Mr Vaz then wrote to Ms Lu as well on 19 November 2015, stating that it was \u201cunfortunate that Mr. Eng \u2026 [had] dragged [her] into SRA\u2019s defiance of SSA authority\u201d.', '23\\u2003On 20 November 2015, SSA issued its own invitation for quotations for the demolition of the Proprietary Range. Pikasa Builders Pte Ltd (\u201cPikasa\u201d) was awarded the contract on 24 November 2015 at a price of $24,800, although, as the Judge noted (GD at [16]), the price it ultimately charged was higher at $26,536.', '24\\u2003On 23 November 2015, Mr Eng and two other SRA representatives attended a meeting with Ms Lu at BCA\u2019s office. This was the first time SRA discovered that there was an alternative to demolishing the Proprietary Range, which was to take steps to regularise it.', '25\\u2003On 27 November 2015, BCA wrote to Mr Lim from Sport SG informing him that BCA had received emails from SSA and SRA concerning the Demolition Order. BCA suggested a meeting to discuss the demolition and the request for an extension of time to either demolish or regularise the Proprietary Range. This email was copied to SSA\u2019s Mr Vaz and SRA\u2019s Mr Eng. That same day, Mr Vaz sent an email to Mr Lim stating that SSA would not attend the meeting proposed by BCA: \u201cSSA is not prepared to meet over an issue \u2026 [in respect of which] the council comprising \u2026 the other SSA clubs has decided unanimously to demolish the [Proprietary Range]\u201d.', '26\\u2003On 30 November 2015, the SSA Council met to ratify various resolutions that had been passed earlier in the year. One of these was the resolution that had apparently been passed on 14 November 2015 to demolish the Proprietary Range. At the trial, Mr Vaz explained that he called this meeting to ratify those resolutions as they had not been passed by a show of hands, but he had thereafter received legal advice that they ought to have been so passed.', '27\\u2003While SSA and SRA were grappling over the fate of the Proprietary Range, Sport SG reached out to BCA. On 3 December 2015, BCA granted an extension of time for the demolition of the Proprietary Range until 31 January 2016.', '28\\u2003On 10 December 2015, SRA\u2019s solicitors, Drew & Napier LLC (\u201cD&N\u201d), wrote to SSA\u2019s lawyers, BCA, and Sport SG, requesting all parties not to take any action in relation to the Demolition Order as SRA wished to make representations to BCA.', '29\\u2003By this point, Mr Vaz was very vexed by SRA\u2019s actions in resisting the Demolition Order. On 11 December 2015, he sent an email to Mr Yap expressing his strong dissatisfaction with SRA\u2019s having shown that it had \u201cno intention to comply with the resolutions passed by the SSA Council\u201d. This is a lengthy email which is quite crucial to appreciating Mr Vaz\u2019s intentions. In that email, Mr Vaz said:', '30\\u2003Shortly after this, Mr Vaz prepared the draft circular resolution and sent it to Mr Yap and some of the SSA Council members on 16 December 2015, requesting Mr Yap to circulate it amongst the council. Mr Yap did so later that same day. The salient parts of this resolution (the \u201cCircular Resolution\u201d) read as follows:', '31\\u2003The rest of the Circular Resolution reflected the key terms proposed by Mr Vaz in his email, namely, that certain concessions would be granted to SRA members in their personal capacities. Later that same day, D&N sent a letter to SSA\u2019s solicitors objecting to the Circular Resolution and demanding its retraction by 5.00pm the following day, 17 December 2015.', '32\\u2003Mr Vaz, Mr Patrick Chen and Mr Yap voted in favour of the Circular Resolution, Mr Loo Woei Harng (from SRA) voted against it, and the other SSA Council members either abstained or did not respond. A majority was achieved and the Circular Resolution was therefore passed.', '33\\u2003Even as SSA and SRA remained at loggerheads with each other, SSA proceeded unilaterally with its efforts to have the Proprietary Range demolished. On 18 December 2015, BCA issued SSA a permit to carry out the demolition. Pikasa, SSA\u2019s hired contractor, began to demolish the Proprietary Range on 21 December 2015, and BCA was informed on 22 January 2016 that the demolition had been completed.', '34\\u2003After the SSA Council voted to approve the Circular Resolution, Mr Vaz convened a Board of Inquiry (\u201cBOI\u201d) to investigate the breaches complained of in that resolution, naming retired Brigadier-General Lim Kim Lye, who had joined the SSA Council as an advisor in 2013, as the chairman of the BOI. Two rounds of BOI hearings were held, the first in February 2016, and the second in March 2016: see GD at [23] and [25]. The mandate given to the BOI was to \u201cdetermine if SRA had indeed committed the SRA Breaches \u2026 as set out in the Circular Resolution\u201d. The BOI took the view that SRA had done so, and resolutions were later passed by the SSA Council on 13 February 2016 and 9 April 2016, after, respectively, the first and second rounds of BOI hearings, suspending SRA as a member of SSA and, as a corollary, SRA\u2019s privileges at the NSC. It is unnecessary for us to go into the BOI hearings or its findings in any great detail because we agree with the Judge that the BOI proceedings were essentially a sham exercise undertaken for the purposes of fashioning, after the event, grounds for the decision that had already been taken in the Circular Resolution.', '35\\u2003While the BOI hearings were ongoing, the police audited the armouries at the NSC on 2 and 4 February 2016, and discovered that the armouries contained firearms with no proper records because they belonged to members of shooting clubs who had died, quit their respective clubs, or left Singapore. As a result, the police seized 75 firearms from SRA\u2019s armoury, and two firearms from SGC\u2019s armoury. This led Sport SG to terminate its tenancy agreement with SSA with immediate effect on 6 February 2016, with Sport SG resuming control of the NSC, although it appointed SSA as its interim managing agent for the NSC subject to various conditions.', '36\\u2003On 6 May 2016, SRA brought the present suit against the appellants.', '37\\u2003Some seven months after the present suit was commenced, the SSA Council held an Extraordinary General Meeting (\u201cEGM\u201d) on 10 December 2016, at which the council expelled SRA from SSA as a member with immediate effect.'"}
{"casename":"2019_SGCA_84","fact":"'6\\u2003The appellant (\u201cBNA\u201d) is a corporation organised and existing under the laws of the PRC, with its principal place of business in the PRC. It is the buyer under the Takeout Agreement.', '7\\u2003The first respondent (\u201cBNB\u201d) is a company organised and existing under the laws of the Republic of Korea, with its principal place of business in the Republic of Korea. It was the original seller under the Takeout Agreement.', '8\\u2003The second respondent (\u201cBNC\u201d) is a company organised and existing under the laws of the PRC, with its principal place of business in the PRC. It took on BNB\u2019s rights and obligations under the Takeout Agreement by way of an addendum to the Takeout Agreement.', '9\\u2003The Takeout Agreement was a contract for the sale of industrial gases (\u201cthe products\u201d) by the first respondent, BNB, to the appellant, BNA. BNA and BNB entered into the Takeout Agreement on 7 August 2012.', '10\\u2003On 1 February 2013, BNA, BNB and BNC entered into an addendum to the Takeout Agreement (the \u201cAddendum\u201d). Clause 2 of the Addendum relevantly provided that \u201c[BNA, BNB and BNC\u201d] agree that the rights and obligations of [BNB] under the [Takeout Agreement] [would] be fully assigned to [BNC] effective from February 1, 2013\u201d. The Addendum was also specifically provided to be \u201can indivisible part of the [Takeout Agreement]\u201d, with the Addendum to prevail in the event of any conflict or discrepancy between it and the Takeout Agreement. Like the Judge below, we use the term \u201cTakeout Agreement\u201d hereafter in this judgment to refer to the single indivisible agreement comprising both the original Takeout Agreement and the Addendum.', '11\\u2003The primary obligation of BNA as the buyer under the Takeout Agreement was to buy specified quantities of the products from, at first, BNB, and later, BNC. The Takeout Agreement required BNA to pay the respondents on a monthly basis for the products purchased and delivered. The products which are the subject of the Takeout Agreement were manufactured in the PRC by the respondents. The products were to be sold and transported from the respondents\u2019 facilities to the appellant\u2019s facilities. The relevant facilities were all located in the PRC.', '12\\u2003The critical provision in the Takeout Agreement is Art 14:', 'As the Judge below noted, Art 14 serves two purposes. It records the parties\u2019 express choice of PRC law to govern the Takeout Agreement and it contains the parties\u2019 arbitration agreement.'"}
{"casename":"2019_SGCA_9","fact":"'6\\u2003The relevant facts may be set out briefly. On 14 October 2014, the appellant was arrested as he was trying to exit a Housing Development Board carpark in a van almost immediately after collecting five black bundles of granular substance. These five bundles were later analysed and found to contain not less than 40.37g of diamorphine (\u201cthe Fourth Consignment\u201d). Drug paraphernalia used for repacking drugs were also seized from the appellant at the time of his arrest.', '7\\u2003In his statements, the appellant gave evidence that he had dealt with three previous consignments for one \u201cAbang\u201d prior to his arrest. On the first two occasions (\u201cthe First and Second Consignments\u201d), Abang had instructed the appellant merely to deliver those consignments to other persons. It is not in dispute that on those occasions, the appellant did no more than act as a courier. However, after the completion of the second delivery, Abang arranged for the appellant to receive drug paraphernalia that was to be used for repacking drugs. For the Third Consignment, Abang instructed the appellant to repack the drugs for distribution, and the appellant did as instructed. The appellant was arrested after he collected the Fourth Consignment.', '8\\u2003It was undisputed that if the appellant had repacked the drugs in the Fourth Consignment (as he had done in respect of the Third Consignment), his actions would have gone beyond those of a mere courier. This followed from our decision in Zainudin bin Mohamed v Public Prosecutor [2018] 1 SLR 449, in which we held that where the act of division and packing was not merely a preparatory step to deliver but an antecedent step to facilitating distribution to more than one recipient, such an act would not fall within the scope of s 33B(2)(a)(iii) of the MDA (at [101]).', '9\\u2003It was also undisputed that at the point of the appellant\u2019s arrest, he had done nothing more than to collect and transport the drugs, because he had been arrested almost immediately thereafter. Further, he had not in fact received any instructions from Abang as to what he was to do with the drugs.', '10\\u2003As to what the appellant had intended to do with the drugs, his unequivocal evidence was that he had intended to do whatever he might have been instructed by Abang to do. The appellant confirmed, on multiple occasions, that if Abang had instructed him to repack the drugs, he would have done so. Equally, if Abang had simply told him to deliver the drugs to someone else, he would have done that.', '(a)\\u2003The appellant first said this in his contemporaneous statement recorded on 14 October 2014:', '(b)\\u2003The appellant confirmed this in cross-examination:', '11\\u2003The fact remained however that:', '(a)\\u2003No instructions had in fact been given by Abang to the appellant at the time of his arrest; and', '(b)\\u2003No evidence could be or was led as to what such instructions would, in fact, have been.'"}
