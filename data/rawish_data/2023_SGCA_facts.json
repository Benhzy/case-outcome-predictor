{"casename":"2023_SGCA_1","fact":"4\\u2003The appellant is an Indian resident and a founder of the Company. Amongst other things, the Company owns and operates a well-known online and offline matrimonial service called \u201cshaadi.com\u201d (\u201cShaadi.com\u201d). Shaadi.com was co-founded by the appellant and his cousins, Anand Mittal (\u201cAM\u201d) and Navin Mittal (\u201cNM\u201d), both of whom were among the initial shareholders of the Company. The appellant was the managing director of the Company from 30 November 2004 to 30 November 2019.', '5\\u2003The respondent is a private equity fund incorporated under the laws of Mauritius. It invested in the Company in early 2006. Consequently, on 10 February 2006, the appellant and his cousins entered into two agreements with the respondent. One was a Share Subscription and Share Purchase Agreement under which shares in the Company were to be issued to the respondent. The second was a Shareholders\u2019 Agreement (\u201cthe SHA\u201d) regulating the parties\u2019 rights and responsibilities as shareholders. On 7 May 2008, the parties to the SHA signed the First Supplementary Subscription-Cum-Shareholders\u2019 Agreement (\u201cthe SSSA\u201d) with SVB India Capital Partners LP, SVB Financial Group and the respondent. Clause 20.2 of the SHA and cl 10.2 of the SSSA are identically worded governing law and arbitration clauses.', '6\\u2003Clause 20 of the SHA states:', '7\\u2003In 2014, NM sold his shares to the respondent and resigned as a director of the Company. According to the appellant, as of 30 March 2021, on a \u201cfully diluted basis\u201d, the respondent held 44.38% of the shares in the Company, AM had 13.13% and he himself owned 30.26%.', '8\\u2003Under the SHA, the respondent was entitled to appoint a nominee director to the Board of the Company. From 24 April 2019, one Shobitha Anne Mani (\u201cMs Mani\u201d) was the respondent\u2019s nominee director.', '9\\u2003The parties\u2019 relationship soured in 2017 when the respondent expressed an interest in exiting from the Company.', '10\\u2003Clause 3.4 of the SHA envisaged that the Company was to complete an initial public offering (\u201cIPO\u201d) within five years from closing (as defined in the SHA). If it did not do so, the respondent would be able to exit its investment through redemption of its shares and, if necessary, \u201cdrag along\u201d rights as provided for in the SHA. The latter meant that the respondent could compel the Founders (ie, the appellant, AM and NM) to sell all or part of their shares, together with the respondent\u2019s shares, to a third-party buyer. As no IPO was achieved, the respondent wanted to disengage. Accordingly, discussions on the potential sale of the Company were held with an entity known as Info Edge (India) Limited (\u201cInfo Edge\u201d), which was a competitor of the Company. The appellant\u2019s position is that Info Edge is a \u201cSignificant Competitor\u201d of the Company within the meaning of that term in the SHA.', '11\\u2003The disengagement did not proceed smoothly as the parties disagreed on several matters including the potential sale of the Company to Info Edge, the respondent\u2019s refusal to consent to the re-appointment of the appellant as managing director in 2019 and the re-appointment of NM as a Founding Director, another position defined in the SHA.', '12\\u2003The appellant is unhappy over the potential sale to Info Edge because of its position as a Significant Competitor. According to the appellant, when the sale of the Company\u2019s shares was first being explored, the respondent refused to negotiate with any interested buyer apart from Info Edge. The appellant says that, at this time, he did not know that the respondent also held investments in Info Edge. At the appellant\u2019s instigation, the Company and Info Edge entered into a Non-Disclosure Agreement on 13 April 2017 for a term of two years to protect the Company\u2019s sensitive and confidential information. Sometime in 2018, when the respondent unexpectedly withdrew support for the sale of shares to Info Edge, the appellant placed on record his objections to the respondent\u2019s conduct, especially since the Company\u2019s sensitive and confidential information had been shared with Info Edge in discussions leading up to the deal. In 2019, the respondent initiated a revival of discussions with Info Edge. The appellant accuses the respondent of colluding with AM to secure terms from Info Edge that were favourable to it.', '13\\u2003The appellant also asserts that, after he voiced his concerns about re-opening discussions with Info Edge in 2019, the respondent and AM \u201cstarted taking steps in earnest\u201d to oust him from the position of managing director of the Company.', '14\\u2003In light of these disagreements, the appellant summarises his complaints against the respondent as follows:', '(a)\\u2003The collusion complaint: \u201ccontrary to the joint venture or quasi-partnership nature of the Company since 2006, the NCLT Defendants colluded to oppress the Appellant (being the minority shareholder) with the intention being to wrest control of the management of the day-to-day operations of the Company in a manner contrary to the interests of the Company, and marginalise the Appellant as a shareholder and Board Member\u201d.', '(b)\\u2003The breach of fiduciary duty complaint: \u201c[AM] and [Ms Mani] in their capacity as directors of the Company, were in breach of their fiduciary duties and failed to act in the interests of the Company on a number of occasions\u201d.', '15\\u2003On 3 March 2021, the appellant filed a petition in the NCLT seeking remedies for corporate oppression.

In the NCLT Proceedings, the appellant is the petitioner and the Company, the respondent, Ms Mani, AM and NM are named as the respondents. The Judge summarised the reliefs sought by the appellant in the NCLT Proceedings in these terms:', '(a)\\u2003an injunction to restrain the respondent and the respondent\u2019s directors, employees, servants, agents and or any person claiming through or under them, from in any manner, disrupting the management and operation of the Company and\/or conducting the affairs of the Company in a manner prejudicial or oppressive to any member of the Company or to itself;', '(b)\\u2003a declaration that the appellant\u2019s continuation as an executive director of the Company, pursuant to the resolution passed by the Board of directors at the meeting held on 28 November 2019, is valid and that all actions taken by the appellant as an executive director of the Company are not invalid;', '(c)\\u2003an injunction to restrain the respondent, the Company and certain others, their directors, employees, servants, agents and\/or any person claiming through or under them, from in any manner, whether directly or indirectly hindering and\/or prohibiting the appellant from performing his functions as an executive director of the Company;', '(d)\\u2003an order to direct the respondent, the Company and certain others to initiate a process for identifying and appointing a suitable, independent, non-partisan and impartial candidate to be managing director of the Company in a time-bound manner; and', '(e)\\u2003certain other declarations and interim reliefs.', '16\\u2003The respondent reacted to the filing of the NCLT Proceedings by filing OS 242 on 15 March 2021. On the same day, Andrew Ang SJ granted the respondent:', '17\\u2003Thereafter, the appellant took action to neutralise the effect of the interim anti-suit injunction. He commenced an action in Bombay, which we elaborate on below. Separately, on 31 March 2021, the appellant filed an application to set aside the interim anti-suit injunction. However, when a permanent anti-suit injunction was issued against the appellant on 26 October 2021, that application was rendered moot.', '18\\u2003The action in the Bombay High Court (\u201cthe Bombay suit\u201d) was started on 18 March 2021. By it, the appellant seeks the following orders:', '19\\u2003As far as we are aware, the Bombay suit has not been fixed for hearing yet. In March 2021, the appellant filed an interlocutory application in the Bombay suit by which he sought an interim injunction restraining the respondent from enforcing the interim anti-suit injunction granted by Ang SJ. This prayer has since been amended to refer to the permanent anti-suit injunction granted by the Judge. The application was originally fixed for hearing on 5 September 2022 but had to be adjourned to a date to be fixed."}
{"casename":"2023_SGCA_10","fact":"4\\u2003The parties were married in September 2003. The interim judgment of divorce was granted in July 2019. The ancillary matters relating to the division of matrimonial assets were heard in January 2021 (the \u201cAM Hearing\u201d). Orders in respect of the ancillary matters were delivered on 23 March 2021 and full grounds of decision were issued on 24 June 2021 in CLC v CLB [2021] SGHCF 17 (\u201cHC GD\u201d).', '5\\u2003The main dispute in the appeal before the Appellate Division concerned the assets in six Australian bank accounts and investment portfolios which the Husband claimed were derived from gifts or inheritance from his late father, and should therefore be excluded from the matrimonial pool. To be more precise, the Disputed Assets are identified in tabular form in [8] below. The total value of these six accounts making up the Disputed Assets was S$3,801,862.53 as at the date of the AM Hearing.', '6\\u2003On the Husband\u2019s case, the sources of the Disputed Assets were: (a) money from his father\u2019s Australian will (the \u201cAustralian Inheritance\u201d and \u201cAustralian Will\u201d respectively); (b) money from the winding up of a company, \u201c[G] Inc\u201d (the \u201c[G] Money\u201d); and (c) money from the sale of the shares of a company, \u201c[H] Sdn Bhd\u201d (the \u201c[H] Money\u201d). For completeness, we note that the Husband also received money from his father\u2019s Singapore will (the \u201cSingaporean Inheritance\u201d), under which he inherited a share in a property in Cairnhill Road and money in a DBS Bank account. It was not argued, however, that these sums had contributed to the Disputed Assets. The monies from these four sources were broadly referred to by the Appellate Division as the \u201cInheritance Monies\u201d and amounted to a total of S$5,024,886.35.', '7\\u2003The Husband also argued that another Australian bank account in his sole name, an ANZ Account No. ending 55 (\u201cANZ-55\u201d), which was valued at S$10,602.11, should be excluded from the matrimonial pool, on the basis that it was a pre-marriage asset and the money therein was derived from the Australian Inheritance.', '8\\u2003The accounts making up the Disputed Assets were:', '9\\u2003The Husband deposed that after his father\u2019s death on 6 March 2008, he inherited assets under various wills made by his father. Significantly, under the Australian Will, the Husband was beneficiary of 12.5% of the residuary estate in Australia, and trustee of his children\u2019s entitlement to 12.5% of the same. Pursuant to the Australian Will, he received S$132,693.42, comprising both his and his children\u2019s entitlements. These monies were mixed with his existing funds in ANZ-55. From that account, monies were spent when the family made trips to Australia, and the funds were also intermingled with funds in the Disputed Assets.', '10\\u2003The Wife did not dispute that the Australian Inheritance was placed in several of the Husband\u2019s trading and bank accounts in Australia, including ANZ-55, CBA-29, Schwab-12, CSA-63, and Shaw-15. She argued, however, that the monies which the Husband had transferred out of their joint bank accounts in Malaysia from September 2018 onwards must have been transferred into these accounts in Australia as well given, amongst other things, the large amounts totalling US$900,000 that were transferred out of the Malaysian accounts between December 2018 and April 2019.', '11\\u2003Before turning to discuss the [G] and [H] Monies, it is relevant to note that the Husband had also argued for the following accounts or investments (the \u201cOther Investments\u201d) to be excluded from the matrimonial pool, on the basis that they were pre-marriage assets or derived from gifts or inheritance:', '12\\u2003The Husband deposed that his father had given him shares in [G] Inc before his marriage to the Wife. That was why the shareholding was listed as separate property in a pre-nuptial agreement that the parties had entered into on 15 September 2003. All proceeds from the liquidation of [G] Inc in 2006 were credited into a BNP Paribas Account No. ending 34 before being transferred to a BNP Paribas Account No. ending 48, and were subsequently distributed around October 2008 in accordance with his father\u2019s Memorandum of Wishes. The Husband\u2019s share of the distribution was S$519,411.93 (the \u201c[G] Money\u201d). This was \u201ctransferred to and mixed with the existing funds\u201d in DBS-3. That account had been listed as separate property in the pre-nuptial agreement and was \u201cexcluded by agreement from being [a] matrimonial asset\u201d. The monies were also used to partially fund the balance price of a property identified as Property 2 which the parties had purchased during their marriage and which was registered in the Wife\u2019s name. The monies were additionally placed into the Disputed Assets as well as Orbit-18, the Orbit Trust Account, the [J] Placement Shares, DBS-42 and DBS-60.', '13\\u2003Before the Judge, the Wife did not submit on the [G] Money as such, but dealt with it as part of the Singaporean Inheritance (HC GD at [59]). Before the Appellate Division, however, the Wife accepted that the factual evidence from the Husband showed that when he received the [G] Money in 2008, it was deposited in DBS-3, not with the Disputed Assets. Thus, the [G] Money could not be traced to the Disputed Assets. This was because, during the whole period from 2009 to 2015 when the Husband received the [G] and [H] Monies, there were only two injections of funds into the six accounts comprising the Disputed Assets that were traceable to the Husband\u2019s inheritance: (a) once in 2008, in the amount of the Australian Inheritance into the Disputed Assets; and (b) after the marriage broke down in 2018, when their joint account in Malaysia (the \u201cUOB Joint Account\u201d, as defined at [15] below) was emptied out and an unascertainable amount was deposited into the Disputed Assets.', '14\\u2003The Wife also argued that, according to the Husband, his expenditure on the family\u2019s expenses in Singapore and the Singapore matrimonial properties were made from DBS-3. The Husband\u2019s DBS-3 account had also been credited by the Wife in a total amount of S$28,000 from 2007 to 2015. As the [G] Money had thus been co-mingled with other funds used for family expenses over the years to 2017, it was no longer separately identifiable.', '15\\u2003The Husband deposed that he became the beneficial owner of the shares in [H] Sdn Bhd under a trust created by his father in 1998. Following his father\u2019s death, he received a total of S$3,541,240.77 (the \u201c[H] Money\u201d) over several tranches between February 2010 and mid-June 2015. The first six tranches amounting to a total of S$3,519,419.80 were paid into a joint account shared with the Wife, UOB (Malaysia) Account No. ending 1619, which is now closed; and the last tranche of S$21,820.97 was paid into another joint account, UOB (Malaysia) Account No. ending 8619, which at the time of the AM Hearing had a value of S$265.39. As the latter account was opened as a replacement for the former following the bank\u2019s procedural reforms, the accounts will be referred to interchangeably as the \u201cUOB Joint Account\u201d. The Husband\u2019s position, however, was that although money was used from the UOB Joint Account during the marriage, it was not mixed with any money from the Wife during the entire marriage. He deposed that the reason for the UOB Joint Account was \u201csimply to operate as a contingency plan such that should anything untoward happen to [him], the [Wife] and the children [could] access the funds for the support of the family after [his] demise\u201d.', '16\\u2003The Husband submitted that the funds were subsequently deposited into UOB-75 and the UOB Kay Hian Securities Trading Account. Part of the money was also used to acquire his other assets such as the Disputed Assets as well as Orbit-18, the Orbit Trust Account, the [J] Placement Shares, DBS-42 and DBS-60.', '17\\u2003The Wife\u2019s position was that the Husband\u2019s intention to share the [H] Money with the Wife and use it to provide for the family was \u201cunambiguous and undisputed\u201d. The [H] Money was deposited into the UOB Joint Account and some amounts therefrom were subsequently transferred to joint fixed deposit accounts. During the marriage, money from the UOB Joint Account was used for the family\u2019s holidays in Malaysia and the Husband\u2019s expenses during his travels in Malaysia. The monies were kept in the UOB Joint Account and joint fixed deposit accounts until the marriage broke down in late 2018. Then the Husband transferred them to his sole bank accounts in Malaysia, Singapore and Australia, allegedly to \u201cringfence his monies in an attempt to transform the family\u2019s monies back to his inherited monies\u201d.', '18\\u2003As with the [G] Money, the Wife contended that the [H] Money could not be traced to the Disputed Assets given that only two of the deposits therein could be traced to the Inheritance Monies. The [H] Money remained in the UOB Joint Account until the marriage broke down in 2018, at which point some of the money may have been placed in the Disputed Assets. But as there was no proper trail or accounting, it was impossible to ascertain whether the funds that went into the Disputed Assets were attributable entirely to inherited funds, having come from mixed sources of funds such as the Husband\u2019s investments between 2009 to 2018 and the UOB Joint Account."}

Earlier that day, at about \n9.00 am, Senior Station Inspector David Ng (\u201cSSI Ng\u201d) had received \ninformation about Andi. SSI Ng and his officers tailed Andi\u2019s car until it ended \nup at the service road near Block 716. SSI Ng was dropped off and walked to \nthe void deck of Block 716. There, he spotted an Indian male who was carrying \nan orange plastic bag. The Indian male was standing about 5\u201310 metres away \nfrom SSI Ng and SSI Ng observed his face for about 30 seconds. \n6 A few minutes later, a CNB officer who was observing Andi\u2019s car \nreported that an Indian male carrying an orange plastic bag (the \u201cOrange Bag\u201d) \nVersion No 1: 27 Mar 2023 (13:42 hrs)\nMohd Akebal s\/o Ghulam Jilani v PP[2023] SGCA 11\n3had approached Andi\u2019s car and placed that Orange Bag on the passenger seat. \nThe Indian male then walked away and Andi drove off. I will refer to this as the \n\u201cdrug transaction\u201d. \n7 Shortly thereafter, SSI Ng saw the same Indian male at a sheltered \nwalkway leading towards the main road. He observed the Indian male boarding \nbus No. 964. He reported this over his communications set, describing the \nIndian male as wearing a grey T-shirt with blue jeans. He instructed Staff \nSergeant Goh Jun Xian Eric (\u201cSSgt Goh\u201d) to tail the Indian male.\n8 SSgt Goh tailed bus No. 964 till it reached Woodlands Bus Interchange \nwhere he saw the Indian male wearing a grey T-shirt and blue jeans alight and \nwait for bus No. 913. When the Indian male boarded bus No. 913, SSgt Goh \nboarded as well and sat two rows in front of him. When the Indian male alighted, \nSSgt Goh followed. However, SSgt Goh lost sight of him at Block 1 Marsiling \nRoad.\n9 SSgt Goh then returned to the Woodlands area to continue looking for \nthe Indian male. At about 8.25pm, he reported that he had spotted the same \nIndian male wearing a grey T-shirt and blue jeans. The Indian male was arrested \nand he turned out to be the applicant. A Nokia mobile phone which was using \nthe Phone Number (the \u201cMobile Phone\u201d) was found in a grass patch next to the \napplicant when he was arrested.\n10 Separately, CNB officers had continued tailing Andi\u2019s car after it left \nBlock 716. CNB officers arrested Andi and his car was searched. The Orange \nBag was recovered. There were two black-taped bundles in the Orange Bag. \nImmediately after Andi\u2019s arrest, at about 1.30pm, a statement was recorded \nfrom him. When shown a photoboard with photographs of 13 individuals, Andi \nVersion No 1: 27 Mar 2023 (13:42 hrs)\nMohd Akebal s\/o Ghulam Jilani v PP[2023] SGCA 11\n4identified the photograph of the applicant as the one showing the person who \nhad given him the Orange Bag earlier. In his long statement taken on \n26 August 2014, Andi repeated that the applicant was the one who had passed \nhim the Orange Bag.\n11 The two black-taped bundles that were found in the Orange Bag were \nfound to contain 14.60g and 14.46g of diamorphine respectively.\nThe applicant\u2019s defence\n12 The applicant\u2019s defence was that he was not involved in the drug \ntransaction at all and that he had been wrongly identified: the Trial Judgment at \n[17]. The Prosecution relied on the identification evidence of SSI Ng, SSgt Goh \nand Andi to establish that the applicant was the Indian male involved in the drug \ntransaction. The applicant argued that the identification evidence was \ninsufficient for the following reasons:\n(a) First, he was not wearing a grey T-shirt at the material time on \n22 August 2014. He was wearing a long-sleeved white shirt with \nblue sleeves because he was reporting for a urine test that day \nand had to cover up the tattoos on his arms: the Trial Judgment \nat [18] and [60].\n(b) Second, the Prosecution\u2019s witnesses gave inconsistent testimony \non the attire worn by the applicant during the drug transaction: \nthe Trial Judgment at [61].\n(c) Third, Andi was suffering from drug withdrawal during the \nrecording of his statements in which he identified the applicant: \nthe Trial Judgment at [19]. \nVersion No 1: 27 Mar 2023 (13:42 hrs)\nMohd Akebal s\/o Ghulam Jilani v PP[2023] SGCA 11\n513 The applicant also claimed that while he had the Mobile Phone at the \ntime of his arrest, he was not in possession of the Mobile Phone during the drug \ntransaction. He claimed that he had passed it to a \u201cBala\u201d at 11.00 pm on \n21 August 2014 and it was returned to him shortly before he was arrested on \n22 August 2014: the Trial Judgment at [71].\nThe trial judge\u2019s findings\n14 In rejecting the applicant\u2019s defence, the trial judge made the following \nkey findings. \n(a) The urine test was almost two hours after the drug transaction \nand the applicant could have easily changed his attire after the \ndrug transaction and before his urine test: the Trial Judgment at \n[63]. \n(b) The inconsistent testimony on the applicant\u2019s attire did not \ndiminish the veracity of the identification evidence because \nSSI Ng and Andi would have been focused on the applicant\u2019s \nface rather than his attire. Further, three to four years had passed \nbetween the drug transaction and the witnesses\u2019 evidence in \ncourt, so allowance had to be given for human fallibility in \nrecollection: the Trial Judgment at [62].\n(c) The applicant\u2019s own medical expert accepted that by the time the \nlong statement was recorded, Andi was likely to have been more \n\u201cclearheaded\u201d and the withdrawal symptoms were likely to have \nbeen \u201cpast its peak\u201d: the Trial Judgment at [55].\n(d) The phone records in evidence corroborated the identification of \nthe applicant as the individual involved in the drug transaction. \nThere were multiple phone calls between the Phone Number and \nVersion No 1: 27 Mar 2023 (13:42 hrs)\nMohd Akebal s\/o Ghulam Jilani v PP[2023] SGCA 11\n6Andi on 22 August 2014, between 9.00am and 10.21am. The \nMobile Phone, which used the Phone Number, was found next \nto the applicant when he was arrested: the Trial Judgment at \n[68]\u2013[70].\n(e) The applicant\u2019s claim that he had passed the Mobile Phone to \n\u201cBala\u201d was improbable, especially since it contradicted directly \nhis own statement to CNB given on 28 August 2014: the Trial \nJudgment at [75]."}

Another team of CNB officers, comprising Inspector Muhammad Faizal bin Baharin (\u201cInsp Faizal\u201d), Staff Sergeant Ace Ignatius Siao Chen Wee and Staff Sergeant Azman bin Mohd Saleh, tailed Dzulkarnain\u2019s van as it was driven to Lorong 21 and then to Lorong 37.', '9\\u2003At Lorong 37, Insp Faizal and his team saw Dzulkarnain place the Brown Box behind a green dustbin which had the number \u201c14\u201d marked in white on it (the \u201cGreen Bin\u201d), before driving off in the van. The Green Bin was located next to No 14, Lorong 37 Geylang, Singapore (\u201c14 Lorong 37\u201d or the \u201cdrop-off point\u201d). Insp Faizal and his team continued to tail the van.', '10\\u2003About five minutes after Dzulkarnain left Lorong 37, Sanjay drove to Lorong 37 in his car. SSSgt Eng and Sgt Hidayat saw Sanjay\u2019s car turning into Lorong 37 and followed him. Sanjay stopped beside the Green Bin, alighted from his car and retrieved a brown box from behind the Green Bin at the drop-off point (the \u201cSKP Box\u201d). He then returned to his car and drove off.', '11\\u2003Sanjay was subsequently apprehended by a team of CNB officers at around 4.35pm near Lorong 36 Geylang. At around 4.40pm, Dzulkarnain too was arrested by Insp Faizal and his team at an Esso petrol kiosk.', '12\\u2003Following his arrest, Sanjay was led by Senior Staff Sergeant Wong Kah Hung (Alwin) (\u201cSSSgt Alwin\u201d) and Sgt Hidayat to the rear passenger seat of his car. Sergeant Dadly bin Osman (\u201cSgt Dadly\u201d) then drove Sanjay\u2019s car to a multi-storey carpark at Block 56A Cassia Crescent (the \u201cMSCP\u201d).', '13\\u2003At the MSCP, a body search was conducted on Sanjay, and a handphone, later marked as \u201cSK-HP1\u201d, was recovered. Station Inspector Tay Cher Yeen (Jason) (\u201cSI Tay\u201d) and Sgt Hidayat then searched Sanjay\u2019s car in his presence. The following exhibits, amongst others, were retrieved:', '14\\u2003Before the SKP Box was opened, Sanjay was asked by SI Tay about its contents. Sanjay purportedly shrugged and did not verbalise his answer. His reaction was recorded by SSSgt Alwin in the CNB operation field book (Sanjay\u2019s \u201coral statement\u201d and the \u201cCNB field book\u201d respectively). SI Tay then tore away the masking tape sealing the SKP Box and removed five bundles of vegetable matter from within. He then handed each bundle to Sgt Hidayat, who packed and sealed each of the bundles into separate polymer bags, and placed the seized drug exhibits into a green duffel bag (the \u201cdrug exhibits\u201d and the \u201cduffel bag\u201d), before handing the duffel bag to SI Tay. From around 7.45pm until about 8.30pm, SI Tay recorded a contemporaneous statement from Sanjay under s 22 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (\u201cCPC\u201d) (Sanjay\u2019s \u201ccontemporaneous statement\u201d). In Sanjay\u2019s contemporaneous statement, he informed SI Tay that he did not know what the SKP Box contained.', '15\\u2003Apart from Sanjay\u2019s contemporaneous statement, eight other statements were recorded from him during the course of the investigations. In Sanjay\u2019s cautioned statement recorded on 24 February 2015 by the Investigation Officer, Senior Staff Sergeant Ranjeet Ram Behari (Sanjay\u2019s \u201ccautioned statement\u201d and \u201cIO Ranjeet\u201d respectively), Sanjay informed IO Ranjeet that he believed the SKP Box contained \u201cillegal cigarettes\u201d based on what he had been told by someone he referred to as \u201cMalaysia Boy\u201d. Sanjay did not sign his cautioned statement, though the Judge was satisfied that it was an accurate record of what Sanjay had said to IO Ranjeet (GD at [30] and [84]). In any case, this point was not taken on appeal.', '16\\u2003In Sanjay\u2019s fifth long statement, which IO Ranjeet recorded on 8 March 2015, almost two weeks after the arrest, Sanjay departed from his earlier account and said that he had been told by one \u201cBoy Lai\u201d to take delivery of some collectors\u2019 hunting knives and that \u201cthere may also be contraband \u2026 cigarettes\u201d [emphasis added]. This was the first time he mentioned his purported belief that the SKP Box contained collectors\u2019 hunting knives and possibly contraband cigarettes, and was a departure from his earlier account that he believed the SKP Box contained contraband cigarettes based on what Malaysia Boy had told him.', '17\\u2003Following Dzulkarnain\u2019s arrest, the CNB officers escorted him to a multi-storey carpark at Block 54 Cassia Road. Upon their arrival, the CNB officers conducted a search of Dzulkarnain and his van. Amongst other things, a handphone was seized and later marked by the CNB as \u201cDBK-HP1\u201d.', '18\\u2003At around 5.15pm, Dzulkarnain was served the Mandatory Death Penalty Notice by Staff Sergeant Muhammad Fardlie bin Ramlie (\u201cSSgt Fardlie\u201d), whereupon Dzulkarnain furnished his statement in response, which was recorded by SSgt Fardlie at about 5.25pm (the \u201cMDP Statement\u201d). In the MDP Statement, Dzulkarnain said that he did not know what the Brown Box contained, that he believed it likely contained cigarettes, and that he was paid $250 to collect and deliver the Brown Box. From about 5.30pm to 6.00pm, SSgt Fardlie recorded a contemporaneous statement from Dzulkarnain under s 22 of the CPC, in which Dzulkarnain maintained his position that he did not know the contents of the Brown Box.', '19\\u2003Apart from the MDP Statement and his contemporaneous statement, a cautioned statement and four long statements were recorded from Dzulkarnain during the course of the investigations. In these other statements, Dzulkarnain admitted that he knew he was supposed to deliver drugs to Sanjay, and also explained the circumstances surrounding his involvement in the collection and delivery of drugs to Sanjay. To summarise, one \u201cBala Luk Kor\u201d, who was Dzulkarnain\u2019s friend and a member of a gang known as \u201c369\u201d, knew that Dzulkarnain was in financial difficulty and offered to pay him $500 for delivering drugs. On 22 February 2015, Bala Luk Kor informed Dzulkarnain that Sanjay had a drug delivery for him to carry out, and that Sanjay would contact him directly in this connection. In the early morning of 23 February 2015, Sanjay met Dzulkarnain at People\u2019s Park Complex in Chinatown and informed him that he would be paid $250 initially, and another $250 upon completion of the job. Later that afternoon, Sanjay called Dzulkarnain and instructed him to collect the Brown Box from the Tuas Bus Stop. Dzulkarnain did as he was told, and eventually delivered the Brown Box to the drop-off point at Lorong 37.', '20\\u2003A team of CNB officers comprising SI Tay, SSSgt Alwin and Sgt Dadly (\u201cSanjay\u2019s Arrest Group\u201d), then accompanied Sanjay to his unit at 9H Yuan Ching Road to conduct a search. On the way there, the duffel bag containing the drug exhibits was placed in the boot of the CNB vehicle. When they arrived at Yuan Ching Road at about 9.30pm, Sanjay\u2019s Arrest Group proceeded to search Sanjay\u2019s unit in his presence. Throughout this time, it appears from the evidence that SI Tay was holding the duffel bag.', '21\\u2003The search concluded at 9.45pm, and they all then returned to the vehicle. SI Tay placed the duffel bag in the boot of the CNB vehicle, and they then proceeded to Tuas Checkpoint to carry out some checks on Sanjay\u2019s car. At Tuas Checkpoint, the duffel bag remained in the boot of the CNB vehicle.', '22\\u2003Following these checks, they departed for Alexandra Hospital, and arrived there at about 10.50pm. At about 11.10pm, a relief team of CNB officers comprising SSSgt Eng, Staff Sergeant Goh Jun Xian, Sgt Hidayat and SSgt Au Yong Hong Mian arrived in another vehicle. Both vehicles were parked side by side at the open-air car park at Alexandra Hospital. Sanjay\u2019s Arrest Group handed over custody of Sanjay and the duffel bag to SSSgt Eng\u2019s team. SSSgt Eng\u2019s team then departed for the CNB headquarters (\u201cCNB HQ\u201d) with Sanjay, and it was SSSgt Eng\u2019s evidence that the duffel bag was in his possession at all times throughout the journey to the CNB HQ. At the CNB HQ, SSSgt Eng retained possession of the duffel bag until he handed it to IO Ranjeet at 3.24am on the following morning, 24 February 2015, so that the exhibits could be photographed.', '23\\u2003At about 6.47am on the same day, after photographing, swabbing and weighing the drug exhibits in the presence of Sanjay and Dzulkarnain, IO Ranjeet placed the drug exhibits in a locked safe in his office, before later transferring them to the CNB store. On 2 March 2015 at around 5.20pm, IO Ranjeet delivered the drug exhibits to the HSA for analysis."}

Dr Harren was also a director of HARPA at the material time.', '8\\u2003As mentioned above, the present dispute concerns a series of payments that BIT Baltic made between 12 December 2018 and 27 December 2018 to HARPA and HPS. The Payments were made for services furnished by HARPA and HPS to BIT Baltic between March 2014 and September 2016. Specifically, HARPA provided BIT Baltic with vessel accounting, bookkeeping and IT services for the vessel \u201cBlue Giant\u201d while HPS provided controlling and financial services to BIT Baltic for \u201cBlue Giant\u201d until its redelivery by BIT Baltic to its registered owners. We shall refer to these services collectively as \u201cthe Services\u201d. Before October 2018, the amounts due to HARPA and HPS for the Services had not been documented or invoiced and were not reflected in BIT Baltic\u2019s accounts.', '9\\u2003Notwithstanding that (a) HARPA\u2019s and HPS\u2019 provision of the Services concluded in 2016, and (b) BIT Baltic had stopped generating revenue as of December 2017, BIT Baltic entered into agreements for the Services with HARPA (\u201cthe HARPA Agreement\u201d) and HPS (\u201cthe HPS Agreement\u201d) on 1 October 2018. The HARPA Agreement provided that BIT Baltic was to pay HARPA a monthly fee of US$25,500 a month for its services, while the HPS Agreement provided that BIT Baltic was to pay HPS a monthly fee of US$22,000 for its services. The HARPA Agreement and the HPS Agreement were signed by Mr Wee, on behalf of BIT Baltic, and by Dr Harren, on behalf of HARPA and HPS respectively.', '10\\u2003Once the contracts had been executed, HARPA and HPS issued invoices under the HARPA Agreement and HPS Agreement to BIT Baltic.

The total amounts due to HARPA and HPS under the invoices were US$790,500 and US$682,000, respectively. The invoices were settled between 12 and 27 December 2018, as mentioned earlier (at [8]). The money used to settle the invoices came almost completely from the proceeds of loan repayments made to BIT Baltic by HPSH between 12 December 2018 and 27 December 2018. As each repayment instalment was received by BIT Baltic it was almost immediately used to pay HPS and HARPA for the Services. The total amount paid out was US$1,472,500.', '11\\u2003Following the winding up of BIT Baltic in June 2020, the Liquidator took control of its books and investigated its affairs. On 5 July 2021 BIT Baltic commenced OS 667 against Mr Wee for damages in respect of alleged breaches of his director\u2019s duties in relation to the Payments. BIT Baltic claimed that Mr Wee breached these duties by failing to determine whether it was permissible for BIT Baltic to make the Payments in preference to BIT Baltic\u2019s other creditors when BIT Baltic was insolvent, or when the Payments would have resulted in BIT Baltic becoming insolvent. BIT Baltic thus sought an assessment of damages as against Mr Wee for \u201call loss and damage suffered\u201d.', '12\\u2003On 24 August 2021, Mr Wee applied for OS 667 to be converted into a writ. BIT Baltic objected to the application and the learned Assistant Registrar subsequently dismissed it on the basis that there was no substantial dispute of fact that would be better determined through a writ action. Mr Wee did not appeal against this decision. Although Mr Wee had submitted that OS 667 should have been converted to a writ because of the availability of processes such as discovery and cross examination of witnesses such as Dr Harren and Mr Harren, he did not thereafter apply for these procedures even though it was open for him to do so (see for example, O 24 r 1(1) and O 28 r 4(4) of the Rules of Court 2014).', '13\\u2003On 23 December 2021, two months before the hearing of OS 667, HPS and HARPA repaid the Principal Sum in full to BIT Baltic.

He maintained that he had acted in good faith in the conduct of BIT Baltic\u2019s affairs. He described himself as \u201ca nominee director of [BIT Baltic], and a person of limited means\u201d. In the alternative, Mr Wee submitted that even if he were found to have breached his duties, the principle of restitution ought to apply to the Interest Claim. As such, the applicable rate of interest should only be the then-prevailing fixed deposit interest rate to which BIT Baltic would have been entitled \u2013 that of 0.8% per annum.

{"casename":"2023_SGCA_18","fact":"5\\u2003The applicant pleaded guilty to four charges on 22 September 2016.

Of the four charges taken into consideration, three pertained to sexual offences committed by the applicant against the same victim, consisting of one count of rape, one count of digital-vaginal penetration and one count of penile-oral penetration. The last charge was for the possession of obscene films.', '7\\u2003The full facts of the proceeded charges are set out in Lim Choon Beng (HC). In brief, the applicant raped and sexually assaulted the victim, a Chinese national who was then 24 years old, successively at three locations along public roads in February 2013. The applicant approached the victim while she was walking home by herself and spoke to her. When the victim did not reply and walked away, he grabbed her buttocks. She pushed him away and continued walking. A while later, the applicant grabbed her shoulders and pushed her backwards. When the victim fell, he sat on her lower body. He then pulled at her dress, pulled down her bra, grabbed her left breast and kissed it. This was the subject of the OM Charge.', '8\\u2003On seeing some cars passing by, the applicant got off the victim and pulled her across the street. He hit her head against a wall and then pinned her to the ground. He then penetrated the victim\u2019s vagina with his penis even though she had informed him that she was having her menses. This was the subject of the first Rape Charge.', '9\\u2003After some time, the applicant withdrew his penis and put on his trousers. The applicant told the victim that he wanted to bring her home. In a bid to seek help from the security guard in her apartment building, the victim told the applicant that they could go to her home instead. When they reached a grass patch, the applicant suddenly pinned the victim to the ground. He inserted his penis forcefully into her mouth. After some time, the applicant inserted his penis into her vagina. This was the subject of the second Rape Charge and the Penile-Oral Charge.', '10\\u2003The applicant only stopped when a taxi stopped near them. As the applicant stood up to wear his trousers, the victim managed to escape to seek help.', '11\\u2003In respect of each of the charges, the Judge imposed the following sentences:', '(a)\\u2003For the OM Charge, 30 months\u2019 imprisonment and four strokes of the cane.', '(b)\\u2003For the Penile-Oral Charge, three years, ten months and two weeks\u2019 imprisonment and four strokes of the cane.', '(c)\\u2003For each of the two Rape Charges, 13 years\u2019 imprisonment and seven strokes of the cane.', 'The Judge ordered the imprisonment terms for the First Rape Charge and the Penile-Oral Charge to run consecutively. The total sentence was therefore 16 years, ten months and two weeks\u2019 imprisonment and 22 strokes of the cane.', '12\\u2003For each of the Rape Charges, the Judge considered (a) the relevant aggravating and mitigating factors; (b) three sentencing precedents, one of which was the decision in Chang Kar Meng (HC); (c) the four charges taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing and (d) the totality principle. It was only in this context that the Judge considered Chang Kar Meng (HC) to be comparable to the applicant\u2019s case given the similarities between the two cases (such as the commission of the offences in public and near the victim\u2019s residence) and the aggravating factors.', '13\\u2003The applicant appealed against his sentence. On 29 November 2016, the Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal with the following oral judgment:', '14\\u2003Chang Kar Meng (CA) was heard on 16 August 2016 and the judgment was delivered on 30 March 2017. In Chang Kar Meng (CA), the Court of Appeal reduced the aggregate sentence imposed in Chang Kar Meng (HC) from 17 years\u2019 imprisonment to 15 years\u2019 imprisonment. As mentioned earlier, in Chang Kar Meng (HC), the accused pleaded guilty to one charge of rape and one charge of robbery with hurt. A sentence of 12 years\u2019 imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane was imposed for the offence of rape whereas a sentence of 5 years\u2019 imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane, which was the mandatory minimum sentence, was imposed for the offence of robbery with hurt. The imprisonment term of the two sentences were ordered to run consecutively, giving rise to the aggregate sentence of 17 years\u2019 imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane.', '15\\u2003The Court of Appeal in Chang Kar Meng (CA) reduced the aggregate imprisonment term on the basis that the prevailing sentences imposed for cases involving the offences of rape and robbery ranged from 11 to 15 years. The Court of Appeal accepted that the aggregate sentence of 17 years\u2019 imprisonment, while not manifestly excessive, was out of line with the relevant precedents and the sentences meted out in previous cases with broadly similar circumstances. The Court of Appeal also accepted that the appellant in that case should be entitled to rely on the existing sentencing range and saw no basis for ignoring the appellant\u2019s legitimate expectations, having regard to the general range of sentences imposed in similar cases involving both rape and robbery.', '16\\u2003The Court of Appeal therefore reduced the aggregate sentence to 15 years\u2019 imprisonment by reducing the imprisonment term for the rape charge from 12 years to ten years. The Court of Appeal made it clear at [76] that moving forward, offenders convicted of rape and robbery should not expect to benefit from similar leniency and a sentence of 17 years\u2019 imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane would not, in similar circumstances, be treated as manifestly excessive."}

From time to time, they engaged in quarrels over WhatsApp. For example, on 7 December 2016, the following exchange took place between 7.22pm and 8.06pm (quoted verbatim):', '12\\u2003However, the evening after this exchange, V and BWJ conversed normally in their messages, making arrangements to meet each other for dinner before BWJ went to work a night shift and after V finished her own workday. We highlight this example to illustrate that, during this period of their relationship, although V and BWJ may have quarrelled on occasion, it was evident from their exchanges subsequent to those arguments that their relationship continued. This was so until around April or May 2017, when there appeared to be a palpable shift in the character of their exchanges over WhatsApp. To appreciate this shift, it is useful to contrast their communications and the state of their relationship from the earlier part of 2017.', '13\\u2003In January 2017, V and BWJ were still messaging each other actively over WhatsApp. For example, on 17 January 2017, when BWJ was in Malaysia visiting his family, V was the first to send a morning greeting to BWJ after she woke up at 6.53am. That afternoon, BWJ was scheduled to return to Singapore and V sent him several messages to check if he had reached the airport and whether \u201ceverything\u201d was alright. In fact, when asked by BWJ if she wanted to pick him up from the airport, she responded \u201cyeah\u201d and asked him to confirm the arrival terminal.', '14\\u2003In February 2017, BWJ was retrenched from his job in Singapore. As a result, his work permit was cancelled. He was therefore unable to remain in Singapore for extended periods of time and could only do so on social visit passes. Nevertheless, during the periods when BWJ had to return to Malaysia, he and V continued to communicate almost daily on WhatsApp. In fact, their messages near the end of February 2017 showed them expressing affection for each other. On the night of 27 February 2017, V sent a loving emoji to BWJ before saying \u201cNightzz\u201d to him. BWJ then responded, \u201cOkok gd nite baby I love you\u201d.', '15\\u2003In March 2017, V visited BWJ and his family in Ipoh. While there, they took a short trip to the Cameron Highlands and it was not disputed that they had sexual intercourse during that trip. According to V, that was the last time she and BWJ had consensual sex. It was therefore clear from V\u2019s evidence that their relationship had not ended in March 2017.', '16\\u2003However, by April 2017, tension in their relationship began to build up. According to V, the tension arose because of BWJ\u2019s constant demands to know where she was and what she was doing. During her examination-in-chief, V testified that BWJ\u2019s calls and messages were a \u201cdisturbance\u201d and that he would often call her while she was at work and assert that she was \u201cwith someone else\u201d. This was supported by the content and the tone of BWJ\u2019s messages. For example, on 21 April 2017, the following messages were exchanged from around 7.05pm to 8.05pm, while V was out at dinner with her cousins (quoted verbatim):', '17\\u2003BWJ continued messaging the complainant incessantly from 9.13pm on 21 April 2017 to 1.05am on 22 April 2017. During this time, he demanded that she inform him about her location and he also insisted that she return home to the Flat. Their exchange read (quoted verbatim):', '18\\u2003Unlike their quarrels in 2016 which would abate and then their conversations would return to a normal tone, the quarrels which they had during this time indicated a marked deterioration in their relationship. Although V gave evidence that she still referred to BWJ as her \u201cboyfriend\u201d in May 2017 and travelled with him to Kuala Lumpur to attend a friend\u2019s wedding, she also testified that, during the trip, she rejected BWJ\u2019s request to have sexual intercourse. By the end of May 2017, she had asked him to move out of the master bedroom of the Flat because she wanted to \u201cstop the relationship\u201d.', '19\\u2003The fact that their romantic relationship had essentially ended by this time was also evident from the messages that they exchanged. As mentioned earlier, BWJ lost his job in February 2017 and was unable to remain in Singapore for extended periods of time. Following a visit to Singapore on a social visit pass, on the night of 28 June 2017, when BWJ returned to Malaysia by bus, V did not see him off. This was despite the fact that he had overstayed his social visit pass and would not be able to return to Singapore for at least 30 days. Around 9.00pm, he messaged her, \u201cOk I\u2019m going out now I know u won\u2019t come and see me take care\u201d. At 9.49pm, he messaged, \u201cAt least reply me la or call me say bye to me\u201d. At 10.40pm, he messaged, \u201cIt\u2019s ok la I\u2019m really sad I won\u2019t disturb u anymore I leave my heart n my soul here in Singapore only body is going to Ipoh\u201d. V did not reply to any of these parting messages.', '20\\u2003Although V responded to BWJ\u2019s further messages later, her replies were generally terse or monosyllabic. Moreover, for an unbroken stretch of more than ten days from 21 July 2017 at around 9.00pm to the end of 1 August 2017, she ignored about 100 messages received from BWJ. At the appeal hearing, the Prosecution clarified that BWJ did not allege, nor was there evidence, that V did not respond to BWJ\u2019s messages for some other reason, such as her mobile phone was not in working condition. The clear inference, from V\u2019s total lack of response to his numerous messages, was that their romantic relationship had already ended by this time.', '21\\u2003On 2 August 2017, without informing V in advance, BWJ returned to Singapore and let himself into the Flat using his spare key. There was no dispute that V was not expecting his return. On BWJ\u2019s own evidence, she was \u201cshocked\u201d to see him in the Flat that day. He claimed that he returned to Singapore to celebrate V\u2019s birthday which was in the second half of the month. However, there was no evidence that V was pleased to see him or that she responded to his sudden presence with warmth, something which would have been expected if they were still lovers who had just been reunited after having been apart for more than a month. On the contrary, over the next three days, V avoided and ignored BWJ, even leaving the Flat on 4 and 5 August 2017 to stay with her aunt.', '22\\u2003In the morning of 3 August 2017, BWJ sent a message to V to remind her to eat breakfast and not to work on an empty stomach. This message was ignored and, 20 minutes later, he implored V to respond to his messages at least \u201cfor courtesy\u201d. BWJ sent a few more messages that day but V did not respond.', '23\\u2003On 4 August 2017, BWJ asked V if they could have dinner together. V declined, stating that she was having dinner with her parents. She also told him that she was unlikely to return to the Flat as she would be staying with her aunt.', '24\\u2003The next day, BWJ repeated his request to have dinner with V, to which she replied curtly, \u201cI\u2019ll b late\u201d. Thereafter, V ignored BWJ\u2019s further messages in which he asked about her parents and whether she had eaten dinner.', '25\\u2003It was obvious by this time that BWJ\u2019s return to Singapore did nothing to help improve the dismal state of his relationship with V. Her coldness and indifference towards him despite his many gestures showed that she regarded their relationship as having ended and she was not interested at all in reviving it.', '26\\u2003On the night of 4 August 2017, V informed BWJ that her parents would be visiting the Flat and that when they did so, he was to \u201cexcuse [himself]\u201d. On V\u2019s evidence, her parents were visiting the Flat to collect some of her unused belongings and transport them to Malacca. This was with a view to helping her move out of the Flat when the lease expired in November 2017. V followed this up in the morning of 6 August 2017, when she sent the following terse message to BWJ: \u201cWe r [on the way], Pls excuse yourself\u201d. Shortly after noon, BWJ asked V whether he could return to the Flat. Eventually, she responded that she and her parents had left the Flat, thereby indicating that he was free to do so.', '27\\u2003Sometime around 1.00pm, V returned to the Flat alone. She testified that BWJ was sitting on the sofa in the living room and asked to speak with her. He proceeded to ask V where she intended to move to when the lease on the Flat expired in November 2017. As V did not wish to answer this question, she stood up and walked to the master bedroom to continue packing her things in preparation for her move out of the Flat. BWJ followed her into the bedroom and continued to ask her questions. V\u2019s mobile phone sounded and she looked at the message received. This angered BWJ, who snatched the phone to check whom she was communicating with. When V asked for her phone to be returned, BWJ slapped her and suddenly ripped her T-shirt and brassiere off. He covered her mouth when she attempted to shout for help, strangled her and said to her in Malay, \u201cnow you die\u201d. When she grew faint, he took off her shorts and her underwear. At this point, V told BWJ that she was menstruating and begged him not to continue. However, BWJ ignored her pleas and inserted his penis into her vagina. This lasted for around one or two minutes before BWJ withdrew his penis and ejaculated onto V\u2019s stomach.', '28\\u2003Before we turn to what happened next, we set out BWJ\u2019s version of the events on 6 August 2017. In BWJ\u2019s first statement to the police dated 8 August 2017, he claimed that after he followed V into the master bedroom of the Flat, he hugged her from her right side. She then turned to face him and stepped backwards, which caused him to release his hug. BWJ then \u201cstretched out [his] right hand to grab [V\u2019s] T-shirt by [the] collar\u201d because he wanted to pull her back towards him so as to hug her. BWJ claimed that as a result of this, V\u2019s T-shirt ripped. Next, according to BWJ, V attempted to \u201cshout that she want[ed] to go out\u201d but he used his right hand to cover her mouth. After that, she acquiesced to having sex with him and did not resist.', '29\\u2003We use the word \u201cacquiesced\u201d here because, even on BWJ\u2019s own account, V did not consent expressly. In his second statement to the police, in response to the question, \u201cDid [V] consent to the sex\u201d, BWJ answered, \u201cI do not know. As she did not say [n]o. She did not say yes also\u201d. He repeated this position in his fourth statement to the police as well as in his testimony in cross-examination:', '30\\u2003At this point, we focus on the movements which caused V\u2019s T-shirt to rip. In his second statement to the police, BWJ stated that he believed he \u201cused force\u201d when he pulled V\u2019s T-shirt but he did not do so with an intention to hurt her as he loved her. The apparent lack of an intention to cause hurt suggested that he probably did not use much force. In his fourth statement, BWJ stated that when he grabbed V\u2019s T-shirt by the collar, it only tore \u201ca bit at the ne[ck] area\u201d. However, during his examination-in-chief, BWJ testified that he did not see a tear in the T-shirt. He only heard a tearing sound which caused him to let go. We reproduce his evidence on this point when questioned by his Defence Counsel, Ms Chia:', '31\\u2003BWJ testified that he did not see any tear in V\u2019s T-shirt although the tear was extensive. An image of the torn T-shirt is reproduced below:', '32\\u2003At the first appeal hearing on 13 September 2022, the Prosecution showed us the T-shirt which had been tendered as an exhibit during the trial. Even on a quick view of the T-shirt, it was plain that the damage was very extensive. As we have indicated with red lines in the photograph above, the front of the T-shirt was ripped across practically the entire collar and almost all the way down the wearer\u2019s right side.', '33\\u2003The obvious incompatibility of BWJ\u2019s account of the sexual encounter with the objective evidence also featured in his description of how he removed her brassiere prior to the sexual intercourse. In BWJ\u2019s first statement to the police, he asserted that after he hugged V and caused the tear in her T-shirt, they lay on the bed and started kissing. BWJ also gave V two or three love bites on her neck. While they were lying down, BWJ claimed that he unhooked V\u2019s brassiere in a normal manner. During his examination-in-chief, BWJ maintained the position that he did not use any force when he removed V\u2019s brassiere:', '34\\u2003Again, contrary to BWJ\u2019s evidence, the brassiere was quite obviously damaged, indicating some rough action during the sexual encounter on 6 August 2017. At the trial, the Prosecution led evidence from Ms Sherni Koh Peck Chu (\u201cMs Koh\u201d), an HSA analyst engaged to examine V\u2019s T-shirt and brassiere and to conduct tests to determine the types of motions which could have caused the sort of damage that the clothing items sustained. Ms Koh described the precise damage caused to each item of clothing. She identified the damage to the brassiere as follows:', '35\\u2003The photographs below show V\u2019s brassiere damaged fastening system:', '36\\u2003These images revealed that at least some force must have been used to remove V\u2019s brassiere. During Ms Chia\u2019s cross-examination of Ms Koh, she took issue only with the experimental method used to recreate and identify the type of motions which could have caused the sort of damage sustained. Ms Chia did not suggest to Ms Koh that her assessment of the damage done to the brassiere was incorrect.', '37\\u2003We now return to V\u2019s account of the events after BWJ had ejaculated onto her stomach. BWJ proceeded to clean himself up. While he was doing so, V told him that she was experiencing extreme abdominal pains and begged him to take her to a doctor. BWJ initially refused and accused her of lying so that she could escape. There was blood on the mattress. Eventually, he relented after she continued to plead with him. At this point, BWJ helped V to wash up and to get dressed. Before leaving the Flat, BWJ apparently took her wallet, mobile phone and house keys. He then took her to a nearby clinic called \u201cUniHealth 24-Hr Clinic\u201d (the \u201cClinic\u201d).', '38\\u2003At the Clinic, V spoke to two persons who testified at the trial. The first was Foo Yi Sing (\u201cMs Foo\u201d), a clinic assistant. Ms Foo testified that V entered the Clinic around 1.30pm on 6 August 2017, with BWJ supporting her. Ms Foo observed that V had a \u201cdeep reddening around the front of her neck\u201d and that she seemed to be in a \u201clot of pain\u201d. Ms Foo came to this conclusion because V was holding her stomach and trembling as she sat in the waiting area. Given the state in which V appeared to be, Ms Foo asked V to enter the consultation room ahead of another patient who had arrived earlier.', '39\\u2003The second person to whom V spoke was the doctor in the consultation room, Dr Jason Tan (\u201cDr Tan\u201d). On Dr Tan\u2019s account, after V entered the consultation room, he saw that she was experiencing lower abdominal pains. He asked her whether they were menstrual pains and V denied that they were. He then offered her an injection to ease the pain but she declined. Dr Tan testified that, at this point, V became agitated, broke into tears and informed him that she had been sexually assaulted by BWJ. Dr Tan offered to refer her to KK Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Hospital for a formal examination and to receive proper treatment. He also directed Ms Foo to call the police. At that point, BWJ walked out of the consultation room.', '40\\u2003After BWJ had left and after Ms Foo had called the police but before the police arrived, Dr Tan conducted a more \u201cfocussed examination\u201d of V and noted a two-to-three-centimetre bruise at the front of her neck. V informed him that the bruise was sustained by strangulation and Dr Tan was of the view that the appearance of the bruise was consistent with V\u2019s explanation. However, he did not make any assessment that the bruise was caused by strangulation.', '41\\u2003Ms Foo\u2019s evidence was broadly consistent with Dr Tan\u2019s in respect of these events. On Ms Foo\u2019s account, it was also after V had declined Dr Tan\u2019s offer to administer a pain-relieving injection that she said in Mandarin that BWJ had raped her. BWJ then attempted to take V out of the consultation room but V did not follow him. Upon hearing this exchange, Ms Foo asked BWJ to wait outside the consultation room. He was initially hesitant but subsequently complied. Before he left the room, V told him to hand over her mobile phone. He did so and then left the Clinic. Ms Foo then called the police and reported that V\u2019s modesty had been outraged, not that she had been raped. She made the report in that manner although her clear recollection was that V had said that she was raped.', '42\\u2003Ms Foo explained that Dr Tan had instructed her to report to the police in that manner because he had not conducted any medical examination to ascertain if V had actually been raped. However, when Dr Tan was cross-examined on this point, he stated that he did not inform Ms Foo what to report to the police. There was therefore at least some uncertainty regarding what V actually informed Dr Tan and Ms Foo at the Clinic.', '43\\u2003There were also differing accounts as to whether BWJ had V\u2019s mobile phone with him and, therefore, whether he handed it to V before leaving the Clinic or whether he had to return to the Flat to get the mobile phone before returning to the Clinic to hand it to V. The more general questions which arose from these discrepancies were whether BWJ returned to the Clinic and, if so, how he behaved when he did.', '44\\u2003The first account was that of Ms Foo. As stated earlier, Ms Foo testified that BWJ handed over V\u2019s mobile phone before leaving the Clinic. She also stated that he later returned with a \u201cblack haversack\u201d but V did not wish to see him. Ms Foo then told BWJ to take a seat but he left to \u201cget a drink\u201d and did not return thereafter. The police then arrived and interviewed V.', '45\\u2003Second, V testified that BWJ brought her mobile phone to the Clinic. She further testified that after she informed Dr Tan that she was raped by BWJ, Dr Tan directed Ms Foo to call the police and BWJ left the Clinic upon being \u201cchased out\u201d by V. He returned with her mobile phone and left it with Ms Foo at the reception counter of the Clinic. Ms Foo handed it to V and V then waited for the police to arrive.', '46\\u2003BWJ\u2019s account was different. During his examination-in-chief, BWJ testified that while Dr Tan was examining V in the consultation room, BWJ touched her shoulder. This caused V to shout at him not to touch her and to get away from her. BWJ was confused by this and asked V why she was acting in that manner. In response, V demanded that BWJ hand over her mobile phone and wallet or that he call her aunt, failing which she would call the police. BWJ stated that he did not have V\u2019s mobile phone with him. He had only his own phone and both their wallets. He therefore went back to the Flat to get V\u2019s mobile phone from the master bedroom and placed it in a backpack alongside a pair of pants and two shirts which he planned to use while staying at his \u201cfriend\u2019s house\u201d as V was \u201c[m]aybe angry or whatever\u201d. After that, he returned to the Clinic. The police had not arrived yet. BWJ entered the Clinic and handed V\u2019s phone and wallet directly to her in the consultation room. V then yelled at BWJ again to \u201cgo away\u201d and he left the consultation room. Ms Foo asked him to take a seat but he informed her that he was going to buy a drink and that he would return shortly. After BWJ bought his drink, he wanted to return to the Clinic. However, he saw that the police had arrived and, out of a general fear of the authorities, he stood about one block away for an hour or two. After that, he went to a carpark nearby and sat in a stairwell until about 8.00pm.', '47\\u2003Although these accounts differed in their details, the differences were not material ones. Ms Foo\u2019s recollection that BWJ handed over V\u2019s mobile phone before leaving the Clinic was, in all likelihood, an error. Both V and BWJ stated that BWJ had to retrieve V\u2019s phone from the Flat and this explained why he returned to the Clinic with a backpack. The fact that Ms Foo remembered BWJ returning to the Clinic with a \u201cblack haversack\u201d was consistent with this.', '48\\u2003However, Ms Foo, V and BWJ\u2019s accounts were consistent on the following points. First, BWJ took V to the Clinic but was asked by her to leave and to hand over her mobile phone. Second, BWJ left the Clinic and returned soon thereafter. Lastly, BWJ left the Clinic a second time before the police arrived and he did not return to the Clinic at all after that. These points established a clear basis from which certain inferences could be drawn. For example, the reason why V asked BWJ in a discourteous manner to leave the Clinic although he had taken her there upon her request and why BWJ did not return to the Clinic after the police arrived and had to resort to watching the Clinic from a distance, despite knowing that someone he claimed he loved was unwell and still in the Clinic.', '49\\u2003Further and stronger inferences may be drawn from the numerous messages that BWJ sent to V, not long after he left the Clinic the second time and did not return. These messages showed that BWJ was begging V not to file a police report against him. On 6 August 2017, from 2.00pm to around midnight, he sent her 50 messages to which V did not reply. We set out a few of these messages to show their tone and content:', '50\\u2003On 7 August 2017, BWJ continued sending similar messages to V from 2.24am to 6.44pm. Again, it is useful to set out some of these messages to show the state of mind that BWJ was in at that time:', '51\\u2003It can be seen from these messages that BWJ did not say why he thought V would file a police report against him. At the trial, he maintained that he did not know why she would contemplate doing so. During cross-examination, he ventured a guess that she was angry at him and that it could have been due to him having torn her T-shirt. However, BWJ was not able to provide any credible explanation for V\u2019s outburst at him at the Clinic, why she would be filing a police report against him, why he was so fearful of arrest over the tearing of her T-shirt and why he sent all those desperate-sounding messages to her after having had allegedly consensual sex with her recently. The most that he could state, in the abstract, was that he was afraid of the impact which a police report against him would have on his life and future and that this was why he pleaded with V not to file a police report.', '52\\u2003While BWJ was pleading with V not to file a police report, he was also in contact with his family members. On 7 August 2017, around midnight, BWJ sent one of his nephews the following voice messages, which were translated and transcribed as follows:', '53\\u2003Later that day, BWJ sent the following three voice messages to another nephew:', '54\\u2003We now return to the events from V\u2019s perspective, after BWJ left the Clinic the second time and did not return. The police arrived at the Clinic not long thereafter. The first officer to arrive was Senior Staff Sergeant Muhammad Taufiq Bin Rosli (\u201cSSS Taufiq\u201d). He testified that when he arrived at the Clinic, he saw that V was teary. When he attempted to interview her, she was also visibly uncomfortable. SSS Taufiq therefore requested the presence of a female officer.', '55\\u2003Inspector Teng Yin Hang (\u201cINSP Teng\u201d) arrived at the Clinic shortly thereafter. She observed that V was in distress and crying. INSP Teng\u2019s interview at this point was brief. She recounted it as follows during examination-in-chief:', '56\\u2003At around 4.00pm, SSS Taufiq and INSP Teng escorted V to a police post nearby to be interviewed formally. On the way, V contacted a neighbour and close friend who regarded V as a goddaughter. V informed her that she was strangled and raped by BWJ. V also told this neighbour that she was afraid to return to the Flat as BWJ might be there and that she would find somewhere else to stay for the night. This neighbour asked V to meet her after she concluded her interviews with the police.', '57\\u2003At around 5.00pm, V was interviewed by Station Inspector Muhammad Azhari Bin Mohamad Said (\u201cSI Azhari\u201d). Three points arose from this interview. First, V stated that her relationship with BWJ \u201cturned sour\u201d after his retrenchment in February 2017 and that they \u201ceventually\u201d broke up, although she did not specify when. Second, she informed SI Azhari that while in the Flat, BWJ slapped her face, ripped her shirt and brassiere off, held her down on the bed and covered her mouth to muffle her shouting for help. BWJ then began to remove her shorts and underwear. When she tried to stop him, he strangled her until she was unable to breathe. She tapped him to stop and he did but she felt weak and dizzy as a result. V said she told BWJ that her abdomen was in great pain and that she wanted to go to the Clinic. Despite the fact that the encounter she described to SI Azhari seemed to be leading up to a sexual offence, V did not inform him that BWJ raped her. Finally, V also told SI Azhari that she told Ms Foo at the Clinic that she was \u201cbeaten\u201d, not that she was raped.', '58\\u2003V\u2019s interview with SI Azhari concluded around 6.00pm. After that, he, V and a police photographer went to the Flat in search of BWJ. In the Flat, SI Azhari found and seized V\u2019s torn T-shirt and damaged brassiere. Photographs were also taken of V, in particular, the bruising on her neck, the torn T-shirt and damaged brassiere, as well as the Flat.', '59\\u2003The police gave V a referral and asked her to go to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (\u201cTTSH\u201d) to have a check-up for her injuries. She did so. At around 11.25pm that evening, she was examined by Dr Man Shiu Yuen under the supervision of Dr Lee Chiao Hao (\u201cDr Lee\u201d). Dr Lee subsequently produced a medical report based on this examination stating that V had \u201csustained facial and neck contusions\u201d and was also seen to have bruises on her neck.', '60\\u2003On 7 August 2017, one day after the sexual incident, V met her godmother at the latter\u2019s request. V showed her the bruising on her neck and again informed her that BWJ raped her, although she did not elaborate. That evening, around 10.00pm, V and her godmother went to the Flat to get V\u2019s clothing. When they arrived at the Flat, they noticed that the padlock used to secure the front gate had been changed. They also heard the ringing of a phone coming from within the Flat. They called the police, concerned that BWJ might be inside the Flat.', '61\\u2003The police arrived shortly thereafter and arrested BWJ who was inside the Flat. The police interviewed BWJ on 8, 12 and 15 August 2017. In the first statement he gave to the police, he stated that he had cut the previous padlock in order to enter the Flat.', '62\\u2003In the morning of 9 August 2017, the police asked V to attend a further examination at the obstetrics and gynaecology division of KK Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Hospital (\u201cKKH\u201d). This was for the purpose of examining her for injuries specifically relating to sexual assault. The examining physician was Dr Chuah Theng Theng (\u201cDr Chuah\u201d). During this examination, V informed Dr Chuah that the last time she had sexual intercourse was in November 2016 and described the incident on 6 August 2017 as an \u201cassault\u201d, not rape or sexual assault. She also told Dr Chuah that she was slapped, that her mouth was covered when she attempted to shout for help, that she was held down by her wrists and that she was strangled to the point of nearly fainting. Dr Chuah subsequently reported that V\u2019s physical state was generally unremarkable. No injuries were seen on her mouth and wrists at the time of consultation. Although bruises were seen on her neck and chest, they were \u201csuperficial injuries caused by trauma\u201d. Dr Chuah further noted that \u201cthe sizes of the bruises were small\u201d and that she did not see \u201cany finger mark[s] [on] the complainant\u2019s neck\u201d. Hence, she was \u201cunable to comment further on the cause of the bruise[s]\u201d."}
{"casename":"2023_SGCA_20","fact":"8\\u2003The NA is an LPG carrier registered in Surabaya, Indonesia. She is about 160m in overall length and 25.6m in breadth (beam). She was carrying about 59 tonnes of LPG at the material time, and indicated that she was carrying dangerous cargo by displaying an all round red light (in addition to the regulation masthead lights, sidelights and sternlights that both vessels were displaying). Her drafts at departure were 5.5m forward and 6.2m aft.', '9\\u2003The LP is a fully cellular container ship flying the Panama flag. She is the larger of the two vessels, measuring about 200m in overall length and 32.2m in breadth (moulded). She was laden with containers weighing around 17,200mt at the material time. For reasons that will become clearer later (at [66] and [170] below), it is relevant to note that the LP\u2019s drafts at departure were 8.54m forward and 8.65m aft.', '10\\u2003The primary means of position monitoring on both vessels were actual Standard Nautical Charts (SNC), and not Electronic Chart Display and Information System (ECDIS). Both vessels were using the British Admiralty Chart No 975 (26 April 2012 edition) (\u201cBA Chart 975\u201d) of the Strait.', '11\\u2003The collision occurred within the Strait, which is approximately 50nm long and passes between the northeast coast of Java and the island of Madura. Within the Strait, the weather was good and visibility was about six miles. There was a northerly current associated with the ebbing tide, which was about 1.22m high.', '12\\u2003The NA was on a voyage from Gospier jetty in Surabaya, to Kalbut at the eastern end of Java. She was thus travelling outbound on a northerly voyage, towards the Strait\u2019s northern entrance.', '13\\u2003The LP was on a voyage from the Evergreen container terminal in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, to Tanjung Perak in Surabaya. She was travelling inbound on a southerly voyage from the Strait\u2019s northern entrance.', '14\\u2003The vessels were thus on reciprocal courses within the Strait. This is illustrated in the following plot prepared by the respondent\u2019s experts, which shows the actual track taken by each vessel (with timestamps reflecting local time):', '15\\u2003The period of the voyage starting from 23:12 hours is most relevant to the collision. The vessels\u2019 tracks for this period have been mapped out by the appellant\u2019s experts using the vessels\u2019 automatic identification system (\u201cAIS\u201d) data (with the AIS heading data generated from each vessel\u2019s gyro compass):', '', '16\\u2003Objective evidence on the vessels\u2019 voyages was adduced in several forms. Apart from AIS data, the vessels\u2019 voyage data recorders (\u201cVDR\u201d) captured important information such as each vessel\u2019s speed, heading and rudder angle (\u201cVDR data tables\u201d). Conversations that took place in each vessel\u2019s wheelhouse and communications over VHF radio were also recorded. Most of these conversations took place in Bahasa Indonesia or Tagalog, but they have been translated and transcribed for the purposes of these proceedings.', '17\\u2003Additionally, each vessel was equipped with two sets of Automatic Radar Plotting Aid (\u201cARPA\u201d) radar, namely an X-Band and an S-Band radar. Screengrabs of the output from each vessel\u2019s X-Band radar were automatically captured and saved at 15s intervals. The accuracy of this data is undisputed. The respondent\u2019s navigation expert, Captain Keith Hart (\u201cCapt Hart\u201d), opined that any positional errors concerning the LP and the NA were at most of a few metres, and any timing errors, of a few seconds. As will be seen below, these radar screengrabs provide critical insight into the relative positions of both vessels with respect to the material events.', '18\\u2003We use this opportunity to sketch out some key aspects of the LP\u2019s radar, using this screengrab taken at 23:11:21 hours as an example:', '(a)\\u2003The radar was set to north-up mode with relative motion, and a 3nm range.', '(b)\\u2003The green echo enclosed by a dashed circle is the LP. The green echo identified as \u201cAIS14\u201d (in this instance) is the NA.', '(c)\\u2003The thin white line (annotated in green) is the LP\u2019s heading marker. This is also indicated at the top right-hand corner of the screengrab, and is 202.3 in this instance.', '(d)\\u2003The thick white line (annotated in blue) is the LP\u2019s projected vector (based on a 6min projection). This is calculated using ARPA.', '(e)\\u2003The dashed white line (annotated in pink) is the LP\u2019s electronic bearing line (EBL1), which reflects the LP\u2019s planned change of heading. This is also indicated near the bottom right-hand corner of the screengrab, and is 209.8 in this instance.', '', '19\\u2003The Strait was marked by lateral buoys. Around the site of the collision, these were laid out in a staggered pattern. It is undisputed that the buoyed channel represented a narrow channel to which Rule 9 of the COLREGS applied. Under the Strait\u2019s buoyage system, northbound vessels were to keep the red lateral buoys on their starboard side, and southbound vessels were to keep such buoys on their port side.', '20\\u2003Within the buoyed channel was a dredged channel (the \u201cDredged Channel\u201d). Dredging works took place from 2014 to May 2015, to deepen part of the buoyed channel from 9.5m to up to 13m (chart datum), and to widen the width of this dredged section from 100m to 150m (this distance excludes slopes extending outwards on either side of the Dredged Channel). This is the section that appears mainly in green in the following overlaid chart:', '', '21\\u2003The dredging works were completed shortly before the collision and a post-dredging bathymetric survey was conducted from 18 June to 26 June 2015. In other words, the survey concluded just two days before the collision occurred on 28 June 2015. The BA Chart 975 used by both vessels did not reflect the Dredged Channel\u2019s post-dredging bathymetry. Nevertheless, the parties\u2019 navigation experts considered that the pilots on board both vessels would likely have been familiar with the dredged conditions.', '22\\u2003BA Chart 975 also reflected a two-way recommended track (the \u201cRecommended Track\u201d). There are no known local regulations mandating its use. The Recommended Track essentially ran along the centre of the Dredged Channel, such that the Dredged Channel extended about 75m on each side of the Recommended Track. As shown in the diagram at [15] above, the collision occurred to the west of the Recommended Track. The Recommended Track is reflected in that diagram by the grey dashed line with a pair of arrows pointing in opposite directions.', '23\\u2003A critical feature of this case is that minutes before the collision, the pilots of both vessels had reached an agreement on how the vessels were to pass each other \u2013 namely, port-to-port.', '24\\u2003Both vessels were under compulsory pilotage within the Strait, with pilots on board. There is no dispute that whereas pilots, as local experts, were permitted to give helm and engine orders and make passing arrangements, the masters were to retain overall command and responsibility during the transit under pilotage. Both parties accept that in apportioning liability, pilots are to be treated as part of their respective vessels. Neither pilot was offered as a witness at the trial below.', '25\\u2003At 23:12:15 hours, the LP\u2019s pilot asked the NA (over VHF radio) how their vessels ought to pass. Around this time, the vessels were about 2.9nm apart, and closing at a combined speed of about 29.5 knots. At 23:12:18 hours, the NA replied \u201cred-red\u201d. This was confirmed by the LP at 23:12:20 hours, which added at 23:12:23 hours \u201cok red-red, will prepare\u201d.', '26\\u2003At this stage, each vessel was on the port side of the other\u2019s course over ground (\u201cCOG\u201d) line. This is illustrated partly by the following screengrab from the LP\u2019s X-Band radar taken at 23:12:21 hours. To give effect to the port-to-port passing agreement, it would have been clear that both vessels needed to make course alterations to starboard.', '', '27\\u2003It should also be highlighted that the NA was already some distance to the west of the Recommended Track by this time (ie, by 23:12 hours). We will return to the significance of this at [177] and [193] below.', '28\\u2003Two minutes later, the vessels confirmed the port-to-port passing arrangement again at 23:14:20 and 23:14:37 hours. The LP added that she \u201cwill go to starboard a bit\u201d.', '29\\u2003Pursuant to the passing agreement, the pilots of both vessels ordered a series of course adjustments to starboard:', '(a)\\u2003The NA\u2019s pilot gave course orders of 035 (at 23:13:01 hours), 040 (at 23:13:46), 045 (at 23:14:41) and 048 (at 23:15:44).', '(b)\\u2003The LP\u2019s pilot gave course orders of 210 (at 23:12:37 hours), 215 (at 23:13:11), 218 (at 23:14:14), 220 (at 23:14:40), 222 (at 23:15:39), 223 (at 23:15:56) and 225 (at 23:16:23).', '30\\u2003The LP was also due to pass a tug-and-barge, the Tango Bravo (the \u201cTB\u201d), just a minute or so before the LP would pass the NA. The TB was heading northwest and was fine on the LP\u2019s starboard bow. The LP and the TB reached an agreement to pass starboard-to-starboard. This was first proposed by the LP, and agreed to by the TB, between 23:13:35 and 23:13:43 hours (ie, about a minute after the passing agreement between the NA and the LP was reached). The passing arrangement between the LP and the TB was confirmed again between 23:14:48 and 23:14:54 hours. The effect of the passing agreement with the TB was that the LP would be navigating in the narrow space between the TB (to the LP\u2019s starboard side) and the NA (to the LP\u2019s port side). It appears that the NA might have been aware of this: at 23:15:13 hours, the NA called the TB to ask her to move \u201cmore to port\u201d, and this request was acknowledged by the TB.', '31\\u2003The following screengrab from the LP\u2019s X-Band radar, taken at 23:13:36 hours, reflects the relative positions of the vessels when the starboard-to-starboard passing agreement was reached with the TB:', '', '32\\u2003The collision occurred at 23:17:51 hours, to the west of the Recommended Track (see the diagram at [15] above).', '33\\u2003Following the succession of course orders given by the LP\u2019s pilot up till 23:16:23 hours (outlined at [29(b)] above), the LP\u2019s pilot gave a \u201cmidships\u201d order at 23:16:40 hours and a \u201csteady\u201d order at 23:16:46 hours. However, instead of achieving a steady course, the LP began swinging to port towards the NA.', '34\\u2003This drew panicked reactions from the LP\u2019s pilot over the course of the following minute:', '(a)\\u2003At 23:16:49 hours, he could be heard instructing \u201csteady, bring to starboard, starboard, starboard\u201d. Based on the VDR data tables, the helmsman applied a starboard helm from 23:16:52 hours. (The LP\u2019s rudder achieved and maintained a rudder angle of 25 or higher to starboard from 23:16:58 hours. It was maintained at 35 to starboard from 23:17:08 hours.)', '(b)\\u2003At 23:16:55 hours, he attempted to ask the NA to \u201cmove to the right\u201d as \u201c[the LP\u2019s] steering [was] not responding\u201d. It is undisputed that this VHF communication does not appear to have been received by the NA.', '(c)\\u2003At 23:16:58 hours, he ordered \u201cfull to starboard\u201d.', '(d)\\u2003At 23:16:59, 23:17:04, 23:17:08, 23:17:12 and 23:17:15 hours, he repeatedly asked the NA to move further to starboard.', '(e)\\u2003At 23:17:17 hours, he repeated the order \u201cfull to starboard\u201d.', '(f)\\u2003At 23:17:20 hours, he ordered \u201cstop engine\u201d. Based on the VDR data tables, this was executed at 23:17:29 hours, at which time the LP\u2019s speed through water (\u201cSTW\u201d) was slightly above 14 knots.', '(g)\\u2003At 23:17:38 hours, he ordered \u201cfull astern\u201d. Based on the VDR data tables, the engine was put to half astern at 23:17:44 hours, at which time the LP\u2019s STW was close to 13.5 knots.', '(h)\\u2003At 23:17:49 hours, just 2 seconds prior to collision, he ordered \u201chard to starboard\u201d.', '35\\u2003What happened on board the NA was slightly less clear. Her VDR did not capture any VHF communications from at least 23:16:15 hours until 23:17:32 hours. The experts agree that the reason for this is unclear. Nonetheless, conversations in the NA\u2019s wheelhouse were picked up from 23:17:12 hours onwards. Crew members were plainly alarmed, drawing attention to \u201cthis ship in front\u201d (ie, the LP), commenting \u201cwhat is wrong with this ship\u201d, and warning \u201cwe will be hit\u201d. An order was given for the NA to be put hard to starboard, which was executed at 23:17:15 hours.', '36\\u2003The manoeuvres undertaken by both vessels ultimately failed to prevent the collision from occurring. By 23:17:30 hours, the vessels were only about 0.1nm apart and closing at a combined speed of about 28 knots. The vessels\u2019 initially uneventful voyages underwent a sea change with the port sheer, with the LP\u2019s heading changing from 222.9 at the time the sheer commenced at 23:16:46 hours, to 198.6 at the time of the collision at 23:17:51 hours (ie, she went to port by 24.3. At 23:17:51 hours, the LP\u2019s bow struck the NA\u2019s port side at an acute angle. The angle of the blow is illustrated in the AIS plot below:', '', '37\\u2003The actual impact of the blow is also captured in this photograph of the NA taken post-collision:', '38\\u2003Seconds after the collision occurred, the NA suffered a cargo fire and began drifting in a northerly direction. The LP moved astern to pull away, and the vessels separated by around 23:19 hours. The LP then proceeded on a northerly course that brought her beyond the western edge of the Dredged Channel."}

We do not propose to repeat these matters. It suffices for present purposes to focus on the points relevant to the Outstanding Issues.', '6\\u2003As the trial of the Suits was bifurcated, the Appeals only concerned the issue of liability and not damages. On the Control Failures Issue, we found that the Town Councillors and Employees had \u201cbreached their duty of care by permitting the \u2018control failures\u2019 to exist in the payment process\u201d (see the Judgment at [433]). Specifically, the involvement of conflicted persons for payments to FM Solutions & Services Pte Ltd (\u201cFMSS\u201d) and FM Solutions & Integrated Services (\u201cFMSI\u201d) and the absence of safeguards created an inherent risk of overpayment (see the Judgment at [450]\u2013[454]). This was not mere negligence because the Town Councillors were aware of Ms How\u2019s and Mr Loh\u2019s potential conflict of interest as early as 19 May 2011. In these circumstances, we found that the Town Councillors and Employees had been grossly negligent in this respect, and we accordingly rejected the Town Councillors\u2019 and Employees\u2019 contention that they had acted in good faith in implementing the System (see the Judgment at [452]\u2013[454]).', '7\\u2003As we explain below at [51], it is important to appreciate that the Suits were not consolidated. Rather, with the parties\u2019 consent, they were ordered to be tried together (see the Judgment at [7]). To put it another way, AHTC and STC ran independent cases, with independent causes of action, based on independent sets of pleadings. This was so, even though the claims in the Suits arose from a largely common factual substratum. As we observed in the Judgment at [65], AHTC\u2019s pleadings in Suit 668 were narrower than STC\u2019s pleadings in Suit 716."}

From around 2002 or 2003, Mr Bouvier and Mr Rybolovlev had a course of dealing that stretched over a decade in the course of which Mr Rybolovlev amassed a significant art collection which includes masterpieces by highly renowned artists such as Vincent van Gogh, Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Claude Monet and Leonardo da Vinci. The underlying dispute between the parties concerns Mr Bouvier\u2019s role in those dealings.', '4\\u2003The respondent in SUM 2 is Ms Tania Rappo (\u201cMs Rappo\u201d). Ms Rappo was close to the Rybolovlev family (though the extent of this closeness is the subject of dispute). She met Mr Rybolovlev in Geneva in either 1995 or 2000. She struck up a close friendship with Mr Rybolovlev\u2019s wife, and later became godmother to one of Mr Rybolovlev\u2019s children who was born in 2001.

Here, we summarise the key facts that are relevant to the Applications.', '7\\u2003As we have mentioned, Mr Bouvier was involved in Mr Rybolovlev\u2019s acquisition of artwork for over a decade starting in 2002 or 2003. The parties disagree as to the nature of each individual\u2019s respective role in the acquisition process. According to Mr Bouvier, Mr Rybolovlev had a clear idea of which art pieces he wished to acquire and was knowledgeable about the art market. He would therefore express interest in specific pieces of art, after which Mr Bouvier would locate the piece and acquire it from its owner. Mr Rybolovlev, through one of the respondents, would then purchase the piece from Mr Bouvier. Mr Bouvier\u2019s position is that he was at liberty to \u201con-sell\u201d the artwork to Mr Rybolovlev at a profit, with the profit margin being determined by what he considered to be the value of the art piece. To Mr Bouvier, the \u201cvalue\u201d of the art piece was essentially the price that Mr Rybolovlev was willing to pay.', '8\\u2003According to the respondents, however, Mr Bouvier was meant to act as Mr Rybolovlev\u2019s agent in sourcing and acquiring artwork. Mr Bouvier was believed to be able to acquire artwork at better prices given his expert knowledge and contacts from his business. The respondents claim that Mr Bouvier would first inform Mr Rybolovlev of an opportunity to purchase a particular artwork and provide advice on the price at which it could be obtained. Mr Rybolovlev and his representative would then give instructions as to the terms they found acceptable, and Mr Bouvier was then to negotiate the purchase with the owner in accordance with those terms. For his services, Mr Bouvier was only entitled to charge a commission calculated at 2% of the sale price.', '9\\u2003Over their long relationship, Mr Bouvier was involved in Mr Rybolovlev\u2019s acquisition of 38 pieces of art. For the purposes of the Applications, what is important is that six pieces of art were acquired between August 2003 and July 2007 (the \u201cCategory 1 Transactions\u201d), two were acquired between July 2007 and December 2007 (the \u201cCategory 2 Transactions\u201d), and 30 were acquired between February 2008 and September 2014 (the \u201cCategory 3 Transactions\u201d). The Applications concern only the Category 1 and Category 2 Transactions. For all of these transactions, Xitrans was the purchaser. This is why Accent is not involved in the Applications.', '10\\u2003Sometime towards the end of 2014, the relationship between Mr Bouvier and Mr Rybolovlev broke down. In December 2014, Mr Rybolovlev claims to have learned that the seller of one of the paintings that he had purchased had received US$93.5m by way of sales proceeds. Accent, however, had paid Mr Bouvier US$118m for that same painting. Mr Rybolovlev also discovered that another painting which he had purchased through Mr Bouvier for US$127.5m had been sold by its previous owner for between US$75m and US$80m. This led Mr Rybolovlev to believe that Mr Bouvier had been dishonestly inflating sale prices for much, or even all, of the artwork that he had purchased.', '11\\u2003On 9 January 2015, Swiss counsel for the respondents at the time (\u201cMs Bersheda\u201d) made a criminal complaint in Monaco against \u201c[Mr Bouvier] and any participant\u201d in the purchases. On 25 February 2015, when Mr Bouvier went to Mr Rybolovlev\u2019s residence in Monaco purportedly to discuss an outstanding payment, he was arrested. Ms Rappo was arrested on the same day. On 27 February 2015, Ms Bersheda wrote to the investigating judge of the criminal complaint and informed him that the respondents and Mr Rybolovlev\u2019s daughter, Ms Ekaterina Rybolovleva, wished to join the proceedings against Mr Bouvier and Ms Rappo as civil parties.', '12\\u2003On 12 March 2015, the respondents commenced Suit No 236 of 2015 (the \u201cSuit\u201d) in Singapore. In the Suit, the respondents alleged that Mr Bouvier had breached his fiduciary duties as their agent and committed the tort of deceit. The respondents also alleged that MEI Invest and Ms Rappo were liable for dishonest assistance and knowing receipt. They alleged that all the appellants conspired to wrongfully cause loss to them.', '13\\u2003On 15 April 2015, Mr Bouvier and MEI Invest applied for a stay of the proceedings in Singapore on two grounds: first, there was a lis alibi pendens in Monaco and second, Switzerland was the appropriate forum for the determination of the respondents\u2019 claims. On 22 April 2015, Ms Rappo made a similar application, on the grounds that both Monaco and Switzerland were more appropriate fora than Singapore.', '14\\u2003The appellants\u2019 stay applications were dismissed by a High Court Judge on 17 March 2016 (see Accent Delight International Ltd and another v Bouvier, Yves Charles Edgar and others [2016] 2 SLR 841). The Bouvier parties filed an appeal in CA\/CA 113\/2016 and Ms Rappo filed an appeal in CA\/CA 110\/2016 (collectively, the \u201cAppeals\u201d). We heard the Appeals on 1 March 2017.', '15\\u2003 On 18 April 2017, we allowed the Appeals for the reasons set out in the Stay Judgment. One key issue in the Appeals was whether Switzerland was a more appropriate forum than Singapore for the parties\u2019 dispute. For a number of reasons, we decided that Switzerland was clearly the more appropriate forum for the parties\u2019 dispute (see [68]\u2013[91] of the Stay Judgment).', '16\\u2003In response, the respondents argued that Switzerland was not available as a forum because, under the Swiss Federal Act on Private International Law of 18 December 1987 (the \u201cPILA\u201d), the Swiss courts did not have jurisdiction over the dispute. The parties called experts to testify on this issue. Ultimately, we preferred the view of the appellants\u2019 expert which was that the Swiss courts would have jurisdiction over the parties\u2019 dispute by virtue of the written undertakings of the appellants that they \u201crecognise and accept the jurisdiction of the civil courts of Geneva, Switzerland, in respect of any dispute in connection with the sale of artworks to [the respondents] and\/or any related transactions\u201d (the \u201cWritten Undertakings\u201d). We were satisfied that the Written Undertakings would \u201cprovide the Swiss courts with a firm footing on which to assume jurisdiction\u201d and that the language of these undertakings was \u201cbroad enough to encompass the claims\u201d brought by the respondents against the appellants (see [96] of the Stay Judgment). In response to a suggestion by the respondents\u2019 counsel that the Written Undertakings were not \u201cwide enough\u201d and that further challenges to the Swiss courts\u2019 jurisdiction could be expected, counsel for the Bouvier parties and counsel for Ms Rappo confirmed to the court that (see [97] of the Stay Judgment):', '17\\u2003We will refer to these oral undertakings as the \u201cFurther Undertakings\u201d.

In this criminal complaint, the respondents asserted their civil claims against Mr Bouvier and Ms Rappo pursuant to Art 119(2)(b) of the Swiss Code of Criminal Procedure. Under Swiss law, one who has suffered harm as a result of an alleged criminal offence may obtain civil compensation by attaching their civil action to the criminal proceedings.

The respondents objected to the discontinuance in a letter sent to the Swiss PP on 29 January 2021. They sent a further letter on 12 May 2021, stating that they would refer the matter to the Geneva Court of Appeal (\u201cGeneva CA\u201d) on the grounds of denial of justice unless the Swiss PP resumed the investigations. On 28 May 2021, the respondents filed such an application to the Geneva CA (the \u201cReferral\u201d).', '23\\u2003On 15 September 2021, the Swiss Criminal Proceedings were formally discontinued by the Swiss PP through the issuance of a \u201cDismissal Order\u201d.

By the time the Applications were filed in January 2023, however, the Category 2 Transactions also fell outside the 15-year limitation period. The parties agree that as a consequence of the Geneva CA\u2019s decision both the Category 1 Transactions and the Category 2 Transactions can no longer be investigated in the Swiss Criminal Proceedings.

He had come to meet a person known as Zainudin in order to sell him some drugs. Zainudin had been arrested by the Central Narcotics Bureau (the \u201cCNB\u201d) earlier that morning, and subsequently made arrangements with the appellant for the delivery of the drugs on the instructions of CNB officers. Upon his arrest, drugs were found in the appellant\u2019s possession as well as at his residence (the \u201cUnit\u201d). The drugs that were seized from the appellant and at the Unit were analysed by the Health Sciences Authority (the \u201cHSA\u201d) and found to contain not less than 39.71g of diamorphine.', '3\\u2003During the course of investigations, a total of eight statements were recorded from the appellant (collectively, the \u201cRecorded Statements\u201d) as follows:', '4\\u2003The appellant claimed trial to the following charge (the \u201cCharge\u201d):', '5\\u2003The appellant raised the defence of necessity, contending that he urgently needed money to pay for surgery that was needed by his wife, who is diabetic. He also challenged the integrity of the chain of custody of the drug exhibits. Further, while the appellant accepted that his statements had been given voluntarily, without threat, inducement or promise, he challenged the accuracy of parts of the Recorded Statements. For completeness, we note that the appellant also contended at trial that some of the drugs were for his own consumption but this was not accepted by the Judge, and the appellant did not pursue this on appeal.', '6\\u2003The Judge was satisfied that all three elements of the offence of trafficking in a controlled drug under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the MDA had been established beyond a reasonable doubt. Specifically, (a) the appellant was in possession of a controlled drug; (b) the appellant had knowledge of the nature of the drug; and (c) the appellant\u2019s possession of the controlled drug was for the purpose of trafficking which was not authorised (Judgment at [80]). In particular, the Judge noted that the appellant had identified the Drugs as \u201c[h]eroin and [i]ce\u201d in his First Contemporaneous Statement and \u201cice\u201d and \u201cpanas\u201d (the latter being the Malay word that the appellant used to refer to diamorphine), in the Fifth Long Statement (Judgment at [84]). Moreover, the Judge noted the appellant\u2019s admission in the First Contemporaneous Statement that he had procured \u201cpanas\u201d from one Rosli for the purpose of selling this to others for a profit. The Judge also noted the appellant\u2019s admissions in his Second and Third Long Statements, in which the appellant explained that he had started selling drugs because he needed money to meet his family\u2019s expenses in light of his wife\u2019s ill health and detailed how he had agreed to Rosli\u2019s suggestion that he sell \u201cpanas\u201d instead of \u201cice\u201d, apparently because this was more lucrative (Judgment at [88]).', '7\\u2003The Judge rejected the appellant\u2019s defences. In relation to the defence of necessity, the Judge noted the appellant\u2019s attempt to rely on the English case of R v Shayler [2001] 1 WLR 2206, but did not think this was of assistance because the defence of necessity is codified in s 81 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (the \u201cPenal Code\u201d). The Judge found that the appellant\u2019s wife\u2019s condition, \u201cthough grave\u201d, was not \u201cof such a nature and so imminent as to justify or excuse\u201d the appellant\u2019s actions, as would be required to invoke the defence under s 81 of the Penal Code. Further, the Judge reasoned that the appellant could not be said to have been acting in good faith when he deliberately sought out Rosli for supplies and actively approached customers to resell them. The Judge also observed that the appellant could have sought alternative ways to raise funds to pay for his wife\u2019s medical bills (Judgment at [142]\u2013[143]).', '8\\u2003The Judge also rejected the appellant\u2019s argument that there had been a break in the chain of custody of the drug exhibits. After examining the evidence relating to each step of the chain of custody of the drug exhibits, the Judge found that the Prosecution had established the integrity of the chain of custody in handling the drug exhibits and had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the drug exhibits analysed by the HSA were the same as those seized from the appellant at the time of his arrest and during the raid of the Unit (Judgment at [139]).', '9\\u2003Finally, the Judge rejected the appellant\u2019s argument that the Recorded Statements had been inaccurately recorded. The Judge observed that in the appellant\u2019s testimony in court, the admissions contained in the Recorded Statements had largely been maintained. The Judge found that the issues raised by the appellant pertaining to the Recorded Statements were \u201cnot serious\u201d and did not affect his admission to the various elements of the Charge (Judgment at [57]). The Judge accordingly convicted the appellant and imposed the death penalty which was mandated in the circumstances."}

Alternatively, Mr Ken Koh and\/or Mr Koh YK made the Representation without belief in its truth or recklessly. In reliance on the Representation, Ding Asset paid the Subscription Consideration to YKL and therefore suffered loss.', '(c)\\u2003The Defendants are liable for unlawful means conspiracy, as they had a common intention to injure and cause loss to Ding Asset by unlawful means.

It suffices to reproduce a brief summary of the salient facts.', '6\\u2003The appellant, Ethoz Capital Ltd (\u201cEthoz\u201d), is an excluded moneylender under the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188, 2010 Rev Ed) (\u201cMoneylenders Act\u201d).', '7\\u2003The first respondent, Im8ex Pte Ltd (\u201cIm8ex\u201d), is a privately held company. The second respondent, Mr Chua Soo Liang (\u201cMr Chua\u201d), is the sole director and shareholder of Im8ex. He is also the nephew of the third respondent, Mr Tan Meng Kim (\u201cMr Tan\u201d). It should be noted that Mr Tan was absent throughout the proceedings and remains unrepresented. For the purposes of this judgment, as all three respondents\u2019 interests are aligned, we will refer to them collectively as Im8ex.', '8\\u2003Ethoz lent sums of $1m, $3.15m and $2.15m to Im8ex under three loan facilities for a total principal sum of $6.3m (\u201cthe Prior Facilities\u201d). The Prior Facilities were for a term of 12 months, and their interest rate was between 6.25% to 6.5% per annum.', '9\\u2003The Prior Facilities were secured by mortgages over four different properties which we will refer to as \u201cthe Alexandra Property\u201d, \u201cthe Hoe Chiang Property\u201d, \u201cthe Bayshore Property\u201d which was Mr Chua\u2019s home, and \u201cthe Taman Permata Property\u201d which was Mr Tan\u2019s home (collectively, \u201cthe Properties\u201d). The Prior Facilities were also guaranteed by Mr Chua and Mr Tan.', '10\\u2003In July 2019, Ethoz and Im8ex began discussing the renewal of the Prior Facilities. This led to the signing of loan facilities that are the subject of the present appeal (\u201cthe Facilities\u201d). They were signed in November 2019 and January 2020. Like the Prior Facilities, these were secured by guarantees from Mr Chua and Mr Tan, and mortgages over the Properties. The total principal amount borrowed by Im8ex under all the Facilities was similarly $6.3m, but this amount had been split into four loans of, respectively: (a) $1.425m; (b) $1.725m; (c) $1m; and (d) $2.15m. As the terms of the Facilities are identical, we will refer to the amounts borrowed under them as \u201cthe Advance\u201d.', '11\\u2003As per Clauses 5(A) and 7(A), the Facilities were extended at an interest rate of 3.75% per annum, with instalment payments to be made every month over 15 years, ie, over 180 months. Schedule 3 of the Facilities set out the 180 instalment payments that Im8ex was obliged to make. These were equal instalment payments, made up of repayments of the Advance and interest payments.', '12\\u2003Importantly, Schedule 3 also included an amount termed \u201cTotal Interest\u201d which was the aggregate of all the interest payments and is the amount arrived at when the flat rate of 3.75% per annum is applied to the Advance.', '13\\u2003Significantly, Clause 7(B) provided that the Total Interest \u201cshall be deemed earned and accrued in full upon the drawdown of the Advance\u201d. Such a clause was, however, not present in the Prior Facilities.', '14\\u2003There are also several provisions relevant in the event that Im8ex defaults on payment:', '(a)\\u2003Clause 15 provides that if Im8ex defaults on payment, it will pay interest (\u201cDefault Interest\u201d) on such sums from its due date to the date that it is paid. Such interest is set at a rate of 0.0650% per day (\u201cthe Default Interest rate\u201d) and will be \u201ccalculated daily with monthly rests\u201d. Further, any unpaid Default Interest \u201cshall be added to the relevant outstanding amount on a monthly basis and shall itself bear interest\u201d at the Default Interest rate.', '(b)\\u2003Clause 5(A) provides that in default of payment of any of the instalments in Schedule 3, Ethoz \u201cmay treat the whole of [the Facilities] or the balance thereof \u2026 together with interest thereon and all other sums due and owing under this Agreement as immediately due and payable without any demand.\u201d', '(c)\\u2003Clause 14 provides that an event of default will occur if Im8ex does not pay any of the \u201csum[s] payable under [the Facilities] when due\u201d (as per Clause 14(A)(1)), and that this will entitle Ethoz to declare that \u201call amounts due and owing under [the Facilities], including the Advance and the Total Interest and any default interests \u2026 be immediately due and payable.\u201d', '15\\u2003Finally, under the Facilities, Im8ex can make prepayment of the Advance after six months from the date of drawdown. Clause 6(B) provides that such prepayment would include \u201cthe Advance and interest computed thereon in full\u201d, subject to conditions laid out in Clauses 6(B)(1)\u2013(5).', '16\\u2003Im8ex defaulted on payment within the first year of all the Facilities. Consequently, on 3 September 2020, Ethoz gave notice demanding immediate and full payment of the Advance and Total Interest, citing Clauses 5(A), 7(B) and 14(B) of the Facilities. They also sought delivery of vacant possession of the Properties.', '17\\u2003On 15 January 2021, Ethoz filed HC\/OS 30\/2021 (\u201cOS 30\u201d) which sought the following orders: first, that Mr Chua and Mr Tan deliver vacant possession of the Properties; and second, that Im8ex, Mr Chua and Mr Tan jointly and severally pay Ethoz the Advance, Total Interest, and Default Interest due under the Facilities.', '18\\u2003Im8ex resisted OS 30, making broad assertions of \u201cunconscionable interest\u201d and \u201cunfair terms\u201d. It also asserted that Ethoz had misrepresented the terms of the Facilities, and further, that Ethoz did not fully advise it on how the Total Interest worked.', '19\\u2003OS 30 was heard by an assistant registrar (\u201cthe AR\u201d) on 5 April 2021. Three days later, the AR gave his decision, finding for Ethoz."}
{"casename":"2023_SGCA_30","fact":"Factual Background\n6 We now recount the facts leading to the SAP offences as they appear \nfrom the evidence adduced in the High Court. These offences involved three \nstudents enrolled in institutes of technical education. To protect their identities, \nthese students are referred to as V1 (16 years old), V2 (17 years old) and \nV3 (17 years old) and collectively as \u201cthe Victims\u201d.\n7 The appellant and the Victims resided in the same neighbourhood. The \nVictims often met at a hut (\u201cthe Hut\u201d) in their neighbourhood, together with \nanother friend \u2013 the fourth victim (\u201cV4\u201d) (15 years old). Around 2017, \nV4 introduced the appellant to the Victims and the appellant began to meet the \nVictims at the Hut. At these meetings, the appellant would drink beer and smoke \ncigarettes. Whenever they met up, the appellant was friendly with the Victims \nand he would often tell them about his past experiences and give them his views \non various topics. The Victims alleged that the appellant also revealed his past \nas an ex-convict, a gang member and his involvement in rioting with a large \ngroup of people. The Victims viewed the appellant with respect, and saw him \nas a close friend and even thought of him as a \u201cbig brother\u201d.\n8 Prior to 17 October 2018, V2, V3 and V4 were members of a gang. \nWhen they wanted to leave the gang, they asked the appellant to help them to \nVersion No 3: 05 Oct 2023 (12:53 hrs)\nMustapah bin Abdullah v PP[2023] SGCA 30\n4do so. The appellant testified that he had helped them to leave the gang by \nnegotiating with the headman of the gang.\nMeeting on 17 October 2018\n9  Sometime before 17 October 2018, a rumour circulated amongst the \nVictims that the appellant had made a fifth victim suck his penis. Because of \nthis, the Victims decided to avoid the appellant. V1 testified that he distanced \nhimself from the appellant as he was worried that he would be made to perform \na similar act on the appellant. The appellant was upset and angry when he found \nout that this rumour was being spread and he wanted to confront the Victims \nabout it.\n10 On 17 October 2018, just after midnight, the appellant called V1 and \nasked him to meet the appellant at the fitness corner near the Hut. During the \ncall, the appellant spoke to V1 in a serious tone and threatened to \u201cpotong\u201d (a \nMalay word meaning \u201ccut\u201d) him if he did not go there. V1 complied \nimmediately as he was afraid. Once V1 arrived at the fitness corner, the \nappellant scolded him in vulgar terms and questioned him as to who had spread \nthe rumour. In court, the appellant admitted that he had also slapped V1\u2019s face \nto make him reveal who was spreading the rumour.\n11 After V1 revealed that V2 and V3 also knew about the rumour, the \nappellant obtained V2\u2019s and V3\u2019s phone numbers from V1. At around 12.20am \nand 12.31am on 17 October 2018, the appellant sent V2 and V3 a series of \nWhatsApp messages with vulgarities directed at them. He demanded that V2 \nand V3 go to meet him.\n12 Upon receiving these text messages from the appellant, V3 decided to \ngo to meet the appellant. V3 asserted later that he complied with the appellant\u2019s \nVersion No 3: 05 Oct 2023 (12:53 hrs)\nMustapah bin Abdullah v PP[2023] SGCA 30\n5demand to meet as he was afraid that the appellant might threaten his family. \nV3 met the appellant at the Hut on 17 October 2018, and the appellant \nquestioned him on whether he knew who had spread the rumour. The appellant \nadmitted at trial that he had become angry and slapped V3 when V3 replied that \nhe had forgotten how the rumour started. V3 testified that he felt afraid and had \ncried during the incident. V3 also claimed that the appellant had threatened to \nharm his family members if the appellant found out that V3 was defending the \nperson who spread the rumour.\n13 Dissatisfied with the first meeting, the appellant subsequently demanded \na second meeting with the Victims so that he could confront them about the \nrumour once more.\n Meeting on 17\/18 October 2018\n14 The appellant instructed V1 to arrange for the Victims to meet him on \nthe night of 17 October 2018, and the second meeting took place at about \n10.30pm at the Hut. When the appellant arrived, he questioned V2, V3 and V4 \nabout who had started the rumour. Thereafter, the appellant kicked V2\u2019s back \nand also kicked V4. V2, V3 and V4 tried to explain to the appellant that they \nwere not responsible for spreading the rumour, but the appellant refused to \naccept their explanations. The appellant told the boys angrily that previously he \nhad been involved in gang fights and had beaten up others. He also threatened \nto \u201cpotong\u201d the Victims\u2019 family members.\n15 The appellant then told V2, V3 and V4 to go with him to the playground. \nV1 arrived there shortly thereafter. The appellant appeared to be angry and \ndrunk at this point. The appellant slapped V3, causing the latter\u2019s spectacles to \nfall from his face, and also tried to scratch V3\u2019s eyes. As there were children at \nVersion No 3: 05 Oct 2023 (12:53 hrs)\nMustapah bin Abdullah v PP[2023] SGCA 30\n6the playground, the appellant told the Victims to meet him one by one at the top \nof the slide in the playground to \u201csettle\u201d the score, whilst the rest were to wait \nat the Hut for their turns. The appellant believed that the Victims would confess \nif they were confronted individually.\n16 According to the Victims, the appellant adopted the same method of \noperation when dealing with each of them. In gist, when the appellant met each \nVictim at the top of the slide, he asked that victim whether he wanted to settle \nthe problem caused by spreading the rumour and thereafter the appellant \nunzipped his pants to expose his penis to that victim.\n17 V3 was the first person to meet the appellant at the top of the slide. The \nappellant exposed his penis to V3 and gave him two options \u2013 to either suck the \nappellant\u2019s penis or to walk away but get beaten up the next time the appellant \nsaw him. The appellant uttered a Malay phrase to V3; the appellant said it was \n\u201cTakde kau hisap aku punya, boleh tak?\u201d (\u201cthe Malay phrase\u201d). By this phrase, \nthe appellant was alleged to have meant that if V3 wanted to settle the problem, \nhe would have to \u201cperform\u201d and to \u201csuck [the appellant\u2019s] penis\u201d. As V3 was \nunable to immediately decide on what to do, the appellant told V3 to go back to \nthe Hut and send V2 to meet him instead.\n18 V2 was the second person to meet the appellant at the top of the slide. \nThe appellant was angry with V2 and the latter apologised to the appellant. The \nappellant asked V2 if he wanted to settle the problem. The appellant then \nunzipped his pants, exposed his penis and gave V2 the same option of either \nperforming fellatio or walking away. He warned V2 that if V2 chose to walk \naway, the appellant would give him problems in public. V2 then bent down to \ncomply with the appellant\u2019s demand to suck the appellant\u2019s penis. The act of \nfellatio lasted around two or three seconds before the appellant told him to stop. \nVersion No 3: 05 Oct 2023 (12:53 hrs)\nMustapah bin Abdullah v PP[2023] SGCA 30\n7The appellant did not ejaculate. V2 testified that he decided to perform fellatio \non the appellant \u201cout of fear\u201d as he was afraid that if he did not do so, the \nappellant would beat up V2 or members of his family.\n19 Next, V1 arrived to meet the appellant. The appellant unzipped his pants \nand told V1 in an angry tone that if he wanted to settle the problem, he had to \nsuck the appellant\u2019s penis. V1 testified that he was pressured and felt he had no \nchoice but to comply with the appellant\u2019s request as otherwise the appellant \nwould carry out his threat. V1 then proceeded to fellate the appellant for a few \nseconds until the appellant told him to stop. In this instance too, the appellant \ndid not ejaculate. Thereafter the appellant instructed V1 to tell V3 to go back to \nthe top of the slide to meet the appellant.\n20 V3 returned to the top of the slide as instructed. Again, the appellant \nunzipped his pants to expose his penis. The Malay phrase was uttered to V3, \nand this seemingly presented V3 the choice of whether to perform fellatio or to \nleave. V3 testified that he decided to perform fellatio on the appellant \u201cfor the \nsake of settling\u201d and he was afraid that the appellant might attack him if he \nchose to walk away. Furthermore, V3 was aware of the appellant\u2019s past as a \ngangster and he thought that the appellant would carry out the threats. V3 then \nfellated the appellant. The appellant\u2019s penis was not erect and, after a few \nseconds, the appellant told V3 to stop.\n21 After confronting the Victims individually, the appellant told them that \nthe problem regarding the rumour was settled.\nThe discovery of the SAP offences\n22 The day after the SAP offences were committed, V1\u2019s class advisor, one \nMr AB, noted that V1\u2019s demeanour had changed, and he looked less cheerful \nVersion No 3: 05 Oct 2023 (12:53 hrs)\nMustapah bin Abdullah v PP[2023] SGCA 30\n8than usual. Mr AB asked V1 what had happened and V1 replied that he had \ndone \u201csomething unusual\u201d for his neighbour. Upon hearing this, Mr AB referred \nV1 to the school counsellor, one Mr CD. Mr CD testified that, during a \ncounselling session on 22 October 2018, V1 revealed that he was coerced to \n\u201csuck the dick\u201d of his neighbour. V1 appeared to be fearful and anxious during \nthe counselling session and told Mr CD that the appellant had also physically \nassaulted him and made threats against him. In accordance with school \nprotocols, V1\u2019s educational institute lodged a police report on 24 October 2018.\n23 Thereafter investigations were conducted by Assistant Superintendent \nof Police Chai Xi En Regina (\u201cIO Chai\u201d). These investigations resulted in the \nappellant being arrested and charged.\nEvidence adduced at the trial \n24 At this point, it is helpful to give a brief account of some of the evidence \nadduced at the appellant\u2019s trial.\nThe appellant\u2019s three long statements\n25 The appellant was interviewed by the police and he gave them three long \nstatements under s 22 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) \n(\u201cCPC\u201d) between 30 October 2018 and 31 October 2018. The appellant said in \nthese statements that he had told the Victims that if they wanted to settle their \nissues with him, they would have to suck his penis, and that the Victims had put \ntheir mouths onto his penis for a few seconds after he unzipped his pants.\n26 The relevant portions of the three long statements (appropriately \nredacted) are reproduced here:\nVersion No 3: 05 Oct 2023 (12:53 hrs)\nMustapah bin Abdullah v PP[2023] SGCA 30\n9(a) In relation to V2, the appellant stated that if V2 wanted to \u201csettle \nthe problem\u201d then V2 \u201chas to suck [his] penis\u201d. V2 then \u201cput his mouth \nonto [the appellant\u2019s] penis\u201d to settle the problem of spreading of the \nrumour. The appellant threatened to \u201cdo something\u201d to V2 if he did not \nwish to settle the problem. The appellant also stated that he kicked V2 \nat the first meeting as he was angry, and he had threatened to use a beer \nbottle to hit V2\u2019s head:\n\u2026\n\u2026\n\u2026\nVersion No 3: 05 Oct 2023 (12:53 hrs)\nMustapah bin Abdullah v PP[2023] SGCA 30\n10(b) In relation to V1, the appellant stated that he told V1 that if he \nwanted to settle, V1 had to \u201csuck [his] cock\u201d. V1 then \u201cput his mouth \nonto [the appellant\u2019s] penis\u201d to settle the problem of spreading of the \nrumour. The appellant also stated that he slapped V1\u2019s face and had \nthreatened to use a beer bottle to hit V1\u2019s head:\n(c) In relation to V3, the appellant stated that V3 \u201cput his mouth onto \n[the appellant\u2019s] penis\u201d and V3\u2019s mouth \u201ccovered [the appellant\u2019s] \npenis\u201d. The appellant also stated that he pulled V3\u2019s hair and attempted \nto hit V3 on the right side of his head. The appellant had also threatened \nto use a beer bottle to knock V3\u2019s head and threatened to beat up the \nVersion No 3: 05 Oct 2023 (12:53 hrs)\nMustapah bin Abdullah v PP[2023] SGCA 30\n11Victims if they chose to walk away from the problem concerning the \nrumour:\n\u2026\n\u2026\n27 The appellant\u2019s statement recounted how he first referred to the Malay \nphrase, ie, \u201cTakde kau hisap aku punya, boleh tak?\u201d:\nVersion No 3: 05 Oct 2023 (12:53 hrs)\nMustapah bin Abdullah v PP[2023] SGCA 30\n1228 These long statements were consistent with the Victims\u2019 accounts at trial \nof how the appellant had dealt with them. The appellant, however, alleged that \nthe three long statements were inadmissible as they were recorded when he was \nin an unstable mental state and under immense stress due to harassment by \nunlicensed moneylenders (who kept calling his home and threatened to burn his \nhome). IO Chai testified that the appellant did not raise any complaint before or \nduring the recording of the statements. Similarly, the Malay interpreter, Maria \nbinte Bazid (\u201cMs Maria\u201d), who was assisting IO Chai during the statement-\nrecording process, also stated during the trial that the appellant did not make \nany complaint. We deal with the admissibility of the three long statements \nbelow.\nInstitute of Mental Health report\n29 Another key piece of evidence was the forensic psychiatric assessment \nand psychiatric report regarding the appellant dated 9 September 2020 that was \nprepared by Dr Yeo Chen Kuan Derrick (\u201cDr Yeo\u201d) from the Institute of Mental \nHealth.\n30 Dr Yeo interviewed the appellant on 26 and 31 August 2020. During \nthese interviews, the appellant gave his account of the events that had occurred \nabout two years earlier. The appellant stated that he had physically assaulted the \nVictims in various ways and had told them \u201cjokingly in Malay\u201d that they should \n\u201csuck [his] cock\u201d if they wanted to apologise. The appellant then met up with \nthe Victims individually, unzipped his pants and took out his penis. Whilst there \nwas contact between the Victims\u2019 mouths and the appellant\u2019s penis, this only \nlasted for a few seconds before the appellant pushed the Victims away. The \nappellant informed Dr Yeo that he decided to humiliate the Victims as he felt \nVersion No 3: 05 Oct 2023 (12:53 hrs)\nMustapah bin Abdullah v PP[2023] SGCA 30\n13that he had been wronged by them. We reproduce a redacted excerpt of \nDr Yeo\u2019s report dated 9 September 2020:\nThe Case for the Defence\n31 The appellant filed his Case for the Defence (\u201cCFD\u201d) on 20 August \n2021. Therein, the appellant stated that his penis had contacted some of the \nVictims\u2019 mouths, even though the degree of intrusion had been minimised. In \nsummary: (a) the appellant stated that V2 had placed one inch of the appellant\u2019s \npenis into his mouth for two seconds; (b) that V1\u2019s lips touched the appellant\u2019s \nfingers; and (c) that V3\u2019s lips touched the shaft of the appellant\u2019s penis. It \nappears that the CFD mixed up the references between V1 and V2, but nothing \nin this case turns on this.\nVersion No 3: 05 Oct 2023 (12:53 hrs)\nMustapah bin Abdullah v PP[2023] SGCA 30\n14Decision below\n32 The decision of the Judge is found in Public Prosecutor v Mustapah bin \nAbdullah [2022] SGHC 262 (\u201cGD\u201d). On the issue of whether the Victims had \nfellated the appellant, the Judge found that there was clear evidence that \nestablished beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant had penetrated the \nVictims\u2019 mouths with his penis (GD at [57]). The Victims had provided \ntextured, coherent and internally consistent accounts of the material events that \nhad happened, and these were mutually corroborative (GD at [58]). The Judge \nfound that the Victims\u2019 evidence was also consistent with the appellant\u2019s own \nconcessions made in his three long statements where he acknowledged using \nthe Malay phrase, unzipping his pants and exposing his penis to the Victims \n(GD at [63]).\n33 The Judge rejected the appellant\u2019s excuse that the Malay phrase uttered \nto the Victims was merely slang and that he did not expect the Victims to take \nhis words literally (GD at [64]). The Judge disagreed with the appellant\u2019s \nsuggestion that the Victims had conspired to backstab him and falsely implicate \nhim as the Judge found that they had no reason to do so (GD at [67]). The \nmanner in which the incident came to light was entirely fortuitous as V1\u2019s class \nadvisor, Mr AB, was the one who approached V1 and uncovered the incident \n(GD at [68]).\n34 The Judge further rejected the appellant\u2019s claim that his three long \nstatements should be disregarded as they were recorded when he was in an \nunstable state of mind (GD at [73]). Neither IO Chai, nor the interpreter, \nMs Maria, who was present when the statements were taken, were informed of \nthe appellant\u2019s concerns about harassment by unlicensed moneylenders (GD at \nVersion No 3: 05 Oct 2023 (12:53 hrs)\nMustapah bin Abdullah v PP[2023] SGCA 30\n15[74]). The Judge also rejected the appellant\u2019s criticisms of Dr Yeo\u2019s psychiatric \nreport as he found that it was based on contemporaneous notes (GD at [79]).\n35 The Judge observed that it was not a defence to criminal liability for the \nSAP offences to argue that the penetration was brief or that the appellant\u2019s penis \nwas not erect (GD at [72]). It was also immaterial that there was no \u201csucking\u201d \nof the penis involved, so long as there was penetration.\n36 The Judge found that the Victims did not truly consent to fellating the \nappellant and only did so out of fear after being threatened. The appellant had \ndemonstrated his capacity to carry out his threats of violence when he assaulted \nthe Victims (GD at [85]), and the Judge accepted the Victims\u2019 evidence that \nthese acts of violence had occurred. Any notion of consent was vitiated since \nany apparent consent had been given under fear of injury to the victims or to \ntheir families. The appellant was thus found guilty of the SAP offences and was \nconvicted accordingly.\n37 On the issue of sentencing, apart from the SAP offences, there was also \nthe SPOM offence (the charge for oral-penile penetration which concerned V4) \nbeing the offence of sexual penetration of a minor under 16 years of age under \ns 376A(1)(c) of the Penal Code. In addition, five other sexual offence charges \nwere taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing (two of those \ncharges related to a fifth victim) (GD at [108]).\n38 Beginning with the SAP offences against V1, V2 and V3, the Judge \nfound that there were three offence-specific aggravating factors. First, the \nappellant was in a position of trust and authority over the Victims; secondly, the \nVictims were vulnerable teenagers; and thirdly, the appellant verbally \nintimidated and inflicted physical violence on the Victims (GD at [110]). \nVersion No 3: 05 Oct 2023 (12:53 hrs)\nMustapah bin Abdullah v PP[2023] SGCA 30\n16Following the sentencing framework set out in Pram Nair v Public Prosecutor \n[2017] 2 SLR 1015 (\u201cPram Nair\u201d), the SAP offences fell within the lower end \nof Band 2 and the indicative starting point was an imprisonment term of ten \nyears (GD at [112]). An uplift of six months\u2019 imprisonment was applied for each \nof the sentences for the SAP offences (GD at [116]). As the appellant was above \n50 years old at the time of sentencing, no caning could be imposed and \n12 months\u2019 imprisonment in lieu of caning was ordered (GD at [120]).\n39 For the SPOM offence, the Judge found that there was an element of \nabuse of trust and thus the starting point was a term of imprisonment of three \nyears. An uplift of six months\u2019 imprisonment was then added to this.\n40 The custodial sentences for the first and second of the SAP offences and \nthe SPOM offence were ordered to run consecutively as they reflected different \nincidents. Nevertheless, considering the issue of proportionality, the sentences \nfor the SAP offences were calibrated downwards to 10 years\u2019 imprisonment per \ncharge, and the SPOM offence to three years\u2019 imprisonment (GD at [121]). \nThus, the global sentence was calibrated to 23 years and 12 months\u2019 \nimprisonment in lieu of caning."}

Yap was instructed by Lee to hand the cash to the person who would pass him the drugs at 28\/30 Gul Avenue. At about 7.22pm, Lee met Yap at the lift lobby of the Hotel.

The claimed geographical area for the production of \u201cProsecco\u201d wines was the \u201cNorth East region of Italy\u201d, and included the entire territory of Belluno, Gorizia, Padova, Pordenone, Treviso, Trieste, Udine, Venice and Vicenza (the \u201cSpecified Region\u201d). The Application GI was accepted and published in the Geographical Indications Journal under Geographical Indication No 50201900088S on 21 June 2019.', '11\\u2003On 9 September 2019, AGWI filed a notice of opposition against the registration of the Application GI. It relied on two grounds of opposition. First, under s 41(1)(f) of the GIA, that the Application GI contained the name of a plant variety and was likely to mislead the consumer as to the true origin of the product. Secondly, under s 41(1)(a) of the GIA, that the Application GI did not fall within the meaning of a \u201cgeographical indication\u201d as defined in s 2(1) of the GIA.', '12\\u2003AGWI\u2019s opposition was dismissed by the Principal Assistant Registrar of Geographical Indications (\u201cPAR\u201d) who ruled that neither ground of opposition had been made out: Consorzio di Tutela della Denominazione di Origine Controllata Prosecco v Australian Grape and Wine Incorporated [2021] SGIPOS 9. In her decision, the PAR noted (at [49]) the length of time that Italian \u201cProsecco\u201d wine had been sold in Singapore (since 2011) and the amount sold over eight years (387,100 litres in 2018 alone) and considered that the likelihood of consumers being misled was small in view of the popularity, reputation and renown of these wines. Australian \u201cProsecco\u201d wine, on the other hand, had only been introduced into the Singapore market in 2015 and the quantity of such wine sold here was significantly lower (9,657 litres in 2018).', '13\\u2003 Dissatisfied with the result, AGWI appealed against the PAR\u2019s decision. The appeal was heard by a judge in the General Division of the High Court (the \u201cJudge\u201d). The Judge ruled that AGWI\u2019s opposition under s 41(1)(f) of the GIA succeeded but dismissed AGWI\u2019s opposition under s 41(1)(a) of the GIA: Australian Grape and Wine Inc v Consorzio di Tutela della Denominazione di Origine Controllata Prosecco [2022] SGHC 33 (the \u201cGD\u201d).', '14\\u2003The Judge ruled, in relation to AGWI\u2019s ground of opposition under s 41(1)(f) of the GIA, that the Application GI did, objectively, contain the name of a plant variety, to wit the Prosecco grape. It followed, the Judge reasoned, that the Application GI would be likely to mislead the consumer if \u201cProsecco\u201d grapes and \u201cProsecco\u201d wines had been cultivated or produced in significant quantities outside the Specified Region. Given the evidence that \u201cProsecco\u201d wines were being produced in commercial quantities in countries such as Australia, the Judge concluded that the Application GI was likely to mislead the consumer in Singapore and thus allowed AGWI\u2019s opposition under s 41(1)(f) of the GIA.', '15\\u2003As to AGWI\u2019s second ground of opposition under s 41(1)(a), the Judge ruled that s 2(1) of the GIA simply required that a GI be any indication used in trade to identify goods as originating from a place. The Judge concluded from the evidence that \u201cProsecco\u201d was an indication used in trade to identify wine originating from the Specified Region. The crucial question was whether there was a given quality, reputation or other characteristic of the goods (ie, Prosecco wine) which was essentially attributable to the Specified Region. In making the Application GI, the Consorzio had adduced evidence to establish that the relevant characteristics of \u201cProsecco\u201d wine were essentially attributable to the Specified Region. AGWI disputed the adequacy of the Consorzio\u2019s evidence. But AWGI was unable to adduce expert factual evidence to prove its assertion that the specified characteristics of the wine, Prosecco, did not attach to the entirety of the Specified Region or its assertion that the \u201cProsecco\u201d wine could be made outside the Specified Region. Therefore, it failed in its opposition on this ground.', '16\\u2003The Consorzio now appeals against the Judge\u2019s decision in relation to the ground of opposition under s 41(1)(f) of the GIA. There is no cross-appeal by AGWI against the Judge\u2019s decision to dismiss its ground of opposition under s 41(1)(a) of the GIA.', '17\\u2003In the hearing of this appeal, we were greatly assisted by the views of Professor Ng-Loy Wee Loon (\u201cProf Ng-Loy\u201d), who was appointed as Independent Counsel."}

Rashmi and Rajesh were close friends of Nimisha and her husband, Deepak Mishra (\u201cDeepak\u201d).', '5\\u2003The Company was a special purpose vehicle incorporated on 12 February 2016 for the sole purpose of purchasing and holding Rashmi and Nimisha\u2019s investment in several office units at 9 Temasek Boulevard #30-01\/02\/03, Suntec Tower 2, Singapore 038989 (collectively, the \u201cProperty\u201d). Rashmi and Nimisha were the registered shareholders of the Company at all material times, each with 50% shareholding.', '6\\u2003Rajesh and Deepak were appointed the first directors of the Company. On 6 September 2019, Deepak stepped down as director. On the same day, Nimisha was appointed as director in his place. On 23 December 2020, Rajesh stepped down as director. Nimisha remained as the sole director. Rashmi did not hold office as a director at any time.', '7\\u2003On 15 February 2016, the Company exercised the option to purchase the Property for approximately $29m. Rajesh and Deepak contributed in equal shares towards the purchase of the Property. We address Rajesh\u2019s contribution in greater detail at [9] below. Subsequently, on or about August or September 2022, the Property was sold by the Company for $38.75 million. The net sale proceeds were transferred to Rashmi\u2019s solicitors, Rajah & Tann Singapore LLP, to be held in escrow pending resolution of Rashmi and Nimisha\u2019s dispute over the distribution of the sale proceeds. In the event, Rashmi and Nimisha could not agree.', '8\\u2003In view of the impasse, on 23 November 2022, Rashmi filed CWU 234. On 9 December 2022, Nimisha filed CWU 244. While Rashmi and Nimisha agreed that the Company was solvent, they alleged that with the sale of the Property, the Company\u2019s substratum had been fulfilled and it no longer had a business purpose. It should therefore be wound up on the just and equitable ground stated in s 125(1)(i) of the IRDA.', '9\\u2003An issue that arose in CWU 234 was whether the shares registered in Rashmi\u2019s name (\u201cRashmi\u2019s Shares\u201d) were beneficially hers. The issue arose because 50% of the purchase price for the Property, representing Rajesh\u2019s contribution, was funded by Fareast Distribution and Logistics Pte Ltd (\u201cFareast\u201d), which was incorporated by Rajesh who was its sole director and shareholder then. The registered shareholder of Fareast subsequently changed from Rajesh to Fausta Limited (\u201cFausta\u201d). Rajesh was also the sole registered shareholder of Fausta. Subsequently, on or about 1 July 2014, Ooi Ai Ling (\u201cOoi\u201d), Rajesh\u2019s personal assistant, became a registered shareholder of Fareast following Fausta\u2019s transfer of 500,000 of its shares in Fareast to her. Finally, on or about 21 February 2018, Ooi become the sole shareholder of Fareast when Fausta transferred its remaining shares to Ooi. The PTs alleged that notwithstanding these transfers, Ooi held the Fareast shares that were transferred to her by Fausta on trust for Rajesh and he was the ultimate beneficial owner of Rashmi\u2019s Shares. As such, Rashmi\u2019s Shares were beneficially owned by Rajesh\u2019s estate in bankruptcy. Rashmi challenged the PTs\u2019 position, asserting that she and Rajesh shared a common intention that Rashmi\u2019s Shares would be hers. While Rashmi accepted that the funds for the purchase of the Property did come from Fareast, she asserted that she was the beneficial owner of the shares in Fareast and Fausta. In support of this contention, Rashmi relied on four declarations of trust which were allegedly executed by Rajesh and Ooi in favour of Rashmi (the \u201cDeclarations of Trusts\u201d). Nimisha and the PTs alleged that the Declarations of Trusts were backdated.', '10\\u2003The PTs\u2019 claim to the beneficial ownership of Rashmi\u2019s Shares was key to their challenge against the appointment of Rashmi\u2019s nominees. The PTs submitted that the liquidators had to distribute the net sale proceeds of the Property to the beneficial owner of Rashmi\u2019s Shares and in order to do so, the liquidators would have to first determine who the beneficial owner was. In view of Rashmi\u2019s claim to the beneficial ownership of Rashmi\u2019s Shares, her nominees were unsuitable for appointment as they would need to investigate that very issue. Notably, the PTs did not address whether the same argument might apply to their nominees. We consider this at [37] below. Nimisha aligned herself with the PTs\u2019 position on the beneficial ownership of Rashmi\u2019s Shares as well as their challenge against Rashmi\u2019s nominees. Nimisha also challenged CWU 234 asserting that Rashmi did not come to court with clean hands because she falsely claimed that she was the beneficial owner of Rashmi\u2019s shares.', '11\\u2003The Judge accepted the PTs\u2019 argument that Rashmi\u2019s nominees were unsuitable for appointment. He cited two reasons for his conclusion. First, he was of the view that the liquidators had to determine the beneficial ownership of Rashmi\u2019s Shares as it was their duty to distribute the net sale proceeds of the Property to the beneficial owner of the shares. Second, he was of the view that the liquidators would \u201cobjectively need to investigate into Rashmi\u2019s (and Rajesh\u2019s) financial affairs \u2026 as part of their duties to realise the assets of the Company\u201d and that it \u201cappear[ed] problematic that Rashmi, Rajesh and [Ooi] [had] relied on documents that [had] been intentionally backdated\u2026\u201d. This was a reference to the Declarations of Trusts. Rashmi\u2019s nominees were thus unsuitable for appointment. The Judge also found Nimisha\u2019s nominees to be unsuitable for appointment, as it was likely that her financial affairs had to also be investigated. In the circumstances, the Judge appointed the PTs\u2019 nominees as the liquidators."}
{"casename":"2023_SGCA_39","fact":"9\\u2003Compass is a private company limited by shares and was incorporated in Singapore in 2004. Its directors are Mr Kelvin Chin Wui Leong (\u201cKelvin\u201d) and his wife, Ms Chong Lee Ching (\u201cMs Chong\u201d). According to Compass, its principal business is in the provision of business advisory services.', '10\\u2003Mr Lim and Damien are father and son respectively. They are executive directors of KTMG Ltd (\u201cKTMG\u201d), a public company listed on the Catalist board of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Ltd (\u201cSGX\u201d). The Lims are also the controlling shareholders of KTMG, through their collective direct and deemed shareholding interests. Mr Lim is the Executive Chairman while Damien is the Chief Executive Officer (\u201cCEO\u201d) of KTMG. Prior to this, the Lims were executive directors and controlling shareholders of Knit Textiles Mfg Sdn Bhd (\u201cKTM\u201d). In February 2019, the Lims successfully listed KTM and its related companies (the \u201cKTM Group\u201d) on the Catalist board of the SGX through an RTO of Lereno Bio-Chem Ltd (\u201cLereno\u201d), which led to Lereno being renamed as KTMG. The RTO of Lereno, and Compass\u2019s role in that transaction, form the background to the present dispute.', '11\\u2003In July 2016, Damien was introduced to Kelvin by a friend, after he mentioned that he and his father were considering listing the KTM Group. From July to September 2016, Kelvin and Damien explored the possibility of listing the KTM Group in Hong Kong, but the Lims eventually decided against this.', '12\\u2003In April 2017, Kelvin approached Damien with the possibility of listing the KTM Group on the Catalist board of the SGX, through an RTO of Lereno. KTM eventually agreed to retain Kelvin\u2019s advisory services for the purpose of the RTO. Consequently, Compass entered into a corporate advisory agreement dated 3 May 2017 (the \u201c1st LOE\u201d), which was signed by Kelvin and Damien. Under the 1st LOE, Compass was appointed as \u201cproject manager\u201d for the RTO and was to be paid a monthly retainer of $10,000 plus out-of-pocket expenses relating to its engagement.', '13\\u2003On or around 11 May 2017, the Lims attended a \u201ckick-off meeting\u201d with Kelvin and Ms Chong at KTM\u2019s office in Malaysia. Shortly after, on 15 May 2017, Compass entered into an addendum to the 1st LOE (the \u201c2nd LOE\u201d), which was signed by Kelvin and Mr Lim. Significantly, the 2nd LOE expressly provided that Compass\u2019s fees for its services were estimated to be $1.1m which could be \u201cadjusted subject to mutual agreement should there be a change in the scope or finalised transaction structure\u201d. More will be said about the agreed fee structure below.', '14\\u2003From May to July 2017, Kelvin and Ms Chong facilitated separate discussions with the Lims and the then-Managing Director and CEO of Lereno, Mr Ong Puay Koon (\u201cMr Ong\u201d), on how the RTO would be structured. According to the Lims, sometime prior to 17 July 2017, Kelvin visited them at their office in Batu Pahat, Malaysia, to propose that he be paid additional incentives in the form of the Bonus Shares and the Cash Fee, if various conditions were met upon completion of the RTO (the \u201cBatu Pahat Meeting\u201d). On a separate occasion, Kelvin also allegedly met with Mr Ong at his office in Science Park (the \u201cScience Park Meeting\u201d) to discuss these additional incentives. We say more about these meetings at [62] and [64] below.', '15\\u2003Subsequently, on 17 July 2017, the Lims, Kelvin, Ms Chong, and Mr Ong attended a meeting at Lereno\u2019s office where the structure of the RTO was finalised (the \u201c17 July 2017 Meeting\u201d). It is not in dispute that an agreement on the Bonus Shares and the Cash Fee was reached at this meeting (ie, the Agreement). The following three documents were signed by the Lims at the same meeting (ie, the 17 July Documents):', '(a)\\u2003A document titled \u201cProject Libra: Sale of Knit Textile Manufacturing Sdn Bhd and its related companies (KTM) to Lereno Bio-Chem Ltd (Transaction)\u201d addressed to Mr Ong and Kelvin (ie, Document 1). Document 1 stated that the Lims, \u201cbeing the directors and shareholders of KTM, hereby agree to the sale of KTM to [Lereno] provided [that their] net share of equity in the listed issuer \u2026 is no less than 65% at completion of the Transaction\u201d. The structure of the RTO was recorded in a scheme spreadsheet annexed to Document 1 (the \u201cScheme Spreadsheet\u201d).', '(b)\\u2003A document titled \u201cProject Libra \u2013 Corporate Service Agreements\u201d addressed to Mr Ong and Kelvin (ie, Document 2). Document 2 stated that the Lims, \u201cbeing the directors and shareholders of KTM, hereby agree to provide both [Mr Ong] and [Kelvin] and\/or their nominated representatives a corporate advisory service agreement (Agreements) for a period of 2 to 3 years from completion of Transaction (the Period). The total fees for the Agreements for both [Mr Ong] and [Kelvin] is no less than S$480,000 per person for the Period\u201d.', '(c)\\u2003A document titled \u201cProject Libra: Sale of Knit Textile Manufacturing Sdn Bhd and its related companies (KTM) to Lereno Bio-Chem Ltd (Transaction)\u201d addressed to Lereno\u2019s board of directors (ie, Document 3). Document 3 stated that the Lims, \u201cbeing the directors and shareholders of KTM, hereby agree to the sale of entire equity in KTM to [Lereno] for a consideration of S$30 Million\u201d.', '16\\u2003According to Kelvin, the finalised structure of the RTO was as follows. The KTM Group would be restructured such that the issued share capital of all the companies in the KTM Group would be held by a single holding entity, Knit Textile and Apparel Pte Ltd (\u201cKTA\u201d). The share capital of KTA would in turn be 100% held by Mr Lim. Lereno would then acquire all of Mr Lim\u2019s shares in KTA for a consideration of $26.4m, and this consideration would be satisfied by Lereno issuing: (a) $25.3m worth of shares in Lereno to Mr Lim; and (b) $1.1m worth of shares in Lereno to Compass, since the Lims were supposed to pay Compass $1.1m in fees under the 2nd LOE. Lereno had been struggling financially at that time and was keen to acquire a new business to sustain its listing status on the SGX. Lereno did not have funds to finance the acquisition, which was why it paid for the acquisition via the issuance of new shares.', '17\\u2003Accordingly, following the 17 July 2017 Meeting, Mr Lim entered into a Put and Call Option Agreement with Lereno on 27 September 2017 to sell his shares in KTA for $26.4m (the \u201cOption Agreement\u201d). The RTO was eventually completed on 18 February 2019, with Lereno duly issuing $26.4m worth of new shares as consideration for the acquisition, as follows:', '18\\u2003In other words, the RTO was completed with the Lims holding a 77.79% stake in Lereno and their shares being worth a total of $26.4m. Compass was also paid $1.1m by the Lims for its services, via the issuance of Lereno shares to it. However, Compass was not paid the Bonus Shares and the Cash Fee, which formed the subject of the dispute below."}

On 22 July 2015 at about 10.27am, the Applicant entered Johor Bahru on his motorcycle. The Applicant picked up two bundles wrapped in black tape from a woman known as \u201cKakak\u201d and hid the two bundles in his motorcycle. After the Applicant collected the drugs, he sent Salleh messages (in Malay) stating: \u201ctotal I have 2 pack only\u201d; and \u201c250 each\u201d.', '5\\u2003The Applicant returned to Singapore on the same day. Later that evening, at about 7.10pm, officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (\u201cCNB\u201d) arrested the Applicant at his residence. During questioning, the Applicant told one of the CNB officers that the two bundles that he had collected from Johor Bahru were in his motorcycle. The Applicant led the CNB officers to his motorcycle where the two bundles were recovered.', '6\\u2003Several statements were recorded from the Applicant. On 22 July 2015 at 8.15pm, the Applicant was served a notice regarding s 33B of the MDA. The Applicant provided a response which was recorded in writing, stating that he did not know the contents of the bundles, only that it was an \u201cillegal thing\u201d. Two further contemporaneous statements were recorded on the same night, and the Applicant\u2019s cautioned statement was recorded the next day, on 23 July 2015. The Applicant\u2019s long statement was recorded on 27 July 2015, five days after his arrest. The Applicant raised his defence for the first time in this statement, that he thought that the bundles contained \u201cgold and cash\u201d. At the trial, the Applicant did not challenge the admissibility of his statements.', '7\\u2003The Applicant was jointly tried with Salleh. At the trial, the Prosecution\u2019s case in relation to the Applicant was that he had actual knowledge that the two bundles contained methamphetamine, and that in the alternative, s 18(2) of the MDA applied to presume that the Applicant had actual knowledge of the nature of the drugs, and the Applicant was unable to rebut this presumption. The Applicant\u2019s defence was that he thought that the bundles contained gold and cash, as he had collected them in the course of his work as a courier for Salleh, whom he knew to be a gold and currency investor.', '8\\u2003On 10 January 2020, the trial judge (\u201cthe Trial Judge\u201d) found that the Applicant had failed to rebut the s 18(2) presumption on a balance of probabilities and convicted the Applicant of the charge against him. The Trial Judge\u2019s primary findings were: that the Applicant\u2019s defence was an afterthought as he had only raised it five days after his arrest; that the Applicant gave internally inconsistent explanations that affected the credibility of his account; and that the Applicant told deliberate lies on a material issue, which led to the irresistible conclusion that he was jointly involved with Salleh in drug trafficking (Public Prosecutor v Muhammad Abdul Hadi bin Haron and another [2020] 5 SLR 710 (\u201cHadi (HC)\u201d) at [56]\u2013[63]).', '9\\u2003The Applicant appealed against his conviction and sentence.

As there was no scope to reduce the sentence any further, the Applicant\u2019s appeal on sentence was also dismissed. On 2 December 2022, the Applicant filed the present criminal motion.

The respondent, JHC, is a company incorporated in Singapore and is in the business of the general wholesale trade of metals and metal products, among other things.', '4\\u2003Prior to 2020, FGHK and JHC were part of the same group of companies and were owned and controlled by Peking University Founder Group Company Limited (\u201cPUFG\u201d). PUFG is a company incorporated in the PRC.', '5\\u2003In February 2020, a creditor of PUFG commenced reorganisation proceedings against it in the Beijing First Intermediate People\u2019s Court. PUFG\u2019s creditors subsequently consented to a reorganisation plan in May 2021, and this was approved by the Beijing First Intermediate People\u2019s Court in June 2021. Pursuant to the plan, ownership and control of JHC were transferred from PUFG to a consortium of investors.', '6\\u2003FGHK continued to be owned by PUFG, but it was ordered to be liquidated by the Hong Kong Court of First Instance on 19 July 2021, following a winding-up application made by one of its creditors. Liquidators of FGHK were appointed on 18 October 2021 (the \u201cLiquidators\u201d).', '7\\u2003According to the Liquidators, they discovered upon a review of FGHK\u2019s books and records that a sum of approximately US$47.43m was due and payable by JHC to FGHK. This sum pertained to an alleged sale of copper cathodes by FGHK to JHC pursuant to three contracts dated 11 December 2015, 22 December 2015 and 6 January 2016, respectively (the \u201cContracts\u201d). Each of the Contracts stated that any disputes which could not be resolved amicably would be submitted to the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission (\u201cCIETAC\u201d) for arbitration in Beijing, and that the governing law of the Contracts was Chinese law. The relevant provision was as follows:', '8\\u2003On 1 December 2021, the Liquidators issued a letter of demand to JHC demanding payment of US$47.43m within 14 days. On 18 February 2022, the Liquidators issued a statutory demand to JHC for the same sum, pursuant to s 125 of the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act 2018 (2020 Rev Ed) (\u201cIRDA\u201d). In March and April 2022, the parties engaged in negotiations to fully and finally settle the outstanding debts, but no agreement was reached.', '9\\u2003On 27 May 2022, the Liquidators (acting on behalf of FGHK) filed HC\/CWU 121\/2022 (\u201cCWU 121\u201d), seeking an order that JHC be wound up on the basis that (a) it was unable to pay its debts within the meaning of s 125(1)(e) of the IRDA; or (b) it was just and equitable to wind up the company pursuant to s 125(1)(i) of the IRDA.', '10\\u2003The Liquidators claimed that the debt of US$47.43m was presently owed by JHC to FGHK and was evidenced by, among other things, an audit confirmation request that had been issued by JHC\u2019s external auditors to FGHK on 26 February 2019 (the \u201cFY2018 Audit Confirmation Request\u201d). In the FY2018 Audit Confirmation Request, JHC\u2019s external auditors, Dexin Assurance (\u201cDexin\u201d), had stated that JHC\u2019s books reflected a sum of US$47.43m that was owed to FGHK, and requested FGHK\u2019s confirmation that this was correct as at 31 December 2018. JHC had clearly and unequivocally admitted its liability for the debt. Further, given that the statutory demand issued on 18 February 2022 remained unsatisfied, JHC was deemed unable to pay its debts pursuant to s 125(2)(a) of the IRDA. Alternatively, JHC\u2019s financial statements showed that it was in fact unable to pay its debts.', '11\\u2003As for the second ground (namely, that it would be just and equitable to wind the company up), this was based on JHC\u2019s stated position that it had entered into contracts (these being the Contracts) that were not meant to be enforced (see [12] below). There was no further explanation for why this had been done, and this suggested a lack of probity or the possibility of fraudulent conduct on its part. It was therefore said to be in the interests of JHC\u2019s and PUFG\u2019s creditors and contributories that the company be wound up and liquidators be appointed, so that they could investigate whether there had been any wrongful conduct on the part of JHC or its directors.', '12\\u2003JHC resisted CWU 121 on the following grounds:', '(a)\\u2003First, it disputed the debt of US$47.43m. As mentioned above, JHC\u2019s position was that the ostensible payment obligations arising under the Contracts were not meant to be enforced. JHC claimed that this had arisen from transactions within the PUFG group. No copper cathodes had in fact been delivered under the Contracts. The Contracts were consequently null and void under their governing law, which was Chinese law. Notably, nothing was said about why these arrangements had been entered into.', '(b)\\u2003Second, the dispute over JHC\u2019s liability for the debt fell within the scope of the arbitration agreements contained in the Contracts and this dispute should therefore be referred to arbitration before the CIETAC. It was not appropriate in such circumstances for the insolvency court to make a winding-up order in a summary way.', '(c)\\u2003Third, the threshold for a just and equitable winding up had not been met.', '13\\u2003At the time CWU 121 was filed, the Liquidators also filed a separate application in HC\/CWU 120\/2022 (\u201cCWU 120\u201d) on behalf of FGHK. CWU 120 was an application to wind up another subsidiary of PUFG, Singapore Commodities Group Co Pte Ltd (\u201cSG Commodities\u201d). Similar to the proceedings in CWU 121, the Liquidators alleged that SG Commodities owed FGHK a debt arising from the sale of copper cathodes. SG Commodities disputed the debt on the basis that the payment obligation was not meant to be enforced, and the dispute was subject to ongoing arbitration proceedings before the CIETAC in Beijing. Following an offer from SG Commodities to provide security for FGHK\u2019s claim against it, the Liquidators consented to CWU 120 being stayed pending the outcome of the CIETAC arbitration proceedings."}
{"casename":"2023_SGCA_41","fact":"2\\u2003The appellant, UniCredit, had on 22 November 2019, granted to Hin Leong Trading (Pte) Ltd (\u201cHin Leong\u201d) banking facilities amounting to US$85m. This was done pursuant to a Facility Agreement and Memorandum of Pledge, as well as UniCredit\u2019s General Business Conditions. Hin Leong could use these facilities to obtain letters of credit to finance the purchase of oil, petroleum products and other commodities. Five days later, on 27 November 2019, Hin Leong made use of the facility arrangement and applied to UniCredit for an irrevocable letter of credit in the sum of US$37,209,550.35 to finance its purchase of 150,000 metric tons of High-Sulphur Fuel Oil (the \u201cgoods\u201d) from Glencore. This transaction between Glencore and Hin Leong set the stage for the dispute between UniCredit and Glencore.', '3\\u2003By a contract made on 27 November 2019 (the \u201cSale Contract\u201d) Hin Leong purchased the goods shipped onboard the oil tanker \u201cNew Vision\u201d and agreed that the discharge and delivery of the goods would be to a terminal in Singapore during the period of 18 to 25 December 2019. By a separate contract concluded at the same time, Glencore agreed to buy the goods back from Hin Leong (the \u201cBuyback Contract\u201d). The basic terms of the contracts were also contained in an email sent by Hin Leong to Glencore on 27 November 2019, and these two contractual deals will be referred to collectively as the \u201cSale and Buyback Arrangement\u201d. One of the terms of the sale by Glencore to Hin Leong was that at 0001 hours on 2 December 2019, title to the goods would pass from Glencore to Hin Leong. There was an identical term in the contract for the sale from Hin Leong to Glencore. The upshot was that the parties agreed that title to the goods would pass from Glencore to Hin Leong at 0001 hours on 2 December 2019 and then immediately pass back to Glencore from Hin Leong.', '4\\u2003On 27 November 2019, Hin Leong submitted to UniCredit an application for an irrevocable letter of credit to finance the Sale Contract. A request was then made by UniCredit on 28 November 2019 for documents, including the sale and purchase contracts and\/or a \u201cdeal recap\u201d. Hin Leong responded on the same day, clarifying that its application for a letter of credit was for \u201c[u]nsold cargo\u201d. While this was what Hin Leong had said, in truth, Hin Leong had already contracted to sell the goods back to Glencore. Hin Leong provided UniCredit with a copy of the Sale Contract but did not disclose the Buyback Contract referred to above (at [3]).', '5\\u2003Hin Leong then submitted a revised application for an irrevocable letter of credit on 28 November 2019, and UniCredit subsequently issued an irrevocable letter of credit in favour of Glencore as beneficiary on 29 November 2019 (\u201cthe November LC\u201d). The November LC was subject to The Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (2007 Revision) (ICC Publication No 600). It stated that the credit thereunder would be available against the presentation of various stipulated documents such as a signed commercial invoice, and a full set of all three original bills of lading (\u201cBLs\u201d) issued or endorsed to the order of \u201cUniCredit Bank AG, Singapore Branch\u201d and marked \u201cfreight payable as per charter party\u201d. The November LC further provided that in the event that the documents called for were unavailable at the time of presentation or negotiation, payment would be effected against the beneficiary\u2019s commercial invoice and the beneficiary\u2019s letter of indemnity duly signed by authorised signatory(s). Hin Leong had provided UniCredit with the format and wording of the beneficiary\u2019s letter of indemnity for payment when it first applied for the November LC on 27 November 2019. Significantly, the addressee and recipient of the beneficiary\u2019s letter of indemnity was Hin Leong. The format and wording of the beneficiary\u2019s letter of indemnity were reproduced in the November LC (the \u201cGlencore LOI\u201d) without any amendment.', '6\\u2003 On 2 December 2019, Glencore presented the following documents to UniCredit for payment under the November LC:', '(a)\\u2003Glencore\u2019s commercial invoice for the Sale Contract which was addressed to Hin Leong; and', '(b)\\u2003The Glencore LOI which was addressed to Hin Leong and worded in accordance with the format prescribed in the November LC.', '7\\u2003On 3 December 2019, UniCredit informed Hin Leong that the documents under the November LC were presented and that UniCredit had determined the documents to be a complying presentation. Glencore, as the beneficiary of the November LC, in a separate arrangement with UniCredit, discounted the bill amount of US$ 37,209,550.35 and received from UniCredit a sum of US$36,997,691.57. More importantly, when UniCredit paid Glencore on 3 December 2019, it still did not know that Glencore had already bought back the goods.', '8\\u2003After the November LC matured on 28 February 2020, UniCredit again asked Hin Leong if it had sold the goods, and if so, to provide documents relating to that sale. Hin Leong informed UniCredit that the goods remained unsold, which was untrue given that Hin Leong had on 2 December 2019 resold the goods to Glencore.', '9\\u2003Slightly more than a month later, on 13 April 2020, UniCredit issued a notice of demand to Hin Leong, demanding repayment of, inter alia, the outstanding advances and accrued interest arising out of UniCredit\u2019s financing of Hin Leong\u2019s purchase of goods from Glencore. At this point, Hin Leong had requested a meeting with its bank lenders, including UniCredit. A day later, on 14 April 2020, UniCredit asked Glencore if it had the original BLs referred to in the LC. Glencore replied that it did not.', '10\\u2003Hin Leong was placed under interim judicial management on 27 April 2020 and under judicial management on 7 August 2020. Hin Leong went into liquidation on 8 March 2021. Hin Leong\u2019s insolvency left UniCredit without repayment from Hin Leong and without possession of the goods or the original BLs as security for Hin Leong\u2019s indebtedness to UniCredit. UniCredit turned to Glencore for redress."}

The respondents were agreeable to furnishing SFC in the sum of $90,000. However, the parties could not agree on the form of security to be provided by the respondents. The parties duly appeared before Senior Assistant Registrar Cornie Ng (\u201cSAR Ng\u201d) for a decision on the matter.', '5\\u2003On 14 February 2023, SAR Ng made the following orders:', '6\\u2003By SAR Ng\u2019s order (ie, HC\/ORC 784\/2023), the respondents would have to make payment into court of the agreed quantum of security if the parties could not come to an agreement on any one of the other forms of security mentioned in SAR Ng\u2019s order. Unfortunately, the parties could not agree on an appropriate arrangement. The respondents maintained that an undertaking from two companies (the \u201cOmni Undertaking\u201d) would be a satisfactory security arrangement. The first company was Omni Bridgeway Limited, the parent of the Omni Funder and a company listed on the Australian Securities Exchange. The second was Omni Bridgeway (Singapore) Pte Ltd, Omni Bridgeway Limited\u2019s Singapore-incorporated subsidiary (collectively, the \u201cOmni Related Companies\u201d). On 28 February 2023, the respondents appealed against SAR Ng\u2019s order by way of RA 42. The Judge allowed the appeal. He accepted the Omni Undertaking as an adequate form of security and ordered that the respondents furnish security for Ms Lum\u2019s costs for the period until the filing and\/or exchange of AEICs by way of the Omni Undertaking (see Hyflux Ltd (in compulsory liquidation) and others v Lum Ooi Lin [2023] SGHC 113 (\u201cRA 42 Judgment\u201d) at [49]\u2013[50]).', '7\\u2003OA 33 was Ms Lum\u2019s application for permission to appeal against the order made in RA 42.

She had made arrangements for Farid to collect the controlled drug and deliver it to Hamzah bin Ibrahim (\u201cHamzah\u201d) between 19 and 20 December 2013. Farid delivered two packets containing not less than 26.29g of diamorphine to Hamzah in the afternoon of 20 December 2013 while they were in a car driven by Farid.', '5\\u2003The applicant was tried jointly with Farid and Hamzah in the High Court. Farid testified that he was recruited by the applicant to deliver drugs for her, while Hamzah admitted that he had arranged with the applicant to purchase drugs. The applicant denied any involvement in the drug transaction. She was arrested many months after the drug transaction. She claimed to have been \u201cplayed out\u201d by her then-lover, K Saravanan A\/L Kuppusamy (\u201cSaravanan\u201d), who had been selling drugs. She claimed that Saravanan must have used her mobile phone to contact Farid about the drug transaction without her knowledge. She also claimed that Farid and Hamzah must have colluded to implicate her falsely.', '6\\u2003The trial Judge (the \u201cJudge\u201d) convicted all three accused persons. Farid\u2019s evidence on how he was instructed by the applicant to collect and to deliver the drugs to Hamzah was corroborated by Hamzah. In contrast, the Judge found the applicant\u2019s denial of any involvement to be vague, unsatisfactory and unbelievable. Her account was contradicted by Farid, Hamzah and Saravanan. The Judge also found that there was no reason for Farid to frame the applicant. The three men\u2019s evidence and the objective evidence from Farid\u2019s mobile phone records, together with the applicant\u2019s implausible account, showed that the applicant was guilty as charged.', '7\\u2003Farid qualified for the alternative sentencing regime under s 33B(2) of the MDA and was sentenced to life imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane. The alternative sentencing regime did not apply to the applicant and Hamzah as they were not couriers. As a result, the mandatory death sentence was passed on the applicant and Hamzah.', '8\\u2003The applicant appealed in CCA 29 against her conviction and sentence. Hamzah appealed against only his sentence in CA\/CCA 26\/2017. Both appeals were dismissed by the Court of Appeal on 20 August 2018. In delivering the oral judgment of the court, Sundaresh Menon CJ held that the applicant\u2019s argument that she was innocent and was a victim of a conspiracy between Farid and Hamzah, acting under the direction of Saravanan to give false evidence, was without merit. The Prosecution\u2019s position had always been that Hamzah was not a courier and Hamzah had every reason to expect that he would not qualify for the alternative sentencing regime. Yet, there was no attempt by Hamzah to retract his evidence incriminating the applicant.', '9\\u2003Apart from this, there was other evidence that the Judge had relied on to arrive at her findings. The Court of Appeal also stated that the Judge had analysed the facts carefully. As the Court of Appeal was satisfied that there was no merit in the appeals, they were dismissed accordingly."}
{"casename":"2023_SGCA_45","fact":"4\\u2003The respondent, Relax Beach Co Ltd, is a company incorporated in Thailand which owns and operates a luxury hotel in Phuket known as Le Meridien Phuket Beach Resort (\u201cthe Insured Premises\u201d). The respondent is a named insured under the Insurance Policy No 8-F0005135-ISR-R004 (\u201cthe Policy\u201d) which provides coverage for the Insured Premises.', '5\\u2003The first appellant, QBE Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd, and the second appellant, MS First Capital Insurance Limited, are co-insurers under the Policy and they agreed to indemnify the respondent in respect of business interruption losses suffered at, among other places, the Insured Premises. The period of insurance coverage under the Policy was between 1 January 2020 and 1 January 2021.', '6\\u2003In particular, under s 2 of the Policy, the appellants agreed to provide the following indemnity:', '7\\u2003One of the events covered by the Policy was the closure of the whole or part of the Insured Premises by an order of a public authority as a result of an outbreak of an infectious or contagious disease. In this regard, cl 87 of the Policy (an infectious disease extension, or \u201cthe IDE\u201d) states as follows (extending the indemnity coverage provided under s 2 of the Policy):', 'Limb (i) of the IDE is referred to as a \u201ccomposite peril\u201d clause in the insurance industry as it requires successive elements to be satisfied before a claim can be made (these being, business interruption loss arising from closure of the insured premises, by order of a public authority as a result of an outbreak of a notifiable infectious or contagious disease or defects at the premises). As we will explain below, there was some disagreement between the appellants and the respondent on whether the phrase \u201cat the premises\u201d at the end of Limb (i) of the IDE applies only to the immediately preceding words \u201cdefects in the drains and\/or other sanitary arrangements\u201d (\u201cthe Defects Limb\u201d) (the respondent\u2019s position) or whether it also extends to the prior words \u201coutbreak of a notifiable human infectious or contagious disease\u201d (\u201cthe Disease Limb\u201d) (the appellants\u2019 position).', '8\\u2003Pertinently, the Policy also requires, under Condition 7 (\u201cthe Notification Clause\u201d) that the insured notify the insurers of any claim that arises and, importantly, to provide additional particulars of the claim in order to be entitled to be indemnified thereunder:', 'It is not disputed between the parties that the Notification Clause is a condition precedent to any liability under the Policy. For convenience, we refer to the second paragraph of the Notification Clause as the \u201cSecond Condition\u201d.', '9\\u2003On 26 February 2020, COVID-19 was first declared a dangerous communicable disease by the Thailand Government under the Communicable Diseases Act 2015. Following this declaration, businesses were required to notify the health authorities of any cases of COVID-19 at their respective premises.', '10\\u2003Thereafter, there was an increase in the number of COVID-19 infections in Thailand (including Phuket). As a result of the outbreak of COVID-19, the Thailand Government and the Governor of Phuket Province (\u201cGovernor\u201d) (collectively, \u201cthe Public Authority\u201d) implemented a series of escalating measures in Phuket to control the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. These measures were implemented between 18 March 2020 and 9 April 2020.', '11\\u2003Crucially, on 2 April 2020, the Governor observed that \u201c[w]ith regards to Phuket province, it is noticed that the number of cases is increasing at a fast rate\u201d and thus ordered the complete \u201c[c]losure of all types of hotels and similar establishments\u201d in Phuket until further notice (\u201cthe Closure Order\u201d). However, occupied hotels were permitted to continue business until such time as all the guests had vacated their rooms. In compliance with this, the Insured Premises were gradually shut down and completely closed by 7 April 2020 (after the last guests vacated their rooms). The respondent\u2019s luxury hotel business was thus shuttered from this point onwards until further notice. This formed the basis of the respondent\u2019s claim for business interruption losses.', '12\\u2003On 26 May 2020, the respondent submitted a claim notification to the first appellant and sought to be indemnified in respect of its business interruption losses under the Policy (\u201cthe Claim\u201d). On the same day, the first appellant replied and sought further information from the respondent relating to the Claim (such as whether there was any outbreak of COVID-19 at the Insured Premises):', '13\\u2003On 27 May 2020, the respondent replied to the first appellant stating, among other things, that there had not been any outbreak of COVID-19 at the Insured Premises. Regarding the other queries, the respondent explained that it would need time to reply. Nevertheless, no further information was provided to the appellants on the queries relating to risk management procedures and the extent of hotel operations that were still running.', '14\\u2003Following this, the first appellant wrote to the respondent on 29 May 2020 (\u201cthe 29 May 2020 Letter\u201d) to highlight that coverage under the Policy only applied upon \u201c[c]losing of the whole or part of the premises by order of a Public Authority as a result of an outbreak of a notifiable human infectious or contagious disease \u2026 at the premises\u201d [emphasis added]. Since the respondent had informed that there was no outbreak of COVID-19 at the Insured Premises, the respondent had not satisfied the criteria in the IDE for coverage under the Policy. The 29 May 2020 Letter then concluded by requesting that the respondent furnish further information to support the Claim within 21 days, failing which the Claim would be rejected. We reproduce the material portions of the 29 May 2020 Letter here for convenience:', '15\\u2003It transpired that the appellants never received any further information from the respondent after the 29 May 2020 Letter was sent.', '16\\u2003On 5 February 2021, after a period of more than eight months had passed following the 29 May 2020 Letter, the first appellant received a letter from the respondent\u2019s lawyers, requesting that the first appellant retract the rejection of the Claim. The respondent\u2019s lawyers stated that the rejection of the Claim was without basis as it was not a prerequisite for there to be an outbreak of COVID-19 at the Insured Premises for the coverage under the Policy to apply. In response, on 8 February 2021, the first appellant confirmed by email that it would not be retracting the 29 May 2020 Letter rejecting the Claim.', '17\\u2003On 31 March 2021, the respondent commenced HC\/OS 299\/2021 (\u201cOS 299\u201d) in the General Division of the High Court, seeking the following primary reliefs, among others:', '(a)\\u2003a declaration that the respondent has a valid claim under the Policy for business interruption suffered in respect of the Insured Premises; and', '(b)\\u2003a declaration that the appellants are liable to indemnify the respondent in respect of such business interruption losses in accordance with the terms of the Policy.', '18\\u2003Notably, the respondent\u2019s supporting affidavit filed in respect of OS 299 stated for the very first time that one of its hotel employees, who we refer to as \u201cMr K\u201d, had tested positive for COVID-19 sometime around 26 March 2020. Materially, this meant that there was a COVID-19 infection on the Insured Premises just days before the Closure Order was announced by the Governor on 2 April 2020. The emergence of this fact is crucial to the respondent\u2019s legal case, which was that Mr K\u2019s singular case of COVID-19 on the Insured Premises would suffice to trigger liability under Limb (i) of the IDE.', '19\\u2003On 7 March 2022, the learned judge in the General Division of the High Court (\u201cthe Judge\u201d) delivered his decision in OS 299 at a hearing in chambers, which was recorded in his Notes of Evidence (without any written grounds setting out his full reasoning). The Judge found in favour of the respondent and ordered that the appellants were liable to indemnify the respondent for the loss suffered at the Insured Premises when it closed down.', '20\\u2003On the anterior issue of whether the respondent had complied with the Notification Clause in the Policy, the appellants had argued that the respondent failed to satisfy the condition precedent in the Notification Clause because the respondent did not inform the appellants of Mr K\u2019s COVID-19 infection and furnish additional particulars of business interruption losses. On this basis, it was contended that the respondent was not entitled to compensation. However, the Judge disagreed and found that the Notification Clause merely required the respondent to give notice of the \u201chappening of any loss, destruction or damage\u201d. It did not require the respondent to give notice of the underlying causes of such losses. Thus, the failure to notify the appellants of Mr K\u2019s case was immaterial. Instead, the Notification Clause obligation was fulfilled by the respondent giving notice that business interruption had arisen due to the closure of the Insured Premises pursuant to the Closure Order.', '21\\u2003Regarding the provision of additional particulars of business interruption losses, the Judge opined that it was difficult to see how the appellants could insist on the respondent providing these particulars after summarily rejecting the respondent\u2019s Claim on 29 May 2020. The appellants\u2019 reliance on the statement in its 29 May 2020 Letter requesting further information to support the Claim rung hollow because, read in context, that was a request for the respondent to further justify the validity of the Claim (in light of the reasons the appellants gave for rejecting it) and not a request for details of the loss suffered.', '22\\u2003On the substance of the Claim, the Judge agreed with the appellants that Limb (i) of the IDE referred to the outbreak of a notifiable human infectious or contagious disease at the premises. Reading all four limbs of the IDE together and considering the overall context, it was more consistent with a plain and grammatical reading to construe the phrase \u201cat the premises\u201d as applying to both defects in drainage and\/or sanitary arrangements (meaning the Defects Limb) and also to the outbreak of infectious disease (meaning the Disease Limb).', '23\\u2003Next, on the issue of whether the Closure Order was \u201cas a result of\u201d the outbreak at the Insured Premises, the Judge opined that while there was no direct evidence that Mr K\u2019s case was specifically and individually considered by the Governor in making the Closure Order, there was nothing in principle or in the concept of causation which precluded an event, when combined with many other similar events (including the other COVID-19 cases occurring outside the Insured Premises), from being considered a proximate cause of the resulting consequence. On this point, the Judge referred to Financial Conduct Authority v Arch Insurance (UK) Ltd and others (Hiscox Action Group intervening) [2021] 2 WLR 123 (\u201cFCA Test Case\u201d) at [191].', '24\\u2003The Closure Order stated that it had been noticed that the number of COVID-19 cases in Phuket was increasing at a fast rate and that the Governor had acted pursuant to a meeting of the Committee of Communicable Disease of Phuket held on 31 March 2020. In the circumstances, the Judge found that it was \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that Mr K\u2019s diagnosis on 26 March 2020 \u201cformed part of the statistics informing the deliberation\u201d of the Committee and the decision of the Governor. Thus, Mr K\u2019s case might be regarded as one of the many concurrent causes of the Closure Order. Consequently, the Judge held that the insured peril as described in Limb (i) of the IDE was made out in the sense that the Closure Order was \u201cas a result\u201d of Mr K\u2019s case. The Judge hence ordered the appellants to indemnify the respondent for the Claim.', '25\\u2003The present appeal in CA\/CA 3\/2023 (\u201cCA 3\u201d) was initially begun by way of AD\/CA 35\/2022 in the Appellate Division of the High Court. The appeal was then transferred to the Court of Appeal in CA\/OA 18\/2022 (\u201cOA 18\u201d) upon the application of the appellants (filed with the consent of the respondent) as the Court of Appeal found that the issues in the appeal would raise points of law of public importance and the consideration of a landmark decision of the United Kingdom Supreme Court in the FCA Test Case concerning the interpretation of insurance contracts with business interruption clauses in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.', '26\\u2003The hearing for the appeal in CA 3 was scheduled for 16 October 2023. However, on the afternoon of 13 October 2023, the appellants filed a last-minute withdrawal of the appeal in CA 3. It appears that the respondent did not object, save that there was an outstanding issue of costs for CA 3 and OA 18.', '27\\u2003As alluded to above, the parties were unable to agree on costs and have made submissions on costs. This is the key subject matter of the present judgment which we now address."}

We dismissed SUM 87 on 16 September 2020.', '8\\u2003As appears below, the technical background to SG 872 \u2013 including the physical properties of diamonds, how SG 872 seeks to enhance the quality of CVD diamonds grown and the measurement or evaluation of the improvement brought about by SG 872 \u2013 is highly complex. The following steps greatly assisted us in coming to grips with the difficult material:', '(a)\\u2003On 19 April 2021, we directed the parties to prepare a \u201cPrimer\u201d (with a 50-page limit) setting out their points of agreement and divergence on topics including the common general knowledge (such as different methods of growing diamonds and types of defects in diamonds), the state of the art (including other patents) and the inventive concept of SG 872.', '(b)\\u2003We also convened a \u201cTechnology Tutorial\u201d that was conducted on 2, 3 and 4 August 2021. Each party was allowed to nominate up to two presenters from among their expert witnesses to address these topics as well as provide an introduction to SG 872 and the Metripol system. 11', 'The parties filed and exchanged Powerpoint slide decks prepared by their presenters seven days before the Technology Tutorial.', 'In the section that follows, we outline the salient aspects of the background to SG 872 as presented in the Primer and Technical Tutorial, which will set the context for our analysis of its validity.', '9\\u2003Following the Technology Tutorial, CA 41 was heard over three half-day hearings on 20, 24 and 25 January 2022.', '10\\u2003Subsequently, on 14 September 2022, we wrote to the parties to clarify whether each product claim in SG 872 covers a class of products as opposed to an individual product. The significance of this point, as well as of the parties\u2019 responses on 21 September 2022, will become clear when we analyse whether SG 872 should be revoked in its entirety.', '11\\u2003We first set out the technical background to SG 872. As we later elaborate, SG 872 discloses a new single crystal CVD diamond material, at least 0.5mm in thickness, which possesses one or more properties stated in the patent. One such property is low \u201coptical birefringence\u201d (henceforth referred to as \u201cbirefringence\u201d). It is the respondent\u2019s case that without the new CVD growth process taught within SG 872, the single crystal CVD diamond material manufactured would not display the properties defined in the product claims of SG 872. It is said that these properties are indicative of a high-quality diamond. 12', '12\\u2003Diamonds are a form of solid C (meaning carbon) in which each C atom is bonded to four neighbouring C atoms to form a tetrahedral structure. Many of these tetrahedral structures come together to form a diamond lattice. A \u201csingle crystal\u201d diamond, which is claimed in SG 872, is one in which the crystal lattice of the entire sample is continuous and unbroken. In contrast, a polycrystalline diamond consists of many single crystals. 13', '13\\u2003Diamonds may form naturally within the Earth\u2019s crust or be manufactured in a laboratory. 14', 'CVD is one of the main ways of manufacturing diamonds, the other of which involves applying high-pressure-high-temperature (\u201cHPHT\u201d) on a C source mixed with a catalyst. 15', '14\\u2003In reality, no diamond (natural or man-made) is an array of equally spaced atoms which are purely C. Diamonds will contain impurities and defects. We make this point to provide context to what the respondent\/patentee sought to achieve through the new growth processes taught in SG 872. As will become clear, the type and extent of defects in a diamond bear on its physical properties, such as its strength, 16', 'and hence its potential industrial use(s) and application(s). The respondent sought to produce CVD single crystal diamonds with certain qualities which were required for specific industrial applications. Allegedly, such diamonds could only be produced using the processes claimed in SG 872. What follows elaborates on the nature of defects or impurities arising in diamonds and the relationship between these imperfections and a diamond\u2019s physical properties.', '15\\u2003Impurities refer to non-C atoms bonded into the diamond\u2019s lattice structure. Common impurities include nitrogen (N2) and boron. The concentration of nitrogen and boron is expressed in parts per million (\u201cppm\u201d) or parts per billion (\u201cppb\u201d). 17', 'Based on its purity, a diamond can be categorised into two main types: Type I and Type II. These can be further sub-divided into Types Ia, Ib, IIa and IIb. Type I diamonds contain relatively large amounts of nitrogen \u2013 up to 0.3% (5ppm to ~ 3000ppm). Most of the nitrogen atoms in Type Ia diamonds are found in clusters, but this is not the case in Type Ib diamonds. 18', 'Type II diamonds contain nitrogen below 5ppm. The only impurity in Type IIa diamonds is nitrogen, whereas impurities in Type IIb diamonds consist of nitrogen and boron. 19', '16\\u2003When impurities (meaning non-C atoms) enter the diamond\u2019s structure, a point defect is created in the lattice structure. 20', 'Extended defects, on the other hand, are structural defects caused by disruptions to the diamond lattice that extend across the crystal. 21', 'One example of an extended defect is a stacking fault, which occurs where the relative positioning of two adjacent layers (or planes) of crystal structure does not conform with the rest of the crystal:', 'Another type of extended defect is a dislocation. Dislocations occur where there are atoms out of position in the crystal structure that, among other things, form an extra line of atoms within the structure (that is, an edge dislocation): 22', '17\\u2003Extended defects can be visualised using X-ray topography images where stacking faults appear as dark planes (Figure 3) and dislocations appear as dark lines (Figure 4). Thicker and relatively darker lines show bundles of dislocations: 23', '18\\u2003Dislocations cause strain, or distortion to the position of atoms, in the diamond structure. 24', 'The strain extends across the full length of the dislocation, which typically runs all the way across the diamond. 25', 'Strain weakens the chemical bonds, which then can be broken with lower energy. This reduces the strength of the diamond to withstand external pressure. 26', 'According to Dr Christoph Erwin Nebel (\u201cDr Nebel\u201d), the appellant\u2019s principal expert, 27', 'if there is strain, electrons between the atoms are no longer homogenously distributed, resulting in an electric field that may interact with light and increase birefringence in the diamond (a property we explore in some detail at [20]\u2013[27] below). 28', '19\\u2003Dislocation density refers to the number of dislocations per square cm or mm of surface. Dislocations extend across the diamond like a line (hence, \u201cline defects\u201d) and terminate only on the surface: 29', '', 'Dislocation termination points reveal themselves as etch pits. An optical evaluation of the number of etch pits across the surface area of the diamond will reveal its dislocation density:', '20\\u2003Birefringence is a physical property of diamonds relevant to the key claims in SG 872. We shall therefore explore this concept in some detail.', '21\\u2003 Birefringence, stated generally, is related to how light interacts with a certain object. Light is made of waves of electric and magnetic fields. These waves oscillate in all directions perpendicular to the direction of the transmission of light. The distance travelled when an electromagnetic wave goes through one full oscillation cycle is called wavelength, which is denoted by \u03bb. The wavelength of light determines its colour. 30', '22\\u2003While normal light consists of electric fields oscillating in all directions in the plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation, a polariser filter may be used to only allow light containing electric fields oscillating in a single direction to pass through. \u201cPolarised light\u201d therefore has only one direction of oscillation. 31', '23\\u2003The atomic arrangement in a material affects the speed at which light travels through it. The speed of light in an optical material is determined by the material\u2019s refractive index. The denser the material, the higher its refractive index and the slower that light travels through it. 32', '24\\u2003Where the internal structure of the crystalline material is perfect, in that it has no impurities or defects, the crystalline material is highly symmetrical. Such material is referred to as isotropic. In isotropic materials, the refractive index is the same in all directions. This means that light passes through an isotropic crystal at a single velocity.', '25\\u2003But for anisotropic materials, the refractive index may vary in different directions. Although a diamond may theoretically be isotropic due to its highly symmetrical uniform lattice of C atoms, in reality, diamonds are anisotropic due to strain caused by dislocations. 33', 'When polarised light is passed through a diamond with strain, the light splits into two relevant components which travel at different velocities. One component travels faster along the path in the material with the smallest refractive index (n\u201d) and the other travels slower along the path in the material with the largest refractive index (n\u2019). The difference between the smallest and largest available refractive index is called birefringence (\u0394n = |n\u2019 \u2013 n\u2019\u2019|). 34', 'In other words, strain in diamonds results in birefringence. 35', '26\\u2003The gap between the faster and slower components of light when they emerge out of the material is defined as the optical retardation (also referred to as \u201cretardation\u201d or \u201cpath difference\u201d). Light of any wavelength which passes through a sample of an anisotropic material having birefringence \u0394n, where the sample has a thickness of \u201cL\u201d, will display retardation of L\u00b7\u0394n. Dr Nebel depicted birefringence and retardation as follows: 36', '27\\u2003For light of a particular wavelength (or \u03bb), retardation can also be represented as phase shift \u201c\u03b4\u201d: 37', '', 'Dr Nebel represented the components of the above equation, using the following diagrams of light components that have split up when passing through an object: 38', '', '28\\u2003This appeal concerns SG 872, which was filed on 20 November 2003. In essence, the patent covers a new optical quality synthetic single crystal CVD diamond material and the method for its production. 39', 'The patent contains both product and process claims. A product claim is one which \u201casserts exclusive rights over a new thing, such as new machines, items or articles of manufacture and composition of matter\u201d. Although the patentee may describe only one use of his invention, he has the right to stop others from using it for other purposes (Susanna H S Leong, Intellectual Property Law of Singapore (Academy Publishing, 2013) (\u201cSusanna Leong\u201d) at para 18.002). We will henceforth refer to a diamond falling within any of the product claims in SG 872 as an \u201cSG 872 Diamond\u201d. On the other hand, \u201ca process claim covers a new activity such as a process or method of manufacturing and logically, in a method or process claim, it is the process used and not the end result which must be new to justify patentability.\u201d (Susanna Leong at para 18.003).', '29\\u2003The pivotal product claim, which all subsequent claims refer back to, is Claim 1:', '30\\u2003Single crystal CVD diamond material falling within Claim 1 has low strain and exhibits at least one of the optical properties defined in the eight limbs of Claim 1. 40', 'Two of these limbs, limbs ii) and iii), assume significance in this dispute. Following the terminology used by the parties and the Judge, we will refer to these two limbs as \u201cClaim 1ii)\u201d and \u201cClaim 1iii)\u201d respectively. As the respondent pleads that Claims 1ii) and 1iii) were infringed (see Judgment at [417]), 41', 'we elaborate on these. Claims 1ii) and 1iii) assert a monopoly over single crystal CVD diamond material with low birefringence. Low birefringence is quantified in Claim 1ii) as a sample (a) remaining in the first order (\u03b4 does not exceed ); and (b) with the modulus of the sine of the phase shift (that is, |sin \u03b4|) not exceeding 0.9. Low birefringence is quantified in Claim 1iii) as a sample (a) remaining in the first order (\u03b4 does not exceed ); and (b) with the maximum value of \u0394n[average] (that is, the average birefringence across the thickness of the sample) not exceeding 1.5 x 10-4.', '31\\u2003We highlight four key points pertaining to Claims 1ii) and 1iii) which the parties do not dispute. First, the term \u201cfirst order\u201d for the purposes of SG 872 (and Claims 1ii) and 1iii) in particular) has been defined in a specific way. The parties\u2019 experts, when explaining certain technical concepts (see above at [27] and below at [191]), 42', 'referred to each \u201corder\u201d as a multiple of 2\u03c0, with \u201cfirst order\u201d covering a range of values where \u03b4 does not exceed 2\u03c0 (or again, expressed as an equation, \u03b4 \u2264 2\u03c0). However, SG 872 defines \u201cfirst order\u201d in a much more limited sense, namely, where \u03b4 does not exceed (or again, expressed as an equation, \u03b4 \u2264 ) (the \u201cSG 872 First Order\u201d). 43', '32\\u2003Second, it is undisputed that SG 872 directs the person skilled in the art (\u201cPSA\u201d) to use a Deltascan (which has been renamed as the Metripol since 2001) 44', 'or a \u201csimilar instrument with similar resolution\u201d to determine the value of |sin \u03b4| and \u0394n[average]. 45', 'The Metripol is an optical microscope-based imaging system, 46', 'which was developed by Dr Glazer (the respondent\u2019s expert), Dr Kaminsky (the appellant\u2019s expert), and Dr Morten Geday (\u201cDr Geday\u201d) (the appellant\u2019s witness) in or around 1995. The Metripol has a polariser that rotates in fixed multiples of different angles (for example, by 30o, 60o, 90o) (\u201cRotation Angles\u201d). At each angle, polarised light passes through the specimen and is captured by a camera. The Metripol calculates the intensities of light received by the camera at different Rotation Angles, and thereafter computes |sin \u03b4|, which is a function of \u03b4.', '33\\u2003It will be recalled that \u03b4 is the optical retardation of light of a particular wavelength that passes through a material, and is related to the birefringence of the material by the formula set out at [27] above. 47', 'As appears from the three graphs below (in particular, the green arrows in graphs (b) and (c)), |sin \u03b4| is the amplitude of a sinusoidal curve (meaning half the distance from the highest point of the curve to its lowest point). This sinusoidal curve is derived by plotting the intensity of polarised light that passes through the diamond specimen on the y-axis, against the polariser\u2019s Rotation Angle on the x-axis. 48', 'Depending on whether and the extent to which the intensity of light varies when the polariser is angled differently, |sin \u03b4| will assume a different value: 49', '', '34\\u2003Third, after computing |sin \u03b4|, the Metripol produces colour-coded images of the material, where the different colours represent different |sin \u03b4| values at any place within the image (the \u201cMetripol |sin \u03b4| Map\u201d). 50', 'The Metripol is capable of refining the |sin \u03b4| value at each pixel position in the Metripol |sin \u03b4| Map. 51', 'An illustration of the Metripol |sin \u03b4| Map can be found in the following diagram, taken from the respondent\u2019s Technology Tutorial slides:', 'The same Metripol |sin \u03b4| Map can also be represented in greyscale. The patent specification of SG 872 states that the spatial variation of |sin \u03b4| can be appreciated from these images. 52', 'The patent specification also states that for each sample, sets of |sin \u03b4| images are to be recorded for analysis. 53', '35\\u2003Fourth, it is agreed between the parties that the Metripol data on its own does not tell the PSA whether the \u03b4 value of a diamond falls within the SG 872 First Order (the \u201cMetripol Uncertainty Problem\u201d). 54', 'The Metripol does not calculate \u03b4. As mentioned, it generates the value of |sin \u03b4|. 55', 'However, each |sin \u03b4| value corresponds to many \u03b4 values, and only one of these \u03b4 values lies within the SG 872 First Order. 56', 'From the |sin \u03b4| value alone, the PSA cannot derive a corresponding \u03b4 value and will not know whether the \u03b4 value of a diamond is within or outside the SG 872 First Order. This point can be illustrated in Figure 13 below, where \u03b41 is the value that lies within the SG 872 First Order: 57', 'If the Metripol shows that the |sin \u03b4| value of the diamond is 0.9, the corresponding \u03b4 value can be 1.12, 2.02, 4.26, 5.16, or any other higher value not reflected in Figure 13 above. 58', '\u03b4 will only be within the SG 872 First Order if it has a value of 1.12, as that is the only value that does not exceed (see above at [31]). The rest of the values lie outside the SG 872 First Order. From this range of possible \u03b4 values, the PSA relying solely on the Metripol reading cannot determine the \u03b4 value of the diamond, and accordingly, cannot ascertain whether \u03b4 is within the SG 872 First Order.', '36\\u2003In this appeal, as they did in the proceedings below, the parties diverge on the issue of whether the PSA knew of solutions to overcome the Metripol Uncertainty Problem at the relevant time. The thrust of the appellant\u2019s contention is that the PSA, faced with the Metripol Uncertainty Problem and with no knowledge of any workable solution at the relevant time, would not be able to determine whether the \u03b4 value of the diamond was within the SG 872 First Order and hence within the scope of the asserted monopoly. For this reason, the appellant contends that SG 872 is insufficient. 59', 'In turn, the respondent\u2019s case is that the PSA would have no difficulty ascertaining that the \u03b4 value of the diamond was within the SG 872 First Order by using various methods, such as the Gap Theory proposed by Dr Glazer. 60', 'We will deal with this issue in our analysis later.', '37\\u2003We now turn to Claim 62, the main process claim in SG 872 to which all other process claims in SG 872 refer. Claim 62 specifies a method of producing low-strain single crystal CVD diamond material that exhibits optical properties defined in the product claims in SG 872. Claim 62 states as follows:', '38\\u2003Certain terms relating to the growth process, which are referred to subsequently, call for further explanation. The \u201csource gas\u201d in the CVD chamber comprises several gases, including a \u201cC\u201d source which is typically methane (CH4) and a source of atomic hydrogen which is typically hydrogen (H2). The parties agree that other gases, such as an inert gas (like argon) and a dopant gas (like nitrogen, boron or phosphorous), a source of impurities which is used to affect the electrical or optical properties of a diamond, are also used depending on the desired characteristics of the CVD diamond. 61', 'Each input gas is controlled by a mass flow controller (\u201cMFC\u201d). The flow of gases across MFCs is measured as cubic centimetres of gas flowing through the MFC per minute (expressed as standard cubic centimetres per minute or \u201csccm\u201d). The concentration of each gas is represented as a percentage, ppm or ppb. 62', 'As for the \u201cplasma etch\u201d performed on the substrate prior to the commencement of the CVD process, this involves \u201cexposing the substrate to a plasma formed by hydrogen (H2) and\/or oxygen (O2) at high temperature in a CVD chamber.\u201d 63', 'The specification of SG 872 states that such in situ plasma etching minimises the surface damage of the substrate. 64', 'We note, however, that the respondent disputes 65', 'whether the use of a plasma etch to achieve this effect is common general knowledge to a PSA (we will explain the concepts of common general knowledge and the PSA at [63]\u2013[75] below).', '39\\u2003The respondent claims that the production of low-strain single crystal CVD diamond material disclosed in Claims 1 to 61 and 72 to 78 was not possible prior to the discovery of the process in Claim 62. 66', 'The respondent argues that the growth process in Claim 62, specifically, the addition of 300ppb to 5ppm nitrogen to the synthesis atmosphere (the \u201cClaim 62 Nitrogen Range\u201d), is novel because it runs contrary to previous thinking that adding nitrogen to the synthesis atmosphere would have a deleterious effect on the quality of the diamond produced; nitrogen was regarded as an impurity. 67', 'As the Judge noted, the common general knowledge at the material time was that the addition of nitrogen would increase birefringence. The Claim 62 Nitrogen Range is therefore the inventive concept asserted in Claim 62 (see Judgment at [253]). We agree. According to the specification of SG 872, the Claim 62 Nitrogen Range is not too high because it accomplishes the aim of \u201cprevent[ing] or reduc[ing] local strain generating defects whilst being low enough to prevent or reduce deleterious absorptions and crystal quality degradation.\u201d 68', 'Nor is the range too low, because, according to SG 872, \u201cmaterial grown under conditions with essentially no nitrogen, or less than 300ppb nitrogen has a comparatively higher level of local strain generating defects\u201d. 69', 'Dr Philippe Bergonzo (\u201cDr Bergonzo\u201d), one of the respondent\u2019s experts, depicted the benefits of operating within the Claim 62 Nitrogen Range as follows (see the curve in black): 70', '40\\u2003As against this, the appellant regards the purported benefits of using the Claim 62 Nitrogen Range as \u201cillusory\u201d and \u201cfalse\u201d. 71', 'It questions why, in the 17 or so years since SG 872, not a single paper has been published discussing or evidencing this discovery. However, as we shall explain, even assuming that the purported benefits of the Claim 62 Nitrogen Range are scientifically true, there are other issues undermining the validity of the patent."}

There was then a meeting on 2 August 2021 (the \u201c2 August 2021 meeting\u201d). Certain variations to the MOA were allegedly discussed at this meeting.

{"casename":"2023_SGCA_7","fact":"3\\u2003The Appellant is an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore. Whilst acting as an advocate and solicitor in a matter before the General Division of the High Court in HC\/OS 1100\/2017 (\u201cOS 1100\u201d) in September 2018, the Appellant made several allegations against the lawyers for the other parties, as well as against the judge, Dedar Singh Gill JC (as he then was) (\u201cGill JC\u201d). Unsurprisingly, complaints were duly made against the Appellant and that led to an investigation by the Respondent.', '4\\u2003By OS 1100, the Appellant\u2019s law practice, Tan & Au LLP, had commenced an interpleader action in respect of moneys held by Tan & Au LLP as stakeholder against seven respondents who had claimed an interest in the moneys. Tan & Au LLP was both the applicant (the \u201cApplicant\u201d) and the solicitors on record for the Applicant in the interpleader action. The 1st, 4th and 5th respondents in OS 1100 were represented by Central Chambers Law Corporation (\u201cCCLC\u201d). The 2nd, 3rd and 6th respondents in OS 1100 were represented by Yeo-Leong & Peh LLC (\u201cYLP\u201d) (now known as Adsan Law LLC). The complaints lodged against the Appellant were by the solicitors of both CCLC and YLP. In these grounds of decision, we refer to the six solicitors as the Complainants.', '5\\u2003The allegations against Gill JC were made during the hearing of OS 1100 in September 2018. On 13 September 2018, after the cross-examination was completed, the Complainants brought to Gill JC\u2019s attention, in chambers, that Tan & Au LLP had included in their Bundle of Documents a document that was not in evidence. Gill JC directed that the new document was not to be admitted. Shortly thereafter, Tan & Au LLP filed a recusal application against Gill JC. In support of the recusal application, the Appellant filed a supporting affidavit the following day (the \u201cRecusal Affidavit\u201d), where she made certain allegations against Gill JC as well as some of the Complainants. The allegations formed the subject matter of the complaints against her.', '6\\u2003On 17 September 2018, Tan & Au LLP filed their Bundle of Documents, which still contained the new evidence on page 98 (which was subsequently ordered to be struck out by the court) (\u201cPage 98\u201d). Notably, CCLC also invited Tan & Au LLP to expunge portions of the Recusal Affidavit; this was on the basis that those portions contained allegations against other solicitors, made without giving the other solicitors an opportunity to respond. Tan & Au LLP declined to remove the impugned portions. CCLC then applied to court to strike out these paragraphs (the \u201cFirst Striking Out Application\u201d). The solicitors from YLP also sought to expunge Page 98, as Gill JC had directed its exclusion. The Appellant declined to remove the impugned portions of the Recusal Affidavit. She responded by e-mail on 20 September 2018 (the \u201c20 September 2018 E-mail\u201d) to one Mr David Kong (\u201cMr Kong\u201d), who was a solicitor of YLP. In the 20 September 2018 E-mail, the Appellant claimed that she had left several messages for Mr Kong, and her calls had not been returned. Additionally, she accused YLP of suppressing the truth from their clients, and at the same time, informed them that Tan & Au LLP would be filing the Amended Bundle of Documents. We set out an extract of the 20 September 2018 E-mail:', '', '7\\u2003After the 20 September 2018 E-mail was sent, Mr Kong filed an affidavit to refute the allegation, stating that he did not receive any calls from the Appellant. YLP also took out a separate application to remove Page 98 of the Bundle of Documents (the \u201cSecond Striking Out Application\u201d). On 25 September 2018, the Striking Out Applications and the Recusal Application were heard. Both Striking Out Applications were allowed, while the Recusal Application was dismissed. After the hearing, Tan & Au LLP requested further arguments on 28 September 2018 (the \u201cRequest for Further Arguments\u201d), wherein another allegation against Mr Kong was made. The Appellant alleged that Mr Kong had lied on oath and committed perjury when he said on affidavit that he did not receive any calls from the Appellant, as the Appellant had indeed made several phone calls to him and left several messages. The Appellant also lodged a police report on 27 September 2018, essentially repeating the same allegation that Mr Kong had committed perjury by stating in his affidavit that he had not received any of the calls referred to in the Appellant\u2019s 20 September 2018 E-mail (the \u201cPolice Report\u201d). Annexed to the Police Report were screenshots from a call log and a chat log showing that there were calls and messages sent on 13 September 2018.', '8\\u2003Gill JC declined the Appellant\u2019s Request for Further Arguments on 10 October 2018. Crucially, Gill JC agreed that in Mr Kong\u2019s affidavit, he was clearly referring to the fact that no calls had been made on 20 September 2018, and not that none had been made on 13 September 2018. This was in response to the allegation in the Appellant\u2019s 20 September 2018 E-mail that Mr Kong \u201chad failed to return [their] call\u201d. Likewise, Mr Kong\u2019s affidavit was also referring to the messages supposedly left on 20 September 2018.

The complaints were numerous, and the Inquiry Committee (see [11] below) considered there to be six categories of complaints dealing with various breaches of the PCR. Four of the categories pertained to the following complaints:', '(a)\\u2003Category 1 complaints: these related to the Appellant\u2019s allegations that Mr Kong had committed perjury by lying on oath that he had not received any calls or messages from the Appellant. The Complainants claimed that these were false allegations, and the Appellant was as such in breach of rr 7(1) and 7(2) of the PCR.', '(b)\\u2003Category 3 complaints: these complaints related to the Appellant\u2019s and Mr Au\u2019s conduct in filing Page 98 in the Applicant\u2019s Bundle of Documents in breach of the court\u2019s previous directions, and in reproducing in the Applicant\u2019s Closing Submissions a paragraph which had been expunged for quoting Page 98. These were allegedly a breach of r 13 of the PCR.', '(c)\\u2003Category 4 complaints: the Appellant and Mr Au allegedly breached r 13 of the PCR as they did not treat the court with respect in making false and grave allegations against Gill JC in the Recusal Affidavit and in the Applicant\u2019s Closing Submissions.', '(d)\\u2003Category 6 complaints: the Appellant and Mr Au allegedly failed to provide other solicitors with the opportunity to respond to the allegations made against them in the Request for Further Arguments and in the Applicant\u2019s Closing Submissions, which breached r 29 of the PCR.', '11\\u2003An Inquiry Committee (\u201cIC\u201d) was convened. The IC issued a report on 30 July 2019 (the \u201cIC Report\u201d) following a hearing held on 17 July 2019. The IC\u2019s findings were as follows:', '(a)\\u2003Category 1 complaints: the IC noted that the complaints were that the allegations of perjury were false. However, for the purpose of determining whether there was a breach of r 7 of the PCR, which is that it is not proper for a lawyer to make allegations about another lawyer, it was not relevant whether the allegations were true or not. Although the Appellant did not make the allegations maliciously, and did not knowingly make a false statement that she had left messages for Mr Kong on 20 September 2018 (when she likely had those from 13 September 2018 in mind), it remained the case that the Appellant had repeatedly made serious allegations against various parties, particularly Mr Kong, in less than courteous language. The IC was of the view that there was no cause of sufficient gravity for the matter to be referred to a Disciplinary Tribunal (\u201cDT\u201d), but the Appellant should be ordered to pay a penalty as she had acted in breach of rr 7(1) and 7(2) of the PCR.', '(b)\\u2003Category 3 complaints: the IC accepted that the filing of the Applicant\u2019s Bundle of Documents with Page 98 included may have been due to an error, and that there was no intention to breach Gill JC\u2019s direction knowingly and deliberately. However, this did not explain why the Applicant\u2019s Closing Submissions reproduced a paragraph that had earlier been expunged for quoting Page 98. It remained the case that the Appellant had repeatedly acted in breach of the court\u2019s directions and orders to expunge Page 98. The IC therefore recommended a formal investigation by a DT against the Appellant and Mr Au on a charge of breaching r 13 of the PCR.', '(c)\\u2003Category 4 complaints: the IC considered that it was not within its purview to comment on whether the allegations made against Gill JC were false. Further, the making of allegations against Gill JC did not, in itself, amount to a breach of the PCR, as it was inevitable that allegations of bias would be made in recusal applications. Nevertheless, it considered that allegations of bias on the part of a judge are grave and should not be made without clear justification. The IC recommended a formal investigation by a DT against the Appellant and Mr Au on a charge of breaching r 13 of the PCR.', '(d)\\u2003Category 6 complaints: the IC noted that the Appellant and Mr Au\u2019s acknowledgement that they had not given the Complainants the opportunity to respond to the allegations made against them in the Request for Further Arguments and the Applicant\u2019s Closing Submissions. The IC referred a charge to a DT for a breach of r 29 of the PCR in respect of the allegations made against Mr Kong in their Request for Further Arguments and in the Applicant\u2019s Closing Submissions.', '12\\u2003Following the issuance of the IC Report, the Respondent sent a letter to the Appellant on 18 November 2019 (the \u201c18 November 2019 Letter\u201d) with the IC Report enclosed, and informed the Appellant that the Respondent had adopted the IC\u2019s findings and determinations. In respect of the Category 1 complaints in particular, the Respondent stated that it had considered the IC Report and determined that no formal investigation by a DT was necessary, but that the Appellant should be given a warning, a reprimand or be ordered to pay a penalty of not more than $10,000. The Appellant was asked if she wished to be heard before the Council made its decision.', '13\\u2003A DT was appointed to address the charges referred to it against the Appellant according to the Council\u2019s recommendations. As for Mr Au, the DT found that there was a reasonable doubt as to whether he was present at the hearing in chambers on 13 September 2018. There was also no direct evidence that he was involved in drafting the relevant documents where the allegations were raised. The charges against him were therefore dismissed.', '14\\u2003The first charge (the \u201cFirst Charge\u201d) the DT found the Appellant to be guilty of was with respect to the disrespectful remarks made against Gill JC that formed the subject of the Category 4 complaints. The Appellant therefore breached r 13(2) of the PCR which is the duty to be respectful of a court. This charge was made out, save for one statement stated in the charge. This matter, however, is not the subject of the Appellant\u2019s appeal.', '15\\u2003The second charge concerned the allegations made against Mr Kong and other solicitors, as stated in Tan & Au LLP\u2019s Request for Further Arguments and the Applicant\u2019s Closing Submissions. These relate to the Category 6 complaints. The Appellant sought to challenge this on appeal. The second charge (the \u201cSecond Charge\u201d) read as follows:', '16\\u2003For the Second Charge, the Respondent contended before the DT that the phrase \u201csilence is telling\u201d in the Applicant\u2019s Closing Submissions meant that the Complainants, particularly Mr Chooi, Mr Kong and Mr Fong, had something to hide. The DT was unable to accept the Respondent\u2019s view. While it reflected a regrettable choice of phrase, the point made was more an observation about the proceedings than an allegation against other solicitors. But with respect to the allegation made against Mr Kong in the Request for Further Arguments, the DT was of the view that there could be no doubt that the Appellant had alleged that Mr Kong had lied on oath. It was no answer to the charge that Mr Kong had the opportunity in his affidavit of 21 September 2018 to respond to the allegation. Although Mr Kong responded to the Appellant\u2019s 20 September 2018 E-mail through his affidavit, the Request for Further Arguments filed by the Appellant continued to assert that Mr Kong\u2019s response was false, and that Mr Kong was lying on oath. Hence, the Second Charge was made out in so far as the Appellant\u2019s allegation against Mr Kong in the Request for Further Arguments was concerned. Accordingly, the DT found that there was a breach of r 29 of the PCR, which states that a legal practitioner must not permit an allegation to be made against another legal practitioner in any document filed on behalf of the first legal practitioner\u2019s client in any court proceedings, without the other practitioner being given the opportunity to respond to the allegation. We pause here to mention that Mr Kong unexpectedly passed on sometime in February 2019.', '17\\u2003For completeness, we add that the charge relating to the Category 3 complaints was dismissed by the DT.', '18\\u2003Following the DT\u2019s report, the Council accepted the DT\u2019s findings, and, after hearing the Appellant, determined that a penalty of $10,000 should be imposed on the Appellant for breaching rr 7(1) and 7(2) of the PCR for the allegations against Mr Kong (ie, the subject of the Category 1 complaints), r 13(2) of the PCR for making disrespectful statements to the court (ie, the subject of the Category 4 complaints and the First Charge), and r 29 of the PCR for failing to give Mr Kong an opportunity to respond to the allegations (ie, the subject of the Category 6 complaints and the Second Charge). The Council\u2019s decision was communicated to the Appellant in a letter dated 8 April 2021 (the \u201c8 April 2021 Letter\u201d). Prior to the Council\u2019s determination, the Appellant was given the chance to respond and did submit two written mitigation statements dated 9 November 2020 and 3 March 2021, as well as an oral mitigation before the Council on 25 March 2021.', '19\\u2003By way of OS 432, the Appellant applied under s 95 of the LPA to have the court review and set aside the decision of the Council to impose a global penalty of $10,000, as conveyed to the Appellant in the 8 April 2021 Letter."}
{"casename":"2023_SGCA_8","fact":"7\\u2003The complete facts are set out in the trial judge\u2019s (the \u201cJudge\u201d) grounds of decision in Public Prosecutor v Tangaraju s\/o Suppiah [2018] SGHC 279 (\u201cthe GD\u201d). I briefly summarise the salient facts below.', '8\\u2003The Applicant was charged with abetting one Mogan Valo (\u201cMogan\u201d) by engaging in a conspiracy with him to traffic in cannabis by delivering 1017.9g of cannabis (the \u201cDrugs\u201d) to himself, an offence under s 5(1)(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (\u201cMDA\u201d), read with s 5(2) and s 12 of the MDA (the \u201cCharge\u201d).', '9\\u2003Mogan was the courier in this case. Sometime prior to his arrest on 6 September 2013, a Malaysian man known to Mogan as \u201cSelva\u201d gave Mogan the contact number of a person whom \u201cSelva\u201d said could help Mogan find a job in Singapore. That person\u2019s contact number was xx39 (the \u201cfirst number\u201d), which Mogan saved as \u201cIndia\u201d. Subsequently, \u201cIndia\u201d gave Mogan a second number to contact him at, xx93 (the \u201csecond number\u201d), which Mogan saved as \u201cIndia.jus\u201d.', '10\\u2003On 5 September 2013, \u201cSelva\u201d instructed Mogan to deliver \u201cya lei\u201d (which translates to \u201cleaves\u201d in Tamil, and which Mogan understood to mean cannabis) from Malaysia to \u201cIndia\u201d in Singapore at the carpark of PSA Vista, or, failing which, the McDonald\u2019s outlet at West Coast Park (\u201cthe McDonald cafe\u201d).', '11\\u2003On 6 September 2013, Mogan collected the Drugs from a runner of \u201cSelva\u201d and drove into Singapore with his girlfriend, one Salina Binte Salim (\u201cSalina\u201d), carrying the Drugs. He cleared the Woodlands Checkpoint at around 9pm. At around 9.25pm, Mogan received a call from \u201cIndia\u201d, using the first number. He informed \u201cIndia\u201d that he was on his way to PSA Vista. Before he could deliver the Drugs, Mogan was arrested by officers from Central Narcotics Bureau (\u201cCNB\u201d) at 10.10pm.', '12\\u2003Upon his arrest, Mogan agreed to assist in a follow-up operation against \u201cIndia\u201d. Under the direction of Station Inspector Tay Cher Yeen (\u201cSI Tay\u201d), Mogan arranged to meet \u201cIndia\u201d at the toilet of the McDonald cafe through a series of phone calls with the first number.', '13\\u2003On 7 September 2013 at 1.14am, Mogan received a call from \u201cIndia\u201d and was told that \u201cIndia\u201d was waiting at the toilet of the McDonald cafe. Shortly after, at around 1.19am, one Suresh s\/o Subramaniam (\u201cSuresh\u201d) was arrested whilst walking out of the toilet.', '14\\u2003After Suresh\u2019s arrest, Mogan then made two further calls to \u201cIndia\u201d under the direction of SI Tay, and informed \u201cIndia\u201d that he was at the toilet of the McDonald cafe. At 1.38am, \u201cIndia\u201d told Mogan that he was no longer at the McDonald cafe, and that he had asked his friend, whom \u201cIndia\u201d described as a \u201cfat Indian\u201d, to collect the \u201cya lei\u201d from Mogan.', '15\\u2003Suresh was the Applicant\u2019s childhood friend and knew him as \u201cAppu\u201d. According to Suresh, sometime in July 2013, the two exchanged phone numbers. The Applicant gave him two phone numbers, which corresponded with the first and second numbers given to Mogan. Suresh saved the first and second numbers as \u201cAppu bro\u201d and \u201cApu2\u201d respectively.', '16\\u2003According to Suresh, sometime in the evening on 6 September 2013, he met the Applicant by chance at the void deck of Block 34 Dover Road. After the two parted ways, Suresh met his friend, one Shashi Kumar (\u201cShashi\u201d), who had the use of a car. At 7.57pm, Suresh sent a text message to the Applicant at the second number, stating \u201ccar stan by [sic] ready\u201d.', '17\\u2003On 6 September 2013 at around 8pm, using Shashi\u2019s car, Suresh and Shashi drove to Clementi to obtain medical certificates to excuse themselves from attending urine tests that they were due to go for. They then bought dinner at the McDonald cafe at around 9pm.', '18\\u2003From 12.05am to 1.16am on 7 September 2013, Suresh spoke with the Applicant on the first number in a series of nine phone calls. According to Suresh, the Applicant informed him that the Applicant\u2019s friend would be arriving at the McDonald cafe, and he asked Suresh to call him if he were to see a silver car bearing a certain vehicle registration number. Over the course of the night, the Applicant called Suresh repeatedly to check if he had seen a car matching the description. At 1.19am, Suresh received a call from the Applicant, who asked him if there was anyone in the toilet. Suresh replied in the negative and was walking out from the toilet when he was arrested by officers from CNB.', '19\\u2003The Applicant was not apprehended along with Mogan and Suresh on 6 and 7 September 2013. He was first placed under arrest on 23 January 2014 for failing to report for a urine test and for drug consumption. Sometime in March 2014, the Applicant was identified as a person potentially linked to Mogan\u2019s and Suresh\u2019s arrests. By that time, the Applicant was already in remand and none of his mobile phones could be recovered for analysis.', '20\\u2003At the trial, the crux of the Prosecution\u2019s case was that the Applicant used the first number to communicate with both Mogan and Suresh to coordinate the delivery of the Drugs to himself. The crux of the defence was that the Applicant had nothing to do with the first number and was not involved in the transaction at all.', '21\\u2003The Judge found that the Applicant was the user of the first number on 6 and 7 September 2013 to coordinate the delivery of Drugs. The Judge relied on: (a) Suresh\u2019s testimony that the Applicant was the person who used both the first and second numbers and in particular, the person who used the first number to contact him on 6 and 7 September 2013; (b) Mogan\u2019s testimony that the first and second numbers belonged to the same person; and (c) the Applicant\u2019s own admission in his statement recorded on 24 April 2014 that he was the user of the second number. Although the Applicant sought to explain that he had lost his mobile phone bearing the second number on 7 August 2013, the Judge was not persuaded by his explanation because it was only mentioned in his statement of 23 May 2014 instead of his earlier statement which was recorded on 24 April 2014.', '22\\u2003The Judge also rejected the Applicant\u2019s argument that Suresh was the person who had coordinated the transaction using the first number. Suresh\u2019s mobile phone which was seized upon his arrest at the McDonald cafe showed that his phone number was xx32. Furthermore, after Suresh\u2019s arrest at around 1.20am on 7 September 2013, Mogan spoke to \u201cIndia\u201d on five further occasions from 1.20am to 2am, which suggested that Suresh could not have been \u201cIndia\u201d.', '23\\u2003The Judge therefore found that the Applicant did engage in a conspiracy to traffic the Drugs by coordinating the delivery of the Drugs by Mogan and the receipt of the Drugs by Suresh. Given the large quantity of the cannabis involved (being more than twice the capital limit), and since the Applicant had not led any evidence that the Drugs were intended for his own consumption, the Judge found that the Applicant had intended to traffic in the Drugs. Accordingly, the Judge convicted the Applicant of the Charge and imposed the mandatory death sentence on him.', '24\\u2003On 18 October 2018, the Applicant filed the Notice of Appeal against his conviction. On 14 August 2019, the Court of Appeal in CCA 38 dismissed his appeal with brief oral grounds. The Court of Appeal agreed with the Judge that the objective evidence, coupled with Mogan\u2019s and Suresh\u2019s testimony and the Applicant\u2019s own admission, suggested that the Applicant was the user of the first number who coordinated the delivery of the Drugs on 6 and 7 September 2013. The Court of Appeal similarly rejected the Applicant\u2019s belated attempt to distance himself from the second number. The Court of Appeal also rejected the Applicant\u2019s other arguments on appeal, in particular his argument that the Prosecution had failed to disclose Mogan\u2019s and Suresh\u2019s statements to him.', '25\\u2003On 7 November 2022, the Applicant filed the present application, CA\/CM 25\/2022 (\u201cCM 25\u201d) under s 392 (on taking additional evidence) and s 407 (on form and issue of criminal motions) of the CPC for leave to adduce \u201cfurther evidence\u201d. However, neither the motion nor the supporting affidavit stated that CM 25 was an application under s 394H of the CPC for permission to apply to review the concluded appeal in CCA 38.', '26\\u2003Subsequently, the Applicant clarified at a Case Management Conference on 11 November 2022 that CM 25 was meant to be an s 394H application. The Applicant requested for two weeks to file the amended application under s 394H. The Prosecution did not object to the Applicant\u2019s request and the Court of Appeal granted the Applicant\u2019s request, by consent, to amend CM 25. The Applicant filed the amended criminal motion, amended affidavit and written submissions for CM 25 on 9 December 2022.', '27\\u2003Under s 394H(6)(a) of the CPC, an application for permission is to be heard by a single judge sitting in the Court of Appeal where the appellate court in question is the Court of Appeal. It is on this basis that I am determining this application for permission."}
{"casename":"2023_SGCA_9","fact":"5\\u2003On 23 October 2017, the applicant ordered two \u201cbatu\u201d (or bundles) of \u201cpanas\u201d (a street name for diamorphine) from one \u201cAbang\u201d, his Malaysian drug supplier. The applicant received the drugs on 24 October 2017 and was arrested by officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (\u201cCNB\u201d) on the same day. Following searches by the CNB officers, the following items, among other things, were found on the applicant\u2019s person or in his flat:', '(a)\\u2003Two packets of granular\/powdery substances, which were the drugs the applicant had ordered from \u201cAbang\u201d, were seized from the basket of the applicant\u2019s bicycle. These were found to contain a total of 901.5g of granular\/powdery substance containing not less than 35.85g of diamorphine (the \u201cRelevant Drugs\u201d).', '(b)\\u2003One yellow cut straw (which was examined and found to be stained with diamorphine), a large assortment of empty zip lock bags, one piece of stained aluminium foil, one improvised smoking utensil, two stained spoons, two lighters and four digital weighing scales were found beneath the kitchen sink in the applicant\u2019s flat.', '6\\u2003The applicant was charged under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (the \u201cMDA\u201d) with one charge of trafficking in a controlled drug. At the trial, the applicant did not dispute his possession of the Relevant Drugs or that he had knowledge that the Relevant Drugs were diamorphine. As the presumption of trafficking under s 17(c) of the MDA was triggered, the burden of proof was on the applicant to show that the Relevant Drugs were not in his possession for that purpose. The only defence raised by the applicant to rebut the presumption of trafficking was that the Relevant Drugs were meant solely for his own consumption (or to be given to his friends occasionally as part of some reciprocal arrangements to help each other), but not for trafficking to anyone else. He claimed to be a heavy user of diamorphine, smoking two to three packets of 8g (ie, 16\u201324g) of diamorphine per day: see Public Prosecutor v A Steven s\/o Paul Raj [2021] SGHC 218 (the \u201cGD\u201d) at [1], [6] and [8].', '7\\u2003The trial judge (the \u201cJudge\u201d) found that the presumption of trafficking under s 17(c) of the MDA was not rebutted as the applicant had failed to establish his total consumption defence on a balance of probabilities, and therefore convicted the applicant of the charge against him. In particular, the Judge reasoned that the applicant\u2019s evidence on his claimed daily rate of consumption was contradicted by the evidence of the doctors who had examined him, and the applicant could not satisfactorily explain those discrepancies. The applicant\u2019s total consumption defence was also undermined by, inter alia, the large amount of the Relevant Drugs and his possession of paraphernalia normally used in drug trafficking: see the GD at [10]\u2013[12], [17]\u2013[45] and [51].', '8\\u2003The applicant\u2019s case on appeal, like his case at the trial, was confined to his total consumption defence. The Court of Appeal affirmed the Judge\u2019s decision that the applicant had failed to rebut the presumption of trafficking under s 17(c) of the MDA and dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal against his conviction and sentence.', '9\\u2003The Court of Appeal affirmed the Judge\u2019s conclusion that the applicant had failed to establish his claimed rate of consumption of 16\u201324g of diamorphine per day. Although the applicant\u2019s claimed rate of consumption was recorded in a statement taken from him under s 22 of the CPC on 30 October 2017 (the \u201cFirst Long Statement\u201d), it was significantly higher than the consumption rates recorded by the doctors who had examined the applicant both before and after the First Long Statement (A Steven (CA) at [31]\u2013[33]):', '(a)\\u2003Dr Tan Chong Hun (\u201cDr Tan\u201d), a prison medical officer of the Changi Prison Complex Medical Centre who had examined the applicant on 26 October 2017, recorded that the applicant\u2019s consumption rate was 4g of diamorphine per day.', '(b)\\u2003In a report dated 28 October 2017 which was countersigned by Dr Munidasa Winslow, it was certified that the applicant consumed 4g of diamorphine per day.', '(c)\\u2003In the First Long Statement recorded on 30 October 2017, the applicant stated: \u201cThese days I smoke about 2\u20133 8g packets of panas every day.\u201d', '(d)\\u2003Dr Jaydip Sarkar (\u201cDr Sarkar\u201d), a psychiatrist with the Institute of Mental Health at the material time who had conducted interviews with the applicant on 3, 6 and 9 November 2017, recorded in his report dated 14 November 2017 that the applicant claimed to have consumed \u201cone packet of heroin daily\u201d of about 8g each.', '10\\u2003The explanations offered by the applicant for the substantially inconsistent consumption rates he provided to the doctors were unconvincing. The applicant\u2019s assertions that his consumption rates were incorrectly recorded were never put to Dr Tan and Dr Sarkar. The applicant also provided no basis to disturb the Judge\u2019s finding of fact that his mental state did not affect his communication with the doctors (A Steven (CA) at [29] and [35]).', '11\\u2003The Court of Appeal also considered that the applicant\u2019s total consumption defence was further undermined by the following factors:', '(a)\\u2003The applicant possessed paraphernalia normally associated with drug trafficking activities, whose utility was obviously for the preparation of drugs for sale. The sheer amount of empty zip lock bags and weighing scales found in the applicant\u2019s flat constituted objective evidence that the Relevant Drugs were meant for trafficking (A Steven (CA) at [37]\u2013[40]).', '(b)\\u2003The applicant made certain admissions in his statements and to Dr Sarkar to the effect that he sold small quantities of diamorphine to his friends on a regular basis (A Steven (CA) at [41]\u2013[43]).', '(c)\\u2003The large amount of the Relevant Drugs found in the applicant\u2019s possession suggested that the Relevant Drugs were meant for trafficking. The applicant\u2019s explanation that \u201cAbang\u201d had persuaded him to purchase a larger quantity of the said drugs to avoid supply disruptions during the Deepavali festive period only emerged belatedly in a statement recorded from the applicant under s 22 of the CPC on 22 February 2018 (the \u201cSecond Long Statement\u201d), and appeared to be a mere afterthought (A Steven (CA) at [45]\u2013[46])."}
