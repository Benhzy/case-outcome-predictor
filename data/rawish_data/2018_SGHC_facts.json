{"casename":"2018_SGHC_10","fact":"the facts were undisputed. These were contained in a \nstatement of agreed  facts which was furnished pursuant to s 267(1)  of the CPC \n(\u201cASOF\u201d). I now set out the key aspects contained  in the ASOF.  \nArrest of the  Accused\n5 The Accused is a 34-year-old Malaysian. On 16 May 2016, at about \n5am, the Accused drove a Malaysian-registered lorry bearing registration \nnumber NDB9549 (\u201cthe Lorry\u201d) from Johor Bahru into Singapore. He was \naccompanied by Anathan Kanapathy (\u201cAnathan\u201d), a lorry attendant.  At the \nWoodlands Checkpoint,  the Lorry failed  an image check, and the Accused was \ndirected to drive the Lorry to the  Cargo Command Centre for further  checks. \n6 At the Cargo  Command Centre, officers of the Immigration and \nCheckpoints Authority  (\u201cICA\u201d) searched  the Lorry. Nothing  incriminating was \nfound at the back of the Lorry. When  the Accused  was informed that the front  \ncabin of  the Lorry would be searched,  he sighed. \n7 During the search  of the front cabin  of the Lorry, Sgt Muhammad Adi \nbin Zaroni (\u201cSgt Adi\u201d) discovered three dark green plastic bags (which were \nlater marked as \u201cA1\u201d, \u201cA2\u201d and \u201cA3\u201d) inside a compartment beneath a brown \nmattress placed behind the passenger  seat. Sgt Adi took a black bundle  out of \none of the dark green  plastic bags. The Accused then shouted twice in Malay \n\u201cBukan saya  punya\u201d  \u2013 which means \u201cIt\u2019s not mine\u201d.  \n8 Suspecting that the black bundle contained drugs,  W\/Insp Siti Chotidjah \nbinte Mohd Ali (\u201cW\/Insp Chotidjah\u201d) instructed  the officers to stop the search, \nand to place the Accused  under arrest.  The black bundle taken out by Sgt Adi \n3\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Siva Raman [2018]  SGHC  10\nwas placed between the driver seat and the passenger seat, while the three dark \ngreen plastic bags were placed on the passenger  seat. W\/Insp  Chotidjah \nproceeded to inform the Central Narcotics Bureau (\u201cCNB\u201d) of the matter.  \nRecovery of  the drug  exhibits\n9 At about 5.15am,  a party  of CNB  officers  arrived at the scene. At about \n5.25am, in the presence of the Accused, Sgt Muhammad Zuhairi bin Zainuri \n(\u201cSgt Zuhairi\u201d)  emptied the remaining  contents  of the three dark green  plastic \nbags. In total,  there  were  six packets of powdery\/granular substance (later  \nestablished to contain diamorphine)  and three packets of crystalline substance  \n(later established to contain  methamphetamine). Specifically,  including the \nblack bundle  taken out earlier by Sgt Adi, the three dark green  plastic bags \ncontained the following: \n(a) In the dark green plastic bag marked as \u201cA1\u201d, there were three \nbundles wrapped with black tape (which  were marked as \u201cA1A\u201d, \u201cA1B\u201d  \nand \u201cA1C\u201d respectively), each containing  a packet of powdery\/granular \nsubstance (which were  marked as \u201cA1A1A\u201d, \u201cA1B1A\u201d and \u201cA1C1A\u201d \nrespectively). There  was also one block  wrapped with black tape (which  \nwas marked as \u201cA1D\u201d),  containing  one packet  of crystalline  substance \n(which was marked as  \u201cA1D1A1\u201d).\n(b) In the second  dark green plastic  bag marked as \u201cA2\u201d, there were \nthree bundles wrapped with black tape (which  were marked as \u201cA2A\u201d, \n\u201cA2B\u201d and \u201cA2C\u201d respectively), which in turn contained three packets  \nof powdery\/granular substance (which were marked as \u201cA2A1\u201d, A2B1\u201d  \nand A2C1A\u201d respectively). \n4\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Siva Raman [2018]  SGHC  10\n(c) In the third dark green plastic  bag marked  as \u201cA3\u201d, there  was one \nblock wrapped with black tape (which  was marked as \u201cA3A1A\u201d), which  \nin turn contained two packets of crystalline  substance (which were later \nmarked as  \u201cA3A1A1A1\u201d  and A3A1A1B1\u201d).  \nAnalysis of  the drug  exhibits\n10 Subsequently, the CNB  submitted the nine packets to the Health \nSciences Authority for analysis. The six packets of granular\/powdery substance \ncontained not less than 2,749.9 grams of the granular\/powdery substance which \nwas found to contain not less than 108.81 grams of diamorphine. As for the \nthree packets of crystalline substance, these were  found to contain  not less than \n473.6 grams  of the crystalline substance  which  was found to contain  not less \nthan 315.74 grams of methamphetamine. \nStatements of the Accused \n11 Apart from the undisputed facts  set out above, the Prosecution also \nrelied on ten statements which were recorded  from the Accused in the course of \ninvestigations. The Accused accepted that he provided the ten statements  \nvoluntarily, and did not challenge the admissibility of any of them . However,  \nthe Accused  questioned  whether, in the course of the recording  of the \nstatements, the term \u201cdrugs\u201d  was properly interpreted to the Accused in Tamil,  \nand\/or whether  the Tamil terms used by the interpreters were properly \nunderstood by the Accused. He also challenged  aspects of his knowledge  of the \ndifferent types of drugs. I  shall return to deal  with the objections at [24] below.    \n12 In a contemporaneous  statement recorded on 16 May 2016 at about  \n7.50am by W\/Sgt Rajendran Janani, the Accused denied any knowledge  of the \nbundles in the Lorry. In the two cautioned statements recorded on 16 May 2016 \n5\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Siva Raman [2018]  SGHC  10\nat about  9.46pm and 10.32pm by ASP Prashant s\/o Sukumaran under s 23 of \nthe CPC with the assistance of a Tamil interpreter Raman  Narayanan  (\u201cMr  \nRaman\u201d), the Accused  denied the charges.  He claimed that one Ganesan  A\/L \nSukumaran (\u201cGanesan\u201d) placed the \u201cstuff\u201d in the Lorry. \n13 The remaining seven statements were  recorded by the Investigation \nOfficer, ASP Mohammad Imran bin Salim (\u201cIO Imran\u201d), pursuant to s 22 of the \nCPC between 18 May 2016 and 24 October 2016 (\u201cthe  long statements\u201d). In the \nrecording process, IO Imran was assisted by a Tamil interpreter,  Malliga \nAnandha Krishnan (\u201cMdm Malliga\u201d). In the first two long statements, the \nAccused maintained that he did not know of the nine bundles  of drugs  in the \nLorry. From  the third  long statement onwards, the Accused admitted that he \nbrought the nine bundles of drugs into Singapore. While he knew that the \nbundles contained drugs, he denied knowledge  of the type of drugs.  I now set \nout the contents of the long statements  in more  detail: \n(a) In the first long statement recorded  on 18 May 2016, the Accused \nsaid that he knew what  drugs were, and that drugs \u201cruin[ed] people\u2019s  \nlives\u201d. He said he had seen people taking \u201cice\u201d  in his hometown, and \nthat he had seen \u201cother  types of drugs such as Heroin  and Ganja in the \nMalaysian newspapers\u201d.  \nTurning to the Lorry, the Accused said that he owned  it, and used it to \nmake deliveries to Singapore. In February 2016, Ganesan asked  to hire \nthe Lorry from the Accused. The Accused agreed. He was newly \nmarried, and he intended to go on a honeymoon with his wife. Also, he \nhad bought three shops, and was renting each for RM$1,500 per month. \nFinancially, he was able to take a break from  driving the Lorry.  The \nAccused asked Ganesan to pay him RM$1,400 for every delivery made \n6\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Siva Raman [2018]  SGHC  10\nusing the Lorry. Ganesan agreed  and began  using the Lorry to make \ndeliveries into Singapore. In total,  Ganesan hired the Lorry on 10 \noccasions, being five times each in March  and April 2016. Ganesan paid \nhim promptly after  each  delivery.  \nBefore the last time Ganesan hired the Lorry  on 29 April 2016, the \nAccused started hearing rumours that Ganesan was using  the Lorry  to \nbring drugs into Singapore. The Accused did not know \u201cwhat type of \ndrugs they were but the word that was generally used was \u2018bothai \nmarunthu\u2019\u201d.  In Tamil,  the term means drugs. After the Accused handed  \nGanesan the key on 29 April 2016, a friend of Ganesan\u2019s called \n\u201cPrakash\u201d confirmed that Ganesan was using  the Lorry  to bring drugs \ninto Singapore. When Ganesan returned the Accused  the Lorry on 1 May \n2016, the Accused confronted Ganesan. Ganesan denied that he was \nusing the Lorry to bring drugs into Singapore. The Accused scolded him, \nand they almost got into a fight. Thereafter, the Accused stopped  renting \nthe Lorry  to Ganesan.\n(b) In the second long statement, also recorded on 18 May 2016, the \nAccused said that he had known Ganesan for about six years. When he \nfirst met Ganesan, both of them were lorry attendants.  Thereafter, they \nwould sometimes meet at petrol stations  and rest stops for lorry drivers.  \nOn one such occasion, they exchanged  contact numbers. The Accused \ninvited Ganesan to his wedding reception, and it was at the wedding \nreception that Ganesan  asked to borrow the Lorry.  \nOn 16 May 2016, the Accused was delivering  a consignment of empty  \npaint tin cans and spare parts in the Lorry  to Singapore. During the \nsearch of the Lorry by the ICA officers at Woodlands Checkpoint, he \n7\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Siva Raman [2018]  SGHC  10\nwas shown a plastic  bag. He did not know what was inside the plastic \nbag.\n(c) In the third long statement recorded on 19 May 2016, the \nAccused provided descriptions of \u201cice\u201d, \u201cganja\u201d  and \u201cheroin\u201d.  The \nAccused said he did not know who the items in the Lorry belonged to. \nThen, he said that he thought  Ganesan  might have put the drugs  inside \nthe Lorry to take revenge  on him. After  that, according to IO Imran\u2019s \nnote recorded  within  the third long statement, the Accused hesitated. \nThen, the Accused  admitted  that he brought  the drugs  into Singapore. \nHe explained that on 12 May 2016, Ganesan had called him on his \nhandphone. Ganesan  told him that after he had taken the Lorry back, \nGanesan got into some trouble. As Ganesan was not able to make a \ndelivery, he had to pay some  money for the failed  delivery. Ganesan \nasked the Accused to help him make  the delivery.  The Accused  said that \n\u201cI know  that \u2018Ganesan\u2019  wants me to deliver drugs into Singapore. I \nsuspected that it was drugs as he had not denied it when I had confronted \nhim on 1st May 2016.\u201d Ganesan offered the Accused RM$10,000  as \npayment.\nGanesan called  the Accused on 13 and 14 May 2016  about the same \nmatter. Ganesan confirmed that the payment  would be RM$10,000. The \nAccused agreed to carry out the delivery. Ganesan told the Accused to \ngo to a \u201cPetron\u201d  petrol station at Skudai on 16 May 2016,  at about 2am. \nOn 16 May 2016, as the Accused was driving the Lorry, Ganesan called \nand asked him if he had reached the \u201cPetron\u201d petrol station. The Accused \nsaid that he would arrive in about five to ten minutes\u2019 time. Ganesan told \nhim to wait there at the \u201cPetron\u201d petrol  station, and that a \u201cPerdana\u201d car \n8\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Siva Raman [2018]  SGHC  10\nwould go there. Someone  would pass him the \u201cjaman\u201d. \u201cJaman\u201d meant  \n\u201cthing\u201d in Tamil. The Accused did not ask Ganesan what the \u201cthing\u201d  \nwas but he knew it was \u201cdrugs\u201d. Ganesan also told the Accused to drive \nstraight to Sungei  Kadut  after clearing Singapore customs, and that he \nwould contact  the Accused again.  \nAs instructed  by Ganesan, the Accused  arrived  at the \u201cPetron\u201d petrol  \nstation, and less than five minutes  later,  a silver coloured \u201cPerdana\u201d  car \narrived. An Indian man in the passenger seat passed some  plastic bags \nto the Indian driver. The Accused walked  over to the car, and the driver \npassed the plastic bags to him. They  did not talk. The Accused returned \nto the Lorry, and placed the plastic bags in the Lorry. He realised that \nthere were three plastic  bags, and that they were quite heavy. He did not \nlook inside. He could  \u201croughly  see and feel the shape  of the drugs inside \nthe plastic bags\u201d. He did not tell Ananthan about  the plastic bags, and \nAnanthan did not know anything about the drugs. \nThereafter, they were  arrested  at Singapore  customs. The Accused did \nnot know who the drugs were meant for. Ganesan was supposed to call \nhim again after he had reached  Sungei Kadut. He was not paid the \nRM$10,000 as Ganesan  had promised.\n(d) In the fourth  long statement  recorded on 20 May 2016, the \nAccused explained that he decided to tell the truth about the drugs  \nbecause he did not wish to get Anathan  into trouble. Anathan  was not \ninvolved in the matter. He said that he did not know  where Ganesan  \nstayed, and agreed to deliver  the drugs for Ganesan  because  of the sum \nof money offered by Ganesan. \n9\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Siva Raman [2018]  SGHC  10\n(e) Finally, in the sixth long statement recorded  on 12 July 2016, the \nAccused confirmed that he knew that Ganesan wanted him to deliver \ndrugs. However, he maintained that he did not know what  type of drugs  \nthey were.  \nTamil terms for drugs  \n14 As mentioned at [11] above,  there  was some dispute by the Accused \nover the interpretation  of the word \u201cdrugs\u201d to him during the recording  of the \nstatements, and his understanding of the Tamil terms used by the interpreters. \nAccording to both Mr Raman and Mdm Malliga, the two Tamil terms \u201cbothai \nporul\u201d and \u201cbothai  marunthu\u201d are commonly used to mean  drugs.  Both also \ntestified that literally, \u201cbothai \u201d means intoxicating, and \u201cmarunthu \u201d means \nmedicine. Put together, however, \u201cbothai marunthu\u201d is commonly understood  \nand used to refer to controlled drugs. \nThe Defence  \n15 At the close of the Prosecution\u2019s case, I found that there  was sufficient \nevidence against the Accused for the defence to be called. In giving evidence, \nthe Accused gave an account that was largely consistent with what  he stated  in \nthe long statements. Specifically, he related how Ganesan came to rent the Lorry \nfrom him to transport  \u201cjaman \u201d (which  means \u201cthing\u201d), and paid him RM$1,400 \nfor each trip. Then, he was told by Prakash that Ganesan \u201cwas bringing bothai \nmarunthu\u201d in the Lorry. Upon learning of this, the Accused became  angry.  He \nconfronted Ganesan. He  fought with Ganesan to get back the Lorry.\n16 Despite cheating  him, Ganesan  called  him to ask him for help with \nmedicine. The Accused did not know it would get him into such big trouble.  \nExplaining further, the Accused said that on 12 May 2016, Ganesan called  him, \n10\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Siva Raman [2018]  SGHC  10\nand asked  him to transport \u201cbothai marunthu\u201d, and that he would give him \nRM$10,000. Ganesan called him again on the subsequent days. Eventually, the \nAccused agreed to the  arrangement, and he  brought the  items into Singapore. \n17 In cross-examination, the Accused explained that to him, \u201cbothai \nmarunthu\u201d is a \u201chead-shaking\u201d medicine used in pubs. When  consumed, it \nwould make heads shake. However, he said it was not illegal in nature. To the \nAccused, \u201cbothai porul \u201d would  refer to illegal drugs.  Referring to the long \nstatements, he accepted that to refer to drugs, Mdm Malliga used both terms \u2013 \n\u201cbothai porul\u201d and \u201cbothai marunthu\u201d \u2013 when interpreting the long statements  \nto him. In relation to the first long statement, while he agreed that he mentioned  \n\u201cice\u201d, he denied  mentioning \u201cganja\u201d or \u201cheroin\u201d.  Those terms were used by \nMdm Malliga. Nonetheless, he admitted  to reading about \u201cganja\u201d and \u201cheroin\u201d \nin the newspapers, and that he knew that these were illegal things. Eventually, \nthe Accused conceded that he knew he was being asked to deliver  something \nillegal, but that  he did not know it would lead to such serious consequences.  \nThe law  \n18 The applicable law was not in dispute. The relevant provision within the \nMDA constituting the charges reads: \nImport and export of controlled drugs\n7. Except as authorised  by this Act, it shall be an offence for a \nperson to import into or export  from Singapore a controlled  \ndrug.\nWhile \u201cimport\u201d is not defined in the MDA, it is defined in s 2(1) of the \nInterpretation Act (Cap  1, 2002 Rev Ed) to mean  \u201cto bring or cause to be brought  \ninto Singapore by land,  sea or air\u201d, and I adopted  the meaning  accordingly. \n11\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Siva Raman [2018]  SGHC  10\n19 As for the mens rea of the charges,  being  that of knowledge  of the nature \nof the drugs, s 18(2)  of the MDA provides: \nPresumption of possession  and knowledge of controlled  \ndrugs\n18. ...\n(2) Any person who is proved or presumed  to have had a \ncontrolled drug in his possession shall,  until the contrary is \nproved, be presumed to have known the nature of that drug.\nIf the prosecution  is able to invoke  the presumption of knowledge,  an accused \nmust prove,  on a balance of probabilities,  that he did not have knowledge of the \nnature of the drug:  Obeng  Comfort v Public  Prosecutor [2017] 1 SLR 633 at \n[37]. \nDecision   \n20 The Accused admitted  that pursuant  to an arrangement with Ganesan, \nhe had brought the nine packets of drugs which were in the Lorry  into \nSingapore, being the actus reus of the charges. Further, the Accused  did not \ndispute that at the material time, he was in possession  of the nine packets of \ndrugs which were in the Lorry, and was supposed to deliver  them  upon receiving \nfurther instructions from  Ganesan. Thus, the Prosecution was able to invoke the \npresumption of knowledge  of the nature of the drugs contained in s 18(2) of the \nMDA against the Accused. The burden was for the Accused  to rebut the \npresumption that he knew that the drugs were diamorphine  and \nmethamphetamine respectively. This formed the sole issue in  the case. \n21 The Prosecution submitted that the Accused  had failed  to rebut  the \npresumption, while Defence Counsel argued the contrary. To reiterate, at trial, \nthe Accused\u2019s claim was that he thought he was delivering \u201cbothai marunthu \u201d \nwhich was a form  of \u201chead-shaking\u201d medicine  used in pubs. Upon a review  of \n12\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Siva Raman [2018]  SGHC  10\nthe whole of the evidence,  I found that the Accused had not rebutted  the \npresumption of knowledge on a balance of probabilities. These are my reasons. \n22 To begin with, the Accused\u2019s claim  that by \u201cbothai marunthu \u201d, he \nthought Ganesan meant  a form of legal  \u201chead-shaking\u201d medicine  used in pubs \nwas unbelievable. This assertion,  in my view, was an afterthought. If indeed this \nwas what the Accused believed, it was incredible  that he did not mention this in \nany of the ten investigation statements. In particular, from the third  long \nstatement onwards, the Accused gave a detailed  account of the events  leading \nto the transactions, and described his state of mind at various points  in time. Yet, \nthere was no mention of this belief.  More  critically,  even in his examination-in-\nchief, he did not make this claim of what he thought \u201cbothai marunthu\u201d  was. It \nwas only during cross-examination  that the Accused explained he believed  \n\u201cbothai marunthu\u201d  was a \u201chead-shaking\u201d medicine  used in pubs.  \n23 Further,  this assertion was inconsistent with the contents of the long \nstatements. In the first and third long statements,  the Accused mentioned three \nspecific controlled drugs \u2013 being \u201cice\u201d,  \u201cganja\u201d and \u201cheroin\u201d. Then,  in the third \nand sixth long statements, the Accused admitted that he knew that he was being \nasked to deliver  drugs by Ganesan. Instead of stating that he thought the drugs \nwas a \u201chead-shaking\u201d medicine (which was legal  in nature), he specifically \nstated that he did not know what  type of drugs he was being asked to deliver. It \nwas evident  that the Accused had shifted  his position on a material aspect of his \ndefence.  \n24 At this juncture,  I digress  to deal with the Accused\u2019s contention  that in \nthe course of the recording of the statements, somehow,  the term \u201cdrugs\u201d was \nnot properly interpreted to him in Tamil,  and\/or that he did not properly \n13\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Siva Raman [2018]  SGHC  10\nunderstand the Tamil terms used.  Specifically, the Accused knew  that \u201cbothai \nporul\u201d and \u201cbothai marunthu\u201d  were both terms which referred to drugs, and \nthat Mdm Malliga had used both terms. However, he thought that the former \nreferred to illegal drugs, but not the latter (see [17] above). Also,  in the first long \nstatement, the Accused claimed that \u201cganja\u201d and \u201cheroin\u201d were words used by \nMdm Malliga. \n25 In this regard,  Mdm Malliga explained  that although she could  not recall \nthe exact words in Tamil  that the Accused  used for her to interpret into \u201cdrugs\u201d \nin English, the common terms for drugs would be either  \u201cbothai porul\u201d  or \n\u201cbothai marunthu\u201d. When she read back the long statements to the Accused, \nshe would interpret \u201cdrugs\u201d as \u201cbothai porul\u201d or \u201cbothai marunthu\u201d. The \nAccused did not say that he did not understand  her. More importantly,  if the \nAccused had merely used the word \u201cmarunthu\u201d, Mdm Malliga would have \ninterpreted it as \u201cmedicine\u201d. As for the references  to \u201cice\u201d, \u201cganja\u201d and \n\u201cheroin\u201d, again, Mdm Malliga could not recall what  the Accused said. However,  \nwhen she read back the first long statement,  she thought she used the same \nwords as recorded, that being \u201cice\u201d, \u201cganja\u201d  and \u201cheroin\u201d. The Accused did not \nsay that  he did not understand the words.\n26  I accepted that the statements  were accurately recorded,  with the \nAccused properly understanding the Tamil terms  \u2013 be it \u201cbothai porul\u201d or \n\u201cbothai marunthu\u201d  \u2013 to refer to controlled or illegal  drugs, and not merely  to \nmedicine. In particular, I found that the contents of the long statements were \naccurate. In this regard, I accepted the clear evidence  of Mdm Malliga. The long \nstatements were replete with references to drugs. After the recording of each of \nthe long statements, it was read back  to the Accused. As the Accused admitted,  \nMdm Malliga used both Tamil terms. The Accused did not express any \nconfusion over the contents of the long statements,  and did not raise any concern \n14\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Siva Raman [2018]  SGHC  10\nabout any difference between the two terms to Mdm Malliga. In fact, in the first \nlong statement, when  using the term \u201cbothai marunthu\u201d, he confirmed  that it \nmeant drugs (see [13(a)]  above).  In my view, his attempt to draw the tenuous  \ndistinction between \u201cbothai porul\u201d and \u201cbothai  marunthu\u201d was merely meant  \nto support his belated  claim that he thought the \u201chead-shaking\u201d medicine  was \nlegal in nature.  \n27 Although the Accused denied  mentioning \u201cganja\u201d and \u201cheroin\u201d in the \nfirst long statement, he provided a description of these drugs  in the third long \nstatement. In fact, at trial, the Accused  did not deny knowing \u201cice\u201d, \u201cganja\u201d and \n\u201cheroin\u201d to be illegal drugs. I did not believe his claim that Mdm Malliga \nmentioned the drugs  \u201cganja\u201d  and \u201cheroin\u201d. Again, the fact that the Accused \nnamed the three specific illegal drugs showed  that the Accused  did not have any \nproblems with understanding  the term \u201cdrugs\u201d during  the recording process.   \n28 Furthermore,  the assertion that he thought the drugs were a form  of \n\u201chead-shaking\u201d medicine  which was not illegal  in nature was inconsistent with \nhis conduct. When  the Accused was told by Prakash that Ganesan had used the \nLorry to transport bothai marunthu,  the Accused, by his own account,  became  \nvery angry.  He confronted Ganesan,  and even  fought with him. He accused \nGanesan of cheating  him. The Accused\u2019s reaction showed that he knew  that \n\u201cbothai marunthu\u201d (which he was being asked to deliver on 16 May 2016) \nconsisted of illegal drugs, and not merely substances  which were  legal in nature. \nMoreover, when the Accused was asked  by Ganesan to collect and deliver  the \ndrugs, the Accused did not immediately agree. He was worried about  the \nconsequences of doing so. Again, this indicated  that he knew of the serious and \nillegal nature of the drugs. For these main reasons,  I rejected  the assertion  that \nhe thought  the nine packets contained \u201chead shaking\u201d medicine  used in pubs  \nwhich were legal in nature.   \n15\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Siva Raman [2018]  SGHC  10\n29 Moreover,  the Accused had received  the nine packets of drugs in very \nsuspicious circumstances,  but failed to take any steps to establish the nature of \nthe contents. Apart from  the circumstances  discussed at [28] above, there was \nno reason for the Accused to trust Ganesan. After  all, Ganesan had not been \nupfront with the Accused when he rented the Lorry.  The Accused even  admitted \nthat he had no reason to trust Ganesan.  Yet, he did not ask Ganesan about the \nitems to be delivered. The furtive circumstances  in which he received the drugs  \nfrom two men without any conversation  around 2am in the morning (see [13(c)] \nabove) would  also have been telltale signs  that his task was illicit  in nature.\n30 Also, the Accused knew that he was being promised a substantial sum \nof RM$10,000 to collect  the items, and to deliver  the items in Singapore. Since \nthe Accused  was supposed  to deliver a consignment of empty  paint tins and \nspare parts to Singapore, there was little extra work involved. I appreciated  that \nthe Accused was not in financial difficulties. However, as the Accused admitted  \nin the fourth  long statement (see [13(d) ]), the quantum promised was attractive \nenough for the Accused to agree  to carry  out the task. The Accused was not a \nna\u00efve person,  and appeared to be financially  savvy. As such, the substantial \npayment promised to him would have  indicated to the Accused the illegal nature \nof the items.    \n31 Indeed,  eventually in the course of cross-examination, the Accused \nadmitted that he knew he was being asked to deliver  something illegal. With his \nknowledge of all the surrounding circumstances,  the Accused  did not check on \nthe nine packets of drugs. He had every opportunity to do so after he collected \nthe nine packets of drugs in Johor Bahru.  With the Accused\u2019s  knowledge of the \ndifferent types of illegal  drugs, including  \u201cice\u201d,  \u201cganja\u201d and \u201cheroin\u201d, such a \ncheck would not have  been futile.  \n16\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Siva Raman [2018]  SGHC  10\n32 Accordingly,  I rejected the Accused\u2019s  contention that he thought the \ndrugs were merely a \u201chead-shaking\u201d medicine which  was not illegal,  and found \nthat he had failed to rebut the presumption that he knew of the nature  of the \ndrugs. For completeness,  I should add that given all the facts and circumstances, \nhis bare claim that he did not know what type of drugs he was being asked to \ndeliver (which was his position  in the long statements) also did not suffice  to \nrebut the presumption of knowledge. I found  that the Prosecution  had proved \nboth the charges against the Accused, and convicted him  of both the charges.  \nSentence  \n33 By s 33(1) of the MDA, read with its Second Schedule, the punishment  \nprescribed for importing more than 15 grams of diamorphine or 250 grams of \nmethamphetamine under s 7(1) is the death penalty. However, pursuant to \ns 33B, the court has the discretion  not to impose the death penalty. Under \ns 33B(1)( a), the court  may order  life imprisonment  and caning of at least 15 \nstrokes if two requirements within s 33B(2) are satisfied. First, the person \nconvicted must prove, on a balance  of probabilities, that his involvement in the \noffence under s 7(1) is restricted to that of a mere courier, as set out in \ns 33B(2)( a)(i)\u2013(iv). Second, the Public Prosecutor  must certify  that the person  \nconvicted has substantively assisted the CNB in disrupting  drug trafficking \nactivities within or outside Singapore. \n34 On the first requirement, the Court of"}
{"casename":"2018_SGHC_100","fact":"facts. First, the defendant had told the plaintiff\u2019s  \nemployee, Ms Gao,  that he was resident  in Fujian. Second, the plaintiff  had \ncommissioned a search  on the defendant in Hong Kong which revealed that he \nwas born in Fujian and had four listed addresses; the three Hong  Kong addresses \nand the Fujian address. Third, the 26 October 2016 letter was sent to the three \nHong Kong addresses and the Fujian address.\n8 I do not accept this argument.  Under O 11 r 2(1)(c) of the Rules of Court  \n(Cap 332, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) the plaintiff was required, in applying  for leave  \nfor service out of jurisdiction, to state what  place or country the defendant  is, or \nprobably may be found. The defendant  is a Hong Kong citizen who, in his credit \nagreement with the plaintiff, listed a Hong Kong address.  The searches \nconducted on the defendant showed Hong Kong addresses. The 26 October \n2016 letter was replied to by Hong Kong solicitors engaged by the defendant. \nIn these circumstances, the plaintiff was clearly entitled to state that the \ndefendant is, or probably  may be found, in Hong Kong. I do not see how it could \nhave been material that another address, in Fujian, was connected to the \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nResorts World at Sentosa Pte Ltd v Sze Siu Hung [2018]  SGHC  100\n4defendant, especially when that address  was not a residential address, but an \noffice address. I am also of the opinion that the defendant was trying to evade \nservice and now, the consequences  of his failure to respond earlier.\n9 Mr Chan\u2019s  next submission concerns the order for substituted  service. \nMr Chan  argues  that the order should be set aside for three reasons. First, the \nplaintiff did not make reasonable efforts  to locate the defendant\u2019s residential \naddress. Second, the plaintiff has not shown that the two modes of substituted  \nservice would bring  the cause papers  to the defendant\u2019s notice. Third,  the \nplaintiff did not make full and frank disclosure  that it knew or had reason to \nbelieve that the defendant\u2019s place  of residence was in Fujian.\n10 Mr Chan\u2019s third reason is the same  as his argument in respect of the \norder for service out of jurisdiction, and is rejected  for the same reasons. As for \nthe other  two reasons, I find that they are little more than afterthoughts dangled  \nabout to distract from  the cause of these proceedings  \u2014 the defendant\u2019s  evasion \nof service. What  is clear is that the defendant  knew  of the proceedings at the \nlatest by 15 December  2016. According to the defendant, the 26 October  2016 \nletter was forwarded to him by the staff at the Fujian  address.  He then sought \nlegal advice from MLC, who issued the letters  dated 2 and 10 November  2016. \nOn 12 December 2016, WMCY informed MLC of the proceedings and asked  if \nthey had instructions  to accept service. MLC asked  the defendant, who,  despite  \nknowledge of the proceedings, replied  that he \u201cdid not wish  to give instructions  \nfor it to accept service  on [his] behalf.\u201d  The defendant cannot now claim that he \nhad no notice of the proceedings, or that the plaintiff did not make reasonable \nefforts to bring the cause papers to his notice.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nResorts World at Sentosa Pte Ltd v Sze Siu Hung [2018]  SGHC  100\n511 This brings us to Mr Chan\u2019s last submission.  He submits that the default \njudgment should be set aside as there  is a prima facie defence. The defendant \nclaims he has made full repayment of the $15m to Ms Gao, who,  according  to \nthe defendant\u2019s friend, Mr Shi,  admitted  to misappropriating the monies. These  \npayments are said to have been made through intermediaries as a result of \nChina\u2019s exchange  control  regulations. In support of this argument,  Mr Chan  is \nseeking leave  to adduce fresh evidence  showing the defendant\u2019s transfer  of a \ntotal of $15m to various intermediaries. In the alternative, Mr Chan submits that \nthe credit agreement  is void as a result of a unilateral mistake on the part of the \ndefendant, who, after some alleged  discussions between him, Mr Shi, and \nMs Gao, thought he  would  only be  liable  for up to 70% of the debt incurred.  \n12 I reject Mr Chan\u2019s application  and his arguments. First, as Mr Shankar, \ncounsel for the plaintiff pointed out, the allegations of repayment and unilateral \nmistake only came out in the proceedings in Singapore. These defences were \nnot mentioned at all when the defendant applied  for the registration of the \ndefault judgment  to be set aside  in Hong Kong.

I will refer to Jaguar Energy and AEI Guatemala collectively as \u201cJaguar\u201d. At the material time, Jaguar was managed and controlled by AEI Services LLC (\u201cAEI\u201d), a company based in Houston.', '4\\u2003The dispute between the parties arose from a project (\u201cthe Project\u201d) for the engineering, procurement, equipment and construction of a coal-fired power generation plant located near Puerto Quetzal, Guatemala (\u201cthe Plant\u201d).', '5\\u2003In October 2007, Distribuidora de Electricidad de Occidente, SA and Distribuidora de Electricidad de Oriente, SA (\u201cthe Offtakers\u201d), two Guatemala-based companies in the business of supplying electricity in Guatemala, issued bid documents for the Project. In preparing its bid, AEI began negotiations with CMNC. AEI and CMNC entered into a memorandum of understanding which envisioned the conclusion of an Engineering, Procurement and Construction Contract (\u201cthe EPC Contract\u201d) and the formation of a special purpose vehicle by AEI (\u201cthe SPV\u201d). It was contemplated that the SPV would own the Plant and enter into the EPC Contract with CMNC for the Project and power purchase agreements with the Offtakers (\u201cthe PPAs\u201d) for the sale of the power generated by the Plant. On 22 February 2008, Jaguar Energy was formed as the SPV for the Project.', '6\\u2003On 29 March 2008, CMNC and Jaguar Energy executed the EPC Contract. Under this contract, CMNC agreed to construct the Plant for Jaguar Energy, as the owner, for the approximate sum of US$450m, which was to be paid progressively to CMNC in milestone payments.', '7\\u2003The EPC Contract provided for disputes arising out of the contract to be resolved by arbitration in Singapore, under the 1998 Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (\u201cthe ICC\u201d and \u201cthe 1998 ICC Rules\u201d). Critically, the EPC Contract provided for an expedited arbitration. Clause 20.2 of the EPC Contract stated as follows:', 'In other words, the arbitration agreement required the award to be issued 90 days after the selection of the third arbitrator; or if the majority of the arbitrators agreed, within a further 90 days.', '8\\u2003Clause 20.2 of the EPC Contract also identified New York law as the governing law of the contract.', '9\\u2003On 30 May 2008, Jaguar Energy entered into the PPAs with the Offtakers. The PPAs provided for the Plant to start commercial operations by 1 May 2012, failing which the Offtakers were entitled to impose liquidated damages for delay.', '10\\u2003On 13 November 2009, CMNC, Jaguar Energy and AEI Guatemala executed a deferred payment security agreement (\u201cthe DPSA\u201d). At the time of the EPC Contract, the parties had anticipated that Jaguar would obtain external financing for the Project from a consortium of banks. When it became clear that this was no longer possible, the parties agreed on vendor financing. To this end, the DPSA provided Jaguar Energy with the option of issuing debit notes (\u201cthe Notes\u201d) to CMNC instead of making certain milestone payments under the EPC Contract. This enabled Jaguar Energy to defer certain cash payments due under the EPC Contract. The Notes were to be secured by security interests over assets of Jaguar (\u201cthe Security Interests\u201d). In substance, in the event Jaguar Energy exercised the option, CMNC would provide financing for the Project by deferring collection of its milestone payments on the terms of the DPSA. The governing law of the DPSA was also New York law; and the DPSA provided for disputes arising thereunder to be resolved by the same dispute resolution mechanism under the EPC Contract, that is, arbitration in Singapore under the 1998 ICC Rules.', '11\\u2003Section 3 of the DPSA provided that the EPC Contract was one of the Security Interests.

In these notices, Jaguar Energy stated that CMNC was in material breach of its obligations under the EPC Contract for being in delay of the works. Jaguar Energy required CMNC to take corrective measures to remedy specified items by 29 October and 1 November 2013 respectively, and reserved its right to terminate the EPC Contract for CMNC\u2019s default.', '19\\u2003On 30 October 2013, Jaguar Energy issued a notice to CMNC stating that CMNC had failed to take the corrective measures specified by Jaguar Energy in its notice dated 11 October 2013, and that it intended to undertake those corrective steps itself, deducting the cost of doing so from sums due to CMNC.

CMNC claims that after 11 December 2013, it no longer had access to its office in the Construction Area which contained documents related to the construction of the Plant. Notably, the Living Quarters were not subject to these strictures: CMNC\u2019s employees continued to have access to the Living Quarters which they only left on 20 June 2014 (see [32]\u2013[33] below). Therefore, CMNC retained access to project documents saved in laptops and computers which were kept in the Living Quarters until 20 June 2014 (see [33] below).', '27\\u2003On 14 December 2013, Jaguar Energy sent a letter to CMNC purporting to terminate the EPC Contract from that date for CMNC\u2019s default under that contract, and stating that the DPSA was also terminated from that date pursuant to its provisions. The Tribunal found that Jaguar Energy validly terminated the EPC Contract on 14 December 2013 by this letter, and that the DPSA was thereby also automatically terminated by operation of its express terms.', '28\\u2003On or about 14 December 2013, Jaguar terminated CMNC\u2019s access to Project Solve (see [14] above).', '29\\u2003The tension between the parties escalated sharply shortly after Jaguar Energy terminated the EPC Contract and CMNC\u2019s access to Project Solve. On 15 December 2013, a violent confrontation between Jaguar Energy\u2019s guards and CMNC\u2019s employees occurred. The reasons for the confrontation are not entirely clear. During the confrontation, Jaguar Energy\u2019s guards shot CMNC\u2019s employees with plastic pellets, sprayed them with pepper spray and beat them with wooden sticks.', '30\\u2003On 2 January 2014, as further evidence of the growing discord between the parties, CMNC\u2019s subsidiary, CMNC Jaguar Guatemala, SA, issued a letter to contractors on the Site which stated as follows:', '31\\u2003According to CMNC, from 19 to 24 January 2014, Jaguar harassed and intimidated its potential witnesses in the arbitration (\u201cthe Arbitration\u201d). Notably, these alleged incidents all occurred before Jaguar filed its request for arbitration dated 28 January 2014 (see [35] below). They took the form, among other things, of preventing certain CMNC employees who had left the Site to give evidence regarding the incident on 15 December 2013 to Guatemalan officials from returning to the Living Quarters, offering some CMNC employees money to leave the Site, and installing cameras at the Living Quarters to monitor the movements of CMNC\u2019s employees present there.', '32\\u2003CMNC\u2019s staff continued to reside in the Living Quarters until 20 June 2014. By this time, the parties were fairly deep into the arbitration proceedings (see [35] below). On that day, a hearing, presided over by a Guatemala magistrate, was held at the Site pursuant to a petition for habeas corpus by Jaguar in respect of CMNC\u2019s employees. Jaguar asserts that it filed the petition in response to a \u201cpublic notice\u201d published in the local media, which Jaguar claims CMNC paid for, containing allegations that CMNC workers were being held at the Site against their will and mistreated. On the other hand, CMNC alleges that Jaguar filed the petition to interfere with CMNC\u2019s preparation of its Statement of Case and witness statements, which were due to be filed in the Arbitration on 30 July 2014 (see [44] below). CMNC also contends that Jaguar used bribes to procure the eviction of its employees from the Living Quarters.', '33\\u2003The habeas corpus hearing concluded on 20 June 2014 with an order made by the magistrate directing that CMNC\u2019s employees be sent to an immigration shelter. According to CMNC, Jaguar then seized two desktop computers and hard drives containing documents concerning the Project from the Living Quarters. It is not clear whether the items seized were returned. CMNC\u2019s employees were released from the shelter on 28 July 2014.', '34\\u2003Jaguar appointed new contractors to carry out the remaining works to complete the Project. The remaining works were carried out while the arbitration proceedings were ongoing and were completed on 26 July 2015 shortly after the conclusion of the main evidentiary hearing in Dublin on 6\u201321 July 2015 (\u201cthe Main Hearing\u201d).', '35\\u2003By a request for arbitration dated 28 January 2014, Jaguar commenced the Arbitration. Apart from multiple teleconferences, hearings were convened in London on 30 April and 1 May 2014 (\u201cthe London Hearing\u201d), in Singapore on 16 and 17 June 2014, in Toronto on 6 and 7 November 2014 (\u201cthe Toronto Hearing\u201d), in Hong Kong on 16\u201318 March 2015 (\u201cthe Hong Kong Hearing\u201d) and the Main Hearing on 6\u201321 July 2015. As noted below (see [39] and [43]), the time period in cl 20.2 of the EPC Contract was extended by the parties by mutual consent.', '36\\u2003In gist, Jaguar\u2019s case in the Arbitration was that CMNC had breached the EPC Contract; Jaguar had validly terminated the EPC Contract on account of those breaches; and Jaguar was entitled to, amongst other reliefs, liquidated damages for delay and the costs of completing the Project. I shall refer to Jaguar\u2019s claim for the costs of completion as \u201cthe ETC Claim\u201d.', '37\\u2003CMNC\u2019s case was that Jaguar was not entitled to liquidated damages for delay because CMNC was entitled to extensions of time. CMNC also averred that it took over Jaguar Energy\u2019s rights under the EPC Contract in November 2013 by exercising the Step-In Rights through the issuance of the Take Over Notice (see [22] above); and Jaguar Energy was therefore not entitled to terminate the EPC Contract in December 2013. CMNC also made certain miscellaneous counterclaims.', '38\\u2003The fulcrum of CMNC\u2019s case in this application is its claim that the Arbitration was marred by \u201cprocedural dysfunction\u201d, principally centred on the imposition of an AEO order by the Tribunal. Hence, it is critical to examine the procedural history of the Arbitration. I now set out the key events in the Arbitration.', '39\\u2003As I have noted, Jaguar commenced the Arbitration on 28 January 2014 (see [35] above). On or around 27 March 2014, the chairman of the Tribunal (\u201cthe Chairman\u201d), its third and final member, was appointed. The 90-day time period under cl 20.2 of the EPC Contract for the Tribunal to issue its award (see [7] above) therefore began on 27 March 2014, and would have expired by 25 June 2014 or, if further extended by the maximum 90 days permitted under cl 20.2, 23 September 2014. However, the parties agreed to amend this requirement (see [43] below).', '40\\u2003On 1 May 2014, the second day of the London Hearing, the parties agreed to a timetable for the Arbitration. This was set out in Procedural Order No 2 which the Tribunal issued under cover of Tribunal Communication (\u201cTC\u201d) No 14 dated 7 May 2014. Procedural Order No 2 provided for the Main Hearing to be between 26 January and 6 February 2015. By that time, the stipulated deadline in cl 20.2 of the EPC Contract for issuance of the Award would have passed (see [39] above).', '41\\u2003Notwithstanding that the parties had agreed on 1 May 2014 to a procedural timetable, by Respondent\u2019s Communication (\u201cRC\u201d) No 9 dated 6 May 2014, counsel for CMNC informed the Tribunal that after taking instructions, CMNC was applying for a variation to it. It is important to note the reason cited by CMNC for its change of position. Relying on the fact that the parties had agreed to an expedited arbitration, CMNC sought for, in particular, the Main Hearing to be brought forward from between 26 January and 6 February 2015 to between 8 and 16 October 2014. CMNC wanted the procedural timelines further compressed. CMNC stated as follows:', '42\\u2003By Claimants\u2019 Communication (\u201cCC\u201d) No 11 dated 6 May 2014, Jaguar opposed CMNC\u2019s request in RC No 9 on the basis that it was not realistic.', '43\\u2003By TC No 19 dated 14 May 2014, the Tribunal ruled that it would not accede to CMNC\u2019s request for the procedural timetable to be further compressed. The Tribunal\u2019s reasoning is illuminating. The pertinent passages are as follows:', 'It is evident that while the Tribunal was aware of the need for expedition, it was equally conscious of the need to ensure due process given the complexity and scale of the dispute. The Tribunal therefore carefully weighed these considerations when calibrating the procedural timelines for the Arbitration.', '44\\u2003By RC No 27 dated 28 July 2014, CMNC sought an extension of time of one month to file its Statement of Case (in relation to its counterclaims) and supporting evidence. CMNC cited two reasons for its application: the need to translate documents between Chinese and English, and deprivation of access to technical staff who had been allegedly held in unlawful detention in Guatemala (see [33] above).', '45\\u2003By CC No 27 dated 28 July 2014, Jaguar objected to CMNC\u2019s request in RC No 27, adding that it was only agreeable to an extension of time of one week if any were permitted. Jaguar also stated that CMNC\u2019s reliance on its alleged deprivation of access to its employees as a reason for the extension could not have been raised in good faith as it was of its own making for two reasons. First, CMNC had refused to release its employees\u2019 passports to allow their repatriation. Second, CMNC had sued several of its employees in Guatemala for breach of their employment contracts in attempting to return to China, and had obtained a court order restraining the employees from leaving Guatemala.', '46\\u2003By RC No 28 dated 28 July 2014, CMNC acknowledged that it had sued its staff in Guatemala. It claimed that this had been \u201con advice of local counsel, as a drastic measure to safeguard their presence in Guatemala against the unlawful efforts of certain people to detain and deport them\u201d.', '47\\u2003By TC No 38 dated 31 July 2014, having considered RC No 27 and CC No 27, the Tribunal granted the parties an extension of two weeks (until 13 August 2014) to file their Statement of Case. It should be noted that CMNC\u2019s employees had been released on 28 July 2014 (see [33] above). The extension of time for the filing of the Statement of Case accommodated CMNC\u2019s request for more time.', '48\\u2003Procedural Order No 2 provided for the parties\u2019 Statements of Case to be accompanied by \u201ccopies of all documents which the Party concerned relies on and considers essential \u2026 and which have not previously been submitted by any Party\u201d.', '49\\u2003On 13 August 2014, CMNC and Jaguar filed their respective Statements of Case in the Arbitration. In paragraph 16 of its Statement of Case, Jaguar stated that apart from redacting certain documents and not including witnesses\u2019 full addresses, it was withholding production of 13 documentary exhibits (\u201cthe 13 Exhibits\u201d), for the following reasons:', 'Jaguar also stated the following in a footnote in its Statement of Case:', '50\\u2003Jaguar thus indicated that it was only willing to disclose unredacted copies of witness statements and the 13 Exhibits to CMNC on an AEO basis. The 13 Exhibits comprised post-termination contracts for re-procurement and completion-related services and post-termination schedules and reports. CMNC claims that these documents were necessary to evaluate the ETC Claim. The 13 Exhibits also included a proposal that was submitted to the Offtakers in 2008, which Jaguar claimed included sensitive details on AEI\u2019s corporate structure.', '51\\u2003On 20 August 2014, the parties filed their respective requests to produce documents. CMNC requested Jaguar to produce 87 categories of documents.', '52\\u2003On 2 September 2014, counsel for CMNC informed counsel for Jaguar that CMNC was unlikely to agree to an AEO disclosure order. Thereafter, on 8 September 2014, CMNC demanded immediate production of the 13 Exhibits. Further correspondence was exchanged between the parties but they could not ultimately come to an agreement on the disclosure of the 13 Exhibits.', '53\\u2003By CC No 45 dated 22 September 2014, Jaguar invited the Tribunal to issue an order allowing the parties to produce documents containing sensitive information on an AEO basis, subject to the receiving party\u2019s right to challenge such disclosure. Jaguar submitted that an AEO order should apply to three categories of documents: post-termination contracts, project schedules and reports; AEI high-level corporate information; and documents submitted in 2007 and 2008 to the Offtakers. The 13 Exhibits fell within these three categories as did certain documents falling within the 87 categories of documents requested by CMNC (see [51] above).', '54\\u2003Jaguar claimed that an AEO order was justified based on uncontroverted evidence, contained in witness statements supporting its Statement of Case, that before and after the termination of the EPC Contract, CMNC \u201c[had] gone to extraordinary lengths to interfere with Jaguar\u2019s completion of the Project\u201d [emphasis added]. Jaguar\u2019s witnesses appear to have stated that CMNC had, amongst other things, offered money to contractors and suppliers in exchange for not working with Jaguar, and had physically intimidated Jaguar\u2019s contractors, suppliers and employees.', '55\\u2003By RC No 36 dated 23 September 2014, CMNC requested the Tribunal to reject Jaguar\u2019s request to produce documents subject to an AEO order for four reasons. First, an AEO order would be procedurally unfair. Second, CMNC would not misuse information. Third, Jaguar was inviting the Tribunal to pre-judge fiercely disputed matters about CMNC\u2019s conduct. Fourth, the concept of AEO disclosure, a feature of US dispute resolution, should not be imported into international arbitration.', '56\\u2003By TC No 49 dated 25 September 2014, the Tribunal noted at [10] that three categories of documents \u2013 as identified by Jaguar in CC No 45 (see [53] above) \u2013 were in dispute. The Tribunal directed that a two-stage process would apply to the disclosure of the disputed documents (\u201cthe AEO Regime\u201d). The documents were to be disclosed as follows:', '57\\u2003Notably, the second stage of the AEO Regime expressly entitled CMNC to apply to the Tribunal for its employees to be given access to documents that Jaguar had disclosed on an AEO basis (\u201cthe AEO Designated Material\u201d) for the purpose of giving instructions to counsel. In other words, the AEO Regime contained a built-in safeguard which CMNC could resort to if its counsel needed instructions from its employees on specific documents for the purpose of conducting its case in the Arbitration. However, CMNC never applied under the second stage of the AEO Regime for its employees to be shown AEO Designated Material.', '58\\u2003The Tribunal gave the following reasons in TC No 49 for its decision to impose the AEI Regime. These reasons are again illuminating:', 'It is evident that the Tribunal was of the view that AEO orders were used in international arbitration to preserve the confidentiality of disclosed documents. It is also evident that after fully weighing the concerns and considerations of the parties, the Tribunal crafted the AEO Regime in a way that it felt struck an appropriate balance between CMNC\u2019s need for access for the purpose of making its case and Jaguar\u2019s concern that its case in the Arbitration would be prejudiced by use by CMNC of the AEO Designated Material for an ulterior and improper purpose.', '59\\u2003By RCs Nos 38 and 39 dated 26 September 2014, CMNC requested the Tribunal to reconsider its decision to allow Jaguar to disclose documents under the AEO Regime. CMNC invited the Tribunal to direct the immediate production of the 13 Exhibits.', '60\\u2003By TC No 51 dated 30 September 2014, the Tribunal affirmed its order in TC No 49. However, the Tribunal issued an important clarification. It clarified that CMNC\u2019s experts were to be regarded as external counsel for the purposes of the AEO Regime. By this, the Tribunal made clear that it was not just CMNC\u2019s external counsel but also their expert witnesses who were entitled to view AEO Designated Material. This was a significant expansion of the AEO Regime. Much of the dispute in the Arbitration centred on CMNC\u2019s entitlement to extensions of time and the quantification of the ETC Claim which made the work of expert witnesses critical. This expansion therefore facilitated the identification of those areas where instructions from specific employees of CMNC would be required. This is precisely the point made by the Tribunal in TC No 51 at [36]. I now set out the pertinent aspects of the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning in TC No 51:', '61\\u2003CMNC asserts that by its ruling in TC No 51, the Tribunal \u201cexpanded the scope of documents that could be designated as AEO \u2026 from the [13 Exhibits] to any document that Jaguar deemed to be \u2018sensitive\u2019 enough\u201d. I do not agree. TC No 49 was made pursuant to Jaguar\u2019s concerns in CC No 45 relating to the three categories of documents it identified therein (see [53] above). Reading TC No 49 in its totality, it is clear that the AEO Regime was to apply not just to the 13 Exhibits, but to documents falling within the three categories of documents identified by Jaguar in CC No 45, which, as noted earlier, included certain documents falling within the 87 categories of documents requested by CMNC (see [51] and [53] above). TC No 51 affirmed TC No 49 and clarified that experts would be regarded as external counsel. I therefore do not accept that the Tribunal expanded the scope of the AEO Regime in TC No 51.', '62\\u2003On 2 October 2014, Jaguar disclosed the 13 Exhibits on an AEO basis to CMNC\u2019s counsel.', '63\\u2003By RC No 43 dated 5 October 2014, CMNC sought to lift the AEO Regime. It requested the Tribunal to direct Jaguar to immediately produce without the AEO designation 11 of the 13 Exhibits, and the post-termination contracts and daily reports, with the contractors\u2019 names redacted. CMNC also requested the Tribunal to rule that the remaining two exhibits out of the 13 Exhibits did not contain sensitive information and were therefore not properly subject to the AEO Regime. It would appear that the 87 categories of documents as an independent request for disclosure were no longer an issue as they were not pursued by CMNC (albeit that, as I have noted, the AEO Regime applied to some documents falling within the 87 categories of documents requested by CMNC (see [61] above) and CMNC subsequently requested for the AEO Regime to be lifted in respect of certain of these documents (see [73] below)).', '64\\u2003By TC No 54 dated 6 October 2014, the Tribunal reiterated that if a party \u201cwish[ed] to make an application for a document disclosed under the [AEO Regime] to be disclosed to that Party and its employees, it may do so\u201d.', '65\\u2003By TC No 55 dated 7 October 2014, the Tribunal encouraged the parties to co-operate to find a solution to the matters which CMNC had raised in RC No 43. The Tribunal added that if this did not prove possible, it would deal with the matter on further application by the parties.', '66\\u2003By RC No 45 dated 8 October 2014, CMNC informed the Tribunal that the parties had come to an agreement regarding the production of one of the 13 Exhibits; and requested a hearing with the Tribunal by conference or video call \u201cto express its concerns regarding the use of the [AEO] designation\u201d.', '67\\u2003By CC No 56 dated 8 October 2014, Jaguar opposed CMNC\u2019s request for a hearing on the basis that the Tribunal had already reaffirmed in TC No 51 and TC No 54 its decision in TC No 49 (to impose the AEO Regime); and CMNC had not applied for any documents to be disclosed to CMNC\u2019s employees under the second stage of the AEO Regime.', '68\\u2003By TC No 57 dated 9 October 2014, the Tribunal reiterated that the parties were entitled to apply for disclosure beyond their external counsel and experts in accordance with the second stage of the AEO Regime. The Tribunal also stated that unless a party applied for disclosure of documents beyond its external counsel and experts or made another application, the Tribunal did not have before it any application which could be helpfully ventilated in a teleconference hearing.', '69\\u2003In response, by RC No 46 dated 13 October 2014, CMNC requested the Tribunal to rule that the AEO Regime did not apply to the remaining 12 exhibits (out of the 13 Exhibits) whose disclosure the parties could not agree on (\u201cthe 12 Exhibits\u201d) (see [66] above).', '70\\u2003By RC No 48 dated 15 October 2014, CMNC averred that it was \u201cnecessary to reset the timetable for expert evidence, [reply] submissions and fact witness evidence\u201d. This was a request to reset the timelines in Procedural Order No 2. CMNC stated that its preparations were insufficiently advanced; the dispute over the AEO Regime had \u201cimposed severe practical limitations on effective defence preparation\u201d. CMNC averred that it was \u201chighly doubtful that anything valuable [could] be achieved\u201d at the Toronto Hearing. This was the first attempt by CMNC to reset the procedural timetable on account of the AEO Regime.', '71\\u2003By CC No 59 dated 15 October 2014, Jaguar opposed CMNC\u2019s request in RC No 48 for the procedural timetable in Procedural Order No 2 to be reset.', '72\\u2003On 17 October 2014, the Tribunal convened a teleconference, during which the following matters were ventilated:', '(a)\\u2003CMNC stated that its experts would require two or three months more than planned to file their opinions. CMNC said that its lack of access to project records and Project Solve had impeded its preparations.', '(b)\\u2003The Tribunal indicated that the Toronto Hearing should proceed for the parties to discuss, amongst other things, case management.', '(c)\\u2003CMNC submitted that redaction of the names and identifying information of post-termination contractors would address Jaguar\u2019s concerns, and the AEO designation should therefore not apply to the 12 Exhibits. Jaguar submitted that apart from information that would reveal the identities of its contractors, information relating to the dates when upcoming construction activities were anticipated to occur should also be redacted, on the basis that such information was sensitive because CMNC had interfered with the completion of the Project. The Tribunal requested the parties to file further submissions on the issue of redaction.', '73\\u2003After the teleconference, CMNC requested that Jaguar produce further documents besides the 12 Exhibits in redacted form (\u201cthe Further Documents\u201d). These requests related to Jaguar\u2019s pre-qualification package, relevant AEI board resolutions and AEI board meeting minutes, cost estimates for the completion of the Project, project reports and\/or meeting minutes about the completion of the Project, documents relating to or relied upon in preparing the estimated completion costs and contracts with Chinese subcontractors. Jaguar addressed these requests in its submissions to the Tribunal following the teleconference. The issue before the Tribunal was therefore the continued applicability of the AEO Regime to the 12 Exhibits and the Further Documents. It should be noted that CMNC did not attempt to invoke the second stage of the AEO Regime as an alternative position.', '74\\u2003By TC No 64 dated 19 October 2014, the Tribunal ruled as follows:', '(a)\\u2003The Tribunal ruled that the redactions that CMNC had proposed \u201cadequately represent[ed] an appropriate balance of the interests of the [parties]\u201d (\u201cthe Redaction Ruling\u201d). In other words, the Tribunal ruled that the AEO Regime be lifted with respect to the 12 Exhibits and the Further Documents. Jaguar was to provide CMNC with the 12 Exhibits and the Further Documents in redacted form, and CMNC\u2019s officers, employees and staff were entitled to view these redacted documents.', '(b)\\u2003Further, the Tribunal clarified that CMNC was at liberty to seek further relief in respect of the redacted documents, and that it would entertain further applications in relation to the issue of redaction or other issues regarding the AEO Regime.', 'TC No 64 was a critical ruling and a key milestone in the procedural history of the Arbitration. By this ruling, the AEO Regime was lifted and replaced by an order providing for limited redactions of documents (albeit that Procedural Order No 3 later provided that the two-stage AEO Regime would apply to AEO Designated Material disclosed after the date of that order and of a value less than US$100,000: see [80] below). It is also critical that this ruling happened more than eight months before the Main Hearing which was rescheduled from January and February 2015 to July 2015 (see [77(b)] below). Accordingly, any prejudice that might have resulted from the imposition of the AEO Regime by TC No 49 on 25 September 2014 had been ameliorated if not removed within four weeks after its imposition (ie, between 25 September 2014 and 19 October 2014). That was not all. Effort was made thereafter, starting with the Toronto Hearing in November 2015, to reset the procedural timelines to further address CMNC\u2019s concerns.', '75\\u2003On or about 25 October 2014, pursuant to the Tribunal\u2019s ruling in TC No 64, Jaguar began to provide redacted documents to CMNC. It is undisputed that Jaguar provided \u201csister production sets\u201d of documents to CMNC. One set contained unredacted documents (for CMNC\u2019s counsel and experts). The other contained redacted documents (for CMNC\u2019s employees). The production sets contained file identifiers that identified the CMNC request number to which the produced documents corresponded, though they did not contain an index.', '76\\u2003It is also undisputed, however, that Jaguar did not provide redacted versions of every document initially. In an email dated 25 October 2014, Jaguar clarified that it had redacted information \u201cwhere practical and\/or reasonable\u201d and was not producing redacted versions of post-termination contracts and purchase orders that were \u201cof a relatively low dollar value, with some as low as a few hundred dollars\u201d. Nonetheless, Jaguar later produced redacted versions of these documents as well to CMNC on 15 November 2014.', '77\\u2003The Toronto Hearing was held on 6 and 7 November 2014 (see [35] above). The following matters transpired at the Toronto Hearing:', '(a)\\u2003It was decided that it was no longer possible to hold the Main Hearing in January and February 2015 given \u201cthe delays by [CMNC] in the preparation of its case in relation to counterclaims\u201d. In this regard, the Tribunal gave Jaguar leave to submit for wasted costs due to CMNC\u2019s delays in the preparation of its case and the consequent vacation of the dates in January and February 2015. Subsequently, by TC No 142 dated 9 March 2015, the Tribunal awarded wasted costs attributable to the vacation of the hearing in January to Jaguar.', '(b)\\u2003It was also decided that the Main Hearing would now take place in July 2015 and that a new procedural order would be created to reflect the changes in the procedural schedule for the rest of the Arbitration. This meant that the Main Hearing would take place more than a year and a half after the issuance of the request for arbitration on 28 January 2014.', '(c)\\u2003It was also agreed that a shared data room (\u201cthe Data Room\u201d) would be created to allow each party\u2019s experts to access the documents relied on by the other party\u2019s experts.', '78\\u2003The parties subsequently worked together on a draft procedural order that would set out the timetable for the rest of the Arbitration. I note that by CC No 69 dated 10 November 2014, CMNC indicated that it agreed to deadlines that were ultimately reflected in Procedural Order No 3. These included the deadlines relating to the parties\u2019 pleadings \u2013 the filing of replies and applications for leave to amend the parties\u2019 cases \u2013 and the filing of outline opinions by the parties\u2019 design, scheduling and quantum experts. This is critical as these timelines were agreed to by CMNC in the context of the Redaction Ruling. It is therefore fair to surmise that the timelines took into account any prejudice CMNC would have felt was caused by the AEO Regime.', '79\\u2003By Procedural Order No 3 dated 18 December 2014, the Tribunal set out a new procedural timetable, which the parties had agreed to, and further directions for the Arbitration. The Tribunal ordered, amongst other things, as follows:', '(a)\\u2003The parties were to progressively complete their production of documents responsive to the counterparty\u2019s requests for the same, by no later than 5 December 2014. Nonetheless, Jaguar would \u201ccontinue to supplement their production of [certain] documents \u2026 on a continuing basis (to the extent such documents exist or come into existence) due to the ongoing nature of the Project completion effort\u201d.', '(b)\\u2003Documents that had already been disclosed as AEO Designated Material would be \u201cproduced with only the contractor\u2019s name and identifying details redacted\u201d, subject to CMNC\u2019s right to apply for the documents to be produced in unredacted form.', '(c)\\u2003With regard to further contracts, purchase orders and invoices, to the extent that such documents were designated AEO: (a) Jaguar would produce a redacted version of the document if the value of the document was US$100,000 or greater; and (b) subject documents of a value less than US$100,000 to the two-stage process in the AEO Regime. However, CMNC was entitled to apply to the Tribunal for the production of any contract, purchase order or invoice of a value less than US$100,000.', '(d)\\u2003With effect from 18 December 2014, documents upon which the parties\u2019 experts relied would be added to the Data Room for sharing with their counterparts and counsel.', '80\\u2003The effect of Procedural Order No 3 was two-fold. First, it reset all the procedural timelines, in particular the dates of the Main Hearing, to take into account the concerns and considerations of the parties, in particular CMNC. It must be emphasised that the timelines were agreed to by the parties. Second, with regard to further contracts, purchase orders and invoices, there was (1) the two-stage AEO Regime for documents of a value less than US$100,000 subject to CMNC\u2019s right to apply for production and (2) a regime providing for limited redactions to be made to all documents with a value of US$100,000 or more. In other words, the AEO Regime was not imposed with regard to the documents in the second category. To this extent, Procedural Order No 3 modified the Redaction Ruling by imposing the AEO Regime for certain documents that were to be disclosed. Significantly, on CMNC\u2019s estimate, there were 143 documents each of more than US$100,000 in value, which Jaguar redacted on a limited basis, carrying a total value of US$188,790,048.92. On the other hand, there were 2,900 documents each of less than US$100,000 in value which were disclosed to CMNC\u2019s external counsel and experts in unredacted form under the AEO Regime carrying a total value of US$14,521,839.56. Thus, the redacted documents were of a much higher value than those under the AEO Regime. Furthermore, Procedural Order No 3 also empowered CMNC to apply to the Tribunal for the production of documents of less than US$100,000 in value. However, it does not appear that any such application was made. Finally, and significantly, CMNC did not, either when Procedural Order No 3 was issued or subsequently, request for the procedural timelines to be further adjusted on account of the direction that the Tribunal had made, apart from the one application referred to at [81] below.', '81\\u2003By RC No 70 dated 19 December 2014, CMNC\u2019s counsel sought an extension of time until 22 December 2014 for filing of the Statements of Reply and reply witness statements stipulated under Procedural Order No 3, on the basis that they had \u201creceived extensive relevant amendments to CMNC\u2019s witness evidence\u201d which they had been unable to process in time. Jaguar objected to CMNC\u2019s application. Nonetheless, the Tribunal granted CMNC an extension of time to submit its Statement of Reply and reply witness statements by no later than 22 December 2014.', '82\\u2003Despite its concerns over the disclosure of documents by Jaguar, CMNC delayed in agreeing on the service provider for the Data Room. By CC No 83 dated 23 December 2014, Jaguar informed the Tribunal that while it had proposed a service provider for the Data Room which Procedural Order No 3 had directed, several weeks earlier (see [79(d)] above), CMNC had not agreed to Jaguar\u2019s proposal and had failed to provide alternative recommendations. By RC No 73 dated 23 December 2014, CMNC informed the Tribunal that there was no need for the Tribunal to deal with this issue on the basis the parties would work together to resolve it. Notably, however, CMNC only executed the contract for the Data Room on around 5 February 2015, more than a month later. This delayed the uploading of documents into the Data Room (see [89] below).', '83\\u2003By RC No 78 dated 15 January 2015, CMNC informed the Tribunal and Jaguar that it was replacing its external counsel, Herbert Smith Freehills LLP and Reed Smith LLP, with new counsel. CMNC appointed Minter Ellison and Kings & Wood Mallesons (\u201cKWM\u201d) as its new counsel.', '84\\u2003By RC No 81 dated 19 January 2015, CMNC through its new counsel KWM requested extensions of time for its design experts, Uniform Commercial Code (\u201cUCC\u201d) experts and scheduling experts to file draft outline opinions. Nonetheless, KWM stated in RC No 81 that \u201cour firm and [Minter Ellison] are fully aware of the fixed procedural dates including the two hearing dates, and have accepted instructions on that basis\u201d [emphasis added].', '85\\u2003In a teleconference held on 19 January 2015, CMNC\u2019s counsel KWM reiterated that it had accepted instructions based on the hearing dates in March and July 2015. During the same teleconference, Jaguar noted that there had been a delay in setting up the Data Room attributable to CMNC. CMNC stated that it would proceed to resolve the issue regarding the Data Room.', '86\\u2003By RC No 89 dated 24 January 2015, CMNC informed the Tribunal that it had appointed a new quantum expert, Mr Charles Gurnham (\u201cMr Gurnham\u201d), \u201cbearing in mind the availability of Mr Gurnham to meet the procedures in [Procedural Order No 3]\u201d [emphasis added].', '87\\u2003By RC No 93 dated 26 January 2015, CMNC reiterated that KWM had \u201caccepted instructions on the basis that [CMNC] would be able to meet the hearing dates in March and July 2015\u201d.', '88\\u2003On 27 January 2015, the Tribunal convened another teleconference. The following matters transpired during this teleconference:', '(a)\\u2003The parties\u2019 UCC and design experts confirmed that they could meet the deadlines set out in Procedural Order No 3.', '(b)\\u2003Mr Gurnham stated that he \u201cshould have no difficulty at all in meeting the dates [in Procedural Order No 3]\u201d and that he did not foresee any issues with the procedural deadlines.', 'Therefore, as of 27 January 2015, CMNC and its expert Mr Gurnham had confirmed that they were able to meet the procedural deadlines and keep to the hearing dates that had been designated for the Main Hearing.', '89\\u2003During a teleconference on 4 February 2015, CMNC stated that it had yet to enter into the contract for the Data Room. The Chairman noted that CMNC had been \u201cgoing around the mulberry bush on this for quite some time\u201d. Subsequently, by RC No 103 dated 5 February 2015, CMNC informed the Tribunal that it had executed the contract for the Data Room. As I have noted, CMNC\u2019s delay in executing the contract for the Data Room had caused the uploading of information into the Data Room to be consequently delayed (see [82] above). This process only started on 10 February 2015.', '90\\u2003On 10 February 2015, Jaguar uploaded invoices and other material which evidenced the entries in a transaction log. The transaction log reflected the costs which Jaguar claimed it incurred to complete the Project. In other words, these costs were the basis of the ETC Claim. CMNC\u2019s case is that Jaguar disclosed the transaction logs and the supporting invoices in a delayed and disorganised matter, and that this impeded its preparation of its case.', '91\\u2003By RC No 119 dated 17 February 2015, CMNC applied to the Tribunal for the AEO Regime to be lifted. CMNC stated the following:', '(a)\\u2003CMNC noted that by TC No 51 (see [60] above), the Tribunal had permitted CMNC to apply to review the Tribunal\u2019s orders regarding the AEO Regime if the situation changed. The situation had changed: the Project was due to be completed by May 2015 and the names of the contractors were public knowledge. There was therefore no risk of impropriety by CMNC that could affect the completion of the Project.', '(b)\\u2003CMNC submitted that its lawyers and quantum experts had been prejudiced in testing Jaguar\u2019s claim for damages due to the redactions applied to AEO Designated Material. This was with reference to the documents with a value of US$100,000 or more to which Procedural Order No 3 applied. CMNC noted that some of these redactions were unauthorised because certain pages had been redacted entirely (as opposed to merely having the names of the contractors and other identifying details redacted). I would observe that this argument appears to be old wine in a new bottle being a rehash of earlier arguments.', '92\\u2003By CC No 120 dated 19 February 2015, Jaguar proposed that the parties negotiate to reach a confidentiality agreement regarding the documents that were the subject of CMNC\u2019s application in RC No 119.', '93\\u2003By TC No 133 dated 20 February 2015, the Tribunal invited the parties \u201cto exhaust the possibility of reaching an agreement\u201d on the AEO Regime. Significantly, the Tribunal further noted that CMNC had \u201cnot to date sought any relief from the Tribunal \u2026 regarding difficulties it may experience \u2026 [in] obtaining instructions regarding documents the subject of the Tribunal\u2019s orders\u201d.', '94\\u2003On 17 March 2015, the parties informed the Tribunal during the Hong Kong Hearing that they had reached an agreement regarding the disclosure of the AEO Designated Material. Subsequently, by TC No 152 dated 18 March 2015, the Tribunal issued a supplemental order to record the parties\u2019 agreement (\u201cthe Supplemental Order\u201d). The Supplemental Order stated:', '95\\u2003The Supplemental Order provided for AEO Designated Material to be disclosed in unredacted form to 28 CMNC employees listed in the Annex to the order. The Tribunal thereby lifted the AEO Regime completely. It is important to note that this was about three and a half months before the Main Hearing in early July 2015. Significantly, CMNC did not make any application at this stage to postpone the procedural timelines.', '96\\u2003By RC No 217 dated 29 May 2015, CMNC sought an extension of time for its quantum expert, Mr Gurnham, to file his responsive expert report by 10 June 2015 rather than 5 June 2015. CMNC formally applied for an extension of time in a teleconference on 1 June 2015. Notably, during this teleconference, counsel for CMNC raised the fact that the ETC Claim had not been finalised to justify CMNC\u2019s application for an extension of time. The Chairman remarked that the reason why the completion costs were changing was \u201cnot that there has been necessarily delay in preparation for the hearing by [Jaguar] but rather that the actual costs sought to be claimed are changing as the Project is completed\u201d. The Chairman also observed that Mr Gurnham was \u201ccrunched so far as [CMNC\u2019s] case is concerned, by the decision of [CMNC] regarding the way in which it was resourcing and undertaking the preparation for the case\u201d.', '97\\u2003By TC No 208 dated 2 June 2015, the Tribunal issued directions relating to the matters which the parties had disputed at the teleconference on 1 June 2015. Notably, the Tribunal recognised the complaint raised by CMNC in relation to the evolving nature of the ETC Claim by imposing a cut-off date of 5 June 2015 for Jaguar to provide particulars of and material supporting the ETC Claim. The Tribunal also extended the time for Mr Gurnham to file his responsive expert report to 18 June 2015. It should be noted that Jaguar did not object to an extension of time for Mr Gurnham to file his report by 18 June 2015. The Tribunal also made the following pertinent observations:', 'By these observations, the Tribunal reiterated the point that it had made more than a year before in TC No 19 (see [43] above). The Tribunal was required to give effect to the parties\u2019 agreement to an expedited arbitration. However, it was doing its utmost to ensure due process given this constraint.', '98\\u2003By RC No 226 dated 17 June 2015, CMNC sought another extension of time for Mr Gurnham to file his responsive expert report by 25 June 2015. The Tribunal denied this request by TC No 215 dated 18 June 2015, and Mr Gurnham subsequently filed his report out of time on 22 June 2015 (\u201cthe Gurnham Response Report\u201d). Although the Gurnham Response Report was filed out of time, the Tribunal admitted it into the evidence and considered it in the Award.', '99\\u2003Upon receiving the Gurnham Response Report, Jaguar discovered that it referred to a further report by CMNC\u2019s design expert, Mr Adam Aspinall (\u201cMr Aspinall\u201d and \u201cthe Aspinall Report\u201d). By CC No 203 dated 22 June 2015, Jaguar brought this matter to the attention of the Tribunal.', '100\\u2003Under cover of RC No 242A dated 25 June 2015, CMNC submitted the Aspinall Report. Under cover of RC No 242B dated 25 June 2015, CMNC submitted five new witness statements (\u201cthe Five Witness Statements\u201d).', '101\\u2003By CC No 208 dated 25 June 2015, Jaguar objected to CMNC\u2019s submission of the Aspinall Report and the Five Witness Statements. Jaguar emphasised that CMNC had not applied, nor provided any grounds, for the admission of the Aspinall Report and the Five Witness Statements, and the Main Hearing was to commence in barely more than a week\u2019s time.', '102\\u2003Under cover of RC No 245 dated 27 June 2015, CMNC applied for the Aspinall Report and the Five Witness Statements to be admitted.', '103\\u2003By TC No 225 dated 29 June 2015, the Tribunal stated that it would be premature to make orders excluding material then. However, Jaguar applied for and obtained leave to respond to CMNC\u2019s application for the admission of the Aspinall Report and the Five Witness Statements. Jaguar then issued its response to CMNC\u2019s application under cover of CC No 213 dated 28 June 2015, requesting the Tribunal to deny CMNC\u2019s application and to exclude the Aspinall Report and the Five Witness Statements in their entirety.', '104\\u2003By TC No 230 dated 3 July 2015, the Tribunal stated that it would not grant leave for CMNC to rely on the Aspinall Report. The pertinent portions of the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning are as follows:', '105\\u2003On 3 July 2015, three days before the commencement of the Main Hearing (see [106] below), the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (\u201cthe CICIG\u201d) released a report (\u201cthe CICIG Report\u201d) stating that Mr Ernesto Cordova (\u201cMr Cordova\u201d), a Jaguar representative and one of Jaguar\u2019s witnesses in the Arbitration, had bribed government officials in relation to Jaguar\u2019s dispute with CMNC and the completion of the Project. According to the CICIG, Jaguar had made payments to Ms Karen Cancinos (\u201cMs Cancinos\u201d), who was linked to public officials, under fictitious consultancy contracts. I will refer to these allegations as \u201cthe Corruption Allegations\u201d.', '106\\u2003The Main Hearing commenced on 6 July 2015.', '107\\u2003On 9 July 2015, the CICIG released a press release based on the CICIG Report. On 10 July 2015, counsel for CMNC brought the Corruption Allegations to the Tribunal\u2019s attention.', '108\\u2003By CC No 218 dated 12 July 2015, Jaguar informed the Tribunal that in view of the Corruption Allegations, Jaguar had reviewed its damages claim and was withdrawing its claim for public relations fees of US$2,526,071 (\u201cthe PR Fees Claim\u201d), which included fees paid to Ms Cancinos.', '109\\u2003On 25 November 2015, the Tribunal rendered the Award. In summary, the Tribunal unanimously found that Jaguar Energy had validly terminated the EPC Contract for default by CMNC and allowed Jaguar\u2019s claim for liquidated damages and the ETC Claim. The Tribunal dismissed all but one of CMNC\u2019s claims for extensions of time. The Tribunal ordered CMNC to pay Jaguar a total sum of US$129,389,417, interest and costs.'"}

They also arrested Abdul Karim bin Mohamed Kuppai Khan (\u201cAbdul Karim\u201d), who was with Ilango at the time.', '9\\u2003On 13 November 2015 at about 7.30am, Noor Azmi was arrested at the Woodlands Checkpoint after he entered Singapore in a lorry with registration number WCH1672 (\u201cthe Lorry\u201d).', '10\\u2003After Ravan\u2019s arrest, the CNB officers searched his flat at #06-349 of Block 422, and recovered the following items:', '(a)\\u2003A black haversack (A1) containing two orange plastic bags (A1A and A1B) and a Sheng Shiong plastic bag. In each of the orange plastic bags, there was one bundle each wrapped in aluminium foil (A1A1 and A1B1). In the Sheng Shiong plastic bag, there was also a foil-wrapped bundle (A1B2A).

During one of their subsequent meetings, Ilango informed Abdul Karim that he was facing financial difficulties. On the night of 21 October 2015, Abdul Karim called Ilango and offered him a job. The job involved Ilango collecting some items for Abdul Karim from Jurong Port the following morning. Ilango took up the offer, and he suspected that he would be collecting illegal drugs.', '16\\u2003Noor Azmi\u2019s work as a lorry driver involved delivering piling concrete to work sites in Singapore using the Lorry. Noor Azmi was recruited by a Malaysian Indian known to him as \u201cGobi\u201d to transport drugs into Singapore. In Singapore, the drugs would then be collected by third parties who were unknown to Noor Azmi. Gobi promised Noor Azmi RM600 per delivery of drugs into Singapore.', '17\\u2003On 21 October 2015 between 10.00pm to 11.00pm, Gobi arranged to meet Noor Azmi at a petrol kiosk in Johor Bahru. There, Gobi passed Noor Azmi the black haversack (A1). Noor Azmi knew that the black haversack contained \u201cganja\u201d (being a street name for cannabis). He placed the black haversack under the floor board of the front passenger seat of the Lorry.', '18\\u2003On Gobi\u2019s instructions, Noor Azmi entered Singapore on 22 October 2015 at about 6.00am. Upon clearing Customs, Noor Azmi called Gobi who then told him to drive to an SPC Petrol Kiosk at 33 Jalan Buroh to wait for someone to collect the black haversack. Noor Azmi followed Gobi\u2019s instructions and waited.', '19\\u2003Meanwhile, Abdul Karim called Ilango that morning, and told him to head to Jurong Port Road to collect the item for him. Ilango asked Ravan to accompany him to complete a job. Ravan agreed, knowing that the job involved illegal drugs. Shortly after 7.00am, they boarded a taxi from Clementi Avenue 1 and headed to Jurong Port Road.', '20\\u2003In the taxi, Ilango conversed with Abdul Karim on the phone. Ilango clarified with Abdul Karim the location for the collection of the item. Ilango was told to head to the SPC Petrol Kiosk along Jalan Buroh. Ravan heard Ilango talking to someone over the phone in Tamil, asking for the destination Ilango should be heading to. While on the way to the SPC Petrol Kiosk, during one of the phone conversations with Abdul Karim, Ilango came to know that he would be collecting \u201cganja\u201d.', '21\\u2003After alighting from the taxi at the flyover near the SPC Petrol Kiosk at 33 Jalan Buroh, Ilango crossed an overhead bridge and walked into the petrol kiosk. Ravan remained near the bridge to wait for Ilango.', '22\\u2003In compliance with Abdul Karim\u2019s instructions, Ilango entered the Lorry through the unlocked front passenger door. He collected the black haversack (A1). Noor Azmi saw him collect the black haversack. Shortly after, Ilango alighted from the Lorry and walked towards Ravan with the black haversack (A1). Ravan then flagged a taxi and both of them boarded it.', '23\\u2003While in the taxi, Abdul Karim called Ilango and told him that there were three blocks of \u201cganja\u201d inside the black haversack (A1). Abdul Karim told Ilango to hold onto the drugs which he would collect later from Ilango. Ilango told Ravan that there were \u201cthree books\u201d inside the haversack. Ravan understood this to mean that there were three kilograms of \u201cganja\u201d. Ilango then suggested that Ravan take medical leave for the day. Ravan did not agree but decided to report late to work.', '24\\u2003When they reached their destination, Ilango passed Ravan the black haversack (A1) while he paid the taxi fare.', '25\\u2003After alighting from the taxi, Ilango suggested that the \u201cganja\u201d be kept at Ravan\u2019s house and told Ravan that there would be people coming to collect the \u201cganja\u201d. Ravan agreed and brought Ilango to his flat. Ravan was still holding on to the black haversack (A1) containing the \u201cganja\u201d.', '26\\u2003Ilango then received specific instructions from Abdul Karim to help cut and repack the drugs. Ilango then told Ravan that he wanted Ravan\u2019s help to cut and repack the three kilograms of \u201cganja\u201d. Ravan agreed.', '27\\u2003Ilango then instructed Ravan to cut the three blocks of \u201cganja\u201d into halves. Ravan then took a kitchen knife from his house and, together with Ilango, cut the three blocks of \u201cganja\u201d into six half blocks weighing approximately 500 grams each. In cutting each block, Ilango helped hold down the block while Ravan used the knife to cut the block in half. In the process of cutting the blocks, some loose \u201cganja\u201d fell out. Ilango and Ravan packed these loose \u201cganja\u201d into small packets.', '28\\u2003After cutting the \u201cganja\u201d, they packed two of the six half blocks using the aluminium foil that came with the initial three blocks of \u201cganja\u201d. They placed these two blocks in the black haversack (A1). Then, they packed the four remaining half blocks of \u201cganja\u201d into individual bags. After Ravan took a shower, they headed down to Ilango\u2019s flat.', '29\\u2003In Ilango\u2019s flat, Ravan spotted a weighing scale. He suggested to Ilango that they could use the weighing scale to measure and ensure that they had indeed cut each block into half blocks of 500 grams each. Ilango agreed and they brought the weighing scale back to Ravan\u2019s unit to weigh the six half blocks. As the six half blocks weighed more than 500 grams, Ilango removed the excess from each block, and they both repacked these into small packets. In total, there were 34 small packets of vegetable matter (including the ones packed earlier).', '30\\u2003Ravan placed the 34 small packets inside a diaper (B1) which he then placed in the bottommost drawer of a brown wardrobe in his flat. The rest of the \u201cganja\u201d were placed on the floor of the living room in front of a brown wardrobe. It was then about 1.15pm. Ilango then told Ravan that he wanted to rest in Ravan\u2019s flat while waiting for someone to come to collect the drugs. Ravan told Ilango to return to his own flat as he wanted to drop by his workplace. Both of them left Ravan\u2019s flat at about 1.40 pm.', '31\\u2003After dropping by his workplace, Ravan returned to Block 422 at about 2.45pm. He met Ilango at the void deck at about 3.15pm. Ilango commented that there was no good place in the vicinity to hand over the \u201cganja\u201d to people later. Ravan then suggested and showed Ilango some places where he could handover the \u201cganja\u201d.', '32\\u2003Shortly after, Ilango received a phone call from Abdul Karim who gave instructions to cut the \u201cganja\u201d further and relayed specific instructions on how to do so. Ilango then told Ravan that they needed to cut two of the six half blocks of drugs into further halves to make four smaller blocks and also to pack the \u201cganja\u201d. Both Ravan and Ilango proceeded back to Ravan\u2019s flat where they carried out the instructions. Abdul Karim also instructed Ilango in the phone call to set aside one half block and three smaller blocks for Abdul Karim\u2019s collection.', '33\\u2003Shortly before 4.00pm, Ilango told Ravan that someone would be coming to collect all the \u201cganja\u201d. Ravan then told Ilango that he had to return to his workplace. Ilango then brought one half block (G1A1) and three smaller blocks of drugs (G1B1A, G1B2A1 and G1B3A1) to his flat. Ilango told Ravan that someone would collect the \u201cganja\u201d first and that the remainder would be collected by some people within the day. The \u201cganja\u201d left in Ravan\u2019s flat were three half blocks and one smaller block (A1A1A, A1B2A1, A2A1A and A1B1A), and the 34 small packets in the diaper (B1). For his assistance, Ilango promised Ravan $50 after he had asked Ravan to cut the \u201cganja\u201d the second time.', '34\\u2003At about 4.00pm, Abdul Karim called Ilango, and asked him to meet him downstairs without the drugs first. They were arrested at the basement carpark of Block 422. By then, Ravan had already been arrested.'"}

They were each taken to an office for a strip search to be conducted by CNB officers. During the strip search, the CNB officers discovered a bundle wrapped in newspaper strapped on the applicant\u2019s left thigh. On further inspection, it was revealed that the bundle contained a transparent plastic bag with white granular substance, which was subsequently analysed and found to contain not less than 42.72g of diamorphine. The applicant was arrested and subsequently charged under s 7 of the MDA for importing not less than 42.72g of diamorphine into Singapore.', '6\\u2003At the time of the applicant\u2019s arrest, he claimed in his contemporaneous statement that on that very day, he had met a Chinese man by the name of \u201cKing\u201d at a coffee shop in Johor Bahru, Malaysia. He claimed that King had passed him a packet wrapped in brown paper, which he genuinely believed to be a packet of food, together with a transparent plastic packet of curry, and instructed him to deliver those items to a person in Woodlands, Singapore. King gave the applicant a SIM card, and asked him to use the SIM card to contact a hand phone number that King had provided upon entering Singapore. King also told the applicant to wait in front of a designated \u201c7-Eleven\u201d convenience store when at Woodlands, and to pass the items to a Chinese man who would be wearing a blue-coloured pair of spectacles and driving a dark blue Toyota Camry. The applicant claimed that he had agreed to perform this delivery because he had owed King money, and he also wanted to borrow another RM500 from King, which King would lend only after the delivery was complete.', '7\\u2003But as part of the applicant\u2019s account at trial, he further gave evidence that as he was about to leave to deliver the said items, King brought him into King\u2019s car and instructed him to deliver the bundle wrapped in newspaper instead. King apparently told him that the bundle contained \u201ccompany products\u201d or \u201ccompany spares\u201d, and instructed him to secure the bundle to his thigh for the delivery. When the applicant initially resisted King\u2019s request, King slapped him on his face and punched him two to three times on his chest, threatening that if he refused to deliver the Bundle, King would kill one Shalini, who was the applicant\u2019s girlfriend. The applicant thus allowed King to strap the bundle to his left thigh with yellow tape. King then arranged for the applicant to return to his apartment to prepare for the delivery. Back at his apartment, the applicant asked Kumarsen to give him a ride on his motorcycle, telling him that he had to take some money to Singapore. The applicant also changed into a bigger pair of trousers, which belonged to one Tamilselvan, who is Kumarsen\u2019s nephew and was the applicant\u2019s roommate.', '8\\u2003On 22 November 2010, I found, following a trial, the applicant guilty of the charge, convicted him accordingly, and sentenced him to death as mandated by s 33 read with the Second Schedule to the MDA: see Public Prosecutor v Nagaenthran a\/l K Dharmalingam [2011] 2 SLR 830.

{"casename":"2018_SGHC_114","fact":"'15\\u2003As the Court observed in Soh Meiyun at [56] and [60], criminal compensation is prima facie appropriate in maid abuse cases and should generally be a matter of course because the victims are often, if not invariably, impecunious. It will rarely be feasible for them to pursue civil proceedings while working full-time in their employers\u2019 homes, particularly when they are unfamiliar with the legal system. We accept that that was the case for the victim here, who is now working for another employer. We also consider it appropriate to compensate her for the physical and psychological injuries inflicted by the offenders, for which they would have been liable in tort.', '16\\u2003In particular, Tay was convicted of inflicting the following injuries on the victim:', '(a)\\u2003slapping the victim once, hard, on her left cheek;', '(b)\\u2003making the victim stand on a plastic stool on one leg and hold up another plastic stool with one hand while he pushed an empty plastic bottle into her mouth, and making her stay in this position for 30 minutes;', '(c)\\u2003pulling the victim by her hand out of the car and onto the ground, causing her to feel pain in her chest;', '(d)\\u2003hitting the victim on her head on four occasions, either with a bundle of three canes or with a bamboo stick;', '(e)\\u2003kicking the victim on her left waist;', '(f)\\u2003pulling the victim by her hair to a room, grabbing her chin and pushing her head such that it hit the edge of a cabinet; and', '(g)\\u2003causing another maid, Moe Moe Than, to slap the victim 10 times.', '17\\u2003Chia was convicted of slapping the victim twice and punching her thrice on her forehead.', '18\\u2003In our assessment, the victim should be compensated for (1) the pain and suffering she underwent as a result of the offences, and (2) the salary that she would have earned but for being unemployed as a result of the offences.', '19\\u2003Regarding compensation for pain and suffering, the Prosecution suggested a sum of $500 per incident of abuse, taking into account the physical and psychological harm suffered by the victim. We agree. The Guidelines for the Assessment of General Damages in Personal Injury Cases (Academy Publishing, 2010) recommend $500 for a single abrasion or contusion and a starting award of $500 to $1500 for multiple contusions on any part of the body. The courts have also awarded similar sums for bruises \u2013 for example, $1,500 (bruise on the right side of the face), $1,500 (5cm x 5cm bruise over the medial edge of the left knee) and $500 (small 1cm bruise over left eyebrow) (see Practitioners\u2019 Library \u2013 Assessment of Damages: Personal Injuries and Fatal Accidents (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2017) at p 837). Adopting a rough-and-ready measure, since Tay has been convicted of hurting the victim on 10 occasions, this corresponds to a sum of $5,000. For Chia the sum is $1,000.', '20\\u2003As for prospective earnings, the Prosecution submits that Chia (being the victim\u2019s employer) should pay her $5,400. When the victim left the offenders\u2019 household in December 2012, she had just re-contracted a further two-year employment term with the offenders at a salary of $450 per month. She left for Indonesia in April 2015 and returned to Singapore on 25 August 2015 to work for a new employer. She was therefore unemployed for a period of 32 months in total, of which 23 months could have been spent working for the offenders under her two-year contract. The Prosecution submits that the victim should be compensated for only one year of unemployment ($450 x 12 months = $5,400), bearing in mind that she may not have completed this contract in any event, and that she would have been required to mitigate her loss under the civil law.', '21\\u2003In our assessment, it would not be right to order the appellants to compensate the victim for the entire period during which she was unemployed. There is no evidence as to why she did not seek or could not have sought alternative employment during that time. However, it is equally unrealistic to expect the victim to have found alternative employment immediately. This would have been practically impossible. Moreover, the victim may have needed time to recover from her serious psychological abuse at the offenders\u2019 hands, and could have been understandably reluctant to resume work as a domestic helper in another household. Four months is, in our assessment, a reasonable estimation of the time she would reasonably have required to take on alternative employment. The appellants should therefore compensate the victim for four months of unemployment at her then-salary ($450 x 4 = $1,800). This amount is to be borne equally between Tay and Chia (ie, $900 each).'"}

The total projected cash deficits were $138,400 in July 2015, $158,255 in August 2015, $180,410 in September 2015 and $200,465 in October 2015. As a result, on 12 June 2015, the Second Extra-ordinary General Meeting (\u201cEGM\u201d) of Duchess Residences was held and a special resolution (\u201cthe Special Levy resolution\u201d) was passed to impose a one-time Special Levy (\u201cthe Special Levy\u201d) to alleviate the MCST\u2019s impending cash flow problems. The Special Levy was to be paid by all SPs in three instalments: one in July 2015, one in October 2015 and one in March 2016.', '10\\u2003On 15 June 2015, the MCST sent the Appellant an invoice for the payment of the first Special Levy instalment. On 30 June 2015, the Appellant replied with an email to the MCST (\u201cthe June email\u201d) highlighting the procedural and substantive errors in the imposition of the Special Levy and demanding that the MCST re-issue a Tax Invoice removing the payment of the Special Levy.', '11\\u2003On 3 July 2015, judgment was granted to the MCST against the Developer in DC Suit No 3497 of 2014 and in September 2015, the MCST received payment of $261,055 from the 13 SPs (\u201cthe judgment sum\u201d). However, orders of costs remained in contention at that point in time.', '12\\u2003On 1 October 2015, the second instalment of the Special Levy fell due. The Appellant failed to pay both the first and the second instalments.', '13\\u2003On 12 November 2015, the MC held a meeting to discuss whether the MCST\u2019s receipt of the judgment sum should be disclosed to all the SPs. The First and Third Respondents were absent. At the meeting, the Second Respondent argued in favour of disclosure from the point of transparency and accountability. 1', 'The MC, on the other hand, considered the disadvantages of disclosure, including the cost of convening another EGM to revoke the Special Levy, the unresolved issue of costs in DC Suit No 3497 of 2014, the risk that some SPs might not want to pay for further instalments of the Special Levy, and the fact that the Special Levy resolution had legal effect in any event until revoked. 2', 'Eventually, the MC decided to withhold disclosure of the receipt of the judgment sum.', '14\\u2003By a letter dated 2 December 2015 from the MCST\u2019s solicitors, Wong Thomas & Leong, to the Appellant, the MCST demanded payment of $2,050.73 in respect of the Special Levy. On 15 December 2015, the Appellant replied by way of an email to Wong Thomas & Leong (\u201cthe December email\u201d), stating that the Special Levy was \u201cinvalid\u201d due to its violations of the BMSMA. In response, the MCST filed the writ of summons against the Appellant on 23 December 2015 in MC Suit No 24066 of 2015 to claim the Special Levy of $2,050.73 with interest and costs. The MCST obtained judgment against the Appellant on 7 March 2017 and the trial judge\u2019s grounds of decision is found at MCST Plan No. 3720 v Gao Shuchao [2017] SGMC 10 (\u201cMCST Plan No. 3720\u201d).', '15\\u2003On 22 December 2015, a notice was sent by the MCST to the SPs to remind them about the payment of the last instalment of the Special Levy.', '16\\u2003On 13 January 2016, the MCST received payment of costs of $40,728.48 in relation to DC Suit No 3497 of 2014 from the Developer.

{"casename":"2018_SGHC_116","fact":"'7\\u2003I begin by briefly recounting the relevant facts. The first three charges relate to two spontaneous group fights that occurred in the early hours of 24 December 2015. The appellant and some of his friends (collectively referred to as \u201cthe offenders\u201d) had gathered at a bar named Beer Inn on Circular Road (\u201cthe Bar\u201d) for drinks. Some of the accused persons were known to be affiliated with secret societies. However, the events of that night were not related to any such affiliations. At around 2.40am, two of the offenders (\u201cthe couple\u201d), who were in a relationship, started quarrelling outside the Bar. They were shouting at and pushing each other. Eight of the others in the group, including the appellant, accompanied the couple and tried to intervene.', '8\\u2003The dispute outside the Bar attracted the attention of five onlookers in the vicinity. One of the offenders confronted two of the onlookers and demanded to know what they were looking at, and subsequently started punching and kicking them. Five other offenders joined in the attack.', '9\\u2003Meanwhile, the appellant was involved in an attack against another onlooker, Akash Kukreja (\u201cKukreja\u201d), who had walked over to where the couple was standing. The appellant blocked Kukreja\u2019s way and asked him what he wanted. Kukreja replied that he wanted to make sure that the girl in the couple was not hurt. The appellant then went up close to Kukreja and told him to move away, and was met by a push from Kukreja. The appellant in turn punched Kukreja, who tried to retaliate but fell to the ground. Two other offenders joined the appellant and punched and kicked Kukreja while he was on the ground. Kukreja\u2019s companion, Charlotte Roscoe (\u201cRoscoe\u201d), tried to help but she was then punched and kicked by two other offenders. Two more offenders subsequently joined in punching and kicking Kukreja and Roscoe. In total, there were seven offenders, including the appellant, who attacked Kukreja and Roscoe.', '10\\u2003At this point, two other onlookers, who had been drinking at a nearby bar, saw Kukreja and Roscoe being attacked and tried to intervene, but they too were assaulted. Two more offenders saw the commotion from the Bar and walked towards the attack. One of them pushed Mark Walsh (\u201cWalsh\u201d), who was the manager of a nearby bar and who had approached the scene of the fight to intervene to stop the fight. The fight eventually stopped with the intervention of Walsh and a bartender working at the Bar. The appellant\u2019s involvement in these events formed the subject matter of the first rioting charge.', '11\\u2003A short while after the first fight, the appellant and six other offenders left the Bar intending to go to another club. As they were walking away, Kukreja and two other onlookers who had earlier been assaulted, known only as George and Flexy, went back to the Bar intending to confront the offenders. Another fight ensued between Kukreja, George and Flexy and three of the offenders. The appellant, who was together with three other offenders, saw the commotion and rushed back to join this fight.', '12\\u2003The appellant together with six other offenders punched and kicked Kukreja, George and Flexy. Kukreja managed to escape but George and Flexy were chased by nine of the offenders, including the appellant. During the chase, one of the offenders threw a bar stool at George and Flexy. George fell down and the appellant and three other offenders then punched and kicked him. George and Flexy eventually managed to escape and ran towards OCBC Centre with the appellant and three other offenders giving chase for some distance. The appellant\u2019s involvement in these events formed the subject matter of the second rioting charge.', '13\\u2003The appellant returned to Circular Road. At that time, another dispute was taking place between a friend of the appellant and a friend of the deceased near the taxi stand on Circular Road (further down from the scene of the two riots). The deceased, who had been observing the first two riots but had not gotten involved, attempted to intervene and mediate in this dispute. The appellant, intending to stop the deceased from intervening, ran towards the deceased and delivered a lunging punch from behind to the lower jaw of the deceased, causing him to fall and land heavily on the road with his head and shoulders hitting the kerb. The appellant then left the scene. Walsh, who had witnessed this attack, testified that the deceased was knocked unconscious by the blow and fell directly to the concrete ground without taking any evasive action to break his fall. He was later sent to the hospital unconscious and found to have sustained severe head injuries. He eventually died from these injuries about a week later on New Year\u2019s Day 2016.', '14\\u2003The appellant was arrested on 5 January 2016.

Together with his co-workers, the Applicant carried pipes of various sizes and weights to a storage area. According to the Applicant, each pipe weighed about 50 to 60 kilograms. The Applicant and his co-workers would have to carry the pipes for about 15 to 20 metres to the storage area. This was described as regular and routine housekeeping work.', '6\\u2003As it turned out, 8 August 2015 was anything but a routine day. The Applicant\u2019s version of events was that as he lifted one of these pipes with a co-worker known only as Sakthivel Kalimuthu, he felt some pain in his lower back. He thought nothing of it initially. It was still bearable. But as he was putting the pipe down, the pain became intense. It was unbearable now. He quickly sat down on the ground and told Kalimuthu that he was in pain and requested for the supervisor. The project superintendent, one Gazi Sohag, and the safety coordinator, one Velu Senthil, came over to attend to the Applicant. Sohag asked the Applicant to try to move, but the Applicant could not stand up.', '7\\u2003The Applicant was then brought to the site office with the help of two other workers at the worksite.

Senthil, the safety coordinator, was accompanying him. Senthil registered the Applicant at the Accident and Emergency Department of KTPH. Senthil explained to the doctor who examined the Applicant how the accident happened. An X-ray was performed.

Each of the three lanes was separated by road dividers and could accommodate the width of only one vehicle. Vehicles in the lanes therefore could not switch lanes.', '4\\u2003That night, the respondent drove his car into the innermost left lane. He stopped his car, turned off its engine and alighted to go to a nearby ATM to withdraw money. There was a female passenger in his car. Its hazard lights were not turned on at that time. Sometime later, the victim drove into the same lane without realising that the respondent\u2019s car ahead of him was stationary. As a result, his way forward was blocked and the only way out was for the victim to reverse his car out of the lane. However, this was complicated by a third car which subsequently came up behind the victim\u2019s car.', '5\\u2003When the respondent returned to his car several minutes later, the victim sounded his horn.

The syndicate targeted slot machines made by certain manufacturers. Syndicate members would form teams comprising a \u201cMaster\u201d (who was the team leader) and \u201cPlayers\u201d. They would use smartphone devices to record the play patterns of the slot machines in question.

These syndicate members proceeded to record the play patterns on specific slot machines at the casinos at Marina Bay Sands (\u201cMBS\u201d) and Resorts World Sentosa (\u201cRWS\u201d). These recordings were then analysed, and the analysed data was given to the Appellant while he was in Russia.', '7\\u2003The Appellant taught Skubnik and Egorov how to use the smartphone devices. In April 2016, the Appellant instructed Skubnik to go to Singapore with the smartphone devices and use them in the casinos here. He also told Skubnik that he would be travelling to Singapore for this job. Separately, he informed Egorov of the same.', '8\\u2003The trio arrived in Singapore on 5 May 2016. The Appellant was the \u201cMaster\u201d for this job. He provided Skubnik and Egorov with the analysed data (which was stored in a computer). Together, they visited the casinos at MBS and RWS and identified the compromised slot machines. They then used the smartphone devices and gained an advantage when playing at these slot machines. In accordance with their agreement, Skubnik and Egorov would each receive about 10% of the winnings, while the Appellant would receive about 15 to 20%. The balance would go to the syndicate.', '9\\u2003On 7 May 2016, between 8.18pm and 11.11pm, the Appellant used the smartphone devices to gain an advantage while playing at the compromised slot machines at the casino at MBS and won $30,959.90 in this way. This gave rise to a charge under s 172A(1)(c) and punishable under s 172A(2) of the CCA (namely, District Arrest Case No (\u201cDAC\u201d) 919377\/2016), which the Appellant pleaded guilty to.', '10\\u2003The other five charges to which the Appellant pleaded guilty were charges under s 172A(1)(c) read with s 172A(3) and punishable under s 172A(2) of the CCA.

For these charges, either Skubnik or Egorov would use the smartphone devices to gain an advantage while playing at the compromised slot machines in the casinos at MBS and RWS. The details of these charges are as follows:', '11\\u2003Skubnik was the first to be dealt with. He pleaded guilty before another district judge on 28 June 2016 to three charges under s 172A(1)(c) and punishable under s 172A(2) of the CCA. Two similar charges and one charge under s 7(1)(a) of the Corrosive and Explosive Substances and Offensive Weapons Act (Cap 65, 2013 Rev Ed) were taken into consideration for sentencing purposes.

Egorov pleaded guilty to three charges under s 172A(1)(c) and punishable under s 172A(2) of the CCA. Seven similar charges were taken into consideration for sentencing purposes. On 12 April 2017, the District Judge sentenced Egorov as follows:', '13\\u2003As for the Appellant, as mentioned earlier, he pleaded guilty to one charge under s 172A(1)(c) of the CCA and five charges under s 172A(1)(c) read with s 172A(3) of the CCA, all of which were punishable under s 172A(2) of the CCA (see the facts giving rise to these charges at [9]\u2013[10] above). Ten charges under s 172A(1)(c) read with s 172A(3) and punishable under s 172A(2) of the CCA were taken into consideration for sentencing purposes. On 12 April 2017, the District Judge sentenced the Appellant as follows:', '14\\u2003The District Judge issued the written grounds for her decision on 18 May 2017 (see Public Prosecutor v Egorov Andrei and Logachev Vladislav [2017] SGDC 141 (\u201cthe GD\u201d)).', '15\\u2003The District Judge held that since the Appellant, Skubnik and Egorov were participants in a common criminal enterprise, the parity principle would apply if they were \u201cequally placed in terms of culpability\u201d. However, as it was accepted that the Appellant was more culpable than Skubnik and Egorov, the District Judge thought that a \u201csuitable uplift\u201d in the Appellant\u2019s sentence, relative to the sentences meted out to his two accomplices, was called for (see the GD at [20]).', '16\\u2003As between Skubnik and Egorov, the District Judge held that their roles were \u201cidentical\u201d, and that the main difference lay in: (a) the number of charges each of them faced; and (b) the amount each of them cheated. With respect to the number of charges each of them faced, the District Judge noted that this was a function of the number of times each of them entered the casino at either MBS or RWS and played at the compromised slot machines there. She therefore thought that this was not the critical differentiating factor between them. Rather, she considered that the second factor \u2013 the amount cheated \u2013 presented the critical difference between Skubnik and Egorov. In this respect, the amount cheated by Egorov was more than double the amount cheated by Skubnik. The District Judge found this significant because the amount cheated \u201crepresented the harm caused by the offences\u201d. Furthermore, since each accomplice\u2019s percentage share was derived from the amount cheated, Egorov stood to benefit more. Accordingly, the District Judge considered that Egorov ought to receive a higher sentence than Skubnik, and held that an appropriate difference was eight months\u2019 imprisonment (see the GD at [21]).', '17\\u2003The District Judge considered the present case to be more aggravated than Public Prosecutor v Apinyowichian Yongyut and others [2016] SGDC 200 (\u201cYongyut\u201d), which was relied on by the Appellant and Egorov, even though that case involved a larger amount cheated. She held that the present case \u201cinvolved our casinos falling victim to a high tech and organised global syndicate\u201d, and that \u201c[t]he sophistication and complexity [lay] in the analysis and decoding of the data to recognise the winning play outcomes\u201d (see the GD at [26]). She considered the fact that the Appellant and Egorov had operated as part of an organised criminal syndicate to be an aggravating factor. In her view, the fact that no losses were, in the event, actually sustained by the casinos (because the amount cheated was recovered by the authorities) was not a compelling consideration due to the \u201coverriding public interest\u201d (see the GD at [27]).', '18\\u2003The District Judge did consider the Appellant\u2019s and Egorov\u2019s pleas of guilt and their cooperation with the authorities to be mitigating (see the GD at [28]). However, she did not place any weight on the Appellant\u2019s claims that he had committed the offences due to threats and harassment from one \u201cIgor\u201d (the head of the syndicate) and the syndicate (see the GD at [29]\u2013[30]).', '19\\u2003As noted at the outset, MA 9133\/2017 is the Appellant\u2019s appeal against the sentence imposed on him by the District Judge. This was fixed for hearing before this court on 15 September 2017 together with Magistrate\u2019s Appeal No 9132 of 2017 (\u201cMA 9132\/2017\u201d), which was Egorov\u2019s appeal against his sentence. However, Egorov applied to withdraw MA 9132\/2017 at the hearing. I granted him leave to do so after drawing his attention, through his counsel, to the fact that if the Appellant\u2019s appeal in MA 9133\/2017 were successful, it might strengthen the prospects of his own appeal in MA 9132\/2017. Egorov noted this, but was clear that he did not wish to maintain his appeal. As for Skubnik, he did not appeal against his sentence and had finished serving his sentence by the time of the hearing. In the circumstances, only MA 9133\/2017 remains outstanding.'"}

{"casename":"2018_SGHC_121","fact":"'4\\u2003An introduction to the background of this application must begin with a description of the Bhojwani family tree.', '5\\u2003The Testator was the patriarch of the Bhojwani family, and it is his last will and testament (\u201cthe Will\u201d) that was at the heart of this application. He is survived by his three sons, namely, Jethanand Harkishindas Bhojwani (\u201cJethanand\u201d), Jaikirshin Harkishindas Bhojwani (\u201cJaikirshin\u201d) and the Defendant. 1', '6\\u2003Jethanand, Jaikirshin and the Defendant are each married and have children of their own. The Defendant was at all material times the sole executor of the Will, 2', 'while each of the three sons is trustee over different parts of the Estate. 3', '7\\u2003The Plaintiff is the wife of Jethanand, and hence the daughter-in-law of the Testator. 4', 'However, the Plaintiff\u2019s marriage with Jethanand deteriorated over the years, and this culminated in divorce proceedings filed by her on 5 October 2017. 5', 'The Plaintiff is one of the beneficiaries named in the Will. 6', '8\\u2003Pursuant to the Will, the Estate was divided into three groups of assets. Generally, each of the Testator\u2019s three sons was appointed as trustee for each group of assets, with his respective family members being the beneficiaries of the assets of which he is trustee. 7', '9\\u2003I pause to note that the Will creates five discretionary trusts: one for the assets under cl 4 of the Will, one for the assets under cl 5 of the Will and three separate discretionary trusts for the residue of the Estate under cl 7 of the Will. The Plaintiff\u2019s interest as a beneficiary flows from her position as a member of the class of discretionary beneficiaries under cl 5 of the Will, as well as one of the trusts under cl 7.', '10\\u2003Clause 4 of the Will specifies assets of which the Defendant (the executor of the Estate) is trustee. Clause 4 states: 8', '11\\u2003The named beneficiaries under cl 4 are the Defendant\u2019s wife and son.', '12\\u2003Clause 5 of the Will provides for the group of assets of which Jethanand (husband of the Plaintiff) is trustee. Clause 5 states: 9', '13\\u2003As can be seen from cl 5, while it is true that the Plaintiff is a beneficiary named in the Will, she is only a beneficiary with respect to the assets of which Jethanand is the trustee. The other named beneficiaries of these assets are the three sons of Jethanand and the Plaintiff.', '14\\u2003In addition, the residuary estate, being all the remaining assets in the Estate that had not been previously dealt with in the Will (\u201cthe Residuary Estate\u201d), is further divided into three parts and given to Jethanand, Jaikirshin and the Defendant to hold on trust for their respective families. Clause 7 states: 10', '15\\u2003Reading the Will in its entirety, it is apparent that the Plaintiff is a beneficiary of three main categories of assets (collectively, \u201cthe Assets\u201d), namely:', '(a)\\u2003the property at 32 Branksome Road, Singapore (\u201cthe Property\u201d);', '(b)\\u2003the shares listed in items (b) to (j) of cl 5.1(iv) (\u201cthe Clause 5 Shares\u201d); and', '(c)\\u2003one-third of the Residuary Estate.', '16\\u2003At this juncture, it would be pertinent to state that at the beginning of the hearing, I had queried the parties on whether they were ad idem as to there not being a need to examine the deponents of the affidavits, to which they had both responded in the positive. Therefore, I saw this as an indication that both parties did not challenge the veracity of the evidence in the affidavits of both parties. In any event, given that this action commenced by way of originating summons, I did not expect any major disputes of fact.', '17\\u2003The Testator passed away on 4 March 2007. 11', 'Subsequently, the Defendant was issued with a grant of probate in relation to the Estate on 12 February 2008. 12', '18\\u2003The Defendant transferred the Clause 5 Shares to Jethanand on 1 August 2008. The stamp duty certificates for the transfers of the Clause 5 Shares were exhibited in the Defendant\u2019s affidavit. 13', 'Additionally, the Defendant stated in his affidavit that no dividends had been declared in relation to eight companies during the period between 4 March 2007 and 1 August 2008. 14', 'These eight companies largely correspond to the companies in which the Clause 5 Shares belong, with the exception of Shankar\u2019s Emporium (Private) Limited. I note that the Defendant did not make an express statement that no dividends were declared for Shankar\u2019s Emporium (Private) Limited. However, this inconsistency was not raised before the court during the hearing and I will say nothing more on the matter.', '19\\u2003Upon the death of the Testator, legal title to the Property had vested in the Defendant, who remained the registered proprietor until 12 October 2016. On 12 October 2016, the Defendant transferred the Property to the Plaintiff. This transfer was done on the instructions of Jethanand, who had previously conferred with his three sons and the Plaintiff, all of whom were the named discretionary beneficiaries of the Property. 15', '20\\u2003As for the Residuary Estate, a consolidation of all the remaining assets less all the Estate-related expenses resulted in a net deficit of $57,966.52. A breakdown of this figure was exhibited in the Defendant\u2019s affidavit. 16', 'The Defendant stated in his affidavit that he and Jethanand had paid equal amounts to provide for this deficit. 17', '21\\u2003The Plaintiff and Jethanand resided at the Property together with their three sons. As noted above, Jethanand is the trustee and the Plaintiff together with their three sons are the beneficiaries of the Assets, which included the Property. Jethanand did not have any beneficial interest in the Property. The Defendant and his family resided next door at 32A Branksome Road.', '22\\u2003The Plaintiff asserted that she had not been informed of her beneficial interest under cll 5 and 7 of the Will until around November 2016. 18', '23\\u2003On or about 16 September 2016, the Plaintiff chanced upon a letter addressed to the Defendant, which referred to the Defendant as the occupant of the Property. 19', 'This prompted the Plaintiff to conduct a title search on the Property, which revealed that the Defendant was indeed the registered proprietor of the Property. 20', 'This came as a shock to the Plaintiff, because she had believed all along that Jethanand was the registered proprietor of the Property. The Plaintiff was of the view that the Defendant, as the executor of the Estate, should rightfully have transferred the Property to Jethanand, at least, in accordance with the Will.', '24\\u2003The Plaintiff therefore became concerned that the Defendant was similarly mismanaging the rest of the Estate, of which she is a beneficiary. On 12 October 2017, she sent a formal request to the Defendant for a full account of the part of the Estate in which she has an interest. 21', 'The Defendant responded on 17 October 2017 stating that he did not owe the Plaintiff a duty to account, and his duty was only to the trustee referred to in cl 5.1 of the Will, ie, Jethanand. 22', '25\\u2003On 30 October 2017, the Plaintiff filed Originating Summons No 1229 of 2017 to bring the present application.'"}

{"casename":"2018_SGHC_123","fact":"'8\\u2003The assistant registrar has set out a comprehensive summary of the facts underlying this action in his wide-ranging grounds of decision in IM Skaugen SE and another v MAN Diesel & Turbo SE and another [2016] SGHCR 6 (\u201cSkaugen\u201d). I therefore need set out only a brief summary.', '9\\u2003In 2000 and 2001, the Skaugen group and GATX Corporation (\u201cGATX\u201d) entered into a joint venture to commission, own and operate six gas carrying ships. 7', 'To that end, the Skaugen group entered into six shipbuilding contracts with shipbuilders in China. The first plaintiff entered into the first four of the six contracts in July 2000. 8', 'These four contracts were almost immediately novated to a special purpose company known as Somargas Limited (\u201cSomargas\u201d). 9', 'The last two of these six contracts were entered into in May 2001 by another special purpose company known as Vintergas Limited (\u201cVintergas\u201d). 10', 'Somargas 11', 'and Vintergas 12', 'are both Cayman Islands companies and are both owned equally by the Skaugen group and the GATX group.', '10\\u2003In the summary of the facts which follows, I do not distinguish between the position of the four entities involved: the first plaintiff, GATX, Somargas and Vintergas. That is because the first plaintiff conducted all negotiations with the defendants on behalf of Somargas and Vintergas. 13', 'Further, all four of the following features of this case are, for all material purposes, identical: (a) the six shipbuilding contracts; (b) the six ships; (c) the terms on which the first four shipbuilding contracts were novated to Somargas; and (d) the ownership of Somargas and Vintergas.', '11\\u2003The first plaintiff had the right, under the first four shipbuilding contracts, to approve the model of engine to be installed in those ships. 14', 'In mid-2000, the first plaintiff initiated a process to select the engine to be approved from those available on the market. 15', 'The first defendant participated in that process and promoted to the first plaintiff a particular model of four-stroke diesel engine which it designed and manufactured. 16', 'I shall refer to this engine as the \u201cMAN Engine\u201d. In the course of that process, in or around July 2000, the first defendant delivered to the first plaintiff a document known as the Project Planning Manual (\u201cPPM\u201d). The PPM is part of the defendants\u2019 standard promotional and marketing materials. It is a general document which is not tailored to a specific customer or to a specific engine 17', 'but which sets out the general specifications of a range of marine diesel engines available from the first defendant. One of those engines is the MAN Engine. So the PPM does state that the MAN Engine consumes fuel at no more than a specific rate under certain specified conditions. 18', '12\\u2003In or around November 2000, the defendants delivered to the shipbuilders a second document known as \u201c6. Kraftstoffsystem Fuel System\u201d (\u201cFSI\u201d). 19', 'The shipbuilders duly passed the FSI on to the plaintiffs. 20', 'Like the PPM, the FSI sets out general information about a range of marine diesel engines produced by the first defendant and is not tailored to a specific customer or to a specific engine. 21', 'But the FSI, in effect, maintained that the MAN Engine consumed fuel at no more that the specific rate set out in the PPM under the same specified conditions. 22', '13\\u2003The first plaintiff eventually granted formal approval under the shipbuilding contracts for the MAN Engine to be installed in the first four ships. 23', 'As for the last two ships, the first plaintiff caused Vintergas to enter into contracts with the shipbuilders which stipulated that the MAN Engine was to be installed in those two ships. 24', '14\\u2003As a result, the shipbuilders duly entered into six contracts to purchase six MAN Engines from the first defendant: four in September 2000 25', 'and a further two in June 2001. 26', 'The technical specifications in all six of these contracts between the shipbuilders and the first defendant stipulated that the MAN Engine ultimately delivered was to consume fuel at no more than the rate specified in the PPM under the conditions specified in the PPM. 27', '15\\u2003Between May 2001 and June 2002, the six MAN Engines became ready to be handed over to the shipbuilders. 28', 'As and when a particular engine was ready for handover, the first defendant conducted a field acceptance test (\u201cFAT\u201d) on that engine at the first defendant\u2019s factory in Germany. 29', 'Representatives of the Skaugen group and of the defendants were present to witness each of the six FATs. 30', 'The purpose of each FAT was to: (i) run the MAN Engine in the laboratory under the specified test conditions; (ii) measure the rate at which that particular MAN Engine consumed fuel; and (iii) verify for those present that the engine\u2019s actual fuel consumption met the contractually-stipulated specification. 31', 'The results of each FAT on each engine appeared to verify that each engine consumed fuel at a rate which was well below specification. 32', '16\\u2003Between October 2002 and October 2003, the shipbuilders duly delivered to the Skaugen group all six ships. 33', 'Each ship had a MAN Engine installed in it which the first plaintiff believed met the fuel consumption specification.', '17\\u2003Following delivery of the six ships in 2002 and 2003, a chain of entities related to the Skaugen and the GATX group owned each of the ships without noticing anything amiss with the rate at which the MAN Engines were consuming fuel. It is the plaintiffs\u2019 case that all of these owners have assigned to the plaintiffs all of their claims in misrepresentation against the defendants arising from the facts which follow. 34', '18\\u2003In May 2011, the first defendant issued a press release reporting the interim results of its investigation into \u201cpossible irregularities\u201d in the FATs conducted before handover on a broad class of marine engines produced by the first defendant over the preceding ten years. 35', 'The MAN Engine fell within one of the classes of marine engine and the FATs done on the six MAN Engines fell within the period of time. The \u201cpossible irregularity\u201d was that the first defendant\u2019s employee conducting the FAT had manipulated, while the test was ongoing, the fuel consumption figures reported by the test equipment so that the reported fuel consumption deviated in the first defendant\u2019s favour from the fuel consumption actually measured. 36', 'This manipulation took place with the knowledge of the first defendant\u2019s representative who was supervising the FAT as well as with the knowledge of the first defendant\u2019s executive board. 37', 'As the first defendant said in the press release: 38', '19\\u2003By a letter dated 25 May 2011 39', 'from the first defendant addressed generally to purchasers of the MAN Engine, the first defendant enclosed a copy of its May 2011 press release and informed the purchasers as follows: 40', 'The first defendant says that it sent this letter, including the press release, to affected customers including the first plaintiff in or about May 2011, the date which it bears. The plaintiffs say that they did not receive this letter or its enclosure until June 2012. 41', 'The plaintiffs also say that they were not aware of the May 2011 press release in May 2011, and that they did not become aware of the press release until they received a copy of it with this letter in June 2012. 42', '20\\u2003By a letter dated 31 January 2012 43', 'addressed specifically to the first plaintiff, the first defendant gave the first plaintiff an update on the results of its ongoing investigations. 44', 'The first defendant informed the first plaintiff in this letter, in effect, that there was a real possibility that the FATs on all six MAN Engines were manipulated to show that each MAN Engine met the fuel consumption specification when it actually did not. In this letter, the first defendant said: 45', 'The first defendant says that it sent this letter by ordinary mail to the first plaintiff in or around January 2012. The first defendant accepts that it did not send the letter to the first plaintiff by fax until June 2012. 46', 'The first plaintiff says that it did not receive this letter \u2013 whether by mail or by fax \u2013 until June 2012. 47', '21\\u2003In April 2012, 48', 'in June 2012 and in September 2012, 49', 'the first defendant admitted in writing to the Skaugen group that there were indications that the fuel consumption values for three of the six MAN Engines built for the Skaugen group were \u201cexternally influenced in an improper manner\u201d during the FATs.', '22\\u2003The first defendant\u2019s press release of May 2011 initiated a criminal investigation by the German public prosecutor. In March 2013, the first defendant was found liable for the regulatory offence under German law of, in effect, failing in its duty to supervise its employees and failing to have effective compliance structures in place to prevent their misconduct. The German criminal court found that there had been \u201cconsiderable manipulation\u201d of the FATs over a long period of time and that the scheme was \u201cplanned and carried out with high criminal energy using the software modules programmed especially for this purpose\u201d. 50', 'As a result of these findings, the German court fined the first defendant \u20ac8.2m. 51', '23\\u2003The plaintiffs\u2019 case in brief is that: (i) the defendants\u2019 representation to the first plaintiff in the PPM that the MAN Engine consumed fuel at a specific rate under certain specified conditions 52', 'was and is false; (ii) that the defendants made the representation either negligently or fraudulently in order to induce the first plaintiff to select the MAN Engine for installation under all six shipbuilding contracts; 53', '(iii) that the first plaintiff relied on the misrepresentation in selecting the MAN Engine for installation; and (iv) all of the owners of the six ships over the years have assigned to one or other of the plaintiffs the owners\u2019 claims for all losses caused by the misrepresentation.', '24\\u2003The defendants\u2019 case in brief is that: (i) the PPM and the FSI do not contain any actionable representation made to the first plaintiff as to the rate at which the six MAN Engines actually delivered to the shipbuilders would consume fuel; 54', '(ii) any misrepresentation made on the occasion of the FATs occurred after the first plaintiff had selected the MAN Engine under the shipbuilding contracts and therefore could not have induced the first plaintiff\u2019s decision to approve it for all six ships; 55', '(iii) the second plaintiff has no claim in its own right because it did not even exist when the representation was made and played no role in selecting the MAN Engine; 56', 'and (iv) neither plaintiff has any claim by reason of the assignments because the defendants made no representation at any time to any of the assignors. 57', '25\\u2003The plaintiffs commenced this action in January 2015 and secured leave ex parte to serve the writ on the defendants outside Singapore in March 2015. The plaintiffs relied on three limbs of Order 11: (i) on Order 11 r 1(f)(i), on the basis that their claim is founded on a tort constituted, at least in part, by an act or omission in Singapore; (ii) on Order 11 r 1(f)(ii), on the basis that their claim is founded on or for recovery of damages for damage suffered in Singapore; and (iii) on Order 11 r 1(p), on the basis that their claim is founded on a cause of action arising in Singapore. The writ was served on the first defendant in Germany in June 2015. 58', 'The first defendant entered an appearance in July 2015. The writ was served on the second defendant in Norway in September 2015. The second defendant entered an appearance in October 2015. 59', '26\\u2003The first defendant applied in August 2015 to challenge jurisdiction. The primary relief it sought was the following: (i) an order setting aside the writ; (ii) an order setting aside service of the writ out of the jurisdiction; and (iii) an order determining that this court has no jurisdiction over the plaintiffs\u2019 dispute with the first defendant. In the alternative, the first defendant sought an order staying this action on grounds of forum non conveniens. 60', 'The second defendant made a virtually identical application in November 2015 on its own behalf. 61', 'Although both defendants seek an order that the writ be set aside, neither defendant suggests any grounds to set aside the writ other than the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to bring themselves within Order 11. That aspect of the defendants\u2019 application therefore does not require independent analysis.', '27\\u2003Both defendants are represented on their applications by the same counsel and advance the same arguments.', '28\\u2003 The defendants\u2019 arguments, in brief, are as follows. First, both plaintiffs lack standing to bring this action. That is because the two plaintiffs have never owned any of the six ships, and thus did not themselves suffer any loss or damage. Second, the plaintiffs\u2019 claim is not within any of the three heads of Order 11 on which the plaintiffs rely (see [25] above). 62', 'Third, even if the plaintiffs\u2019 claim comes within one of those three heads, this case is not a proper one for service out of Singapore as required by Order 11 r 2(2) because Singapore is not clearly the appropriate forum for the trial of this action, with both Germany and Norway being more appropriate forums.', '29\\u2003The assistant registrar set aside service of the writ and the ex parte order granting the plaintiffs leave to serve the writ out of the jurisdiction. 63', 'His reasons for doing so are set out comprehensively in his grounds of decision in Skaugen. Those reasons can be summarised as follows. First, the plaintiffs\u2019 claims have sufficient merit for leave to serve out of the jurisdiction to be granted. The plaintiffs have shown that the causes of action on which they rely have been assigned to one or other of them (Skaugen at [46]). Second, the plaintiffs\u2019 claim comes within Order 11 r 1(f)(ii). They have shown that their claim is founded on damage sustained within Singapore caused by a tort \u201cwherever occurring\u201d (Skaugen at [106]). Finally, however, Singapore is not the appropriate forum for the resolution of this dispute. German law is the lex loci delicti (at [55] of Skaugen). Germany is therefore a more appropriate forum than Singapore. A German court would have the home court advantage in determining the plaintiffs\u2019 claim under German law. Moreover, a German court would not have to apply Singapore\u2019s double actionability rule, and would therefore determine the plaintiffs\u2019 claims under German law alone (at [129] and [139] of Skaugen). The double actionability rule would require a Singapore court to apply both German law and Singapore law to determine the plaintiffs\u2019 claims.', '30\\u2003The plaintiffs have appealed 64', 'against the assistant registrar\u2019s decision. The defendants too have appealed against his decision, 65', 'but only insofar as he found that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims have sufficient merit and that those claims fall within Order 11 r 1(f)(ii) of the Rules of Court. The defendants also now seek to support the assistant registrar\u2019s decision on the additional ground that the plaintiffs failed to make full and frank disclosure when they secured leave ex parte to serve the writ in this action out of the jurisdiction.'"}

A fresh debt of $29,375,000, owed to a company named Golden Cliff International Ltd (\u201cGolden Cliff\u201d), appeared similar to a loan of $25 million claimed by one Fan Kow Hin (\u201cMr Fan\u201d) in Mr Aathar\u2019s first voluntary arrangement proposal. 9', 'OUELH also clarified that its claim against Mr Aathar, listed by Mr Aathar as a contingent liability for $1.5m, was, as highlighted by OUELH in its notice of claim, estimated it to be around $35m as at 15 June 2017. 10', 'The nominee informed the creditors present that he needed more time to review the submitted documents, and adjourned the meeting to 19 October 2017. 11', '8\\u2003On 19 October 2017, the nominee provided the creditors present with his adjudication of the debts. In particular, Mr Aathar\u2019s liability to Golden Cliff was adjudicated to be $3 million. The nominee explained this was because only that amount of debt was supported by documents; there were no supporting documents for the remaining claim which originally stood over $29m. 12', 'Another point raised at the adjourned meeting pertained to separate ongoing legal proceedings brought against Mr Aathar by OUELH, one Low See Ching (\u201cMr Low\u201d) and a group of companies I refer to in these grounds of decision as \u201cthe Crest Entities\u201d. After discussion, these claims (referred to here collectively as \u201cthe Litigation Claims\u201d) were marked \u201cobjected to\u201d and the creditors allowed to vote, subject to the vote being declared invalid in the event that the objection was sustained. 13', 'The creditors then proceeded to vote on Mr Aathar\u2019s proposal. 14', '9\\u2003Mr Aathar, despite being the debtor proposing the arrangement, and notwithstanding the many queries posed by creditors, was not present at either of the creditors\u2019 meetings. 15', '10\\u2003By way of an email dated 20 October 2017, the nominee set out the results of the creditors\u2019 vote. Two sets of results were provided.

On these calculations, the threshold for approval of the voluntary arrangement procedure would be met in the first calculation at 80.13% approval, but not the second, where there would be 60% approval only. 16', '11\\u2003The nominee subsequently wrote to creditors on 25 October 2017, stating that Mr Aathar\u2019s proposal had met the threshold for approval. 17', 'At paragraph 3 of the same letter, he explained that the Litigation Claims had been marked \u201cobjected to\u201d and the representatives of the creditors under those claims had been allowed to vote, subject to their votes being subsequently declared invalid if the objection to the claim was sustained. 18', 'In his creditors\u2019 meeting report of the same date, it appeared the nominee marked the Litigation Claims as \u201cunable to determine\u201d and set the value of their votes at zero. 19', 'In these latest calculations, he included a further claim of more than $20 million by Golden Cliff for the purposes of voting. 20', '12\\u2003This formed the context for the applications for revocation of the approval obtained for Mr Aathar\u2019s voluntary arrangement. The four creditors were of the view that multiple material irregularities justified revoking the approval. That approval, in summary, was for repayment of a total debt adjudicated as $202m, 21', 'over 48 months, through an interest-free $3m loan. 22', 'The meeting was said to have approved this arrangement with an 80% majority. 23'"}

These Catalysts are chemical substances that convert certain compounds into petroleum. 2', 'In return, TPPI would pay rent in accordance with an agreed schedule in the LA, which was set to expire on 15 March 2009. 3', 'Clause 2.2 of the LA states that Nippon retains title to the Catalysts, 4', 'and cl 11.1 provides that \u201c[u]pon the termination of the Lease Term by expiration of time or otherwise, [TPPI]\u2026 shall surrender possession of the Catalysts to [Nippon] at such place in the Republic of Indonesia as [Nippon] and [TPPI] agree\u2026\u201d. 5', 'Of particular note is cl 14.2, which is an arbitration agreement clause, the salient parts of which state as follows: 6', '4\\u2003TPPI\u2019s refinery subsequently ceased operations after February 2008, and it defaulted on the rent payments under the LA. 7', 'In 2009, TPPI decided to re-commence operations of the refinery, which led Nippon and TPPI to enter into a \u201cHeads of Agreement\u201d (\u201cthe HA\u201d) to extend the LA to 31 December 2010. 8', 'The HA was stated to be valid and effective from 16 March 2008. 9', 'It had the effect of reducing the sums due and owing from TPPI in respect of the rent payments, and also introduced an amended schedule of payment. 10', 'Further, cl 7 of the HA states that all the terms and conditions of the LA are to remain in full force and effect unless expressly provided. 11', 'As is the case of the LA, cl 11 of the HA provides that any disputes arising out of or in connection with the HA would be settled amicably, failing which the dispute would be finally and exclusively settled by arbitration in Singapore. Hereinafter, the LA and the HA will be referred to collectively as \u201cthe Lease\u201d.', '5\\u2003Around December 2011, TPPI\u2019s refinery was again shut down as TPPI faced financial difficulties. 12', 'On 11 December 2012, TPPI entered into a Composition Agreement (\u201cthe CA\u201d) with various creditors, including Nippon. The CA is akin to a scheme of arrangement, 13', 'and it was endorsed by the Commercial Court of Jakarta Pusat on 27 December 2012. At that time, Nippon had a total claim of over USD$50m against TPPI. This comprised sums due and owing under the Lease, as well as rent for the Catalysts for the period from 1 January 2011 to 5 November 2012. 14', 'Pursuant to the CA, Nippon\u2019s claim against TPPI was converted into shares amounting to about 4.46% of TPPI\u2019s shares, which were issued to Nippon around 10 December 2014. 15', 'For our purposes, cl 8 of the CA is noteworthy. It provides as follows: 16', '6\\u2003In relation to this clause, Nippon and TPPI agree that there are two ways in which an agreement preceding the CA can either be resurrected or treated as subsisting. 17', 'First, if an agreement was still in force at the time that the CA was executed, and if TPPI strictly confirms that the said agreement remains in force, then the said agreement continues to bind the parties to it. Second, TPPI may re-apply an agreement that is no longer in force at the time that the CA was entered into, subject to the relevant parties\u2019 consent.', '7\\u2003After the CA was executed, Nippon and TPPI attempted but failed to conclude a new agreement for TPPI\u2019s continued use of the Catalysts. Nevertheless TPPI resumed operations and continued to use the Catalysts. Nippon claims that TPPI continued to use the Catalysts without its consent, and pursued the following causes of action against TPPI and Pertamina:', '(a)\\u2003 Conversion and\/or detinue (collectively, \u201cthe Conversion Claim\u201d): 18', 'Nippon claims that TPPI converted the Catalysts for its own use. It averred that after the expiry of the Lease on 31 December 2010, Nippon was entitled to the re-possession of the catalysts, but TPPI had unlawfully retained them from 1 January 2011 and for its own use.', '(b)\\u2003Joint tortfeasor (\u201cthe Joint Tortfeasor Claim\u201d): 19', 'Nippon claims against Pertamina as a joint tortfeasor for having authorised, procured or instigated the commission of the tort of conversion and\/or detinue by TPPI. Nippon avers in the alternative that Pertamina participated in a joint enterprise or common design in committing those torts.', '(c)\\u2003Unlawful conspiracy (\u201cthe Conspiracy Claim\u201d): 20', 'Nippon claims that TPPI and Pertamina participated in an unlawful conspiracy to take advantage of Nippon\u2019s property without providing fair value or due consideration. Nippon further avers that TPPI and Pertamina ignored Nippon\u2019s demands to cease using the Catalysts and to pay for such unauthorised use, and their continuing obligation to return the Catalysts pursuant to the Lease and\/or the CA.', '8\\u2003At this juncture, I pause to note that although Nippon alleges that TPPI is obliged to surrender possession of the Catalysts from 31 December 2010, Nippon claims damages only for losses from 6 November 2012 onwards. This is because Nippon and TPPI has settled Nippon\u2019s claim for the rental of the Catalysts from 1 January 2011 to 5 November 2012 under the CA. 21', 'In other words, the Suit concerns events that ostensibly occurred after the expiry of the Lease. As will be seen, a bone of contention between Nippon and TPPI is whether this means that Nippon\u2019s claims in the Suit fall beyond the purview of the clause enjoining them to arbitrate disputes in connection with the Catalysts.', '9\\u2003As both TPPI and Pertamina are located in Indonesia, Nippon sought and obtained an ex parte order granting it leave to serve out of jurisdiction. Subsequently, TPPI and Pertamina took out their respective applications, both of which were granted by the AR. With respect to TPPI\u2019s Arbitration Application, the AR noted that there was a prima facie case that TPPI and Nippon had treated the Lease as binding on them while they attempted to negotiate a new agreement. As for Pertamina\u2019s Jurisdiction Application, the AR found that the torts took place in Indonesia, and that Indonesia was the proper forum for hearing the dispute.', '10\\u2003Nippon has appealed against the AR\u2019s decision on both applications.

In some cases, the development of bespoke premixes required the assistance and help of \u201cexperts\u201d or food technologists. 16', 'Whilst the Plaintiff claimed to have a research and development (\u201cR&D\u201d) department, 17', 'the evidence on the scale of these activities is rather thin. On the whole, it appears more likely that the development of bespoke premixes for Thai FB&N customers frequently involved the help of the 2nd Defendant. 18', 'This is an area of evidence that I shall return to later.', '10\\u2003The FB&N products\/ingredients market in Thailand appears to be highly competitive. In particular, there are many Thai FB&N suppliers of FB&N ingredients (such as the Plaintiff) to Thai FB&N customers. In addition, there are different producers, developers and manufacturers of FB&N ingredients such as the Defendants and the DSM Group. 19', '11\\u2003It is clear that the Plaintiff and Defendants had a joint interest to facilitate the penetration of the Thai market by DSM ingredients. The Plaintiff, as a Thai company, was directly concerned with finding, maintaining and developing relationships with Thai FB&N customers. The Defendants, on the other hand, were naturally concerned and interested in the development of the Plaintiff\u2019s customer base for DSM ingredients. The Defendants participated at FB&N ingredient exhibitions in Thailand together with the Plaintiff as part of efforts to attract customers for DSM ingredients. 20', 'The Defendants also required the Plaintiff to produce regular quarterly reports on the sales performance of DSM ingredients, problems or difficulties that had been encountered, and efforts made to expand the customer base for DSM ingredients. 21', '12\\u2003On 22 October 2013, more than a decade after the commencement of the business relationship, the parties entered into a confidentiality agreement (\u201cthe Confidentiality Agreement\u201d). 22', 'I will describe the relevant provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement in greater detail later.', '13\\u2003On 10 June 2014, the 1st Defendant notified the Plaintiff of its intention to terminate the distribution arrangement. 23', 'Thereafter, the Defendants made alternative arrangements to supply DSM ingredients to Thai FB&N manufacturers using DSM ingredients in their products.', '14\\u2003The Plaintiff brought this action against the Defendants for misuse of confidential information provided by or obtained from the Plaintiff under or in connection with the distributorship arrangement between the parties.

The key amendment was to add the phrase \u201cand\/or their duty of confidence\u201d each time the Defendants\u2019 breach of the Confidentiality Agreement was pleaded. These amendments essentially concerned the prayers for relief at the end of the original statement of claim. 29', '17\\u2003The Defendants objected to the proposed amendment on the basis that a new cause of action (breach of an equitable obligation of confidence) was being added shortly before trial, and also because the proper forum for the action for misuse of confidential information outside of the Confidentiality Agreement (for example, in equity) had not been established to be that of Singapore law. The Defendants contended it had not been established that Singapore was the proper forum for a claim based in tort or equity as opposed to the Confidentiality Agreement. After hearing counsel, this Court allowed the proposed amendments to the statement of claim. 30', 'Given that the existing statement of claim had already pleaded breach of confidence at common law and in equity 31', 'and the fact that the Defendants had never objected to the action for breach of confidence being heard in Singapore, this Court allowed the proposed amendments. Whether or not the Court would need to apply or consider Thai law when determining liability outside of the Confidentiality Agreement was something to be addressed at the trial itself. That said, for reasons which will become clear, nothing turns on the amendment. Indeed, no issue arose at trial on Thai law and breach of confidence outside of the Confidentiality Agreement.', '18\\u2003Under the amended statement of claim dated 31 August 2017 (\u201cSOC 2\u201d), the Plaintiff, after setting out the obligations of confidentiality under the Confidentiality Agreement and\/or common law and equity, as well as the nature of the confidential information disclosed to the Defendants, pleads the specific breach alleged against the Defendants in SOC 2. The core complaint set out in SOC 2 was that on 1 July 2014, despite the Plaintiff\u2019s contention that the termination of the distributorship arrangement had not yet been resolved, the 1st Defendant issued the Notice to the Plaintiff\u2019s customers informing them of the change of distributorship and providing its contact details. The Plaintiff asserts that the Defendants were only able to contact the Plaintiff\u2019s customers as quickly and easily as they do because of the confidential Customer Information that had been disclosed to them. 32', '19\\u2003The Plaintiff further pleads that but for the Customer Information, the Defendants would have had to expend significant time and effort to obtain contact details of the customers, establishing a contact point and building the relationship with these customers and developing projects involving DSM nutritional products with these customers in order to sell DSM nutritional products to them. 33', '20\\u2003It follows that the unauthorised use complained of is directed at the Notice that was sent to the Thai FB&N producers who were customers for DSM ingredients obtained from the Plaintiff. The downstream consequence of the Notice as alleged was that the Defendants managed to effect the change of distributorship much more quickly and easily than would otherwise have been the case.', '21\\u2003I note that the Plaintiff also complains that the Defendants\u2019 termination of the distributorship arrangement was abrupt. 34', 'The present action, however, does not concern any alleged termination breach in that the claim is not for wrongful termination as such. 35', 'Instead, this action is solely concerned with the allegations over misuse of confidential information post-termination. Nevertheless, it will be necessary to refer to the events leading up to the termination as well as the consequences of the termination of the distribution arrangement in order to reach a decision on the complaint of misuse of confidential information.'"}

As mentioned  \nat [45] above,  in December 2016, the Represented  Defendants stated that they \nwanted the plaintiff  to appoint, and bear the cost of appointing, an expert who \nwould be able to gain access to the contents of the Old Computer.58 The plaintiff  \ntook a different  view and the parties were unable  to agree.\n54 On 8 February 2017,  the plaintiff  filed the Second Unless  Order \nApplication in respect of the Category  1(3) documents. On 1 March 2017, the \nRepresented Defendants  wrote to the Plaintiff, stating as follows:\nOur clients instruct  that they have obtained  the password  for \nthe Peachtree software  on the hard drive, and the documents \nfalling under [Category 1(3)] are now accessible  despite being \nstored in a proprietary format.\n55 Subsequently, on 6 March  2017, the Represented Defendants filed the \nFifth LOD, by which they provided discovery of the remaining Category 1(3) \n58 6th Affidavit of Sim Bee Har, 17 May 2017, p 431.\n27\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nGrande Corp Pte  Ltd v Cubix International Pte Ltd [2018]  SGHC  13\ndocuments. That same day, Ben affirmed the Affidavit Verifying  the Fifth LOD,  \nin which he stated:59\nThe documents in the [Fifth LOD] are disclosed at this time \nbecause they were contained in a hard drive  and were stored in \na format which can only be read by the Peachtree software. The \nhard drive  contained a copy of the Peachtree  software, but was \npassword-protected. We only obtained  the password from a \nformer employee on 28 February 2017,  which then allowed  us \nto access  and disclose the documents.\n56 In letters to MG Chambers  dated 19 April  2017 and 2 May 2017, \nCharacterist stated that the Represented Defendants had \u201cyet to explain who was \ntheir mysterious and unnamed \u201cemployee\u201d  who suddenly  provided the \npassword for the Peachtree program\u201d.  The plaintiff also remarked on the \n\u201cimpeccable timing\u201d  of the \u201cemployee\u201d  coming forward only after the plaintiff \nhad filed the Second Unless Order  Application.60 MG Chambers  did not, \nhowever, respond to these portions of the  letters  from Characterist.\n57 The plaintiff  wrote to court on 7 April 2017 to withdraw  the Second \nUnless Order Application on the basis that it \u201cappeared\u201d that the Represented \nDefendants had now provided discovery of the Category 1(3) documents (see \n[20] above).  However, I note that in the written  submissions for this application, \nthe plaintiff  maintains that it has only been  given  disclosure of the AXXIS \nCompanies\u2019 unaudited  general ledgers, whereas  it believes  that audited \nfinancial statements and accounts are still being suppressed. The plaintiff also \nhighlights that it has only been  given p 4 of the balance sheets, which indicates \nthat there are many  more pages  which the Represented Defendants are \nwithholding.61\n596th Affidavit of Sim Bee Har, 17 May 2017, p 481.\n60 6th Affidavit of Sim Bee Har, 17 May 2017, pp 489, 494.\n28\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nGrande Corp Pte  Ltd v Cubix International Pte Ltd [2018]  SGHC  13\n58 Again,  since  the Represented Defendants  initially took the position that \nthe Category 1(3) documents had been  destroyed  or disposed of, it is relevant \nto note Ben\u2019s latest  position in his seventeenth Affidavit that that he had made \nthe statements in his previous affidavits without being  able to recall whether  the \ndocuments requested by the plaintiff  were  thrown away, when they were thrown \naway, and who threw  them away.\nInconsistencies in  the Represented Defendants\u2019 position\n59 Before  I discuss the parties\u2019  arguments,  I pause to summarise the \nsignificant inconsistencies and variations  in the Represented Defendants\u2019 \nposition with regard to the  AXXIS documents.\n60 First, the Represented Defendants  have  taken shifting positions \nregarding when,  and by whom the documents were  destroyed. In the \n24 December  2014 Letter, it was said that the documents in Categories 1(2), \n1(3) and 1(5) were  destroyed \u201cin the first quarter  of this year when the AXXIS \nCompanies became dormant\u201d  [emphasis  added].62 This must refer to 2014, since \nthat is both (a) the year during  which the 24 December 2014 Letter was sent, \nand (b) the year when the Represented Defendants  themselves say the AXXIS \nCompanies became  dormant. However, Ben\u2019s Affidavit verifying the Third \nLOD suggests that the destruction  of documents (or at least those in \nCategory 1(2)) occurred in or around  December 2012, when the AXXIS \nCompanies closed their office premises (see  [27] above).\n61 Plaintiff\u2019s  skeletal submissions for Summons 2275\/2017, para 63.\n62 6th Affidavit of Sim Bee Har, 17 May 2017, p 166.\n29\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nGrande Corp Pte  Ltd v Cubix International Pte Ltd [2018]  SGHC  13\n61 Secondly, the Represented Defendants  have taken shifting positions \nregarding who was responsible for the destruction of the AXXIS documents. \nBen\u2019s Affidavit Verifying the Third  LOD  stated  that the Category 1(2) \ndocuments \u201cwere disposed  of by the bookkeeper,  one Ms Khoo\u201d (see [27] \nabove). Yet Ben\u2019s seventeenth Affidavit suggests that Ms Khoo  was already  \n\u201cserving her notice period\u201d sometime shortly before July 2012 (see [34] above), \nfive months before December 2012, which is the earliest of the dates on which  \nthe Represented Defendants variously  claim  the Category 1(2) documents were \ndestroyed. Finally, in Ben\u2019s seventeenth  Affidavit  and Bee\u2019s  second Affidavit, \nBen and Bee admit that they simply cannot  recall who threw  the AXXIS \ndocuments away.\n62 Thirdly, the Represented  Defendants have taken shifting positions \nregarding whether some of the documents even existed to begin with.  With \nrespect to Category 1(2),  the Represented Defendants stated  in a letter on \n25 August 2016 that there  were simply  \u201cno statements\u201d for AXXIS Pte Ltd and \nAXXIS Group.  However, in their Fourth LOD, the Represented Defendants  did \ndisclose bank statements for AXXIS Group for the period of May 2008 to \nDecember 2009.\n63 Fourthly, the Represented Defendants have taken inconsistent  positions \nregarding whether  they had any undisclosed AXXIS documents remaining in \ntheir possession, custody or control. For example, in the Affidavit Verifying the \nThird LOD dated 3 September  2015, Ben stated that the Represented \nDefendants had no more Category 1(5) documents in their possession,  custody  \nor control,  and whatever Category 1(5) documents there were had already been \ndisclosed (see [39] above).  However, on 6 September 2015, after the plaintiff \nhad filed the First Unless Order  Application,  the Represented Defendants \n30\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nGrande Corp Pte  Ltd v Cubix International Pte Ltd [2018]  SGHC  13\nsuddenly gave disclosure of 134 items under Category 1(5). Then, at the hearing \nof the First Unless Order Application on 21 November 2016, counsel for the \nRepresented Defendants stated that the Category 1(5) documents that had been \ndisclosed so far were  those  obtained by \u201creasonable efforts\u201d, and that he had \n\u201cno instructions\u201d about whether there  were any others yet to  be disclosed.\n64 At the broadest level, the most significant  shift in the Represented  \nDefendants\u2019 position is that they initially  gave the impression that Ben and Bee \nactually knew what became of the AXXIS documents, but much  later revealed \nthat this was not the case at all. In the 24 December  2014  Letter, the Represented  \nDefendants refused  disclosure on the basis that the documents  in categories  \n1(2), 1(3) and 1(5) had been thrown away.  Then, in successive affidavits, Ben \nspoke in considerable  detail about when, by whom, and for what reason they \nwere disposed of or destroyed. These  statements were made in no uncertain \nterms. None  contained the slightest indication  that Ben was unsure of what had \nhappened to the AXXIS documents,  or that he was speaking based on his \n\u201climited memory\u201d. 63 Yet in August 2017, Ben conceded in his seventeenth \nAffidavit that he cannot recall when  and by whom the documents were thrown \naway. In fact, he revealed  that he cannot  even recall whether they were  thrown \naway or destroyed  at all, or simply lost. Even  Bee, whom Ben said was \nresponsible for deciding which documents were unnecessary and could be \ndisposed of, cannot recall whether she instructed any staff to dispose of the \ndocuments. \n63 17th Affidavit of Toh Wee Ping Benjamin, 28 August 2017, para 6.\n31\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nGrande Corp Pte  Ltd v Cubix International Pte Ltd [2018]  SGHC  13\nThe parties\u2019  submissions\nThe plaintiff\u2019s submissions\n65 The plaintiff  argues that Ben, Bee and the AXXIS  Companies\u2019 defences \nshould be struck  out on three grounds. First,  a fair trial is no longer possible \nbecause the Represented Defendants have  destroyed core or essential \ndocuments:64\n(a) The Category 1(5) documents are essential  because they would \nreveal the name of the projects undertaken by the AXXIS Companies, \nwhich would allow the court to determine whether projects intended  to \nbe carried  out by C&K were in fact carried out by the AXXIS \nCompanies. The Category 1(5) documents would also reveal the \nresources used by the AXXIS  Companies to generate revenue for \nthemselves, and  whether  such resources are traceable  to C&K.65\n(b) The Category 1(3) documents are essential  because they would \nshow \u201cwhat the AXXIS Companies were  all about, and what  they did\u201d, \nincluding the AXXIS Companies\u2019 revenue,  costs and expenses, what \nassets they held,  what  liabilities they owed. This would all go towards \nestablishing whether the AXXIS Companies had misused  the resources \nof C&K.66\nThe plaintiff says that the Represented Defendants\u2019  deficiencies  in discovery \n\u201csimply cannot be remedied\u201d  and that a fair trial is \u201cobjectively not possible\u201d.67\n64 Plaintiff\u2019s  skeletal submissions for Summons 2275\/2017, paras 16\u201328.\n65 Plaintiff\u2019s  skeletal submissions for Summons 2275\/2017, paras 20\u201322.\n66 Plaintiff\u2019s  skeletal submissions for Summons 2275\/2017, para 24.\n32\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nGrande Corp Pte  Ltd v Cubix International Pte Ltd [2018]  SGHC  13\n66 Secondly, the plaintiff argues  that the defences of Ben, Bee and the \nAXXIS Companies  ought to be struck out because  the Represented  Defendants \nhave breached the Unless Order, and have  not proven that such breach was \nunintentional or a result of extraneous circumstances.68 In this regard,  the \nplaintiff highlights that AR Lim must have  granted  the Unless Order on the basis \nthat the Represented  Defendants had further  Category 1(5) documents  in their \npossession. Otherwise  she would not have  remarked that the Category 1(5) \ndocuments for the period prior to 18 December 2009 were \u201cmissing\u201d, and would \nnot have ordered the Represented  Defendants to produce  Category 1(5) \ndocuments for that period. In view of this, the plaintiff says that the Represented  \nDefendants were not entitled to simply repeat  their position in Ben\u2019s eleventh  \nAffidavit that no further Category 1(5) documents  were in their possession, \ncustody and control because  they had been \u201cthrown away\u201d.69 The plaintiff  \nfurther argues that if the Represented  Defendants  had truly disposed of the \nCategory 1(5) documents for 2008 and 2009, such disposal was \u201cdeliberate and \nselective, to prevent the [plaintiff] from having  access to such core and essential \ndocuments.\u201d70 The plaintiff also submits that the Represented Defendants have \nbreached the Unless Order because the Peachtree  Directory discloses further  \ndocuments falling under both Category  1(3) and Category  1(5), but the \nRepresented Defendants had failed to disclose such documents until Ben filed \nthe Affidavit Verifying  the Fifth  LOD  on 6 March 2017.71\n67 Plaintiff\u2019s  skeletal submissions for Summons 2275\/2017, para 27.\n68 Plaintiff\u2019s  skeletal submissions for Summons 2275\/2017, para 29.\n69 Plaintiff\u2019s  skeletal submissions for Summons 2275\/2017, paras 35\u201340.\n70 Plaintiff\u2019s  skeletal submissions for Summons 2275\/2017, para 40.\n71 Plaintiff\u2019s  skeletal submissions for Summons 2275\/2017, para 46.\n33\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nGrande Corp Pte  Ltd v Cubix International Pte Ltd [2018]  SGHC  13\n67 The plaintiff  also argues that the Represented Defendants breached the \nUnless Order not only with regard  to the Category  1(5) documents but also with \nregard to Category 1(2). AR Lim had ordered that the Represented Defendants \nwere to \u201cexplain why the HSBC bank documents had only emerged  later\u201d, and \nto \u201cexplain why the enquiries to HSBC  bank were not made any earlier\u201d. \nHowever, the explanation given in Ben\u2019s eleventh Affidavit \u201ccompletely \nmisse[d] the point and is irrelevant and mischievous\u201d.72 On this basis, the \nplaintiff says that the Represented Defendants failed to comply with the Unless \nOrder.\n68 Thirdly, the plaintiff  argues  that Ben, Bee and the AXXIS Companies\u2019  \ndefences should be struck out because  the Represented Defendants  are in \ncontumelious breach of their discovery  obligations. In this regard, the plaintiff  \nsays that the Represented  Defendants  have  shown a pattern of making  only \n\u201cincomplete\u201d disclosure  of the documents in each category, taking inconsistent \nand changing positions,  lying about the existence of documents, and acting to \ndisclose documents only when they are forced  to do so by the plaintiff\u2019s \napplications for specific  discovery and unless orders.73\nBen and Bee\u2019s submissions\n69 Although the plaintiff is also seeking  to strike out the defences  of the \nAXXIS Companies, as I have  mentioned (see [9] above), only Ben and Bee \nwere represented at  the hearing  of this application.\n72 Plaintiff\u2019s  skeletal submissions for Summons 2275\/2017, para 55.\n73 Plaintiff\u2019s  skeletal submissions for Summons 2275\/2017, paras 62\u201379.\n34\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nGrande Corp Pte  Ltd v Cubix International Pte Ltd [2018]  SGHC  13\n70 Ben and Bee argue that the plaintiff  is attempting to avoid  a full trial of"}

They are also canvassed in the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision on liability in Eng Chiet Shoong and others v Cheong Soh Chin and others and another appeal [2016] 4 SLR 728 (\u201cEng Chiet Shoong (CA)\u201d). It therefore suffices for me to set out the background to this dispute briefly.', '6\\u2003The plaintiffs are the Wees, a family of high net worth individuals. The first plaintiff, Cheong Soh Chin, is the mother of the second and third plaintiffs, Wee Boo Kuan and Wee Boo Tee. The first and second defendants, Eng Chiet Shoong and Sylvia Lee, are husband and wife. They are experienced asset managers. The third defendant, C S Partners Pte Ltd (\u201cCSP\u201d), is a company incorporated by Ms Lee to provide \u201cintegrated services to families on wealth protection and wealth creation\u201d. I shall refer to all three defendants collectively as \u201cthe Engs\u201d.', '7\\u2003In early 2004, the parties agreed to combine their capital and financial expertise in a project they called the \u201cWWW Concept\u201d. The WWW Concept was intended to be a long-term and profitable collaboration for the Wees and the Engs. Under this concept, it was envisaged that the parties would find fledgling private equity (\u201cPE\u201d) fund managers and provide them with seed capital to start new PE funds in which the parties would also invest. They would then participate in the fund managers\u2019 profits and also in the funds\u2019 profits.', '8\\u2003The first step in the WWW Concept was for the parties to build a track record for themselves, in order to attract fledgling hedge fund managers. To do this, the Wees and the Engs decided to set up their own PE fund. This PE fund was to be a fund of funds, ie a fund which would invest its capital in other funds. The plan was that the Wees would provide the necessary capital for the initial PE fund and the Engs would provide the financial expertise. Once the PE fund had a good track record, it would become the first fund under the WWW Concept.', '9\\u2003Subsequently, in 2004 and 2005, the Wees invested US$30m in five PE funds (\u201cInitial PE Funds\u201d) and another US$100m in ten additional funds (\u201cAdditional PE Funds\u201d). The Wees agreed to pay the Engs a management fee of 1.5% in respect of the Initial PE Funds. There was no similar agreement with respect to the Additional PE Funds.', '10\\u2003In addition to investing their capital in these PE funds, the Wees also invested capital in five ventures which the Engs introduced to them. The ventures are known as Project Plaza, Project Sailfish, Project Red Spot, the Bahamas Fund, and the Kendall Court Fund.', '11\\u2003The Wees\u2019 investments in the PE Funds and in these five ventures were held through a network of 24 special purpose vehicles (\u201cSPVs\u201d). Although these vehicles were established and maintained with the Wees\u2019 funds, all of the vehicles were set up and controlled by the Engs.', '12\\u2003The relationship between the parties deteriorated and eventually broke down. In April 2012, the Wees brought this action against the Engs. The Wees sought, among other things, orders requiring the Engs to render an account and to return the assets which the Wees had entrusted to them. The Engs brought a counterclaim against the Wees for fees and expenses incurred in managing and administering the Wees\u2019 investments.', '13\\u2003In Cheong Soh Chin (HC), I allowed the Wees\u2019 claim, holding that the Engs were indeed liable to account to the Wees and to pay to the Wees the sums which the account showed were due. I dismissed the bulk of the Engs\u2019 counterclaim, holding that the parties were not in the relationship of a service provider and client but were instead joint risk runners working together towards the WWW Concept (at [69]). I did, however, hold that the Engs were entitled to management fees of US$450,000 per annum for the Initial PE Funds. Accordingly, I ordered the Wees to pay these management fees up to the date that the Engs transferred the structures holding these funds to the Wees (at [77]\u2013[78]).', '14\\u2003As for the Additional PE Funds, I held that the Engs were not entitled to any management fees at all (at [81]). I held that there was no express or implied agreement that the Engs would be paid fees for the Additional PE Funds (at [83]). Additionally, I held that the Additional PE Funds were part of the WWW Concept and that the Engs had rendered their services in the expectation that they would be compensated for those services out of the eventual profits of the WWW Concept, if it succeeded. I therefore rejected the Engs\u2019 claim that they were entitled to an award of fees on a quantum meruit (at [86]\u2013[87]).', '15\\u2003I also rejected the Engs\u2019 claim for management fees and expenses for Project Plaza, both in contract and on a quantum meruit (at [96]\u2013[106]). I held that the Engs were risk runners with respect to Project Plaza also, and that they expected to be compensated for their services and expenses but never took steps to negotiate and agree that compensation with the Wees. I held further that the parties had no overarching agreement under which the Wees were to meet all of the expenses incurred by the Engs in connection with Project Plaza (at [98]\u2013[99]).', '16\\u2003Lastly, I rejected the Engs\u2019 claim for breakup and facilitation fees. I found that the Wees never agreed to pay any such fees to the Engs (at [93]\u2013[94]). I also rejected the Engs\u2019 claim for approximately US$320,000 for work done administering the Wees\u2019 other investments partly on the basis there was no evidence to suggest that any such work was actually done (at [107]).', '17\\u2003There was no appeal against my decision on the Wees\u2019 claim. But both parties appealed my decision on the Engs\u2019 counterclaim. The Engs appealed my dismissal of their counterclaim. The Wees appealed my order that they pay management to the Engs fees for the Initial PE Funds beyond the date on which they demanded the transfer of the PE Funds.', '18\\u2003The Court of Appeal allowed the Wees\u2019 appeal on the counterclaim. It held that the Wees had to pay management fees only up to the date on which the Wees demanded the transfer, plus a period of reasonable notice. The court took into account the payments that the Wees had already made to the Engs between 2005 and 2009 and ordered the Wees to pay management fees for three further annual periods of 2009-2010, 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 (at [103]\u2013[105]).', '19\\u2003The Court of Appeal dismissed the Engs\u2019 appeal on the counterclaim in all respects save in relation to Project Plaza. The Court of Appeal reversed my finding that Project Plaza fell within the WWW Concept (at [62]) and held instead that the Engs were entitled to be paid A$2m for work done on Project Plaza on a quantum meruit (at [86] and [92]).', '20\\u2003In all other respects, the Engs\u2019 appeal failed and the Court of Appeal left my findings in Cheong Soh Chin (HC) undisturbed (at [93]):'"}

The defendant has recounted several proceedings in its written submissions.

The Engines Contract (concluded on 12 January 2007) and the Propellers Contract (concluded on 10 May 2007) are collectively referred to herein as \u201cthe Contracts\u201d. The contracting parties to the Contracts were initially Man Diesel A\/S (\u201cMAN Denmark\u201d) and Skaugen Norway. It is not in dispute that the plaintiff became a party to the Contracts following a merger with MAN Denmark. As for the defendant, it took over the Contracts as assignee of all rights and obligations from Skaugen Norway.', '11\\u2003The Engines Contract was the first time the parties had sold and bought 2-stroke engines. Under the Engines Contract, the defendant purchased four 2-stroke engines that were to be delivered in two tranches: the first two engines (Engines 1 and 2) in 2008, and the second two engines (Engines 3 and 4) in 2009. As agreed, plaintiff had the right to sub-contract the production of the engines to a South Korean licensee, STX Engine Co Ltd (\u201cSTX Engine\u201d). Like the Engines Contract, the Propellers Contract provided for delivery of four propellers purchased by the defendant in two tranches: the first two propellers (Propellers 1 and 2) in 2008, and the second two propellers (Propellers 3 and 4) in 2009. However, unlike the engines, the propellers were to be built directly by the plaintiff.', '12\\u2003The four engines and propellers were intended for installation on board four of the defendant\u2019s LNPG carriers; each engine was to interface with a propeller, and the engine-propeller combinations were referred to as shipsets.', '13\\u2003In 2008, the defendant took delivery and paid for the first two of the four shipsets (Shipsets 1 and 2). The two shipsets were subsequently, in 2011, installed on board two of the defendant\u2019s LNPG carriers, the Norgas Unikum and the Bahrain Vision. To this end, it is not disputed that the parties performed the Contracts for Shipsets 1 and 2. As regards Shipsets 3 and 4, what transpired is that the defendant made several attempts at postponing the delivery of the remaining shipsets.', '14\\u2003Separately, technical problems arose in relation to Engines 1 and 2. The technical problems related to: (a) faulty chain drives; (b) abnormal piston ring and cylinder liner wear; and (c) abnormal and heavy vibrations. A further issue arose when irregularities relating to the Factory Acceptance Tests (\u201cFATs\u201d) on the plaintiff\u2019s 4-stroke marine diesel engines came to light in 2011. The FATs results showed that its 4-stroke engines have had a lower fuel consumption rate than contractually warranted. In 2013, the Local Court of Augsburg in Germany fined the plaintiff for violation of the supervisory duties imposed by the German Regulatory Offences Act. This led the defendant to mount a case that the plaintiff\u2019s manipulations of its 4-stroke engines FATs extended to the 2-stroke engines.', '15\\u2003The relationship between the parties deteriorated in 2012. The defendant attributed the breakdown in relationship to some of the technical issues (see [14] above) that affected the performance of the Norgas Unikum and the Bahrain Vision, and the plaintiff\u2019s bad aftersales performance including the loss of trust in the plaintiff due to the FATs irregularities (ie, the manipulation of fuel consumption tests in relation to the 4-stroke engines). To the plaintiff, the defendant had simply lost interest in Shipsets 3 and 4 as a result of the 2008 global crisis which affected the shipping industry and instead viewed the defendant\u2019s adoption of the fuel irregularities as an excuse to get out of the Contracts with the plaintiff. Negotiations between the parties continued but ended without reaching an amicable settlement.'"}

{"casename":"2018_SGHC_135","fact":"The background to the offence has been  set out in detail  in Public \nProsecutor v BPK [2018]  SGHC  34 (\u201cthe  Judgment\u201d) and I will not repeat  it \nhere. There, issues relating to the Accused\u2019s capacity to form mens rea at the \nmaterial time,  his factual intention at that time, and the partial defence of \nprovocation have  also been discussed. For reasons stated in the Judgment, I \nfound that the Prosecution had proven the Charge  beyond a reasonable  doubt \nand that the partial defence of provocation  was not made out.  \n3 On 30 April  2018, having heard  the parties\u2019 submissions, I sentenced the \nAccused to 14 years\u2019 imprisonment and six strokes of the cane. The term of \nimprisonment was backdated  to 21 December 2013. These are my grounds of \ndecision. For ease of reference, I adopt the abbreviations used in the Judgment.\nSubmissions on sentence\n4 The Prosecution urged the Court to impose a sentence  of at least \n14 years\u2019 imprisonment and six strokes of the  cane, based on the following: \n(a) The paramount sentencing considerations  in this case were \ndeterrence, both general  and specific, as well as retribution.1 In \nparticular, general  deterrence  was needed for offences such as the \npresent which was committed in anger and out of vengeance.2\n(b) There were several aggravating  factors  including that:\n(i) the offence was premeditated;3\n1 Prosecution\u2019s Submissions at para 8. \n2 Prosecution\u2019s Further  Submissions  at paras 11\u201314. \n3 Prosecution\u2019s Submissions at paras 19\u201320. \n2\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v BPK [2018]  SGHC  135\n(ii) the offence was committed in a public  place and caused  \npublic disquiet;4\n(iii) the assault was particularly vicious and violent;5 and \n(iv) the assault had long term implications on the Victim\u2019s  \nwell-being.6\n(c) As a matter of precedent,  the present case warranted a heavier \nsentence than that imposed in Public Prosecutor v Ravindran \nAnnamalai [2013] SGHC  77 (\u201cRavindran\u201d),7 which was to date the only \ncase under s 307(1) of the PC since the amendment of the provision in \n2007. In this regard, cases under s 304( a) of the PC for culpable \nhomicide not amounting  to murder were not appropriate precedents.8\n(d) The sentence urged was justifiable  based on the Prosecution\u2019s  \nproposed sentencing framework for  attempted  murder.9\n5 The Defence submitted that the appropriate sentence was no more  than \neight years\u2019  imprisonment10 with no caning, or alternatively, not more  than two \nstrokes of  the cane.11 The following main arguments were made: \n(a) Deterrence, whether  general or specific, did not have  a role in \nthe present  case.

A is liable to punishment under this section.\n(b) A, with intention  of causing the death  of a child of tender \nyears, throws the child into a river. A has committed the offence \ndefined by this section,  although the death  of the child does not \nensue.\n(c) A, intending to murder Z, buys a gun and loads it. A has not \nyet committed  the offence. A fires the gun at Z. He has \ncommitted the offence  defined in this section; and if by such \nfiring he wounds Z, he is liable to the punishment  provided by \nthe latter part of this section.\n(d) A, intending  to murder Z by poison,  purchases poison and \nmixes the same with food which  remains in A\u2019s keeping; A has \nnot yet committed the offence defined in this section. A places \nthe food on Z\u2019s table or delivers it to Z\u2019s servants to place it on \nZ\u2019s table. A has committed the offence  defined  in this section. \n7 As I observed  in the Judgment at [322], s 307(1) of the PC has two limbs. \nThe first limb provides  that for attempted murder  simpliciter, the accused  \u201cshall \n20 Defence\u2019s Submissions  at paras 35\u201336.\n5\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v BPK [2018]  SGHC  135\nbe punished with imprisonment for a term which  may extend  to 15 years, and \nshall also be liable  to fine\u201d. The second  limb provides  that for attempted murder \ncausing hurt, the accused \u201cshall be liable to either imprisonment  for life, or to \nimprisonment for a term which may extend to 20 years, and shall also be liable \nto caning or fine or both\u201d. In the present case, the Charge was brought  and the \nAccused was  convicted  under the second limb of s 307(1) of the PC. \nSentencing considerations\n8 In my judgment, the paramount  sentencing  considerations in the present  \ncase were  general  deterrence and retribution.  \n9 Specific deterrence was not totally irrelevant. The Prosecution \nsubmitted that an enhanced sentence accounting for specific deterrence was \nnecessary for the following reasons:21 \n(a) It is necessary to remind the Accused that using violence out of \nanger and for vengeance would not be condoned. \n(b) The Accused had admitted at several instances in his police \nstatements that  he had wanted to kill the Victim. \n(c) The Accused\u2019s belief that the Victim owed him fidelity \n\u201cexpose[d] his perverse  sense of entitlement\u201d.  \n10 I agreed that the first reason  was a factor  to be taken into account.  While \nit was true that the Accused\u2019s strong feelings  had arisen out of his romantic \nrelationship with the Victim, this was not to say that he would never have  \nanother romantic relationship or be in a situation where his strong emotions may \n21 Prosecution\u2019s Submissions at para 15.\n6\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v BPK [2018]  SGHC  135\nagain be stirred. That said, insofar as the Accused was not a local citizen  or \npermanent resident, he would likely be repatriated at the end of his sentence, \nand this militated against giving paramount consideration to specific deterrence \n(see Zhao  Zhipeng v Public Prosecutor [2008]  4 SLR(R)  879 at [28]). As for \nthe second  reason, the Accused\u2019s admissions in his statements were evidential \npoints with little, if any, relevance to sentencing.  I also did not agree that the \nAccused by desiring  fidelity from the Victim (whether rightly  or wrongly) could \nbe characterised as having a \u201cperverse sense of entitlement\u201d, or that such \nentitlement would in itself warrant a sentence  for specific deterrence. In the \nbroader context,  it was not shown  that the Accused  was recalcitrant  or had a \nhigher propensity for reoffending. Thus, specific  deterrence, while  relevant, was \nnot a paramount sentencing  consideration.  \n11 General deterrence was necessary to send the important  signal that the \nlaw would not condone violence as a solution to problems, however personal \nthey may be, and however angry or justified  one might feel. The Defence  argued \nthat in Singapore it was \u201cnot a common phenomenon  that someone will murder \nhis or her lover whenever there is love failure\u201d.22 It was not clear that violent \ncrimes arising out of lovers\u2019 disputes were  as uncommon as assumed by the \nDefence. In any event, the focus here was on the law\u2019s  expectation of \nself-restraint even in moments of grave  anger  and in relation to disputes  of a \npersonal nature, and this reminder was relevant to more than just the Accused. \nAs the Court of"}

As a result of this apparent redundancy, the director with a connection to the Respondent suggested that the Company be shut down to avoid compliance with regulatory requirements. The Applicant and the other director agreed to the suggestion and an application to have the Company struck off the registered was made thereafter. As it transpired, there remains an outstanding sum purportedly owed by the Respondent to Tuff. The Respondent asserts that the only relevant contract was between the Respondent and the Company and thus owed Tuff nothing.

Both ST Vegas Co and ST Vegas Enterprise are managed by Mr Xaysana Xaysoulivong (\u201cMr Xaysana\u201d), one of Mr Sithat\u2019s sons. Mr Xaysana has filed affidavits on behalf of the two entities and they were used in these proceedings.', '9\\u2003Sanum was, back in 2007, looking for business opportunities in Lao. Based on certain recommendations given by other business associates and Lao government officials, Sanum got in touch with the Lao disputants. According to Sanum, the Lao disputants lacked the resources to develop successfully its gaming enterprises and for this reason, needed a joint venture partner. As a result, Sanum and the Lao disputants negotiated and entered into a joint venture arrangement whereby Sanum would eventually come to hold 60% of all present and future gaming businesses of the joint venture. This arrangement was embodied in an agreement dated 30 May 2007 referred to by the parties as the Master Agreement. The Master Agreement has, at times, been indicated to be dated 31 May 2007, nothing turns on this difference. The date used in this judgment is the 30 May 2007 as this appears to be the date commonly adopted by the parties. As an aside, the problem with dates used to mark various documents and to describe different events plague this case. However, given the analysis in this judgment, nothing turns on these differences.', '10\\u2003The Master Agreement envisioned that there would be three joint ventures created to hold and develop certain properties. Two of the joint ventures concerned the running of casinos whereas the third joint venture concerned the operation of slot clubs: (a) Savannahkhet Casino Joint Venture; (b) Paksong\/Champasak Casino Joint Venture; and (c) Slot Club Joint Venture. Separate agreements known as participation agreements may have to be prepared for each of these joint ventures. As regards the Slot Club Joint Venture, the relevant slot clubs referred to in the Master Agreement are the slot clubs at the \u201cLao border at Lao Bao\u201d and the \u201cSavannakhet\/Daesaven checkpoint\u201d (also referred to by the parties as the Lao Bao Slot Club and Ferry Terminal Slot Club).', '11\\u2003To execute the joint venture for two slot clubs, Sanum subsequently entered into a participation agreement with ST Vegas Enterprise on 6 August 2007 (\u201cParticipation Agreement between Sanum and ST Vegas Enterprise\u201d) which indicated that the joint venture was to carry on for a term of 50 years.', '12\\u2003There is a third slot club named the Thanaleng Slot Club. This slot club was not treated as immediately part of the Slot Club Joint Venture. This is because there were existing third party machine owners already involved in the Thanaleng Slot Club at the time the Master Agreement was concluded. However, the Master Agreement envisaged Sanum taking over the Thanaleng Slot Club upon the termination of the third party machine owners\u2019 contracts (referred to by the parties as the \u201cturnover\u201d of the Thanaleng Slot Club). Mr Xaysana\u2019s affidavit states the termination dates of these contracts as follows: (a) the contract with RGB Ltd, ending on 10 October 2011; (b) the contract with IndoPacific Gaming Australia Pty Ltd, ending on 31 March 2010; and (c) Thaimac Export-Import Pty Ltd, ending on 26 November 2007. The \u201cturnover\u201d of the Thanaleng Slot Club is given effect to in Clause 1(3)(d) of the Master Agreement. Given the language of Clause 1(3)(d), the \u201cturnover\u201d date would coincide with the expiry of the RGB Ltd contract. There is an inconsistency between the termination date of the RGB Ltd contract as stated by Mr Xaysana and in the Temporary Thanaleng Participation Agreement; the latter indicating that the RGB contract was to terminate on 11 October 2011 (see [14] below). For the purposes of the hearing, Mr Yeo used 11 October 2011 as the \u201cturnover\u201d date under the Master Agreement.

Hence, it was agreed that Sanum would provide additional slot machines to the Thanaleng Slot Club, and that the revenue generated from these machines was to be shared in accordance with certain agreed percentages: 40% to ST Vegas Co and 60% to Sanum. The Temporary Thanaleng Participation Agreement contained a clause stating that 11 October 2011 was the termination date of the agreement. As alluded to earlier, the clause also stated that the termination date of the RGB Ltd contract date is 11 October 2011.', '15\\u2003There are two other agreements in relation to the Thanaleng Slot Club. The first agreement, dated 23 February 2010, was for the expansion of the slot club to an adjacent piece of land which included a building used for the purposes of duty-free sales (\u201cFirst Expansion Agreement\u201d). This agreement was entered into between Sanum and ST Group, who owned the rights to the land. The second agreement, dated 16 November 2010, was for the construction of an additional facility to further expand the Thanaleng Slot Club (\u201cSecond Expansion Agreement\u201d). This agreement was entered into between Sanum, ST Group and ST Vegas Co. The Second Expansion Agreement, notably, included a clause which stated that the Thanaleng Slot Club and the various expansions to the club were to be operated as \u201cone slot club in accordance with the provisions of the [Temporary Thanaleng Participation Agreement] and the Master Agreement\u201d, unless provided for otherwise. The Second Expansion Agreement also contained a clause which stated that the participating percentage will change from 40-60 to 60-40, in favour of Sanum on the occurrence of stipulated events. This change in ratio is supposed to be consistent with the eventual ownership ratio in the Master Agreement.', '16\\u2003The Temporary Thanaleng Agreement, First and Second Expansion Agreements will hereinafter be collectively referred to as the Thanaleng Documents. To sum up, the five agreements mentioned above \u2013 namely, the Master Agreement, the Participation Agreement between Sanum and ST Vegas Enterprise, and the Thanaleng Documents \u2013 form the contractual backdrop of the underlying dispute (\u201cFive Agreements\u201d).', '17\\u2003The underlying dispute between Sanum and the Lao disputants concerned the turnover of the Thanaleng Slot Club. As 11 October 2011 approached, Sanum was informed that the expiration of the RGB Ltd contract was on 12 April 2012 and not 11 October 2011. On 11 April 2012, ST Vegas Co informed Sanum that it considered all the agreements relating to the Thanaleng Slot Club between the parties to be terminated. On 12 April 2012, ST Vegas Co shut down the Thanaleng Slot Club, closed its doors, and refused to allow Sanum access to the club.', '18\\u2003Sanum soon after commenced arbitral proceedings before the Lao Organisation of Economic Dispute Resolution (\u201cOEDR\u201d) (referred in the Master Agreement as the Resolution of Economic Dispute Organization). The initial OEDR petition named ST Group and ST Vegas Co as \u201cpetitioned parties\u201d. According to the Lao disputants\u2019 submissions, the OEDR proceedings thereafter concluded on or around 21 May 2012, with the OEDR dismissing the claim filed by Sanum. Subsequently, on 11 June 2012, ST Vegas Co commenced proceedings against Sanum in the Vientiane People\u2019s Commercial Court, seeking inter alias, a declaration that the Temporary Thanaleng Participation Agreement had expired and that the parties no longer owed any obligations to each other in relation to the Thanaleng Slot Club. In response, Sanum filed a defence and counterclaim on 25 June 2012 which named ST Vegas Co, ST Group, Mr Sithat and Xaya Construction Company Ltd (whom the Award was not made against, see [19] below) as defendants in the counterclaim. On 26 July 2012, Sanum\u2019s counterclaim was dismissed and ST Vegas Co\u2019s claim was affirmed. Dissatisfied, Sanum appealed: first to the Court of Appeal, and then to the People\u2019s Supreme Court. On both appeals, Sanum lost. On the 4 April 2014, judgment was handed down by the Supreme Court. It held that the Temporary Thanaleng Participation Agreement had been terminated on 11 October 2011.', '19\\u2003Sanum subsequently commenced arbitration seeking damages for breaches of the Master Agreement, and the Participation Agreement between Sanum and ST Vegas Enterprise (\u201cthe SIAC Arbitration\u201d). The SIAC Arbitration was initially brought against the Lao disputants and two others, Xaya Construction Co Ltd and Mr Xaysana. Sanum eventually consented to dismissing Xaya Construction Co Ltd and Mr Xaysana from the arbitral proceedings and as a result, the Award was made only against the Lao disputants.', '20\\u2003The Lao disputants, at all material times, objected to the SIAC Arbitration and did not participate in its proceedings; contending that they did not agree to the SIAC Arbitration. The Lao disputants also questioned Sanum\u2019s decision to commence arbitration at the SIAC; highlighting that according to Clause 2(10) of the Master Agreement, \u201cthe Parties shall arbitrate their dispute using an internationally recognised mediation arbitration [sic] Company in Macau, SAR PRC\u201d, among other things. 1', 'The SIAC noted these objections and informed the parties on 24 November 2015 that it was prima facie satisfied that a valid arbitration under the SIAC Rules existed and requested the Lao disputants to nominate an arbitrator. Having had regard to Clause 19 of the Participation Agreement between Sanum and ST Vegas Enterprise, the SIAC proceeded on the basis that the parties have agreed to a three-member tribunal. In the absence of the Lao disputants\u2019 having nominated of an arbitrator, the SIAC informed the parties that, pursuant to Rule 9.1 of the SIAC Rules 2013, the SIAC would proceed to appoint all the tribunal members. On 20 January 2016, the parties were notified by the SIAC of the appointment of the tribunal, which constituted the following members: Mr Michael Lee as the presiding arbitrator, Mr David Laurence Kreider and Mr Kap-You (Kevin) Kim as co-arbitrators.', '21\\u2003The Award was rendered on 22 August 2016. The Award found in favour of Sanum and made certain orders against the Lao disputants. The tribunal found that the Five Agreements were to be read together in order to determine the intentions of the parties in relation to the Thanaleng Slot Club and held that the Lao disputants had \u201cbreached the [Five Agreements] \u2026 insofar as they concerned the Thanaleng Slot Club\u201d. 2', 'The Lao disputants were therefore liable to pay loss of profits as a result of their failure to \u201cturnover\u201d the Thanaleng Slot Club, amongst other things. This loss was calculated on estimated profits over what the tribunal found to be the remaining term of a 50-year joint venture.', '22\\u2003In ruling on its own jurisdiction, the tribunal accepted that the underlying dispute arose out of the Master Agreement and the Participation Agreement between Sanum and ST Vegas Enterprise. In doing so, the tribunal relied on the two dispute resolution clauses found in the respective agreements to found jurisdiction. The tribunal took the view that \u201cthe Master Agreement and the [Participation Agreement between Sanum and ST Vegas Enterprise] must be construed together in the light of the parties\u2019 intention\u201d. 3', '23\\u2003Clause 2(10) of the Master Agreement states as follows:', '24\\u2003Clause 19 of the Participation Agreement between Sanum and ST Vegas Enterprise states as follows:', '25\\u2003The Thanaleng Documents do not contain any dispute resolution clause.', '26\\u2003In considering whether the Lao disputants agreed to the SIAC Arbitration, the tribunal noted that the named contracting parties of the Master Agreement and the Participation Agreement between Sanum and ST Vegas Enterprise differed: 4', '27\\u2003In terms of the Master Agreement, the tribunal stated that the agreement was between Sanum, ST Group and ST Vegas Co. Specifically, in respect of Mr Sithat, the tribunal observed that he signed the Master Agreement \u201cas an individual\u201d. In terms of the Participation Agreement between Sanum and ST Vegas Enterprise, the tribunal appeared to accept that ST Vegas Enterprise and Sanum were contracting parties. Despite the differences in the named parties in the various agreements, the tribunal eventually arrived at the conclusion that it had \u201cjurisdiction to determine Sanum\u2019s claims against ST Group, ST Vegas, S.T. Vegas Enterprise and [Mr Sithat], all of whom were signatories to the Master Agreement or the [Participation Agreement between Sanum and ST Vegas Enterprise]\u201d. 5', '28\\u2003While not made apparent under the section on jurisdiction, the tribunal, in a later part of the Award, appeared to take the view that little significance ought to be attached to the different names found in the various agreements: 6', 'The tribunal accepted the evidence of Sanum\u2019s witness that as part of the business culture in Lao, families frequently use different companies when entering into business dealings. Ultimately, the companies and the family should be viewed as a whole; an enterprise all by itself.', '29\\u2003As regards the seat of the arbitration, Sanum had in the amended notice of arbitration (dated 22 September 2015) and in the statement of claim (dated 21 April 2016) said that \u201ccombining and reconciling\u201d the Master Agreement and the Participation Agreement between Sanum and ST Vegas Enterprise, the seat of arbitration was Macau. Sanum\u2019s counsel in her letter dated 23 October 2015 to the SIAC in response to certain objections to the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction also stated that, \u201cthis arbitration has been instituted in an internationally recognized arbitration forum, SIAC, with the designation of the seat in Macau\u201d. 7', 'During the SIAC arbitration hearing, Sanum\u2019s counsel changed the position taken on Macau as the seat and told the tribunal that Sanum had no objections to the seat being Singapore and added that the \u201cweight of evidence suggests that [the seat] is indeed Singapore\u201d. 8', 'The tribunal appears to have accepted the lawyer\u2019s suggestion on the weight of evidence, and held that Singapore was the seat of the arbitration without actually identifying the evidence in question. The tribunal was in effect relying on Clause 19 of the Participation Agreement between Sanum and ST Vegas Enterprise. It came to the view that Clause 19 \u201camplifies and supplements the dispute resolution procedure set out in the Master Agreement\u201d: 9', '30\\u2003The tribunal also addressed the multi-tiered nature of the clauses and whether the necessary steps have been taken prior to the commencement of the SIAC Arbitration (see [86] below).'"}
{"casename":"2018_SGHC_142","fact":"'6\\u2003In 1988, Mr Sia was an engineer with the Public Utilities Board, while Mr Yong was a project manager and electrical engineer of a supplier to the Public Utilities Board. Mr Yong was 14 years younger than Mr Sia. They met in the course of work, and became close friends. From sometime in 2003, they became business partners in a business known as S&Y M&E Consultants. Separately, Mr Sia owned a business known as Zhi Pin Enterprise, 1', 'while Mr Yong owned two businesses, a real estate agency and a maid agency. 2', '7\\u2003Sometime in 2009, Mr Sia became estranged from his family. It was not disputed that for certain periods from 2010 to 2012, Mr Sia stayed with Mr Yong and his family. During this time, apart from suffering from mental illness, including depression, Mr Sia was diagnosed with prostate cancer.', '8\\u2003Sometime in early June 2012, Mr Sia moved out of Mr Yong\u2019s home. Three years later, Mr Sia commenced the action which concerns events that occurred between 2010 to 2012. By then, Mr Sia was a man of little means. To pursue the action, he sought and was granted legal aid. Before he commenced the action, Mr Sia made a statutory declaration on 19 June 2015, setting out material facts in support of his claims. 3', '9\\u2003In the Statement of Claim, it was pleaded that Mr Sia started to stay with his friends to avoid any form of contact with his family. After he began staying with Mr Yong and his family in July 2010, Mr Yong denied Mr Sia\u2019s family access to Mr Sia. Mr Sia lost contact with his family members. In June 2012, Mr Sia managed to complain to his sister about Mr Yong controlling his life, and keeping his identity card and bank cards. He also complained that Mr Yong intended to bring him to China. With the help of his family members, Mr Sia managed to move out of Mr Yong\u2019s home. 4', '10\\u2003At this juncture, I should observe that the Statement of Claim is somewhat confusing. It contains allegations ranging from undue influence, fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of trust, breach of implied terms, conversion, as well as monies had and received. It also prays for a range of reliefs. I would think that the Statement of Claim may require amendments in due course, so as to provide more clarity in the action.', '11\\u2003Be that as it may, in the main, Mr Sia alleged that during his stay with Mr Yong, Mr Yong had exercised \u201cgreat influence and control over [him]\u201d, and \u201cwas able to persuade and\/or induce [him] to carry out certain acts and\/or actions for various reasons which included safekeeping and\/or investing [Mr Sia\u2019s] assets\/investments\/monies or grant loans to [Mr Yong] for [Mr Yong\u2019s] maid agency business.\u201d 5', '12\\u2003Broadly, these acts carried out by Mr Sia fell into two categories:', '(a)\\u2003First, Mr Sia claimed that from 21 June 2010 to 22 March 2012, a total sum of $1,192,090.80 had been transferred from Mr Sia to Mr Yong. 6', 'This happened after Mr Sia was persuaded to include Mr Yong as a partner in what was originally his sole proprietorship, Zhi Pin Enterprise, and had made Mr Yong the sole signatory of Zhi Pin\u2019s bank account. 7', 'The transfers were made from either Mr Sia\u2019s own bank account, or that of Zhi Pin Enterprise (which was controlled by Mr Yong). 8', '(b)\\u2003Second, on or about 12 February 2012, Mr Sia transferred his share in the Emerald Garden property to Mr Yong for the sum of $290,000. This transfer was at an undervalue. Furthermore, the sum of $290,000 was then almost immediately transferred out of Mr Sia\u2019s bank account back to Mr Yong. Also, after he purchased his share on 4 September 2006, Mr Yong did not account to Mr Sia for the rental income from the Emerald Garden property. 9', '13\\u2003Based on the above and other particulars, Mr Sia prayed for a mix of reliefs and orders, including a declaration of Mr Yong\u2019s liability to account to Mr Sia for \u201closs and damage\u201d; an order for an account for \u201call or any secret profit [Mr Yong] may have earned directly or indirectly\u201d due to the breaches; a tracing order \u201cto trace all such monies from the hands of [Mr Yong] to such other repository as it may be found\u201d; \u201ca declaration as to what sums in the hands of [Mr Yong] are assets in equity of [Mr Sia] or traceable proceeds thereof\u201d; \u201call due accounts and inquiries\u201d and payment of the sum found due; an injunction prohibiting Mr Yong from disposing, dealing with or diminishing the value of his assets in Singapore; and any other further orders as the court deems fit. 10', '14\\u2003The Defence is extremely lengthy, and I summarise its key aspects. It was pleaded that Mr Sia stayed with Mr Yong from 2010 to 2012. Although Mr Yong encouraged Mr Sia\u2019s family to keep in touch with him, they did not wish to do so. They abandoned him to the care of Mr Yong and his family. During this time, Mr Yong had to bear all of Mr Sia\u2019s expenses, including the medical expenses. 11', 'Shortly before a scheduled work trip to China, on or around 4 June 2012, Mr Sia\u2019s family removed Mr Sia from Mr Yong\u2019s home against Mr Sia\u2019s will. 12', '15\\u2003In fact, Mr Sia trusted Mr Yong more than his own family, and wanted Mr Yong to care for him for the rest of his life. 13', 'Thus, on 21 May 2010, Mr Sia made Mr Yong a partner of Zhi Pin Enterprise, with Mr Yong as the sole signatory of the bank account. 14', 'Also, Mr Sia made the second will naming Mr Yong as the executor, and giving Mr Yong the residual share of the estate after some specified sums were distributed to Ms Sia and a few others. 15', '16\\u2003Mr Yong admitted that he had received certain sums of money transferred by Mr Sia, amounting to a total of $1,027,684. 16', 'However, Mr Yong alleged, inter alia, that the monies he received were given by Mr Sia out of Mr Sia\u2019s gratitude for caring for him, as compensation and reward, and as Mr Sia\u2019s contribution to their shared business ventures in the course of their close friendship. Mr Sia was abandoned by his family, and was helped and supported by Mr Yong. 17', '17\\u2003With regard to the Emerald Garden property, it was pleaded that Mr Sia\u2019s 7\/20 share of the Emerald Garden property was in fact Mr Yong\u2019s. Mr Yong transferred the share to Mr Sia as collateral for a loan of $280,000 given by Mr Sia. 18', 'Mr Yong subsequently paid off the loan, and hence Mr Sia transferred the share back to Mr Yong. Thereafter, Mr Sia decided to write off the loan entirely, and returned Mr Yong the sum of $280,000, as well as an additional sum of $10,000 as a contribution towards Mr Yong\u2019s family expenses. 19', '18\\u2003As mentioned above at [2], Mr Sia passed away in the early stages of the action. Ms Sia and Mr Chua applied to be substituted as the plaintiff to carry on with the action under Order 15 rule 7(2) of the ROC (\u201cthe application for substitution\u201d). Given the dispute over the rightful executor(s) of the estate, and in turn, the rightful personal representative(s) to carry on with the action, that application was dismissed on 10 August 2016. On the same day, pursuant to Mr Yong\u2019s application, the stay order was granted, staying the action until the outcome of the probate proceedings.', '19\\u2003As the probate proceedings progressed, Ms Sia discovered certain dealings by Mr Yong with regard to the Emerald Garden property. The Emerald Garden property was initially held by Mr Sia, Mr Yong\u2019s wife and Mr Yong, in the proportion of 7\/20, 7\/20 and 6\/20 shares respectively. After Mr Sia\u2019s transfer of his share to Mr Yong, the latter held 13\/20 share in the Emerald Garden property. 20', 'On or around 12 June 2017, through a title search, Ms Sia learned that Mr Yong had, on or around 23 March 2017, transferred the 13\/20 share to his daughter, Ms Yong Hui Yan (\u201cMs Yong\u201d) for a sum of $942,500. 21', 'Further, she discovered that on the same day of the transfer, a mortgage in favour of United Overseas Bank Limited had been granted by Ms Yong and Mr Yong\u2019s wife. 22', '20\\u2003Ms Sia\u2019s lawyers wrote to Mr Yong\u2019s lawyers to request an explanation for Mr Yong\u2019s conveyance of the Emerald Garden property, what had become of the sale proceeds and whether Mr Yong would be agreeable to place the proceeds in an escrow account. 23', 'Mr Yong\u2019s lawyers replied, stating that Ms Sia\u2019s demand for an explanation by Mr Yong was misconceived, that she had no basis to demand that Mr Yong provide an account of any of the assets that \u201callegedly belong to [Mr Sia\u2019s] [e]state\u201d and that she had no locus standi to participate in the action. 24', 'At around the same time, Ms Sia\u2019s lawyers wrote to Ms Yong requesting confirmation in writing that she would cease dealing with the Emerald Garden property until the conclusion of the action. 25', 'There was no response from Ms Yong. 26', '21\\u2003Thereafter, on 22 September 2017, Ms Sia filed the two applications which form the subject matter of the appeals.

Jayesh Hasmukh Shah (\u201cShah\u201d) is a director of ASGL. Shah is a permanent resident of Zimbabwe.', '3\\u2003The managing director of the Bank\u2019s wealth management division is Shamju Parakatil (\u201cParakatil\u201d). He was the principal point of contact in the Bank for Shah and ASGL. Ernest Leung (\u201cLeung\u201d) is also in the wealth management division and his title is \u201cHead of Core Clients APAC\u201d. Shah and ASGL also dealt with Leung.', '4\\u2003Several other entities are relevant though they are not parties to the Application. The first is AL Shams Building Materials Trading LLC (\u201cAL Shams Building\u201d), which was incorporated in Dubai on 26 March 1996. Shah\u2019s evidence was that 51% of the shares in AL Shams Building were held by a Dubai local, while the remaining 49% of the shares were held by another company, Saturn Trading and Investments Ltd (\u201cSaturn\u201d). Saturn was incorporated in the BVI in the late 1990s with Shah holding 100% of its shares. Shah deposed that Saturn held its 49% shareholding in AL Shams Building for the benefit of his family, including his brother, one Kalpesh Hasmukh Shah.', '5\\u2003Separately, in 2003, AL Shams Building purchased shares in a Zimbabwean company named Ariston Holdings Limited (\u201cAriston\u201d). Shah deposed that Ariston was listed and its shares quoted on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange.', '6\\u2003I noted Shah\u2019s evidence that he was at all times the legal and beneficial owner of ASGL, AL Shams Building and Saturn. I harboured some doubt as to the accuracy of this claim in respect of AL Shams Building. In particular, Shah deposed that (1) Saturn supposedly held the 49% stake in AL Shams Building for the benefit of the family, which suggested that the beneficial interest in those shares was not entirely his (see above at [4]); and (2) in any event, being only a 49% stake in AL Shams Building, it was not immediately clear how it could be said that Shah was the \u201cowner\u201d, legal or beneficial, of AL Shams Building even assuming the shares in Saturn were Shah\u2019s. Nonetheless, as this point was not material to the Application, I say no more on it.', '7\\u2003On 22 June 2010, Parakatil approached Shah and asked if ASGL would be interested in opening an account with the Bank. Sometime in August 2010, the Account was formally opened. Parakatil was the relationship manager for ASGL, and the Bank communicated with and took instructions from Shah, who was the authorised signatory for the Account.', '8\\u2003Shah also deposed that prior to the opening of the Account, the Bank had carried out its \u201cKnow Your Clients\u201d compliance checks (\u201cKYC Checks\u201d) on, inter alia, Shah and ASGL. These KYC Checks continued even after the opening of the Account. Among other things, the KYC Checks included the Bank procuring details of AL Shams Building and its links with ASGL, as well as posing queries on Shah\u2019s accounts, including specific transactions. Further, Shah said that there were regular visits to Zimbabwe by Parakatil. Shah\u2019s evidence was that throughout the KYC Checks, the Bank never indicated that Shah or ASGL was non-compliant or uncooperative. This was not disputed by the Bank.', '9\\u2003At the time that the Account was opened, the applicable terms were the 2010 edition of the Terms and Conditions (\u201cthe 2010 Terms and Conditions\u201d). It was not disputed that the 2010 Terms and Conditions were sent by the Bank to Shah on 18 August 2010, which was at or before the time the Account was opened. Further, as part of the account opening documents for the Account, Shah, in a document titled \u201cMandate for Limited Company Account(s)\u201d, certified that ASGL had, at a meeting duly convened and held on 16 July 2010, resolved:', '10\\u2003Three clauses in the 2010 Terms and Conditions were of significance. They are:', '11\\u2003Parakatil deposed that the Account was governed by the Bank\u2019s terms \u201cas applicable from time to time\u201d. Although he did not provide any basis for this statement, it appeared that the basis was cl 8.21(A) which entitled the Bank to vary the applicable terms upon notice to its customer. Parakatil also deposed that a new set of terms applied between June 2014 to September 2016 and a further set of terms applied at the time he deposed his affidavit, ie, 8 November 2017. However, for present purposes, it sufficed to take the 2010 Terms and Conditions as the applicable terms given that there were no material changes to cll 3.5(D), 3.10 and 8.21(A) in any of the subsequent sets of terms.', '12\\u2003I pause at this juncture to introduce a transaction that I shall refer to as \u201cthe Afrifresh Sale\u201d. The Afrifresh Sale sets much of the context for the Application. As the Bank was not involved in the Afrifresh Sale other than as the recipient of certain payments pursuant to the transaction, the evidence in this regard was provided entirely by Shah.', '13\\u2003Shah\u2019s evidence on the Afrifresh Sale was as follows:', '(a)\\u2003On 12 April 2012, AL Shams Building agreed to sell all of its shares in Ariston to Afrifresh Group (Pty) Ltd (\u201cAfrifresh\u201d) for a sum of US$2.5 million, plus interest for any delayed payments under a Sale of Shares Agreement (\u201cthe SSA\u201d). Afrifresh is a company incorporated in the Republic of South Africa.', '(b)\\u2003Under the SSA, it was agreed that the sum of US$2.5 million would be paid in instalments over a period of five years, commencing in 2012 and ending in 2016. Specifically, each instalment would be paid on 17 April of each year. Notably, although the vendor of the Ariston shares under the SSA was AL Shams Building, the SSA provided that Afrifresh should procure that all payments be made to the Account. As stated earlier (at [1]), the Account was in the name of ASGL, not AL Shams Building.', '(c)\\u2003On 16 April 2012, Shah notified Parakatil that the Ariston shares had been sold and the first instalment would be credited into the Account. On the next day, 17 April 2012, the first instalment under the SSA was credited into the Account. This first instalment was paid by an entity named Origin Global Holdings (\u201cOrigin Global\u201d) on behalf of Afrifresh.', '(d)\\u2003On 12 June 2013, the second instalment under the SSA was credited into the Account. This too was paid by Origin Global on behalf of Afrifresh.', '(e)\\u2003The third instalment under the SSA was paid in three smaller payments over 2014. The first of the three payments was paid by Origin Global while the later two payments were paid by an entity named Origin Fruits Direct B.V. Rotterdam (\u201cOrigin Fruits\u201d).', '(f)\\u2003The fourth instalment under the SSA was paid in six smaller payments over the course of 2015. All of these payments were by Origin Fruits.', '14\\u2003The fifth instalment involving a sum of US$71,947 (\u201cthe Payment\u201d) lay at the heart of the Application. Origin Fruits attempted to make the Payment in the midst of the closure of the Account by the Bank.', '15\\u2003By a letter dated 22 March 2016, the Bank gave ASGL notice of its decision to close the Account. The letter stated as follows:', '16\\u2003By an email dated 30 March 2016 to Parakatil, Shah confirmed receipt of the Bank\u2019s letter. Shah suggested that Parakatil and he discuss the closure of the Account at a meeting on 4 April 2016.', '17\\u2003On 4 April 2016, Shah and Parakatil met. At the meeting, Shah indicated that he would prefer if gradual steps were taken in closing the Account as he was expecting further payments into the Account from various sources in 2016. Parakatil\u2019s evidence was that he did not tell Shah that the Bank would accept all incoming payments until the end of 2016. Instead, he only told Shah that the Bank would consider if it could accept each incoming payment on a case by case basis, subject at all times to the approval of senior management and the Bank\u2019s compliance team.', '18\\u2003Shah also met Leung on 4 April 2016. The events of this meeting are disputed. According to Shah, he asked Leung where ASGL was expected to deposit its receivables if the Bank refused to accept payments into the Account as the Account was ASGL\u2019s only bank account outside of Zimbabwe. Leung then assured Shah that the Bank would act reasonably and not abandon ASGL. Shah assured Leung that he would also act reasonably and comply with the Bank\u2019 wishes to close two other accounts. Supposedly, in consideration of Shah acting reasonably and agreeing to close the said other two accounts, Leung agreed to grant ASGL a minimum nine-month period, until December 2016, to close the Account.', '19\\u2003Leung disputed this account of the meeting. According to Leung, the discussions with Shah were general in nature, and it was agreed that the Bank would work with Shah to close the Account amicably. While Shah had requested that ASGL be given adequate time to close the Account, Leung merely mentioned that the Bank would act reasonably and handle the Account in a manner that would facilitate an amicable closure. Leung\u2019s evidence was that nothing specific was promised. The matter of incoming payments to the Account was not discussed in detail. Shah merely informed Leung of possible incoming funds and stated that he would be transparent and co-operative with regard to providing such documents as the Bank might require. Again, Leung emphasised that he did not reach any specific agreement with Shah that the Bank would continue to accept any or all future incoming payments, but merely said that the Bank would act reasonably. Finally, Leung did not stipulate a fixed deadline for closure of the Account. While Leung indicated that the Bank would aim for closure by the end of 2016, he did not agree that the Bank would grant a minimum nine-month period to close the Account.', '20\\u2003On 13 April 2016, Shah and Parakatil met again. Shah reiterated that he was still expecting incoming payments from various sources. In response, Parakatil asked Shah to provide the Bank with a list of such payments. Parakatil\u2019s evidence was that he did not provide any indication or assurance to Shah that any incoming payments would be accepted. Shortly after the meeting, Shah sent Parakatil a list of expected incoming payments.', '21\\u2003On 14 April 2016, Shah sent an email to Parakatil enclosing a copy of the remittance instruction for the Payment. In response, Parakatil requested Shah to provide various documents, including the shareholding of Origin Fruits and Afrifresh. Parakatil also sought clarification on whether Standard Chartered Bank was a shareholder of either Origin Fruits or Afrifresh.', '22\\u2003On 18 April 2016, Shah replied by forwarding to Parakatil an email from Afrifresh which set out the shareholding of Afrifresh, Origin Global and Origin Fruits. Essentially, it stated that Standard Chartered Bank was a 45.1% shareholder of Afrifresh which in turn held 100% of the shares in Origin Global. Origin Global indirectly held 73% of the shares in another entity named OFD Holdings BV which in turn held 73% of the shares in Origin Fruits.', '23\\u2003Parakatil replied on the same day stating that the Bank would \u201crequire documentary evidence of the shareholding\u201d. In a subsequent email dated 20 April 2016, Parakatil followed up on that request and explained that the Bank was \u201cawaiting these shareholding documents, in order to understand who owns the company that is sending funds to [the Bank] and its link with [ASGL]\u201d. By a further email on 21 April 2016, Parakatil explained to Shah that the Bank would \u201chave to return the funds\u201d if the documents were not received by 25 April 2016. As this particular email is of significance below (at [68] and [70]), I set out the relevant portion as follows:', 'It was evident from the text of this email that: (1) any documents received would be subject to review and satisfaction by the Bank, and (2) the Bank would return the Payment if it did not receive by the stipulated deadline documents that it considered satisfactory. It is pertinent that the Bank did not state that it would not reject the Payment and not proceed with the closure of the Account if it received satisfactory documents.', '24\\u2003Shah subsequently arranged for one Paul Searson (whose email signature indicated that he was the Group Legal Counsel of Afrifresh) to email Parakatil the remaining documents that were requested. Paul Searson emailed Parakatil the documents on 21 April 2016. The email reiterated that Afrifresh owned 100% of the shares in Origin Global. It also stated that Origin Fruits was Afrifresh\u2019s marketing agent and was paying ASGL on Origin Global\u2019s behalf as Origin Fruits was a debtor of Afrifresh. An organogram of Origin Global was also attached to the email.', '25\\u2003By an email dated 21 April 2016, Parakatil informed Shah that he had submitted the documents for review, but added that the Bank needed documents which showed who owned AL Shams Building. Shah replied by an email on 23 April 2016 attaching various documents which he considered adequate to show the link between AL Shams Building and himself. Those documents included, inter alia, the following:', '(a)\\u2003AL Shams Building\u2019s commercial licence dated 26 March 1996;', '(b)\\u2003AL Shams Building\u2019s Memorandum of Association dated 29 May 2001 confirming that Saturn held 49% of the shares in the company;', '(c)\\u2003Saturn\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation;', '(d)\\u2003Saturn\u2019s Certificate of Good Standing dated 5 September 2005;', '(e)\\u2003A share certificate dated 5 April 2001 issued by Saturn stating that Shah was a registered shareholder of 49% of its shares;', '(f)\\u2003An application form dated 11 May 2002 for Saturn to open an account with HSBC Geneva; and', '(g)\\u2003A form dated 11 May 2002 declaring that the beneficial owner of Saturn was Shah.', '26\\u2003It appeared that these documents were not sufficient to satisfy the Bank. By an email dated 26 April 2016, Parakatil informed Shah that \u201cdue to internal policy reasons, the Bank is unable to process the incoming funds transfer to the Account, despite the additional documentation provided\u201d. Parakatil went on to state that the Bank required recent documents confirming the shareholding in AL Shams Building and Saturn. Parakatil also confirmed that all documents on Origin Fruits had been received and were in good order.', '27\\u2003Shah replied on the same day and explained that as both Saturn and AL Shams Building were closed sometime in 2005 or 2006, it was not possible to provide documents as recent as those requested by the Bank. Shah also indicated surprise at the Bank\u2019s request given that he had previously provided a copy of the SSA to the Bank and the Bank had accepted funds from Origin Global.', '28\\u2003I pause to note that it was strange for Shah to say that AL Shams Building and Saturn were closed in 2005 or 2006 when the SSA was entered into by AL Shams Building on 12 April 2012. Shah himself had described the Afrifresh Sale as involving AL Shams Building in 2012. Further, it was puzzling why Shah, in response to Parakatil\u2019s request for information on who held shares in AL Shams Building, gave information on Saturn\u2019s shareholding when Saturn, according to him, was closed; one would have expected Shah to provide updated information on who owned AL Shams Building.', '29\\u2003The Payment was eventually returned by the Bank on 26 April 2016. According to the Bank, this was \u201cdue to internal policy\u201d. On the same day, Parakatil responded to Shah\u2019s email of 26 April 2016 (see above at [27]), stating that his email was \u201cduly noted\u201d and that the Bank was \u201cpreparing a complete reply\u201d to his email.', '30\\u2003On 28 April 2016, Shah emailed Leung stating that he had offered Parakatil a \u201csimple solution\u201d of amending the SSA from AL Shams Building to ASGL. He explained that such an amendment was permitted by the SSA. The Bank did not reply to this email.', '31\\u2003By a letter dated 25 May 2016, the Bank informed ASGL that \u201con an exceptional one-off basis\u201d, the Bank had decided to accept four specific payments that were not relevant for present purposes. The Bank also stated that it was unable to accept any further incoming transfers of funds from Origin Fruits, unless such transfers related to the unwinding and\/or cancellation of the Account.', '32\\u2003Nearly a year later, by a letter dated 2 April 2017, Shah once more raised with Parakatil various matters in relation to the closure of the Account. These were, inter alia, requests that the Bank (1) state the legal basis for the Bank\u2019s various requests for documents and information in relation to the Payment; (2) provide details of the \u201cinternal policy\u201d relied on by the Bank as a basis for refusing to accept the Payment; and (3) clarify whether Suspicious Transactions Reports had been filed in respect of the Payment. The letter also stated that Shah was awaiting the Bank\u2019s formal response, referring to Parakatil\u2019s email on 26 April 2016 where he had said that the Bank was preparing a \u201ccomplete reply\u201d (see above at [29]).', '33\\u2003The Bank replied by a letter dated 18 May 2017 reiterating that its decision to close the Account was in accordance with the Bank\u2019s terms and that it was as a result of re-alignment of its business strategy. The Bank gave notice that with effect from 30 June 2017, the Account would be closed. As for Shah\u2019s various requests, the Bank stated that the information that it had sought was for \u201clegitimate operational reasons\u201d and \u201cnot for personal reasons of any employee or agent\u201d. The Bank also stated that it did not make information on its internal policy, suspicious transaction reporting and\/or KYC processes available to any of its clients.'"}
{"casename":"2018_SGHC_145","fact":"'2\\u2003In the latter part of 2014, PT OKI expressed an interest in procuring from Sunrise a complete set of FRP-Piping for the Project and in engaging Sunrise for the installation of the said piping. After extensive negotiations, Sunrise and PT OKI entered into two separate contracts dated 10 July 2015. Both contracts provided for Singapore law to be the governing law and further provided that the parties \u201cirrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of Singapore, which shall have exclusive jurisdiction over such disputes\u201d and that the parties agree to waive any objections to proceedings in Singapore on the ground that they were brought in an inconvenient forum.', '3\\u2003The first contract (\u201cthe Supply Contract\u201d) was signed on or around 12 August 2015 although it was dated 10 July 2015. It required Sunrise to supply a complete set of FRP-Piping for the Project. The initial contract price, which was subsequently revised, was US$6,647,625. The Supply Contract required Sunrise to furnish a Bank Guarantee to PT OKI with respect to the performance of its obligations under the said contract.', '4\\u2003The second contract (the \u201cInstallation Contract\u201d) required Sunrise to supervise and install the FRP-Piping for the Project for US$1,291,935. Unlike the Supply Contract, the Installation Contract did not require the provision of a Bank Guarantee by Sunrise.', '5\\u2003On 14 September 2015, the Supply Contract was amended to exclude some items from and to include a number of other items in the list of goods to be supplied. As a result of the changes, the contract price for the goods to be supplied under the said contract was raised to US$6,925,839.', '6\\u2003The required Bank Guarantee under the Supply Contract was issued by the Bank on 21 September 2015 for 10% of the total contract price under the said contract, as amended on 14 September 2015, which amounted to US$692,583.90. The Bank Guarantee was an unconditional on-demand guarantee that was intended to serve as security for the fulfilment of Sunrise\u2019s obligations under the Supply Contract, including the delivery of goods to PT OKI within the prescribed time. Under the Bank Guarantee, the Bank irrevocably and unconditionally undertook to pay to PT OKI any amount up to US$692,583.90 immediately and within five banking days from receipt of PT OKI\u2019s written demand calling on the said Guarantee \u201cnotwithstanding any challenge whatsoever or howsoever made by [Sunrise] or any other Party\u201d.', '7\\u2003On 10 November 2015, the parties amended the Supply Contract to include some further items (the \u201cadditional goods\u201d) to be supplied by Sunrise. The amendments resulted in the raising of the contract price by a further US$1,398,293.', '8\\u2003The Supply Contract required the goods and additional goods to be delivered to PT OKI in Indonesia by 25 November 2015 and 15 January 2016 respectively (the \u201coriginal delivery deadlines\u201d). The Supply Contract provided for liquidated damages for delayed delivery, which were capped at 10% of the total contract price. The maximum amount payable as liquidated damages for delayed delivery would be reached once there had been a delay of six full weeks.', '9\\u2003According to PT OKI, the delivery deadlines were not met. It is PT OKI\u2019s case that this resulted in Sunrise being liable for the maximum liquidated damages for delayed delivery. However, Sunrise claimed that it was not in breach because the delayed delivery of the goods and additional goods was due to PT OKI\u2019s failure to put the required Letters of Credit (\u201cL\/Cs\u201d) in place on time as well as the latter\u2019s delay in making the required initial payments for the goods and additional goods. In contrast, PT OKI blamed Sunrise for these delays and alleged that the latter failed to furnish the required documentation timeously to enable it to put the L\/Cs in place and make the initial payments for the goods.', '10\\u2003In view of the delays in shipment of the goods and additional goods to Indonesia, the L\/Cs for these goods were amended on 23 December 2015 to reflect the changed position and the latest date for shipment of the goods was changed to 29 February 2016 in the L\/Cs. The parties held different views on whether or not the amendment of the latest date for shipment of the goods extended the original deadlines for the arrival of the goods in Indonesia and released Sunrise from any alleged breach of the delivery deadlines.', '11\\u2003On 7 January 2016, the security under the Bank Guarantee was increased to US$832,413.20, which is the sum claimed by PT OKI from the Bank under the Bank Guarantee.', '12\\u2003Apart from complaining about the delayed shipment of the goods and additional goods, PT OKI asserted that Sunrise failed to perform some of its other obligations under the Supply Contract. It pointed out that Sunrise failed to deliver to it a cargo of \u201cSpecial Tools\u201d required for the installation of the FRP-Piping in the Project and that some of the goods supplied by Sunrise under the Supply Contract did not comply with the specifications stated in the said contract.', '13\\u2003By May 2016, the parties were exchanging rather rude emails.

He stated as follows:', '15\\u2003Sujanto\u2019s rather terse reply to Kunjukutty on 19 May 2016 was also in rather impolite terms as he stated as follows:', '16\\u2003Kunjukutty\u2019s email on the same day to Sujanto included the following remarks, which showed that the relationship between the parties had totally broken down:', '17\\u2003Nearly five months later, on 10 October 2016, PT OKI called on the Bank Guarantee and instructed the Bank in writing to pay to it the guaranteed sum of US$832,413.20 immediately.

On 20 October 2016, the Bank informed PT OKI that it would be paying the guaranteed amount on or before 28 October 2016.', '18\\u2003On 14 October 2016, PT OKI\u2019s solicitors, M\/s Drew & Napier LLC, informed Sunrise in a 13-page letter that PT OKI intended to take all necessary steps to protect its interests and had called on the Bank Guarantee to satisfy in part the losses suffered by it as a result of alleged breaches by Sunrise.', '19\\u2003On 19 October 2016, Sunrise commenced proceedings in the Indian Commercial Court of Vadodora (the \u201cIndian proceedings\u201d) to prevent the Bank from paying the guaranteed amount to PT OKI. The Indian proceedings were limited to the Bank Guarantee. It may be recalled that both the Supply Contract and the Installation Contract provided that disputes were to be settled in Singapore courts in accordance with Singapore law. Sunrise sought to excuse its failure to comply with the exclusive jurisdiction clause in the said contracts as follows in an affidavit dated 6 January 2017 filed by Kunjukutty in the Indian proceedings:', '20\\u2003Sunrise\u2019s application was initially dismissed by the Commercial Court of Vadodara for want of jurisdiction. The twists and turns in the Indian proceedings need not be discussed. What is relevant here is that on appeal, the decision of the Commercial Court that it had no jurisdiction to deal with Sunrise\u2019s application was overruled by the High Court of Gujarat at Ahmedabad. An injunction was subsequently issued in favour of Sunrise on 9 January 2017. The injunction in the Indian proceedings is now of academic interest because it expired on 29 June 2017.', '21\\u2003A few days before the injunction in the Indian proceedings was granted, Sunrise commenced Suit No 8 of 2017 in Singapore against PT OKI on 6 January 2017.

With respect to the Supply Contract, Sunrise pleaded that PT OKI breached it in the following ways:', '(a)\\u2003changing the description of the FRP-Piping to be supplied under the Supply Contract;', '22\\u2003In its suit, Sunrise sought a number of reliefs, including an injunction to restrain PT OKI from calling on and\/or receiving any money pursuant to the Bank Guarantee as well as a declaration that the Bank Guarantee stands discharged.

IVAX was looking into the manufacture and assembly of asthma inhalers in Singapore. Two of the components required for these inhalers were compression springs and flap valve spring strips (together, \u201cthe Springs\u201d). The plaintiff contacted the defendant regarding the manufacture and supply of the Springs.', '7\\u2003Both the plaintiff and the defendant held discussions with IVAX\u2019s representatives. IVAX required both the plaintiff and the defendant to undergo a pre-qualification process. From around 2003 to 2004, the defendant took part in this process. The defendant had to show that it would be able to meet the requirements set out in the following documents:', '(a)\\u2003Component Vendor Specifications (\u201cCVS\u201d) for the Springs. The CVS set out, among other things, the component specifications, manufacturing process requirements, cleaning requirements, qualification testing against approved Qualification Protocols, and acceptance testing; and', '(b)\\u2003Qualification Protocol and Checklists (\u201cQP Checklists) for the Springs.

He was serving his national service at the time of the first offence, and was a first year polytechnic student at the time of the second offence.', '6\\u2003The facts constituting the two offences were recorded in the Statement of Facts which the Accused admitted to without any qualification.', '7\\u2003The first offence was one of voluntarily causing hurt (\u201cVCH\u201d) by dangerous weapons or means under s 324 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (\u201cPC\u201d). The victim was a 20-year-old male. In the early morning of 9 October 2016, the victim and two of his friends were at a night club. At about 2.00am, one of the victim\u2019s friends, Melvish s\/o Rajendran (\u201cMelvish\u201d), was chatting with a friend in the vicinity of the club when the Accused suddenly punched him on his head. A mutual friend intervened. The Accused repeatedly asked whether Melvish was from a particular local gang. Police officers on patrol intervened and conducted checks on the parties. Thereafter, Melvish and the Accused went their separate ways and Melvish told the victim what had happened.', '8\\u2003Later, at about 5.40am, Melvish and the victim were standing outside the club when Melvish noticed the Accused leaving the club premises and pointed him out to the victim. The Accused saw that and confronted Melvish. One of the Accused\u2019s friends tried to mediate. The Accused challenged the victim to a fight and asked the victim to follow him, which the victim did for a few steps. The Accused then produced a knife, at which point the victim suggested they talk things out. This did not find favour with the Accused who used the knife and cut the victim on his right cheek.', '9\\u2003The Accused then fled the scene and threw the knife away. The knife was not recovered. According to the Accused, it was a pocket knife around the size of a pen.', '10\\u2003In the meantime, the victim was conveyed to the emergency department of a nearby hospital. The victim\u2019s medical report prepared by a resident of the Department of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery stated that he suffered an 11cm right facial laceration from his upper lip to his right ear. It was a \u201cfull thickness skin laceration with injury to the underlying fascia and two buccal nerve branches\u201d. The victim underwent repair of the laceration and buccal branch of his facial nerve. He was hospitalized for three days and given nine days of medical leave. As a result of the assault, the victim will bear a permanent scar on the right side of his face.', '11\\u2003The second offence for rioting under s 147 of the PC occurred several months later, while the Accused was on bail for the first offence. Two groups of persons were involved: the Accused was part of one group, while the victim, who was an 18-year-old male, was part of the other.', '12\\u2003On the evening of 22 April 2017, members of the two groups (except the Accused who was not initially there) were drinking at separate tables in a bar. An altercation broke out between the victim and one of those in the other group, named Divagaran s\/o Kesavan (\u201cDivagaran\u201d), as a result of a long-held grudge between them. They were stopped by the others present and both groups thereafter separated.', '13\\u2003Subsequently, the victim called one of the Divagaran\u2019s companions and asked to meet again. Divagaran and his companions in turn called the Accused whom they considered \u201ctheir older friend\u201d. The Accused arrived within 20 minutes and was apprised of the earlier altercation. He advised Divagaran that they might as well resolve the matter once and for all, rather than having no closure on this issue.', '14\\u2003Sometime later, the victim saw Divagaran and confronted him. The victim chased Divagaran who led the victim to where the Accused and his companions were waiting. Upon seeing the group, the victim stopped chasing Divagaran; but the Accused and his companions charged at the victim and they punched and kicked him, causing him to fall to the ground. One of the victim\u2019s friends tried to stop the assault but was unable to do so.', '15\\u2003The assault was recorded by closed-circuit television cameras in the area. From the footage, it was evident that the Accused was the most aggressive of the assailants, landing a total of seven punches on the victim\u2019s chest and back and 11 kicks. All 11 kicks were delivered while the victim was on the ground. Three of these kicks were to the victim\u2019s head, and four of them involved the Accused stamping on the victim\u2019s head.

In support of the transfer application, the plaintiff relied principally on the quantification of his claims for (a) loss of earnings and\/or earning capacity and (b) past and future medical expenses. In essence, the plaintiff claimed that the 2012 Accident caused him new neck and back injuries, or aggravated certain existing neck and back injuries, to the extent that his job as a real estate agent has been affected.', '4\\u2003An uncommon feature of this case is that the 2012 Accident was but one of many car accidents involving the plaintiff from 2003 to 2016.

In this case the GRP panels were made of a 20mm-thick aluminium honeycomb core (19mm cell size) sandwiched and enveloped between two fire-retardant unsaturated polyester resin glass fibre reinforcements, or \u201cskins\u201d. 7', 'The upper skin additionally had a polyester gelcoat. 8', 'The panels measured about 3m wide and 10\u201314m long. 9', 'It is not disputed that the Sub-Contract comprised the following documents: 10', '(a)\\u2003a Purchase Order dated 28 August 2008, between Kalzip and BFG; 11', '(b)\\u2003Annexure 1 to the Purchase Order, which incorporated: 12', '(c)\\u2003Annexure 2 to the Purchase Order 13', '; and', '(d)\\u2003extracts from the Technical Specification for Podium Roof Finishes WP 3215: MICE Roof, Casino Roof & Theatre Roof, ISSUE_REV C, dated 23 August 2007 (\u201cSpecification Revision C\u201d) 14', '.', '8\\u2003The Sub-Contract specifications which are pertinent to the Suit are: (1) the requirements as to the structural performance of the GRP panels, in terms of the load they would be able to bear and the degree to which they would deflect or bend under specified loads; and (2) requirements as to the fire safety of the GRP panels. I expand on these requirements at [50] and [391] below respectively.', '9\\u2003The GRP panels were manufactured by BFG in the Philippines in the latter half of 2009. 15', 'They were manufactured based on information and manufacturing drawings (one drawing per panel) provided by Kalzip. 16', 'Throughout the manufacturing process, Kalzip\u2019s appointed representative, Loxon Philippines Inc (\u201cLoxon\u201d), carried out a quality check on each GRP panel to ensure that it had been manufactured properly, that its dimensions were correct and that it was not delaminated, and thereafter approved it for shipment to Singapore for installation. 17', 'Kalzip installed the panels from around November 2009 on the casino building roof, followed by the MICE building roof from around January 2010; works on the theatre building roof were scheduled to commence in March 2010. 18', '10\\u2003Sometime around January and February 2010, Kalzip complained that delamination of the GRP panels had been observed during installation on the casino and MICE building roofs. In particular, it was alleged that the inner skins of the GRP panels were coming apart from the aluminium honeycomb core. Surveys were carried out and delamination was allegedly found to be widespread. 19', 'According to Kalzip, the delamination adversely affected the load-bearing characteristics of the panels, rendering them non-compliant with the Sub-Contract requirements. 20', '11\\u2003BFG appeared to accept that delamination had occurred, but took the view that this was because the panels had been misused (viz, had been walked on and subjected to excessive loads). Kalzip, on the other hand, took the position that the panels had delaminated due to deficiencies in manufacturing. 21', 'An internal e-mail within BFG dated 7 March 2010 records that, the night before a meeting with MBS, Kalzip informed BFG that circular samples which had been cored from some GRP panels installed onsite were underweight. BFG protested that the panels had been misused. In response, Kalzip gave BFG \u201ctwo options\u201d. The first was for BFG to \u201cgo with [Kalzip] and support them to say to MBS that there is a problem and we will resolve this\u201d in an attempt to \u201cget out of this problem with minimum damage\u201d. One of the risks associated with this option was that Kalzip wanted BFG to bear all the liability. The second option was for BFG to \u201cstart [an] argument [with Kalzip] about the misuse of panels versus bad manufacturing and go to [a] formal dispute between MBS and BFG where [Kalzip] would not support [BFG]\u201d. This would involve BFG officially taking the position that the panels, as supplied, met the load bearing requirements in the Sub-Contract. 22', '12\\u2003BFG chose the former option. On 9 March 2010, BFG met with Kalzip and \u201cre-iterated BFG\u2019s commitment to assisting Kalzip with resolving the upstream issues with MBS and in particular on working together with Kalzip to rectify the alleged defects identified by MBS and\/or Kalzip\u201d. 23', 'BFG and Kalzip sought to present a united front to MBS. The parties agreed to adopt the strategy of showing that the panels were strong enough to meet the Sub-Contract load requirements notwithstanding delamination of the lower skin. BFG carried out calculations to show that this was the case. Based on these calculations, BFG took the position that the GRP panels were fit for purpose and met the Sub-Contract requirements without modification even if they were delaminated, and presented this position to MBS on 17 March 2010. Kalzip likewise adopted this position vis-\u00e0-vis MBS. 24', 'The less-than-satisfactory test results were explained by pointing out problems with the tests and the other components of the structures supporting the panels, and not the panels themselves.', '13\\u2003Notwithstanding its position vis-\u00e0-vis MBS, Kalzip looked to BFG to make good its losses arising from the allegedly delaminated panels. At a meeting with MBS described in BFG\u2019s 7 March e-mail, \u201c[Kalzip] used this weak position and put [the] entire responsibility on BFG\u201d. 25', 'On 25 March 2010, Kalzip\u2019s solicitors wrote to BFG alleging that the panels were \u201cnot manufactured in accordance with the specifications stated in the Purchase Orders\u201d and that BFG was \u201cclearly in breach\u201d of the Sub-Contract. It reserved its right to recover, from BFG, sums that MBS had withheld from Kalzip under the Trade Contract. 26', 'BFG replied on 6 April 2010 denying that the panels were defective and alleging that the delamination observed onsite had resulted from misuse and mishandling during and after installation. 27', 'Kalzip sent another letter dated 25 May 2010 warning BFG that it was \u201ccurrently facing a SGD 1 million to SGD 33 million claim, due to the supplied defective panels\u201d [emphasis in original]. 28', '14\\u2003From March to November 2010, BFG continued to propose rectification solutions to Kalzip, including supplying replacement GRP panels. 29', 'On 3 August 2010, Kalzip\u2019s project director Mr Peter Carter (\u201cMr Carter\u201d) e-mailed BFG\u2019s Mr Flook for a quotation for replacement panels and sought confirmation that BFG would \u201cabsorb the costs for this work until such time as Kalzip resolves the financial implications of this matter with MBS\u201d, following which \u201c[a] solution would also then be worked out between Kalzip and BFG\u201d. 30', 'Mr Flook received a call from Mr Carter, who said that BFG \u201cneed to keep the aluminium core, and a percentage of the re manufacturing cost that BFG is prepared to bear.

Kalzip made rectification proposals to MBS, but these were not implemented. 34', 'Kalzip alleged that at a meeting on 18 November 2010, MBS informed Kalzip that it was not prepared for Kalzip to replace the GRP panels using BFG as the manufacturer as it had lost confidence in BFG. 35', 'In February 2011, MBS sent another letter to Kalzip expressing disappointment in Kalzip and reserving its right to appoint third party contractors to carry out the rectification work. 36', 'In March 2011, MBS issued a Construction Manager\u2019s Instruction omitting the theatre panels from Kalzip\u2019s scope of works. On 15 March 2011, MBS informed Kalzip that it had appointed a third party contractor to remove and replace the GRP panels in the Project. 37', 'On 28 April 2011, MBS instructed a third party contractor, Craft Facade Pte Ltd (\u201cCraft\u201d), to remove the GRP panels and install replacement aluminium panels. 38', 'Kalzip claims that it was not involved in the removal of the GRP panels or the instalment of replacement panels. 39', 'After the panels were removed from the Project, they were stored in the Toll Warehouse in anticipation of their removal. 40', 'The GRP panels which were meant to be installed on the theatre building were not installed as a result of the problems discovered with the MICE and casino buildings and remained in storage. Some of these panels were subsequently sent for testing though, for reasons which I detail below, the tests did not establish delamination. These panels were disposed of before the commencement of the Suit.', '16\\u2003Kalzip claims that as a result of the alleged defects, MBS refused to pay Kalzip for the GRP panels already installed. MBS also deducted S$8,685,495.74 from Kalzip\u2019s final account for the costs MBS had incurred in connection with the allegedly defective GRP panels (ie, for testing the GRP panels and engaging consultants and Craft). 41', 'Kalzip seeks that sum from BFG in the present proceedings.', '17\\u2003On 4 July 2011, Kalzip commenced arbitration proceedings against MBS. As will be seen, Kalzip\u2019s approach was to first deny liability for the delaminated GRP panels upstream vis-\u00e0-vis MBS, and to subsequently attempt to visit liability for the same upon BFG downstream. In relation to the GRP panels, Kalzip sought payment from MBS for inter alia supplying and installing GRP panels on the MICE and casino buildings; fabricating GRP panels for the theatre building; investigating remedial solutions and further work done in connection with the defective GRP panels; and loss of profit on the work of removal and replacement, which had been awarded to Craft. Kalzip also claimed other sums, including in relation to disputed variations which it had carried out, prolongation costs and the repayment of retention monies; these items were not related to the Kalizp-BFG Sub-Contract. 42', 'Its total claim against MBS was S$15,868,904.47, being the difference between the sums it claimed to be entitled to (S$42,368,556.51) and what it had been paid (S$26,499,652.04). 43', '18\\u2003Kalzip\u2019s position in the arbitration was that it had complied with its contractual obligations, and that MBS bore design responsibility for the GRP panels, which were inherently prone to delaminate. Kalzip\u2019s Statement of Claim in the arbitration states that the delamination occurred \u201cas a result of design decisions made by [MBS], which were not [Kalzip\u2019s] responsibility\u201d, and that MBS wrongly refused to allow Kalzip to replace the defective panels unless Kalzip agreed to vary the contractual terms. 44', 'Kalzip\u2019s Reply and Defence to Counterclaim in the arbitration states that the \u201cbasic design of the GRP panels was complete\u201d at the time that MBS issued the Letter of Award to Kalzip, and that the \u201ctendency to delaminate was inherent in the design of the GRP Panels\u201d. 45', '19\\u2003There were negotiations towards a settlement between MBS and Kalzip in the lead-up to the arbitration hearing. According to Kalzip, MBS remained unwilling to pay any sums to Kalzip for the defective GRP panels, though it indicated that it was willing to compromise on Kalzip\u2019s variation claims. Kalzip says that as a matter of principle, MBS refused to compromise on its decision to deduct the sum of S$8,685,495.74 from monies due to Kalzip under the contract (comprising the contract sum paid by MBS to Craft (S$8,121,319.31), the consultancy fees incurred by MBS in connection with the defective GRP panels (S$449,950.75) and testing fees (S$114,225.68)). 46', 'The arbitration hearing between Kalzip and MBS began on 18 February 2013 and was scheduled to last five weeks. On 23 February 2013, Kalzip and MBS entered into an in-principle commercial settlement, which they formally executed on 26 February 2013 (\u201cthe Settlement Agreement\u201d); MBS agreed to pay Kalzip the sum of S$5.5m, of which S$4m was compensation and S$1.5m was for Kalzip\u2019s agreed costs. MBS would also pay the costs of the arbitration proceedings. 47', '20\\u2003According to Mr Mueller, the S$4m essentially comprised all of Kalzip\u2019s claims apart from those which had to do with the GRP panels. 48', 'I note, however, that as stated in cl 1.1 of the Settlement Agreement, MBS paid Kalzip S$4m \u201cin full and final settlement of any and all disputes, controversies, claims and counterclaims that each party has against the other\u201d. Moreover, cl 8.1 of the Settlement Agreement states, \u201cThis Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties in connection with its subject matter and supersedes all prior representations, communications, negotiations and understandings concerning the subject matter of this Agreement.\u201d 49', 'Kalzip\u2019s claims against MBS in respect of the allegedly defective GRP panels were therefore part of the claims settled in the Settlement Agreement.', '21\\u2003On 30 May 2013, Kalzip sent a letter of demand to BFG for the sum of S$13m. BFG claims that it was surprised by the letter of demand, having heard nothing from Kalzip since BFG\u2019s offer in November 2010 to supply replacement GRP panels at Kalzip\u2019s cost. BFG says it did not hear from Kalzip for close to three years and was left out of the loop regarding Kalzip\u2019s arbitration with MBS. 50', 'One of Kalzip\u2019s witnesses confirmed during the trial that Kalzip did not inform BFG about its settlement with MBS prior to signing the Settlement Agreement. 51', 'There does not seem to be any evidence before me that BFG knew or was otherwise given notice that the panels were being removed from the Project. 52', '22\\u2003It does seem strange that after the flurry of accusations and denials of inner skin delamination in the GRP panels from January or February 2010 to November 2010, when BFG did not hear back from Kalzip on its offer to replace GRP panels at Kalzip\u2019s cost, BFG appears to have sat tight. Although I note that BFG did not have an office in Singapore, there is no evidence before me as to whether they kept in touch with developments at the site or whether they hoped Kalzip would resolve matters with MBS. Under cross-examination, Mr Premamoorthy, BFG\u2019s Vice President who managed the Philippines factory which produced the GRP panels (see [37(b)] below), agreed that from March 2010 through to May 2013, BFG knew that it might face potential liability to Kalzip. 53', 'It therefore appears that BFG was aware of a potential dispute with Kalzip but perhaps adopted the attitude of letting sleeping dogs lie. Kalzip\u2019s strategy, on the other hand, was inter alia to deny liability for the delaminated panels in its arbitration with MBS but, whether for tactical or other reasons, without involving BFG. Even though Kalzip was based in Singapore, knew about the panels being removed and replaced and had at the very least a sizeable portion of the panels in its possession, it did not test the panels for delamination or preserve them as evidence. Kalzip ended up settling its claim against MBS and, having obtained what it could from MBS, then turned to BFG in the present Suit to make a claim against BFG for the defective GRP panels and damages caused thereby. Although Kalzip alleges that MBS refused to pay for the GRP panels, I have noted earlier Kalzip\u2019s settlement with MBS of its pleaded claims in the arbitration, including the supply and installation of roof finishes and GRP panels to the MICE and casino buildings, the supply of GRP panels and the supply and installation of roof finishes to the theatre building, the cost of investigating remedial solutions and further work done in connection with the defective GRP panels, and loss of profit on removing and replacing the same as a result of that work being awarded to Craft. 54', '23\\u2003On 11 July 2013, Kalzip commenced the Suit against BFG. The Suit has been bifurcated and these grounds of decision deal with BFG\u2019s liability in the claim only. The quantum of damages would have been dealt with in a subsequent tranche had I allowed the claim.'"}

The plaintiff had come to the view that the defendant had made unauthorised withdrawals from bank accounts which were in their joint names, and wanted to recover her claimed beneficial share in half the moneys withdrawn, which she estimates to be worth approximately $14.7m. She was also considering recourse against the defendant for her mismanagement of their late parents\u2019 estates.

Mr A replied to ask whether it was a Mareva injunction that had been suggested, and Mr Hue responded by suggesting that the plaintiff be allowed to set out the facts before a course of action was decided upon.', '5\\u2003The plaintiff, her daughter and Mr Hue met Mr A and Mr B the next day, on 20 October 2016. What was communicated at this meeting was a matter of dispute in this case. The plaintiff claimed that the meeting lasted \u201ca few hours\u201d. By contrast, Mr A claimed that the meeting took one and a half hours. It is sufficient to state here that the plaintiff\u2019s case was that confidential information and documents which are material to her pending action were presented to Mr A and Mr B, and that their continued possession of this information presented a risk that it would be disclosed to the lawyers from the Firm who are now acting for the defendant, to the prejudice of the plaintiff\u2019s claim.', '6\\u2003After the meeting, Mr B on 21 October 2016 sent the plaintiff an email inviting her to sign an appointment letter and a warrant to act, and asking for payment of an initial amount of $10,000 so that he and Mr A could begin work on the plaintiff\u2019s matter. Mr B also asked the plaintiff to provide him information and documents relevant to her potential claims, including details of the bank accounts that the plaintiff held jointly with the defendant and a chronology of the plaintiff\u2019s dealings with the defendant from 2006 to the present day.

{"casename":"2018_SGHC_157","fact":"'5\\u2003After a tender exercise and a period of negotiations, the Defendant was awarded by the Plaintiff the contract to provide interior fit out and furnishing works for the Grand Hyatt Colombo Project. On 7 January 2015, a document titled \u201cContract Agreement\u201d was signed, together with a document titled \u201cMemorandum of Understanding\u201d. 5', 'In the meantime, even before these two documents were executed, the Defendant had already commenced work on the project, as instructed by the Plaintiff.', '6\\u2003Not long later, there was a wholesale change in the board of directors of the Plaintiff. 6', 'Disputes then arose between the parties. The Plaintiff purported to terminate the contract on several grounds, including the ground that the Defendant had failed to furnish a performance guarantee as required for under the contract. 7', 'By this time, the Defendant had completed a portion of the contracted works and had incurred significant expenditure in relation to such works.', '7\\u2003On 20 August 2015, the Defendant referred the disputes with the Plaintiff to the International Chamber of Commerce (\u201cICC\u201d) for arbitration. 8', 'This was in accordance with an arbitration clause in a letter issued by the Plaintiff dated 22 December 2014 titled \u201cLetter of Acceptance\u201d, which was one of the documents parties had agreed formed part of the contract between them. The clause in question read: \u201cAll disputes arising out of or in connection with the Contract shall be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with the said Rules. The arbitration venue shall be in Singapore and arbitration proceedings shall be in English language\u201d (the \u201cICC Arbitration Clause\u201d). 9', '8\\u2003On 17 December 2015, the ICC constituted the three-man arbitral tribunal. 10', 'As the parties could not agree on the seat of the arbitration, on 24 March 2016, the ICC International Court of Arbitration determined that the seat of the arbitration should be Singapore. 11', '9\\u2003At an early stage of the arbitral proceedings, the Plaintiff, who was the respondent in the arbitration, raised objections to the jurisdiction of the tribunal. 12', 'The argument made by the Plaintiff was that the parties had not agreed to the ICC arbitration clause found in the Letter of Acceptance. Instead, what parties had agreed to was one of the particular conditions which was issued with the tender document. This particular condition was titled: \u201cSub Clause 20.6 \u2013 Arbitration\u201d and it read as follows: \u201cItem (a) of first paragraph of Clause 20.6 is deleted and replaced with: (a) the dispute shall be finally settled as per the Arbitration Act No. 11 of 1995 of Sri Lanka and the place of Arbitration shall be of Colombo\u201d (the \u201cSri Lankan Arbitration Clause\u201d). 13', '10\\u2003In short, the Plaintiff argued that the Sri Lankan Arbitration Clause was the applicable one because the Defendant had made its offer to contract on the basis of that clause and it had been accepted by the Plaintiff when the parties signed the Contract Agreement and Memorandum of Understanding on 7 January 2015. While there had been intervening negotiations between the parties on the possibility of using ICC rules of arbitration and changing the venue of arbitration to Singapore, the parties eventually never agreed to the ICC Arbitration Clause contained in the Letter of Acceptance of 22 December 2015. Thus, according to the Plaintiff, the Sri Lankan Arbitration Clause which appeared in the tender package documentation was never \u201cdisplaced\u201d and remained applicable as the contractually agreed clause between the parties.', '11\\u2003What is not in dispute though is that the tribunal did not make a preliminary ruling on this jurisdictional dispute at any stage of the arbitral proceedings. The Plaintiff had also not requested the tribunal to make such a ruling. Instead, the parties proceeded with the evidential hearing dealing with all issues, which took place over 9 days in two tranches from 7 to 11 November 2016 and 31 January to 3 February 2017. 14', '12\\u2003The Plaintiff made submissions on its objections to the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction on both the first and final days of the evidential hearing. 15', 'Both parties also dealt with the jurisdiction objections in their post-hearing written submissions to the tribunal.', '13\\u2003On 29 September 2017, the tribunal issued its final award. The award dealt with both the jurisdictional issue and the substantive dispute between the parties which as mentioned earlier involved the question of whether the Defendant had defaulted on its contractual obligations by failing to issue a performance guarantee. The tribunal ruled against the Plaintiff on both jurisdiction and the merits, and awarded the Defendant damages in the sum of \u20ac7,432,062.79, plus interest, legal costs and costs of the arbitration. 16'"}

She accepted the offer on 22 November 2001. This course was to last a minimum period of one year and a maximum period of three years. It was a requirement that the Plaintiff complete a 40,000-word thesis in order to graduate from the course. Dr Wong was the Plaintiff\u2019s sole supervisor for her thesis.', '9\\u2003On 7 January 2002, the Plaintiff\u2019s candidature for the Degree commenced. The Plaintiff also entered into a formal Research Scholarship Agreement with NUS dated 7 January 2002.', '10\\u2003I will now set out in some detail the events which led to the present action as the Plaintiff relied on the series of events to make many allegations against NUS\u2019 officers including conspiracy and malice.', '11\\u2003During the period of supervision, Dr Wong obtained a grant of $80,200 for a project to create a digital visualisation of Commercial Square which is today known as Raffles Place (\u201cthe Visualisation Project\u201d). The idea was to create a virtual reconstruction of Commercial Square to make abstract architectural concepts, space and form more comprehensive to laymen. The idea had been discussed with Dr Stephen Wittkopf, HOD Heng and Professor Chan Yew Lih. According to Dr Wong, they intended to tap on his knowledge from one of his projects, Visual Collection, which comprised collection of pictures, plans and drawings of Singapore.', '12\\u2003Between 8 March 2004 and 18 January 2005, Dr Wong sent emails to the Plaintiff to inform her about his intention to employ her as a research assistant for six to eight months for the Visualisation Project. For example, in an email from him to her dated 5 August 2004, he said, \u201cYour work will be an important basis for the digital visualisation work \u2013 it is the content.\u201d 1', '13\\u2003On 26 January 2005, Dr Wong, Dr Wittkopf and HOD Heng submitted an application for a research grant for the Visualisation Project to the NUS Faculty Research Committee. 2', 'Professor Chan Yew Lih was not named in the Grant Application Form (\u201cGrant Application Form\u201d).', '14\\u2003The Plaintiff completed her thesis on 4 February 2005, one day before an extended deadline for submissions on 5 February 2005. As part of NUS\u2019 administrative requirements, the Plaintiff had to complete and sign Form 57\/2000A which was a Supervisor\u2019s Report Form. She referred to this form as a Thesis Submission Form. The form was also to be completed and signed by Dr Wong.', '15\\u2003On the same day, ie, 4 February 2005, the Plaintiff met with Dr Wong to show him her thesis and to ask him to sign the Thesis Submission Form. The conversation at the meeting turned to the Visualisation Project which the Plaintiff said was based on her work. I set out below the Plaintiff\u2019s version of what transpired, unless otherwise stated.', '16\\u2003The Plaintiff alleged that she asked Dr Wong how he was going to acknowledge her work in the Visualisation Project but Dr Wong turned hostile and defensive and accused her of not trusting him. Dr Wong said he had the right to use all the primary sources referenced in her thesis. This caused the Plaintiff concern as she was of the view that although the primary source documents were not created by her, she had assembled and compiled the data therein and interpreted the data. As Dr Wong had said to the Plaintiff that he had acknowledged the Plaintiff\u2019s contribution in the Grant Application Form, the Plaintiff asked Dr Wong to show her the portion of that form which contained that acknowledgment. However, Dr Wong declined to do so. To the Plaintiff, Dr Wong was being evasive and this suggested that he had lied to her about acknowledging her contribution in the Grant Application Form.', '17\\u2003Dr Wong told the Plaintiff that in view of her distrust of him, he could no longer consider her for the position of a research assistant.', '18\\u2003The meeting ended abruptly with Dr Wong leaving his office on a family errand and returning the Thesis Submission Form to the Plaintiff.', '19\\u2003When the Plaintiff learned that Dr Wong had not signed the form, she attempted to contact him. According to Dr Wong, he had left abruptly as he remembered he had to pick up his son at a primary school. He had not realised that he had not signed the Supervisor\u2019s Report Form. 3', 'Coming back to the Plaintiff\u2019s version, she and Dr Wong met again later at about 4pm and he signed the form and returned it to her. In view of the lateness of the hour, the Plaintiff could not get the signature of the head of department, HOD Heng, or his stand-in, that day on the form. The stand-in was Deputy HOD Bobby Wong. She did so on the following Monday, 7 February 2005 and submitted her thesis and the form on 7 February 2005, two days late. However, an extension of the deadline was granted to her.', '20\\u2003According to Registrar Ang, when the Plaintiff submitted her thesis, she orally requested the RO not to send her thesis for examination yet as she wanted to send a complaint about her supervisor. 4', '21\\u2003The Plaintiff believed that Dr Wong\u2019s omission to sign the form earlier on 4 February 2005 was deliberate and retaliatory. She was unhappy with what had transpired between Dr Wong and her on 4 February 2005.', '22\\u2003The Plaintiff said that in the four weeks after submitting her thesis on 7 February 2005, she learned that Dr Wong had not submitted the nomination of examiners for her thesis.', '23\\u2003The Plaintiff also said that from 17 February 2005, Ms Cheok, an administrative officer of the department, had repeatedly sought a copy of her thesis (or an abstract of her thesis) from her. The Plaintiff took the position that as she had already submitted three copies of the thesis to the RO on 7 February 2005, she was not obliged to hand over another copy to Ms Cheok. However, Ms Cheok continued to press for a copy.', '24\\u2003The Plaintiff said that the incident on 4 February 2005, Dr Wong\u2019s delay in nominating examiners and Ms Cheok\u2019s persistence in asking her for another copy of her thesis led her to conclude that there was a conflict of interest on Dr Wong\u2019s part between his duty as her supervisor and his personal interest in the Visualisation Project. I add that the question of obtaining another copy of the Plaintiff\u2019s thesis was eventually resolved.', '25\\u2003On 3 March 2005, the Plaintiff wrote to HOD Heng to complain about Dr Wong. She requested that Dr Wong be removed as her supervisor and that an independent committee outside the department be set up to select a new supervisor and that the new supervisor was to nominate the examiners for her thesis.', '26\\u2003The Plaintiff said that she asked for an independent committee to select a new supervisor because HOD Heng and Prof Chan Yew Lih were named as collaborators for the Visualisation Project and she wanted to remove all possibilities of bias.', '27\\u2003Eventually HOD Heng informed the Plaintiff on 12 March 2005 that he saw no reason to remove Dr Wong as her supervisor.', '28\\u2003The Plaintiff then wrote to Dean Cheong on 21 March 2005. She met with Dean Cheong and Vice-Dean Chew on 29 March 2005. From the Plaintiff\u2019s point of view, Dean Cheong belittled her concerns about Dr Wong at the meeting.', '29\\u2003In the meantime, the Plaintiff sent an email to Ms How of the RO to formally request the RO not to send her thesis for examination as yet. 5', 'On 29 March 2005, the Plaintiff sent another email to Ms How to request that the RO continue to hold onto her thesis instead of sending it for examination. 6', '30\\u2003On 1 April 2005, the Plaintiff sent an email to Dean Cheong to express her concerns about what had transpired at the meeting of 29 March 2005. She then decided to escalate the matter to VP Kong as she was of the view that Dean Cheong and the leadership of the school were closing ranks with the department and Dr Wong and that they were all trying to cover up Dr Wong\u2019s wrongdoing.', '31\\u2003On the same day, ie, 1 April 2005, the Plaintiff sent an email to VP Kong to seek a meeting with VP Kong. This resulted in an exchange of various emails between the Plaintiff and VP Kong between 1 April 2005 to 7 June 2005 in which VP Kong sought to understand the Plaintiff\u2019s concerns and the Plaintiff elaborated at some length. I will mention only the main emails between them.', '32\\u2003On 3 April 2005, the Plaintiff sent an email to VP Kong. 7', 'She said that:', '(a)\\u2003Her supervisor (meaning Dr Wong) had used the contents of her thesis to propose the Visualisation Project.', '(b)\\u2003On 4 February 2005 (wrongly stated as \u201c2004\u201d in the email), Dr Wong evaded her question as to how he was going to acknowledge her thesis in the project. Instead, he said that he had the right to use the primary sources from her work in the project because such sources did not belong to her.', '(c)\\u2003She could no longer trust Dr Wong. There was a conflict of interest between his duty as her supervisor and his interest in the project.', '(d)\\u2003She had written to the head of department for a change of supervisor and for an independent committee outside of the department to choose a new supervisor for her as the Head and Deputy Head of Administration were collaborators in the Visualisation Project. Her concerns had not been adequately considered by the head of department and the Dean.', '33\\u2003VP Kong replied on 8 April 2005 to summarise her understanding of the key issues. 8', 'These were:', '(a)\\u2003The Plaintiff had already submitted her thesis on 7 February 2005. Her request for a change of supervisor was not supported by the head of department nor the Dean.', '(b)\\u2003The Plaintiff was concerned that Dr Wong was using the primary sources which the Plaintiff had used for her thesis.', '(c)\\u2003There was no satisfactory response to her concerns.', '34\\u2003The Plaintiff replied to VP Kong on 11 April 2005. 9', 'She agreed with the issues listed by VP Kong but added other key issues. Essentially, she reiterated what she had said in her email of 3 April 2005. In particular, she repeatedly referred to the incident on 4 February 2005 when Dr Wong had said to her that he had the right to use the primary sources from her work. To her, Dr Wong was saying in essence that he was going to plagiarise the contents of her thesis.', '35\\u2003On 11 May 2005, VP Kong sent an email to the Plaintiff. 10', 'VP Kong said:', '(a)\\u2003There was no need to appoint another supervisor as the work of supervision was already done and the role of the supervisor may be considered to have ended.', '(b)\\u2003On the appointment of examiners, the head of department would make the recommendation to the faculty which then makes the appointment. In the present case, the Deputy Head (Research) had acted in place of the Head and the Vice-Dean and Dean had confirmed that the selection conformed to university expectations and the proposed examiners were qualified and had no connection with the Visualisation Project.', '(c)\\u2003After a thesis was examined, the outcome might be a straight pass or fail or there might be requirements for amendments. If amendments were required, VP Kong would ask the Registrar to work with the Vice-Dean and Dean and Deputy Head (Research) to identify another suitable individual to advise the Plaintiff.', '(d)\\u2003Should any individual substantially reproduce the contents of the Plaintiff\u2019s thesis, proper acknowledgement would have to be made. VP Kong would remind the faculty and all relevant individuals of this.', '36\\u2003This response was not satisfactory to the Plaintiff. She sent a lengthy email to VP Kong on 2 June 2005 to state her responses. 11', 'I summarise them below:', '(a)\\u2003She had made a complaint against Dr Wong in her earlier email of 11 April 2005. The complaint was about Dr Wong\u2019s unprofessionalism as a supervisor based on what he said on 4 February 2005 in that he had the right to use the primary sources that she had researched and assembled in her thesis. She alleged that Dr Wong had already used the contents of her thesis for the Visualisation Project. She noted that VP Kong\u2019s email did not mention anything about the issue of Dr Wong\u2019s unprofessionalism and what VP Kong\u2019s stand was on this issue.', '(b)\\u2003The Plaintiff did not agree that the role of a supervisor ended with the submission of the thesis. She gave a few examples:', '(c)\\u2003Although VP Kong had mentioned the process in which the examiners were selected, this was the process in theory. In reality, a supervisor like Dr Wong would nominate the examiners and the Department Head (or Deputy Head) would merely endorse the supervisor\u2019s nomination. The choice of examiners could make or break a thesis. Also, two of the persons comprising the faculty who were charged with the duty of approving the choice of examiners, ie, Dean Cheong and Vice-Dean Chew had (in the Plaintiff\u2019s view) demonstrated, based on their conduct during their meeting with her, that they were biased in favour of Dr Wong. As for the Deputy Head (Research), the Plaintiff gave some reasons why she had no confidence in him. She also took the view that he did not know enough about her thesis to be able to form an opinion about the suitability of examiners.', '(d)\\u2003As for VP Kong\u2019s assurance that she would remind the faculty and all relevant individuals to properly acknowledge any substantial reproduction of the Plaintiff\u2019s thesis, the Plaintiff stressed that Dr Wong had \u201calready used [her] work\u201d in his proposal for a grant for the Visualisation Project. She also said that Dr Wong \u201cmay have already plagiarised\u201d her thesis in his proposal.', '37\\u2003The Plaintiff ended her email by saying that VP Kong\u2019s proposal was unacceptable because she had no confidence in the thesis examination procedure as long as Dr Wong was involved. She also had reservations about Dean Cheong and Vice-Dean Chew who were biased in his favour. She had made a formal and official complaint about Dr Wong\u2019s unprofessionalism which VP Kong\u2019s last email did not address.', '38\\u2003VP Kong replied on 7 June 2005. 12', 'She said that since the Plaintiff had made a formal and official complaint against Dr Wong, NUS would convene an independent panel to investigate the matter. However, the investigation would necessarily result in delay in the examination of her thesis. If VP Kong did not hear from the Plaintiff by the end of 13 June 2005, VP Kong would assume that the Plaintiff understood the delay consequences.', '39\\u2003VP Kong and Registrar Ang met with the Plaintiff on 10 June 2005. According to the Plaintiff, VP Kong asked the Plaintiff to revert by 15 June 2005 on two options, ie, either to agree to the proposal mentioned in VP Kong\u2019s email of 11 May 2005 or the investigation mentioned in her email of 7 June 2005 would proceed. The Plaintiff said that she informed VP Kong by email on 13 June 2005 that she would not accept either option. 13', 'She elaborated in her affidavit of evidence-in-chief (\u201cAEIC\u201d) that the first option was not acceptable for the reasons stated in her reply dated 2 June 2005 and the second option was not acceptable because it was not clear to her what the terms of reference for the investigation were.', '40\\u2003In an email from the Plaintiff to VP Kong dated 17 June 2005 14', ', she said she did not understand what NUS was planning to investigate. She said that she had never said that Dr Wong had plagiarised her thesis. She emphasized that her complaint was what Dr Wong had said to her on 4 February 2005. Apparently, this was a reference to Dr Wong\u2019s statement that he could use the primary sources which she had researched and assembled in her thesis.', '41\\u2003On 20 June 2005, Ms Seah sent an email message from VP Kong to the Plaintiff. 15', 'The message said that all her email messages to date would constitute her complaints against Dr Wong. The message further mentioned that as there were contradictions between what the Plaintiff had said (in her last email of 17 June 2005) and her earlier emails, she might wish to clarify her position with the independent panel.', '42\\u2003The Plaintiff replied on 23 June 2005. She asked what VP Kong had meant by the Plaintiff\u2019s contradictions. She also asked other questions including who the members of the independent panel were. 16', '43\\u2003On 24 June 2005, Ms Lau sent VP Kong an email to say that she had checked with one Hilda who handled \u201cBoD\u201d (Board of Discipline) cases and that NUS did not disclose who the members of the board were. 17', '44\\u2003Also, on 24 June 2005, Ms Lau sent a letter to the Plaintiff to inform her that a COI had been set up to look into her concerns. 18', '45\\u2003The members of the COI were:', '46\\u2003The terms of reference were:', '(a)\\u2003to look into the allegation of unprofessionalism, and to establish, to the extent possible, the validity of this allegation;', '(b)\\u2003recommend to [NUS] the appropriate action to be taken, if any, arising from the findings of the inquiry, including the examination process.', '47\\u2003The above information is found in a letter dated 21 June 2005 from VP Kong to Dr Wong. 19', '48\\u2003Between 24 June and 30 June 2005, NUS sent emails and a letter to the Plaintiff to inform her that the COI would like to interview her on 7 July 2005 at 9.30am and gave her details of the venue. However, the Plaintiff was not given any information about the identities of the members of the COI or the terms of reference.', '49\\u2003On 2 July 2005, the Plaintiff sent an email to Ms Lau to raise various questions. 20', 'In her AEIC, she referred to these questions as her \u201cPreliminary Questions\u201d. I set out these questions as summarised at para 147 of her AEIC:', '50\\u2003Ms Lau replied on 4 July 2005 to ask the Plaintiff to raise her questions with the COI at the interview. 21', '51\\u2003The Plaintiff felt that her Preliminary Questions had been ignored. She said she was concerned that if she attended the COI she might have impliedly waived her right to object to the legitimacy and independence of the COI. 22', 'On 5 July 2005, she wrote to inform NUS that she would not attend the interview unless she received answers to her Preliminary Questions. 23', '52\\u2003On the same day, Prof Pinsler sent an email to the Plaintiff. 24', 'He introduced himself as the Chairman of the COI and urged the Plaintiff to attend the interview. When the Plaintiff informed Prof Pinsler that she wanted responses to the Preliminary Questions, Prof Pinsler suggested that the COI could respond to her questions at the interview. 25', 'This was not satisfactory to the Plaintiff as she wanted the answers before attending the interview. She did not attend the interview on 7 July 2005.', '53\\u2003On 11 July 2005, NUS sent an email to the Plaintiff to inform her that the COI was giving her one last opportunity to attend before the COI on 14 July 2005 at 9am. 26', 'However, as the Plaintiff still did not receive answers to the Preliminary Questions, she decided not to attend.', '54\\u2003The COI continued with its inquiry and issued its report on 20 July 2005. 27', 'The COI concluded that:', '(a)\\u2003there was no evidence that Dr Wong had plagiarised the Plaintiff\u2019s work. Dr Wong\u2019s application for a grant had made sufficient reference to the Plaintiff\u2019s expected contributions (even though the application did not expressly mention the Plaintiff\u2019s name);', '(b)\\u2003Dr Wong had failed to comply fully with his duties as a supervisor (of the Plaintiff); and', '(c)\\u2003the appointments of the two nominated examiners, ie, Prof Clancey and Prof Li should be confirmed. VP Kong\u2019s proposed process of examination of the Plaintiff\u2019s thesis was fair and just and should be confirmed.', '55\\u2003I note that the Abstract section of the Grant Application Form contained a statement that the Principal Investigator (meaning Dr Wong) was \u201cpresently supervising a Masters\u2019 candidate in the historical study of this area; the work is close to a first draft. In Annex A of the Grant Application Form, under Manpower Costs, there was a similar statement, \u201cIt is most opportune that one of [Dr Wong\u2019s] supervisees is close to completing her master\u2019s study of the development of this site\u201d. Therefore, even though the Plaintiff\u2019s name was not specifically mentioned in the Grant Application Form, it was clear that Dr Wong was referring to her. As far as that form was concerned, Dr Wong was not trying to claim credit for her work.', '56\\u2003It is also useful to stress here that as the COI had concluded that there was no evidence that Dr Wong had plagiarised the Plaintiff\u2019s work, the COI\u2019s conclusion that Dr Wong had failed to fully comply with his duties as the Plaintiff\u2019s supervisor was based on reasons other than any alleged plagiarism of the Plaintiff\u2019s work. It is not necessary for me to elaborate on those other reasons.', '57\\u2003The COI also recommended that Dr Wong be censured for the manner in which he had supervised the Plaintiff and that appropriate steps be taken to ensure that Dr Wong is fully aware of the role and duties of a supervisor to his student.', '58\\u2003The Plaintiff was not provided with a copy of the COI report at that time. Instead, VP Kong wrote to her on 3 August 2005 28', 'to inform her that:', '(a)\\u2003The COI had resolved that there was insufficient evidence to establish that Dr Wong acted unethically. It had also resolved that the examiners were properly appointed and could be trusted to be impartial and professional. The examination of her thesis might proceed.', '(b)\\u2003However, in view of the Plaintiff\u2019s tremendous dissatisfaction with the supervision received, NUS was prepared to take the additional step of offering her supervision under a different individual for one more semester before the thesis was sent for examination. This was an alternative if she did not wish to proceed with the examination then.', 'VP Kong asked the Plaintiff to respond to her letter of 3 August 2005 by 12 August 2005.', '59\\u2003I would mention here that VP Kong\u2019s summary omitted to mention that the COI had also concluded that Dr Wong had failed to comply fully with his duties as a supervisor. The Plaintiff learned about this omission after she commenced her action and she sought to make something of the omission in the action.', '60\\u2003The Plaintiff replied on 12 August 2005 to VP Kong. 29', 'She alleged that there was no transparency in the \u201cinvestigation\u201d as till then she still did not know the names of the other two members of the COI. She did not accept that there was insufficient evidence about Dr Wong\u2019s misconduct as she had previously stressed what Dr Wong had said to her on 4 February 2005. She said that Dr Wong\u2019s minimal and token supervision was not the reason for her complaint but what he had told her on 4 February 2005. She rejected the alternative of having someone else be appointed as a supervisor and the extension of her candidature as she felt she would then be penalised to work another semester because of Dr Wong. She maintained that Dr Wong should be removed as her supervisor and a new supervisor be appointed to help her with the post submission phase and for examiners to be appointed without any influence from Dr Wong.', '61\\u2003VP Kong replied to the Plaintiff on 18 August 2005. 30', 'She said that the Plaintiff had been invited twice to meet with the COI but she did not appear. From the Plaintiff\u2019s own messages, she had indicated that she was dissatisfied with the quality of Dr Wong\u2019s supervision and unethical behaviour in the form of plagiarism. The COI had looked into both issues.', '62\\u2003On the question of insufficient evidence about Dr Wong\u2019s unethical conduct, the COI had concluded that the reference in the application for a research grant to the work of a Master\u2019s candidate was sufficient acknowledgement of her thesis.

Yet, the Plaintiff said that she re-sent the 27 November 2005 email to VP Kong on 31 December 2005, notwithstanding that she must have known by then about the successful outcome of the examination. She said she did so because she had not received any response from VP Kong to her 27 November 2005 email. VP Kong then replied on 31 December 2005 to say that NUS\u2019 position had been explained to the Plaintiff and due process had been observed. VP Kong said she would not be responding further to the Plaintiff. The progress on the examination of the Plaintiff\u2019s thesis had been communicated to the Plaintiff. VP Kong suggested that the Plaintiff focus on extended revision deadlines.', '70\\u2003Notwithstanding VP Kong\u2019s email that she would not be responding further to the Plaintiff, the Plaintiff sent reminders to VP Kong for a substantive response to her email dated 27 November 2005.

Neither did she sign and submit Form RO.85 for reasons which I will elaborate on later.', '73\\u2003The Plaintiff alleged that upon reviewing Form RO.85, she realised that the level of public access to her thesis had to be indicated. Furthermore, clause 2 of Form RO.85 required her to grant a perpetual, royalty-free and transferable licence to NUS to reproduce her thesis in all forms and media. In the light of her issues with Dr Wong, she was afraid that if she signed Form RO.85, Dr Wong could gain easy access to and use her thesis for the Visualisation Project without giving her proper acknowledgement. 38', '74\\u2003The Plaintiff said she raised her concerns with Prof Li who passed her concerns to Ms Lau.

Interim judgment for divorce was granted in December 2013, and the parties\u2019 appeals relating to ancillary matters were disposed of in May 2016 (see TDT v TDS and another appeal [2016] 4 SLR 145). This present suit was commenced in July 2011, but was stayed in January 2014 pending the resolution of the parties\u2019 appeals relating to their divorce.', '6\\u2003 The present claim arose out of a business opportunity involving a contract with 7-Eleven for the supply of mashed potato machines. The plaintiff had provided maintenance services to 7-Eleven\u2019s mashed potato machines since 2008, when these machines were supplied by Nestl\u00e9 Singapore together with the powdered ingredients for the mashed potato food product sold at 7-Eleven outlets. In 2009, Nestl\u00e9 decided to stop supplying the machines and sold all its existing machines to 7-Eleven for a token sum. As such, 7-Eleven had to source for a new supplier to replace its existing machines as each one reached the end of its life cycle. The plaintiff company had some spare parts with which to maintain the existing machines, but it soon became apparent that a more sustainable solution was required.', '7\\u2003Hence, sometime in 2009, 7-Eleven\u2019s manager Mr Lim Jit Sing (\u201cLim\u201d) discussed with the defendant the possibility of having the plaintiff company supply 7-Eleven with new mashed potato machines. The defendant then spoke to the third party about this business opportunity, and the third party expressed interest for the plaintiff to take up the opportunity, especially since it meant that the plaintiff would be able to continue profiting from the maintenance contract with 7-Eleven. The defendant subsequently sourced for machines from China, together with another employee Eric Zhou (\u201cEric\u201d), and obtained quotations from three different Chinese suppliers \u2013 Bianchi, FLZD and Happy Line.', '8\\u2003What happened after that is in serious dispute between the parties, but it is clear that on or around 15 July 2010, Lim sent the defendant an email requesting the plaintiff to arrange to install and demonstrate one mashed potato machine by the next week.

The parties agree that it was the third party\u2019s instruction for this purchase order to be obtained before the plaintiff company committed to purchasing the mashed potato machines from their sourced supplier. Subsequently, between September 2010 and May 2011, mashed potato machines were supplied to 7-Eleven by Stellar Corporate Management Pte Ltd (\u201cSCM\u201d), a company controlled by the defendant.

This provides that the parties agreed for the agreement to be governed by the laws of Hong Kong and to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Hong Kong.', '13\\u2003Given the broad range and numerous issues raised, it is convenient to set out a brief overview of Mr Leiman\u2019s background and his entry into Noble in 2005 before going into a more detailed discussion of the evidence.', '14\\u2003Mr Leiman\u2019s career has mostly been in what might be loosely referred to as commodity trading in the area of agricultural and related products and services. Previous companies he worked for include: 12', '15\\u2003It was when Mr Leiman joined Louis Dreyfus in 1987 that he first met a Mr Ferdinando Carlier (\u201cMr Carlier\u201d) and a Mr Ozeias Silva de Oliveira (\u201cMr Ozeias\u201d) (collectively, \u201cMessrs Carlier and Ozeias\u201d). At that time, they were senior to Mr Leiman. 13', 'Shortly after Mr Leiman left Louis Dreyfus for Continental Grain, Messrs Carlier and Ozeias founded Eximcoop together with several Brazilian cooperatives. 14', 'One year later in 1991, the three were reunited when Mr Leiman joined Eximcoop.', '16\\u2003In 1998, shortly after the Asian Financial Crisis, Eximcoop ran into financial difficulties. As a result, negotiations commenced with the Itochu Group (\u201cItochu\u201d), a potential investor from Japan. At or around the same time, serious problems arose in respect of a contract and bill of lading involving Continental Grain. These involved allegations of improper or irregular discharge and delivery of cargo without proper bills of lading and or shipping documents which could expose Eximcoop to an allegation of fraud. Whilst Mr Leiman does not appear to be directly involved in the shipment and bills of lading, it appears he was asked by Eximcoop to assist in resolving the problem. 15', '17\\u2003On 2 February 1999, Itochu purchased 51% of the shares in Eximcoop. 16', 'In October 1999, Eximcoop was declared insolvent and Mr Ozeias was dismissed from Eximcoop. This was followed by the dismissal of Mr Carlier in December 1999 for mismanagement 17', 'I pause to note that Mr Carlier denies mismanagement and brought proceedings in Brazil against Eximcoop for wrongful dismissal. 18', '18\\u2003After their departures from Eximcoop, Messrs Carlier and Ozeias incorporated Agricole \u2013 Agricultura, Comercio, Logistica e Exportacao Ltda (\u201cAgricole\u201d), a grain trading company in Brazil. 19', 'Agricole did work relating to the purchase and sale of soybeans and soymeal for a company called Alliance Grain Inc. Agricole\u2019s contract with Alliance Grain Inc was subsequently terminated and its business was transferred to Conagra, another Brazilian company, which was run at the time by a Mr Thomas Daetwyler (\u201cMr Daetwyler\u201d) and a Mr Jose Kfuri (\u201cMr Kfuri\u201d). Subsequently, Mr Daetwyler and Mr Kfuri joined Noble\u2019s grain business in Brazil as its managing director and trader respectively. 20', '19\\u2003In brief, what followed were protracted legal proceedings between Eximcoop and Messrs Carlier and Ozeias. Legal issues also arose in respect of Agricole. On top of this, a legal dispute arose between Itochu and Eximcoop in connection with the purchase of Eximcoop\u2019s shares. Indeed, it is apparent that various related legal proceedings ran from 2000 all the way to around 2006 and beyond, including investigations by the Brazilian tax authorities for tax offences. 21', '20\\u2003The significance of the difficulties at Eximcoop, the Itochu litigation, the tax investigation and so on will be examined in more detail later. The general point is that the period from 1997 to 2000 was clearly difficult for Messrs Carlier and Ozeias. Not only had Eximcoop run into financial problems, there were problems with the Continental Grain dispute, the Itochu litigation and the Brazilian tax authorities\u2019 investigations. Whilst Mr Leiman was included in an initial complaint for tax offences he was never convicted or even charged with an offence. On the other hand, Mr Carlier was indicted on 23 June 2003 and convicted on 25 June 2007. Mr Carlier\u2019s appeal against his conviction was eventually dismissed by the Brazilian Federal Court in January 2010. 22', '21\\u2003Between 2000 and 2002, Mr Leiman was working outside of the commodities trading industry. His evidence is that he did not have much contact with Messrs Carlier and Ozeias during this time. In 2002, Mr Leiman made a successful return to the commodities trading industry as he was appointed COO of Louis Dreyfus. His evidence is that between 2002 and the end of 2005, whilst he remained in touch with Messrs Carlier and Ozeias, there was little direct contact and he was unaware of the details of the unresolved legal problems regarding Eximcoop, Itochu and the tax investigations. I pause to comment that whilst Mr Leiman tried to play down the closeness of his relationship with Messrs Carlier and Ozeias, I have no doubt that they were good friends. 23', '22\\u2003These were the prevailing circumstances at the time when Mr Leiman joined NRL to serve as COO of NGL on 6 December 2005. As will be seen (at [180] below), at or around the time Mr Leiman joined NRL, he facilitated the recruitment of Messrs Carlier and Ozeias into Noble Brasil SA (\u201cNoble Brazil\u201d). Leaving aside the details for the moment (many of which are disputed), Messrs Carlier and Ozeias were brought in by Mr Leiman to assist on a specific mission Mr Leiman was undertaking for Noble, namely, the operation of Noble\u2019s newly-acquired sugar mill in Brazil and sugar commodity trading. The question whether Mr Leiman concealed his relationship with Messrs Carlier and Ozeias and their legal problems and proceedings (summarised above) is a matter in dispute, and relates to the defendants\u2019 assertion that Mr Leiman was in breach of his duties to Noble by failing to make proper disclosures. The defendants also complain that Mr Leiman recruited his friends and former colleagues into Noble Brazil to manage and run the sugar mill business when they did not have the necessary experience in sugar mill operations. On the other hand, there is also a dispute as to whether Noble conducted a proper due diligence check on Mr Leiman and Messrs Carlier and Ozeias, and whether it had sufficient information to at least be put on notice as to Messrs Carlier and Ozeias\u2019s backgrounds and legal problems. I will return to address these factual disputes later.', '23\\u2003Although the parties dispute the precise circumstances that led to Mr Leiman\u2019s departure from NRL, it suffices to say that in or about mid-2011, there were disagreements between Mr Leiman and Mr Elman which resulted in the former\u2019s resignation at the end of October 2011. 24', 'In brief, according to Mr Leiman, he decided to leave NRL because he was unhappy with Mr Elman\u2019s interference with the performance of his duties as CEO. Mr Leiman also alleged that he was \u201cincreasingly concerned with Noble\u2019s intention to adopt questionable accounting practices and how [Mr Elman] was prepared to compromise on proper corporate governance in dealing with Noble\u2019s disclosure obligations.\u201d 25', '24\\u2003On the other hand, according to the defendants and Mr Elman, they had \u201cserious concerns about [Mr Leiman\u2019s] integrity and suitability to continue as CEO of Noble\u201d. They allege that Mr Leiman had: (a) given instructions to fire the entire board of a Noble subsidiary, Gloucester Coal Ltd, but later irreverently and flatly denied doing so; (b) represented to other senior staff of Noble that he had the approval of the board to conduct certain trades in sugar and cadmium when he did not; 26', 'and (c) failed to observe Noble\u2019s internal protocols before approving amendments that were made to the agreement concerning the purchase of two sugar mills in 2011. 27', '25\\u2003In any case, plans for Mr Leiman\u2019s exit from Noble started to take shape around late 2011. After Mr Leiman informed Mr Elman of his intention to resign, there were discussions on the arrangements for his departure, including the matter of Mr Leiman\u2019s entitlements. According to Mr Leiman, Mr Elman assured him that his entitlements would be honoured, and this was followed by a similar assurance from Mr Rubin around 10 to 11 November 2011. 28', 'The entitlements concern the shares and share options that had been awarded to Mr Leiman under the Share Option Scheme and the AIP over the past years and which (by and large) he had assigned\/transferred to the Adelaide Trust. As will be seen, the number of shares and share options is substantial. The defendants do not agree that any such assurances or representations were provided or made to Mr Leiman.', '26\\u2003What is not in dispute is that Mr Leiman and Mr Alam negotiated and exchanged drafts of a settlement agreement (\u201cthe Settlement Agreement\u201d) and an advisory agreement (\u201cthe Advisory Agreement\u201d) over e-mail. 29', 'On 9 November 2011, Mr Leiman and NRL entered into the Settlement Agreement and the Advisory Agreement, which were to take effect on 1 December 2011. 30', '27\\u2003The Settlement Agreement contains the terms of Mr Leiman\u2019s resignation from NRL and his severance benefits. Its preamble specifically states that NRL and Mr Leiman agreed that the employment would cease on 1 December 2011 (the effective date). Leaving aside for the moment Mr Leiman\u2019s severance payments and benefits, some of the key provisions in the Settlement Agreement are, in brief, as follows: 31', '(a)\\u2003As of the effective date, Mr Leiman resigned from all his positions as an officer or board member of any subsidiaries or affiliates of Noble.', '(b)\\u2003Mr Leiman was not required to report for work at Noble\u2019s headquarters after the effective date.', '(c)\\u2003NRL would continue to pay Mr Leiman his base salary through the effective date and for six months thereafter as \u201cnotice period payments\u201d.', '(d)\\u2003 The duration of the non-competition clause of the Employment Agreement was amended such that Mr Leiman would be restricted from competing with NRL as long as the Advisory Agreement remained in force, or for nine months from the effective date, whichever is longer.', '(e)\\u2003The Settlement Agreement set forth the entire agreement of NRL and Mr Leiman and superseded the Employment Agreement in its entirety except as specifically provided.', '(f)\\u2003The governing law was Singapore law and both parties agreed to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the Singapore courts.', '28\\u2003Clauses 3(c) to (e) of the Settlement Agreement relate to his shareholding and his bonus for 2011 (\u201cthe 2011 Bonus\u201d), and they read as follows: 32', '29\\u2003Pursuant to the Advisory Agreement, Mr Leiman became an advisor of NRL and was to be paid a retainer fee of US$350,000 per year for his advisory services relating to commodities supply chain management. The preamble to the Advisory Agreement states that Mr Leiman \u201cwishes to perform advisory services for [NRL]\u201d and makes express reference to NRL\u2019s desire to benefit from Mr Leiman\u2019s extensive experience in commodities supply chain management. 33', '30\\u2003I observe that even though Noble was parting company with Mr Leiman, Mr Elman and NRL evidently still valued Mr Leiman\u2019s knowledge, experience and ability in commodities supply chain management. I note the annual retainer fee was the same as the salary provided for in Mr Leiman\u2019s original employment contract of 2005 (see [12(b)] above). Furthermore, under the Settlement Agreement, Mr Leiman was to be paid for six months at the same rate as he was under the Employment Agreement (see [27(c)] above).', '31\\u2003The term of the Advisory Agreement was set at a minimum of nine months, renewable on mutual agreement. The Advisory Agreement contained another non-competition clause under which Mr Leiman represented that he did \u201cnot have any agreement to provide [advisory services] to any other party, firm, or company and [would] not enter into any such agreement during the term of [the Advisory Agreement].\u201d', '32\\u2003NGL publicly announced Mr Leiman\u2019s resignation on 9 November 2011. 34', 'As of 1 December 2011, Mr Leiman ceased to be CEO of NGL and thereafter was no longer involved in meetings of the R&O Committee. 35', '33\\u2003On 21 December 2011, Mr Peter Stephan Koenig (\u201cMr Koenig\u201d), the Senior Trust Manager of Rothschild Trust (Switzerland) Ltd (which is a company related to Rothschild Trust), informed NGL of Mr Leiman\u2019s intention to use a cashless facility to exercise his share options in NGL. Mr Alam subsequently replied by e-mail stating that as a significant employee shareholder, Mr Leiman should be instructed not to sell his shares or use the cashless facility. Further e-mail correspondence between Mr Alam, Mr Koenig and Mr Leiman ensued, in which Mr Alam continued to deny Rothschild Trust\u2019s attempt to exercise the share options. Finally, in response to a query from Mr Leiman regarding the basis and duration of the trading ban, Mr Alam stated in an e-mail on 1 February 2012 that the trading ban would be lifted on 28 February 2012, and that Mr Leiman would be given approval to sell up to five million shares at that time. 36', '34\\u2003In the meantime, unbeknownst to Mr Leiman, Noble had hired a private investigator (\u201cthe PI\u201d) to keep watch on his activities, in order to find out whether Mr Leiman was attempting to set up a business that would compete with Noble. 37', 'The PI\u2019s reports to Noble revealed that Mr Leiman met up with a number of current and former Noble employees between late 2011 and early 2012, including Mr Elliott Spitz (\u201cMr Spitz\u201d) who was an advisor to Noble at the time, and Mr Kenneth Courtis (\u201cMr Courtis\u201d) who was a former director of NGL. 38', '35\\u2003The PI also found e-mail printouts in Mr Leiman\u2019s garbage bin outside his home in England. These e-mails indicated that Mr Leiman was in discussions with Mr Alexander Vinokurov (\u201cMr Vinokurov\u201d), the President and CEO of a company named Summa Capital. Summa Capital is part of the Summa Group, which was one of Noble\u2019s business and strategic partners. In an e-mail from Mr Leiman dated 16 February 2012 titled \u201cBTG\u201d, he told Mr Vinokurov that he had spent two days in Brazil with the CEO and partners of BTG Pactual, a Brazilian financial investment management company. The e-mail added: 39', 'I note that Noble places much emphasis on the part of the e-mail where Mr Leiman mentions the possibility of building BTG Pactual \u201cinto the new Glencore\u201d. Glencore plc (\u201cGlencore\u201d) is said to be one of the largest commodities trading companies in the world. 40', '36\\u2003In early February 2012, Mr Alam, on behalf of Noble, engaged Wolfe Associates to conduct an investigation into Mr Leiman. Wolfe Associates is a boutique consulting firm which is helmed by Mr Barry Wolfe (\u201cMr Wolfe\u201d) and specialises in, among other things, uncovering corporate crime through investigative work. 41', '37\\u2003This was not the first time that Noble had engaged Wolfe Associates. Previously in 2008, Wolfe Associates had prepared a confidential memorandum (\u201cthe 2008 Wolfe Memo\u201d) for Noble in relation to certain investigations it had conducted in Brazil which I will discuss later. 42', 'For now, it is sufficient to note that the 2008 Wolfe Memo was prepared shortly after Mr Leiman was employed by NRL. It concerned the relationship between Mr Leiman and Messrs Carlier and Ozeias and the possibility of impropriety in respect of certain matters at or concerning Continental Grain and Eximcoop. 43', 'Whilst the 2008 Wolfe Memo raised some red flags, it does not appear that any action was taken by NRL at the time the memorandum was produced.', '38\\u2003The engagement of Wolfe Associates in 2012 was for the purpose of conducting a further enquiry into certain matters contained in the 2008 Wolfe Memo concerning Mr Leiman\u2019s relationship and dealings with Messrs Carlier and Ozeias. It is apparent that the ultimate purpose of the further investigation into these matters was to ascertain whether there were any breaches of duty owed to NRL by Mr Leiman in respect of these matters. 44', '39\\u2003Wolfe Associates submitted a preliminary report to Mr Alam on 23 February 2012 and an updated draft on 26 March 2012. The report continued to be amended until the final version was later submitted in April 2014. 45', 'I will generally refer to this report along with its draft versions as \u201cthe 2012 Wolfe Report\u201d. It is a lengthy report. It will suffice to summarise some of the key points here:', '(a)\\u2003The 2012 Wolfe Report mentions at the outset that Wolfe Associates was \u201cinstructed to investigate whether there exists evidence that [Mr Leiman] acted to the detriment of Noble and\/or in breach of his fiduciary duty, specifically in relation to the employment of [Messrs Carlier and Ozeias] by Noble and the relationship between [Mr Leiman], on the one hand, and [Messrs Carlier and Ozeias], on the other hand, while employed by Noble.\u201d 46', '(b)\\u2003In a nutshell, the 2012 Wolfe Report states that Messrs Carlier and Ozeias had fraudulently mismanaged Eximcoop and fraudulently misrepresented its financial situation to Itochu so as to induce it to acquire Eximcoop in 1998, and that Mr Leiman had knowingly participated in these schemes. Messrs Carlier and Ozeias were also involved in a separate case of fraud, conspiracy and racketeering arising from their business in Agricole. The findings of the 2012 Wolfe Report were based on the Brazilian court files for the numerous legal proceedings that arose out of the Eximcoop and Agricole affairs. 47', 'Further, a criminal complaint was made to the Brazilian prosecution in 2000 requesting investigation on a number of persons including Mr Leiman and Messrs Carlier and Ozeias for tax evasion and money laundering. Mr Carlier was formally indicted in 2003 for not declaring funds he had received abroad, and was later convicted in 2007. 48', '(c)\\u2003The 2012 Wolfe Report noted that despite Mr Leiman\u2019s knowledge of these matters \u2013 and in respect of the Eximcoop matters, his participation \u2013 he instructed Noble\u2019s hiring of Messrs Carlier and Ozeias and made them responsible for running Noble\u2019s newly acquired sugar mill notwithstanding their lack of knowledge and experience in the field. The report found that Mr Leiman had made misrepresentations to Mr Elman to the effect that Messrs Carlier and Ozeias were experienced, knowledgeable, competent and trustworthy, and that the allegations made by Itochu against them were false, just so that they could be hired by Noble to run the sugar mill. The matters surrounding the subsequent \u201cmanagement failures\u201d of this sugar mill and the considerable losses it caused to Noble were mentioned in the 2008 Wolfe Memo, as noted at [37] above. 49', '40\\u2003On 28 February 2012, the date on which Mr Leiman expected the trading ban on his shares to be lifted according to Mr Alam\u2019s earlier representations (see [33] above), Mr Alam instead sent Mr Leiman an e-mail stating that Mr Leiman was not entitled to use the cashless facility to exercise and sell his share options. 50', 'The next day, Mr Koenig sent NGL an e-mail stating that Rothschild Trust would proceed with the exercise of five million share options without using the cashless facility, and transfer the price of $3.4m to NGL accordingly.', '41\\u2003Shortly afterwards on that same day, Mr Alam e-mailed the R&O Committee stating that NGL had received Mr Leiman\u2019s notice to exercise his five million share options. Apart from the notice, Mr Alam\u2019s e-mail also enclosed several documents which he described as \u201crather disturbing information and documentation\u201d which Mr Elman had asked him to share with the R&O Committee, namely: 51', '42\\u2003 The R&O Committee convened on 1 March 2012. Committee members Mr Elman, Mr Rubin and Mr Chan were all present, as well as Mr Alam and Noble\u2019s Director of Human Resources, Ms Leila Konyn (\u201cMs Konyn\u201d), who were invited to attend. The existing draft of the 2012 Wolfe Report and copies of Mr Leiman\u2019s e-mails with Summa Capital were tabled before the R&O Committee. The R&O Committee unanimously resolved to refuse to approve Mr Leiman\u2019s\/Rothschild Trust\u2019s exercise of the share options. 52', '43\\u2003Following the meeting, Mr Alam proceeded to convey the decision of the R&O Committee to Mr Koenig via e-mail. 53', 'Representatives of Rothschild Trust replied by letter on 7 March 2012, stating that the five million share options had vested and there were no grounds upon which the R&O Committee could refuse the request to exercise the share options. The letter requested that the R&O Committee furnish Rothschild Trust with written grounds for its refusal.', '44\\u2003On 12 March 2012, Mr Alam e-mailed Mr Koenig to inform him that the R&O Committee would reconvene to review its decision. 54', 'In the interim, Rothschild Trust was given the green light to sell the remaining 900,589 NGL shares held in the Adelaide Trust. 55', '45\\u2003The R&O Committee affirmed its decision on 27 March 2012. 56', 'In a letter to Rothschild Trust, Mr Alam explained that the right to exercise the share options (which was conferred in the Settlement Agreement) was conditional on Mr Leiman not \u201cacting in any way to the detriment of Noble prior to exercise\u201d, and that the R&O Committee considered that this condition had not been satisfied. Mr Alam\u2019s letter also referred to the following:', '(a)\\u2003Mr Leiman\u2019s actions in approaching clients, counterparties, advisors and Noble employees and former employees with a view to setting up a competitor to Noble; and', '(b)\\u2003 Without naming Messrs Carlier and Ozeias specifically, that Mr Leiman had appointed certain persons to run Noble\u2019s sugar mills from 2006 despite their participation in \u201cfraudulent conduct at a previous employer\u201d and lack of expertise in the sugar and ethanol business. 57', '46\\u2003On 3 April 2012, Mr Koenig e-mailed Mr Alam requesting a status update regarding 11,098,782 NGL shares and 7,727,272 share options which were held in the Adelaide Trust and which had recently vested on 31 March 2012 and 2 April 2012 respectively. 58', 'Mr Alam replied by way of a letter dated 10 April 2012 stating that the vesting of these shares and share options were subject to the same conditions as the exercise of the other five million share options, thus Mr Leiman was not entitled to them in view of the fact that he had acted to the detriment of Noble. 59', 'In other words, the R&O Committee\u2019s decision was to cover these newly-vested shares and share options as well. On 26 April 2012, Mr Alam sent a letter to Rothschild Trust further clarifying that the R&O Committee\u2019s decision also applied to another lot of 5,652,421 shares that had previously been awarded to Mr Leiman. 60', '47\\u2003To summarise, the NGL share options that are the subject of this action (\u201cthe Share Options\u201d) are set out in the following table. All of these options are held in the Adelaide Trust.', '48\\u2003The NGL shares that are the subject of this action (\u201cthe Shares\u201d) are as follows: 61', 'Out of these shares, only the shares awarded on 4 May 2011 (totalling 5,652,421 shares) are held by Mr Leiman himself, while the remaining shares are held in the Adelaide Trust.', '49\\u2003In response to an earlier enquiry from Mr Leiman about the payment of the 2011 Bonus, Mr Alam e-mailed Mr Leiman on 3 May 2012 stating that the R&O Committee had decided that no discretionary bonus was to be awarded to Mr Leiman for 2011. Mr Leiman responded on 8 May 2012 asking Mr Alam to check with Mr Elman, as they \u201chad an understanding that [Mr Leiman] would be receiving such a bonus\u201d. 62', 'Mr Leiman was ultimately not given the 2011 Bonus.', '50\\u2003The nine-month term provided in the Advisory Agreement expired on 1 August 2012. Following that, Mr Leiman became a consultant at a Brazilian investment bank, BTG Pactual, in October 2012, and joined BTG Pactual as a partner in March 2013. 63', '51\\u2003Mr Leiman commenced the present action against NRL on 11 May 2012, and Rothschild Trust and NGL were later added as the 2nd plaintiff and the 2nd defendant respectively. 64', 'The plaintiffs seek the following relief: 65', '52\\u2003NRL counterclaims the following relief: 66', '53\\u2003Although the defendants initially pleaded that the Settlement Agreement and the Advisory Agreement are void for fraudulent misrepresentation and\/or mistake, they are no longer pursuing this plea. 67', 'The counterclaim also includes other prayers, namely: 68', '54\\u2003I heard the trial over 18 days in July and August 2017. The plaintiffs called five witnesses, namely, Mr Leiman, Mr Koenig, Mr Courtis, Mr Carlier and Mr Ozeias. The defendants called six witnesses, namely, Mr Elman, Mr Rubin, Mr Chan, Mr Alam, Mr Wolfe and the PI, Mr Russell Bradley. I simply note for now that much was said by the defendants about the veracity of the testimony given by Mr Leiman and the other witnesses for the plaintiffs, and I will go into my findings regarding the witnesses\u2019 evidence in greater detail below when discussing the relevant issues in which these points arise.'"}

The following overview is based on the evidence and submissions put before the court.', '8\\u2003FCVA technology, put simply, is a method of coating materials or products with a thin film of metallic, ceramic or composite substances. 18', 'For example, the technology can be used to coat articles with a thin film of diamond-like carbon particles, known as tetrahedral amorphous carbon, to reduce friction and prolong the life of the article. 19', 'The general technology has been known for quite a long time and appears to date back to technology developed in the Soviet Union before the 1980s. 20', 'Cathodic vacuum arc technology, when first developed, apparently did not incorporate a filter. 21', 'Thereafter, filters of various shapes were used. 22', 'Eventually the plaintiff developed its version of FCVA technology which uses a \u201cdouble bend filter\u201d, together with some other improvements, the details of which are unnecessary for present purposes. 23', '9\\u2003FCVA technology comprises hardware and software. For the purposes of this case, the hardware is essentially a \u201cmachine\u201d made from various components such as a power supply, circuit boards, various types of valves, vacuum pumps, filters amongst other things. 24', 'The software used in the control panel is concerned with the carrying out of the various processes involved in FCVA coating. 25', '10\\u2003Whilst the plaintiff asserts that it has obtained numerous patents over its FCVA technology, 26', 'I note that the plaintiff does not in this case rely on any patents or registered design rights. 27', 'Indeed, it is not clear whether there are any relevant patents which are still in force over FCVA technology. 28', '11\\u2003What is clear is that some, possibly many, hardware components of the FCVA machine are available from various original equipment manufacturers (\u201cOEM\u201d). 29', 'In a sense, some of the components are generic components that could be used in a variety of different types of machines serving the same, similar or even different purposes. On the other hand, some components might be developed \u201cin-house\u201d by the plaintiff, such as a valve with a particular shape and set of dimensions: the point being that advantages may arise from the particular shape. 30', '12\\u2003Whilst the evidence could have been clearer, it appears that although some parts or components of the plaintiff\u2019s FCVA machine are designed in-house for use in a generic FCVA machine, some components may be designed in accordance with the needs of particular customers. 31', 'FCVA machines can be made in different sizes and might be adjusted or tailored, so to speak, for particular types of coating applications. 32', '13\\u2003 In any event, it appears that some component parts would wear out or require servicing from time to time. 33', 'If the component had to be replaced, it stands to reason that the plaintiff would have to either (i) use a component from stock; (ii) order the relevant component from a third party manufacturer; or (iii) fabricate the component part itself.', '14\\u2003For completeness, I note Dr Wei Hao\u2019s evidence that the plaintiff\u2019s business comprises manufacturing and servicing their own machines. 34', 'Further, whilst the plaintiff\u2019s main business is in FCVA machines\/technology, Dr Wei Hao explains that they also make and supply more traditional and cheaper coating machines. 35', 'Indeed, the 2nd defendant in cross-examination agreed that the plaintiff sold different types of vacuum coating machines, including machines using something called a \u201csputter source\u201d, which appears to involve a different process from FCVA machines. 36', '15\\u2003The 3rd defendant had been working for the plaintiff for almost ten years at the time of his departure in early January 2008. 37', 'It is not disputed that, at the time of his departure, the 3rd defendant and the 2nd defendant had been colleagues for about eight years. 38', '16\\u2003After the 3rd defendant left in January 2008, the 2nd defendant remained a full-time employee of the plaintiff. 39', 'The 2nd defendant, together with the 3rd defendant, then \u201cset up\u201d the 1st defendant in 2008. 40', 'That said, I note that there is a dispute as to whether the 2nd and 3rd defendant jointly decided to set up the 1st defendant or whether the 3rd defendant persuaded the 2nd defendant to join him shortly after the 1st defendant was incorporated. This will be examined later. In any case, it is not disputed that the 2nd defendant became a director of the 1st defendant at or about the same time the 3rd defendant became the managing director of the 1st defendant. 41', '17\\u2003The plaintiff\u2019s basic case is that the 2nd defendant did not obtain the plaintiff\u2019s consent to become a director of the 1st defendant or to perform any work for the 1st defendant. 42', '18\\u2003The plaintiff alleges that, whilst in the employment of the plaintiff, the 2nd defendant created numerous technical drawings for the 1st defendant. 43', 'The technical drawings were created using the laptop and software (computer-aided design program (\u201cCAD\u201d)) provided by the plaintiff. 44', 'The laptop had been provided to the 2nd defendant because there was a period when he was required to travel overseas. 45', 'The plaintiff avers that some of the drawings were created during the plaintiff\u2019s official working hours. 46', 'Other drawings may have been created outside of office hours, using the plaintiff\u2019s laptop. 47', '19\\u2003I note that these technical drawings (the \u201cSemivac Drawings\u201d), which bore the 1st defendant\u2019s name, were recovered from the 2nd defendant\u2019s laptop with the assistance of Nexia TS Risk Advisory Pte Ltd (\u201cNexia\u201d), a computer forensics company. 48', 'Some 48 Semivac Drawings were recovered by Nexia. 49', '20\\u2003Nexia\u2019s report concluded that the 2nd defendant had in his possession technical drawings of the plaintiff (not drawn by the 2nd defendant), which were then changed\/modified for the first defendant\u2019s use. 50', 'The plaintiff\u2019s case is that, aside from these 48 Semivac Drawings, there were many more technical drawings which it was unable to recover from the laptop. 51', 'This is indeed likely, as the 3rd defendant under cross-examination agreed that the 1st defendant made more than just 48 Semivac Drawings. 52', '21\\u2003The plaintiff\u2019s case is that most of the Semivac Drawings were either unauthorised copies or adaptations of technical drawings belonging to the plaintiff. 53', 'The defendants\u2019 case essentially is that the majority of the Semivac Drawings were produced by the 2nd defendant without reference to any drawings in which the plaintiff can claim copyright. 54', 'That said, I note the 2nd defendant admits that four of the Semivac Drawings were created using the plaintiff\u2019s existing files; 55', 'ie, the 2nd defendant modified the plaintiff\u2019s files to create four of the Semivac Drawings.', '22\\u2003In addition, the plaintiff\u2019s case is that sometime between 2002 and 2007, the 1st defendant published a set of presentation slides (the \u201cSemivac Slides\u201d), which contained certain technical drawings, diagrams, photographs, and graphs. 56', 'The presentation slides were created for the purpose of showcasing a coating system referred to as Direct Cathodic Vacuum Arc (\u201cDCVA\u201d) system. 57', 'The technology involved in the FCVA and DCVA systems are said to be similar. 58', 'Indeed, the plaintiff\u2019s case is that the DCVA system is, to all intents and purposes, identical to the FCVA system. 59', '23\\u2003Whilst the plaintiff\u2019s case could have been clearer, it appears that the plaintiff basically complains of: 60', '24\\u2003By unlawful competition what is meant are the claims for copyright infringement, breach of contract, breach of confidence and inducing breach of contract. There is no claim for unfair competition or passing off. There is also no claim against the defendants for unauthorised copying of computer programs associated with the plaintiff\u2019s FCVA technology.', '25\\u2003The 2nd defendant asserts that although he was a director of the 1st defendant, he did not in fact do much work for the 1st defendant and that only a few design drawings were made by him for the 1st defendant. 61', 'The 3rd defendant goes on to deny that he had induced the 2nd defendant to become a director and to do work for the 1st defendant, in breach of the 2nd defendant\u2019s contractual duties to the plaintiff. 62', 'In particular, the 3rd defendant denies that he was aware or ought to have known that there were express contractual restrictions imposed on the 2nd defendant. 63', '26\\u2003The defendants also generally take the position that, in any case, the 1st defendant was not a competitor as such of the plaintiff. 64', 'It appears that by this what is meant is that:', '(a)\\u2003the plaintiff is not in the business of servicing and maintaining machines (aside from their own); 65', 'and', '(b)\\u2003the 1st defendant was not in any case involved in manufacturing FCVA machines. 66', 'Instead, the 1st defendant was interested in DCVA technology, a different technology used for producing thin film coatings on industrial products. 67', 'That said, the 3rd defendant admitted at trial that FCVA and DCVA technologies, even if not identical, are similar. 68', 'Indeed, the evidence suggests that some components needed in FCVA machines will also be needed in DCVA machines. 69', '27\\u2003 One other point worth underscoring at the outset is that there is no direct evidence from any customer of an actual purchase of a DCVA or FCVA machine from the 1st defendant. 70', 'Indeed, there is no direct evidence that the 1st defendant even has a DCVA machine in Singapore.', '28\\u2003Against this, the plaintiff rightly points out that the Semivac Slides referred to earlier includes a photograph of a DCVA Batch Vacuum Coating System machine. 71', 'The photograph naturally suggests that the 1st defendant had indeed built at least one DCVA machine. The 3rd defendant\u2019s evidence was that he prepared the Semivac Slides at the request of one \u201cMr Ho\u201d, who is said to be a director of Drachs Technology (S) Pte Ltd. 72', 'According to the 3rd defendant, Mr Ho wanted a technical briefing on coating technology. 73', 'The 3rd defendant asserts that he does not know what Mr Ho did with the slides and denies using them to make a presentation to a company called Seagate, in Thailand, for the 1st defendant. 74', '29\\u2003Unfortunately, there is no independent evidence to support the 3rd defendant\u2019s assertions. Mr Ho was not asked to give evidence. Further, when cross-examined, the 3rd defendant\u2019s evidence was that the photograph of the DCVA Batch Vacuum Coating System machine was found on the internet and simply taken and used in the Semivac Slides. 75', 'When questioned further, the 3rd defendant responded that he found the photograph by conducting an internet search using the name of a Chinese company, Guandong Naisense Coating Technology Ltd (\u201cNaisense\u201d), as the search term. 76', 'With respect, this is odd, especially as the 3rd defendant denied that he was a director of Naisense several times. 77', 'Why would he then use the name of that company as the search term? I note that the 3rd defendant ultimately changed his stance, after he was shown records indicating that he was indeed a director of Naisense. 78', 'The defendants in closing submissions, after noting that Naisense is a joint venture company between a Chinese company and a Singapore company called Topbond Technology International Pte Ltd (\u201cTopbond\u201d), merely state that \u201cthe 3rd Defendant appears to have been a director for a period of 3 years from 2012 which he was not aware of.\u201d 79', 'The 3rd defendant is both a director and shareholder of Topbond. 80', '30\\u2003Overall, I find the 3rd defendant\u2019s evidence on the Semivac Slides and his relationship to Naisense most unsatisfactory. Even though there is no evidence on how many DCVA machines the 1st defendant or 3rd defendant may be connected to, through Naisense or any other company, the point is that the 3rd defendant was most surely interested in producing DCVA machines and components. Indeed, the inference is strong: the 3rd defendant was knowingly concealing the link with Naisense.', '31\\u2003Four witnesses testified for the plaintiff: 81', '32\\u2003Two witnesses testified for the defendants: 82', '33\\u2003The defendants\u2019 Defence (Amendment No 2) mainly consists of a series of denials and non-admissions, as well as a number of averments.

There was no affirmative defence raised, whether based on the statutory provisions in the Copyright Act (Cap 63, 2006 Rev Ed) (\u201cCopyright Act\u201d) or at common law (such as an implied right of repair).', '35\\u2003During the course of the trial, Dr Wei Hao gave evidence for the plaintiff under cross-examination that more than 50 FCVA machines had been made and sold. 87', 'After hearing counsel in chambers, the defendants sought leave to amend the defence to add the useful article defence found in s 70 of the Copyright Act. 88', 'The relevance of the evidence that 50 machines were made to the useful article defence will be discussed later. Leave was granted after the plaintiff\u2019s counsel stated that there were no objections to the amendment. 89', 'Counsel for the plaintiff also stated that it would not be calling any witnesses or offering any further evidence in any case, and that it would not be seeking leave to amend their reply. 90', 'To complete the picture, I note that the defendants did not seek leave to recall the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses for cross-examination. Further, whilst the defendants addressed the useful article defence in closing submissions, I note that no submissions were made by the plaintiff.'"}
{"casename":"2018_SGHC_168","fact":"'5\\u2003The Client is a Singapore-incorporated company dealing with, amongst other things, the trading and sale of iron ore to buyers in the People\u2019s Republic of China. 9', '6\\u2003This dispute arose in the aftermath of various SIAC arbitrations in which the Client was involved. The Disputed Invoices were issued by the Firm to the Client solely in respect of the work it did for the Client in SIAC arbitration number 123 of 2010 (\u201cSIAC 123\u201d). The Client had commenced SIAC 123 on 25 June 2010 against Metalloyd Ltd (\u201cMetalloyd\u201d). The details of the dispute in SIAC 123 are irrelevant for the present purposes. Suffice to say that the award for SIAC 123 (\u201cthe 123 Award\u201d) was eventually rendered on 2 January 2014 in favour of the Client. 10', '7\\u2003Thereafter, the Client engaged the Firm on or about 15 January 2014 to enforce the 123 Award in Singapore and in the United Kingdom (\u201cthe 123 Award Enforcement Proceedings\u201d). The 123 Award Enforcement Proceedings were effectively completed in September\/October 2015 when the Firm received the sum of US$2.459 million from Metalloyd on behalf of the Client in full satisfaction of the 123 Award. The Disputed Invoices were rendered in connection with the 123 Award Enforcement Proceedings.', '8\\u2003The Client also engaged the Firm as its solicitors for SIAC arbitration number 200 of 2013 (\u201cSIAC 200\u201d) and SIAC arbitration number 223 of 2013 (\u201cSIAC 223\u201d). Both SIAC 200 and SIAC 223 were matters in relation to a dispute between the Client and Mount Eastern Holdings Resources Co. Limited (\u201cthe Mount Eastern Matter\u201d). 11', 'The Mount Eastern Matter is unrelated to SIAC 123. It is noted that there was a period when the Firm was handling and doing work on the Mount Eastern Matter and SIAC 123 (including the 123 Award Enforcement Proceedings) at the same time.', '9\\u2003On 8 January 2016, slightly over two years after the 123 Award was handed down, the Firm issued Invoice number 97 (\u201cInvoice 97\u201d) for work done in relation to the Mount Eastern Matter. 12', 'Invoice 97 is not one of the Disputed Invoices. As Invoice 97 remained unpaid, the Firm took out OS 216\/2016 on 4 March 2016 for Invoice number 97 to be taxed. 13', '10\\u2003It was around this period that the Client realised that it was not able to account for a balance sum of US$172,670.56 held by the Firm. 14', 'According to the Client\u2019s records, this balance sum ought to have been held by the Firm for the Mount Eastern Matter. 15', 'The Client then engaged its present solicitors, Rajah and Tann (\u201cR&T\u201d), on or about 15 March 2016, to begin looking into its past financial transactions with the Firm, including transactions relating to the Firm\u2019s work in SIAC 123. 16', '11\\u2003Eventually, by way of an email dated 5 May 2016, R&T sought the return of the balance sum of US$172,670.56. This was still in relation to the Mount Eastern Matter; there was no mention of SIAC 123. The next day, the Firm replied with an email containing a breakdown of the funds used for the Mount Eastern Matter. The Firm\u2019s breakdown suggested that the balance sum ought to be S$71,364.58 instead of US$172,670.56. 17', '12\\u2003Thereafter, on 9 May 2016, R&T emailed the Firm seeking an itemised breakdown of the Firm\u2019s charges for the Disputed Invoices and the 123 Award Enforcement Proceedings. This led to a series of correspondences culminating in the bringing of this application, OS 931\/2016, on 14 September 2016.', '13\\u2003I pause to make the observation that since the Firm was handling a number of files or matters for the Client, it is apparent that invoices and requests for deposits were made for all the different files and matters (SIAC 123, SIAC 200 and SIAC 223). Whilst it is unclear whether a separate client account was opened in respect of each file or matter, it stands to reason (barring some contrary agreement) that sums provided as deposit for a particular file should only be used for the costs and disbursements for that very file. Further, work done for one particular file should be charged (accounted) to the client in respect of that file. If the position was otherwise, it is not difficult to imagine the confusion that may arise. In making this comment by way of general observation, I say nothing about any right of set-off that a law firm may possess. I note also that this point was not addressed or raised by the parties.', '14\\u2003Whilst the present dispute before this court concerns invoices rendered for the 123 Award Enforcement Proceedings, I note that the Client\u2019s current solicitors, R&T, were not engaged to conduct an \u201caudit\u201d of the invoices that were rendered by the Firm. Instead, R&T was engaged to represent the Client in respect of the Invoice 97 taxation application brought by the Firm (see [9] above). It was during the collation of the records on the various payments to the Firm that the Client started to have concerns over the invoices and sums paid for the 123 Award Enforcement Proceedings.', '15\\u2003The key individuals in this dispute are the following:', '(a)\\u2003Mr Zhu Xiao Dong (\u201cMr Zhu\u201d), who is from the People\u2019s Republic of China, is the Client\u2019s Deputy General Manager. Mr Zhu is the Client\u2019s main representative in charge of the conduct of SIAC 123, including liaising with the Firm and dealing with the invoices raised by the Firm. 18', 'Mr Zhu joined the Client in 2009 and was based in the Singapore office from 2009 to 2014. Mr Zhu relocated to the Client\u2019s Shanghai Office in July 2014 but still works out of the Singapore office for about a week every two months or so. The evidence is that Mr Zhu was responsible for the trade(s) that were the subject-matter of the SIAC 123 arbitration. Although Mr Zhu was experienced in his line of work, 19', 'he was unfamiliar with the Singapore legal system and the practices of international arbitration. Indeed, SIAC 123 was his first experience with litigation and the legal system in Singapore, and the Firm was the first law firm in Singapore that he had worked closely with. Due to his inexperience, Mr Zhu asserts that he left the running of SIAC 123 to the Firm and would stand guided by the Firm\u2019s recommendations. Mr Zhu also takes the position that he was never informed of the Client\u2019s right to send the bills for taxation. 20', '(b)\\u2003Mr Gabriel Wang Kaiyang (\u201cMr Wang\u201d) is a former private banker who joined the Client in April 2011 as the special assistant to the Client\u2019s Chairman. Mr Wang was also a director of the Client at the relevant time. Mr Wang was one of the Client\u2019s bank signatories and signed the cheques that were issued in respect of the Disputed Invoices. Mr Wang conducted internal investigations of the Disputed Invoices between March and April 2016. That said, it is apparent that unlike Mr Zhu, Mr Wang did not personally handle SIAC 123 or the 123 Award Enforcement Proceedings.', '(c)\\u2003Ms Jessica Cao Ye (\u201cMs Cao\u201d), the Client\u2019s assistant finance manager from December 2014 to April 2016. 21', 'Ms Cao provided two affidavits but was not cross-examined before me (see below at [16]).', '(d)\\u2003Mr Peter Gabriel (\u201cMr Gabriel\u201d), the Managing Director of the Firm. 22', 'Mr Gabriel acted for the Client in SIAC 123 and its related proceedings before the Singapore courts.', '(e)\\u2003Mr Nandwani Manoj Prakash, a director with the Firm. 23', '16\\u2003Whilst this application was commenced by originating summons, leave was granted to the parties to cross-examine Mr Zhu (for the Client) and Mr Wang (for the Client), as well as Mr Gabriel (for the Firm). The cross examination was, however, to be limited to Invoice 86 and the circumstances surrounding an alleged oral agreement between the parties concerning payment and deduction of S$300,000 by way of a final payment for work done in connection with the 123 Award.', '17\\u2003The evidence is that sometime in late 2009 the Client decided to appoint the Firm in place of another firm of solicitors to act for it in connection with SIAC 123. No formal letter of engagement, however, was signed or in evidence. There is also no evidence that the Firm provided the Client with information on its charge rate or cost estimates. 24', 'Mr Zhu was the Client\u2019s representative who instructed the Firm on matters relating to SIAC 123. It is apparent that the decision to engage the Firm was taken by the Chairman of the Client. 25', '18\\u2003Mr Zhu did give instructions to the Firm on issues arising in SIAC 123. These included issues in relation to the invoices raised by the Firm. 26', 'That said, whilst the evidence could have been clearer, it appears that when invoices were presented to Mr Zhu, he would simply pass these to the Client\u2019s accounting department for processing, approval and payment. 27', 'Whilst Mr Zhu\u2019s evidence is that he left the matter of the Firm\u2019s fees or rate of fees to the Client (the Chairman and accounts department) it is apparent (for reasons set out immediately below) that Mr Zhu was not unconcerned or disinterested in the Firm\u2019s fees.', '19\\u2003The gist of Mr Wang\u2019s evidence was that the question of fees for work done by solicitors was something that was decided by the Chairman possibly with inputs from the trader whose trade was the subject matter of the litigation. Mr Wang\u2019s evidence was that whilst he signed on the invoices (as placed before him by the accounts department) this was purely as an administrative matter and did not mean that he was personally approving the sum actually charged. He also stated that that he was not responsible for approving legal fees charged; in any case, he was not Mr Zhu\u2019s supervisor. I also note Mr Wang\u2019s evidence that the trader had an interest in the cost of the legal fees because the cost of litigation would be a factor in determining the trader\u2019s discretionary bonus. 28', 'However, it was unclear from the evidence how much influence (if any) the individual trader actually had over the position that the Client took on the fees of a law firm in respect of work done in a dispute arising out of a trade that he was responsible for.', '20\\u2003What is clear is that over the course of several years and several different matters on which the Firm was instructed by the Client, the Firm was accustomed to asking for deposits for costs and disbursements that were expected to be incurred. Sometimes, a general indication of the type of disbursements that were likely to be incurred (such as overseas travel in connection with the matter) might be provided. In other cases, it appears that there would be no indication at all as to the general nature of the costs and disbursements to which the deposit would be applied. In addition, it appears that the Firm would, from time to time, issue particular invoices seeking specific sums in respect of various items of work that had been performed. The evidence is that once the Firm sent Mr Zhu a request for a deposit or an invoice, Mr Zhu would pass the same to the Client\u2019s accounting department for processing and approval. The accounting department would then prepare payment vouchers against the documents to be signed by Mr Wang. So long as the payment vouchers and documents were regular on their face, Mr Wang would sign the cheques. 29', '21\\u2003There is no evidence before the court that any of the Client\u2019s officers made a \u201cpositive\u201d decision at the time when cheques were issued as to whether the fees charged by the Firm for any piece of work were reasonable and proper or were, on the contrary, objectionable as being excessive or without basis. Mr Zhu\u2019s evidence is that whilst he was aware of the invoices (after all, he passed them to the accounting department for processing) he did not challenge or query the amount charged and generally assumed that the Firm would be charging fairly.', '22\\u2003On the evidence before me, it appears that it was only when Invoice 97 for the Mount Eastern Matter was raised in January 2016 (see [9] above) that frictions started to surface. Initially these were concerned with the invoices and accounts for work done for the Mount Eastern Matter. As noted, it was during this exercise that the Client realised there were issues with the Disputed Invoices in respect of the 123 Award Enforcement Proceedings. The end result is the present application before this court.'"}
{"casename":"2018_SGHC_169","fact":"The background\n8 The first plaintiff and the defendant met around 1986 when they were  \nmembers of the Singapore Police Force.5 The defendant left the Police Force \nsometime in 1991  and became a businessman. The first plaintiff  remained and \nthereafter became acquainted  with the second  plaintiff around May 1997. At \nthis time, the first plaintiff  was heading the Computer Crime Branch.  The \nsecond plaintiff was his subordinate.\n9  Sometime in 1998, the first plaintiff introduced the second plaintiff to \nthe defendant so that the second  plaintiff might obtain advice on the engagement  \nof a domestic  helper.  The defendant, after leaving  the Police Force in 1991, was \ninvolved in various business ventures including that of a domestic helper  \nagency.6 I note that the first plaintiff\u2019s Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief also \nmakes a passing reference to the defendant  as \u201can agent in a multi-level  \nmarketing business\u201d.7 This was not elaborated  on in the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence  and \nwas not specifically touched on in cross-examination. I shall return  to this at the \nend of the judgment.\n10 The defendant asserts that he was introduced to the second  plaintiff  \nsometime in 2002 (and not 1998), but the parties  have no serious disagreement  \n5 First plaintiff\u2019s Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief (\u201cAEIC)\u201d at para 3.\n6 First plaintiff\u2019s AEIC  at paras 3\u20136; second plaintiff\u2019s AEIC at para 5.\n7 First plaintiff\u2019s AEIC  at [6].\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nTan Swee Wan v Lian  Tian  Yong Johnny [2018]  SGHC  169\n5as to how they became acquainted. There is no dispute that the defendant was \nthe first to leave the Police Force to try his hand in business. As will be \nexamined in more detail later, the defendant has held directorships (executive  \nand non-executive)  in many companies  involved in a wide range  of businesses. \nIt is clear that he is often brought into companies as an investor, usually \nreceiving shares and sometimes being given  a non-executive director\u2019s position. \nThe monies invested may be his own or sourced from or combined with sums  \nraised from other investors whether  in Singapore, China or elsewhere.  In other \ncases, the defendant  may also take a more active management role as an \nexecutive director, that is, to come  on board  the company for the purpose of \nhelping to grow the business \u2013 possibly to the point  where  a listing on a \nrecognised stock exchange becomes possible.\n11 While the defendant left for the business world in 1991, the first plaintiff \nremained in the Police  Force where he acquired  experience in computer forensic  \ncriminal investigation. The first plaintiff also acquired a degree in science from  \nthe National University of Singapore  while with the Police Force.8 The second \nplaintiff also appears  to have served  in the area of investigation of computer \ncrimes.9 In this way,  there is no doubt that, as compared to the defendant, the \nplaintiffs were  far better  acquainted and much more familiar with computer  \nsystems and computer programming. This forms the backdrop against which  the \nplaintiffs and defendant came together  to collaborate  for the Project  that lies at \nthe heart of this action.10 That said, I note that while the first plaintiff asserts that \nhe is not familiar with financial matters and simply brought technical skills to \nthe table, I am satisfied  that the first plaintiff  has greater familiarity and \n8 First plaintiff\u2019s  AEIC at para 7l; Certified Transcript  (\u201cCT\u201d), 13 March 2018, p 120 \n(lines 11\u201316).\n9 First plaintiff\u2019s AEIC  at para 4.\n10 Second plaintiff\u2019s AEIC at  paras 4\u20137.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nTan Swee Wan v Lian  Tian  Yong Johnny [2018]  SGHC  169\n6involvement in financial  matters than he is prepared to acknowledge. The \nrelevance of this will become clearer  later.  On the other hand, while it has been \nsuggested that the defendant is more familiar with information technology than \nhe admits, I have the clear impression that he is not an IT aficionado  and that \nhis IT knowledge is rather general  in nature.\n12 The first plaintiff  left the Police  Force sometime in 1998 and joined \nMicrosoft Singapore for about a year, working in intellectual  property \nenforcement. Thereafter, he joined Seagate for two years followed by a short \nperiod at  KPMG  (forensics and litigation support).11\n13 By 2001, the first plaintiff and the defendant  had become  close friends. \nThe second  plaintiff did not know the defendant as well as the first plaintiff did, \nbut their relationship was also cordial and they were on friendly  terms. In \ngeneral, it appears that the defendant  had much more  frequent contact with the \nfirst plaintiff as opposed  to the second  plaintiff.  It seems the second  plaintiff  \nwas based in China for much of the period  when certain key discussions  or \nmatters transpired between the first plaintiff and defendant. The defendant\u2019s \nevidence, which  I accept, is that he mostly left it to the first plaintiff to explain \nthe discussions to the second plaintiff.\n14 Unfortunately, as a result of the dispute that subsequently arose over the \nProject and which led to this law suit, the friendship between  the parties has \nbeen lost  and replaced  by considerable animosity.\n15 One feature of this case is the lack of contemporaneous documentation \nto establish, support and corroborate the evidence of the witnesses on many key \nissues in dispute between  the parties. While  there are some  emails in evidence  \n11 CT, 15 March 2018, pp 52 (line14) to 54 (line 8).\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nTan Swee Wan v Lian  Tian  Yong Johnny [2018]  SGHC  169\n7(together with their attachments), it seems that many of the discussions between \nthe parties were never  recorded or confirmed by minutes or emails. Indeed, as \nwill be seen, the material record on the agreement between the parties in respect  \nof the Project is surprisingly sparse and incomplete given the size of the deal \ncontemplated. The plaintiffs  and defendant have  explained this lack of \ndocumentation by saying that there was a good deal of trust between  the parties \nand that it was not thought necessary  to have everything recorded or confirmed \nin writing. After all, they were friends who helped each other out on personal \nmatters from time to time.12 \nThe setting up  of Tecbiz \n16 Sometime around early 2001, the plaintiffs  decided to start their own \nbusiness together with Mr Ong Cheng  Ho (\u201cMr Ong\u201d), who was also a police  \ninvestigator, leveraging on their acquired  skills in investigating  computer \ncrimes. The defendant was invited  to join as an investor and to provide general \nbusiness advice. The plan was to enter the market  for computer forensics and \ndetection and prevention of copyright infringement and software piracy.13 \nPursuant to this plan, around August 2001, the first plaintiff incorporated Tecbiz \nSherlock Pte Ltd. The company\u2019s name  was subsequently changed to Tecbiz \nFrisman Pte Ltd (\u201cTecbiz\u201d). At the time of incorporation, the first plaintiff held \n60% of the shares and the remaining 40% of shares  in Tecbiz were held by Mr \nOng. The second  plaintiff was then still with the Police Force and apparently \nfelt it would be inappropriate for him to hold shares in the company.14 \nSubsequently, on 10 October 2001, the defendant invested S$166,667 in Tecbiz \nand was allotted 33,333 of the shares  in return  (at S$4 per share).15\n12 First plaintiff\u2019s AEIC  at paras 5, 7 and 12; second plaintiff\u2019s AEIC  at paras 5 and  10.\n13 First plaintiff\u2019s AEIC  at para 8. \n14 First plaintiff\u2019s AEIC  at para 10.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nTan Swee Wan v Lian  Tian  Yong Johnny [2018]  SGHC  169\n817 On 16 January 2002, Mr Ong sold his shares in Tecbiz and the second \nplaintiff (who had now left the Police Force) became a shareholder. The shares  \nin Tecbiz were  thus held in the following proportions:  the first plaintiff  held \n45%; the second  plaintiff held 25%; and the defendant held 30%.16 The \nshareholding in Tecbiz remained in these proportions until April 2011, when \nthe relationship  between the plaintiffs  and defendant  soured.\n18 While the defendant was a non-executive director and shareholder in \nTecbiz almost  from  the very start,  his role was essentially passive: that of an \ninvestor who had a seat at the table,  so to speak. He lacked technical  expertise \nin computer software and the operations of Tecbiz  were left to the plaintiffs. \nThe defendant did attend board meetings  and had sight of company reports,  but \nhis evidence  was that he was not concerned with the details and that he did not \nrecall much of the matters discussed.  \nTecbiz\u2019s core business\n19 Tecbiz\u2019s core business was the provision of forensic IT services to the \nprivate sector.17 These included the examination of computer  and IT systems for \nevidence of wrongdoing, such as the use of pirated software, unauthorised  \naccess and appropriation of confidential information.18 This was the business  \nTecbiz started and indeed continued with, until the plaintiffs gave up their \ndirectorships in 2011. It appears that Microsoft was a customer of Tecbiz\u2019s IT \nforensic services as well.19\n15 Defendant\u2019s  AEIC at [10]. \n16 Second plaintiff\u2019s AEIC at  para 9.\n17 CT, 15 March 2018, p 58 (lines 6\u201314). \n18 Defendant\u2019s  AEIC at para 6; first plaintiff\u2019s  AEIC at  para 8.\n19 CT, 15 March 2018, pp 58 (line 25) to 59 (line 4).\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nTan Swee Wan v Lian  Tian  Yong Johnny [2018]  SGHC  169\n920 The expertise  within Tecbiz eventually extended from forensic  \nexamination of computer  systems to the development of software programs to \nassist in the forensic work of Tecbiz.20 As will be seen, the development of \nsoftware applications lies at the heart of the dispute between the parties. While \nthe plaintiffs did have knowledge of computer technology, it seems  the key \nperson at Tecbiz who led developments  in software  applications was Mr Tan \nKah Leong (\u201cMr Tan\u201d). Indeed, it appears that Mr Tan did much of the early \ndevelopmental work on the software package which gave rise to  the Project.21 \n21 The evidence is that if Tecbiz wanted  to grow the software development \nside of their business,  then aside from  capital injections, it might be necessary \nto expand  their team of programmers and software engineers.22 This is \nessentially the backdrop  against which  I turn to the attempts by Tecbiz  to attract \nnew investments in or around 2005 with a view to expanding the business. The \neventual \u201cfailure\u201d of these early attempts  led to the discussions with the \ndefendant and  his involvement in fund-raising in late 2010.\nEarly attempts by  Tecbiz to attract investors: Sirius and Spring  Seeds\n22  According  to the defendant, sometime  in 2005, Tecbiz decided  to attract  \nnew investors. To this end, on 1 September  2005, Mr Eugene Wong (\u201cMr  \nWong\u201d), who was founder and director of a venture  capital investment \ncompany, Sirius Venture Consulting Pte Ltd (\u201cSirius\u201d), was appointed a director \nof Tecbiz.

The defendant asserts this was \nbecause Tecbiz was unable to fulfil  certain milestones in the subscription \nagreement,29 but the details  are unclear.  An email  dated 5 January 2010 sent by \nthe first plaintiff  to Mr Wong and Mr Jen (copied to the second plaintiff  and the \ndefendant) suggests that the 2009 financial year had been \u201cdifficult\u201d for Tecbiz \nbecause of the global economic downturn, and mentions an unsuccessful \n\u201cattempted OTC  listing  in FY 2009\u201d.30 This appears  to be a reference  to an \nattempt to list Tecbiz around  2009 in Phillip  Securities\u2019 Over-the-Counter \n(\u201cOTC\u201d) Board  in Singapore,  which  was unsuccessful or at least was not \nproceeded with because of the sense that the listing was premature.31 The email \nwent on to state that 2010 would likely be another  difficult  year, and that Tecbiz  \nwas adopting a strategy of remaining lean and focusing on high margins markets \nand services. The email concluded with the first plaintiff stating  that there was \na need to reduce the size of the board  of directors  because board activity would \nbe \u201cvery thin\u201d, and respectfully requesting that Mr Wong and Mr Jen resign \nfrom the board.32 \n25 Nothing turns on the reason  for Spring Seeds and Sirius\u2019 withdrawal  \nfrom Tecbiz  in 2009. The point I make, however, is that the first plaintiff \nappears to be reasonably knowledgeable about finance, investments, venture  \ncapital funding,  listings  and business operations.  The first plaintiff is clearly not \njust a \u201ctechnical  person\u201d  (supra [11]).

It does not appear to \nme that the first plaintiff is \u201chands-off\u201d  when it comes to business and financial \narrangements.\nThe birth of  the Solvesam project\n26 While there is a lack of clarity over the dates, it appears that sometime \naround 2005, Tecbiz  conceived the idea for developing a new software program \nor package which had as its objective management  of information technology \nassets, software licences  and license  compliance. Corporate  users needed to \ncomply with the terms  of software licences,  including licence renewals  and \nrestrictions on the number  of computers  in which the software could be stored \nand used.  Given the large number of software programs a corporate  user may \nneed, there was a need to assist  companies  in managing their licences so as to \nensure \u201cproactive compliance with the terms and conditions  of these licences\u201d.33 \nThe second plaintiff also explains that assistance  on compliance involved  \nobtaining data on the usage information of various  software products  deployed \nwithin the companies and analysing them against the software  licence purchase \nrecords and entitlements.34 \n27 At the time,  Tecbiz was using a software tool called LicenceCare  \nproduced by Microsoft in providing software  asset  management services for \ncustomers of Microsoft products,35 but the tool had \u201csome limitation(s)\u201d.36 Thus, \nTecbiz developed its own software, \u201cSolvesam\u201d.  The first version  of Solvesam \nwas developed,  and \u201csoft launch[ed]\u201d sometime around 2006.37 For \n33 First plaintiff\u2019s AEIC  at para 13.\n34 Second plaintiff\u2019s AEIC at para 11; CT, 15 March 2018,  pp 97 (line 20) to 98 (line 2).\n35 CT, 15 March 2018, pp 59 (line 18) to 60 (line 7).\n36 CT, 15 March 2018, p 59 (line 20).\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nTan Swee Wan v Lian  Tian  Yong Johnny [2018]  SGHC  169\n13convenience, this will be referred to as \u201cSS V1.0\u201d which existed as a server  \nversion as well as a thumbdrive version.38 At the time, the plan was to market it \nas part of Tecbiz\u2019s software asset  management  service.  This involved providing \nthe customer with a complete service package that included accessing and \nlinking up the customer\u2019s computers\/servers in a manner that would allow \nTecbiz to manage the customer\u2019s software licences. SS V1.0 was not sold as a \nstandalone product.\n28 SS V1.0 was officially launched  around March 2007. The plaintiffs\u2019  \nevidence is that it was well received,  and was used by Tecbiz in providing \nsoftware asset management services  to significant corporate  customers \nincluding Thai Airways, Jurong International Pte Ltd and China  National Oil \nCorporation.39 \n29 The plaintiffs assert that by 2011, Tecbiz  had begun  selling copies  of the \n\u201cenforcement edition\u201d of Solvesam to Microsoft  China to assist  in conducting \nraids on companies  by checking for evidence of breaches of licence  terms and \nconditions.40  Evidence  of this includes:\n(a) A Tecbiz invoice to Microsoft China, 19 May 2011, for installing  \nand setting  up Solvesam Enforcement.41\n(b) A Tecbiz invoice to Microsoft China, 20 January 2011, for 3 sets \nof Solvesam and  10 USB  scanning drives.42\n37 Second plaintiff\u2019s AEIC at  para 12.\n38 CT, 16 March 2018, pp 54 (lines 3\u20138) and 61 (lines 3\u20135).\n39 First plaintiff\u2019s AEIC  at para 16; second plaintiff\u2019s AEIC at para 14.\n40 First plaintiff\u2019s AEIC  at para 21; second plaintiff\u2019s AEIC at para 20.\n41 Second plaintiff\u2019s AEIC at  Tab 2, pp 142, 143.\n42 Second plaintiff\u2019s AEIC at  Tab 2, pp 140, 141.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nTan Swee Wan v Lian  Tian  Yong Johnny [2018]  SGHC  169\n14(c) A Tecbiz invoice to Microsoft China, 2 July 2010 for a pilot \nproject for Direct  SAM and engagement  of customers in SAM  \nprocess.43\n30 The defendant  was not involved in the development of SS V1.0,  but was \npresent at Tecbiz board meetings where  SS V1.0 was raised and discussed.44 For \nexample, on 25 May 2007, the defendant  was present at a board meeting during \nwhich the first plaintiff updated  the board  on \u201cthe successful development  and \ntesting of [SS V1.0]\u201d, as well as the fact that Tecbiz  had received an invitation \nto speak on Software Asset  Management at a Microsoft Worldwide Partner \nConference, and had secured a  contract with Thai Airways.45 \n31 While the defendant may not have  been aware of the details of SS V1.0  \nin 2006 and 2007,  he would  certainly have  been generally aware of SS V1.0 and \nthat it was a significant development in Tecbiz\u2019s software asset  management \nbusiness. \nFurther attempts  to raise funds between 2008 and 2009\n32 With the birth of SS V1.0, Tecbiz  was keen to attract  investment for the \npurposes of growing  the business with the ultimate  goal of securing  a listing  on \na stock exchange.  Expansion of SS V1.0 into a fully developed  software asset  \nmanagement system would  require  injection of capital and technical expertise.46  \nAs will be seen, one major  aspect of the parties\u2019 plans  for Solvesam was to \ndevelop a cloud-based version. This would require  expensive infrastructure,47 \nhence the need for funding.\n43 Second plaintiff\u2019s AEIC at  Tab 2, pp 136, 137.\n44 First plaintiff\u2019s AEIC  at para 15.\n45 First plaintiff\u2019s AEIC  at para 17(a).\n46 CT, 15 March 2018, pp 64 (line 4) to 65 (line 8) and p 72 (lines  12\u201322).  \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nTan Swee Wan v Lian  Tian  Yong Johnny [2018]  SGHC  169\n1533 It appears  this was the reason  why Tecbiz  considered  a listing on Phillip  \nSecurities OTC Board in 2009. Consideration was also given in late 2009 to the \nidea of selling Tecbiz to Deloitte  & Touche Financial Advisory  Services \n(\u201cDeloitte\u201d). According  to the first plaintiff,  the sale did not materialise because  \namong other reasons: (a) the offer price was too low; (b) the defendant would \nnot be part of the business  at Deloitte; and (c) Deloitte was only interested in \nacquiring the forensic  investigation business, and not SS V1.0.48 \n34 I pause here to note that while  the defendant was a non-executive \ndirector of Tecbiz,  he appears to have played a fairly important role in \ndiscussions and planning of future  developments of Tecbiz, at least from  the \nbusiness or financial perspective.  That much is clear from the fact that one \nreason for the decision not to sell Tecbiz\u2019s business to Deloitte was that Deloitte  \nwas only interested in acquiring  Tecbiz\u2019s  management team which of course \nexcluded the defendant.49\nFurther and planned iterations  of SS V1.0\n35 From  2009 through to 2010, the parties continued to consider how to \ndevelop Tecbiz\u2019s business and Solvesam. The plan, as explained in a Tecbiz \nslide presentation  sent to the defendant  around 27 August 2010, was to target \nthe China market on account of the large  number of IT users in China. To \nsucceed, it would be necessary  to develop  SS V1.0  into a \u201cCloud-based\u201d \nproduct.50 It seems  the goal was to develop Solvesam into an \u201cIT [a]sset  \n[m]anagement tool to be used for computer maintenance services for the \n47 CT, 15 March 2018, p 65 (lines 3\u20138).\n48 First plaintiff\u2019s AEIC  at paras 26\u201327; second plaintiff\u2019s AEIC at para 25.\n49 First plaintiff\u2019s AEIC  at para 27.\n50 First plaintiff\u2019s AEIC,  TSW-4,  at p 173.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nTan Swee Wan v Lian  Tian  Yong Johnny [2018]  SGHC  169\n16purpose of generating revenue from advertising, group buy and market trend \nanalysis\u201d.51 It was envisioned  that this would be achieved by developing SS \nV1.0 through  the following iterations:52 \n(a) Development of a web-based version by October 2010 for a pilot \nrun by Microsoft China clients (this shall be referred  to as \u201cSS \nV1.25\u201d).\n(b) Development of an enforcement version for sale to Microsoft \nChina in 2011 (\u201cSS V1.25A\u201d).53\n(c) Development of a cloud-based version in 2011 with added \nservices such as updates and security health  checks (\u201cSS V2\u201d).54 \nAside from  some preparatory work,  it appears  that SS V2 was \nnever completed.55 \n(d) Further  development of the cloud-based version in 2012 by \nadding features and functions such as break\/fix services, \nimproving bandwidth and storage  capacity for users, and \nbuilding a PC market  trend  analysis platform (\u201cSS  V3\u201d).56 The \noverall goal was to reach  5 million users within 5 years.  SS V3 \nwas intended to be an \u201con-demand\u201d  and \u201cpay-as-you-use\u201d \nversion of  Solvesam for individuals.57\n51 First plaintiff\u2019s AEIC  at p 178.\n52 First plaintiff\u2019s AEIC  at p 173.\n53 First plaintiff\u2019s  AEIC at para 21, second  plaintiff\u2019s AEIC at para 20; CT, 16 March \n2018, pp 75 (line 25) to 76 (line 8).\n54 First plaintiff\u2019s AEIC  at p 173.\n55 CT, 15 March 2018, p 66 (lines 18\u201325).\n56 First plaintiff\u2019s AEIC  at p 173.\n57 CT, 16 March 2018, pp 70 (line 7) to 73 (line 5); 2AB pp 871\u2013889.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nTan Swee Wan v Lian  Tian  Yong Johnny [2018]  SGHC  169\n1736 The evidence  is that by around  early or mid-2011, SS V1.25, the web-\nbased version,  existed at least as a demonstration model. Unfortunately, the \nSolvesam project never developed beyond SS V1.25 since the plaintiffs \nwithdrew from the project in mid-2011 for reasons  that will be examined later. \nThe point, however, is that the Solvesam project appears to have  developed over \nnumerous discussions into a fairly sophisticated  plan which culminated  in the \nhope that SSV3 would have a degree of market penetration  such that it would \nbe like a Facebook  for China (in terms of the number  of user  accounts). \nExpansion of the defendant\u2019s role: raising funds for  Solvesam\n37  While 2009 was not a good year for Tecbiz,  a positive  development  \ntook place  in April 2010 when International  Enterprise Singapore offered its \nassistance in setting up an overseas  marketing office in Shanghai, China, under \nthe Internationalisation Capability  Development  Programme. As a result, \nTecbiz established  a representative office in China in August 2010 with the \nsecond plaintiff as the Chief Representative. The second plaintiff  also relocated \nto China.58\n38 It is evident  that Microsoft was interested in developments in the \nSolvesam software around 2010, as can be seen from the various invoices \nreferred to at [29] above. According to the plaintiffs,  sometime around August \n2010, Mr Alex Cooper, Microsoft\u2019s general manager in China, even suggested \nthat Tecbiz set up a separate company  to develop Solvesam further  and \nsuggested that he might  be able to assist in finding venture capitalists to invest \nin the new company.59 The defendant was informed  of this suggestion  by email \ndated 27 August 2010 which included the powerpoint slides mentioned at [35] \n58 First plaintiff\u2019s AEIC  at para 28; second plaintiff\u2019s AEIC at para 26.\n59 First plaintiff\u2019s AEIC  at para 30.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nTan Swee Wan v Lian  Tian  Yong Johnny [2018]  SGHC  169\n18above on how Solvesam could be developed,  together with a copy of Mr \nCooper\u2019s curriculum vitae.60\n39 The fact that Microsoft China  was interested in Solvesam is also clear \nfrom the fact that in November 2010, they expressed interest  in training sessions \non Tecbiz\u2019s enforcement tool for Microsoft\u2019s technicians and lawyers,  as well \nas training on how to use the software for inspection.61 \n40 In short, the plaintiffs\u2019 position is that SS V1.0 had been well received \nand that the plans to develop SS V.1.25 and beyond had certainly attracted  the \nattention of Microsoft.  The plaintiffs  also assert  that they did not receive  \ncomplaints from other customers as to the capabilities of the Solvesam \nsoftware.62\n41 According  to the plaintiffs, the defendant,  after being informed of Mr \nCooper\u2019s proposal, offered to develop  his own fund-raising proposal. He \nadvised against having Mr Cooper involved as \u201cit was difficult to work  with \nventure capitalists\u201d,  and the parties would lose control of the company. The \nplaintiffs say that although they knew the defendant was a \u201csmooth talker and \nskilled salesperson\u201d, they were keen on his fund-raising proposal  because they \nviewed him as their trusted friend  who would have their interests at heart.63\n42 Several  discussions took place between  the parties, likely around end \nAugust to October 2010.

When the defendant was informed, the plaintiffs say he \ndiscouraged these grant  applications  and instead  stressed  his own experience  \nand ability in fundraising.65\n44 One example which the defendant is said to have raised  in this context \nwas his involvement in fund raising and a listing  exercise for Techmedia \nAdvertising Inc (\u201cTECM\u201d) in the United States.  In brief, TECM  was allegedly \nfirst set up in Singapore as Techmedia  Advertising  Singapore Pte Ltd. A related \ncompany, Techmedia  Advertising Mauritius, was set up as the parent  of \nTechmedia Advertising India to carry out media  related activities in India and \ntake advantage of tax treaties.66 The defendant  was said to have led the fund-\nraising exercise with the intention of listing TECM on NASDAQ. According to \nthe plaintiffs, the defendant  cited or made  references to TECM so as to persuade \nthe plaintiffs  that he would be able to lead and drive the fund-raising exercise \nfor the Solvesam project. \n45 A key statement  which the plaintiffs assert was made  by the defendant, \nand which  the plaintiffs  claim to have  relied on, was that TECM was already \nlisted on NASDAQ.

On the face of it, the document was a POA granted to Mr Li by a company known as New Eastern (1971) Private Limited (\u201cNew Eastern\u201d). Notably, when it was presented to the Respondent, the POA evidently already bore the signature of one of New Eastern\u2019s directors, Mr Loy Teu Wee (\u201cMr Loy\u201d).

{"casename":"2018_SGHC_176","fact":"'53\\u2003I turn to the first area of dispute, concerning the arrangements made for the collection of the cabbages. To reiterate, the Prosecution\u2019s position was that Jumaat had placed the order for the drugs prior to the morning of 13 August 2015, and he then collected the drugs on the morning itself. Jumaat claimed that it was a last minute request for help by Siva on the very morning of 13 August 2015, and he thought that he was merely collecting and delivering vegetables only.', '54\\u2003Based on the evidence of Hari, on 12 August 2015, Koma had arranged for Hari to deliver cabbages containing \u201cmedicine\u201d to a \u201cbald guy\u201d in Ang Mo Kio Avenue 5. At about 7.00pm on 12 August 2015, Hari collected the cabbages. On the way to Ang Mo Kio on 13 August 2015, Hari simply had to call Koma to ask \u201cthe bald guy\u201d to take delivery: see [21] to [23] above. In other words, by the evening of 12 August 2015, the delivery was scheduled to take place, and the recipient was to be a person in Ang Mo Kio. On the morning of 13 August 2015, there was no change in the venue. Nor was there any indication that there was any change in the recipient. Hari simply communicated with Koma to ask the recipient to take delivery.', '55\\u2003In addition, I noted that from the phone records, Siva had contacted Jumaat on the days prior to the drug transaction, on 10, 11 and 12 August 2015. 57', 'In particular, on 12 August 2015, there was a call between Siva and Jumaat that took place at 7.47pm. This would have been after Hari had agreed to carry out the delivery, and around the time Hari actually collected the drugs. It should also be highlighted that while Jumaat referred to his contact as Siva, and Hari referred to his contact as Koma, they were both communicating with the user of the Malaysian number.', '56\\u2003To my mind, it was implausible for Siva to call early in the morning at 4.49am, to seek Jumaat\u2019s almost immediate help to collect the items on his behalf. There was every possibility that Jumaat might not have agreed to help. While it might be true that generally, Jumaat would be awake to prepare food for his food stall that time in the morning, he might not be available that morning. As such, if Siva needed Jumaat\u2019s help to collect a consignment from Malaysia, Jumaat\u2019s account was unbelievable in that Siva did not ask for help earlier on the previous days. It would be quite remiss of Siva not to secure the agreement for Jumaat to assist in advance, especially since the details of the drop off were being confirmed by Koma with Hari on 12 August 2015.', '57\\u2003Upon consideration, I agreed with the Prosecution that prior to the morning of 13 August 2015, Jumaat had already made certain arrangements for the delivery. There was cogent evidence of planning and coordination prior to 13 August 2015 for the delivery of the cabbages at a specific location to a specific person, and these plans did not change on 13 August 2013. Given the planning and coordination involved, I was of the view that Jumaat knew that the arrangements went beyond merely collecting vegetables and involved collecting the items contained within the vegetables.', '58\\u2003Even if I were to be wrong about the timing of the arrangements, and that the arrangements were made with Jumaat only on the morning of 13 August 2015, I remained of the view that Jumaat knew that the arrangements went beyond the mere collection of vegetables. According to Jumaat, it was the first time Siva had requested for his help. This was a collection in the wee hours of the morning, from persons in a Malaysian Lorry (who were unknown to Jumaat), and for further delivery to Ravi (who was also unknown to Jumaat). In cross-examination, Jumaat admitted that he did not know what Siva\u2019s full name was, where he lived or his family. He was not aware that Siva was dealing or selling vegetables. 58', 'Despite all the above, Jumaat claimed he did not find the request \u201cweird\u201d in any way.', '59\\u2003In light of the surrounding circumstances, Jumaat\u2019s position that he merely responded to a last minute request for help made by Siva purely to collect vegetables was not credible, and I rejected it. He knew that he was collecting more than just the vegetables. I was fortified in this view by the very clear evidence to show that in carrying out this collection, Jumaat had prepared in advance an amount of $18,500, and had dropped the blue plastic bag with the cash into the Lorry. I shall discuss this shortly. At this juncture, I should highlight that I did not accept the Prosecution\u2019s position that Jumaat had placed the order for the drugs for himself with the intention to sell the drugs to others. This point will be expanded on at [90] and [94].', '60\\u2003Next, I turn to address the question whether Jumaat dropped the blue plastic bag of cash into the Lorry. Jumaat claimed that he did not do so. He surmised that the cash was from customers of CCL Impex (S) Pte Ltd (\u201cCCL Impex Singapore\u201d) for the vegetables delivered to them by Hari and Mohd Nor. Having evaluated all the evidence, I was unable to accept Jumaat\u2019s denial. These are my reasons.', '61\\u2003To begin with, the CCTV footage showed that when Jumaat left his flat at about 5.39am, there was a blue plastic bag in the front basket of the bicycle. Jumaat stated that his bicycle would be parked along the corridor (outside his flat). However, he claimed that his children would get a plastic bag from the food stall, put their rubbish into the plastic bag and then place the plastic bag in the bicycle, rather than dispose of their rubbish in the flat. This was rather contrived. Furthermore, even if there was such a plastic bag with rubbish, it was surprising that Jumaat did not dispose of it on the fourth floor of Block 506, instead of bringing it down with him to the void deck.', '62\\u2003Jumaat also referred to samples of the blue plastic bags seized from the food stall (\u201cD1\u201d, \u201cD3\u201d and D4\u201d), to show that the blue plastic bags in question seized from the Lorry (\u201cF1\u201d and \u201cF1A\u201d) were different from those found at the food stall. While the blue plastic bags were not identical, I found this to be a neutral factor. It seemed to me that the blue plastic bag caught in the CCTV footage was very likely to be the same blue plastic bag which contained the cash of $18,500.', '63\\u2003Even if I were to be wrong on this point, the evidence of SSSgt Eng and Sgt Hidayat was that they saw Jumaat holding onto a blue plastic bag when he approached the Lorry at about 6.25am on 13 August 2015. When the Lorry moved off, they noticed that Jumaat was no longer holding on to the blue plastic bag (see [10] above). I saw no reason to doubt the officers\u2019 evidence. They corroborated each other\u2019s evidence, and they candidly admitted that they did not see Jumaat drop the blue plastic bag into the Lorry.', '64\\u2003Next, I turn to the evidence of Hari and Mohd Nor. Hari testified that after the cabbages were passed to the \u201cbald guy\u201d, the \u201cbald guy\u201d threw a blue plastic bag into the Lorry. Mohd Nor picked up the blue plastic bag and passed it to Vikineswaran who then passed it to Hari. The blue plastic bag was tied. Hari then testified that upon feeling the blue plastic bag, he believed that the blue plastic bag contained money. Mohd Nor\u2019s testimony corroborated Hari\u2019s account (see above at [26]).', '65\\u2003I pause here to note that while it was an unchallenged fact that Jumaat collected the cabbages from the Lorry, Hari and Mohd Nor testified that they were unable to identify Jumaat as that \u201cbald guy\u201d whom they passed the cabbages to. This showed that the two witnesses had no interest to implicate Jumaat. Further, Mohd Nor only spoke of what he knew. For instance, he did not speak of the phone conversation between Hari and Koma while they were in the Lorry. I found both witnesses to be credible, and I accepted their evidence.', '66\\u2003In addition to all of the above, the DNA evidence linked Jumaat inextricably to the sum of $18,500 in the blue plastic bag. To reiterate, Jumaat\u2019s DNA was found on one of the four rubber bands, F1A3, used to secure one bundle of cash found in the blue plastic bag (see above at [20]). Jumaat tried to cast doubt on the forensic evidence by alleging that the exhibits of this case were contaminated. Specifically, he alleged that there was a cross-transfer of Jumaat\u2019s DNA to F1A3 from the properties seized from his person to F1A3, such as the rubber band tying the cash seized from him (see above at [44(b)]).', '67\\u2003Jumaat\u2019s allegation was without merit. The blue plastic bag containing the sum of $18,500 and the rubber band F1A3 were seized from the Lorry which was at a separate location from where Jumaat was arrested and his personal belongings seized (see above at [11] and [17]). The blue plastic bag was seized by SSgt Fardlie (who was wearing gloves), and who placed the items into a polymer bag which was held by and later sealed by SSgt Tay. 59', 'It is also important to bear in mind that both officers did not have any physical contact with Jumaat prior to this. On the other hand, Jumaat\u2019s personal belongings were seized and collected by Sgt Hidayat at a different location and at a different time. They were placed into a tamper-proof polymer bag and sealed. 60', '68\\u2003Furthermore, Insp Nizammudin testified that when he received the case exhibits from W\/SI Woo, the exhibits were stored in tamper-proof polymer bags which were all individually sealed. The exhibits were handed to him one at a time after which he would cut open the tamper-proof bag and pass them over to the forensic officers for photo-taking. Insp Nizammudin was wearing gloves at all times. 61', '69\\u2003From the evidence of SSgt Fardlie, SSgt Tay and Sgt Hidayat, and bearing in mind that these items were seized by different CNB officers in different locations and at different times, I accepted that the blue plastic bag containing the sum of $18,500 and F1A3 were placed in one tamper-proof polymer bag and sealed and the personal belongings seized from Jumaat were placed in a separate tamper-proof polymer bag and sealed. I found it implausible that exhibits were contaminated such that Jumaat\u2019s DNA could be transferred to F1A3. Having considered the evidence of Insp Nizammudin, I also rejected the contention that there was a transfer of the DNA during the photography process.', '70\\u2003The fact that Jumaat\u2019s DNA was on F1A3 meant that he had handled the money found in the blue plastic bag recovered from the Lorry. This indicated that initially, Jumaat was in possession of the sum of $18,500, separated into four bundles with each bundle tied up by a rubber band, either from the time he left his flat or at the latest, from the time he left the food stall, Subsequently, he passed the money placed in the blue plastic bag to the persons in the Lorry after he collected the cabbages from them.', '71\\u2003At this juncture, I should state that in a contemporaneous statement recorded from Hari on 13 August 2015 at 8.00am by Sergeant Yogaraj s\/o Ragunathan Pillay, Hari said that the money in the blue plastic bag was passed to him by the persons he had delivered CCL Impex Malaysia\u2019s vegetables to. 62', 'In his cross-examination, he denied giving the contemporaneous statement, and reiterated that the blue plastic bag and its contents were dropped into the Lorry by the person who collected the cabbages from Mohd Nor. In re-examination, he stated that during his one and a half years\u2019 experience as a lorry driver for CCL Impex Malaysia, he had never collected any money from the customers whom he delivered the vegetables to. 63', '72\\u2003I agreed with the Prosecution that at the point of arrest, Hari knew that the blue plastic bag was a key piece of incriminating evidence against him in relation to the illegal transaction, and he sought to lie about its origin. I did not rely on Hari\u2019s contemporaneous statement on the purpose of the payment. It was clear that the delivery to the \u201cbald guy\u201d arose from Hari\u2019s arrangement with Koma, and had nothing to do with his employment with CCL Impex Malaysia. As stated above, Hari\u2019s evidence was corroborated by Nor\u2019s account. Further, Nor also testified that neither he, Hari nor Vikneswaran had collected any money from the persons they delivered vegetables to on 13 August 2015.', '73\\u2003In addition, according to the testimony of the managing director of CCL Impex Malaysia and CCL Impex Singapore, Chua Zhong Sheng, CCL Impex Malaysia would not receive any payment from the parties they delivered vegetables to. CCL Impex Malaysia has only one client, which is CCL Impex Singapore. CCL Impex Singapore would receive orders for vegetables from their Singapore customers and the Singapore customers would make payments directly to CCL Impex Singapore. CCL Impex Singapore would then compile the orders from their customers and place the orders for vegetables with CCL Impex Malaysia which would then deliver the vegetables to CCL Impex Singapore\u2019s clients. As such, CCL Impex Malaysia would not and need not receive any form of payment from CCL Impex Singapore\u2019s customers.', '74\\u2003By all of the foregoing, not only did Jumaat know that he was not merely collecting vegetables, he also knew that the eight cabbages he collected had valuable items within them. When he placed the blue plastic bag containing the sum of $18,500 inside the Lorry after collecting the eight cabbages, he meant it to be in exchange for the delivery of the items contained within the eight cabbages. The sum of $18,500 is substantial. The handing over of this substantial amount in the course of the transaction completely demolished Jumaat\u2019s claim that he was merely tasked to collect vegetables, and no more.', '75\\u2003Third, I turn to the act of cutting open the cabbages. Within minutes of collecting the plastic bags containing the cabbages from the Lorry, Jumaat cut open the wrapping of two of the cabbages, and peeled open the leaves. He did enough to ascertain the two cabbages contained a bundle of drugs each.', '76\\u2003I agreed with the Prosecution that if Jumaat\u2019s case was true and that he was merely collecting the vegetables for Siva to pass on to Ravi, there was no reason for Jumaat to do so. In his statements and in giving evidence in court, Jumaat explained that he thought the cabbages looked strange or different, and he opened them to check on them. He also tried to explain that this was because the cabbages were packed in a \u201cdifferent\u201d way (as they were wrapped within two layers of plastic rather than in newspaper). He also said that if he did not remove the wrappings, the cabbages would rot and smell. 64', '77\\u2003I found Jumaat\u2019s explanations illogical. If his role was merely to collect the vegetables and later pass them on to Ravi, he could have just called Siva to inform him of how the cabbages were wrapped, and the state of the cabbages. He should also have spoken to Siva to ask for permission to check on the cabbages. After all, Jumaat said the cabbages did not belong to him. Taking the decision to unwrap not just one, but two of the cabbages, and then to peel open the leaves, so as to satisfy his own concerns was not the action of someone whose task was merely to collect vegetables for a friend. On the contrary, Jumaat\u2019s conduct was far more consistent with that of someone expecting items to be in the cabbages, and proceeding to inspect the items contained within.'"}

The defendant\u2019s averment that she was unable to book an appointment \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nTay Yun Chwan Henry v  Chan Siew Lee Jannie [2018]  SGHC  181\n18for August  2017 due to a delay in the disbursement of funds  from TYC \nInvestment was of no merit. There was nothing to suggest that the defendant \nhad absolutely no other sources of funds for her psychiatric treatment. It was \nincumbent on the defendant to ensure that she had the funds for her psychiatric \ntreatment sessions. \n49 I should add that while the defendant did adduce the second psychiatric \nreport indicating  that she was suffering from Major Depressive Disorder,  the \npsychiatric evidence  did not suggest that the defendant was not aware and \nshould not be held accountable for her actions.  In my view, the psychiatric \nevidence had no bearing  on the question of liability, and was instead more \nrelevant to the question of the appropriate  sentence to be imposed. It is to that \nquestion that I now turn.\nSentencing\n50 Having  found that the defendant  had breached the conditions  on which  \nthe Committal Order was suspended, what  remained was the question of the \nappropriate orders to be made.\n51 Where the terms of a suspended order  for committal have been breached  \nand the suspension is therefore to be lifted, the court  is not invariably bound to \nimpose the suspended  sentence. Rather,  the court has an unfettered discretion to \ndo what is just in the circumstances. This may entail imposing the suspended \nsentence in whole or in part, substituting  it with a fine, or even imposing no \npenalty at all (Tan  Beow Hiong at [66]). On this footing, the defendant submitted \nthat an imprisonment term would be inappropriate and asked  that I exercise  my \ndiscretion by imposing orders requiring her to seek further psychiatric  treatment \ninstead. \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nTay Yun Chwan Henry v  Chan Siew Lee Jannie [2018]  SGHC  181\n1952 When I suspended  the Committal Order, it should have been  clear to the \ndefendant that that was her last chance at avoiding imprisonment. Yet, since 2 \nAugust 2017 when the Committal Order  was suspended,  the defendant had \ncontinued to act in blatant disregard of the Consent Judgment and the conditions \nunder which the Committal Order was suspended. Three sets of committal \nproceedings have had to be commenced against her. On multiple occasions, the \ndefendant simply proceeded to send emails in breach  of the very court orders or \nundertakings given  just immediately prior. She also continued  to do so in the \nmidst of the various  sets of committal proceedings. Her conduct  has been \nunremorseful and unrepentant. In fact, she has been  intentionally sending the \noffending emails to new recipients. \n53 The defendant  claimed that in her emails, she was merely raising family \nmatters, and that her actions were  desperate  calls for help in the hope of eliciting  \nsome form of positive response from the plaintiff  or others  towards the plight \nof her daughter. In my view,  this submission  was entirely without merit.  I failed \nto see how her wilful,  unrestrained and irresponsible behaviour of sending  the \noffending emails to a large  number of recipients could possibly be meant to help \nthe situation for herself, for her daughter or for her family. This was of no \nmitigating value.\n54 I did, however, give some  mitigating weight to the defendant\u2019s \npsychiatric condition;  in particular, Dr Kua\u2019s  assessment that the defendant\u2019s \ncondition had worsened and that she was suffering from Major Depressive  \nDisorder. I accepted  that the defendant was labouring under  severe stress  at the \ntime of the breaches, no doubt exacerbated  in part by her psychiatric condition, \nas well as her having  to deal with the other legal  proceedings commenced \nagainst her and having to care for her daughter.  While this did not absolve her \nof liability for her acts, it was of some mitigating value. In that regard,  I decided  \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nTay Yun Chwan Henry v  Chan Siew Lee Jannie [2018]  SGHC  181\n20not to increase the  imprisonment  term to be imposed.\n55 Accordingly,  I lifted the suspension on the Committal  Order, and \nimposed the original sentence under the Committal Order,  viz, two weeks\u2019 \nimprisonment, on the defendant.

All that Leong had told her was that with a caveat, she would be notified  \nif the Vendors tried to deal  with  the Property.128 \n57 After the Defendant  discharged itself from  representing Zhang in the \ntransaction of the Property, Leong  still asked Zhang whether  she had received \nthe 21 days\u2019 notice from  the Vendors and she told him not to bother about the \nVendors because she would deal with them.129 At this time, the Defendant was \n125 NE 20\/3\/2018 at  pp 76\u201377; 21\/3\/2018 at  pp 22\u201323. \n126 NE 22\/3\/2018 at  p 31.\n127 Defendant\u2019s  submissions at para 60.\n128 NE 23\/3\/2018 at  p 36.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nZhang Run  Zi v Ascentsia  Law Corp [2018]  SGHC  183\n29still representing Zhang for her purchase of the Jalan Jurong  Kechil  property, \nwhich was concluded uneventfully  in end April or early May.130 On or around \n21 June 2007, Leong  acceded to Zhang\u2019s request to help her draft a letter in \nEnglish to the Vendors  to seek a meeting with them. On 5 July 2007, the \nVendors\u2019 solicitors  sent the Defendant  a letter stating  that Zhang had elected not \nto proceed with the purchase of the Property and demanded  the withdrawal of \nthe First Caveat lodged in her favour.  Leong forwarded this letter  to Zhang and \nadvised her verbally to withdraw the First Caveat.131 The Defendant also sent a \nletter on 19 July 2007 to Zhang reminding her to withdraw the First Caveat  \nimmediately.132 Zhang paid no heed  to this. As a result, the Vendors  commenced \nOS No 1639 of 2007 to expunge the  First  Caveat  (see [20] supra).\nMy decision  \n58 I have set out the case background, the litigation history  and the parties\u2019 \nrespective cases in some  detail given that the dispute dates back  to January 2007 \nand numerous factual allegations were made by both Zhang and Leong. To \ncomplicate matters  further,  Zhang commenced this action in January 2013 when \nit was on the verge  of becoming time-barred, and the trial commenced only in \nMarch 2018. It was inevitable that memories would have faded and \ndiscrepancies would emerge  in the parties\u2019  recollection of the events, \nparticularly in areas  where no corroborative documentary evidence was in \nexistence.\n59 The main issue at trial was whether the Defendant had acted with the \n129 Leong\u2019s AEIC at para 49.\n130 NE 20\/3\/2018 at  pp 76\u201377. \n131 Leong\u2019s AEIC at paras 51 and 52.\n132 Leong\u2019s AEIC at para 53.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nZhang Run  Zi v Ascentsia  Law Corp [2018]  SGHC  183\n30standard of care required in representing  Zhang in the purchase  of the Property.  \nIt was not disputed that the Defendant did enter into a solicitor-client \nrelationship with Zhang, though the exact commencement and duration  of this \nrelationship was disputed.  Both  parties agreed that the standard of care is that \nexpected of a reasonably  competent and diligent conveyancing solicitor  (Su Ah \nTee and others v Allister Lim and Thrumurgan (sued as a firm) and another  \n(William Cheng and others,  third parties) [2014]  SGHC 159 (\u201cSu Ah Tee\u201d) at \n[70]). The ambit  of a solicitor\u2019s duty depends  on the retainer and the particular \ncircumstances of the case (Yeo Yoke Mui v Ng Liang Poh [1999] 2 SLR(R) 701 \n(\u201cYeo  Yoke  Mui\u201d)). \n60 The crucial events that arose  for consideration  in determining whether \nthe Defendant had breached its standard  of care were: (a) the timing of the \nappointment of the Defendant to act for Zhang  in the purchase  of the Property; \n(b) whether  any advice was given  on Clause 11; (c) the searches conducted  on \nthe Property; (d) whether  any advice was given on the timeline of the purchase \nand whether  the Vendors  could sell the Property  to a third party; (e) the timing \nof the discharge of the Defendant from representing  Zhang in the purchase  of \nthe Property; and (f) whether any advice was given on the statutory  amendment \nand the sale of the Shanghai property. I shall proceed to address these in turn \nbefore making my concluding observations  on the credibility  of Zhang and \nLeong. \nTiming of the Defendant\u2019s appointment\n61 Zhang argued that the Defendant had been  acting for her in the purchase \nof the Property since 5 January 2007, which was the first time she had shown  \nLeong the OTP.133 Her position was that the Defendant had voluntarily assumed \n133 NE 21\/3\/2018 at  p 17.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nZhang Run  Zi v Ascentsia  Law Corp [2018]  SGHC  183\n31responsibility towards her in the purchase of the Property because Leong had \nlooked at the OTP and given her some advice.  She relied on Spandeck (supra \n[27]),  where the court held at [81] that where a person \u201cvoluntarily assumes \nresponsibility\u201d for his acts or omissions  towards another, and the other relies on \nit, it is only fair and just that the law should  hold the first person liable  for \nnegligence. In the present case, Zhang submitted that since  Leong  had given her \nsome advice since  5 January  2007, the Defendant  had voluntarily assumed  \nresponsibility, and therefore, its duty of care towards her in relation to the \npurchase of the  Property started from  5 January  2007.\n62 On the facts, I found that Zhang  showed Leong the OTP  for the Property \nduring the meeting on 5 January 2007 and Leong  did give her some advice  out \nof goodwill on the clauses  in the OTP. Nevertheless, Zhang expressly told \nLeong during the meeting that she wanted to appoint him to act for her only for \nthe purchase of the Jalan  Jurong Kechil  property,  and not for the Property.  In \nresponse, Leong told her to appoint a solicitor to represent her in the purchase  \nof the Property  as soon as possible. To my mind, this version  of events was the \nonly logical explanation considering that the Defendant had taken on full \nresponsibilities as a law firm in relation to the Jalan  Jurong Kechil property after \nthe 5 January 2007 meeting, but not in relation to the Property. Zhang testified \nthat she had also left everything in relation  to the Jalan Jurong  Kechil property  \nfor the Defendant to handle,134 in contrast to the multiple searches and inquiries \non the Property she had conducted on her own. She expended all this effort by \nherself, as the Defendant had only been  appointed to act for her in relation to \nthe purchase of one of the two properties. In all probability, her decisions were \ndriven primarily by both cost and financing  considerations. The Defendant was \nnot unwilling or unable to act for her in relation  to both property purchases had \n134 NE 20\/3\/2018 at  pp 37\u201338. \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nZhang Run  Zi v Ascentsia  Law Corp [2018]  SGHC  183\n32she so instructed.  Alternatively, she could have appointed two sets of lawyers \nto act for her in respect of the two transactions, as advised by Leong. In the \ncircumstances, Leong  did not voluntarily assume responsibility  as Zhang\u2019s \nsolicitor in relation to the purchase of the Property  from the time they met on 5 \nJanuary 2007,  and the duty of care set out in Spandeck did not arise then.  The \nDefendant could not in any event be held liable  for Zhang\u2019s  alleged loss arising \nfrom payment of the 1% option fee, as she had made  this payment without  first \nseeking any legal advice. \n63 Moreover,  Zhang conceded  that everything  that Leong suggested  that \nshe should do before  24 January 2007 was done wholly  out of goodwill since \nZhang was an existing client of the Defendant.135 She also testified in court that \nshe did not have  any solicitor representing her on 22 January 2007,136 she only \nmade up her mind on 23 January 2007 to appoint Leong as the solicitor for the \npurchase of Property,137 and that she handed  him all the relevant  searches she \nhad conducted on the Property to Leong on 24 January 2007.138 Leong had \nnothing to act on until he was provided  with all the relevant documents and until \nhe was appointed  on 24 January 2007. The decision of Su Ah Tee (at [50]\u2013[57]) \nwas relevant  to the present facts. The question of the timing of retainer  in \nrelation to a property purchase also arose  in that case, and the High Court  held \nthat the retainer  only arose after the plaintiff  handed the option to purchase (with  \nthe correct purchaser stated) and the correct  cheque to the solicitor despite prior \ncommunications between  them regarding the property purchase.  It was only \nnecessary for the solicitor  to read and act on the documents relating to the sale \n135 NE 21\/3\/2018 at  p 16.\n136 NE 20\/3\/2018 at  p 43. \n137 NE 20\/3\/2018 at  p 48.\n138 NE 20\/3\/2018 at  p 44. \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nZhang Run  Zi v Ascentsia  Law Corp [2018]  SGHC  183\n33and purchase  of the property after receiving the relevant documents from  the \nplaintiff (at [55]). In the present case, the Defendant  was appointed to act and \ngiven the relevant documents only on 24 January  2007, and its duty to Zhang  in \nrelation to the purchase of the Property  arose  only from that  day. \nAdvice in relation to Clause 11\n64 Zhang\u2019s evidence was that the Defendant  had at no time advised  her on \nClause 11 of the OTP. On the other hand, Leong\u2019s  version was that he had \nexplained to Zhang the effect of Clause  11 on 5 January 2007, that she would \nnot be able to get a refund  of the 4% deposit given to exercise the OTP in the \nevent that the Property was affected by road reserves. On 24 January  2007, the \nday of the exercise  of the OTP, he warned her again that she would not get a \nrefund of  the deposit if she discovered  problems with the  Property.139\n65 I acknowledged that there  was no documentary evidence to show that \nLeong had in fact advised her on the effect of Clause 11. Nevertheless, I \npreferred and accepted Leong\u2019s evidence that he had advised her on the effect \nof Clause 11. Zhang had herself affirmed in two affidavits  for MC Suit No 2619 \nof 2008 and for OS No 1639 of 2007 respectively  that Leong had informed her \nthat \u201cthere was an agreement in the contract which  stated that after payment of \n4% of the deposit,  [she] would  not be able to get a refund if [she found] any \nproblems with the [P]roperty\u201d.140 This meant  that she was aware she would \nforfeit the deposit if she found any problems with the Property, which in essence \ncovered the effect  of Clause 11. She could not now conveniently distance  herself \nfrom the affidavits that she had affirmed  a few years earlier on the basis that she \naffirmed them in a hurry  or on account  of not having  understood  them fully \n139 NE 21\/3\/2018 at  p 64.\n140 Defendant\u2019s  BOD  at pp 85 and  106.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nZhang Run  Zi v Ascentsia  Law Corp [2018]  SGHC  183\n34because of her alleged  poor command of English (see [92] below). \nConduct of  the property searches\n66 I found that Zhang was satisfied  that there  were no problems with the \nProperty, having  conducted her own searches  with CrimsonLogic and enquiries \nwith the URA, and the Defendant had exercised  the OTP based on her firm \ninstructions. She only left the Defendant with about  two hours to exercise the \nOTP before it expired. The Defendant did not have sufficient time to conduct  a \nthorough search on the Property, so it decided to conduct the title search  and \nbankruptcy searches on the Vendors because  it assessed these  to be of the \nhighest priority. It immediately applied for the rest of the requisite searches  the \nfollowing day.\n67 In relation to the road line plan of the Property, Leong did see the words \n\u201cRoad Line Plan\u201d on the blurry document that Zhang  showed him on 5 January  \n2007, but he did not know what the document  was for and did not attempt  to \ninterpret it for her,141 since it was shown to him before he was appointed. He had \nasked her to check with CrimsonLogic  on the blurry document then. On 24 \nJanuary 2007, Leong warned Zhang again that she would not get back  the \ndeposit if she were to find any problems with the Property later,  and he asked  \nher about the road line plan of the Property. Although there was no road line \nplan in the documents obtained by Zhang, Zhang  nevertheless instructed Leong  \nto exercise the OTP. Based on Zhang\u2019s confidence in her own searches, she had \nmade a deliberate  and conscious decision  to proceed with the OTP  despite  \nLeong\u2019s warnings of the potential risks. Having regard to the fact that the \nDefendant was appointed to act only about  two hours to the expiry of the OTP, \nit was not negligent  for the Defendant  to have exercised the OTP  on 24 January \n141 NE 21\/3\/2018 at  p 63. \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nZhang Run  Zi v Ascentsia  Law Corp [2018]  SGHC  183\n352007 on Zhang\u2019s instructions  even though it had not itself conducted  complete \nsearches on the Property.

{"casename":"2018_SGHC_188","fact":"'4\\u2003The two proceeded charges against the appellant under s 17(1)(e) of the MRA read as follows:', '5\\u2003The appellant admitted to the statement of facts without qualification. In November 2013, the Health Sciences Authority (\u201cHSA\u201d) received information that the appellant was providing freelance beauty services, including the administering of dermal fillers. Acting upon this information, officers from the HSA and the Ministry of Health raided the appellant\u2019s home on 24 February 2014 and seized various exhibits, including used or partially used syringes containing products under the brand \u201cPromoitalia Skinfill\u201d. Some of the vials and syringes of Promoitalia Skinfill product had been re-sealed in packaging with staples and had names, contact details and dates written on them. The officers also seized sheets of paper containing the details of approximately 74 customers dating back to 2009.', '6\\u2003A statement was recorded from the appellant in which she said that the Promoitalia Skinfill products were used to make the skin firmer. The products were categorised into grades such as \u201csilver, \u201cgold\u201d, \u201cdiamond\u201d, \u201cadvanced\u201d and \u201ccarbonium\u201d, according to their levels of efficacy. The appellant had apparently learnt about Promoitalia Skinfill products when she attended a briefing about these products at an exhibition in Hong Kong. She had purchased the products from Hong Kong at various times between 2010 and 21 February 2014, and had also been given some left-over stock by a Promoitalia sales manager after she attended an \u201cInternational Master Course on Aging Skin\u201d in 2013. The appellant claimed that she had been trained in how to administer the products by Italian doctors in Hong Kong in 2010.', '7\\u2003The appellant started providing home-based beauty services from her home in 2012. All of the Promoitalia Skinfill products seized from there were used in these beauty services. It is not in dispute that her home was a non-sterile environment.', '8\\u2003The appellant produced a receipt from November 2012 which showed that she had spent between \u20ac120 and \u20ac130 for each box of Promoitalia Skinfill products of the diamond, gold and advanced grades, and \u20ac260 for each box of Promoitalia Skinfill products of the carbonium grade. Each box contained either one or two sets of products, each comprising a syringe, needle and hyaluronic acid. The appellant would charge her customers between $250 and $500 for each set. Based on the average exchange rate in 2012, it was estimated that the appellant made a profit of between $46 and $306 for each set of Promoitalia Skinfill products which she sold. Based on the 33 used or partially used syringes of Promoitalia Skinfill product seized from the appellant\u2019s home, she would have made an estimated profit of between $1,518 and $10,098.', '9\\u2003Between sometime in 2012 and 13 March 2013, a Ms Guan Na (\u201cMs Guan\u201d) visited the appellant for procedures to remove her wrinkles and enhance her appearance. The appellant injected Ms Guan\u2019s forehead, cheeks and temple with a Promoitalia Skinfill product called \u201cSkinfill soft\u201d. Ms Guan paid the appellant $250 for each visit. After her last visit on 13 March 2013, Ms Guan complained of redness, inflammation and rashes on her face. She met with the appellant and demanded to know what product the appellant had injected into her face, whereupon the appellant produced a vial containing \u201cSkinfill soft\u201d. The procedures which the appellant performed on Ms Guan formed the subject of the first charge under s 17(1)(e) of the MRA.', '10\\u2003During the raid on the appellant\u2019s residence, officers found a vial of \u201cSkinfill Carbonium Mini\u201d that had been re-sealed in its original packaging with staples, and which bore the name \u201cCally\u201d as well as a contact number. Investigations revealed that \u201cCally\u201d was one Huang Jindi (\u201cMs Huang\u201d). One of Ms Huang\u2019s friends had recommended that she visit the appellant for treatment to enhance her appearance. In January 2014, Ms Huang visited the appellant and the appellant injected her cheeks and nose with \u201cSkinfill Carbonium Mini\u201d. After the procedure, the appellant placed the syringe back into its packaging and secured the package with staples as she intended to reuse the remaining product on Ms Huang when she returned for further treatment. Ms Huang was to be charged $250 for the treatment, but she never paid this sum to the appellant because the appellant\u2019s flat was raided before Ms Huang had the opportunity to return. It was common ground between the parties that Ms Huang did not suffer any ill effects from the filler injection performed by the appellant. The procedure which the appellant performed on Ms Huang formed the subject of the second charge against the appellant under s 17(1)(e) of the MRA.', '11\\u2003The Promoitalia Skinfill products seized from the appellant\u2019s flat were subsequently examined by Dr Rama Sethuraman (\u201cDr Sethuraman\u201d) from the HSA\u2019s Medical Devices Branch. Dr Sethuraman found that none of the Promoitalia Skinfill products were registered with the HSA as medical devices under the Health Products Act (Cap 122D, 2008 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe HPA\u201d).', '12\\u2003Dr Sethuraman also prepared a report in which he stated that the Promoitalia Skinfill products were classified as \u201cClass D\u201d devices. To put this in context, the HSA classifies medical devices into four risk classes \u2013 Class A to Class D. At one end of the range, Class A devices are considered \u201clow risk\u201d; while at the other end, Class D devices are considered \u201chigh risk\u201d. Regulatory controls are imposed based on the risk associated with the use of a medical device. Classification depends on several factors, including how long the device is intended to be in use, whether the device is invasive, whether the device is implantable, and whether the device contains a drug or biologic component. Dr Sethuraman classified the Promoitalia Skinfill products as Class D products because they were implantable medical devices designed for long-term use and were intended to be wholly or mainly absorbed by the human body.', '13\\u2003Dr Sethuraman\u2019s report also discussed the risks associated with unregistered medical devices generally, as well as the dangers associated specifically with unregistered dermal fillers. He noted that unregistered medical devices would not have had their safety and performance assessed, and so may not conform to the HSA\u2019s requirements. Unregistered dermal fillers in particular might be defective and unsafe for human use. They might contain harmful substances. They also might not have been manufactured according to the applicable quality standards, and may have been inadequately sterilised, which presented a high risk that such medical devices may be contaminated with microbes. Dermal fillers might also have been inadequately labelled and product owners might not have enough information as to the shelf life and proper usage of these products. Some of the effects which could result from the use of such products included:', '(a)\\u2003injection-related reactions such as bruising, swelling, pain, itching, redness or tenderness;', '(b)\\u2003infections which could lead to complications if untreated;', '(c)\\u2003the formation of hardened or calloused skin or nodules at the site of the injection; and', '(d)\\u2003systemic complications including \u201cvascular compromise\u201d due to the inadvertent injection of an implant into a blood vessel. This could result in blanching, discolouration, necrosis or ulceration. In rare cases, this could lead to visual loss or stroke.', '14\\u2003Apart from the two charges under s 17(1)(e) of the MRA, the appellant also pleaded guilty to two charges under s 15(1) of the HPA for possession of an unregistered health product (this being the Promoitalia Skinfill products) for the purpose of supply. She also consented to having one charge under s 17(1)(e) of the MRA and two charges under s 15(1) of the HPA taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing.', '15\\u2003The District Judge accepted the appellant\u2019s plea of guilt in respect of the proceeded charges and convicted her accordingly. He sentenced the accused to two months\u2019 imprisonment for each of the MRA charges, with both sentences to run concurrently. He also imposed fines of $2,500 and $2,000 for the first and second HPA charges respectively: see Public Prosecutor v Neo Ah Luan [2018] SGDC 36 (the \u201cGD\u201d) at [2]. I shall discuss his reasons in more detail at [46]\u2013[51] below.', '16\\u2003The appellant appeals only against the custodial sentences imposed by the District Judge in respect of the charges under s 17(1)(e) of the MRA. She does not appeal against the fines imposed in respect of the charges under s 15(1) of the HPA and I therefore do not consider those.'"}
{"casename":"2018_SGHC_189","fact":"'3\\u2003The accused, Sukla Lalatendu (\u201cthe Accused\u201d), was a 42-year-old Indian national and a Singapore Permanent Resident at the time of the offences. He was also the owner of a car insurance company. He faced a total of three charges, all of which were for the offence of theft in dwelling under s 380 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (\u201cPC\u201d) which provides as follows:', '4\\u2003Two of the three charges were proceeded with, and the Accused was convicted on the Statement of Facts, the relevant extracts of which may be summarised as follows:', '(a)\\u2003First charge: On 27 April 2017, the Accused committed theft in dwelling of a \u201cLogitech Spotlight Presentation Remote\u201d valued at $169.00 from a Popular bookstore at United Square Shopping Mall (\u201cUnited Square\u201d). The bookstore\u2019s surveillance footage showed the Accused behaving suspiciously at the location where the remotes were kept. Subsequent investigations revealed that at or about 6.13pm that day, the Accused dishonestly took a remote which was displayed on a shelf in the bookstore and placed it in a plastic bag that he was carrying. He then left the bookstore with the remote without paying for it. United Square is a building used for the custody of property, and the stolen remote was taken out of the possession of the bookstore manager. There was no mention in the Statement of Facts of whether the stolen remote was subsequently recovered.', '(b)\\u2003Second charge: On 1 May 2017, the Accused committed theft in dwelling of a \u201cSamsung Gear 360 Globe handheld camera\u201d valued at $348.00 from a Samsung Experience Store at No 3 Gateway Drive Westgate (\u201cWestgate\u201d). The store\u2019s surveillance footage showed that at or about 7.40pm that day, the Accused had taken the camera and left the store without making payment for it. Subsequent investigations revealed that the Accused had gone to Westgate at about 7.15pm that day. He entered the Samsung Experience Store and noticed the camera which was left unlocked on one of the shelves. The Accused then decided to steal the camera. He placed the camera in his bag and left the store without paying for it. At the material time, the Accused had with him a sum of between $150 and $200 in cash and a credit card. The stolen camera was subsequently recovered from the Accused and no sales record was registered for it at the store. Westgate is a building used for the custody of property, and the stolen camera was taken out of the possession of the complainant who was the manager of the store.', '5\\u2003The Accused consented to a third charge of theft in dwelling on 6 May 2017 of a \u201cHue Tap Switch\u201d valued at $89.00 from a store called Harvey Norman located at Millennia Walk being taken into consideration (\u201cTIC\u201d) for the purpose of sentencing.', '6\\u2003The Accused had two sets of convictions prior to the present offences, one set of which was for property-related offences:', '7\\u2003Notably, the set of convictions dated 19 June 2009 were spent convictions. Section 7E of the Registration of Criminals Act (Cap 268, 1985 Rev Ed) (\u201cROCA\u201d) provides for the legal effect of such convictions. Amongst other things, s 7E(1) of the ROCA deems the offender, in certain circumstances, to have had \u201cno record\u201d of his convictions which are spent or treated as spent. However, the protective provisions in ss 7E(1)(a) and (c) of the ROCA are subject to the caveat in s 7E(2)(c) and therefore do not extend to \u201cany proceedings before a court\u201d or to \u201cany decision by a court, including any decision as to sentence\u201d. On that basis, it would not be improper for me to mention or consider the Accused\u2019s convictions dated 19 June 2009. Nor was it improper for the district judge below (\u201cthe DJ\u201d) to have done the same in his grounds of decision (at [20] and [27]). The Accused did not submit otherwise. In any event, no material weight could be placed on these convictions given the lapse of time and the fact that they did not concern property-related offences.', '8\\u2003The events which transpired in the proceedings below were heavily disputed. I set them out briefly here and will elaborate on them later in this judgment.', '9\\u2003Proceedings against the Accused were initiated in the State Courts on 19 May 2017. On 30 October 2017, the DJ conducted a pre-trial conference (\u201cthe 30 October PTC\u201d) and saw both the Accused and a deputy public prosecutor, Ms Lim Yu Hui (\u201cDPP Lim\u201d), in chambers. The Accused was unrepresented at that time, and he continued to act in person throughout the course of the proceedings below as well as in the appeal before me.', '10\\u2003On 8 November 2017, a hearing was conducted in open court (\u201cthe 8 November PG Hearing\u201d) where the Accused pleaded guilty to the two proceeded charges and consented to the third charge being TIC for the purpose of sentencing. The DJ then imposed the following sentences:', '11\\u2003On 22 November 2017, which was the date the Accused was supposed to commence serving his sentence, he appeared before the DJ and sought a stay of execution pending appeal (\u201cthe 22 November Stay Hearing\u201d).', '12\\u2003On 2 January 2018, the DJ released his grounds of decision: see Public Prosecutor v Sukla Lalatendu [2018] SGDC 6 (\u201cGD\u201d). I will discuss this in further detail below.', '13\\u2003On 21 November 2017, the Accused filed a Notice of Appeal stating that he was dissatisfied with the sentence imposed by the DJ. However, in his Petition of Appeal dated 17 January 2018, the Accused raised several arguments which did not relate to the sentence imposed, including that he had only pleaded guilty because \u201cof the record promises and threats [sic]\u201d, and that he had been \u201cdenied a constitutional right to counsel\u201d.', '14\\u2003The Accused subsequently tendered three sets of submissions dated 14, 21, and 28 March 2018, which I will refer to the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Submissions respectively. The submissions focused primarily on his claim that even though he had not committed the offences, he had pleaded guilty to the charges because \u201che was misguided by the [DJ] and so as not to drag the case unnecessarily\u201d. In the submissions, he also made several factual allegations about what the DJ had told him at the 30 October PTC. Although the Accused did not expressly state that he wished to retract his plea of guilt or file any application for criminal revision for that purpose, his intention to do just that seemed clear to me.', '15\\u2003At the hearing before me on 3 April 2018, the Accused orally confirmed that he was seeking to retract his plea of guilt that had been taken at the 8 November PG Hearing. Anticipating this, the Prosecution had on 13 March 2018 filed Criminal Motion No 12 of 2018 (\u201cCM 12\u201d) in which it sought leave to adduce an affidavit deposed to by DPP Lim as to her version of what had transpired in chambers at the 30 October PTC (\u201cthe Affidavit\u201d).'"}
{"casename":"2018_SGHC_19","fact":"Background: Arrest,  seizure  of exhibits and analyses\n5 The accused is a male Singaporean who was 48 years old at the time of \nthe offence on 18 March 2015. He was a landscape  subcontractor. In outline, \nthe Prosecution\u2019s case was that a day before  the accused was arrested,  he had \nreceived three bundles of diamorphine from one \u201cDatuk\u201d. He was to repack \nthem into smaller packets  and deliver  them  to buyers on \u201cDatuk\u2019s\u201d instructions. \nOn the morning  of 18 March 2015, he brought these  three bundles  into his rented \n2\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Mohd Aziz bin Hussain [2018]  SGHC  19\nminivan bearing licence plate  number  GW2420D (\u201cthe van\u201d) and started  \nrepacking them into smaller sachets.  He fully repacked only one of the three  \nbundles and partially repacked  the second bundle. He left a third bundle (C1A1)  \n(\u201cthe third bundle\u201d) intact. The third bundle  was later found to contain not less \nthan 16.52 grams of diamorphine.\n6 At about 9.00 am, the accused drove  the van to Block 471, Tampines \nStreet 44. He parked the van and proceeded  to unit #03-216 (\u201cthe flat\u201d) where \nRashid and Nordiana resided, bringing with him the repacked bundle and the \npartially repacked bundle, and leaving  the third bundle in the van. He also \nbrought along cash in varying denominations of $5, $10, $50 or $100 to be \nsorted into bundles. When he arrived at the flat, Rashid opened the door and let \nhim in. Nordiana was still asleep. Rashid  then went to the toilet and the accused \nlaid out newspaper on the floor of the living room and started to repack  the drugs \ninto smaller  sachets.  He later persuaded  Rashid and Nordiana  to assist him in \nrepacking the  drugs and in counting and sorting the  cash.\n7 Officers  from the Central  Narcotics Bureau (\u201cCNB\u201d) had begun  \nsurveillance near the flat after 9.00 am, as they had targeted Rashid  as a suspect \ninvolved in drug activities. The accused left the flat at around 10.00 am with the \nrepacked drugs. After placing the drugs  in the van, he drove off. When the \naccused realised  that he was being followed  by CNB officers, he abandoned the \nvan and started running. With the CNB officers  in pursuit, the accused tripped  \nand fell and was consequently  restrained and arrested. As the accused had hurt \nhis right arm upon falling  down, he was sent to Changi General Hospital \n(\u201cCGH\u201d) for medical attention. He was later found to have a fractured right \nhumerus. \n3\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Mohd Aziz bin Hussain [2018]  SGHC  19\n8 After the accused was sent to CGH, a contemporaneous statement1 was \ntaken from  him. He confirmed that he was able to give a statement after he had \nbeen given  medication. He admitted  that the items in his van were drugs  \n(specifically, heroin) but he claimed  that he was only helping to deliver the \ndrugs to a \u201cbudak motor\u201d for \u201cAcit\u201d (ie, Rashid) as a favour, for which  he would \nnot be paid. He claimed that all the drugs belonged to Rashid.  A total of 49.98 \ngrams of diamorphine, with a gross weight  of 1399.7 grams, was recovered from \nthe van. He admitted that the contemporaneous statement was given voluntarily.\n9 The recovered drugs  were contained in two bags.  First,  there was a pink \npaper bag (B1 \u2013 P28) which was found between the driver\u2019s seat and the front \npassenger\u2019s seat. P28 contained a black bag (B1A  \u2013 P29) which in turn \ncontained a black drawstring bag (B1A1 \u2013 P30) in which nine packets of drugs  \nwere found. These  nine packets, within eight of which were  various  smaller \nsachets containing drugs,  had a gross weight of 940.9 grams. There was also a \ndigital weighing  scale (B1A1K \u2013 P40) stained with diamorphine and an empty  \npouch. \n10 Next, another  red plastic  bag (C1 \u2013 P42)  was found underneath the \ndriver\u2019s seat. Within it, there was a torn orange plastic bag (C1A  \u2013 P42),  which \nin turn contained a plastic bag (C1A1A \u2013 P43)  bound by a layer of black  tape \n(C1A1 \u2013 P43), and within C1A1A was one packet of drugs (C1A1A1 \u2013 P43) \nwhich had a gross weight of 458.8 grams. \n11 Apart from the drugs mentioned above,  various other  items  were \nrecovered from the van. A red sling bag (D1 \u2013 P44)  was found between  the \ndriver\u2019s seat and the front passenger\u2019s  seat. P44 contained numerous  \nmiscellaneous letters (D1B \u2013 P49) and one yellow \u201cFerrero\u201d paper bag (D1A \u2013 \n1 Marked as P122 (English  translation  in P125).\n4\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Mohd Aziz bin Hussain [2018]  SGHC  19\nP45) which in turn contained one red plastic  bag (D1A1 \u2013 P46). P46 was found \nto contain the  following  items:\n(a)one digital weighing  scale with a  black pouch (D1A1A);\n(b)two packets  each containing  numerous  empty packets (D1A1B);  and\n(c)one box containing one charger, one pair of scissors,  one receipt for \nthe purchase of plastic packets (D1A1C).\n12 The \u201cFerrero\u201d paper bag (P45) also contained numerous  other  empty  \npackets (D1A2  \u2013 P48) as well as one \u201cSamsung\u201d box containing one manual, \none travel charger and one receipt from  Sim Guan Electrical Shop (D1A3 \u2013 \nP48). Finally, in a black sling bag (E1 \u2013 P50) behind the driver\u2019s seat, there was \ncash amounting to S$24,145 (E1A  \u2013 P51; P52) and three mobile phones (E1B-\nMABH-HP1; E1B-MABH-HP2; E1B-MABH-HP3 \u2013 P53).\n13 The analysis of all the relevant drug exhibits with the total gross weight \nof 1399.7 grams by the Health  Sciences Authority (\u201cHSA\u201d) and the chain of \ncustody of all the exhibits were not disputed. It was common ground that the \nanalysis of the relevant drug exhibits revealed that they contained  not less than \n49.98 grams of diamorphine. In addition,  the Prosecution adduced records of \nphone calls and text messages  from the accused\u2019s  mobile phones.\n14 In summary, the evidence pertaining  to the accused\u2019s arrest,  the seizure \nof the exhibits, the HSA analyses and the analyses of the accused\u2019s mobile \nphone records  was generally not disputed. The accused sought to show through \nhis cross-examination of the CNB officers that he had been  tripped by a CNB  \nofficer and had been manhandled and assaulted  on his arrest, which resulted  in \nhis fractured  humerus.  However, the arresting officers confirmed that he \n5\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Mohd Aziz bin Hussain [2018]  SGHC  19\nstumbled and fell and this was what enabled  them to catch up with him and \narrest him. Necessary force had  to be used to subdue and handcuff him. \nThe ancillary hearing  \u2013 admissibility of the seven statements\n15 The accused\u2019s various statements  comprised a contemporaneous \nstatement, a cautioned statement recorded  under s 23 of the CPC, as well as six \n\u201clong\u201d investigative statements  recorded  under s 22 of the CPC.  In his \nstatements, the accused essentially  admitted to being in possession of all the \ndrug exhibits which were  found in his van. The contemporaneous statement  \n(P122 \u2013 English  translation in P125) was admitted in evidence  as the accused \naccepted that it was given  voluntarily.\n16 The accused challenged the admissibility of the remaining seven of his \ninvestigation statements (\u201cthe seven  statements\u201d). The first indication from the \naccused that he was disputing the admissibility of the seven statements emerged \nonly after Rashid  and Nordiana had both pleaded  guilty to reduced  charges and \nthe trial proper  was to commence.  Objections were then raised as to their \nproposed inclusion  in the  Agreed Bundle of  documents. \n17 As a consequence,  an ancillary hearing was convened to determine the \nadmissibility of the seven statements. In the course of the ancillary hearing,  the \nInvestigating Officer, Station Inspector Ranjeet Ram  Behari  (\u201cthe  IO\u201d), stated \nthat at no point did he offer any threat, inducement  or promise to the accused \nprior to or during the recording of the statements. He had always confirmed  \nwhen the statements were being recorded  that the accused was well and fine and \nable to give his statements. The accused  had also not mentioned  that he was in \npain or asked for any breaks or medication. Contrary to the accused\u2019s  claims, \nthe IO maintained that he had not induced  the accused to confess  by promising \n6\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Mohd Aziz bin Hussain [2018]  SGHC  19\nhim a reduced (non-capital) charge involving 14.99 grams of diamorphine. He \ndid not threaten  the accused by banging the table, telling him \u201cnot to be funny\u201d,  \nand saying that  his co-accused had  implicated  him.  \n18 The accused raised a variety of matters,  none of which had apparently \nsurfaced prior  to the commencement  of the trial. Other than his claims of feeling \nafraid of the IO and allegations about  the manner  in which the IO had allegedly \nthreatened or induced him, these revolved essentially around  the following \naspects. First, the accused claimed that he was tripped by a CNB officer during \nhis arrest and the fracture to his right arm was caused by the CNB  officers \nassaulting him when  he was pinned to the ground.  He claimed that he was in \nsuch excruciating pain that he lost consciousness. Second,  while  in the CNB \noperational vehicle, CNB  officers swore  at him and punched him in the face. \nThird, he insisted that he was never  seen by a doctor in the lock-up but was only \ngiven Panadol by the lock-up officers when he complained of pain and had run \nout of medication and the  cast for his fractured arm had come loose.   \n19 I need  only deal briefly  with the accused\u2019s claims in the ancillary \nhearing. The Prosecution\u2019s evidence resoundingly showed that none  of his \nclaims could be believed. First, the CNB  officers were in pursuit of the accused \nand were running behind him and would not have  been able to trip him. In any \ncase, the officers  testified that they did not trip him but that he had stumbled  \nand fallen. None of the officers recalled  that he had lost consciousness.  As for \nhis claims  of being punched  and sworn at in the CNB operational  vehicle,  none \nof this was put to any of the arresting  officers  when they testified. Taking  his \ncase at its highest, any injury  he might have  sustained during his arrest would \nnot be relevant  to the subsequent points in time when  the seven statements  were \nrecorded by the IO. There was a significant time lag since he was in CGH for a \n7\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Mohd Aziz bin Hussain [2018]  SGHC  19\nweek before  his first disputed  investigation statement  (ie, the s 23 CPC \ncautioned statement) was recorded on 25 March 2015.\n20 Next, his claims  of being in unbearable  pain and being denied medical \nattention or replenishment of painkillers were  patently unbelievable, as there  \nwas clear  objective evidence showing the contrary. It was manifestly clear that \nthe accused  had liberally exaggerated the pain he allegedly sustained from  his \nfractured humerus. He was seen by Dr Raymond Lim on 1 April 2015. His \nmedications, which included painkillers,  were topped up and the station diary \n(P237) showed that he had not made  any complaints during the period when he \nwas in the lock-up, nor raised any complaint  about his cast having come loose. \nThere was also uncontroverted evidence from a lock-up officer, Staff Sergeant  \nHidayatollah Khomeini bin Salleh, who stated that the station  lock-up did not \nstock any medication, not even Panadol, and the lock-up officers  would \ncertainly not simply  dispense medication  on request  to an accused person. If any \nmedication was required, they would call for a medical officer. \n21  Finally, the accused  had initially  said that he did not know what \u201c14.99\u201d  \nwas at the time he gave his cautioned statement.  If this had indeed been  the case, \nany such inducement or promise (ie, pertaining  to giving him \u201c14.99\u201d)  could \nnot possibly have operated on his mind. He subsequently changed his evidence  \nto align with his claim  that Rashid had told him he would only be implicated as \na \u201ccourier\u201d or \u201ctransporter\u201d and be charged  with \u201c14.99\u201d, and that he knew  this \nbefore he gave his cautioned statement.  \n22 The accused claimed that half of the statements he gave on 27 and 28 \nMarch 2015 were  the IO\u2019s words and the other half were Rashid\u2019s. He further \nclaimed that Rashid had taught him what  to say in his statements and the \ncontents were untrue. Even if the allegations  as to Rashid\u2019s  conduct were true, \n8\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Mohd Aziz bin Hussain [2018]  SGHC  19\nit would not affect the admissibility  of the statements in terms of whether they \nwere given voluntarily by the accused and without any inducement, threat or \npromise stemming from the IO or any other person in authority. I shall examine \nthis point  further at  [40]\u2013[41] below.\n23 After the ancillary hearing,  the seven statements were admitted in \nevidence as P240 to P246. I was satisfied that they were given voluntarily. In \nparticular, I did not accept that the accused had received any inducement, threat \nor promise from  the IO. If he was truly  fearful of the IO as he claimed, his fear \nappeared to have been wholly self-induced.  I saw no basis for his fanciful \nassertions about the IO putting words into his mouth and being responsible for \nportions of his statements. I also did not accept his claims  that he had been \ndenied medical attention or access to medication despite  his complaints of pain \nas a result  of his fractured  humerus.\nPossession and  knowledge of  the nature of the drugs\n24 The Prosecution submitted that the drugs were all in the possession of \nthe accused,  who knew that they were  diamorphine.  He had conceded as such \nin all his statements, beginning with the contemporaneous statement  (P122) he \ngave on the day of arrest. Moreover, at the Committal  Hearing  on 18 May 2016 \n(\u201cthe Committal Hearing\u201d), the accused stated  that the drugs were brought  to \nthe flat by him, and Rashid and Nordiana  had nothing to do with them.  It was \nonly during the trial that the accused  sought to disavow the seven  investigation \nstatements (though not his contemporaneous statement) and claim that he did \nnot know that he  had drugs  in his possession.\n25 The Prosecution thus sought to show  that there was proof to the requisite \nstandard of the accused\u2019s possession of the drugs, knowledge of the nature of \n9\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Mohd Aziz bin Hussain [2018]  SGHC  19\nthe drugs as well as his intention  of being in possession  of the drugs for the \npurpose of trafficking.\nAlternative \u2013 presumptions  of possession and knowledge\n26 In the alternative, the Prosecution  submitted that it could rely on the \npresumptions of possession (s 21) and knowledge (s 18(2)) in the MDA,  and \nshow proof of trafficking with regard to what the accused had admitted to in his \nstatements.\nPossession for the purpose of  trafficking\n27 Finally, the Prosecution relied in the alternative on the presumption of \ntrafficking in s 17 of the MDA and submitted that the accused had not proved \non a balance  of probabilities  that he did not possess the drugs for the purpose of \ntrafficking.\n28 At the close of the Prosecution\u2019s case, the Defence made no submission. \nI was satisfied that a prima facie case had been  established to warrant  calling \nfor the Defence. After I administered the standard allocution, the accused \nelected to give evidence in the Malay language.  He was one of three Defence \nwitnesses, the other two being his mother,  Mdm Ramja binte  Omaya (\u201cMdm \nRamja\u201d), and his wife, Mdm Salinah binte  Hashim (\u201cMdm  Salinah\u201d).\nThe Defence\u2019s case\n29 In putting forward his defence, the accused provided an account of his \nactivities on 17 March 2015, the day before his arrest. He said that he had taken \nhis wife and seven-year-old son to Adventure Cove at Sentosa for a day out. \nAfter sending  his wife to work at 8.30 pm that night, he spent  the night with his \nson in a rented room  in Geylang Lorong 27A.  He proceeded to meet Rashid the \n10\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Mohd Aziz bin Hussain [2018]  SGHC  19\nnext morning after he received an SMS from Rashid requesting him to meet  for \na discussion at the flat. He denied bringing any drugs up to the flat. He \nmaintained that the drugs were laid out on the floor and were  being repacked by \nRashid and Nordiana  in the flat when he arrived there on the morning of 18 \nMarch 2015. He also denied bringing  the drugs into the van.    \n30 To support his defence, the accused called his mother and wife to testify.  \nTheir evidence was focused mainly on how the amount of $24,145 came  to be \nfound in the black sling bag (E1 \u2013 P50) belonging to the accused. The accused \nclaimed that $20,000 was a loan given  to him from Mdm Ramja for toilet  \nrenovation work at his flat, while  the remaining $4,145 was from his \nlandscaping work. Mdm Ramja and Mdm Salinah both claimed  to be able to \nconfirm that the $20,000 was a loan for the accused. The accused said that \n$10,000 was meant as a deposit for the (unnamed) renovation contractor and the \nremaining $10,000 was  meant  for his wife.  \n31 The Defence was premised  largely  on the accused\u2019s  denials of his \nstatements. He contended  that the Prosecution  had failed to prove the allegations \nwhich constitute  the material elements of the charge, in particular,  that he did \ntraffic in the drugs by having them in his possession for the purpose of \ntrafficking. \n32 It was submitted, first, that there was no evidence that he had engaged \nin any of the acts of trafficking as defined within s 2 of the MDA,  and next, that \nthere was \u201cnot a shred of evidence that proves that the accused was in possession  \nof the drugs\u201d2. It was further submitted that the Prosecution had failed to adduce \nevidence showing  that he had the requisite  control over the drugs and \nknowledge as to the nature of the drugs.\n2 Accused\u2019s Written Submissions (\u201cAWS\u201d) at [22].\n11\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Mohd Aziz bin Hussain [2018]  SGHC  19\n33 The key contentions raised  by the accused  centred on discrediting the \nevidence of Rashid  and Nordiana. First,  it was submitted  that their evidence was \ninconsistent and unreliable as they had self-interested reasons to pin the blame \non the accused.  It was suggested that Rashid and Nordiana were in fact the drug \ntraffickers. Correspondingly, Rashid must have  placed items  in the accused\u2019s  \nvan on 14 March 2015 when they met for a karaoke session  at Ming Arcade, \nwhen Rashid had asked him for the keys to the van, and also on the morning of \n18 March just prior  to the arrest, when Rashid must have gained access to the \nvan to leave drugs there  since the accused would habitually have  left the rear \nsliding doors of the van  unlocked.\n34 On a related point,  the exercise  of prosecutorial discretion to amend the \ncharges against  Rashid and Nordiana  to reduced  non-capital charges was said \nto be \u201cwrong and unfair to the accused\u201d3.  In particular, the Defence highlighted \nthat the CNB  operation  had targeted  Rashid who was the known drug offender,  \nwhile the accused, who was not on the CNB\u2019s \u201cradar\u201d, was a victim of \ncircumstances4. The accused  was \u201cjust an unfortunate  scapegoat who was at the \nwrong place at the  wrong time\u201d5. \n35 The Defence further submitted that the Prosecution had not proved \nbeyond reasonable doubt that the accused  was in possession  of the drugs or that \nhe knew of the nature of the drugs that he was allegedly in possession of. It was \nsubmitted that the Prosecution would need  to rely on \u201cpresumption upon \npresumption upon presumption\u201d  in order to establish his guilt,  pointing to the \npresumptions in s 21 MDA  (relating to the drugs found in the van), s 18(2) MDA  \n(knowledge) and finally s 17 (possession for the purpose of trafficking)6.\n3 AWS at [12].\n4AWS at [32]\u2013[35].\n5AWS at [102].\n12\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Mohd Aziz bin Hussain [2018]  SGHC  19\n36 In putting  forth these submissions, the Defence contended that even \nthough the accused\u2019s seven statements  were found  to have  been given \nvoluntarily and admitted in evidence  after the ancillary hearing, a perusal of the \nstatements would suggest  that there were serious doubts about their \nvoluntariness. This was principally based on the argument  that his self-\nincrimination was \u201cillogical and irrational\u201d7 in that he had completely changed \nhis evidence from  what  he had stated in his contemporaneous statement,  namely \nthat the drugs did not belong to him but to Rashid. It was submitted  that \u201cno \nrational person would be willing to accept  such a position of changing  his \nstatements completely and accepting  the blame  for a capital amount  of drugs\u201d,  \nunless he had been subjected to external pressure of some  sort8.\nMy Decision\n37 The accused was charged  with having  the drugs in his possession for the \npurpose of trafficking, an offence under s 5(1)( a) read with s 5(2) of the MDA. \nThe two sub-sections  provide as follows:\nTrafficking in controlled drugs\n5.\u2014(1) Except as authorised by this Act, it shall be an offence \nfor a person, on his own behalf or on behalf of any other person, \nwhether or not that other  person is in Singapore \u2014\n(a) to traffic in a controlled drug;\n\u2026\n(2)  For the purposes of this Act, a person  commits the offence  \nof trafficking  in a controlled drug if he has in his possession \nthat drug for the purpose of trafficking.  \n6AWS at [39] and [46].\n7AWS at [73].\n8 AWS at [77].\n13\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Mohd Aziz bin Hussain [2018]  SGHC  19\n38 As provided  in s 2 of the MDA, the term \u201ctraffic\u201d means  \u201cto sell, give, \nadminister, transport, send, deliver or distribute\u201d,  or to offer to do any of these \nacts. Having examined  the totality of the evidence, and having reviewed the \ncontents of the statements which were admitted  after the ancillary hearing, I was \nsatisfied that the Prosecution had proved  the charge against the accused beyond  \na reasonable doubt. My  reasons for concluding thus are set out  below.\nRevisiting the accused\u2019s statements\n39 To recapitulate,  after conducting  the ancillary hearing, I found that the \nseven statements were given voluntarily  by the accused. The evidence before \nme clearly refuted the accused\u2019s  spurious  claims.\n40 The accused further maintained  that he was taught and forced by Rashid \nto tell the IO what came  to be recorded  in the seven  statements. I did not accept \nthat the accused had been  coached  or coerced by Rashid  before giving his \ndetailed statements to the IO, or that he was in fear of Rashid  who was allegedly \nhis \u201cOmega\u201d  secret society \u201cheadman\u201d who had pestered him to say what  he \nsaid at the Committal Hearing. None of these matters was suggested or put to \nRashid at any point during the trial. All this was in any event  irrelevant in \ndetermining the voluntariness of the seven  statements where  the focus was on \nthe conduct of the recorder of the statements,  being  the relevant \u201cperson in \nauthority\u201d contemplated in s 258(3) of the CPC. Whatever Rashid  may have  \ntaught the accused in the lockup, and irrespective of whether Rashid  had \ncoached him, these did not render the seven statements any less voluntary  \u2013 if \nat all, these  issues  might be relevant only in evaluating the weight of the \nstatements.\n14\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Mohd Aziz bin Hussain [2018]  SGHC  19\n41 In addition,  I was not convinced that Rashid was in such a domineering \nposition of influence  over the accused  that he was able to coach the accused to \nregurgitate a slew of details for the IO to record in his statements. On a related \nnote, it was highly unlikely that all the information the accused had given in the \nseven statements pertaining  to the drug activities had been  pure fiction crafted  \nby Rashid (and the IO), since he was able to relate a coherent, lucid and \ncomprehensive account of his involvement. It would be all the more unlikely \nthat he could  do in such detail  so if he had meekly followed Rashid\u2019s \ninstructions out of fear  as he claimed.\n42 Having  reviewed  the contents of the seven statements and having regard  \nto the totality of the evidence adduced at the conclusion of the hearing, I saw no \nreason why the statements should be impugned. As the Prosecution had rightly  \npointed out in the course of the closing oral submissions,  this was unlike the \nrather unusual  situation in Neo Ah Soi v Public Prosecutor [1996] 1 SLR(R) \n199, where  there was palpable doubt as to the manner in which  the statements \nin question  were recorded  and the statements were  therefore ultimately found to \nbe unreliable. In the present case,  there was inherently nothing discernible in \nthe form or substance of the seven  statements  at hand to cast doubt  as to their \naccuracy or reliability. I saw no logical difficulty in accepting that an accused \nperson who has initially denied committing any offence can subsequently come \nclean in respect of his involvement.  In any event, the accused\u2019s \ncontemporaneous statement (P122) which he gave voluntarily was not a \ncomplete denial of  his involvement.\n43 I was satisfied  after the ancillary hearing that the seven statements were \naccurately recorded  and properly admitted.  I therefore accorded due weight to \nthese statements.  Indeed,  even  if the evidence of Rashid  and Nordiana which \n15\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Mohd Aziz bin Hussain [2018]  SGHC  19\nincriminated the accused should be rejected, the accused\u2019s own statements \ncontained a host of material admissions which he  was unable to explain away. \nRashid and Nordiana\u2019s evidence\n44 Rashid testified that the accused  had contacted him on the morning of \n18 March 2015 saying that he wanted to talk to him about his (ie, the accused\u2019s) \n\u201cwife and his female friend problem\u201d9. After the accused entered the flat and sat \ndown in the living room,  Rashid  went  to use the toilet. On returning to the living  \nroom, Rashid  was shocked to find that the accused had laid out the drugs  on \nnewspaper on the floor.  The accused asked him to help pack  the drugs  which \nthe accused had to deliver. Although initially reluctant to do so, Rashid helped \nthe accused.\n45 Nordiana  was asleep when  the accused  arrived at the flat. She was also \nshocked and displeased to see the drugs but she helped him seal a few packets \nof the drugs. They cleared  up the remnants of the packing materials and helped \nthe accused  count the money he had brought up to the flat. Rashid  and Nordiana \nthen went  downstairs to buy food and also bought the accused some \u201croti prata\u201d. \nThe accused  declined  their offer of food and left the flat with all the items he \nhad brought  there.     \n46 Rashid and Nordiana admitted  to having  drug-related antecedents. They \nmight not have been perfectly consistent  or truthful in their testimonies as to \nwhether they themselves had engaged in drug trafficking activities prior to 18 \nMarch 2015, but their evidence  on the material aspects insofar  as the accused \nwas concerned was largely consistent and convincing. I found no reason for \n9 Notes of Evidence (\u201cNE\u201d) Day 7, at p 61, line 19.\n16\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Mohd Aziz bin Hussain [2018]  SGHC  19\nthem to falsely implicate him even if they did attempt to further downplay their \ninvolvement. They had already  pleaded guilty and had been sentenced. \n47 I also saw no merit in the accused\u2019s  attempts to capitalise  on the \ninconsistencies in their evidence.  Much was made  of the evidence relating  to \nthe various  bags, in whatever size, shape,  colour or material, in which the \nquantities of drugs were  found. As can be seen from the photographs, a number \nof bags in a variety of shapes and sizes were seized from  the van. While there \nwere certain  discrepancies in the evidence  relating  to the bags,  these were \nminor. They  did not detract from the overall tenor and consistency of the \nevidence which  pointed to the accused as the one who had been in possession \nof the bags (and the drugs found within) at  all material times.  \n48 In particular, I found no merit  in the accused\u2019s attempt to suggest that \nhe had not been  observed carrying a pink paper  bag (P28)  out of the flat. This \nwas readily explained by the fact that from where the CNB officers were \nobserving the flat, they could only see the upper body of the accused when he \nleft the flat, as their view  of his lower  body was blocked by the parapet. Rashid  \nhad also stated that the accused took everything with him when he left the flat, \nincluding a pink or red-coloured paper bag.\n49 As for the Defence\u2019s contention  relating to the purported wrongful \nexercise of prosecutorial discretion to amend the charges against Rashid  and \nNordiana, leaving the accused  solely to face a capital  charge, this was, with \nrespect, a speculative  and vague submission which lacked  foundation. The \nevidence before me revealed that the nature of each of the trio\u2019s respective \ninvolvements pertaining  to the drugs was different. As such, there  was no basis \nto suggest that there was any mala fides in how prosecutorial discretion was \nexercised to amend  their charges. The CNB operation  might have originally \n17\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Mohd Aziz bin Hussain [2018]  SGHC  19\ntargeted Rashid but the accused  ended up being  caught in the dragnet. I did not \nsee why this should  necessarily suggest that the accused was wholly innocent \nand had been wrongly implicated. \nPossession and  knowledge of  the nature of the drugs\nProof of actual possession and knowledge\n50 The evidence implicating the accused  was fairly straightforward. The \nevidence stemmed from  two main sources \u2013 first, his own inculpatory  \nstatements, and  second, the accounts of Rashid and Nordiana.  \n51 In his investigative statements,  the accused  admitted that he knew that \nthe items  were heroin and he had them  in his possession as he was acting under \nthe instructions of \u201cDatuk\u201d to repack  and deliver the drugs  to specified buyers \nand collect payments  on behalf of \u201cDatuk\u201d.  He admitted that the sum of money  \nwhich he had with him amounting to over $20,000 \u201cwas meant for \u2018Datuk\u2019 from \nthe sale of the drugs\u201d10. He understood  one \u201cbatu\u201d  to be one \u201cbig packet\u201d  or \n\u201cbundle\u201d of heroin11. He had repacked  six \u201cbatus\u201d  of heroin  thus far into small  \npackets and delivered them. He was supposed to earn about $400 for repacking \nand delivering one \u201cbatu\u201d of heroin 12.  \n52 I shall set out a few crucial aspects  that I had carefully  considered in \nevaluating the evidence. First, the accused  accepted at the outset that his \ncontemporaneous statement in P122 was accurate  and \u201call true\u201d13 but chose  to \nresile from  this position  within a matter of moments of attesting to the truth  and \n10 Accused\u2019s statement recorded on 30 March 2015 (P244) at [24]. \n11 Accused\u2019s statement recorded on 27 March 2015 (P241) at [2] and [3].\n12 Accused\u2019s statement recorded on 29 March 2015 (P243) at [17].\n13 NE Day  9, at p 24, lines 1 and 2.\n18\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Mohd Aziz bin Hussain [2018]  SGHC  19\naccuracy of the contents of the statement. It must have dawned on him that he \nhad to quickly backtrack upon  realising  that the remainder of his answers  in \nP122 (from Question 5 onwards) were still potentially incriminating. Hence,  he \nclaimed to have been unaware  or unsure of the answers he had given as he was \n\u201cmumbling\u201d and feeling \u201cdrowsy\u201d,  and by the time he responded  to Question  \n14, he claimed that he was \u201cnot conscious --- not aware\u201d14. These claims were  \nquite absurd and incredible. The recorder  of the contemporaneous statement, \nStaff Sergeant Muhammad Helmi  bin Abdul Jalal, underwent an almost  \nperfunctory cross-examination15. It was telling  that none of these claims were \nraised to him. In my assessment, the irresistible inference  was that the \nallegations were  pure  afterthoughts. \n53 Despite reversing his position with respect  to the remainder  of his \nanswers in P122, the accused  did not deny that in response to the recorder\u2019s very \nfirst question, \u201cWhat thing was in your van just now?\u201d, his spontaneous  \nresponse was \u201cheroin\u201d. Without reference to his other seven disputed  \nstatements, this cogently demonstrated, by his own undisputed admission, both \nhis possession and knowledge  of the nature  of the drugs  found in the van. \n54 The accused  came up with an explanation for this, which I rejected. He \nclaimed that he knew  that there  were  drugs in the pink paper bag as it actually \nbelonged to Rashid  and had been  placed in the van by Rashid.  After leaving the \nflat, he had driven off despite  his surprise at seeing the pink paper  bag \ncontaining drugs  in the van, and his fear upon seeing a female CNB officer \nobserving him. The accused responded  under  cross-examination that he drove \noff as he \u201ctried to get rid of the CNB  officer\u201d. He was \u201cin fear\u201d and \u201cscared\u201d \nthat the CNB had seen him and he did not know what to do16. Yet when  asked  \n14 NE Day  9, at p 25, lines 24\u201328; at  p 26, lines 1\u201327; at p 27, line 3.  \n15 NE Day  4, at pp 102\u2013104. \n19\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Mohd Aziz bin Hussain [2018]  SGHC  19\ndirectly whether he had driven off because  he knew  the drugs  belonged to him \nand he was trying to get away, he disagreed. Conveniently, he made no mention \nof the third bundle  of drugs (C1A1) which had  been left in the van.\n55 Another material aspect was the fact that the accused  was clearly unable \nto explain why, if he purportedly did not know that he was either  in possession \nof or transporting  the drugs, he would have  abandoned the van and tried to \nescape on foot. This was evidently the consequence of the accused  panicking \nand taking flight on seeing the CNB officers  closing in on him. He knew that \nthe game  was up. His state of reflexive panic  was entirely consistent with guilty  \nknowledge and could  only have  arisen from his abject  desperation  and fear of \nbeing apprehended with the drugs which he had repacked and was transporting.  \nSimply put, if he was genuinely innocent and wholly uninvolved  with the large  \nquantity of drugs in his van, there was logically  no reason for him to run, let \nalone to have  driven off \u201cin fear\u201d  in the first place in an effort to \u201cget rid of the \nCNB officer\u201d.\n56 Further,  I saw no basis whatsoever  to accept  the accused\u2019s suggestion  \nthat Rashid could have had access to his van through  the rear sliding doors \nwhich he claimed  to have habitually left unlocked, and that Rashid had \npurportedly asked to borrow the keys to the van during their karaoke  session at \nMing Arcade. I was also not persuaded by the submission that the accused had \nsomehow \u201clost  control\u201d  over the van for about two hours  prior  to his arrest. At \nno point were  any of these matters ever mentioned in any of his statements. \n57 Critically, what was raised  in this connection during  Rashid\u2019s cross-\nexamination was haphazard and piecemeal. It was put to Rashid that he had \nborrowed the keys to the van on 14 March  2015 and that he had put the red sling \n16 NE Day  9, at p 55, lines 25\u201331.\n20\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Mohd Aziz bin Hussain [2018]  SGHC  19\nbag (P44) in which the Ferrero  paper bag (P45) was found  inside the van. Rashid \ndenied these allegations. In any event, no drugs were found  within the red sling  \nbag (P44) or within  any of the items contained inside it. Next, it was put to \nRashid that he had brought the pink paper bag (P28)  down from the flat on the \nmorning of 18 March 2015 and as P28 was later found  in the van, he must have \nbeen the one who put it there, along with the red plastic bag (C1 \u2013 P42) which \ncontained the third  bundle of drugs (C1A1). Rashid again denied these \nallegations. The accused\u2019s allegation that the rear sliding  doors  of the van were \nleft unlocked  only emerged  at the trial. It was also not specifically put to Rashid  \nhow he managed to gain access to the van that morning  other than being  told \nthat the accused had allegedly informed  him that the rear sliding doors were not \nlocked. Once again, Rashid disagreed. \n58 These bare allegations about Rashid entering the van and nonchalantly \nleaving the drugs in the pink paper bag (P28) and the third bundle (C1A1) inside \nthe van, together  with the accused\u2019s  own purported loss of control over the van, \nwere all raised only at the eleventh hour. They clearly revealed the accused\u2019s \npropensity to embellish  his evidence.  I found that the accused\u2019s contentions \nwere afterthoughts which lacked credibility  and defied logic. It was highly \nimplausible that Rashid would have  wanted to leave  such a substantial quantity \nof drugs in an unlocked van without even  informing  the accused  that he had \ndone so,  and without specifying what he was  planning to  do with  them.  \n59 I saw nothing illogical  or unbelievable in the idea that the accused would \nhave brought  drugs up to the flat in order  to repack them. As the accused \nexplained in his statement recorded  on 28 March 2015 (P242)  at [10]\u2013[12], he \nwas getting tired of repacking the drugs in the van after doing so for over an \nhour that morning, and thus he decided to go to Rashid\u2019s flat to continue \nrepacking them. He had previously brought  money  there to count (at [13]).  He \n21\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Mohd Aziz bin Hussain [2018]  SGHC  19\nhad called Rashid on 18 March 2015 in the morning to ask if he could go to the \nflat, ostensibly  to talk about his \u201cgirlfriend problem\u201d  (at [14]) but blithely made \nno mention of the  drugs.\n60 In short, the accused was undoubtedly in physical  possession and \ncustody of the drugs at all material  times until his arrest.  The fact of his \npossession was corroborated  by the evidence of Rashid  and Nordiana, and \nconsistent with the observations  of the CNB officers who saw him leaving the \nflat and driving off in the van. \nPresumed possession: s  21 of the MDA\n61 Alternatively, the Prosecution submitted that the presumption  in s 21 of \nthe MDA was operative  and the accused was deemed  to be in possession  of the \ndrugs. This provision states as follows:\nPresumption relating to vehicle\n21. If any controlled  drug is found in any vehicle, it shall be \npresumed, until the contrary is proved,  to be in the possession \nof the owner of the vehicle and of the person  in charge  of the \nvehicle for the time being.\n62 I should state that in view  of my findings as outlined  above,  I did not see \nthe need for s 21 of the MDA to be invoked to presume that the accused  was in \npossession of the drugs which were all found  in the van. That said, from the \nevidence adduced, it was clear that the accused was in no position to rebut  the s \n21 presumption as he was plainly the \u201cperson  in charge\u201d of the van at all \nmaterial times and had not ceded control over it. Pertinently, he had never \ndisputed what he had said upon being questioned  immediately after his arrest. \nHe admitted  that he had heroin  in his possession in the van (see P122). His only \nclaim then in P122 was that the drugs actually belonged to Rashid  but this would \nnot amount to a rebuttal of the presumption in s 21 of the MDA,  which  relates \n22\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Mohd Aziz bin Hussain [2018]  SGHC  19\nto the attribution of possession to the person who is the owner  or the person in \ncharge of the vehicle  for the time being.\nPresumed knowledge of the nature of the  drugs: s  18(2) of  the MDA\n63 Further  and in the alternative,  the Prosecution sought  to rely on the \npresumption in s 18(2)  of the MDA to establish that the accused knew  the nature \nof the drugs contained  in the van (ie, diamorphine).  The relevant  portions  of s \n18 of the MDA state  as follows:\nPresumption of possession  and knowledge of controlled  \ndrugs\n18.\u2014(1)  Any person  who is proved  to have had in his \npossession or custody  or under his control \u2014\n(a) anything containing a controlled drug;\n\u2026\nshall, until the contrary is proved,  be presumed to have had \nthat drug in his possession.\n(2)  Any person who is proved  or presumed  to have had a \ncontrolled drug in his possession shall,  until the contrary is \nproved, be presumed to have known the nature of that drug.\n64 Section 18(2) of the MDA shifts the burden  onto the accused to prove \non a balance  of probabilities that he did not know or could not reasonably be \nexpected to have known the nature of the drugs in his  possession.\n65 The drugs were all found  packed in various forms in the van, and it was \nincontrovertible that in his contemporaneous statement the accused had \nadmitted to knowing that he had heroin  in his possession. Once again, I saw no \nnecessity for the Prosecution to invoke s 18(2) of the MDA  to presume that he \nknew the nature of the drugs in his possession. There was absolutely no basis to \nfind that the accused was able to rebut  the presumption of knowledge and show \nthat he did not know the  nature of the  drugs in his possession. \n23\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Mohd Aziz bin Hussain [2018]  SGHC  19\n66 For completeness,  I should address the Defence\u2019s submission that the \nProsecution needed  to rely on \u201cpresumption upon presumption upon \npresumption\u201d in order to establish  the guilt of the accused,  specifically the \npresumptions in s 21 (relating to the drugs found  in the van), s 18(2) (possession \nand knowledge) and finally s 17 of the MDA (possession  for the purpose of \ntrafficking). As the Prosecution had pointed out, there was no attempt to rely on \ntriple-layered presumptions but rather on two presumptions  at most.  The \nProsecution could rely on ss 21 and 18(2) of the MDA to presume possession \nand knowledge, and then prove that the possession was for the purpose  of \ntrafficking. Alternatively,  the Prosecution could  seek to prove possession and \nknowledge and then trigger  the presumption  in s 17 that he had the relevant \nquantity of drugs, which  had to be proved  to have  been in his possession, for the \npurpose of trafficking. \n67 The Prosecution\u2019s approach was consistent with the settled position in \nlaw having regard to the decision of the Court of"}

The brands behind these chains are under the ownership of two companies: NTUC Co-operative Ltd (\u201cNTUC\u201d) (which owns NTUC Fairprice and Cheers) and Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited (\u201cDairy Farm\u201d) (which owns Cold Storage, Giant, Shop N Save and 7-Eleven). Aside from these major retailers, the plaintiff also supplied the Products to other retailers such as Sheng Siong Supermarket Pte Ltd.', '13\\u2003Sometime in January 2013, Ramu and Abraham were in discussions relating to the entry into some form of business relationship. Pursuant to this, there was an inspection of the plaintiff\u2019s inventory in Singapore located inside a warehouse leased by the plaintiff called Ruby Warehouse Complex (\u201cRuby Warehouse\u201d). 4', '14\\u2003On 1 February 2013, the plaintiff and defendant entered into an oral agreement (\u201cthe Agreement\u201d). As highlighted, the precise nature of the Agreement is hotly contested. However, certain facts were not disputed:', '(a)\\u2003The Agreement included a handover of all the plaintiff\u2019s stock in Singapore to the defendant and the defendant would take over the plaintiff\u2019s accounts with retailers in Singapore and sell the Products to these retailers. The defendant would also take over the operation of Ruby Warehouse and agreed to pay rent for the use of Ruby Warehouse. 5', '(b)\\u2003The plaintiff and defendant agreed on a handover price to be paid by the defendant to the plaintiff. The original sum was set at $440,875.25. This was to be paid in 3 instalments, with the first instalment being $200,000. I shall refer to this as the \u201cInstalment Scheme\u201d. The defendant paid the plaintiff a sum of $200,000 on 1 February 2013. 6', 'It is not disputed that the number of instalments to be paid was subsequently varied to four instalments.', '(c)\\u2003The defendant initially agreed to purchase a van with the registration number GW6982Y, a lorry with the registration number YL7388B and a forklift truck with a model number FB25EX-5 (\u201cThree Vehicles\u201d). 7', 'However, the parties eventually could not agree on a price.', '(d)\\u2003On 6 February 2013, the parties completed a stock take of the inventory balance at Ruby Warehouse. 8', 'The stock take generated a \u201cstock handover list\u201d which was signed by Mahipal on behalf of the defendant. After the stock take, the total amount due under the Instalment Scheme was mutually varied to $420,621.24. The stock handover list included 1750 cartons of a product called Naughty G Sugar Free and 1750 cartons of a product called Naughty G Jasmine Green Tea that was given free of charge. 9', '(e)\\u2003 Sometime in February 2013, the defendant duly took over the operation of Ruby Warehouse.', '15\\u2003In order for the defendant to sell the Products directly to retail chains under the control of NTUC and Dairy Farm, the defendant would need to set up accounts with these retailers and transfer certain product identification codes called Stock Keeping Units (\u201cSKUs\u201d) from the plaintiff\u2019s account to the defendant\u2019s account. Each SKU would correspond to one particular product sold by the defendant or plaintiff to a retailer. Since it would take some time for the accounts to be set up and for the SKUs to be transferred, the plaintiff agreed to collect money from the retailers on behalf of the defendant in the interim. 10', 'In practice, the plaintiff would receive orders and collect payment from the retailers, and the defendant would operate Ruby Warehouse and deliver the Products to the retailers.', '16\\u2003Unfortunately, the parties\u2019 relationship deteriorated rapidly. By 1 April 2013, when the third instalment in the Instalment Scheme was due to be paid, the defendant refused to pay any money, on the basis that taking into account all the debts that were due on both sides, the plaintiff owed the defendant more money. 11', 'The plaintiff took the opposite position, and was of the view that it was the defendant that owed the plaintiff more money at the point. By this time the \u201ccontra arrangement\u201d (see [5] above) was in full force, and neither party would pay each other. This was due to a wide array of disputes, some of which I set out below for context:', '(a)\\u2003The defendant alleged that some of the stock it was sold was defective, either because they were unmerchantable or close to expiry.', '(b)\\u2003The parties could not agree on which party should bear the cost of certain rebates, allowances and promotional charges (\u201cPromotional Charges\u201d) that the retailers imposed. The retailers would either invoice a seller directly for the Promotional Charges, or deduct the charges from the sales collection they would pay out to the seller. Since the plaintiff was the party with the SKUs for the Products for the period of February to April 2013, it was the plaintiff that was invoiced by the retailers, and the sales collections collected by the plaintiff were also correspondingly reduced by the retailers.', '(c)\\u2003The parties also could not agree on whether the plaintiff should pay the defendant the sales collections collected on behalf of the defendant the moment the Products were sold to the retailers, or only after the plaintiff had collected money from the retailers.', '17\\u2003On 9 April 2013, plaintiff sent an email to the defendant titled \u201camended written agreement\u201d, which enclosed a draft written contract (\u201c9 April Draft\u201d). 12', 'However, the 9 April Draft was never signed. Nevertheless, the parties do not dispute that the 9 April Draft accurately reflects the terms of the Agreement, save for the terms disputed in a letter sent by the defendant\u2019s solicitors on 12 July 2013 (\u201cKalamohan Letter\u201d). 13', '18\\u2003The defendant did not pay rent for the use of Ruby Warehouse for similar reasons as its refusal to pay money under the Instalment Scheme (see [16] above). The plaintiff repeatedly requested for payment of rent and the settlement of outstanding sums, but the defendant refused.

The defendant denied the breaches but continued communicating with the plaintiff to arrange for the transfer of stocks from Ruby Warehouse to a warehouse leased by the defendant. 15', '20\\u2003While this was ongoing, the defendant managed to set up accounts with NTUC and Dairy Farm by mid-April 2013, and effected the transfer of the relevant SKUs by mid-May 2013. 16', '21\\u2003The plaintiff and defendant continued to correspond throughout May 2013, but they could not resolve their differences.

In SUM 3675\/2014, I gave summary judgment in favour of the plaintiff.', '25\\u2003About a month prior to the first day of trial, the plaintiff made an application for Abraham to give evidence by video-link from Australia, on the basis that Abraham was suffering from a medical condition that made it difficult for him to give evidence, namely, a phobia of heights. I rejected the application and instead directed that Abraham be examined by a doctor on the first day of trial itself to determine whether it was appropriate for him to give evidence on the stand in my court on the 4th floor. However, Abraham chose not to show up for trial. The plaintiff now urges the court to admit Abraham\u2019s affidavit of evidence-in-chief (\u201cAEIC\u201d) despite his absence at trial.

The matter was heard on 14 November 2017 by Foo Chee Hock JC. The judge found that the adjudication determination was made in breach of natural justice as it failed to take into account other essential issues of back charges for scaffolding and re-assessed variation works, and consequently set aside the adjudication determination.

The draft identifies \u201cSuper Coffee Corporation Pte Ltd\u201d as the transferee of 100% of the shares in Promfinaktiv. 40', '(d)\\u2003On 5 August 2009, 41', 'Mr Lee emails the defendant to point out to him that Promfinaktiv\u2019s corporate charter prohibits the transfer of shares to third parties. Mr Lee asks the defendant to have the charter amended immediately to facilitate the transfer of Promfinaktiv to the plaintiff\u2019s nominee.', '(e)\\u2003On 6 August 2009, 42', 'the defendant emails Mr Lee to inform him that the defendant has initiated the change in Promfinaktiv\u2019s charter. The defendant describes the process and conveys his expectation that the change can be effected within a matter of days.', '(f)\\u2003On 21 August 2009, 43', 'the defendant emails Mr Lee apologising for the delay in effecting the changes to Promfinaktiv\u2019s charter. He also informs Mr Lee that the \u201c[n]ext step and final step\u201d would be to submit the changes to the Russian tax authorities which he will do the following Monday.', '(g)\\u2003On 23 February 2010, 44', 'the defendant emails Mr Lee telling him that the changes to Promfinaktiv\u2019s charter have been effected, that the relevant documents are being notarised and legalised and that the defendant is \u201cready to conclude the [sale and purchase agreement] with [the plaintiff\u2019s] lawyers\u201d.', '(h)\\u2003On 27 April 2010, 45', 'Mr Lee emails the defendant a 2007 valuation of the Russian property and asks him for an updated estimate of its value. It appears that this email is a follow up to a telephone conversation between the plaintiff and the defendant on the same subject.', 'It ultimately emerged that the defendant did not have clear legal title to the Russian property. 46', 'As a result, the defendant never did transfer Promfinaktiv or the Russian property to the plaintiff.', '25\\u2003In November 2011, because the defendant had failed to perform both of his obligations under the April 2008 agreement, the plaintiff commenced action against MBIR to recover the sum of US$1.39m owing on the unpaid invoices. In April 2013, MBIR failed to comply with an unless order in that action. As a result, the plaintiff secured a judgment in default for the full sum against MBIR. MBIR has not paid the judgment debt or any part of it to date. 47', '26\\u2003In March 2015, the plaintiff commenced this action against the defendant to recover US$1.3m, or in the alternative damages for breach of the April 2008 agreement. 48', '27\\u2003In October 2015, MBIR was wound up by the court in proceedings unrelated to the subject-matter of this action. 49', 'In June 2016, MBIR was struck off the companies register. 50', '28\\u2003The plaintiff\u2019s case on its account of the facts is a straightforward action for breach of contract. It proceeds as follows. The defendant signed the April 2008 written agreement. He is therefore bound by it. He has failed to perform his obligations under it. He is therefore liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract.', '29\\u2003The plaintiff\u2019s principal difficulty is evidential: it is unable to prove by direct evidence that the defendant signed the April 2008 written agreement. I use the term \u201cdirect evidence\u201d here and throughout this judgment in the technical sense given to that term by s 62(1) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, Rev Ed 1997).', '30\\u2003The plaintiff finds itself in this evidential difficulty because it accepts that the parties did not execute the April 2008 written agreement on the same occasion and in each other\u2019s presence. In other words, even on the plaintiff\u2019s case, Mr Lee did not see the defendant sign the written agreement and therefore cannot give direct evidence of that fact. All that the plaintiff is able to say is that the defendant returned the written agreement to the plaintiff, duly signed by the defendant, before end April 2008. 51', 'The defendant, on the other hand, presents direct evidence \u2013 in the form of his own oral evidence \u2013 that he did not sign the document. Self-serving though his oral evidence might be, it is still direct evidence; its self-serving nature goes only to the weight to be attached to it.', '31\\u2003In the absence of direct evidence that the defendant signed the April 2008 written agreement, the plaintiff has to rely on circumstantial evidence to establish this fundamental fact. The plaintiff relies on three strands of circumstantial evidence.', '32\\u2003The first strand comprises the emails exchanged between the defendant and Mr Lee in 2008 (see [13] and [19] above). 52', 'The plaintiff relies on these emails as evidence that the parties had reached an oral agreement, the terms of which were then recorded in writing in the April 2008 written agreement. The plaintiff\u2019s point is that the preceding oral agreement makes it more likely that the defendant signed the April 2008 written agreement, because it does no more than record the terms of the parties\u2019 oral agreement reached on 2 April 2008.', '33\\u2003The second strand of circumstantial evidence comprises the emails exchanged between the defendant and Mr Lee in April 2009 (see [22] above). 53', 'The plaintiff\u2019s point is that if the defendant did not sign the April 2008 written agreement, he would have protested when the plaintiff called upon him to perform his obligations under the agreement a year later in April 2009. But he did not protest.', '34\\u2003The third strand of circumstantial evidence is the defendant\u2019s attempts, again without protest, to perform both of his obligations under the April 2008 agreement. Thus, the plaintiff submits that the five post-dated cheques totalling US$600,000 which the defendant issued in favour of the plaintiff in May 2008 (see [21] above) were issued in performance of the defendant\u2019s obligation under the April 2008 agreement to pay the plaintiff US$600,000 by way of post-dated cheques. Likewise, the defendant\u2019s efforts between April 2009 and April 2010 to transfer Promfinaktiv to the plaintiff \u2013 as evidenced by the emails exchanged during this period (see [23] above) \u2013 were efforts by the defendant to comply with his obligation under the April 2008 agreement to bring about a transfer of the Russian property to the plaintiff. 54', '35\\u2003To summarise the plaintiff\u2019s case on limitation, it is first necessary to describe how the limitation issue arises. The plaintiff\u2019s case is that it entered into an agreement in writing with the defendant in April 2008. The plaintiff commenced this action in March 2015, well over six years later. If the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action for breach of the April 2008 agreement arose at any time before March 2009, being six years before the plaintiff commenced this action, the plaintiff\u2019s action is time-barred by s 6(1)(a) of the Limitation Act.', '36\\u2003To meet this defence, the plaintiff relies on the email sent by the defendant to Mr Lee on 4 April 2009 (described at [22(b)] above) as an acknowledgment by the defendant of the plaintiff\u2019s claim in this action within the meaning of s 26(2) of the Limitation Act. The plaintiff\u2019s case, therefore, is that its right of action against the defendant is deemed by s 26(2) to have accrued on 4 April 2009 and not before. The plaintiff commenced this action within six years of 4 April 2009 and it is therefore not time-barred.', '37\\u2003The defendant\u2019s account of events at and following the February 2008 meeting amounts to little more than a denial of the plaintiff\u2019s account.', '38\\u2003The defendant denies that there was any discussion of MBIR\u2019s debt to the plaintiff at the February 2008 meeting. The topic of discussion at the meeting was not how MBIR was going to repay its debt to the plaintiff. The topic of discussion, instead, was the problems which MBIR was facing in receiving the goods from the plaintiff and MBIR\u2019s resulting set-offs and cross claims against the plaintiff. 55', '39\\u2003The defendant denies that he signed the April 2008 written agreement. His evidence is that his credit card bills suggest that he was in Moscow and not Singapore between 29 March 2008 and 13 April 2008. 56', 'He therefore challenges the authenticity of his signature on the April 2008 written agreement 57', 'and asserts that it \u201cis not [his] signature and was forged\u201d. 58', '40\\u2003The defendant denies that he had anything to gain by entering into an agreement \u2013 such as the April 2008 agreement \u2013 that would make him personally liable for the US$1.3m which MBIR owed to the plaintiff. 59', 'After all, he had only a half-share in MBIR and was not responsible for its debts. 60', 'His evidence is that it is not in his nature to undertake personal liability in that way and that US$1.3m is a large amount of money for him. 61', '41\\u2003The defendant denies that the five post-dated cheques which he issued in favour of the plaintiff totalling US$600,000 were an attempt to perform his obligation under the April 2008 agreement to pay US$600,000 to the plaintiff. 62', 'Instead, his evidence is that he issued these cheques to pay for coffee products which MBIR purchased from the plaintiff. 63', 'Further, although he accepts that he countermanded the cheques, his evidence is that he was justified in doing so, because the plaintiff failed to deliver the products. 64', '42\\u2003The defendant denies that the email correspondence about the transfer of Promfinaktiv to the plaintiff is evidence of the defendant\u2019s attempt to perform his obligations under the April 2008 agreement. Instead, the attempted transfer Promfinaktiv was in relation to a separate joint venture between the plaintiff and the defendant to package the plaintiff\u2019s products in Russia using packaging machines to be housed on the Russian property. 65', '43\\u2003The defendant denies the authenticity of 14 out of the 16 emails on which the plaintiff relies as evidence in this action and which I have summarised above (at [14]\u2013[16], [22] and [24]):', '(a)\\u2003The defendant formally disputes the authenticity of five of these emails: 66', 'those dated 5 March 2008 (see [15] above), 11 March 2008 (see [16] above), 4 April 2009 (see [22(a)] and [22(b)] above) and 9 April 2009 (see [22(c)] above). All of these emails were disclosed in the plaintiff\u2019s original list of documents filed on 7 September 2015.', '(b)\\u2003The defendant\u2019s evidence in chief disputes the authenticity of four additional emails: 67', 'those dated 3 April 2008 (see [19] above), 29 May 2009 (see [24(b)] above), 21 August 2009 (see [24(f)] above) and 23 February 2010 (see [24(g)] above). The defendant\u2019s position is that he had never seen any of these emails before this litigation and that he \u201cbelieves\u201d that he did not send them. 68', 'All of these emails were disclosed in the plaintiff\u2019s first supplementary list of documents filed on 22 April 2016.', '(c)\\u2003The defendant\u2019s reply written submissions, tendered after trial, reject the authenticity of a further five emails: 69', 'those dated 29 February 2008 (see [14] above), 11 April 2009 (see [22(d)] above), 31 July 2009 (see [24(c)] above), 6 August 2009 (see [24(e)] above) and 27 April 2010 (see [24(h)] above). All of these emails were disclosed in the plaintiff\u2019s second supplementary list of documents filed on 8 March 2017.', '44\\u2003There are only two emails on which the plaintiff relies and whose authenticity the defendant has not disputed: the emails dated 13 April 2009 (see [24(a)] above) and 5 August 2009 (see [24(d)] above). Both of these emails were also disclosed in the plaintiff\u2019s supplementary list of documents filed on 8 March 2017. However, the defendant\u2019s failure to challenge the authenticity of these two emails appears to result more from the defendant\u2019s oversight than from a considered decision to accept their authenticity. On the other hand, the defendant expressly accepts the authenticity of the draft undertaking attached to the email of 29 February 2008, even though he disputes the authenticity of the covering email itself.', '45\\u2003Because the defendant denies the authenticity of these emails, he also denies that they are capable of being evidence of anything at all. In particular, he denies the plaintiff\u2019s case that these emails are circumstantial evidence that he signed the April 2008 written agreement and that he attempted to perform his obligations under the agreement.', '46\\u2003Finally, the defendant denies that the plaintiff has brought its claim within the six-year limitation period applicable to claims for breach of contract 70', 'and, further, denies that he acknowledged his liability to the plaintiff within the meaning of s 26(2) of the Limitation Act.', '47\\u2003Based on his account of the facts, the defendant\u2019s case is as follows:', '(a)\\u2003His signature on the April 2008 written agreement is a forgery. 71', '(b)\\u2003The plaintiff\u2019s action is time-barred under the Limitation Act. 72', '48\\u2003I should point out at this stage that the defendant\u2019s pleading is deficient in two material respects.', '49\\u2003The first deficiency is that the defendant does not plead in terms that his signature on the April 2008 written agreement is a forgery. His pleaded defence is simply that he did not enter into the April 2008 agreement. 73', 'But he does assert expressly in his affidavit of evidence in chief that his signature on the April 2008 written agreement \u201cwas forged\u201d. 74', 'And both parties have prepared for trial on the basis that the defendant\u2019s case is that what purports to be his signature on the April 2008 written agreement is a forgery. The defendant\u2019s failure to plead forgery has caused no prejudice to the plaintiff. I therefore deal with the defendant\u2019s allegation of forgery on the merits rather than excluding it in limine on a technicality of pleading.', '50\\u2003The second deficiency is that the defendant does not plead in terms that the 4 April 2009 email is a fabrication. The plaintiff in its statement of claim anticipates a limitation defence and therefore specifically and pre-emptively pleads the 4 April 2009 email as an acknowledgment by the defendant of his liability to the plaintiff. 75', 'Despite this, the defendant does not in his defence specifically plead in response that this email is a fabrication. His plea in response amounts simply to a denial that he sent that email. 76', 'However, the 4 April 2009 email is one of the emails the authenticity of which the defendant formally disputed by his notice filed on 27 October 2015. Both parties prepared for trial on the basis that the 4 April 2009 email \u2013 and indeed all of the emails on which the plaintiff relies \u2013 are fabrications. Once again, therefore, I deal with the defendant\u2019s allegations of fabricated emails on the merits, rather than excluding it in limine on a technicality of pleading.'"}

It is not in dispute that the entire design and construction obligation, and therefore responsibility and liability, rested on Dragages to design and erect a building that would suit Millenia\u2019s requirements and purpose. The design life of the Building was 50 years. 12', '15\\u2003From a plan view, the Building is an oval-shaped building, much like a generously shaped oval conference table, with truncated straight ends, except that the middle and sides contained indented portions for aesthetic reasons (see the diagram at [357] below).', '16\\u2003The Fa\u00e7ade was clad with a total of approximately 16,277 granite stone panels. 13', 'A typical panel measured 1.6m (in height), 1m (in width) and 30mm (in thickness), and weighed over 100kg (the largest panels weighed around 140kg). 14', 'By an agreement dated 11 September 1996, Dragages entered into a domestic subcontract with Builders Shop (\u201cthe Sub-contract\u201d) to supply brackets and fittings and to install the granite stone panels on the Fa\u00e7ade for the sum of S$1,270,000 (\u201cthe Sub-contract Works\u201d). 15', '17\\u2003The Cladding can be divided into what was referred to as \u201cdrops\u201d. The concept of a drop is based on the operation of the rail-mounted gondola roof hoist or davit, to which a cradle (\u201cthe BMU\u201d) was attached. The BMU could be positioned at one particular point of the roof and then descend (or ascend) along a vertical column of the Cladding containing granite panels. 16', 'A vertical column of panels was referred to as a \u201cdrop\u201d. 17', '18\\u2003In these proceedings, the parties generally adopted a numbering system used by Arup which divided the Cladding into 80 drops. Each drop covered 34 levels, and had two rows of four panels per level, except for column drops which had one row of four panels per level. 18', 'Drop 1 started to the right of the Fa\u00e7ade above the entrance. The numbering then moved anti-clockwise around the building until Drop 80, which was to the left of Drop 1 as one looked at the Building from the entrance (see the diagram at [357] below).', '19\\u2003I note that Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade claims it used a different numbering system of \u201cdrops\u201d in its inspection of the Cladding in 2007. This is relevant to the issue of whether Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade inspected the whole of the Cladding (excluding eight of the 80 drops) in 2007. I address this at [97]\u2013[101] below.', '20\\u2003Three main types of bracket systems \u2013 types A, B and C brackets \u2013 were used on the Cladding. 19', '(There were further variants of each type: types A1 and A2, B1\u2013B8 and C1 and C2.) The standard bracket used was a Type B bracket, which was a U-shaped bracket with one side of the \u2018u\u2019 being longer than the other. The following diagram shows the design of a Type B bracket: 20', '21\\u2003For this bracket system, panels were generally installed as follows. 21', '(a)\\u2003One end, the longer end, of the bracket was attached to the reinforced concrete wall (\u201cthe RC wall\u201d) of the Building with an anchor bolt, nut and a spring washer. The longer end had a vertical slot cut into it to accommodate site adjustment in the vertical plane. The spring washer prevented the bracket from moving downwards. 22', '(b)\\u2003A shaft was inserted through the other, shorter end of the bracket, and secured by a conical bolt and nut which were restrained by washers. 23', 'This end of the bracket had a horizontal slot to accommodate site adjustment along the horizontal plane.', '(c)\\u2003The installation or fixing of the stone panels was generally as follows. A panel would be rested on the shafts of two brackets along its lower edge. It would be secured against lateral movement by a pin through each shaft which protruded into two pre-drilled holes along the lower edge of the panel. This lower panel was put into position and aligned with the shafts along its upper edge. When this was accomplished, a pin was then dropped through each of the holes of those two shafts into pre-drilled holes along the top edge of the panel, thereby securing the top of that panel against lateral movement. The pre-drilled holes along the top edge of the panel contained PVC sleeves to hold the pins more snugly, cutting down excess lateral movement. (By contrast, the holes along the bottom edge of the panel above did not contain PVC sleeves but contained epoxy glue. 24', ') After being dropped into the top edge of the panel, the 70mm pins would protrude through the hole in the shaft, thereby providing the anchor points for the next panel to be installed above it. The panel above would then be lowered into position and placed onto the protruding pins on the shafts along its lower edge, and the process would be repeated.', '22\\u2003A thermal insulation layer (not shown in the diagram above) was installed on the outer face of the RC wall before the Cladding was installed. 25', 'There was thus an insulation layer between the RC wall and the panels.', '23\\u2003Each panel was subject to forces owing to dead load and wind load. 26', 'Dead load refers to the load due to the weight of the panel. Wind load refers to the load due to wind impact and changes in air pressure. The bracket system transferred the dead loads and wind loads of the panels back to the RC wall. 27', '24\\u2003In general, each panel was to be supported by two brackets and restrained by four pins on opposite edges of the panel. 28', 'Where a Type B bracket was used, the pins were at the top and bottom edges of the panel. Where a Type A or C bracket was used, the pins were inserted into the sides of panels. 29', 'This \u201cside fixed system\u201d was used for panels near windows, where it was not easy to fix top pins because the window frames would impede the insertion of top pins. 30', '25\\u2003Most of the pins were \u201cfull pins\u201d, 70mm long and 6mm in diameter, and inserted into 40mm deep pin holes. 31', 'But there were also half pins which were 40mm long and inserted into a single panel, unlike full pins which spanned two panels. 32', '26\\u2003The design specifications provided for movement joints, ie, empty space between the panels, of 10mm inclusive of a 4mm shaft (at installation). 33', 'Thus, the gap between the bottom of the shaft and the panel below was to be 6mm (at installation). Movement joints ensured that the panels were not excessively restrained and could expand and contract without loss of structural integrity. They also prevented panels from weighing on and transferring their loads onto the panels below (\u201cstacking\u201d).', '27\\u2003I now set out the key events surrounding this dispute. Insofar as these facts are disputed, the following paragraphs constitute my findings of fact.', '28\\u2003Dragages began the works under the Contract (\u201cthe Works\u201d) in January 1996. 34', '29\\u2003On 19 September 1997, Millenia, Dragages and Builders Shop executed a deed of warranty (\u201cthe Deed\u201d). 35', 'In brief, the Deed provided as follows:', '(a)\\u2003By cll 1\u20133, Dragages and Builders Shop provided warranties to Millenia for the Works and Sub-Contract Works (see [407] below).

Under cl 8, if Dragages and\/or Builders Shop failed to perform their duties under cl 6, Millenia would be entitled to remedy the defects and Dragages and Builders Shop would be obliged to indemnify Millenia for the expenses it incurred in making good the defects.', '30\\u2003 Millenia subsequently issued the Written Statement certifying that on 27 September 1997, with the exception of items listed in appendices, the Works had been completed. 36', 'This was the date of practical completion. In due course, tenants moved into and occupied the Building.', '31\\u2003On 10 September 2004 at 4.35pm, the 1st Panel suddenly fell from the 29th storey of the Building. 37', 'The panel was identified as panel 26 on drop 21. 38', 'It was one of four panels between the 29th and 30th storey (the panels were numbered from the top). In the course of falling down, the 1st Panel damaged panels 28 and 29 on drop 21. The 1st Panel landed near a bus stop. 39', 'Fortunately, there was no one in the vicinity and thus no one was injured.', '32\\u2003By a letter to Millenia dated 13 September 2004, the Building and Construction Authority (\u201cthe BCA\u201d) stated that \u201cthe conditions of the building are likely to be dangerous\u201d. The BCA ordered Millenia to engage a professional engineer (\u201cPE\u201d) to prepare an investigation report, to be submitted within four weeks, on the cause of the 1st Fall. The report was to include \u201ca detailed assessment of the conditions of the remaining cladding\u201d. Millenia was also to submit a proposal for rectification works as recommended by the PE within six weeks. I will refer to this order from the BCA as \u201cthe 1st BCA Order\u201d. 40', '33\\u2003Millenia appointed Arup as its PE by a letter dated 27 September 2004 (the \u201c2004 Appointment Letter\u201d), 41', 'which enclosed Arup\u2019s proposal to Millenia (the \u201c2004 Proposal\u201d) and a letter of undertaking by Arup (the \u201c2004 Letter of Undertaking\u201d). These three documents formed the contract between Millenia and Arup (the \u201c2004 Contract\u201d). In gist, under the 2004 Contract, Arup agreed to investigate the 1st Fall and the integrity of the Cladding, and to then produce two reports: an interim report to meet the BCA\u2019s requirements (see [32] above) and a final report containing inspection results, Arup\u2019s assessment of the Fa\u00e7ade and advice on remedial works and future action (see [583(b)] below). Arup contracted to perform these services for a fixed fee of $101,000. 42', '34\\u2003To fully appreciate the disputes between the parties, it is important to bear in mind certain actions taken by Dragages after the 1st Fall. One person played a leading role in the events that were to unfold: Ms Audrey Perez (\u201cMs Perez\u201d), the Head of Department, Corporate Quality, Safety, Environment and Maintenance of Dragages. 43', 'Ms Perez was in charge of, among other things, managing Dragages\u2019 legal exposure to claims. 44', 'Significantly, she admitted that in the immediate aftermath of the 1st Fall, the prospect of Dragages\u2019 liability to Millenia crossed her mind, and it also crossed her mind that she should protect Dragages\u2019 legal interests, because that was part of her job. 45', '35\\u2003I digress from the narrative to say more about Ms Perez. Her hand is seen in much of what was to follow after the 1st Fall. She was the sole witness of fact called by Dragages \u2013 notwithstanding that others, in particular Mr Cillius Adrianto (\u201cMr Adrianto\u201d), were involved in the events that I recount below, and were still employed by Dragages at the time of the trial. 46', 'I found Ms Perez to be an intelligent person with powerful powers of persuasion. As will become clear, she wielded a not insignificant influence over Builders Shop and Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade; Ms Perez testified that she had \u201cvery good relation[s] with [her] consultant, contractor and any business partners\u201d. 47', 'I note the following in relation to Ms Perez\u2019s influence over Builders Shop and Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade:', '(a)\\u2003In relation to Builders Shop, Mr Tan Kay Sing (\u201cMr Tan\u201d), the managing director of Builders Shop until April 2009, 48', 'and the project director for the Sub-contract Works, 49', 'testified that after receiving a letter from Millenia dated 26 October 2004, he left the matter of Millenia\u2019s claims against Builders Shop in the hands of Ms Perez. 50', 'After Millenia sued Dragages and Builders Shop (see [61] below), he also left it to Dragages to (1) decide how to respond to the suit on the basis that Builders Shop would follow Dragages\u2019 position and (2) subsequently, to negotiate the Settlement Agreement with Millenia on Builders Shop\u2019s behalf. 51', 'Finally, Mr Tan left the implementation of the Settlement Agreement to Ms Perez in the sense that he complied with her instructions. 52', 'Dragages did not challenge Mr Tan\u2019s evidence and I accept it accordingly.', '(b)\\u2003In relation to Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade, Ms Perez became friends, sometime after 2005, with Mr Mathieu Serge Meur (\u201cMr Meur\u201d), the managing director of Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade (see [59] and [133] below). According to her, in a discussion about the Building, Mr Meur promised to \u201chelp her [till] the end\u201d and that \u201che would not let [her] down\u201d. 53', '36\\u2003The evidence shows that Ms Perez was willing to mould the truth to protect Dragages\u2019 legal interests. I will give but two examples:', '(a)\\u2003In a letter to Millenia dated 28 September 2004 (see [44(a)] below), Ms Perez stated that Maxbond, an adhesive, had been applied to the Fa\u00e7ade \u201cunder the supervision of our PE\u201d [emphasis added]. She admitted at trial that the PE was not in attendance when Maxbond was applied to the Fa\u00e7ade; nor did he even know where it had been applied. 54', '(b)\\u2003In a letter to Millenia dated 16 November 2004, Ms Perez stated that there was \u201cno basis for claiming that [infill panels] were installed in a manner which were in breach of our obligations\u201d. Infill panels were panels that were installed out of the usual sequence because they were located at a point of tie back for the hoist used to install the panels. Both the 1st and the 2nd Panels were infill panels. Ms Perez also stated in this letter that the use of epoxy to install infill panels was \u201cpart of the method of installing replacement panels\u201d. 55', 'Yet she admitted that she knew, as of the date of this letter, that (1) the 1st Panel had not been installed in accordance with the design and specifications and (2) epoxy did not form part of the method of installing replacement panels. 56', 'I therefore find that these two statements made by Ms Perez in this letter were false.', '37\\u2003I now turn to my assessment of Ms Perez as a witness. I note that English was not her first language: 57', 'Ms Perez was French, 58', 'as was Mr Meur. However, Mr Singh tendered three articles which Ms Perez had written on various aspects of construction law which demonstrated her impressive command of the English language. 59', 'Ms Perez also agreed that she had obtained a graduate certificate in international arbitration from the National University of Singapore, in 2007, 60', 'and took a module on contract, tort and evidence. 61', 'It was thus evident that Ms Perez had a strong command of English and various aspects of the law.', '38\\u2003In this light, I found some of Ms Perez\u2019s answers, to say the least, difficult to understand. I will give just two out of many examples:', '(a)\\u2003First, in an email to Millenia dated 12 February 2009, Ms Perez stated that \u201cMeinhardt ha[s] the full liability for the repair works\u201d (see [121(b)] below). When cross-examined by Mr Jeyaretnam on why she had stated this, Ms Perez said that \u201cliability\u201d was \u201cmaybe \u2026 not the correct word \u2026 an overstatement, knowing better now what \u2018liability\u2019 means\u201d [emphasis added]. 62', 'The suggestion was that she did not know at the time of the email what liability meant. Yet by the time of this email in 2009, Ms Perez had obtained her graduate certificate in international arbitration (see [37] above). She must have known what liability meant. Upon cross-examination by Mr Singh, she admitted this. 63', 'Mr Singh suggested, and I accept, that Ms Perez was seeking to reassure Millenia about the rectification works performed under the Settlement Agreement (\u201cthe Rectification Works\u201d) by alluding to the potential liability of Meinhardt (Fa\u00e7ade) to Millenia. 64', 'Notably, Ms Perez admitted that this email was not copied to Mr Meur or Mr Ong Ching Pau (\u201cMr Ong\u201d) of Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade and they would not have been aware of this email. 65', '(b)\\u2003Secondly, when cross-examined about her statement in her letter dated 28 September 2004 that Maxbond was applied to the Fa\u00e7ade under the supervision of Dragages\u2019 PE (see [36(a)] above), Ms Perez maintained that the statement was true. She claimed there had been \u201csupervision\u201d because the engineer opined on the appropriateness of applying Maxbond to the Fa\u00e7ade. 66', 'Ms Perez was frequently evasive in her answers and I had to intervene in cross-examination on several occasions to get her answers to the questions on record. 67', 'Altogether, I did not find her to be a credible witness. I was therefore unable to accept her evidence on most points.', '39\\u2003I now return to the narrative. On 10 September 2004, after the 1st Fall, Dragages contacted Mr Lauw Su Wee (\u201cMr Lauw\u201d) and asked him to inspect the Fa\u00e7ade and prepare a report. Mr Lauw was a PE engaged by Dragages who had engineered, verified and certified the bracketing system for the Cladding. 68', 'It is evident, therefore, that he was not an entirely independent expert. Ms Perez admitted that at the time of the trial, Dragages was continuing to work with Mr Lauw. However, Dragages did not call Mr Lauw as a witness. Nor did it produce correspondence between itself and Mr Lauw in September 2004, although Millenia requested for discovery of such documents. 69', '40\\u2003On 11 September 2004, Mr Lauw inspected the elevation from which the 1st Panel had fallen during the afternoon. He then prepared a report issued on 27 September 2004 (\u201cMr Lauw\u2019s Report\u201d), 70', 'where he stated the following:', '(a)\\u2003First, he noted that the 1st Panel had not been restrained with top pins. Instead, epoxy was used to bond it to the panel above it. This was \u201can alternative method of securing such panels by stone cladding installers in Singapore\u201d. The 1st Fall \u201cwas not caused by the deficiency in design or installation of the mechanical supporting system\u201d.', '(b)\\u2003Secondly, Mr Lauw stated that the method of installation used for the 1st Panel was also used for other panels that were installed out of sequence, ie, for other \u201cinfill panels\u201d (see [36(b)] above).', '(c)\\u2003Thirdly, he noted four possible causes of the 1st Fall: prolonged exposure to weathering and turbulence caused by wind, impacts from gondolas used to clean walls and the Fa\u00e7ade, vibrations from tremors from Sumatra and vibrations from nearby construction activities. Hence, according to Mr Lauw, the cause of the 1st Fall was an external factor or a combination of external factors. There was no suggestion that the 1st Fall was caused by defective workmanship.', '41\\u2003More specifically, Mr Lauw\u2019s Report did not suggest that the primary cause of the 1st Fall was the use of epoxy rather than pins to restrain the 1st Panel. The report did not suggest there was anything inappropriate about this \u201calternative method of securing [stone] panels\u201d (see [40(a)] above). Mr Stuart Clarke of Arup (\u201cMr Clarke\u201d) opined that as a PE, Mr Lauw should have come to the same conclusion as Arup: the main cause of the 1st Fall was the use of epoxy, instead of pins, to restrain the 1st Panel (see [47(b)] below). The parties do not dispute this in these proceedings (see [48] below). Mr Clarke\u2019s evidence, which I accept, was that Mr Lauw\u2019s Report was \u201cdrafted from the perspective of laying blame elsewhere\u201d. 71', 'Notably, Ms Perez stated that she had discussions with Mr Lauw after he inspected the Fa\u00e7ade and before he produced his report. 72', 'It is evident why Dragages did not call Mr Lauw even though it put his report into the evidence. His report was indefensible on almost all counts.', '42\\u2003On 12 September 2004, Dragages agreed to carry out an inspection of the Fa\u00e7ade, which began on that date and concluded on 22 September 2004. 73', 'Dragages engaged Mr David Rodrigues (\u201cMr Rodrigues\u201d), a \u201cspecialist granite installer\u201d, who reported directly to Ms Perez, to perform the inspection. 74', 'Ms Perez instructed Mr Rodrigues to apply Maxbond (see [36(a)] above) to \u201cany stone or anything in the granite fixing that [looked] suspicious or that [required] further investigation\u201d. 75', 'Ms Perez asserted during cross-examination that the purpose of the inspection was not to identify defects in the Cladding, but to ensure the Fa\u00e7ade would be safe in the short term to allow a thorough investigation of the Cladding to be performed. 76', 'She therefore instructed Mr Rodrigues to apply Maxbond as a temporary fixing.', '43\\u2003The application of Maxbond to the Cladding is a point of controversy. Millenia claims it did not know of or agree to the application of Maxbond, and that Dragages applied Maxbond to cover up defects in the Cladding. 77', 'Dragages denies this, alleging that Millenia agreed to the use of Maxbond, and that it was applied for the sole purpose of ensuring the safety of the Fa\u00e7ade. 78', 'I have my suspicions about the application of Maxbond in view of the following points:', '(a)\\u2003First, I find that Maxbond had the effect of hampering the identification of defects in the Cladding.', '(b)\\u2003Secondly, I do not accept Ms Perez\u2019s account of the purpose of the inspection (see [42] above). I find, based on the minutes of a meeting on 16 September 2004, that Millenia had requested, and Dragages had agreed to, an inspection that would identify defects in the Cladding. 79', '(c)\\u2003Thirdly, Mr Rodrigues did not take any notes or photographs during his inspection of the Cladding. 80', 'I find this strange. A panel had fallen off the Building. Mr Rodrigues was applying Maxbond to panels he considered presented a safety risk. In the circumstances, it would have been logical to note down, at least, the panels to which Maxbond was applied. Ms Perez could not satisfactorily explain why this was not done. She initially said that Mr Rodrigues had no time to take notes: he was required to inspect the 80 drops within a very short time. 81', 'Mr Singh then brought Ms Perez to her letter to Millenia dated 28 September 2004, where she gave a different explanation why Dragages did not have records of panels to which Maxbond was applied, viz, Millenia had not asked for such records. 82', 'Ms Perez could not explain this discrepancy.', 'These points clearly raise questions about why Maxbond was applied to the Fa\u00e7ade. If I had to make a finding, I would find that Dragages applied Maxbond to make it very difficult to identify defects in the Cladding without first removing the Maxbond.', '44\\u2003I note further that Ms Perez did not tell the whole truth, in two respects, in her letter to Millenia dated 28 September 2004:', '(a)\\u2003Ms Perez stated in this letter that Maxbond was applied \u201cunder the supervision of our PE\u201d. This was untrue (see [36(a)] above).', '(b)\\u2003Ms Perez also stated that Dragages found all of the stone panels on the Fa\u00e7ade to be \u201cfirmly secured without risk of dislodging\u201d. 83', 'This statement gives the impression that Dragages did not find any panels that were at risk of falling, whereas the truth was that there were some panels that presented a safety risk thus necessitating the application of Maxbond. I brought this to Ms Perez\u2019s attention during the trial. She admitted that she understood the difference between what she conveyed and what Dragages in fact discovered in the inspection of the Fa\u00e7ade. 84', '45\\u2003The picture which emerges is this, and I so find. In September 2004, after inspecting the Fa\u00e7ade, Dragages was less than candid with Millenia about the state of the Cladding. Dragages took this approach out of concern of its potential liability to Millenia. As I have noted, Ms Perez agreed that she had Dragages\u2019 potential liability to Millenia in mind after the 1st Fall occurred (see [34] above).', '46\\u2003In 2004, Arup issued two reports on the Cladding (the \u201c1st 2004 Report\u201d and the \u201c2nd 2004 Report\u201d respectively and the \u201c2004 Reports\u201d collectively).', '47\\u2003On 28 October 2004, Arup issued the 1st 2004 Report. 85', 'Arup made the following observations regarding the 1st Panel and the 1st Fall:', '(a)\\u2003The 1st Panel was an infill panel (see [36(b)] above).', '(b)\\u2003Critically, the 1st Panel did not have pins fixed into its top edge. From inspection, it appeared that the 1st Panel was placed on the lower brackets with pins used to provide the lateral support but the top pins, which were crucial to restrain the panel from rotating or moving forwards and falling off, were not installed. Instead, a half pin had been welded to the shaft and used to restrain the panel above, while epoxy resin was used to bond the top of the 1st Panel to the brackets supporting the panel above. This method of restraining the panel was, according to Arup, \u201cwholly inappropriate\u201d. 86', 'The epoxy had come cleanly away from the top edge of the 1st Panel. This could have been due to:', 'Of these factors, the most likely cause of the failure of the epoxy was factor (i). 88', 'Nonetheless, according to Arup, regardless of what was \u201cthe deciding or catalytic factor\u201d, the 1st Fall would not have occurred if the panel had been properly installed and\/or restrained.', '(c)\\u2003Arup also observed that the lower bracket pins of the 1st Panel were \u201cbent outwards due to a prying action of a rotating panel about its bottom edge\u201d. 89', 'Arup noted that once the bond between the epoxy and the stone had failed, the 1st Panel would have been in a state of unstable equilibrium and could have rotated inwards or outwards. Arup concluded that the lower pins had been bent outwards as the 1st Panel rotated outwards before falling from the Cladding.', '48\\u2003The parties do not dispute the conclusions in Arup\u2019s 1st 2004 Report, ie, that the critical reason why the 1st Panel fell was that it was not installed with two top pins. 90', 'According to Mr Peter Lalas (\u201cMr Lalas\u201d), Dragages\u2019 fa\u00e7ade expert, the method used to install the 1st Panel was \u201coutrageous and not acceptable\u201d. 91', 'I could not agree more.', '49\\u2003The key recommendation proposed in Arup\u2019s 1st 2004 Report was the rectification of all the infill panels. The basis of this recommendation was the hypothesis that all infill panels had been installed without their top pins like the 1st Panel. Arup arrived at this hypothesis in the following way. Arup noted that the \u201cas built details and calculations provided that the design was signed off without the provision of details for [infill] panels to be installed.\u201d 92', 'In other words, Arup could not find, within the documentation provided, any strategy or method statement for dealing with infill panels. Arup then observed that based on the documentation it had reviewed, it would not have been possible to install infill panels with top pins. This was because when an infill panel was installed, the panel and bracket above the panel would already have been installed. It would thus have been impossible to drop a pin into the top of the infill panel, in accordance with the usual method of installing panels (see [21(c)] above).', '50\\u2003I pause here to note that Dragages challenges Arup\u2019s hypothesis that all infill panels were installed without top pins. According to Dragages, apart from the 1st Panel, infill panels were installed with top pins using a \u201cdrop-pin\u201d method. 93', 'This involved inserting full pins into the lower pin holes of the panel above the infill panel, which had been specially drilled twice as deep as was typical to accommodate the insertion of the full pins within the pin holes. The full pins were then held within the specially drilled deeper pin holes with masking tape. Once the infill panel was set in position, the masking tape was removed and the pins would drop into the top pin holes of the infill panel. Having considered the evidence, I accept Dragages\u2019 submission. The key reason is that no other panel was found installed without top pins over the course of several inspections of the Cladding. I elaborate on this at [388] below. The hypothesis advanced in Arup\u2019s 1st 2004 Report was thus incorrect. However, Arup could hardly be blamed for this for two reasons. First, the 1st Panel was not secured by two top pins as required by the design and, as noted above, Arup had not found documentation, drawings or method statements for the securing of infill panels. Secondly, the theory that infill panels were installed without top pins was advanced in Mr Lauw\u2019s Report, ie, the report by the PE who had engineered, verified and certified the brackets (see [39] above), which was issued on 27 September 2004, ie, before Arup\u2019s 1st 2004 Report (see [40(b)] above). I note that during the trial, I was not shown any documentation, drawings or method statements issued during the construction of the Building dealing with infill panels or Dragages\u2019 \u201cdrop-pin\u201d method.', '51\\u2003Apart from its observations in relation to the 1st Panel and infill panels, Arup also made the following points regarding the Cladding: 94', '(a)\\u2003Arup noted that the joint widths between stone panels varied tremendously throughout the Fa\u00e7ade. Arup was concerned that this was a sign that the spring washers that were supposed to provide friction between the brackets and the RC wall were not serving their intended purpose, thus allowing brackets to slide downwards (see [21(a)] above).', '(b)\\u2003Arup recorded its observations of deviations from the design of the Building. These included the use of galvanised or standard mild steel washers instead of stainless steel washers, brackets being installed at 90 or 180 degrees to their intended orientation, foreign objects in joints, the spalling of panels, hairline cracks and the loosening of shafts.', '(c)\\u2003Arup noted that repairs had been performed to some panels, by attaching the corners of some panels with epoxy to other panels. Arup assumed that this had been brought to the attention of Millenia\u2019s consultants and that the repairs were approved. However, Arup had not seen any evidence to confirm this.', '(d)\\u2003Arup observed that hard metal spacers installed between panels had transmitted (dead) load from some panels to other panels, causing the stone of the latter panels to fracture and spall. The spalling was \u201ca serious issue when located at the position of the pins\u201d, because it reduced the capacity of the stone to withstand the necessary applied loads. Further, there were instances where the inside surface of the panel had spalled or had been chipped at the position of the pin. Arup noted that this was a serious issue because if the stone behind the pin was not intact, the panel would not be able to withstand suction loads adequately. If, therefore, a lateral force acted on the panel outwards from the Building, the affected pin or pins may not have been able to restrain the panel from falling off the Fa\u00e7ade. If only one top pin was so affected, then there would only be one top pin providing that important restraint.', '(e)\\u2003Arup also noted the following:', '(f)\\u2003Arup also noted that many brackets they observed relied on \u201cpost-drilled anchors\u201d rather than \u201ccast-in anchors\u201d. In other words, holes had been drilled into the RC wall on site to accommodate the anchor bolts. Arup hypothesised that the expected tolerance of the cast-in sockets for fixing the anchor bolts had not been achieved. Holes had therefore been drilled into the RC wall for the anchor bolts. 95', '(g)\\u2003Arup noted that the design of the bracketing system was in general \u201cwell above average\u201d and \u201csophisticated\u201d. 96', '52\\u2003Arup\u2019s 1st 2004 Report also mentioned vibration readings taken by the Land Transport Authority (\u201cthe LTA\u201d) from instruments placed in the Building. As I have noted, the Circle Line Works to Promenade Station were in progress at the time of the 1st Fall (see [47(b)(iii)] above). Arup stated that further analysis would have to be done once further data from the LTA was provided. Arup also noted anecdotal reports from building occupants that they could feel vibrations from the adjacent excavation works.', '53\\u2003Arup\u2019s 1st 2004 Report was sent to Dragages. In her letter to Millenia dated 16 November 2004, Ms Perez made the two statements noted above which I have found were false (see [36(b)] above).', '54\\u2003On 28 December 2004, Arup issued its 2nd 2004 Report. The report was based on eight drops which it inspected, 97', 'viz, drops 17, 21, 38, 46, 57, 61, 78 and 80 (\u201cthe 8 Drops\u201d). 98', 'Arup stated that \u201cthe installed stone cladding system is of a high quality in terms of materials and design\u201d; however, the onsite implementation of the system was not in complete agreement with the design. 99', 'The issues arising from the deviation from the design ranged in severity from insignificant to critical and there were a range of rectification procedures that Arup recommended. Arup listed 17 items for rectification of differing severity (16 of these items were \u201cnoted deviations from the design condition\u201d, and the remaining item pertained to the application of Maxbond):', '(a)\\u2003Five were of high severity: local spalling of stone panels at pin locations, loosening of shafts, brackets where a welded strap or stiffener connecting the U-shaped portion of the bracket (not shown in the diagram at [20] above) had broken, stacking of stones, and issues regarding the configuration of fixings to stone (it was unclear whether some pins were restraining some panels: see [55(a)] below).', '(b)\\u2003One was of low to high severity: namely, hairline cracks in stones. Arup recommended a full investigation to establish the integrity of the stone panels.', '(c)\\u2003Three were of medium severity: incorrect washers at conical bolts (some of which were beginning to corrode), certain repairs to stone panels (Arup noted that certain panels had to be replaced) and the application of Maxbond to the panels.', '(d)\\u2003Two were of medium to low severity: brackets that were incorrectly installed and built up stone sections to be replaced.', '(e)\\u2003Five were of low severity: spacers in joints, missing PVC sleeves, fungal growth on panels, staining of panels and debris at flashing.', '55\\u2003In Arup\u2019s 2nd 2004 Report, apart from the observations made in its 1st 2004 Report (see [51] above), Arup noted the presence of brackets with broken straps and stacking of panels and two further matters:', '(a)\\u2003First, some fixings had pins running between panels that did not connect to the shaft and therefore did not appear to have lateral restraints from the RC wall. Epoxy was covering the end of the shafts at these locations so Arup could not ascertain if there were actually pins at these locations or if there was only epoxy providing lateral restraint. 100', '(b)\\u2003Secondly, Dragages had, in the course of their inspection after the 1st Fall, applied Maxbond to panels that were reportedly of concern (see [42] above). Arup did not know the reason for this but stated that Maxbond would not be acceptable without further justification if it were meant to be a permanent remedy. Arup noted that Maxbond was \u201cbest used as a filler and not for adhesion\u201d. 101', 'Arup noted in particular that Maxbond had been applied to a panel with a crack or chip near a pin. 102', 'Arup observed that this \u201cin engineering terms is not considered to be a proper and permanent solution to the mechanical defects\u201d.', '56\\u2003Arup also observed that \u201cit was not unreasonable to suggest that the remaining parts of the [Building] also have issues similar to the issues [noted in the 2nd 2004 Report]\u201d, and that \u201c[t]he possibility of other issues can also not be ruled out within these un-inspected zones\u201d. 103', '57\\u2003Another aspect bears mention. Arup\u2019s 2nd 2004 Report made no mention of the vibrations from the Circle Line Works. Similarly, in a subsequent report by Arup including rectification proposals for infill panels dated January 2005, 104', 'no reference was made to vibrations. Mr Chin Tze Kiang (\u201cMr Chin\u201d), one of Arup\u2019s witnesses, explained this as follows: 105', '(a)\\u2003After Arup raised the issue of vibrations in the 1st 2004 Report, Millenia requested the LTA to provide records of vibrations. Arup then reviewed the records and concluded that there was little evidence of any vibrations exceeding the threshold beyond which damage would have been caused to the Building. Arup concluded that vibrations were \u201cnot an issue\u201d: it was \u201ctoo highly improbable\u201d that vibrations were a cause of the 1st Fall.', '(b)\\u2003Mr Chin added that after inspecting the Building, Arup inspected Millenia Tower. Millenia Tower is located very close to the Building and was also constructed by Dragages, using the same type of granite and the same fixings. 106', 'Arup found no defects on Millenia Tower and noted that the quality of the works to Millenia Tower were \u201cfar better\u201d. Arup therefore concluded that vibrations did not cause the defects.', 'These two pieces of evidence \u2013 the vibration records and the absence of defects on Millenia Tower \u2013 are of critical importance to the issue of the cause of the defects. I elaborate on these points below (see [336]\u2013[350] below).', '58\\u2003In January 2005, Millenia sent Arup\u2019s 2nd 2004 Report to Dragages, and Dragages subsequently sent the report to Builders Shop. 107', '59\\u2003In early 2005, Builders Shop contacted Mr Meur of Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade, apprised him of the events surrounding the 1st Fall, and indicated that it wished to appoint Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade to review and respond to Arup\u2019s 2004 Reports. 108', 'Builders Shop engaged Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade in April 2005. 109', 'Sometime thereafter, Mr Meur met Ms Perez for the first time. 110', 'Subsequently, they became friends.', '60\\u2003Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade produced two method statements pursuant to its engagement by Builders Shop: 111', '(a)\\u2003The first method statement was for the replacement of the 1st Panel and the two panels damaged during the 1st Fall (see [31] above). This was subsequently approved, and the 1st Panel and two damaged panels were replaced on or around 20 August 2005. 112', '(b)\\u2003The second method statement pertained to various issues raised by Arup in its 2004 Reports, including rusting washers, spacers between joints, spalling of panels, cracks on panels, and the stacking of panels.', '61\\u2003Unsurprisingly, disputes arose between Millenia, Dragages and Builders Shop over the state of the Fa\u00e7ade, whether there were defects in the first place, and even if so, whose responsibility it was to rectify them. The parties sought to resolve their disputes amicably and began to negotiate a settlement agreement from around September 2005. 113', 'However, the parties were unable to resolve their disputes at this stage. On 27 July 2006, Millenia commenced proceedings against Dragages and Builders Shop in Suit No 480 of 2006 (\u201cSuit 480\u201d). 114', 'In Suit 480, Millenia alleged that Dragages and Builders Shop had breached the warranties in the Deed, and sought specific performance of the Deed (and in the alternative, damages to be assessed) and a mandatory injunction for Dragages and Builders Shop to carry out rectification works to the Cladding.', '62\\u2003In December 2006, Millenia engaged Arup to conduct a non-destructive inspection of approximately 48 to 55 drops of the Building. 115', 'By 30 March 2007, Arup had inspected a total of 20 drops: drops 22\u201336 and 41\u201345. 116', '63\\u2003In December 2006, Millenia also engaged Earth Arts Pte Ltd (\u201cEarth Arts\u201d) to re-inspect the 8 Drops and to perform temporary restraining works to panels that Earth Arts assessed to be at a high risk of failing. 117', 'In total, Earth Arts performed restraining works to a total of 46 panels. 118', '64\\u2003In early 2007, Ms Perez informed Mr Meur that Millenia, Dragages and Builders Shop had agreed on the terms of a settlement agreement. According to Mr Meur, he understood from his discussion with Ms Perez that as part of the Settlement Agreement, Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade was to do the following: 119', '(a)\\u2003First, Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade was to inspect the Fa\u00e7ade, excluding the 8 Drops that Arup had inspected in 2004 (see [54] above). Specifically, the Inspection would cover drops 1\u201316, 22\u201337, 41\u201356 and 62\u201377.', '(b)\\u2003Secondly, Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade was to prepare a report summarising its findings and proposing rectification methods for the defects it found. Additionally, Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade was to advise on any area of the Fa\u00e7ade which represented a significant safety risk and to outline temporary measures that would make the Fa\u00e7ade safe.', 'Importantly, an inspection of the Rectification Works was not part of the scope of works outlined by Ms Perez.', '65\\u2003I pause here to note why Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade came to have a role under the Settlement Agreement. According to Ms Perez, she considered that Arup had behaved in an \u201cirrational and utterly irresponsible\u201d manner in its dealings with Dragages after the 1st Fall. 120', 'She desired a settlement of the disputes in Suit 480, and was agreeable, to that end, to Dragages rectifying defects in the Cladding. But she was concerned that Arup, as Millenia\u2019s consultant, would be the sole judge of \u201ctechnical matters\u201d, ie, what the defects were and how they were to be rectified. 121', 'She wanted a third party to play a \u201ccounterbalancing\u201d role vis-\u00e0-vis Arup, \u201cto keep the reasonableness going\u201d. 122', 'The reason for Ms Perez\u2019s appointment of Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade was that she had dealt with Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade, and Mr Meur in particular, since 2005 and was thus comfortable with Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade. As we shall see below, she also wielded considerable influence over Mr Meur.', '66\\u2003Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade then prepared a fee proposal dated 20 April 2007 for the works that Dragages had requested (\u201cthe April 2007 Proposal\u201d). 123', 'I note the following two pertinent aspects of the April 2007 Proposal:', '(a)\\u2003Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade proposed two options. The first involved an inspection of 30% of the Fa\u00e7ade. The second involved an inspection of the entire Fa\u00e7ade excluding the 8 Drops, and would be adopted if the 30% inspection did not yield enough information. Notably, Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade stated that the full inspection would take around four months to complete. The same four-month timeline was repeated in the proposal that was eventually accepted (see [67] below).', '(b)\\u2003Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade quoted a fee of $95,000 for the first option (ie, on the basis that a 30% inspection would be conducted) and a fee of $212,000 for the second option (ie, on the basis that a full inspection of the Fa\u00e7ade excluding the 8 Drops would be conducted).', '67\\u2003However, after discussions between Mr Meur and Ms Perez, Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade prepared a revised fee proposal dated 1 June 2007 (\u201cthe June 2007 Proposal\u201d). 124', 'This proposal provided for \u201cexperienced manpower supplied by Dragages\u201d to inspect the Cladding after a \u201ctraining period\u201d by Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade. Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade quoted the same fee of $95,000 for the first option involving a 30% inspection of the Fa\u00e7ade (see [66(b)] above). Yet the fee quoted for the second option (a full inspection excluding the 8 Drops) under the revised proposal fell sharply from $212,000 to $112,000. The June 2007 Proposal also indicated that the full inspection would take four months. Importantly, the scope of works did not include an inspection of the Rectification Works.', '68\\u2003Mr Meur claimed that the \u201cmain reason\u201d for this revised proposal was \u201cefficiency\u201d, because the Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade team at the time was small and the rectification works had to be completed quickly. 125', 'I do not accept this claim for two reasons. First, as things transpired, only two Builders Shop employees carried out the inspection of the Fa\u00e7ade (see [94] below). Secondly, Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade had initially proposed that it would do the inspection by itself.', '69\\u2003I find that the key reason for the revised proposal was the desire on the part of Dragages to cut costs. Mr Meur admitted that this was \u201cdefinitely a consideration\u201d. 126', 'During oral submissions, Mr Jeyaretnam candidly accepted that the revision in the proposals was \u201cobviously \u2026 a cost issue\u201d. 127', '70\\u2003Dragages and Builders Shop accepted the June 2007 Proposal. Builders Shop thereafter engaged Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade and paid for the works Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade performed under the June 2007 Proposal. 128', 'It is not clear exactly when Builders Shop engaged Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade. However, Ms Perez accepted during cross-examination that it had \u201cmore or less [been] explored and agreed\u201d by 7 August 2007 (see [71] below) that workers from Builders Shop would inspect the Fa\u00e7ade. She further admitted that neither Dragages nor Builders Shop informed Millenia of this during the negotiations leading up to the Settlement Agreement and upon execution of that agreement. 129', '71\\u2003On 7 August 2007, one week before the Settlement Agreement was executed, Dragages and Builders Shop executed a deed of settlement (\u201cthe Settlement Deed\u201d). 130', 'The Settlement Deed annexed a draft of the Settlement Agreement. Under cl 3.2, the parties agreed to use best efforts to limit Builders Shop\u2019s costs arising from the performance of its obligations under the Settlement Agreement to a sum not exceeding $200,000. Clause 3.3 provided that in the event the costs were between $200,000 and $250,000, Builders Shop and Dragages would share in those costs; and in the event that the costs exceeded $250,000, a dispute resolution mechanism that the Settlement Deed provided for would apply.', '72\\u2003On 14 August 2007, Millenia, Dragages and Builders Shop entered into the Settlement Agreement. 131', 'The provisions of the Settlement Agreement are of fundamental importance in these proceedings. I now turn to these provisions.', '73\\u2003The Settlement Agreement began with several recitals setting out details pertaining to the parties thereto, the Building, the Contract and the Deed. It then referred to the 1st Fall, Arup\u2019s 2004 Reports and the fact that Dragages had proposed rectification methods to remedy defects identified by Arup.', '74\\u2003There then followed the following recitals, which are significant because they are a window to the immediate context of the Settlement Agreement:', 'These recitals make clear that the parties entered into the Settlement Agreement to fully and finally settle their disputes concerning the 1st Fall, Suit 480, Arup\u2019s 2004 Reports and the rectification methods to remedy the defects. The parties shared the common intention that their disputes would be resolved through the rectification of all the defects in the Cladding. To this end, they sought to set out in the Settlement Agreement the works required to rectify the defects and how the costs of such works would be shared.', '75\\u2003I now turn to the clauses of the Settlement Agreement. In essence, the Settlement Agreement provided for three phases of works which I shall call \u201cthe Inspection Phase\u201d, \u201cthe Rectification Phase\u201d and the \u201cConfirmation Phase\u201d.', '76\\u2003First, cl 1 provided as follows:', 'In short, cl 1 provided for Dragages and Builders Shop to appoint \u201cMeinhardt\u201d to conduct a full inspection of the entire Fa\u00e7ade, excluding the \u201careas already dealt with in [Arup\u2019s 2004 Reports]\u201d, that is, the 8 Drops, to identify defects in the Cladding, prepare a list of defects, and then propose rectification methods for them (\u201cthe Rectification Works Method Statement\u201d). On first reading, cl 1 might appear to require an inspection of the entire Fa\u00e7ade including the 8 Drops. But critically, Millenia does not dispute that cl 1 did not require an inspection of the 8 Drops. Mr Singh made this clear during his opening statement, 132', 'and Ms Chee Tiong Choo (\u201cMs Chee\u201d), Millenia\u2019s Senior Vice President (Legal), 133', 'who was involved in preparing the Settlement Agreement, 134', 'confirmed this during the trial. 135', 'I therefore proceed on that basis in my analysis below.', '77\\u2003Two points are pertinent here:', '(a)\\u2003The Settlement Agreement defined \u201cMeinhardt\u201d as Meinhardt Singapore. Ms Perez claimed that this was an error: according to her, the parties to the Settlement Agreement had intended to refer to Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade. 136', 'But Ms Chee, who as noted above was involved in preparing the Settlement Agreement, denied that there was an error. 137', 'This dispute feeds into the issue of whether Meinhardt Singapore carried out the roles that the Settlement Agreement envisioned it would perform, or whether the roles were performed by Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade on its own account. This issue is central to Millenia\u2019s claims against Meinhardt Singapore. I discuss this at [499]\u2013[506] below. In discussing the Settlement Agreement, I will use its terminology by referring to the Meinhardt party as \u201cMeinhardt\u201d.', '(b)\\u2003Irrespective of whether the Settlement Agreement was meant to refer to Meinhardt Singapore or Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade, it plainly envisioned that a Meinhardt party would inspect the Fa\u00e7ade. It did not contemplate that the inspection would be carried out by Builders Shop. This is obvious because Builders Shop had installed the Cladding, and was therefore by no means, given the allegations of defective work, a party whom Millenia would have trusted to prepare an objective and complete record of the defects. In this regard, the Settlement Agreement departed significantly from the June 2007 Proposal under which Builders Shop was to conduct the inspection. As I have noted, Ms Perez admitted that Dragages, Builders Shop and Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade had \u201cmore or less \u2026 agreed\u201d on the June 2007 Proposal before or at the time the Settlement Deed was executed, on 7 August 2007. However, this was not disclosed to Millenia (see [70] above). It was clearly disingenuous for Ms Perez to sign the Settlement Agreement having agreed on a different scope of work with Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade. The evidence of Mr Foo Say Chiang (Mr Foo\u201d), the Senior Vice President, Property Management of Marina Properties Private Limited (\u201cMPPL\u201d), a subsidiary of Millenia that provides maintenance and property management services, 138', 'which I accept, was that he only learnt that Builders Shop had carried out the inspection after the present suit was commenced. 139', '78\\u2003I now turn to cl 10 of the Settlement Agreement, which dealt with what were called \u201cSchedule C Defects\u201d. Clause 10 stated that Schedule C Defects were \u201cpossible defects\u201d that Earth Arts and Arup had identified \u201cwhich in Earth Arts\u2019 and Arup\u2019s opinion require urgent attention\u201d. These were defects that Earth Arts and Arup identified in their inspections of the Fa\u00e7ade beginning in December 2006 (see [62]\u2013[63] above). These defects were cracks across panels and around pins. 140', 'Clause 10 provided that in Meinhardt\u2019s inspection of the Fa\u00e7ade under cl 1, Meinhardt was to inspect the Schedule C Defects in priority and to propose measures as Meinhardt deemed necessary.', '79\\u2003Clause 2 provided for Millenia to appoint Arup as its consultant for the purpose of reviewing and commenting on the Rectification Works Method Statement. Arup was entitled to raise reasonable queries or seek clarifications on the Rectification Works Method Statement, which Meinhardt was required to respond to, to Arup\u2019s reasonable satisfaction. Under cl 3, once Meinhardt had addressed Arup\u2019s queries and clarifications to Arup\u2019s reasonable satisfaction, the parties would be deemed to have accepted and agreed to be bound by the matters contained in the Rectification Works Method Statement.', '80\\u2003Clause 4 provided that approvals, confirmations and consents by Arup \u201cin connection with and\/or for the purposes of this Agreement shall be deemed to bind [Millenia]\u201d. Importantly, however, cl 5 provided as follows:', 'I make the following points about cl 5, which has two parts:', '(a)\\u2003The second part of cl 5 provided that Millenia and Arup would not assume liability to Meinhardt, Dragages or Builders Shop for their comments on, inter alia, the Rectification Works Method Statement and\/or its implementation. I find that cl 5 reflects the parties\u2019 intention to exclude the liability of Millenia and Arup in tort for these matters.', '(b)\\u2003By contrast to the second part of cl 5, the first part envisioned and sought to preserve the liability of Dragages, Builders Shop and, critically, Meinhardt for, inter alia, the adequacy and integrity of the Cladding. It is clear that the reference to Meinhardt here was a reference to the Meinhardt party who inspected the Cladding and proposed the Rectification Works Method Statement. The liability contemplated was plainly liability to Millenia. The Settlement Agreement did not provide for Millenia to contract with Meinhardt. Hence the liability of Meinhardt that the first part of cl 5 sought to preserve must have been Meinhardt\u2019s liability in tort. This point is vital to Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade\u2019s submission that it did not owe Millenia a duty of care in tort (see [543]\u2013[544] below).', '81\\u2003Clause 6 provided for Dragages and Builders Shop to rectify:', '(a)\\u2003the defects Meinhardt identified in its inspection of the Fa\u00e7ade (\u201cthe Identified Defects\u201d) and the Schedule C Defects (see [78] above), in accordance with the Rectification Works Method Statement; and', '(b)\\u2003\u201cSchedule A Defects\u201d: these were defects identified in Arup\u2019s 2004 Reports which were agreed between the parties, and were to be rectified in accordance with rectification methods Meinhardt was to propose. Arup was entitled to raise reasonable queries and clarifications concerning these rectification methods, to which Meinhardt was obliged to respond to Arup\u2019s reasonable satisfaction, upon which the rectification methods would bind the parties.', 'Significantly, it is undisputed, and I so find, that the 2nd Panel was not identified as a panel with a defect in either Schedule A or Schedule C to the Settlement Agreement.', '82\\u2003Clause 12 set out the standard for the Rectification Works:', 'In brief, the Rectification Works were required to be performed in a \u201cgood workmanlike manner\u201d, to be in compliance with the specifications in the Contract, and to be of a \u201cpermanent nature\u201d.', '83\\u2003Clause 13 provided for the terms and conditions of the Deed to apply to the Rectification Works for the remainder of the warranty period:', '84\\u2003Clause 14 provided that Dragages and Builders Shop would do all things reasonably necessary to ensure the Rectification Works were carried out and completed in accordance with statutory provisions and regulations.', '85\\u2003The third phase of works was the Confirmation Phase. The key provision is cl 11 of the Settlement Agreement, which states:', 'In short, in the Confirmation Phase:', '(a)\\u2003Dragages and Builders Shop would first provide a written notification that the Rectification Works were completed.', '(b)\\u2003Meinhardt would then inspect the Cladding to ensure the Rectification Works complied with, inter alia, the Rectification Works Method Statement and cll 12 and 14 of the Settlement Agreement.', '(c)\\u2003Subsequently, Meinhardt would provide Millenia with a written confirmation of its approval of the Rectification Works.', '(d)\\u2003Arup would thereafter be entitled to inspect the Rectification Works to satisfy itself that they were in accordance with the Settlement Agreement. The Rectification Works would be deemed completed upon Arup\u2019s written confirmation of the same.', '86\\u2003I now set out other pertinent provisions of the Settlement Agreement.', '87\\u2003First, cll 25 and 26 provided for the effect of the Settlement Agreement on Suit 480 and the rights and obligations of the parties. These provisions are relevant to the issue of whether some of Millenia\u2019s claims against Dragages and Builders Shop have been compromised. I discuss them at [445]\u2013[446] below.', '88\\u2003Secondly, cll 2 and 16 of the Settlement Agreement provided that Arup was Millenia\u2019s consultant. Clause 19 of the Settlement Agreement provided that Meinhardt was Dragages\u2019 consultant.', '89\\u2003Thirdly, cll 17 and 18 provided for the costs of the Rectification Works and other incidental costs to be apportioned between the parties. Under cl 18, Millenia was to make a contribution of $70,000 in two payments of $35,000; the second $35,000 payment was to be made within 14 days after Meinhardt issued its written confirmation under cl 11 (see [85(c)] above).', '90\\u2003Fourthly, cl 34 provided that in the event disputes between the parties to the Settlement Agreement arose, they would first be resolved by meeting(s) between the chief executive officer\/managing director\/equivalent of the parties.', '91\\u2003By a letter dated 14 August 2007 (the \u201c2007 Appointment Letter\u201d), 141', 'Millenia appointed Arup as its consultant to advise it on the Rectification Works. Under the 2007 Appointment Letter, Arup agreed to review the proposed rectification methods (during the Inspection Phase), to hold meetings with Millenia and Dragages concerning the progress of the Rectification Works (during the Rectification Phase), and to inspect the Rectification Works (during the Confirmation Phase), albeit cl 6 provided that \u201cit is not expected that [Arup\u2019s] specialist inspectors will review the entire fa\u00e7ade\u201d. 142', 'I note two further points about the 2007 Appointment Letter:', '(a)\\u2003First, cl 7 stated that in providing its services, Arup would \u201cexercise the degree of skill, care and diligence normally exercised by consulting engineers in similar circumstances\u201d.', '(b)\\u2003Secondly, the agreement stipulated a fixed fee of S$40,000.', '92\\u2003As I have noted (see [70] above), Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade was engaged by Builders Shop on the terms of the June 2007 Proposal.', '93\\u2003On 28 August 2007, Mr Meur sent a letter to Dragages which enclosed a drawing describing Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade\u2019s intended investigation methodology. The drawing reflected four zones \u2013 Zones A to D \u2013 which Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade proposed to inspect and eight zones \u2013 Zones 1 to 8 \u2013 which had been inspected previously (the 8 Drops). Mr Meur stated that Zones A to D would each require \u201capproximately 16 drops to complete\u201d. 143', 'Dragages and Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade then agreed to start the inspection, which I shall refer to as \u201cthe 2007 Inspection\u201d.', '94\\u2003Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade divided Zones A to D into 45 \u201cdrops\u201d. 144', 'Mr Ong of Meinhardt Facade, a senior engineer and fa\u00e7ade consultant, spent about one week inspecting five of these \u201cdrops\u201d. 145', 'Mr Ong then trained two employees of Builders Shop, Mr Liew Wai Chan and Mr Zhang Jun Jian, to inspect the rest of Zones A to D. 146', 'These workers were the \u201cexperienced manpower\u201d supplied by Dragages under the terms of the June 2007 Proposal (see [67] above). Mr Ong asked the two workers about their background and they told him that they worked in construction and had experience with stone. But Mr Ong did not make any further inquiries. He assumed that the workers were qualified because they were the workers who had been supplied. 147', 'When questioned on this point, Mr Meur confirmed that Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade did not check whether the workers had experience in fa\u00e7ade inspections. 148', '95\\u2003Mr Ong trained the Builders Shop workers by taking them to the Fa\u00e7ade in the BMU, informing them of the defects he had seen, showing them drawings or mark ups from his inspection, teaching them how to note defects, and showing them how to use a borescope. 149', 'A borescope is a fibre-optic device that was inserted into the joints between the panels for brackets and their components to be inspected and photographed. 150', 'Importantly, it could only be used if it could be inserted into the joints; yet some joints were too narrow to permit insertion of the borescope (see [681(a)] below).) I find that the training was not extensive. As I note below, the entire inspection took about one month (see [96] below). According to Mr Ong, he met one of the workers on the Friday of the first week, ie, the week that he inspected five drops (see [94] above), and met the other worker on Monday. The workers began their inspection on Tuesday. 151', 'They were provided with inspection worksheets which they filled in during the inspection. 152', 'The workers also took photographs of panels they inspected.', '96\\u2003The entire inspection, including Mr Ong\u2019s inspection, lasted about one month, from 4 September to 6 October 2007. 153', '97\\u2003It is disputed whether the entire Fa\u00e7ade excluding the 8 Drops was inspected in the 2007 Inspection. The evidence was as follows:', '(a)\\u2003The evidence of Mr Peter Hartog (\u201cMr Hartog\u201d), Arup\u2019s fa\u00e7ade expert, was that the 2007 Inspection only covered 45 of the 80 drops: drops 6\u201317 (Zone D), 22\u201332 (Zone A), 46\u201356 (Zone B) and 62\u201372 (Zone C). 154', 'His evidence seems to have been based on a layout plan in the report by Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade dated 24 December 2007 (\u201cMeinhardt\u2019s 2007 Report\u201d), which suggests that only 45 drops were inspected. 155', 'It is not in dispute that drops 6\u201316, 22\u201332, 46\u201356 and 62\u201372 were inspected. Mr Hartog added, and I find, that drop 17 was also inspected.', '(b)\\u2003However, Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade submits that one drop under its numbering system did not equate to one drop under Arup\u2019s system, and that the layout plan was not meant to accurately represent all of the drops that were inspected. Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade claims that the inspection sheets from the 2007 Inspection and investigation statistics from its report dated 20 March 2008 (\u201cMeinhardt\u2019s 2008 Report\u201d) show that the entire Fa\u00e7ade except the 8 Drops was inspected during the 2007 Inspection. 156', '98\\u2003Having considered the evidence, I do not accept that only 45 of the 80 drops were inspected during the 2007 Inspection. First, the investigation statistics indicate, and I find, that a total of 13,484 panels (3384 panels in Zone A, 3495 panels in Zone B, 3227 panels in Zone C and 3378 panels in Zone D) were inspected. 157', 'If Mr Hartog was correct, only 56% of the Cladding (45 out of 80 drops) was inspected. This would amount to around 9156 panels (based on the total number of 16,277 panels on the Cladding: see [16] above), far less than the 13,484 panels which were inspected. Secondly, the inspection sheets show that many of Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade\u2019s drops had three or four horizontally adjacent panels: in other words, they were larger than the drops under Arup\u2019s classification which were generally two panels wide (see [18] above). 158', 'This indicates that the 45 \u201cdrops\u201d inspected during the 2007 Inspection covered a greater area than 45 drops under Arup\u2019s numbering system.', '99\\u2003However, it does not appear that 72 drops (or 90% of the Cladding) were inspected either. A total of 13,484 panels were inspected, which amounts to about 83% of the panels (based on the total figure of 16,277 panels).', '100\\u2003Mr Meur stated that he understood from Ms Perez that the inspection was to cover 64 drops: drops 1\u201316, 22\u201337, 41\u201356 and 62\u201377 (see [64(a)] above). Dragages and Builders Shop do not dispute that the 2007 Inspection was only to cover these drops. I thus find that the 2007 Inspection was to cover drops 1\u201316, 22\u201337, 41\u201356 and 62\u201377.', '101\\u2003If the 2007 Inspection covered 65 out of 80 drops \u2013 the 64 drops noted above as well as drop 17 (see [97(a)] above) \u2013 it would have covered around 81% of the Cladding. This percentage roughly accords with the investigation statistics which indicate that 83% of the Cladding was inspected (see [99] above). Moreover, Dragages and Builders Shop do not claim that Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade did not fulfil its scope of works. I thus find that drops 1\u201316, 22\u201337, 41\u201356, 62\u201377, as well as drop 17 (see [97(a)] above), were inspected during the 2007 Inspection, ie, a total of 65 drops.', '102\\u2003I note the following two points:', '(a)\\u2003First, as things transpired, two of the 8 Drops were covered in the inspection (drops 17 and 46) (see [54] above). Notably however, Drop 80, from which the 2nd Panel fell (see [150] below), was not inspected.', '(b)\\u2003Secondly, the inspection took just over a month whereas it had been contemplated in both the April 2007 Proposal and the June 2007 Proposal that a full inspection would take four months. This raises questions over the thoroughness of the inspection that was performed.', '103\\u2003Returning now to the chronology of events, on 24 December 2007, Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade issued Meinhardt\u2019s 2007 Report. 159', 'This set out remedial proposals relating to observations about glue, pins, cracks, foreign objects, gaps between panels, shaky panels and brackets.', '104\\u2003Arup provided comments on Meinhardt\u2019s 2007 Report by a revised letter dated 29 January 2008. 160', 'In its letter, Arup noted the following points:', '(a)\\u2003Meinhardt\u2019s 2007 Report did not mention infill panels.

Arup and Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade attended this meeting on 14 February 2008. During this meeting, Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade \u201chighlighted that the location of \u2026 infill panels have been identified\u201d but added that it would consult with Dragages before revising Meinhardt\u2019s 2007 Report to include details regarding infill panels. 161', '105\\u2003 On 20 March 2008, Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade issued Meinhardt\u2019s 2008 Report. 162', 'I note the following points about Meinhardt\u2019s 2008 Report:', '(a)\\u2003First, the report stated that about 40% of the panels inspected had at least one observed defect. 163', '(b)\\u2003Secondly, and notably, a table in the report indicates that there were (potential) issues with the pins securing 192 panels: there were 61 cases of \u201c3-pins insertion\u201d, 118 cases of \u201c2-pins insertion\u201d and nine cases of \u201c1-pin insertion\u201d. 164', 'This table was only referred to once during the trial, during Mr Chia\u2019s re-examination of Mr Chin. 165', 'On first sight, the table suggests that a total of 61 panels were found to be secured by three pins, 118 panels secured by two pins and nine panels secured by one pin. This impression is bolstered by a section in the report stating: 166', 'But it is reasonably clear, and I find, that the initial impression produced by this table cannot be correct. It is undisputed that a panel would only have been adequately restrained if it was secured by at least three pins (see [246] below). Therefore, if there were 118 panels secured by two pins and nine panels secured by one pin, many if not all of these panels would have fallen off the Fa\u00e7ade. Millenia and Arup would have been extremely alarmed, and significant follow-up work would have been carried out immediately after they learnt of this finding. But this did not occur. The comments in another section of the report reveal why. The comments indicate that these 192 panels were panels that may not have been properly restrained by four pins, not panels that in fact were not properly restrained by four pins. These 192 panels comprised (1) panels with less than four pins inserted into the stone, (2) panels with four pins inserted into the stone, but with at least one pin possibly not attached to a shaft, (3) panels with pins inserted shallowly into the stone and (4) panels where the shafts showed signs of corrosion. 167', 'Notwithstanding this, such an observation should have set off alarm bells.', '106\\u2003Arup provided further comments on Meinhardt\u2019s 2008 Report by a letter dated 18 April 2008. 168', 'Arup noted, among other things, that the location of infill panels had not been identified in Meinhardt\u2019s 2008 Report, and stated that any panel with less than four (functioning) restraining pins needed to be reinstated to its original four-pin configuration, notwithstanding calculations indicating a three-pin configuration was structurally safe. Arup also raised issues about the remedial methods and reiterated its concerns about use of structural silicone.', '107\\u2003On 25 April 2008, Mr Ong sent an email to Mr Adrianto, copying Ms Perez and Mr Meur, seeking Dragages\u2019 assistance in locating the infill panels. 169', 'Later that day, Ms Perez replied rather disingenuously stating, among other things, that \u201cthe location [of the infill panels] will be provided in [detail] during the rectification works.

On 29 April 2008, Ms Perez replied to this email stating: 171', 'It appears that this was the first time that Dragages informed any of the other parties to this suit that there was no list of infill panels, and I so find.', '109\\u2003Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade replied to Arup\u2019s comments on Meinhardt\u2019s 2008 Report in a letter dated 2 May 2008 stating, among other things, that the issue of infill panels \u201chas been settled [and] resolved previously between [Dragages] [and] [Millenia] \u2026 there is [no] such tracking list record [of infill panels]\u201d. 172', 'The statement that the issue of infill panels had been resolved was not true.', '110\\u2003Arup then provided additional comments on Meinhardt\u2019s 2008 Report on 5 May 2008, 173', 'reiterating that panels with less than four functioning pins had to be reinstated to the original four-pin configuration. Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade replied to these comments on 22 May 2008. 174', 'Notably, in its reply, Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade finally accepted that panels with less than four functioning pins would be reinstated to their original four-pin configuration.', '111\\u2003In the interim, Arup sent a letter to Millenia dated 8 May 2008 (\u201cthe 8 May 2008 letter\u201d) stating that the rectification proposals were \u201cacceptable and have sufficiently addressed most of the issues raised apart from the structural silicone method\u201d. 175', 'Arup recommended that the Rectification Works proceed while matters relating to the structural silicone method were put on hold.', '112\\u2003On 12 May 2008, Mr Foo sent an email to Ms Perez stating that Millenia had no objections to Dragages proceeding with the Rectification Works using the methodologies accepted by Arup, other than structural silicone. 176', '113\\u2003The Rectification Works began in June 2008. 177', 'The Rectification Works were, at any one time, carried out by two Builders Shop workers, albeit it was not the same two workers who carried out all of the Rectification Works. 178', 'The Builders Shop workers worked under the supervision of a supervisor, Mr Md Shah Alam Md Sultan Ahmed (\u201cMr Shah Alam\u201d). While the Rectification Works were being carried out, Mr Ong would inspect the works. When he was not satisfied with the workmanship, he would direct the workers to improve the works and re-inspect the works thereafter. 179', 'Apart from Mr Ong, Mr Adrianto also supervised, but did not inspect, the Rectification Works. 180', '114\\u2003During the Rectification Works, Mr Ong inspected every single stone panel that was rectified by Builders Shop on all of the 80 Drops. 181', 'It is thus not in dispute, and I find, that Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade inspected some panels on drop 80, the drop from which the 2nd Panel fell, during the Rectification Phase. But the parties dispute whether Mr Ong inspected the 2nd Panel itself during the Rectification Phase. I now set out the relevant evidence on this point.', '115\\u2003During the trial, Mr Chia brought Mr Shah Alam to a marked-up layout of the fa\u00e7ade. 182', 'This was a final report which Dragages prepared, based on Builders Shop\u2019s records of the Rectification Works, which ostensibly showed the panels to which Builders Shop had performed works and the nature of those works (\"the Final Progress Report\u201d). Drop 80 was described as Corner C6 in this document. Mr Shah Alam admitted that, according to the Final Progress Report, dead load rods were inserted in the gaps between panels 41 and 42, and panels 42 and 43, and a twisted rod was embedded at the top of panel 42. 183', 'Panel 42 was the 2nd Panel. During the trial, Mr Ong admitted that if rectification works had been performed to the 2nd Panel, he would have inspected the 2nd Panel. 184', '116\\u2003However, Mr Ong then testified that rectification works were not carried out to or near the 2nd Panel: the Final Progress Report was inaccurate. He explained that when he inspected the location from which the 2nd Panel fell on 13 February 2011 (see [154] below), he did not see evidence of any rectification works. He referred me to a photograph which indicated the same. 185', 'Mr Ong also stated that he did not find any dead load rods or twisted rods in the debris of the 2nd Panel when he inspected the debris (see [382(c)] below). 186', 'Mr Ong\u2019s evidence here was corroborated by photographs, and I accepted it accordingly. Moreover, I note the following points concerning the Final Progress Report:', '(a)\\u2003First, as Mr Jeyaretnam noted, the Final Progress Report was inconsistent with an earlier report prepared by Dragages, a weekly report that appears to have been prepared soon after the Rectification Works to drop 80 were completed (\u201cthe Weekly Progress Report). 187', 'The Weekly Progress Report showed that no works were performed to panel 42.', '(b)\\u2003Secondly, Mr Jeyaretnam also pointed out that the Final Progress Report indicated that there was a long crack on panel 40 of drop 80 that was rectified by \u201cstitches\u201d (see [136] below). Yet Arup did not find any crack or stitches on panel 40 when it inspected it after the 2nd Fall: the photograph of panel 40 showed that there were no cracks or stitches. 188', '117\\u2003Further, as I have noted, the 2nd Panel was not identified as a panel with a Schedule A or a Schedule C Defect (see [81] above). Again, Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade did not inspect drop 80 during the Inspection Phase (see [102(a)] above) and thus would not have identified the 2nd Panel as requiring rectification. In short, the evidence indicates that the need for the 2nd Panel to be rectified was not brought to Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade\u2019s attention. This supports the conclusion that no rectification works were carried out to the 2nd Panel.', '118\\u2003I accordingly find that the Final Progress Report contained inaccuracies. More specifically, I find that no rectification works were performed to the 2nd Panel. Mr Ong\u2019s evidence was that during the Rectification Phase, he inspected panels that had been rectified (see [114] above). I therefore find that Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade did not specifically inspect the 2nd Panel during the Rectification Phase.', '119\\u2003In late 2008, the works for the construction of the Downtown Line Promenade Station (\u201cthe Downtown Line Works\u201d) commenced. 189', '120\\u2003On 12 February 2009, Mr Vincent Chua (\u201cMr Chua\u201d) of MPPL, an engineer who was Mr Foo\u2019s subordinate, 190', 'sent an email about the Rectification Works to Ms Perez. 191', 'Mr Chua, who does not seem to have been familiar with the Settlement Agreement, asked Ms Perez, inter alia, the following:', '(a)\\u2003whether Meinhardt (Fa\u00e7ade) required approval from Pontiac or MPPL in respect of the rectification methods; and', '(b)\\u2003whether MPPL, as Millenia\u2019s representative, was able to request for mock-up samples showing the rectification methods.', '121\\u2003In her reply later that day, Ms Perez stated the following: 192', '(a)\\u2003In reply to the query noted in [120(a)] above, she stated: \u201cNo. [Millenia] or MPPL do not need to approve the methods \u2026 It is Meinhardt that recommend, review and approve repair methods\u201d [emphasis added]. This was misleading. Ms Perez knew the Settlement Agreement provided for Arup to approve the Rectification Works Method Statement. Tellingly, when cross-examined on this, she could only say: \u201c\u2026 he asked a general question, I gave a general answer. If he needed more clarifications, I am sure that he would have asked \u2026\u201d. 193', '(b)\\u2003In reply to the query noted in [120(b)] above, Ms Perez stated, inter alia, that \u201c[only] Meinhardt has the full liability for the repair works, including recommendations, material approval, supervision, review and approval of works, inspections, [aesthetics], etc\u201d [emphasis added]. As I have noted, Ms Perez sought to resile from this in her testimony, stating that \u201cliability\u201d was \u201cmaybe \u2026 not the correct word to use \u2026 an overstatement, knowing better now what liability means\u201d. For the reasons given above, I find Ms Perez\u2019s evidence difficult to accept. I find that Ms Perez was seeking to reassure Millenia about the Rectification Works by misleadingly alluding to the potential liability of Meinhardt (Fa\u00e7ade) for the same (see [38(a)] above).', '122\\u2003On 26 August 2009, a representative of MPPL wrote to Mr Adrianto to inquire whether Arup could inspect the Rectification Works, stating that Arup would require about a week to do so. 194', 'Mr Adrianto replied to reject this request, stating that the works needed to be completed without interruption. 195', 'Thus, Arup was not able to inspect the Rectification Works while they were in progress.', '123\\u2003The Rectification Works were completed in October 2009. 196', 'I note that there is some dispute over whether structural silicone was used during the Rectification Works.

I accept Mr Meur\u2019s evidence on this score and find that Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade knew, as of June 2009, that it was not contractually required to issue a completion certificate. 200', '125\\u2003In November 2009, Dragages requested Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade to issue a certificate to certify that the Rectification Works were completed in accordance with the Rectification Works Method Statement. 201', 'Mr Ong prepared a draft of this certificate and sent it to Mr Adrianto for review. 202', 'Ms Perez agreed that Dragages was \u201cinvolved in giving some pointers for [the] drafting\u201d of the certificate. 203', '126\\u2003On 17 December 2009, Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade issued the certificate (\u201cthe 17 December 2009 Certificate\u201d).

I further find based on his evidence in his AEIC that nonetheless, he approved the issuance of the revised certificate because (1) he wanted to expedite the process to please Ms Perez and Dragages and (2) he was satisfied that the Rectification Works were carried out properly. In short: Mr Meur knew that by issuing the letter to Millenia, Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade was incurring a potential liability to Millenia.

Also, some panels with minor cracks were not rectified.', '(c)\\u2003In terms of cracks with restraints installed within the crack lines, the rectification methods had to be adjusted to deal with site issues such as tenant complaints about noise and vibrations due to drilling in carrying out the rectification methods.

Further, the application of the Stitching Procedure had been combined with the installation of wind load restraints and\/or dead load rods where necessary.', 'I do not accept that the Stitching Procedure was employed for the sole reason of accommodating tenant complaints (see [(c)] above). Mr James Phillip Mann (\u201cMr Mann\u201d), one of Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade\u2019s fa\u00e7ade experts, noted that his client had advised that the Stitching Procedure \u201cwas developed on site in response to the decision not to use structural silicone \u2026 along with the decision to minimize the number of cracked panels that would need replacement\u201d [emphasis added]. 230', 'I find that one important reason, if not the principal reason, why the Stitching Procedure was used on the Fa\u00e7ade was to cut costs.', '139\\u2003On 24 May 2010, after re-inspecting a drop it inspected in preparing the 1st 2010 Report, Arup issued a second report (the \u201c2nd 2010 Report\u201d). 231', 'The 2nd 2010 Report stated that Arup had not observed that restraints had been added to the stitched panels as averred in Meinhardt\u2019s April 2010 Reply.', '140\\u2003On 15 June 2010, Ms Perez sent an email to Millenia stating: 232', 'By this email, Ms Perez informed Millenia that she was instructing Mr Adrianto and Meinhardt (Fa\u00e7ade) not to respond to queries by Millenia or Arup until Millenia made full payment of monies (allegedly) due to Dragages under (cl 18 of) the Settlement Agreement. Ms Perez threatened legal proceedings regarding the same. She also threatened to create bad publicity about Millenia. 233', '141\\u2003On 28 June 2010, Mr Foo sent a letter to Dragages stating as follows: 234', '(a)\\u2003The 10 February 2010 Certificate was not in accordance with cl 11 of the Settlement Agreement for three reasons:', '(b)\\u2003However, Millenia was prepared to pay a sum of $37,450 to Dragages upon written confirmation from Meinhardt Singapore that the 10 February 2010 Certificate was issued pursuant to and in compliance with cl 11. Nonetheless, this was not be construed as an acceptance by Millenia or Arup that the Rectification Works had been completed.', '142\\u2003In July 2010, Ms Perez informed Mr Meur of Millenia\u2019s concerns as set out in [141(a)(i)] and [141(a)(iii)] above. 235', '143\\u2003Mr Meur then approached Dr Juneid Qureshi (\u201cDr Qureshi\u201d), Meinhardt Singapore\u2019s Group Design Director of Structural Engineering. 236', 'He explained that there was a dispute regarding the Fa\u00e7ade and that one of the parties had engaged Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade, and asked for a letter to explain that, in the Meinhardt Group, fa\u00e7ade engineering was Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade\u2019s and not Meinhardt Singapore\u2019s expertise. 237', 'Dr Qureshi agreed to do so, and issued a letter dated 19 July 2010 for Meinhardt Singapore (\u201cthe 19 July 2010 Letter\u201d) stating as follows: 238', '144\\u2003Mr Meur also obtained a copy of the Settlement Agreement from Ms Perez. I find that this was the first time Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade saw the Settlement Agreement. Mr Meur confirmed during the trial that he read the Settlement Agreement, and in particular cll 11, 12 and 14. He also confirmed that he knew Millenia would only pay Dragages (the second $35,000 payment under cl 18) upon receiving the written confirmation from Meinhardt under cl 11. 239', 'He then re-issued the certificate by a letter to Millenia dated 20 July 2010 copied to Dragages and Builders Shop (\u201cthe 20 July 2010 Certificate\u201d).

The letter states: 242', 'I make the following points about the 6 August 2010 Letter. It is clear that the 20 July 2010 Certificate was not in complete compliance with the requirements of cl 11 of the Settlement Agreement. It contained the phrase \u201cto the best of our knowledge\u201d, which Millenia had objected to (see [131] above). However, it appears that after being threatened by Ms Perez (see [140] above), Millenia decided to yield to Dragages\u2019 demands for payment. But Millenia sought to protect its position. It did this by making clear that it was paying out on a without-prejudice basis, and without accepting that Meinhardt had issued the necessary written confirmation under cl 11 of the Settlement Agreement. As we shall see, the unequivocal statements to this effect in the 6 August 2010 Letter are important. This is because they undercut the argument that the 20 July 2010 Certificate caused Millenia to suffer the losses it is claiming for in this action. I elaborate on this point at [535(a)] and [575(c)] below.', '147\\u2003On 7 September 2010, Arup and Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade conducted a joint inspection of the Cladding. Arup then sent an email to Millenia stating that, upon the inspection, it was confirmed that the additional restraining pins were not installed in cases where panels with cracks had been stitched. 243', '148\\u2003On 28 September 2010, Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade issued a report (\u201cMeinhardt\u2019s September 2010 Reply\u201d). 244', 'This stated that dead load rods were not installed to secure all panels with hairline cracks, but were used on a case by case basis. Arup did not accept this. On 11 October 2010, Arup sent an email to Millenia on Meinhardt\u2019s September 2010 Reply to reiterate its recommendation that all cracked panels be replaced or restrained with dead load pins. 245', '149\\u2003It does not seem that there was any further development thereafter in the discussions between Arup and Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade on the Rectification Works. The dispute regarding the cracked panels was not resolved. Arup did not ultimately issue written confirmation that the Rectification Works were carried out in compliance with the Settlement Agreement (see [85(d)] above). Notably, although Dragages submits that Arup did issue such confirmation (see [137] above), Ms Perez, its sole factual witness, accepted that (1) Arup did not do so and (2) the Rectification Works were thus not deemed completed under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, and I so find. 246', '150\\u2003On 10 February 2011 at 8.43pm, the 2nd Panel fell from the 25th storey of the Building. 247', 'The panel fell from drop 80, 248', 'a drop that Arup had inspected in 2004 (see [54] above). As the 2nd Panel fell, it hit another panel (panel 81) on the 15th storey. The 2nd Panel landed on a concrete canopy one floor about the ground floor and broke into many fragments upon impact. 249', 'Some of the fragments spread onto the ground floor. Two passers-by were injured by the debris of the 2nd Panel, and significant property damage was caused.', '151\\u2003On 11 February 2011, the BCA issued a second order to Millenia (\u201cthe 2nd BCA Order\u201d). 250', 'The BCA ordered Millenia to immediately appoint a PE to assess the structural integrity and stability of the Cladding, and to immediately take precautionary measures to obviate any danger. In addition, the BCA ordered Millenia to submit an investigation report prepared by the PE, which was to recommend plans for rectification works, and to subsequently perform the works recommended by the PE and approved by the BCA. The 2nd BCA Order concluded by stating that the BCA \u201cmay direct a closure of the building subject to the conditions of the building\u201d.', '152\\u2003On or about 11 February 2011, Millenia engaged Arup as its PE. 251', 'Arup then began to inspect the Cladding. I will refer to this inspection as \u201cthe 100% Inspection\u201d. In doing so, Arup followed a protocol (\u201cthe Aurecon Protocol\u201d) developed by Mr Yang Li (\u201cMr Yang\u201d), Millenia\u2019s fa\u00e7ade expert in this case. 252', 'The Aurecon Protocol required Arup to record observations of various items listed therein. Notably, two of Arup\u2019s witnesses, Mr Derrick Yap Chong Yeow (\u201cMr Yap\u201d) and Mr Chin, testified, and I find, that in inspecting the Cladding, Arup was, in general, simply recording observations in accordance with the Aurecon Protocol. Arup did not perform the further evaluative task of assessing whether its observations amounted to defects, 253', 'with one exception: in identifying some panels to be in immediate danger of falling in the near future, Arup assessed those panels to be defective. 254', 'Having recorded its observations, Arup prepared reports which it sent to Millenia (\u201cthe 100% Inspection Reports\u201d). 255', 'Arup also created spreadsheets (\u201cthe 100% Inspection Spreadsheets\u201d). There were 20 of such spreadsheets, each of which identified the panels on which one category of observation was found. 256', '153\\u2003On or around 11 February 2011, Millenia engaged Cementone (S) Pte Ltd (\u201cCementone\u201d) to carry out restraining works on the panels which Arup identified were in immediate danger of falling.', '154\\u2003On 13 February 2011, Mr Ong inspected the location from which the 2nd Panel had fallen in the presence of an Arup representative. 257', '155\\u2003On 25 February 2011, Arup issued a report (\u201cArup\u2019s 2011 Report\u201d). 258', 'In brief, Arup stated the following:', '(a)\\u2003The 2nd Panel was an infill panel which, similar to the 1st Panel, had been installed without pins fixed into its top edge. 259', 'Arup noted one difference: the panel above the 1st Panel had been restrained with a half pin welded to the shaft. However, Arup did not find such a half pin restraining the panel above the 2nd Panel. 260', '(b)\\u2003Arup noted that while the original drawings for the Works did not include a detail for the installation of infill panels, there was a sketch of the detail in construction stage documentation. However, Arup had not found evidence that this intended method of installing infill panels had been adopted on site. Arup reiterated that it would not have been possible for infill panels to be installed with top pins (see [49] above). 261', '(c)\\u2003Arup noted that, as was the case with the 1st Panel (see [47(c)] above), the lower bracket pins of the 2nd Panel, which were still in place, had \u201cbent outwards due to a prying action of a rotating panel about its bottom edge\u201d. 262', 'In other words, the lower pins had been bent as the 2nd Panel rotated outwards before falling from the Cladding. This evidence is of vital importance because, as I explain at [399]\u2013[401] below, it indicates what the cause of the 2nd Fall was.', '(d)\\u2003Arup recommended the rectification of all infill panels, and a full 100% inspection of all the panels on the Building.', '156\\u2003On or around 8 August 2012, Arup issued a letter to Pontiac Land Pte Ltd (\u201cthe 8 August 2012 Letter\u201d). 263', 'This letter is important in relation to the issue of whether Millenia is entitled to claim the cost of a reclad of the Fa\u00e7ade:', '(a)\\u2003Arup first noted that it had found \u201c16 typical defects\u201d, three of which were \u201ccritical\u201d, in its inspection of the Cladding.

Arup also noted that a reclad would provide an opportunity to improve the Fa\u00e7ade with, eg, improved thermal performance, improved durability and an improved building image.', '(f)\\u2003Arup then proposed to carry out a study to review the options for the Fa\u00e7ade, and stated the following:', 'In short, in the 8 August 2012 Letter, Arup recommended that Millenia reclad the Fa\u00e7ade. I accept that Arup noted in this letter that a reclad would provide Millenia with an opportunity to improve the Fa\u00e7ade. Yet reading the letter as a whole, it is clear, and I find, that the recommendation to reclad was made for three reasons: (1) safety (to eliminate the risk of future failures of the Fa\u00e7ade); (2) speed (to ensure safety risks were addressed swiftly) and (3) aesthetics (to avoid the prospect that rectification works would make the Fa\u00e7ade unsightly).', '157\\u2003During cross-examination of Ms Chee, Mr Ho relied on the 8 August 2012 Letter to suggest that Millenia had decided to reclad the Fa\u00e7ade in bad faith. According to Mr Ho, Millenia\u2019s motive for recladding the Fa\u00e7ade was to better it: there were no genuine safety concerns justifying a reclad of the entire Fa\u00e7ade. 264', 'Mr Singh objected to this line of cross-examination, on the basis that Dragages did not plead that Millenia was opportunistic in recladding the Fa\u00e7ade and Millenia had thus not brought forward evidence to refute this allegation. 265', 'Mr Singh emphasised that the 8 August 2012 Letter was disclosed in discovery (on 10 June 2013); yet Dragages had not amended its pleadings to allege bad faith by Millenia. 266', 'I agreed with Mr Singh, and indicated to Mr Ho that while it was open to Dragages to challenge the need for a reclad, the suggestion that Millenia was opportunistic in recladding the Fa\u00e7ade was not part of its case. 267', '158\\u2003In any event, Ms Chee testified that the decision to reclad was made purely on safety reasons, 268', 'and I accept her evidence. Millenia submits that it decided to reclad the Fa\u00e7ade based on Arup\u2019s advice. 269', 'I note that Ms Chee did not expressly testify that Millenia relied on Arup\u2019s advice to reclad the Fa\u00e7ade. But it is difficult to conceive that Millenia did not do so given that (1) Arup was Millenia\u2019s consultant, (2) Arup recommended a reclad for safety reasons and (3) Millenia decided to reclad the Fa\u00e7ade on safety grounds. I thus find that Millenia relied on Arup\u2019s advice in deciding to reclad the Fa\u00e7ade.', '159\\u2003On 28 August 2012, Millenia commenced this action against Dragages, Builders Shop and Meinhardt Singapore. 270', 'After Meinhardt Singapore filed its defence, Millenia added Meinhardt Fa\u00e7ade as a defendant to the suit. 271', '160\\u2003On or about 10 October 2012, Arup completed its inspection of the Cladding. 272', '161\\u2003On or about 15 November 2012, Cementone completed its restraining works. 273', 'According to the 100% Inspection Reports, 630 panels which were in immediate danger of falling were restrained.

It is important to note, however, that in stating this opinion, Arup was replying to a query about the safety of the Fa\u00e7ade in the immediate future (see [162(c)] above). The statement in the 4 December 2012 Draft that the Fa\u00e7ade was \u201csafe\u201d must be read in this context: I do not understand it to be a statement that the Fa\u00e7ade was safe for its design life. This could not have been what Arup meant given their earlier advice in the 8 August 2012 Letter.', '164\\u2003On 7 December 2012, however, after a discussion with Ms Chee, Mr Yap prepared a revised draft of the reply to the BCA (\u201cthe 7 December 2012 Letter\u201d), 277', 'which he sent to the BCA later that day after making a minor edit which is inconsequential. 278', 'The 7 December 2012 Letter differed from the earlier draft in the following ways:', '(a)\\u2003first, the sentence referred to at [163(a)] above was deleted;', '(b)\\u2003secondly, the sentence referred to at [163(b)] above was deleted and replaced with the following: \u201cWe will not comment on the follow up action of the panels which have not been restrained since Millenia is considering carrying out a replacement of the stone fa\u00e7ade\u201d; and', '(c)\\u2003thirdly, the words \u201csafe and\u201d were deleted from the sentence referred to at [163(c)] above, such that the sentence states that \u201cpanels both restrained and not restrained and in their original condition are not in immediate danger of falling\u201d [emphasis added].', '165\\u2003During oral submissions, Mr Ho submitted that (1) Millenia decided to reclad the Building in late 2012 and (2) this decision was not made for safety reasons.

As I have noted, Dragages did not plead this claim and I have found that Millenia decided to reclad the Fa\u00e7ade for safety reasons (see [157]\u2013[158] above). It is important to note that if the decision to reclad was made in late 2012, as Mr Ho submitted, it was taken after the 8 August 2012 Letter where Arup recommended a reclad for safety reasons (see [156] above).', '(b)\\u2003Secondly, I also do not accept Dragages\u2019 allegations regarding Ms Chee\u2019s motives for the changes she (may have) suggested to the 4 December 2012 Draft.

In particular, Mr Ho did not suggest that Ms Chee had caused Arup to change the wording for Millenia\u2019s purposes. 280', 'In the circumstances, I do not accept that Mr Ho is entitled to raise this allegation against Ms Chee in submissions. Further, as I have explained (see [163(c)] above), I do not understand Arup to have been stating in the 4 December 2012 Draft anything more than that the Fa\u00e7ade was safe in the short term.

He stated that KK Asia expected to commence operations in Malaysia by 1 March 2015. Robin requested that all purchases of KK Asia thenceforth should be shipped to Malaysia. By a subsequent email dated 21 January 2015, KK Asia instructed Forest Fibers to change the pending shipment\u2019s destination port to Malaysia (Port Klang) from Singapore and the consignee\u2019s name from KK Asia to Teguh Jaya Polymer Sdn Bhd (\u201cTeguh Jaya\u201d). Forest Fibers acceded to the request.

Robin informed Domenico that KK Asia did not have sufficient funds to open letters of credit and requested for credit terms which Domenico refused. However, by then, the shipments were on-route to Malaysia. 5', '9\\u2003Robin then proposed a different arrangement to Domenico.

Instead, Domenico was told by Robin that KK Asia was using a company called Teguh Jaya (see [7]) to process the raw materials shipped by Forest Fibers. Domenico subsequently ascertained from Robin that the import of raw waste material into Malaysia required a particular import licence which KK Asia did not but Teguh Jaya possessed.

Their agreement is reflected in clause 3.5 of the SSA at [25(c)] below.', '14\\u2003The Lohs\u2019 guarantee in clause 3.5 was reinforced by clause 3.7 of the SSA which states: 11', '17\\u2003The revised PFA dated 8 May 2015 superseded the first PFA and contained the following terms in addition to those terms listed in [11] above:', '(a)\\u2003Domenico would guarantee Forest Fibers\u2019 obligations whilst Robin would guarantee the obligations of KK Asia (clause 16);', '(b)\\u2003Forest Fibers would be paid first by KK Asia for inventory that was over 90 days in Forest Fibers\u2019 inventory system (clause 14);', '(c)\\u2003Forest Fibers would be reimbursed US$80.00 per m\/t for import duty from the sale proceeds of the finished product (clause 14);', '(d)\\u2003Either party could terminate the agreement upon giving 90 days\u2019 notice to the other (clause 19); and', '(e)\\u2003Any excess sale proceeds would be considered profits and would be shared equally between Forest Fibers and KK Asia (clause 15).', '18\\u2003Domenico met Robin in Malaysia in mid-May 2015 and was introduced by the latter to Robert Chai (\u2018Chai\u201d) purportedly the boss of Teguh Jaya. Robin and Domenico then flew to Qingdao in China to meet a buyer of KK Asia. 15', '19\\u2003Pursuant to the revised PFA, Forest Fibers shipped 2,611.038 m\/t of raw waste materials to KK Asia but it did not receive by end May\/early June 2015 the finished goods produced from the raw waste materials shipped between February and March 2015. In fact, despite the large quantities of raw materials shipped by Forest Fibers, KK Asia failed to produce any finished products. When Domenico queried Robin, the excuses given were problems with machinery and factory installation. 16', '20\\u2003Domenico suggested to Robin that a factory or floor manager be employed; Robin agreed and one Danny Lim was employed in June 2015. However, Danny Lim resigned after just 3 weeks. When Domenico queried him, Danny Lim informed Domenico that KK Asia\u2019s processing operation was disorganised, it lacked a proper inventory and output tracking system, Peter was not actively involved in the Malaysian operations while Robin was hardly in the factory. 17', '21\\u2003In addition, Domenico was aware that KK Asia continued to face cash flow problems. KK Asia was supposed to but failed to pay import duties at US$80 per m\/t. Robin had contacted Domenico on two occasions to request that Forest Fibers advance import duties payments to enable KK Asia to clear the shipments through customs. Domenico agreed and Forest Fibers remitted US$39,033.20, US$29,859.48 and US$59,165.92 to KK Asia to pay import duties. These payments totalled US$128,058.60. 18', '22\\u2003Finding the situation untenable, Domenico flew to Singapore in early July 2015 to meet the Lohs. They told him they had no cash, did not want to continue the business and told him Forest Fibers should take over KK Asia. Domenico was faced with a difficult situation. Forest Fibers had already paid substantial sums as well as supplied large quantities of raw material to KK Asia without receiving any finished goods in return. If the Lohs walked away, Forest Fibers would lose everything. 19', '23\\u2003Domenico decided he would try to salvage the situation by becoming a shareholder of KK Asia. Although the Lohs wanted him to buy over the entire company, Domenico was only prepared to buy over 50% of KK Asia. The Lohs asked what Domenico considered to be a ridiculous sum of US$2m for their shares which offer Domenico promptly rejected. Eventually the parties agreed on a consideration of US$200,000 (\u201cthe purchase price\u201d) for Forest Fibers\u2019 purchase of 50% of the issued shares in KK Asia (\u201cthe shares\u201d). In exchange, Domenico wanted an option (to which the Lohs agreed) that Forest Fibers could sell back the shares to the Lohs at the same price with interest if KK Asia did not turn in a profit within a certain timeline. Instead of Forest Fibers, Domenico decided to use a related company namely RGA to be the purchaser of the shares. 20', '24\\u2003The parties appointed solicitors to prepare the share sale agreement and that was how the SSA came into being on 9 July 2015 with the Lohs as the vendors and RGA as the purchaser of the shares.', '25\\u2003The salient terms of the SSA set out in clause 3 are the following: 21', '(a)\\u2003RGA had the option to sell back the shares to the Lohs at the purchase price plus interest at 5% per annum in the event that KK Asia failed to generate net profits (before tax) of US$200,000 within 10 months from the date of the agreement, namely 31 May 2016 (clause 3.3);', '(b)\\u2003RGA undertook to extend to the Lohs on or before 1 October 2016 a loan of up to US$30,000 to finance KK Asia (clause 3.4);', '(c)\\u2003The Lohs acknowledged that KK Asia was indebted to RGA for a sum of US$120,000 being a previous loan extended by RGA to KK Asia. The Lohs jointly and severally undertook that in the event KK Asia failed to full repay the said sum of US$120,000 plus interest at 5% per annum to RGA by 30 December 2016, they would pay 50% of the said US$120,000 while RGA would waive the balance 50% (clause 3.5);', '(d)\\u2003The parties acknowledged that there was a rolling account of accounts payable by KK Asia to Forest Fibers. In the event that KK Asia was unable to pay such outstanding sums which were overdue, the Lohs undertook to pay 50% of the said overdue sums which were outstanding and RGA undertook to pay the balance 50% to Forest Fibers (clause 3.6); and', '(e)\\u2003The Lohs gave their undertakings (clause 3.7 at [14] above).', '26\\u2003Due to a mistake on the part of the company secretary of KK Asia, Domenico was wrongly registered as the 50% shareholder of KK Asia instead of RGA. In his affidavit of evidence-in-chief (\u201cAEIC\u201d), Domenico declared he held the shares on trust for RGA, which paid for the shares on 15 July 2016 by wire transfer. 22', '27\\u2003Between April 2015 and May 2015, Forest Fibers remitted to KK Asia three sums totalling US$119,578.05 in payment of KK Asia\u2019s invoices for raw waste materials purchased by Forest Fibers. However, despite being paid, KK Asia failed to deliver the raw waste materials.', '28\\u2003On or about 17 June 2015, Robin and Domenico agreed to convert Forest Fibers\u2019 payments into loans from RGA to KK Asia. On or about 15 July 2015. RGA remitted US$30,000.00 to KK Asia as the agreed loan under clause 3.4 of the SSA. By that date, RGA\u2019s loans to KK Asia totalled US$149,578.05 as shown in the breakdown below: 23', '29\\u2003Despite the SSA, payment of the purchase price as well as the above loans from RGA, KK Asia continued to be plagued by operational and cash flow problems. It was unable to process or deliver finished products to Forest Fibers.', '30\\u2003In August 2015, Domenico arranged for a Forest Fibers\u2019 employee, a Colombian national called Luis Pernett Rojas (\u201cLuis\u201d) to go to Malaysia to run and operate KK Asia\u2019s Malaysian factory. 24', 'Luis reported back to Domenico that there were very little raw materials or finished products at the factory of KK Asia and that raw materials as well as finished products were being held at the warehouse of Teguh Jaya. Luis further reported that 39 containers of raw waste materials supplied to KK Asia were held up at the Malaysian port as Teguh Jaya and its associate company JMC Logistics (\u2018JMC\u201d) refused to release them. Teguh Jaya and JMC apparently told Luis that KK Asia was owing them monies for customs duties, demurrage, clearance fees and other charges and they would not release the containers until they were paid. 25', '31\\u2003Domenico wrote to Teguh Jaya on 25 August 2015 to inform the latter of the change in ownership and operations at KK Asia enclosing a copy of the SSA with his letter. 26', 'Domenico realised the revised PFA was not workable. He focussed instead on minimising the losses of the plaintiffs. In his AEIC, he deposed that his requests to the Lohs for assistance were met with excuses and lies. 27', '32\\u2003Worse, without Domenico\u2019s consent or knowledge, the Lohs sent a notice to Teguh Jaya and Ever Classic Plastic Industries Sdn Bhd (\u201cEver Classic\u201d) another company belonging to Chai, announcing the immediate closure of KK Asia\u2019s factory due to lack of materials. 28', 'Effectively, the Lohs had abandoned KK Asia leaving Domenico to run the company\u2019s operations.', '33\\u2003On 1 September 2015, Peter informed Domenico that he would no longer be putting money into KK Asia and would be closing the company\u2019s Singapore office. Peter even asked Domenico to pay the loan instalments of KK Asia due to Standard Chartered Bank (\u201cSCB\u201d). Domenico\u2019s emails to the Lohs in September 2015 on the 39 missing containers of raw materials and finished products as reported to him by Luis met with no response. 29', '34\\u2003In anticipation of RGA\u2019s claims against KK Asia, and mindful that the latter had other creditors, Domenico instructed his lawyers to, and they did, lodge caveats on the Properties (\u201cthe Caveats\u201d) on behalf of RGA on 21 September 2015: see RGA Holdings International Inc v Loh Choon Phing Robin and another [2017] 2 SLR 997 (\u201cRGA Holdings International\u201d) at [12].', '35\\u2003Between August and September 2015, Domenico arranged for Forest Fibers and\/or RGA to make advances totalling US$59,488.38 to KK Asia and\/or to third parties on behalf of KK Asia. The breakdown for the payments is shown in the table below: 30', '', '36\\u2003In September 2015, Domenico contacted one Eddie from JMC and Chai of Teguh Jaya and negotiated with them for the release of the detained 39 containers in exchange for payment of US$43,600 to cover terminal handling, forwarding and other charged purportedly owed by KK Asia to Teguh Jaya and JMC. 31', 'Forest Fibers remitted the said sum to Teguh Jaya on or about 10 September 2015. Despite the remittance, Eddie and Chai reneged on their agreement with Domenico and transported the 39 containers to their warehouse instead. 32', '37\\u2003Domenico subsequently discovered that Robin had deliberately obstructed Forest Fibers\u2019 efforts to recover the goods retained by Teguh Jaya by his letter to Teguh Jaya dated 21 September 2015, inquiring about the status of the 39 containers and stating (untruthfully) that all the containers had been purchased by KK Asia from Forest Fibers. 33', 'On the same day, Robin wrote separately to Teguh Jaya stating KK Asia had received 154 containers all of which had been purchased from Forest Fibers. 34', '38\\u2003As KK Asia failed to pay Forest Fibers for inventory and\/or waste materials supplied or to return the same, the solicitors of Forest Fibers demanded payment of US$188,038.89 from KK Asia on 13 October 2015. 35', 'In a separate letter of the same date, the solicitors demanded the return of Forest Fibers\u2019 raw materials of 2,390.67 m\/t worth US$617,713.41. 36', '39\\u2003On 20 October 2015, Robin acknowledged the claim of US$188,038.89 but denied Forest Fibers\u2019 other claim of US$617,713.41 for various reasons. Of the US$617,713.41, Robin admitted owing a lesser sum of US$317,166.98 alleging that some containers of raw materials had been sold to Teguh Jaya. 37', 'He added that Forest Fibers owed KK Asia in excess of US$3,000.00. He claimed that KK Asia had delivered finished products to Ever Classic in June 2015. 38', 'However, Domenico deposed in his subsequent AEIC that Forest Fibers never received payment from Ever Classic for the 52 m\/t of goods purportedly delivered to the latter. Domenico estimated that 52 m\/t of finished products meant in effect that 73 m\/t of raw material had been used. However, Forest Fibers had delivered about 2,611.09 m\/t of raw materials to KK Asia. 39', '40\\u2003In an effort to recover Forest Fibers\u2019 claims, Domenico instructed Malaysian lawyers to commence proceedings against Teguh Jaya (and Ever Classic) in November 2015 to recover its raw materials and finished goods. An injunction was obtained against Teguh Jaya on 22 March 2016. 40', 'However, Forest Fibers\u2019 action was subsequently dismissed by the Malaysian Court of Appeal on the basis that it may obtain double recovery depending on the outcome of these Singapore proceedings. 41', '41\\u2003On 15 February 2016, RGA\u2019s lawyers demanded the sum of US$74,789.02 from the Lohs pursuant to clause 3.5 of the SSA, being 50% of the total loans of US$149,578.05 extended to KK Asia, excluding interest at 5% per annum.

The trial was heard before District Judge Shawn Ho (\u201cthe District Judge\u201d). The Respondent\u2019s client was charged with intentionally brushing his forearm against the victim\u2019s breasts whilst both of them were in a train.', '6\\u2003On 3 August 2015, the Respondent cross-examined the victim on her testimony regarding the alleged offence. In the course of doing so, the Respondent pressed the victim on whether she thought she was attractive and even suggested that he thought she was. During the same line of questioning, he required the victim to stand up and subjected her to physical scrutiny. When the victim asked if this was necessary and said that she was offended by it, he told her that he would be asking her even more insulting questions. The District Judge then intervened to find out what the point of the cross-examination was. It emerged that the Respondent was trying to mount a case that the victim was unattractive such that his client would not have been motivated to outrage her modesty and any contact that took place was accidental. The Prosecution subsequently objected to any questioning which was indecent or scandalous or intended to insult or annoy, but the Respondent maintained that his questions were relevant to the facts in issue.', '7\\u2003A year later, on 3 August 2016, both sets of counsel appeared before the District Judge again for oral closing submissions. The District Judge gave the Respondent another opportunity to explain why he had conducted his cross-examination in such a manner by staring at the victim\u2019s breasts and asking about her physical appearance. The Respondent reiterated that he was trying to see if it could be inferred from the victim\u2019s appearance that anybody would molest her.

Rather, it appeared to be intended to insult or annoy the victim and was needlessly offensive in form.', '9\\u2003On 8 August 2016, the Attorney-General\u2019s Chambers lodged a complaint against the Respondent with the Law Society.

{"casename":"2018_SGHC_198","fact":"the facts,  and the greater  the carelessness the more \nresponsibility he has to bear. Low level  carelessness  may include simple absent-\nmindedness or momentary inattention  though this also depends on the activity \nin question. Recklessness will form  the higher  levels  of contributory negligence,  \nand this includes cases where pedestrians  injure themselves when they dash \nacross a road without looking, giving the motorist only a small chance of \navoiding the accident.  The degree of contributory  negligence at the reckless \nlevel depends  on the actor and the act, of course, but sometimes the \ncircumstances may also ameliorate  or aggravate  the liability  of the  parties.  \n12 In this case, the defendant had bought the machine as it was, making no \nalteration or modification to it. If an accident had happened because of an \nunauthorised modification to a machinery, the employer  who had modified  it \nhas to bear a greater responsibility  for any accident that is attributed  to that \nmodification. The case before me is slightly different. The accusation here is \nthat the defendant ought to have modified  the machinery to make it safer. We \ncan see at once how that complicates the apportionment of the defendant\u2019s \nresponsibility. The defendant bought the machine from  an established \nmanufacturer. Were it to modify the machine, it runs the risk of imposing a \ngreater responsibility should the modification  cause problems in the use of the \nmachine, and ultimately, accidents. \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nAlam Jahangir v  Mega Metal Pte Ltd [2018]  SGHC  198\n613 The evidence before me indicates  that, as it was, an open, unprotected \nrolling machine such as the defendant\u2019s was a source of danger for careless \nemployees, and some protective grating  was probably  needed. The \nmanufacturer was not joined as a third party so we do not have its views as to \nwhy there was no factory fitted grating,  and no further apportionment  can be \nmade so as to split the liability  between  the employer and the manufacturer. \nThat leaves us with the conduct of the plaintiff.  He was an experienced worker  \nand was also a trainer  of new workers on the use of the machine in question. He \nknew that should there  be any need to stop the machine, the switch is close at \nhand, just about an arms-length  away. When  he found  a metal can stuck in the \nrollers, he did not stop the machine. Instead,  he stuck his hand between the \nrunning rollers in an effort to dislodge the can. This was an act of negligence  \nbordering on recklessness. \n14 Finally, the defendant\u2019s counterclaim for reimbursement of medical  \nexpenses and medical leave wages that it has paid so far to the plaintiff is \npremised on the plaintiff failing to prove  that the defendant was liable. I dismiss \nthe counterclaim as my decision to apportion damages between the plaintiff and \nthe defendant will account  for that. The defendant is thus liable for only 50% of \nthe medical expenses and medical leave wages.  To the extent that the defendant \nhas paid more than that, the excess  will be set off against  the general damages  \nto be recovered  by the plaintiff.  To allow the counterclaim in full is to give the \ndefendant double  recovery. As a result of the apportionment of damages,  the \ndefendant will be able to recover  50% of the medical expenses  and medical  \nleave wages it had paid,  or have  it set-off against its outstanding liability to the \nplaintiff. \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nAlam Jahangir v  Mega Metal Pte Ltd [2018]  SGHC  198\n715 I will hear the parties on costs after the assessment of damages.

{"casename":"2018_SGHC_20","fact":"'8\\u2003The key background facts behind the substantive dispute are set out at [10]\u2013[48] of the Substantive Judgment. For present purposes, it is sufficient to summarise the relationship between Sandipala, Paulus and Catherine. Sandipala is an Indonesian company that was incorporated in 1987. On or about 19 January 2011, Paulus purchased majority shares in Sandipala. Most of the purchased shares were placed under the name of his wife, Rawung. Paulus injected considerable capital into Sandipala. As at 4 March 2011, Sandipala\u2019s management board consisted of Paulus (President Director), his daughter Catherine (Director), Pauline Tannos (Director) and Rawung (President Commissioner).', '9\\u2003In or around June 2011, the Indonesian Government awarded a very substantial contract for the production and supply personalised electronic identification cards to a consortium of companies, of which Sandipala was a member. In brief, within the consortium, Sandipala was to produce and personalise large quantities of electronic identification cards in accordance with the tender award. To this end, Sandipala entered into an agreement with Oxel for some 100 million electronic chips encoded with a particular operating system (\u201cthe Oxel Contract\u201d). These electronic chips were in turn sourced from and produced by the STMicroelectronics Group of companies, of which ST-AP is a member. The third defendant in the Substantive Proceedings, Vincent Pierre Luc Cousin (\u201cCousin\u201d), is an employee of ST-AP.', '10\\u2003Oxel is a Singapore company in the business of supplying electronic chips and had licensing rights to sell a software suite known as \u201cPAC\u201d. Disputes arose when Sandipala \u201cdiscovered\u201d that the electronic chips ordered and supplied could not be used for the personalised electronic identification card project that had been awarded. It is sufficient to note that there was a considerable dispute as to why the chips supplied could not be used and who was responsible. It was in this context that Sandipala brought the Substantive Proceedings against ST-AP and Oxel. The substantive claim was dismissed. Oxel succeeded in the counterclaim against Sandipala under the Oxel contract. Oxel also succeeded in the claim against Paulus and Catherine for conspiring through unlawful means to cause Sandipala to breach the Oxel contract.', '11\\u2003It is convenient to set out a timeline of the key events post-delivery of the substantive judgment which culminated in Oxel\u2019s application for an order of committal against Paulus and Catherine. To be clear, the timeline set out below does not include certain proceedings taken out by ST-AP and Cousin against Sandipala concerning an anti-suit injunction. These will be briefly touched on later.', '12\\u2003It will be noted that a different set of committal proceedings had been brought by ST-AP and Cousin in respect of Paulus and Catherine\u2019s alleged breaches of an anti-suit injunction. I will briefly set out the related procedural history here.', '13\\u2003On 4 August 2015, an ex parte anti-suit injunction was granted in respect of certain proceedings commenced in Indonesia by Sandipala against ST-NV (the parent company of ST-AP), Cousin and another Indonesian company (Perushaan Umum Percetakan Negara Republik Indonesia) that was a member of the consortium which won the Indonesian tender. A final anti-suit injunction was granted on 4 September 2015. The decision was upheld on appeal on 3 February 2016. By then, leave had been granted on 4 December 2015 for ST-AP and Cousin to commence committal proceedings against Paulus and Catherine for alleged breaches of the anti-suit injunction.', '14\\u2003Given that the Substantive Proceedings were due to commence on 14 March 2016, the committal proceedings were adjourned to after the Substantive Proceedings. On 22 May 2017 (after delivery of the Substantive Judgment), the EJD hearing for the costs of the anti-suit injunction was adjourned as Paulus and Catherine were outside Singapore. On 12 June 2017, Paulus attended the EJD hearing for costs arising from the anti-suit injunction application. The Assistant Registrar (\u201cAR\u201d) directed Paulus to translate certain documents and adjourned the matter to 24 July 2017.', '15\\u2003On 24 July 2017, Paulus was absent from the EJD hearing. Paulus\u2019s counsel informed the AR that Paulus was in the United States on account of his daughter\u2019s mental breakdown. The EJD hearing was adjourned to 25 August 2017.', '16\\u2003Paulus failed to attend the EJD hearing of 25 August 2017. Paulus\u2019s counsel informed the AR that Paulus was away in China for an urgent meeting. Counsel for ST-AP informed the AR that Paulus had not furnished any answers to the EJD questionnaire. The AR granted a suspension of the EJD order in anticipation of the committal proceedings.', '17\\u2003Subsequently on 6 September 2017, a settlement regarding the committal proceedings was reached between Sandipala and ST-AP and Cousin. The committal proceedings for the alleged breaches of the anti-suit injunction were vacated.', '18\\u2003Whilst Oxel did not in the present proceedings refer to the matter of the anti-suit injunction and the EJD proceedings brought by ST-AP and Cousin, its statement dated 31 October 2017 pursuant to O 52 r 2(2) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) made reference to the position taken by Paulus and Catherine in those EJD proceedings. Oxel\u2019s statement noted (at para 50) that Paulus and Catherine had asserted by affidavit in those EJD proceedings that they had been declared bankrupt in Indonesia and were disqualified from acting as directors for Sandipala. That said, I note that in the present EJD proceedings brought by Oxel, neither Paulus nor Catherine filed any affidavit or response until late in the day. Catherine filed an affidavit on 27 November 2017, followed by Paulus on 6 December 2017 after leave had been granted to Oxel to commence the present committal proceedings. Similar points were made in these affidavits on the Indonesian bankruptcy. Nothing was said, however, of Catherine\u2019s purported medical or mental health issues that were raised by counsel at the 24 July 2017 EJD hearing in the proceedings by ST-AP and Cousin.', '19\\u2003Paulus and Catherine took the position that the key reason why they were unable to respond to the EJD Questionnaires and attend the EJD hearings to answer questions on Sandipala\u2019s assets and their personal assets and income is that they were made bankrupt in Indonesia on 22 February 2017. This was after the trial in the Substantive Proceedings but before the Substantive Judgment was delivered on 12 May 2017. 2', 'The bankruptcy proceedings are said to arise out of, inter alia, personal guarantees they had provided for loans taken out in Indonesia by PT Megalestari Unggul from Bank Artha Graha. Paulus and Catherine\u2019s position is that the bankruptcy order was wrongly made and that the bankruptcy proceedings were brought as part of a conspiracy between Oxel and others to harass Paulus and his family. 3', 'It appears that an application for judicial review has been made to the Supreme Court of Indonesia.', '20\\u2003Paulus and Catherine asserted, in brief, that as a result of the bankruptcy order, they were (i) disqualified from acting or speaking for Sandipala; (ii) unable to gain access to or provide copies of relevant documents of Sandipala and (iii) unable to attend the EJD hearings in Singapore to answer questions on their assets and income or respond to the EJD questionnaires as this would (or may) have amounted to an interference with the Indonesian Curator\u2019s control and administration of their assets.', '21\\u2003Paulus and Catherine went on to assert that Oxel, being aware of the bankruptcy proceedings and that Paulus and Catherine were unable under Indonesian law to comply with the EJD Orders, commenced the EJD proceedings for the purpose of harassing them. 4', 'Indeed, at the hearing before me on 12 January 2018, the submission was made that Oxel was well-advised to put in a claim in Indonesia as a judgment creditor to the relevant Indonesian authorities. The assertion was also made from the bar that the Curator in Indonesia had already started disposing of Paulus\u2019s and\/or Catherine\u2019s assets. 5', '22\\u2003Oxel denied the assertion that the bankruptcy proceedings are part of some conspiracy to harass Paulus and his family. Oxel denied any involvement in the bankruptcy proceedings and made the point that prior to the affidavits of Catherine and Paulus Wijya on 27 November 2017 no such suggestion had been raised before in the EJD proceedings in Singapore. 6', 'Oxel asserted that the EJD proceedings were brought simply because its demand for payment of the judgment debt had been ignored by Paulus, Catherine and Sandipala. Oxel also made the point that the fact of bankruptcy in Indonesia (which they did not in any case accept) did not prevent Paulus and Catherine from attending the EJD hearings in Singapore and responding to the EJD Questionnaires. This is a point which I shall return to later in these Grounds of Decision.', '23\\u2003It will be recalled that on 27 November 2017, Paulus and Catherine responded to the EJD Questionnaires which they hitherto had refused to make any response. The EJD Questionnaires required the production of documents including bank statements (local and overseas) for the past five years, payslips for the past five years, income tax returns for the past five years, statements from the Central Depository, securities brokers and fund managers in respect of shares, bonds and unit trusts (local and overseas) for the past five years, and so on. The EJD Questionnaires included a notice that a failure to attend the hearing without consent may result in committal proceedings and that the penalty may be a fine or imprisonment.', '24\\u2003The specific questions asked in the EJD Questionnaires included those relating to monthly income, immovable property whether in Singapore or elsewhere, motor vehicles owned in Singapore or elsewhere, particulars of bank accounts or safe deposit boxes in Singapore or elsewhere, as well as particulars of other assets whether in Singapore or elsewhere, including insurance policies, shares, antiques, jewellery, funds, etc. The answers provided by Paulus and Catherine were essentially \u201cnone\u201d or \u201cnot applicable.\u201d 7', 'For example, in the case of immovable property the response was \u201cassets in Indonesia confiscated by Curator [who] has taken all my assets including bank account\u201d and \u201cno asset in Singapore or overseas\u201d. As for shares, Paulus stated \u201cshare in [Sandipala] curator in process of confiscating assets\u2026\u201d In the case of Sandipala and whether the company was making trading profits or losses, the answer by Paulus was \u201cdon\u2019t know most likely losses\u201d. Other questions concerning immovable property of Sandipala, bank accounts, etc. were simply answered \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d. Catherine\u2019s answers to the EJD Questionnaires were essentially the same. Questions as to whether Paulus, Catherine and\/or Sandipala had transferred assets since 8 February 2013 were not answered at all. Following a query, Paulus and Catherine responded on 1 December 2016 saying that no assets had been transferred and that no debts were due to them.', '25\\u2003In short, Paulus and Catherine\u2019s position is that they have no assets or bank accounts in Singapore. Whatever assets they had in Indonesia (including bank accounts) has been seized by the Curator. In so far as Sandipala was concerned, their position was that they did not know what the position was, although Paulus thought that Sandipala was making trading losses. No details were provided even though the questions concerned assets over the past five years. The home address provided by Paulus in his answers to the EJD Questionnaires was an address in Singapore. The home address provided by Catherine in her answers was an address in Jakarta.', '26\\u2003At the EJD hearing on 29 December 2017 which Paulus and Catherine attended, no documents were produced. It is undisputed that questions to Paulus about his assets and income were answered in a similar vein as those provided in respect of the EJD Questionnaires. The position taken by Paulus was that he had no assets to his name and no ability to pay for anything including simple day-to-day amenities and food. 8', 'In its submissions, Oxel asserted that during the EJD hearing, Paulus stated that the questions asked amounted to \u201charassment\u201d and made complaints about the costs of attending the EJD hearing in Singapore. 9', 'The matter was adjourned to 20 February 2018. Paulus was ordered to provide the following documents by way of an affidavit to be filed by 12 January 2018:', '27\\u2003On 9 January 2018, Paulus provided the following documents by affidavit:', '28\\u2003As for the other documents ordered to be produced, Paulus stated that he was unable to produce these for the following reasons:', '(a)\\u2003The full list of companies seized by the Curator in Indonesia. He was unable to produce this as the \u201cCurator has not informed [him] or written to [him] about the assets or companies that has been seized\u201d and \u201c[f]urther, the assets do not belong to me or [Catherine] as they belong to the companies.\u201d', '(b)\\u2003The address of the office with the safe deposit box which the Curator seized. As Paulus stated: \u201cI understand that the assets of PT Pakuan belong to the company and do not form part of my personal assets. Therefore, I believe that they are not relevant to this EJD hearing. For the same reason, I believe that the cars owned by PT Pakuan are not relevant to the current proceedings.\u201d In addition, he stated that he did not currently own any cars.', '(c)\\u2003The reply from Bank Mindiri for copies of bank statements. This was not produced as no reply had been received yet.', '29\\u2003I note that in his affidavit of 9 January 2018, Paulus stated that his brothers residing in the United States were paying for all of his and Catherine\u2019s expenses. 11', 'He went on to state that he and Catherine were assisting his brothers in their businesses and that they were staying in the United States with his brothers. 12', 'Paulus raised the costs and expenses of travelling to and from Singapore to attend the EJD hearings. He stated that his brothers were \u201cnot agreeable to fund [his and Catherine\u2019s] expenses for flying to Singapore repeatedly on an indefinite basis.\u201d In this regard, Paulus complained that the \u201cadjournment of the EJD hearing could have been avoided if Oxel\u2019s solicitors properly utilised the time given in the EJD hearing to complete their questioning\u201d. 13', 'He went on to complain at that \u201cOxel\u2019s solicitors did not even ask a single question to [Catherine] in the whole EJD hearing\u201d and that \u201c[a]lthough [Catherine] was present and the Honourable Court was available for the EJD hearing for the whole morning session, Oxel\u2019s solicitors refused to ask any questions to [Catherine].\u201d 14', 'Whilst it appears that the AR had already refused a request for the evidence at the next EJD hearing to be given by video link, Paulus nonetheless repeated the request in his affidavit of 9 January 2018. I note also that Paulus and Catherine complained that Oxel had never offered to meet their travel expenses for the EJD hearings.', '30\\u2003Oxel\u2019s counsel clarified in their oral submissions that the EJD hearing had been adjourned because Paulus and Catherine had not brought any documents and that questioning of Paulus was to resume on 20 February 2018 (a date chosen by him). It was made clear that Catherine would be questioned after Paulus. Whilst the notes of evidence for the EJD hearing on 29 December 2017 were not yet available, I note that counsel for Paulus and Catherine accepted the sequence of events as recounted by counsel for Oxel. 15', '31\\u2003On 12 January 2018, the committal hearing took place. Paulus and Catherine attended the hearing together with their counsel. After hearing Oxel\u2019s submissions, G&C informed the court that Paulus and Catherine wished to make a statement in response to certain points raised by Oxel\u2019s counsel. These points concerned Oxel\u2019s position that Paulus\u2019s companies including Sandipala had successfully bid and won tenders in Indonesia in 2012. It appeared that Paulus\u2019s point was that this did not mean Sandipala was profitable or that he had assets and income that were not being disclosed. Their request to make a statement was rejected, after which their counsel proceeded to present his submissions and arguments on committal. At the conclusion of counsel\u2019s submissions, the court provided an opportunity for counsel to confer with Paulus and Catherine as to whether there was anything else they wanted counsel to raise before the court. 16'"}

After parking, he retrieved a white plastic bag from the Motorcycle and proceeded to the lift of Block 350. He took the lift up to the 17th floor. He met Saridewi on the 17th floor and handed a white plastic bag to her. In return, Saridewi handed him an envelope, with the marking \u201c10.000\u201d on it, to him. The movements of Haikal and Saridewi using the lifts of Block 350 at the material time were captured clearly on the CCTV cameras in the lifts, and this was not disputed when the camera footage was viewed in the course of the trial. 1', 'The two then parted ways; Haikal proceeded back to the Motorcycle while Saridewi went back to the unit where she resided, located at #16-143 of Block 350 (\u201cthe Unit\u201d).', '5\\u2003The CNB had received information of the drug transaction that was to take place at Block 350 that afternoon and various CNB officers were deployed at the vicinity in a covert operation. Shortly after riding off from Block 350 on the Motorcycle, Haikal was intercepted and placed under arrest by CNB officers at the junction of Anchorvale Road and Anchorvale Street. The officers recovered in his possession, inter alia, an envelope with the marking \u201c10.000\u201d on it (later marked as \u201cMHA-1\u201d) found to contain cash totalling SGD$10,050 and a brown envelope (later marked as \u201cMHA-2\u201d) found to contain cash totalling SGD$5,500. Three mobile phones found in his possession were seized and sent to FORT for analysis.', '6\\u2003Meanwhile, CNB officers arrived at the Unit. Saridewi, upon hearing movements and voices outside her door and suspecting the presence of CNB officers, threw various items out of the kitchen window of the Unit. 2', 'Before the CNB officers could cut through her metal grille gate to effect entry, she opened the door to allow the CNB officers to enter the Unit. In the Unit, various exhibits including packets of crystalline substance, numerous glass tubes, a slab of tablets, numerous empty packets and straws, several unused envelopes, one digital weighing scale, one heat sealer, and a notebook were seized. From the construction site adjacent to Block 350, the CNB officers recovered a white \u201cSKP\u201d plastic bag (later marked as \u201cA1\u201d) containing another white \u201cSKP\u201d plastic bag (later marked as \u201cA1A\u201d), which contained two plastic packets (later marked separately as \u201cA1A1\u201d and \u201cA1A2\u201d), each containing one packet of granular\/powdery substance (later marked as \u201cA1A1A\u201d and \u201cA1A2A\u201d respectively). On the ground floor of Block 350, CNB officers recovered, inter alia, two stained packets (later marked as \u201cB1\u201d), some loose brown granular substance (later marked as \u201cC1\u201d), one packet (later marked as \u201cD1\u201d) containing eight packets of crystalline substance (\u201clater marked as \u201cD1A\u201d), one packet containing three packets of granular\/powdery substance (\u201clater collectively marked as \u201cD2A\u201d), one packet containing two white straws and five blue straws each containing granular\/powdery substance (later collectively marked as \u201cD3A\u201d), and one digital weighing scale.

In any case,  I am not satisfied that the underlying issues are so \nfactually or legally  complex that they cannot  be competently handled by local \ncounsel.\n18 At the hearing  of this application, the Applicant tendered several Hong  \nKong authorities which purportedly stand for the proposition that where foreign \ncounsel seeks admission under s 27(4) of the Legal Practitioners  Ordinance \n(Cap 159) (Hong Kong) for the purposes of a case emanating from  arbitration \nproceedings in which he appeared as counsel,  \u201cthe court will readily accede  to \nsuch application\u201d (Re Goddard  QC [2008]  2 HKC 294 at [4]). The Hong Kong  \ncourts term this consideration \u201cthe arbitration factor\u201d and recognise it as being \nindependent of any other factor  including complexity and the availability of \nlocal counsel  (Re Andrew White QC [2005] HKCU 1019 at [12]; Re Robert Alun \nJones QC [2008] HKCU 2035 at [10]).  The plaintiff  in OS 375 relies upon this \nas justification for why it has not made  any attempts to find local counsel to \nrepresent it in OS 375, arguing that only the Applicant would be able to provide \nit with  the benefit of continuity of representation.\n19 The Hong Kong cases cited by the Applicant must be treated  with great \ncaution in light of the appreciable differences between the Singapore and Hong  \nKong regimes for ad hoc admissions. Hong Kong legislation does not prescribe  \nany guidelines  equivalent to the Notification  Matters and the cases recognise \nthe open-textured criterion of the public interest as \u201cthe paramount if not the \nsole consideration in the exercise of the court\u2019s discretion\u201d (Re Flesch QC and \nanother [1999] HKCU 1638  (\u201cRe Flesch \u201d).

{"casename":"2018_SGHC_21","fact":"'4\\u2003The facts in support of the charges were essentially undisputed, and are summarised below.', '5\\u2003The Respondent is an advocate and solicitor who was admitted to the bar on 21 March 1998. At all material times, he was the sole proprietor of the law practice, M\/s C H Chan & Co, which was located at Chinatown Point. This was also where the Respondent last practiced. For some time, the Respondent shared his office premises with someone named Peter Dornan (\u201cDornan\u201d) who was then running a Human Resources training company.', '6\\u2003In or around late 2005, Dornan introduced the Respondent to an acquaintance who went by the name of Sir Robert Cowley (\u201cCowley\u201d). The Respondent subsequently met Cowley at several dinners and developed a relationship with him. According to the Respondent, Cowley carried himself well. He was referred to by the title \u201cSir\u201d by those around him. During one of those dinners, a former Australian tennis star, Pat Cash, was also present and this impressed the Respondent. Cowley paid for the expensive meal.', '7\\u2003In June 2006, Cowley represented to the Respondent that two companies, of which he was the Chairman, were in need of certain legal services. The companies were the Institute of Business Management and Financial Services (\u201cIBMFS\u201d) and Investment Suisse SA (\u201cISSA\u201d). The nature of the legal services was allegedly twofold: (a) to give advice on Singapore law and investment opportunities; and (b) to act as an escrow agent. As an escrow agent, the Respondent was to receive funds into his client accounts and then carry out onward transmissions of funds as directed by Cowley, IBMFS or ISSA.', '8\\u2003The date on which the Respondent first started handling money for Cowley, IBMFS and\/or ISSA is not known. The earliest transactions documented in the complaint were dated mid-2008. Given Cowley\u2019s apparent social standing, the Respondent was satisfied as to his identity and did not think it necessary to carry out any further background checks. In any event, instructions for the transfer of moneys in and out of the Respondent\u2019s client accounts came from someone he knew as Mr James Serry, who claimed to be the Treasurer of IBMFS, and another person he knew as Mr Paul Scribner (\u201cScribner\u201d), who claimed to be the Chief Executive Officer of ISSA.', '9\\u2003Between May and August 2008, IBMFS instructed the Respondent to receive money which it would remit to him and to transfer the said money on IBMFS\u2019s directions. Before accepting instructions from IBMFS, the Respondent did not take any measures to ascertain the identities of the natural persons who had a controlling interest in or who exercised effective control over the corporate entity. This omission formed the subject of the first charge. The Respondent proceeded to act for IBMFS as instructed in the transfers of substantial sums of money, which were unusual in the ordinary course of business. When accepting the said instructions, the Respondent also failed to obtain satisfactory evidence as to the nature and purpose of the business relationship with IBMFS in the matter and the business relationship between IBMFS and any other party to the matter. This course of action formed the subject of the third charge.', '10\\u2003A similar series of events occurred in relation to ISSA between October and November 2011, and they form the subject of the second and fourth disciplinary charges.', '11\\u2003All in all, sums totalling AUD55,000, \u20ac30,000 and nearly US$2m were transferred by the Respondent in 2008 and 2011. According to the Respondent, he believed that the funds which he was handling as a fiduciary were remittances for work done by Cowley or by overseas solicitors for IBMFS and ISSA.', '12\\u2003For his services, the Respondent was authorised to deduct a fixed amount from the outgoing transfers of funds as his legal fees. In June 2008, he was entitled to a fixed rate of 5% of the transferred funds. It is not known what the rate was in 2011. Based on the documentary evidence provided, it was also unclear whether this fixed fee was agreed upon for only certain transactions or for all of the transactions which formed the subject of the charges preferred against the Respondent. The Respondent subsequently confirmed, but only at the hearing before us, that the revenue he had received from the transactions in 2011 would have been in the order of US$90,000.', '13\\u2003On 4 November 2011, the Respondent sent Scribner an e-mail in which he quoted the following question posed to him by his banker: \u201cMr Chan, why must your client [ie, ISSA] send funds to you for your onward transmission when surely they can do it from their account directly?\u201d', '14\\u2003The Respondent then proceeded to ask Scribner for a response to the above question by stating as follows:', '15\\u2003The Respondent never received an answer to this query.

The Notes were issued under Swiber\u2019s $1,000,000,000 Multicurrency Debt Issuance Programme, and comprised:', '4\\u2003Swiber issued the Notes under a global custodian arrangement. Under such a structure, one or more notes representing the entire principal amount of a series are placed with a common depository (under the Classical Global Note (\u201cCGN\u201d) structure) or a nominee for a clearing system (under the New Global Note structure): see Colin Bamford, Principles of International Financial Law (Oxford University Press, 2011) at paras 6.58 and 6.69. Here, the Notes were issued under the CGN structure: they were placed with a depository, the Central Depository (Pte) Ltd (\u201cthe CDP\u201d). I will thus refer only to the CGN structure in this paragraph. The structure has the following notable features:', '(a)\\u2003First, the issuer makes a covenant to pay that is typically either expressed in favour of the \u201cholder\u201d of the notes or a trustee where the notes are constituted by a trust deed: see Jennifer Payne, Schemes of Arrangement: Theory, Structure and Operation (Cambridge University Press, 2014) (\u201cPayne\u201d) at p 185. Where a trustee is involved, the trustee holds the covenant to pay on trust for the noteholders.', '(b)\\u2003Second, the depository that holds the global note(s) holds the note(s) for one or more clearing systems. The clearing systems hold their interests on trust for persons who hold accounts with the clearing systems. These account holders hold the beneficial interest in the notes on their own account, or for clients who are either the ultimate beneficial owners or intermediaries holding their interests for the ultimate beneficial owners. Here, although the Deed also referred to Euroclear Bank SA\/NV (\u201cEuroclear\u201d) and Clearstream Banking SA (\u201cClearstream\u201d), the clearing system appeared to be the CDP.', '5\\u2003Under cl 2.3 of the Deed, Swiber covenanted to pay the redemption monies of the securities it issued under the Deed \u201cto or to the order of or for the account of the Trustee\u201d. In other words, Swiber\u2019s obligation to make payment in respect of the Notes was owed to the trustee, ie, BMT. Under cl 2.3, BMT was to \u201chold the benefit of this covenant on trust for the Securityholders and Couponholders of the relevant Series\u201d. The term \u201cSecurityholders\u201d was defined under cl 1.1 to refer to \u201cthe Noteholders and the Perpetual Securityholders\u201d. I note here that Swiber only issued \u201cNotes\u201d as defined under the Deed, and hence only the provisions pertaining to \u201cNotes\u201d were material in this application.', '6\\u2003Clause 1.1 of the Deed defined \u201cNoteholders\u201d by reference to the Terms and Conditions of the Notes in Schedule 1, Part III of the Deed (\u201cthe Note Conditions\u201d). Clause 1.1(b)(iii) of the Note Conditions defined a \u201cNoteholder\u201d as the bearer of any Bearer Note or the person in whose name a Registered Note was registered in the Register. The \u201cRegister\u201d was defined under cl 1.1(b)(i) of the Note Conditions to refer to the register kept by the \u201cRegistrar\u201d, Citicorp Investment Bank (Singapore) Limited (\u201cCiticorp\u201d). Clause 1.1(b)(ii) further provided that where the notes were represented by a Global Security or a Global Certificate held by a common depository for Euroclear, Clearstream or the CDP, as was the case here with CDP being that depository, the \u201cNoteholder\u201d would be \u201cthe bearer of the Global Security or \u2026 the person whose name is show[n] on the Register\u201d. Accordingly, the Noteholders referred to CDP or the persons whose names were registered in the register maintained by Citicorp.', '7\\u2003Clause 8 of the Deed provided that as a general rule, only the Trustee, ie, BMT, was entitled to enforce Swiber\u2019s obligations under the Notes, unless certain contingencies arose. Clause 8 stated:', '8\\u2003In short, cl 8.1(a) of the Deed vested BMT, as the trustee, with the right to institute proceedings against Swiber to enforce Swiber\u2019s obligations pertaining to the Notes. Under cl 8.1(b), BMT would only be bound to take steps to enforce Swiber\u2019s obligations if it was directed by holders of not less than 25% of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes or an extraordinary resolution to do so, and indemnified to its satisfaction by the Noteholders for its associated costs and expenses. Notably, cl 8.1(b) provided for BMT to be indemnified by the Noteholders, not Swiber, for its costs in enforcing Swiber\u2019s duties in relation to the Notes upon an event of default. Clause 8.1(c) made clear that BMT alone was entitled to enforce Swiber\u2019s obligations pertaining to the Notes, unless BMT, having been bound to take steps to enforce Swiber\u2019s obligations, failed to do so within a reasonable period and such failure or neglect was continuing.', '9\\u2003The Deed also entitled the Noteholders to elect to obtain direct rights against Swiber (\u201cthe Direct Rights\u201d) upon an event of default. Schedules 2, 3 and 4 of the Deed set out the Forms of Temporary Global Security, Permanent Global Security and Global Certificates for the Notes. All of the Forms included the following provision (with minor variations):', 'In other words, upon an event of default, BMT would be entitled to declare the relevant notes due and payable by issuing a default notice. The Noteholders would then be entitled to elect for the Direct Rights against Swiber in respect of a principal amount of the Notes.', '10\\u2003Finally, cl 16 of the Deed provided for Swiber to remunerate BMT for its services. Clause 16.1 imposed a general obligation on Swiber to pay BMT for its ordinary services as the trustee, with the sum to be agreed by the parties. Clause 16.2 dealt specifically with the case of an event of default or potential event of default, stating that after such an event, Swiber was required to pay BMT \u201csuch additional remuneration as may be agreed between them\u201d.', '11\\u2003On 29 July 2016, Swiber applied by Originating Summons No 767 of 2016 (\u201cOS 767\u201d) to be placed under judicial management, and issued an announcement in relation to the same.', '12\\u2003On 16 September 2016, Swiber announced that it would be defaulting on an upcoming coupon payment for the Series 17 Notes.', '13\\u2003On 6 October 2016, I ordered that Swiber be placed under judicial management. On the same day, Swiber issued an announcement that it had been placed under judicial management and a separate announcement that it would be defaulting on an upcoming coupon payment for the Series 15 Notes.', '14\\u2003On 12 October 2016, Swiber announced that it would be defaulting on an upcoming coupon payment for the Series 14 Notes.', '15\\u2003By a letter dated 13 October 2016, BMT\u2019s then-solicitors wrote to Swiber\u2019s solicitors stating that BMT \u201crecognises Potential Events of Default and Events of Default (variously relating to the Notes)\u201d, including acts and\/or omissions notified in the announcements referred to at [11]\u2013[14] above.

The letter also stated the following:', 'The Judicial Managers thus notified BMT that it was disclaiming any personal liability under the Deed and related agreements between Swiber and BMT.', '17\\u2003On 11 January 2017, the Judicial Managers issued an announcement that an informal creditors\u2019 meeting would be held on 25 January 2017. Notices of the meeting were sent to persons who were listed in CDP\u2019s records as holders of particular amounts of the Notes (\u201cthe Account Holders\u201d). However, a notice of this meeting was not sent to BMT. It seemed that this led to some confusion on the part of BMT and the Account Holders over who was entitled to attend the informal creditors\u2019 meeting and, more generally, who was entitled to participate as a creditor in the judicial management of Swiber. BMT was later allowed to attend the 25 January 2017 meeting upon request.', '18\\u2003At the meeting on 25 January 2017, the Judicial Managers stated that they intended to propose a scheme of arrangement for approval by the creditors.', '19\\u2003On 13 June 2017, BMT filed a proof of debt as the trustee of the Notes. According to BMT, this was \u201cin line with [its] expectation that it [would] be declared as the proper party to vote at creditor and scheme meetings in respect of the Notes as provided under the Trust Deed\u201d. Subsequently, in a report to Swiber\u2019s creditors, the Judicial Managers informed that \u201cthe bondholders will be liaising with [BMT] in relation to their claims\u201d, and that claims, ie, proofs of debt filed by bondholders with Swiber would be disregarded \u201cin view that [BMT] had already filed [bondholders\u2019] claims on their behalf\u201d.', '20\\u2003On 5 September 2017, BMT filed Summons No 4055 of 2017 (\u201cSummons 4055\u201d) for the following directions and orders:', '(a)\\u2003directions as to whether the right to vote in respect of the Notes at any meeting of Swiber\u2019s creditors vested in BMT;', '(b)\\u2003directions as to whether at a meeting of Swiber\u2019s creditors, BMT would count for \u201cx\u201d number of votes, \u201cx\u201d representing the number of individual ultimate beneficial owners of the relevant notes in respect of which BMT exercised the right to vote;', '(c)\\u2003an order that BMT\u2019s costs (including the costs of its solicitors) in carrying out its duties under the Deed \u201cbe treated as debts incurred under contracts entered into by the Judicial Managers in carrying out their functions to be charged on and paid out of [Swiber\u2019s] property \u2026\u201d (in priority to other debts);', '(d)\\u2003an order that the Judicial Managers provide BMT promptly, and without the need for request, notice of hearings in OS 767 and copies of reports issued by the Judicial Managers; and', '(e)\\u2003an order for costs of and incidental to the application, to be paid out of Swiber\u2019s assets.', '21\\u2003During the hearing on 27 November 2017, Mr Wilson Zhu (\u201cMr Zhu\u201d), counsel for the Judicial Managers, submitted that an order in relation to the provision of information to BMT (see [20(d)] above) would be unnecessary, as the Judicial Managers were prepared to confirm that, moving forward, they would provide BMT with the information sought. Mr Suresh Sukumaran Nair (\u201cMr Nair\u201d), counsel for BMT, indicated that he was satisfied with that confirmation. In other words, BMT was no longer seeking an order relating to the provision of information. That matter accordingly fell away.', '22\\u2003Besides BMT and the Judicial Managers, the Trust Certificate Holders also filed submissions in this application, for the purpose of obtaining guidance regarding the trust certificates they held, on the basis that these were similar to the Notes. Although I appreciated that my decision could have a bearing on the legal position relating to the trust certificates, I made it clear at the hearing on 27 November 2017 that issues relating to the trust certificates were not strictly before me and I would not be making any rulings on such issues.'"}

The Senior Lenders took security in the form of a first fixed charge, covering inter alia present and future book debts, as well as a first floating charge over all assets of JAC both present and future. There was also an assignment between JAC and the Agent on 28 April 2011 (\u201cthe Assignment\u201d), under which receivables payable to JAC under the Glencore\u2013JAC Feedstock Supply Agreement and Glencore\u2013JAC Product Offtake Agreement, amongst other agreements, were assigned to the Senior Lenders. 3', '7\\u2003On 23 December 2014, a set-off agreement was entered into between Glencore and JAC for the set-off of mutual claims arising out of the Glencore\u2013JAC Feedstock Supply Agreement and Glencore\u2013JAC Product Offtake Agreement (\u201cthe Set-Off Agreement\u201d). 4', '8\\u2003In 2014 and 2015, JAC encountered difficulties.

Tolling is essentially the processing of raw materials for a fee. Thus under the Tolling Agreement, the Defendants continued to supply feedstock to JAC for processing into aromatics and petroleum products and would thereafter receive and sell the products. In exchange, JAC received a tolling fee. Funds were injected by the Senior Lenders. 7', '10\\u2003Subsequently, a purchaser for the Plant, ExxonMobil Asia Pacific Pte Ltd (\u201cExxonMobil\u201d), was found.

His Statement of Claim asserted the following: 1', '5\\u2003The Statement of Claim listed \u201csupporting reasons\u201d as follows: 2', '6\\u2003The Statement of Claim enclosed two volumes of documents which were labelled \u201cSupporting Documents 1\u201d and \u201cSupporting Documents 2\u201d respectively. Mr Cheong subsequently tendered a further set of supporting documents labelled \u201cTrial Document 1\u201d. The documents comprised miscellaneous pictures pertaining to a variety of problems, generally with a caption on the side. The pictures and captions traversed a wide variety of topics including, but not limited to, failed job interviews, errors in finance textbooks and health problems. I give three examples for illustration:', '(a)\\u2003On page 88 of Trial Document 1, 3', 'Mr Cheong displayed a picture of what appeared to be tissue paper or toilet paper covered in blood, with the caption: \u201cInternal bleeding on and off when passing motion, happened many times over the span of 2016 and 2017. Suspect something is left in the body after consuming food products.\u201d The caption continued to describe other matters related to defaecation.', '(b)\\u2003On page 83 of Supporting Document 1, 4', 'Mr Cheong displayed an email exchange between himself and an employee of Citibank Singapore, arranging for an interview for the position of Treasury Service Manager. The caption read: \u201cInterview at Citi for Treasury Services Management was a regulated setting. There were other job interviews during that period affected.\u201d Although it was unclear, I inferred that he was not selected for the position, and he attributed this to the fact that the interview was \u201ca regulated setting\u201d.', '(c)\\u2003On page 72 of Trial Document 1, 5', 'Mr Cheong displayed a letter from the Legal Aid Bureau informing him that he was not eligible for legal aid as his disposable capital was above the statutorily prescribed means testing limits. He captioned the picture \u201cRegulations at legal aid bureau\u201d. He claimed that the \u201cCriteria\u2019s do [sic] not make sense\u201d. 6', '7\\u2003The Attorney-General (\u201cthe AG\u201d) acted for Mr Lee in those proceedings. The AG took the view that s 19(3) of the Government Proceedings Act (Cap 121, 1985 Rev Ed) (\u201cGPA\u201d) mandates that proceedings against the Government should be instituted against the Attorney-General where no specific Government department is appropriate. Mr Lee was not being sued in his personal capacity, but rather in his capacity as Prime Minister and head of the Government. Therefore, the AG\u2019s view was that the AG, and not Mr Lee, ought to have been named as the defendant. Whilst that was his view, rather than rest his case on this technical irregularity, he decided to proceed with an application to strike out Mr Cheong\u2019s claim on the ground that it was frivolous, vexatious and disclosed no reasonable cause of action.', '8\\u2003On 30 April 2018, I struck out the action for the reason that it disclosed no reasonable cause of action. In brief, Mr Cheong\u2019s claim was that Mr Lee or the Prime Minister\u2019s Office were imposing regulations on his activities. He appeared to be asking for a contract, or for the disclosure of a contract that regulated his activities. Mr Cheong did not, however, plead any facts which demonstrated that Mr Lee or any person from the Prime Minister\u2019s Office had offered any terms to Mr Cheong, or had accepted any offers made by Mr Cheong. The factual premise of Mr Cheong\u2019s contention on being regulated was similarly incoherent. First, Mr Cheong did not plead any facts which demonstrated the existence of any \u201cregulations\u201d that originated from Mr Lee or the Prime Minister\u2019s Office. Second, there were no facts which demonstrated how the \u201cregulations\u201d caused or contributed to the host of problems he had identified in his supporting documents. The details provided in the supporting documents appeared to be a collation of conspiracy theories with no supporting facts. To use the allegation identified at [6(b)] above as an example, it was difficult to understand how and why Mr Lee or the staff in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office or in fact any government body would have any role in Mr Cheong\u2019s interview at Citibank. Even where public servants were involved, such as in [6(c)] above, it was clear that whatever requirements that were imposed upon him were of general application and to the extent that he was suggesting that he was somehow unfairly treated, that could not be sustained. There was simply no basis to suggest that the vicissitudes of life faced by Mr Cheong were caused by the Prime Minister or his department.', '9\\u2003On 9 May 2018, a day after a copy of the extracted order of court in Suit 125 was served on Mr Cheong, Mr Cheong filed Suit No 489 of 2018 (\u201cSuit 489\u201d). This suit, which is the suit that presently concerns the court, named Mr Lee as the defendant again. The substance of the Statement of Claim filed for Suit 489 was similar to the earlier Statement of Claim filed, requesting as follows: 7', '10\\u2003The new Statement of Claim enclosed a volume of documents labelled \u201cTrial Document 1 (May 2018)\u201d, which was almost identical to the volume of documents labelled \u201cTrial Document 1\u201d, which Mr Cheong had tendered previously. The Statement of Claim provided a \u201cDescription of Trial Document 1 (May 2018)\u201d, which was as follows: 8', '11\\u2003The AG took the same view as he did in the earlier suit, that while he ought to have been the named defendant because of the GPA, the best course was to apply to strike out the action. An application to do so was made on 19 June 2018 by way of Summons No 2809 of 2018, which is the summons before me. In this summons, in addition to the first prayer to strike out the action, the AG asked for the following: 9', '12\\u2003Such an order was granted by Amarjeet Singh JC in Chua Choon Lim Robert v MN Swami and others [2000] 2 SLR 589 (\u201cChua Choon Lim\u201d) at [63]\u2013[64]. Singh JC held that the power to grant such an order was in addition to the power conferred by s 74 of the SCJA.', '13\\u2003Subsequent local decisions, however, have queried the scope of the powers of the court in this regard, in particular where the AG is a party. In Attorney-General v Tee Kok Boon [2008] 2 SLR(R) 412 (\u201cTee Kok Boon\u201d) at [124], Woo Bih Li J queried whether the inherent power, \u201ceven if it existed\u201d, had been superseded by s 74 of the SCJA, in particular where the AG was the applicant. These reservations are pertinent here in view of the AG\u2019s position that he is the correct defendant. In Lai Swee Lin Linda v Attorney-General [2016] 5 SLR 476 (\u201cLinda Lai\u201d) at [18], the Court of Appeal allowed for the possibility, remarking that the English courts had taken a position that the court has an inherent jurisdiction to do this in \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d. In Attorney-General v Tham Yim Siong and others [2017] 5 SLR 1206 (\u201cAG v Tham\u201d), Kannan Ramesh J, at [72], queried whether such a power could render s 74 of the SCJA otiose. In a Ministry of Law Consultation Paper dated 2 July 2018 (\u201cthe Ministry of Law Consultation Paper\u201d), the Ministry proposed to empower the courts to grant orders which included the order requested by the AG, explaining that the High Court is at present \u201conly able\u201d to exercise powers under s 74 of the SCJA.', '14\\u2003On 23 July 2018, I explained to parties that these doubts expressed about the court\u2019s inherent powers merited further consideration. In the light of the novel issues raised, and the fact that Mr Cheong was acting in person, a Young Amicus Curiae, Mr Sui Yi Siong (\u201cMr Sui\u201d), was appointed to assist the court and I thank Mr Sui for his most helpful assistance. Mr Sui considered the following questions: 10', '(a)\\u2003First, whether the court has the inherent power to make an order preventing a litigant from commencing future legal proceedings.', '(b)\\u2003Second, assuming this inherent power exists, how does this interact with s 74 of the SCJA and what are the principles and limits that govern the exercise of this power, in light of the following cases: (i) Chua Choon Lim; (ii) the dicta in Linda Lai that the inherent power should only be used in \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d; (iii) the High Court\u2019s remarks in AG v Tham; and (iv) Wellmix Organics (International) Pte Ltd v Lau Yu Man [2006] 2 SLR(R) 117 (\u201cWellmix Organics\u201d).', '(c)\\u2003Third, whether this inherent power is consistent with the generality of the framework of the court\u2019s inherent powers espoused in Roberto Building Material Pte Ltd and others v Overseas-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd and another [2003] 2 SLR(R) 353 (\u201cRoberto Building Material\u201d) and Re Nalpon Zero Geraldo Mario [2013] 3 SLR 258 (\u201cRe Nalpon Zero\u201d).', '(d)\\u2003Fourth, to consider the applicability of the UK position on the court\u2019s inherent powers as discussed in Bhamjee v Forsdick and others [2004] 1 WLR 88 (\u201cBhamjee\u201d) as well as any subsequent developments in the UK or other relevant jurisdictions.', '(e)\\u2003Fifth, to consider the relevance, if any, of the current proposal for legislative amendments to the SCJA in the Ministry of Law Consultation Paper.', '15\\u2003On 28 August 2018, the AG filed submissions on the same queries, and followed with Originating Summons No 1071 of 2018 (\u201cOS 1071\u201d) to apply under s 74 of the SCJA to prevent Mr Cheong from commencing any legal proceedings in relation to any matters arising out of Suit 125 and Suit 489, without leave of the High Court. State Counsel, Mr Sivakumar Ramasamy (\u201cMr Sivakumar\u201d), has confirmed that OS 1071 is only to be pursued in the event that the AG\u2019s earlier application for the court to exercise its inherent power is rejected. 11'"}

Therefore, I shall only reproduce the salient facts which are necessary for an appreciation of the issues on sentence in these appeals.', '7\\u2003The second appellant, Loh, was at all material times the general manager of Global Marine Transportation Pte Ltd (\u201cGMT\u201d), a company in the business of providing, inter alia, bunkering services to marine vessels. In August 2012, Loh received US$30,000 in cash from one Ronnie Lau, his former boss and the then managing director of GMT. 1', 'Ronnie Lau had instructed Loh that this money was to be applied towards GMT\u2019s purposes.', '8\\u2003In July 2013, Chua, who was at all material times the operations manager of GMT, approached Loh with a proposal to cover GMT\u2019s loading losses by carrying out buy-back transactions. Loading losses result from the loss of bunker fuel that may occur when barges load bunker fuel at the terminals and there is a variance between the terminal and barge readings. Such variance can arise due to factors such as the temperature of the fuel. There is an industry standard for tolerance of such variance, and any loading loss is usually absorbed by the bunker company. 2', '9\\u2003Loh agreed with this proposal and passed the US$30,000 to Chua to be used for carrying out these buy-back transactions. 3', 'In his statement, Chua described the manner in which these buy-back transactions would be carried out: \u201c[b]uy-back means that the chief engineer of the vessel will agreed [sic] to sell us back the extra bunker and we will pay him some money for agreeing to do so\u201d. Chua went on to state, as an illustration, that GMT would contractually agree to supply 1000 metric tonnes of bunker to a vessel. However, it would, in reality, only supply 950 metric tonnes of bunker, and pay a bribe to the chief engineer of the vessel to certify that 1000 metric tonnes of bunker were supplied. In such transactions, the bunker clerk and the surveyor would also be involved as they would be the ones taking the opening and closing readings of the fuel gauge. Therefore, part of the bribe meant for the chief engineer would also have to go to the bunker clerk and surveyor for their involvement in faking the opening and closing readings. 4', '10\\u2003Subsequently, Chua passed the US$30,000 on to Lau and instructed him to hold on to the money and stand-by in preparation for any bribes that they would have to pay to carry out the buy-back transactions. Separately, Chua also briefed Samsudin about the details of the plan. Samsudin, being the cargo officer who would actually be on board the vessels, would inform Lau if there was a potential buy-back transaction. Lau would then call Chua to seek approval for the amount of bribe to be paid. After Chua approved the amount, Lau would then deliver the bribe monies to Samsudin, who would then pass on the bribe to the relevant people on board the vessels. 5', '11\\u2003On 29 October 2013, a bunkering barge operated by GMT, the Swan, was supplying bunker to a vessel, the Demeter Leader. Samsudin was the cargo officer stationed on board the Swan. 6', 'At 3.50pm, Lau received a call from Samsudin, who requested for US$6,000 to be passed to him for the purpose of paying bribes to carry out a buy-back transaction. 7', 'Lau then sought approval from Chua, which Chua granted. Lau thereafter went to Pasir Panjang pier and handed Samsudin the US$6,000. 8', '12\\u2003Later that night, at about 9.15pm, the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore and the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (\u201cCPIB\u201d) conducted a joint raid on the Swan and the Demeter Leader. A simultaneous raid was conducted by another CPIB team at Lau\u2019s residence. Lau was arrested and escorted back to the CPIB\u2019s premises. 9', '13\\u2003After Lau was arrested, Lau\u2019s son delivered an envelope to Chua which contained the remaining US$24,000. 10', 'Chua then passed the US$24,000 to his wife, and instructed her to pass the money to his mother to take to his brother\u2019s home. Chua admitted that his intention was to hide the US$24,000. 11', 'The US$24,000 was subsequently recovered by CPIB officers from Chua\u2019s brother\u2019s home.', '14\\u2003Importantly, it should be noted that there was no evidence adduced at the trial below of any actual buy-back transaction that had taken place. 12', 'However, the Judge held that for a charge of criminal conspiracy, the mere criminal agreement is an offence even if no step is taken to carry out that agreement: NMMY Momin v The State of Mahrashtra (1971) Cri LJ 793 at 796, cited by the Court of Appeal in Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP [1998] 3 SLR(R) 619 at [75]. 13'"}

He stood at the corridor outside the Unit and spotted the bag inside when he looked in through the opened window louver. Thereafter, he used his hands to insert the bamboo pole through the opened window louver to hook the bag and dishonestly remove it from the Unit. The Appellant retained the cash and Hamirul\u2019s POSB debit card, but discarded the bag and the remaining items. None of the stolen items were recovered.'"}

{"casename":"2018_SGHC_224","fact":"the facts there, the court construed the provision  in \nquestion to exclude peripheral support staff and was of the view  that it applied  \nonly to the employer\u2019s senior staff.  It was therefore  not too wide.\n28 Powerdrive did not dispute the general  proposition that if the ROT \nClause applied to all its employees regardless of seniority, scope of work and \naccess to confidential information, it would be too wide. However,  it argued \nthat the court  should  not embark on this assessment at this  stage. \n29 The defendants argued that there  was clear evidence from  Powerdrive \nitself that it was applying  the ROT Clause to all its employees regardless of \nseniority, scope of  work and access to confidential  information.\n30 As mentioned above (supra [10]),  Powerdrive itself  was relying  on an \nemail dated 6 April 2010 to its employees to argue that while the fifth \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPowerdrive Pte Ltd v Loh Kin Yong Philip [2018]  SGHC  224\n8defendant\u2019s contract of employment did not contain  an ROT provision,  he was \nbound by a similar provision nevertheless by virtue of para 4 of that email. In \ncl 10 of his employment  contract, the management of Powerdrive  reserved the \nright to change the terms of his employment  at its sole discretion and hence \nPowerdrive submitted that it was entitled  to unilaterally impose, by that email, \npara 4 on the fifth defendant.  \n31 That email was sent to the following email  addresses:  \nall@powerdrive.com.sg and all@elc.com.sg (see p 383 of Plaintiff\u2019s Bundle of \nCause Papers).  It started by saying, \u201cHi all, There are several  T&C add-ons to \nthe HR Guide  w.e.f. from 1st April 2010. Please read carefully.\u201d\n32 In arguments, Powerdrive suggested that perhaps that email was sent to \nonly a select group of employees since there was no evidence as to whether the \nemail addresses to which  the email was sent applied  to all its employees or not.\n33 However,  Powerdrive  was caught out when it made this suggestion.  At \npara 46 of its SOC,  ie, before the proposed amendments were raised, it stated \nthat its email of 6 April 2010 was sent to \u201call of its employees including  the 5th \ndefendant\u201d. Paragraph  46 was repeated as para 49 of its latest draft of the SOC \n(Amendment No 1)  without qualification.\n34 Secondly, Chua Eng Wah William  (\u201cChua\u201d),  a director of Powerdrive, \nhad executed an affidavit on 12 March  2018 in response to the application (in \nSummons 698) of the first to fifth defendants to strike out the SOC. \nParagraph 32 of his affidavit referred to the email dated 6 April  2010 and said, \n\u201cIt is clear that the email was sent to all employees  of the Plaintiff, one of whom \nwas the 5th Defendant.\u201d\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPowerdrive Pte Ltd v Loh Kin Yong Philip [2018]  SGHC  224\n935 Furthermore,  para 36 of Chua\u2019s affidavit stated that as regards the \nprohibition from  working  for a rival for two years, \u201cduring  all HR sessions \nand\/or company  retreats, the management  makes it a point to stress and \nhighlight this issue to all the employees\u201d. It then went on to refer to the email \ndated 6 April 2010. \n36 Thirdly, at no time before the hearings  did Powerdrive seek to suggest \nthat it had sought to restrict the use of the ROT Clause to certain categories  of \nemployees. Neither did it say that by \u201call\u201d  in its email, it meant to refer  to only \nall employees  of a particular  category. \n37 In the circumstances,  it was therefore  clear to me that there was no point \nin waiting for a trial to see if Powerdrive  had been applying the ROT Clause to \nall its employees. \n38 I was of the view  that such a wide scope of the ROT Clause was not \nreasonable in the interest of the public even if it could  be argued that it was \nreasonable as between  each of the first five defendants  and Powerdrive. The \nROT Clause was too wide  on the first point. \n39 I come now to the second point on the scope  of the ROT Clause, ie, that \nit was unreasonably wide  in terms of the scope  of work it sought to restrain  the \nfirst to fifth defendants from doing when employed by a  rival.\n40 On the face of the ROT Clause,  each employee was prohibited from  \nworking for a rival regardless of the scope of his work with his new employer. \nThe ROT Clause  was not confined to working for a rival in the same or a similar \ncapacity as that in which the employee was working when employed  by \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPowerdrive Pte Ltd v Loh Kin Yong Philip [2018]  SGHC  224\n10Powerdrive. That was the construction raised by the defendants and hence they \nargued that the ROT Clause was  too wide to be reasonable.\n41 The first to fourth defendants were  employed by Powerdrive as \n\u201ctrainers\u201d to train armour vehicle drivers. The fifth defendant was employed as \na \u201cjunior  consultant\u201d, also with respect to the training of armour  vehicle drivers. \nPowerdrive\u2019s Reply to the Defence of the first to fifth defendants  was that each \nof these defendants was only prevented from  being employed as an Armour \nVehicle Driver  Trainer (\u201cAVDT\u201d). He was not prevented from being employed  \nas a driver  trainer for any other type of vehicle. Chua deposed  that the ROT \nClause was not intended to prevent each defendant and\/or any other employee \nfrom seeking employment as a driver trainer for any other type of vehicle.1 Thus \nPowerdrive was implicitly acknowledging that if the court were to conclude  that \nthe scope of the ROT Clause was as wide as construed by the defendants (supra \n[40]),  then  it would be unenforceable.\n42 Powerdrive relied on Turner v Commonwealth and British Minerals  Ltd \n[2000] IRLR 114 where Lord Justice Waller said at [14] that, \u201c[i]f a particular \nconstruction was to lead to the view that the clause  was unenforceable, then an \nalternative view, which did not lead to the same result if legitimate,  ought to be \npreferred\u201d.  \n43 In my view, this is a general  proposition which applies only where there \nare two reasonable interpretations  of an ROT provision, one of which  would \nrender it unenforceable and the other  would allow it to be upheld. It does not \nmean that the court should bend backwards to come  to some  sort of \ninterpretation that will save the provision from unenforceability. It has often \n1 Affidavit of Chua Eng  Wah William (12 March 2018) at para 9.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPowerdrive Pte Ltd v Loh Kin Yong Philip [2018]  SGHC  224\n11been said that courts will not rewrite the contract for parties  (see for example, \nMan Financial at  [127]).              \n44 I accept that each ROT provision must be considered in context (see for \nexample Man Financial at [141]).  However, it was one thing for Powerdrive to \nsay that its intention was to preclude the first to fifth defendants from being \nemployed as an AVDT. It was another thing to say that that was the meaning of \nthe ROT Clause. Moreover, since it appeared  that the ROT Clause applied  to all \nother employees  of Powerdrive  as well, what did the ROT Clause preclude each \nof them from doing? Even if Powerdrive\u2019s  point was simply that each employee, \nregardless of seniority  or the nature of the work, was not to be employed in a \nsimilar capacity  by a rival, this would again  suggest that the ROT Clause was a \nblanket prohibition being used indiscriminately.  \n45 In my view, there was no need  to await  a trial. The court could construe \nthe ROT Clause at this stage,  as Powerdrive did not suggest what other evidence \nwas required to aid in the construction of the clause. Furthermore, it seemed  to \nme that to construe  the ROT Clause as prohibiting the first to fifth defendants \nfrom being employed as an AVDT  only was to re-write the ROT Clause. This \nentailed more than just construing the ROT Clause in context. One has to be \ncareful about applying the context argument  liberally otherwise it will \nencourage employers to start with a widely worded ROT provision and then, \nonly when  challenged, to say that the provision should  be construed narrowly  \nin context so  as to save its  enforceability.\n46 For reasons stated above, I did not agree with Powerdrive\u2019s narrow \nconstruction. Instead, I agreed  with the defendants\u2019  argument. The ROT Clause \nwas too wide on the second point too. It was not reasonable as between \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPowerdrive Pte Ltd v Loh Kin Yong Philip [2018]  SGHC  224\n12Powerdrive and the first to fifth defendants.  Neither  was it reasonable in the \ninterest of the public.                  \n47 I come now to the third point relating  to the duration of the prohibition \nunder the ROT Clause. The duration was two years. Each of the first to fourth \ndefendants had entered into a two-year fixed term contract of employment with \nPowerdrive. There  was no explanation  by Powerdrive as to why it used two \nyears as the prohibited duration even though it knew that the defendants were \nattacking the ROT Clause because of its width. \n48 It appeared that the two-year  duration was arbitrarily selected by \nPowerdrive. This is reinforced by the fact that the fifth defendant did not have \na fixed term of employment. There  was a six-month probation  period for him. \nThereafter, either side could terminate his employment by giving one month\u2019s  \nnotice of intention to terminate  to the other  side. It will be remembered that \nPowerdrive was alleging that the fifth defendant too was caught by the ROT \nClause implemented  through  para 4 of the 6 April 2010 email,  which also had a \ntwo-year prohibition. Again, there was no explanation why such an employee \nshould be caught by a two-year ROT provision. \n49 In my view, the duration  of the ROT Clause  was also unreasonably wide  \nwhether from the perspective  of the parties or the public.  The ROT Clause was \ntoo wide on the third point as well.    \n50 Accordingly,  I was of the view that the ROT Clause  was too wide to be \nenforceable.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPowerdrive Pte Ltd v Loh Kin Yong Philip [2018]  SGHC  224\n13Part of  serial no 5 and  serial  no 3 of the  Table\n51 Some of the proposed amendments  under  serial no 5 of the Table also \ncontained various allegations that the first to fifth defendants had, by having \ncommenced employment with ST Kinetics, transferred their knowledge of \ncertain training methodologies of Powerdrive  and information gained therefrom  \nand\/or were in a position to transfer such knowledge and information to ST \nKinetics. These allegations  were raised  in the proposed paras 74, 79, 83, 87 and \n92.          \n52 Furthermore,  for the fifth defendant, Powerdrive also attempted to \nintroduce an allegation that he had disclosed confidential information on a \nspecific occasion.  This attempt is captured under serial no 3 of the Table and \nwas made  by the proposed inclusion of a  new para 54. \n53 As for the allegation of breaches  relating  to the disclosure  of confidential  \ninformation by the first to fifth defendants generally, as suggested in the \nproposed amendments for the SOC (Amendment  No 1), these allegations were  \nvague. Even  the allegation of disclosure of confidential information by the fifth \ndefendant on a specific  occasion in the proposed para 54 was also vague because \nit did not identify specifically the confidential information that was allegedly \ndisclosed by him. \n54 Moreover,  Powerdrive\u2019s counsel confirmed  during arguments that there \nwas in fact no allegation  in any of the supporting affidavits of Powerdrive  that \nany of the first to fifth defendants had in fact disclosed confidential information. \nHis point was that the potential for breach was sufficient to justify the \nimposition of a general  ROT  via the ROT Clause. However, that was a different \nargument. If the ROT Clause was too wide to be enforceable in any event, as I \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPowerdrive Pte Ltd v Loh Kin Yong Philip [2018]  SGHC  224\n14concluded, then Powerdrive could not use the ROT Clause to restrain the first \nto fifth defendants from  working for ST Kinetics.\n55 The only remaining issue then would be whether Powerdrive could  rely \non the confidentiality  provisions against the first to fifth defendants for a more \nlimited cause of action, ie, against the disclosure of confidential information. \nSince no allegation had in fact been made  in any of Powerdrive\u2019s affidavits  of \nsuch disclosure,  then even this cause of action was not available to it. Hence, \nany suggestion of disclosure of confidential information in the proposed  \namendments could not be allowed as well.\nSerial no 6\n56 Serial  no 6 pertained to the proposed paras 94 and 95. These  paragraphs \nwere meant to allege  that Powerdrive had a legitimate interest in maintaining  a \nstable work force. The purpose of this allegation  was to justify the use of the \nROT Clause.       \n57 However,  this allegation also suffered from the same  fate as the \nallegation about the need to protect  confidential  information through  an ROT \nprovision. Even if there  was a legitimate interest to protect, whether the interest \nbe that of confidential information or a stable workforce, the width  of the ROT \nClause still had  to be  considered.\n58 For the same reasons mentioned  above, the ROT Clause was in my view \ntoo wide.\n59 Moreover,  there  was another reason to reject these proposed \namendments \u2013 they were proposed  only in the latest draft of the SOC \n(Amendment No 1) after two earlier  drafts  of amendments had been  proposed. \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPowerdrive Pte Ltd v Loh Kin Yong Philip [2018]  SGHC  224\n15It appeared that they were included  as a last-ditch  attempt by Powerdrive  to \njustify the use of the ROT Clause. Perhaps  because  of this last-ditch attempt, \nthere was no affidavit from Powerdrive to assert that the ROT Clause was to \nmaintain a stable work  force. The allegation was found only in the latest draft \nof the SOC (Amendment No 1). \n60 As it was Powerdrive\u2019s  application  to amend its pleading,  it was for \nPowerdrive to support the application by way of a supporting affidavit.  Its initial \napplication referred  to an initial draft of the SOC (Amendment No 1) and was \nsupported by an affidavit. When it proposed a second draft of the proposed  \npleading, it filed a supplementary affidavit later.  However,  when it proposed the \nthird and latest draft, there was no supporting affidavit to assert that the ROT \nClause was to maintain a stable work  force.\n61 Powerdrive had had more than one chance  to get its act together. As it \nwas, the attempt to include these  amendments  in its latest draft was the very first \ntime Powerdrive was alleging, in a proposed pleading, that the ROT Clause was \nto maintain a stable work force. However, such an allegation  was still not even \nsupported by any affidavit. I was of the view that enough indulgence had been \ngranted to Powerdrive and the absence of a supporting affidavit for these \namendments was  an additional reason to refuse them.     \nSerial no 7\n62 I come  now to serial  no 7 of the Table. This pertained  to the proposed \nparas 96 to 104. These proposed amendments were to introduce a new cause of \naction against  ST Kinetics for the tort of inducement of breach of contract. Prior \nto these proposed amendments,  no cause of action was pleaded against ST \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPowerdrive Pte Ltd v Loh Kin Yong Philip [2018]  SGHC  224\n16Kinetics. That was why ST Kinetics  had filed Summons 605 to strike out \nPowerdrive\u2019s claim against it. \n63 The alleged tort of inducing  breach of contract  pertained to the alleged \nbreach by the first five defendants of the ROT Clause  when they were employed  \nby ST Kinetics. The proposed amendments were  to allege that ST Kinetics had \ninduced these five defendants to breach  the ROT Clause. However, if the ROT \nClause was not enforceable, then  the tort would not be established.\n64 In the light of my decision  that the ROT Clause was not enforceable, \nPowerdrive could no longer  sustain the alleged tort. Hence  I refused the \nproposed amendments to include  that tort.\nSerial nos  1 and  2\n65 Serial  no 1 of the Table pertained to proposed paras 33 and 34 on a \ndiscrete claim against the third defendant  in respect of salary that was allegedly \noverpaid to him. I was of the view that such a claim  should not in any event be \nincluded in a claim  against  the various defendants for breach of the ROT Clause \nand\/or for disclosing  confidential information. \n66 Serial  no 2 of the Table pertained to the proposed para 46 which was \nalso a discrete claim against the fourth defendant in respect of an early release \npenalty payment pursuant to cl 6 of his employment agreement. I was also of \nthe view that such a claim should not be included  in a claim against the various  \ndefendants for breach of the ROT Clause and\/or for disclosing confidential \ninformation. \n67 These two claims would have unnecessarily  prolonged the trial for all \nthe defendants, some of whom were not at all involved  in the discrete claims. \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPowerdrive Pte Ltd v Loh Kin Yong Philip [2018]  SGHC  224\n17The defendants who were not involved  were  entitled not to be distracted by \nthose additional claims. \nThe rest of the proposed  amendments\n68 Serial  nos 8, 9 to 15 and 16 to 18 were proposed consequential  \namendments which  had become academic  since Powerdrive\u2019s claim for breach \nof the ROT Clause  and for  disclosure  of confidential information would fail.\nConclusion\n69 Accordingly,  I dismissed the application in Summons 628 in respect of \nthe substantive amendments without prejudice  to Powerdrive\u2019s right to file a \nfresh claim against the third and fourth defendants for the discrete  claims. No \norder was  made on the  proposed consequential amendments.\n70  In the light of my decision  that the ROT Clause  was not enforceable, I \ngranted ST Kinetics an order to strike out"}

I will refer to S 1051\/2016 and S 1052\/2016 collectively as the Initial Suits.', '13\\u2003Subsequently, G1 and Mface applied for summary judgment in S 1051\/2016 and S 1052\/2016 respectively. On 6 March 2017, at the conclusion of the hearing for the summary judgment application before AR Li, G1 successfully obtained summary judgment for $2,968,951.43 in S 1051\/2016. However, AR Li granted the defendants in S 1052\/2016 conditional leave to defend the claim for $5,868,848.92 provided that they provide a banker\u2019s guarantee or pay into court that sum of money by 3 April 2017. Failure to meet this condition would result in judgment being entered for Mface. The defendants were also given unconditional leave to defend the further claim of $3,357,612.08. It transpired that the defendants in S 1052\/2016 failed to satisfy the condition for leave to defend. Consequently, judgment was entered against the defendants for $5,868,848.92 in favour of Mface.', '14\\u2003The Plaintiffs thereafter commenced proceedings to enforce the two judgment sums. On 11 April 2017, G1 and Mface each successfully applied to attach Astoria\u2019s interest in the Development for the satisfaction of the judgments (the \u201cAttachment Orders\u201d). 17', 'On 10 and 13 April 2017, Mface also applied for writs of seizure and sale to be issued against OAC, Astoria and PST for all moveable properties and shares (the \u201cWSS\u201d). 18', 'On 26 April 2017, pursuant to HC\/WSS 16\/2017, construction related equipment and building materials which were found on the premises of the Development were seized by the Sheriff of the Supreme Court. 19', '15\\u2003On 11 May 2017, the Plaintiffs entered into a settlement agreement (the \u201cSettlement Agreement\u201d) with Astoria, for which OAC, Ranesis and PST agreed to act as guarantors (the \u201cGuarantors\u201d). 20', 'In essence, the Settlement Agreement was for the Plaintiffs to discontinue all enforcement actions and outstanding suits against the Defendants, in exchange for $13.8 million to be paid by Astoria. The Settlement Agreement provided as follows: 21', '16\\u2003The $13.8 million that Astoria would have to pay Mface pursuant to the Settlement Agreement comprises the following sums:', '17\\u2003On 16 May 2017, Mface requested the Sheriff of the Supreme Court to release the properties that were seized under the WSS. 22', 'On 26 May 2017, Mface filed a Notice of Discontinuance for parts of its claim in S 1052\/2016 for which summary judgment had not been obtained, ie, the $3,357,612.08 for which the defendants in S 1052\/2016 had been given conditional leave to defend. 23', 'At the hearing before me on 2 July 2018, both counsel confirmed that the Plaintiffs had also taken steps to discontinue examination of judgment debtor proceedings within a reasonable time. 24', '18\\u2003Notwithstanding the Plaintiffs\u2019 efforts to discontinue enforcement proceedings as listed in [17] above, it was undisputed that the Plaintiffs did not take any action to withdraw the Attachment Orders. This forms the basis for the Defendants\u2019 allegation that the Plaintiffs had committed a repudiatory breach of the Settlement Agreement leading to its termination. This will be discussed in further detail below.', '19\\u2003Although the first cheque that Astoria caused to be issued was dishonoured, payment of the first instalment of $50,000 was eventually made by way of a cashier\u2019s order. 25', 'However, the cheque from Astoria for the second monthly instalment of $500,000 was dishonoured. 26', 'No further instalment payments were forthcoming from Astoria or any of the Guarantors. 27', '20\\u2003On 21 September 2017, the Plaintiffs commenced S 885\/2017 against Astoria, the Guarantors, and THK to claim the remaining $13.75 million that was due pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. THK was made a defendant in the suit because he held two million shares in Ranesis as a constructive trustee. 28', '21\\u2003The Defendants filed Notices of Appeal to a Judge of High Court in Chambers on 27 March 2018, in respect of AR Li\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment and conditional leave to defend in the Initial Suits. I gave leave to the Defendants to appeal out of time. The hearing for RA 79 and 80 was fixed for 16 July 2018.', '22\\u2003The Plaintiffs subsequently applied for summary judgment in respect of the sum of $13.75 million. At the hearing on 23 April 2018, AR Khng held that it would not be appropriate for her to give summary judgment in respect of $8,837,800.35, being the sum awarded under the summary judgments obtained in the Initial Suits, given that those orders for summary judgment were pending an appeal before me. Therefore, she granted unconditional leave to defend the sum of $8,837,800.35. Nevertheless, she held that the rest of the sums due under the Settlement Agreement could be severed from this sum, and gave the defendants in S 885\/2017 conditional leave to defend the sum of $4,912,199.65, provided that they pay into court that sum of money by 18 June 2018. It is undisputed that this condition was not satisfied.', '23\\u2003On 7 May 2018, the Defendants filed a Notice of Appeal to a Judge of High Court in Chambers against the decision of AR Khng granting conditional leave to defend the sum of $4,912,199.65.

She also stood to gain personally from her own investment if the Furong Bonds were capital guaranteed.', '32\\u2003The first defendant alleged that the first plaintiff had failed to inform the court that none of the bonds purchased by the plaintiffs had reached maturity yet or that the Second Amended Memorandum with the capital guarantee clause (cl 1) did not apply to the majority of the Furong Bonds purchased by the plaintiffs, but only to US$900,000 of them. 70', 'This can be seen in the table below:', '33\\u2003The first defendant alleged that the first plaintiff had failed to inform the court that all three Memoranda (ie, the First Memorandum, the First Amended Memorandum and the Second Amended Memorandum) contained the following non-reliance clause: 71', 'He asserted that the above clause was fatal to the plaintiffs\u2019 case based on misrepresentation.', '34\\u2003 The first defendant added that the first plaintiff had also failed to inform the court that the Furong Bonds held by her nominee Tang and the sixth plaintiff received interest at 2.2% per quarter instead of 1.8% per six months as stipulated under the terms of those bonds. 72', 'In this regard, the sixth plaintiff had received in interest US$5,720 to date while the first plaintiff as the beneficial owner of the bonds held by Tang received interest totalling US$6,600. The first plaintiff was also paid commission of US$1,010 for the bonds sold to the sixth plaintiff and Tang even though the first plaintiff beneficially owned the latter\u2019s bonds.', '35\\u2003The first defendant further questioned the quantity (US$65,000) of the bonds sold to the sixth plaintiff by the first plaintiff as well as those (US$75,000) bought by her nominee Tang and by the fifth plaintiff (US$100,000) (see [32] above). 73', 'All three Memoranda clearly stated that the bonds must be bought for not less than US$200,000 each.', '36\\u2003The first defendant accused the first plaintiff of lying in her claim that she was shocked when she discovered that Furong and Furong Corpbond had advanced the N loan to Nutryfarm. 74', 'He alleged that she was fully aware of the N loan from as early as August 2017 and in fact was selling bonds for Furong to raise funds for the same including liaising with one Mo Huan Sheng on his $2.5m investment in Furong\u2019s 4-year 2.3% Corporate Bond II. 75', 'The first defendant stated he was not involved in Furong Corpbond. 76', '37\\u2003The first defendant deposed that there was no real risk of his dissipating his assets in any case.

The first defendant referred to copies of advertisements advertising the sale of the Sound Property exhibited in the first plaintiff\u2019s first affidavit (see [19] above) but which did not result in any firm offers until 27 January 2018. 80', '39\\u2003The first defendant\u2019s claim in this regard was supported by an affidavit filed by one Jiang Nina (\u201cJiang\u201d), a sales director from Utopia Properties Pte Ltd, who deposed that she brought the first defendant to see various condominium units and landed properties in the Serangoon\/Kovan area nearer to his son\u2019s school either to buy or to rent a property but the first defendant found nothing suitable. 81', '(Jiang is also known as \u201cGinger Jiang\u201d (see [19] above).)

Lee had told her and other employees of Furong that they should be confident of selling the Furong Bonds because the first defendant was a man of substantial means and he was their boss. Hence, it did not lie in the first defendant\u2019s mouth to say that he did not authorise and did not know (i) the contents of the facts sheets in relation to the Furong Bonds that stated the bonds were capital guaranteed; (ii) the representations that the Furong Bonds were capital guaranteed were on Furong\u2019s website; and (iii) the contents of the Memoranda given to and accepted by Furong\u2019s customers. 89', 'The Furong Bonds were sold to the public in Singapore for about a year at least and the first plaintiff found it inconceivable that the first defendant, as a director of Furong, did not know of and did not authorise the statements that the Furong Bonds were capital guaranteed. 90', '44\\u2003The first plaintiff noted that the first defendant was able to procure Lee\u2019s statutory declaration (see [28] above) in Singapore despite CVHT having defrauded Furong. 91', 'She questioned why neither Furong nor the first defendant had taken legal action against CVHT, after lodging (late) a police report. 92', '45\\u2003The first plaintiff denied she had made secret profits in selling the Furong Bonds, other than receiving her commission and salary from Furong. 93', 'She explained that she could not have had a hand in altering the terms of the Furong Bonds when she herself lost US$400,000 of her own money.', '46\\u2003The first plaintiff further denied she had made unauthorised amendments to any of the Memoranda as she had no say in their contents. 94', 'At most, she helped to translate or check the translation of the Chinese portions of the documents. She deposed that at all times she acted on the second defendant\u2019s instructions which she believed the first defendant sanctioned.', '47\\u2003As for Nutryfarm, she disclaimed involvement in the N loan although she had heard about it. 95', 'She did not know the first and second defendants would incorporate Furong Corpbond to make the N loan to Nutryfarm. She was shocked as it meant the first and second defendants were effectively \u2018ring-fencing\u2019 Furong\u2019s assets.', '48\\u2003The first plaintiff disclosed that assets-wise, neither the first defendant nor Furong would likely have sufficient assets to satisfy a judgment against them, pointing out that Furong had less than $100,000 in cash while the first defendant only had about $98,956.12 in his Singapore bank accounts and a net value (less mortgage loan outstanding) of $942,033.01 for the Sound Property. 96', 'The plaintiffs on the other hand had invested US$2.44m in the Furong Bonds.', '49\\u2003In the first defendant\u2019s affidavit filed on 3 April 2018 (\u201cthe first defendant\u2019s reply affidavit\u201d), he not surprisingly denied the first plaintiff\u2019s allegations. He asserted there was no real risk of dissipation of his assets and that the first plaintiff was giving the excuse that she could not have known that he had been attempting to sell the Sound Property since September 2017 with a view to move to a property nearer to his son\u2019s school. 97', '50\\u2003The first defendant noted that in the second defendant\u2019s defence (at paras 12(d), 21), the latter had identified the first plaintiff as one of the persons who helped to structure, prepare and finalise the facts sheets and the Memoranda. 98', '51\\u2003Contrary to the first plaintiff\u2019s allegation that the first defendant took no action to recover from CVHT the losses on Furong\u2019s investment, he deposed that after he found out about the losses in June 2017, he engaged solicitors in Hong Kong and Singapore in August 2017 and chased Lee for payment of the losses Lee had promised to meet in his message dated 25 June 2017. 99', 'CVHT in fact did make one payment of US$25,000 on 31 July 2017. However, Furong\u2019s Hong Kong solicitors raised issues of recoverability given that CVHT and Lee had no known assets. 100', 'The first defendant deposed that it was only when it was apparent that no further payments were forthcoming from Lee\/CVHT that he requested the second defendant to lodge a police report in November 2017.', '52\\u2003The first defendant noted that the first plaintiff had changed her tune. From claiming in the first plaintiff\u2019s first affidavit that she was shocked to discover about the N loan to Nutryfarm, she had in the first plaintiff\u2019s reply affidavit claimed that she knew about the N loan but not that another BVI company Furong Corpbond would be incorporated. 101', 'He said that was a lie as the first plaintiff was intimately involved together with the second defendant in putting together the documentation to be signed by Furong Corpbond. 102', 'He pointed out that he was\/is not a director of Furong Corpbond. 103'"}
{"casename":"2018_SGHC_227","fact":"'2\\u2003The background to this matter has been extensively set out in Re Aathar Ah Kong Andrew [2018] SGHC 124, a decision by Valerie Thean J where the approval which the creditors of the applicant had given to a voluntary arrangement proposed by the applicant was revoked. I will only set out the facts insofar as they are relevant to the Registrar\u2019s Appeal that was heard by me.', '3\\u2003The applicant described himself as an investor in several businesses and markets over many years. His primary investments were in private equity, bonds and listed stocks in sectors such as commodities and healthcare in Singapore and Indonesia. 1', 'He has been deep in debt since 2015, if not earlier, because of the decline in worldwide commodity prices and a plunge that year in the share prices of listed healthcare equities in which he had invested. Financial institutions from which he had obtained financing and to which he had provided guarantees pulled their lines of credit and called on him to fulfil his obligations. One of them, Citibank Singapore Limited (\u201cCitibank\u201d), filed a bankruptcy application against him in February 2016.', '4\\u2003In May 2016, the applicant made an application under s 45(1) of the Bankruptcy Act for an interim order in connection with a proposal he wanted to make to his creditors for a voluntary arrangement which would have the effect of a compromise in satisfaction of debts amounting to approximately S$191m. He proposed to pay these creditors a total amount of S$1.5m in three tranches over 26 months. He had secured an interest free loan from a business associate to fund the payment.', '5\\u2003The interim order was granted on 24 May 2016. The effect of an interim order is set out in s 45(3) of the Act, which provides that:', '(3) An interim order shall have the effect that, during the period for which it is in force \u2013', '(a) \\u2003where the interim order is in respect of an individual debtor \u2013', '6\\u2003The Act requires that proposals for voluntary arrangement include the appointment of a person called a \u201cnominee\u201d, who has certain statutory duties such as to prepare a report on the debtor\u2019s proposal for submission to the court. The nominee for the applicant\u2019s voluntary arrangement was an accountant. He duly submitted his report on the applicant\u2019s proposal as required under the Act. The court permitted a creditors\u2019 meeting to be called. The creditors\u2019 meeting was chaired by the nominee but the applicant did not attend. This resulted in an another meeting where the applicant was asked to attend so that he could address issues raised by some creditors. At this adjourned creditors\u2019 meeting, the voluntary arrangement was approved by the requisite majority of the creditors.', '7\\u2003Several creditors who had voted against the approval of the voluntary arrangement then applied to court for the approval to be set aside. Their applications were granted by an Assistant Registrar on 8 March 2017. His grounds of decision are reported in Re Aathar Ah Kong Andrew [2017] SGHCR 4.', '8\\u2003The applicant appealed against this decision, but withdrew his appeal on the date scheduled for the hearing of the appeal. He then filed an application on 21 June 2017 for another interim order under s 45(1) of the Act on the basis that he was making a new proposal to his creditors for a voluntary arrangement. Under this new proposal, the applicant would now pay a total of S$3m, which he would borrow, to his creditors in five tranches over 50 months. This proposal now covered creditors to whom the applicant owed a total amount of approximately S$317m. For this second proposal, the applicant appointed a senior lawyer as his nominee.', '9\\u2003On 11 July 2017, the court granted the interim order. This was the interim order in question which the applicant was applying to extend in the Registrar\u2019s Appeal before me. But before I come to that application, it is important to recount what transpired in relation to this second proposal for a voluntary arrangement.', '10\\u2003The nominee submitted his report in September 2017. The first creditors\u2019 meeting was held on 5 October 2017. This meeting was adjourned after questions were raised by creditors on various issues. The creditors voted on the proposal at the adjourned creditors\u2019 meeting on 19 October 2017. On 20 and 25 October 2017, the nominee wrote to the creditors to inform them that the voluntary arrangement had been approved by the requisite majority of creditors. In the process of ascertaining whether the threshold had been crossed, the nominee accorded no value to certain litigation claims and he admitted a creditor\u2019s claim of approximately S$20m which he had previously adjudicated as being unsupported by documents.', '11\\u2003Four creditors, who had objected to the voluntary arrangement, then filed applications under s 54 of the Act to set aside the creditors\u2019 approval of the voluntary arrangement. These were (i) CIMB Securities (Singapore) Pte Ltd (\u201cCIMB\u201d); (ii) Citibank; (iii) KGI Securities (Singapore) Pte Ltd (\u201cKGI\u201d); and (iv) OUE Lippo Healthcare Limited (\u201cOUELH\u201d), formerly known as International Healthway Corporation Ltd.', '12\\u2003The applications were heard in the first instance by Valerie Thean J on 14 March 2018. After hearing parties, Thean J held that s 54(1)(b) of the Act was satisfied in that there were material irregularities in the conduct of the creditors\u2019 meeting, arising from the nominee\u2019s decisions and the applicant\u2019s lack of disclosure. The judge accordingly set aside the approval for the voluntary arrangement at the hearing and directed that no further creditors\u2019 meetings be held. As mentioned earlier, the grounds of Thean J\u2019s decision are in Re Aathar Ah Kong Andrew [2018] SGHC 124.', '13\\u2003The applicant appealed against Thean J\u2019s decision. He felt it necessary to file a total of four appeals \u2013 Civil Appeal Nos 60 to 63 of 2018 \u2013 because each of the creditors named at [11] above had filed a separate application to set aside the creditors\u2019 approval, all of which had been allowed. Following this, the applicant then filed the application seeking an extension of the interim order made on 11 July 2017 until the determination of his four appeals by the Court of Appeal. The extension sought was pursuant to s 45(4) of the Act.'"}

Consequently, TMTA suffered losses amounting to US$70,000 which was subsequently increased to US$81,500 (\u201cthe Principal Sum\u201d)', '8\\u2003TMTA also alleged a second cause of action based on the defendants\u2019 fraudulent misrepresentation of iron ore prices and\/or freight prices on certain Capesize routes. The misrepresentation was alleged to have arisen from the defendants\u2019 manipulative conduct.', '9\\u2003The defendants denied the claim and the loss.', '10\\u2003The action was initially commenced on 22 February 2013 in the District Court. The defendants then filed Originating Summons No 366 of 2013 on 25 April 2013 to transfer the action to the High Court. The reasons given by defendants for the application to transfer were that it was a case of unusual complexity and\/or it raised issues of public interest and\/or important questions of law which ought to be decided by the High Court. 2', 'The issues of public interest and\/or important questions of law involved an allegation by TMTA that FFAs were futures contracts dealt on a futures market in Singapore, and that the defendants\u2019 manipulative conduct was a breach of s 208(a) of the Securities and Futures Act (Cap 289, 2006 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe Act\u201d). TMTA was not agreeable to the transfer. The claim then was for US$70,000 (later revised to US$81,500). On 12 June 2013, the High Court allowed the application to transfer the action to the High Court.', '11\\u2003On 25 January 2016, Rajah & Tann Singapore LLP (\u201cR&T\u201d), the lawyers for the defendants, wrote to KhattarWong LLP (\u201cKW\u201d), the lawyers for TMTA, with an open offer (\u201cthe Open Offer\u201d). In summary, the letter noted that BHPB had obtained an order dated 16 November 2012 in England which adjudged TMTA to owe BHPB an amount in excess of US$100 million (\u201cthe English Judgment\u201d). This judgment had been registered as a judgment in the Singapore High Court in Originating Summons No 729 of 2015 (\u201cOS 729\/2015\u201d). This order of registration was made on 11 August 2015.', '12\\u2003The letter maintained that TMTA\u2019s allegations in the Singapore action were baseless but made an open offer to settle TMTA\u2019s claim on terms that the defendants would pay the Principal Sum with interest and costs. The payment would be made by way of set-off against the judgment sum under the English Judgment. The offer was open for acceptance till 4pm of 1 February 2016. Athough there was some correspondence from KW which I will elaborate on later, the fact was that the offer was not accepted by TMTA.', '13\\u2003On 2 March 2016, the defendants filed Summons No 979 of 2016 (\u201cSUM 979\/2016) to strike out TMTA\u2019s claim on account of the Open Offer. The application was heard on 26 May 2016 by Assistant Registrar Lim Sai Nei (\u201cAR Lim\u201d) who dismissed it. The defendants did not file an appeal against this decision.', '14\\u2003Instead, parties proceeded to the discovery stage and engaged in various interlocutory steps including an application by TMTA for discovery of various electronic documents, which was not proceeded with. On the other hand, the defendants filed Summons No 2853 of 2017 on 22 June 2017 for an order that they need not disclose any of their emails at the general discovery stage. This application was dismissed by an Assistant Registrar but allowed on appeal to me, as I was of the view that such discovery was not necessary or appropriate in the light of discovery of other documents which the defendants would be making.', '15\\u2003Subsequently, on 23 May 2018, TMTA filed Summons No 2397 of 2018 for discovery of various documents in eight categories from the defendants.', '16\\u2003In turn, the defendants filed Summons No 2887 of 2018 on 25 June 2018 to strike out TMTA\u2019s claim under O 18 r 19 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R5, 2006 Rev Ed) (\u201cROC\u201d) or the inherent jurisdiction of the court, on the ground that the claim was frivolous or vexatious or an abuse of the process of the court.', '17\\u2003Both applications were fixed for hearing before me on 3 August 2018. On that day, I directed that pursuant to O 14 r 12 and\/or O 33 r 2 of the ROC, a preliminary point or issue be decided first. The preliminary point or issue was whether TMTA is entitled or should be permitted to continue with the action in the light of the Open Offer and, if not, what the appropriate order should be. I adjourned the hearing to a date to be fixed by the Registrar. The two applications were adjourned pending the outcome of the preliminary point or issue.', '18\\u2003The date for hearing of the preliminary point or issue was fixed for 29 August 2018. At that hearing, I informed counsel that an alternative way of framing the issue was whether the continuance of the action was an abuse of the process of the court in the light of the Open Offer. After hearing submissions, I decided that TMTA was not entitled and should not be permitted to continue with the action in the light of the Open Offer. In other words, it was an abuse of process for TMTA to do so. I therefore struck out TMTA\u2019s claim in the action. I allowed parties to try and agree on the issue of costs and the quantum thereof failing which they could submit on costs on a date which had already been reserved in the event that an additional hearing date after 29 August 2018 was necessary. I add that TMTA subsequently indicated that it intended to appeal against my decision. Accordingly, the parties agreed to defer the question of costs pending the outcome of TMTA\u2019s appeal to the Court of Appeal.'"}

Mr Bajaj firmly rejected this suggestion and insisted on a face to face meeting in August. 21', '14\\u2003On 4 and 19 August, Mr Akhtar contacted Mr Bajaj to confirm a meeting date. Mr Bajaj once again failed to respond. 22', '15\\u2003On 26 August 2015 Mr Akhtar consulted SMC on how to proceed. SMC recommended that he proceed to issue his opinion in light of the fact that the matter had become unduly protracted. Mr Akhtar wrote to both parties on 13 October 2015 stating that since Mr Bajaj had refused to provide reasonable alternative dates for a clarification hearing, Mr Akhtar would issue his opinion on the basis of the documents submitted to date. 23', '16\\u2003The next day, 14 October 2015, Mr Bajaj finally responded, stating that he would not accept Mr Akhtar\u2019s opinion unless he was given a chance to be heard. Mr Bajaj subsequently began alleging bias on the part of Mr Akhtar and wrote to the SMC and Mr Ueda\u2019s solicitors, proposing that Mr Akhtar be replaced. His proposal was rejected by both the SMC and Mr Ueda. Mr Akhtar continued to engage Mr Bajaj but Mr Bajaj refused to reciprocate, maintaining his position that Mr Akhtar was biased. Mr Akhtar, with the support of SMC, wrote to Mr Bajaj and informed him that he would proceed to issue his report on 27 November 2015 if Mr Bajaj did not meet him prior to this. 24', '17\\u2003Mr Bajaj finally met Mr Akhtar for a clarification hearing on 25 November 2015. During this meeting, Mr Bajaj raised reservations that he had no access to certain source documents of the Hachiman Entities and the reliability of the accounts provided by Mr Ueda. 25', 'For the first time, Mr Bajaj expressed a concern that the accounting records did not reflect a loan given by Hachiman Cayman to TY Japan (\u201cHachiman Loan\u201d).', '18\\u2003 To address these concerns, Mr Akhtar went to Tricor\u2019s offices in January 2016 to review the accounting records of Hachiman Cayman maintained by Tricor. Mr Akhtar appeared to be satisfied with the accounts after his review. In particular, he examined the accounting records for the Hachiman Loan and found that it had been repaid, and hence was rightfully no longer reflected on the accounts. 26', 'He emailed parties his results with various detailed working documents enclosed on 24 February 2016.', '19\\u2003Mr Bajaj did not query Mr Akhtar\u2019s calculations or working documents. He remained dissatisfied, however, and wanted further access to the source documents. Mr Ueda initially resisted Mr Bajaj\u2019s requests for the source documents. Finally, however, at Mr Akhtar\u2019s request, Mr Ueda in June 2016 instructed Tricor to provide access to the documents they had available and also wrote to Kaneyama, authorising Kaneyama to release all document relevant to the Hachiman Entities. 27', 'It appears that Kaneyama did not respond to Mr Bajaj\u2019s subsequent requests for documents. 28', '20\\u2003Tricor retrieved further documents from a warehouse and forwarded copies of the documents to Mr Bajaj in August 2016. 29', 'The documents received by Mr Bajaj from Tricor were, nonetheless, not to his satisfaction. Broadly, Mr Bajaj wanted two further sets of documents.', '21\\u2003First, certain documents kept by Cayman National Bank (\u201cCNB\u201d) in relation to Hachiman Cayman\u2019s bank account with CNB including: 30', '(a)\\u2003Bank statements from CNB for the months of July, August, November and December 2010;', '(b)\\u2003CNB debit advice slips for the 4th quarter of 2010;', '(c)\\u2003Hachiman Singapore Wire Instructions for the 4th quarter of 2010.', '22\\u2003Second, certain documents rendered and managed by Kaneyama in relation to TY Japan for the period of June 2010 to March 2011. These documents included: 31', '(a)\\u2003TY Japan\u2019s general ledger of accounts and invoices;', '(b)\\u2003TY Japan\u2019s monthly balance sheet;', '(c)\\u2003TY Japan\u2019s payroll account statements and government pension contributions;', '(d)\\u2003TY Japan\u2019s tax invoices of sub-advisory services rendered to Hachiman Cayman;', '(e)\\u2003TY Japan\u2019s trust account statements with Kaneyama; and', '(f)\\u2003TY Japan\u2019s other deposit statements.', '23\\u2003I shall refer to the documents collectively as the \u201cCNB and Kaneyama Documents\u201d.', '24\\u2003Mr Bajaj insisted that without the CNB and Kaneyama Documents to verify the accounts rendered by Tricor, Tables X and Y would be populated with \u201cfalse information\u201d. 32', 'Hachiman Cayman\u2019s CNB bank account had, however, been terminated, and Mr Ueda had no access to the statements unless he opened the account again. Mr Ueda\u2019s position was that these documents were not in his possession or power and he had no obligation to procure them. 33', '25\\u2003This impasse continued throughout 2016 and 2017. In September and October 2016, SMC attempted to arrange a meeting between the parties and Mr Akhtar, but these attempts were unsuccessful. In November 2016, SMC proposed a meeting between the parties, Mr Akhtar, and the Mediator. Mr Ueda agreed to attend. 34', 'Mr Bajaj, on the other hand, responded on 19 and 21 November 2016, refusing to attend any meeting until he received the CNB and Kaneyama Documents. Mr Bajaj also raised a new allegation: that Mr Ueda had wound up Hachiman Singapore without his consent, and may have sequestered around $150,000. Mr Bajaj used this allegation as further grounds for refusing to consent to any meeting between the parties, Mr Akhtar and the Mediator. Over the period of December 2016 to April 2017, the parties exchanged emails, but no progress was made. Mr Bajaj continued to demand the outstanding documents and allege impropriety in the winding up of Hachiman Singapore. Mr Ueda rebutted Mr Bajaj\u2019s allegations while acknowledging that Mr Bajaj was free to present his allegations in an appropriate forum. 35', '26\\u2003In May 2017, Mr Akhtar made a final attempt to get the parties to return to mediation but stated that if they did not agree to return to mediation, he would issue a report with appropriate qualifications. Mr Ueda disagreed, as he \u201c[did] not consider that parties will realistically make any headway by returning to mediation after such extended correspondence on various issues and having explored the various approaches suggested by [Mr Akhtar] \u2026\u201d. 36', 'Mr Bajaj replied in an email dated 14 May 2017. 37', 'He agreed to return to mediation, stating that: \u201c[Mr Akhtar\u2019s] issuance of a qualified calculation would invalidate the agreement that I made with Mr Ueda and I am therefore willing to return to mediation in an attempt to get him to release the access to the source information such that a non qualified statement can be obtained\u201d. Mr Bajaj insisted that even a qualified report could not be issued due to various alleged improprieties on the part of Mr Ueda, including: 38', '(a)\\u2003the allegation that Mr Ueda wound up Hachiman Singapore without his consent and funds in Hachiman Singapore were not accounted for;', '(b)\\u2003the allegation that Mr Ueda had not accounted for funds that were left in the accounts of the TY Entities. Mr Bajaj\u2019s position was that the TY Entities was put into liquidation sometime around mid-2010. 39', 'Hence the suggestion appeared to be that Mr Ueda had sequestered all funds remaining in the accounts of the TY Entities, which was improper because Mr Bajaj, as a shareholder of TY Cayman, was entitled to a share of the funds.', '27\\u2003Mr Akhtar stressed in his reply on 29 June 2017 that the winding up of Hachiman Singapore occurred after 2011 and hence the issues surrounding the winding up was outside of his remit, which was merely to obtain net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d) figures for Hachiman Cayman in 2010 and 2011, populate Tables X and Y, and calculate the Settlement Amount. Nevertheless, Mr Akhtar requested a response from Mr Ueda on the allegation pertaining to the funds left in the accounts of the TY Entities. Mr Ueda\u2019s reply was that any issue pertaining to the accounts of the TY Entities was entirely irrelevant to the NAV of Hachiman Cayman, since TY Cayman was neither a parent company nor a subsidiary of Hachiman Cayman. In his opinion, it was outside of the scope of Mr Akhtar\u2019s remit. Mr Ueda reiterated his position that Mr Bajaj ought to pursue his allegations in a separate action if he wished to do so. 40', 'The parties continued to exchange emails on this without any resolution.', '28\\u2003On 31 July 2017, Mr Akhtar attempted to remedy the impasse by seeking additional supporting documents that pertained to the transactions between Hachiman Cayman and the TY Entities. Tricor confirmed that they did not have any further documents. 41', 'On 31 August 2017, Mr Akhtar informed the parties of this development, and also reiterated that events pertaining to the winding up of Hachiman Singapore were outside his remit. On the same day, Mr Bajaj replied that Tables X and Y could not be \u201cpopulated with false information\u201d and stated that he would \u201cseparately contact\u201d the Mediator and the SMC. 42', '29\\u2003On 25 September 2017, Mr Bajaj demanded that Mr Akhtar halt his activities until Mr Bajaj managed to contact the Mediator to \u201cgive guidance on next steps\u201d stating that \u201cI will keep everyone updated on the outcome of contact with the mediator, if he does not do so himself first\u201d. While SMC did communicate Mr Bajaj\u2019s request to the Mediator, and contact details were exchanged, Mr Akhtar did not receive any further communication regarding this. Hence he issued a qualified Neutral Evaluation Report on 23 November 2017 (the \u201cReport\u201d). 43', '30\\u2003The Report would only be released to the parties upon payment of all outstanding amounts owing to the Neutral and SMC. Clause 6 of the Settlement Agreement provided that fees and expenses should be borne equally. Mr Bajaj refused to pay his share of the fees. Eventually, on 2 March 2018, Mr Ueda paid for Mr Bajaj\u2019s share of the fees, being the sum of S$32,399.60, in order to procure the release of the Report. 44', '31\\u2003Mr Akhtar\u2019s Report was released on 7 March 2017 and an amendment was made on 14 March 2017, clarifying a typographical error. 45', 'Nothing turns on the clarification, there was no dispute regarding the sum as corrected. The population of Tables X and Y and final calculations resulted in a sum of US$226,481.92 payable by Mr Bajaj to Mr Ueda. 46', 'As allowed by the Neutral Evaluation Rules, the Report was qualified to explain Mr Akhtar\u2019s constraints.', '32\\u2003Following the issue of Mr Akhtar\u2019s Report, Mr Ueda\u2019s solicitors wrote to Mr Bajaj on 9 April 2018 to demand payment of his share of Mr Akhtar\u2019s fees. They also wrote to Mr Bajaj on the same date to demand payment of sums owing under the Settlement Agreement. Mr Bajaj ignored both letters. 47', 'Accordingly, Mr Ueda served the Statutory Demand on 17 April 2018 on Mr Bajaj demanding payment for three debts: 48', '(a)\\u2003The debt of US$50,000 pursuant to Clause 10 of the Settlement Agreement (the \u201cClause 10 Debt\u201d);', '(b)\\u2003The Settlement Amount of US$226,481.92 pursuant to Clause 3 of the Settlement Agreement; and', '(c)\\u2003Mr Bajaj\u2019s share of the fees under Clause 6 of the Settlement Agreement, being S$32.399.60 (the \u201cClause 6 Debt\u201d).', '33\\u2003This was the Statutory Demand that Mr Bajaj applied to set aside.'"}

It would also form the relevant background for evaluating the second alternative defence that the accused had purchased and possessed the 27.61 g of diamorphine because he was doing so in compliance with a command hallucination.', '54\\u2003Apart from the diagnoses, the existence of such mental disorders may also inform the court as to the veracity of the accused\u2019s factual assertions as to whether he was hearing \u201cvoices\u201d and whether his ability to resist acting on the instructions of these \u201cvoices\u201d was affected.', '55\\u2003Further, as the presence of hallucinations is a key symptom of SIPD, I will first consider the evidence concerning the accused\u2019s claim to have experienced hallucinations before turning to consider the remaining evidence concerning whether the accused was suffering from SIPD and\/or SIDD.', 'The accused was probably hearing voices, but these did not amount to hallucinations', 'The accused was more likely than not hearing voices', '56\\u2003I was prepared to accept that it was probable that the accused did hear a \u201cvoice\u201d in his head from time to time. In this regard, the Prosecution had suggested that the accused\u2019s failure to mention that he was hearing voices in his first statement on 22 February 2015 meant that any account of \u201cvoices\u201d that appeared in his later recorded statements were afterthoughts. 91', 'While I accepted that the accused\u2019s first statement did not strictly mention \u201cvoices\u201d, I note that the cautioned statement nevertheless included such details as the accused claiming that the drugs were \u201cmeant for [his] own consumption because [he had] a tendency of committing suicide through those drugs\u201d and that he was \u201csuffering from schizophrenia\u201d. 92', '57\\u2003On balance, I did not think it necessary to draw an adverse inference. Although the first statement left out a specific detail, it was not quite a complete omission: see Public Prosecutor v Saridewi bte Djamani and another [2018] SGHC 204 at [60]. I gave the accused the benefit of the doubt that certain aspects of his defence was somewhat encapsulated in the allegations of \u201ccommitting suicide\u201d and \u201cschizophrenia\u201d: see Yap Giau Beng Terence v Public Prosecutor [1998] 2 SLR(R) 855 at [38].', '58\\u2003 In any event, there was some degree of contemporaneity as the accused did complain about hearing voices soon after his first statement was recorded. I note that Investigation Officer Ranjeet Ram Behari\u2019s letter to the Prisons Complex Medical Centre on 25 February 2015 stated that the accused \u201cclaimed that he was hearing voices and claims not to be mentally stable as he has not been consuming his psychiatric medications for the past few months prior to his arrest.\u201d 93', '59\\u2003I was also prepared to accept Calvin and Ryan\u2019s testimony that the accused was seen at times mumbling to himself.

So, I\u2019m not so sure he was thinking about anything.\u201d', '61\\u2003Admittedly, Ryan\u2019s testimony was not conclusive. While he testified that the accused looked too high to be able to think, he also failed to directly answer the Prosecution\u2019s question on whether the accused was merely simply taking to himself. On balance, given Calvin\u2019s and Ryan\u2019s observations, I was not prepared to conclude that the accused\u2019s account of hearing \u201cvoices\u201d was a complete fabrication.', 'The voices the accused was hearing would not amount to hallucinations', '62\\u2003Even though I accepted the accused could have been hearing voices, this did not necessarily mean his symptoms met a diagnosis of hallucinations at the material time. The following psychiatric evidence was relevant:', '(a)\\u2003The Prosecution relied on the opinion of Dr Gupta, who testified that the accused was not experiencing hallucinations.

Hallucinations were not subject to conscious manipulation, and could not be readily controlled or easily dismissed. Significant to a diagnosis would be whether the patient lacked insight into the imaginary nature of the voice, and how much control the patient had over the voice. 104', 'Any one criterion would not in itself lead to a diagnosis for or against hallucinations, but a combination of the criteria had to be considered; 105', '(b)\\u2003Dr Winslow agreed that psychiatrists would \u201cusually try to differentiate voices in the objective space\u201d as opposed to the subjective space (ie, a voice that was heard inside of one\u2019s head). 106', 'However, he did not fully engage with this distinction. Instead, he stated that what was important was what the patient believed about the voice, whether they took it seriously, and whether they could ignore it at any time; 107', 'and', '(c)\\u2003Dr Ung concurred that a \u201ctrue\u201d auditory hallucination would be a voice which was perceived by the patient as coming from the objective space and in respect of which the patient had no insight that the voice was imaginary. If a patient perceived the voice in his internal space or he had insight that the voice may not be real, then he would be diagnosed with \u201cpseudo-hallucinations\u201d. 108', '66\\u2003It was clear from the totality of the psychiatric evidence that two relevant features in diagnosing a hallucination would be whether a patient perceived the voices in the objective or subjective space, and whether a patient had insight that the voices were imaginary.', '67\\u2003In the present case, I was of the view that even if the accused was hearing voices at the material time, the voices would have been perceived in the subjective space. I was also of the view that the accused had insight into the nature of the voices. Hence, proceeding along the common ground outlined above, I found that there was insufficient basis to support a diagnosis of hallucinations.', '68\\u2003I find it significant that the accused consistently maintained in his recorded statements to IO Shafiq (in March 2015) that the voice was from \u201cinside\u201d his head. 109', 'When examined by Dr Gupta (in March 2015), the accused also told him that the voice was heard in the subjective space. 110', '69\\u2003It seemed to me that the first time the accused had mentioned the voice as being heard from outside his head was only two years later, to Dr Winslow (in February and March 2017). 111', 'Given these inconsistencies, I accepted the Prosecution\u2019s submission that the accused was tailoring his account of the \u201cvoice\u201d to adopt features that would make it seem as though he had been experiencing hallucinations. 112', '70\\u2003I should mention that Dr Ung had testified that: 113', 'Q:\\u2003\u2026So are you able to tell that when [the accused] told you that he\u2019s hearing voices, that it\u2019s pseudo-hallucination or it\u2019s real hallucination?', 'A:\\u2003From---from the way he describe it to me at that time, it sounded like a true hallucination. He was hearing it from external space of, you know, somebody---a voice speaking to him.', '71\\u2003However, an examination of the documentary evidence does not reveal that the accused had told Dr Ung that he was hearing the voice from the \u201cexternal space\u201d. Dr Ung\u2019s clinical notes of the only occasion he examined the accused (on 26 February 2015) simply recorded that the accused \u201c[complained of] male voice \u2013 one voice \u2013 abusing me \u2013 \u2018people harm me and back stab me\u2019\u201d. 114', '72\\u2003In his first report issued on 11 April 2017, Dr Ung recounted exactly the same details as he had recorded during the examination on 26 February 2015. His second report issued on 10 July 2017 did not contain any further details about what the accused had told him about the \u201cvoice\u201d during the examination. It would therefore appear that Dr Ung was not actually told by the accused that he had heard the voice in the objective space. Instead, what I gathered from Dr Ung\u2019s testimony (at [70] above) was simply that he had formed the impression that the accused was hearing the voice from the \u201cexternal space\u201d because the accused had reported that \u201csomebody---a voice\u201d was speaking to him.', '73\\u2003This was confirmed by the accused\u2019s repeated concessions on the stand.

This explanation was disingenuous. If we went along with the logic of this explanation, every conversation which the accused had with a real person should also be described by him as voices in his head.', '76\\u2003Dr Gupta confirmed that his detailed discussions with the accused showed that, most of the time, the accused retained insight that the \u201cvoices\u201d were not real phenomena. 117', 'This meant that, irrespective of whether the accused was hearing voices in the subjective or objective space, the accused was at best only experiencing \u201cpseudo-hallucinations\u201d.', '77\\u2003In the round, I accepted Dr Gupta\u2019s assessment that two of the most important factors in deciding whether or not someone was experiencing a hallucination had not been met. 118', '78\\u2003The methodology of the experts was an additional factor that I had considered in my findings on the existence of hallucinations. In essence, the accuracy of any diagnosis depended upon the truthfulness of the accused\u2019s account of his symptoms. 119', 'The experts were in agreement that where there may be inconsistency, it was necessary to look to alternative sources of information and to ask detailed questions to elicit a fuller picture of the patient\u2019s symptoms. 120', '79\\u2003In my view, Dr Winslow had not adequately verified the accused\u2019s account of his symptoms. For example, despite having access to Dr Gupta\u2019s observation that the voice was perceived subjectively, Dr Winslow did not question the accused when he was told that the voice was perceived objectively. 121', 'Dr Winslow also did not elicit further details about whether the accused thought the voices were imaginary or real, 122', 'or about the accused\u2019s inconsistent accounts about whether he had control over the \u201cvoice\u201d. 123', '80\\u2003I did not think this was a sufficiently rigorous assessment. This was especially since Dr Winslow acknowledged that these inconsistent symptoms were relevant to a diagnosis of hallucinations. 124', 'I was not persuaded by Dr Winslow\u2019s explanation that it was not realistic to expect drug addicts to provide consistent or truthful answers all the time. 125', 'I would have expected that given the relevance of the symptoms, it would have been all the more necessary for Dr Winslow to ascertain which symptoms the accused was actually evincing in order to arrive at an accurate diagnosis.', '81\\u2003Dr Ung examined the accused as a treating prison psychiatrist. As Dr Ung explained on the stand, his role at the time was to treat the patient and not to conduct a forensic assessment. Thus, even though there were no objective symptoms, he went ahead and prescribed Risperidone, an anti-psychotic drug, to the accused solely on the strength of the accused\u2019s subjective complaint. As a treating psychiatrist, he would give the patient the benefit of the doubt as there was a greater danger of not treating an actual psychosis than to have given anti-psychotic drugs to someone who had no psychosis. 126', 'In my view, any diagnosis or assessment made in such circumstances would naturally carry less weight than a diagnosis made after a forensic assessment of the type carried out by Dr Gupta.', '82\\u2003As for Dr Ung\u2019s second report, he depended on both his initial assessment and the veracity of the facts as related to Dr Winslow. 127', 'Any mendacity on the part of the accused to Dr Winslow would similarly have affected the validity of Dr Ung\u2019s diagnosis. In any event, I had doubts regarding the accused\u2019s internally inconsistent (at [68]-[69] above) and externally inconsistent (at [131]-[140] below) accounts.', '83\\u2003In contrast, Dr Gupta\u2019s assessment started with open-ended, general questions, which were progressively narrowed down to clarify any missing information. 128', 'In doing so, Dr Gupta managed to elicit further details about the accused\u2019s symptoms where necessary. 129', 'In my view, such an approach was more helpful in presenting a more complete and careful picture to the court of the bases upon which a psychiatrist had arrived at his diagnoses.', '84\\u2003I also note that given that Dr Winslow had assessed the accused only two years after the offence, his assessment was relatively disadvantaged. 130', 'This was a factor outside of Dr Winslow\u2019s control, but nevertheless the passage of time may mean that a patient\u2019s memory would no longer be accurate. 131', 'The accused was not suffering from SIPD or SIDD at the material time', '85\\u2003I preface my observations by stating that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\u2019 (American Psychiatric Press, 5th Ed, 2013) (\u201cDSM-V\u201d) criteria for diagnosing SIDD and SIPD was a common basis adopted during the trial. 132', 'The psychiatrists had either assessed the accused, 133', 'or given their expert opinion on the stand with reference to these criteria. 134', '86\\u2003Under the DSM-V, the following criteria had to be cumulatively met for a diagnosis of SIPD:', 'A.\\u2003Presence of one or both of the following symptoms:', '1.\\u2003Delusions.', '2.\\u2003Hallucinations.', 'B.\\u2003There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings of both (1) and (2):', '1.\\u2003The symptoms in Criterion A developed soon or after substance intoxication or withdrawal or exposure to a medication.', '2.\\u2003The involved substance\/medication is capable of producing the symptoms in Criterion A.', 'C.\\u2003The disturbance is not better explained by a psychotic disorder that is not substance\/medication-induced.

In this regard, I agreed that the probative weight of the accused\u2019s prior diagnoses had to be balanced against this lack of information.', '92\\u2003In any case, the fundamental question to be determined remained whether the accused was suffering a mental disorder at the material time, which would depend on the presentation of his symptoms during this time. 142', 'It is to these symptoms that I now turn.', 'The accused\u2019s symptoms did not meet \u201cCriterion A\u201d for a diagnosis of SIPD under the DSM-V', '93\\u2003All three psychiatrists were in agreement that, in the absence of evidence of delusions, a diagnosis of hallucinations was necessary to fulfil \u201cCriterion A\u201d for a diagnosis of SIPD. 143', 'It follows from my acceptance of Dr Gupta\u2019s view at [77] above that I should also find that the accused had not met this criterion.', '94\\u2003I note Dr Ung was of the contrary view that \u201cpseudo-hallucinations\u201d were significant symptoms to point toward \u201csome form of [a] mental disorder\u201d 144', 'and a symptom of SIPD. 145', 'For completeness, I accepted Dr Gupta\u2019s view that \u201cpseudo-hallucinations\u201d did not contribute much by way of diagnostic significance. 146', '95\\u2003I should add that the Prosecution alluded to Dr Gupta\u2019s testimony that SIPD would typically resolve at least partially within one month and fully within six months. 147', 'This is inconsistent with the accused\u2019s claim that when he was in remand for a prior drug trafficking charge for more than a year from May 2013 to September 2014, he was still hearing voices. 148', 'Since the accused should have no access to drugs while in remand, he should not still be experiencing drug-induced hallucinations. 149', 'I also note that Dr Ung had also suggested that it was common in SIPD that upon cessation of methamphetamine consumption, the symptoms would subside within the first two weeks. 150', '96\\u2003The accused had also told Dr Gupta that the more methamphetamine he smoked, the softer the voices became. 151', 'Even Dr Winslow opined that this was not logical, as the more methamphetamine one smoked, the more symptoms they should display. 152', '97\\u2003In my view, the discrepancies highlighted in the preceding two paragraphs made the accused\u2019s account of his symptoms less believable, thus further weakening the factual basis for a diagnosis of SIPD.', 'The accused\u2019s symptoms were equivocal with regard to \u201cCriterion E\u201d for a diagnosis of both SIPD or SIDD under the DSM-V', '98\\u2003Under the DSM-V, a diagnosis of SIDD or SIPD required a patient to fulfil \u201cCriterion E\u201d:', 'E.\\u2003The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.', '[Emphasis added.]', 'There are two limbs to Criterion E \u2013 \u201cclinically significant distress\u201d or \u201cclinically significant impairment\u201d.

Among other things, the accused sent voluminous messages and calls, did mathematical calculations, and made appointments with various people. 153', 'There was no evidence of impairment of cognitive, emotional, physical, or social functioning. 154', '100\\u2003The Prosecution further submitted that the accused did not appear to show clinically significant distress. Dr Gupta\u2019s evidence was that any sleep and appetite changes were related to drug use. Dr Gupta agreed that around the material time, the accused\u2019s numerous calls to his clients and supplier, the arrangements to meet Calvin and Ryan for the reunion lunch, his concealment of his address from Calvin after the reunion lunch to prevent Calvin from knowing he was back to selling drugs, 155', 'and the content of the accused\u2019s messages \u2013 to a female friend \u2013 did not suggest that he had depressive symptoms that would warrant a diagnosis of SIDD. 156', '101\\u2003I agreed with the Prosecution that the accused\u2019s phone messages and other social activities showed mental acuity rather than impairment in any areas of functioning. In particular, Dr Ung and Dr Winslow were asked to examine the accused\u2019s phone messages, his ability to perform mathematical calculations to his drug client, and the fact that he had the presence of mind to ask the client to delete the message thereafter. 157', 'Dr Ung agreed some of these activities would go against the finding that he was severely impaired. 158', 'Dr Winslow initially insisted that the accused was cognitively impaired, but later conceded that given the evidence of the accused\u2019s activities, it was \u201cpossible\u201d that even if he was hearing voices it was not to the extent of \u201csignificant impairment\u201d as Dr Winslow had initially diagnosed. 159', '102\\u2003On the other hand, it seemed that the evidence was more equivocal on whether the accused was significantly distressed.

For completeness, I should add that, even if I were to give the accused the benefit of the doubt on \u201cCriterion E\u201d, his overall symptoms would still not have satisfied the criteria for SIPD or SIDD as the accused\u2019s symptoms did not fulfil Criterion A for SIPD and the Note for SIPD and SIDD (see below).', 'The accused\u2019s symptoms did not fulfil the \u201cNote\u201d for a diagnosis of SIPD or SIDD under the DSM-V', '104\\u2003The Prosecution relied on Dr Gupta\u2019s opinion that under the \u201cNote\u201d to the DSM-V, any hallucinations or depressive symptoms (\u201cCriterion A\u201d for both SIPD or SIDD) had to \u201cpredominate in the clinical picture and [had to be] sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention\u201d (emphasis added) apart from any drug dependence, drug intoxication, or drug withdrawal. 163', '105\\u2003Dr Gupta opined that even if the voices experienced by the accused were indeed hallucinations, they did not predominate the clinical picture. Instead, it was the accused\u2019s heavy drug use and dependence that did. 164', 'Similarly, the accused did not display any depressive symptoms that would not already be covered by a separate diagnosis of drug use, intoxication, or withdrawal. 165', '106\\u2003The Prosecution also submitted that Dr Winslow\u2019s approach should be faulted for failing to apply the \u201cNote\u201d to SIPD and SIDD. 166', 'The Prosecution contended that if Dr Winslow had applied the \u201cNote\u201d, he would have similarly concluded that the accused only suffered \u2013 if at all \u2013 from substance withdrawal or intoxication instead of SIPD. 167', '107\\u2003I accepted Dr Gupta\u2019s evidence that an application of the \u201cNote\u201d was necessary for a diagnosis of SIDD or SIPD to be arrived at, and further that the accused\u2019s clinical picture was not predominated by hallucinations or depressive symptoms, but by his heavy drug use. In reaching this conclusion, I note that Dr Winslow accepted that he had not directed his mind to the \u201cNote\u201d when he was assessing the accused. 168', '108\\u2003Moreover, when Dr Winslow\u2019s attention was drawn to the \u201cNote\u201d, he candidly and rightly conceded that his initial diagnosis of SIDD was a \u201cplus-minus\u201d and he would have to \u201crethink and try [to] get more symptoms\u201d. This was because \u201cthe speed at which the symptoms dissipated\u201d when he stopped his drug use made Dr Winslow \u201chesitate on that [diagnosis]\u201d. 169', 'It seemed to me that Dr Winslow\u2019s evidence confirmed that an application of the \u201cNote\u201d was necessary, and that the evidential basis for a finding of SIDD would be shaky if it is arrived at without applying the \u201cNote\u201d.', '109\\u2003While Dr Winslow generally appeared to maintain his diagnosis, particularly in relation to SIPD, 170', 'he nevertheless agreed that the accused\u2019s clinical picture was not predominated by hallucinations or his depressed mood, but was actually predominated by his heavy drug use. 171', 'In the light of Dr Winslow\u2019s concession, I am of the view that a finding of SIPD is not sustainable.', 'There was no evidential or legal basis for the defence of unsoundness of mind', 'Absence of psychiatric evidence to support a plea of unsoundness of mind', '110\\u2003Given my findings that the accused was not suffering from SIDD or SIPD, there were no relevant mental disorders to support a finding of unsoundness of mind. While the foregoing would be sufficient to dispose of the plea of unsoundness of mind, I would add that the psychiatric evidence even taken at its highest, could not sustain a finding of unsoundness of mind. Dr Gupta was categorical in his assessment that the accused was not of unsound mind. 172', 'Dr Ung stated that he was \u201cnot making any finding of whether [the accused] was of unsound mind or not.\u201d 173', 'Dr Winslow\u2019s report also did not diagnose the accused with unsoundness of mind. At most, Dr Winslow\u2019s opinion was that the accused was suffering from an \u201cabnormality of mind\u201d arising from SIDD and SIPD, and these would have \u201csubstantially impaired [the accused\u2019s] mental responsibility for his acts\u2026\u201d 174', 'In my view, Dr Winslow\u2019s diagnosis was utilising the language of diminished responsibility going towards the sentencing discretion under s 33B(3)(b) of the MDA. There was therefore no psychiatric evidence before me that could lead to a conclusion of unsoundness of mind.', 'Conflation of the legal standard for a plea of unsoundness of mind', '111\\u2003Insofar as the Defence sought to persuade me that the test for abnormality of the mind should be applied to assess unsoundness of the mind, this appeared to be a conflation of the standards required under the two tests. The Defence referred to the decision in Rosman bin Abdullah v Public Prosecutor [2017] 1 SLR 10, which at [57] cited Phua Han Chuan Jeffery v Public Prosecutor [2016] 3 SLR 706 (\u201cJeffery Phua\u201d).', '112\\u2003However, Jeffery Phua (at [16]) stood for the opposite proposition that the Defence submitted for:', 'I now return to the area in which it is easy to get entangled in semantics, and I hope to avoid the snare even as I am compelled to consider the question of whether the applicant\u2019s mental illness and ketamine addiction had substantially \u201cimpaired his mental responsibility\u201d for his act of illegally importing controlled drugs. Mental responsibility is a broader concept than the mental element such as knowledge or intention required to constitute the offence. Section 33B(3)(b) is intended to cover a diverse range of circumstances. It is not intended to create a cascade of new legal categories. Section 33B(3)(b) does not require an inquiry into the applicant\u2019s moral cognisance in this case, but it is probably wide enough to apply to cases in which abnormality of mind leads the offender to be incapable of distinguishing right from wrong, but this is not such a case\u2026', '[Emphasis added.]', '113\\u2003As the above makes clear, Choo Han Teck J in Jeffery Phua was concerned with delineating principles applicable only to abnormality of the mind within the meaning of s 33B(3)(b) of the MDA. I accept, as Choo J had, that in some cases an abnormality of mind may be of such nature or degree as to also encompass unsoundness of mind. However, this did not mean they were co-extensive in all cases. An accused suffering from an abnormality of mind may nevertheless possess the critical faculties to know that what he was doing was wrong: see Public Prosecutor v Took Leng How [2005] 4 SLR(R) 472 at [63]. In any event, what is necessary for the plea of unsoundness of mind to succeed, even for an offence under the MDA, is that the accused was shown to have been incapable of knowing the nature of the act he was committing, or incapable of distinguishing right from wrong.', '114\\u2003In this regard, I found that apart from the lack of psychiatric evidence, the accused was in fact aware at the material time that what he was doing was illegal. Indeed, the accused accepted on the stand and in the ASOF, that he had paid the courier in large denominations because of previous concerns that counting notes in public would take time (at [21] above). 175', 'The inference to be drawn was that the accused was aware of the risk of detection of an illegal activity and was therefore taking active steps to mitigate the said risk of detection.', 'The accused was not labouring under any command hallucinations, and if he was he would have had a capacity to resist them', '115\\u2003The accused\u2019s second alternative defence was that he was \u201cfollow[ing] the instruction[s]\u201d of the \u201cvoice\u201d when he ordered the two pounds of heroin containing the 27.61 g of diamorphine. 176', 'As alluded to earlier, it was also the Defence\u2019s case (at [39] above) that from when he received the 27.61 g of diamorphine he had not deviated in his intention to commit suicide. Hence, the accused had possessed the heroin throughout for the purpose of \u201csmoking [the diamorphine] to freedom\u201d by overdosing on the drug. 177', '116\\u2003It followed from my earlier findings that since a diagnosis of hallucinations had not been made out, the accused was unlikely to have experienced a command hallucination. I had also found that the accused was not suffering from SIDD or SIPD. While the absence of SIDD and SIPD was not determinative as to whether the accused had heard a command hallucination, it meant that there were no mental disorders that could have sapped the accused\u2019s ability to resist any purported command hallucination. These findings meant that the accused could not have been acting under a command hallucination when he purchased the 27.61 g of diamorphine and kept it in his possession.', '117\\u2003For completeness, I would add that, even if I was wrong on the existence of SIPD and SIDD, I would still have rejected the second alternative defence for the following reasons:', '(a)\\u2003Even if the accused was experiencing hallucinations, he did not hear the specific formulation of the command hallucination he had alleged. According to the psychiatric evidence, this specific formulation was implausible because command hallucinations were generally short and lacked specificity;', '(b)\\u2003Even if he had heard the command hallucination as alleged, the psychiatric evidence established that the more specific the hallucination, the easier it was to resist. Indeed, the accused himself had testified to a capacity to resist the \u201cvoice\u201d;', '(c)\\u2003The accused\u2019s own account of the \u201cvoice\u201d and the degree to which he was following it was internally inconsistent; and', '(d)\\u2003Even if the accused was unable to resist the alleged command hallucination when he ordered and received the 27.61 g of diamorphine, evidence of the accused\u2019s phone records and his conduct made it clear that he had no intention of committing suicide.', '118\\u2003Hence, under all available scenarios, at the time of his arrest, the accused\u2019s possession of the diamorphine could not have been for the purposes of smoking it to commit suicide. He therefore had not displaced the presumption under s 17 of the MDA.', 'The accused\u2019s account of the voice\u2019s instructions was implausibly detailed and specific to be a command hallucination', '119\\u2003Dr Ung considered it \u201chighly implausible\u201d that the accused heard the particular formulation of command hallucination telling him to buy two pounds of heroin and smoke himself to death. 178', 'In his report, Dr Ung explained: 179', 'Dr Ung further elaborated during his testimony that: 180', '120\\u2003Thus Dr Ung was sceptical of the accused\u2019s claim to have heard a command hallucination entailing such a high level of specificity, given that command hallucinations tended to be brief and related to the goal at hand.', '121\\u2003Dr Gupta similarly concurred that, as command hallucinations were usually short and directed, it was unlikely that a command hallucination would have such a degree of detail as alleged by the accused. 181', 'Notably, Dr Winslow did not disagree that command hallucinations were simple and direct. Rather, he disagreed that the command hallucination alleged by the accused was very detailed at all. 182', '122\\u2003In my view, the alleged command hallucination was detailed and specific, not merely as to its content, but also as to its execution. From the moment the accused heard the command hallucination, various steps had to be taken to bring the task to fruition (at [20]-[22] above), including placing orders with Billa Visu, specifying quantities, taking instructions for delivery, waiting for the delivery (and the call that delivery had arrived). This was not to mention the accused\u2019s ability to recall and cater for the courier\u2019s preference for notes in large denominations to facilitate smooth payment of the transaction (see [21] above). Indeed, while the accused did not actually consume any of the 27.61 g of diamorphine from the shipment, he still took care to unbind the bundles and store them with the previous shipment of 8.81 g of diamorphine. As a whole, the accused\u2019s actions displayed a degree of planning, which made it unlikely that the accused was subject to a command hallucination. 183', 'The accused would have the ability to resist the alleged \u201cvoice\u201d', '123\\u2003I accepted Dr Ung\u2019s evidence that \u201cthe longer [the command hallucination] drags on, the more steps that it involves\u2026the more likely they would\u2026not yield to it.\u201d 184', 'It followed from the discussion (at [121]-[122] above) that given the specificity in the command and the intervening steps thereafter, the accused would have been capable of resisting any alleged hallucination.', '124\\u2003Dr Gupta was of the view that the amount of resistance may depend on such factors as the quality of the treatment the patient was receiving, and the mood which the patient was in. However, by definition, hallucinations were difficult to control, manipulate or negotiate with. 185', 'In the present case, Dr Gupta\u2019s records established that on the accused\u2019s own account he was capable of negotiating with the voice, and had around the time of the alleged offence argued with it. 186', '125\\u2003This was supported by the accused\u2019s testimony that he was generally capable of refusing and arguing with the demands of the \u201cvoice\u201d. 187', 'Indeed, on the stand, the accused stated that if he disobeyed or \u201ctalk back\u201d to the \u201cvoice\u201d he would \u201cfeel very bad\u201d. However, he also accepted that he had a choice to follow what the \u201cvoice\u201d was saying, and he was not forced to follow it. 188', '126\\u2003As to the material time, Dr Gupta\u2019s clinical notes and report indicate that the accused was arguing with the alleged command hallucination, at least after he received the 27.61 g of diamorphine: 189', 'Prior to the index offence, allegedly he heard a \u2018voice\u2019 (which allegedly \u2018came back in December 2014\/January 2015) telling him to buy 2 pounds of Heroin and to smoke till death. He bought the Heroin but then \u2018told the voice that he did not want to die and that he wants to make it up with his son\u2019.', '[Emphasis added.]', '127\\u2003Even taking the accused\u2019s account at its highest, he demonstrated a capacity to resist any alleged hallucination that told him to continue possessing the diamorphine for the purposes of smoking himself to death on it. This much was plainly obvious, since despite already being in possession of one pound of heroin, and even after receiving an additional two pounds of heroin, there was no objective evidence that the accused actually took any steps towards smoking himself to death. 190', 'The accused\u2019s conduct and testimony was internally and externally inconsistent with the alleged command hallucination', 'The accused\u2019s account of the \u201cvoice\u201d heard on 15 February 2015 was internally inconsistent', '128\\u2003The accused offered varying accounts as to the voice\u2019s effect on his actions and motivations.

For instance, in his sixth statement, the accused stated it was because he \u201cfound [he] had enough money to give to [his] lawyer and son and stop all activities and die.\u201d 193', 'Similarly, the accused told Dr Gupta that he stopped trafficking three days prior to his arrest because \u201che had enough money and he wanted to spend time with his son before serving his time for the offence he was on bail for\u201d. 194', 'Neither the sixth statement, nor his account to Dr Gupta featured the fact that he had been told by a \u201cvoice\u201d on 15 February 2015 to stop trafficking. 195', '130\\u2003 I accepted the Prosecution\u2019s submission that the accused\u2019s internally inconsistent accounts on 15 February 2015 militated contextually against any finding that he had heard and complied with the alleged command hallucination on 17 February 2015. 196', 'While I was prepared to accept that the accused may have been hearing voices, his inconsistent and varying accounts about the alleged \u201cvoice\u201d he heard on 15 February 2015 diminished his credibility as to the content, or the effect, of the voices overall.', 'The objective evidence showed the accused had no intention of committing suicide', '131\\u2003The Prosecution submitted that the objective evidence showed that the accused had no intention of halting his trafficking activities or committing suicide. I agreed. In particular, the Prosecution relied on the accused\u2019s phone records, which revealed the following:', '(a)\\u2003The accused\u2019s account that a voice told him on 15 February 2015 to stop trafficking in drugs was contradicted by 304 discrete phone records (with 136 messages or calls emanating from him) from 15 February 2015 to the time of his arrest; 197', '(b)\\u2003In particular, the accused continued to contact various persons on 15 and 16 February 2015, who were known to him as \u201cTaxi Man\u201d, \u201cBoyboy1\u201d, Prince Tai Zi\u201d and \u201cOld Man Lao\u201d. On the stand, the accused admitted that some of these were his clients. 198', 'The Prosecution suggested that these showed the accused remained very much in the business of drug trafficking. 199', '(c)\\u2003The accused\u2019s account that he was acting on the instructions of the \u201cvoice\u201d on 17 February 2015 to order two pounds of heroin was debunked by call records on 17 February 2015 showing it was Billa Visu who had contacted him, and not the other way around; 200', 'and', '(d)\\u2003The accused\u2019s purported intention to kill himself as he was \u201cjust follow[ing] the instruction\u201d of the voice on 17 February 2015 to purchase two pounds of heroin to commit suicide 201', 'flew in the face of several messages from the accused to his female friends asking to spend time with them. 202', '132\\u2003The accused\u2019s explanation for these messages and calls was that he was still receiving these numerous calls from clients who had not yet known of his decision to discontinue trafficking. 203', 'The accused denied that the messages exchanged with \u201cBoyboy1\u201d, \u201cOld Man Lao\u201d and \u201cKoon Ah\u201d were drug-related. 204', '133\\u2003However, the following messages suggested otherwise:', '134\\u2003I found the accused\u2019s explanation to be flatly contradicted by the clear drug-related content of the messages. Indeed, the accused admitted on the stand that the messages with \u201cKoon Ah\u201d were in relation to \u201cKoon Ah\u201d supplying him with \u201cice\u201d. 210', 'Nor was it a tenable explanation that the calls were from clients unaware that he had discontinued trafficking, since many of the calls and messages originated from the accused and not the other way around. 211', '135\\u2003None of the phone records or messages suggested any evidence that the accused had heard a \u201cvoice\u201d on 15 February 2015 telling him to stop trafficking, much less that after he heard the voice, he no longer wanted to sell drugs. 212', 'To the contrary, the following messages with a drug client \u201cPrince Tai Zi\u201d put paid to the accused\u2019s account:', '136\\u2003As to the critical time of the alleged command hallucination on 17 February 2015, the accused\u2019s phone records showed no pause in his trafficking activities. In fact, the Prosecution showed that on 18 February 2015, at 5:11 pm, the accused was busy ordering new supplies of drugs from Billa Visu in relation to a new drug client, \u201cHam\u201d. 213', 'When confronted with this evidence, the accused claimed that these calls were in relation to the collection of the 27.61 g of diamorphine. This explanation conflicted with the accused\u2019s own admission that he collected the 27.61 g of diamorphine several hours earlier at 10 am on 18 February 2015 (see [20] and [35] above), an admission borne out by phone records showing several calls from Billa Visu around this time. 214', 'Hence, even if the accused had heard a hallucination telling him to stop trafficking, the accused showed a healthy resistance to such a command.', '137\\u2003Nor did the accused show any inclination to commit suicide. It followed from the above (at [131]-[136]) that if the accused was still trafficking, it would have been for the purposes of earning monies for the future. This did not cohere with knowledge of impending demise.', '138\\u2003The accused\u2019s lack of intention to commit suicide was made most evident in the social activities in the accused\u2019s phone records. The latest time the accused could have placed order for the second shipment of 27.61 g of diamorphine was his latest call from Billa Visu on 17 February 2015 at 12:41 pm. 215', 'This meant that the accused would have heard any alleged command hallucination prior to that. However, the accused\u2019s phone records after this time showed him continuing to socialise and communicate with his friends, \u201cAh Mya\u201d and \u201cAh Ling\u201d. In particular, he had four lengthy conversations with \u201cAh Mya\u201d 216', 'and sent a message 217', 'and had three short conversations with his female friend, \u201cAh Ling\u201d. 218', '139\\u2003Around 9:47 pm on 18 February 2015, just prior to his arrest, the accused also added four new contacts to his WeChat. 219', 'The Prosecution suggested the accused must have intended to contact them in the future. 220', 'I agreed. The accused\u2019s phone records and his social activities demonstrably showed this was not a person who had the intention of committing suicide, regardless of whether he was following a \u201cvoice\u201d or not.', '140\\u2003Indeed, the accused\u2019s fourth statement clearly demonstrated a contradictory intention. He stated that the heroin in exhibits \u201cE1\u201d to \u201cE5\u201d would last him about two months and \u201c[he] planned to consume the heroin using the \u201cchase the dragon\u201d method over the next two months\u201d. 221', 'The 27.61 g of diamorphine were contained in exhibited \u201cE1\u201d to \u201cE4\u201d. (Exhibit \u201cE5\u201d contained another 5.59 g of diamorphine.) In other words, the accused was explaining to the officer recording his fourth statement that he planned to consume the 27.61 g of diamorphine over a period of two months. This explanation is clearly inconsistent with the accused\u2019s defence that, from the moment he received the 27.61 g of diamorphine, he had not deviated in his intention to commit suicide and that he possessed the 27.61 g of diamorphine throughout for the purpose of smoking himself \u201cto freedom\u201d by overdosing on the drug.', '141\\u2003To be clear, the accused had not run a separate defence of consumption before me. In any event, any claim that all 36.42 g of the diamorphine was meant for his consumption over a period of two months would not sit easily with his account to Dr Winslow that he purchased one pound of heroin every three to four days for selling and for personal consumption. 222', 'As this defence was not canvassed before me either in the course of the evidence, or in submissions, I say no more about it.', '142\\u2003The accused had not rebutted the presumption under s 17 of the MDA. The clear inference to be drawn from the objective evidence was that at the material time, the accused remained busy with the sale and purchase of drugs and that the diamorphine found in his possession at the time of his arrest on 18 February 2015, including the 27.61 g of diamorphine, were possessed by the accused for the purpose of trafficking.', '143\\u2003I found that the Prosecution has proven the charge beyond a reasonable doubt, and I convicted the accused on the capital charge.', 'The accused was not eligible for the alternative sentencing regime under s 33B(2) of the MDA', '144\\u2003As I disbelieved the accused\u2019s claim that the 27.61 g of diamorphine was purchased in compliance with the alleged command hallucination, it followed that a substantial part, if not all of the 27.61 g of diamorphine was purchased for the purposes of resale and not for the purposes of his own suicide. The accused also admitted (at [32] above) that he possessed an intention to re-sell at least part of the 8.81 g of diamorphine.', '145\\u2003In the circumstances, I found that the accused\u2019s activities were not restricted to those set out in s 33B(2)(a) of the MDA. He was therefore not eligible for the alternative sentencing regime. Accordingly, I imposed on the accused the death sentence as mandated by s 33 read with the Second Schedule of the MDA.'"}

All these entities were represented by Mr Chettiar. I first set out a timeline showing the changes to the contracting parties, before explaining in detail how these changes came about:', '8\\u2003The relationship between the plaintiff and the second defendant began in 2005, when the plaintiff needed to find a new education institution in Singapore to take over 37 students of mechanical engineering who were midway through the plaintiff\u2019s mechanical engineering course with another school, Auston School of Management and Technology. 10', 'The plaintiff therefore approached the second defendant in around September 2005 to negotiate a collaborative venture. 11', '9\\u2003On or around 2 January 2006, the plaintiff entered into an agreement with the second defendant for the latter to offer the plaintiff\u2019s Bachelor of Engineering (Mechanical Engineering) Programme (\u201cBME Programme\u201d) in Singapore. This was effected by way of two contracts, one titled \u201cSingapore Services Agreement\u201d and the other \u201cAustralian Services Agreement\u201d (together \u201cthe 2006 Agreements\u201d). The terms of the 2006 Agreements allowed the second defendant to take in new students for the BME Programme up to 2009. 12', 'The 2006 Agreements are not the subject of the present suit.', '10\\u2003In July 2008, the parties agreed to join SEGP as a party to the 2006 Agreements. The first defendant says that this was because of an internal restructuring within the second defendant. 13', 'It was also necessary for SEGP to be joined as a party because, even though the second defendant was the counterparty under the 2006 Agreements, the Ministry of Education had given approval for SEGP (and not the second defendant) to administer the BME Programme in Singapore 14', 'and the courses were being marketed under SEGP 15', '.', '11\\u2003On 15 July 2008, Mr Chettiar signed and returned a letter to the plaintiff acknowledging that SEGP agreed to be a party to the 2006 Agreements and be bound by all the terms and conditions thereof, and that the obligations of the second defendant and SEGP under the 2006 Agreements would be joint and several. On 1 August 2008, the board of directors of SEGP passed a resolution resolving the same. 16', 'SEGP accordingly became jointly and severally bound by the terms of the 2006 Agreements together with the second defendant. 17', 'SEGP was the sole proprietor of a business registered on 27 October 1988 under the name \u201cSingapore Institute of Commerce\u201d 18', ', and administered the BME Programme through that business.', '12\\u2003The 2006 Agreements only permitted the second defendant and SEGP to accept new intakes for the plaintiff\u2019s BME Programme up to 2009. This required the parties to enter into a new set of contracts thereafter for their collaborative venture to continue.', '13\\u2003On or around 16 December 2009, the plaintiff and SEGP entered into another agreement for the latter to offer the plaintiff\u2019s BME Programme, as well as another four of the plaintiff\u2019s programmes: (1) Bachelor of Engineering (Aerospace Engineering); (2) Master of Engineering (International Automotive Engineering); (3) Master of Engineering (Management); and (4) Master of Engineering (Integrated Logistics Management) (together \u201cthe Five Programmes\u201d). 19', 'The arrangements took effect by way of two contracts, titled \u201cSingapore Services Agreement\u201d and \u201cAustralian Services Agreement\u201d, not to be confused with the two identically-titled agreements constituting the 2006 Agreements. I will refer to these as \u201cthe SSA\u201d and \u201cthe ASA\u201d respectively. The ASA and SSA were entered into as two separate contracts so as to distinguish between income earned in Singapore and income earned in Australia for tax purposes. 20', 'They were signed by the plaintiff, SEGP (referred to in the ASA and SSA as \u201cOrganisation\u201d), and the second defendant (as guarantor for SEGP\u2019s obligations). 21', 'As was typical of the plaintiff\u2019s contracts with overseas partners 22', ', the ASA and SSA contained the general key terms for the relationship between the plaintiff and SEGP, while the details of the programmes to be taught (such as pricing, payment, location and the relevant subjects) were specified in annexures to the two agreements. Only two of these annexures (the \u201cASA-Annexure\u201d and \u201cSSA-Annexure\u201d respectively; together \u201cthe Annexures\u201d) are relevant to the present suit.

The ASA, SSA and the Annexures are collectively referred to as \u201cthe 2009 Agreements\u201d 23', 'and are governed by the laws of the State of Victoria, Australia. 24', 'It is important to note that though the ASA and SSA were stated to \u201ccontinue for the minimum period of candidature of all students enrolled in intakes for the years 2010 to 2015 (inclusive)\u201d, the Annexures covered student intakes from 2010 to 2012 only. 25', '14\\u2003Under the 2009 Agreements, SEGP was to inter alia market the programmes, prepare promotional materials, collect application forms and fees from students, review application forms to ensure the students\u2019 eligibility, send the forms to the plaintiff for each intake, and provide the infrastructure for running the programmes at SEGP\u2019s campus, located at 1192 Upper Serangoon Road. SEGP was also to coordinate visits by the plaintiff\u2019s staff to conduct programme quality reviews, exam preparations and any other workshops. 26', 'The plaintiff was to enrol the students in RMIT, maintain student records, and provide course guides and learning packages to students. It also set the method and content of any assessment, marked and moderated assessment materials, forwarded SEGP the students\u2019 final examination results, and issued degrees or awards to students upon their completion of the programmes. 27', '15\\u2003In November 2010, the first defendant obtained EduTrust certification from the Council for Private Education (\u201cCPE\u201d), now known as the Committee for Private Education, a body constituted under the Private Education Act (Cap 247A, 2011 Rev Ed). Mr Chettiar and his associate, one Ken Yeo Poh Siah (\u201cMr Yeo\u201d), suggested that registration of the plaintiff\u2019s courses be transferred from the Singapore Institute of Commerce to the first defendant for the future intakes of the plaintiff\u2019s courses, for the reason that EduTrust certification would enhance student recruitment efforts locally and overseas. 28', 'It was therefore decided in early 2011 to make the first defendant a party to the 2009 Agreements. 29', '16\\u2003The parties accordingly signed two amending agreements dated 23 March 2011, one in respect of the SSA and the other in respect of the ASA (individually \u201cthe SSA Amending Agreement\u201d and \u201cthe ASA Amending Agreement\u201d; together \u201cthe Amending Agreements\u201d). 30', 'The effect of the Amending Agreements was to add the first defendant as a party to the 2009 Agreements.

Pursuant to Cl 4 of the Amending Agreements, the second defendant\u2019s obligations as guarantor under the ASA and SSA were also extended to the obligations of the first defendant.

There were no intakes for any of the other programmes covered by the annexures. 33', '19\\u2003Fault lines soon began to surface in the parties\u2019 relationship. A month after the Amending Agreements were signed, the plaintiff had started discussions with other private education institutions with a view to having them take over the courses which were the subject of the 2009 Agreements. 34', 'By 2012, the plaintiff says, the first defendant was late with payments, had changed the location of its campus without informing the plaintiff beforehand, and was experiencing a low take-up for the BME Programme (and no take-up for the other four courses). 35', 'The first defendant, on the other hand, alleges that the plaintiff entered into the Amending Agreements with the primary purpose of saddling the first defendant with SEGP\u2019s debts, and was not interested in maintaining a long-term relationship with the first defendant thereafter. 36', 'It also alleges that the plaintiff promised to contribute S$70,000 towards its advertising costs but reneged on this promise. 37', '20\\u2003On 20 July 2012, the plaintiff sent the first defendant a letter to \u201cclarify a key contractual requirement that [would] apply\u201d to the final intake of students later that year. 38', 'Pursuant to Cl 9.3 of the Annexures, the first defendant was required to pay the plaintiff fees for a minimum number of 15 students per trimester for each of the two Bachelor\u2019s courses, even if the actual enrolments were fewer in number.

Lingkes\u2019  defence was that he believed that Bundle P3 \ncontained tobacco. However, I found  that his assertion  was not  a credible one.\nVeracity of Lingkes\u2019 claim that he was  collecting money for  Ayyavoo\u2019s \nmoneylending business\n44 First, I disbelieved Lingkes\u2019 account that he was merely collecting \nmoney for Ayyavoo\u2019s moneylending business or that his role was limited to \ncollecting money. The evidence  strongly suggested that Lingkes was aware  that \nhe was assisting Ayyavoo in some illicit  activities,  that the delivery of items \n20\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Lingkesvaran  Rajendaren [2018]  SGHC  234\nwas within Lingkes\u2019 job scope all along,  and that he knew  that the moneys  \nreceived from Alfian  on the Second  and Third Occasions were for the items that \nhe had passed to Alfian.  \n45 The circumstances  surrounding how Lingkes was to go about collecting  \nmoney from Ayyavoo were highly suspicious. Lingkes was never informed  of \nwho and where he was to collect  money  from until after he had entered \nSingapore. Even after entering Singapore,  he was content to act on Ayyavoo\u2019s \nimmediate directions that were issued to him one location and one counterparty \nat a time, without ever being provided with any means of contacting the \ncounterparty. He was also never given the name  of the persons he was meeting \nbut only a description.  Moreover,  although  Lingkes was tasked to collect money \nfrom M three  times, he was never  given M\u2019s name  or contact  details, but had to \nlaboriously rely on Ayyavoo  to inform him of the meeting venue each time. \nLingkes did not provide  any reasons why Ayyavoo operated with such a level \nof secrecy and insecurity,  especially if Lingkes was merely collecting debts  as \nhe claimed. I found it unbelievable that Lingkes did not find this mode of \noperation suspicious.  \n46 Furthermore,  it was odd that Ayyavoo  could not collect the money from  \nborrowers in Singapore  himself, particularly  when he did not seem to be \nunavailable. In fact, and based on Lingkes\u2019  own account, when he returned from  \nSingapore on the First and Second Occasions, Ayyavoo was readily anticipating \nhim at the Johor Bahru customs  checkpoint where Lingkes would hand  over the \nmoney. Further,  Lingkes  claimed that Ayyavoo had asked him to collect money \nfrom Singapore  borrowers since Lingkes was in Singapore frequently to search \nfor a job. But Lingkes\u2019 account showed that for each of the First to Third \nOccasions, he had entered Singapore for the sole purpose of carrying out \nAyyavoo\u2019s instructions.  There was no evidence  that Lingkes was, on any of the \n21\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Lingkesvaran  Rajendaren [2018]  SGHC  234\nthree Occasions, looking for a job in Singapore,  and was collecting money for \nAyyavoo on the way only because it was convenient. \n47 I found that it should have been  clear to Lingkes that the deliveries on \nthe Second and Third Occasions were carried out for Ayyavoo and that the \nmoney collected for the deliveries was unrelated to the moneylending business. \nThe strange arrangements  between Ayyavoo and M showed that Ayyavoo was \nthe one directing the delivery  of the items that M passed  to Lingkes on the \nSecond and Third Occasions. \n48 First, although  M gave  Lingkes  the items for delivery supposedly as a \nfavour to M, it was Ayyavoo who gave Lingkes details of where and when to \nmeet the intended recipients and how to identify them.  Second, Lingkes asked  \nAyyavoo whether he could deliver  items for M, and only did so when Ayyavoo  \ninstructed him to. Third, even  though Ayyavoo  was not in Singapore, he \nappeared to have knowledge of what items M was handing to Lingkes for \ndelivery as he was able to give Lingkes independent confirmation of their \ncontents over the phone.  This would have suggested  to Lingkes that Ayyavoo \nhad prior  arrangements  with M for Lingkes  to pick up these items. Further, when \nLingkes received hell notes in return  for the small bundle which he delivered  as \na favour for M (as he claimed), it was Ayyavoo  who reassured  Lingkes that this \nwas alright. Lastly,  by Lingkes\u2019 own account, the money that he collected from  \nthe recipients of the items was to be handed  over to Ayyavoo. This was despite \nthe fact that it was M who had also asked Lingkes to collect money from the \nrecipients. It would have been  a most unlikely coincidence  that each of the \nrecipients of the items were also borrowers  who separately owed money to \nAyyavoo. Indeed, Lingkes admitted that when he agreed to assist M to deliver \nthe bundles,  he was in fact assisting Ayyavoo. Although M did not inform \nLingkes whose money  he was to collect  at Tiger company and at Yishun  when \n22\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Lingkesvaran  Rajendaren [2018]  SGHC  234\nhe delivered the small bundle and Bundle P3, Lingkes  had assumed that the \nmoney was meant for  Ayyavoo, rather  than M.53\n49 In these circumstances,  it was implausible that Lingkes could have \nthought that the money he was collecting  was unrelated to the delivery  of the \nitems and was purely for Ayyavoo\u2019s moneylending business.  Lingkes\u2019 own \nconduct, in taking directions  from  Ayyavoo about the deliveries and handing \nover the money (which came from the recipients  of the items) to Ayyavoo, was \ninconsistent with such a belief. Thus, I doubted Lingkes\u2019 claim that the \ndeliveries were done  as a favour  for M and that the money he was collecting \nwas for Ayyavoo\u2019s  moneylending business rather than in exchange for the items  \ndelivered. Indeed, in Lingkes\u2019 investigation  statement dated  19 July 2016, he \nstated that he \u201cdid not know\u201d if the money he received from Alfian on the Third \nOccasion was in consideration of Bundle P3 or for Ayyavoo\u2019s  moneylending \nbusiness; this was inconsistent with his defence in court that he was collecting \ndebts for Ayyavoo on all three occasions. Further, the fact that Lingkes did not \ninquire why he was taking instructions from Ayyavoo for a delivery entrusted \nto him by M suggested  to me that Ayyavoo had tasked Lingkes from the outset \nto not only collect  money but also pick up items from M  for delivery.\n50 Finally, Lingkes  was receiving a substantial payment of RM500 for a \nsimple job of (what  he claimed to be) debt collection. Lingkes acknowledged  \nthat this was \u201cgood money\u201d to make as it was a third to a quarter  of his monthly  \nsalary. This ought  to have alerted Lingkes that he was involved  in something  \nriskier than  merely collecting debts or delivering documents and  tobacco.  \n53 2\/8\/18 NE 21, 26 and 29.\n23\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Lingkesvaran  Rajendaren [2018]  SGHC  234\n51 For these reasons, I found that Lingkes was aware that he was assisting  \nAyyavoo in illicit activities beyond the purported moneylending business.\nVeracity of Lingkes\u2019 claim that he believed Bundle P3  contained tobacco\n52 Second,  on 24 May 2016, Lingkes received and delivered Bundle  P3 in \nvery suspicious circumstances  that ought to have alerted him to the illegal nature \nof its contents and prompted him to inquire further.  The following facts would \nhave caused a reasonable person to suspect and verify the contents  of Bundle \nP3.\n53 At [45]\u2013[46] and [50] above, I explained  why Lingkes\u2019 disproportionate  \nremuneration and the secrecy surrounding the meeting times  and places and the \nidentity of the counterparties  would have  raised  suspicions that Lingkes was \ninvolved in an illicit endeavour. Those facts  and circumstances  were also \nincongruent with Lingkes\u2019 purported  debt collection  job. \n54 On 24 May 2016, there was an abrupt  and substantial change in Lingkes\u2019 \njob scope, but by his own account, he never protested. He testified that prior to \nentering Singapore, he had only been  instructed  to help Ayyavoo to collect \nmoney but was not told how many persons to collect from  and how much to \ncollect from each person. Furthermore, instead of collecting money from M, \nLingkes was tasked to deliver  two bundles which he picked up from M. If his \npurpose for meeting  M was to collect money, then the meeting was entirely  \nfutile because M enlisted  Lingkes\u2019 help to run some errands instead. Lingkes \nclaimed that he had agreed to deliver  the two bundles, when he had entered  \nSingapore to collect money, because he saw it as a favour  for M and as Ayyavoo \nhad asked him to do. For reasons explained at [47]\u2013[48] above, I did not believe  \nLingkes\u2019 claim that the deliveries were carried out as a favour for M. Instead, I \n24\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Lingkesvaran  Rajendaren [2018]  SGHC  234\nfound that Lingkes understood all along that his job entailed delivering the \nbundles. \n55 Next, if the two bundles that Lingkes delivered on the Third Occasion \ncontained merely tobacco, it defied logic  that M would have required Lingkes\u2019  \nassistance to deliver them when M could have  done  so himself. I found  it \nparticularly bewildering  that M needed Lingkes  to deliver the small bundle to \nX. If the 3M and Tiger company were in close  proximity as Lingkes said they \nwere, M could  have delivered the small bundle himself, especially  when he had \na car and a chauffeur at his disposal. It made  no sense that M, who was in \nSingapore, needed Lingkes, who had to travel all the way from Malaysia, to \ncarry out these deliveries  to and collect  money from persons in Singapore.  I \nfound it difficult to believe that Lingkes did not find this request strange if he \nwas unaware that he was delivering illegal substances. \n56 Despite these  suspicious circumstances,  Lingkes testified that it did not \noccur to him to check  what was inside  the two bundles he received from M. \nLingkes said in his statements that he did not know if tobacco  was usually \ndelivered in this manner and whether it was legal to deliver tobacco in this \nmanner, 54 and yet he did not ascertain for himself what Bundle P3 contained. \nHe agreed under cross-examination  that he could have easily peeled off the \nblack tape to find out the  contents of Bundle P3.\n57 Lingkes\u2019 claim that Bundle P3 contained tobacco  \u2013 and his failure  to \ncheck its contents  for himself \u2013 rested  entirely on his trust in M\u2019s and Ayyavoo\u2019s  \nrepresentations that Bundle P3 contained tobacco. According to Lingkes, M told \nhim that the two bundles contained  \u201ctobacco\u201d. He then called Ayyavoo and \n54 AB 622 (Paras  65 and  68 of  the statement).\n25\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Lingkesvaran  Rajendaren [2018]  SGHC  234\nAyyavoo also told him that the bundles contained \u201ctembakau\u201d and instructed \nLingkes to deliver them and collect money from  the recipients. \n58 In my view, Lingkes had no good explanation for reposing so much trust \nin M and Ayyavoo  and in light of the suspicious circumstances. Lingkes had \nonly met M briefly on two prior occasions and did not even know  M\u2019s name. \nAs for Ayyavoo,  Lingkes had only known him for two months.  He did not know  \nAyyavoo\u2019s full name, or if \u201cAyyavoo\u201d  was even  his actual name.55 Lingkes \nconceded that he did not know much about Ayyavoo beyond his role as the head \nof security at the casino. Lingkes claimed that he trusted Ayyavoo because \nAyyavoo had done  a lot for him by finding him a place to stay. However,  this \ndid not seem  to justify such deep  trust to the extent  that Lingkes would shut his \neyes to all the dubious  facts  surrounding the delivery of Bundle P3. Indeed, \nLingkes\u2019 relationship with Ayyavoo was a transactional one, as he agreed to \nperform these jobs to earn \u201cgood money\u201d.  Moreover,  there was no evidence that \nAyyavoo had seen the contents of Bundle P3 such that he could provide Lingkes \nwith credible assurance that it contained  tobacco. This is especially when \nLingkes claimed that M had unexpectedly informed  him to deliver Bundle P3 \nonly when  he met M. Lastly, I found that Lingkes was fully aware that Ayyavoo  \nwas a shady  character who was involved in a number of illegal activities,  \nincluding drug trafficking. This finding is supported by the Audio Messages, \nwhich I deal with below.  I also note that Lingkes had saved Ayyavoo\u2019s number \nunder the contact name \u201cG\u201d rather than his name,56 suggesting that Lingkes was \naware that Ayyavoo was a clandestine character whose identity  had to be \nconcealed. I did not accept Lingkes\u2019  explanation  that he had done so because he \n55 1\/8\/18 NE 43 and 45.\n56 AB 218.\n26\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Lingkesvaran  Rajendaren [2018]  SGHC  234\ndid not know how to spell Ayyavoo\u2019s name,  especially when his handphone \ncontained names of  other  persons whom he could and had spelt out.57\n59 I found that Lingkes would not have delivered Bundle P3 to Alfian \nwithout verifying its contents unless he already knew or suspected what it \ncontained. Lingkes\u2019 own conduct suggests that he would  have checked if he \nsensed that something  was amiss. On the Second Occasion, Lingkes had asked \nM what was in the two envelopes  because  he was not prepared  to deliver them \nwithout knowing what  they contained.58 On the Third Occasion, when  X \nhurriedly grabbed  the small bundle  from Lingkes at the Tiger company and \nthrew an envelope out of the car, Lingkes tore open the seal of the envelope to \ncheck if he had received money as he expected to and because X had thrown it \nat him.59 If Lingkes was so cautious and by his own account  the request to \ndeliver Bundle P3 was unexpectedly sprung on him by M, he would have \nlikewise made  further  inquiries, especially  considering the suspicious \ncircumstances in which he was asked  to deliver it. This is especially  when, as \nhe stated in his investigation statement of 2 June 2016,  he found out that the \nenvelope X threw contained hell notes and he felt \u201csuspicious\u201d and he wondered \nwhy \u201cthis was all happening\u201d and that \u201csomething was wrong\u201d.60 Both the small \nbundle and Bundle  P3 were handed to Lingkes  by M. Yet Lingkes made no real \nattempt to independently verify the contents of Bundle P3 prior to delivering it, \neven though he had ample opportunity to do so after he discovered the hell notes  \nand his suspicion was aroused.  His failure  to do so despite  the shady \n57 1\/8\/18 NE 44.\n58 2\/8\/18 NE 11.\n59 2\/8\/18 NE 28.\n60 AB 617.\n27\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Lingkesvaran  Rajendaren [2018]  SGHC  234\ncircumstances strongly suggests  that he was well aware of the nature  of his task, \nie, to deliver drugs rather than tobacco. \n60 Therefore, the surrounding circumstances and the manner  in which  \nLingkes conducted himself strongly suggested  that he knew or suspected that \nBundle P3 contained controlled drugs, and not tobacco as he claimed.  This \nexplained why he did not inspect the contents of Bundle P3 in spite of so many \nred flags.\n61 Furthermore,  I found that Lingkes  had previously delivered diamorphine \nor heroin to Alfian on the Second Occasion,  and lied about this in his statements  \nand at trial to distance himself from the drugs he delivered to Alfian on the Third \nOccasion. Lingkes\u2019  evidence  was that he delivered two paper envelopes \nwrapped in black tape, with blue tape at the opening, to Alfian at Senoko Drive \non the Second Occasion. M had given him these  envelopes and told him that \none envelope contained  money and the other contained documents.61 Alfian\u2019s  \nevidence was that Lingkes had delivered three  bundles  of heroin wrapped in \nblack tape to him in exchange for  $8,200.\n62 I found Alfian\u2019s account to be far more  credible than Lingkes\u2019. First, \nLingkes did not in any of his investigation statements state that the envelopes \ncontained money and documents. In fact, he stated  on 2 June 2016 that he did \nnot know what the envelopes contained.62 This embellishment about the contents  \nof the envelopes  only emerged at trial. Second, Lingkes\u2019 version  of events was \nillogical. It made no sense for M to have passed Lingkes one bundle of cash \n(unwrapped) and another envelope of cash (wrapped  in tape) with the latter \n61 1\/8\/18 NE 8; 2\/8\/18 NE 11.\n62 AB 615.\n28\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Lingkesvaran  Rajendaren [2018]  SGHC  234\nbeing for delivery to someone else. When asked why M had wrapped  only the \nenvelope of cash, Lingkes  said it was possible that M did not trust him with the \nmoney.63 If that was so, M would have  wrapped the bundle of cash as well to \nensure its safe passage to the intended  recipient.  Further, it was illogical  for \nLingkes to be asked by M to deliver an envelope of cash to Alfian only to collect \ncash from Alfian. \n63 Third, Alfian had no reason  to lie because he had readily admitted that \nhe knew  that he was receiving heroin  from Lingkes on the Second and Third \nOccasions. Alfian\u2019s admission was detrimental  to himself. I also accept that \nAlfian did not take any loans  from Ayyavoo or anyone in Malaysia.  He did not \nhave a passport to travel out  of Singapore.   \n64 I found that Lingkes lied about  the appearance and contents  of the item \ndelivered to Alfian on the Second Occasion to give the impression that it was \nhis first time delivering  bundles wrapped in black  tape on the Third Occasion, \nand to thereby buttress his claim that he was ignorant of the true contents  of \nBundle P3 and that  it did  not occur to him to take  steps to  verify its  contents.\n65 Alfian also testified  that when  he collected  heroin from Lingkes on the \nSecond Occasion, he informed Lingkes that he was handing over \u201c8,200\u201d  in \ncash.64 This would have  conveyed to Lingkes that he had delivered an item of \nvery high value and would  have  put him on notice  that it was likely to be an \nillegal substance. Hence, when Lingkes was asked to do a similar delivery on \nthe Third Occasion and to collect money from the recipient of Bundle P3, he \n63 2\/8\/18 NE 16.\n64 3\/8\/18 NE 31.\n29\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Lingkesvaran  Rajendaren [2018]  SGHC  234\nwould have been put on notice that Bundle P3 may likewise contain illegal \nsubstances.\nLingkes\u2019 credibility\n66 Lastly, I considered Lingkes\u2019 evidence unreliable because, besides  lying \nabout what he delivered  on the Second Occasion, he made other attempts  to \ndistance himself from objective evidence that  was inculpatory in  nature.   \n67 First, I was satisfied that Lingkes  exchanged  the Audio Messages with \nSuresh, and Lingkes  had falsely attempted to distance himself  from the Audio \nMessages. When questioned about the Audio Messages during investigations  \non 16 March 2017, Lingkes claimed that he could not remember having this \nconversation and did not know whether  it was a conversation between him and \nSuresh.65 He however  conceded  that the phone marked  B1D and the SIM card \ninside belonged to him. At trial, Lingkes  claimed that he could not recall the \ncontents of the Audio Messages and had never  had any conversations  with \nSuresh concerning drugs.66 When the Audio Messages were played in court, \nLingkes claimed that he did not know whose  voice  it was and denied that it was \nhis voice.67 In my view,  Lingkes\u2019 denial  was not believable:\n(a) Lingkes admitted that the two numbers  reflected in Exhibit D \nbelonged to himself and Suresh.68 He has not suggested that someone \nelse was communicating with Suresh. There was no evidence that \n65 AB 630.\n66 1\/8\/18 NE 28; 2\/8\/18 NE 51.\n67 7\/8\/18 NE 8 and 11.\n68 1\/8\/18 NE 28.\n30\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Lingkesvaran  Rajendaren [2018]  SGHC  234\nsomeone else had used Lingkes\u2019 handphone  to send and receive the \nAudio Messages  to and  from Suresh. \n(b) The audio  messages  sent from Lingkes\u2019  number referred  to one \n\u201cAivoo\u201d who knew  about  drug prices and could arrange for drugs to be \ndelivered to Suresh. Lingkes admitted  that Aivoo was his drug supplier \nand that he would  also check with Aivoo about his selling rates on behalf \nof others.69 Lingkes\u2019 explanation of his relationship with Aivoo cohered \nwith the contents of the Audio Messages, which reflected the sender \noffering to inquire with Aivoo about drug prices.\n(c) It bears remembering that the conversation in the Audio \nMessages occurred  on 30 April  2016, less than a month  before  the events \nof the Second and Third  Occasions. Surprisingly, Lingkes could recall \nthe events of the First,  Second and Third Occasions  clearly (as he \nclaimed70) even at trial, but could not recall whether the conversation as \nreflected in the Audio Messages took place (even when asked  in his \ninvestigation statement in March  2017). I found him to be evasive  \nparticularly because  the conversation was not a mundane conversation \nbut pertained  to drug activities, as Lingkes himself acknowledged during \nthe trial. \n68 At this juncture, I deal with Defence  counsel\u2019s submission that an \nadverse inference should  be drawn  against the Prosecution for failing  to call \nSuresh to support  its case that the Audio Messages captured  a conversation \nwhich Suresh  had with Lingkes. I rejected  this submission. This was not a case \nin which the Prosecution  was withholding  any material information which was \n69 AB 630.\n70 2\/8\/18 NE 53.\n31\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Lingkesvaran  Rajendaren [2018]  SGHC  234\nsolely within its knowledge  and possession  to produce. Lingkes could have  \neasily called Suresh to support  his case (ie, that Suresh did not have  this \nconversation with Lingkes) but chose not to. It also bears remembering  that, \nwith the presumptions under  s 18(1) and s 18(2)  of the MDA  engaged, Lingkes \nbore the burden of proving, on balance, that he was not in possession of the \nDrugs nor  had the  requisite knowledge  of the nature of  the Drugs.\n69 Hence,  having found that Lingkes was the party exchanging the Audio \nMessages with Suresh, I was satisfied that the Audio Messages showed  that \nLingkes had knowledge of drugs and was involved  in drug-related activities.  At \ntrial, Lingkes admitted that he understood the Audio Messages  to be a \nconversation about procuring drugs.71 He understood that the words \u201cpapan\u201d, \n\u201cset\u201d, \u201crate\u201d and \u201cice\u201d pertained to the selling rate of drugs.  In the light of this, \nit appeared to me that Lingkes had falsely  attempted  to deny  any association \nwith the Audio Messages because he understood  that the contents of these \nmessages would be tainting. Lingkes\u2019 credibility was thereby diminished. I add \nthat I had the benefit  of hearing the Audio Messages in court and was satisfied \nthat the voice  in the Audio Messages  was similar to Lingkes\u2019  voice in court. \nBeing cognisant that the court is not here to give an expert opinion on voice-\nrecognition, I make this observation merely for completeness. \n70 Second,  I accepted the Prosecution\u2019s  submission that \u201cAivoo\u201d and \n\u201cAyyavoo\u201d were the same person and that Lingkes  had deliberately sought to \ndissociate them  because  it would have  been  damaging to his defence as it would \nreveal that he was assisting someone who, he was aware, trafficked drugs. \nCoincidentally, Lingkes  claimed that he knew both Aivoo and Ayyavoo at the \nsame time while working  at the casino; and one (Aivoo) was a security officer \n71 2\/8\/18 NE 51\u201352. \n32\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Lingkesvaran  Rajendaren [2018]  SGHC  234\nwhile the other (Ayyavoo)  was the head of security. Lingkes knew  nothing \nabout Aivoo\u2019s background or where he lived.72 Next Lingkes has not produced \na shred of evidence to prove Aivoo\u2019s existence as a distinct person from \nAyyavoo, apart from  Aivoo\u2019s name being mentioned in the Audio Messages. \nEven though the Audio Messages refer to some contact with Aivoo regarding \ndrugs, Lingkes claimed that he had never  contacted Aivoo on the phone. He did \nnot even have Aivoo\u2019s phone number  saved  in any of his phones.73 Even in the \ncase of Ayyavoo,  his contact number  was saved  in Lingkes\u2019 handphone under  \nthe contact name \u201cG\u201d.\n71 As I find that Aivoo and Ayyavoo  are one and the same person, this \nwould cast further  doubt on Lingkes\u2019  defence that he trusted Ayyavoo\u2019s \nrepresentation that Bundle P3 contained tobacco, because Lingkes would have \nbeen aware that Ayyavoo  was dealing  in drugs.\n72 Furthermore,  I found a number of inconsistencies in Lingkes\u2019 evidence \nover the  course of  investigations  and the trial. For example:\n(a) There was some  evolution in Lingkes\u2019 account  of the \ncircumstances in which  he came to possess Bundle P3 and the errands  \nhe ran for Ayyavoo before delivering  Bundle P3 to Alfian. First, in his \ncontemporaneous statement, he claimed  that he was given money and \ntobacco from a Singaporean man (which, in the light of his later \nstatements, I infer to be M) in Kallang  on 24 May 2016.74 This was \ndifferent from  his later statements and oral testimony that he had \n72 1\/8\/18 NE 46.\n73 1\/8\/18 NE 46.\n74 AB 398.\n33\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Lingkesvaran  Rajendaren [2018]  SGHC  234\ncollected two bundles  from M in a car in Tuas.  Second,  Lingkes \nmentioned in his statement dated 27 May 2016 that M instructed him to \nmeet him in Kallang  to collect money  from  him after he had delivered \nthe bundles \u2013 this detail was missing from all his subsequent accounts.75 \nThird, in his statement dated 30 May 2016, Lingkes said that prior  to \ngoing to Yishun,  Ayyavoo  had instructed him to go to Kallang  to collect  \ntwo bundles  of tobacco but nobody showed up, and he subsequently \nwent to another location where he collected  three to four bundles of cash \nfrom an Indian man.76 On the stand, he said that it was in Kallang that \nhe met a Tamil man who gave him four bundles  of money, while it was \nat Chai  Chee  that nobody showed up.77 \n(b) Next, as mentioned earlier, Lingkes claimed in his investigation \nstatement dated 2 June 2016 that he did not know what was inside the \nenvelopes that M passed to him on the Second Occasion.78 At trial, he \nclaimed that he had asked M what the envelopes  contained and was told \nthat they contained cash and documents.79\n(c) In his investigation statement dated 19 July 2016, Lingkes \nclaimed that he did not know if it was legal  or illegal to deliver the \ntobacco that M had passed  to him, and that he did not know if the money \nhe collected  from Alfian  was for the tobacco he delivered or for \nAyyavoo\u2019s moneylending business.80 However, at trial, he gave \n75 AB 596.\n76 AB 602.\n77 1\/8\/18 NE 17.\n78 AB 615.\n79 2\/8\/18 NE 11\u201312.\n80 AB 622.\n34\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Lingkesvaran  Rajendaren [2018]  SGHC  234\nevidence that he did not think that it was illegal  to deliver tobacco, and \nthe money  he collected from Alfian was for Ayyavoo\u2019s moneylending \nbusiness and was unrelated to Bundle P3.  \nConclusion on Lingkes\u2019 charge\n73 Having  considered  all the evidence,  I rejected Lingkes\u2019  claim that he \nbelieved Bundle P3 contained tobacco and that the money he collected when he \ndelivered Bundle P3 was for Ayyavoo\u2019s moneylending business. I found that \nLingkes was not a credible witness. For all the above reasons, I found that \nLingkes failed to rebut the presumptions of possession and knowledge  under  \ns 18(1)  and (2) of the MDA. He had failed  to raise a reasonable doubt  that he \ndid not know  of the existence of the Drugs in Bundle P3. Lingkes had \u201cturned \na blind  eye\u201d to circumstances which would have prompted a reasonable person \nto suspect  and verify whether Bundle P3 contained the Drugs (Dinesh Pillai at \n[21]) and he did not verify the contents  of Bundle P3 though he could easily  \nhave done  so. Further, Lingkes had committed  an act of trafficking in the Drugs \nby giving or delivering Bundle P3 which  contained the Drugs to Alfian. \nAccordingly, I found that all the elements of the charge against Lingkes had \nbeen proved beyond  a reasonable doubt and I convicted Lingkes  on the charge \nframed against him. \nDecision on Alfian\u2019s  charge\n74 I turn now to the charge against  Alfian. The Prosecution and Alfian\u2019s  \ncounsel agreed that the presumptions  under  ss 18(1) and 18(2)  applied  in \nAlfian\u2019s case. Alfian admitted to all the elements  of the charge in his statements \nand his testimony at  trial:\n35\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Lingkesvaran  Rajendaren [2018]  SGHC  234\n(a) Alfian did not dispute that he was in possession of Bundle P3. \nHe admitted that he had collected Bundle P3 from Lingkes and Bundle \nP3 was found in his haversack  when  he was arrested.81  \n(b) Next, I found that Alfian had actual knowledge of the nature of \nthe Drugs in Bundle P3. Alfian admitted that he knew that Bundle P3 \ncontained heroin or diamorphine when he received  it from  Lingkes on \n24 May 2016 as he had been instructed by Botak to collect  heroin.82 \nAlfian admitted that he had asked  Rodrigues to hand over cash of $8,200 \nin a red plastic bag to Lingkes as payment  for the heroin. He also \nadmitted that he had collected heroin  from  Lingkes on a previous  \noccasion. His oral testimony was consistent with the statements he gave \nto the CNB officers. \n(c) Finally, I was satisfied that Alfian\u2019s  possession of Bundle P3 \ncontaining the Drugs was for the purposes  of trafficking. Alfian admitted  \nthat he intended to deliver  the Drugs to Botak.83 Clearly (and \nundisputedly) Alfian was  not authorised  to traffic  in heroin.\n75 As such, I found that the elements  of the charge against Alfian had been \nproved beyond a reasonable  doubt and I convicted him on the charge framed \nagainst him.\n81 3\/8\/18 NE 16.\n82 AB 657 and 675; 3\/8\/18  NE 16.\n83 AB 673; 3\/8\/18 NE 30.\n36\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Lingkesvaran  Rajendaren [2018]  SGHC  234\nSentence\n76 I turn then to the sentence to be imposed. Given the quantity of drugs in \nthis case, the prescribed  punishment  under  s 33(1)  of the MDA,  read with the \nSecond Schedule to the MDA,  is death. However, s 33B of the MDA confers \non the court the discretion to impose the alternative sentence  of life \nimprisonment and the mandatory minimum 15 strokes of the cane, provided the \noffender satisfies  the requirements in s 33(B)(2)(a) of the MDA  and receives a \ncertificate of substantive  assistance from the Public Prosecutor. \n77 The Prosecution did not dispute that both Lingkes\u2019 and Alfian\u2019s  \ninvolvement in their respective offence  was limited to activities set out under \ns 33B(2)( a) of the MDA, ie, that they were couriers.84 In the round, I was \nsatisfied that Lingkes\u2019 role was restricted  to that of delivering  the drugs  to Alfian \non Ayyavoo\u2019s  instructions. Even  if he had collected payment from Alfian,  this \ncould be considered as an act incidental  to the delivery of the drugs. As for \nAlfian, I was also satisfied that he was a courier.  The Prosecution did not \nchallenge Alfian\u2019s  evidence that he was collecting Bundle  P3 for Botak, and \nthere was also no evidence that he was involved in repacking or redistributing \nof drugs. I was thus satisfied that both Lingkes\u2019  and Alfian\u2019s acts fell within the \nacts of a courier under s 33B(2)(a) of the MDA.\n78 However,  the Prosecution did not issue Lingkes with a certificate of \nsubstantive assistance under s 33B(2)( b) of the MDA. As such, Lingkes could \nnot avail  himself of the alternative sentencing  regime under  s 33B of the MDA. \nI therefore  passed the  mandatory death sentence on him.\n84 Prosecution\u2019s Closing Submissions, para 37.\n37\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Lingkesvaran  Rajendaren [2018]  SGHC  234\n79 As for Alfian, the Prosecution had issued a certificate  of substantive  \nassistance. I found no reason to impose the death penalty on Alfian, nor did the \nProsecution submit there was any such reason. Accordingly, I imposed the \nalternative sentence of life imprisonment and the mandatory minimum  15 \nstrokes of  the cane.\nAudrey LimJudicial Commissioner\nAnandan Bala,  Tan Yanying and Theong Li Han (Attorney-General\u2019s \nChambers) for the Prosecution;\nRam Goswami (Ram Goswami) and  Cheng  Kim Kuan  (K K Cheng  \n& Co) for the first accused;\nLuo Ling Ling (RHT Law Tay Wessing LLP), Prasad s\/o Karunakarn \n(K Prasad & Co) and  Krishna Ramakrishna Sharma (Krishna  R \nSharma) for the second accused.\n38\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)"}

The Appellant and 1st Respondent then entered into a hire purchase agreement dated 2 January 2001 (\u201cthe HP Agreement\u201d) in respect of the bus which bore the registration number PZ515E. The interest rate was 5.25% per annum and the instalment payments were to be made monthly for six years. It was a term of the HP Agreement that, if the 1st Respondent defaults on his instalments, an interest charge on the overdue instalments at 18% per annum simple interest calculated on a daily basis would be levied. The 2nd and 3rd Respondents were guarantors for the 1st Respondent in relation to his obligations under the HP Agreement.', '6\\u2003At the same time, the 1st Respondent had purchased two other buses which were also financed by the Appellant.

It appears that the Appellant exercised its right to terminate the HP Agreement and it repossessed the vehicle on 11 March 2003. 2', 'Then, on 20 May 2003, the Appellant commenced DC 2101\/2003\/W against the Respondents to recover the amounts owed under the HP Agreement.', '8\\u2003The Appellant and the 1st Respondent then entered into a new agreement on 1 August 2003, which they titled as \u201cMemorandum\u201d (\u201cthe Memorandum\u201d), to revive and vary the terms of the HP Agreement.

In gist, he pleaded that the HP Agreement was illegal and void as it was prepared and executed in a manner that was contrary to the Hire-Purchase Act (Cap 125, 2014 Rev Ed)(\u201cHire-Purchase Act). He also claimed that he had made a number of payments to the Appellant from 2002 to 2010 that had not been accounted for. He denied that there were any sums due to the Appellant.

Amongst other things, they alleged that they were discharged from any liability to the Appellant because the Memorandum had been entered into without their knowledge and consent. They counterclaimed for declaration that their guarantees had been \u201clawfully rescinded\u201d as a consequence thereof.', '15\\u2003 When the action came up for trial on 23 February 2017, counsel for the Appellant and the Respondents first saw the District Judge in chambers to try to settle the issues for determination by the court.

Counsel for the Respondents then asked for the matter to be stood down for 20 minutes. After discussions, both counsel returned to see the District Judge in chambers to inform her that they had come to an agreement that the Respondents were admitting liability to the Appellant\u2019s claim, without any order as to costs, and that the Appellant\u2019s damages would be assessed. The District Judge then granted judgment by consent in the following terms (\u201cthe Consent Judgment\u201d):', '1.

The site supervisor for Tower A was an employee of GSE by the name of Miah Rashed (\u201cRashed\u201d).

After the loading platform was shifted to Tower A, the three employees at Tower B joined the rest at Tower A. 7', 'Unfortunately, at Tower A, the loading platform was not properly installed and was suspended by the tower crane instead. Due to the fact that it was not properly installed, the loading platform was slanted away from the tower, and the portion of the platform outside the tower was tilted lower than the portion within the tower. 8', 'Just prior to the accident, the two deceased were standing on the loading platform, pulling the air compressor onto the loading platform.

It was contended that Xu Maolin \nparallels the present case as the victim there  had similarly sustained a nasal \nfracture, and that the offender there  (much  like the respondent) had a clean  \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Holman, Benjamin John [2018]  SGHC  237\n14record. I was unpersuaded that the present case comes close  to the circumstances \nin Xu Maolin. The victim in that case had already fallen to the ground as the \noffender continued  to hit the victim. There were also other injuries  such as \nmultiple abrasions over the face,  chest and abdomen.  Given that the seriousness  \nof the harm caused and culpability of the offender  are different from  those  in \nthe case at hand,  Xu Maolin would only assist insofar as it shows one end of the \nspectrum. \n39 The Prosecution cited Alamgir Hossain in its written  submissions. I \nfound the case of Alamgir Hossain to be closer  to the circumstances of the \npresent case. That said, Alamgir Hossain  must be viewed with circumspection. \nI have  set out the factual  circumstances of the case at [12] above  and do not \npropose to repeat them, save to note that the court imposed  a sentence  of 14 \nweeks\u2019 imprisonment. While  Alamgir Hossain and the case at hand do appear \nto share some common features  \u2013 such as a nasal fracture  suffered  by the \nrespective victims \u2013 there  are distinguishing  factors.  First, there was an element  \nof vulnerability in Alamgir Hossain that was not present in the case at hand. The \noffence there took place at about 11pm. Although the victim and offender were \non a public road,  it was unlikely that there was anyone else present given the \ntime of the offence.  Indeed, the brazen  actions  of the offender  also suggested  \nthat there was no one present  then. Second,  there  was an element of sexual \ninappropriateness as the offender started  to engage  the victim  by hitting the left \nside of the victim\u2019s chest and thereafter  made obscene remarks.  Third, the \nculpability of the offender and harm  caused were slightly more serious. The \noffender continued  to punch the victim  until she collapsed on the ground and \nbled through her nose. Hence, while I found Alamgir Hossain to be useful, the \nsentence imposed in that  case should be considered  with  caution.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Holman, Benjamin John [2018]  SGHC  237\n1540 Finally, I turn to the sentencing  matrix  proposed by the Prosecution. A \ntable was produced in submissions setting out a spread of punishments that may \nbe considered  in relation  to the harm caused by and the culpability of the \noffender. It would be premature  for the court, at present, to endorse the proposed \nmatrix in relation to the types of offences  of the present nature. \n41 Ultimately, in considering the harm  caused  and the culpability of the \noffender, a measure of ordinal proportionality  must also be considered. In cases \ninvolving the voluntary  causing of hurt to a public  servant, the sentencing band  \nbegins with two months\u2019 imprisonment (Public Prosecutor v Yeo Ek Boon \nJeffrey [2018]  3 SLR 1080  (\u201cYeo Ek Boon\u201d)  at [59]). Indeed,  this court in Yeo \nEk Boon imposed  a sentence of 10 weeks\u2019 imprisonment against  an offender  \nwho slapped a police officer.  The court  declined to follow  the Prosecution\u2019s  \nproposed sentence of four months\u2019 imprisonment noting  that the circumstances  \nwere not particularly egregious.\n42 Overall,  the sentence of eight months\u2019 imprisonment proposed by the \nProsecution (and the range  of sentences  for offences  in the nature  of the present) \nsets the standard too high. Sufficient deterrence would be meted  out by a \nsentence in the range  of a few months for offences  of the present nature. The \ncircumstances in such offences do not warrant a sentence ranging close to a year \nof imprisonment.  \nConclusion\n43 Pulling  together the strands of my analysis,  I concluded that two months\u2019 \nimprisonment was the appropriate sentence.  The most egregious harm caused  \nto the victim in the present case was the nasal fracture. The victim was given \nseven days of medical  leave for the totality of the injuries suffered. While the \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Holman, Benjamin John [2018]  SGHC  237\n16victim crouched at some point during the exchange  of blows, it was not to the \nextent that he collapsed to the ground. There were  also certain  mitigating  factors \nthat operated  in the respondent\u2019s favour. At the same time, the offence took \nplace on an MRT platform at rush hour and did cause a degree of disruption. \nThe respondent was intoxicated at the time of the offence and that intoxication  \nwould likely  have contributed in some  way to his unruly  behaviour. In the \nround, a sentence of two months\u2019 imprisonment was appropriate. \nAedit AbdullahJudge  \nHan Ming Kuang  and Li Yihong (Attorney-General\u2019s  Chambers) for  \nthe appellant;\nVinit Chhabra (Vinit Chhabra Law  Corporation) for  the respondent. \n \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)"}

The claim in Suit 821 was critical to the assessment of the merits of OS 727 and OS 945. This was because Salgaocar\u2019s case was that he had lodged the Caveats to preserve his alleged interests in the Properties pending the determination of the claim in Suit 821. In other words, the basis of the Caveats was Salgaocar\u2019s claim in Suit 821.', '7\\u2003In Suit 821, Salgaocar sought, inter alia, a declaration that Darsan held assets, including the Properties, on trust for him and an order that Darsan convey the Properties to him. Salgaocar\u2019s claim in Suit 821 centred on an alleged agreement he reached in or around December 2003 with Darsan in Hong Kong (\u201cthe December 2003 Agreement\u201d). The crucial elements of the December 2003 Agreement were as follows:', '(a)\\u2003Salgaocar would establish special purpose vehicles (\u201cSPVs\u201d) in, inter alia, the British Virgin Islands (\u201cthe BVI\u201d and \u201cthe BVI SPVs\u201d), to conduct businesses and hold assets.

Darsan would comply with all of Salgaocar\u2019s instructions relating to the SPVs and their assets. Salgaocar would be the sole beneficial owner of all of the shares in the SPVs and\/or any assets held by the SPVs.', '8\\u2003Why the December 2003 Agreement was reached is explained by the events that unfolded thereafter. Salgaocar was a man of substantial means and stature. He had major business interests in India and was a prominent politician in the state of Goa. According to him, in or around April 2004, he procured Salgaocar Mining Industries Pvt Ltd, a company incorporated in India which owned several mines there, and which Salgaocar controlled, to sell iron ore to the BVI SPVs. In turn, the BVI SPVs sold the iron ore to entities in China at much higher prices and thus reaped substantial trading profits in the region of US$690m. Salgaocar then incorporated several SPVs, some of which in Singapore (\u201cthe Singapore SPVs\u201d). Part of the trading profits earned by the BVI SPVs were channelled to the Singapore SPVs for the purpose of undertaking investments and various businesses. The profits were used, inter alia, to develop Newton Imperial and purchase units in WCEGA Tower and Waterford Residence.', '9\\u2003In Suit 821, Salgaocar claimed that Darsan committed breach of trust and fiduciary duties in, inter alia, the following ways:', '(a)\\u2003by transferring the Newton Imperial Units from Great Newton Properties Pte Ltd (\u201cGreat Newton\u201d), one of the Singapore SPVs and the developer of Newton Imperial, to Darsan and Darsan\u2019s wife; and', '(b)\\u2003by failing to procure the return of, inter alia, the Waterford and WCEGA Units to Salgaocar, upon his demand for the return of the same.', '10\\u2003As mentioned earlier, on 15 October 2015, the Companies commenced OS 945, applying for the removal of the caveats lodged against the Waterford Units and the WCEGA Units.', '11\\u2003On 28 December 2015, Darsan applied to strike out Suit 821.', '12\\u2003On 1 January 2016, Salgaocar unfortunately passed away.

Until that sum was paid by NKM to INTL, NKM had not fulfilled all its obligations to INTL. Likewise, until all costs and disbursements awarded to INTL in the Hong Kong arbitration were paid by NKM, NKM had not fulfilled all its obligations to INTL.

Hence, the AR was in error as he had stayed the action based on the court\u2019s inherent case management powers instead. I dismissed RA 182 of 2018.

I shall go through them in detail  below at [114] \nto [122]. I summarise these reasons here. First,  it was suggested that the Victim \nwas afraid for having  disturbed B when B was watching the \u201clive\u201d  telecast of \n135 NE 3\/10\/2017 at  p 51 lines 4\u201312. \n136 NE 5\/10\/2017 at  pp 15 lines 24\u201331; 16 lines  3\u201312; 75 lines 8\u201313. \n137 NE 3\/10\/2017 at  pp 15 lines 11\u201313; 16 line  1.  \n138 NE 4\/10\/2017, at  pp 26\u201328.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v BNO [2018]  SGHC  243\n27the rugby World Cup final that night. Second, it was suggested that the Victim \nhad made up these allegations  as a form  of attention-seeking behaviour \nbecause of his emotional distress at his parents  undergoing a divorce. Third, it \nwas suggested that the Victim had been shaken  by the Halloween atmosphere \nthat night, and could  thus have imagined  the sexual assault. \n52 The Defence further  suggested that the Victim could have imagined acts \nof a sexual nature occurring because he had been sexualised at school,  for \nexample, by being exposed  to discussions  about  oral sex in the social media \ngroup chats among students of his school.139 \nThe Victim\u2019s  father (B)  was not entirely truthful\n53 The Defence  submitted  that although B was quick to bolster the Victim\u2019s \nallegations, his evidence revealed inconsistencies  with that of other  witnesses. \nFor instance,  the Victim  admitted that he did give a high five to the Accused \nand had thanked him before leaving the house. However, B testified  that he \ncould not recall the Victim  giving the Accused a high five nor saying goodbye \nto the Accused and AW.140 Another instance related  to the Victim\u2019s reaction \nupon being asked to repeat what  he had said to his father to the Accused  and \nAW. The Victim\u2019s  account was that he had refused to do so; this was \ncorroborated by the Accused and AW.141 However,  according to B, the Victim \nresponded by pointing  to the Accused  or saying something  along the lines of \n\u201che was  the one\u201d.142 \n139 NE 6\/2\/2018 at  p 91 line 29. \n140 NE 5\/10\/2017 at  pp 20 line 25; 58 lines  25\u201326.\n141 NE 3\/10\/2017 at  p 75 lines 1\u20137; NE 4\/10\/2017 at p 21 lines 14\u201320. \n142 Victim\u2019s  father\u2019s  CS at para 8. \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v BNO [2018]  SGHC  243\n2854 B further testified that he told AW that he was going  to report the matter \nto the police on the night of the incident.143 This was denied by AW. \nSubsequently, B testified, to the contrary, that calling the police was not even  \non his mind at that time because he had to deal with the situation that his son \nhad been  sexually abused.144 He stated  that it was only on the following day \nthat he was advised by CF to lodge a police  report.145 He also gave evidence  \nthat contradicted the Victim\u2019s testimony in respect of having thrown away the \npyjamas he had worn on the night of the incident  and having  told B so. B \ntestified that he did not know  what  had happened to the Victim\u2019s pyjamas;146 \nhe assumed that the pyjamas had been washed, and this was what  he told the \npolice.147 In the light of the inconsistencies, the Defence submitted that B was \nnot entirely truthful. \nExplanations for the obscene images \n55 The Accused  also objected to the admissibility  of the obscene  images  \nfound in his laptop.  In the event,  I held that the obscene images  were \ninadmissible. Nevertheless, the Defence  sought at length to provide \nexplanations for their existence in the Accused\u2019s  laptop. The Accused claimed \nthat the obscene images  were \u201ctemporary internet files from browsing \nwebsites\u201d related to a sexual  performance-enhancing drug (\u201caffected research \nwebsites\u201d) which he had accessed in the course  of his research work at his \nprevious company (\u201cMAP\u201d) or after he left his company when he was working \non a case study on the launch of the drug (\u201cP\u201d).148 The Accused claimed  that \n143 NE 5\/10\/2017 at  p 33 lines 28\u201331. \n144 NE 5\/10\/2017 at  p 35 lines 1\u20134.\n145 NE 5\/10\/2017 at  p 38 line 3\u20134. \n146 NE 5\/10\/2017 at  p 41 lines 6\u20139. \n147 NE 5\/10\/2017 at  p 1 line 20. \n148 NE 2\/2\/2018, at  p 53 lines 1\u20133; p 56 lines  1\u20132. \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v BNO [2018]  SGHC  243\n29he had purchased his laptop  from MAP  when he left, and there was no total \nreformat of it. To support  his allegation  that he continued to access such \nwebsites after he left MAP, the Accused  produced  his report titled \u201cA Unique \nPerspective on the [MAP]  Launch of [the drug \u201cP\u201d] \u2013 Perspectives as of \nSeptember 2015\u201d (\u201cthe Report\u201d),149 which  he had sent to his company\u2019s \nheadquarters in Italy on 10 January 2016, which was a year after he left MAP. \nBefore the obscene images were ruled to be inadmissible,  the Defence  called  \nupon its expert witness Chu Yan Ting Frances (\u201cFrances Chu\u201d) to give \nevidence that reformatting a laptop might not remove all data, and Alessandro  \nForlin as well as Professor Peter Lim Huat Chye (\u201cProfessor Peter Lim\u201d) to \ngive evidence in support of the Accused\u2019s position ie, that affected research  \nwebsites were accessed to gain insight  into the potential  homosexual customer \nbase in the  process of marketing  P. \nProsecution\u2019s application to admit Annex C of P54\n56 I turn now to set out the detailed reasons  for my rulings on two \napplications made in the course of the trial by the Prosecution and the Defence  \nrespectively. The first of these was the Prosecution\u2019s application to admit \nAnnex C of P54 as rebuttal evidence.  Annex  C consisted of the obscene images  \n(67 obscene photographs in total)  retrieved from the Accused\u2019s laptop  \ndepicting persons, mostly  males,  engaged in sexual acts. The Prosecution \nbased this application on two grounds: (a) to disprove the Accused\u2019s evidence \nof good character, ie, that he was only sexually  interested in women, pursuant  \nto s 56 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed); and (b) to rebut the specific  \nargument of  the Accused  that he was not sexually  interested in  males.150 \n149 Exhibit D3. \n150 Prosecution\u2019s submissions on the admission of  Annex C, at  para 3. \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v BNO [2018]  SGHC  243\n3057 With regard to the first ground, the Prosecution  argued that by testifying \non the stand  that he was a heterosexual with strong family  ethics\/Asian values, \nthe Accused  had lowered his character shield so his character was liable to \nbeing attacked by virtue of s 56 of the Evidence  Act. In relation to the second \nground, the Prosecution argued that Annex C was relevant to rebutting the \nAccused\u2019s allegation that he was not sexually interested in males, thus \nsatisfying the criterion of relevance  for admission of evidence under  s 5 of the \nEvidence Act. It was also submitted that Annex C satisfied s 14 of the \nEvidence Act since it would go towards  showing the \u201cexistence of any state of \nmind\u201d, the state of mind in the present  case being the Accused having \nhomosexual tendencies.151\n58 It was only well after the defence was called that counsel challenged  the \nadmissibility of Annex C as rebuttal evidence,  on the basis that this was not a \nmatter arising  ex improviso, ie, a matter  which the Prosecution could not have \nreasonably have  foreseen,152 and that there was no lowering  of the Accused\u2019s \ncharacter shield because evidence regarding his sexuality and family ethics \nwere only adduced  through  cross-examination by the Prosecution.153 Defence \ncounsel submitted that Annex C did not arise from anything which  the \nProsecution could  not reasonably have foreseen,  and the Prosecution had been \nin possession of Annex  C since the time a forensic  examination was conducted  \non the Accused\u2019s laptop (the forensic report  being dated 13 May 2016). \nDefence counsel also submitted orally  that the character of the Accused was \nnot put in issue by him since it was the Prosecution who had led the Accused \nto testify about his character during his cross-examination.154 \n151 Prosecution\u2019s submissions on the admission of  Annex C, at  para 8. \n152 Accused\u2019s submissions on the  admissibility of P54-I (Annex C) at  paras 3 and  4. \n153 NE 2\/4\/2018 at  pp 11 and  12. \n154 NE 2\/4\/2018 at  p 11. \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v BNO [2018]  SGHC  243\n3159 After hearing the parties\u2019 submissions,  I dismissed the Prosecution\u2019s  \napplication to adduce Annex C as rebuttal evidence. I opined that character \nwas put in issue,  and Annex C might be potentially relevant as a specific  \nrebuttal in relation to the Accused\u2019s assertions of being a family man with \nstrong moral  or ethical values.  But in any event,  I dismissed the application on \nthe basis  that the prejudicial effect of its admission might be higher than the \nprobative value. Upon further consideration of the parties\u2019 submissions, I will \nnow elaborate on and clarify my decision to dismiss the application.\n60 The statutory basis for the admission of rebuttal evidence  is s 230(1)(t) \nof the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (\u201cCPC\u201d).  Section  \n230(1)(t)  gives the Prosecution the right to call a person as a witness or recall \na witness for the purpose of rebuttal, and is intended to allow the calling of \nrebuttal evidence based on the long-standing practice in the courts  (Jennifer \nMarie & Mohamed Faizal  Mohamed  Abdul Kadir,  The Criminal Procedure  \nCode of Singapore  (Academy  Publishing,  2012) at paras 12.060 and 12.061). \nThe admission of rebuttal evidence is a matter for the court\u2019s  discretion, and \nthe threshold for allowing rebuttal evidence  for both civil and criminal  \nproceedings has been set out conclusively  in Public Prosecutor  v Bridges \nChristopher [1997] 3 SLR(R) 467 at [51] as  follows:\n\u2026 [the calling of rebuttal evidence] will be allowed only in the \ncase of a matter  arising ex improviso, ie one which the plaintiff \ncould not reasonably  have foreseen. In other  words where the \nplaintiff has been misled or taken  by surprise  or in answer to \nevidence of the defendant in support of an issue the proof of \nwhich lay upon the  defendant.\n61 I agreed with the Defence that the threshold for allowing rebuttal \nevidence was not met in the present case.  Firstly, the present case did not \ninvolve a matter arising ex improviso. The Prosecution was in possession of \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v BNO [2018]  SGHC  243\n32Annex C all along, ever since the forensic examination report  was produced \non 13 May 2016.  Annex C was served on the Accused on 26 September 2017 \nbefore the trial commenced on 3 October 2017. On 6 October 2017, Neo Poh \nEng testified on the stand  that the Prosecution would not be adducing Annex \nC of the forensic  examination report.155 No formal application to admit Annex \nC was made  at the close of the Prosecution\u2019s case. Nevertheless, the \nProsecution subsequently  decided to refer to Annex C during the cross-\nexamination of the Accused. The eventual attempt  to adduce Annex C was \nmade in order  to rebut the Accused\u2019s claim  that he was not sexually interested \nin males, but this was an issue which  was brought up by the Prosecution itself \nduring its cross-examination of the Accused. The Accused  did not bring up the \nissues regarding his family values  or his sexuality at all, and his testimony in \nrelation to these issues only arose  upon being questioned by the Prosecution \nduring his cross-examination.156 In these  circumstances, it could not be argued  \nthat the matters of the Accused\u2019s sexuality  and family values arose ex \nimproviso, and had taken the Prosecution  by surprise. Secondly, the present \ncase did not involve an issue  in respect of which the burden  of proof lay upon \nthe Accused. This was far from the situation in Osman bin Ali v Public \nProsecutor [1971\u20131973] SLR(R) 503, where rebuttal evidence was allowed in \nrelation to the defence of diminished responsibility, for which the burden of \nproof was on the defendant. In the present  case, it was not the Defence that \nsought to show in the Defence case that the Accused  had no interest in males \nand was a family man  with  strong moral  or ethical  values. \n62 The present situation is distinguishable  from  a case where a defendant \nseeks to prove his good character; in the latter case, it is likely that the \n155 NE 6\/10\/2017 p 43, line 24. \n156 NE 2\/2\/2018 pp 45\u201348. \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v BNO [2018]  SGHC  243\n33Prosecution would  be allowed  to adduce  rebuttal  evidence in reply because the \nsituation is one arising ex improviso, provided  that the Prosecution did not \nforesee the Defence raising the issue. In the present  case, the failure to meet  \nthe threshold for allowing rebuttal  evidence alone is sufficient to dispose of \nthe Prosecution\u2019s application to adduce  Annex  C. Nevertheless, for \ncompleteness, I go on to address  the other issues brought up by the \nProsecution.\n63 The Prosecution  argued that the Accused  had testified  as to his good \ndisposition or reputation and it could therefore  adduce evidence  as to his bad \ncharacter pursuant to s 56 of the Evidence  Act. The prohibition of questions \nas to his bad disposition  and character under s 122(4) of the Evidence  Act \n(setting out what is commonly known as the character shield) would therefore \nnot apply. The context however was that the Prosecution had produced  a \ndocument titled \u201cSelection of \u2026 Family Pictures\u201d depicting photographs  of \nthe Accused\u2019s family  and his annotated descriptions  of them  being \u201c[a] solid \nfamily unit with a very happy, loving,  14-year marriage\u201d with \u201c3 wonderful \nchildren loved by their parents  and raised with strong family ethics\/Asian \nvalues\u201d during the cross-examination of the Accused  (later admitted  into \nevidence and marked  as P55). Upon being  questioned by the Prosecution, the \nAccused stated that he had produced  the document  and sent it to IO Ng while \ninvestigations into this case were ongoing.157 The Accused explained that his \nfamily had \u201cstrong ethical values\u201d,  and would \u201calways do the right thing, tell \nthe truth\u201d,  and that he and his wife are \u201con top of what [their] kids do\u201d.158 \nUnrelated to P55, the Prosecution also cross-examined the Accused as to his \nsexuality, whereupon he testified that he was heterosexual and had no sexual \n157 NE 2\/2\/2018, at  p 47. \n158 NE 2\/2\/2018, at  p 47.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v BNO [2018]  SGHC  243\n34interest in males.159 Based on these answers to questions  regarding his \nsexuality and P55 posed  by the Prosecution,  the Prosecution argued that the \nAccused had lowered  his character shield. \n64 It is unnecessary for me to make  any comment as to whether being  \nheterosexual is evidence of a person\u2019s  good character or disposition; I will \nanalyse the parties\u2019  submissions  in the framework of s 56 because  the parties \nhad presented their submissions  as such. In any event, the Accused\u2019s evidence \nof having \u201cstrong  ethical values\u201d  was arguably an assertion of good \ndisposition.  I opined  that character  was put in issue as a result. However, upon \nfurther deliberation  and analysis, I have  come  to the position that the \nAccused\u2019s character shield was not lowered.  Although P55 was produced by \nthe Accused and P55 was intended  to show that he was a person of good \ndisposition, the Accused  did not tender this document  to court  nor seek to have \nit admitted.  I would not have had sight of this document and would not have \nknown of the Accused\u2019s  claim  to having  strong ethical  values  had the \nProsecution not tendered P55 to court. Similarly, the Accused\u2019s  testimony as \nto his sexuality only arose upon being cross-examined by the Prosecution.  \nNone of this testimony  was offered by the Accused of his own accord. In such \na situation, where the Prosecution has elicited this evidence through  cross-\nexamination, it may be said to have forced  the Accused\u2019s hand, and thus it \ncould not be said that the Accused had lowered his character  shield. \n65 This position is in line with a purposive reading of s 56(1) of the \nEvidence Act, which  sets out the exhaustive scenarios where the Prosecution \ncan call evidence  to establish that the accused is a person of bad disposition or \nreputation. Section 56(1) states:\n159 NE 2\/2\/2018, at  p 45. \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v BNO [2018]  SGHC  243\n35In any criminal proceedings, the accused may \u2013 \n(a) personally or by his advocate ask questions of any \nwitness with a view to establishing  directly or by implication  \nthat he is generally or in a particular  respect a person  of good \ndisposition or reputation;\n(b) himself give evidence tending to establish directly or by \nimplication that he is generally or in a particular respect such \na person; or\n(c) call a witness to give any such evidence. \nSections 56(1)(a) and 56(1)(c ) envision active steps being taken by the \naccused to adduce evidence as to his good character or disposition. Section \n56(1)(b)  uses the phrase \u201chimself  give evidence\u201d,  which may encompass  \ngiving evidence  during  cross-examination,  but it would be consistent with the \nother sections to interpret s 56(1)(b) as also requiring an active step initiated  \nby the accused to testify as to his good disposition  or reputation. This must be \ndistinguished from  a situation where the Accused is simply answering  \nquestions from the Prosecution under cross-examination; such a situation is \nnot the same as one where the accused  volunteers  evidence as to his good \ndisposition or reputation of his own accord.  Moreover, a restrictive  \ninterpretation of s 56(1)(b) is also warranted because s 56 is an exception  to \nthe prohibition  of questions  as to an accused\u2019s  bad disposition and character \nunder s 122(4) of the Evidence Act. It is only where the three scenarios set out \nin s 56(1)  apply that  an accused\u2019s character shield is lifted.\n66 As far as I am aware, there is no Singapore authority on this particular \nissue, ie, whether evidence given by an accused  during  cross-examination as \nto his alleged good disposition or reputation  in response to questions posed by \nthe Prosecution can be considered a lowering of his character shield. The \nEnglish case of R v Henry Beecham  [1921] 3 KB 464 (\u201cHenry Beecham\u201d) is \nhelpful in this regard. In that case, the defendant in cross-examination  was \nrepeatedly asked and pressed to answer  the question whether he bought the \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v BNO [2018]  SGHC  243\n36motor-car in question because it was capable  of being driven at high speed  and \nhe replied  at last that it \u201cdid not"}
{"casename":"2018_SGHC_244","fact":"'2\\u2003The facts are fairly straightforward. On 27 June 2014 at about 10.20am, Shoo Hui Meng (\u201cthe deceased\u201d) was riding pillion on Malaysian registered motorcycle no. JKK 2870 (\u201cthe motorcycle\u201d) along the Pan Island Expressway (\u201cthe PIE\u201d) when it was involved in a collision (\u201cthe accident\u201d) with motor vehicle no. SJF 8171L (\u201cthe car\u201d) driven by the second defendant. The motorcycle belonged to the deceased but it was the first defendant who was riding it at the time of the accident. 2', '3\\u2003The first defendant and the deceased were then colleagues working at a restaurant called Magic Chongqing Hot Pot (\u201cthe Restaurant\u201d) located at Tanglin Shopping Centre. 3', 'The deceased had started working at the Restaurant as a waitress about two months earlier followed shortly by the first defendant. As both were Malaysians and resided in Johor Bahru, they travelled to Singapore together to get to work. According to the plaintiff (who was the deceased\u2019s husband) and the first defendant, the deceased and the first defendant would take turns to ride and be pillion riders, of the motorcycle. 4', '4\\u2003At the time of the accident, the motorcycle was travelling in the third lane of the PIE in the direction of Changi Airport and was approaching the exit to Lornie Road when the car driven by the second defendant (who was in the lane to the right of the motorcycle) cut abruptly into the path of the motorcycle. The first defendant was unable to avoid the car even with braking and the rear of the motorcycle collided into the car as a result. The impact of the collision was so severe that both the first defendant and the deceased were flung off the motorcycle and caused them to roll on the ground. The deceased\u2019s helmet fell off in the process with the result that she suffered serious head injuries. She was unconscious and did not regain consciousness despite being warded and treated at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (\u201cTTSH\u201d) for 47 days. 5', 'She was then transferred to a hospital in Johor Baru Malaysia. The deceased passed away on 19 August 2017.', '5\\u2003The second defendant lodged a police report on the day of the accident while the plaintiff lodged a police report of the accident a day later, based on what the first defendant told him. 6', 'The first defendant herself only lodged a police report some five months later on 3 December 2014. 7', 'In court, the first defendant explained her delay in lodging the police report - she only lodged the report after being told to do so by the police. 8', '6\\u2003Due to the deceased\u2019s mental incapacity, the plaintiff applied to the High Court of Malaya at Johor Bahru on 26 October 2015 and obtained an order of court to be her litigation representative. 9', '7\\u2003On 30 November 2016, the plaintiff commenced the Suit against both defendants. In the statement of claim, the plaintiff inter alia alleged that the first defendant was riding at an excessive speed while the second defendant was driving at an excessive speed. Further, they failed to keep a proper lookout, failed to maintain a safe and\/or reasonable distance from each other\u2019s vehicles and failed to take steps to avoid a collision. 10', '8\\u2003The first defendant accepted service of the proceedings in Singapore on 13 December 2016 but failed to enter an appearance. Apparently the insurers of the motorcycle were not prepared to assist the first defendant to defend the Suit as they took the position that insurance coverage of the motorcycle did not extend to the pillion rider. 11', 'Consequently, the first defendant did not take part in these proceedings.', '9\\u2003The second defendant on the other hand entered an appearance to the proceedings and filed a defence wherein he denied he was negligent and caused the accident. He put the blame for the accident squarely on the first defendant alleging inter alia that the motorcycle had collided into the rear of the car which was proceeding straight in the right lane, that she failed to maintain a safe distance from the car and failed to keep a proper lookout for the car. 12', '10\\u2003After the accident, the police brought criminal charges against the first defendant on 12 March 2016 under s 337(b) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe criminal charge\u201d). 13', 'On 11 April 2016, the first defendant pleaded guilty to the charge, and was convicted and fined $2,500. 14', '11\\u2003After the deceased passed away on 19 August 2017, the plaintiff applied for letters of administration of her estate to be granted to him; the grant was issued on 24 January 2018. The plaintiff further obtained an order of court on 14 February 2018 to continue the proceedings in the Suit which eventually came on for trial before this court. 15', '12\\u2003The witnesses who testified at the trial for the plaintiff\u2019s case were the plaintiff, the first defendant, and a third party witness. The third party witness for the plaintiff was one Mageshwaran Jayaraman (\u201cJayaraman\u201d) who was called at the court\u2019s behest. Jayaraman was the officer from Certis CISCO who prepared the sketch plan of the accident scene at the material time. 16', 'The first defendant\u2019s evidence was not by way of an affidavit of evidence in chief (\u201cAEIC\u201d) but adduced viva voce as she was subpoenaed by the plaintiff.', '13\\u2003The second defendant was the only witness for his own case. He produced a video recording of the accident which was played in court and which played a crucial role in the court\u2019s findings.', '14\\u2003The plaintiff was then also working in Singapore as a construction worker on a site in Toa Payoh. In his AEIC, the plaintiff deposed that on the morning of 27 June 2014, he received a telephone call from the deceased\u2019s younger sister informing him that the deceased was involved in an accident. He rushed to the scene of the accident on his motorcycle but was told by people at the scene that the deceased had been conveyed to TTSH. He then went to TTSH where upon arrival, he found that the deceased had undergone emergency surgery for her serious injuries. 17', '15\\u2003While waiting at TTHS for the deceased\u2019s operation to be over. the plaintiff met the first defendant who briefed him on how the accident happened. 18', 'Subsequently, the first defendant gave him a statement in Mandarin giving greater details of the accident. 19', 'The defendant had informed him she was not at fault in regard to the accident and that she pleaded guilty to the criminal charge (at [10]) out of convenience. Based on what the first defendant told him, the plaintiff lodged a police report of the accident on 28 June 2014. 20', '16\\u2003Nothing turned on the plaintiff\u2019s testimony as his evidence with regard to the accident was hearsay based on what was told to him by the first defendant. However, notwithstanding the fact that he did not witness the accident, the plaintiff disagreed with counsel for the second defendant when it was put to him that the first defendant was responsible for causing the accident. 21', 'The plaintiff had seen the second defendant\u2019s video and noted therefrom that the second defendant was driving the car at an excessive speed and changed lanes suddenly. He had then applied the brakes and lost control of the car. 22', '17\\u2003The plaintiff testified that when he arrived at the accident scene within 20 - 30 minutes after the accident, the car was no longer at the scene. He noted that there were skid marks caused by the pedal of the motorcycle. 23', 'If the first defendant was to be blamed for the accident, the plaintiff opined it was for a \u201cminor\u201d part. 24', '18\\u2003The first defendant was a witness for the plaintiff without having filed an AEIC and without legal representation due to her lack of means. The court had directed counsel for the plaintiff at an earlier pre-trial conference to prepare a list of questions to be put to the first defendant. The first defendant\u2019s testimony was adduced based on that questionnaire.', '19\\u2003 According to the first defendant, when she first saw the car, it was traveling in the extreme right (fast) lane in the direction of Changi Airport while she was riding in the motorcycle at 80-90 kph in the adjoining second lane alongside and about one motorcycle length behind the car. 25', 'Suddenly, the car shifted to her lane at an excessive speed without signalling. 26', 'She applied the brakes of the motorcycle and turned the motorcycle to the right to try to maintain her balance but the front of the motorcycle collided into the rear of the car with a loud bang. 27', 'Immediately thereafter, the car moved back to the first lane and sped off.', '20\\u2003The first defendant and the deceased were both flung off when the motorcycle fell on its right side into the first lane. 28', 'The first defendant closed her eyes until she stopped rolling on the ground for 1-2 minutes (which she estimated may have been a distance of 3-4 metres). 29', 'She then went over to the deceased whose eyes were totally closed. The first defendant repeatedly called the deceased\u2019s name but the former did not respond. 30', 'The first defendant noticed the deceased\u2019s helmet had fallen off her head and her ear was torn. 31', 'She stayed with the deceased until an ambulance came and took the deceased to TTHS. 32', '21\\u2003Although she only suffered bruises and abrasions from the collision, the first defendant testified she hurt her right shoulder when she fell from the motorcycle and to-date her shoulder still hurts whenever it rains. 33', '22\\u2003When questioned on why she pleaded guilty to the criminal charge (of causing hurt by an act which endangers life or the personal safety of others), the first defendant explained she was afraid she would have to keep attending court otherwise. Hence, she pleaded guilty even though she blamed the second defendant for the accident. 34', 'She pointed out that the Statement of Facts (\u201cthe Statement\u201d) prepared by the prosecution for her to plead guilty to the criminal charge was incorrect when it stated (at para 4) that she was riding the motorcycle in lane 1 \u2013 she was in lane 2 before the accident. 35', 'The first defendant was unable to recall whether the Statement was interpreted to her at the material time. 36', 'She was assigned a counsel who acted on a pro bono basis as she did not have the means to engage a lawyer to represent her in the criminal proceedings. 37', '23\\u2003In cross-examination, the first defendant disclosed she was originally riding the motorcycle in lane 4 before slowly shifting to the right to lane 2. She did so because there were other vehicles in lanes 3 and 4. 38', '24\\u2003Counsel for the second defendant drew the first defendant\u2019s attention to her police report wherein she made no mention that she applied the brakes of the motorcycle or that she swerved the motorcycle to the right before the collision. 39', 'Given that her police report was made six months after the accident (see [5]) and that the first defendant neither reads, writes nor speaks English and was educated in Malaysia in the Malay language, it is not surprising that her police report contained errors. The objective evidence from the sketch plan showed skid marks made by the motorcycle over quite a distance which clearly indicated that the first defendant did apply the brakes of the motorcycle to no avail. 40', '25\\u2003In his AEIC, the second defendant (who is a freelance photographer) deposed that on the morning of the accident, he was driving to his office at Great Easten Life Building at 200, Changi Road on the PIE travelling in the first (right most) lane. Near the exit to Lornie Road, a red vehicle no SDX 2369A (\u201cthe red car\u201d) in the first lane ahead of him stopped suddenly. The second defendant braked the car and slowed down. As he applied his brakes, the motorcycle collided into the rear right side of the car. He heard a skidding sound and an impact to the rear of the car. 41', 'As a result of the collision, the rear right portion of the car was dented and scratched while the front part of the motorcycle was badly damaged. 42', '26\\u2003The second defendant deposed he was shocked and drove to the chevron near the Lornie Road exit before he called for the police. 43', 'He waited and when the police did not contact him, he went back to the scene of the accident where the police recorded a statement from him. 44', 'As instructed by the police, the second defendant drove the car to the police academy at Thomson Road and left it there for purposes of investigations. 45', 'Subsequently, the car was returned to him.', '27\\u2003The second defendant also informed the police that he had an in-vehicle camera that captured footage of the traffic ahead of him. The police took away the video footage which was later returned to him. Due to a glitch in the in-vehicle camera, the date shown in the footage was 26 June 2014 but the second defendant deposed that the video footage was indeed taken on 27 June 2014. 46', '28\\u2003On the afternoon of the accident, the second defendant lodged a police report followed by a Singapore Accident Report on 4 August 2014. 47', 'The second defendant deposed that he found out from a letter dated 25 April 2016 from the police that the first defendant was convicted of the criminal offence (see [10]). 48', '29\\u2003In cross-examination, the second defendant maintained he kept quite a distance with the red car in the first lane while travelling at about 88-90 kph. 49', 'He swerved to the left and stepped on his brakes when the red car suddenly braked. 50', 'He noticed from his rear view mirror that all the other vehicles behind him were similarly braking. He then heard a skidding sound and felt an impact presumably when the motorcycle hit the car. 51', 'The second defendant said he slowly filtered to the left (second) lane. 52', 'He claimed it was his practice to signal when changing lanes 53', 'although he could not recall whether he signalled in this case when he filtered to the second lane.', '30\\u2003Questioned by counsel for the plaintiff as well as the court on why he did not stop the car as would be expected of anyone involved in a road accident, the second defendant claimed it was because he was \u201cshocked\u201d. 54', 'That was why he moved to the shoulder of the road.', '31\\u2003 The second defendant disagreed with counsel\u2019s suggestion that he cut into the second lane and that was why the collision took place. Counsel pointed out that the video footage showed a jerk which was when the car cut into the second lane and was hit by the motorcycle. The second defendant disagreed and claimed that the jerk was due to his braking immediately when the red card braked. 55', '32\\u2003Although in his AEIC and in court the second defendant deposed he waited a while\/quite long for the police to arrive (and called them a few times as well), 56', 'he was unable in cross-examination to give any estimate at all of how long he waited for the police. 57', 'Even more strange was the fact that his AEIC made no mention whatsoever of where the deceased and the first defendant landed after the collision nor of the position of the motorcycle or of the arrival of the ambulance. Indeed, the second defendant testified he did not see either the deceased or the ambulance when he returned to the scene of the accident. 58', 'He did not even know who was riding the motorcycle at the time of the accident. Counsel drew the second defendant\u2019s attention to his police report where it was stated that he', 'The second defendant testified the above extract from his police report was incorrect \u2013 he was given the information by the police, he himself did not see what happened after the accident. 60', '33\\u2003The second defendant admitted the fact of his swerving left (as he claimed) was also not stated in his police report. 61', 'Questioned on this glaring omission and despite being pressed by the court for an answer, 62', 'the second defendant could not explain his omission, after considerable prevarication. However, he denied counsel\u2019s suggestion that the accident happened because he had swerved abruptly into the second lane. He further disagreed that had he told the police that fact, the subsequent investigations would have focussed along those lines and he may perhaps have been found largely or solely responsible for the accident. 63', '34\\u2003The court had also questioned the second defendant on how the accident occurred. The court pointed out to the second defendant that if his version of the accident (that the collision was when the car was in the first lane) was to be believed, the damage to the car from the front to rear collision would have been more to the middle portion of the back of the car. 64', 'Instead, the damage to the car (more to the right of the rear) suggested that it was consistent with the first defendant\u2019s version that the car suddenly cut into the path of the motorcycle in the second lane causing the motorcycle to collide into the car\u2019s right rear end despite her swerving to avoid the collision. The second defendant disagreed with the court\u2019s analysis. 65', '35\\u2003Counsel for the second defendant had questioned the second defendant and the latter confirmed that he did not know where the motorcycle was just before the accident. 66', 'It was obvious to the court that this was due to the fact that the motorcycle was in a blind spot or too close to the car where neither the rear view mirror nor the car\u2019s side mirrors could capture its location.', '36\\u2003The last witness called by the plaintiff was Jayaraman (see [12]), the Certis CISCO officer who at the material time prepared the sketch plan. 67', 'Jayaraman testified that his services would have been activated by the Land Transport Authority. 68', 'He revealed that the motorcycle was not in its original position when he arrived at the accident scene (someone at the scene must have told him) but the car was in its original position. 69', 'Jayaraman testified he made the sketch plan based on what he saw at the accident scene. 70', 'He was not aware nor was he told that the car had been driven off after the accident and that it returned subsequently and was parked in the first lane, not where the collision took place. 71', '37\\u2003Significantly, the sketch plan showed a long skid mark made by the motorcycle that swerved to the right from the second lane to the first (fast) lane.', '38\\u2003As alluded to earlier (at [13]), the video footage from the second defendant\u2019s in-vehicle camera played a significant role in the court\u2019s findings that the second, not the first, defendant was largely responsible for causing the accident. It was after the court had reviewed the video footage that it arrived at its findings on liability. Based on the video footage, the collision took place at 0.05 timing when the car was travelling at 87 kph and there was a sudden jerk when the motorcycle hit the car\u2019s rear. The impact even caused the second defendant\u2019s earphones to be flung forward as they appeared next to his glasses on the dashboard where previously only his glasses were placed there. Consistent with the first defendant\u2019s testimony, the video showed the collision took place when the car was in the second lane where the motorcycle was being ridden.', '39\\u2003Consequently, based on the video footage, the court concluded that the second not the first defendant was largely responsible for the accident that took the life of the plaintiff\u2019s wife and caused the innocent first defendant to be subject to and convicted of the criminal charge.', '40\\u2003The court was of the view that the second defendant stage-managed the accident scene and in doing so, he threw the police authorities off their track in their investigations into the accident. 72', '41\\u2003The court accepted the first defendant\u2019s version of how and where the accident happened because her version was consistent with the video footage and the sketch plan. The car which was travelling in the first (fast) lane had cut abruptly into the path of the motorcycle when the red car in front braked suddenly. The second defendant similarly braked his car but decided to switch lanes either to overtake the red car or to avoid colliding into it. In so doing, he could not\/did not see the motorcycle which just before the collision was almost alongside the car.', '42\\u2003As the first defendant had testified, she swerved to the right to try to avoid the car but the front of the motorcycle hit the right side of the car that had encroached into her path from the first lane. The first defendant and the deceased were flung off the motorcycle to the right and rolled on the road for some distance. When she opened her eyes, she saw the car speeding off.', '43\\u2003In contrast, the second defendant\u2019s version of events was not credible, especially if seen against the backdrop of his less than honest account provided to the police in his report made in the afternoon of 27 June 2014. 73', 'Although he clearly did not stop at the accident scene, he told the police that he \u201ccalled for the police and made a check on both the rider and the pillion\u201d. While he claims that those words were not his, his explanation was not credible. First, the police would not have known whether he stopped to check on the deceased and first defendant or not, and the only way they would have obtained this information is if it came from the second defendant. Second, this statement was clearly part of an attempt by the second defendant to evade criminal responsibility for his actions. He had also omitted to mention that he abruptly swerved left into the second lane before the motorcycle collided with his car. His explanation for this omission was that the police did not ask about him swerving left and because he did not know this was an important fact. 74', 'It was unbelievable. Any reasonable person would know that the second defendant\u2019s leftward swerve before the accident was an important, indeed critical, fact for any inquiry meant to establish the true sequence of events leading up to and immediately after the accident. The only reason why he did not mention this fact to the police was because he wanted to push the blame for the accident onto the first defendant.', '44\\u2003Although the second defendant did return to the scene of the accident after leaving the chevron and volunteered his in-vehicle camera footage to the police officers present, the footage would not have shown how the motorcycle came to make contact with his vehicle. It would not have stood in the way of his attempts to absolve himself of any fault.', '45\\u2003Thus, on a balance of probabilities, the court found that the second defendant was not a credible witness. Instead, his version of events to the police and to this court were attempts to evade criminal and civil liability for the accident. They were calculated moves by the second defendant who managed thereby to push the entire responsibility for the accident onto the innocent first defendant. As I said in court, the second defendant\u2019s conduct was reprehensible to say the least.'"}

The \ntwo email announcements  on the May Price Protection stated that \u201c[t]he \ncalculation is based on the previous four weeks invoiced sales  (pickup)  from \nIMM; this is in alignment with previous communications from  BlackBerry\u201d and \n\u201cthe previous four weeks include  weeks  16, 17, 18 and 19\u201d.1 On top of that, the \nfirst email announcement states that the sum of price protection for SCM was \nUS$23,520, and the second email  announcement stated that \u201cthe inventory \nsupport amounts  per unit is: 9220 @ 14 per unit for the 1,680 units invoiced \nduring WK16\u201d, meaning that the price  protection  was US$14 for each of the \n1680 units of Blackberry 9220 invoiced in week  16, amounting to a total price \nprotection of  US$23,520.\n13 SCM\u2019s position is that the price protection should be calculated based  \non the number  of units  picked up during weeks  16 to 19 as reflected under the \ndata entry \u201cPick up order to Distributor\u201d  in the Compass Tool (\u201cRCP\u201d). The \nRCP was a data system created  by Blackberry  and used by Blackberry,  \nBrightPoint and SCM to monitor, plan and manage sales, forecasts, orders, \nshipments and inventory.  Using the number  of units picked up as reflected in \nthe RCP, the price protection  should be US$544,720. Originally, SCM claimed  \nfor US$813,912.60,  based on the number  of units  reflected  in the RCP at a price \n1 Agreed Bundle vol 1 (\u201c1AB\u201d)  at pp 554 and  569.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPT Surya Citra  Multimedia v Brightpoint Singapore  Pte Ltd [2018]  SGHC  245\n6protection per unit of US$15.51, but this claim was amended to US$544,720 \nafter Sugianto conceded at trial that the price protection per unit was US$14,  \nbased on BrightPoint\u2019s second email  announcement on the May Price \nProtection.\n14 In the alternative,  SCM alleges that BrightPoint has received funding  \nfrom Blackberry or by way of an accrual fund for the price protection in the sum \nof US$300,000 or alternatively US$250,000.  The thrust of this alternative claim  \nis unknown. Presumably, SCM  wishes to claim  the money received by \nBrightPoint, but it did not plead the basis for this entitlement. In the further \nalternative, SCM claims that there  was an agreement made on or about 11 \nSeptember 2013 that BrightPoint was to provide  price protection in the sum of \nUS$300,000 for the reductions in retail prices of Blackberry 9790 and \nBlackberry 9900 (collectively known as Blackberry Bold).  \n15 On the other hand, BrightPoint\u2019s position is that SCM is only entitled  to \nprice protection in the amount of US$23,520 calculated based on 1680 units of \nBlackberry 9220  at a price protection of US$14  per unit, as communicated  to \nSCM at the material  time.  The 1680 units were  BrightPoint\u2019s invoiced sales to \nSCM in weeks 16 to 19, and not based on the data in RCP. In relation to SCM\u2019s  \npleading in the alternative, BrightPoint  maintains that Blackberry  did not \nprovide any price protection by way of an accrual fund or transfer of funds for \nthe four models of Blackberry mobile phones, and explains that the accrual \nfunds were utilised for a number of purposes, of which price protection was only \none. BrightPoint  further denies the alleged agreement to provide price \nprotection on or about  11 September 2013. Its position was that an offer of full \nand final settlement in the sum of US$300,000 had been made, which  SCM \nrejected while continuing to press for the  full payment of US$813,912.60.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPT Surya Citra  Multimedia v Brightpoint Singapore  Pte Ltd [2018]  SGHC  245\n716 At this juncture, it is apposite to explain  the disparities between the data \nin the RCP and the actual invoiced units during  weeks 16 to 19. SCM  came to \nan agreement  with BrightPoint to pick up the units scheduled for weeks 14 to \n17 via ex-works  shipment on 30 March 2013 (meaning that SCM would pick \nup the stocks directly  from BrightPoint\u2019s  warehouse  in Singapore). Although  \nthe units  were picked up on 30 March  2013 (which  was before week 14), they \nwere entered  under weeks 16 to 19 in the RCP.  The pick-ups in week 13 were \nalso reported under weeks  16 to 19. It is not disputed  that the data entered into \nthe RCP does not reflect the true state of the pick-ups; the dispute is on which  \ndata set is eligible for  price protection. \nThe November Price Protection  \n17 The November Price  Protection relates to the price protection for \nBlackberry Q5 and Blackberry  Q10 models. SCM takes  the position  that \nBrightPoint afforded price  protection  of US$271,285 for Blackberry Q5 and \nUS$1,388,000 for Blackberry Q10, and BrightPoint has breached the Price \nProtection Clause  by refusing  to give the price  protection. The dispute concerns \nthe construction of the condition to the November Price Protection. The \ncondition according to the email sent by BrightPoint on 6 November  2013 states \nthat \u201c[p]rice  protection will be issued via Credit  Note (CN)  and is dependent  \nupon future Payment  & Pickup  commitments\u201d,2 and the condition according to \nthe second  email sent by BrightPoint on 8 November 2013 states that \u201cPickup \nPlan is  required before  CN can be issued\u201d.3 \n18 BrightPoint  takes the position  that SCM  is not entitled to the November \nPrice Protection because  it neglected  to meet the condition by only partially \n2 Agreed Bundle vol 3 (\u201c3AB\u201d)  at pp 1735 and  1736. \n3 3AB at pp 1748 and 1749. \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPT Surya Citra  Multimedia v Brightpoint Singapore  Pte Ltd [2018]  SGHC  245\n8picking up the stocks of Blackberry Q5 and Blackberry Q10 that it had ordered, \nand failing, refusing and\/or neglecting to pick up the remaining stocks, which \namounted to 15,100  units  of Blackberry  Q5 and 17,630 units  of Blackberry  Q10 \n(\u201cthe committed stocks\u201d). SCM\u2019s  case is that the condition did not stipulate that \nit needed to pick up the committed stocks, so a fulfilment of a future  pick-up \ncommitment of any model would satisfy the condition, and that the condition  \nreferred to commitments  to be entered  into in the future. SCM also alleges that \nBrightPoint stated verbally  that SCM  could pick up any model to satisfy the \ncondition.\n19 In any case, SCM claims that there  was no existing  commitment to pick \nup the committed stocks because the delivery  dates in the purchase orders \n(\u201cPOs\u201d) of Blackberry  Q5 and Blackberry Q10 had passed, on the basis that \ntime of delivery was of the essence, and that any subsequent  pick-up would be \nsubject to the mutual agreement of the parties. SCM  also argues that BrightPoint \ncould not impose  the condition it alleges because it was not imposed by \nBlackberry. In the alternative,  SCM alleges that BrightPoint has received \nfunding from Blackberry or by way of an accrual  fund for the price protection. \nSimilarly, SCM  presumably wishes to claim the money received by BrightPoint, \nbut it did not plead  the basis  for this entitlement.  In the further alternative, SCM \nclaims that there was an agreement made  on or about 25 November  2013 for \nBrightPoint to provide the price  protection  of US$1,659,285, when Sokhal of \nBrightPoint informed that the price  protection  for Blackberry  Q5 and \nBlackberry Q10 would be paid and that the credit notes had been sent to \nBlackberry for  processing. \n20 Except for the point that BrightPoint has received funds  from  Blackberry \ncovering the price protection,  BrightPoint denies SCM\u2019s claims. In relation to \nthe alleged agreement, BrightPoint argues that Sokhal  merely  said that \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPT Surya Citra  Multimedia v Brightpoint Singapore  Pte Ltd [2018]  SGHC  245\n9BrightPoint would escalate  SCM\u2019s  claim  to Blackberry and revert if Blackberry  \napproved SCM\u2019s claim. In any case, BrightPoint contends that Sokhal did not \nhave any authority to promise payment of US$1,659,285.\nCounterclaims \n21 BrightPoint  claims that SCM, in breach of the Sub-Distributor  \nAgreement, failed, refused and\/or neglected  to take delivery of 15,680 units  of \nBlackberry 9720  and 4200 units of Blackberry  9900, which  it had ordered  from \nBrightPoint. As a result, BrightPoint sold the 15,680 units of Blackberry 9720 \nto third parties at prices lower than the price quoted in SCM\u2019s PO, and suffered \na loss of US$80,890.50. Similarly  for Blackberry  9900, BrightPoint suffered  a \nloss of US$477,895  after selling the units to third parties. \n22 SCM\u2019s case in relation to both counterclaims  is that it did not have any \nobligation to pick up the units because BrightPoint  was unable  to deliver them \nby the delivery dates set out in the POs.  Any subsequent pick-up after the \ndelivery dates was subject  to mutual agreement. \nDecision on SCM\u2019s claims\nThe May Price Protection \nThe calculation of the  price protection \n23 The Price Protection Clause (see [5] supra) makes it clear that price \nprotection was to be afforded  by Blackberry, and that BrightPoint  reserved  the \nright to vary any such price protection  at any time by notice in writing. \nBlackberry had the discretion  to set the price protection whenever it saw fit to \nafford such protection.  Even if SCM did not agree  with the calculation of price \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPT Surya Citra  Multimedia v Brightpoint Singapore  Pte Ltd [2018]  SGHC  245\n10protection, it only had as much price protection as afforded  by Blackberry, \nsubject to any variations by BrightPoint. \n24 From  the outset, the May Price  Protection,  along with its terms and \nconditions, was duly afforded by Blackberry. Birch of BrightPoint had sought \nand obtained Mastroianni\u2019s approval of the terms  of the May Price Protection, \nas evidenced by Birch\u2019s  internal email  to Williams dated 29 May 2013.4 Birch \nreported that it was agreed with Mastroianni inter alia that the price  protection \nper unit for each Blackberry  9220 was to be US$14 and the price protection \nwould cover units  in the last four weeks before  the price reduction. Sugianto \nand Utomo  confirmed that the May Price  Protection was approved by \nBlackberry. \n25 I find that it is clear from the email announcements  from BrightPoint on \nthe May Price Protection  that the calculation of the quantum was based  on the \nactual number  of units invoiced  from week  16 to week 19. In the first email \nannouncement sent on 3 June 2013, BrightPoint stated that the \u201ccalculation is \nbased on the previous four weeks invoiced sales (pickup) from  IMM\u201d and stated  \nthe price protection sum to be US$23,520, which corresponded to the \ncalculation based on the actual number  of units invoiced and picked up by SCM \nfrom week 16 to week 19. It is not disputed that invoiced sales referred to the \ninvoices issued by BrightPoint to SCM  following pick-ups of stocks by SCM,  \nwhether via ex-works or via Carriage  and Insurance Paid To (CIP)  shipment.  \nThe email sent on the following day further confirmed that the price protection \nwas US$14  for each of the 1680 units Blackberry 9220  invoiced in week 16, \namounting to a  total  price  protection of US$23,520. \n4 1AB at pp 527 and 528.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPT Surya Citra  Multimedia v Brightpoint Singapore  Pte Ltd [2018]  SGHC  245\n1126 BrightPoint\u2019s reply to SCM\u2019s  dispute on the calculation further reveals \nthe unsustainability of SCM\u2019s argument.  In the reply, BrightPoint \nunequivocally confirmed that the calculations stated in the two email  \nannouncements were correct. It was explained  that the price protection per unit \nof Blackberry 9220 was fixed at US$14 by Blackberry, and that the units \nqualifying for price protection were the \u201cACTUAL quantity\u201d units  invoiced.5 \nSCM correctly conceded during the trial that because Blackberry had the \ndiscretion to dictate the amount of price  protection and it had fixed  the price \nprotection per unit at US$14, it had no claim for US$15.51 per unit. Therefore, \nthe statement of claim was amended  from a claim  of US$813,912.60 to a claim \nof US$544,720. I find that not only was the amount of price protection  per unit \nclear (as conceded by SCM), the method of determining the units qualifying for \nprice protection was also clear. BrightPoint had communicated from the very \nstart that the quantity  was to be calculated  based on the invoiced sales from \nweek 16 to week 19 giving a price protection amounting to a total of US$23,520, \nand it had clarified that invoiced  sales referred to the actual  invoiced  sales,  \nwhich amounted  to 1680 units  of Blackberry  9220. \n27 BrightPoint\u2019s budgeting of the May Price Protection, which  was carried \nout before the price protection announcements, also shows  that the price  \nprotection was calculated based  on invoiced sales.  After approval from  \nBlackberry but prior  to announcing the price protection to SCM, Williams \ncalculated the price protection for SCM  to be US$23,520.  Williams sent this \ncalculation to Birch  and Wong on 29 May 2013, and  Wong gave the go-ahead.6 \nIn another budgeting document, it was similarly stated that the amount  for the \nprice protection allocated to  SCM was US$23,520.7\n5 Agreed Bundle vol 2 (\u201c2AB\u201d)  at p 839.\n6 1AB at pp 527\u2013528. \n7 Agreed Bundle vol 5 (\u201c5AB\u201d)  at p 3164. \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPT Surya Citra  Multimedia v Brightpoint Singapore  Pte Ltd [2018]  SGHC  245\n1228 Furthermore,  the email  correspondence between BrightPoint and \nBlackberry, after the dispute  arose, shows that SCM\u2019s claim was not acceptable \nto Blackberry. Mastroianni emailed BrightPoint  on 21 November  2013, stating \nthat Blackberry  supported the payment  of US$23,500  to SCM, which was in \nalignment with the previous decision  of BrightPoint, but not SCM\u2019s claim,  \nbecause \u201cSCM manipulated RCP reporting  to reflect inaccurate information\u201d  \nand RCP did not reflect the units \u201cimported  by SCM [in the 30-day period]\u201d.8\n29 SCM, on the other hand, alleges that the data in the RCP has always  \nbeen used to calculate  price protections,  as testified  by Utomo  and Sugianto. \nSCM claims that it must  have been  the intent of Blackberry to use pick-ups to \ncalculate the price protection because Blackberry had access to the data under \nthe entry \u201cPick Up Order to Distributor\u201d  entered  into RCP but no access  to the \ninvoices issued  by BrightPoint. This was why, SCM posits, the word \u201c(pickup)\u201d \nwas added to the phrase \u201cinvoiced sales\u201d  in the announcement emails. SCM  also \nplaces reliance on the phrase \u201cin alignment with previous communications from \nBlackberry\u201d stated in the emails announcements. SCM claims that Blackberry \nhad relied on the data in the RCP  in the previous instance of price protection  \ngiven in February 2013 for the price  reductions  of Blackberry 9790 and \nBlackberry 9900 (the \u201cFebruary Price Protection\u201d), as shown by Utomo\u2019s email  \nto SCM dated 20 February 2013.9 Utomo set out the calculations for the \nFebruary Price Protection based  on the lesser of the units of Blackberry  models \n\u201cSOH\u201d (ie, stock on hand) or \u201c4wks ship\u201d (ie, four weeks\u2019 shipment).  SCM \nclaims that the data for stock on hand was taken from the data entry \u201cProjected \nInventory\u201d in RCP while  four weeks\u2019  shipment referred to the number  of units \n8 Agreed Bundle vol 4 (\u201c4AB\u201d)  at p 2245. \n9 1AB at p 195. \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPT Surya Citra  Multimedia v Brightpoint Singapore  Pte Ltd [2018]  SGHC  245\n13shipped to SCM in the four weeks prior  to the date of price reduction and was \ntaken from the data entry \u201cPick Up Order to Distributor\u201d in  RCP. \n30 In response, BrightPoint claims that the February Price Protection as \nannounced, referred  to \u201cFour Weeks Invoiced Units\u201d, which was similarly  \nbased on invoiced sales  and not on data from the RCP. For reference,  the price \nprotection announcement from BrightPoint is reproduced as follows:10\nPrice Protection  \nThe new invoice price is eligible for Price  Protection  (PP); PP is \ncalculated based  on the lesser per model  unit quantity of either:\n\uf0b7Four Weeks  Invoiced  Units~ previous four weeks \ninvoiced units from BP\n\uf0b7Stock on Hand ~ SOH as reported in the Compass Tool \n31 Subsequent to the announcement  made by Williams, Utomo sent the \nemail, upon which  SCM relies. BrightPoint  argues  that the calculations included \nin Utomo\u2019s email were  wrong because  they were  based on the number  of units \nshipped in the four weeks prior to the price reduction rather than on invoiced \nunits. Utomo agreed that the words used in Williams\u2019  emails were \u201cinvoiced\u201d \nand he had used \u201cship[ped]\u201d  instead (and calculated the numbers based on units  \nshipped), but insisted that the two words were equivalent, without providing any \nevidence. This was despite his lack of knowledge  as to when BrightPoint  issued \ninvoices for deliveries via ex-works and deliveries via CIP.11 BrightPoint on the \nother hand was able to produce contemporaneous documents  to show the \ndifferences in the numbers of units invoiced and units  shipped.  These  \ndocuments were attached to the email  sent by Williams to Mastroianni  on 8 \nMarch 2013 asking for his approval  to use the accruals for inter alia, the price  \nprotection of US$328,645.93 for SCM.12 In arriving at the figure  of \n10 1AB at pp 193 and 194. \n11 (\u201cNotes of Evidence\u201d) NE Day 4 at p 24\u201326. \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPT Surya Citra  Multimedia v Brightpoint Singapore  Pte Ltd [2018]  SGHC  245\n14US$328,645.93, the lesser of the SOH data as reported  in the RCP and units  \ninvoiced for each model was used.   Given the differences in the numbers of \nunits invoiced and units shipped, the figure  that Utomo  calculated \u2013 \nUS$229,038 \u2013 was different from that calculated  by BrightPoint. It is notable  \nthat US$328,645.93  was actually given to SCM.13 The data for invoiced sales \nwas not obtained  from the RCP, which means  that even for the February Price \nProtection, the data used was not fully obtained  from the RCP,  contrary to \nSCM\u2019s claim. SCM takes  issue with the fact that BrightPoint\u2019s calculation  was \nnot put to Utomo  on the stand, so he was not given a chance to respond. Nothing \nturns on this criticism. I find that it was not necessary  for the calculation  to have  \nbeen put to Utomo \u2013 Utomo had already testified that \u201cinvoiced\u201d  and \n\u201cship[ped]\u201d meant  exactly the same  to him, and Utomo was not privy to \nBrightPoint\u2019s calculation  at the material  time. There was nothing to be gained  \nfrom cross-examining Utomo on BrightPoint\u2019s  calculation.\n32 SCM further  claims that the inaccurate reporting of data in RCP from  \nweek 16 to week 19 was at the suggestion of BrightPoint.  SCM argues that since \nBrightPoint was the party which suggested the inaccurate reporting, BrightPoint \ncannot now claim that the data in the RCP is inaccurate. In any case, BrightPoint \ncannot claim the data to be inaccurate  because  it was reported based  on the \nmutual understanding  of both parties. \n33 I find that it is not important on the facts  as to which  party had requested \nthe RCP reporting.  Regardless of which party  had first requested the reporting, \nand regardless of whether  the data was based on the mutual  agreement of both \nparties, the data remains objectively inaccurate  because it does not reflect the \ntrue state of affairs that took place. It is not disputed  that the data in the RCP  \n12 1AB at p 214; Exhibit D8, at p 2.\n13 1AB at p 259. \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPT Surya Citra  Multimedia v Brightpoint Singapore  Pte Ltd [2018]  SGHC  245\n15does not reflect the actual  pick-ups during weeks  16 to 19. In any case, whether \nthe data in the RCP is accurate  or not does not change the fact that it had been \ncommunicated clearly  by BrightPoint that the calculation was to be based on \nactual invoiced units, without any mention that the calculation was to be based \non the data in the RCP. The inaccuracy of the RCP data does not add much to \nthe crucial issue  of what had been communicated in the price protection \nannouncements.  \n34 Given  that much  has been  ventilated on the issue of the genesis  of the \ninaccurate RCP reporting, I venture  to state that the data reported was based  on \nthe mutual understanding of both parties.  An internal BrightPoint email dated  \n12 June 2013  stated that the parties had \u201ca mutual understanding\u201d on the RCP \nreporting,14 and Wong and Tan testified that the reporting was done  based on a \nmutual understanding. The internal  BrightPoint email  actually shows that it was \nprobably SCM  which had first requested the reporting, because in it, Williams \nexpressed frustration at SCM\u2019s claim for the May Price Protection even  though \nBrightPoint had supported SCM by agreeing  to delivery via ex-works  and \nagreed to \u201ctheir\u201d RCP reporting. An internal SCM email similarly  supports  the \ninference that it was SCM which had requested the inaccurate  RCP  reporting.15 \nIn that email, Huang  of SCM stated that based on confirmation from Tan, the \n(inaccurate) data could be entered into RCP.  The inference  drawn is therefore  \nthat Tan confirmed SCM\u2019s request.  Furthermore, Sugianto  conceded  that it was \nSCM which had requested to take delivery  earlier than the scheduled timings.16 \nSCM submits that the email sent by Tan on 15 April  2013 stating the actual  \nshipment dates for the units  scheduled in weeks  14 to 16 shows  that the RCP \nreporting was done based on Tan\u2019s instructions.17 However, there was no \n14 2AB at p 963.\n15 1AB at p 390. \n16 NE Day  1 at p 130. \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPT Surya Citra  Multimedia v Brightpoint Singapore  Pte Ltd [2018]  SGHC  245\n16indication that it contained  instructions for RCP reporting. Tan testified that the \ninformation was to update Blackberry as to the length of delay from  Singapore \nto Jakarta as a result of the new import regulation  at that time and sent to SCM \nto keep it informed.\n35 In addition, Sutrisna  alleged that Utomo had verbally informed SCM \nthat the May Price Protection would be calculated based on the RCP. However, \nthere was no evidence indicating  that Utomo had indeed done  so, and Sutrisna \nagreed likewise.18\n36 Lastly, SCM submits that the subsequent behaviour of BrightPoint was \ninconsistent with its position that the calculation  of the price protection was \nbased solely on actual invoiced sales. SCM referred  to an email  sent by Birch \non Sutrisna on 14 June 2013 asking SCM  to send a spreadsheet for the weeks \n16 to 19 to facilitate  BrightPoint\u2019s review  of SCM\u2019s claim,19 and an internal \nBrightPoint email  dated 13 June 2013 sent by Williams to Birch suggesting that \nBrightPoint could offer  an additional US$56,000 in response to SCM\u2019s claim.20 \nSCM alleges  that the fact that BrightPoint asked  SCM  for information regarding \nits claim and was considering  an increase  in the amount of price protection, \ninstead of denying  SCM\u2019s claim  straightaway, shows  that BrightPoint  did not \nactually take the position that the calculation  was based only on actual  sales.  I \nfind this argument vacuous. The subsequent negotiations and the internal \nsuggestion are not behaviour necessarily  inconsistent with BrightPoint\u2019s  \nposition that only actual  invoiced sales were eligible  for price  protection. These \nbehaviours are consistent  with the ongoing business relationship  between the \n17 1AB at p 388.\n18 NE Day  3 at p 57. \n19 2AB at p 986. \n20 2AB at p 963.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPT Surya Citra  Multimedia v Brightpoint Singapore  Pte Ltd [2018]  SGHC  245\n17parties at that point in time and can be construed as friendly gestures  on the part \nof BrightPoint to understand a  sub-distributor\u2019s claim (ie, SCM\u2019s  claim).  \nAccruals or  funding from Blackberry\n37 In the alternative,  SCM alleges that BrightPoint has received funding  \nfrom Blackberry or by way of an accrual fund for the price protection in the sum \nof US$300,000 or alternatively US$250,000. I find that whether this is true does \nnot affect the substance of the May Price  Protection as approved by Blackberry \nand announced by BrightPoint, and SCM\u2019s entitlement to the price protection. \nAgreement of US$300,000  made  on or  about 11 September  2013\n38 In the further  alternative, SCM  takes the position that there was an \nagreement made on or about 11 September 2013 between the parties  for \nBrightPoint to pay US$300,000 to SCM.  The source of the alleged agreement \nstarted with an email sent by Birch to SCM on 10 September 2013, following a \nmeeting between  them, to inform that BrightPoint had emailed Blackberry to \nrequest for approval of the outstanding credit  notes owed to SCM  and that \nBrightPoint would be discussing SCM\u2019s claims with Blackberry.21 On the same \nday, Birch  sent an email to Blackberry, seeking its review and support for the \nclaims made by SCM, including  a claim of US$300,000 for the May Price  \nProtection.22 The next day, Birch emailed  SCM that following his meeting with \nBlackberry, US$300,000  for the price  protection  of Blackberry Bold  models,  ie, \nBlackberry 9900  and Blackberry 9790, would be paid. In reply, Sugianto \nthanked Birch  for his support  and asked  to \u201censure the credit notes promised \n[would] be timely credit  [sic] back  to [SCM]\u201d.23 \n21 3AB at p 1510.  \n22 3AB at p 1513\u20131514.\n23 3AB at p 1516.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPT Surya Citra  Multimedia v Brightpoint Singapore  Pte Ltd [2018]  SGHC  245\n1839 SCM submits that there was no mention that the sum of US$300,000 \nwas a goodwill payment or an offer to settle  SCM\u2019s claim in full. SCM\u2019s  \nposition is that the agreement to pay US$300,000 for Blackberry  9900 and \nBlackberry 9790 was an agreement to pay that amount simpliciter, and not an \noffer of  settlement.  \n40 BrightPoint,  on the other  hand, claims  that the offer of US$300,000 was \nan offer made to settle SCM\u2019s claim in relation to the May Price Protection. The \ncontention is therefore  whether the offer from  BrightPoint was an offer to pay \nwithout more, or an offer  to settle  SCM\u2019s  claim  in relation to the May Price \nProtection. I find that based on the background context in which the offer was \nmade, the offer was an offer made to settle  SCM\u2019s  claim in full. The parties had \nbeen engaged in discussions regarding SCM\u2019s claim and offering  US$300,000 \nwas one move in the ongoing dispute as to the method of calculation of the price  \nprotection. In view  of the background, the sum of US$300,000 was made as a \ngoodwill sum in the hope  of resolving the dispute. It made no commercial sense \nfor BrightPoint to offer to pay US$300,000 without more and continue engaging \nSCM on the remainder of its US$813,912.60 claim. The tenor of the discussions \nbetween the parties was to settle  SCM\u2019s claim fully. However,  SCM in \naccepting the offer to settle, had in mind a different nature of the offer, ie, an \noffer to pay US$300,000 without more.  There was thus no meeting of minds  \nand no valid acceptance of the offer. \n41 This finding is buttressed by Sokhal\u2019s email on the 25 November 2013 \nmeeting (attended by Sugianto, Sutrisna, Utomo and Sokhal).  He stated  that \nSCM had claimed that Blackberry had agreed to pay a goodwill amount during  \na meeting between Blackberry and SCM  (SCM  claiming the amount  to be \nUS$300,000 while  Utomo claiming the amount to be US$250,000), but SCM \nhad \u201crefused  to even take the Goodwill [sum] and wanted  to claim the full \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPT Surya Citra  Multimedia v Brightpoint Singapore  Pte Ltd [2018]  SGHC  245\n19amount\u201d.24 Further, in an email sent internally within BrightPoint  on 2 \nDecember 2013, Sokhal reported that Blackberry had offered  US$250,000 as a \ngoodwill sum and asked SCM  to \u201cforget the $813 claim as it was not correctly \nreported\u201d. He also reported that SCM agreed that it was offered the amount but \nclaimed that it \u201cnever agreed\u201d to the offer and wanted to get its \u201cfull money\u201d.25 \nThese contemporaneous emails show that the parties\u2019  understanding  of the offer \nof US$300,000 was an offer to settle SCM\u2019s  May Price Protection  claim in full. \n42 It is further supported by Sutrisna\u2019s agreement with Mr Yim,  that the \nsum offered  (ie, US$300,000) was to settle SCM\u2019s claim of US$813,912.60. \nSutrisna also testified  that there was no chaser  sent to BrightPoint for  \nUS$300,000 because SCM  wanted the full amount  of US$813,912.60. \nSimilarly, Sugianto testified  that there was no agreement as to SCM\u2019s claim \neven as of 13 January 2014 because the parties  were still engaged in discussions. \nUtomo, also a witness for SCM, similarly recalled that Blackberry  offered  \nUS$250,000 as \u201cgoodwill payment\u201d but that this would have to be approved by \nBlackberry\u2019s headquarters.26\n43 In the light of my finding, there  is no need to determine the issue of \nBirch\u2019s authority in making the offer to SCM. In any case, I find that Birch did \nhave at least apparent authority to convey  the offer  to SCM. Apparent authority \narises where the principal,  by words or conduct, makes a representation  to the \nother party  that the agent has the requisite  authority to act on his behalf \n(Skandinaviska  Enskilda Banken AB (Publ), Singapore  Branch v Asia Pacific \nBreweries (Singapore)  Pte Ltd and another and another suit [2009] 4 SLR(R) \n24 4AB at pp 2240 and 2241. \n25 4AB at p 2239. \n26 NE Day  4 at p 18. \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPT Surya Citra  Multimedia v Brightpoint Singapore  Pte Ltd [2018]  SGHC  245\n20788 at [80]). It is notable that the email  sent by Birch to SCM containing  the \noffer was  copied  to Wong,  who had the actual authority to make such an offer.27 \nThe previous email sent by Birch to SCM  on 10 September 2013 informing \nSCM that he would be discussing SCM\u2019s claim with Blackberry was also copied \nto Wong. Moreover,  it can be seen from the email  that Birch was the one who \nhad met SCM  to discuss its claim  and was going to meet Blackberry  to discuss \nthe same. There was no communication  from  Wong to SCM stating  that the \noffer was invalid because Birch lacked the authority  to make  it. Taken together, \nthese conduct are sufficient to constitute a representation to SCM that Birch  had \nthe requisite authority to make the offer. In any event, Wong  testified  that he \nhad ratified the offer subsequently.\n44 I decline to draw any adverse  inference under s 116 of the Evidence Act \n(Cap 97, 1997  Rev Ed) on the basis that BrightPoint did not call Birch as a \nwitness to testify on the nature of the offer  made and his authority, as urged by \nSCM.

Mr Fan and Mr Aathar were substantial shareholders of IHC. Mr Fan was also the Chief Executive Officer of IHC from 17 May 2015 to 31 January 2016.', '9\\u2003The Crest Funds are three funds managed by fund management firm Crest Capital Asia Fund Management Pte Ltd, which is in turn a wholly-owned subsidiary of Crest Capital Asia Pte Ltd (\u201cCrest Capital\u201d). Tan Yang Hwee (\u201cMr Tan\u201d), was the investment director of Crest Capital and the representative of the Crest Funds.', '10\\u2003On 3 April 2015, Mr Tan and Mr Aathar spoke via telephone and discussed the provision of a credit facility to IHC. The substance of that discussion was recorded in an email from Mr Aathar to Mr Tan (copied to Mr Fan) dated 4 April 2015, in which Mr Aathar expressed concerns about imminent short-selling of IHC shares, and requested a standby credit facility of $20m \u201cfor use against this activity\u201d. Mr Aathar also proposed that the facility be extended for a short term of one to two months, at an interest rate of 3.5% per month, and suggested that IHC shares \u201cbe bought and held by [the Crest Funds] directly\u201d.', '11\\u2003Importantly, Mr Aathar suggested that instead of disbursing the funds to IHC to be paid to a broker to purchase the shares, the Crest Funds could purchase the shares on IHC\u2019s behalf through its own broker. The Crest Funds were agreeable to this suggestion as it avoided a circuitous arrangement and afforded them additional security in respect of any drawdown under the facility.', '12\\u2003In an email dated 9 April 2015, Mr Tan sent Mr Aathar and Mr Fan a draft term sheet, in which the proposed security for the facility was, inter alia, a pledge of the IHC shares purchased using the facility. The purpose of the facility was stated as being \u201c[t]o fund the general working capital\u201d.', '13\\u2003On 16 April 2015, the parties entered into a facility agreement providing for the credit facility of up to $20m extended by the Crest Entities to IHC. The agreement of 16 April 2015 was later superseded by way of an agreement dated 30 July 2015. This is the facility agreement mentioned at [2] above, which will be referred to as the \u201cStandby Facility\u201d, and which was secured by the following security agreements:', '(a)\\u2003Three deeds of charge all dated 30 July 2015 by IHC in favour of the Crest Funds in relation to the share capital of three wholly owned subsidiaries, being IHC Medical Re Pte Ltd, IHC Management Pte Ltd and IHC Management (Australia) Pty Ltd (\u201cDeeds of Charges\u201d); and', '(b)\\u2003Two deeds of undertaking both dated 30 July 2015 by IHC Management Pte Ltd and IHC Management (Australia) Pty Ltd respectively, in favour of the Crest Funds (\u201cDeeds of Undertaking\u201d).', '14\\u2003 From April to August 2015, acting on IHC\u2019s instructions given by Mr Aathar, EFIII executed drawdowns on the Standby Facility to purchase IHC shares on the open market, and I have referred to these as the \u201copen market acquisitions\u201d. These shares were then held in the name of EFIII on behalf of IHC, in what I have referred to as the \u201ctrust arrangement\u201d. Overall, a total sum of $17,332,081.15 was drawn down under the Standby Facility for the purchase of 59,304,800 IHC shares on 14 occasions from 16 April 2015 to 24 August 2015 at share prices ranging from $0.285 to $0.31 per share.', '15\\u2003On 9 September 2015, the SGX issued an announcement advising shareholders and potential investors to exercise caution when dealing in IHC shares as its review of the trades in IHC showed that more than 60% of the total traded volume of IHC shares in the period since April 2015 to the date of the advisory appeared to be conducted by \u201ca handful of individuals who seem to be connected to each other\u201d. After the SGX advisory was issued, the share price of IHC fell from $0.31 to a low of $0.10 by the end of September 2015.', '16\\u2003Subsequently, IHC defaulted on the Standby Facility. On 19 October 2015, EFIII issued a letter of demand to IHC for payment of the interest charges on the facility (\u201cStandby Fees\u201d) which were in arrears. The Standby Fees had been paid for the months of April and May 2015, but not for June 2015 onwards. On 15 April 2016, the Crest Funds appointed receivers over the charged shares in the three IHC subsidiaries pursuant to the Deeds of Charges.', '17\\u2003On 23 January 2017, an extraordinary general meeting of IHC was held. At this meeting, the incumbent board of directors was removed in its entirety and replaced by a new board.

They were in the business of providing, amongst other things, marine support services to major oil and construction companies in West Africa since the late 1970s. 1', 'All three companies were subsidiaries of the fourth plaintiff, Sea Trucks Group Limited (in liquidation), which was placed in liquidation in June 2017 after it defaulted on certain bonds that it had issued to its creditors. The fourth plaintiff currently acts under the direction of its liquidators. 2', '5\\u2003The fourth plaintiff had been founded by the first defendant, Jacobus Johannes Roomans, who was a director of the first to third plaintiffs until early 2017 and of the fourth plaintiff from October 2015 to December 2016. He was removed from the board of directors of the fourth plaintiff following its default on the bonds that it had issued. The second defendant, Mariah Binte Mahat, is the first defendant\u2019s partner. She too had been a director in the fourth plaintiff and was also ousted from the board in December 2016 as a result of the bond default. It should be noted, however, that the second defendant had confirmed that in spite of her appointment, she had not provided any services for any of the plaintiffs. 3', '6\\u2003The third and fourth defendants, Al Shouf Trading FZC and Kwong Soon Engineering Company Pte Ltd, were companies that were closely related to the first and second defendants and had various dealings with the fourth plaintiff. 4', 'These companies, however, played no part in the present application, which squarely focused on the disclosure obligations of the first and second defendants.', '7\\u2003After the fourth plaintiff was placed in liquidation in June 2017, its liquidators started investigations into the prior acts of the first and second defendants. According to the plaintiffs, it was discovered that the first and second defendants had been engaged in various improper transactions. Pursuant to the liquidators\u2019 directions, on 2 February 2018, the first to third plaintiffs commenced Suit No 113 of 2018 against all four defendants, making the following claims. 5', '(a)\\u2003First, that the first defendant had mismanaged the plaintiffs in breach of his directors\u2019 duties and fiduciary duties, in the sense that he had dealt with the assets of the plaintiffs interchangeably with the assets of another company that he owned. In particular, this was of concern to the creditors who held bonds issued by the fourth plaintiff, as they only held security over the assets of the fourth plaintiff and not the company that the first defendant owned. 6', '(b)\\u2003Secondly, that the defendants had caused the second plaintiff to make inflated payments to the fourth defendant, allegedly to take into account certain sums to be paid by the fourth defendant to the third defendant under a consultancy agreement, The plaintiffs alleged that the consultancy agreement was a sham and that the defendants needed to return the sums paid. 7', '(c)\\u2003Thirdly, that the first and second defendants had caused monthly payments to be made to the second defendant and the son of the first and second defendants, despite the fact that neither had contributed to any of the plaintiffs. Although the second defendant had been a director of the fourth plaintiff, she admitted that she did not make any contributions to any of the plaintiffs (see [5] above); and as for their son, he was three years old when he first began receiving monthly payments and obviously could not have contributed to the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs alleged that these sums were paid in order to circumvent the limit on the remuneration that the first defendant could receive from the plaintiffs. 8', '8\\u2003It is evident from the foregoing that a large portion of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims focused on sums of money paid by one or more of the plaintiffs to one or more of the defendants, and that the central plank of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims was that the first and second defendants had been the central movers of the scheme alleged to have been hatched and carried out. In the light of these claims, the issue of the location and details of the first and second defendants\u2019 assets becomes critical, because if the plaintiffs had no means of ensuring that the said assets were not moved, then they ran the risk of obtaining nothing more than a paper judgment.', '9\\u2003Although the suit was initially commenced by the first to third plaintiffs, the fourth plaintiff was later added as a party to the suit. 9', '10\\u2003On the same day, the plaintiffs filed Summons No 633 of 2018, seeking to obtain an ex parte worldwide Mareva injunction against the first and second defendants. On 28 February 2018, I heard the plaintiffs ex parte and was satisfied that the requirements for such an injunction were met. I therefore granted the Mareva injunction, under which the first and second defendants were restrained from disposing or dealing with their assets up to the value of US$25,350,328.85 and US$7,385,310 respectively. These sums corresponded to the value of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims against them as indicated in the statement of claim. In addition, para 6 of the Mareva injunction required the first and second defendants to disclose all of their assets by way of affidavit. It is helpful to set out para 6 of the Mareva injunction in full: 10', '11\\u2003Although para 6 of the Mareva injunction did not specifically identify assets of the first and second defendants to be disclosed, para 3 of the Mareva injunction states that the restraint on the assets of the first and second defendants \u201cincludes, without limitation, the following assets\u201d:', '(a)\\u2003a list of five bank accounts owned by the first defendant and another five bank accounts owned by the second defendant;', '(b)\\u2003a list of 12 companies in which the first defendant had shareholding interest in; and', '(c)\\u2003a list of three real properties owned by the first defendant and another one such property owned by the second defendant.', 'Thus, it would be expected that the first and second defendants should, at minimum, disclose information relating to these assets.', '12\\u2003It should also be noted that para 6 of the Mareva injunction corresponds exactly to para 2 of Form 7 of Appendix A of the Supreme Court Practice Directions, 11', 'which is the standard form in which a Mareva injunction would be issued. In other words, the disclosure obligations that were imposed on the first and second defendants by the Mareva injunction were ordinary and not exceptional. I will return to this point later as it is a significant one in evaluating whether the variation of this disclosure obligation should be granted.', '13\\u2003The claim documents and the Mareva injunction were served on the first and second defendants on 3 March 2018. 12', '14\\u2003On 12 March 2018, the first and second defendants\u2019 lawyers wrote to the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers, stating, amongst other things, that the terms of the disclosure order within the Mareva injunction were \u201ctoo wide and ought to be limited to information on all assets whether in or outside Singapore amounting to [the sums claimed in the statement of claim]\u201d. They therefore asked if the plaintiffs were agreeable to a variation of the disclosure obligation to this effect. 13', 'This proposal was rejected by the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers on 14 March 2018 on the basis that limiting the assets to be disclosed in this manner would render the Mareva injunction \u201cpyrrhic and ineffective\u201d. 14', '15\\u2003Faced with the plaintiffs\u2019 refusal, the first and second defendants had no choice but to file an affidavit in order to comply with their disclosure obligations. Their first joint affidavit dated 19 March 2018 was thus filed on 20 March 2018, 15', 'although it should be noted that the said affidavit was initially sworn on 17 March 2018 and sent to the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers on 19 March 2018. 16', 'That initial version of the affidavit was discovered to have contained certain errors, which required the revised affidavit filed on 20 March 2018 to rectify. 17', '16\\u2003The first joint affidavit disclosed information pertaining to the first and second defendants\u2019 assets in 13 bank accounts, which included all ten of the bank accounts listed in para 3 of the Mareva injunction (see [11] above). The affidavit also disclosed information pertaining to three real properties owned by the first and second defendants, which, however, only included one of the four properties listed in para 3 of the Mareva injunction as being subject to the restraint. It was evident from the face of the affidavit that there had been no information disclosed by the first and second defendants in relation to the 12 companies that the first defendant had shares in and the three real properties owned by the first defendant in the Netherlands and Nigeria.', '17\\u2003No attempt was made by the first and second defendants to explain why they did not provide information in relation to the 12 companies and three real properties even though these assets were specifically listed in para 3 of the Mareva injunction as being subject to the restraint. Instead, the first and second defendants simply stated in the affidavit that further information would need to be obtained, coupled with an assurance that an update would be provided to the court and to the plaintiffs \u201cas soon as possible\u201d:', '18\\u2003On 19 March 2018, the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers responded to the initial version of the first joint affidavit that had been sent to them. They inquired about the shares and real property that had been identified in para 3 of the Mareva injunction but did not feature in the affidavit, and asked for the reasons for the non-disclosure of the information pertaining to these assets. 18', '19\\u2003The first and second defendants\u2019 lawyers replied on 22 March 2018, stating their belief that there was no further utility to disclosing further information about their assets, given that they had already disclosed assets of more than US$35m in value, which exceeded the sums restrained by the Mareva injunction. It is helpful to set out the relevant parts of that letter in full: 19', '20\\u2003While the issue of the undisclosed information pertaining to the shares and real property owned by the first defendant was not directly addressed, it was clear that the first and second defendants considered that they did not need to disclose this information despite the assets being specifically named in para 3 of the Mareva injunction. Further, similar to the assurance made in the first joint affidavit, another assurance was given in this letter to the effect that the first defendant would be prepared to file a further affidavit stating that the assets were sufficient to meet any judgment that could be obtained by the plaintiffs.', '21\\u2003Unsurprisingly, the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers replied on 23 March 2018 in a strongly-worded letter, stating that it was not for the defendants to \u201cunilaterally decide how much disclosure of their assets to provide\u201d given the express scope of the disclosure obligation within the Mareva injunction. They noted that the first and second defendants\u2019 failure to disclose was \u201cnot by reason of inadvertence or the constraint of time or circumstance, but by choice\u201d, and thus the plaintiffs were left \u201cwith little choice but to take the necessary steps to enforce the Freezing Injunction\u201d. 20', '22\\u2003There was no further reply to this letter. Instead, it appears that having been faced with the prospect of an application for committal by the plaintiffs, the first and second defendants then filed SUM 1488 on 28 March 2018 seeking to vary their disclosure obligations. In their second joint affidavit dated 3 April 2018 filed in support of SUM 1488, the first and second defendants also made clear what had previously been implicit: that while they were under an obligation to disclose all their assets, 21', 'they chose not to do so because \u201cno further purpose would be served by [them] disclosing any assets beyond the values stated in the Freezing Injunction\u201d. 22', 'Further, in respect of the properties listed in para 3 of the Mareva injunction, the first and second defendants took the position that the injunction did not compel them to \u201cdisclose specifically [their] properties in Nigeria and the Netherlands\u201d. 23', '23\\u2003I should point out that the position taken by the first and second defendants here appears to be at odds with the assurances that they had given in the first joint affidavit and in the letter dated 22 March 2018, in the sense that if the first and second defendants took the position that they did not need to disclose further information given that the purpose of the Mareva injunction had been met, then there would be no need for them to assure the court and the plaintiffs of future updates of information pertaining to their other assets. Instead, the absolute position taken by the first and second defendants in this affidavit is consonant with the views expressed in their letters dated 12 and 22 March 2018, in which the first and second defendants had repeatedly asked for a consensual variation of the disclosure obligations such that they would not need to disclose any further information about their assets. I shall return to this point later.', '24\\u2003SUM 1488 was fixed for hearing on 14 May 2018. In the interim period, the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers wrote to the defendants\u2019 lawyers on 27 April 2018, indicating that the plaintiffs intended to file an application to cross-examine the first and second defendants in respect of the first joint affidavit because the information disclosed therein was not adequate or meaningful. The plaintiffs also noted that despite the assurance of further updates given in the first joint affidavit, no such update had been given despite more than a month having passed since the first joint affidavit was filed. 24', '25\\u2003Seemingly in response to this letter, the first and second defendants filed a fourth joint affidavit on that very day and sent it to the plaintiffs on 30 April 2018. 25', 'In the affidavit, the first and second defendants explained that they had attempted to ask for more information from their banks about their other bank accounts by email but were told that they needed to call the bank instead. And although their personal secretary had since attempted to do so, the bank\u2019s customer service officer was still unwilling to provide this information. 26', 'While email correspondence between the first and second defendants and the bank officer was exhibited in the affidavit, no evidence was produced to show that they had followed up with a phone call. Nor was there an affidavit deposed by the secretary who had allegedly contacted the banks to state that she had taken such steps to obtain further information.', '26\\u2003The plaintiffs were clearly dissatisfied with this explanation. On 30 April 2018, they filed Summons No 2031 of 2018 (\u201cSUM 2031\u201d) seeking to cross-examine the first and second defendants on the first joint affidavit. This summons was fixed to be heard before me together with SUM 1488.', '27\\u2003On 14 May 2018, I heard both summonses. I granted the plaintiffs\u2019 application in SUM 2031 to cross-examine the first and second defendants. In respect of SUM 1488, I ordered the plaintiffs to furnish undertakings to the effect that they would not use any information disclosed for the purpose of civil or criminal proceedings in foreign jurisdictions; the plaintiffs did so by way of an affidavit deposed by one of the fourth plaintiff\u2019s liquidators dated 18 May 2018, although it was stated that the undertakings were given with effect from 14 May 2018. 27', 'However, I did not grant the first and second defendants\u2019 application for a variation of their disclosure obligations. I also did not grant the first and second defendants\u2019 oral application to have full disclosure made by a new deadline to be determined by the court, because to do so would be to impliedly bless the previous breaches of the disclosure order. Instead, I left it to the plaintiffs to take the necessary action to enforce the order of court that would be extracted as a result of my decision. 28', '28\\u2003Pursuant to my decision, the first and second defendants\u2019 lawyers wrote to the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers on 17 May 2018 stating that the first and second defendants would \u201cat once\u201d observe their disclosure obligations. This promise to comply was, however, subject to two qualifications:', '(a)\\u2003disclosure would only be made \u201con terms of strict confidence and on the terms of the undertakings ordered by the Learned Judge on [the first and second defendants\u2019] application\u201d; and', '(b)\\u2003the first and second defendants would undertake a global search on their other assets and would disclose the results of the search by correspondence, but these disclosures would only be \u201caggregated together at convenient stages on affidavit\u201d. The letter then disclosed a \u201ccustomer overview from HSBC\u201d which was said to have been received by the first and second defendants on 16 May 2018. 29', '29\\u2003On the same day, the first and second defendants\u2019 lawyers also wrote in to the court to ask for further arguments in respect of the variation of their disclosure obligations. They explained that the first and second defendants had \u201cstruggled with an absolute, unconditional order on the one hand and their own view that the court would recognize that once sufficient assets had been identified and an assurance given to the court that they would not be dealt with or disposed, the purpose of the Freezing Injunction would be met and they would be released from further disclosure\u201d. 30', 'The letter further confirmed that there were no encumbrances on the disclosed bank accounts, and whilst there were mortgages on the property disclosed, the value of the assets still exceeded the sums that were restrained by the Mareva injunction, even taking into account the sum of the mortgages. 31', 'The request for further arguments was granted and fixed to be heard on 8 June 2018.', '30\\u2003On 19 May 2018, the first and second defendants\u2019 lawyers made a second disclosure of information by letter, stating that the first and second defendants held shares in one Jamaro Development Company and one Jamaro Capital Limited. The statements of share capital annexed to the letter as proof were correct only as at 24 November 2014, which is the date on which the first defendant had signed off on these documents. 32', '31\\u2003On the same day, the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers replied, rejecting the first and second defendants\u2019 approach of disclosing their assets in stages. In particular, the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers noted that the first defendant had recently gone through or was at that time going through divorce proceedings, and would thus have had a \u201ccurrent overview\u201d of his assets. 33', 'It should be noted that this allegation was never contested by the first and second defendants, and indeed, the financial statement that had been sworn by the first defendant in September 2016 in relation to the divorce proceedings was subsequently obtained and exhibited by the plaintiffs in an affidavit dated 25 June 2018. 34', 'The plaintiffs then followed up this letter by filing Summons No 2323 of 2018 on 21 May 2018, in which they sought leave to commence committal proceedings against the first and second defendants. The parties continued corresponding on 22 and 24 May 2018, each restating the same positions that they had taken prior. 35', '32\\u2003On 23 May 2018, the first and second defendants filed Summons No 2402 of 2018, seeking leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal against my decision in relation to the variation application. It was not entirely clear why they had filed this summons since their previous application for further arguments had already been granted and was slated to be heard on 8 June 2018. Indeed, the first and second defendants eventually withdrew this application after I queried them on this at the hearing. A separate summons for leave to appeal was later filed after the hearing of 8 June 2018, at which I confirmed my earlier decision made on 14 May 2018.', '33\\u2003Before I heard the parties on 8 June 2018, however, the first and second defendants filed their sixth joint affidavit on 4 June 2018. 36', 'They placed on affidavit the information pertaining to their assets that had been disclosed in the two letters dated 17 and 19 May 2018, together with further information about a bank account with DBS Bank Ltd that had not previously been disclosed. The assets disclosed in the sixth joint affidavit can be summarised as follows.', '(a)\\u2003A bank account with HSBC Bank (Singapore) Limited, which had been identified in the letter dated 17 May 2018 (see [28] above). In addition to the customer overview dated 16 May 2018, an additional account statement dated 7 May 2018 was included as an exhibit.', '(b)\\u2003The first and second defendants\u2019 shares in Jamaro Development Company and Jamaro Capital Limited, which had been identified in the letter dated 19 May 2018 (see [30] above).', '(c)\\u2003A bank account with DBS Bank Ltd, as evidenced by a statement summarising the first and second defendants\u2019 unit trusts. Significantly, the statement was dated 31 March 2018, 37', 'which meant that the first and second defendants had in their possession this information during the period in which the parties had exchanged correspondence in relation to the issue of disclosure. But the information relating to this bank account was never disclosed until this sixth joint affidavit.', '34\\u2003At the hearing on 8 June 2018, the first and second defendants relied not only on their first and sixth joint affidavits, but also tendered a draft affidavit that had not yet been sworn and filed, which set out the following information: 38', '(a)\\u2003the first and second defendants\u2019 shareholdings in nine companies, eight of which had been listed in para 3 of the Mareva injunction. However, no estimate of the value of the shares was given;', '(b)\\u2003the first and second defendants\u2019 confirmation that they were not the owners of one of the four properties listed in para 3 of the Mareva injunction, although this still left two properties in the Netherlands for which information had not been disclosed; and', '(c)\\u2003details of a three bank accounts that the first and second defendants held with Citibank, Switzerland.', '35\\u2003The verifying documents pertaining to these assets, however, were variously dated between 2009 and 2015 and were thus, although this draft affidavit provided more information about the first and second defendants\u2019 assets, the information provided did not reflect their assets as at the date which the variation was sought, ie, May and June 2018.', '36\\u2003The first and second defendants relied on all three affidavits during the further arguments on 8 June 2018 and subsequently filed the draft affidavit on 13 June 2018. 39', '37\\u2003I also note that during this period, from March to June 2018, the first and second defendants had indicated their intention to use some of the assets that had been disclosed by them for their ordinary expenses and legal fees. In particular, the first and second defendants informed the plaintiffs that they intended to pay their lawyers various sums which totalled about $440,000 as professional fees for the present proceedings, despite the matter still being at the interlocutory stage. 40', 'They also indicated that they would draw money from their bank accounts \u2013 the first defendant $20,000 per week and the second defendant $10,000 per week for the months of April and May 2018. 41', '38\\u2003After my decision on 8 June 2018, the first and second defendants continued to take out further applications in respect of the present case. Most pertinently, the first and second defendants filed Summons No 2873 of 2018 on 21 June 2018, seeking to have the entire Mareva injunction set aside on the basis that, inter alia, the courts of Nigeria were the most appropriate courts to hear the plaintiffs\u2019 claims and to be asked to issue a worldwide Mareva injunction. In the same vein, on 29 June 2018, the first and second defendants filed Summons No 2975 of 2018, in which they sought to stay the underlying proceedings in favour of the courts of Nigeria on the ground of forum non conveniens.', '39\\u2003I note that these summonses were filed after I had made my decision at the hearing of 8 June 2018, and to that extent, they are not strictly relevant in my consideration of the present application. I mention them, however, to give a complete picture of the procedural skirmishes that have taken place between the parties up until the date of these present grounds of decision.

The effect of this designation was that any assets belonging to these persons and subject to the US jurisdiction were frozen, and US persons were generally prohibited from dealing with them (\u201cthe OFAC Sanctions\u201d).

In its supporting affidavit for OS 975, the Defendant detailed how the OFAC Sanctions (described at [6] above) came about on 6 April 2018.

In the supporting affidavit for SUM 3677, the Defendant again took the position that the GMRA had been frustrated, and so there was a serious question to be tried as to whether the Plaintiff was entitled to the debt amount of US$170,388,766.03. 15', '18\\u2003SUM 3677 was heard by Andrew Ang SJ on 13 August 2018.

Rather, a different lower standard was applicable \u2013 the question was whether a prima facie dispute existed. In support of this proposition, the Defendant cited the English Court of Appeal decision of Salford Estates (No 2) Ltd v Altomart Ltd (No 2) [2015] Ch 589 (\u201cSalford\u201d) and the Singapore High Court decision of BDG v BDH [2016] 5 SLR 977 (\u201cBDG\u201d), which I will discuss in greater detail below. After hearing the arguments, Ang SJ dismissed the Defendant\u2019s application on the basis that he was not satisfied that there was a bona fide dispute.

There were no board resolutions approving the payments.', '9\\u2003It was not disputed that as at 31 March 2016, UAE was indebted to Kesterion in the sum of HK$92,855,948 (\u201cthe Debt\u201d), which was recorded as HK$92,831,000 in UAE\u2019s 2016 Annual Report. It was also not disputed that the plaintiff itself was not indebted to Kesterion.', '10\\u2003Ms Yip and UAE were added to the present suit as third parties by the defendants, but the third party claim was withdrawn on the first day of trial with costs to be paid by the defendants to Ms Yip and UAE.

{"casename":"2018_SGHC_253","fact":"'5\\u2003Dr Wong and Dr Zhu were registered medical practitioners practising at an aesthetics clinic known as Reves Clinic. On 30 December 2009, Dr Wong was scheduled to perform a liposuction procedure on one of his patients. Shortly before the commencement of the procedure, Dr Wong called Dr Zhu into the procedure room to assist in the procedure and to monitor the patient. A third person, Ms Fiona Hong, was also present, but she was not a registered medical practitioner.', '6\\u2003No anaesthetist was in attendance. Instead, Dr Wong took it upon himself to manage the sedation of the patient, and for this purpose, he chose to use Propofol, which is an anaesthetic drug and a potent sedative that can rapidly depress the airway, impede respiration, and cause the recipient\u2019s blood pressure to fall. Because of its potency, the instruction sheet provided by its manufacturers clearly states that it should only be administered by physicians trained in anaesthesia or in the management of patients under intensive care. The rationale for this appears to be explained in the American Society of Anesthesiologists\u2019 2002 \u201cPractice Guidelines for Sedation and Analgesia by Non-Anesthesiologists\u201d (\u201cthe ASA Guidelines\u201d) which are referred to in the agreed statements of facts that were prepared for the proceedings before the DT. The ASA Guidelines advise that practitioners administering Propofol should be qualified to rescue patients from any level of sedation including general anaesthesia, and medical practitioners who are not anaesthetists or intensivists would generally lack the training to perform such a task.', '7\\u2003It is useful here to briefly explain some of the relevant medical terms for context. Sedation refers to a continuum of drug-induced states ranging from minimal to moderate to deep sedation and, at the end of the spectrum, general anaesthesia. General anaesthesia is a state of unconsciousness from which a patient cannot be aroused, even by painful stimulation. Patients in general anaesthesia may have impaired cardiovascular function and may often require assistance in maintaining their airways. Local anaesthesia, on the other hand, refers to the administration of an anaesthetic drug to a specific area of the patient\u2019s body for pain relief and does not involve sedation.', '8\\u2003Dr Wong and Dr Zhu were neither anaesthetists nor intensivists, and, as they later admitted, did not have the necessary training or experience to administer Propofol safely or in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s instruction sheet. Indeed, from the clear warnings stated on the face of that instruction sheet, as well as from their prior involvement in surgeries in which Propofol had been administered by qualified anaesthetists, Dr Wong and Dr Zhu must be taken in fact to have known \u2013 and certainly ought to have known \u2013 about the potential dangers of administering Propofol. They would also have known that they lacked the qualifications and expertise to do so, given that they were not trained and qualified either as anaesthetists or as intensivists. In spite of this, they proceeded to administer Propofol to the patient at the start of the liposuction procedure.', '9\\u2003To compound matters, they chose to administer Propofol in this case using a complex technique of continuous intravenous infusion by titration. This presented an even greater need for relevant expertise because when Propofol is administered in this way, its effects are prolonged according to the duration of the infusion. Both doctors accepted in the respective agreed statements of facts that the use of this titration technique to sedate a patient with Propofol is complex and \u201ccan only be provided by a well-trained, experienced and vigilant sedationist\u201d, which neither of them was.', '10\\u2003As a result of their incompetence in the use of Propofol, the sedation was carried out in a manner that can only be described as appalling. In brief, as and when the patient was observed to exhibit any signs of responding to pain stimulation or any movement or discomfort, Dr Wong would instruct Dr Zhu to increase the dosage of Propofol. In the event, the dosage of Propofol that was administered was excessive, and it caused the patient to enter a state of deep sedation to the point of general anaesthesia. Given their lack of training, neither doctor was able to recognise the signs of this happening.', '11\\u2003The patient\u2019s deep state of sedation owing to the overdose of Propofol had other repercussions on the liposuction procedure, which, as it transpired, was not performed competently. During the course of the liposuction procedure, Dr Wong inadvertently caused multiple puncture wounds to the patient\u2019s intestines. However, these went unnoticed because the patient was in a state of general anaesthesia and did not manifest any signs of pain.', '12\\u2003The procedure lasted about three hours and ended at around 3.45pm. At about 3.50pm, Dr Zhu left the procedure room with Dr Wong\u2019s consent. Dr Wong proceeded to close the patient\u2019s surgical wounds and then left the room to use the toilet. While Dr Wong was in the toilet, the patient was not in the care of any medical practitioner or nurse for at least five minutes. Perhaps as a result of their incompetence in the use of Propofol, the doctors failed to realise that it was essential that the patient be closely monitored in light of the Propofol-related risks. According to the 2002 \u201cGuidelines on Safe Sedation Practice for Investigation and Intervention Procedures\u201d published by the Academy of Medicine, Singapore, which were in force at the time of the offence, a patient under sedation must have his circulation \u201cmonitored at frequent and clinically appropriate intervals\u201d and his \u201c[r]espiration must be monitored continuously\u201d [emphasis added]. Instead, the doctors left the patient unattended in the immediate aftermath of the administration of Propofol while he was still sedated, with scant regard to patient care and safety. During this period, the patient developed an airway obstruction and suffered asphyxia leading to cardiac arrest. It was only at about 4.15pm that the patient was discovered to have collapsed, and an ambulance was then called to take him to the hospital.', '13\\u2003When the patient arrived at the accident and emergency (\u201cA&E\u201d) department of the hospital, he was found to be without a pulse. Dr Wong, who had accompanied the patient to the hospital, told the A&E doctors that the patient had been given Pethidine, a pain medication, and local anaesthesia but no sedation. This was plainly a false statement as Dr Wong knew that the patient had been sedated with Propofol, and, as we have noted, this is a potent sedative. In our judgment, the false statement made by Dr Wong to the A&E doctors evidenced his knowledge that it had been improper for him to have administered Propofol. There is no other plausible explanation for his false statement; and certainly none has been advanced.', '14\\u2003Despite resuscitation attempts by the A&E doctors, the patient passed away that day. He was aged 44.', '15\\u2003On 4 January 2012, the coroner recorded the patient\u2019s death as a medical misadventure and that the patient had \u201cdied of the effects of asphyxia due to airway obstruction, secondary to intravenous Propofol administered.\u201d The coroner further noted that the patient had sustained multiple intestinal punctures during the liposuction procedure. These findings were referred to the SMC on 13 February 2012.', '16\\u2003Upon further investigation by the Complaints Committee, Notices of Complaint were sent to Dr Wong and Dr Zhu on 13 November 2013. On 11 May 2015, both doctors were notified of the Complaints Committee\u2019s decision to convene a DT for an inquiry. On 9 February 2017, they were served formal Notices of Inquiry. By then, nearly five years had passed since the matter had been referred to the SMC.', '17\\u2003Dr Wong\u2019s and Dr Zhu\u2019s inquiries took place before the DT on 22 September and 11 August 2017 respectively, and each doctor pleaded guilty to a charge which stated that they had \u201cfailed to exercise due care in the management of [their] patient \u2026 in that [they] did not ensure adequate monitoring of the Patient during a medical procedure where [they] administered, or caused to be administered, Propofol to him, and as a result the Patient subsequently passed away.\u201d Dr Wong and Dr Zhu thus admitted that they were \u201cguilty of professional misconduct under section 53(1)(d) of the Medical Registration Act (Cap 174) in that [their] conduct amounts to such serious negligence that it objectively portrays an abuse of the privileges which accompanies registration as a medical practitioner.\u201d', '18\\u2003In relation to both doctors\u2019 charges, the SMC proceeded under the second limb of professional misconduct laid down in Low Cze Hong v Singapore Medical Council [2008] 3 SLR(R) 612 (\u201cLow Cze Hong\u201d) at [37], namely that the doctors\u2019 misconduct amounted to serious negligence that objectively portrays an abuse of the privileges which accompany registration as a medical practitioner.'"}

If the \nlegal burden  of proof  were not on the plaintiffs, then it would follow  that the \ncourt will grant the order for the collective  sale whenever no objection has been \nfiled. However, s 84A(10) suggests  that that does not necessarily  follow. The \ncourt may still decide  not to grant the order  for the collective sale on the facts  \navailable to it. This points to the legal  burden being on the plaintiffs all the time.\n38 However,  from  the practical point of view, it is the case that in contested \napplications, objections  will be filed.  The objectors adduce the evidence to \nsupport the allegations of bad faith and if that establishes a prima facie case of \nbad faith, then the applicants have  to counter such allegations with evidence \nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLim Hun Joo v  Kok Yin  Chong [2018]  SGHC  256\n10and\/or arguments  of their own.

I will refer  to them as sub-issues.  I add that in view of s 84A(4A), the \ndefendants are entitled to rely only on those grounds  of objections  which  they \nhad stated in the objections they filed to the Board and not new ones unless they \ncould not have known at that time of the facts  giving rise to those new grounds \nof objection (see the decision of the High Court in Ngui Gek Lian Philomene \nand others v Chan Kiat and others (HSR  International Realtors Pte Ltd, \nintervener) [2013]  4 SLR 694 involving the collective sale of Thomson View \nCondominium). In this oral judgment, however, I will not discuss whether the \nfollowing sub-issues were  raised before the Board,  but will deal with them  as if \nthey had been raised before the Board.  I will discuss whether they were raised \nbefore the Board subsequently in the grounds of decision.\nConflict of interest\n40 The first sub-issue  is the question about conflict of interest.  As \nmentioned already, it was not in dispute that Lim and Chan have associates who \neach owns  another unit in the Property. Before  Lim and Chan were elected as \nmembers of the CSC, they did not declare  any conflict  of interest.  Indeed, their \nposition was that there  was no actual or potential  conflict. \n41 The question  here is whether there was an actual or a potential conflict \nof interest by reason only of the  fact that an  associate  owns another unit.\nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLim Hun Joo v  Kok Yin  Chong [2018]  SGHC  256\n1142 The defendants  referred to a speech made by Mr K  Shanmugam,  the \nMinister for Law, in Parliament  which suggested that disclosure of the fact that \nan associate owns another unit must be made. However, the terms of the relevant \nstatutory provision are  paramount.\n43 The relevant provision is para 2(1)( g) of the Third Schedule which  \nstates:\n2.\u2014(1) If a person standing for election  as a member of a \ncollective sale committee is aware of any conflict of interest or \npotential conflict of interest, if any, with his duties or interests \nas a member of the collective sale committee (should he be \nelected) arising from \u2014\n\u2026\n(g)his associate\u2019s possession or ownership  of any lot or \ncommon property that may be the subject  of the \ncollective sale,\nhe shall,  before  his election, declare at the general meeting  \nconvened for such election,  the nature and extent of all such \nconflicts of interest or potential conflicts of interest.\n[emphasis added in bold]\n44 The phrase \u201cif any\u201d is important. In my view, it means that the mere fact \nthat an associate owns another unit does not necessarily mean  that there is an \nactual or a potential  conflict. Otherwise  that qualification \u201cif any\u201d is otiose.\n45 Was there any evidence of an actual  or a potential conflict other  than the \nfact of the ownership  of a unit by an associate?\n46 The defendants submitted that the associates of Lim and Chan own the \nsame type of unit as them, resulting in what would appear to be an \noverrepresentation of that type of unit on the CSC. However,  there was no \nsuggestion that the apportionment of sale proceeds was unfair.  Just as the mere \nfact of an associate\u2019s ownership  of another unit is insufficient to give rise to an \nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLim Hun Joo v  Kok Yin  Chong [2018]  SGHC  256\n12actual or a potential conflict of interest,  the mere fact that that other unit is of \nthe same type is  also insufficient.\n47 If I were wrong  on this point, the conduct  of Lim and Chan should be \nconsidered further. They said they relied on legal  advice that there was no actual  \nor potential conflict of interest on their part. This was not disputed. I am of the \nview that they were entitled to rely on legal advice even if that advice  turned \nout to be wrong. \n48 However,  the defendants argued that Lim and Chan were trying to hide \nthe fact of ownership by their associates because when questions were asked  \nabout such ownership, they declined  to answer frankly. Furthermore, when the \ndefendants\u2019 lawyers wrote  to the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers to pursue this question after \nobjections had been filed to the Board,  the plaintiffs\u2019  lawyers avoided  giving an \nanswer until the defendants\u2019 lawyers  sent a more formal request by way of \ninterrogatories. It was  only then that the plaintiffs  gave the answer.\n49 The plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers  explained orally that it was their oversight in \nomitting to respond to the written  requests for the information.  When the \ninterrogatories were  served, the plaintiffs answered promptly  without \nchallenging the need for the interrogatories.\n50 In the circumstances,  I accept that even if Lim and Chan were obliged  \nin law to disclose  the fact of ownership by their associates, the omission  to do \nso was based on legal advice. That omission, as well as the omission by the \nplaintiffs\u2019 lawyers  to answer  questions raised  by the defendants\u2019 lawyers  \nconcerning the question  of ownership of units  by associates, was not evidence \nof bad faith.  \nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLim Hun Joo v  Kok Yin  Chong [2018]  SGHC  256\n1351 That said, I agree that the matter should have been better handled by Lim \nand Chan and the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers.  Even though the lawyers had advised that \nthere was no conflict,  the lawyers should also have  advised them  to disclose the \nownership by their associates to avoid unnecessary suspicion.  Furthermore, this \nwould have  been the prudent  step in case their lawyers\u2019 advice that there was \nno actual or potential  conflict was wrong. The refusal by Lim and Chan  to \ndisclose, when initially asked,  fuelled suspicion that something was amiss. \nLater, the omission to respond  to written requests  from the defendants\u2019 lawyers  \nadded more fuel to the suspicion. By the time a positive  answer  was given, it \nappeared to come too late to assuage the suspicion raised. The matter was not \nwell handled especially  by the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers but that too was not evidence \nof bad faith  on the part of plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers or the CSC.\nApprovals of the  apportionment of sale  proceeds and of  the terms and \nconditions of the  CSA\n52 I come to the second main sub-issue on the omission to approve the \napportionment of sale proceeds and of the terms and conditions of the CSA at a \ngeneral meeting  of the management corporation. I have already touched upon \nthis earlier.\n53 To recapitulate,  this omission  was a breach of paras 7(1)(b)  and 7(1)( c) \nof the Third Schedule. Unfortunately,  this omission was the result of advice \nfrom the lawyers for the CSC  who also act for the plaintiffs. They had advised \nthat it was sufficient  for the assenting  subsidiary proprietors to sign the CSA \nafter the meeting. Clearly, such  advice  was wrong.\n54 Relying on such advice, the CSC stuck to the position that there was to \nbe no voting at the general meeting even though some subsidiary proprietors \nhad questioned whether  this position was correct. It was unfortunate that the \nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLim Hun Joo v  Kok Yin  Chong [2018]  SGHC  256\n14CSC members  appeared  not to have considered the matter more carefully by \nthemselves. It appears that they simply accepted their lawyers\u2019 advice without \nquestion. While they were  entitled to rely on lawyers\u2019  advice, the CSC members  \nshould have questioned the validity of the advice  in the light of questions being \nraised and of the clear terms of paras  7(1)(b)  and 7(1)(c ) and also para 7(2).  Be \nthat as it may, the breach of the relevant  provisions was caused by the lawyers  \nfor the CSC. It was not evidence  of bad faith on the part of the CSC. I add that \nI am not  persuaded that there was prejudice to any subsidiary proprietor.\nDC\n55 The third main  sub-issue on the question of good  faith pertains to the \nDC. \n56 Knight Frank, who was the marketing  agent for the collective sale, had \ngiven three estimates of the DC to the subsidiary proprietors. The amount of \neach estimate increased, from an initial estimate of $48.4m to the third and last \nestimate of $63.19m.  Knight Frank had also alerted  the subsidiary proprietors \nabout the likelihood  of an increase  in the DC rates  from 1 March 2018.\n57 Knight Frank and the CSC did not wait for a formal response from the \nUrban Redevelopment Authority (\u201cURA\u201d), which  would provide information  \nto determine the actual  amount of DC (\u201cthe DC verification\u201d), before the \nProperty was launched  for sale on 26 January 2018. Knight Frank had earlier \nappointed an architectural company to make the relevant searches  to obtain the \nDC verification but Knight Frank and the CSC  did not wait for the outcome. \nInstead, soon  after the consent threshold of the subsidiary  proprietors of the lots \nwith not less than 80% of the share  values and not less than 80% of the total \narea of all the lots was reached, the Property was launched for sale by way of \nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLim Hun Joo v  Kok Yin  Chong [2018]  SGHC  256\n15public tender on 26 January 2018 with the outcome of the DC verification \npending.\n58 As it turned  out, URA sent a reply dated  26 February  2018 to the \narchitectural company with information  which revealed that no DC was in fact \npayable.\n59 Knight Frank  immediately began updating potential bidders  in various \nways. After  urgent discussions between Knight Frank and the CSC, it was then \ndecided that the closing date of the tender, ie, 7 March 2018, was not to be \nextended. \n60 In the meantime, Colliers had also been appointed to give an \nindependent valuation of  the Property as at 7 March  2018.  \n61 On that date, the tender box was opened.  There were:\n(a) one expression  of interest  at $480m;\n(b) one bid at  $580m; and\n(c) a second  bid at $610m. \n62 Colliers\u2019 report was also opened.  Colliers valued the Property at $542m.\n63 As the higher of the two bids was higher than both the valuation by \nColliers and the reserve price of $550m, the CSC awarded the tender on 8 March \n2018 to the joint-bidders who had submitted that bid. The joint-bidders \nsubsequently nominated the purchaser  to purchase  the Property in place of them.\nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLim Hun Joo v  Kok Yin  Chong [2018]  SGHC  256\n16(1) Parties\u2019 arguments\n64 The defendants\u2019  objection was that the DC verification was material. \nThis was so especially since  the subsidiary proprietors had been  informed of \nincreasing estimates  of the DC before the launch of the Property for sale. The \nDC had  a bearing on the  reserve price  and on bids  from potential  bidders.\n65 The defendants alleged that the CSC  should have obtained the DC \nverification from  URA before the launch of the Property for sale. Knight  \nFrank\u2019s terms  of appointment stipulated that the searches to obtain  the DC \nverification were  to be done before the Property  was launched for sale. The CSC \nshould not have rushed to have the Property  launched  for sale without obtaining \nthe DC verification.\n66 Furthermore,  when the DC verification  was obtained, the CSC should \nhave extended the closing date of the tender, and informed and consulted the \nsubsidiary proprietors about this material information so that they could decide \nwhether to raise the reserve  price.  That might in turn have yielded a higher bid \nfrom potential  bidders. The CSC had acted  wrongly  in sticking  to the original \ndeadline for the  close  of the tender. \n67 The CSC had also acted wrongly in relying  on Colliers\u2019 report  which  \nwas fundamentally flawed. On this point, the defendants  relied on a belated  \nvaluation by Asian  Assets  Allianz  Pte Ltd (\u201cAAA\u201d) dated 20 August  2018 \nwhich valued the Property  at $637m.\n68 The defendants submitted that the above  conduct of the CSC was \nevidence of  bad faith.\nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLim Hun Joo v  Kok Yin  Chong [2018]  SGHC  256\n1769 The plaintiffs disagreed. They  and Knight Frank said that Knight  Frank \nwas to obtain the DC verification only after the 80% consent threshold had been \nachieved. This was done.  There was no obligation on Knight Frank to obtain the \nDC verification  before  the launch of the Property  for sale. It was market practice \nto launch the Property for sale and seek the  DC verification concurrently.\n70 The plaintiffs  also suggested that the DC was not material. They \nsubmitted that there  was no direct correlation  between (a) the DC and bid prices, \n(b) the DC and  the reserve price and (c) the reserve price and bid prices.\n71 The plaintiffs  said that Knight Frank had acted  promptly  to notify \npotential bidders about  the fact that no DC was payable. Potential  bidders would \nhave been able to react quickly to the news as they would have done  their \nhomework (like their feasibility  studies) already. There  was no need  to extend \nthe closing  date of the tender and no one had requested  for such an extension. \nIn any event,  the higher bid was higher  than Colliers\u2019 valuation  and Colliers\u2019 \nvaluation was valid whereas the valuation by AAA was not.  \n(2) Decision\n72 I am of the view  that the DC verification was material. It was absurd for \nthe plaintiffs and Knight Frank to try and downplay its importance for the \nhearing of  the plaintiffs\u2019 application to the court.\n73 In a situational  update from the CSC  dated  18 October  2017, which  was \nprovided with inputs  from  Knight  Frank, the CSC  stated that the DC was one of \nthe factors that had been taken  into consideration  to establish the reserve price. \nIt was not disputed that the reserve  price was important  to the subsidiary  \nproprietors as they would not be obliged  to sell if a bid was below  the reserve \nprice.\nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLim Hun Joo v  Kok Yin  Chong [2018]  SGHC  256\n1874 While it might be likely that potential bidders would not place too much \nweight on the reserve price when deciding  how much the Property was worth, \nthis did not mean that the DC was irrelevant to them.  On the contrary,  they \nwould still take into account the DC. Indeed, Knight Frank  said as much when \nit sent a letter  dated 8 December  2017 to alert the subsidiary proprietors of the \nhigh likelihood  that DC rates  would rise from  1 March 2018. Furthermore, the \nfact that Knight Frank  had to act urgently to inform potential bidders that there \nwas no DC payable  proves  that the DC was material  information to such parties.\n75 In summary:\n(a) the DC was  important to potential  bidders; and\n(b) the DC was also a factor in determining  the reserve price which  \nwas more important to subsidiary proprietors  than  to potential bidders.  \n76 Should  Knight Frank have obtained  the DC verification before  the \nlaunch of the Property  for sale?  Leaving aside  the evidence for the time being, \nI would have  thought that, as a matter of general principle, such important \ninformation should logically be obtained  first before a sales launch so that \nsubsidiary proprietors are making an informed decision as to what reserve price \nto set and also eventually  what price to accept. Also, even though  I accept that \nthe reserve price is not likely to influence the bid price from potential  bidders, \nthe DC itself does influence the bid price.  Therefore,  it is also preferable if such \ninformation is provided  to potential bidders  earlier rather  than later. I come now \nto the terms  of the scope of services which Knight Frank  was to provide. The \nterms of the scope of services were included in the CSA and both sides relied \non the terms.\nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLim Hun Joo v  Kok Yin  Chong [2018]  SGHC  256\n1977 While it is true that the terms provided for Knight  Frank to carry out the \nexercise to obtain the DC verification upon achieving the 80% consent \nthreshold, this did not mean that Knight Frank was to obtain  the DC verification  \nconcurrently in the  period when the  public tender  remained open.\n78 Both  the CSC and Knight Frank had overlooked the following. Knight  \nFrank had divided its scope of work into three  stages: \u201cPre-Sale Preparation\u201d, \n\u201cMarketing Stage\u201d and \u201cPost Marketing  Stage\u201d.  The provision about obtaining  \nthe DC verification was placed only under  the first stage,  ie, the Pre-Sale \nPreparation. The second  stage, ie, the Marketing Stage, did not include any work \npertaining to the receipt of  or evaluation of the  DC verification. \n79 Likewise, in an \u201cEstimated Project  Timeline\u201d provided by Knight  Frank \nat the extraordinary general meeting on 9 September 2017 which showed  the \nsequence of various  events, the step to carry out the DC verification was shown \nas occurring before the launch of the Property for sale. There was no other step \nshown to suggest that the receipt of and evaluation  of the DC verification would \nbe done concurrently in the period  when the public tender remained open. \n80 Quite clearly, Knight  Frank\u2019s own terms  of appointment envisaged that \nthe DC verification was to have  been carried out and concluded  before the \nlaunch of the Property  for sale. It was therefore  not open to Knight  Frank or the \nCSC to try and argue that  it was market  practice  to do otherwise.\n81 It was not the case of the plaintiffs that the CSC and Knight Frank knew \nthat Knight Frank was supposed to obtain the DC verification first but, for some \ngood reason, they both agreed  not to stick to the original sequence envisaged \nand agreed instead to obtain the DC verification  later. Instead, it was the \nplaintiffs\u2019 case that Knight Frank\u2019s  terms of appointment did not require Knight \nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLim Hun Joo v  Kok Yin  Chong [2018]  SGHC  256\n20Frank to obtain the DC verification  first before the launch of the Property  for \nsale. As I have mentioned, the  plaintiffs were wrong on this point. \n82 It seems that the CSC  and Knight Frank were in some  haste to launch \nthe sale because  of concerns about competing land sites and the likelihood that \nDC rates would be raised from 1 March 2018. Even then, they should have  been \nmore careful  about  the possibility that the DC might be materially  different from  \nKnight Frank\u2019s latest estimate.  \n83 The truth of the matter is that Knight Frank  and the CSC, as well as the \nlawyers for the CSC,  were all complacent  about the DC. Even though  Knight  \nFrank had made it clear that Knight Frank\u2019s estimates of the DC were subject  \nto verification, they had all assumed that there  would be no material difference  \nbetween the last estimate of the DC given  by Knight Frank before  the launch of \nthe Property for sale and the actual DC as verified.  This was why the CSC, \nKnight Frank and the lawyers for the CSC were prepared to let the Property  be \nlaunched for sale without obtaining the DC verification first. That was also why \nnone of them had highlighted to the subsidiary proprietors that the actual DC \ncould be very different from the last estimate  provided. Apparently neither \nKnight Frank nor the lawyers advised the CSC to ask for guidance  from  the \nsubsidiary proprietors as to what  the CSC should do in the event of a material \ndifference.\n84 The DC verification result  was a material  development. There  was nil \nDC instead  of the $63.19m  given in the last estimate by Knight Frank. It is \nunclear when  the CSC\u2019s lawyers knew about this development.\nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLim Hun Joo v  Kok Yin  Chong [2018]  SGHC  256\n2185 In my view,  as the information concerning the nil DC was received \nbarely over a week before  the close of the tender, the CSC should  have extended  \nthe closing date of the tender by at least one  week.\n86 This would have given Knight Frank more  time to disseminate this \nmaterial information and potential bidders  would have had more time to absorb \nsuch information and respond if they so wished, although I agree that Knight  \nFrank did act quickly to disseminate the  information. \n87 Furthermore,  the CSC  should have informed and consulted the \nsubsidiary proprietors about this material development. Whether or not the \nreserve price  would have  been raised and whether or not potential  bidders would \nhave taken  into account the reserve price, the point  is that the subsidiary \nproprietors had been given, although  inadvertently,  an inaccurate impression \nabout the DC and this should  have been corrected  immediately. They should \nalso have been given  a chance to have  their say as to what the next step should \nbe. An extension of at least one week would have  given the CSC time to call for \nan urgent  meeting of the subsidiary proprietors or, if possible, a waiver of short \nnotice of an  extraordinary general meeting.\n88 As it was, when  the subsidiary proprietors were subsequently  informed \nabout the new information at a meeting on 19 March  2018, queries  were raised  \nas to why they were  not informed more  promptly. Having  said that, I accept  that \nno assenting  subsidiary proprietor sought to withdraw from  the CSA and \napparently some subsidiary  proprietors  added their signatures to  the CSA. \n89 I find that, unfortunately, Knight Frank and the CSC did not even \nconsider whether the new information should have been  disclosed to the \nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLim Hun Joo v  Kok Yin  Chong [2018]  SGHC  256\n22subsidiary proprietors at the material time. This was not a case where they had \nraised and discussed this question. It did not cross their minds.\n90 I find that when  the CSC  failed to consider whether to inform and \nconsult the subsidiary  proprietors or not, the CSC  acted wrongly. They had been \ntoo focused on the potential bidders that they lost sight of the subsidiary  \nproprietors.\n91 Fortunately  for the CSC,  Colliers\u2019 valuation was just below  the reserve \nprice and the higher bid was higher than the  valuation and the reserve  prices.  \nColliers\u2019 valuation\n92 The question then is whether Colliers\u2019 valuation was fundamentally \nflawed as alleged by the defendants. This pertained to the fourth sub-issue  about \ngood faith.\n93 In summary, both valuations took into account the fact that there was no \nDC. However, AAA\u2019s valuation at $637m was much higher than Colliers\u2019 \nvaluation at $542m. This was because both valuations were based on different  \npremises.\n94 Colliers\u2019 valuation was based on a gross plot ratio (\u201cGPR\u201d) of 1.4 as \npermitted under the URA Master  Plan 2014. AAA\u2019s valuation was based  on a \nGPR of 1.655. This was because  AAA did not use the GPR provided under the \nURA Master  Plan 2014. Instead, it used the information from the development  \ncharge baseline applicable to the  Property.\n95 However,  it was clear that the development  charge baseline information \nonly determined  whether there would be any DC. The development  charge \nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLim Hun Joo v  Kok Yin  Chong [2018]  SGHC  256\n23baseline information did not provide information on the permissible GPR. The \nURA letter dated 26 February  2018 stated as much.\n96 Nevertheless, AAA  was of the view that a valuation should take into \naccount the possibility  that URA might allow a higher GPR in view of the \ndevelopment charge baseline.  It reasoned that there was no doubt that any \ndeveloper would  promptly request  URA to approve a development based on a \nGPR of 1.655. \n97 I am of the view that AAA\u2019s reasoning  was misplaced. It is one thing to \nassume that a successful bidder will request  for a higher GPR, it is another to \nassume that it is prepared to commit to a price based on a possibility that it \nwould obtain approval for  a higher  GPR.\n98 It is different if AAA\u2019s reasoning  was that there  should be a tiered  \npricing or tiered valuation. The first tier should be based on the current GPR  of \n1.4. The second is then based on the possible increase of the GPR. From the \nCSC\u2019s point of view, this would  perhaps then mean that the CSC  should have \nobtained a tiered pricing,  ie, a committed price  based on the current GPR with \na premium  if a higher  GPR  was allowed.  However, AAA did not present its \nvaluation on a tiered basis. Neither  did the defendants argue that the CSC should \nhave obtained a tiered pricing from the purchaser. Their argument was more \nbasic, ie, that Colliers was wrong to use the  GPR  of 1.4 in  its valuation. \n99 In my view,  Colliers\u2019 valuation was not flawed. On the contrary, AAA\u2019s \nvaluation was flawed. A valuation should be based on existing  facts. A property \nmay be under-utilised at present  and, based  on existing  facts, its potential is \nknown. This is different from valuing a property  based only on a possibility  of \nachieving a higher GPR. I agree with Colliers that such an approach would be \nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLim Hun Joo v  Kok Yin  Chong [2018]  SGHC  256\n24speculative. It would be inappropriate for the purpose of a valuation  intended to \nassist the CSC in a collective sale.\n100 It is also important  to note that AAA did not say that Colliers\u2019 valuation \nwas wrong if it was correctly based on a  GPR  of 1.4.\nConclusion\n101 After considering all the facts holistically, including those  not \nspecifically mentioned in this oral judgment, I conclude that although the \nconduct of the CSC, Knight Frank and the lawyers for the CSC was wanting in \nvarious respects, there was no bad faith after taking into account  the sale price,  \nwhich was $68m or 12.55% higher than Colliers\u2019  valuation.\n102 As it turns out, the subsequent cooling measures introduced  by the \ngovernment in or about July 2018 makes the sale price seem even  more \nfavourable for all subsidiary proprietors, although this has no direct bearing on \nthe question of good faith which is to be determined at the time the sale process \nwas undertaken. \n103 The plaintiffs have  proven that the transaction is in good faith. \nAccordingly, I grant an order in terms  of prayers 1 to 6 and 9 of the plaintiffs\u2019 \napplication with the qualification that the \u201cMinority  Owners\u201d, as defined in the \napplication, need not pay the majority  owners\u2019 solicitors\u2019 costs in the \napplication and hearing  fees until this question is later determined by the court \nafter hearing  arguments on it. Likewise,  prayers  7 and 8 of the application \nregarding costs  and disbursements will be heard at a later date.\n104 Although the CSC and their professional advisors may view this court\u2019s \ndecision as a victory for the majority owners,  I hope that they reflect long and \nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nLim Hun Joo v  Kok Yin  Chong [2018]  SGHC  256\n25hard on their missteps.  It is also a pity that the plaintiffs were not more \nforthcoming in their conduct of the litigation. They were slow  to acknowledge \nthe possibility that there might have  been  missteps in the sale process.  I will \ntake the missteps and the way in which  the litigation was conducted  by both \nsides into account on the question  of costs and disbursements to be decided later.\nWoo Bih LiJudge\nWong  Soon Peng Adrian, Ang Leong Hao, Gan  Hiang Chye and  \nNorman Ho (Rajah & Tann Singapore LLP) for the plaintiffs;\nTan Gim Hai Adrian, Ong  Pei Ching  and Goh Qian\u2019en, Benjamin  \n(TSMP Law Corporation) for the  defendants.\nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)"}

MAN had commenced arbitration proceedings in 2014 against IMSPL for, inter alia, damages in respect of wrongful avoidance of a sale and purchase contract for two-stroke engines.

At the time of hearing, IMSPL had filed SUM 2612 for leave to appeal against the dismissal of SUM 3315.

The \nPlaintiff became  a partner on 23 February 2009.98 \n73 RXPPL was subsequently incorporated on 15 June 2011. RXP and \nRXPPL are principally two units carrying out the same business activities  (ie, \nproviding accountancy and information  technology  (\u201cIT\u201d) services). The only \ndifference is that RXP is used to bill clients on a non-GST  basis since it is not \n97 NE, 31 March 2017, 16:26\u201331.\n98 PBD 440\u2013441.\n31\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nYap Boon  Fong Yvonne v  Wong Kok Mun  Alvin [2018]  SGHC  26\nGST-registered (unlike  RXPPL).99 Overall, the Plaintiff handled  accounting, \nand the sales and business development  of IT services and products. In other  \nwords, she was in charge of going out to meet  clients  and getting in customers. \nHer partner,  Wong, handled  the operations  aspects of the business.100\n74 Up till October  2008,  prior to joining RXP, the Plaintiff had been \nemployed as a Finance Manager with J Walter Thompson  (Singapore)  Pte Ltd \n(\u201cJWT\u201d) and drew  a fixed monthly salary  of $6,300.101\nOverview of the parties\u2019 cases\n75 The Plaintiff  submitted that but for the accident  and the resultant \ninjuries, she would  have  developed RXP\u2019s and RXPPL\u2019s businesses  to an even  \ngreater extent than reflected in her Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore \n(\u201cIRAS\u201d) Notices of Assessment up to the trial of this action.  The Plaintiff \noffered two alternative methods of quantifying her pre-trial loss of earnings. \nThe Plaintiff\u2019s primary computation method relied  heavily on a spreadsheet \ndocument produced  by the Plaintiff explaining  her computation of what RXP  \nand RXPPL\u2019s profits would have been if not for the accident and her injuries,  \nspanning 2011 to 2014 (\u201cthe Forecasts\u201d).102 The Plaintiff\u2019s alternative \ncomputation method used the Plaintiff\u2019s salary  from her past employment at \nJWT as a proxy for estimating her pre-trial loss of earnings. I elaborate more on \nboth methods later.\n99 NE, 31 March 2017, 49:7\u201350:10.\n100 NE, 31 March 2017, 16:3\u201316.\n101 Yap Boon Fong Yvonne\u2019s AEIC dated 13 January 2015, exh YBF-10,  pp 235\u2013259.\n102 PBD 528\u2013533.\n32\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nYap Boon  Fong Yvonne v  Wong Kok Mun  Alvin [2018]  SGHC  26\n76 The defendants submitted that the Plaintiff\u2019s  pre-trial loss of earnings, if \nany at all, was limited to the year 2011. The defendants  argued that neither of \nthe Plaintiff\u2019s computation methods ought to be accepted. They  proffered a third \ncomputation method  for this court\u2019s consideration.\nWhether the Plaintiff  suffered any pre-trial loss of earnings\n77 I first consider whether the Plaintiff had in fact suffered any pre-trial \nloss of earnings. It is important to bear in mind that at the time of the accident, \nthe Plaintiff  was self-employed  and her income  was essentially  derived  from  \nRXP\u2019s and RXPPL\u2019s earnings.\n78 The defendants argued that the Plaintiff\u2019s income had in fact increased \nafter the accident. Her IRAS Notice  of Assessment showed that she only earned \n$14,786 in 2010 before the accident.  Post-accident, the Plaintiff went on to earn \n$17,230 in 2012 and her income peaked  at $60,270 in 2013. Therefore, \naccording to the defendants, the Plaintiff  did not suffer any pre-trial loss of \nearnings.103\n79 The defendants also argued that save for 2011, the evidence  did not show \nthat RXP and RXPPL had declined in profitability. The defendants  relied on the \nfollowing undisputed figures:104\nYear RXP\u2019s (and  RXPPL\u2019s, where  applicable)  \nprofit before director remuneration\n2008 No information available\n2009 Net loss of  $17,356.05\n103 DCS, para 63.\n104 DCS, para 75.\n33\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nYap Boon  Fong Yvonne v  Wong Kok Mun  Alvin [2018]  SGHC  26\n2010 Net profit of  $91,603.95\n2011 Net loss of  $47,946.84\n2012 Net profit of  $61,520.53\n2013 Net profit of  $122,367.83\n2014 Net profit of  $76,587.98\n2015 No information available\n2016 No information available\nThe right column  labelled \u201cprofit before  director remuneration\u201d refers to RXP\u2019s  \nactual net profit (or loss) for each year, combined  with RXPPL\u2019s  where \napplicable (ie, from  2011 onwards).  For ease of reference in this judgment, I \nrefer to the \u201cprofit before  director remuneration\u201d  as RXP\u2019s net profit or loss.\n80 The defendants submitted  that based  on the pre-accident years of 2009 \nand 2010,  RXP\u2019s  average  net profit  was $37,123.95. This was the base figure to \ndetermine whether RXP and RXPPL  had suffered a decline in profitability after \nthe Plaintiff\u2019s accident in 2011. The defendants submitted  that except for 2011 \nwhen RXP  suffered a net loss, RXP\u2019s net profit did not decline: from  2012 till \n2014, RXP\u2019s yearly  net profit exceeded  the pre-accident average net profit of \n$37,123.95. There was no evidence  in respect of the other years.  Thus, the \ndefendants said that the Plaintiff had no basis to claim a loss of earnings except \nin respect of 2011.105 \n81 I disagree with the defendants\u2019 submissions.  First, in my view, it was \ninappropriate to use RXP\u2019s average  earnings  for 2009 and 2010 as the base \n105 DCS, paras 78 and  81\u201382.\n34\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nYap Boon  Fong Yvonne v  Wong Kok Mun  Alvin [2018]  SGHC  26\nfigure for comparison.  RXP  only started providing  accounting and IT solutions \nin 2011. Prior to that, RXP was involved in the business of providing digital  \nimaging services for Community Development Councils and SPRING  \nSingapore and engaged elderly people as part-time  staff.106 That was a \ncompletely different business involving a completely  different business model. \nThus, RXP\u2019s  earnings in 2009 and 2010 would not be an accurate gauge of the \nbusiness\u2019s performance and profitability for 2011 and beyond,  when RXP  began \nproviding accounting and IT solutions.\n82 Second,  and more fundamentally,  it seems to me that the defendants\u2019 \nsubmissions missed the point. It was not the Plaintiff\u2019s case that her income had \ndeclined as compared  to the years before, or that RXP\u2019s  and RXPPL\u2019s  \nprofitability had declined  as compared  to the years before. The Plaintiff\u2019s case \nwas that she suffered a loss of earnings because RXP and RXPPL were  less \nprofitable than they could  have  been , had the Plaintiff been  able to develop the \nbusinesses without the disruption  caused by the accident and the injuries she \nsustained as a result. In my view,  the award for loss of pre-trial earnings should \ncompensate the Plaintiff  for her share  of the net profit that RXP and RXPPL  \nwould otherwise have made, notwithstanding  the fact that the numbers show no \napparent decline in profitability.\n83 This approach  finds support in the case of Koh Soon Pheng  v Tan Kah \nEng [2003] 2 SLR(R) 538 (\u201cKoh Soon Pheng\u201d), which  the defendants \nthemselves relied on. The plaintiff  was the owner  of a motorcycle workshop, \nand most of the time he was the only worker  in the business.  In 2000, the \nplaintiff unfortunately met with an accident  and sustained injuries  which made \nit difficult for him to carry, repair and service motorcycles as he used to do. \n106 NE, 31 March 2017, 16:30\u201317:27.\n35\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nYap Boon  Fong Yvonne v  Wong Kok Mun  Alvin [2018]  SGHC  26\nBased on documentation from the IRAS, his business suffered  a net loss of \n$23,436 and $4,935 in 2001 and 2002 respectively. The High Court  agreed  with \nthe plaintiff that his true loss of earnings was not just the amount that he had in \nfact lost (determined by comparing  pre and post-accident figures),  but also \nincluded the amount that he would otherwise  have  made as  profit (at [13]). \n84 Although the issue in Koh Soon Pheng was quantification rather than the \nfact of the loss, it stands to reason  that if the court found that the plaintiff was \nentitled to claim  the profit that he would otherwise have made, the court must \nhave considered  that the plaintiff did in fact suffer a loss, albeit  one not \nexpressly reflected in the figures. Thus, although RXP\u2019s  post-accident net \nprofits were generally higher than its pre-accident average  net profits, this does \nnot mean that the Plaintiff did not suffer  any compensable loss of earnings as a \nresult of the  accident. \n85 I agree with the Plaintiff that the accident prevented her from  developing \nRXP and RXPPL to the extent  she otherwise would have. As a matter of logic,  \nthat must  have  been the case. RXP and RXPPL  were essentially driven by two \npersons, the Plaintiff and Wong. Of the two partners in business,  the Plaintiff \nwas the one in charge of sales and business development. Her job required her \nto, inter alia, travel frequently within Singapore to meet existing  and potential \nclients, arrange  and conduct web hosting and\/or  software demonstrations and \npresentations in conjunction with pre-sales.107 The fact that she had been \nhospitalised for an extended period of time, required to stay at home for \nrecuperation, and made to endure various  medical procedures and treatments, \nnecessarily prevented her from performing  her role fully. Accordingly the \n107 Yap Boon Fong Yvonne\u2019s AEIC dated 13 January 2015, para 29.\n36\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nYap Boon  Fong Yvonne v  Wong Kok Mun  Alvin [2018]  SGHC  26\nPlaintiff was unable to develop the business to the extent she would otherwise \nhave had if the accident had not occurred.  \n86 In my view, the fact that RXP and RXPPL  remained profitable in the \npost-accident years was in no small part due to the Plaintiff\u2019s  commendable \nresilience. The Plaintiff  gave evidence that she continued to work  from her \nlaptop even when she was hospitalised.108 It must not be forgotten that the \nIlizarov treatment,  in particular,  must  have  left the Plaintiff  in great pain and \ndiscomfort. Yet she continued to visit clients and vendors in her wheelchair and \ncrutches.109 The Plaintiff had also shifted the firm\u2019s operations to her home, and \ncontinued to work  from  home even  when she was on medical  leave and \nsupposed to be resting.110 She persevered  despite all the obstacles her injuries  \npresented, and RXP and RXPPL managed to turn a profit  every year from  2012 \nonwards. Had she been unencumbered by her injuries and able to put in her \nfullest to develop RXP and RXPPL, no doubt the business  earnings would have \nbeen higher and she would have  enjoyed  a higher income. On that basis, I accept  \nthat the Plaintiff suffered a loss of earnings.  To hold otherwise would only \npenalise the Plaintiff  for the hard work and effort that she had put in despite  her \ninjuries.\nQuantifying the Plaintiff\u2019s pre-trial  loss of earnings\n87 Given  that I am satisfied that the Plaintiff suffered a loss (ie, her share \nof the net profit that RXP and RXPPL  would have made but for the accident), I \nturn now to consider the question of quantification. As mentioned  at [75]\u2013[76] \n108 NE, 31 March 2017, 77:12\u201318; 5 April 2017, 86:26\u201387:8.\n109 NE, 5 April 2017, 87:23\u201324.\n110 PBD 30.\n37\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nYap Boon  Fong Yvonne v  Wong Kok Mun  Alvin [2018]  SGHC  26\nabove, the Plaintiff offered  two different computation methods and the \ndefendants offered  a third.\n(1) The Plaintiff\u2019s  pleaded case\n88 Before  discussing the three  computation methods, I first mention the \nPlaintiff\u2019s pleaded  case on pre-trial loss of earnings. In her statement  of claim, \nthe Plaintiff claimed $384,000, calculated as follows:111\ne. Loss of earnings  being salary  and net profits from RXP \nand salary  and dividends from [RXPPL] for 32 months \nand still continuing  at $12,000.00 a month \n[emphasis added]\n89 The defendants\u2019 main objection  was that the Plaintiff had not proved this \nloss of $384,000 because  according  to her IRAS  Notices of Assessment,  her \nincome had in fact increased after the accident.112 This objection misses the point \nbecause, as I have said, the Plaintiff\u2019s  case was that she would have earned  more  \nthan she actually had if she had been able to develop RXP and RXPPL without \nthe disruption caused  by the accident  and the resulting injuries.  As mentioned,  \nI am satisfied  that the Plaintiff did suffer a loss of earnings, albeit not one \nexpressly reflected in the  figures (see  [86]  above).\n90 The defendants next pointed out that the Plaintiff  had not explained the \n$12,000 figure  mentioned in her statement  of claim anywhere in her first and \nsecond AEICs.113 When the Plaintiff was asked in cross-examination to justify \nthe $12,000 figure,  she explained that in her view, based on her 20 years of \n111 Statement  of Claim (Amendment No 1) dated 12 February  2016, Annexure  B, para (e).\n112 DCS, para 63.\n113 DCS, paras 20 and  63.\n38\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nYap Boon  Fong Yvonne v  Wong Kok Mun  Alvin [2018]  SGHC  26\naccounting experience, she would have  been  promoted to a Chief Financial  \nOfficer or a Finance Director by 2014. In such a role, she would have earned \nabout $12,000 per month based  on 13 months.114 However, this was but a bare \nassertion unsupported by any objective evidence.  In any event, such an \nexplanation would only support the Plaintiff\u2019s claim for the years 2014 and \nbeyond, but not the years before.  Finally, as the defendants  correctly pointed \nout, if the Plaintiff\u2019s  claim  was simply  based  on her alleged salary of $12,000 \nper month,  that quantification method is clearly wrong as it fails to give credit \nfor the Plaintiff\u2019s  actual  earnings for that  period.115  \n91 More significantly, however, it became clear through cross-examination \nand the Plaintiff\u2019s closing submissions  that the Plaintiff had not actually \nquantified her claim based on a flat figure  of $12,000 per month per se. $12,000 \nwas simply a convenient  figure that was inserted in the statement  of claim at the \ntime when  it was drafted.116 As I will explain below, the Plaintiff\u2019s  closing \nsubmissions made clear  that her claim for pre-trial loss of earnings was to be \nquantified either on the basis of the Forecasts  or the Plaintiff\u2019s former salary  \ndrawn while employed by JWT. \n92 It was not entirely satisfactory that the Plaintiff  had somewhat deviated \nfrom the manner in which the quantum of her pre-trial loss of earnings  had \noriginally been pleaded in the statement of claim. Nonetheless, given that I am \nsatisfied that the Plaintiff did suffer a pre-trial loss of earnings (see [86] above), \nI am of the view  that the court is entitled to consider  the various quantification  \nmethods suggested by parties in order  to arrive at a result that is just and \n114 NE, 5 April 2017, 110:23\u201328; PCS, para 97.\n115 DCS, para 66.\n116 NE, 5 April 2017, 101:1\u20134.\n39\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nYap Boon  Fong Yvonne v  Wong Kok Mun  Alvin [2018]  SGHC  26\nappropriate in all the circumstances. I therefore now turn to consider the \nPlaintiff\u2019s two proposed  computation methods.\n(2) The Plaintiff\u2019s  primary computation method\n93 Under the primary computation  method,  the Plaintiff submitted that her \npre-trial loss of earnings from July 2011 to March 2017 ought  to be quantified \nat $578,244.32.117\n94 This method  drew largely  from the Forecasts  prepared by the Plaintiff, \nwhich I mentioned at [75] above.  In the Forecasts, the Plaintiff set out RXP  and \nRXPPL\u2019s actual and forecast \u201cprofit before  director remuneration\u201d (ie, net profit \nor net loss) for the years 2011 to 2014. The Plaintiff then took 50% of that \namount (being her share of the profits)  and gave  credit for the amount that she \nhad actually earned in the  corresponding period .\n95 The Plaintiff\u2019s computations for her claim of $578,244.32 are \nreproduced in the table  below:118\nYear Amount \nactually  \nearned by the \nPlaintiff\n(a)Amount that \nthe Plaintiff \nshould  have \nearned\n(b)The Plaintiff\u2019s \nclaim \n(b) \u2013 (a)\n2011 (Jul \u2013 Dec)\n$2,203.50 $59,582.34 $57,378.84\n2012 (Jan \u2013 $17,229.26 $89,373.51 $72,143.55119\n117 PCS, para 74.\n118 PCS, Annexure B.\n119 It should be noted that the Plaintiff\u2019s submissions contained a very minor calculation  \nerror.

As can be seen, the Forecasts formed the cornerstone of \nthe Plaintiff\u2019s claim, and must be carefully  considered. \n96 The first issue to be considered is the admissibility of the Forecasts. It \nwas not disputed that the Plaintiff  had produced these Forecasts  entirely  by \nherself, for the purpose of litigation, and that they had not been  independently \nverified. The defendants  objected to the admissibility  of the Forecasts on the \nground that they constituted opinion evidence  and that the Plaintiff, being a \nwitness of fact, could only give evidence on facts  that she had perceived.  That \nis, she was only entitled to present primary  documents in support of RXP\u2019s  and \nRXPPL\u2019s actual earnings. The defendants argued that the Plaintiff  could only \ngive opinion evidence if the exceptions  set out in ss 47\u201353 of the Evidence Act \n120 Flowing from the calculation error noted above, the correct figure  representing  the total \nin this column should be  $578,245.02.\n41\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nYap Boon  Fong Yvonne v  Wong Kok Mun  Alvin [2018]  SGHC  26\n(Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (\u201cEA\u201d), or in case law, were met. The defendants \nsubmitted that these requirements were  not met \u2013 the Plaintiff was not an \n\u201cexpert\u201d in the field of forecasting  business growth  and earnings, because her \nexpertise was actually in the field of accountancy.121 They further argued  that \nthe Plaintiff  could not be her own expert  because of her direct interest in the \noutcome of the matter.122\n97 In response, the Plaintiff first argued  that the Forecasts were admissible \nas they were matters of fact.123 I can quickly  dispose of this argument. Quite \nclearly the Forecasts were not merely  statements of fact. Creating a forecast \nrequires interpreting, drawing inferences from and making assumptions  about \nan underlying state of affairs. The underlying  state of affairs would be factual \nin nature, but the forecast itself must necessarily be to some extent opinion. In \nother words,  the Forecasts depended in part on matters of fact and in part on \nmatters of opinion (in particular, assumptions).\n98 Further  or in the alternative, the Plaintiff argued that the Forecasts were  \nadmissible pursuant to s 32B(3)  of the EA,124 which reads:\nWhere a person is called  as a witness  in any proceedings, a \nstatement of opinion by him on a relevant  matter on which he \nis not qualified  to give expert evidence, if made  as a way of \nconveying relevant facts personally perceived  by him, is \nadmissible as evidence  of what he perceived.  \nI pause  to note that since the Plaintiff was relying on s 32B(3) of the EA, this \nwas essentially a concession that the Plaintiff was \u201cnot qualified to give expert \n121 DCS, paras 23\u201331.\n122 DRS, paras 7\u20139.\n123 PCS, para 89.\n124 PCS, paras 88\u201391.\n42\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nYap Boon  Fong Yvonne v  Wong Kok Mun  Alvin [2018]  SGHC  26\nevidence\u201d.

The parties also agreed a buyout by one side was necessary and appropriate.', '24\\u2003The dispute between the plaintiffs and the 1st to 6th defendants was over who should buy out whom. Each side wanted to buy out the other. The parties therefore asked this court to decide who should buy out whom.

In the circumstances, I decided that the 1st to 6th defendants (the majority shareholders) should buy out the plaintiffs (the minority shareholders).', '25\\u2003The parties had agreed to the buyout order being made on the basis that s 216(2) of the Act had been invoked. In my view, the principles discussed above were relevant and applicable to this case. As I had ordered a buyout of the plaintiffs\u2019 shares, the plaintiffs were entitled to their shares being valued without any discount unless the 1st to 6th defendants could show that applying discounts for lack of control and\/or lack of free transferability would be just and equitable.', '26\\u2003The 1st to 6th defendants argued that the purpose of a valuation exercise is to determine the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares under valuation and that the valuer should take into account commercial realities. However, as discussed earlier, a buyout pursuant to s 216(2) is not a freely negotiated commercial transaction. The buyout order that I made was an order made in the exercise of the court\u2019s coercive power pursuant to s 216(2). In fact, in this case, whichever way I decided, it was clear that the selling parties would not be willing sellers. \u201cCommercial realities\u201d was not sufficient reason to justify applying a discount to the plaintiffs\u2019 shares for lack of control and lack of free transferability.', '27\\u2003The 1st to 6th defendants also argued, relying on Thio Syn Kym, that the question of whether a discount should be applied for lack of free transferability, should be left to the valuer to decide.

More importantly, in the present case, the valuer had expressly requested the parties to seek the court\u2019s directions as to whether discounts for lack of control and lack of free transferability should be applied. In my view, the approach taken by the valuer was correct. It is for the court to decide what is just and equitable. The 1st to 6th defendants did not show why it would be just and equitable to leave the question of a discount for lack of free transferability to the valuer.'"}

The market-making obligations of a participant in the Scheme therefore entail a significant amount of risk. Under the Scheme, participants can mitigate this risk by entering into forward sale contracts (\u201cFSCs\u201d) with SP Services Limited (\u201cSPS\u201d). 12', '7\\u2003When an FSC between a Scheme participant and SPS is settled, the participant will either receive a payment from SPS or make a payment to SPS.

They had several discussions about how they would do so. One suggestion which they discussed was a joint venture between Dr Peloso\u2019s companies and Abundance Way Investments Ltd (\u201cAbundance Way\u201d). Abundance Way is Mr Chan\u2019s wholly-owned corporate vehicle incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. 19', 'An alternative suggestion was a consultancy agreement between Dr Peloso\u2019s companies and Abundance Way.

The corollary of that was that SEP would have to share with the MM Partner some of its reward for being a participant.', '16\\u2003On 1 June 2015, with the assistance of Menrva, SEP secured Tong Teik Pte Ltd (\u201cTong Teik\u201d) as its MM Partner. 26', 'Tong Teik\u2019s obligations as the MM Partner were to perform SEP\u2019s market-making obligations and to make all negative FSC payments due to SPS.

These concerns were prompted largely by the possibility of electricity suppliers in Singapore deliberately restricting supply. 30', 'These electricity suppliers did not want the Scheme to proceed.

That, in turn, would cause participants in the Scheme to incur negative FSC payments.', '21\\u2003One of the ways to hedge against volatility in the electricity futures market is by entering into contracts for differences on the WEP (\u201cCFDs\u201d).

The principle underlying this disciplinary process is that complaints against advocates and solicitors should first be adjudged by their peers before they are brought before the court (Wee Soon Kim Anthony v Law Society of Singapore [1988] 1 SLR(R) 455 at [17]). Seen in this light, s 94A(1) of the LPA reflects an exception to the approach that is generally applicable. It provides for a procedure which bypasses the usual prior steps in the disciplinary process and obliges the Law Society to make an application directly to this court (Law Society of Singapore v Nathan Edmund [1998] 2 SLR(R) 905 at [9]).', '11\\u2003Section 94A(1) of the LPA provides as follows:', '12\\u2003As can be seen, a key requirement for triggering s 94A(1) is that the regulated legal practitioner must be \u201cconvicted of an offence involving fraud or dishonesty\u201d.', '13\\u2003Although fraud or dishonesty is not a constituent element of s 37J(2) of the ITA, there is no doubt that the respondent acted dishonestly in the commission of the offence. The SOF which formed the basis of the respondent\u2019s plea of guilt disclosed acts that were plainly dishonest. As mentioned (see [4] above), the respondent connived with other individuals to defraud the Government by abusing the PIC scheme and he then planned to split the gains from the abuse with a co-conspirator. Despite knowing that he did not qualify for the PIC scheme, he concocted various measures to give the appearance that he did qualify for the scheme. The respondent made false declarations, signed a false invoice, made CPF contributions to non-employees and specifically told his sister to lie if she was queried by IRAS. The respondent even pursued an appeal when his initial claim was rejected. In the course of doing all this, he maintained his false declarations.', '14\\u2003Therefore, the critical question in the present case is whether the s 94A(1) procedure is available, even though fraud or dishonesty is not a constituent element of the relevant offence. If this question is answered in the affirmative, the further question arises as to whether due cause has been shown, and consequently, the appropriate sanction that should be imposed on the respondent.'"}

On that day, Boss called Shah and informed him that he would be giving Shah\u2019s mobile phone number to another person. An unknown Indian male (\u201cthe first unknown Indian male\u201d) then called Shah and agreed to meet Shah at a place in Malaysia called \u201cPandan R&R\u201d. Shah drove the Trailer to \u201cPandan R&R\u201d and met the first unknown Indian male there. The first unknown Indian male was driving a white Perodua Viva car. At the location, the first unknown Indian male opened the Trailer\u2019s passenger door and threw a red plastic bag towards Shah. He then closed the door and left. After this, Shah drove the Trailer containing the red plastic bag into Singapore. 4', '6\\u2003At about 9.00am on 4 December 2015, Boss called Shah and asked the latter to perform another delivery to Singapore (\u201cthe second delivery\u201d). After much persuasion, Shah agreed to do so and drove the Trailer to a bus stop near Giant Hypermart in Tampoi, Malaysia (\u201cthe Giant bus stop\u201d). Boss told Shah to wait for two persons there. At the Giant bus stop, another unknown Indian male (\u201cthe second unknown Indian male\u201d) riding a red and black motorcycle approached the Trailer. The second unknown Indian male opened the Trailer\u2019s passenger door and placed a red plastic bag (\u201cA1\u201d) inside a compartment under the passenger seat before leaving. 5', '7\\u2003After about 30 minutes later, the first unknown Indian male from the previous day approached the Trailer, opened the passenger door, and threw another red plastic bag (\u201cB1\u201d) towards Shah. In an angry tone, he told Shah not to \u201cgive him any problem next time\u201d. He then slammed the passenger door shut and left. 6', 'Shah looked into B1 and saw that it contained \u201cganja\u201d. \u201cGanja\u201d is a street name for cannabis. Shah placed B1 in the slot above the Trailer\u2019s radio communication console, and drove towards Singapore.', '8\\u2003Shah\u2019s arrest took place at about 2.20pm that same day. He drove the Trailer into Singapore via the Woodlands Checkpoint. At the Woodlands Checkpoint, he was stopped by officers from the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (\u201cthe ICA\u201d). 7', '9\\u2003The ICA officers conducted a search of the Trailer, and recovered A1 from under its passenger seat. A1 contained one red plastic bag (\u201cA1A\u201d).

The A1 packets contained the drugs that form the subject matter of the charge against Shah. From the inside slot above the radio communication console of the Trailer, the ICA officers recovered B1. B1 contained one plastic bag (\u201cB1A\u201d). Within B1A, there was one block of vegetable matter (\u201cB1A1A\u201d) wrapped in cling wrap (\u201cB1A1\u201d). 8', '10\\u2003Shah admitted to possession and ownership of the drugs listed above. Shah was referred to officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (\u201cthe CNB\u201d) and was placed under arrest by the CNB officers. 9', 'The drug exhibits were also seized by the CNB officers, and the exhibits were subsequently sent to the Health Sciences Authority on 7 December 2015 for analysis. A1A1 was found to contain not less than 18.43 grams of diamorphine. A1A2 was found to contain not less than 18.23 grams of diamorphine. A1A3 was found to contain not less than 18.03 grams of diamorphine. The drug exhibits found within A1 contained a total of not less than 54.69 grams of diamorphine. B1A1A was found to be one block containing not less than 220.3 grams of cannabis and not less than 743.8 grams of cannabis mixture. 10', '11\\u2003The Statement of Agreed facts states that the integrity and custody of all the drug exhibits were not compromised in any way at any point of time. It also states that Shah knew that the A1 packets contained controlled drugs, and that block B1A1A contained cannabis. 11', '12\\u2003In the course of investigations, the CNB officers recorded six statements from Shah. 12', 'There is no dispute as to the admissibility of the statements and both parties agree that the statements were given voluntarily. 13', 'The account given in the six recorded statements generally corresponds with the facts as set out in the Statement of Agreed Facts. However, certain details from the recorded statements are absent from the Statement of Agreed Facts and I set them out below.', '13\\u2003In Shah\u2019s statement recorded under s 22 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) by Assistant Superintendent Michelle Sim on 6 December 2015 at 10.00am, Shah gave details on what transpired during the first delivery for Boss on 3 December 2015. Shah stated that after he had cleared the Woodlands Checkpoint that day, he travelled to Woodlands Avenue 6 to unload certain pre-cast concrete slabs that he was also delivering to a construction site. He was then told by Boss to wait outside the construction site. Throughout this period, Boss called him repeatedly to ask for his location. Shah \u201cfelt really uncomfortable\u201d because he thought there was \u201csomething fishy about the red plastic bag that [he was] holding\u201d. He then \u201cquickly put the red plastic bag under a tree nearby\u201d before standing about a metre away from the red plastic bag. Eventually, about 40 minutes later, a Malay male showed up. Shah picked up the bag and handed it over to the Malay male. 14', '14\\u2003In the same statement, Shah also revealed that he initially did not agree to conduct the second delivery because he felt \u201cuncomfortable\u201d. Apparently this was because he had not been paid for performing the first delivery on 3 December 2015. 15', 'Shah revealed that Boss called him repeatedly, trying to convince him to make the second delivery. Shah initially refused, but eventually relented after Boss told him that he would be paid for the first delivery as well as the second one. 16', '15\\u2003Shah\u2019s testimony at trial generally corresponded with the events as set out in the Agreed Statement of Facts and the six recorded statements. He did not dispute being in possession of the A1 packets. 17', 'His defence was that he did not know what was inside A1, because he never checked the plastic bag. 18', '16\\u2003Shah clarified that Boss told him prior to the first delivery that the items he would be delivering were \u201cnot illegal items\u201d, but \u201cbooks and chocolates\u201d. 19', 'He also testified that he felt \u201cuncomfortable\u201d with making the second delivery not only because he had not been paid for the first delivery, but also because he was uncomfortable about the legality of the items he had brought in on the first delivery. 20', 'Shah agreed that he had the opportunity to check A1 before entering Singapore. 21'"}

The result is that the plaintiff has recovered only a small fraction of the judgment debt which the defendant owes. That recovery is probably insufficient even to cover its legal costs.

The defendant was advised that it was not obliged to disclose the location of the remaining assets because the assets whose location had been disclosed added up in value to $1.5m, thus reaching the limit specified in paragraph 1(a) of the mareva injunction (see [11(a)] above). 40', 'On that basis, the defendant considered itself free under paragraphs 1(c) and 3 of the injunction (see [11(c)] and [11(f)] above) to deal with the remaining assets listed in the affidavit of assets.

The plaintiff further points out that Engen Offshore Pte Ltd was incorporated only in August 2013 44', 'and that Mdm Mageswari was a director of Engen Spares Pte Ltd right up until June 2013. 45', 'Both those dates are shortly after March 2013, when I entered judgment in this action against the defendant. 46', 'The plaintiff suggests that both companies are in fact owned and controlled by the respondents and that the defendant has diverted its assets to these companies in breach of the mareva. 47', 'That is denied by the respondents. 48', 'The evidence which the plaintiff has put before me does not suffice to establish this suggestion on the balance of probabilities.', '27\\u2003According to Mr Tanabalan, in January 2016, he went to Singatac\u2019s office to pay the principal of Singatac, Mr Tan Soon Keong (\u201cMr Tan\u201d), the sum of $24,000 being the arrears of rental then due for storage of the Singatac assets. Mr Tanabalan was denied entry to Singatac\u2019s premises on that occasion. Mr Tan later told Mr Tanabalan that Singatac had scrapped all of the Singatac assets for non-payment of rental. 49', '28\\u2003In evidence before me is a statutory declaration from Mr Tan 50', 'setting out his version of the same events. He corroborates Mr Tanabalan\u2019s evidence in material respects. Mr Tan says that he agreed in February 2014 to rent space in the Singatac premises to Mr Tanabalan to store the Singatac assets for two months at a rent of $1,200. Mr Tanabalan failed to remove the Singatac assets upon the expiry for the two months and was uncontactable for the next eight months. In December 2014, Mr Tan scrapped the Singatac assets for just under $9,000 51', 'because they were obstructing certain construction works which he was obliged to undertake.', '29\\u2003The only difference of substance between Mr Tanabalan\u2019s version of events and Mr Tan\u2019s version of events is that Mr Tanabalan asserts that Mr Tan was aware that the Singatac assets were subject to the mareva injunction. 52', 'Mr Tan denies any such knowledge. 53', 'Nothing of relevance in these committal applications turns on Mr Tan\u2019s state of knowledge.', '30\\u2003Also according to Mr Tanabalan, and also in January 2016, he drove past Transvictory\u2019s premises to check from the outside whether the Transvictory assets were still stored there. He could not see any sign of any of the Transvictory assets. 54', 'The principal of Transvictory is one Mr Richard Chiang (\u201cMr Richard\u201d). 55', 'A few days later, Mr Tanabalan found out from a security guard at Transvictory\u2019s premises that Mr Richard had sold all of the Transvictory assets in late 2015. Mr Tanabalan then spoke to Mr Richard directly. He confirmed to Mr Tanabalan that all of the Transvictory assets had indeed been sold because the defendant had failed to repay a loan of $300,000 which it owed to Transvictory. 56', '31\\u2003Transvictory flatly denies Mr Tanabalan\u2019s evidence. 57', 'Transvictory\u2019s position is that: (i) Transvictory has no knowledge of whether in fact Mr Tanabalan stored any of the defendant\u2019s assets at the Transvictory premises; (ii) Transvictory did not dispose of the Transvictory assets; (iii) Mr Richard never told Mr Tanabalan that Transvictory had disposed of the Transvictory assets; (iv) Transvictory was unaware that the Transvictory assets were subject to a mareva injunction; and (v) Transvictory allowed Mr Tanabalan to have uninhibited access to the Transvictory assets on Transvictory\u2019s premises in order to store and retrieve the Transvictory assets; and (vi) Mr Tanabalan could well have removed the Transvictory assets himself.', '32\\u2003Mdm Mageswari lodged a police report in January 2016, alleging that the Singatac assets had been disposed of because of the defendant\u2019s \u201cinability to pay the rental\u201d and that the Transvictory assets had been \u201cdisposed [sic] for non payment [sic]\u201d. 58', '33\\u2003As I have mentioned (see [16] above), the plaintiff has attempted to levy execution upon the defendant at various stages of this action. I now summarise those attempts.', '34\\u2003In January 2013, the plaintiff\u2019s representatives visited the defendant\u2019s premises at 13 Tuas Avenue 11 together with the sheriff to inspect the assets covered by the mareva injunction. 59', '35\\u2003In September 2013, in execution of the plaintiff\u2019s judgment, the sheriff seized 19 of the defendant\u2019s assets under a writ of seizure and sale. In the affidavit of assets, Mdm Mageswari had valued these 19 assets at $1.05m. In October 2013, the plaintiff\u2019s valuer, Exaco (S) Pte Ltd (\u201cExaco\u201d), valued these 19 assets at $117,400. 60', '36\\u2003In April 2014, the plaintiff inspected the Singatac assets. 61', 'In June 2014, the sheriff seized two engines at the Singatac premises under a writ of seizure and sale. 62', 'This writ of seizure was not followed through and there was no sale of these two engines by auction. 63', '37\\u2003The defendant sent two further letters in May 2014 relating to the location of the Transvictory, Singatac and Soon Lee Street assets.

However, he claimed that the diamorphine \ndid not belong to him and he did not know how it came to be present  in \nBedroom 1. The first time he saw the diamorphine  was around 2pm on \n27 January 2016 when he found the packets  laid out on the bed. He \n28\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Muhammad Nabill bin Mohd Fuad [2018]  SGHC  268\nclaimed that Faizal must have brought the diamorphine to the Flat in the \ntrolley bag and that Sufian may have  laid it out on the bed. Hence, the \ndrugs belonged to Faizal or Sufian, and he merely  tidied up the room by \nplacing them into the \u201cAkira\u201d box.\n(b) He essentially admitted that he knew  that the packets  contained  \ndiamorphine because, by his own account, he had seen them  laid out on \nthe bed at around 2pm on 27 January  2016 and was able to recognise \nthat they contained diamorphine.  \n(c) He also claimed  that the diamorphine did not belong to him and \nby implication  he had no intention to sell it. He claimed that he was in \npossession of it for the purpose of returning it to Faizal. Faizal  was \nsupposed to have retrieved the diamorphine on 27 January 2016, but did \nnot do so  although Nabill  had called  him multiple times.\n48 Nabill\u2019s case  relating  to the cannabis  in the  trolley  bag was as follows:\n(a) In relation to possession, he claimed that Faizal had brought the \ntrolley bag to the Flat while he was asleep and without  his knowledge, \nand he only discovered it  in the storeroom  at 4pm on 27 January 2016.  \n(b) He claimed that he did not know that the trolley bag contained \ncannabis but had instead  believed, based  on what Faizal had told him, \nthat it  contained cigarettes.\n(c) He also claimed that the cannabis did not belong to him and by \nimplication he had no intention to sell it. He claimed that he was in \npossession of it for the purpose of returning it to Faizal. Faizal  was \nsupposed to have retrieved  the trolley  bag with its contents  on 27 \n29\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Muhammad Nabill bin Mohd Fuad [2018]  SGHC  268\nJanuary 2016, but did not do so although Nabill  had called him multiple \ntimes. \n49 To determine whether  the disputed elements have been proved  by the \nProsecution, it was necessary to assess the objective  evidence and the internal \nconsistency and veracity of Nabill\u2019s account of various matters  such as his \nknowledge of Faizal bringing the trolley  bag to the Flat at the material time, his \nknowledge of the contents  of the trolley bag at the material time, and his account  \nof how  the diamorphine came to be found in Bedroom 1.\nWhether Nabill  knew that Faizal brought the trolley bag to  the Flat\n50 I begin with a preliminary point regarding the trolley bag (B1) found in \nthe storeroom. I found that Faizal had brought the trolley  bag to the Flat on 26 \nJanuary 2016. The Prosecution did not dispute that Faizal brought a trolley bag \nsimilar in appearance to B1 to the Flat, although it could not say with certainty \nthat it was B1.86 The CCTV footage of the lift leading to the Flat captured  Faizal \nin the lift with a similar-looking trolley  bag at about  8.20pm on 26 January  2016. \nAround 10.20pm,  the CCTV footage captured Faizal in the lift together  with \nNabill and without  that bag.87 Additionally, Faizal\u2019s DNA  was found on the \ninterior surface  of B1 and on the exterior surface  of the taped bundle and foil \nwhich contained one block of cannabis (B1D).88 I therefore found that Faizal  \nhad brought  the trolley bag to the Flat around  8.20pm on 26 January 2016.\n51 Nabill claimed  that he was unaware that Faizal was planning to come to \nthe Flat on 26 January 2016 to deposit  a trolley  bag. He claimed that he was \n86 15\/8\/18 NE 78; 16\/8\/18 NE 125.\n87 13\/8\/18 NE 56\u201358; PB 460\u2013461.\n88 PB 197\u2013198.\n30\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Muhammad Nabill bin Mohd Fuad [2018]  SGHC  268\nasleep between 7pm and 10pm that night, so he was asleep when Faizal arrived \nand only realised that Faizal was at the Flat when  Mashitta woke  him up around \n10pm. Although he and Faizal subsequently had a chat, Nabill claimed  that \nFaizal did not tell him that he had brought a trolley bag to the Flat.89 He \ndiscovered the trolley bag in the storeroom only around 4pm on 27 January  2016 \nand found out that it contained cannabis only after he was arrested. I rejected \nNabill\u2019s testimony and found that he knew on 26 January 2016, when Faizal \ncame to the Flat, that Faizal had brought the trolley  bag to the Flat and had done  \nso with  Nabill\u2019s permission and consent.\n52 First, I did not believe Nabill\u2019s claim  that he was asleep from 7pm to \n10pm on 26 January 2016 such that he was unaware  that Faizal had come  to the \nFlat at about 8.20pm with a trolley bag. He could  not have  been asleep as his \nhandphone records  showed multiple calls were made  to and from his handphone  \nduring the same time period. These included  calls made to and from  his \nhandphone at 7.51pm and 8.20pm, around the time when Faizal arrived.90 A call \nlasting 43 seconds was even made from Nabill\u2019s  phone  to Faizal\u2019s phone at \n7.49pm, when Nabill  was supposedly asleep.91 When confronted with these \nrecords, Nabill tried to explain that he had left his handphone in Bedroom 1 \nwhile he was asleep, and so anyone  (including  Sufian) could have  used it to \nmake or receive calls.  Nabill claimed  that it was not uncommon for Sufian\u2019s \nfriends to call Sufian on his handphone.92 I rejected  Nabill\u2019s explanation. Sufian  \nwas not called to testify to support Nabill\u2019s account.  Moreover, Nabill  conceded \nthat Sufian had his own handphone, hence there was no conceivable  reason why \n89 16\/8\/18 NE 19\u201321.\n90 16\/8\/18 NE 56\u201358; PB 109.\n91 16\/8\/18 NE 56; PB 108 (item 589); Exhibit H.\n92 16\/8\/18 NE 58\u201359.\n31\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Muhammad Nabill bin Mohd Fuad [2018]  SGHC  268\nSufian would have had to use Nabill\u2019s  handphone. In my view, Nabill\u2019s \nexplanation was but a feeble attempt  to shore up his claim that he was asleep \nwhen Faizal  arrived at the Flat. His claim that he was asleep  when Faizal arrived \nwas, in  turn,  an attempt to distance  himself from the drugs.\n53 Second,  in the 9th Statement  recorded  on 28 July 2016, Nabill stated  \nthat he was aware that Faizal had gone to the Flat on 26 January 2016 to \u201cput \nthings\u201d and identified the \u201cthings he  put\u201d as the \u201ctrolley bag\u201d (see [33] above).93 \nThis clearly contradicted  his testimony in court  that he only discovered the \ntrolley bag the next day. When pressed during cross-examination, Nabill  first \ntried to explain that the \u201cthings\u201d which  he knew Faizal came to deliver was only \n\u201cice\u201d for his consumption.94 When confronted with the 9th Statement, Nabill  \nadmitted that he knew,  on 26 January  2016 itself, that Faizal  was going to the \nFlat with a trolley bag.95 By Nabill\u2019s  own evidence, he was aware in advance \nthat Faizal  was going  to the Flat with the trolley  bag and to deliver drugs.  For \ncompleteness, the CCTV footage captured  Faizal,  accompanied by Nabill,  \ngoing down the lift at about 10.20pm without a trolley bag. Thus Nabill would \nhave known  that Faizal had left the Flat without the trolley bag and had \ndeposited it in  the Flat.\n54 Next, I found  it unbelievable that Faizal would have  brazenly hidden \nfrom Nabill the fact that he had brought the trolley bag (containing drugs, and \nin such large  quantities)  to the Flat and intended  to keep it there without Nabill\u2019s \npermission or knowledge.  Nabill claimed that Faizal had secretly sought to \nleave all kinds of drugs (eg, heroin, cannabis, ecstasy  and erimin) in the Flat on \n93 PB 470.\n94 16\/6\/18 NE 54, 60.\n95 16\/8\/18 NE 61\u201362.\n32\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Muhammad Nabill bin Mohd Fuad [2018]  SGHC  268\nabout five prior occasions.96 When  Nabill discovered the drugs on each \noccasion, he would tell Faizal off and ask him to immediately remove them.97 \nNabill added that he had developed a habit  of checking the Flat every time after \nFaizal left to ensure that he did not leave  unwanted drugs  behind. Going by \nNabill\u2019s account, it was difficult to believe that Faizal would disrespectfully  \ncontinue to deposit drugs in the Flat without Nabill\u2019s  consent and knowledge, \nrunning the risk of outraging Nabill and affecting their friendship. On Nabill\u2019s \naccount, it was also unbelievable that he would continue to allow Faizal  to come \nto the Flat regularly when  he knew full well that there  was a substantial risk that \nFaizal would again hide drugs in the Flat and put him at risk of being caught \nwith those drugs which  he knew could attract imprisonment or the death penalty.  \nI disbelieved Nabill\u2019s  explanation that he continued to allow Faizal  to come  to \nthe Flat because he needed Faizal  to supply  drugs to him for consumption. As \nNabill admitted, he could easily have met Faizal somewhere outside the Flat to \nobtain the drugs from Faizal.98 Therefore,  Nabill\u2019s account was not internally \ncoherent and suggested, instead, that he was expecting Faizal to come to the Flat \nwith the trolley bag containing the drugs and had knowingly  allowed him to \ndeposit the trolley bag with the drugs in the Flat. \n55 Indeed,  if Nabill  were truly so mistrusting of Faizal that he would check \nthe Flat for drugs whenever Faizal left, and given that he was aware  of the severe \nlegal consequences  of being found with a large quantity of illicit drugs,  then one \nwould expect him to have done a thorough check of the Flat on 26 January 2016 \n(or the next day) after Faizal left. Instead,  Nabill claimed he had checked only \nBedroom 1 and was satisfied upon this cursory check that there were no drugs  \n96 16\/8\/18 NE 50.\n97 16\/8\/18 NE 114\u2013115, 122;  PB 469.\n98 16\/8\/18 NE 52\u201353, 115\u2013116.\n33\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Muhammad Nabill bin Mohd Fuad [2018]  SGHC  268\nin the whole Flat (apart from the methamphetamine in the master  bedroom toilet  \nwhich was for his consumption)  and only discovered  the huge  quantities of \ndiamorphine when  it was laid out on the bed the next day and the cannabis when \nhe was arrested.99 Nabill\u2019s  complacency suggested that he was not worried about \nFaizal bringing drugs to the Flat and was aware  that he would do so.\nWhether Nabill  knew the contents of the trolley  bag \n56 I was also satisfied that Nabill knew  that the trolley bag contained drugs,  \nand that he knew the nature of the drugs in the trolley bag, at the material time \nwhen Faizal brought the trolley bag to the Flat. Nabill\u2019s evidence was that all \nthe drugs found in Bedroom 1 and the storeroom  had been brought by Faizal on \n26 January 2016, because they were  not present in the Flat before that time. If \nso, then if it were found that Nabill knew what the trolley bag contained when  \nFaizal brought  it to the Flat, this knowledge  would extend not only to the \ncannabis found in the trolley bag but also to all the other  drugs  which had \nsomehow found their way from the trolley  bag into Bedroom 1 by the time of \nNabill\u2019s arrest. \n57 First, there was evidence of Nabill\u2019s familiarity with drugs  (and the type \nof drugs found at his Flat), and his past experience with Faizal bringing drugs,  \nincluding diamorphine and cannabis, to the Flat. In the 1st Statement recorded \nafter his arrest, Nabill was able to identify the various types of drugs that were  \nseized from the Flat.  He also testified that he consumed drugs regularly  with \nothers. He claimed that Faizal  came  to the Flat a few times  a week to smoke  \n\u201cice\u201d and that he obtained his \u201cice\u201d from Faizal,  who in turn obtained it from  \nDanish. As mentioned at [54] above, Nabill also claimed that on about five prior \n99 16\/8\/18 NE 22\u201323, 62\u201363.\n34\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Muhammad Nabill bin Mohd Fuad [2018]  SGHC  268\noccasions, Faizal had brought various kinds  of drugs (including diamorphine \nand cannabis) to the Flat without his permission or knowledge, and would \nretrieve them  only upon Nabill\u2019s prompting, which was why he would check \nthe Flat each time after Faizal left to make  sure that he had not left behind  any \ndrugs. \n58 Second,  even by Nabill\u2019s account, his reaction upon discovering the \ntrolley bag in the storeroom strongly suggested  that he in fact knew that the \ntrolley bag contained  drugs and not cigarettes.  I should  state first that I rejected \nNabill\u2019s evidence that he only discovered  the trolley bag on 27 January 2016. \nAs I found  at [53] above, Nabill was aware that Faizal had gone  to the Flat on \n26 January  2016 to deposit a trolley bag and to deliver drugs.100 Nonetheless,  I \nproceeded to assess the internal coherence of Nabill\u2019s own account  of the facts, \non the basis that he discovered the trolley bag on 27 January 2016 as he claimed, \nin order to determine whether he was to be believed. \n59 In this regard, Nabill claimed  that when he discovered the trolley bag in \nthe storeroom around  4pm on 27 January 2016,  he immediately or \n\u201cstraightaway\u201d phoned  Faizal to remove it, because he knew  or at least \nsuspected that it contained drugs.101 His knowledge or suspicion  was entirely to \nbe expected given  Faizal\u2019s purported  history of bringing unwanted large \nquantities of various  drugs to the Flat. However, what was incongruent  with \nNabill\u2019s innocence was his reaction to Faizal\u2019s  reply that the trolley bag only \ncontained cigarettes. Nabill stated that he did not open the trolley bag to verify \nits contents and that he trusted Faizal because  of the \u201csize of the trolley\u201d.102 It \n100 PB 470; 16\/8\/18 NE 61\u201362.\n101 16\/8\/18 NE 72\u201373.\n102 16\/8\/18 NE 116.\n35\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Muhammad Nabill bin Mohd Fuad [2018]  SGHC  268\nwas not obvious  how the size of the trolley bag would have given Nabill any \nassurance. Faizal had never brought large  quantities  of cigarettes  to the Flat \nbefore,103 whereas the many varieties of drugs  that Faizal had previously  brought \nto the Flat could have easily been contained  within a trolley bag. Indeed,  in the \n9th Statement, Nabill said that it was \u201cdifficult  to say\u201d what quantity of drugs  \nFaizal left at the Flat on various occasions because  the quantities differed  and \nwere concealed in various  bags, such as a \u201csling bag\u201d, \u201cbag\u201d, \u201cpaper bag\u201d  or \n\u201cplastic bag\u201d.104 Nabill  explained, however, that he could tell that Faizal had on \noccasion brought  small quantities because the drugs were contained in \u201cjust a \nsmall plastic bag or small sling bag\u201d.105 If anything, the size of the trolley bag \nshould have  given  Nabill cause for worry. \n60 Furthermore,  Nabill\u2019s conduct  and his purported trust in Faizal on 27 \nJanuary 2016 (in taking  Faizal at his word that the trolley bag contained  \ncigarettes) was inconsistent with his apparent lack of trust in Faizal on previous  \noccasions, as seen in the way that he had allegedly searched the Flat after each \nvisit by Faizal to ensure Faizal had not left unwanted drugs  in the Flat. It was \nalso inconsistent  with his apparent lack of trust in Faizal the night before he was \narrested (ie, 26 January 2016) as he claimed he did a check of Bedroom 1 after \nFaizal left the Flat that night. His complacency on this occasion is particularly \nstark given that Nabill  stated that he actually  suspected, when  he called Faizal, \nthat the trolley bag might have  contained drugs, and was aware  of the serious \npenalties attached to drug offences. Additionally, according to his version of \nevents, when he called  Faizal  about the trolley bag around  4pm on 27 January \n2016, he had already discovered the large  quantities of drugs (which he knew at \n103 16\/8\/18 NE 117.\n104 PB 469.\n105 16\/8\/18 NE 53.\n36\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Muhammad Nabill bin Mohd Fuad [2018]  SGHC  268\nthat time to be diamorphine)  in Bedroom 1, and suspected that either Sufian or \nFaizal was responsible for its presence  in the Flat. In this context, it is \ninexplicable that Nabill  did not act to verify that the trolley  bag contained \ncigarettes as Faizal claimed, as one would expect him to have been  worried \nabout the presence of more  drugs. \n61 It was also strange that Nabill was in no hurry to get Faizal  to remove \nthe trolley bag from  the Flat. He only called Faizal  once, and did not try to reach \nhim again  even  though he did not turn up for some  four hours  between the phone  \ncall and the time of Nabill\u2019s arrest.106 Moreover, after Nabill was arrested, he \nmade phone calls (in the presence of CNB officers)  to Danish rather than Faizal  \nto ask Danish to collect  the items, even though by this time he knew that the \ntrolley bag belonged to Faizal.107 \n62 Hence,  I found that Nabill\u2019s evidence and conduct as mentioned  above \nwere all inconsistent with his claim  to innocence.  They suggested  instead that \nhe already knew that the trolley bag contained drugs when Faizal brought  it to \nthe Flat on 26 January 2016 and moreover, that he  knew what the drugs  were.\n63 These findings were supported by Nabill\u2019s conduct immediately after \nhis arrest. SSgt Ika testified  that after Bedroom 1 had been  searched  and the \ndiamorphine discovered,  he asked  Nabill,  \u201cada lagi?\u201d (meaning  \u201cstill some \nmore?\u201d or \u201canymore?\u201d) to which Nabill  replied,  \u201cstoreroom\u201d. I did not believe \nNabill\u2019s alternative  account  that SSgt Ika had asked, \u201cada barang  salah lagi?\u201d \n(meaning \u201cany more illegal things?\u201d),  and that Nabill had directed the CNB \nofficers to the storeroom  because of the contraband  cigarettes rather than the \n106 16\/8\/18 NE 76\u201377.\n107 16\/8\/18 NE 10\u201311.\n37\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Muhammad Nabill bin Mohd Fuad [2018]  SGHC  268\ntrolley bag containing the drugs. First, Nabill\u2019s version of SSgt Ika\u2019s question \nkept evolving. He offered three versions in all: \u201cada barang  salah?\u201d (meaning \n\u201cany illegal things?\u201d); \u201cada barang salah  lagi?\u201d  (meaning \u201cany more  illegal \nthings\u201d); and \u201cada barang  lagi?\u201d  (meaning \u201cany  more things?\u201d).108 In contrast, \nSSgt Ika was consistent  in his testimony that he had merely asked  \u201cada lagi?\u201d \nand that Nabill had replied \u201cstoreroom\u201d. Second, the context supports  the \ninference that Nabill understood SSgt Ika to be asking whether there were any \nmore drugs and had directed the CNB officers to the storeroom because he was \naware that there were drugs in the trolley bag. SSgt  Ika had asked Nabill this \nquestion after Bedroom 1 had been searched and a large amount  of drugs  had \nbeen uncovered.  In this context, Nabill  would have been  aware that SSgt Ika \nwas asking whether  there were any more drugs in the Flat. Furthermore, Nabill \nwas aware  that the officers were  from  the CNB and that they were not \nconducting a raid for contraband  cigarettes.109 This supported my finding that \nNabill was aware that there were  drugs in the storeroom and that they were in \nthe trolley bag.\nWhether Nabill  had possession and knowledge of the diamorphine found in \nBedroom 1\n64 I turn now to the diamorphine found  in Bedroom 1 (the subject of the \n1st Charge) namely, 63 packets (contained  in F1A, F1B, F1C, F1D and F1E) \nthat were found in an \u201cAkira\u201d box and one packet  (G1A1) that was found in a \n\u201cMintek\u201d bag on the bed. I was satisfied  that Nabill was in possession of the \ndiamorphine and knew of its nature  at the material  time.  I rejected his claim that \nhe only discovered the diamorphine (among other drugs which  do not form the \nsubject of the charges) in Bedroom 1 around  2pm on 27 January 2016 and \n108 15\/8\/18 NE 32, 52; 16\/8\/18 NE 7, 82.\n109 16\/8\/18 NE 82.\n38\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Muhammad Nabill bin Mohd Fuad [2018]  SGHC  268\nstowed them away in the \u201cAkira\u201d  box to return  them to Faizal or Sufian. I found \nNabill to be a dishonest witness who contradicted himself  on material \nparticulars and concocted facts  as he went along, in an attempt to disassociate  \nhimself from possession  and knowledge of the diamorphine at the material time.\nNabill\u2019s evolving account of the diamorphine\n65 Nabill\u2019s account  of the diamorphine  in Bedroom 1 was continually \nevolving and therefore not credible.  I set out the more  material changes in his \nversion of events throughout the investigation process and until  the trial.\n66 First, Nabill altered his account  of whether and when he saw the \ndiamorphine exhibits prior to his arrest. In the 1st Statement, he stated that he \nhad never touched or seen the diamorphine exhibits before  his arrest.110 \nHowever, in the 10th Statement, he said that he saw the drugs in Bedroom 1 for \nthe first time on the bed at about 2pm on 27 January 2016, that Mashitta \nquarrelled with him and threw  the packets of drugs at him, and that he then \u201cput \nthem at one side\u201d.111 During the trial, Nabill testified  that he picked up the drugs  \nMashitta had thrown  at him and chucked them  into the \u201cAkira\u201d box.112 \n67 Second,  Nabill  altered his account  of when the \u201cAkira\u201d box and the \ntrolley bag appeared in the Flat. In the 4th Statement, he stated that he was \ncertain that Danish had brought the drugs to the Flat around 3am on 27 January \n2016 because  when  Nabill was fixing the wardrobe and the storage rack (in \nBedroom 1 and the storeroom respectively)  on 26 January 2016, the \u201cAkira\u201d \nbox and trolley bag were not there (in Bedroom 1 and the storeroom \n110 PB 297\u2013298.\n111 PB 474\n112 16\/08\/2018 NE 34.\n39\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Muhammad Nabill bin Mohd Fuad [2018]  SGHC  268\nrespectively) at that time. When this statement  was recorded, Nabill  had yet to \nput forward the version of events  in which he discovered the drugs on the bed \nand chucked them into the \u201cAkira\u201d  box after quarrelling with Mashitta. During  \nthe trial, after his account of his quarrel with Mashitta had emerged, Nabill \nstated that the \u201cAkira\u201d  box had always been in Bedroom 1.113\n68 Third, Nabill completely altered his account of who the diamorphine \nbelonged to. In the 1st Statement, he stated that it belonged to Danish who had \nbrought it to the Flat and in particular  for G1A1, that Danish had intended to \nsell it. In the 2nd to 6th Statements, Nabill supplied details that would make this \nstory about Danish more  realistic \u2013 details  such as how he came to know  Danish, \nDanish\u2019s regular stays at the Flat, Danish\u2019s  supply of \u201cice\u201d  to him, Danish\u2019s  \nhistory of leaving extra \u201cice\u201d behind to \u201cframe\u201d Nabill  into selling the excess  \n\u201cice\u201d for him, and how Nabill had heard  Danish entering the Flat in the early \nhours of 27 January 2016. However,  in the 7th Statement, Nabill claimed  for \nthe first time that Faizal had brought the cannabis to the Flat. From that point \non, Nabill did an about turn and claimed that it was Faizal who had brought all \nthe drugs to the Flat in the trolley bag on 26 January  2016. Nabill  then denied \nthat he knew Danish  and that Danish had ever come  to the Flat. By the time the \n7th Statement was recorded,  Nabill must have  realised that there was CCTV  \nfootage of the lift leading to the Flat, which was why, in that statement, he stated \nfor the first time that Faizal was the person who had brought the trolley bag and \ndrugs to the Flat, and requested for the CCTV footage to be examined. In fact, \nduring the trial, Nabill  admitted that he changed his account  from  \u201cDanish\u201d to \n\u201cFaizal\u201d after ASP Peh showed him the CCTV footage of the lift leading to the \nFlat.114 The CCTV  footage  captured  Faizal in the lift with the trolley bag going \n113 16\/8\/18 NE 35.\n114 16\/8\/18 NE 100; PB 452\u2013453.\n40\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Muhammad Nabill bin Mohd Fuad [2018]  SGHC  268\nup the lift and did not capture any images  of Danish. I found that Nabill  changed \nhis account to attribute the drugs to Faizal only when he realised  that his account  \nabout Danish could  not stand in the face of the  objective records. \n69 Lastly, Nabill  altered his account of how the diamorphine came to be \nfound in Bedroom 1. In the 4th Statement,  he explained that Danish must have  \nbrought them to the Flat at about 3am on 27 January 2016, because these items  \nwere not there when Nabill  was fixing the wardrobe  in Bedroom 1 on 26 January \n2016. In the 8th to 10th Statements, Nabill merely said that all the drugs in \nBedroom 1 and the storeroom must  have been  brought to the Flat in Faizal\u2019s \ntrolley bag. In the 10th Statement, he claimed  that he first saw the diamorphine \nlaid out on the bed in the afternoon on 27 January 2016 when he quarrelled with \nMashitta, but did not explain  how they came to be laid out on the bed. When \nquestioned whether Sufian  was connected to the drugs  that Faizal brought to the \nFlat, Nabill stated that he did not know, and added  that he did not know  \u201cif \nSufian saw Faizal taking  the drugs out of the trolley bag\u201d.115 However, during  \nthe trial, Nabill  claimed  that the diamorphine  would have  been laid out on the \nbed by Sufian, and not Faizal, as Nabill did not see anything on the bed when \nhe checked Bedroom 1 after Faizal left the Flat on 26 January 2016 and Sufian  \nwas at home on  27 January 2016.116\n70 As can be seen, Nabill\u2019s story was evolving throughout the proceedings.  \nThis was incredibly damaging  to his credibility  and led me to question why he \nfelt compelled to concoct  a story about Danish  in the first place instead of \noffering at the earliest opportunity  the defence which he ultimately offered at \ntrial \u2013 namely that the diamorphine belonged  to either Faizal or to Sufian (who \n115 PB 453.\n116 16\/8\/18 NE 68.\n41\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Muhammad Nabill bin Mohd Fuad [2018]  SGHC  268\nallegedly placed it in Bedroom 1, having  possibly obtained it from  the trolley \nbag). I will return to the issue of Nabill\u2019s evolving defence in light of his \nstatements later (see [77]\u2013[82] below).\nNabill\u2019s account  that Sufian  had placed  the drugs on the bed in Bedroom 1\n71 Next, I rejected  Nabill\u2019s explanation that Sufian  had placed  the \ndiamorphine on the bed in Bedroom  1. The way that Nabill conducted himself \nupon discovering the drugs  was not as one would expect if he had innocently  \nfound such a large quantity of diamorphine in his Flat. He claimed  that he called \nSufian to come back to the Flat and clear \u201call the thing  inside [Bedroom 1]\u201d.117 \nStrangely, however, he did not ask Sufian why there were drugs (and so much \nof them) in the room and who had brought them  to the Flat. He agreed that he \ndid not even mention the word \u201cdrugs\u201d to Sufian. Nabill tried to explain that he \ndid not ask Sufian about the drugs because Sufian \u201csounded so innocent at that \npoint in time\u201d.118 I found  this unconvincing especially given that Sufian  was a \nknown drug user.119 Further, Nabill  did not produce any independent evidence \nto support his account  that Sufian had laid the diamorphine out on the bed before \nNabill chucked  it in the \u201cAkira\u201d box for Sufian to clear  it. He did not call \nMashitta to support  his account that he first found the diamorphine on the bed \nin Bedroom 1 at about  2pm on 27 January 2016 and then packed the drugs into \nthe \u201cAkira\u201d box after quarrelling with her, or call Sufian to support his phone \nconversation with  Sufian  after he discovered  the diamorphine. \n117 16\/8\/18 NE 76\u201377.\n118 16\/8\/18 NE 76.\n119 PB 471.\n42\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Muhammad Nabill bin Mohd Fuad [2018]  SGHC  268\nOther evidence\n72 There was also objective evidence that Nabill had been in contact  with \nsome packets of diamorphine, which supported a finding that he was in \npossession of it and knew the nature  of its contents as he was involved in \npacking it. \n73 Nabill\u2019s DNA was found on F1D3A, which comprised 10 mini packets \nof diamorphine which  were  packed into a larger ziplock bag (F1D3), which  was \nin turn found in a white  plastic bag (F1D) retrieved  from the \u201cAkira\u201d box.120 It \nmust be emphasised that there  were  multiple layers of external packaging, \nwhich made it very unlikely that Nabill\u2019s DNA could have been found on \nF1D3A by accidental touching. His DNA was also found on F1E3 (a ziplock  \nbag which  contained 10 mini packets of diamorphine (F1E3A)), which was \nfound in a white plastic  bag (F1E) retrieved from  the \u201cAkira\u201d box. There  was \nobjective evidence that the plastic bag used for F1D3A could have come from  \nthe same stock as J1A or J2A because the bags were manufactured by the same \nmachine (see [19] above),  and Nabill agreed  that F1D3A  came from  the same \nstock as J2A.121\n74 When asked how his DNA might have ended  up on F1D3A and F1E3, \nNabill explained that when he was quarrelling  with Mashitta, the diamorphine \nwas laid out on the bed in the form  of larger ziplock bags (eg, F1D1, F1D2, \nF1D3, F1E1,  F1E2 and F1E3) of 10 mini packets  each.122 After  the quarrel, he \npicked up these larger  ziplock  bags and placed  them into the \u201cAkira\u201d box. He \nstated that did not come into contact with the mini packets of diamorphine  found \n120 PB 203.\n121 16\/8\/18 NE 68.\n122 16\/8\/18 NE 64.\n43\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Muhammad Nabill bin Mohd Fuad [2018]  SGHC  268\nwithin the larger ziplock bags, including F1D3A. He suggested that his DNA  \nwas found on F1D3A as he used similar bags to pack his \u201cice\u201d, and speculated  \nthat Faizal or Sufian  could have obtained  plastic bags from the same  stock (ie, \nthe empty plastic bags in J1A or J2A) to pack  the diamorphine.123\n75 I rejected Nabill\u2019s  claim that he only came  into contact with the packets \nof diamorphine when  he was packing them  away  after the quarrel with Mashitta.  \nEven if it explained how he came into contact  with the exterior  surface of the \nlarger packets  (eg,  F1E3, on which his DNA  was found (see [15(a)] above))  it \ndoes not explain  why his DNA  was found on F1D3A, which was one of the mini \npackets enclosed within one such larger packet, F1D3 . I also rejected his \nassertion that Faizal or Sufian could have  used plastic bags from  J1A or J2A to \npack the drugs, and that since  \u201csome of\u201d J1A or J2A belonged to Nabill, his \nDNA could  have been found on the empty bag they used to pack F1D3A.124 This \nwas pure speculation. There was also no explanation why, on Nabill\u2019s \nspeculation, his DNA was transferred onto an empty  bag in the stock of empty \nplastic bags contained in J1A or J2A (which  were all neatly bundled and clearly \nnew and unused) before Faizal or Sufian supposedly used that same bag to pack  \nthe diamorphine. The better explanation is that Nabill\u2019s DNA  was found  on \nF1D3A because he  was involved in packing  it.\n76 I was also satisfied that Nabill  had been  in contact with the packet  of \ndiamorphine, G1A1, which was in a plastic bag (G1A) inside a \u201cMintek\u201d  bag \n(G1) which  was in turn found on the bed. Nabill\u2019s DNA was found on the \nexterior and interior surfaces of the plastic bag (G1A).125 Since G1A was found \n123 16\/8\/18 NE 38\u201340, 64, 79.\n124 16\/8\/18 NE 38\u201340.\n125 PB 185.\n44\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Muhammad Nabill bin Mohd Fuad [2018]  SGHC  268\ninside G1 which  was on the bed at the time of Nabill\u2019s arrest, Nabill would not \nhave come into contact with the surface of G1A when supposedly quarrelling \nwith Mashitta or when  putting the other packets of diamorphine into the \u201cAkira\u201d \nbox after the argument. Nabill had no explanation  of how G1A1 came  to be in \nBedroom 1. In the 1st Statement recorded at the time of his arrest,  he recognised \nG1A1 as heroin and said it belonged to Danish who would sell it. However, \nsince he later recanted  all his accounts relating to Danish, this explanation  (that \nG1A1 belonged  to Danish who would sell it) no longer holds water.  During the \ntrial, he testified that he could not recall if he had seen G1A.126 In my view,  the \nDNA evidence  is persuasive  that Nabill had handled G1A which  contained \nG1A1. While nothing turns  on this, I also note that Nabill\u2019s DNA  was found on \nthe exterior, handle, front  compartment and main compartment of the \u201cMintek\u201d \nbag.\nNabill\u2019s statements to CNB\n77 I turn now to Nabill\u2019s investigation statements.  As noted at [65]\u2013[70]  \nabove, Nabill\u2019s account was continually evolving, as should be apparent  from  \nmy summary of his statements at [25]\u2013[34] above. In my view,  this was \ndetrimental to Nabill\u2019s credibility. The question is whether he had any good \nexplanation for the changes in his account. Nabill explained that he had initially  \nimplicated Danish  in the first six statements  because  he was suffering from drug \nwithdrawal symptoms and was therefore confused,  fearful and not in the right \nstate of mind.127 He claimed that the drug withdrawal symptoms lasted for about \none week \u2013 presumably one week from  the time of his arrest, in which period \nall the first six statements were recorded.\n126 16\/8\/18 NE 64\u201365.\n127 16\/8\/18 NE 16.\n45\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Muhammad Nabill bin Mohd Fuad [2018]  SGHC  268\n78 In my judgment, Nabill failed to show that his state of mind was affected \nby drug withdrawal symptoms at the time when  he made the statements. On the \ncontrary, I found that Nabill had made each statement being aware  of what he \nwas saying  at the material time and had told deliberate untruths in the course of \ninvestigation. He did not give consistent evidence at the trial about his state of \nmind at the time of giving  the statements.  Overall, I found Nabill to be an \nuntruthful witness.  \n79 First, Nabill\u2019s stated reasons for having falsely implicated one Danish \n(which allegations he subsequently recanted  in his later investigation statements \nand at the trial) vacillated during  the course of the trial. In my view,  none of his \nstated reasons \u2013 apart  from his final admission that he had deliberately \nfabricated the account about Danish \u2013 were convincing.\n(a) Initially,  he explained that he was suffering from  drug \nwithdrawal symptoms  and was therefore confused, fearful and not in the \nright frame  of mind when  he gave  the statements implicating Danish.\n(b) Shortly after,  he stated  that he believed in the truth of the \nstatements when  he made them, ie, he sincerely  believed  at the time \nwhen he made the statements  that it was Danish who had brought the \ndrugs to the Flat.128 Thus, he claimed that he had not deliberately made \nfalse statements. He stated that from  the 7th Statement dated 23 May \n2016 onwards, he came  to believe that it was Faizal who had brought \nthe drugs  to the Flat, because Mashitta  (who had in turn been informed \nby the domestic  helper)  had told him that Faizal  brought the trolley bag. \nI found  this explanation entirely unconvincing. According to Nabill at \n128 16\/8\/18 NE 17\u201318.\n46\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Muhammad Nabill bin Mohd Fuad [2018]  SGHC  268\ntrial, he had already discovered prior to his arrest at around 4pm on 27 \nJanuary 2016 that Faizal had brought the trolley  bag to the Flat and that \nit was in the storeroom. Thus, there was no reason why he would have \nimplicated Danish in the first six statements  which were all recorded \nafter his arrest, and why he would change his position and implicate \nFaizal only from the 7th Statement when  he was supposedly prompted \nto change his original account because  of what Mashitta had allegedly \ntold him. Nabill\u2019s final account did not admit room for him to have \nsincerely believed,  at the time he made  the statements implicating \nDanish, that  Danish had brought the trolley bag  and drugs to the  Flat.\n(c) In cross-examination,  Nabill stated that he had given all his \nstatements voluntarily  and that he knew what he was saying when he \nmade those statements, which included  the statements implicating \nDanish.129 He was then pressed about  why he had to implicate an \ninnocent person even if he was shocked and not in the right frame of \nmind and \u201cfelt [he had] to give an answer\u201d.130 He replied that he had \ndeliberately implicated Danish because he knew from  Faizal that Danish \nwas the supplier  of the drugs that were found in Bedroom 1 and the \ntrolley bag.131 At the same time, he agreed  that he was not confused or \nin fear, and was not ignorant of what he was saying  when  he made the \nstatements implicating  Danish.  Nabill then adjusted his explanation  \u2013 he \nstated that after the CNB  allowed  him to call Danish,  he found out from \nDanish that the drugs belonged to Danish and Danish  also told him that \nhe had passed the drugs to Faizal.  That was why he deliberately \n129 16\/8\/18 NE 46.\n130 16\/8\/18 NE 87.\n131 16\/8\/18 NE 87.\n47\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Muhammad Nabill bin Mohd Fuad [2018]  SGHC  268\nimplicated Danish in the 1st Statement.132 I did not accept this \nexplanation. It was undisputed that the phone call was made to Danish \nonly after Nabill  had given  the 1st Statement.133 His claim that he learnt \nthat Danish  was Faizal\u2019s supplier during this call  was thus a  patent  lie. \n(d) Later during cross-examination,  Nabill  attempted to revert to his \nearlier claim that he had \u201cmistakenly mentioned\u201d Danish\u2019s name \nbecause he was suffering from drug withdrawal symptoms and was not \nin the right frame of mind.134 However,  when  questioned about specific \nparts of his statements, such as the details he furnished about how he \nmet Danish, he admitted that he had deliberately made up stories \nregarding Danish.135 When he was further questioned about specific  \nparts of his statements, Nabill changed  his stance again and said that he \nhad deliberately told untruths  in some parts of the statements and he was \n\u201ctalking nonsense\u201d  in other  parts  of the statements.136 But he then \nadmitted that the details  he furnished  about Danish had been deliberately \nconcocted.137\n80 It was clear, in my view, that Nabill had knowingly and deliberately  \nconcocted a story about Danish having brought the drugs to the Flat, and that he \nhad no good explanation for having done so. Nabill admitted that the statements \nmade shortly after his arrest were made voluntarily and he knew what  he was \nsaying in those statements.138 This included  the 4th Statement  (whereby he gave \n132 16\/8\/18 NE 88.\n133 16\/8\/18 NE 88\u201389; PB 110 (at S\/N  657).\n134 16\/8\/18 NE 92\u201394.\n135 16\/8\/18 NE 87, 92\u201395, 98\u201399.\n136 16\/8\/18 NE 106\u2013111.\n137 16\/8\/18 NE 113.\n48\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Muhammad Nabill bin Mohd Fuad [2018]  SGHC  268\na lengthy  account of his relationship with Danish) in which he stated  he had \ndeliberately concocted a story pertaining  to Danish based on what Faizal had \ntold him. Indeed, Nabill  must have been  aware of what he was alleging because, \nin line with his allegation  in the 1st Statement that the drugs belonged to Danish, \nhe made phone  calls (apparently) to Danish after his arrest in the presence of \nCNB officers.139 Furthermore, the account of Danish which he later recanted \nwas not bereft of details but was fairly  lengthy.  Clearly, despite any drug \nwithdrawal symptoms, Nabill had applied his mind to developing  an elaborate \naccount about Danish, yet all these details  were by his own admission untrue \nbecause he had never met Danish. 140 The inescapable conclusion was that Nabill \nhad deliberately told lies to the CNB. \n81 Second,  even if Nabill was suffering from  drug withdrawal symptoms  \nwhen the 1st to 6th Statements were recorded,  it was evident that these \nsymptoms were not the reason  why he had put forward his initial story about \nthe drugs belonging to Danish.  This was evident from the fact that Nabill  tried \nto maintain this story about Danish even after any purported drug withdrawal  \nsymptoms would have worn off. Dr Chua testified that any such symptoms \nwould last between two to seven days, and Nabill also agreed that any such \nsymptoms that he suffered  wore  off after about  seven days from his arrest.141 \n(a) Dr Kelvin Ng examined Nabill on 22 and 23 February and 4 \nMarch 2016 (see [23] above).142 Dr Ng stated that Nabill was able to give \n138 16\/8\/18 NE 46.\n139 16\/8\/18 NE 10\u201311, 88\u201389.\n140 PB 467\u2013471.\n141 15\/8\/18 NE 15; 16\/8\/18 NE 16, 102.\n142 PB 279\u2013283.\n49\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Muhammad Nabill bin Mohd Fuad [2018]  SGHC  268\na consistent account of what had occurred. At that time,  Nabill  continued  \nto refer to \u201cDhanesh\u201d which, he confirmed at the trial, was a reference  \nto Danish.143 He told Dr Ng about his relationship  with Dhanesh and how \nDhanesh had left the drugs in the Flat on the night of 26 January 2016. \nBy the time Dr Ng examined Nabill, any drug withdrawal symptoms \nwould have worn off. When he was asked why he nonetheless told Dr \nNg that Danish was responsible for the drugs in the Flat, Nabill could \nonly say that he could not recall what he  said to Dr Ng.144\n(b) In the 8th Statement  recorded  on 24 May 2016,  Nabill  was asked \nin what packaging  Danish supplied \u201cice\u201d to him, and he gave an \nintelligible description, implicitly continuing to maintain that Danish, \nrather than Faizal,  was his \u201cice\u201d supplier. It was only after he was shown \nthe CCTV footage  of Faizal  in the lift leading  up to the Flat on 26 \nJanuary 2016, and realising that the CCTV footage did not capture any \nimages of Danish, that Nabill then changed his evidence in the very same \nstatement to say that Danish had never been to his Flat. As I found at \n[68] earlier, Nabill changed his account to \u201cFaizal\u201d only when he \nrealised that his account  about Danish could not stand in the face of the \nobjective CCTV evidence. Indeed, Nabill admitted  that he began to \nattribute the drugs  to Faizal in the end because he had viewed the CCTV \nfootage, in that he had a \u201cbetter view on the CCTV\u201d footage.145 I found  \nthis explanation, that the CCTV footage helped him to clarify what \nhappened, to be utterly illogical and untrue. Details such as whether  \nNabill had ever met Danish, whether  Danish had ever been  to the Flat, \n143 16\/8\/18 NE 117.\n144 16\/8\/18 NE 117\u2013118.\n145 16\/8\/18 NE 100, 102; PB 452\u2013453.\n50\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Muhammad Nabill bin Mohd Fuad [2018]  SGHC  268\nwhether Danish had \u201cframed\u201d him with drugs and so on, were matters \nwithin Nabill\u2019s own experience  and knowledge,  and he would not have \nneeded the CCTV footage to realise that his account about Danish was \nfalse. Moreover,  if he knew \u2013 as he later testified  \u2013 before his arrest that \nFaizal had brought  a trolley bag to the Flat, he did not need  the CCTV \nfootage to  supply  him with  that knowledge.  \n82 Therefore, I found Nabill to be an untruthful and unreliable witness, who \nkept changing his story along the way. He clearly  knew, at the time he made \neach statement,  what he meant to say, and he had made up stories about Danish \nin his initial statements to hide the fact that he knew that Faizal had come  to the \nFlat on 26 January 2016 with a trolley  bag of drugs. I find he did so to \ndisassociate himself from  the drugs that were subsequently seized from  the Flat. \nSubmissions by the Defence\n83 Before  I conclude, I deal with various arguments raised by the Defence  \nwhich have not been dealt with above.\n84 First, the Defence  submitted that the CNB  failed to investigate other \npersons who may have been involved in the drug transactions, such as Mashitta,  \nSufian, Khairul  and Faizal.146 It was unclear  how this affected the Prosecution\u2019s \ncase against Nabill. The Defence did not dispute that multiple persons could be \ncharged for the same offence in relation  to the same transaction or the same  set \nof drugs.147 It did not dispute that Faizal  had in fact been investigated,  although \ncharges against him were  still pending.148 Ultimately,  the prerogative to charge \n146 Defence Closing  Submissions, para 38\u201339.\n147 16\/8\/18 NE 126.\n51\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Muhammad Nabill bin Mohd Fuad [2018]  SGHC  268\nany person  lies with the Public Prosecutor. In so far as the Defence  is alleging \nthat the drugs could  have \u201cbelonged\u201d to and been  intended for trafficking by \nany one of these other individuals, 149 my analysis will takes account  whether \nNabill possessed  the drugs  for the purpose of returning them  to any of these \nother individuals, or for the purpose of trafficking.  I also add that there is no \nrequirement to prove  ownership of the drugs for an offence under  s 5(1)( a) read \nwith s 5(2) of the  MDA to be  made  out.\n85 Next, the Defence  submitted that the Prosecution had refused to produce  \na statement taken  from  the domestic helper to show that she had allowed Faizal \nentry into the Flat on 26 January 2016 and that Faizal had brought the trolley  \nbag.150 Again this was immaterial and did not affect  my findings. I had found \nthat Faizal  was the one who brought the trolley  bag to the Flat, so the domestic \nhelper\u2019s evidence in this regard  would add nothing more. Even  if she had \nallowed Faizal into the Flat on 26 January  2016, this did not mean that Nabill \nwas unaware that Faizal had brought a trolley  bag containing drugs  that night. I \nhave explained my reasons for finding that Nabill knew that Faizal was bringing \na trolley bag to the Flat and that the trolley bag contained drugs, and the \nevidence of the domestic  helper would not impact  any of those  reasons. In fact, \nthe Defence chose not to call witnesses who could have  supported Nabill\u2019s \nversion of events, namely Mashitta, Faizal  and Sufian (whom Nabill claimed \nhad laid out the drugs in Bedroom 1 and whom Nabill called subsequently to \nask him to clear the  things). \n148 16\/8\/18 NE 124.\n149 Defence Closing  Submissions, para 40.\n150 Defence Closing  Submissions, para 46.\n52\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Muhammad Nabill bin Mohd Fuad [2018]  SGHC  268\n86 Next, the Defence submitted that the Prosecution should have  disclosed \nstatements recorded from  Mashitta, Faizal  and Sufian because these statements \ncould have been advantageous to the defence.  I rejected this submission. Under \ns 259 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap  68, 2012 Rev Ed), any statement \nmade by a person (other than the accused)  in the course of any investigation  is \ninadmissible in evidence unless it falls within  an exception listed  in s 259(a) to \n(e). The Defence  did not identify which exception applied, and why it would \napply, such that these statements if disclosed  could be admitted at the trial. The \nProsecution\u2019s disclosure obligations as set out in Muhammad bin Kadar and \nanother v Public Prosecutor [2011]  3 SLR 1205 (\u201cKadar No 1\u201d) are not affected \nby the operation of any ground for non-disclosure  recognised by any law (see \nMuhammad bin Kadar and another v Public Prosecutor and another matter \n[2011] 4 SLR 791 at [18]). In any event,  the Defence also did not attempt to \nshow how these statements,  even  if inadmissible under  s 259, could have fallen  \nwithin the Prosecution\u2019s obligations to disclose \u201cany unused  material  that is \nlikely to be inadmissible,  but would provide  a real (not fanciful) chance of \npursuing a line of inquiry that leads to material that is likely to be admissible \nand that might reasonably  be regarded as credible and relevant to the guilt or \ninnocence of the accused\u201d (Kadar No 1 at [113]). If the Defence could  have \nbenefitted from the evidence  of Mashitta, Sufian or Faizal, it could also have \ncalled them as witnesses but chose  not to. \n87 Finally, the Defence suggested that Sufian could have been connected  \nto the drugs found in the Flat because  the CCTV footage  showed  him carrying \na red packet that was similar in appearance to G1B and G1C when he was in the \nlift heading down from the floor  where the Flat was at around 6.33am on 26 \nJanuary 2016.  He was no longer carrying this packet when he was seen again in \nthe lift, going  up to the floor where  the Flat was at around 6.57am.151 The \n53\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Muhammad Nabill bin Mohd Fuad [2018]  SGHC  268\nDefence claimed that Sufian could  have  been carrying out transactions \ninvolving the red packets.152 The drugs  in G1B and G1C did not form the subject  \nof the charges against  Nabill (even  if Sufian  were in some way connected  to \nthose drugs),  and the drugs which Nabill  was charged with trafficking were \npackaged in a different manner.  In any event,  Sufian\u2019s role, if any, would not \naffect my findings as regards Nabill because  Nabill\u2019s involvement in the drugs  \nfound in Flat was not precluded  by Sufian\u2019s (even  if proved). \nConclusion\n88 In conclusion, I was satisfied that the Prosecution  had proved  its case \nbeyond a reasonable doubt that Nabill had actual  possession of the drugs (ie, the \ndiamorphine in Bedroom  1 and the cannabis in the trolley bag) and knew the \nnature of these drugs. I was further satisfied that the Prosecution  was able to \nrely on the presumption  in s 17 of the MDA that Nabill was in possession of the \ndrugs for the purposes of trafficking since the quantities  of both types  of drugs \nexceeded the amounts specified in s 17, and found that Nabill  failed to rebut this \npresumption on the  balance of probabilities.  I summarise below my  findings.\n89 First, as regards  the element of possession, since Nabill had physical  \ncontrol of the Flat, the \u201cAkira\u201d box, the \u201cMintek\u201d  bag and the trolley bag, the \nlatter three of which contained the drugs in question, I was entitled to infer that \nNabill had knowledge  of the existence of the drugs in each of these  receptacles  \n(Zainal  at [16]). It was incumbent  on him to show why, despite his physical  \ncontrol of them,  he \u201creasonably  ought not to be taken to be in possession of \n[their] contents\u201d  (see Zainal at [17]). \n151 15\/8\/18 NE 105\u2013106.\n152 Defence Closing  Submissions, para 41.\n54\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Muhammad Nabill bin Mohd Fuad [2018]  SGHC  268\n(a) In relation to the diamorphine, I found that Nabill was in \npossession of the diamorphine  (G1A1)  found in the \u201cMintek\u201d bag \nbecause it was found in his control  and his DNA was found on exhibit \nG1A. As for the 63 packets of diamorphine in the \u201cAkira\u201d box, Nabill \nby his own account knew  that they were in the \u201cAkira\u201d box because, \naccording to him, he had placed them there after the alleged quarrel with \nMashitta. The fact that I have rejected his account means that Nabill by \nhis own admission knew,  prior to his arrest, that there  was diamorphine \nin the \u201cAkira\u201d box, but had furnished  no credible  reason why it was \nthere. I rejected  his explanation that Sufian or Faizal  was responsible  for \nplacing the diamorphine  in Bedroom  1 because  his account was \ndiscredited on many  fronts. Even  if Faizal had placed the diamorphine  \nin Bedroom 1 on the night of 26 January 2016, I found that Nabill would \nhave known of this and would have  had agreed  to it. This is because  I \nhave found that Nabill knew that Faizal  was bringing a trolley bag to the \nFlat on 26 January  2016 and knew what it contained. Either way,  Nabill  \nhad no credible explanation for why he ought not to be taken to be in \npossession of them. I was thus satisfied  he had actual possession of \nthem. \n(b) As for the cannabis, even by Nabill\u2019s account, he was aware of \nthe presence  of the trolley bag and that it contained something which  \nturned out to be the cannabis. He claimed to have  discovered the trolley \nbag at about 4pm on 27 January 2016, and immediately  called Faizal  \nabout it. In any event, I rejected Nabill\u2019s account that he did not know  \nthat Faizal had brought  the trolley bag containing  drugs to the Flat, and \nI found that Nabill  knew that Faizal  was bringing something to the Flat \nin the trolley  bag and that he had agreed to it. He therefore had physical \ncontrol of the cannabis in the trolley  bag and the requisite  knowledge \n55\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Muhammad Nabill bin Mohd Fuad [2018]  SGHC  268\nthat the trolley bag contained something which  was later discovered  to \nbe the cannabis. \n90 Second,  as regards  the element of knowledge, I found that Nabill knew \nthe nature of the drugs in the Flat, specifically that the drugs in Bedroom 1 which  \nformed the subject  of the 1st Charge were diamorphine and that the drugs  found \nin the trolley bag which formed  the subject of the  2nd Charge  were  cannabis.\n(a) In relation to the diamorphine, Nabill on his own account had \nseen the diamorphine  contained in F1A, F1B,  F1C,  F1D and F1E laid \nout on the bed before his arrest and recognised them as diamorphine.  In \nrelation to G1A1,  I found  that Nabill  had been in contact with that packet \nand would have  known it to contain  diamorphine (as evident in the 1st \nStatement where  he was able to identify the content  of G1A1). Actual  \nknowledge was therefore  proved.\n(b) As for the cannabis, I rejected  Nabill\u2019s  evidence that he thought \nthe trolley  bag contained  cigarettes and his account of how the trolley \nbag was brought to the Flat without his knowledge  or consent. I found \nthat he knew that Faizal was bringing drugs in the trolley bag to the Flat \non 26 January 2016. Even by his own account, Nabill knew by around \n4pm on 27 January 2016 of the trolley bag in the storeroom and knew or \nsuspected at that time that it contained drugs. The evidence as a whole, \nincluding my findings that Nabill was expecting and involved in the \ndelivery of the drugs by Faizal and told deliberate lies to the CNB  and \nto this court  to conceal his involvement with the drugs in the trolley bag, \nlead to a strong inference  that Nabill knew the precise nature of the drugs \nthat Faizal was bringing to the Flat in the trolley  bag. \n56\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Muhammad Nabill bin Mohd Fuad [2018]  SGHC  268\n91 Third, on the element that the possession of the drugs was for the \npurpose of trafficking, I found that Nabill failed  to rebut the presumption of \ntrafficking in s 17 such that he possessed the drugs  for some  other purpose. \nNabill\u2019s case was that the drugs were in his possession for Faizal  or Sufian to \nretrieve them, and that he was wholly uninvolved in the procurement  or intended \ntrafficking of these drugs. His evidence  as to the intended purpose of the drugs  \nwas therefore  inextricably linked to his wider  story about how the drugs  came \nto be found in the Flat without his knowledge  or consent. For the reasons above, \nI rejected  his evidence about how the drugs came to be found in the Flat, and \naccordingly rejected his evidence that he had no purpose for the drugs  apart \nfrom storing them  for Faizal or Sufian\u2019s retrieval. Nabill  also did not put \nforward a defence  that the drugs were intended  for his personal consumption.  \nFurthermore, a large  quantity of diamorphine and cannabis was in his \npossession \u2013 more than four times the amount of diamorphine at which capital \npunishment would be imposed, and more  than twice  the amount  of cannabis at \nwhich capital punishment would be imposed. \n92 On the Prosecution\u2019s  alternative  case,  I was also satisfied that the \npresumptions under ss 18(1) and 18(2) of the MDA were  engaged. It was \nundisputed that Nabill  and Mashitta owned the Flat and that Nabill  was residing \nat the Flat and had the keys to, and control  of, the Flat, including Bedroom 1 \nand the storeroom.  As regards the \u201cAkira\u201d box specifically, it was not disputed \nthat it belonged to Nabill.  It was thus clear that the \u201cAkira\u201d box, the \u201cMintek\u201d \nbag and trolley bag were also in his possession,  custody or control at the material \ntime. To rebut the presumptions, Nabil had to show on a balance of probabilities \nthat he did not have the drugs in his possession because he did not know  that \nthe various receptacles or places contained a controlled drug and that he did not \nknow or could  not reasonably be expected  to have known the nature  of the drug \n57\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Muhammad Nabill bin Mohd Fuad [2018]  SGHC  268\n(see Dinesh Pillai a\/l K Raja Retnam v Public Prosecutor [2012] 2 SLR 903 at \n[16]\u2013[17]; Obeng Comfort v Public  Prosecutor [2017] 1 SLR 633 at [34]\u2013[35]). \nFor the reasons given earlier (see also [89]\u2013[90] above), I found that Nabill  \nfailed on a balance of probabilities to rebut  the presumptions of possession and \nknowledge. \n93 Turning to the element of trafficking, even  without the presumption of \ntrafficking under s 17 of the MDA, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had \nproved beyond  a reasonable doubt that Nabill possessed the drugs in question \nfor the purposes of trafficking. The court  is entitled  to infer the drugs were  in \nthe possession of an accused for the purpose  of trafficking on the basis of \nevidence such as the quantity of drugs, the presence of drug trafficking \nparaphernalia, the absence of evidence  that the drugs were  for his personal  \nconsumption and other  circumstantial evidence substantiating  a finding that he \nwas involved in drug trafficking (see, eg, Raman  Selvam s\/o Renganathan v \nPublic Prosecutor  [2004] 1 SLR(R) 550 at [48];  Abdul Kahar  bin Othman  v \nPublic Prosecutor [2016]  SGCA 11 at [92]). In the present case, the evidence \npointed towards  Nabill being involved in trafficking the drugs  found in his \npossession.\n94 As stated above, I rejected  Nabill\u2019s evidence that he intended to return \nthe drugs to Faizal or Sufian. The sheer quantity  of the drugs (as stated at [91] \nabove) made an inference  of trafficking  irresistible.  It was not Nabill\u2019s case that \nthe drugs  were  intended for his personal  consumption and, as I had rejected his \nevidence that he had nothing to do with how the drugs came to be found in the \nFlat, I thus found that they were  stored there for the purposes of trafficking.  \nNabill also did not deny that four weighing  scales  (H1B, H1C, F1H and F1G4) \nwere in his possession and were used by him (though  he claimed  that his use \nwas limited  to ascertaining the weight of the \u201cice\u201d  he obtained  for his own \n58\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Muhammad Nabill bin Mohd Fuad [2018]  SGHC  268\nconsumption).153 Moreover, the fact that Nabill\u2019s DNA  was found on one of the \nmini packets of diamorphine (F1D3A) showed that he was involved in packing  \nthe mini packets. Finally, his attempts to distance himself  from  the drugs  \nthrough the fabrication of elaborate accounts showed that he was concerned to \nconceal his  involvement. \n95 In sum, I rejected Nabill\u2019s defence in its entirety and found his evidence \nunreliable, incredible and inconsistent with the objective evidence. I found  that \non either of the Prosecution\u2019s  alternative cases  the elements of the 1st and 2nd \nCharges against Nabill  had been  proved  beyond a reasonable doubt.  \nAccordingly, I convicted  Nabill on the charges.\nDecision on sentence\n96 Given  the amount  of drugs, the prescribed  punishment under s 33(1) of \nthe MDA,  read with the Second Schedule  to the MDA, is death. However, s 33B \nof the MDA confers on the court  the discretion  to impose  the alternative \nsentence of life imprisonment and the mandatory minimum 15 strokes  of the \ncane, provided  the offender  satisfies  the requirements in s 33(B)(2)(a) of the \nMDA and receives a certificate of substantive assistance from  the Public \nProsecutor. The accused  bears the legal burden of proving,  on a balance of \nprobabilities, that his involvement in a drug trafficking offence was restricted \nonly to the activities of a courier as listed in s 33B(2)(a) of the MDA  (see \nZainudin bin Mohamed v  Public Prosecutor [2018] 1 SLR 449 at  [34]).\n97 In the present  case, the Prosecution submitted that Nabill failed  to show \nthat his involvement was restricted only to the activities listed under  s 33B(2)(a) \nof the MDA. I agreed with the Prosecution\u2019s  submission because Nabill,  having \n153 16\/8\/18 NE 85.\n59\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Muhammad Nabill bin Mohd Fuad [2018]  SGHC  268\nrun a defence that he was unconnected  to the drugs found in the Flat, had not \nadduced any evidence to show  that his involvement was limited to that of a \ncourier, and the Defence had also not suggested that Nabill  was a courier.154 In \nany event, the Prosecution did not issue a certificate of substantive assistance. \nAccordingly, I imposed the mandatory  sentence of death on Nabill.\nAudrey LimJudicial Commissioner\nLau Wing Yum and Chan  Yi Cheng   (Attorney-General\u2019s Chambers) \nfor the Prosecution;\nHassan  Esa Almenoar  (R Ramason &  Almenoar)  and Sheik Umar bin \nMohamed Bagushair (Wong & Leow LLC) for  the accused. \n154 5\/11\/18 NE 6.\n60\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)"}

I therefore set out only the essential facts in this appeal.', '', '6\\u2003The appellant was involved in a police impersonation scam. It is helpful first to set out how these scams work. The scam in this case comprised four main steps, and involved three sets of people.', '7\\u2003The first set of people are the victims. Unknown persons impersonating the Singapore Police or Interpol called six victims and cheated them into revealing their bank account login credentials. These unknown persons then used these credentials to access the victims\u2019 bank accounts and transfer monies to certain other bank accounts. The victims ranged from 50 years of age to 82 years of age. This comprised the first step of the scam.', '8\\u2003The victims\u2019 monies were transferred to bank accounts belonging to the second set of people. These persons were not members of the syndicate, but instead had also been duped by persons impersonating the police into releasing their bank account details to persons acting on behalf of the syndicate, thus allowing monies to be transferred to their accounts by the victims. They may colloquially be known as \u201cvictim-mules\u201d. There were five victim-mules in this case, whose ages ranged from 28 years of age to 61 years of age. The victim-mules received the victims\u2019 monies in their bank accounts and held on to the monies until they received further instructions. This comprised the second step of the scam.', '9\\u2003At the third step of the scam, the victim-mules were instructed by unknown individuals claiming to be from the police to withdraw cash from their bank accounts corresponding to the amount of money transferred into their bank account by the victims, and pass the cash to runners acting for the syndicate behind the scam. The victim-mules were not made to withdraw their own monies. To be clear, the runners would physically meet the victim-mules to', 'collect the cash; no monies were wired between bank accounts. The third set of people, the runners, therefore came into the picture at this third step.', '10\\u2003At the fourth step of the scam, the runners who met with the victim-mules would pass the cash on to other runners who would carry the monies out of Singapore, presumably back to the syndicate in Taiwan.', '11\\u2003I now flesh out the details of the appellant\u2019s involvement in this scam. Sometime in June 2017, in Taiwan, the appellant was approached by an unknown person to work for him. The job offered was for the appellant to go to Singapore and collect and hand over \u201cdocuments\u201d. He would be paid NT$60,000, or approximately S$2,700, for this job. No time period for the job is specified in the Statement of Facts.', '12\\u2003The appellant accepted this job offer, and came to Singapore on 21 June 2017. He arrived with a co-accused, one Chen Peng-Yu (\u201cPeng-Yu\u201d), also a male Taiwanese national. Other persons involved with the syndicate, besides the appellant and Peng-Yu, included Li Li, Hsieh Teng-Chia, and Long Say Piaw.', '13\\u2003The appellant carried out his first collection of \u201cdocuments\u201d on 22 June 2017. The appellant was instructed by Peng-Yu to collect \u201cdocuments\u201d from one victim-mule, who had had S$50,000 deposited into her account by one of the victims. The appellant met the victim-mule and collected that S$50,000. From this first collection of \u201cdocuments\u201d, the appellant realised the documents were actually monies. The appellant then passed the monies to another co-accused, Li Li. I shall refer to this sequence of events as the \u201cfirst incident\u201d.', '14\\u2003The appellant was involved in 12 other such incidents which generally mirrored the sequence of events in the first incident. The amounts of money, the identities of the victim-mules, and the identities of the other runners the appellant interacted with differed, but the general modus operandi employed in each incident was the same. The appellant was therefore always the runner who came into the picture at the third step in the general scheme of the scam I described above at [7] to [10].', '15\\u2003The appellant was involved in a total of 13 incidents over approximately two weeks. The first incident took place on 22 June 2017, and the last, on 6 July 2017. It suffices to note at this point that the total amount of money that passed through the appellant\u2019s hands was S$957,000. The amounts the victims were individually cheated of ranged between S$10,000 in the case of a 72-year-old female Chinese national, and S$650,000 in the case of an 82-year-old male Singapore citizen. Only S$1,050 was ultimately recovered by the police.'"}

As an adjournment was needed for these creditors to file the necessary papers for substitution of plaintiff, the Defendant requested a six-week adjournment so that it could settle with as many creditors as possible. As no creditors objected to a six-week adjournment and as the Official Receiver\u2019s representative indicated that it would be good to give the Defendant some time to negotiate with the creditors, I granted a six-week adjournment.', '19\\u2003At the hearing on 6 November 2017, I granted Prospaq Group\u2019s application to be substituted as plaintiff in place of Eltraco Roofing. The Defendant produced an affidavit from Li AnQuan informing the court that:', '(a)\\u2003he had been in negotiations with one Mr Toh Soon Hock (\u201cMr Toh\u201d) for the latter to buy 80% of the former\u2019s shares in the Defendant for a sum of $3 million;', '(b)\\u2003he would apply the $3 million to assist the Defendant in repaying its debts to its creditors;', '(c)\\u2003a letter of intent for the share purchase had been signed on 1 November 2017;', '(d)\\u2003under its terms, Mr Toh would make an upfront payment of $500,000 to Li AnQuan by 7 November 2017;', '(e)\\u2003Li AnQuan planned to put the Defendant into funds by transferring the said $500,000 into the Defendant\u2019s bank account.', '(f)\\u2003the share purchase was due to complete on 8 January 2018.', 'The Defendant sought a six-week adjournment. As no creditors objected, I granted the adjournment sought.', '20\\u2003At the hearing on 18 December 2017, Prospaq Group sought a three-week adjournment to allow it to find a private liquidator, as the Official Receiver had declined to act as liquidator. The Defendant asked if a six-week adjournment could be granted instead, so as to allow the Defendant to close the deal with Mr Toh and settle all outstanding claims. Prospaq Group objected to a six-week adjournment. It pointed out that, despite the claim in Li AnQuan\u2019s affidavit of 6 November 2017 that Mr Toh would make an upfront payment of $500,000 by 7 November 2017, there was no sign of the money. As no creditors spoke in favour of a six-week adjournment, I granted a four-week adjournment.', '21\\u2003At the hearing on Monday 15 January 2018, Prospaq Group indicated that it wished to proceed with the winding up application. The Defendant requested a short adjournment, explaining that:', '(a)\\u2003it was expecting a progress payment of $250,000 that afternoon from one of its ongoing project; and', '(b)\\u2003in anticipation of the receipt of this payment, it had made a settlement proposal to Prospaq Group.', 'Prospaq Group pointed out that the Defendant\u2019s offer was made only on the previous Friday (ie, one working day before the hearing) even though the Defendant had almost a month since the last hearing to do so. Prospaq Group was not willing to accept the offer as it was not for the full settlement of the Judgment Debt.', '22\\u2003At this point Mr Dhanwant Singh of S K Kumar Law Practice LLP stood up to address the court as counsel for Li AnQuan. Prospaq Group objected to Mr Dhanwant Singh\u2019s standing to address the court, as Li AnQuan had not filed a notice of intention to appear. Considering that Li AnQuan was both a creditor and a contributory of the Defendant, I decided to waive the requirement of notice of intention to appear and hear Mr Dhanwant Singh out. Mr Dhanwant Singh\u2019s proposal was for a short adjournment to be granted so that a meeting of the Defendant\u2019s creditors could be convened to decide how best to proceed. This proposal received no traction with the creditors present.', '23\\u2003Noting that the anticipated receipt of $250,000 exceeded the Judgment Debt of $206,647.80, I stood down the matter for 45 minutes to allow parties time for further discussions.', '24\\u2003When the hearing resumed, the Defendant informed that it was offering to settle the Judgment Sum in full, but in two tranches - $150,000 immediately and the remainder by 15 February 2018. Prospaq Group\u2019s position remained that it wished to proceed with the winding up application unless there was full settlement of the Judgment Debt on 15 January 2018.', '25\\u2003The Defendant explained that as it had ongoing projects under which it was receiving progress payments of $150,000 to $200,000 a month, it needed funds to pay for the operating expenses to keep these projects going. That was why the Defendant could not immediately pay off the entire Judgement Debt from the $250,000 progress payment it was receiving that day.', '26\\u2003Among the supporting creditors, Kurihara Kogyo opposed an adjournment, JRP & Associates indicated that it did not object to an adjournment while counsel for the remaining creditors indicated that they had no instructions on the proposed adjournment.', '27\\u2003As for the proposed sale of shares to Mr Toh, which was due for completion by 8 January 2018, the Defendant explained that completion was delayed as Mr Toh was still undergoing his due diligence exercise, including inquiries into the winding up applications against the Defendant.

The plaintiff \nis Indian  Ocean  Group Pte Ltd (\u201cIOGPL\u201d)  and the defendant is Gouri. In this \naction, IOGPL is suing  Gouri to recover a loan purportedly made to Gouri by \nIOEL in 2012.  According  to IOGPL, it has the right to sue; having assumed the \nrights and liabilities of IOEL. The loan amount is said to be around US$1.6m. \nGouri denies the loan. IOGPL\u2019s title to sue is also disputed.\n7 Pursuant to an Order of Court dated 29 August 2017, both actions  were \nlisted for hearing before  this court and Suit 417\/2017 proceeded immediately  \nafter Suit 1270\/2014. In Suit 1270\/2014, the Mukherjees are represented by \ncounsel, Mr Eddee Ng (\u201cMr  Ng\u201d),  and counsel  for Pradeepto is Mr Liew Teck \n1 DCS, para 18.\nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nSabyasachi Mukherjee v \nPradeepto Kumar  Biswas [2018]  SGHC  271\n5Huat (\u201cMr Liew\u201d). Mr Liew also represents IOGPL  in Suit 417\/2017 and \nGouri\u2019s counsel  is Mr Ng. \n8 In relation to Suit 1270\/2014, the discussions will focus  on the question \nof what obligations Pradeepto  owed  the Mukherjees  with reference  to the \nvarious causes of action in the pleadings.  This judgment will also discuss \nwhether Pradeepto practiced deceit on the Mukherjees in relation to five \ninvestments and whether a trust ought to be imposed in the present \ncircumstances. In relation to Suit 417\/2017, the central  question is whether  the \npurported loan is indeed a loan to Gouri or whether the flow of funds was merely \npursuant to Gouri\u2019s  instructions to have Pradeepto transfer the Mukherjees\u2019  \nfunds from one account  to another. \n9 It is appropriate to explain at the outset that there is some duplication in \nthe parties\u2019  treatment of related  issues  even though  they are brought  under \ndifferent causes of action.  Many arguments  advanced before this court that are \nperipheral will not be discussed at all in this judgment  unless they are relevant  \nin that they would shed light upon the central issues to be resolved.  The \napproach taken  in this judgment is to discuss factual issues,  and to make \nfindings upon  them that this court considers are important to resolve the central \nissues in the respective actions. The same  approach is adopted  in respect of the \nmany authorities  cited by the parties. \n10 This judgment is the court\u2019s decision in respect  of Suit 1270\/2014  and \nSuit 417\/2017.  I will deal with Suit 1270\/2014 first.\nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nSabyasachi Mukherjee v \nPradeepto Kumar  Biswas [2018]  SGHC  271\n6Suit 1270\/2014\nOverview of Suit 1270\/2014\n11 Before  dealing with the central issues in this action,  I should say \nsomething by way of an overview. It is important to keep in mind that the parties \nhad known  each other  for over ten years  and the Mukherjees have not disputed \nPradeepto\u2019s testimony that over the same period of time, there were  as many as \n700 investments that went through Pradeepto,  and that by and large,  the \nMukherjees had made money on most of their investments. Against this \nbackground of hundreds of prior  investments, an obvious difficulty with this \ncase is that the parties\u2019  oral testimony in court was based  on the recollection of \nevents that occurred several years  ago. What the witnesses recall of particular  \nconversations and events, with passage  of time, can be unreliable and the truth \nof the evidence becomes  more difficult  to gauge. It is better  to base factual \nfindings on inferences drawn for the contemporaneous documentary  evidence, \nif any, and known or probable facts.  In this vein, a number of the factual issues  \nwere matters within  Pradeepto\u2019s knowledge. While the legal burden of having \nto prove their claims  lie on the Mukherjees  throughout, where the Mukherjees  \nhave sufficiently established their prima facie case, the evidential burden of \nproof shifts to Pradeepto  to rebut  the Mukherjees  (see Gimpex Ltd v Unity \nHoldings Business Ltd and other and another"}

The Bugis Cube investment involved acquiring an old commercial complex at 470 North Bridge Road, Singapore 188735 (then known as the North Bridge Commercial Complex), redeveloping it into a new shopping mall and selling it. The Big Hotel investment involved acquiring an old commercial building at 200 Middle Road, Singapore 188980 (then known as the Prime Centre), redeveloping it into a mid-range hotel and selling it. In this judgment, I will use the terms \u201cthe Bugis Cube\u201d and \u201cthe Big Hotel\u201d to refer to the respective properties both before and after the redevelopment of each property.', '5\\u2003Andy Ong set up a complex structure using special purpose vehicles (\u201cSPVs\u201d) to hold (directly or indirectly) the investment in each property. GREIH and ERCU were two of these SPVs. Another company, ERC Holdings Pte Ltd (\u201cERC Holdings\u201d) was set up as the ultimate holding company of the SPVs.', '6\\u2003GREIH was the SPV that was used to acquire the Bugis Cube. Sakae Holdings Ltd (\u201cSakae\u201d) was one of the shareholders of GREIH. Subsequently, in November 2010, ERCU acquired the Big Hotel at a purchase price of $103m. 1', 'On 17 January 2011, ERCU obtained a loan from the United Overseas Bank Limited (\u201cUOB\u201d) for $77.25m to fund part of the purchase price for the Big Hotel (\u201cthe UOB-ERCU Loan\u201d). 2', 'The UOB-ERCU Loan was secured by a mortgage over the Big Hotel and by guarantees given by Andy Ong and ERC Holdings.

The respondent was a private banker. The pair quickly became good friends and it was not unusual for them to confide in each other about difficulties with their work, relationships and families. From their WhatsApp exchanges which had been put into evidence, one could see that a regular topic of conversation was how they wished they had more money.', '3\\u2003Sometime in 2013, the respondent told the appellant that she had a client for whom she was raising funds. The appellant agreed to participate and transferred to the respondent S$50,000 to be placed in a fixed deposit account which would yield an 8% interest per annum. The amount was eventually repaid to the appellant with interest. The appellant also lent the respondent S$15,000 in August 2014 when the latter needed money urgently to pay for the down payment for an apartment in Sydney. The respondent returned the sum in October 2014.', '4\\u2003The parties kept in regular, and sometimes almost daily, contact through WhatsApp exchanges and telephone calls.

The topic turned to the appellant\u2019s woes about money. Just after midnight, the appellant asked the respondent how much one could make trading on the foreign currency exchange market with a capital amount of S$100,000. The pair followed up the conversation with a phone call not long after 1 am on 8 October 2014.', '5\\u2003The content of that telephone conversation is at the heart of this dispute. The appellant claims that they had agreed to fairly detailed terms as to the money she was entrusting to the respondent to invest, including terms as to the return on her investment, the respondent\u2019s share of any return, and that the respondent would guarantee her capital from any loss. On the contrary, the respondent claims that all that was agreed was that she would try to help the appellant make some money from margin trading in foreign currencies, and that this was after she had warned the appellant about the risks involved in foreign currency trading.', '6\\u2003What is undisputed is that the parties followed up their WhatsApp exchange the next day with more messages referring to the appellant\u2019s father having agreed to give the appellant S$100,000. From the messages exchanged from October 2014 to March 2015, it would appear that the appellant consistently told the respondent that she had lied to her father about placing a sum of S$100,000 in a fixed deposit account which would yield 2-3% interest. Instead, the appellant\u2019s plan was to place the sum with the respondent for the respondent to do margin trading in foreign currencies on her behalf to \u201cmake [a] quick buck\u201d. 1', 'It also appears that the appellant had told her father that the sum would have to be placed in the fixed deposit account for at least a year and could not be withdrawn before that.', '7\\u2003 The respondent used her own account with Saxo Trader to carry out her margin trading in foreign currencies. Although the sum transferred to the respondent was initially S$100,000, it is undisputed that the appellant eventually transferred a total of S$210,000 to the respondent for the purpose of margin trading. What had happened was that the respondent took a position on the Australian dollar with the initial sum of S$100,000. But when the value of the Australian dollar fell, the appellant transferred another S$110,000 to the respondent for margin top-ups in the hopes that the Australian dollar would rebound. Unfortunately, the Australian dollar continued to perform poorly and the positions taken by the respondent were all closed out in December 2014. The entire amount transferred by the appellant was lost. Apparently, the respondent herself lost about S$700,000 on these trades.', '8\\u2003The parties subsequently fell out in March 2015 after the appellant demanded that the respondent repay her the sums that she had transferred to the respondent for the purpose of the margin trading.'"}

{"casename":"2018_SGHC_277","fact":"'4\\u2003The dispute between the parties concerns construction work carried out in relation to the Marina Bay MRT Station, which is a part of the Thomson MRT Line.', '5\\u2003The main contractor for the Marina Bay MRT Station was Taisei Corporation (\u201cTaisei\u201d), a Japanese company. In 2015, Taisei appointed Kori as its sub-contractor for construction work at the Marina Bay MRT Station. Kori was required by the sub-contract to supply, fabricate, lease and remove temporary walers, struts, utilities supports and kingposts and to undertake ancillary works.', '6\\u2003Under its sub-contract with Taisei, Kori was entitled to employ sub-sub-contractors to perform its contractual obligations. Kori entered into two contracts with PPE. The first contract was a \u201cManpower Contract\u201d for the supply of manpower to Kori for construction work. The second was a \u201cFabrication Contract\u201d for the fabrication of steel materials required by Kori to fulfil its contractual obligations to Taisei.', '7\\u2003The terms of the Manpower Contract are partly set out in the former\u2019s quotation dated 30 March 2015 and in Kori\u2019s Purchase Order dated 25 September 2015. The agreed rates of payment for manpower provided by PPE were $11.50 per hour for welders and fitters, $9.50 per hour for riggers and signalmen and $9.00 per hour for general workers. Not all the workmen supplied to Kori by PPE under the Manpower Contract were its own workers. A number of the said workers were supplied to PPE by another company, Sha Engineering & Contractors Pte Ltd (\u201cSha Engineering\u201d), which is managed by Kori\u2019s own employee, Mr Nallusamy Ramados (\u201cMr Ramados\u201d). Kori claimed that it was unaware until after the commencement of the present action that some of the workers supplied under the Manpower Contract had in fact been supplied by its own employee.', '8\\u2003Disputes arose between the parties regarding payments due to PPE under the Manpower Contract. Kori blamed PPE for discrepancies in the names of workers supplied to it and for charging it twice for the same workers or at higher rates than those provided in the Manpower Contract. It also complained that PPE had not given it sufficient information on whether or not the workers supplied to it under the said contract were legally permitted to work in Singapore. The differences between the parties in relation to claims under the Manpower Contract formed an important part of PPE\u2019s claim in this action.', '9\\u2003The second contract (\u201cFabrication Contract\u201d), which concerned steel fabrication work to be done by PPE, is evidenced by Kori\u2019s Letter of Award dated 21 October 2015 to PPE. The scope of work under this contract involved fabrication, loading and unloading in relation to steel strutting works. It was agreed that Kori would pay PPE at the rate of $350 per metric tonne for main members fabricated by the latter and that all accessories, as shown in the construction drawings, were deemed to be inclusive.', '10\\u2003Under cl 5 of the Fabrication Contract, PPE was required to submit progressive claims monthly to Kori for the latter\u2019s verification and certification. Clause 5 of the said contract required Kori to pay PPE within 45 days of the certification. PPE did not follow the procedure and Kori issued interim payment certificates as and when a stack of so-called \u201cdelivery orders\u201d were received from the former. Although the claim documents submitted by PPE to Kori for verification and certification were described as \u201cdelivery orders\u201d, these documents did not record the actual delivery of fabricated steel materials to Kori and none of them contained any acknowledgement of delivery of the said goods. As such, PPE\u2019s delivery orders are not to be confused with the usual delivery orders. As there was no contemporaneous verification of the actual quantity of fabricated materials delivered, Kori verified the quantities that PPE claimed to have delivered to it against the construction drawings and issued interim certificates to PPE. Thereafter, PPE issued its tax invoices on the basis of the said certificates.', '11\\u2003The delivery orders submitted by PPE to Kori in December 2015 and February 2016 were duly certified by Kori for the sums of $86,028.00 and $52,323.00, inclusive of GST in March 2016, after which PPE issued its tax invoices to Kori. PPE was paid $86,028.00 in May 2016 but Kori retained the remaining $52,323.00 to set off its counter-claim in relation to the excess fabricated steel materials sold to the latter in July 2016.', '12\\u2003Although the Fabrication Contract provided that Kori was to pay PPE $350 per metric tonne of fabricated steel materials, Kori used the rate of $300 per metric tonne when it certified PPE\u2019s December 2015 and February 2016 claims because PPE did not have a license to fabricate the steel materials. PPE agreed to the lower rate of payment at the material time and issued its tax invoices in relation to the said claims on the basis of $300 per metric tonne of goods supplied.', '13\\u2003After March 2016, PPE submitted many delivery orders for verification and certification on four occasions, namely on 7 May 2016, 12 July 2016, 7 October 2016 and 7 November 2016. These delivery orders covered steel fabrication work that was carried out after March 2016. Kori retained all the delivery orders but took no steps to verify or certify the claims. Strangely, although PPE was making claims in these delivery orders for several hundred thousand dollars in relation to fabricated steel materials that Kori subsequently claimed were never delivered to it, the latter did not write to PPE to question the validity of the said delivery orders or return the documents to PPE until 18 November 2016, more than six months after receiving the first set of the said delivery orders in May 2016.', '14\\u2003On 14 November 2016, PPE\u2019s lawyers, Andrew LLC, sent a letter of demand to Kori in relation to unpaid sums due to it under the Manpower Contract.', '15\\u2003A few days later, on 18 November 2016, Kori, which, as mentioned, had never written to PPE about the delivery orders for steel fabrication work done after March 2016, finally wrote to PPE to ask the latter to take back the delivery orders that were forwarded to it in May, July, October and November 2016 on the ground that the goods were not received by it.', '16\\u2003 After legal proceedings were started by PPE, Kori claimed in para 7 of its Defence and Counterclaim filed on 21 December 2016 that it had terminated the Fabrication Contract on 3 April 2016 by way of a letter dated 31 March 2016. PPE, which asserted that it never received the said termination letter, contended that the alleged termination was concocted after the commencement of legal proceedings to avoid liability for steel fabrication work done by it after March 2016.', '17\\u2003Another dispute between the parties, which is the subject of Kori\u2019s counterclaim, concerned the sale by Kori to PPE of a quantity of excess steel materials in July 2016. The parties agreed that the cost of the said excess materials, which weighed 560.098 metric tonnes, was to be set off against the amount owed by Kori to PPE. According to PPE, it agreed to purchase the said excess steel materials only because Kori was not able to pay its bills at the material time, an assertion denied by Kori. The price for the excess fabricated steel materials is disputed. Kori\u2019s case is that the goods were sold to PPE at $1,200 per metric tonne and that PPE owed it $719,165.83 for the goods. On the other hand, PPE contended that it had agreed to purchase the goods for only $245 per metric tonne and that the total amount owed by it to Kori for the said goods is $137,224.01. PPE also contended that it is entitled to set off this sum against the amount owed to it by Kori under the Manpower Contract and the Fabrication Contract.', '18\\u2003Yet another dispute between the parties, which is also the subject of Kori\u2019s counterclaim concerns a rather small sum of $543.73 for various charges and expenses paid by it on behalf of PPE, administrative charges on such payments and 7% Goods and Services Tax. The sum claimed is with respect to expenses incurred by Kori for two security passes for PPE\u2019s employees, the payment of monthly inspection fees for electrical tools used by PPE in January 2016 and the medical fees of one of PPE\u2019s employees.'"}

As an 18% shareholder, he was to have \nbeen allotted 9,000 of the 50,000 issued shares in Hua Kai BVI,  but his \nshareholding was wrongly  stated as 5,000 shares in the register.33 Conversely, \none of the defendant\u2019s staff, Ng Liang Wee (also known as Simon  Ng), who \nshould have been  allotted only 5,000 shares,  was wrongly stated in the register  \nto have received 9,000 shares.\n28 On 31 July 2013, the 2nd plaintiff  wrote  to the corporate  secretary  in \nHong Kong,  who had arranged for the registration  of Hua Kai BVI,  to ask them \nto rectify the error by transferring  4,000 shares  from Ng Liang  Wee to him.  It \ntook the defendant\u2019s then lawyers more than a year to send the 2nd plaintiff the \nshare transfer forms \u2013 but by then the 2nd plaintiff himself had decided  not to \nexecute the share transfer  forms anyway.34 This was in light of the various  \ndisputes which had arisen between him and the defendant over the 31 May 2013 \nAgreement: in particular, he had come to realise that the representations  \npreviously made to him by the defendant  were  false,35 and that the defendant \ndid not intend to adhere to the terms of the 31 May  2013  Agreement.36\n29 The 2nd plaintiff claimed that sometime around 18 July 2013, he \nconfronted the defendant about his misrepresentations in relation  to the \nexistence and status of the entity referred to as Hua Kai Engineering and \nResources Co Ltd in the 31 May 2013 Agreement. Following this confrontation, \nthe defendant  got the 2nd plaintiff to sign the SNC  Deed (dated 3 August 2013), \n33 1ABD, p 126.\n34 1ABD pp 119-123.\n35 Statement  of Claim (Amendment  No 1), para 8.\n36 2nd Plaintiff\u2019s  AEIC,  paras 39-42.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nRJC Resource Pte  Ltd v Koh Lee Hoo [2018]  SGHC  278\n16in which  the 2nd plaintiff was promised certain payments by SNC and\/or the \ndefendant. This deed purported  to promise the 2nd plaintiff payments based on \nthe quantity of sand supplied by SNC to Starhigh.  Whilst  the subject-matter  of \nthe SNC Deed had nothing  to do with Hua Kai BVI or the Japan Project,  the \n2nd plaintiff claimed that the Deed  came about because the defendant wanted \nto use it to convince the plaintiffs that the defendant  was still able to secure  the \nsand concession in Vietnam for the supply  of sand to JRDC and to persuade  \nthem that the investment  under the terms of the 31 May 2013 Agreement could \nstill be carried  out.  To further  convince the 2nd plaintiff to sign the Deed, the \ndefendant represented, inter alia, that he was the majority shareholder of SNC \nand that he controlled SNC.  These representations  too turned out to be false \nbecause the defendant was not SNC\u2019s majority  shareholder: he held 46.82% of \nits shares.37\n30 In any event, the 2nd plaintiff  alleged that he did not receive any of the \npayments promised under the SNC Deed.

He pointed out that in a letter  \ndated 30 December 2013,  the defendant  had clearly admitted receipt of this total \nsum of $1.5 million, although he had tried to mischaracterise  it as \u201cthe purchase \nprice\u201d of part of the defendant\u2019s shareholding  in Hua Kai BVI (erroneously  \nreferred to as \u201cHua Kai (Hong Kong) in the letter).39\n32 In cross-examination, the 2nd plaintiff was referred to a document  titled  \n\u201cStatement of Account\u201d dated 3 August 2013 which  both he and the defendant  \nhad signed, and which  purported to record the payments he had made as at that \ndate towards  the purchase  price  of US$1.2 million for 18% of the defendant\u2019s  \nshares in Hua Kai BVI.40 He stated  that when  he signed this \u201cStatement of \nAccount\u201d, he had been tired and under  heavy  work pressure, and had not noticed \nthe reference to payment for shares  or even  read through the document.41 He \nhad also been distracted  by the defendant\u2019s  proclamation of \u201cgood news\u201d in \nrelation to the payments  promised to him under the SNC  Deed, which  was also \nsigned on 3 August 2013 \u2013 and in consequence  he had overlooked the contents  \nof the \u201cStatement  of Account\u201d.42 The 2nd plaintiff also sought to rely on a \nnumber of audio-recordings he had secretly  made of meetings with the \ndefendant in which  (according  to the 2nd plaintiff) he had consistently denied \n38 Statement  of Claim (Amendment  No. 1), paras 32-33.\n39 1ABD, p 117.\n40 Defendant\u2019s  AEIC, p 115.\n41 Transcript of 22 May  2018, p 104.\n42 Transcript of 22 May  2018, pp 106-107.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nRJC Resource Pte  Ltd v Koh Lee Hoo [2018]  SGHC  278\n18that the monies were for the purchase of shares in Hua Kai BVI, and in which \nthe defendant  had at certain points declared that he would return the monies43.\nDefendant\u2019s 1st witness\u2019  evidence\n33 The defendant called Khoo as his first witness. Khoo is the director and \nshareholder of a company in the sand trade, known as Raffles-Sand.   As stated,  \nsometime in late March 2013, Raffles-Sand  entered into a MOU  with JRDC for \nthe supply  of sand and stone to a construction  project in Fukushima, Japan.44 As \nKhoo had known  the defendant for some years and was aware that the defendant \nhad \u201ca lot of contacts  in Cambodia and Vietnam\u201d,  he asked the defendant to \nsupply sand to Raffles-Sand for onward sale  to JRDC.45\n34 Pursuant to the above proposal, Khoo and the defendant  discussed \nsetting up a new entity  for the purpose of buying sand and stone  from Singapore \nHua Kai. The purchased  sand and stone would then be supplied to Raffles-Sand, \nwhich would in turn supply the materials to JRDC.46 The 2nd plaintiff  came  to \nknow of this intended business venture through the defendant,  and expressed \ninterest in joining in. To facilitate  the 2nd plaintiff\u2019s participation, Khoo  was \ntold by the defendant  that the 2nd plaintiff would purchase  18% of the \ndefendant\u2019s shares in the new entity.47 This new entity  was to be incorporated \nin the BVI.\n43 2nd Plaintiff\u2019s  AEIC,  para 49, pp 128-489.\n44 1ABD, pp 16-18.\n45 Transcript of 23 May  2018, p 107.\n46 Alex Khoo\u2019s AEIC, para 6.\n47 Alex Khoo\u2019s AEIC, para 7.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nRJC Resource Pte  Ltd v Koh Lee Hoo [2018]  SGHC  278\n1935 Khoo testified that in or around  June 2013, he had discussed the \nincorporation of the BVI entity with both the defendant and the 2nd plaintiff \nduring their first trip to Japan together.48 This was also the first time he met the \n2nd plaintiff. He recalled  highlighting to the latter that \u201cincorporating  a BVI \ncompany was not so simple because  the name  of the BVI entity would have to \nbe approved  first\u201d.49 This was why in early  June 2013,  Khoo had corresponded  \nwith a corporate secretarial firm in Hong Kong \u2013 SBC International \u2013 to get \ntheir assistance in verifying the availability  of the name \u201cHua Kai Engineering \n& Resources  Ltd\u201d for registration in the BVI.50 Khoo testified  that he was the \none who had suggested  the name \u201cHua  Kai Engineering & Resources Ltd\u201d to \nthe defendant.

In cross-examination, he disagreed with the suggestion  by \nthe plaintiffs\u2019  counsel that the intention had been for Singapore Hua Kai to \nassign the Hoang  Viet sand concession to Hua Kai BVI and then for Hua Kai \nBVI to supply  the sand directly to  JRDC.61\n40 In any event, according to Khoo, the MOU with JRDC was a non-\nbinding letter of intent: to date, no firm agreement  had been  signed  with JRDC. \n Khoo agreed that there had been no capital outlay insofar  as procuring the \nsupply of sand was concerned, although there  had been \u201ca few thousand\u201d dollars \nof expenses related to the incorporation of Hua Kai BVI which the defendant \nhad paid.62 The reason why no deal had been  concluded with JRDC to date was \nbecause after entering into the MOU with Raffles-Sand,  JRDC had been \nreluctant to sign any agreement. JRDC had instead  referred Raffles-Sand to \u201cthe \nbig company in Japan\u201d, which had in turn also declined to sign any agreement \n\u201cdirectly\u201d or to provide a deposit payment.

He admitted that at that point,  he \nhad told the 2nd plaintiff that the sand business  was very lucrative so that the \nlatter would  lend him money.65\n42 According  to the defendant, the 2nd plaintiff knew that he (the \ndefendant) had his own sand ship as well as sand concessions in Vietnam and \nCambodia. The 2nd plaintiff had travelled to Cambodia with the defendant and \nseen the site of the sand concession for himself; and he became interested in \nbecoming a shareholder and director of the defendant\u2019s company.66 The \ndefendant even arranged for a Cambodian  sand concession to be granted to the \n1st plaintiff  (ie, RJC  Resource).67\n43 Sometime in early 2013, the defendant was approached by Khoo after \nKhoo\u2019s company Raffles-Sand entered into an MOU with a Japanese  company \n(JRDC) for the supply of river sand and stone.  Khoo  wanted the defendant\u2019s \ncompany Singapore Hua Kai to supply the sand and stone.  At that stage of their \ndiscussions, the two of them envisaged an arrangement whereby  Singapore Hua \nKai would obtain sand from Vietnam  via the sand concession it had from Hoang \nViet, before selling it to Raffles-Sand for on-selling  to JRDC.68\n64 Transcript of 11 June  2018, pp 11-12.\n65 Transcript of 11 June  2018, pp 14-15.\n66 Transcript of 11 June  2018, pp 10-13.\n67 Transcript of 11 June  2018, pp 16-19.\n68 Defendant\u2019s  AEIC, paras 11-12.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nRJC Resource Pte  Ltd v Koh Lee Hoo [2018]  SGHC  278\n2344 The 2nd plaintiff came to know of these plans,  as the defendant  gave \nhim a copy of the Raffles-Sand-JRDC MOU and told him about its potential.69  \nConsequently, the 2nd plaintiff \u201cwanted to be a part of the project to sell sand \nand stone to Japan because  the project was in high volume and the Japanese  \noffered price  was good\u201d.70 As such, he and the defendant came  to an agreement \nthat he \u201cwould provide \u2026 consideration  [of] US$1.2 million dollars for 18% of \nthe [defendant\u2019s] shareholding in the business venture, which  was subsequently \nincorporated as Hua Kai Engineering & Resources Ltd [ie, Hua  Kai BVI]\u201d.71\n45 The defendant asserted that the 31 May 2013 Agreement \u201c[did] not \nevidence the true agreement\u201d  between  him and the 2nd plaintiff  because what  \nthe two of them had contracted for was actually a \u201cShare Purchase  Agreement\u201d \nwherein the 2nd plaintiff \u201cwould buy 18% of [the defendant\u2019s] shareholding in \nHua Kai BVI and once the business  venture  started  generating returns, he would \nalso be entitled to 18% of the profits\u201d.72 In fact, the agreement had been prepared \nby the 2nd plaintiff\u2019s lawyer. The defendant had not been given any forewarning \nas to the signing  of the 31 May 2013 Agreement  as the 2nd plaintiff had merely  \ntold him they were  going to the lawyer\u2019s office for coffee.73 As he had only a \nlimited grasp of the English  language,  he signed the agreement without \nunderstanding its contents.74 Neither  the 2nd plaintiff nor the lawyer  explained  \nthe document to him, and he \u201cthought  that it was an illegal contract\u201d.75  He left \nthe lawyer\u2019s office in a  huff without taking a copy of  the agreement.\n69 Transcript of 11 June  2018, pp 36-38.\n70 Defendant\u2019s  AEIC, para  14.\n71 Defendant\u2019s  AEIC, para  16.\n72 Defendant\u2019s  AEIC, para  20.\n73 Transcript of 11 June  2018, p 84.\n74 Transcript of 11 June  2018, p 7.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nRJC Resource Pte  Ltd v Koh Lee Hoo [2018]  SGHC  278\n2446 The defendant was certain that the 2nd plaintiff knew  Hua Kai BVI did \nnot yet exist  as at 31 May 2013,  because when he gave the 2nd plaintiff a copy  \nof the Raffles-Sand-JRDC MOU, he had stated  that they were \u201cin the process \nof incorporating  the company\u201d.76 Indeed, the incorporation of Hua Kai BVI was \na subject Khoo, the 2nd plaintiff and himself had \u201cactively discussed \u2026 since \nApril 2013\u201d.77 The defendant had also shown the 2nd plaintiff a copy of the \nsand concession  agreement which his company  Singapore Hua Kai had signed \nwith Hoang Viet on 19 May 2013,78 so the 2nd plaintiff was aware that it was \nSingapore Hua Kai \u2013 and not Hua Kai BVI \u2013 which held the Vietnam sand \nconcession. The defendant denied having  told the 2nd plaintiff that Singapore \nHua Kai would assign this sand concession  to Hua Kai BVI. Instead, what he \nhad told the 2nd plaintiff at that juncture  was that Hua Kai BVI would \u201chave \npriority in obtaining the sand\u201d from Singapore  Hua Kai\u2019s sand concession in \nVietnam;79 and Hua Kai BVI would supply the sand to JRDC.

Prior to making \nthis announcement, the defendant did not notify Khoo  of the 2nd plaintiff\u2019s \nintended shareholding because as far as he was concerned, he was simply selling  \nhis own shares in Hua  Kai BVI.82\n48 It was also during this Hong Kong trip that the defendant  decided  to \n\u201cgive\u201d Ng Liang Wee 10% of his shares in Hua Kai BVI, as Ng Liang  Wee had \nserved him for many years  as an employee and was a \u201ccapable assistant\u201d.83  \nUnfortunately, the corporate secretarial firm (SBC  International) had made  a \nmistake by confusing Ng Liang Wee with the 2nd plaintiff \u2013 such that Ng Liang \nWee was allotted the number of shares that should have been allotted to the 2nd \nplaintiff, and vice versa.84 The 2nd plaintiff himself had written to SBC \nInternational about  the mistake; and on 25 August 2013, Khoo had also notified \nSBC International  that all the shareholders of Hua Kai BVI agreed the mistake \nshould be rectified.\n49 In respect  of the amounts paid to the defendant pursuant to the 31 May \n2013 Agreement,  as noted earlier,  the amended defence had appeared to take \nthe position  that at least some  of the payments pleaded by the plaintiffs were \ndenied. Thus for example, in respect of the four payments  totalling $712,500 \nwhich the 2nd plaintiff claimed had been  made  on 29 July 2013 and 26 August \n2013 (see [30] above),  the defendant had pleaded a general denial of the relevant \nparagraphs in the amended statement of claim  and put the 2nd plaintiff  to strict \nproof of these paragraphs.85 In his affidavit  of evidence-in-chief, the defendant \n82 Transcript of 11 June  2018, pp 62-63.\n83 Transcript of 25 June  2018, p 6.\n84 Defendant\u2019s  AEIC, paras 44-46, pp 112-113.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nRJC Resource Pte  Ltd v Koh Lee Hoo [2018]  SGHC  278\n26also alleged that the US$1.2 million  mentioned in the 31 May 2013 Agreement \nwas to have been paid in three tranches: US$500,000 by 31 May 2013; \nUS$200,000 by 15 July 2013;  and US$500,000 by 31 August 2013.86 Taking \ninto account the payments he had actually received from the 2nd plaintiff, there \nremained \u2013 as at 3 August  2013 \u2013 an amount of US$400,000 outstanding from  \nthe 2nd plaintiff out of the total of US$1.2  million.87 He relied on the \u201cStatement \nof Account\u201d dated 3 August  2013 in putting forward this narrative.88 At the \nconclusion of the trial, however, the closing submissions filed on the \ndefendant\u2019s behalf took the position that \u201c[b]y 26 August 2013, US$1.2 million  \nwas paid in entirety by the 2nd plaintiff to the defendant\u201d.89\nIssues for determination\n50 To recap, the plaintiffs\u2019 claims against the defendant were broadly  as \nfollows:\n(a) The defendant had made fraudulent misrepresentations to the \nplaintiffs.

Or was it an agreement for the plaintiffs to \ninvest US$1.2 million in the Japan Project in return for profits to be \nmade from the supply of sand to Japan,  as the plaintiffs claimed?\n52 The determination of [51(a)] was relevant to disposing of the plaintiffs\u2019 \nclaim for fraudulent  misrepresentation; whereas  the determination of [51(b)] \nwas relevant  to disposing of"}
{"casename":"2018_SGHC_279","fact":"background, I did not accept  that Suresh would profit from falsely \nimplicating the accused  in the transaction. As I explain at [66]\u2013[69] below, it \nwas clear to me that Suresh could not have been  the person  using the first and \nsecond numbers,  and he need not have fabricated  evidence against the accused \nas the user of the numbers in order  to save himself. Given that Suresh  and the \naccused had been longstanding friends with no history of hostility or ill-will,95 I \ndid not see any basis for the accused\u2019s allegation that Suresh\u2019s evidence was \ngiven with the intent  of falsely  implicating him. \nThe accused\u2019s defence  \n65 I turn now to the accused\u2019s case. In its written submissions, the Defence  \ntook the position that Suresh was the person  who had coordinated the \ntransaction using the first number,  and not the accused. First, Suresh  largely  \nfitted the description  of \u201cIndia\u201d given to Mogan (see [13] above);96 it was \nundisputed that Suresh was 37 years  old at the material time, was about 1.76m \nin height, and wore three pieces of gold jewellery.97 In contrast, the description \nof \u201cIndia\u201d given  to Mogan did not fit the accused at all. Also,  the call records \nshowed that Suresh  had dialled Mogan\u2019s number on two occasions; once on 5 \nSeptember 2013 and once  again  on 6 September 2013, less than three hours \nbefore his  arrest.98 This showed that Suresh was associated with Mogan. \n66 Having  considered Suresh\u2019s and the accused\u2019s evidence at the trial, as \nwell as the call records,  I rejected  the Defence\u2019s argument that it was Suresh  \nwho had been the person coordinating  the transaction.

In my view, this was an allegation of such grave importance  \nthat it  should have been raised  to him. \n67 Second,  the objective evidence  (in the form  of call records) showed that \nSuresh could not have been the user of the first number. On 6 and 7 September \n2013, Mogan communicated with \u201cIndia\u201d exclusively over the phone  using the \nfirst number  to coordinate the intended drug delivery. The user of the first \nnumber could not have been Suresh, since  Suresh\u2019s mobile phones were  seized \nupon his arrest at the McDonald\u2019s,  and subsequent verification showed that \nSuresh\u2019s phone number  was 93792632. After  Suresh\u2019s  arrest, SI Tay directed \nMogan to call \u201cIndia\u201d  to ascertain  whether the police had arrested the right \nperson. However, the call was received by another  person, meaning that \u201cIndia\u201d \nand Suresh could not have been  the same person:99\nA: \u2026 shortly after we arrived, I\u2019d heard over the radio set \nthat there was one Indian who was arrested \u2026 at the \nMcDonald\u2019s.\n\u2026\nA: Shortly after we arrived  at the car park \u2026 in order to \nascertain that the person who was arrested  to be the \n\u201cIndia\u201d, I \u2026 dialled that number, and before that, I \ninformed the arresting party \u2026 to look out for the \narrested guy\u2019s  handphone,  see whether  will it ring so \nthat it would tally that he\u2019s the intended recipient. So \nafter I dial the number,  apparently  the \u201cIndia\u201d pick up \nthe call \u2026 and immediately Mogan spoke to him. \u2026\n68 After Suresh was arrested at around 1.20am on 7 September  2013, he \nwould not have  been in any position to receive any calls. The fact that Mogan \nspoke to \u201cIndia\u201d a further  five times from 1.20am till 2.00am100 served as further \nconfirmation that Suresh could not be \u201cIndia\u201d.  This was further  bolstered by the \n99 Tr\/05.10.17\/9\/23\u201324, 10\/1\u20136.\n100 Exhibit F,  s\/n 1, 2, 5, 7, 11.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Tangaraju s\/o Suppiah [2018]  SGHC  279\n27call records  preceding Suresh\u2019s arrest, which  disclosed a total of three calls \nmade between Mogan and the first number,  followed quickly  by calls between \nthe first number and Suresh\u2019s mobile phone.  There  was no reason  in fact or logic  \nto believe  that Suresh would  have  made multiple calls to himself  after each call \nwith Mogan.  Suresh and  the user of the first number were different  persons.\n69 I come to the Defence\u2019s point that Suresh had dialled  Mogan\u2019s number \ntwice in the days leading up to his arrest on 7 September 2013. In this regard,  \nSuresh vehemently denied that he had dialled Mogan\u2019s  number in the face of \nirrefutable objective evidence to the contrary. While this might  have cast some \ndoubt on whether Suresh  knew of or about  Mogan prior  to his arrest, the \nimportant point  remained  that Suresh did not speak to Mogan during these two \ncalls. It was undisputed that while the call records  showed that Mogan\u2019s number \nhad been dialled,  the calls never went through; Suresh did not speak  to Mogan. \nTherefore, for the transaction, there  was no objective evidence of any \narrangement made by Suresh with Mogan. As I stated above, apart from  this \naspect as to whether Suresh knew  of or about Mogan, I found Suresh\u2019s evidence \nto be reliable. \n70 In sharp  contrast, I found the accused  not to be a credible  witness. As \ndetailed in [55]\u2013[58] above, he attempted to distance  himself from  the second  \nnumber by claiming that he had lost his mobile phone. In doing so, he made \nunwarranted allegations against Insp Ng in relation  to the recording of the 24 \nApril 2014 statement. In addition, there  were these two clearly unsatisfactory \naspects of  his evidence: \n(a) First, the accused claimed that when he reconnected with Suresh  \nin July 2013, he only gave  the second number to Suresh. If his version \nthat he lost his mobile phone on 7 August 2013 were to be believed, \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Tangaraju s\/o Suppiah [2018]  SGHC  279\n28Suresh would not have been  able to contact the accused thereafter. Yet, \nthere were occasions in August  2013 when they met up for drinks. Even \nthen, the accused did not inform Suresh that he had lost his mobile \nphone, or inform Suresh of his other number being 81787447. Indeed, \naccording to the accused,  they met on 5 September  2013, and arranged \nto go for the urine test at around 8pm to 9pm on 6 September 2013. They \nalso met on 6 September 2013. Still, the accused did not furnish Suresh \nwith a contact number. His evidence defied  logic.  \n(b) Second,  in line with the contents  of his statements, the accused \nstated in his oral testimony  that he reported for his urine test on 6 \nSeptember 2013.  As he left the police station,  he noticed Suresh  and \nShashi at a car parked along the road.  He then added that Suresh \ninformed him that Suresh had obtained a medical certificate. Suresh then \nwalked to the guard post to submit the medical  certificate to a police \nofficer there. Suresh denied meeting the accused  at Clementi Police \nStation. Indeed, having  obtained a medical  certificate to avoid  taking the \nurine test, there was no reason  for Suresh to submit it on the same  day, \nrisking detection and arrest by the police.  In this regard, the \nunchallenged evidence of Nurazhar bin Sadikin,  the accused\u2019s  \nsupervision officer, was that supervisees  need  to submit their medical  \ncertificates personally to the supervision  officers.  Furthermore, Suresh\u2019s \nmedical certificate was seized upon his arrest  at the McDonald\u2019s. \nClearly, the accused had not been  truthful about his interactions with \nSuresh that night. \nViewed in totality,  the accused\u2019s evidence  was unbelievable.  \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Tangaraju s\/o Suppiah [2018]  SGHC  279\n29Conclusion \n71 Based  on all of the foregoing,  I found that it was the accused who was \nusing the first number on 6 and 7 September  2013 to communicate with both \nMogan and Suresh. On the accused\u2019s own admission,  he was the user of the \nsecond number, which in turn linked him to the first number, given Mogan and \nSuresh\u2019s clear evidence that both the first and second  numbers were used by the \nsame person.  This evidence was corroborated by direct evidence from  Suresh  \nthat the person he had been  in communication  with on 6 and 7 September 2013 \nwas none other than the  accused. \n72 For completeness, I should add that another piece of evidence from  \nMogan reinforced  this finding. Mogan stated that initially, he had called the first \nnumber, and \u201cIndia\u201d had told him that he could secure a job for Mogan at a \nmini-mart in Tuas. The accused, of course,  operated  a mini-mart in Tuas  and by \nhis own evidence had the power  to engage help as he saw fit.101 This \nstrengthened the case that \u201cIndia\u201d  was in fact the accused. As stated, I also \nrejected the accused\u2019s submission that Suresh had been the user of the first \nnumber at  the material time.\nWhether the accused coordinated the delivery  of cannabis to himself\n73 Having  established that it was the accused who was the person using \nthe first number, I proceed to deal with whether the accused had engaged in \nthe conspiracy to traffic in cannabis.  \n74 In this regard, based on the evidence  adduced from  Mogan, he was \ninstructed by \u201cSelva\u201d  to deliver  the cannabis to \u201cIndia\u201d in Singapore. Further, \nbased on the evidence of Mogan, Suresh and SI Tay, the accused\u2019s plan for \n101 D2 at paras 8\u20139.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Tangaraju s\/o Suppiah [2018]  SGHC  279\n30the delivery  of cannabis  had evolved over the course of 6 and 7 September \n2013. Initially, the plan was for Mogan to pass the cannabis  to \u201cIndia\u201d (ie, the \naccused) at the toilet  at McDonald\u2019s. Subsequently,  the accused informed \nMogan that he would be asking his \u201cfat Indian\u201d friend to collect  the cannabis. \nThe accused  coordinated the delivery by Mogan on the one hand, and the \nreceipt by Suresh  on the other. He did so by checking that Mogan was still at \nthe toilet of the McDonald\u2019s, before asking Suresh to check if there was \nanyone in the  toilet  at the  said McDonald\u2019s.  \n75 It was also clear  that the accused knew that the delivery was of a \nconsignment of cannabis. SI Tay testified that he had heard \u201cIndia\u201d (ie, the \naccused) specifically mention the word  \u201cya lei\u201d:\nQ: Now, I note that there is reference to these  words \u201cya lei\u201d \nat the third line. How did this come about?\nA: During  the conversation between Mogan  and the \n\u201cIndia\u201d, I heard  \u201cya lei\u201d was being brought up a couple \nof times. \u2026 so I asked [Mogan] what does \u201cya lei\u201d means \nand he said, \u201cLeaves\u201d.\n\u2026\nQ: Who had mentioned the words \u201cya lei\u201d?\nA: \u201cIndia\u201d did mention \u201cya lei\u201d. \u2026\n76  \u201cYa lei\u201d, or \u201cyellai \u201d, transliterated,  means \u201cleaves\u201d in Tamil.  This was \na term which the accused himself had used during the phone conversation \nwhen referring to the thing which his friend  was to collect from  Mogan at the \ntoilet at the McDonald\u2019s. In my view, given the context of the discussion, \u201cya \nlei\u201d could  mean nothing other than the cannabis, and the accused would have \nknown this, being a user of cannabis  himself. I did not accept the accused\u2019s \nbare denial  that he  did not know  that \u201cya lei \u201d meant  cannabis.102 \n102 Tr\/26.04.18\/69\/24\u201326.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Tangaraju s\/o Suppiah [2018]  SGHC  279\n3177 By all of the above,  I found that the accused knew that Mogan was \ndelivering cannabis, and that he had coordinated the delivery of the said \ncannabis to himself by instructing Mogan to pass the cannabis to Suresh, who \nwas to collect the cannabis on the accused\u2019s  behalf. The accused had engaged \nin a conspiracy with Mogan for Mogan to deliver the 1017.9g of cannabis to \nhimself. \n78 To round off, I should deal with the Defence\u2019s argument that the \nProsecution ought to have called Shashi as a witness, since  he was in the car \nwith Suresh at the material time and would have been  privy to the \nconversations (at least from Suresh\u2019s end) between Suresh and  \u201cAppu bro\u201d.103 \nWhile Shashi\u2019s evidence would have been relevant in that it would have either \ncorroborated or contradicted Suresh\u2019s evidence, I accepted that the \nProsecution had taken reasonable steps to locate Shashi, including calling  him \non his mobile phone and sending him letters  at his registered address.  The \nmere fact that the Prosecution had not made attempts to call on him in person  \nat his registered address did not undermine  the Prosecution\u2019s case. Moreover, \nI should stress  that in finding that the accused was the user of the first number, \nI had relied not just on Suresh\u2019s evidence,  but also on Mogan\u2019s  evidence and \nthe accused\u2019s  own admission.\nAct pursuant to conspiracy \n79 Next, it was undisputed that Mogan had brought into Singapore 1017.9g \nof cannabis,  and was on the way to deliver  the cannabis to \u201cIndia\u201d (which, as I \nhave found,  referred to the accused)  when  he was arrested. This constituted an \nact committed in pursuance of the aforementioned conspiracy, and satisfied the \nsecond element of  the charge.\n103 DCS at paras 32\u201336.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Tangaraju s\/o Suppiah [2018]  SGHC  279\n32Intention to traffic \n80 Finally, the Prosecution must prove  the additional mens  rea element of \nan intention to traffic,  since  the intended recipient  of the drugs  was the accused \nhimself. Where the quantity of the drug possessed is many times what  a typical  \naddict would be able to consume  on a daily  basis, the likelihood  is that the \noffender has the drug in his possession  not for personal consumption,  but for \nthe purpose of trafficking  (Ong Ah Chuan v Public Prosecutor [1979\u20131980] \nSLR(R) 710 at [29]). Here, a large  quantity of cannabis was involved, being \nmore than twice the amount which  would attract  the death penalty. It was not \nargued that the cannabis was intended for the accused\u2019s own consumption,  nor \nwas any evidence  led by the Defence  in that respect. Therefore,  I found  that \ngiven the large quantity  of cannabis involved,  the accused had intended to traffic  \nin the said  cannabis.\nConclusion\n81 By the foregoing, I found that the Prosecution  had proved the charge \nagainst the accused  beyond a reasonable doubt. I found him guilty and convicted  \nhim of the charge.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)\nPP v Tangaraju s\/o Suppiah [2018]  SGHC  279\n33Decision on sentence\n82 As I had earlier mentioned, the prescribed  punishment  under s 33(1) \nread with the Second Schedule  of the MDA is death, although the alternative \nsentencing regime in s 33B(1)( a) of the MDA provides the court a discretion \nto impose  a mandatory term of life imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane \nwhere (i) the offender satisfies the court  that his acts fall within \ns 33B(2)( a)(i)\u2013(iv) of the MDA, and (ii) the Public Prosecutor certifies  that \nthe offender  has substantively assisted the CNB in disrupting drug trafficking  \nactivities within or outside Singapore. \n83 Here, the accused  was meant to take delivery  of the cannabis, and, as \nI have found above,  this was meant for the purpose  of trafficking, and not for \nhis own consumption. Given the nature of his defence, the accused did not \ngive any evidence that he was merely  to deliver  the cannabis. I therefore \nfound that he has not proved on a balance  of probabilities that he was a mere \ncourier. Also, the Public Prosecutor has not issued a certificate of substantive \nassistance. Therefore,  the alternative  sentencing  regime was not available. \nAccordingly, I imposed the mandatory  sentence of death on the accused.\nHoo Sheau PengJudge  \nAnandan s\/o Bala and Kee Yongwen Kenneth (Attorney-General\u2019s \nChambers) for  the Public Prosecutor;\nRam  Goswami (Ram  Goswami) and Cheng Kim Kuan (KK Cheng \n& Co) for the accused. \nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:41 hrs)"}

The Hillford therefore includes not only the usual amenities found in a private condominium but also an elder-care centre and elderly-related supporting facilities.', '6\\u2003By a letter of award issued and accepted in January 2015, 5', 'the plaintiff appointed the defendant as its aluminium, stainless steel and glazing subcontractor for The Hillford. The value of the subcontract was a little over $900,000. The defendant\u2019s scope of works under the subcontract included fabricating, supplying and installing semi-frameless shower screens in all 321 bathrooms in The Hillford. The defendant commenced work in February 2015 and completed work in October 2016.', '7\\u2003In October 2016, the defendant issued its Progress Claim No. 8, being its final progress claim under the subcontract. This progress claim would, in due course, be the basis of the defendant\u2019s adjudication application.', '8\\u2003Between October 2016 and January 2017, the sliding glass doors in at least nine shower frames in eight different units in The Hillford shattered while in use. 6', 'In many of these instances, personal injuries resulted. 7', 'Some of these injuries were serious. 8', 'In December 2016 and January 2017, the plaintiff, the developer, the developer\u2019s architect and the defendant held meetings and had discussions to find out what was causing the glass shower doors to shatter, and to formulate and implement a solution. 9', 'As part of this exercise, the developer asked its architect to gather facts and documents in order to determine the root cause of the shattering glass doors.', '9\\u2003The plaintiff\u2019s initial position was that the glass doors were shattering because the defendant had used defective materials or was guilty of defective workmanship. The defendant\u2019s response was that the doors could be shattering for three other reasons: 10', '(i) the users of the doors may have used too much force to slide them open, causing the leading vertical edge of the glass door to strike the wall; (ii) the glass doors may be spontaneously shattering due to the presence of nickel sulphide inclusions in the glass, which was an inherent characteristic of tempered glass and not a defect; 11', 'or (iii) there could be design and space constraints in the shower area where the frames had been installed resulting in glass doors striking the wall when they were opened.', '10\\u2003On 27 December 2016, the plaintiff, through its then solicitors, formally put the defendant on notice that the plaintiff would look to the defendant for damages for, and an indemnity against, all losses occasioned by what the plaintiff characterised as the defendant\u2019s negligent installation of the shower screens. 12', 'The plaintiff\u2019s solicitors\u2019 letter was drafted broadly enough also to cover a claim that the defendant had used defective materials. 13', '11\\u2003On 11 January 2017, the defendant wrote to the plaintiff and to the developer\u2019s architect. This letter was not a direct response to the plaintiff\u2019s solicitors\u2019 letter of 27 December 2016 (see [10] above). Instead, this letter set out the defendant\u2019s position arising from the parties\u2019 meetings and discussions (see [8] above). 14', 'Even though this letter was sent on the defendant\u2019s own letterhead, its structure and phrasing makes it clear that it was drafted for the defendant by solicitors.', '12\\u2003In its letter dated 11 January 2017, the defendant denied that there were any defects in the materials or in the installation. 15', 'The defendant also noted that the only glass panels that were shattering were the sliding panels in the doors. None of the identical, fixed panels in the shower frames were shattering. The defendant therefore posited that the doors were shattering because they were striking the walls when slid open. 16', 'The defendant pointed out that the plaintiff\u2019s consultants had approved the defendant\u2019s shop drawings and mock-up of the shower frame before the defendant commenced fabrication and installation. The defendant\u2019s position was that, if the doors were found to be shattering because they were coming into contact with the wall when slid open, the defendant would contest any back charge arising from the shattering doors and would consider any remedial work which the plaintiff might require to be a variation of their subcontract, and therefore to be carried out at the plaintiff\u2019s cost. 17', '13\\u2003On 20 January 2017, the defendant\u2019s solicitors responded to the plaintiff\u2019s solicitors\u2019 letter dated 27 December 2016 (see [10] above). 18', 'The response took broadly the same position as the defendant\u2019s letter to the plaintiff dated 11 January 2017. In addition, the plaintiffs\u2019 solicitors pointed out that the temporary occupation permit for The Hillford had already been issued, which meant that the developer\u2019s architect had accepted the defendant\u2019s work as being in compliance with the subcontract. 19', 'The letter concluded by demanding that the plaintiff pay the defendant\u2019s Progress Claim No. 8 issued in October 2016 without further delay (see [7] above). 20', '14\\u2003On 26 January 2017, the plaintiff\u2019s solicitors responded to the defendant\u2019s solicitors. 21', 'In this response, the plaintiff denied that the defendant had completed the works in compliance with the subcontract. The plaintiff further denied that the defendant was entitled to payment on its Progress Claim No. 8.', '15\\u2003On 13 February 2017, the developer\u2019s architect informed the plaintiff that there were two root causes for the shattering glass doors. 22', 'First, the design of the shower frames required a 30mm buffer between the vertical edge of the glass door and the wall in order to avoid the edge striking the wall when it was slid open. However, the architect found that some frames had been installed with a buffer which was less than 30mm. Second, the rollers in the aluminium tracks for the doors allowed the doors to slide too freely. The doors therefore picked up too much speed and momentum when slid open. Both of these factors increased the likelihood of a glass door striking the wall at high speed and shattering, even when it was opened in normal usage. 23', '16\\u2003To address these root causes, the developer\u2019s architect required the plaintiff to take three remedial steps for all 321 of the shower screens at The Hillford. First, rubber studs were to be installed on the aluminium tracks to slow down the doors. Second, clear plastic edge seals were to be applied to protect the leading edge of the door. Third, the doors were to be laminated with safety film so that, even if the door did strike the wall and shatter, the laminate would hold the shards of glass in place to prevent injury. 24', '17\\u2003The defendant agreed to replace, at its own cost and without admission of liability, all of the doors which had shattered. 25', 'But the defendant refused to perform any of the further remedial steps which the developer\u2019s architect required unless the plaintiff accepted that the work would be a variation to the parties\u2019 subcontract.', '18\\u2003As a result, in January and February 2017, the developer and the plaintiff made their own arrangements to have all of the remedial work carried out. 26', 'It appears that it was the plaintiff who ultimately bore the cost of this work. 27', 'In addition, the plaintiff reimbursed the medical expenses of residents who had suffered personal injuries. 28', '19\\u2003On 22 February 2017, the defendant served a payment claim on the plaintiff within the meaning of the Act. 29', 'This payment claim covered all work done under the subcontract for which the defendant had yet to be paid. As it was served long after the defendant had completed its work and left the site, it was in substance the defendant\u2019s version of the parties\u2019 final account under their subcontract.', '20\\u2003In this payment claim, the defendant claimed that the plaintiff owed the defendant the total sum of $204,279.96 (including goods and services tax) for all work remaining unpaid. Part of that sum was $109,910.40 (including goods and services tax) which the defendant claimed for supplying and installing 321 glass shower screens. 30', '21\\u2003On 7 March 2017, the plaintiff served a payment response. 31', 'In it, the plaintiff sought to back charge $78,659.96 to the defendant for \u201cCOSTING INCURED [sic] FOR THE SHATTERING OF SHOWER SCREEN\u201d. 32', 'The back charge included the medical claims reimbursed by the plaintiff, the attendance costs incurred by both the plaintiff and the developer in dealing with the issue and the costs of the remedial work. 33', 'The plaintiff also made certain other deductions and adjustments in the payment response. The net result of all this was that the plaintiff\u2019s version of the final account showed that it was the defendant who owed the plaintiff just under $3,000.'"}

The 2nd defendant also averred that her understanding of the process was that she would be given money upon providing her customers\u2019 invoices to Centurion, and then required to repay Centurion with a larger amount of money at a later date. 14', '12\\u2003On the other hand, Chin avers that she explained to the 2nd defendant that VPD was ARC\u2019s collecting agent for the sale and purchase of receivables, and that VPD was obliged to provide ARC with an undated notice of assignment as VPD would be selling receivables to ARC without disclosing the sale and assignment of the receivables to its debtors (ie, on an undisclosed basis). Chin maintains, contrary to the 2nd defendant\u2019s averments, that she never told the 2nd defendant that the notice of assignment was to secure the 2nd defendant\u2019s borrowing, or that VPD\u2019s debtors would not be contacted as long as the 1st defendant repaid the borrowed monies. 15', 'I note that the terms of the written VPD RPA and PCPL RPA do not suggest that they were in substance loan agreements. 16', '13\\u2003I pause to note that the 2nd defendant\u2019s position is that she did not understand what or how the VPD RPA and PCPL RPA worked and that she thought the sums were simply loans. To this end, she asserts that she is not familiar or versed in financing and that she did not know how to obtain credit facilities. 17', 'Nevertheless, it is not disputed that between 2014 and 2016, she submitted some 174 invoices pursuant to the financing arrangement. She avers that these monies were borrowed for the purpose of developing her interior design business. The total sum received by the 2nd defendant\/VPD was about $18.3m. A total sum of $19.5m was paid back under the arrangement. The 2nd defendant\u2019s position is that interest of $1.5m was paid in respect of the monies advanced on these 174 invoices. 18', '14\\u2003The 2nd defendant\u2019s assertion that she was na\u00efve and unsophisticated sits rather uneasily with the number of invoices against which she was able to raise $18.3m. Whilst these 174 invoices are not the subject matter of the present dispute, the 2nd defendant submitted that a trial was warranted so that the nature of these 174 invoices could be explored. The point raised was that an examination of the circumstances relating to the 174 invoices together with the 60 invoices in dispute in the present case (see [25] below) would support her case that the transactions were in fact money-lending. 19', 'In other words, the disputed 60 invoices and \u201ctraded debts\u201d were said to be part of a history of lending that dated back to the 174 invoices.', '15\\u2003The fact however is that the 2nd defendant does not assert that the 174 invoices were fake or fabricated. To be clear, she appears to advance the argument that the $18.3m was in fact loans secured by the invoices, and that these loans were paid off together with interest of $1.5m. That said, the terms of the written VPD RPA and PCPL RPA are entirely consistent with the plaintiffs\u2019 position that they were in fact receivables purchase agreements. I note also that the VPD RPA and PCPL RPA agreements are not the subject matter of this suit and involve different parties.', '16\\u2003In any event, around late January 2015, the 2nd defendant contacted Chin and requested that the VPD RPA and the PCPL RPA be transferred to her sole proprietorship, Vangard Project (\u201cVP\u201d).', '17\\u2003I pause here to note that Chin asserts that the 2nd defendant informed her that VP had been set up because the 2nd defendant did not wish to continue working with her business partner in VPD and\/or PCPL. 20', 'An enhanced credit bureau search was conducted. 21', 'Chin was informed that VPD and PCPL\u2019s business would be diverted to VP. The 2nd defendant\u2019s affidavit does not refer to or give any explanation as to why VP was established or why she did not wish to continue with her business partner. Indeed, this is a matter on which nothing at all is said by the defendants. Their amended defence simply states that in or around August 2014, the 2nd defendant was director of the now defunct VPD 22', 'and that on 22 January 2015, a new agreement was discussed and executed with the 2nd defendant\u2019s newly set-up sole proprietorship, VP. 23', '18\\u2003In any case, it is clear that on 22 January 2015, ARC and VP entered into a \u201cwritten receivables purchase agreement.\u201d 24', '19\\u2003Around April and May 2016, the 2nd plaintiff took over as the paying and collecting agent for transactions under ARC\u2019s receivables purchase agreements. Sellers of receivables were informed through brokers such as Lee that ARC would be migrating its receivables purchase agreements to the CS Platform run by the 1st plaintiff. Another change was that sole proprietorships such as VP would not be permitted to list and sell receivables on the CS Platform. However, in the event that the owner of a sole proprietorship were to incorporate a company to carry on the same business as the sole proprietorship, the 1st plaintiff would allow the said company to list and sell receivables on the CS Platform. 25', '20\\u2003The 1st defendant was then incorporated on 10 May 2016. It is disputed as to whether Chin had specifically requested that the 2nd defendant incorporate a company so that the 2nd plaintiff could continue providing financing to VP. 26', 'In any event, on 18 May 2016 prior to the CS Platform going live, the 1st defendant entered into a written receivables purchase agreement with ARC (\u201cthe VPM RPA\u201d).', '21\\u2003On 16 June 2016, Chin informed the 2nd defendant by e-mail that all directors of member companies were required to provide the 2nd plaintiff with a guarantee in the form of a deed poll of guarantee and indemnity (\u201cthe Guarantee\u201d). Chin\u2019s e-mail reiterated that the arrangement to sell the receivables was on an undisclosed or \u201cnon-notified basis\u201d (see [12] above). 27', 'Chin sent the 2nd defendant a follow-up e-mail on 29 June 2016 reminding her to sign the Guarantee by 8 July 2016. 28', '22\\u2003On 1 July 2016, the 2nd plaintiff sent an e-mail to the 2nd defendant containing a hyperlink to view and sign a number of relevant documents for the CS Platform, namely the membership application form, the terms and conditions (\u201cCS T&Cs\u201d), the members\u2019 guide (which was known as the Member Guidance), the fee schedule and the privacy notice. 29', 'These documents constituted the membership agreement, which I will refer to as the \u201cCS Membership Agreement\u201d.', '23\\u2003The 2nd defendant signed the Guarantee on 4 July 2016, guaranteeing payment for the 1st defendant\u2019s repurchase obligations under the CS T&Cs. 30', 'Following that, on 13 October 2016, she filled up the online membership application form acknowledging that she had, on behalf of the 1st defendant, read and accepted the documents mentioned at [22] above which had been incorporated into the membership application form. 31', 'She signed the form electronically in her capacity as the director of the 1st defendant. 32', 'The 1st defendant thereby became a member of the CS Platform.', '24\\u2003Under the CS T&Cs, each sale and purchase took effect as an unconditional sale and purchase of the entire legal and beneficial interest in the said receivable, and the seller agreed to assign the receivable to the investor with full title guarantee. The 2nd plaintiff was appointed by the respective investors as the collection and administrative agent to handle matters relating to the receivable in question. If the 2nd plaintiff so required, the seller would perfect the assignment of the receivables to the investors by giving notice to the customers to pay the receivables to the 2nd plaintiff. The seller was obliged to act as the investors\u2019 agent to collect payment of the receivables from the customers, and then hold such payment on trust for the investors and remit it to the 2nd plaintiff. 33', 'A notice of repayment would be issued to the seller, setting out the invoice details and terms upon which the receivable was purchased. Sellers were required to provide the 2nd plaintiff with a notice of assignment for each assignment of a receivable. 34', '25\\u2003The 1st defendant subsequently listed 60 receivables (\u201cthe Traded Debts\u201d) on the CS Platform for sale to investors. The Traded Debts were in respect of 60 tax invoices issued by the 1st defendant to six of its customers (\u201cthe Customers\u201d), and were purchased by investors (including the 3rd to 46th plaintiffs) by way of a bidding process. 35', 'The consideration for the sale of each receivable was 80% of the invoice amount, less an origination fee. 36', 'The total advance sum paid by the investors in respect of the 60 Traded Debts was $6,885,840. 37', 'The plaintiffs own a 99.312% share of this sum, which amounts to $6,783,433.86. 38', '26\\u2003The respective payment dates for all 60 Traded Debts have expired. The Traded Debts were not paid by the 1st defendant as required under the CS T&Cs, and thus became \u201cdisputed debts\u201d within the meaning of cl 17.1 of the CS T&Cs. The 1st defendant was required under the CS T&Cs to pay the repurchase price and a repurchase fee. The 2nd plaintiff thus issued repurchase demands dated 29 March, 30 March and 7 August 2017 to the 1st defendant in respect of the 60 Traded Debts, requiring the 1st defendant to repurchase them and to pay the stated repurchase price. The 1st defendant has not done so. 39', '27\\u2003On 30 March 2017, the plaintiffs\u2019 solicitors issued letters to the Customers giving notice of assignment of the Traded Debts, enclosing copies of the notice of assignment and other relevant documents, and demanding payment of the Traded Debts. One of the Customers, Evershine Services Pte Ltd (\u201cEvershine\u201d), responded by e-mail on 30 March 2017 stating that it had never heard of the 1st defendant and had no dealings with it. The 2nd plaintiff then got in touch with four out of five of the other Customers by telephone and was informed by them that they did not have any dealings with the 1st defendant either. 40', 'Fish & Co Restaurants Pte Ltd (\u201cFish & Co\u201d), who was one of the four Customers whom the 2nd plaintiff had contacted by telephone, followed up by e-mail on 5 April 2017 stating that it had looked at the purchase orders attached to the notice of assignment of receivables, and concluded that they were falsified documents with fake and duplicated signatures. 41', '28\\u2003The plaintiffs\u2019 position is that the invoices in respect of Evershine and Fish & Co were fabricated. 42', 'The plaintiffs further plead that they have reason to believe that all the underlying tax invoices for the remaining Traded Debts were similarly fabricated. 43', 'The defendants\u2019 pleaded case in this respect is that the allegations are not admitted and that the plaintiffs are put to strict proof. 44', 'This is a point that I return to below.', '29\\u2003The 2nd plaintiff filed a police report against the defendants on 2 April 2017.

{"casename":"2018_SGHC_30","fact":"'4\\u2003The material factual background and chronology of events leading to the DC Suit may be described as follows.', '5\\u2003The condominium development known as YAP was completed in 1986 and was built to full development intensity. Although YAP had a paid-up gross floor area (\u201cGFA\u201d) of 82,593.028 sq m, only 80,041 sq m had been utilised by 1996.', '6\\u2003On 25 September 1996, the MCST of YAP at the time applied under the Planning Act (Cap 232, 1990 Ed) (\u201cthe Planning Act\u201d) to the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Singapore (\u201cURA\u201d) to obtain approval to convert the roof terraces of the penthouses and townhouses to family halls. On 22 November 1996, the URA issued its written permission for the proposed additions and alterations in the MCST\u2019s application (hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe 1996 WP\u201d). As a result, YAP was deemed to have incurred additional GFA of 1034.94 sq m. However, by 22 November 1998, which was the date on which the 1996 WP lapsed, none of the properties concerned was given approval by the MCST to carry out the additions and alterations which were the subject of the 1996 WP. In other words, although the URA had granted permission for the proposed works, separate and further approval had to be sought from the MCST in order for the said additions and alterations to be carried out, and this had not been obtained for any of the units concerned.', '7\\u2003The issues pertaining to the proposed additions and alterations which formed the subject of the 1996 WP laid dormant for some time until 2004. On 3 June 2004, the MCST was copied a letter from the URA to the architects of the owner of Block 331 #15-01, who had proposed to retain some addition-and-alteration works that would have consumed the GFA of YAP. In the letter, the URA had informed the owner of Block 331 #15-01 that it was unable to waive the \u201crequirement for the owner to declare that the subsidiary owners of condominium development ha[d] no objection to the development potential and baseline [ie, the GFA] being consumed by the retention proposal\u201d. The URA explained that this was because \u201cthe development potential and baseline [were] tied to the land and hence belong[ed] to the subsidiary proprietors collectively.\u201d In this regard, it appears that although the URA had rejected the owner\u2019s request for waiver on the basis that it was not the URA\u2019s prerogative to waive the other subsidiary proprietors\u2019 consent for additional GFA to be consumed, the MCST had taken the URA\u2019s position to be that the retention of structures in a subsidiary proprietor\u2019s unit would not be approved as long as additional GFA was consumed.', '8\\u2003Concerns pertaining to unauthorised structures in YAP such as those which surfaced in the case of the owner of Block 331 #15-01 appeared to gain traction in the years that followed. On 15 January 2005, the 18th Annual General Meeting (\u201cAGM\u201d) of YAP was convened. The managing agent at the time briefed the meeting on the status of unauthorised structures erected within subsidiary proprietors\u2019 units in YAP. Members who attended the general meeting were noted to have raised various concerns over the existence of such structures. The discussion culminated with the minutes stating that \u201cthere was a strong consensus at (the meeting) that such unauthorised structures and alterations must be addressed and removed\u201d. It appears however that these issues were only ventilated again after they were raised in the course of YSL\u2019s proposal in 2006 to undertake construction works on his property.', '9\\u2003In March 2006, YSL bought a penthouse unit at YAP and became the owner of Blk 327 #25-01 (\u201cYSL\u2019s unit\u201d). About this time, the 19th MCST took office as well. In the GD at [2], the DJ characterised March 2006 as the \u201cstart of the tumult that led to these cross-claims that reached across more than half a decade\u201d.', '10\\u2003YSL\u2019s unit came with an existing roof terrace structure which the previous subsidiary proprietor had constructed, apparently without obtaining the MCST\u2019s approval to undertake addition-and-alteration works during the subsistence of the 1996 WP. On 11 August 2006, YSL\u2019s architect wrote to the YAP condominium manager to \u201crevalidate\u201d the 1996 WP as he proposed to enhance the existing staircase leading to the roof garden. This would have consumed additional GFA, but YSL\u2019s architect proposed to offset this by reducing the approved family hall area on the roof, such that overall there would not be any net consumption of GFA. On this basis, YSL\u2019s architect proceeded to apply to the URA on 3 September 2006 for the proposed additions and alterations involving the staircase enhancement works. However, the next day on 4 September 2006, YAP\u2019s condominium manager replied to YSL\u2019s architect, rejecting the application to undertake the proposed staircase enhancement works at YSL\u2019s unit. The letter stated as follows:', '11\\u2003On 2 October 2006, Mr Clement Lim of the URA replied to YSL\u2019s architect, stating that as the proposed staircase enhancement works would consume additional GFA, the URA required written confirmation by the MCST that a 90% resolution of the MCST had been passed approving of YSL\u2019s proposed renovation works. The relevant portion of Mr Clement Lim\u2019s letter stated as follows:', '12\\u2003Pursuant to the correspondence with YSL\u2019s architect, Mr Clement Lim attended at YSL\u2019s unit on 29 October 2006 to inspect YSL\u2019s roof terrace. During the inspection, Mr Clement Lim found that the structures on the roof terrace conformed to the dimensions approved by the URA in 1996. Thus, on 30 October 2006, Mr Clement Lim wrote an email to YSL\u2019s architect stating that insofar as the GFA which would be incurred by the proposed staircase enhancement works could be offset by reducing the existing roof terrace structures on YSL\u2019s unit, the URA had no issue with the proposed works. This was on the basis that no additional GFA would be consumed overall. Mr Clement Lim\u2019s email stated as follows:', '13\\u2003It appears, however, that Mr Clement Lim had proceeded on the assumption that the roof terrace structures on YSL\u2019s unit had been built after having received all the requisite approvals, including that of the MCST, for its construction. YSL\u2019s architect proceeded in any event to follow up on the URA\u2019s advice by writing to the MCST on 13 November 2006 for its endorsement of the proposed works. Further communications with the YAP condominium manager, however, were unavailing. YSL was later informed that the MCST would be consulting its lawyers for a legal opinion.', '14\\u2003YSL expressed his concern over the delay since his submission on 11 August 2006, and how despite having obtained the URA\u2019s opinion (as suggested by the condominium manager) that there was no GFA increment arising from his proposed additions and alterations, the MCST appeared unhappy with the URA\u2019s position.', '15\\u2003On the MCST\u2019s part, it appears that the concern at the time was that, although the proposed staircase enhancement works would not consume additional GFA, YSL\u2019s unit had existing roof terrace structures that had already consumed additional GFA under the 1996 WP but without the MCST\u2019s prior approval or authorisation. In other words, it was no answer for YSL to suggest \u201coffsetting\u201d the GFA consumed by the proposed works by reducing the family hall area on the roof. This was because YSL was essentially proposing to preserve the status quo, under which his unit would continue to consume additional GFA of YAP that was never authorised. The MCST\u2019s concerns were amplified in December 2006 when they obtained legal advice from WongPartnership LLP indicating that the retention of unauthorised structures would consume the GFA of YAP and affect the other subsidiary proprietors.', '16\\u2003Pursuant to the apparent deadlock in the approval process for the proposed works, YSL filed an application to the Strata Titles Board (\u201cSTB\u201d) on 20 December 2006 against the MCST and its members by way of STB 106\/2006, to secure inspection of \u201cthe records and documents of the [MCST] immediately\u201d. The proceedings in STB 106\/2006 reached a mediated settlement, by which YSL was allowed to inspect the MCST\u2019s records and documents. YSL, however, proceeded to submit resolutions for the 20th AGM, where members of the new MCST were to be elected, by which he sought to move that (a) any MCST member who was derelict and caused loss to the MCST should be held liable for any such loss; and (b) any such member should be barred from vying for a position on the MCST (\u201cthe Resolutions\u201d).', '17\\u2003In January 2007, the MCST again sought legal advice on YSL\u2019s proposed staircase enhancement works, by consulting Drew & Napier LLC on whether the retention of unauthorised structures would consume the GFA of YAP and affect other subsidiary proprietors of YAP.', '18\\u2003On 2 February 2007, YSL filed a further application before the STB (STB 10\/2007) against the MCST for \u201c[a]n interim order to the [MCST] to endorse the proposed additions and alterations as submitted to the [MCST] on 11th August 2006 and amended on 13th November 2006 for [YSL\u2019s] submission to the relevant authorities for further approvals.\u201d', '19\\u2003Following these events, the MCST released a \u201cspecial edition\u201d newsletter in March 2007, which forms the subject of YSL\u2019s claim in libel. This newsletter was released ostensibly in an attempt to clarify the issues surrounding the use of YAP\u2019s GFA and to set out the background of the various disputes which emerged as a result. I set out the text of the said newsletter in full, with the words at which YSL took offence emphasised in italics (at paragraphs 12 and 14 of the newsletter):', '20\\u2003On 31 March 2007, the 20th AGM of the MCST was held. As noted above, elections for members of the new MCST were to be held at this meeting. Pursuant to the MCST seeking legal advice from Drew & Napier LLC in January 2007, Mr Jimmy Yim SC (\u201cMr Yim SC\u201d) addressed the meeting, stating that the present MCST was not selectively prosecuting anyone for the removal of the unauthorised structures at the penthouses nor were they aggressively pursuing an agenda of their own to prohibit any subsidiary proprietors from carrying out addition-and-alteration works according to the by-laws and other statutory requirements. Mr Yim SC also stated that the matter was pending clarification from the planning authorities. YSL subsequently agreed to withdraw the Resolutions after clarification had been obtained. In addition, YSL withdrew STB 10\/2007 on 11 June 2007.', '21\\u2003On 3 August 2007, and pursuant to clarifications sought from the URA, the MCST received an email from one Ms Catherine Lau of the URA, which contained the following advice:', '(a)\\u2003Generally, for proposed addition-and-alteration works within a strata unit, the respective unit owner\u2019s consent would suffice for the URA to grant planning permission.', '(b)\\u2003But if the addition-and-alteration works incurred additional GFA, approval from the MCST in the form of a \u201c90% resolution\u201d would be required.', '22\\u2003In response to the MCST\u2019s queries on the perceived inconsistency between the URA\u2019s position regarding YSL\u2019s submission (which the URA appeared to support), and that of the subsidiary proprietor of Block 331 #15-01 in 2004 (which the URA appeared not to support - see above at [7]), Ms Catherine Lau explained the differences between the two cases as follows:', '(a)\\u2003In the case of the subsidiary proprietor of Block 331 #15-01, the URA noted that the proposal to retain the addition-and-alteration works was not consistent with the approved plans granted under the 1996 WP as it would consume additional GFA, of about 10 sq m more than what was previously permitted under those plans. The URA therefore took the position that his proposal affected the GFA of YAP, and hence required him to obtain consent from the other subsidiary proprietors of YAP in his submission.', '(b)\\u2003In YSL\u2019s case, the proposed works were consistent with the approved plans granted under the 1996 WP as they would not incur GFA in addition to what was previously permitted under those plans. This was confirmed by the site inspection performed by Mr Clement Lim, where it was observed that any additional GFA consumed by the enlarged staircase would be offset by a reduction of GFA consumed by the roof terrace structures. YSL\u2019s submission was therefore \u201csignificantly different from the 2004 [Block 331 #15-01] submission, as it involved only new A&A works and no additional GFA.\u201d In the premises, the URA did not consider that further clearance was needed from the MCST in YSL\u2019s submission.', '23\\u2003On 12 September 2007, the MCST\u2019s lawyers wrote back to Ms Catherine Lau, essentially stating that YSL\u2019s unit had not complied with the MCST\u2019s requirements in undertaking addition-and-alteration works under the 1996 WP. The MCST\u2019s lawyers went on to query the URA on a number of points. One of these was that, since YAP \u201cwas deemed to have incurred additional GFA of 1,034.94 sq m\u201d when the 1996 WP was issued, whether this deemed GFA \u201chad in effect reverted\u201d to YAP upon the lapsing of the 1996 WP when none of the penthouse or townhouse owners had carried out the approved works. Mr Clement Lim of the URA replied on 27 September 2007, stating that the URA did not see any issue of unconsumed GFA that would need to be reverted to development potential since the existing roof terrace structures had already been constructed in accordance with the 1996 WP\u2019s approved plans. As for the MCST\u2019s contention that the previous owner of YSL\u2019s unit had not complied with their requirements in undertaking the addition-and-alteration works, Mr Clement Lim stated that it would be up to the MCST to follow up on their own approval requirements for the installed structures.', '24\\u2003The MCST\u2019s lawyers followed up with further queries on 28 January 2008, asking if the URA had verified if YSL\u2019s roof terrace structures had been installed during the validity of the 1996 WP and, if the structures were installed after the expiry of planning approval, whether the URA would approve such structures retrospectively. The URA replied on 3 March 2008 declining to respond to the lawyers\u2019 queries as they considered them to be \u201chypothetical\u201d.', '25\\u2003At the same time, the MCST\u2019s lawyers commenced a parallel set of enquiries with the Ministry of National Development (\u201cMND\u201d) on the same issue. On 26 August 2008, the MND replied with their position as follows:', '26\\u2003Following these events, YSL circulated open letters on seven separate occasions between 6 February 2010 and 6 February 2013 to YAP\u2019s residents, which, in broad terms, called into question the integrity and fitness of the DCA 12 Appellants as members of the MCST. YSL\u2019s allegations included claims relating to how the DCA 12 Appellants handled the issue of YSL\u2019s addition-and-alteration works. The seven letters formed the subject of the DCA 12 Appellants\u2019 counterclaim in libel in the DC Suit below. Although the DC Suit was filed in 2011, it did not proceed to trial until March 2016, as a related action was commenced in Suit No 112\/2013 in the High Court against YSL for defamation. That action was settled by YSL, and the counterclaim in the DC Suit was filed thereafter in October 2014.', '27\\u2003The defamatory statements with which YSL took issue were statements published in the MCST\u2019s \u201cspecial edition\u201d newsletter of March 2007 (see [19] above) that sought to address legal issues relating to unauthorised structures in YAP. For ease of reference, I reproduce the relevant statements as follows:', 'These will be referred to respectively as \u201cthe Para 12 Statement\u201d and \u201cthe Para 14 Statement\u201d, and collectively as \u201cthe Statements\u201d.', '28\\u2003In YSL\u2019s Statement of Claim, it was pleaded that the defamatory meanings of the Statements were that:', '(a)\\u2003If YSL\u2019s addition-and-alteration works were approved, YAP\u2019s available GFA would be diminished;', '(b)\\u2003YSL had sought to compel the MCST to allow his disputed addition-and-alteration works despite the fact that this would affect and diminish the available GFA of YAP to the detriment of the other subsidiary proprietors;', '(c)\\u2003YSL \u201csought to utilize part of the unused GFA allocation of [YAP] to the detriment of\u201d YAP;', '(d)\\u2003YSL intended to act in \u201ca manner that was prejudicial to the [MCST]\u201d;', '(e)\\u2003YSL\u2019s seeking approval in these circumstances was unreasonable and \u201cdetrimental to [the MCST]\u201d; and', '(f)\\u2003YSL \u201chad disregarded the interests of the other Subsidiary Proprietors and occupiers of [YAP]\u201d.', '29\\u2003In the DCA 11 Appellants\u2019 Defence, they pleaded that the natural and ordinary meanings of the Statements were that \u201cthe Defendants at the material time believed that [YSL\u2019s] Disputed Works would result in [YSL] using the GFA allocation of Yong An Park to the detriment of the other SPs and occupiers of Yong An Park\u201d, and were fair comment on a matter of public interest as they related to community co-existence amid strata titled apartments.'"}

Therefore, on 17 November 2016, the Architect issued Architect\u2019s Direction No 1 requiring Milan to take specific steps to secure compliance with the Contract. 12', 'These specific steps included the obtaining of the \u201cPermit to Commence Work from BCA, ERSS and LTA (Rail)\u201d.', '14\\u2003On 24 November 2016, Milan\u2019s PE submitted the ERSS plans and an application for the LTA-Rail Permit to the LTA. 13', 'The LTA responded on 7 December 2016 stating they would not process the submission until the Architect resubmitted a fresh notice of approval of the development proposal since the Initial Architect was no longer supervising the Project. 14', 'On 9 December 2016, the Architect duly notified the LTA and the BCA that it was the new architect for the Project and assumed responsibility for the previous architect\u2019s approvals. 15', 'According to the Architect\u2019s email update to Milan, the LTA noted the change in Architect and allowed Milan to proceed with the LTA-Rail Permit submission concurrently.

The BCA responded with a written direction dated 23 January 2017 20', 'requiring more documentation, including a soil investigation report and the LTA\u2019s clearance letter for the design of the ERSS. In other words, it seems that without the LTA\u2019s prior clearance of the ERSS, which was still pending, the BCA would not grant the BCA-ERSS Permit. Based on the evidence before me, it is not clear whether Milan\u2019s PE managed to submit this additional documentation by the BCA\u2019s deadline of 6 February 2017 or whether the application was allowed to lapse.', '17\\u2003On 20 January 2017, the Structural Engineer applied for the BCA Permit.

After he reached the carpark of the Block and found out that an Indian man had earlier slashed an Indian woman and fled the scene, he realised that he might have just seen the assailant and thus went to look for the assailant in his car. He next saw the assailant along Jurong West Avenue 1 and observed that a Chinese man was trying to stop the assailant from running away. He immediately approached the assailant. By then, the assailant had stopped running but was \u201cvery aggressive and hostile\u201d.

Christopher decided to give chase to the Accused. He thus stopped his car and pursued the Accused on foot. When the Accused saw Christopher, the Accused tried to run away but Christopher managed to catch up. Eventually, Christopher stopped the Accused and called the police hotline. He then told the Accused to sit down as the police were on their way. The Accused repeatedly told Christopher in English that he would go to the police station himself. A few minutes later, a Malay man (presumably Hanif) arrived and asked the Accused why he had hurt the girl. Christopher could not recall what the Accused\u2019s response was.

{"casename":"2018_SGHC_35","fact":"facts  which he asserts, must prove that those facts exist. \nSections 104 and 105 are also relevant.  All said, the plaintiff has to prove her \ncase. In particular,  she has to prove that the nodule  in her lung was malignant at \nall of  those points in time.  \n22 As for the defendants, they have not only denied the plaintiff\u2019s  claim but \nraised a positive  assertion in their defence  to defeat the plaintiff\u2019s case, namely \nthat the plaintiff\u2019s nodule was benign and only turned  malignant post July 2011. \nIf they succeed in raising this defence, it would necessarily undermine the \nplaintiff\u2019s assertion  that her cancer  was malignant, and she would fail to fulfil \nher burden  of proving that  she had  cancer  at all the material times. \nThe expert evidence\n23 Expert evidence was adduced by both parties  in relation to the cause and \ndevelopment of the plaintiff\u2019s cancer. The plaintiff\u2019s  expert witness, Dr Breen, \nis the lead respiratory physician for lung cancer services  and a consultant in \nrespiratory medicine  in Galway  University Hospital in Ireland. His primary \nspecialty is the diagnosis and staging  of lung cancer. Patients suspected  of \nhaving lung cancer are referred to Dr Breen, who then investigates, diagnoses,  \nstages and decides  on the management of the particular lung cancer. Prof Goh,  \nthe defendants\u2019 expert witness, is a senior consultant in medical  oncology and \n10\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nNoor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v\nChangi General Hospital  Pte Ltd [2018]  SGHC  35\nthe head of the department of haematology-oncology  in the National  University \nCancer Institute, Singapore  and director of the investigational medicine  unit in \nthe National University Health System, Singapore.  He is a clinician scientist, \nmeaning that beyond  patient management, he also researches the biology of \nmalignancy, and has published on the plaintiff\u2019s  specific cancer,  ie, non-small \ncell lung cancer.  In relation to the cause and development of the plaintiff\u2019s \ncancer, for the reasons stated in this Judgment, I prefer Prof Goh\u2019s evidence, \nwhich is rooted in his qualifications and experience. Conversely, Dr Breen \nadmitted that he does not practice  oncology.  Although he leads a tumour board,  \nwhich makes collective decisions about the management of a patient\u2019s cancer, \nsuch boards have multidisciplinary representation precisely  because each \nmember lacks intimate knowledge of areas outside his specialty. Dr Breen\u2019s \nexperience is therefore  of limited utility when considering the cause and \nprognosis of the  plaintiff\u2019s  cancer.\n24 As stated above, the plaintiff was diagnosed  with lung cancer in 2012, \nand the ALK-positive  status discovered in 2014. Prof Goh,  the Hospital\u2019s  \nexpert, explained that the plaintiff\u2019s ALK-positive  non-small cell lung cancer \ndeveloped from the rare fusion of two genes,  namely the ALK  gene and the \nEML4 gene, resulting in the EML4-ALK fusion gene. Medical knowledge of \nsuch a gene fusion only began to be acquired  around 2007. It is not known what \ncauses this gene fusion to occur. The ALK  gene  encodes a receptor (able to \nreceive chemical signals from outside a cell) called tyrosine kinase, and upon \nactivation by two of these receptors  binding to each other, it can stimulate cell \nproliferation (ie, an increase in the number  of cells).  The ALK  gene is usually \nnot expressed in human tissues but with the abovementioned fusion, the gene is \nexpressed on the cell membrane and is continually activated. This means it can \ncontinually send growth signals to the nucleus of the cells,  and more \n11\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nNoor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v\nChangi General Hospital  Pte Ltd [2018]  SGHC  35\nimportantly, it is oncogenic (ie, having the potential to cause cancer) and can \ntransform what  was initially  benign  cells into malignant (ie, cancerous)  cells. \nDr Daniel Tan agreed with this description. Notably,  Prof Goh also stated  that \nEML4-ALK fusion gene cannot  exist in benign cells and thus the presence of \nthe fusion gene means  that there is cancer.  \n25 According  to Prof Goh,  the ALK-positive lung cancer is aggressive in \nnature. However, the plaintiff\u2019s nodule was stable  and indolent from  2007 to \n2011, which is inconsistent with the behaviour of an ALK-positive cancer. \nThus, Prof Goh opined  that the plaintiff\u2019s nodule was likely to be initially  \nbenign scar tissue, but acquired the ALK gene fusion at some point in 2011 to \n2012, resulting  in a malignancy. Importantly, the juxtaposition of the slow \ngrowth of the nodule between 2007 and 2011 against the aggressive spread of \nthe disease in 2012 and 2014 (which  was when the plaintiff\u2019s cancer  recurred \nafter the lobectomy) leads to the conclusion that the nodule was not malignant \nfrom 2007  to 2011. If the nodule  was malignant in 2007, he would have \nexpected it to grow a lot faster than it did between 2007 and 2011. This means  \nthat when the plaintiff consulted the respective  defendant-doctors,  her nodule \nwas benign.\n26 The plaintiff contends  that she may already have had a different form of \nslow-growing lung cancer before  the gene fusion occurred. This stemmed from  \nDr Breen\u2019s suggestion that mutations could occur at any stage  within a cancer. \nAlternatively, the plaintiff argues  that the gene fusion (and thus her cancer) \noccurred before July 2011 but was simply slow-growing,  thus the indolence of \nthe nodule. Dr Breen stated that some ALK-positive lung cancers were  not \naggressive in nature, which Prof Goh agreed with.  Dr Daniel Tan also testified \nthat he would not conclude that the ALK-positive  lung cancers were aggressive \n12\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nNoor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v\nChangi General Hospital  Pte Ltd [2018]  SGHC  35\nbecause these cancers were usually diagnosed as ALK-positive only at Stage  \nIV, and knowledge of the history of the ALK-positive disease was limited. In \nrelation to the plaintiff\u2019s cancer,  Dr Daniel  Tan stated that he would not \nconclude that the relapse of the plaintiff\u2019s cancer could be considered \naggressive. The plaintiff\u2019s chance of relapse  was assessed to be 50% within five \nyears, and her relapse  after two years four months did not go one way or the \nother towards assessing her cancer\u2019s aggressiveness. Dr Daniel Tan was the \nplaintiff\u2019s treating oncologist called  as a witness of fact to testify  on her \ntreatment and future medical care. His past experience with ALK-positive  lung \ncancer concerned patients with Stage IV cancer.  Hence, he could not comment \non the aggressiveness of the cancer based on the  timing of plaintiff\u2019s relapse. \nThe court\u2019s finding\n27 The plaintiff does not have any definitive  medical evidence showing that \nshe had cancer from 2007 to 2011. Dr Breen  acknowledged as much \u2013 when \nasked whether he had any view regarding  when the nodule became cancerous, \nhe stated that \u201c[it] is impossible  to state at any stage which of these lesions was \na cancerous lesion. All we know  is that there was a nodule there\u201d.  He stated that \n\u201c[we] cannot state what  the pathology  was because  we didn\u2019t have the pathology  \nat the beginning\u201d.  Thus, the court\u2019s  finding  has to be based  on other evidence \npointing to the nodule\u2019s  benignity or malignancy  from 2007 to 2011, such as \nthe nodule\u2019s growth and its features as reflected in the X-rays. The radiological \nevidence does not show whether the nodule is malignant or benign; what it \nshows is the size, shape and growth of the nodule, and the expert evidence was \nadduced towards interpreting the  significance  of these features.\n28 I have considered  that the case is slightly more difficult in relation  to Dr \nSoh\u2019s consultation in July 2011. By November 2011 the plaintiff already  had \n13\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nNoor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v\nChangi General Hospital  Pte Ltd [2018]  SGHC  35\nblood in her sputum and was referred to A\/Prof Sridhar. The short timeframe of \nmonths between Dr Soh\u2019s  consultation and the plaintiff\u2019s visit to Dr Wong and \nA\/Prof Sridhar makes  it possible to argue  that malignancy had already occurred  \nby July 2011. Plainly, the plaintiff  bears  the burden of proving that she had \ncancer at all the material  times. In my view,  the plaintiff has not established on \na balance of probabilities that she already had cancer in July 2011. With Prof \nGoh\u2019s opinion on the cause of her cancer  in mind, which I will come to, there \nwas little evidence to indicate in July 2011 that the gene fusion had occurred  \nand the nodule in her right lung had turned  malignant. Even  when the plaintiff \nsaw A\/Prof Sridhar, he still treated  her conservatively initially and the CT scan \nperformed in December  2011  showed features  that were reported by the \nradiologist to be benign. I thus find that she cannot prove on the balance of \nprobabilities that she already  had cancer in July 2011 when she consulted with \nDr Soh. \n29 In my view,  the defendants  are able to show on a balance of probabilities \nbased on Prof Goh\u2019s opinion that the plaintiff\u2019s  nodule was initially  benign. This \nopinion is further  supported by the other  medical  evidence on the nodule\u2019s  \nstability and the lack of features  indicating  malignancy. I will go through  the \nradiological evidence  in some detail.  The Hospital called Dr Lynette Teo (\u201cDr \nTeo\u201d) as an expert witness. Dr Teo is a senior  consultant in the National \nUniversity Cancer Institute, Singapore, and Department of Diagnostic  Imaging, \nNational University of Singapore. She has about  11 years of experience as a \nspecialist in radiology. \n30 Four X-rays  were taken  of the plaintiff  from  2007 to 2011. The first is \nthe October  2007 X-ray, which was ordered by Dr Yeo in the A&E Department, \nand was the first time the plaintiff\u2019s  nodule was noticed as an incidental finding. \n14\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nNoor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v\nChangi General Hospital  Pte Ltd [2018]  SGHC  35\nAll four X-rays  were  eventually reported, and the nodule measured, by the \nHospital\u2019s radiologists, but the October and November 2007 X-rays  were \nretrospectively reported  in 2012. This means that in 2007, radiological reports \nof the X-ray were not prepared and thus unavailable. The plaintiff\u2019s witness, Dr \nTan, and the defendants\u2019 expert, Dr Teo, also measured the nodule in these X-\nrays. Their measurements were:\nOctober 2007 X-ray\nNovember 2007 X-ray\nApril 2010 X-ray\nJuly 2011  X-\nray\nRadiological reports\n1.537 cm x 1.44 cm\nNo measurement\n1.9 cm 2.6 x 2.2 cm\nDr Tan 1.5 cm 1.5 cm 1.9 cm 2.3 cm\nDr Teo 1.72 x 1.88 cm\n1.77 x 1.77 cm\n1.73 x 2.38 cm\n2.13 x 2.47 cm\n31 In relation to the method and accuracy of measurements, Dr Teo \nexplained (and this was not disputed by Dr Breen) that there is inter-  and intra-\nobserver variability in a nodule\u2019s measurement. This means  that two \nradiologists may reasonably take different measurements of the same nodule, \nand one radiologist may take different measurements of the same nodule at \ndifferent times. Hence,  to determine a nodule\u2019s development in size, the \nmeasurements taken by one person  in one sitting are most  accurate. \nMeasurements taken of nodules could  vary up to 10-20%. Smaller nodules have \na higher margin of tolerance. As a result, the measurements  of the nodule by the \nradiologists who reported the X-rays,  Dr Tan, and Dr Teo differed as between \neach other by around 2-3mm.  Dr Tan and Dr Teo\u2019s  set of measurements for the \n15\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nNoor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v\nChangi General Hospital  Pte Ltd [2018]  SGHC  35\nfour X-rays  showed slight increases  in the size of the nodule from October 2007 \nto July  2011. \n32 This is an appropriate juncture  to consider  the plaintiff\u2019s case that the \nnodule measured 2.2cm  as early as 15 November  2007. Compared with the \nmeasurements on 31 October 2007, this would have  meant a doubling time of \nmerely nine days. Mr Rai, the plaintiff\u2019s  counsel, bases this on Dr Rameysh  \nDanovani bin Mahmood (\u201cDr Rameysh\u201d)\u2019s April 2010 X-ray  report, wherein \nDr Rameysh  noted \u201c[a] rounded opacity measuring approximately 2.2cm is seen \nin the (R) mid zone, which appears stable since  the previous chest radiograph \ndated 15\/11\/2007\u201d.  The issue to be determined is not what Dr Rameysh \nperceived the nodule  size to be on 29 April  2010, but its actual size as recorded \non the reports. In this regard, several witnesses have come forth to give evidence  \nthat the nodule grew in an indolent way.  More importantly, Dr Rameysh has \nsince relooked at the Dicom images of the X-rays in the course  of preparing  his \nAffidavit of Evidence-in-Chief and concluded that the nodule measured \napproximately 1.5cm  on 15 November  2007 and approximately 1.9cm on 29 \nApril 2010.  The inference  that the plaintiff drew  from  Dr Rameysh\u2019s  radiology \nreport was  therefore untenable.\n33 The radiological evidence shows  that the nodule was stable, indicating \nits benignity, from the period  of 2007 to 2011. First,  the slow  rate of growth of \nthe nodule was consistent  with its benignity. I accept Dr Rameysh, Dr Teo, \nAssociate Professor Malcolm Mahadevan  (\u201cA\/Prof Mahadevan\u201d), the \ndefendant-doctors\u2019 emergency medicine expert, and Prof Goh\u2019s evidence that a \nnodule which has slightly  or marginally  increased  in size and\/or did not display \nany clinically significant growth would be regarded  as stable, in contrast  to Dr \nBreen, the only witness who implied that a nodule  could  only be stable if it did \n16\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nNoor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v\nChangi General Hospital  Pte Ltd [2018]  SGHC  35\nnot change at all or if there is calcification  in the nodule. Although the witnesses \nprovided slightly different opinions on what substantial or otherwise clinically \nsignificant growth would entail, this is largely a professional judgment to be \nmade by the radiologist or doctor  when considering  the nodule.  Further,  Prof \nGoh explained that it was not just the growth of the nodule that was significant, \nbut its rate of growth, as benign lesions could grow as well. Thus, even on Dr \nTan\u2019s measurements (1.5cm in 2007 to 1.9cm in 2010), the increase in size over \nthis period would not be considered significant. Based on her measurements, Dr \nTeo opined that the rate of growth of the nodule  was consistent with the nodule \nbeing stable. The April 2010 X-ray report by Dr Rameysh and the July 2011 X-\nray report by Dr Khoo Teng Kew and Dr Mohammad  Taufik also stated  that the \nnodule \u201c[appeared] stable\u201d  and was \u201clargely stable\u201d respectively. A\/Prof \nMahadevan also opined  that the nodule\u2019s rate of growth was not clinically \nsignificant. Given  the consistent evidence,  I accept  that the nodule would have \nbeen considered stable,  and I  so find.  \n34 The plaintiff, through Dr Breen,  argues that there are slow-growing lung \ncancers and the nodule\u2019s  slow growth does not lead to a conclusion  that the \nnodule was benign or malignant. However,  all parties now know that the \nplaintiff has ALK-positive lung cancer.  Prof Goh explained that this cancer  is \ngenerally aggressive, and the behaviour of the plaintiff\u2019s cancer in 2012 and \n2014 in fact reflected this aggressiveness.  Thus it is unlikely that the nodule\u2019s  \nindolence was a result  of slow-growing cancer.\n35 Second,  the long doubling  time of the nodule (ie, the time taken to \ndouble in size) was also another indicator of its stability  and benignity. Dr Teo \ngave evidence that the doubling time, by her calculations, was 1290 days, in \ncontrast to the usual  doubling time of a malignant  nodule, which was around 30 \n17\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nNoor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v\nChangi General Hospital  Pte Ltd [2018]  SGHC  35\nto 500 days.  The parties also relied on other  medical literature  that placed the \nmedian volume  doubling  time of a malignant nodule at 98 (the Henscheke \npaper) and 149 (the Hasegawa paper). Regardless,  by any measure, according  \nto Dr Teo, the nodule  would still be considered \u201cextremely slow growing\u201d and \nthus unlikely to be malignant.  The plaintiff  relies on Prof Goh\u2019s testimony that \na doubling in size of the nodule in three years would be considered substantial \ngrowth. She argues that the nodule had grown by 26% in diameter between  \nOctober 2007 and April 2011  (based on Dr Tan\u2019s measurements, ie, from 1.5 \ncm to 1.9 cm), translating to a doubling in volume of the nodule, which was \nsubstantial. However, this assumes that the nodule was spherical  in shape, and \nthere was no evidence to suggest so. Dr Teo had in fact stated that the nodule \nwas ovoid. Prof Goh also clarified he meant  \u201cdoubling\u201d of the diameter rather \nthan the volume, although he later acknowledged  that Dr Teo was referring  to \nthe volume doubling time of a nodule,  determined by keying in an average of \nthe length  and width of the nodule measured into an online calculator, and \nagreed with her opinion on that basis, ie, that the volume doubling time of the \nnodule was far longer than  what would be expected  from a malignant nodule. \n36 Third, between  2007 and 2011, there  were no noted features of the \nnodule indicating malignancy. The nodule was described as \u201cnon-specific \nand\u2026 indeterminate in nature\u201d  in the April 2010 X-ray report, \u201cnon-specific in \nnature\u201d in the July 2011 X-ray report, and \u201cround\u201d\/\u201crounded\u201d in the November \n2007, April  2010 and December 2011 X-ray reports. No abnormalities \nindicating malignancy,  such as spiculation (stranding at the edges), cavitation \n(with a cavity, perhaps indicating tuberculosis) or lobulation (looking like lobes,  \nsignalling uneven growth) were noted.\n18\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nNoor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v\nChangi General Hospital  Pte Ltd [2018]  SGHC  35\n37 Fourth, even when the plaintiff  was diagnosed with lung cancer \nfollowing the biopsy  in February 2012, she was clinically staged at Stage I, a \nvery early  stage of her cancer. A few months before that in December  2011, \nwhen she underwent a CT scan, the radiologist  Dr Chan still diagnosed it as a \nbenign pulmonary hamartoma and A\/Prof Sridhar  similarly thought that the \nplaintiff\u2019s nodule  was benign. Although Dr Chan recommended a biopsy (which  \nwas eventually carried out in February  2012), she recommended it for baseline  \nhistological correlation  in view  of the plaintiff\u2019s symptoms (eg, blood  in her \ncough) and known history of smoking, such that there could be a comparison \nwith the results of later scans  and investigations (see [11] above) should \nsubsequent changes  to the nodule occur. Dr Chan had already opined on the \nresults of the CT scan. The point  is that even  in late 2011 and early 2012, both \nA\/Prof Sridhar  and Dr Chan were inclined  towards  the view that her nodule was \nbenign. \n38 Further,  even though Dr Breen repeatedly testified that a CT scan should \nhave been carried out during all the defendants\u2019 consultations  from  2007 to \n2011, he was unable to testify as to what such a CT scan would have  possibly \nshown. This is surprising seeing his insistence on a CT scan and given his \nexperience in staging  and diagnosing lung cancers through these exact  \ndiagnostic tests. As was evident  from the CT scan carried out in December 2011, \neven at this late stage,  the plaintiff\u2019s  nodule was still reported  as benign and \ninferentially it is unlikely  that any previous CT scans carried out would have \nbeen any different.  Finally, even though the plaintiff  claims that her nodule was \nmalignant since 2007, when she was diagnosed four years later, she was only at \nStage I. If she had been suffering from cancer since 2007,  one would not expect \nher to still be at such an early stage of the cancer.  The evidence from the CT \n19\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nNoor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v\nChangi General Hospital  Pte Ltd [2018]  SGHC  35\nscan and biopsy thus shows that it was unlikely that her nodule turned  malignant \nuntil 2012. \n39 Although Prof Goh could not say for certain when the gene fusion \nactually occurred, he was able to opine  that there was no obvious change  in the \nnodule between 2007 and July 2011. Furthermore,  with Prof Goh\u2019s opinion on \nthe cause  of her cancer in mind, there was little evidence to indicate  that in July \n2011 the gene fusion had occurred and the nodule in her right lung had already \nturned malignant. I accept Dr Breen\u2019s  evidence  (which Prof Goh agreed with)  \nthat there are some  ALK-positive lung cancers that do not behave  aggressively, \nbut this misses the point. Other  than the fact that Dr Breen also agreed that ALK-\npositive lung cancers  are generally aggressive, on the evidence, the plaintiff\u2019s \nALK tumour was aggressive in nature, as shown by the microscopic metastasis \nin the plaintiff\u2019s lymph nodes in 2012 and its extensive spread during  the 2014 \nrelapse. The plaintiff\u2019s response to the ALK inhibitor  during the clinical trial \nwas also shorter  than the average patient. The nub of Prof Goh\u2019s evidence  was \nnot simply that the plaintiff\u2019s tumour was aggressive  but that there was a marked  \nchange in the behaviour  of the nodule and the development  of the plaintiff\u2019s \ncondition over the various time points. The nodule\u2019s growth (in millimetres)  \nwas indolent and stable  between 2007 and July 2011 (see [33] above), but was \naggressive in and after 2012.  This thus indicates \u201can obvious change in the \ncharacter of this lesion\u201d.  The discordance between  the nodule\u2019s growth in the \ntwo periods lends credence to Prof Goh\u2019s opinion, which I accept. I also note \nthat the plaintiff did not dispute Dr Chan\u2019s diagnosis of the plaintiff\u2019s nodule as \nbenign, a pulmonary harmatoma, during  the CT scan in December 2011, and no \nexpert had offered a different diagnosis of the CT scan. In view of this, and for \nall the reasons above, I find that the nodule  was initially benign in nature but \nlater became malignant in the period after July 2011 to early February 2012.\n20\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nNoor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v\nChangi General Hospital  Pte Ltd [2018]  SGHC  35\n40 For completeness, Dr Breen  also stated  that certain lung cancers  can be \nslow growing, as \u201cadenocarcinoma  in situ\/minimally invasive adenocarcinoma \ncan be a very prolonged  period or stability\u201d, and thus he \u201c[did] not believe that \nthe original apparent  nodule was not an early  stage  cancer which subsequently \nchanged in growth pattern in subsequent years\u201d. However, this clearly did not \napply in the plaintiff\u2019s case. An adenocarcinoma in situ is also known as Stage \n0 of a cancer, and is reflected in a nodule with ground  glass appearance. Prof \nGoh and Dr Teo\u2019s evidence is that a cancer at Stage 0 (or an adenocarcinoma in \nsitu) could  not have been detected on an X-ray.  This was because  such Stage 0 \nnodules would be ground glass opacities  which were not dense enough  to be \nseen on an X-ray. It was not disputed that the plaintiff\u2019s nodule was visible on \nher first X-ray taken in October 2007. Thus, the plaintiff could not have had an \nadenocarcinoma in situ from 2007 to 2011. When  cross-examined by Ms Kuah, \nDr Breen also agreed that he was not suggesting that the plaintiff\u2019s nodule was \nan adenocarcinoma  in situ  or a minimally invasive adenocarcinoma.\n41 In relation to the plaintiff\u2019s  contention that she had a different form  of \nlung cancer before the gene fusion occurred,  this was not supported  by the \nevidence. Dr Breen had only offered  it as a postulation and when asked  whether \nhe was putting forth  the evidence  that the plaintiff\u2019s cancer was plain \nadenocarcinoma before  transforming into ALK-positive cancer, he simply \nreplied that he \u201c[could not] state what it was at the outset\u201d. Without any other  \nmedical evidence,  the plaintiff  cannot prove that this was what had happened. \nConversely, Prof Goh testified  that it was unlikely that the plaintiff\u2019s nodule \ncommenced as a non-ALK-positive  lung cancer before developing into an \nALK-positive lung cancer. He referred  to the plaintiff\u2019s good response to ALK-\ninhibitors as evidence  that her malignancy was driven by a single gene fusion \ninstead of some other molecular driver.  \n21\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nNoor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v\nChangi General Hospital  Pte Ltd [2018]  SGHC  35\n42 For the reasons stated, the plaintiff cannot  prove that she already had \ncancer in July 2011 during her consultation with Dr Soh. I accept and find that \nthe defendants have, on a balance of probabilities,  established that the plaintiff \ndid not have cancer during the individual consultations  with the defendant-\ndoctors. This conclusion means that causation and loss cannot  be established \nand the plaintiff\u2019s  case in negligence against the defendants cannot  succeed. As \na large part of the complaints against the defendants  is in relation to the \nmanagement of the plaintiff  in not investigating the nodule or referring  her to a \nspecialist, I will now turn to comment on the evidence led as to the staging of \nthe plaintiff\u2019s cancer  and her eventual management. This goes back to the \nplaintiff\u2019s assertion that early detection  would have  meant less severe treatment. \nTreatment of lung cancer from 2012\n43 The medical evidence shows  that the plaintiff was diagnosed at the \nearliest possible stage of her cancer and received the full treatment available to \nher. She did not lose out on any opportunity to take advantage of any available  \ntreatments and did not undergo any treatment that could have been avoided. The \nplaintiff was clinically staged  as Stage I by A\/Prof Sridhar in March 2012 (see \n[11] above),  which was the earliest possible clinical staging. As stated  above at \n[40], a Stage 0 cancer  would not have been  detected  on an X-ray as the nodule \nwould have a ground glass appearance  and would not be visible on an X-ray. \nThe most appropriate treatment for early stage  cancers (it was in fact only \navailable for early stage cancers) was a lobectomy  and adjuvant chemotherapy, \nwhich the plaintiff  underwent. The plaintiff herself accepted  that her lobectomy \nwould have been unavoidable. The adjuvant  chemotherapy was also an \nunavoidable treatment, as it is usually administered  after surgery to eradicate \n22\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nNoor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v\nChangi General Hospital  Pte Ltd [2018]  SGHC  35\nany microscopic traces  of cancer which cannot  be spotted  and reduce  the risk of \nrelapse. Dr Daniel Tan testified  that the plaintiff\u2019s chemotherapy (including its \nextent, ie, four cycles  of vinorelbine-cisplatin) was the standard  treatment for \nearly stage cancers.\n44 Although the plaintiff was later pathologically staged as Stage IIA, such \nstaging, even though more accurate,  was only possible  after the tumour had \nbeen surgically resected. This means that any clinical decision made  on her \ncourse of treatment would have always been  based on her clinical  staging of \nStage I. Regardless, Dr Breen,  A\/Prof Koong (who advised the plaintiff  to \nundergo surgery) and Prof Goh all agreed that even  assuming that it was known \nbefore surgery that the plaintiff would have been  pathologically staged at Stage \nI, the appropriate  course of treatment for her of a lobectomy and adjuvant \nchemotherapy, being the most appropriate  for early stage  cancers, would not \nhave been any different. Dr Daniel  Tan also explained  that the plaintiff\u2019s staging \nwas at the borderline of Stage I and Stage  IIA as far as the size of the tumour \nwas concerned.\n45 The genetic make-up of the plaintiff\u2019s cancer also had certain  \nimplications in terms  of its diagnosis and treatability. The ALK fusion gene was \ndiscovered in 2007, and even in 2009, the medical community was still \nbeginning to understand  whether this gene fusion had any therapeutic  and \noncogenic implications. It was also only in 2009 that proof of concept \ncompletely established that an ALK  inhibitor was the appropriate  response. Dr \nDaniel Tan testified that it was only in 2014 that testing  for the gene became \nmore established and more commonly performed for newly diagnosed Stage IV \nlung cancer. In 2012, although a test was carried out for an EGFR  mutation  \n(which was more commonly known) for the plaintiff, the testing  for the ALK \n23\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nNoor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v\nChangi General Hospital  Pte Ltd [2018]  SGHC  35\nfusion gene, being a relatively new molecular  entity, was not initiated  then. It \nwas only  in 2014, when  the plaintiff\u2019s cancer relapsed, that he  tested for ALK.\n46 Crucially, ALK  inhibitors were  only shown to have utility in or around \n2011, and the first drugs approved for the treatment of ALK-positive cancer \nwere only available for Singapore clinical trials in 2013 or 2014. Even then,  this \nwas only for patients  suffering late stage (Stage IV) cancer. This was why Dr \nDaniel Tan only initiated ALK testing after the plaintiff\u2019s relapse, as ALK  \ninhibitors were unavailable in 2012 and thus the finding would have  made no \ndifference to the management of the plaintiff\u2019s cancer. Prof Goh agreed  with Dr \nDaniel Tan\u2019s assessment.  This meant that the plaintiff had also received the \ntreatment of ALK inhibitors  for her cancer at the earliest available time.\n47 In terms  of her chances of survival, as the plaintiff was diagnosed at an \nearly stage of her cancer (Stage  IIA),  she had, at the time of her diagnosis  in \n2012, a more than even chance of five-year  survival. Prof Goh produced  \nstatistics from a study of non-small cell lung cancer patients who had undergone \nadjuvant chemotherapy after full resection of their tumour. This study found \nthat there  was a 61-62% five-year  survival  rate for Stage IIA patients. Dr Daniel \nTan, who was a factual  witness, produced statistics from the International \nAssociation for the Study  of Lung Cancer that the five-year survival rate for \nStage IIA lung cancer  was 52%, although these statistics  were far more general.  \nAlthough she may have had a slightly higher statistical possibility of survival if \nshe were treated at Stage I (around 72-73%), it is difficult to know, certainly not \non the balance of probabilities, whether this would have made  a difference to \nthe progression of her cancer, which Prof Goh consistently testified  was \naggressive in nature.  I also note that the plaintiff\u2019s  claim for damages is not for \nher shortened life expectancy, but for the cost of her drugs for the next ten years. \n24\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nNoor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v\nChangi General Hospital  Pte Ltd [2018]  SGHC  35\nHer claim  is thus framed in the expectation that she will survive for the next ten \nyears, as  opposed to a shortened  life expectancy.\n48 The foregoing shows that the plaintiff  was able to and did receive the \nfull treatment possible for her lung cancer  since her diagnosis  in 2012. The type \nand extent of her treatment was unfortunately unavoidable in any circumstance, \nand was in fact the best and most  appropriate  treatment she could have received.\nDuty and Breach\n49 Having  found that the plaintiff  did not have  cancer at the material times, \nand that her treatment would have  remained  the same, the plaintiff\u2019s  claim in \nnegligence cannot succeed  without proving  causation. However, I will \nnevertheless evaluate the defendants\u2019 management  of the plaintiff  and comment \non whether it met the applicable standard of care. Regardless of whether  the \nnodule was ultimately  malignant or not, the presence of the nodule in the \nplaintiff\u2019s lung was an abnormality. A doctor exercising reasonable care and \nskill would have still needed to make  a clinical  decision as to how to manage \nthe plaintiff\u2019s nodule. In this case, the plaintiff  had no symptoms that were \nrelated to the nodule  to place her at risk of cancer. Yet her assertions require \npre-symptomatic detection and treatment  of a young person under 35 years of \nage, with no symptoms  of lung cancer,  and had declared herself  as a non-\nsmoker. I will examine the defendant-doctors\u2019 alleged breaches in relation to \ntheir individual consultations with the plaintiff in light of her assertions.

The defendants do not \ndispute that they owed  a duty of care towards  the plaintiff. I thus move on to \ndetermine if the defendants\u2019 duties to the plaintiffs  were breached. The standard \nof care applicable to doctors  was recently canvassed in Hii Chii Kok v Ooi Peng \nJin London Lucien [2017]  SGCA 38 (\u201c Hii Chii  Kok\u201d). \n51 In relation to diagnosis and treatment, the test in Bolam v Friern \nHospital Management  Committee [1957] 1 WLR  582 (\u201cBolam test\u201d) applies  \ntogether with the addendum in Bolitho v City and Hackney Health Authority \n[1998] AC 232 (\u201cBolitho addendum\u201d). In determining whether the professional \nstandard has  been met,  the court has to consider  (Hii Chii Kok  at [76]):\n(a) Whether the defendant\u2019s practice  is supported by a responsible \nbody of medical  opinion within the profession,  even if there is another \nbody of  opinion which  disagrees;\n(b) Whether the expert(s) holding the opinion had directed their \nminds to the comparative risks  and benefits relating to the  matter;\n(c) Whether the opinion was defensible, ie, it was internally \nconsistent and did not contradict relevant extrinsic  facts.\n52 It is not disputed by the parties that the applicable standard of care for \nthe plaintiff\u2019s allegations for diagnosis and treatment  is the Bolam test with the \nBolitho addendum, although the plaintiff\u2019s  claim is largely one of missed  \ndiagnosis as opposed to negligent  treatment. Her claim is not quite that the \n26\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nNoor Azlin Bte Abdul Rahman v\nChangi General Hospital  Pte Ltd [2018]  SGHC  35\ndefendants were negligent when  providing her with treatment (here, either  no \ntreatment or painkillers for her presenting  complaints) but that they did not treat \nher for cancer.

They are also Singapore incorporated companies engaged in the business of providing childcare services for pre-school children. The first defendant was the franchisee of the plaintiff until 31 December 2015, operating a pre-school at 153 Yung Ho Road, #01-41, Singapore 610153 (\u201cthe Premises\u201d) under the Carpe Diem brand and trademark. The second defendant, Chee Fung Mei, is the liquidator of the first defendant. The first defendant was placed in creditors\u2019 voluntary liquidation on 16 January 2016.', '5\\u2003The present dispute stemmed from a decade-long relationship between the plaintiff and the first defendant. In November 2005, the plaintiff and the first defendant entered into a Unit Franchise Agreement (\u201cthe First Agreement\u201d) with the plaintiff as the franchisor and the first defendant as the franchisee. Pursuant to the First Agreement, the first defendant obtained a lease from the Housing and Development Board (\u201cthe HDB\u201d) for the Premises. Thereafter, the first defendant began to operate a pre-school centre at the Premises.', '6\\u2003The First Agreement expired on 1 November 2010. Upon its expiry, the plaintiff and the first defendant entered into a second Unit Franchise Agreement dated 1 November 2010 (\u201cthe Franchise Agreement\u201d). Under the Franchise Agreement, the first defendant was granted franchise rights to operate a childcare and child development centre under the name \u201cCarpe Diem\u201d. At the material time, \u201cCarpe Diem\u201d was a registered trademark in Singapore in the name of the plaintiff.', '7\\u2003The lease with the HDB was subsequently renewed for three-year terms on January 2008, January 2011 and January 2014. The last renewal in January 2014 was for the period 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2016 (\u201cthe Lease\u201d). It was this lease that was the subject of the tussle between the parties. The assignment of the Lease by the first defendant to the fourth defendant was the source of the plaintiff\u2019s dissatisfaction. The plaintiff asserted that it enjoyed rights superior to the fourth defendant\u2019s over the Lease.', '8\\u2003The following clauses of the Franchise Agreement were pertinent (the plaintiff being referred to as \u201cthe Franchisor\u201d and the first defendant being (referred to as the Unit Franchisee\u201d):', 'Clause 28(A)(8) (\u201cthe Option Clause\u201d) was crucial to the plaintiff\u2019s case. The plaintiff asserted an equitable interest in the Lease on the basis of the exercise of the Option Clause. The plaintiff further asserted that the interest which resulted trumped any interest that the fourth defendant acquired in the Lease. It is important to note the plaintiff did not contend that the Option Clause per se conferred an interest in the Lease, ie, the exercise of the Option Clause conferred rights in the plaintiff.', '9\\u2003Separately, despite cl 11(C) of the Franchise Agreement requiring the first defendant to use its best efforts to ensure that the Lease would contain a provision that granted the plaintiff an option for the assignment of the same, this was not in fact incorporated into the Lease. To the contrary, the Lease prohibited assignment or subletting of the Premises without approval by the HDB. The relevant clause read as follows:', 'This was important for reasons discussed below (see [63]\u2013[64] below).', '10\\u2003The Franchise Agreement was for a term of five years commencing on 1 November 2010. Accordingly, the Franchise Agreement would have terminated on 1 November 2015. However, parties agreed to extend the term to 31 December 2015.', '11\\u2003By a letter dated 22 December 2015, the plaintiff\u2019s solicitors notified the first defendant that unless renewed, the Franchise Agreement would terminate on 31 December 2015. In the same letter, the plaintiff\u2019s solicitors demanded confirmation by 28 December 2015 that the first defendant would transfer the Lease to the plaintiff in the event the first defendant did not intend to renew the Franchise Agreement. The plaintiff did not rely on this letter as constituting an exercise of the Option Clause. This must be correct as the plaintiff would only be able to exercise the Option Clause upon termination of the Franchise Agreement on 31 December 2015. In any event, it would be difficult to construe the letter as exercising the Option Clause as its focus was on renewal of the Franchise Agreement. As will be seen, this remained the focus of the plaintiff until 26 January 2016. On 29 December 2015, the first defendant responded by email and sought \u201ca month to a month and half\u201d to evaluate its options.', '12\\u2003On 4 January 2016, the plaintiff\u2019s solicitors replied to the first defendant\u2019s email of 29 December 2015 to state that the Franchise Agreement had terminated (\u201cthe 4th January letter\u201d). Notwithstanding this, the plaintiff\u2019s solicitors demanded that the first defendant respond by 14 January 2016 on, amongst other things, whether it intended to extend the Franchise Agreement. On 14 January 2016, Connie Lim (\u201cConnie\u201d), the sole director of the first defendant, informed the plaintiff\u2019s solicitors by email that the first defendant would consider renewing the Franchise Agreement but needed details before making a decision.', '13\\u2003On 18 January 2016, the plaintiff\u2019s solicitors rejected the first defendant\u2019s request for details. The plaintiff\u2019s solicitors demanded that the first defendant sign by 22 January 2016 an extension to the Franchise Agreement of five years. A copy of the agreement that was to be signed was enclosed in the letter. As no response was received from the first defendant, the Franchise Agreement came to an end with effect from 31 December 2015.', '14\\u2003It would be helpful at this stage to interpose in the recitation of facts the sale and purchase agreement between the first defendant and the fourth defendant for the assignment of the Lease. Many of the events in this regard occurred contemporaneously with the exchange of correspondence between the plaintiff, and the first defendant and second defendant on the renewal of the Franchise Agreement.', '15\\u2003In early December 2015, the third defendant\u2019s agent informed Ng Kim Wah (\u201cKim Wah\u201d), a director of the third defendant and the fourth defendant, that the childcare business of the first defendant was for sale. Kim Wah was informed by the agent that, according to the first defendant, the franchisor of the business (ie, the plaintiff) had consented to the sale.', '16\\u2003Sometime in the third week of December 2015, Kim Wah viewed the Premises with the agent. Thereafter, Kim Wah made an offer to acquire the business and the Lease, but not the franchise, for $88,000. A few days later, towards the end of December 2015, Kim Wah was informed by the agent that the first defendant had accepted the offer.', '17\\u2003At that time, Kim Wah intended to acquire the Lease and the business in the name of a company to be incorporated. He had in mind the fourth defendant. However, he wanted to close the transaction quickly. As such, the understanding between the first defendant and Kim Wah was that the Lease and the business would be first acquired by the third defendant on behalf of the fourth defendant. This understanding was recorded in a document signed on 26 December 2015. Nothing untoward was alleged by the plaintiff on account of Kim Wah\u2019s desire to close the transaction quickly.', '18\\u2003On 4 January 2016, the first defendant and the third defendant, on behalf of the fourth defendant, signed the Sale and Purchase Agreement (\u201cthe S&P\u201d). I should pause to observe that it was unclear from the record which was first in time \u2013 the execution of the S&P or the receipt of the 4th January letter by the first defendant. It was understood by the parties (to the S&P) that the S&P included the transfer of the Lease to the fourth defendant. At that time, the Lease had just under a year to run. Its term expired on 31 December 2016. As will be seen below (at [41]), under the S&P, completion was conditional upon the fourth defendant obtaining the relevant licence to carry on a childcare business at the Premises and approval from the HDB for the assignment of the Lease. The transaction under the S&P was completed on 1 June 2016 and Kim Wah handed a cheque for $88,000 to the agent. It had been agreed between the fourth defendant and the first defendant that the agent would hold the cheque until the issues with the plaintiff were resolved.', '19\\u2003I pause to make three observations here:', '(a)\\u2003First, between the effective date of expiry of the Franchise Agreement on 31 December 2015 and the execution of the S&P on 4 January 2016, the plaintiff had not exercised the Option Clause. Indeed, as noted above (at [13]), even as late as 18 January 2016, the plaintiff was waiting for the first defendant\u2019s response as to whether it would renew the Franchise Agreement. The plaintiff, however, argued that the Option Clause was exercised by the 4th January letter (see above at [12]). I was of the view the plaintiff\u2019s position was incorrect. This point is discussed at [48]\u2013[49] below.', '(b)\\u2003Second, the plaintiff did not assert that, as at the date of execution of the S&P, Kim Wah (or the third defendant or the fourth defendant) was aware of the discourse between the plaintiff and the first defendant or the terms of the Franchise Agreement. Indeed, when queried by me, counsel for the plaintiff confirmed, that the plaintiff was not making this assertion.', '(c)\\u2003Third, as at the date of execution of the S&P, the second defendant had not been appointed as provisional liquidator.', 'These were important considerations in the final analysis.', '20\\u2003The fourth defendant was incorporated on 11 January 2016. On 12 January 2016, the fourth defendant\u2019s board of directors resolved that it would take over the S&P from the third defendant.', '21\\u2003On 13 January 2016, pursuant to cl 3.3 of the Lease, the fourth defendant applied to the HDB for approval of assignment of the Lease by the first defendant (see [9] above]. The fourth defendant also applied to the Early Childhood Development Agency (\u201cthe ECDA\u201d) for issuance of a childcare licence.', '22\\u2003By a board meeting on 16 January 2016 (\u201cthe 16th January Meeting\u201d), it was resolved that the first defendant be placed in creditors\u2019 voluntary liquidation and the second defendant be appointed as provisional liquidator. The minutes reflected that the first defendant could not carry on its business by reason of its liabilities. Further, it was agreed that the meetings of the members and creditors be convened within one month from that date. It appears that after the 16th January Meeting, Connie informed the second defendant that the business of the first defendant had been sold to the third defendant. The second defendant did not enquire further at that time.', '23\\u2003On 26 January 2016, the second defendant informed the plaintiff\u2019s solicitors that the first defendant was in creditors\u2019 voluntary liquidation. The plaintiff\u2019s solicitors replied on the same day to demand that the first defendant transfer the Lease to the plaintiff pursuant to the Option Clause. The plaintiff\u2019s solicitors also enclosed a copy of the Franchise Agreement in their letter. This appeared to be the first occasion when the plaintiff purported to exercise the Option Clause. When the second defendant asked Connie about the Franchise Agreement, Connie explained that, in her view, the first defendant no longer owed any obligations to the plaintiff under the Franchise Agreement because the plaintiff had rejected an earlier offer by the first defendant to sell its business to the plaintiff.', '24\\u2003Subsequently, on 1 February 2016, and on 10 February 2016, the plaintiff\u2019s solicitors sent two further letters to the second defendant. These letters reiterated the plaintiff\u2019s demand for the first defendant to transfer the Lease to the plaintiff.', '25\\u2003Per the resolution of the 16th January Meeting, the second defendant scheduled a creditors\u2019 meeting on 15 February 2016. The second defendant was appointed as liquidator of the first defendant at this meeting.', '26\\u2003Subsequently, the second defendant called for another creditors\u2019 meeting on 14 March 2016 (\u201cthe Second Creditors\u2019 Meeting\u201d). The agenda for the Second Creditors\u2019 Meeting was, among other things, for the creditors to decide whether to approve the sale of the first defendant\u2019s business and the assignment of the Lease to the fourth defendant. It was resolved that the business be sold and the Lease be transferred to the fourth defendant. The plaintiff, represented by Ng Lee Choo (\u201cNg\u201d), voted against the resolutions. The majority, comprising Connie and Lee Kum Hong (\u201cLee\u201d), voted for the resolutions. It should be noted that Lee was also a shareholder of the first defendant. It should also be noted that though the resolutions specified the fourth defendant, as opposed to the third defendant, as the purchaser, nothing turns on this. The third defendant had at all times contracted on behalf of the fourth defendant.', '27\\u2003After the Second Creditors\u2019 Meeting, the plaintiff\u2019s solicitors sent two letters on 16 March 2016 and 24 March 2016 to the second defendant. Once again, the letters reiterated the first defendant\u2019s obligation under the Franchise Agreement and the plaintiff\u2019s demand for the first defendant to transfer the Lease to the plaintiff. In the letter sent on 16 March 2016, the plaintiff\u2019s solicitors informed the second defendant that she was not entitled to disclaim the Franchise Agreement as the obligation to assign the Lease to the plaintiff was \u201cclearly not onerous\u201d. In the subsequent letter on 24 March 2016, the plaintiff\u2019s solicitors demanded that the second defendant decide if she would disclaim the Franchise Agreement.', '28\\u2003The second defendant then called for a third creditors\u2019 meeting on 19 April 2016. Two items on the agenda were pertinent:', '(a)\\u2003whether an application should be made to court to determine the appropriate course of action to be taken in relation to the competing claims between the plaintiff and the fourth defendant over the Lease; and', '(b)\\u2003if such an application were to be made, who would bear the costs.', 'While it was resolved that an application should be made, none of the creditors were agreeable to bearing the costs. The second defendant thereafter sought legal advice on her obligations as liquidator. She was advised to apply to disclaim the Franchise Agreement as an onerous transaction and that the fees would be between $5,000 to $7,000. The second defendant was prepared to bear these costs herself if the first defendant did not have sufficient funds. Accordingly, by a letter dated 20 April 2016, the second defendant informed the plaintiff that she would be applying to disclaim the Franchise Agreement. In response, the plaintiff informed the second defendant on 22 April 2016 that it would be contesting the application to disclaim. In view of the plaintiff\u2019s challenge, the second defendant revised the estimate of the costs upwards by $30,000. As a result of this sharp upward revision, the second defendant was no longer willing to bear the costs of the application herself.', '29\\u2003On 22 April 2016, well after the execution of the S&P but before completion, the plaintiff\u2019s solicitors wrote to Kim Wah to assert that the plaintiff was entitled to an assignment of the Lease pursuant to the Franchise Agreement. This was the first occasion Kim Wah was made aware of the dispute between the plaintiff and the first defendant. In response, Kim Wah requested that the agent verify the contents of the letter with the first defendant. Kim Wah was informed by the agent that the first defendant would resolve the matter with the plaintiff. Kim Wah and the third defendant and the fourth defendant thus took no further action.', '30\\u2003On 5 May 2016, the HDB gave approval for the assignment of the Lease to the fourth defendant. This was followed by the fourth defendant and the HDB entering into a tenancy agreement for the Premises on 24 May 2016 for a term of seven months from 1 June 2016 to 1 January 2017. Soon thereafter, on 27 May 2016, the ECDA approved the fourth defendant\u2019s application as well. On 1 June 2016, the fourth defendant took over the business of the first defendant and began operating at the Premises as a lessee of the HDB. It is notable that the plaintiff took no steps to stop completion of the S&P on the basis that it had an interest in the Lease. Indeed, OS 360 was commenced on 31 March 2017, well after the term of the Lease had expired on 31 December 2016. The fourth defendant has since continued to operate at the Premises. This would appear to be under an entirely new lease from the HDB given that there was no option to renew the Lease or the tenancy agreement between the fourth defendant and the HDB dated 24 May 2017 in either of the two instruments.', '31\\u2003The plaintiff had initially commenced OS 360 against the first defendant, second defendant and third defendant only. The third defendant was included because it appeared from the S&P that the first defendant had transferred the Lease to it. However, the plaintiff subsequently discovered, after Kim Wah filed his affidavit on 22 June 2017, that the fourth defendant had taken over the Lease. Consequently, the plaintiff applied to amend OS 360 to include the fourth defendant, and to discontinue proceedings against the third defendant. These applications were granted.'"}
{"casename":"2018_SGHC_38","fact":"The background to the plaintiff\u2019s suit is as follows. By a series of written \ncontracts, the plaintiff loaned US$210,000,000 (and a further $527,000,000 \nThai Baht) to Group Lease Thailand. The contracts  conferred onto the plaintiff \nthe right to convert the debentures into shares in Group Lease Thailand. The \nfirst agreement was made on 20 March 2016 and the third  on 1 December 2017.\n3\nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nJTrust Asia Pte Ltd v Group Lease Holdings Pte  Ltd [2018]  SGHC  38\n4 The Securities and Exchange Commission of Thailand  laid a criminal \ncomplaint against Group Lease Thailand concerning  the accounts filed by it, but \nno charges have  been brought so far. In the meantime, Group  Lease Thailand \ntransferred money to Group Lease  Singapore.  The Group Lease companies are \nall in the business of providing funds for businesses (such as those in the hire-\npurchase industry) in Singapore  and elsewhere. Some of the money received by \nGroup Lease Singapore was then loaned  to the third to seventh defendants. \n5 The plaintiff\u2019s grievance arose from  a fear that Group Lease Thailand  \nmay be dishonest  and, should they fail to pay interest on the debentures, the \nplaintiff would lose their capital  (the US$210,000,000  loan) because  Group \nLease Thailand  may become a valueless company, with only debts from the \nthird to seventh defendants to satisfy the plaintiff.\n6 Although evidence  has yet to be adduced and tested at trial the plaintiff\u2019s \nfears may not be unfounded; but, the problem is that the plaintiff\u2019s  cause of \naction against  the defendants here is based  on a conspiracy,  and it is not just a \nconspiracy among the defendants; it is a conspiracy by Group Lease Thailand  \nand the defendants.  Yet, strangely, Group Lease  Thailand is not a party  to this \nsuit, and the money it may have lent, distributed, or disbursed, however one sees \nit, is its  money, obtained under written agreements.\n7 The complaint of the Securities and Exchange Commission  of Thailand, \nthe connections between  the defendants  and Group  Lease Thailand, as well as \nGroup Lease Thailand\u2019s connections with Konoshita  and the company known \nas APF Group Co Ltd may become relevant only when tested at trial. Right now, \nneither Group Lease Thailand nor APF Group Co Ltd are parties  to this suit. \nThere is nothing  more than the speculation  that Group Lease Thailand  has \nmisappropriated the plaintiff\u2019s  US$210,000,000 \u2013 which  was backed  by \n4\nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nJTrust Asia Pte Ltd v Group Lease Holdings Pte  Ltd [2018]  SGHC  38\nproperly executed  commercial debenture  agreements. Once the money has \npassed to Group Lease Thailand under those agreements, there  must  be stronger  \nevidence than what the plaintiff has produced, to show that there may have been  \nmisappropriation of the money. What the plaintiff presently has, is a plausible \ncase that it may be left holding  on to useless  convertible debentures;  but that \nalone is not sufficient  evidence  to warrant a Mareva injunction,  let alone  a \nworldwide Mareva  injunction.\n8 The question  that I have first to decide  is whether the injunction ought \nto have been granted in the first place. Mr Pan submitted that when the plaintiff  \nobtained the order  from Kan SJ,  it did not disclose  that it had already sought \nand obtained worldwide Mareva injunctions against  the second defendant  in not \nonly the British Virgin Islands court, but also the court in Cyprus. The Cyprus \ninjunction was obtained after Kan SJ\u2019s injunction, but that is not crucial. The \npoint is that if there are already not one, but two worldwide Mareva  injunctions, \nwhy is there a need to collect another similar order?\n9 To add to the complexity of the case,  Mr Eugene Thuraisingam appeared \nand I granted him leave  to explain his presence.  He said that he is acting for a \ncompany that has obtained a judgment against the plaintiff\u2019s parent company, \nJTrust Japan, in Mauritius. Mr Thuraisingam  said that his client  has also \nobtained a Mareva injunction from  the Mauritius court against JTrust Japan.  \nMr Pan said that he was not aware  of this fact and that it had not been previously \ndisclosed. He denies  that Mr Thuraisingam\u2019s  client and his are collaborating;  on \nthe contrary, he said that Mr Thuraisingam\u2019s  client had assumed that \nMr Konoshita was collaborating  with Mr Chan\u2019s clients against him. \nMr Thuraisingam further  stated that approximately US$200 million claimed by \nhis client  involved the same fund in Suit 1212 in Singapore. Mr Chan  submitted \nthat the money  in this action is unrelated to the suit in  Mauritius.\n5\nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nJTrust Asia Pte Ltd v Group Lease Holdings Pte  Ltd [2018]  SGHC  38\n10 The plaintiff\u2019s case for a Mareva injunction is based on its allegations \nthat Group  Lease Thailand  and Konoshita had been dishonest  in their \ndisclosures of fact connected to JTrust Asia\u2019s agreements with Group  Lease \nThailand. Consequently, by distributing its funds through  and to the defendants \nin Suit 1212, Group Lease Thailand will have  dissipated  all its assets and JTrust \nAsia will have lost its investments.  That  is the nub of the plaintiff\u2019s case.\n11 A Mareva  injunction  freezes the liquidity of the enjoined entity, \nrendering it incapable of carrying on its business. The entity may even  perish  \nfrom the paralysis. It is not always easy to tell which is the innocent party  in a \ncommercial dispute until the court has heard  all the evidence. That is why a \nMareva injunction can have  dire consequences,  and must  therefore  not be \ngranted unless the court  is satisfied that there  are sound reasons  for it. Not only \nmust the applicant show that he has a strong case, he must  show that there are \nidentifiable assets that belong to, or are due to, the applicant and that the \nrespondent to the application has or is taking steps to place  that asset out of the \napplicant\u2019s reach should the applicant succeed  at trial.\n12 From  the outset,  the applicant  plaintiff in this suit, JTrust Asia, has not \nshown that it has a good arguable case against the respondents. It is not enough  \nto make  an allegation  of conspiracy to defraud  and misappropriate the \napplicant\u2019s money.  The plaintiff\u2019s action  is peculiar in that the defendant  \nconspirators in this suit are not involved as parties in the commercial agreements \nunder which  the plaintiff  transferred the US$210m, part of which  (US$180m)  \nthe plaintiff is now claiming, to Group Lease Thailand.\n13 Group Lease  Thailand is not named as a defendant in this suit. And the \ndefendants in this suit are not named  in the plaintiff\u2019s suit against  Group  Lease \nThailand in the legal proceedings in Thailand.  It will be seen that the three \n6\nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nJTrust Asia Pte Ltd v Group Lease Holdings Pte  Ltd [2018]  SGHC  38\ndebenture agreements lie at the core of the dispute. But the validity  of those  \nagreements cannot be adjudicated in this action without Group  Lease Thailand \nbeing a party. \n14 Furthermore,  even if it can be shown that Group Lease Thailand had \ntransferred US$180m to Group Lease  Singapore,  and then to their subsidiaries  \nin Indonesia  and elsewhere in the world, that is not in itself  evidence of \ndissipation. First, the assets claimed are from those three debenture agreements, \nand as I pointed out, the other party  to the agreement is not named as a defendant \nhere. Secondly, all the parties involved are companies carrying on the business  \nof investments, a refined  way of saying they lend money to companies in need, \nin return for periodic payment  in interests  and sometimes, as in this case, with \nan option to purchase the borrower\u2019s  (Group  Lease  Thailand) equity.  That is \nlikely to be the real dispute  between  JTrust Asia and Group Lease Thailand. \nThat is, were their debenture  agreements  valid or voidable for misrepresentation  \nor breach? That is an issue that this court  has no business to determine because \nGroup Lease Thailand  is not a party to this suit. Further, the defendants as \nalleged conspirators  are not being sued as such  in Thailand.\n15 By letter dated 21 February  2018, counsel  for the first and second \ndefendants sought  leave  to file an affidavit of Apichart Phankeasorn. They have  \nappended a copy of the affidavit to the letter, with the request that it to be placed  \nbefore me. I had given  directions on submissions  when the hearing  adjourned \nand do not require further submissions or submissions disguised  as affidavits. I \ndo not require any further  affidavit from any party  and the affidavit  of Apichart \nPhankeasorn is therefore totally ignored,  with the fullest respect.\n16 In deciding whether or not an ex parte  Mareva  injunction ought to be set \naside on the ground of material non-disclosure,  the court will naturally ask itself  \n7\nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nJTrust Asia Pte Ltd v Group Lease Holdings Pte  Ltd [2018]  SGHC  38\nwhether it would  have granted the order had those facts been before it at the ex \nparte hearing.  In this case, I did not hear the ex parte application so I have  to \nconsider whether  I would have granted the application had I been aware of the \ncircumstances that I am aware of in the hearing before me. The submissions \nhave gone beyond the issue of material non-disclosure and I thus considered the \nquestion of setting aside  and the opposing question of expansion  together. For \nthe reasons above, I am of the opinion that there is no merit in granting a Mareva \ninjunction to JTrust Asia,  let alone expanding the ex parte order it obtained from \nKan SJ into a worldwide Mareva injunction. Consequently, Summonses 148 \nand 377 are dismissed and Summonses 435 and 436 are allowed. Costs for all \nfour summonses are  reserved to the trial  judge.\n      - Sgd -Choo Han  Teck\nJudge\nChan  Leng Sun  SC, Sheik Umar Bin  Mohamed Bagushair, Michelle \nLee Ying-Ying and  Nicolette Oon Xin Yi (Wong  & Leow LLC) for  \nPlaintiff;\nEdric  Pan Xingzheng,  Chia Huai Yuan, Thng Huilin Melissa and  \nZheng  Huaice (Dentons Rodyk  & Davidson  LLP) for 1st and 2nd \nDefendants;\nPillai Pradeep G and Simren  Kaur Sandhu (PRP Law LLC) for  \n3rd Defendant;\nEugene Thuraisingam and Suang Wijaya (Eugene Thuraisingam \nLLP) for Non-Parties \u2013 First Global Funds Limited PCC, Weston  \nInternational Asset Recovery Company  Limited, Weston Capital  \nAdvisors Inc. and Weston  International Asset  Recovery \nCorporation, Inc.\n8\nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)"}
{"casename":"2018_SGHC_39","fact":"'3\\u2003As is usual in such cases, the facts are within a fairly narrow compass and not in dispute. Koo and Liew are both Malaysian citizens. Koo was 34 years old and Liew was 37 at the time of the accident; they are now 44 and 47 respectively.', '4\\u2003On 8 December 2007, Liew was taking Koo to work on his Malaysian-registered motorcycle (registration number JGT 6125), when he met with an accident along Ayer Rajah Expressway. His motorcycle skidded and Koo was flung off the motorcycle onto the road. She sustained serious head injuries (including skull fractures and loss of brain tissue) and was conveyed to National University Hospital for emergency treatment, following which she was discharged for treatment in Malaysia. 1', 'Koo also suffered post-traumatic epilepsy as a result of the accident. 2', 'The motorcycle was insured under a policy of insurance number JVA 0647209 (\u201cthe Policy\u201d) issued by AM Gen (then known as Kurnia Insurans (Malaysia) Bhd) at the time of the accident. 3', 'The Policy did not cover passenger liability.', '5\\u2003On 16 July 2009, Koo commenced Suit No 613 of 2009 (\u201cSuit 613\u201d) in Singapore against Liew for compensation for her injuries. AM Gen instructed lawyers to represent Liew in Suit 613. However, the lawyers subsequently discharged themselves on 5 April 2010 on AM Gen\u2019s instructions that the Policy did not cover passenger liability. 4', '6\\u2003On 20 April 2010, AM Gen took out Originating Summons No 383 of 2010 (\u201cOS 383\u201d) seeking the following reliefs:', '(a)\\u2003a declaration that, under the terms of the Policy, AM Gen was not liable to satisfy any judgment sum for damages, interests and costs as might be found or adjudicated to be payable by Liew to Koo in Suit 613; and', '(b)\\u2003a permanent injunction restraining Koo and Liew from making any claim against the MIB in respect of any judgment sum for damages, interest or costs which might be awarded by the court in favour of Koo against Liew in Suit 613.', '7\\u2003It appears that AM Gen applied for the permanent injunction above because it expected that if the MIB were to compensate Koo, the MIB would seek an indemnity from AM Gen under the \u201cInsurer Concerned\u201d principle. 5', 'OS 383 was dismissed with costs by Judith Prakash J (as she then was) on 2 July 2010. AM Gen did not appeal, nor did it take any further steps to defend Liew in Suit 613. On 10 August 2010, interlocutory judgment was entered against Liew with damages to be assessed. On 21 February 2011, final judgment was entered against Liew with damages in the sum of S$788,057.73, plus interest, costs and disbursements (\u201cthe Judgment Debt\u201d). 6', 'Liew has not satisfied the Judgment Debt to date.', '8\\u2003On 26 April 2012, Koo filed Originating Summons No 404 of 2012 (\u201cOS 404\u201d) against the MIB, seeking satisfaction of the Judgment Debt from the MIB pursuant to its obligations under an agreement between the MIB and the Minister for Finance of the Republic of Singapore, which I define at [20] below as \u201cthe Principal Agreement\u201d. On 8 June 2012, the MIB applied for OS 404 to be struck out and dismissed under O 18 r 19 of the Rules of Court on the basis, inter alia, that Koo, not being a party to the Domestic Agreement, had no cause of action or locus standi against the MIB. 7', 'This application to strike out failed. In the alternative, the MIB applied for and was granted a stay of OS 404 pending the determination of other proceedings which were ongoing at the time and which, though factually unrelated, stood to have a bearing on the legal principles applicable to OS 404. These were the proceedings in Originating Summons No 808 of 2011, which was determined at first instance on 4 October 2012 (see Pacific & Orient Insurance Co Bhd (formerly known as Pacific & Orient Insurance Co Sdn Bhd) v Motor Insurers\u2019 Bureau of Singapore [2013] 1 SLR 341 (\u201cPacific & Orient\u201d). That decision was upheld on appeal on 29 April 2013.', '9\\u2003On 19 November 2013, the MIB joined AM Gen as a third party in OS 404, claiming that it was entitled to be indemnified by AM Gen against Koo\u2019s claim pursuant to the Principal Agreement and two other agreements defined at [21] and [22] below as \u201cthe Domestic Agreement\u201d and the \u201cSpecial Agreement\u201d.', '10\\u2003In response to the MIB\u2019s argument that Koo lacked locus standi in OS 404 due to privity, Koo\u2019s solicitors wrote to the Ministry of Finance on 28 January 2015 requesting the Minister for Finance to compel the MIB to honour the Principal Agreement and satisfy the Judgment Debt. 8', '11\\u2003On 13 March 2015, the Public Trustee\u2019s Office (\u201cthe Public Trustee\u201d) replied to Koo\u2019s solicitors, referencing the letter to the Ministry of Finance and stating that their letter had been referred to the Public Trustee. The Public Trustee stated that having carefully considered their letter, the enclosed documents and case law, it disagreed with Koo\u2019s interpretation of the Principal Agreement and there was no basis for the Public Trustee to be joined as a party to OS 404. 9', 'Although the Public Trustee was not before me, unless there was some very good reason for their taking such a position which I have failed to appreciate, I do not think the Public Trustee was entitled to wash its hands of this matter (see [49]\u2013[51] and [55]\u2013[59] below). The Public Trustee also stated, correctly in my view, that the Minister for Finance had assigned all his rights and duties under the Principal Agreement to the Public Trustee and there was no basis to join the Minister for Finance to the proceedings (see [20] below).', '12\\u2003On 19 October 2015, the court ordered a stay of OS 404 by consent of Koo and the MIB. Koo and the MIB then together commenced Suit 647 against AM Gen on 21 June 2016, by which they seek to compel AM Gen to satisfy the Judgment Debt in Koo\u2019s favour.', '13\\u2003On 7 October 2016, Koo and the MIB filed Summons No 4880 of 2016 (\u201cSUM 4880\u201d) in Suit 647 under O 14 of the Rules of Court. SUM 4880 was amended on 31 August 2017. As amended, SUM 4880 is an application for:', '(a)\\u2003a determination of whether AM Gen is the \u201cInsurer Concerned\u201d as defined in cl 1 of the Domestic Agreement, and if so, whether AM Gen is obliged to satisfy the Judgment Debt; and', '(b)\\u2003final judgment to be entered in favour of Koo or, in the alternative, the MIB, in the sum of S$788,057.73 and interest thereon at 5.33% per annum from the date of issuance of the writ in Suit 647 to the date of final judgment;', '(c)\\u2003in the alternative, interlocutory judgment to be entered in the MIB\u2019s favour for damages to be assessed; and', '(d)\\u2003in the further alternative, an order of specific performance of the Special Agreement read with the Domestic Agreement, requiring AM Gen to pay the sum stated in (b) above to Koo within 14 days.', '14\\u2003At the hearing before me on 9 October 2017, the plaintiffs applied for and were granted leave to file an affidavit describing the MIB\u2019s physical size and operations. The plaintiffs filed the affidavit of Mr Ng Choong Tiang on 19 October 2017. On 23 October 2017, Mr Liew Teck Huat, counsel for AM Gen, asked for leave to file an affidavit in response. This was followed up on 1 November 2017 with the draft affidavit AM Gen proposed to file. In an effort to avoid factual disputes, I asked the parties to see if they could agree on what I thought would be uncontroversial facts:', '(a)\\u2003the MIB currently occupies office space of approximately 400 square feet at 180 Cecil Street, #15-02 Bangkok Bank Building, Singapore 069546;', '(b)\\u2003the MIB has occupied this office since 2014; and', '(c)\\u2003the MIB is currently staffed by one Manager\/Secretary and two support staff.', '15\\u2003On 17 November 2017, counsel for AM Gen wrote to say, in gist, that the above facts were not really relevant since the true question was whether the MIB, notwithstanding that it was a small organisation with a small office, had the financial means to manage claims such as the present one. AM Gen reiterated its request to file an affidavit in response. On 27 November 2017, I gave leave to AM Gen to do so and directed that this affidavit be filed within two weeks. That same day, AM Gen filed the affidavit of Mr Hwi Thiam Seng, which had been affirmed earlier on 25 October 2017. In any event, both these affidavits were peripheral to the issues at hand and I have not relied upon them in coming to my decision.', '16\\u2003For completeness, I should add that Koo was working in Singapore at the time of the accident but her employment was terminated after the accident and she and Liew both now reside in Malaysia.', '17\\u2003In order to understand the claims that arose out of the accident, it is necessary to briefly reiterate the legal framework governing the relationship between the MIB and Malaysian insurers which have insured vehicles involved in traffic accidents in Singapore. (This is described in greater detail in Pacific & Orient at [8]\u2013[17]).', '18\\u2003As I stated in Pacific & Orient at [8], \u201cthe ubiquitous motor vehicle, indispensable to modern life, has an unfortunate inherent capacity to injure, maim or cause the death of other road users or pedestrians as well as inflict property damage. All too often, more than one category of harm is caused\u201d. This gave rise to social legislation like the English Road Traffic Act of 1930 (c 43) (UK), which ensures that no motor vehicle is driven without compulsory insurance cover for causing personal injury or death to a third party arising out of the negligent use of the motor vehicle. Our equivalent is the Motor Vehicles (Third Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Cap 189, 2000 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe MV(TP)A\u201d). The MV(TP)A provides that where, for one reason or another, the insurer is able to avoid or deny liability or cover to the vehicle owner or the driver, the insurer must nonetheless first satisfy any judgment for death or personal injury entered against its insured owner or driver. Thereafter, the insurer is entitled to proceed to recover that sum from its insured. An important requirement placed on the victim is that he has to give notice of his claim to the insurer.', '19\\u2003However, even with the enactment of the MV(TP)A in 1960, there were still situations where a victim would be left without compensation, eg, in a hit-and-run accident where the driver could not be traced, or where the terms of the driver\u2019s insurance policy excluded liability (see Halsbury\u2019s Laws of Singapore vol 13(2) (LexisNexis, 2016 Reissue) at para 155.719). A further safety net was needed. That safety net was the MIB scheme.', '20\\u2003On 22 February 1975, the MIB entered into a Memorandum of Agreement with the Minister for Finance of the Republic of Singapore. The agreement sets out the circumstances under which the MIB has an obligation to compensate victims of road accidents (essentially where there is no effective insurance for the vehicle involved, where the driver of the vehicle cannot be traced and where the insurer has become insolvent). I hereafter refer to this agreement, as supplemented by a Supplemental Agreement on 24 September 1998 and a Further Supplemental Agreement dated 13 August 2003, as \u201cthe Principal Agreement\u201d. It should be noted that the Minister for Finance assigned its rights, benefits, interests, privileges, powers, remedies and duties under the Principal Agreement to the Public Trustee of the Republic of Singapore by way of a Deed of Assignment dated 13 August 2003. 10', '21\\u2003Also on 22 February 1975, the MIB entered into another Memorandum of Agreement with all insurance companies and Lloyd\u2019s underwriters which sold motor insurance policies in Singapore (which, as supplemented by a Supplemental Agreement dated 24 September 1998, I shall refer to as \u201cthe Domestic Agreement\u201d). The Domestic Agreement specifies the situations and conditions under which an insurance company is liable to compensate victims of a traffic accident.', '22\\u2003The Domestic Agreement is signed only with insurers registered in Singapore. To ensure that Malaysian insurers, whose insured vehicles enter Singapore, are subject to the same obligations, the MIB signs special agreements with individual Malaysian insurers by which the latter agree to be bound by the obligations in the Domestic Agreement in the same way as a Singaporean insurer. Malaysian vehicles driven into Singapore must be insured by an insurer which has entered into such an agreement with the MIB in order to be exempt from the statutory requirements relating to compulsory insurance under the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Cap 189, 2000 Rev Ed) (see s 3 of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) (Exemption) Notification (GN No S 526\/1998)). In this case, the relevant agreement was signed between the MIB and AM Gen (then known as Industrial & Commercial Insurance (Malaysia) Bhd) on 26 October 1987 (\u201cthe Special Agreement\u201d). Clause 2 of the Special Agreement states:', '23\\u2003I should add that the Special Agreement is not unprecedented or novel. The Motor Insurers\u2019 Bureau of West Malaysia (\u201cMIBWM\u201d) was set up in 1968, before the Singapore MIB was set up in 1975. Because the Malaysian equivalent of the Domestic Agreement was only signed with insurers registered in Malaysia, the MIBWM had no recourse against Singaporean insurers in relation to injuries or deaths caused by Singapore vehicles on West Malaysian roads. Malaysian insurers were concerned that they would have to bear the brunt of personal injury or death claims in Malaysia involving Singapore vehicles where the Singapore insurers were entitled to avoid liability under their policies. The MIBWM therefore entered into \u201cspecial agreements\u201d with motor insurers in Singapore, pursuant to which the latter agreed to be bound by MIBWM\u2019s memorandum and articles of association and the Malaysian equivalents of the Principal and Domestic Agreements (see [11] and [17] of Pacific & Orient). When Singapore set up the MIB in 1975, the act of entering into Special Agreements with Malaysian insurers was an established practice and precedent.'"}

Mr Majnu gave instructions for the last two transactions through the S2B platform on 6 June 2013, after meeting a colleague of Ms Poh at the Bank who taught him how to use the S2B platform. The plaintiff had not used the S2B Platform before 6 June 2013.', '16\\u2003From 17 to 26 June 2013, the Bank received six Outward Telegraphic Transaction (\u201cOTT\u201d) instructions in the form of Remittance Application Forms. I shall refer to these instructions individually as \u201cthe 1st Instruction\u201d, \u201cthe 2nd Instruction\u201d, etc. These instructions bore signatures consistent with Mr Majnu\u2019s specimen signature in the Bank\u2019s records. They were attached to emails sent to the Bank from the Yahoo Account, and were also faxed to the Bank.', '17\\u2003Upon receiving these emails from the Yahoo Account, Mr Lee Sien Sing, also known as Desmond Lee (\u201cMr Desmond Lee\u201d), and Ms Poh sent several emails in reply, between 17 and 28 June 2013, to the Yahoo Account. (Ms Poh was on leave between 17 and 21 June 2013. Mr Desmond Lee, who also worked as a RM for the Bank, attended to her customers in her absence and handled the 1st and 2nd Instructions.) It was undisputed that during this period, ie, between 17 and 28 June 2013, Mr Majnu used the Yahoo Account to send emails to various third parties. However, unsurprisingly he disavows any knowledge of any of these emails sent from the Yahoo Account to the Bank and the replies from Mr Lee and Ms Poh.', '18\\u2003On 18 June 2013, Mr Majnu received two text messages (\u201cthe 18 June SMSes\u201d) on his mobile phone (\u201cthe Mobile Phone\u201d) containing Yahoo! verification codes. It was undisputed that the 18 June SMSes were sent to the Mobile Phone in relation to the Yahoo Account. The expert jointly appointed by the parties, RSM Technology Risk Group Pte Ltd (\u201cRSM\u201d), gave evidence on the 18 June SMSes. RSM was unable to definitively conclude why the 18 June SMSes were sent, but opined that they may have been sent because a user was accessing or attempting to access the Yahoo Account using a new device. Mr Majnu did not act on the 18 June SMSes, claiming unfamiliarity with such notifications as the reason for not doing so.', '19\\u2003Details of the 1st to 4th Instructions, which I shall refer to collectively as \u201cthe Four Instructions\u201d, are set out in the following table:', '20\\u2003Officers of the Bank attempted to call the plaintiff\u2019s representatives to confirm the Four Instructions. In respect of the 1st and 2nd Instructions, calls were made to the Singapore Contact Numbers. In respect of the 3rd and 4th Instructions, calls were made to the Bangladesh Contact Numbers. All of these calls were unanswered, except a call in respect of the 1st Instruction. This call was terminated shortly after Mr Ali, who answered the call, told the officer not to disturb him. The Bank therefore did not obtain confirmation of the Four Instructions from the plaintiff\u2019s representatives by telephone.', '21\\u2003The Four Instructions were referred to the RM in charge of the Account for a decision on whether they should be executed. As noted at [17] above, Ms Poh was on leave between 17 and 21 June 2013. Mr Desmond Lee, who attended to Ms Poh\u2019s customers in her absence, handled the 1st and 2nd Instructions. In respect of these instructions, Mr Desmond Lee was told that the officers of the Bank had not been able to verify the 1st and 2nd Instructions by telephone. Nonetheless, he gave approval for the 1st and 2nd Instructions to be executed. Ms Poh dealt with the 3rd and 4th Instructions. Similarly, she was told that the Bank had not confirmed these instructions by telephone; again, she nonetheless approved the execution of these instructions.', '22\\u2003The Four Instructions were thus executed and the relevant amounts (see [19] above) were accordingly debited from the Account.', '23\\u2003On 24 June 2013, after Ms Poh approved the execution of the 3rd and 4th Instructions, she sent an email to Mr Majnu requesting the latter to provide the Bank with his updated contact details. She explained that the Bank had attempted to contact Mr Majnu many times through the numbers originally provided but had not succeeded in doing so most of the time.', '24\\u2003In reply, on the same day, an email from the Yahoo Account was sent to Ms Poh, purportedly from Mr Majnu (\u201cthe Health Problems email\u201d). This stated that Mr Majnu was receiving medical treatment for health problems and was unable to receive phone calls. It also stated that Mr Majnu would update his contact details on 1 July 2013. Ms Poh responded to the Health Problems email later that day, acknowledging its contents.', '25\\u2003On 26 June 2013, the 5th and 6th Instructions were sent to the Bank. Details of the 5th and 6th Instructions are set out in the following table:', '26\\u2003The Bank did not execute the 5th and 6th Instructions. This was because there were insufficient funds in the Account to do so. On 27 June 2013, there was US$182,167.05 in the Account. Ms Poh sent an email to Mr Majnu to inform him of this. She also invited the plaintiff to fund the Account and to reissue the instruction(s), stating that the Bank would be cancelling the 5th and 6th Instructions.', '27\\u2003On 27 June 2013, Mr Majnu logged onto the S2B platform and sought to transfer a sum of US$503,386.00 to a third party (\u201cthe 7th Instruction\u201d).

I shall examine these orders individually, but as I have said, their principal effect is to enable the Grandson to carry out the sale of the Property in accordance with the trust for sale established by the Grandfather\u2019s will.

The defendant\u2019s husband\u2019s bankruptcy was unconnected to the financial issues of the Company. He was discharged from bankruptcy in 2014.', '11\\u2003The plaintiff, however, disputed the extent of the role played by the defendant and her husband in the Company during this period.', '12\\u2003In 2005, the defendant purchased a five-room HDB flat (\u201cthe HDB flat\u201d) in Punggol with her husband. However, she continued to reside in 36 Jalan Raya with him.', 'The first dispute', '13\\u2003Sometime in early 2009, a dispute arose between the plaintiff, on the one hand, and Mr Ng and Mr Ng Teng, on the other hand, regarding the Company. On 18 February 2009, against the backdrop of this dispute, Mr Ng granted a power of attorney to the defendant (\u201cthe Power of Attorney\u201d). By the Power of Attorney, Mr Ng authorised the defendant to exercise all of his rights as a shareholder of the Company and all of his powers as the administrator of Mdm Goh\u2019s estate, including his powers to deal with the Jalan Raya Properties. The grant of the Power of Attorney was an important turn of events.', '14\\u2003In April 2009, the plaintiff commenced Suit 315 of 2009 (\u201cSuit 315\u201d) against Mr Ng and Mr Ng Teng. This was a minority oppression action, where the plaintiff sought a declaration that Mr Ng and Mr Ng Teng held their shares in the Company on trust for him or, in the alternative, an order for the buy-out of their shares by the plaintiff.', '15\\u2003On or about 1 July 2009, presumably in view of Suit 315, Mr Ng moved out of 34 Jalan Raya and into 36 Jalan Raya to live with the defendant and her husband.', '16\\u2003On 9 October 2009, Mr Ng applied for the court to sanction the sale of 34 Jalan Raya. The application was driven by the defendant as the holder of the Power of Attorney. Critically, it was undisputed that at this point, Mr Ng did not wish to sell 36 Jalan Raya. This was because he wanted a roof over his head. In response to Mr Ng\u2019s application, the plaintiff took the position that both of the Jalan Raya Properties should be sold. This was on the basis that the properties would attract a higher value when sold together. On 12 November 2009, an order was made for the sale of both of the Jalan Raya Properties, against Mr Ng\u2019s original wish to retain 36 Jalan Raya as a roof over his head. This is important. I shall return to this point below.', '17\\u2003The following key events occurred in December 2009 and January 2010 in quick succession. The chronology of these events was pivotal in this case:', '(a)\\u2003On 3 December 2009, an option to purchase (\u201cOTP\u201d) for the Jalan Raya Properties was granted to a third party at the price of $3,980,000.', '(b)\\u2003Six days later, on 9 December 2009, the defendant obtained an OTP for 43 Eastwood Drive, Singapore 486588 (\u201cthe Eastwood Property\u201d) at the price of $1,750,000.', '(c)\\u2003On 11 December 2009, the OTP for the Jalan Raya Properties was exercised.', '(d)\\u2003On 22 December 2009, the defendant exercised the OTP for the Eastwood Property and paid a 5% deposit for the purchase.', 'It is relevant that there was no evidence the defendant had any independent means to fund the completion of the purchase of the Eastwood Property. Nor was there evidence that she took steps to sell the HDB Flat at this time, which could at least have provided her with some funds. Further, her husband was not a source of funds as he was a bankrupt at that time.', '18\\u2003Shortly after she exercised the OTP for the Eastwood Property, on 4 January 2010, Mr Ng and the defendant opened a joint account at OCBC Bank (\u201cthe Joint Account\u201d). On the very same day, Mr Ng made a will (\u201cthe First Will\u201d) by which he appointed the defendant as the executor and purported to gift $1,662,500 to her to purchase the Eastwood Property. It is telling that this was the exact balance of the purchase price for the Eastwood Property after taking into account the monies that were paid under the OTP. Mr Ng later revoked the First Will in the Last Will (see [35] below).', '19\\u2003On 10 March 2010, the sale of the Jalan Raya Properties was completed.', '20\\u2003On 15 March 2010, Mr Ng received a cheque of $1,939,955.50 for (most of) his share of the proceeds of sale of the Jalan Raya Properties in his capacity as Mdm Goh\u2019s spouse, and signed a payment voucher acknowledging receipt. Notably, on 16 March 2010, the cheque was deposited into the Joint Account.', '21\\u2003Subsequently, Mr Ng signed a cheque dated 17 March 2010 for the sum of $1,662,500 (\u201cthe 17 March 2010 cheque\u201d) in favour of the defendant. (The plaintiff initially claimed that Mr Ng\u2019s signature on the 17 March 2010 cheque had been forged. However, he withdrew this allegation subsequently.) Again, the sum of $1,662,500 represented the exact balance of the purchase price for the Eastwood Property, which the defendant paid using the proceeds of this cheque.', '22\\u2003From 18 March to 5 April 2010, a total of $127,115.78 was deposited into the Joint Account. It was undisputed that this reflected the sum of (1) the balance of Mr Ng\u2019s share in the Jalan Raya Properties received in his capacity as Mdm Goh\u2019s spouse; (2) Mr Ng\u2019s share in the Jalan Raya Properties received in his capacity as a beneficiary of the estate of one of his sons who pre-deceased him and (3) payments Mr Ng made on behalf of Mdm Goh\u2019s estate in selling the Jalan Raya Properties. Thus, it was undisputed that Mr Ng was entitled to these monies.', '23\\u2003On 30 March 2010, the sale of the Eastwood Property was completed.', '24\\u2003In around May 2010, Mr Ng moved to the Eastwood Property with the defendant and her family to live there. Notably, the defendant\u2019s evidence was that from 2010 to 2015, she purported to charge Mr Ng a total of $211,224.90 for expenses he allegedly incurred during his stay at the Eastwood Property. Mr Ng was aware of this. In this regard, the evidence was as follows:', '(a)\\u2003The defendant produced a document which she had prepared that indicated that from 2010 to 2015, Mr Ng\u2019s living expenses amounted to $211,224.90 (from 2010 to 2013, the expenses amounted to $150,883.90). The sum of $211,224.90 included the cost of Mr Ng\u2019s food, mobile phone, Chinese newspapers, \u201cCNY withdrawal\u201d and his maid (including the cost of the maid levy and repatriating the maid). In relation to the \u201cCNY withdrawal\u201d, a fixed sum of $5,000 was withdrawn for each year between 2010 and 2015, apparently for Mr Ng to provide ang pows (red packets). The same document indicated that from 2010 to 2015, Mr Ng\u2019s medical expenses amounted to $6,363.41 (the sum for 2010 to 2013 amounted to $4,027.78).', '(b)\\u2003According to the defendant, Mr Ng did not pay her for these expenses. Instead, from 2010 to 2013, she withdrew a total sum of $226,585.05 from the Joint Account for payment of Mr Ng\u2019s \u201cmedical and living expenses and other matters\u201d [emphasis added]. The last withdrawal for the alleged purpose of paying Mr Ng\u2019s living expenses was effected on 13 May 2013, when the defendant withdrew a total of $193,172.87 from the Joint Account, leaving barely $3,000 in it. In other words, this final withdrawal for the alleged purpose of Mr Ng\u2019s living expenses took place in 2013, before Mr Ng actually incurred any expenses in 2014 and 2015.', 'Even on the defendant\u2019s account, the numbers just did not add up. Mr Ng\u2019s alleged medical and living expenses for 2010 to 2013 amounted to a total sum of $154,911.68 (the sum of $150,883.90 and $4,027.78: see [(a)] above). This was far less than the $193,172.87 that the defendant withdrew on 13 May 2013, let alone the total sum of $226,585.05 that she withdrew from the Joint Account from 2010 to 2013. She was not able to explain these discrepancies. Clearly, the defendant withdrew significantly more than the amount she alleged Mr Ng had incurred. I set out in a table in Annex A details of the withdrawals from the Joint Account and the defendant\u2019s descriptions of and remarks regarding the same. The defendant admitted that apart from two withdrawals on 17 March 2010 for the total sum of $1,702,300, which were effected after Mr Ng signed two cheques, she had issued and signed all the other cheques authorising the withdrawals.', '25\\u2003On 25 January 2011, the parties in Suit 315 settled their dispute by executing a settlement agreement. The settlement provided for the Company to pay a sum of $420,000 to Mr Ng, and for Mr Ng and Mr Ng Teng to transfer their shares in the Company to the plaintiff for nominal consideration.', '26\\u2003On or about 9 June 2011, the defendant collected a cheque for $420,000, reflecting the monies that Mr Ng was entitled to under the Settlement Agreement (see [25] above). This too was deposited into the Joint Account. It should be emphasised that despite Mr Ng depositing a total of $2,487,071.28 into the Joint Account, by 13 May 2013 when the defendant did the very last withdrawal of $193,172.87 (see [24(b)] above), the Joint Account was left with only $3,000. In other words, the Joint Account had been almost completely drained.', '27\\u2003Sometime in 2011, about a year after she bought the Eastwood Property, the defendant sold the HDB Flat.', '28\\u2003On 27 March 2015, the plaintiff visited Mr Ng at the Eastwood Property and the parties thereafter reconciled. Shortly thereafter, Mr Ng asked the plaintiff to perform a title search on the Eastwood Property. The plaintiff performed the search and discovered that title to the Eastwood Property was not in Mr Ng\u2019s name. The plaintiff\u2019s evidence, which I accept, was that Mr Ng was \u201cshocked\u201d when he found out about this.', '29\\u2003On 4 May 2015, Mr Ng left the Eastwood Property to stay with the plaintiff.', '30\\u2003On 26 June 2015, Mr Ng\u2019s solicitors sent a letter to the defendant (\u201cthe Letter\u201d) with the heading \u201cMisappropriation of Funds\u201d. The Letter asserted in strong language that the defendant had misappropriated and used Mr Ng\u2019s monies to purchase the Eastwood Property. The Letter further asserted that the defendant \u201cmay be guilty not only of criminal breach of trust but cheating as well as forgery\u201d, and invited her to produce evidence to the contrary.', '31\\u2003On 27 June 2015, Mr Ng filed a police report (\u201cthe Police Report\u201d). The Police Report stated as follows:', '32\\u2003In or around July 2015, around one month after receiving the Letter, the defendant replied to the Letter through her solicitors. In her reply, she did not comment on the serious allegations raised in the Letter. Rather, her solicitors simply stated that they had instructions to accept service of process. I found it strange that the defendant did not see fit to respond to such grave allegations from her father.', '33\\u2003On 26 August 2015, Mr Ng commenced this action against the defendant.', '34\\u2003On 15 and 21 December 2015, Dr Ng Li-Ling (\u201cDr Ng\u201d), a Senior Consultant in the Department of Psychological Medicine at Changi General Hospital, reviewed Mr Ng to assess whether he was mentally capable of making decisions regarding the present suit. Dr Ng prepared a medical report on Mr Ng (\u201cthe Medical Report\u201d). The key parts of the Medical Report are as follows:', '35\\u2003On 24 December 2015, Mr Ng executed the Last Will. By this Will, he appointed the plaintiff as the executor and revoked the First Will. The defendant did not challenge the Last Will.', '36\\u2003As noted at [33] above, on 26 August 2015, Mr Ng commenced this action. However, unfortunately, he was not able to see it through. On 11 February 2016, Mr Ng passed away from multiple injuries which he sustained in an apparent suicide. He was found on a grass patch behind the HDB block where he was living with the plaintiff. The plaintiff subsequently obtained an order that he be added as the plaintiff to this action in his capacity as the executor of the Last Will.'"}

The screenshot of the Xpressor Platform\u2019s Facebook Page lists eight different portals (including the PG website and the 99 website) as portals onto which users can post their listings. 17', 'In addition, the user may also select the dates and times at which a listing is to be cross-posted from one portal to another. 18', '17\\u2003On 26 March 2015, the defendant and MPG entered into an agreement (\u201cthe Xpressor Agreement\u201d), 19', 'by which MPG would, for a fee, allow the defendant to provide access to the Xpressor Platform on the 99 website. The purpose of the Xpressor Agreement was to allow users of the 99 website to access the Xpressor Platform from the website. This project was, however, abandoned due to \u201ctechnical issues\u201d. 20', '18\\u2003According to Mr Cheung, after the technical issues surfaced, the defendant advised property agents who were using the 99 website to use the Xpressor Platform via the website hosted by MPG. 21', 'Property agents found this inconvenient, and suggested to Mr Cheung that they would prefer using a mobile application. 22', 'Furthermore, MPG itself wanted to build a mobile application but did not have sufficient resources to do so. Therefore, Mr Koh asked the defendant to build an application for them. Thereafter, MPG and the defendant collaborated on the development of the Xpressor App. 23', '19\\u2003The Xpressor App allows users to cross-post their listings on the PG website to the 99 website. On opening the Xpressor App, users are required to log in to their \u201cGuru Account\u201d (ie, their account on the PG website). The Xpressor App then lists all their active listings on the PG website, and the user may choose to cross-post either a selection of those listings or all of them to the 99 website. 24', '20\\u2003The Xpressor App was made available for download on the iTunes Apple Store and Google Play Store. 25', 'There is some dispute over the precise period when it was available. There is documentary evidence that the Apple Store gave approval for the upload of the Xpressor App on 6 June 2015 and that on 23 January 2016, Apple Store notified Mr Koh (who was registered as the owner of the Xpressor App) that it would be taken down. 26', 'However, there was no documentary evidence on when the Xpressor App was made available on the Google Play Store. Mr Phun said it was taken down sometime in end January 2016. 27', 'In any case, both Mr Cheung and Mr Phun testified that, to the best of their knowledge, users who downloaded the Xpressor App before it had been removed from the digital stores could continue to use the Xpressor App. 28', '21\\u2003The Xpressor App was taken down from the digital stores at Mr Koh\u2019s instructions. Mr Koh gave this instruction because on 8 December 2015, the plaintiff\u2019s solicitors had sent a letter to MPG alleging that in making available the Xpressor App which users of the PG website could use to cross-post listings to the 99 website, MPG had induced those users to breach certain terms and conditions of the PG website. These terms and conditions, inter alia, prohibit the use of third-party software to crawl or mine information from the PG Website). 29', 'Thus, Mr Koh asked Mr Cheung to take down the Xpressor App. 30', 'Thereafter, MPG and the plaintiff signed a confidential settlement agreement dated 6 February 2016. After the settlement agreement, the Xpressor Platform continued to be accessible on the internet.', '22\\u2003I turn now to the PA Service. Mr Cheung revealed that the defendant started offering the PA Service from August 2016. 31', 'It was made available for free to premium account holders of the 99 website. 32', 'Should a property agent choose to use the PA Service, an independent contractor of the defendant would access the agent\u2019s listings on the PG website, copy the information in those listings and post them on the 99 website. 33', 'In other words, the cross-posting is a completely manual process.', '23\\u2003On 11 May 2016, the plaintiff commenced the present proceedings. The plaintiff\u2019s claims against the defendant are founded on three causes of action: (a) breach of contract (specifically, the Settlement Agreement), (b) the tort of inducement of breach of contract by the users of the PG website (with the contract being the Terms of Use and Acceptable Use Policy of the PG website), and (c) copyright infringement.', '24\\u2003In the Statement of Claim, the plaintiff sets outs details of the defendant\u2019s development and marketing of the Xpressor App, and alleges that the Xpressor App has been used by an \u201cunquantifiable number of end users\u201d to cross-post listings. 34', 'By way of particulars of reproduction by the defendant, the plaintiff provides details of 71 property listings which were said to have been originally posted on the PG website in January 2016 and February 2016, and which were reproduced on the 99 website in the same months. The plaintiff also pleads that photographs for each of these listings were reproduced. Collectively, I will refer to these listings and their accompanying photographs as \u201cthe January and February 2016 reproductions\u201d. 35', '25\\u2003As the defendant rightly stresses, the availability of the PA Service to users of the 99 website and the particulars of copying by way of the PA Service are not found in the plaintiff\u2019s pleadings. 36', 'According to the plaintiff, it was only sometime in April 2017 that it discovered that the defendant was reproducing listings from the PG website pursuant to the PA Service. No step was taken to amend the pleadings. Yet, at the trial, the plaintiff adduced evidence of the copying of one property listing with nine photographs by a property agent, Ms Tong, from the PG website to the 99 website by way of the PA Service (\u201cthe PA Service reproduction\u201d). At the appropriate junctures below, I will consider the implications of this failure to plead the matters in relation to the PA Service, as well as other deficiencies in the plaintiff\u2019s pleadings. I will now deal with each cause of action in turn, summarising the parties\u2019 positions, and giving my decision under each section.'"}

Here, I will only outline the broad factual background and set out the facts that are relevant to the outstanding issue of share valuation.', '3\\u2003Mr Thio Keng Poon (\u201cMr Thio\u201d) was a businessman who, in the 1960s, procured the incorporation of three companies: United Realty Ltd (\u201cURL\u201d), a property investment holding company, MDI, a manufacturer and distributor of dairy products and beverages, and Thio Holdings Pte Ltd (\u201cTHPL\u201d), an investment holding company. These three companies are the corporate defendants in this action. Together with their subsidiaries and a Hong Kong company, they form the Thio family\u2019s group of businesses (\u201cthe Group\u201d).', '4\\u2003Mr Thio and his wife, Mdm Kwik Poh Leng (\u201cMdm Kwik\u201d), have six children. They are, in order of birth:', 'All of the children, save Vicki, are parties in this litigation, and I will refer to them by their western personal names as I did in the Judgment.', '5\\u2003The plaintiffs are Wendy, Michael and Serene. They are minority shareholders in each of the three corporate defendants. Collectively, they hold 20% of the shareholding in MDI and lower percentages of the share capital of URL and THPL.', '6\\u2003The three individual defendants are Mdm Kwik, Ernest and Patrick. Together, they hold 30% of the shareholding in URL, 38.5% of the shareholding in MDI and 77.25% of the shareholding in THPL. All of them are directors of all three companies. Ernest and Patrick are, respectively, the managing director and deputy managing director of MDI.', '7\\u2003Over the years, Mr Thio passed down the family wealth to his sons by allotting shares in URL, MDI and THPL to them. Each of his sons initially held the same number of shares but Michael\u2019s shares were transferred to Ernest and Patrick in 1991. By the year 2000, Mr Thio, Mdm Kwik, Ernest and Patrick were the only family members who held shares in the Group. They were also directors of the Group companies.', '8\\u2003In 2002, Mdm Kwik expressed a wish that some financial provision be made for the daughters. Mr Thio then decided that Michael, Vicki, Wendy and Serene should receive shares in the Group companies by way of bonus issues. These shares were allotted in March and April 2002.', '9\\u2003On 23 December 2005, following a dispute in the family regarding certain proposed changes to the shareholdings in the Group, the members of the family, THPL and MDI entered into a Deed of Settlement (\u201cthe Deed of Settlement\u201d) which provided for an adjustment of shareholdings in the Group. After the Deed of Settlement, Ernest and Patrick retained majority control of MDI through the combination of their shareholdings in MDI and their control of THPL. Around the same time as the Deed of Settlement, Michael and the three sisters were appointed directors of each of the Group companies.', '10\\u2003Despite the Deed of Settlement, friction between Mr Thio, on the one hand, and Ernest and Patrick, on the other, increased. Mr Thio sued his wife and children and several companies in the Group for, amongst other things, oppression. Ultimately, he succeeded on part of his claims but, in 2010, the shareholders of MDI voted to remove Mr Thio as a director.', '11\\u2003From 2011, discussions took place between Wendy, Serene and Vicki on the one hand, and Ernest and Patrick on the other, regarding a possible purchase by Ernest and Patrick of their sisters\u2019 shares. Without informing their brothers, Michael and the sisters appointed Ernst & Young LLP (\u201cE&Y\u201d) to prepare valuations of URL, MDI and THPL. According to Michael, their only instruction to E&Y was to provide the indicative value of 100% equity stake in each company and the indicative value of the siblings\u2019 respective equity stakes in each of the companies as of December 2010. E&Y provided its indicative valuation results in a presentation dated 9 September 2011 which was revised on 11 November 2011. E&Y valued MDI\u2019s equity as being between $1,197.6m and $1,295.2m.', '12\\u2003The family met twice in November 2011 and February 2012 to discuss the proposed buyout. Several proposals were made but most of the siblings were unable to reach an agreement. Ernest and Patrick suggested that the valuation of shares be conducted on a net tangible asset basis using reports produced by the companies\u2019 auditor. Wendy and Serene proposed a joint appointment of an independent valuer. Ernest and Patrick then counter-proposed that Wendy appoint another valuer at her own cost. Michael later presented the figures derived from E&Y\u2019s valuations, but Ernest and Patrick disagreed with them and offered to purchase each of the sisters\u2019 shareholding for $31.98m and Michael\u2019s for $70.64m. Although Vicki sold out to Ernest and Patrick in May 2013, the plaintiffs considered that the offers made to them were grossly inadequate. Discussions on the proposed buyout eventually broke down.', '13\\u2003In 2013, the plaintiffs brought a minority oppression action against the defendants. After a trial, I made the following findings:', '(a)\\u2003Although the companies in the Group were \u201cfamily companies\u201d in the sense that most of the directors in the relevant companies were members of the Thio family, the Thios did not operate on the basis of a relationship of mutual trust and confidence in relation to how the companies were run. I therefore concluded that URL, MDI and THPL were neither quasi-partnerships nor companies akin to quasi-partnerships.', '(b)\\u2003There was no common understanding among the parties that the plaintiffs were entitled to participate in the management of the Group as directors.', '(c)\\u2003Only the claim of minority oppression against Ernest and Patrick in respect of the affairs of MDI was made out and only in the following respects:', '14\\u2003I granted the plaintiffs judgment against Ernest and Patrick in respect of their claim in relation to MDI. Considering the breakdown of goodwill and trust among the parties and that the relationships between them had unravelled irretrievably, I ordered Ernest and Patrick to buy out the plaintiffs\u2019 respective shares in MDI on the basis of a share price to be determined by an independent valuer who was to value the company as of the date of the Judgment, 17 July 2017, as a going concern. I further ordered that the parties be at liberty to apply for directions in case any were needed in regard to the valuation and the sale.', '15\\u2003The parties jointly appointed Mr Richard Hayler (\u201cMr Hayler\u201d) as the independent valuer. In the course of finalising Mr Hayler\u2019s terms of reference, Ernest and Patrick sought to include a term stating that the plaintiffs\u2019 shares in MDI were to be valued on the basis of \u201cfair market value\u201d, which would allow for a discount to be applied to the valuation of the shares. The plaintiffs disagreed and the parties were unable to reach a compromise.', '16\\u2003On 20 November 2017, the parties jointly wrote to the court requesting a hearing to seek directions on the issue of whether a discount should be applied to the valuation of the plaintiffs\u2019 shares in MDI. The parties were in agreement that no formal application needed to be filed.'"}

{"casename":"2018_SGHC_56","fact":"facts in its \napplication for the order (The \u201cVasily Golovnin\u201d [2008] 4 SLR(R) 994 at [83]). \nMr Maniam  essentially argued that the plaintiff had not disclosed the fact that \nthere had been no express agreement on the seat of the Arbitration in the \narbitration agreement and the plaintiff had actually argued  as such before  the \nICC Court, proposing that the seat of the arbitration  be London. I found that the \nplaintiff had disclosed  in its supporting affidavit (a) the relevant clause  in the \nManagement Agreement; (b) the fact that plaintiff had initially proposed \nLondon as the seat of the arbitration; and (c) the fact that ICC Court  had fixed \nSingapore as the place\/seat of the arbitration. In view of this, I found the \nplaintiff\u2019s failure  to disclose its specific  submission to the ICC Court  that the \nManagement Agreement had not expressly provided  for a seat to be immaterial.\nWhether OS 845 had been validly served\n32 The next question was whether  OS 845 had been validly served  on the \ndefendant. The plaintiff had essentially  left a copy of OS 845 and the supporting  \naffidavit at the defendant\u2019s  office.  Mr Maniam  made extensive arguments on \nhow the requirements O 11 r 4(2)(c)  of the Rules had not been fulfilled. This \nprovides that an originating process may be served  on a defendant in a foreign \njurisdiction (where no Civil Procedure Convention  subsists) by a method  \nauthorised by the law of that country for service of any originating process \n15\nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nHilton International  Manage (Maldives)  [2018]  SGHC  56\nPvt Ltd v Sun Travels  & Tours Pvt  Ltd\nissued by that country, ie, the Maldives. Mr Maniam argued that Maldivian \nprocess was to be served by a court official, which was not done here, and also \npointed out that there  was no accompanying translation of OS 845 into Dhivehi \nas required by O 11 r 4(4) of the Rules. \n33 With respect, this argument misses the point. The methods of service \nunder O 11 r 4(2) are not the only means by which service overseas may be \neffected, and personal and substituted service  are still permissible methods \nthrough which service  of process  overseas may be effected: Humpuss at [57]. \nThe plaintiff  relied on personal service, which is available to the plaintiff as long \nas it does not contravene the law of the foreign  jurisdiction: O 11 r 3(1) read \nwith r 3(2) of the Rules and Humpuss at [59(a)]. The common  ground between \nthe experts is that there is a gap in Maldivian  law in respect of foreign  \nproceedings. No evidence was adduced to show that such personal service of \nforeign process would contravene Maldivian  law. The plaintiff\u2019s expert, Mr \nMohamed Shahdy Anwar, opined  that personal  service  of foreign process by \nprivate means (by way of hand delivery  undertaken  by members of a law firm) \nat the defendant\u2019s  office  would be good service under Maldivian law. The \ndefendant\u2019s expert,  Mr Azmiralda Zahir,  did not state that personal service of \nforeign process was contrary to Maldivian law, only that it would have been \npossible for the plaintiff to seek the Maldivian  court\u2019s assistance in serving  OS \n845 on the defendant via a court official. I thus found that it was open to the \nplaintiff to serve OS 845 on the defendant  personally  under O11 r 3(1) read with \nr 3(2) of the Rules.\n34 However,  such service had to be valid as a matter of Singapore law (the \nlex fori) and thus had to comply with O 62 r 4 of the Rules.  In this case, I found \n16\nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nHilton International  Manage (Maldives)  [2018]  SGHC  56\nPvt Ltd v Sun Travels  & Tours Pvt  Ltd\nthat it was insufficient to hand the cause papers (including, inter alia, OS 845, \nthe supporting affidavit,  the order of court  for service  out of jurisdiction) to the \nreceptionist at the defendant\u2019s office and not serve  them  on an officer of the \ncompany such as the chairman, president, secretary,  treasurer or other similar \nofficer of the defendant at the defendant\u2019s  office  as required by O 62 r 4 of the \nRules. The court was also told that copies  of the cause papers were e-mailed to \nthe defendant\u2019s chairman and managing director, the chief executive officer and \nthe director.  The defendant maintained that leaving a copy of OS 845 at the \ndefendant\u2019s office  and\/or e-mailing  a copy of the same to the defendant\u2019s \nrepresentative does not amount to good service. The plaintiff then argued that \nthe court should exercise its discretion to cure the irregularity in service as the \nmethod of service  employed, although  failing to comply with a procedural  \nrequirement provided for in the Rules, was successful in bringing notice of the \nclaim to the defendant  and was not contrary to the Maldivian law. In Humpuss, \nSteven Chong J (as he then was) held (at [92]) that such cases  did not engage \nconcerns over international comity  or violate  the specific  proscription contained \nin O 11 r 3(2). In considering whether  the defect in service should be cured, the \ncourt should  consider the blameworthiness of the respective parties, whether  the \nplaintiff had made a good faith effort to comply  with the rules,  whether  the \ndefendant would  be prejudiced if the court\u2019s discretion were exercised in the \nplaintiff\u2019s favour, and  the reasons which caused the non-compliance. \n35 I found that the plaintiff had written to the defendant informing the \ndefendant of OS 845 and the Singapore court\u2019s grant  of leave to serve it on the \ndefendant out of jurisdiction but the defendant  had communicated that it would \nnot be appointing any solicitors  to accept service. On 17 August 2017, the \nplaintiff had left OS 845 and the supporting  affidavit with the defendant\u2019s \n17\nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nHilton International  Manage (Maldives)  [2018]  SGHC  56\nPvt Ltd v Sun Travels  & Tours Pvt  Ltd\nreceptionist and the defendant, as evidenced from its letter to the plaintiff, had \nclearly been aware of OS 845, but had refused to accept service.  By sending  the \ne-mails to the defendant\u2019s chairman\/managing  director as well the senior \nexecutive director, the plaintiff had taken  reasonable steps to bring to the \ndefendant\u2019s attention the application and the plaintiff had also attempted to \nascertain the defendant\u2019s  preferred method of service. Further,  there  would be \nvery little prejudice  to the defendant should the irregularity in service be cured,  \nand I thus exercised my discretion to cure the irregularity. \n36 As for the argument that there was no accompanying translation  of OS \n845 into Dhivehi  as required by O 11 r 4(4) of the Rules,  Mr Landau  argues that \ntranslation is not required as personal service was effected under  O 11 r 3 of the \nRules. I agree. Order 11 r 4(4) applies  to service  described under O 11 r 4(2)( c) \nand r 4(3).  \n37 I thus found that the court  had jurisdiction over the defendant for the \npurposes of  granting the permanent anti-suit injunction and declaratory relief.\nWhether the court has power to grant a permanent anti-suit injunction\n38 I then turned to the question of whether  the court has power to grant a \npermanent anti-suit injunction in relation to foreign court proceedings  in the \narbitration context. I found that the court had such a power, which  stemmed \nfrom the court\u2019s general power to give legal  and equitable relief (s 18(2) read \nwith para 14 of the First Schedule of the SCJA), and that this power was not \ncurtailed by Art 5 of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial \nArbitration (\u201cModel Law\u201d). Section  4(10) of the Civil Law Act (Cap  43, 1999 \n18\nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nHilton International  Manage (Maldives)  [2018]  SGHC  56\nPvt Ltd v Sun Travels  & Tours Pvt  Ltd\nRev Ed) (\u201cCLA\u201d)  relates  to the court\u2019s  powers  to grant an interim injunction. I \nwill elaborate on this below.\nThe source of  the court\u2019s  power\n39 On the question of the source  of the court\u2019s  power, I started with the two \nplaces where the court\u2019s power to grant  a permanent  anti-suit injunction cannot \nbe found. First, the court does not have  the power under the International \nArbitration Act (Cap  143A,  2002 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe IAA\u201d) to grant  a permanent \nanti-suit injunction. Its power to grant injunctions under the IAA is only limited \nto granting  an interim injunction: s 12A(2)  read with s 12(1)(i ) of the IAA. This \nwas acknowledged by Judith Prakash J (as she then was)  in the case of R1 \nInternational Pte Ltd v Lonstroff AG [2014] 3 SLR 166 (\u201cRI International \n(HC)\u201d) at [40].\n40 Second,  looking beyond the IAA and to the court\u2019s  broader civil \njurisdiction, the court does not have the power  to grant a permanent anti-suit \ninjunction by virtue of s 4(10) of the CLA. The plaintiff\u2019s initial argument on s \n4(10) of the CLA relied on Prakash  J\u2019s decision  in R1 International (HC). \nPrakash J  held (at [43])  that:\n\u2026 the court\u2019s  general injunctive power  emanates from s 4(10) \nof the CLA. This is the power that the court  exercises when  it \ngrants a permanent anti-suit injunction in aid of local court \nproceedings. There  is no reason why this power  cannot be \nexercised to make permanent anti-suit injunctions in aid of \ndomestic international arbitration  proceedings especially  \nsince\u2026 the courts  can grant interim anti-suit injunctions in \nsuch situations. \n41 I respectfully disagree with the analysis  in R1 International (HC) on s \n4(10) of the CLA  being the source of the court\u2019s power to grant a permanent \n19\nVersion No 2: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nHilton International  Manage (Maldives)  [2018]  SGHC  56\nPvt Ltd v Sun Travels  & Tours Pvt  Ltd\nanti-suit injunction. In doing  so, I note that the analysis in R1 International in \nthis regard was obiter as Prakash J had already  held (at [35]) that the arbitration  \nagreement had not been incorporated on the purchase order from  which the \ndispute arose. There  was thus no breach of the arbitration agreement  and no \nbasis upon which  to grant  a permanent anti-injunction injunction. Although the \nCourt of"}

However, in order to bid for the concessions, the bidding company must have technical expertise. Rahmad and Indratono therefore approached PT Pertamina (Persero) (\u201cPertamina\u201d), a state-owned Indonesian company which had the requisite technical expertise for exploring and developing the oil and gas concessions.', '4\\u2003At the same time, Rahmad and Indratono also approached Pascal Crepin (\u201cCrepin\u201d) and Cheong Kum Hong (\u201cKum Hong\u201d) in order to secure funding for the Venture. At that time, Crepin was the managing director of CAMA and Kum Hong was an employee of CAMA. Crepin and Kum Hong were also directors of CAB. Whether Crepin and Kum Hong were also representatives of Commerzbank or whether they held themselves out as such is in dispute. During the meeting between Indratono, Rahmad, Crepin and Kum Hong in April or May 2005, Crepin and Cheong informed Rahmad and Indratono that Commerzbank\u2019s internal corporate policy prohibited it from committing any funds towards bidding for projects and Rahmad and Indratono would therefore need to find investors to put in money to win the bid. At the same time, Crepin and Cheong are said to have made the following representations (\u201cthe First Set of Representations\u201d):', '(a)\\u2003Commerzbank and\/or CAMA would provide and\/or raise the funds needed for the Venture after the bids were successful;', '(b)\\u2003Commerzbank was a major and reputable German bank and one of the few banks in the world that could perform banking activities in Libya, despite the embargo against Libya;', '(c)\\u2003Commerzbank had the financial resources and capability to raise and\/or provide the funding required for the Venture;', '(d)\\u2003CAMA was a fully-owned subsidiary of Commerzbank and the vehicle through which Commerzbank operated various business and investment activities;', '(e)\\u2003CAMA had the full backing of Commerzbank in all its business and investment activities;', '(f)\\u2003CAMA would structure the business and financing model for the Venture, which would involve setting up a corporate vehicle which would be used to channel the funding for the Venture; and', '(g)\\u2003The corporate vehicle to be set up would be named \u201cCommerz Asia Emerald\u201d.', '5\\u2003Since Commerzbank and\/or CAMA would not provide funding to Rahmad and Indratono for the bid, the two investors, Rahmad and Indratono approached Raymond to discuss funding possibilities. Rahmad and Indratono purportedly repeated the First Set of Representations to Raymond. Raymond agreed to meet with Crepin and Cheong to discuss the possible participation of the 2nd plaintiff (\u201cPT CBS\u201d) in the venture. At the meeting, Crepin and Cheong informed Raymond that the investors would have to provide the initial funding to make the bids for the concessions but allegedly represented that (\u201cthe Second Set of Representations\u201d)', '(a)\\u2003Commerzbank and\/or CAMA would provide and\/or raise the funds needed for the Venture after the bids were successful;', '(b)\\u2003Commerzbank was a major and reputable German bank and one of the few banks in the world that could perform banking activities in Libya, despite the embargo against Libya;', '(c)\\u2003Commerzbank had the financial resources and capability to raise and\/or provide the funding required for the Venture; and', '(d)\\u2003Commerz Asia Emerald was an incorporated company and a wholly owned subsidiary of CAMA, which was in turn a wholly owned subsidiary of Commerzbank.', '6\\u2003The plaintiffs claim that, in reliance on the Second Set of Representations, Raymond agreed to arrange for PT CBS to invest in the venture. PT CBS thus paid a sum of US$500,000 to CAMA as funding towards the bid. About this time, the parties also agreed to engage a consultant firm, Med Energy Co Ltd (\u201cMed Energy\u201d) to obtain pre-qualification approvals for the purposes of bidding for the concessions. A service agreement was entered into between Med Energy and CAE SPC (\u201cthe Service Agreement\u201d). CAE SPC is said to stand for CAE Segregated Portfolio Company. It is disputed whether or not CAE SPC was represented by Crepin and Kum Hong to be an independent company. In any case, the Service Agreement provided, inter alia, first, that Med Energy would be paid a sum of US$500,000 by a certain date to obtain pre-qualification approvals for the bids and second, that Med Energy would be paid a sum of US$12m as a success fee should CAE\u2019s bid be successful. The sum of US$500,000 provided by PT CBS was used to fulfil the first part of the Service Agreement.', '7\\u2003Relying on the Second Set of Representations, PT CBS issued a standby letter of credit for the sum of US$7,905,000 for the purposes of the bids. According to the plaintiffs, it was understood that payment of US$500,000 as well as the letter of credit were made on the basis that the 1st plaintiff (\u201cLong Well\u201d) and\/or PT CBS would be shareholder(s) in CAE and would have a say as to who could invest in the Venture should the bid be successful.', '8\\u2003Pertamina and CAE then set up a joint venture company to bid for the concessions. The joint venture company, Pertamina E&P Libya (\u201cPEPL\u201d), was incorporated with Pertamina holding 55% shares and CAE holding 45% shares. In October 2005, PEPL was informed that its bid was successful.', '9\\u2003After PEPL\u2019s successful bid, Raymond met Cheong to discuss the structure of the investment. The plaintiffs claim that Cheong advised Raymond that the Venture should be owned by Commerzbank, CAMA and\/or CAB but in view of the initial funding by the plaintiffs, Raymond\u2019s companies including Long Well, would be given \u201cClass A\u201d shares in CAE at a preferential price whereas subsequent investors sourced by Commerzbank and CAMA would only be given \u201cClass B\u201d and \u201cClass C\u201d shares.', '10\\u2003The plaintiffs claim that Cheong also made the following representations (\u201cthe Third Set of Representations):', '(a)\\u2003Commerzbank already had existing clients who were eager to join and invest in the Venture;', '(b)\\u2003The financial model and structure for the investment in the Venture was via the issuance of shareholdings in CAE; and', '(c)\\u2003Cheong was setting up a shareholding structure (in which the shares in CAE are divided into the three different classes) in order to obtain the necessary funding from investors.', '11\\u2003This was in contrast to what Raymond thought the structure would be. According to him, it was assumed that the plaintiffs would enjoy full control and ownership of CAE since PT CBS provided the initial funding for the bids. After learning about the proposed ownership structure of the fund, the plaintiffs did not want to provide any further funds for the Venture until the plaintiffs or any of them had full control and ownership of CAE, and therefore ownership of CAE\u2019s 45% shareholding in PEPL. The plaintiffs thus began exploring the purchase of the ownership of CAE. At the same time, it seemed that CAE had difficulties meeting its payment obligations to Med Energy under the Service Agreement. All these culminated in a Memorandum of Understanding for the Transfer of Ownership of Commerz Asia Emerald SPC (\u201cthe Transfer Agreement\u201d) between Long Well, PT CBS and CAMA.', '12\\u2003The Transfer Agreement, entered into on 3 February 2006, provided, inter alia, that', '(a)\\u2003CAMA had full legal rights to transfer the ownership of CAE and this was to comprise all its rights and obligations of CAE;', '(b)\\u2003Long Well and PT CBS were to have full ownership of CAE by purchasing 85% and 15% of the participating shares of CAE respectively;', '(c)\\u2003Long Well and PT CBS were to pay US$500,000 to CAMA and\/or CAB on the date of transfer of ownership of CAE (which was not to be later than 31 March 2006); and', '(d)\\u2003Long Well and PT CBS were to pay the sum of US$12m to CAMA and\/or CAB after 30 business days of the date of the transfer of ownership of CAE. This was said to comprise the full consultancy fee to CAMA.', 'On the same day, 3 February 2006, Long Well and PT CBS subscribed for shares in CAE by way of signing two share subscription agreements (\u201cShare Subscription Agreements\u201d). These were entered into to effect the transfer of ownership of CAE by way of transferring the participating shares in CAE to Long Well and PT CBS. The agreements provided, inter alia, that Long Well and PT CBS were to pay the sums of US$9,375,000 and US$5,643,000 respectively to purchase participating shares in CAE at the nominal value of US$375 per share.', '13\\u2003Pursuant to the Transfer Agreement and the Share Subscription Agreements, Long Well paid US$9,375,000 to CAB and PT CBS made a payment of US$5,643,000 to CAB. This amounted to US$15,018,000 (\u201cthe Share Subscription Sum\u201d). This amount was subsequently transferred to the National Oil Corporation of Libya (\u201cNOC\u201d) to fulfil the signature bonus payable by PEPL as part of winning the bids. PT CBS also made the following payments, totalling US$3m, pursuant to clause 2.4 of the Transfer Agreement (\u201cthe Transfer Agreement Miscellaneous Sums\u201d):', '14\\u2003A third share subscription agreement was entered into by the 3rd plaintiff (\u201cPrivate Energy\u201d) on 13 June 2006 in order for the participation shares subscribed for by PT CBS to be transferred to Private Energy.', '15\\u2003Having won the bids, CAE and Pertamina entered into a Joint Operating Agreement (\u201cthe JOA\u201d). Under the JOA, CAE was obliged to provide the funding required for the exploration and development of the oil and gas concessions. In July 2006, Pertamina and CAE entered into negotiations for Pertamina to sell to CAE a 30% share in PEPL for the sum of US$16.5m. This was to enable CAE to increase its shareholding in PEPL. In particular, the plaintiffs were said to be interested to acquire a majority stake in PEPL so as to acquire a direct stake in the profits gained from the Venture. The plaintiffs claim that the 4th plaintiff (\u201cFirst Power\u201d) made a down payment of US$1.5m for the purchase of Pertamina\u2019s 30% share in PEPL (\u201cPEPL Share Purchase Sum\u201d) but that this sum was used to partially discharge CAE\u2019s payment obligations under the JOA to fund the operations of PEPL. In January and September 2007, Private Energy and First Power provided further funding amounting to US$250,000 and US$1,404,983 to enable PEPL to meet its payment obligations to the NOC (\u201cthe PEPL Advance Payments\u201d). Private Energy and First Power also covered travel and ancillary expenses incurred as part of the Venture (\u201cthe Travel and Ancillary Expenses\u201d).', '16\\u2003In December 2010, Raymond was informed by the defendants\u2019 representative that the PEPL shares owned by CAE had been transferred to Pertamina pursuant to an arbitration award. Although it is unclear to me what led to this, it is undisputed that there were arbitration proceedings between Pertamina and CAB which resulted in Pertamina being granted an award compelling CAB and CAE to transfer CAE\u2019s 45% shareholdings in PEPL to Pertamina. The plaintiffs report that the arbitration tribunal found CAB to have breached its payment obligations under the JOA. In any case, as a result of the arbitration proceedings, CAE lost its 45% shareholding in PEPL, which the plaintiffs claim were CAE\u2019s only assets.'"}

In consideration for this release, the Company would execute a trust receipt on terms that the Company held the financed stock or its proceeds of sale on trust for the bank. The trust receipts typically identified the financed stock with reference to their corresponding bill of lading number, invoice number and\/or a description of the financed stock. 1', '3\\u2003After the Company became insolvent, the Liquidators were informed of stock in the Company\u2019s possession which was held in a warehouse in Singapore, which included 17 different categories of pepper. 2', 'As they were perishable, the plaintiff proposed to sell the stock and hold the proceeds on trust for the creditors pending the determination of their claims.

The intervening time was taken up for the \naccused to obtain new counsel.  Mr Ramesh Tiwary now appeared \nfor the accused and maintained the application for the retraction of \nthe plea.   On the court\u2019s direction, the accused had put forward his \ngrounds for doing  so in an affidavit (\u201caccused\u2019s first affidavit\u201d) filed \non the 12 February 2018.  I quote from  paras  3,  4 and 9:\n3. On the day that [Shanti]  concluded her \nevidence in chief my lawyer at that time Mr. Edmond  \nPereira spoke to me in the court.   He advised me that \nthe evidence against me was strong in view of \nShanti\u2019s evidence.  If I lost the case I could be \nsentenced to death.  He asked me if he could make \nrepresentations to the DPP to reduce the capital \ncharge to one that did not attract the death sentence. \n I would have to plead guilty to this amended  charge. \n I think  we spoke for about 45 minutes.  At the \nconclusion of that meeting I said I would not plead  \nguilty.  He told me to think again  and to inform him \nthe next day.  He gave me a piece  of paper to write  \nwhat I intended to do.\n4. The next morning he met me again.  He asked  \nfor my decision.  At first I said that I would not plead \nguilty.  He advised me again that the evidence \nagainst me was strong.  He advised me to think of my \nfamily, my son and wife.  That day was my son\u2019s  \nbirthday.  I was very emotional.  I felt no one believed \nme.  Everyone  believed  Shanti.   I felt alone as if no \none was helping me.  I was feeling very depressed.  I \n3\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Mangalagiri Dhruva Kumar [2018]  SGHC  62\n \nwas also missing my son more than ever because it \nwas his birthday.  So I agreed to plead  guilt.\n9. The next time my lawyer saw me at Changi \nprison I told him I did not want to plead guilty.  He \nsaid he would then have withdraw  from the case. I \nsaid okay.\n4 The accused added, \u201cI was very emotional and I had been \ncrying.  I was thinking about my son more than ever.  In those \ncircumstances I broke down.  I agreed  to plead guilty.  I simply gave \nup.  I am not guilty of the offence  or the reduced charge  to which  I \npleaded guilty.  I did not give Shanti  anything.  Therefore I cannot  \nplead guilty.\u201d5\n5 The affidavit  was served on Mr Pereira who made  the \nfollowing comments in his affidavit  (\u201cMr Pereira\u2019s affidavit\u201d):\n8. Save for the fact that I advised the Accused \nthat the evidence  against  him was strong in view of \nShanti\u2019s evidence, paragraphs 3 and 4 of the \nAccused\u2019s affidavit  is untrue.\n9. I spoke  with the Accused at length after the \nadjourned hearing. I advised the Accused that the \nevidence against him was strong. There were \ncircumstances in which if he were questioned \nfollowing Shanti\u2019s evidence, he would not be able to \nanswer as he had difficulty  explaining when  I \nquestioned him. I informed him that he was dealing  \nwith his life. I told him that I had spoken with the \nProsecution earlier that day and the Prosecution had \nindicated that in the event he elects to plead guilty,  \nthe Prosecution  will consider proceeding  on a non-\n5 The accused\u2019s first affidavit at paras 10  and 11.\n4\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Mangalagiri Dhruva Kumar [2018]  SGHC  62\n \ncapital charge and offer him a sentence  between  26-\n30 years\u2019 imprisonment. However, that \ndetermination will have to be considered by the \nProsecution after they have considered our \nRepresentations. Without a moment of hesitation, \nthe Accused  immediately agreed to plead  guilty to the \ncharge. I told the Accused not to make a rash \ndecision. I provided  the Accused  with a piece  of paper \nto confirm  his instructions to me that he wish to \nplead guilty to the charge. The Accused  asked me \nwhat he should  write. I told him that if he wishes to \nplead guilty,  he can write to me his instructions.  He \nthen wrote on the piece of paper I provided. After he \nfinished writing,  I told him to keep the paper with \nhim and to take some time to think about his \ndecision and to inform me on the following day what \nhe intends to do and if he still wishes  to plead guilty  \nto the charge, he can than hand his written \ninstructions to me. \u2026\n6 Mr Pereira further added that he received the signed note from  \nthe accused on the morning  of 27 July 2017. Thereafter,  \nrepresentations were  made to the Prosecution. On 28 July 2017, Mr \nPereira went through the SOF with the accused. Mr Pereira informed  \nthe accused that pleading guilty was \u201ca choice that he has to make \nfreely to which  he responded that he understood\u201d.6 Throughout the \ndiscussion, the accused maintained his decision to plead guilty.\n7 When Mr Pereira visited the accused on 19 August 2017 in \nChangi Prison, the accused was told that the Prosecution would be \nseeking a sentence of at least 28 years\u2019  imprisonment. The accused  \n6 Mr Pereira\u2019s affidavit at  para  12.\n5\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Mangalagiri Dhruva Kumar [2018]  SGHC  62\n \nasked if Mr Pereira could request the court  to impose a sentence  of \n20 years\u2019 imprisonment.  Mr Pereira said he would try for 24 years\u2019 \nto 26 years\u2019  imprisonment. Instructions  were taken to prepare for a \nwritten mitigation on his behalf. The accused did not ask to retract \nhis plea on 19 August 2017.  The first time Mr Pereira was told that \nthe accused  wanted to retract his  plea was  on 11 September 2017.7\n8 In his affidavit  of 26 February  2018 (\u201caccused\u2019s  second \naffidavit\u201d), the accused responded to Mr Pereira\u2019s affidavit. The \naccused conceded that he had agreed to plead guilty on 26 July 2017 \nand not on 27  July  2017.\n9 The accused also claimed that he had no difficulty  explaining  \nto Mr Pereira the facts of his case. He maintained that during Mr \nPereira\u2019s visit to Changi  Prison  on 19 August 2017, he had told Mr \nPereira he wished to retract his plea.\n10 On analysis, it should be plain  what  the accused was not \nsaying.  He was not challenging the procedure for or that he had \nentered the plea of guilt.  He had sufficient time for consideration \nand was granted  such time as was requested to reach  his decision.  \nThe accused  was not alleging that he had misunderstood the \n7 Mr Pereira\u2019s affidavit at  paras  14 and 15.\n6\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Mangalagiri Dhruva Kumar [2018]  SGHC  62\n \nsituation. Further, the accused was not criticizing Mr Pereira\u2019s  \nadvice and conduct as counsel.  \n11 I found that in the circumstances, the accused\u2019s  plea of guilt \nwas voluntarily made,  with full presence of mind as to the nature of \nthe plea, the offence and the facts he was admitting  to. His present \nallegations were  a belated afterthought, and in any event,  they were  \ninsufficient in law  to enable him  to retract his plea.\n12 To begin, I noted that the accused\u2019s initial account was that \nafter 45 minutes  of discussion on 26 July 2017, he refused to plead \nguilty. Conversely, Mr Pereira claimed the accused wished to plead  \nguilty after the discussion \u201c[w]ithout a moment of hesitation\u201d.8 The \naccused was asked to, and did, write out his instructions on 26 July \n2017. He  was asked to think  through  his plea until the next day.\n13 When faced with Mr Pereira\u2019s affidavit, the accused \neventually conceded he had agreed to plead guilty by 26 July 2017 \nafter all. Objectively,  it was hard for the accused to deny this as his \nnote containing  his instructions  was signed twice and dated twice on \n26 July 2017,  with a correction that indicated the accused\u2019s mind \nwas directed  to the date.  It was fairly obvious that the accused  \nindicated he wanted to plead guilty  by 26 July 2017.\n8 Mr Pereira\u2019s affidavit at  para  9.\n7\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Mangalagiri Dhruva Kumar [2018]  SGHC  62\n \n14 What also could not be controverted  was that the sentencing  \nconsequences of pleading guilty  were explained to him. The \naccused\u2019s vacillating accounts aside, it was clear that Mr Pereira  was \naware that the situation was delicate and gave him time to ponder \nover the plea before  it was formally entered in court.\n15 Next,  as to the accused\u2019s  claim that he had told Mr Pereira he \nwished to retract his plea on 19 August 2017, I found this most \nunlikely. In representing the accused, having had 14 interviews with \nhim, 9 Mr Pereira  had shown  himself to be careful  and conscientious. \nOn 6 September 2017, Mr Pereira had filed a detailed mitigation and \nsubmissions on sentence. If Mr Pereira had been informed of the \naccused\u2019s wish to retract his plea by 19 August  2017, he would have \nimmediately informed the Prosecution  and the court. There would \nbe no reason to do all  that work  and to persist in filing the papers. \n16 I also noted  that the mitigation plea and submissions  could \nonly have  been prepared under the accused\u2019s instructions.10 It was \napparent that Mr Pereira attended the chambers discussion on 11 \nSeptember 2017 on sentence with no inkling that the accused had \nchanged his mind, until parties were about  to submit  in open court \n(see [2] above).11 All that Mr Pereira  could tell the court on 11 \n9 Mr Pereira\u2019s affidavit, para 4.\n10 Mr Pereira\u2019s affidavit at para 14; Prosecution\u2019s  Submissions  \n(Retraction of Plea) at para 53.\n8\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Mangalagiri Dhruva Kumar [2018]  SGHC  62\n \nSeptember 2017  was that \u201cI spoke to the accused person in regard to \nthe sentence that the prosecution has proposed as part of the sentence \nthey are asking the Court to impose on him in light of his plea of \nguilt.\u201d12  The accused told the court  that he did not admit  to the \nreduced charge (\u201cD\u201d) and the SOF.13 The accused\u2019s inconsistent  \nstance was juxtaposed against  Mr Pereira\u2019s consistent account. In \nmy judgment, the accused\u2019s  claim that he had tried to retract  his plea \nas early as  19 August  2017 was  untrue.\n17 The foregoing findings raised the scenario that between 28 \nJuly 2017  and 11 September 2017, the accused had not notified his \ncounsel or anyone  else about the involuntariness  of his plea, or his \nemotional state. I had serious doubts about the accused\u2019s bona fides \nin this application  and the truthfulness of the reasons stated for the \nchange of  plea.\n18 In any event, the accused had not provided the court with \n\u201cvalid and sufficient grounds  which satisfy  the [trial judge] that it is \nproper and in the interests of justice that he should be allowed to\u201d \nretract his plea, or that indicated a qualification of his plea (Ganesun \n11 Transcript, Day  5 (11 September 2017), p 1.\n12 Transcript, Day  5 (11 September 2017), p 1.\n13 Transcript, Day  5 (11 September 2017), p 2.\n9\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Mangalagiri Dhruva Kumar [2018]  SGHC  62\n \ns\/o Kannan v Public Prosecutor [1996]  3 SLR(R) 125 (\u201cGanesun\u201d)  \nat [12], citing  Public  Prosecutor v  Sam Kim Kai [1960] MLJ 265).\n19 The above was reflected in s 228(4) of the Criminal  Procedure  \nCode (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (\u201cCPC\u201d), which states:\n228.-(4) Where  the court is satisfied that any \nmatter raised  in the plea in mitigation materially \naffects any legal condition required by law to \nconstitute the offence charged, the court must reject \nthe plea of guilty.\n20 After an accused had admitted  to the Statement of Facts and \nprior to sentence  being passed, the issue here commonly arose in two \nmain scenarios. The first was where the plea of guilt was qualified, \nwhether by matters raised  in mitigation (as contemplated in s 228(4) \nof the CPC), or by any matter that may come to the notice of the \ncourt.14\n21 In the ordinary course, the circumstances of the qualification  \nwould have made it obvious, or upon closer elucidation the court \nwould have discerned, that an accused was manifestly labouring \nunder a mistake or misunderstanding  (see Ganesun at [13], Md \nRafiqul Islam  Abdul Aziz v Public Prosecutor [2017] 3 SLR 619 at \n[32], [33]).  Indeed, s 228(4) of the CPC was generally invoked in \nsituations where despite an accused\u2019s insistence  on pleading guilty,  \n14 Transcript, Day  6 (2 March 2018), p 18.\n10\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Mangalagiri Dhruva Kumar [2018]  SGHC  62\n \nthe court  could not accept  the plea, as it was not a knowing  plea of \nguilt at first instance.15 This was similar  to where  the situation \nrevealed some undue pressure, alerting the court that the initial  plea \nwas not voluntarily entered  into (Chng Leng Khim v Public  \nProsecutor and another matter [2016] 5 SLR 1219 at [18]). These \nsituations showed that despite adherence to the procedural \nsafeguards of s 227(2) of the CPC  and the admission to the Statement \nof Facts,  an accused had manifestly not understood his plea or did \nnot genuinely have the freedom to choose  how to plead and the court  \nmust reject  the plea (Thong Sing Hock  v Public Prosecutor  [2009] 3 \nSLR(R) 47 at [23]).\n22 In the other scenario, there would be situations where  an \naccused applied to retract his plea after what appeared to be a \nconsidered and voluntary plea. The court was duty bound to enquire \ninto the reasons  for the change in mind  because an \u201caccused person \ncannot be permitted merely at whim to change his plea\u201d (Ganesun \nat [12], citing Public Prosecutor v Sam Kim Kai [1960] MLJ 265).  \nMore seriously,  a purely  tactical decision by an accused to resile  \nfrom a valid plea might represent an attempt to \u201cgame the criminal  \nprocess\u201d.16 Moreover,  an accused may not disclose the real reason \nfor his change of position.17\n15 Transcript, Day  6 (2 March 2018), pp 14  and 15.\n16 Prosecution\u2019s Submissions (Retraction of Plea)  at para 70.\n11\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Mangalagiri Dhruva Kumar [2018]  SGHC  62\n \n23 If there were indeed  no valid or sufficient reasons for \nretraction, then the legal  conditions  to constitute the offence were \nunaffected, let alone \u201cmaterially affect[ed]\u201d under s 228(4) of the \nCPC. This would be the case despite the accused\u2019s  ex post facto \nassertions that he did not  admit to the reduced  charge  and the SOF.18\n24 As Justice  White stated  in Brady v. United States  397 U.S.  \n742, 749 (1970)  (\u201cBrady\u201d):\nThat a guilty plea is a grave  and solemn act to be \naccepted only with care and discernment has long \nbeen recognized. Central to the plea and the \nfoundation for entering judgment against the \ndefendant is the defendant\u2019s admission in open court \nthat he committed  the acts charged in the \nindictment. He thus stands as a witness against \nhimself and he is shielded by the Fifth Amendment \nfrom being compelled to do so \u2013 hence  the minimum \nrequirement that his plea be the voluntary \nexpression of his own choice . But the plea is more \nthan an admission of past conduct; it is the \ndefendant\u2019s consent  that judgment of conviction may \nbe entered without a trial \u2013 a waiver of his right to trial \nbefore a jury or a judge.  Waivers of constitutional \nrights not only must be voluntary  but must be \nknowing, intelligent acts done with sufficient \nawareness of the relevant circumstances  and likely  \nconsequences. \u2026\n[Emphases added]\n17 Defence\u2019s Submissions on Retraction of Plea at para 21.\n18 Transcript, Day  5 (11 September 2017), p 2.\n12\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Mangalagiri Dhruva Kumar [2018]  SGHC  62\n \n25 Notwithstanding the constitutional context in Brady, I found  \nthese observations  apposite. In our system, an accused\u2019s plea of guilt \nsimilarly formed  the legal basis for the accused\u2019s conviction  without  \na full trial and the attendant consequences  (see Koh Bak Kiang v \nPublic Prosecutor  [2016] 2 SLR 574 at [43]). As such,  if the accused \nwere able to show valid and sufficient grounds for the retraction of \nhis plea, then like the qualification of plea situations mentioned,  the \ncourt was duty  bound to  allow the application for  retraction.\n26 Because of the grave consequences of a guilty plea,  it had to \nbe taken with care and due attention  to the substantive nature of the \nplea. In this case,  Mr Pereira and I had repeatedly  clarified with the \naccused that he understood the nature and consequences of his plea \nand that he wanted to plead guilty.19\n27 In terms  of substance, the accused understood and admitted \nfully to the offence  and the SOF, which stated he had delivered the \ndrugs to Shanti and moreover  that he knew the plastic  bag he was \ndelivering contained two packets of heroin.20 It must  be appreciated \nthat the accused was someone  with the actual knowledge of the facts  \nunderlying the offence he was charged with. With  that knowledge,  \nthe accused \u201cagreed  to plead guilty\u201d.21 Borrowing from the language  \n19 Transcript, Day 4 (28 July 2017), pp 1-3, 8; Prosecution\u2019s \nSubmissions (Retraction  of Plea) at  paras  21 and 26.\n20  SOF at para 9.\n13\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v Mangalagiri Dhruva Kumar [2018]  SGHC  62\n \nof Brady (at p 749), the accused\u2019s plea was in essence an \nunequivocal admission  to the offence; he stood  \u201cas witness against  \nhimself\u201d.\n28 I was mindful of the danger of accused  persons pleading \nguilty despite their innocence (see comments in Public Prosecutor  v \nLiew Kim Choo  [1997] 2 SLR(R) 716 at [89(a)]). I was also \nsympathetic that accused persons faced powerful pressures to plead \nguilty in the case of capital charges that were  reduced. However, \neven if I accepted Mr Tiwary\u2019s submission  that the accused was \naffected by emotional pressure, \u201calbeit one that was not caused by \nanyone else\u201d,22 that was a far cry from a situation of an involuntary  \nplea. Even if his allegations were  true, that would  only amount to \nself-induced pressure, which was not a valid ground for retraction \nunder the law (Lee Eng Hock v Public  Prosecutor [2002] 1 SLR(R) \n204 at [9]).23 \n29 As was the case, I had serious doubts about  the accused\u2019s \nalleged \u201cdepressed\u201d24 and \u201cvery emotional\u201d25 state.

The accused\u2019s \nclaim was a convenient excuse.  Significantly, I was certain that his \nemotional state did not affect  his capacity  to appreciate and consider \nhis decision to  plead  guilty  and admit  to the SOF.\n30 All that the accused\u2019s affidavits  could  establish was that he \npleaded guilty after he had duly considered Mr Pereira\u2019s advice.26 \nHaving heard the evidence-in-chief  of the Prosecution\u2019s main \nwitness, Shanti, he assessed his chances at trial.

They were  not the lawyers in the  previous  action.\n8 The narrative now turns to this \u201cAh Kee\u201d. He was called as Ong Lu \nLing\u2019s witness but clearly has more answers  than the plaintiff herself,  thus \nsatisfying me that the solitary truth from Ong Lu Ling, albeit  through her \ncounsel Mr Gong, is that she was Ah Kee\u2019s nominee. Ah Kee testified  that he \nis in the business of money lending, and has been  made a bankrupt. He said that \nhe had helped  Tan Ho Seng find a buyer for one of Tan Ho Seng\u2019s  residential \nproperties in  2010.\n9 From  Tan Ho Seng\u2019s evidence-in-chief  the court was told that Ah Kee \nalso had a money remittance business in which Tan Ho Seng and his wife \ninvested in for a return of 2% a month. It was also averred that Tan Ho Seng\u2019s \nson, Tan Pei Wei,  now 33 years old, worked for Ah Kee. Ah Kee acknowledged  \nthat he owed money to Tan Ho Seng, but says that the debt was assigned  to \nTan Pei  Wei around  2011.\n10 Given  the bizarre relationships,  the plaintiff has at least the burden of \nexplaining how the defendant has enriched  himself at her expense.

More importantly, she has not explained why there was no \nresistance when Abdullah JC made his orders in the previous  suit. No reason \nwas given as to why the plaintiff or Ah Kee had not told Abdullah JC that the \n$600,000 belonged to the plaintiff, and how it came  to be a loan in both of those  \nsuits and this.\n11 Unjust enrichment  is an equitable relief, and equity is a fastidious and \nexacting companion of law; she demands that all supplicants before her arrive \nin court with clean hands.

If a name  must be given to that judicial exercise, one can, \nperhaps, call it the balsamic  test, but we should wean  ourselves of the obsession  \nto name  everything that appears new, especially when it is just plain, old, \ncommon sense. I am of the opinion that Dr Tan  was negligent  in law in sending  \n6\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nArmstrong, Carol Ann v  Quest Laboratories Pte Ltd [2018]  SGHC  66 \na report indicating a clean bill of health when the circumstances required,  at the \nvery least, further  examination on his part. The questions that follow from  this \nare more difficult.\n9 Did Dr Tan\u2019s negligence cause Peter  Traynor\u2019s death, and even if not, \nwhat damages are the dependants entitled  to? Miss Kang submitted that even if \nDr Tan had been negligent,  his report did not cause  Peter Traynor\u2019s  death. She \npresented a strong argument that by the time Dr Tan examined the specimen \nin September 2009 the cancer had metastasised,  that is, it had already spread \nthroughout Peter Traynor\u2019s  body, and Dr Tan should not be held accountable \nfor the inevitable  consequence of a rampaging cancer that could not, by that \ntime, be stopped. She relied on Prof Chia\u2019s  evidence in support. The plaintiff  \ncalled Prof McCarthy in response. Prof McCarthy says that the cancer had not \nspread beyond the armpits until after 2009. Therefore, he says,  surgical removal \n(known as sentinel node biopsy) of the affected  lymph nodes would have \narrested the spread of  the cancer.\n10 Prof McCarthy refers to the undisputed fact that in 2012 when  the \ndoctors realised that Peter Traynor\u2019s  mole  was cancerous, they examined the \nsurrounding area where  the mole  had been (it was removed entirely when they \ntook the specimen for Dr Tan\u2019s examination) and found no cancerous  cells.  His \npoint is that if the primary site was clear after the biopsy in 2009, the cancer  had \nonly spread to Peter Traynor\u2019s lymph nodes at the right and left armpits  and \nthereafter, rapidly  and fatally to the rest  of his body.\n11 In Prof Chia\u2019s opinion, by 2009 the cancer cells had already spread \nelsewhere and not just to the lymphatic nodes in Peter Traynor\u2019s armpits.  He \nthinks that the cancer could have spread microscopically and not just through \n7\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nArmstrong, Carol Ann v  Quest Laboratories Pte Ltd [2018]  SGHC  66 \nthe lymphatic system. He explains that the cancer  cells can enter the blood  \nsystem as well,  and although most cells get eliminated, the few that are not \neliminated, and do not grow,  will lie dormant. That was what happened to Peter \nTraynor. In Prof Chia\u2019s opinion, by 2009, Peter Traynor\u2019s  body was already  \nharbouring dormant melanoma cells in many places, and not just the lymph \nnodes. In other words, Prof Chia is of the view that by 2009, the prognosis was \nalready bad.\n12 Those  opposing  views led the experts  to clash  over what  is known  as \n\u2018cancer staging\u2019. That is the classification by oncologists as to how far a cancer \nhas progressed, and that, in turn, determines the chances  of survival. \nProf McCarthy and Prof Kirkham  rely heavily on the statistics published in the \n8th edition of the American  Joint Committee on Cancer\u2019s Staging Manual \n(\u201cAJCC\u201d). Prof Chia is sceptical over some  parts of the AJCC  for its limitations, \nwhich were acknowledged in the AJCC,  and some  incongruity as to why the \nsurvival rate for stage  T3a is higher than for stage T2b. Nonetheless,  He is \nprepared to accept it generally, and maintains that even so, the correct staging \nfor Peter Traynor should be \u2018T2b, N2a\u2019, whereas Prof McCarthy says it was just \n\u2018T2b\u2019. The technical details revolve  around disagreements as to how widespread \nPeter Traynor\u2019s cancer was in 2009, and that, as we have seen,  left the experts \nat an impasse. The relevance  and importance  of the opposing views on staging  \nis that on Prof McCarthy\u2019s  staging, Peter  Traynor had a 10-year survival of at \nleast 68%,  and closer to 80% had the melanoma been diagnosed  in 2009. \nProf Chia says that  it was less than  50%.\n13 Prof Chia holds his views, as confidently as Dr Kirkham and \nProf McCarthy hold theirs. The difficulty here is that although  only one view \n8\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nArmstrong, Carol Ann v  Quest Laboratories Pte Ltd [2018]  SGHC  66 \nmay be right, there is no fail-proof way of determining which  one that is. The \nreason is that it is possible for the cancer to have  spread beyond  the lymph nodes \nby 2009, just as it was possible for it to have spread after. We sometimes avoid \nconsidering the impact of the possibility of possibilities by creating a refuge that \nwe confidently name \u2018probability\u2019, but that is a vulnerable hideout because \nprobability, by definition, admits other  possibilities.  Nevertheless, it is the \ncourt\u2019s duty to evaluate competing possibilities  and decide which is the most \nprobable on the evidence before it.\n14 The court is not at all qualified to determine which expert is more \ncompetent or which of them has greater expertise than the other. All it can do is \nto evaluate their evidence together with the rest of the evidence in the trial, and \ndetermine which seems  more persuasive on"}

Suhana testified that there was no conversation between Mazlan and Kay Yong, and that the only thing she heard was Kay Yong saying to Mazlan, \u201cJust put inside here,\u201d in English. 31', 'She also did not see anything being exchanged between Mazlan and Kay Yong, because she was hunched forward and her head was down. 32', 'Mazlan\u2019s evidence was that Kay Yong did not say anything apart from \u201cMasukkan dalam beg\u201d, which in Malay means \u201cPut it in the bag\u201d. 33', 'Kay Yong\u2019s evidence was that he could not remember if he had said anything to the effect of \u201cJust put inside here\u201d. 34', 'Defence counsel for Kay Yong, Mr Low Cheong Yeow and Mr Loo Khee Sheng, took the position that Suhana and Mazlan\u2019s evidence was unreliable, and that Kay Yong never said \u201cjust put inside here\u201d either in English or in Malay. 35', '14\\u2003Whatever Kay Yong and Mazlan may have said to each other, it was not in dispute that some words were spoken after which Kay Yong opened the Black Bag. 36', 'Mazlan placed one of the packets of granular substance he had received from Mani in a reddish-orange plastic bag (\u201cthe Plastic Bag\u201d), 37', 'which he identified in court to be the item marked as Exhibit A1A, 38', 'and placed the Plastic Bag inside Kay Yong\u2019s Black Bag. 39', 'Kay Yong then handed Mazlan a stack of money, and walked away. 40', '15\\u2003A short while after Kay Yong and Mazlan had met at the rubbish collection area, SSI Tony saw Kay Yong walking away from the Car towards Blk 31 Bendemeer Road, while the Car drove off. Kay Yong then proceeded to the fourth floor of Blk 31 Bendemeer Road. When Kay Yong was near the \u2018lift lobby A\u2019 area on the fourth floor, SSI Tony, Senior Staff Sergeant Chew Thye Kwang @ Jordi (\u201cSSS Jordi\u201d), Staff Sergeant Norizan Binte Merabzul (\u201cSS Norizan\u201d) and Staff Sergeant Muhammad Helmi Bin Abdul Jalal (\u201cSS Helmi\u201d) moved in to arrest him. 41', 'SSS Jordi remained on the ground floor, while SSI Tony, SS Norizan and SS Helmi proceeded to the fourth floor. 42', 'The officers were in plain clothes. 43', 'When they reached the fourth floor, SSI Tony testified that they saw Kay Yong \u201cface to face\u201d. 44', 'It was undisputed that when Kay Yong noticed SSI Tony, SS Norizan and SS Helmi approaching him, he fled and ran in the opposite direction. 45', 'SSI Tony, SS Norizan and SS Helmi gave chase. 46', 'Kay Yong then ran down the staircase located near lift lobby C. When Kay Yong was at the landing immediately preceding the ground floor, he jumped from the landing, 47', 'landing on the ground floor in a fall which fractured his leg. 48', 'As Kay Yong fell, the Black Bag was released from his hand and landed a short distance away from him. 49', '16\\u2003SSI Tony, SSS Jordi, SS Helmi and SS Norizan arrested Kay Yong while he was prone on the ground. At about 7.25pm, SSS Jordi recovered the Black Bag. Inside the Black Bag was a reddish-orange plastic bag, Exhibit A1A, which contained one clear plastic packet, Exhibit A1A1, which contained one packet of grey granular substance, Exhibit A1A1A.', '17\\u2003The packet of grey granular substance, Exhibit A1A1A, forms the subject matter of both the charges against Kay Yong and Mazlan. It was eventually sent to the Health Sciences Authority (\u201cHSA\u201d). HSA Analyst Koh Hui Boon analysed the exhibit and found that the packet contained not less than 459.4g of granular substance, containing not less than 18.71g of diamorphine. 50', '18\\u2003After SSI Tony reported that the Car had moved off from the rubbish collection area near Blk 31 Bendemeer Road (see [15] above), another party of CNB STF officers boarded several CNB operational cars and trailed the Car.', '19\\u2003According to Mazlan, after he had left Blk 31 Bendemeer Road, and while he was in the Car, he received a call from Mani, who asked him whether he had counted the money he had received from Kay Yong. Mazlan answered that he had yet to count the money, in response to which Mani said that he would call Mazlan later. 51', '20\\u2003 Eventually, at about 7.30pm, the Car stopped in front of Mufiz Eating House along Kitchener Road. 52', 'After Mazlan, Suhana and Aida alighted from the car, they were arrested by CNB officers. The police report filed in respect of the arrests noted that when Mazlan was searched, a stack of money amounting to $3,000 which was tied with a rubber band was seized from the pocket of his jeans. 53', '21\\u2003Shortly after his arrest, the CNB officers escorted Kay Yong into a CNB operational car. Inside the car, SSI Tony recorded a contemporaneous statement from Kay Yong, who spoke in Mandarin. 54', 'SSI Tony recorded both the questions and answers in Mandarin which he also translated into English. 55', 'The material portions of Kay Yong\u2019s translated contemporaneous statements are as follows:', '22\\u2003At about 8.10pm, the CNB officers escorted Kay Yong to his mother\u2019s flat, where he was living at the time, at Blk 31 Bendemeer Road, #04-865 (\u201cthe Bendemeer Flat\u201d). 56', 'SSI Tony\u2019s evidence was that they searched the Bendemeer Flat for drug paraphernalia as well as items relating to gambling, since Kay Yong had mentioned gambling in his contemporaneous statement. 57', 'However, neither any drug paraphernalia nor any gambling-related items were found. 58', '23\\u2003At about 8.50pm, the CNB officers left the Bendemeer Flat with Kay Yong and proceeded to Blk 123 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6, #12-4023 (\u201cthe Ang Mo Kio Flat\u201d). According to SSI Tony, this was Kay Yong\u2019s \u201cofficial address\u201d, presumably referring to the address stated in his NRIC. SSI Tony and Kay Yong gave differing accounts of what transpired at the Ang Mo Kio Flat. SSI Tony\u2019s evidence was that Kay Yong had informed the CNB officers that he was no longer staying at this address. SSI Tony thus went to the Ang Mo Kio Flat in order to \u201cverify Kay Yong\u2019s claim\u201d 59', '. He knocked on the door several times and left as there was no response 60', '. SSI Tony\u2019s conditioned statement did not mention that Kay Yong had handed over the keys to the Ang Mo Kio Flat at any point and indeed, the tenor of SSI Tony\u2019s evidence was that he did not have those keys because if he had them he would not need to knock on the door. SSI Tony was not challenged on this version of the events when he gave evidence at the trial.', '24\\u2003Kay Yong\u2019s evidence was that he gave SSI Tony the keys to the Ang Mo Kio Flat, and that upon reaching Blk 123 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6, the CNB officers \u201cwent up to check [Kay Yong\u2019s] flat\u201d while he remained in the CNB operational car. Kay Yong claimed that when the CNB officers returned, they \u201csaid that nothing was found in [Kay Yong\u2019s] flat.\u201d 61', '25\\u2003After leaving the Ang Mo Kio Flat, the CNB officers escorted Kay Yong to the CNB office at Police Cantonment Complex, where SSI Tony lodged a police report concerning Kay Yong\u2019s arrest, and also procured a urine sample from Kay Yong. 62', 'Later that night, the CNB officers escorted Kay Yong to Changi General Hospital (\u201cCGH\u201d) to be examined by a doctor, as he had complained of pain in his leg. 63', 'Kay Yong was found to have suffered a fracture, and was admitted and warded until 27 July 2015. 64', '26\\u2003Apart from the contemporaneous statement recorded by SSI Tony on the day of his arrest, Kay Yong also provided the following statements to CNB:', '(a)\\u2003A cautioned statement recorded by the investigating officer, Woman Inspector Elizabeth Zachariah (\u201cIO Elizabeth\u201d) on 27 July 2015 pursuant to s 23 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (\u201cCPC\u201d). 65', '(b)\\u2003Three long statements recorded by IO Elizabeth between 27 July 2015 and 31 July 2015 pursuant to s 22 of the CPC. 66', '(c)\\u2003A fourth long statement recorded by Inspector Huang Yixia (\u201cIO Huang\u201d) on 3 March 2016 pursuant to s 22 of the CPC. 67', '27\\u2003In Kay Yong\u2019s cautioned statement, he stated the following: 68', '28\\u2003In Kay Yong\u2019s first long statement, he gave the following account: On the day of his arrest, he received a call from \u201cAh Boy\u201d at around noon. Ah Boy was a Malaysian man who had first contacted him over the phone about two years earlier. Ah Boy said that he was a friend of \u201cAh San\u201d, whom Kay Yong had met in prison five or six years earlier. Over those two years, Ah Boy had gotten Kay Yong involved in online gambling activities, including betting on horses and on football. Ah Boy and Ah San also recruited him to help them run their online betting activities by collecting bets from others in return for a commission. Kay Yong said that when Ah Boy called him at noon on the day of his arrest, he instructed Kay Yong to prepare $3,800, which was what he owed Ah Boy for bets placed during the 2014 World Cup. However, Kay Yong only managed to gather $3,600 from his own salary and by borrowing money from other people. At about 5pm, Kay Yong received a call from a Malay man (ie, Mazlan), and arranged to meet him at Blk 31 Bendemeer Road. When he met up with Mazlan, Kay Yong handed him the money and told him to pass it to Ah Boy. Kay Yong said that Mazlan then asked him to open his bag. He asked why, but Mazlan told him to \u201cjust open [his] bag\u201d. Mazlan then threw something inside the bag. Feeling that \u201csomething was wrong\u201d, Kay Yong quickly turned away and walked towards his block. While he was at his block, he had started running when he heard \u201crunning sounds\u201d because he \u201cfelt something wrong\u201d. 69', '29\\u2003It should be noted that it was in this first long statement that Kay Yong mentioned for the first time that he thought that the Malay guy \u201chad passed [him] either a debt book or \u2018pei hoon\u2019\u201d. 70', 'Pei hoon is a street name for heroin. When questioned about why he thought someone might have passed him heroin, Kay Yong stated the following:', '30\\u2003The pertinent aspect of Kay Yong\u2019s second long statement is that this is where he mentioned for the first time that he himself smoked pei hoon. Kay Yong stated that he had smoked pei hoon at about noon on the day of his arrest, and had been regularly smoking about two straws a day since May 2015. He would purchase a packet of pei hoon about once a week from different suppliers at Toa Payoh Lorong 5. Each packet of pei hoon weighed about 8g and cost him about $180. Kay Yong also said in this statement that he had \u201crelapsed\u201d into smoking pei hoon because of the pressure and stress he felt as a result of owing money to Ah Boy. He claimed he still owed Ah Boy $30,000 out of an original debt of $50,000 accumulated from horse and soccer betting, and from other people who had failed to pay him after placing bets. 71', '31\\u2003Kay Yong\u2019s third long statement elaborated on his interactions with Ah Boy. In particular, he claimed that after the 2014 World Cup ended, Ah Boy had repeatedly asked him to repay $58,000 which he owed for soccer bets. Kay Yong further asserted that, in response to these repeated requests, he had repaid Ah Boy as and when he was able to do so. 72', 'He said that he had never met Ah Boy personally. Rather, Ah Boy would call him two to three times a week to chase him for payment. If Kay Yong had some money, he would agree to pay. When this happened, on the following day, he would receive a call from a stranger, who would arrange to meet him at the void deck of Blk 31 Bendemeer Road to collect the money. Each time a different person would call him and meet him to collect the payment from him. After payment was made, Ah Boy would call him and acknowledge receipt of the payment. 73', '32\\u2003Kay Yong surmised that Ah Boy may have gotten Mazlan to send him drugs to push him into dealing in drugs because he had failed to make any debt repayment since the start of the year. 74', 'He further alleged that there had been six to seven occasions in which Ah Boy had previously sent people to knock on the door of the Bendemeer Flat at 3am in the morning. On one of these occasions, he had opened the door to find three strangers, one of whom handed him a mobile phone. Ah Boy was on the line and told Kay Yong \u201cnot to run away if not [Ah Boy] will burn [Kay Yong\u2019s] house down\u201d. 75', '33\\u2003In his third long statement, Kay Yong was asked what he would have done with the packet of drugs (Exhibit A1A1A) if he had not been caught by the CNB. He gave the following answer:', '34\\u2003The material aspects of Kay Yong\u2019s fourth long statement were as follows: Kay Yong stated \u201cthe Malay man\u201d (ie, Mazlan) had asked him to bring a bag, and had told him that Ah Boy had \u201csomething to give [him]\u201d. He alleged that he \u201cdid not know what the thing [was]\u201d, and thought that it was a debt book for online bets\u201d. He reiterated that he had run when he heard CNB officers approaching \u201cbecause [he] thought [he] was carrying a debt book which is also illegal\u201d. Again, he stated that he had thought that the \u201cthing\u201d Mazlan had passed him might be pei hoon because Ah Boy had previously offered him pei hoon and asked him to help him sell it. 77', '35\\u2003It was clear from Kay Yong\u2019s oral testimony that the statements which he gave to the CNB were recorded in a question and answer format. 78', 'As we shall see, Kay Yong has emphasised this point several times to explain why he did not mention certain facts which were key to his defence.', '36\\u2003For completeness, I note that Mazlan provided a contemporaneous statement, 79', 'a cautioned statement, 80', 'and six long statements to various CNB Officers. 81', 'However, for present purposes it was unnecessary to delve into the contents of these statements because, as I explain below, Mazlan did not challenge the Prosecution\u2019s version of events, nor did he challenge the position he had taken in the long statements which he provided to CNB. 82'"}

One of the first plaintiff\u2019s investments is a Singapore company called Enviro Investments Pte Ltd (\u201cEnviro\u201d). Chew is a Singaporean and is also an investor in Enviro. Enviro is a wholly-owned subsidiary of a Singapore-listed company called Enviro-Hub Holdings Ltd (\u201cEnviro-Hub\u201d). Enviro-Hub\u2019s business includes recycling of plastics, ferrous and non-ferrous metals, recovery and refining of platinum group metals as well as conversion of waste plastics to fuel. Ng Ah Hua (\u201cRaymond\u201d) is the executive chairman of Enviro-Hub and is also a substantial shareholder of the company.', '4\\u2003The defendant is a Malaysian citizen who (together with his wife Chong Siew Choo (\u201cChong\u201d)) holds 97% of the issued shares in a Malaysian company called Metahub Industries Sdn Bhd (\u201cMetahub\u201d). He is also Metahub\u2019s managing director. Metahub is in the business of recycling, waste management, tin refining and manufacturing.', '5\\u2003Around October 2014, the defendant\u2019s brother Ung Yoke Hooi (\u201cWilliam\u201d), who had known Raymond for about 30 years as a friend and business associate, contacted Raymond to tell him that the shareholders of Metahub were looking for a third party to acquire their entire 100% shareholdings in the company. 1', 'Enviro\u2019s shareholders (including the plaintiffs) commenced negotiations in or about November 2014 for the buy-out of all the shares in Metahub from its shareholders as they saw synergy in the recycling and waste management activities of the two companies. The key persons from Enviro who negotiated with the defendant on its intended purchase were Raymond and William. It was William who first introduced Raymond to the defendant some 20 years earlier.', '6\\u2003Negotiations on behalf of Metahub were conducted by the defendant and Kevin Chee Ho Chun (\u201cChee\u201d), who is a director and 1% shareholder of the company. There was a preliminary meeting between the parties on 18 November 2014 followed by two other meetings on 12 December 2014 and 14 January 2015. Negotiations between the parties continued until March 2015. Apparently Chee is legally trained as he drafted the initial sale and purchase agreement (\u201cSPA\u201d) for the parties as well as its numerous amended versions.', '7\\u2003It was contemplated that should Enviro acquire Metahub, the first plaintiff and Chew would each own 20% of Metahub\u2019s shares while William would hold 9% of the shares. In his affidavit of evidence-in-chief (\u201cAEIC\u201d) Raymond deposed that it was his condition that William must be involved in the acquisition if Enviro took over Metahub. 2', '8\\u2003The plaintiffs contended that from the outset, they had made it clear to the defendant and Chee that neither Enviro nor Enviro-Hub were in a position to pay any deposit or make an advance payment for the proposed acquisition unless certain conditions precedent were fulfilled by Metahub, including the completion of the due diligence process by the purchasers. 3', '9\\u2003The defendant however was adamant from the start of negotiations that either Enviro or Enviro-Hub must pay a deposit before he would allow a due diligence exercise to be carried out. Consequently, negotiations came to a deadlock and the impasse continued until December 2014.', '10\\u2003Raymond deposed that on or around 16 December 2014, he was on holiday in Barcelona, Spain when Chee telephoned him pressing him to agree to Chee\u2019s version of the draft SPA that had been emailed to Enviro on 12 December 2014, as well as to pay the initial deposit of RM5m stated in the draft. Raymond deposed he was so put off by Chee\u2019s telephone call that he told Chee he was calling off the proposed acquisition by Enviro. 4', 'The defendant subsequently telephoned Raymond to ask him to reconsider his decision to call off the acquisition. 5', '11\\u2003On Raymond\u2019s return to Singapore on or around 21 December 2014, William spoke to Raymond and apparently told him the defendant was facing cash-flow problems and that the defendant needed some short-term loans to tide him over. William added that if his brother\u2019s problem could be resolved, the defendant would allow Enviro or Enviro-Hub to carry out the due diligence process on Metahub.', '12\\u2003In the same month, Raymond arranged a meeting in Johor between the defendant, Sam Tan and Chew (who is a close friend of Raymond). In that meeting and at subsequent discussions, the plaintiffs claimed (but which the defendant denied) that the defendant confirmed his cash-flow problems and the fact that he needed a loan of RM5m which he represented that he would be able to repay in full after a few months.', '13\\u2003The plaintiffs eventually agreed to extend a loan of RM4m (\u201cthe loan\u201d) while William would separately extend a loan of RM1m, to the defendant. Raymond instructed solicitors to draft a loan agreement for the plaintiffs\u2019 loan of RM4m.', '14\\u2003The first draft of the loan document was prepared around 31 December 2014. The agreement itself was executed on or about 2 January 2015 (\u201cthe loan agreement\u201d) by the defendant at Legoland theme park in Johor Bahru in the presence of Raymond and William (who witnessed the defendant\u2019s signature).', '15\\u2003On or about 6 January 2015, Sam Tan and Chew signed the loan agreement in Singapore on behalf of the plaintiffs. Amongst the salient provisions in the loan agreement are the following: 6', '(a)\\u2003Clause 1.2 \u2013 the loan was to be repaid in full within two months or upon completion of the acquisition of shares in Metahub whichever was the earlier;', '(b)\\u2003Clause 1.3 \u2013 in the event the acquisition of shares was terminated, the loan would be repaid in full immediately; and', '(c)\\u2003Clause 2 \u2013 the defendant would charge 20% of the shares he held in Metahub to the plaintiffs as security for the loan.', '16\\u2003On 6 January 2015, Chew on behalf of himself and the first plaintiff remitted the loan to the defendant\u2019s Malaysian bank account via telegraphic transfer. The defendant executed transfer forms in blank to charge 20% of his shares in Metahub to the plaintiffs. The transfer documents are currently in the custody of the Chief Financial Officer of Enviro-Hub Ms Tan Lay Mai (\u201cMs Tan\u201d). Sam Tan subsequently forwarded a soft copy of the loan agreement to the defendant by email on 23 January 2015 at the defendant\u2019s request.', '17\\u2003According to the plaintiffs (but denied by William), Chew on behalf of William remitted RM1m to the defendant on or about 22 January 2015.', '18\\u2003The proposed acquisition of Metahub\u2019s shares was subsequently aborted on or around 26 March 2015, apparently due to Enviro\u2019s inability to procure the requisite financing from either Malaysian or Singapore banks. By an email dated 27 March 2015, Sam Tan demanded repayment of the loan from the defendant. 7', '19\\u2003The defendant refused to repay, contending that the loan was a non-refundable deposit for the intended acquisition of shares in Metahub and not a loan. He further ignored the letters of demand sent to him by the plaintiffs\u2019 and William\u2019s solicitors in April and May 2015 respectively. Instead, the defendant deposed in his second affidavit that the plaintiffs\u2019 solicitors had no authority from William to send him the second letter of demand dated 6 May 2015 (for RM1m) and his solicitors had written to the plaintiffs\u2019 solicitors on or about 16 September 2015 to demand an explanation. The defendant claimed he had checked with William and was told that the plaintiffs\u2019 solicitors had not been authorised to act for William.', '20\\u2003The defendant produced a statutory declaration from William dated 21 October 2015 wherein William declared that: (i) he had never provided Chew with money to be remitted to the defendant as a loan; (ii) that the defendant signed the loan agreement in his presence only as an acknowledgment of the requisite deposit under the SPA for the Metahub shares, as the SPA itself could only be signed after the due diligence exercise had been conducted and (iii) he was present at all the meetings between the parties and the subject of a loan to the defendant was never mentioned at all. 8', '21\\u2003The plaintiffs filed their writ of summons and statement of claim in this Suit on 19 June 2015 claiming repayment of the loan pursuant to cl 1.3 of the loan agreement (at [15] above) which they alleged the defendant had breached.', '22\\u2003As alluded to earlier in [2], the defendant unsuccessfully applied for a stay of proceedings in this Suit. When he failed in his application before this court and the Court of Appeal, he and his fellow shareholders in Metahub commenced proceedings in the Malaysian (Johor Bahru) High Court against the plaintiffs as well as against William, for their failure to complete their purchase despite the fact that the transaction was aborted and no SPA had been executed.'"}

The plaintiff argued inter alia that the relationship of mutual trust and confidence between himself and the defendant had broken down; and that he had been wrongfully excluded from participating in the management of the Tat Leong Companies: see the Judgment at [26(a)]\u2013[26(b)] and [72].', '4\\u2003On 13 April 2015, Steven Chong J (as he then was) (\u201cChong J\u201d) found that a relationship of mutual trust and confidence was central to the existence of the Tat Leong Companies, ie, they were quasi-partnerships; and the relationship of trust and confidence as between the parties had disintegrated (the Judgment at [75] and [77]). Chong J also found that the plaintiff had been deliberately excluded from the management of TLD and TLI, in breach of an understanding that he was to have a management role in both companies (the Judgment at [81]). At the time of the Judgment, a court did not have the power to order a buy-out of shares, in lieu of winding up the company, on an application under s 254(1)(i) of the Companies Act. Chong J accordingly ordered that the Tat Leong Companies be wound up, although he deferred the winding-up orders for 30 days to allow the parties to reach an amicable settlement in line with the approach taken by the Court of Appeal in Sim Yong Kim v Evenstar Investments Pte Ltd [2006] 3 SLR(R) 827. Chong J also ordered the defendant to pay costs fixed at $40,000 excluding disbursements to the plaintiff, with such costs and disbursements to be reflected solely against the value of the defendant\u2019s shares in the Tat Leong Companies (\u201cthe Costs Order\u201d).', '5\\u2003The parties were unable to settle the dispute within 30 days. The defendant appealed against Chong J\u2019s decision in Civil Appeals Nos 101, 102 and 103 of 2015 (\u201cthe Appeals\u201d). Pending the Appeals, the defendant applied for a stay of Chong J\u2019s orders. On 23 June 2015, Hoo Sheau Peng JC (as she then was) (\u201cHoo JC\u201d) granted a stay of Chong J\u2019s orders.', '6\\u2003On 23 November 2015, at the hearing of the Appeals, the Court of Appeal suggested that the parties attend mediation to resolve their differences.', '7\\u2003On 28 December 2015, the parties attended mediation and entered into the Settlement Agreement at the conclusion of the mediation.', '8\\u2003The Settlement Agreement provided for the defendant to purchase the plaintiff\u2019s shares in the Tat Leong Companies for a sum of money to be determined under the terms of the Settlement Agreement (\u201cthe Consideration\u201d). The following terms of the Settlement Agreement were material in this case.', '9\\u2003Clause 3 of the Settlement Agreement provided as follows:', '10\\u2003Clauses 4 to 8 provided for the calculation of the net tangible asset value (\u201cNTAV\u201d) of TLD and TLP. Notably, cl 5 provided as follows:', 'Clause 5 thus set out a formula for determining the NTAV of TLP which referred to the sale price of #03-11, Far East Plaza (\u201cthe Far East Plaza Unit\u201d). The Settlement Agreement therefore envisioned that TLP\u2019s NTAV, and hence, in turn, the total sum of the Consideration under cl 3, would only be determined once the Far East Plaza Unit had been sold. The difficulties in the sale of this property are the principal source of this dispute.', '11\\u2003Clause 9 provided for Colliers International Singapore (\u201cColliers\u201d) to be appointed as the agent for the sale of the Far East Plaza Unit.', '12\\u2003Clause 10 addressed the implementation of the Settlement Agreement. Clauses 10(b) and 10(c), which are of central importance in this case, stated:', '13\\u2003Under cl 11 of the Settlement Agreement, the plaintiff and his family were to move out of 27 Jalan Rimau, their home of 25 years, within one month after Colliers provided a valuation of 25 and 27 Jalan Rimau. 25 and 27 Jalan Rimau were family properties owned by TLD.', '14\\u2003Clause 12 stated that \u201c[the defendant] agrees and will procure that the [Tat Leong Companies] will not deal with their assets or take on any further liabilities save as in the ordinary course of business \u2026 [emphasis added]\u201d. It further provided that the defendant would procure his solicitors \u201cto hold the net sale proceeds of [the Far East Plaza Unit and 27 Jalan Rimau] as stakeholders until [the plaintiff] is paid his consideration in full\u2026\u201d.', '15\\u2003Clause 13 provided that the parties would not have claims against each other \u201cin relation to any matter arising from or connected to the subject matter of [the Appeals], save for any costs orders already made [emphasis added]\u201d.', '16\\u2003Clause 14 provided that the parties would refer \u201cany dispute arising from the implementation of [the Settlement Agreement]\u201d to the mediator who had conduct of the mediation on 28 December 2015 (\u201cthe Mediator\u201d).', '17\\u2003Between January and March 2016, the Far East Plaza Unit was marketed for sale in the open market. However, no offers were made for the Far East Plaza Unit during this period.', '18\\u2003On 30 March 2016, in accordance with cl 11 of the Settlement Agreement, the plaintiff and his family moved out of 27 Jalan Rimau.', '19\\u2003The parties subsequently agreed to auction the Far East Plaza Unit in April and May 2016 at a reserve price of $2.2m. This reserve price was based on an indicative valuation of the Far East Plaza Unit at $2.1\u2013$2.2m, which Colliers provided on 29 March 2016. Auctions were held on 20 April and 26 May 2016 but both were unsuccessful. No bid was made at the auctions for the Far East Plaza Unit at the opening price of $2.2m.', '20\\u2003By a letter dated 5 July 2016, the plaintiff made several proposals to the defendant. It should be noted that by this time, the six-month period for the completion of the sale of the Far East Plaza Unit stipulated in cl 10(b) of the Settlement Agreement had expired on 28 June 2016. The plaintiff proposed that Colliers be discharged as the agent for the sale of the Far East Plaza Unit and another firm appointed to perform an independent valuation of the property; and, in the alternative, that the NTAV of TLP be assessed based on Colliers\u2019 indicative valuation of the Far East Plaza Unit.', '21\\u2003By a letter dated 8 July 2016, the defendant\u2019s solicitors replied stating that the defendant did not agree to the plaintiff\u2019s proposals in his letter of 5 July 2016. The defendant counter-proposed that the parties auction the Far East Plaza Unit in July 2016 at the slightly reduced reserve price of $2.1m.', '22\\u2003By a letter dated 12 July 2016, the plaintiff\u2019s solicitors wrote to the Mediator stating that a dispute between the parties had arisen from the implementation of the Settlement Agreement; and, requested that the dispute be referred to the Mediator pursuant to cl 14 of the Settlement Agreement (see [16] above). A mediation session was fixed for 9 September 2016. However, this was cancelled on 7 September 2016 because the Mediator fell ill.', '23\\u2003By a letter dated 19 September 2016 from his solicitors, the plaintiff requested the defendant to pay him the sum of $1,104,072.05, in exchange for the plaintiff\u2019s shares in TLI. This figure was arrived at by applying the formula for calculating the NTAV of TLD set out in cll 4, 6, 7 and 8 of the Settlement Agreement, excluding one component of the formula (the value of two Chinese subsidiaries of TLD) that was disputed at the time. Notably, the plaintiff\u2019s request was made on the basis that the Consideration was severable into (1) the sum due under cl 3(a), for his shares in TLI and TLD and (2) the sum due under cl 3(b), for his shares in TLP (see [9] above).', '24\\u2003By a letter from his solicitors dated 22 September 2016, the defendant replied to the plaintiff\u2019s letter dated 19 September 2016 stating that he did not agree to the plaintiff\u2019s proposal therein. The defendant asserted that the Settlement Agreement did not provide for part-payment of the Consideration; and that the plaintiff\u2019s failure to reply to his proposal in the 8 July 2016 letter, to auction the Far East Plaza Unit at the reserve price of $2.1m, had held up the sale process and delayed the conclusion of the Settlement Agreement.', '25\\u2003By a letter dated 4 October 2016, the plaintiff\u2019s solicitors demanded that the defendant complete the transfer of the plaintiff\u2019s shares in TLD and TLI for the sum of $1,152,486.35. It was undisputed in this suit that this sum reflects 23.44% of TLD\u2019s NTAV as determined under the Settlement Agreement; and was to be paid for the plaintiff\u2019s shares in TLD and TLI under cl 3(a) of the Settlement Agreement (see [9] above), albeit the defendant\u2019s position was that the Settlement Agreement provided for payment of the Consideration as one lump sum and did not provide for part-payment of the same (see [39(a)] below). The letter also indicated that the plaintiff was agreeable to auctioning the Far East Plaza Unit at the reserve price of $2.1m, but only until 31 December 2016. If the property was not sold by then, the plaintiff proposed assessing the NTAV of TLP based on the reserve price of $2.1m.', '26\\u2003By a letter from his solicitors dated 6 October 2016, the defendant maintained that he was not obliged to make part-payment of the Consideration. He also stated that he would make the necessary arrangements for the Far East Plaza Unit to be auctioned at the reserve price of $2.1m. He did not agree to the use of the reserve price to determine the NTAV of TLP in the event that the further auctions of the Far East Plaza Unit were unsuccessful.', '27\\u2003On 17 October 2016, the plaintiff commenced this suit.', '28\\u2003On 27 October 2016, 24 November 2016 and 15 December 2016, the Far East Plaza Unit was auctioned at the reserve price of $2.1m. Again, no bids were made at any of the auctions for the property at the opening price of $2.1m.', '29\\u2003By a letter from his solicitors dated 10 January 2017, the plaintiff proposed lowering the reserve price for the Far East Plaza Unit at auction to $1.5m; and stated that he would be willing to consider a bid below $1.5m. The defendant rejected this proposal by a letter dated 11 January 2017 from his solicitors, proposing to retain the reserve price at $2.1m. The defendant reaffirmed his proposal to retain the reserve price at $2.1m after a further letter from the plaintiff\u2019s solicitors regarding the reserve price.', '30\\u2003On 19 January 2017, the Far East Plaza Unit was again auctioned at the reserve price of $2.1m; and yet again, no bid was made for the property.', '31\\u2003On 20 January 2017, an offer was made for the Far East Plaza Unit at the price of $1.1m (after an earlier offer on the same day at the price of $1m). This appeared to be the only offer the property had received.', '32\\u2003On 3 February 2017, Chong J heard an application by the plaintiff for partial summary judgment, viz, for an order that the defendant complete the disposal of the plaintiff\u2019s shares in TLD and TLI for the sum of $1,152,486.35 (see [25] above). Chong J dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s application.', '33\\u2003By a letter dated 15 February 2017, the plaintiff\u2019s solicitors wrote to Colliers requesting, inter alia, a fresh indicative valuation of the Far East Plaza Unit and a recommendation on a reserve price for the sale of the property at auction.', '34\\u2003By an email dated 16 February 2017, Colliers wrote to the defendant\u2019s solicitors stating that the indicative valuation of the Far East Plaza Unit was $2\u2013$2.2m, and recommended a reserve price of $1.6m. The defendant\u2019s solicitors forwarded this email to the plaintiff\u2019s solicitors on 23 February 2017. In the interim, by a letter dated 17 February 2017, the plaintiff\u2019s solicitors wrote to the defendant\u2019s solicitors asserting that the defendant was \u201cdeliberately stalling the sale of the property\u201d and stated that the plaintiff would inform Colliers to auction the Far East Plaza Unit at the reserve price of $1.1m. On the same day, the plaintiff purported to instruct Colliers by letter to auction the Far East Plaza Unit at the reserve price of $1.1m. However, the defendant objected to this and the property was placed for auction at the reserve price of $2.1m on 22 February 2017. Again, there was no bid at the opening price of $2.1m.', '35\\u2003On 27 April, 25 May, 21 June and 27 July 2017, the Far East Plaza Unit was again auctioned at the reserve price of $2.1m; and, once again, there was no opening bid for the property at any of these auctions at the opening price.

The inconsistencies in his testimony stood  in stark \ncontrast to the testimonies of the Prosecution\u2019s witnesses, which I \nfound to be objective and truthful.46 All the relevant procedures for \nthe taking of the  statements  were also complied  with.\n20 The Accused\u2019s claim that he was subject to assaults was \nunsupported by evidence of physical trauma,  such as bruising,  \nlacerations or abrasions as noted by Dr Wong Kia Boon  (\u201cDr \nWong\u201d). These were  signs that one would reasonably  expect to be \nmanifested if the Accused\u2019s allegations were true. Significantly, Dr \nWong\u2019s medical examinations revealed no signs of trauma  or \ndistress,47 and I found it hard to believe  that a person, who was \nallegedly assaulted  to the point of pus \u201coozing\u201d out of his ear,48 \nwould display no apparent sign of distress. \n21 I also disbelieved the Accused\u2019s  reasons for not reporting the \nalleged assaults to Dr Wong during  his medical examinations.

A statement  recorded  on 27 June 2014, \u201cP49\u201d,  mentioned \nthat he \u201cgot beaten up\u201d during the statement recording of P45 and \nP46 but this only surfaced  about eight months later.51\n22 Indeed, at some points within the trial-within-a-trial, the \nAccused\u2019s evidence  was falsified in the face of overwhelming \nobjective evidence. For instance, the Accused\u2019s allegation  that IO \nThermizi was at the medical examination conducted by Dr Wong \nwas flatly contradicted by the two escorting officers52 and IO \nThermizi himself.53 I also found the Accused\u2019s claims  of undergoing  \nonly one medical  examination similarly discredited, especially in the \nlight of the Prosecution\u2019s  witnesses\u2019  corroborated testimonies to the \ncontrary.54 Similarly, I could not accept the Accused\u2019s evidence that \nInspector Thina was present in the interview room for the \u201csinister \npurpose\u201d of extracting  a confession  (see [18(a)] above).

DSP Burhan \ntestified that Inspector  Thina was dismissed once DSP Burhan  was \ncomfortable with the Accused\u2019s competency  in English.56 \n23 Finally, the Accused did not confess to the offences when P45 \nand P46 were recorded, since the statements disclosed consensual \nsexual acts, and yet the officers accepted his statements. This flew \nin the face of the suggestion that Inspector Thina was present only \nto extract a confession.57\n24 For these reasons, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had \ndischarged its burden of proving the voluntariness  of P45 and P46 \nbeyond a reasonable  doubt and  admitted  them into evidence.\n55 Transcript, Day 9, p 34.\n56 Transcript, Day 9, pp 5\u20136, 12\u201313.\n57 Prosecution\u2019s Submissions on the Admissibility of Accused\u2019s \nStatements, para  27.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v BDA [2018] SGHC 72\n12Addressing Defence\u2019s arguments \n25 The Defence  raised numerous arguments  by compiling a \ncatalogue of doubts  in the Prosecution\u2019s  case, primarily  arguing  that \nthe lack of objective evidence raised  reasonable doubts in the \nCharges. Despite  the best efforts  of the Defence, I was convinced \nthat the Victim was telling the truth  and found her testimony  to be \nsufficiently corroborated  by the other evidence in the case. Below, I \ndeal with the Defence\u2019s strongest arguments that attempted to cast \nshadows of doubt on the Prosecution\u2019s case.\nDNA evidence\n26 The Defence argued that the lack of DNA  or seminal fluid \nfound on the Victim\u2019s bed sheet, pillowcases,  blouse and in her \nvagina, as well as the Accused\u2019s towel and shorts, contradicted  the \nVictim\u2019s account  and raised doubts as to whether there was any \nsexual intercourse  between them.58 The Defence also alleged  that \nthere were deficiencies in the investigations in relation to the \ncollection, submission  and analysis of relevant exhibits and samples \nwhich could have yielded DNA evidence.\n27 In my judgment, the true issue was whether any reasonable  \ndoubt had been raised  in the Prosecution\u2019s case on the totality  of the \nevidence it had put forward. The lack of DNA evidence was a red \nherring in this case. First, I noted that both the Accused and the \nVictim had showered  after the incident,59 thereby  reducing the \n58 Defence\u2019s  Closing Submissions (\u201cDCS\u201d), paras 70\u201396.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v BDA [2018] SGHC 72\n13possibility of DNA  being collected from them. Second,  this was not \na case where it was proved  that there was in fact a lack of DNA \nevidence, as much as it was a case where the non-collection (and \nnon-submission)60 and botched analysis61 of relevant exhibits  and \nsamples, which could  have yielded DNA evidence  had contributed \nin some way to such evidence appearing to be lacking. In any event, \nI noted that two areas of the Victim\u2019s blouse did test positive for the \npresence of potential semen stains.62 When  they were  tested for \nDNA, the Victim  was found to be the major contributor.63 A minor \ncontributor, whose  identity could  not be matched, was also \ndetected.64 As such,  I found that the state of the DNA evidence  did \nnot exonerate  the Accused.65 I therefore agreed  with the Prosecution \nthat this was at best a neutral factor66 in the particular circumstances \nof this case.  \nMedical evidence\n28 The Defence argued that the lack of physical injuries militated \nagainst a finding of sexual assaults. I acknowledged that there were \nno physical injuries.  However, I was not convinced that this was \nfatal to the Prosecution\u2019s case.

Indeed,  the Accused did \nnot report to Dr Yeo of having  \u201cincoordination or motor  problems \nafter his drinking session\u201d.83 Ironically, it was the Accused\u2019s  own \nadmission that he could hold his liquor very  well.84 \n77 Transcript, Day 3, pp 46, 56\u201357.\n78 Transcript, Day 6, p 3. \n79 Transcript, Day 6, p 49.\n80 Transcript, 14 March 2018, p 13.\n81 DCS, para  118. \n82 DCS, para  119.\n83 Transcript, Day 15, p 22. \n84 Transcript, Day 7, pp 69\u201370; see also Transcript, Day 15, pp 21\u2013\n22.\nVersion No 1: 27 Oct 2020 (22:40 hrs)\nPP v BDA [2018] SGHC 72\n1632 Second,  Dr Yeo\u2019s  diagnosis was based essentially on the \nAccused\u2019s self-reporting.85 Dr Yeo also testified that it was difficult \nto comment on whether a seasoned drinker would have any or some  \nof the features of acute alcohol intoxication,86 such as impaired \nmuscle coordination and balance. \n33 Third,  the Victim\u2019s evidence was that the Accused forced \nhimself on her even  though he was drunk.87 Last, the Accused was \nmuch younger and stronger than the Victim and I could not believe \nthat he was prevented  from committing  the offences because  of his \nalcohol consumption. \nLack of  corroboration by family members\n34 The Defence submitted  that the Victim\u2019s version of the events  \nwas not corroborated by the evidence  provided by the Victim\u2019s \nfamily members  given that the precise words in describing  the sexual  \noffences were not articulated and the key aspects of the sexual \noffences were not disclosed to them.88\n35 I found  that this was an exercise  by the Defence  in splitting \nhairs.

He purchased the Property intending to develop it for his matrimonial home.', '3\\u2003The defendant Sunho Construction Pte Ltd is a Singapore incorporated company that carried on the business of providing construction services.', '4\\u2003The facts of the dispute referred to arbitration were strongly contested by both sides. For present purposes, a broad account of the background facts to set the context for the issues raised by the plaintiff in OS 388 would suffice.', '5\\u2003By a contract dated 14 July 2006 (\u201cthe Contract\u201d), the plaintiff engaged the defendant as main contractor to build a house for the sum of $1,980,000. Under the Contract, GUZ Architects was appointed as the architect for the project (\u201cthe Architect\u201d) while Barton Associates Pte Ltd was appointed as the Quantity Surveyor (\u201cthe Quantity Surveyor\u201d). The Contract incorporated the Singapore Institute of Architects Articles and Conditions of Building Contract (\u201cthe SIA Conditions\u201d).', '6\\u2003As things turned out, there was substantial delay in the completion of the project. The scheduled completion date was 1 December 2007. By April 2008, the project had not been completed. In a bid to expedite the completion of the project, the plaintiff appointed Mr Chow Chee Meng (\u201cMr Chow\u201d) to help facilitate completion of the project. It would appear that Mr Chow assisted from June 2008 to August 2008.', '7\\u2003On 2 June 2008, the Architect issued a delay certificate under the Contract declaring that the defendant was in default for not having completed the works by the scheduled completion date.', '8\\u2003Subsequently, on 26 June 2008, the defendant submitted extension of time claims (\u201cEOT Claims\u201d) to the Architect amounting to 287 days. On 11 May 2009, the Architect allowed the EOT Claims in part to the extent of 60 days (see [11] below]. The EOT Claims that were allowed and the other EOT Claims were the subject of dispute in the arbitration. For present purposes, it suffices to note that the plaintiff was of the view that the defendant was in delay due to severe financial difficulties whereas the defendant contended that it had met with numerous delaying events that entitled it to extensions of time under the Contract.', '9\\u2003Mr Chow subsequently returned to the project in December 2008 upon the execution of a Memorandum of Understanding (\u201cMOU\u201d) between the parties. A copy of the MOU was placed before me and was of some relevance given that the remuneration of Mr Chow was another issue considered in the Award. It was relevant to note the MOU did not state that the defendant would pay Mr Chow any remuneration or bear any of his fees for his services. Instead, it merely set out the understanding between the parties that the role of Mr Chow (and his company Oneness Engineering Pte Ltd) was that of a facilitator to expedite the completion of the project. The MOU also delegated authority as regards certain aspects of the project to Oneness Engineering Pte Ltd.', '10\\u2003The Temporary Occupation Permit (\u201cTOP\u201d) for the project was obtained on 27 February 2009 and the completion certificate for the project was issued by the Architect on 31 March 2009.', '11\\u2003On 11 May 2009, on the basis of the EOT Claims that were submitted on 26 June 2008, the Architect revised his earlier delay certificate, certifying that the defendant was entitled to an extension of time of 60 days (\u201cthe Allowed EOT\u201d). The completion date for the project was revised to 16 February 2008. This date formed the basis for the plaintiff\u2019s computation of the liquidated damages that the defendant was liable to the plaintiff for under the Contract.', '12\\u2003On 17 May 2013, the Architect finalised the accounts and issued the final certificate in which he certified that a sum of $71,047.01 was due and payable to the defendant.', '13\\u2003On 3 February 2015, the defendant commenced arbitral proceedings against the plaintiff. This was pursuant to cl 37(1) of the Contract which incorporated the SIA Conditions. Clause 37(1) of the Contract provided as follows:', '14\\u2003On 18 March 2015, upon application by both the plaintiff and the defendant, the President of the Singapore Institute of Architects appointed an arbitrator to hear the matter (\u201cthe Arbitrator\u201d). The Arbitrator was a quantity surveyor by training and profession.', '15\\u2003The defendant claimed the sum of $500,598.18 in the arbitration. Amongst other things, the defendant claimed for a refund of liquidated damages wrongfully charged by the plaintiff to the defendant and set-off against the sums certified as due to the defendant. The defendant contended that it was entitled to an extension of time beyond the Allowed EOT, with the completion date consequently being adjusted to a later date and the quantum of liquidated damages payable by the defendant being correspondingly reduced. The defendant therefore argued that the excess liquidated damages which had been charged ought to be refunded.', '16\\u2003The plaintiff counterclaimed that the defendant had breached the Contract or, in the alternative, a duty of care owed to the plaintiff. The plaintiff claimed the sum of $1,770,631.91 which included, among other things, liquidated damages allegedly owing to him for delay in completion of the project and the cost of rectification of defects, such as those that related to the construction of the swimming pool. It should be noted that the plaintiff claimed liquidated damages for 409 days commencing from the day after the Contract completion date of 1 December 2007 until the completion date for the works under the Contract, which was 31 December 2009. The plaintiff contended that the defendant was not entitled to any of the EOT Claims, including the Allowed EOT (see above at [11]). In this regard, the plaintiff further contended that the defendant had failed to satisfy two conditions precedent before an EOT Claim might be allowed. These were contained in cll 23(1) and (2) of the Contract. They provided as follows:', '17\\u2003Before the Arbitrator, the plaintiff contended that cl 23(1) of the Contract provided for a condition precedent, ie, that the defendant had to take all reasonable steps to avoid such delay before making an EOT Claim in respect of the delaying event (\u201cthe First Condition Precedent\u201d). The plaintiff further contended that cl 23(2) of the Contract provided for a second condition precedent, ie, that the defendant had to notify the Architect of any delaying event within 28 days of its occurrence (\u201cthe Second Condition Precedent\u201d). The plaintiff submitted that the First Condition Precedent was not satisfied as the delay was caused by the defendant\u2019s own conduct and that the Second Condition Precedent was not satisfied as it had failed to give the requisite notice within 28 days.', '18\\u2003In the alternative, the plaintiff contended that the defendant had breached three implied terms (\u201cthe Implied Terms\u201d) of the Contract or had wrongfully repudiated the Contract by reason of the breach of the Implied Terms. The Implied Terms were:', '(a)\\u2003That the defendant possessed the necessary knowledge, skills, care, work force and financial ability to undertake the Contract and to complete the works under the Contract by 1 December 2007.', '(b)\\u2003That the materials supplied and workforce employed by the defendant would be of good workmanship and quality.', '(c)\\u2003That the defendant would cooperate with the plaintiff and the Architect at all times and not in any way hinder or prevent the carrying out of the contract works and its completion by the completion date of 1 December 2007.', '19\\u2003The arbitration was conducted over several tranches in 2016, and involved 28 days of hearing. Both the defendant\u2019s representative and the plaintiff testified, called witnesses and made submissions. The parties\u2019 positions were crystallised in comprehensive pleadings.', '20\\u2003On 15 February 2017, the Arbitrator issued the Award ordering the plaintiff to pay to the defendant $278,064.40 and interest. Specifically, the Arbitrator had made the following orders which were relevant to OS 388:', '(a)\\u2003The sum of $71,047.01 set out in the final certificate was to be paid to the defendant (see above at [12]).', '(b)\\u2003The defendant was entitled to 297 days of extension of time.

On the \ncontrary, I think that sending a written version of an oral advice is a common  \npractice and a good one. It does not follow that it had not followed  a previous  \noral advice;  but even  if the solicitor  did not render oral advice before the plaintiff  \nsigned the mortgage documents, there  was ample  time for the plaintiff  to take \nremedial action. That runs naturally  against  her argument that she had signed \nunder the undue influence  of her husband.  The two arguments are not \ncompatible.

This was reported in various local newspapers largely in the context of the transformation plans for Jurong East. 3', '8\\u2003The Proprietor opened the Mall under the Subject Mark on 27 December 2014 and subsequently engaged in extensive advertising of the Mall in the English, Malay and Chinese newspapers. The Mall features the Subject Mark in point-of-sale and other promotional materials prominently throughout the location, including on shopping bags and trolleys, ticket machines, retail loyalty scheme materials, as well as social media platforms such as Facebook.

As mentioned, Oasis was set up in June 2011. At around the same time, Petrotec started to deal in fuel oil. Sometime in 2011, Dennis Tan got in touch with Gary Chew to explore the possibility of Gulf doing business with Petrotec and Oasis. 18', '13\\u2003Eventually, Gulf and Petrotec entered into a contractual arrangement relating to the supply of fuel oil. The parties agreed that the arrangement lasted for slightly more than two years from August 2012 to around November 2014. 19', 'However, they disagreed as to the nature of the contractual arrangement. Petrotec claimed that the business arrangement between it and Gulf involved a sale and re-purchase as constituted or evidenced by a written contract between the parties. This written contract was titled \u201cPayment Net-Off Contract (Barging Agreement)\u201d (\u201cNet-Off Contract\u201d).', '14\\u2003Gulf did not dispute the existence of the Net-Off Contract or the fact that the parties had initially entered into that contract, but Gulf denied that it had ever been performed. 20', 'Gulf claimed that the Net-Off Contract had been superseded and dealings between the parties were instead based on an oral agreement providing for Petrotec to receive, transport, and deliver Gulf\u2019s fuel oil (without any attendant sale or re-purchase between Gulf and Petrotec). This oral arrangement was referred to at trial as the \u201cNew Business Model\u201d.', '15\\u2003I now set out the details of the two contractual arrangements at issue.', '16\\u2003It was undisputed that on 22 August 2012, Gulf and Petrotec entered into the Net-Off Contract which came into force on the same day for the period of one year. Gary Chew and Dennis Tan signed the Net-Off Contract on behalf of Gulf and Petrotec respectively. 21', '17\\u2003The terms of the Net-Off Contract provided for the sale, re-purchase, and delivery of bunker fuel oil. There were two main components. First, under cl 2(ii) of the Net-Off Contract, Gulf would sell fuel oil to Petrotec on an ex-wharf basis (under a \u201cSale Contract\u201d). The term \u201cex-wharf basis\u201d in this context meant that Petrotec would directly collect the fuel oil from Gulf\u2019s suppliers (\u201cthe Suppliers\u201d). Second, under cl 2(i) of the Net-Off Contract, Gulf would re-purchase fuel oil from Petrotec on a delivered basis (under a \u201cPurchase Contract\u201d). \u201cDelivered basis\u201d meant that it was Petrotec (and not Gulf) that would deliver the fuel oil to downstream buyers (\u201cthe Buyers\u201d). Accordingly, transactions under the Net-Off Contract involved the sale and re-purchase of fuel oil between Gulf and Petrotec. 22', '18\\u2003The Net-Off Contract also provided for a payment mechanism. Pursuant to cl 3.1 of the Net-Off Contract, a running account was maintained between Gulf and Petrotec based on the quantities and prices under the Purchase Contracts and Sale Contracts. At the end of each calendar month, the consolidated payment obligations accrued under the Sale Contracts for that month would be \u201cnet off\u201d against the consolidated payment obligations accrued under the Purchase Contracts for the same month. Under cl 3.2 of the Net-Off Contract, depending on which consolidated sum was greater, either Gulf or Petrotec would be entitled to invoice the other party for the difference.', '19\\u2003The Net-Off Contract itself did not provide all the terms of the business arrangement. Petrotec gave affidavit and oral evidence as to how business arrangements between the parties had in fact been conducted pursuant to the Net-Off Contract. According to Dennis Tan, the business arrangements proceeded as follows:', '(a)\\u2003Petrotec sourced for potential purchasers of fuel oil on a delivered basis. On request of Petrotec, the Buyers would send their orders to Gulf for confirmation. Thereafter, any contract for the purchase of fuel oil would be entered into directly between the Buyers and Gulf. Apparently, this process was called \u201csleeving\u201d, where orders from Petrotec\u2019s customers were \u201csleeved\u201d to Gulf. 23', '(b)\\u2003Gulf collated the Buyers\u2019 orders until a threshold quantity was reached. Thereafter, Gulf would email Petrotec for confirmation that Petrotec would deliver the orders using fuel oil which Gulf would provide.', '(c)\\u2003If Petrotec agreed to make the deliveries, Gulf would purchase the corresponding quantity of fuel oil from the Suppliers on an ex-wharf basis. Gulf would then issue a \u201cBarge Confirmation\u201d to Petrotec containing instructions to collect the fuel oil from the Suppliers. In response, Petrotec would email Gulf a \u201cBarge Loading Nomination\u201d nominating a barge for the collection.', '(d)\\u2003Barges nominated by Petrotec would then collect the fuel oil from the Suppliers at the terminals. Simultaneously, Gulf (which had purchased the said fuel oil from the Suppliers) would onsell the fuel oil to Petrotec pursuant to a Sale Contract. The sale price under the Sale Contract was the purchase price of the fuel oil between Gulf and the Suppliers with an additional uplift (\u201cthe Uplift Charges\u201d). The Uplift Charges were supposed to represent Gulf\u2019s profit in the business arrangement.', '(e)\\u2003Subsequently, Gulf would respond to the Buyers\u2019 orders and enter into contracts for the purchase of fuel oil directly with the Buyers. Invoices would be raised by Gulf to the Buyers for the fuel oil sold. 24', 'Apparently, Petrotec did not have copies of these invoices. 25', 'Gulf would then (i) forward to Petrotec the firm orders for the purchase of fuel oil that the Buyers had sent (\u201cFirm Orders\u201d); 26', 'and (ii) issue Barge Confirmations to Petrotec for the latter to carry out the deliveries. (Some of the Firm Orders annexed in Dennis Tan\u2019s affidavit of evidence-in-chief (\u201cAEIC\u201d) appear to have been addressed to Tankoil Marine Services Pte Ltd (\u201cTankoil\u201d) instead of Gulf or Petrotec, 27', 'but since neither party raised any issue or made submissions on it, I place no weight on this).', '(f)\\u2003According to Petrotec, these forwarded Firm Orders constituted offers by Gulf to purchase the stated quantity of fuel oil from Petrotec on a delivered basis. If Petrotec agreed to the sale of fuel oil to Gulf, two things would happen. First, Gulf would purchase from Petrotec the stated quantity of fuel oil on a delivered basis pursuant to a Purchase Contract. The purchase price would be the price at which Gulf had purchased the fuel oil from the Suppliers (\u201cthe Base Price\u201d). 28', 'Second, Petrotec would carry out physical deliveries of fuel oil to the Buyers in accordance with details set out in the Firm Orders. Petrotec claimed that it did not usually object to sale of fuel oil to Gulf pursuant to the Firm Orders, since the Buyers were usually customers sourced by Petrotec itself for Gulf. 29', '20\\u2003As mentioned (at [18] above), there was a \u201cnet off\u201d process envisaged under the Net-Off Contract. Pursuant to the arrangement, Gulf would send Petrotec a monthly debit note setting out the monthly consolidated accounts and appending a spreadsheet demonstrating the numbers and calculations that constituted the \u201cnet off\u201d process. 30', 'The process used a \u201csystem minus\u201d, which referred to the difference between the price of the Firm Order (ie, the price that Gulf receives from the Buyers for the fuel oil) and the Base Price (ie, Gulf\u2019s purchase price for the fuel oil from the Suppliers, which does not include the Uplift Charges). This \u201csystem minus\u201d was reflected in a special column of the spreadsheet attached to Gulf\u2019s monthly debit notes to Petrotec. Multiplying the \u201csystem minus\u201d by the quantity of fuel oil sold under the Firm Order, a \u201csystem minus value\u201d would be derived. Conceptually, this \u201csystem minus value\u201d appears to refer to the quantum of profit or loss that Gulf would have made if Gulf had purchased the relevant quantity of fuel oil at the Base Price from the Suppliers, and sold the same to the Buyers at the price of the Firm Order, without the involvement of Petrotec. The net amount of \u201csystem minus value\u201d across the entire month\u2019s consolidation of Firm Orders would give Gulf\u2019s total monthly profit or loss from the resale of fuel oil (\u201cthe Purchase Margin\u201d). If there was a profit (which would be achieved when, given a particular quantity of fuel oil ordered under a Firm Order, the price of the Firm Order exceeded the Base Price), credit would be given by Gulf to Petrotec; if there was a loss (when the price of the Firm Order was lower than that of the Base Price), Petrotec would bear the loss. 31', '21\\u2003There were also various types of charges which Petrotec agreed that it had to pay Gulf under this contractual arrangement, even though the terms of the Net-Off Contract did not expressly mention them:', '(a)\\u2003First, Petrotec agreed that it had to pay Gulf the Uplift Charges of US$3.00 per metric tonne (\u201cMT\u201d) of fuel oil. However, there was a dispute regarding some of the Uplift Charges imposed at the commencement of the parties\u2019 contractual arrangement, as those charges were imposed and paid at rates of more than US$3.00 per MT. I will elaborate on this later.', '(b)\\u2003Second, any charges imposed by the Suppliers against Gulf for mooring and pilotage during the bunker loading operations would be charged by Gulf to Petrotec on a back to back basis. 32', 'Similarly, any claim made by the Buyers against Gulf for demurrage and\/or delays would also be charged by Gulf to Petrotec on a back to back basis. 33', 'These charges are hereinafter collectively referred to as the \u201cBack to Back Charges\u201d.', '22\\u2003In addition, Gulf also imposed other charges which Petrotec disputes even though it paid them in the past. Indeed, some of the paid charges are the subject of Petrotec\u2019s counterclaim. I will elaborate on these later.', '23\\u2003According to Gulf, after the Net-Off Contract was entered into but before it was performed, Gulf and Petrotec orally entered into the New Business Model. This New Business Model was a separate contract which governed the parties\u2019 relationship vis-\u00e0-vis the supply of fuel oil. The Net-Off Contract was never performed and thus \u201cfell away\u201d. 34', '24\\u2003Gulf explained that the New Business Model was orally requested by Gulf, and orally agreed to by Petrotec. 35', 'This new arrangement was necessary because the Net-Off Contract provided a credit period of up to 30 days for Petrotec to make payment for its purchases of fuel oil from Gulf. At the time it entered into the Net-Off Contract, Gulf had intended to obtain credit insurance to protect itself from, inter alia, any potential default by Petrotec. However, after the contract was signed, Gulf was unable to obtain the credit insurance. Thus, Gulf \u201cwas not prepared\u201d to proceed with the Net-Off Contract and orally requested for the New Business Model, which Petrotec allegedly agreed to. 36', '25\\u2003According to Gulf, the flow of business under the New Business Model was as follows: 37', '(a)\\u2003Petrotec arranged and negotiated the sale of fuel oil with the Buyers on behalf of Gulf.', '(b)\\u2003Once the sale price and quantity were agreed upon, the Buyers would send \u201cConfirmations of Nomination\u201d directly to Gulf. Gulf would in turn send \u201cSales Confirmations\u201d, which included the terms and conditions of sale, to the Buyers.', '(c)\\u2003Gulf then purchased the fuel oil from the Suppliers on an ex-wharf basis, and appointed Petrotec to receive, hold, and transport the fuel oil to the Buyers by way of a \u201cBarge Confirmation Purchase Side\u201d.', '(d)\\u2003Once Gulf\u2019s fuel oil was loaded onto Petrotec\u2019s nominated barge, the Suppliers would invoice Gulf for Gulf\u2019s purchase of the fuel oil. Gulf would then send to Petrotec a \u201cBarge Confirmation Sales Side\u201d in respect of Gulf\u2019s sale of fuel oil to the relevant Buyer.', '(e)\\u2003Pursuant to the Barge Confirmation Sales Side, Petrotec would transport and deliver fuel oil to the Buyers. This delivery was evidenced by bunker debit notes. Gulf would then invoice the Buyers directly for Gulf\u2019s sale of fuel oil to them.', '26\\u2003In essence, under the New Business Model, Gulf remained the owner of the relevant fuel oil vis-\u00e0-vis Petrotec and at no time sold fuel oil to, or purchased fuel oil from, Petrotec. 38', 'Petrotec was appointed only to receive, hold, transport, and deliver Gulf\u2019s fuel oil on Gulf\u2019s behalf. Petrotec would not be involved in the receipt or payment of any invoices between Gulf and the Suppliers, 39', 'or between Gulf and the Buyers. 40', '27\\u2003The risk-profit apportionment between Gulf and Petrotec mentioned above in relation to the Net-Off Contract (see [20] above), however, appeared to remain largely similar under the New Business Model. This was because even under the New Business Model, debit notes would be sent by Gulf to Petrotec on a monthly basis at the start of each calendar month, indicating the net sum due from Petrotec to Gulf in the preceding month. One aspect of these debit notes was the \u201csystem minus\u201d as described above in relation to the Net-Off Contract (see [20] above). However, under the New Business Model, this \u201csystem minus\u201d was said to represent a purely financial arrangement rather than a sale and re-purchase arrangement. 41', 'Using the price of the Firm Order and the Base Price, 42', 'Gulf would calculate the net profit or loss from the sale of fuel oil by Gulf to the Buyers (without intermediate sales and re-purchases from Petrotec). If the price of the Firm Order exceeded the sum of the Base Price and other relevant charges, Gulf would credit the surplus to Petrotec; if the converse, Petrotec would pay Gulf the deficit. 43', '28\\u2003As mentioned, the business relationship between Gulf and Petrotec lasted for slightly more than two years from August 2012 to November 2014. 44', 'The parties agreed that the first time a barge nominated by Petrotec was loaded with fuel oil purchased by Gulf from the Suppliers was on 24 August 2012.', '29\\u2003During the term of their business relationship, Gulf sent at least three types of debit notes to Petrotec, two of which were implicated in the present proceedings.', '30\\u2003The first type of debit notes recorded the net monthly payments that should be made by Petrotec to Gulf (\u201cthe Barge Settlement DNs\u201d). At the start of each month (save for August 2012 to December 2012 where Gulf issued one consolidated debit note in January 2013 for these months), Gulf issued a debit note to Petrotec indicating the net sum due from Petrotec to Gulf in the preceding month which comprised the following four components: 45', '(a)\\u2003the Purchase Margin, which represented the net profit or loss from the sale of the fuel oil to the Buyers; 46', '(b)\\u2003the Uplift Charges, being US$3.00 per MT of fuel oil (the permissible rate is disputed) purchased from Gulf\u2019s Suppliers \u2013 Gulf charged this to Petrotec as Gulf\u2019s \u201coperational costs of doing this business\u201d; 47', '(c)\\u2003interests at the rate of 6% per annum that Gulf charged Petrotec on the Base Price from the date Gulf paid the Suppliers for the fuel oil to the date Gulf received payment for the same from the Buyers (\u201cthe Finance Charges\u201d); 48', 'and', '(d)\\u2003late payment interests that Gulf charged Petrotec at a rate of 2% per month from the first day of the month in which Gulf issued the debit note to the date payment was made by Petrotec (\u201cthe Late Payment Interests\u201d). 49', '31\\u2003The second type of debit notes was issued by Gulf to Petrotec for the Back to Back Charges (see [21(b)] above). 50', '32\\u2003A third type of debit notes was for the \u201cCancellation Charges\u201d, which refer to the difference between the price of the Firm Orders and the purchase price that the Buyers eventually had to pay (which was usually higher) for fuel oil from an alternative source if their purchase from Gulf was cancelled. Apparently, the Buyers would bill the Cancellation Charges to Gulf, which would in turn raise a debit note to Petrotec on a back to back basis. 51', '33\\u2003According to Dennis Tan, he received a phone call from Gary Chew in 2012. Gary Chew told Dennis Tan that Gulf wanted Dennis Tan and his two partners in Oasis, Aroy Tan and Steven Soon, to sign a document in order to kick-start the business with Gulf. 52', 'Gary Chew also allegedly told Dennis Tan that he did not have to worry about anything, and that Gary Chew would take care of them like how he took care of another bunker supplier who had engaged in a similar business with Gulf. 53', '34\\u2003After receiving Gary Chew\u2019s call, Dennis Tan called Steven Soon to come down to the office. That evening, Gary Chew arrived at Dennis Tan\u2019s office and obtained Steven Soon\u2019s and Dennis Tan\u2019s signatures on the document. 54', 'Dennis Tan then dispatched the document to Aroy Tan, who signed it and returned the document to Gulf. 55', '35\\u2003That document turned out to be a personal guarantee (\u201cthe Guarantee\u201d), the validity and enforceability of which is in dispute.

DOT had business relations with Tankoil, a company which had some connection with Petrotec and Dennis Tan. Investigations and claims against DOT and Tankoil led to disruptions in Petrotec\u2019s performance of its delivery and payment obligations with Gulf. 58', '37\\u2003As at the time Gulf stopped doing business with Petrotec, there were seven outstanding debit notes with the outstanding sum under them being US$3,937,105.33. 59', 'Petrotec had made part payment of US$580,205.25 for one of the outstanding debit notes as of 8 November 2014. 60', '38\\u2003On or around 8 November 2014, Dennis Tan sent a text message to Goel requesting for financial assistance to pay the debt.

In any event, neither Petrotec nor the Guarantors complied with the letters of demand. 67', '41\\u2003On 11 November and 1 December 2014, Gulf issued a debit note for the Back to Back Charges and the above-mentioned Barge Settlement DN for November 2014 (see [40] above) respectively.

The Subsidiaries each own one unit in Newton Imperial, a condominium development in Singapore. I shall refer to the 22 units in Newton Imperial as \u201cthe 22 Units\u201d. The 22 Units are rented out. The rents are collected by Messrs Haridass Ho & Partners, a Singapore law firm, under an escrow agreement.', '3\\u2003On 8 July 2014, Ms Pooja Darsan Jhaveri (\u201cPooja\u201d), Darsan\u2019s daughter, executed a memorandum (\u201cthe Memorandum\u201d) in her capacity as the sole director of MDWL. At the material time, Pooja was the sole shareholder of MDWL as she held the single share in MDWL (\u201cthe Share\u201d). The Memorandum provided for Pooja (as transferor) to transfer the Share to Salgaocar (as transferee), for the consideration of US$1. It would appear that the Memorandum itself effected the transfer and the Share was therefore transferred to Salgaocar on 8 July 2014. The transfer was registered with MDWL\u2019s register of members.', '4\\u2003On 2 July 2015, Salgaocar lodged caveats against several properties in Singapore: six units in Newton Imperial (the same condominium development referred to above at [2]), 11 units in Waterford Residence, a condominium development, and 12 units in WCEGA Tower, a commercial property development. The Newton Imperial units are registered in the names of Darsan and his wife while the Waterford Residence and the WCEGA Tower units are registered in the names of three companies that Darsan controls. On 5 August and 12 October 2015, the registered proprietors of these properties filed Originating Summons No 727 of 2015 (\u201cOS 727\u201d) and Originating Summons No 945 of 2015 (\u201cOS 945\u201d) respectively, seeking orders for the removal of the caveats. I allowed OS 727 and OS 945 on 16 October 2017 and the defendants in those applications have appealed against my decision. For the avoidance of doubt, the properties that formed the subject matter of OS 727 and OS 945 do not include any of the 22 Units.', '5\\u2003On 11 August 2015, Salgaocar commenced Suit No 821 of 2015 (\u201cSuit 821\u201d) against Darsan in Singapore. In Suit 821, Salgaocar sought, inter alia, a declaration that Darsan held assets, including the six units in Newton Imperial that are registered in the names of Darsan and his wife, on trust for him and an order that Darsan convey the assets to him. The basis of Suit 821 is Salgaocar\u2019s claim that the parties entered into an oral agreement in Hong Kong in 2003 (\u201cthe 2003 Agreement\u201d) for Darsan to hold shares in various special purpose vehicles to be incorporated, including companies in the BVI, on trust for him. These companies in turn owned the assets that Salgaocar laid claim to in Suit 821. Salgaocar alleged that Darsan had breached the 2003 Agreement by transferring various assets, including the properties that were the subject matter of OS 727 and OS 945, to himself or entities controlled by him. On 28 December 2015, Darsan applied to strike out Suit 821.', '6\\u2003It is crucial to note that the assets claimed by Salgaocar in Suit 821 included neither the Share nor the 22 Units. In fact, Salgaocar\u2019s allegation in Suit 821 was that Pooja held the Share as nominee of Darsan and had transferred it to Salgaocar as a \u201cpart-settlement\u201d of the alleged breach of trust by Darsan. Seen from this perspective, it would make no sense for Salgaocar to have also claimed for the Share and\/or the 22 Units in Suit 821 since, on his own case, he was already the legal and beneficial owner of the Share and the ultimate indirect owner, through MDWL and the Subsidiaries, of the 22 Units.', '7\\u2003On 20 March 2017, Darsan\u2019s BVI solicitors filed a stop notice in relation to the Share to prevent registration of any transfer of the Share without Darsan\u2019s solicitors being given notice of such transfer.', '8\\u2003On 16 May 2017, Darsan commenced BVI 83. In BVI 83, Darsan claims that he is the sole beneficial owner of the Share for the following reasons:', '(a)\\u2003In April 2014, each Subsidiary purchased one unit in Newton Imperial. According to Darsan, he funded these purchases by extending an interest-free loan to MDWL (\u201cthe Loan\u201d) which was recorded in MDWL\u2019s accounts as a shareholder\u2019s loan in Pooja\u2019s name.', '(b)\\u2003Pooja held the Share in MDWL as Darsan\u2019s nominee.', '(c)\\u2003In June 2014, an oral agreement was reached between Darsan and Salgaocar (\u201cthe 2014 Agreement\u201d) over the telephone while Darsan was in Hong Kong and Salgaocar was in India. The parties agreed that Salgaocar would pay Darsan an amount equal to the outstanding balance of the Loan after deducting certain sums. On payment of this sum, the beneficial interest in the Share would pass from Darsan to Salgaocar.', '(d)\\u2003On 1 January 2016, Salgaocar passed away before paying Darsan what was due to him under the 2014 Agreement.', 'Accordingly, Darsan avers in BVI 83 that he remains the sole beneficial owner of the Share. He seeks a declaration to that effect, and an order that he be entered as the sole registered shareholder in MDWL\u2019s register of members. It is apparent therefore that the core issue in BVI 83 is whether there was in fact the 2014 Agreement.', '9\\u2003On 7 June 2017, Lakshmi filed OS 627 (see above at [1]). On 12 June 2017, Lakshmi filed Summons No 2674 of 2017 (\u201cSummons 2674\u201d) for an interim anti-suit injunction to restrain Darsan from continuing proceedings in BVI 83 pending the determination of OS 627. On the same day, Lakshmi appeared before the Duty Registrar and sought an urgent hearing date on an ex parte basis for her application in Summons 2674.', '10\\u2003Subsequently, the hearing for Summons 2674 was fixed before Kan Ting Chiu SJ on 13 June 2017. Counsel for Darsan, Mr Ramesh Kumar, appeared at the hearing. Mr Kumar requested for the matter to be heard on an inter partes basis and confirmed that he had instructions to accept service while reserving Darsan\u2019s right to challenge the jurisdiction of the court to hear the application. After hearing the parties, Kan SJ directed that the application proceed on an inter partes basis.', '11\\u2003At a pre-trial conference (\u201cPTC\u201d) on 29 June 2017, the Assistant Registrar fixed OS 627 and Summons 2674 to be heard together, given that OS 627 would dispose of Summons 2674.

{"casename":"2018_SGHC_93","fact":"'4\\u2003As stated, the related collisions involved first the Stena Provence and the Tian E Zuo, and second the Stena Provence and the Arctic Bridge. Prior to the related collisions, there was an earlier collision that involved the Tian E Zuo, the Marine Liberty and the DL Navig8. This earlier collision is not placed before this court as an issue for determination in the present case. The Marine Liberty is a bunker barge that was supplying bunkers to the Tian E Zuo at the material time. The Marine Liberty was still securely moored to the Tian E Zuo when the latter\u2019s anchor dragged in the prevailing squall. The two vessels drifted into close proximity with the DL Navig8, an oil tanker with a gross tonnage of 30,964 tonnes, breadth of 32.23 metres and an overall length of 189 metres. At 0308 hours the Marine Liberty collided with the DL Navig8. Subsequently, at about 0314 hours, the Tian E Zuo collided with the DL Navig8. As a result, these three vessels became hampered by the presence of each other in a way that prevented them from unilaterally manoeuvring to clear and break free. This predicament was the state of affairs that existed from 0330 hours until sometime between 0402 and 0406 hours. The Marine Liberty was freed at about 0402 hours. It is not clear precisely when the DL Navig8 could safely move away from the Tian E Zuo. It could have been any time from 0402 hours to 0406 hours.', '5\\u2003The Arctic Bridge is a Korean built chemical\/oil tanker, constructed in 2005. She has a gross tonnage of 30,053 tonnes, a breadth of 32.2 metres, and an overall length of 183 metres. She is also equipped with a bow thruster of power 950 kW. She was partly loaded with 19,543 tonnes of gasoline at the material time. Two members of her crew testified at the trial. They are: the master of the Arctic Bridge, Captain Erik Khuzhin (\u201cCaptain Khuzhin\u201d), and the chief officer, Alexander Ignatyuk.', '6\\u2003The Tian E Zuo is a newer and larger Chinese built chemical\/oil tanker.

The movement of vessels in the anchorage falls under the oversight of West Control of the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (\u201cWest Control\u201d). It is not disputed that the anchorage was congested at the material time. The Tian E Zuo was anchored by a single port anchor, six shackles deep. She had a north-westerly heading. The Marine Liberty was made fast to her starboard side. To the north of the Tian E Zuo was the anchored vessel, the Kingfisher, to the east was the DL Navig8 and slightly further out north-east was the Arctic Bridge.', '8\\u2003The plot in Annex 1 depicts the relative locations of the six vessels (including the Kingfisher and the Stena Provence) on 12 June 2014 at 0239 hours. 1', 'This plot was produced by the defendant\u2019s expert, Mr Hakirat Singh s\/o Harnek Singh (\u201cMr Singh\u201d), using Automatic Identification System (\u201cAIS\u201d) data. For context, an AIS is a device that transmits information regarding a ship\u2019s position to a network to allow maritime authorities to track and monitor vessel movements. I have also included other plots (also from Mr Singh\u2019s report) illustrating the position of the vessels at different time periods in this judgment as a graphical reference. These other plots were drawn up with information from the Voyage Data Recorders on board the Arctic Bridge, the Tian E Zuo and the Stena Provence. 2', 'These Voyage Data Recorders store, in a secure and retrievable form, information regarding the movement and control of a ship over the period leading up to and following an incident (\u201cVDR\u201d). While these plots are useful, I am mindful of what I have said in The \u201cDream Star\u201d [2018] 4 SLR 473 at [13] (\u201cThe Dream Star\u201d); that they show what might have happened, not what did happen. The same comments equally apply to the defendant\u2019s video which is supposedly a video replay compilation using extracted VDR data from the VDRs of the Arctic Bridge and the Tian E Zuo. I will elaborate on this video below.', '9\\u2003At 0245 hours, in the light of a developing squall, West Control broadcasted a warning to all ships announcing that \u201cthe area [was] experiencing strong winds [, and advised] all vessels \u2026 to keep a good anchor watch\u201d. 3', 'Both experts agreed that the sea was slight to rough after the onset of the squall.', '10\\u2003According to the defendant\u2019s Preliminary Act, the squall lasted from 0245 hours to 0320 hours. While there was a squall, visibility was moderate. Those on board the Arctic Bridge and the Tian E Zuo were able to visually see each other for the most part of the entire incident. While Captain Khuzhin claimed that visibility was reduced to a mile, he could nonetheless visually observe that the stern of the Tian E Zuo had collided with the bow of the DL Navig8 and that both vessels were dragging astern together. He also was able to see that at about 0330 hours, the Tian E Zuo had stopped dragging astern with the DL Navig8 but the Tian E Zuo\u2019s bow started to turn starboard towards the Arctic Bridge. Captain Khuzhin estimated the distance between his vessel and the Tian E Zuo to be about 70 metres. However, Mr Singh has calculated the distance to be 95 metres based on VDR data.', '11\\u2003Both experts agreed that the tidal steam direction was towards 119\u00b0 true with a rate ranging 1.25 knots to 1.62 knots between 0245 hours and 0430 hours. While there was initially some dispute over the prevailing wind direction at the material time, I have accepted the prevailing wind direction to be, generally, westerly to south-westerly after 0246 hours. This was the direction stated by the experts in their joint statement.', '12\\u2003As stated, the Tian E Zuo dragged her anchor in the early morning of 12 June 2014 during a squall. The plaintiffs\u2019 expert witness, Captain Jonathan Mark Walker (\u201cCaptain Walker\u201d) in his supplemental report depicted Captain Khuzhin taking navigational decisions \u201cin a situation where it was dark, heavy rain, strong winds and in a very congested anchorage with another vessel nearby dragging its anchor and colliding\u201d. 4', 'He appeared to suggest that these same conditions prevailed even at 0337 hours, after the squall ended. Captain Walker\u2019s description of the conditions, however, is inconsistent with the other evidence before the court. In his earlier report, Captain Walker said that the winds had abated to a fresh breeze at 0337 hours. Further, the plaintiffs\u2019 Preliminary Act records the visibility as moderate and Captain Khuzhin himself said that he could observe other vessels a mile out prior to 0337 hours.', '13\\u2003The Tian E Zuo started to drag her port anchor at about 0247 hours. Along with the Marine Liberty secured by mooring lines to her starboard side, the Tian E Zuo moved astern in the direction of the DL Navig8. At about 0300 hours, the Tian E Zuo\u2019s engines were set at dead slow ahead followed by slow ahead in an attempt to stop her astern movement. However, at about 0308 hours, the Marine Liberty collided into the DL Navig8 and thereafter, at about 0314 hours, the Tian E Zuo contacted the DL Navig8. The Tian E Zuo\u2019s engines stopped around the time of her contact with the DL Navig8. From the communication between the respective vessels and West Control, it is apparent that the three vessels could not unilaterally move apart \u2013 their respective mooring line(s) and anchor chain(s) had either become entangled or could become entangled as the vessels were too close to each other. The Tian E Zuo\u2019s stern on the starboard quarter was close to the DL Navig8\u2019s bow. The Tian E Zuo could not use her engines to move away for fear of entanglement as her propeller was too close to the anchor chain of the DL Navig8.', '14\\u2003As the Tian E Zuo, together with the Marine Liberty and the DL Navig8, continued to drift across the anchorage, the Tian E Zuo, at about 0320 hours, dropped her starboard anchor. However, despite both anchors being in the water, the three vessels continued to drift together towards the Arctic Bridge. At 0330 hours, the drifting ceased and the three vessels came to a stop.', '15\\u2003The Arctic Bridge had already noticed these three vessels drawing near and was making preparations to move away. At 0317 hours to 0320 hours, Captain Khuzhin ordered the chief officer to get the engines ready. At 0325 hours, the order to heave the Arctic Bridge\u2019s port anchor was given and the order was carried out at 0329 hours. Eventually, this activity at the port anchor was abandoned as it was not possible to recover the remainder of the anchor chain in sufficient time and approximately three shackles of anchor cable remained in the water. At 0329 hours, her engines were ready. According to Captain Walker, just after 0331 hours, the engines were set to dead slow ahead. By 0333 hours, the Arctic Bridge was said to be \u201cmoving clear\u201d of the Tian E Zuo. 5', 'During the conversation with West Control (starting at 0334 hours), the Arctic Bridge confirmed to West Control that she would be able to shift north-west to another location to anchor.', '16\\u2003It is useful to set out the Very High Frequency (\u201cVHF\u201d) conversation between West Control and the Arctic Bridge: 6', '17\\u2003The Arctic Bridge was to pass north of an anchored vessel, the Kingfisher and proceed north-west. However, the Arctic Bridge was not able to do so and moved instead towards the Kingfisher. In order to avoid a collision with the Kingfisher, Captain Khuzhin said that at about 0337 hours, he ordered slow ahead on the engines and hard to port on the helm. According to the plaintiffs, as the Arctic Bridge turned to port, her bow went through the wind and the tidal stream. With her movement somewhat hampered by the action of the dredging port anchor, the Arctic Bridge was set towards the Tian E Zuo in a south-easterly direction, astern. In going astern, the Arctic Bridge crossed the bow of the Tian E Zuo at about 0343 hours. Subsequently, at about 0346 hours, the Arctic Bridge\u2019s engines were put to slow ahead. Moving ahead, she passed the bow of the Tian E Zuo a second time. At about 0349 hours, the Arctic Bridge cleared the bow of the Tian E Zuo. According to the plaintiffs, the Arctic Bridge\u2019s intention was to increase her distance between the Tian E Zuo, the Marine Liberty and the DL Navig8. The plaintiffs also indicated that 0350 hours was the most likely time at which the two vessels\u2019 anchors or anchor chains became entangled. The entanglement resulted in the Tian E Zuo being towed by the Arctic Bridge for about 20 minutes whilst she proceeded north-west from about 0350 hours. Captain Khuzhin\u2019s affidavit evidence-in-chief stated that, at about 0408 hours, the Arctic Bridge was parallel to the Stena Provence at a distance of about 50 metres. At 0410 hours, the bow of the Tian E Zuo collided with the port quarter of the Stena Provence at a speed of about 3 knots over the ground. The impact caused the bow of the Stena Provence to turn to port, towards the Arctic Bridge. At about 0411 hours, the port bow of the Stena Provence made contact with the Arctic Bridge. At the time of the collision, the Arctic Bridge was on a heading of about 284\u00b0. The Arctic Bridge maintained her forward movement, towing the Tian E Zuo along after the contact at 0411 hours. As a result, a second collision occurred between the Tian E Zuo and the Stena Provence at about 0427 hours. The Arctic Bridge contend that there was also a second collision between the Arctic Bridge and the Stena Provence. The defendant do not accept this as the second collision was not pleaded at all.', '18\\u2003I conclude the summary of the factual narrative with a few observations. First, the entire sequence of events spanned over the course of about one hour 40 minutes, from 0247 hours to 0430 hours, on 12 June 2014. Secondly, although the Arctic Bridge was dredging her anchor, she was a vessel underway since 0333 hours. In contrast, the Tian E Zuo was a vessel at anchor from 0330 hours up until the time the involuntary towage started at 0350 hours (see [57] below). That the Tian E Zuo became a vessel underway during the period of the involuntary towage will be examined below. Finally, while there were events that occurred after 0430 hours, such as the Arctic Bridge slipping anchor after the related collisions to move away from the Tian E Zuo, these events are not material to the question of fault of the two vessels.'"}

This gave rise to the 7th charge for theft in dwelling with common intention under s 380 read with s 34 of the PC. I note that the Prosecution appeared mistaken in its Schedule of Offences to have referred to the commission of this offence as being on 20 June 2014, 9', 'when the charge itself stated 20 June 2013.', '11\\u2003On 12 July 2014, the Accused received a student Ez-link card of unknown value belonging to an unknown girl which he had reason to believe was stolen property. This gave rise to the 8th charge for dishonest retention of stolen property under s 411(1) of the PC.', '12\\u2003On 14 July 2014, the Accused together with two others was said to have committed housebreaking by night in order to commit theft with common intention by climbing into a flat through the bedroom window and stole $300 and seven packets of cigarettes. This gave rise to the 6th charge under s 457 read with s 34 of the PC.', '13\\u2003On 15 July 2014, the Accused together with three others was said to have committed snatch theft with common intention of (a) a Nokia phone, (b) six packets of cigarettes, (c) a wallet, and (d) cash amounting to $1,500. This gave rise to the 5th charge under s 356 read with s 34 of the PC.', '14\\u2003The Accused was thereafter arrested. On 18 July 2014, he was charged in the Youth Court and thereupon remanded at the Singapore Boys\u2019 Home (\u201cSBH\u201d) pending investigations for the offences under the 5th to 8th charges. 10', '15\\u2003On 24 July 2014, the Accused was released on bail.', '16\\u2003Whilst on bail, the Accused committed the offences constituting the 9th and 10th charges.', '17\\u2003On 18 September 2014, the Accused converted a skateboard worth $160 to his use. This gave rise to the 9th charge for criminal breach of trust under s 406 of the PC.', '18\\u2003On 3 October 2014, the Accused used both hands to grab the left and right buttocks of a female aged 21 years old.

They split up and did so individually. At about 5.00pm that afternoon, the Accused took a break at a nearby 7-Eleven outlet. 12', '22\\u2003Shortly thereafter, the Accused spotted the Victim waiting at a traffic light junction at Bukit Panjang Road. The Accused decided then to follow her as he \u201cfelt horny\u201d upon seeing her. He trailed the Victim across two pedestrian crossings from Bukit Panjang Road to a block of flats where the Victim resided. 13', 'On arrival at the block approximately 15 minutes later, the Accused hid behind a wall while the Victim waited for the lift. When the lift doors opened, the Victim entered into the lift and the Accused hurried into it after her. He pressed the button for the highest floor in the block so that she would not suspect that he was following her, whereas the Victim pressed the button for a lower floor. 14', 'At about 5.37pm, when the lift door opened at the lower floor, the Victim walked out of the lift into the lift lobby. The Accused followed the Victim and said to her \u201cbaby, I love you\u201d. The Victim did not reply and continued walking towards her unit. 15', '23\\u2003Suddenly, the Accused pushed the Victim against the parapet. She was scared and stood frozen on the spot. 16', '24\\u2003The Accused then hugged the Victim at her waist and kissed her on her lips and neck. The Accused heard the Victim say \u201cgo away\u201d but he ignored her and continued kissing her. He unzipped his knee-length shorts and took out his penis. He then squatted down, lifted the Victim\u2019s dress until it was below her breasts, and pulled the Victim\u2019s panties to her ankle. Thereafter, he put his hand inside her bra and touched both the Victim\u2019s breasts. 17', '25\\u2003The Accused then inserted his finger into the Victim\u2019s vagina, without her consent, causing the Victim to feel pain in her vagina. 18', 'This gave rise to the 3rd charge for sexual assault by penetration under s 376(2)(a) of the PC, punishable under s 376(3) of the same Code.', '26\\u2003Thereafter, the Accused told the Victim to lie down. The Victim refused 19', 'and tried to flee to her flat. However, the Accused held her back and told her \u201cif you never lie down now, I take out my knife\u201d. 20', 'He then pushed her, causing her to fall backwards onto the floor. The Accused climbed on top of her, pulled down her panties, and inserted his penis into her vagina, causing her to feel pain. He did not use a condom and the Victim did not consent to the penetration. The Accused then ejaculated outside the Victim\u2019s vagina and onto her underwear. 21', 'The Victim was petrified. This gave rise to the 2nd charge for aggravated rape under s 375(1)(a) of the PC, punishable under s 375(3)(a)(ii) of the same Code.', '27\\u2003The Accused rummaged through the Victim\u2019s bag and found an orange comb that was approximately 15cm in length. He inserted the comb into the Victim\u2019s vagina without her consent, then pulled it out and put it into her mouth. She was shocked, disgusted, and scared, and pulled out the comb. 22', 'This gave rise to the 4th charge for sexual assault by penetration under s 376(2)(a) of the PC, punishable under s 376(3) of the same Code.', '28\\u2003The Accused then told the Victim \u201cbye bye\u201d and left the scene. 23', 'The Victim quickly returned to her flat and started crying. Subsequently, the Victim\u2019s family members accompanied her to make a police report. 24', '29\\u2003During the incident, the Victim told the Accused a few times that she did not want to have sex with him. The Accused admitted that he continued to have sex with her in spite of her refusal as he \u201cfelt horny\u201d. 25', '30\\u2003On 23 November 2014, the Accused was arrested. His bail was revoked and he has been remanded in SBH since. 26', '31\\u2003On 20 April 2015, the 1st to 10th charges were tendered against the Accused in the Youth Court. 27', 'By the Public Prosecutor\u2019s fiat under s 210 of the CPC dated 17 April 2015, the 1st to 4th charges were transmitted to the High Court.', '32\\u2003According to the Prosecution, investigations were completed on 20 April 2015, but the \u201cpre-trial process, obtainment of the various psychiatric reports, and the court and parties\u2019 availabilities\u201d resulted in the matter eventually being heard close to two years later, on 6 February 2017. 28', 'By then, the Accused was more than 16 years old.', '33\\u2003On 6 February 2017, the Accused pleaded guilty to the proceeded charges (ie, the 2nd to 4th Charges) without qualification and I convicted him accordingly. He consented to the TIC charges being taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.', '34\\u2003In oral submissions at the conviction hearing, the Prosecution submitted that the Accused should be sentenced to between 15 and 18 years\u2019 imprisonment in aggregate and at least 15 strokes of the cane. The Defence argued that the Court should ask for both a probation report and an RT suitability report. Even though the Defence was not urging the Court to impose probation, it submitted that a probation report was more comprehensive and would thus be helpful in considering whether RT should be ordered. The Prosecution submitted that neither probation nor RT should be considered as the principles of prevention and retribution should take centre stage. It stressed that the Accused had acted in a depraved manner by inserting a comb into the vagina of the Victim and then into her mouth. After hearing the parties\u2019 submissions, I called for an RT suitability report for the Accused to be submitted. 29', '35\\u2003Subsequently, Dr Jacob Rajesh (\u201cDr Rajesh\u201d), a senior consultant psychiatrist for the Singapore Prisons Service issued the following documents:', '(a)\\u2003A medical memorandum dated 24 February 2017 which stated that the Accused was not suitable for RT in view of his mild mental retardation. 30', '(b)\\u2003A letter dated 27 February 2017 which stated that due to the Accused\u2019s mild mental retardation, he \u201cmay be\u201d unsuitable for RT as he might find it difficult to cope with the conditions of the RT regime. 31', '(c)\\u2003A medical memorandum dated 7 March 2017 again stating that the Accused was unsuitable for RT and making reference to a medical report which gave the reasons. 32', '(d)\\u2003A medical report dated 8 March 2017 in which he stated his reasons for his views. 33', '36\\u2003By a letter dated 24 April 2017, the parties jointly applied for additional hearing dates to determine the following two issues by way of a Newton hearing: 34', '(a)\\u2003the Accused\u2019s prospects of rehabilitation; and', '(b)\\u2003the Accused\u2019s risk of reoffending.', '37\\u2003The Newton hearing was heard before this Court over four days on 30 October, 6 November, 13 November, and 1 December 2017.

While completing the left turn, his taxi began to travel in the middle of the opposite lane of the entrance to the carpark. The right half of his taxi was encroaching into the opposite side of the road and therefore going against the road direction. The offender then continued to drive into the carpark with his car straddling the opposite lane, instead of moving back into his own lane. According to his mitigation, he did so because he noticed that the road ahead \u201cinevitably merged into a single lane of road with no lane markings\u201d and had \u201cdecided to prematurely travel in the middle of the road in anticipation of the merging lane\u201d 1', '.', '6\\u2003At the same time, the victim, a 55-year-old female, was leaving the said carpark on her motorcycle.
