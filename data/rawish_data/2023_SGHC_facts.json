The chronological sequence of the key events is set out in the plaintiff\u2019s written submissions which were filed at the conclusion of the hearing. 1', '5\\u2003The SPA arose from the defendant\u2019s intended purchase of the Property for the agreed sale price of $3.089m. An Option to Purchase (\u201cOTP\u201d) was issued by the plaintiff to the defendant on 4 June 2018. On payment of the option fee of $308,900, being 10% of the sale price of the Property, the defendant exercised the OTP on 2 July 2018 and the parties entered into the SPA.', '6\\u2003Pursuant to cl 1 of the SPA, the sale and purchase was scheduled for completion on 4 June 2020. Prior to completion, the defendant was allowed to take early possession of the Property from 27 July 2018. However, completion did not take place even after several extensions of the scheduled completion date. The defendant made nine requests for extension of time since April 2020.', '7\\u2003On 26 July 2021, the plaintiff\u2019s solicitors (\u201cDentons\u201d) gave notice to the defendant pursuant to Condition 15 of the Law Society Conditions of Sale 2012 (the \u201cLSS Conditions\u201d) to complete the sale and purchase of the Property by 16 August 2021, in accordance with the terms of the SPA (the \u201cNotice to Complete\u201d). On 18 August 2021, as the defendant did not meet the deadline stipulated in the Notice to Complete, Dentons notified him that the SPA had been terminated on 17 August 2021 and that the plaintiff was entitled to exercise all its rights under cl 5A.2.3 of the SPA and Condition 15 of the LSS Conditions. The plaintiff requested the defendant to deliver up possession of the Property as soon as possible and in any event no later than 4pm on 20 August 2021. The 20 August 2021 deadline was subsequently extended to 8 October 2021.', '8\\u2003After having already been given an extension of the initial 20 August 2021 deadline, the defendant still did not deliver up possession of the Property by 8 October 2021. Hence, the defendant was informed on 8 October 2021 that the plaintiff would commence legal proceedings. On 26 October 2021, the plaintiff commenced the OS seeking, inter alia, a declaration that the SPA had been validly terminated on 17 August 2021 and an order for the defendant to deliver up possession of the Property in accordance with the terms and conditions of the SPA.', '9\\u2003On 18 January 2022, the General Division of the High Court declared that the SPA was validly terminated on 17 August 2021. By way of an Order of Court (HC\/ORC 368\/2022), it was further ordered that:', '(a)\\u2003the plaintiff is entitled to enter into possession of the Property;', '(b)\\u2003the defendant shall deliver possession of the Property to the plaintiff in accordance with the terms and conditions of the SPA within one month from the date of the order;', '(c)\\u2003the defendant shall pay to the plaintiff all outstanding maintenance charges due in respect of the Property and late payment interest at 12% per annum thereon with the quantum to be assessed by the Court together with the other forms of damages to be assessed;', '(d)\\u2003the defendant shall pay to the plaintiff damages arising from the defendant\u2019s breach of contract to be assessed by the Court;', '(e)\\u2003the defendant shall pay to the plaintiff interest on the damages assessed by the Court; and', '(f)\\u2003the defendant shall pay to the plaintiff costs of $7,500 being the costs of the application inclusive of disbursements.', '10\\u2003The defendant did not adhere to the one-month deadline stipulated by the Court for the delivery of possession of the Property. Instead, the defendant applied on 24 February 2022 in HC\/SUM 740\/2022 (\u201cSUM 740\u201d) to seek an extension of time to 27 February 2022 to comply with the order to deliver up possession of the Property.', '11\\u2003 The Court granted the application in SUM 740 on 25 February 2022 with costs to the plaintiff. The defendant was also found liable for the necessary costs of the handover (including any overtime expenses of the plaintiff\u2019s staff), and costs arising from the plaintiff\u2019s attempts to take possession of the Property prior to the date of the hearing, the quantum for which would be decided at the AD hearing.', '12\\u2003The defendant delivered up possession of the Property to the plaintiff on 27 February 2022. The plaintiff alleged that, in breach of its obligations under the SPA, the defendant had failed and\/or refused to reinstate and restore the Property to its original state and condition as at 30 July 2018, the date of vacant possession as defined in the SPA (\u201cVacant Possession Date\u201d). The plaintiff hence engaged several contractors to carry out reinstatement works before proceeding to market and sell the Property.', '13\\u2003On 31 May 2022, the plaintiff issued another purchaser (the \u201cReplacement Purchaser\u201d) an Option to Purchase (the \u201cNew OTP\u201d). The Replacement Purchaser duly exercised the New OTP. Completion of the sale of the Property to the Replacement Purchaser had taken place by the time I delivered judgment on 27 October 2022.', '14\\u2003The parties relied on the evidence of one witness each in the AD hearing, namely the defendant and Mr Koh Chin Beng (\u201cMr Koh\u201d), who testified as the plaintiff\u2019s sole witness.

{"casename":"2023_SGHC_101","fact":"'3\\u2003The parties, CYY and CYZ, are companies involved in the marine salvage industry. CYZ, the respondent, is the owner of a crane barge (\u201cthe Crane Barge\u201d). 1', 'For readability, I will refer to CYY as \u201cthe Charterer\u201d and CYZ as \u201cthe Owner\u201d, their respective positions in relation to the Crane Barge.', '4\\u2003On 24 December 2019, the Charterer was engaged to provide urgent salvage services in respect of a vessel (\u201cthe Casualty\u201d) which had run aground (\u201cthe Salvage Operation\u201d). 2', 'The Charterer immediately appointed a salvage master to oversee the Salvage Operation, who I shall refer to as Mr X. 3', 'The Charterer and Mr X share a long working history, as the Charterer had previously hired Mr X as their salvage master on \u201cmany salvage cases\u201d. 4', '5\\u2003That same day, Mr X, on behalf of the Charterer, contacted the Owner to charter the Crane Barge. The Owner was represented by its managing director, who I shall refer to as Mr Y. Unlike the Charterer, the Owner is physically established in the region of the Salvage Operation. Mr X specifically sought to hire the Crane Barge as it was purpose-built and uniquely equipped to assist with the Salvage Operation. Mr X also had prior experience working with the Crane Barge. As the salvage site was offshore, the Crane Barge was to serve as an offshore command centre for the Salvage Operation, hosting salvage personnel, equipment, and cargo. Given the urgency of the Salvage Operation, this course of action was determined to be more pragmatic than the alternative of repeatedly ferrying salvage personnel to and from the closest port. 5', '6\\u2003On 26 December 2019, Mr X provided the Owner with a preliminary list of equipment and personnel required to enable the Crane Barge to carry out its role as the offshore command centre of the Salvage Operation. 6', 'Given the complexity of the Salvage Operation, the Owner had to procure various permits from regional authorities, hire professional salvage specialists, logistical support staff and equipment, and arrange for visas, supplies and accommodation for personnel. 7', 'The list of requirements was gradually expanded as the Salvage Operation progressed.', '7\\u2003Thereafter, the Charterer and the Owner entered into an agreement to charter the Crane Barge dated 3 January 2020 (\u201cthe Contract\u201d). 8', 'The parties used the Baltic and International Maritime Council Supplytime 2017 Contract for the Time Charter Party for Offshore Support Vessels (\u201cBIMCO Supplytime 2017\u201d), a standard form contract used for the hire of offshore support vessels. 9', '8\\u2003The Contract is expressly governed by Singapore law and contains an arbitration clause naming Singapore as the seat of arbitration. The arbitration clause, cl 37 of the Contract, was chosen by the parties out of several alternative options offered by BIMCO Supplytime 2017 and encompasses \u201cany dispute arising out of or in connection with this Charter Party\u201d.', '9\\u2003In addition to the standard clauses of BIMCO Supplytime 2017, the Contract also includes several additional clauses agreed between the parties. One such additional clause, cl 39 of the Contract, is of central importance to the dispute:', '10\\u2003According to both Mr Y and Mr X, the Owner was entrusted with procuring the staff and equipment necessary to enable the Crane Barge to be used as an offshore command centre, because the Owner was established in the region of the Salvage Operation and had a network of local contacts. In contrast, the Charterer did not have any physical presence in the region and essentially relied on the Owner to procure everything it needed for the Salvage Operation. Mr X therefore agreed with Mr Y that all procurement services undertaken by the Owner at the Charterer\u2019s request would be paid at cost plus a 15% margin. This agreement was then eventually reflected as cl 39 of the Contract. 10', 'According to Mr Y, a clause requiring a service provider to simply procure whatever the other counterparty requests is not unusual in the context of emergency marine salvage operations. 11', '11\\u2003The Charterer does not dispute that Mr X and Mr Y agreed that the Owner would provide assistance for, and on behalf of, the Charterer in the Salvage Operation and does not dispute that the Owner might \u201cpotentially be entitled\u201d to charge a 15% markup for procurement services. What the Charterer does dispute is that such an agreement was incorporated into the Contract. 12', '12\\u2003Throughout the Salvage Operation, the Charterer requested various services, personnel, equipment, and craft, which the Owner procured (the \u201cDisputed Claims\u201d). Contemporaneous invoices incorporating a 15% markup were issued in respect of the Disputed Claims, which were signed by Mr X on behalf of the Charterer. 13', '13\\u2003The Salvage Operation concluded on or around 9 March 2020. 14', '14\\u2003On 23 June 2021, the Owner issued a letter of demand in respect of the Disputed Claims. 15', 'The Charterer did not pay. Accordingly, on 6 July 2021, the Owner commenced arbitration proceedings against the Charterer. 16', '15\\u2003The Owner claimed that it was entitled to the cost of procuring all the services, personnel, equipment, and craft requested by the Charterer plus a 15% margin, pursuant to cl 39. Alternatively, the Owner claimed that it was entitled to damages on a quantum meruit basis for the procurement services rendered. 17', '16\\u2003In response, the Charterer raised a jurisdictional challenge based on two main grounds. First, the Charterer disputed the existence of the arbitration agreement. In this application, the Charterer now concedes the existence of the arbitration agreement which provides for a Singapore seated arbitration. 18', '17\\u2003Second, the Charterer took the position that the Contract and cl 39 therein are strictly limited to procurement services rendered only in relation to the charter of the Crane Barge, and not services rendered in relation to the Salvage Operation generally. Accordingly, as the Disputed Claims relate to procurement services provided in relation to the Salvage Operation generally, they fall outside the scope of the Contract and the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to determine the Disputed Claims. 19', 'To elucidate this distinction, the Charterer gives examples of inspections and surveys of the Crane Barge and the provision of food and supplies to it as services that would fall within the scope of cl 39. 20', 'As the Charterer has already paid all sums owed in relation to the charter of the Crane Barge, there are no claims over which the Tribunal has jurisdiction. 21', 'As for the quantum meruit claim, the Charterer similarly submitted that the arbitration clause was strictly limited to matters relating to the charter of the Crane Barge. Thus, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to determine the quantum meruit claim. 22', '18\\u2003In the Ruling, the Tribunal found that it had the jurisdiction to determine the Disputed Claims.', '19\\u2003In relation to the first objection, the argument that there was no arbitration agreement sprang from how the box layout that forms Part I of the BIMCO Supplytime 2017 standard form had been filled out. This box layout when filled out provides the brief particulars of the contract. Part II of the BIMCO Supplytime 2017 contains the full standard terms. Box 33, which concerns dispute resolution, provides for a choice between several alternative forms for cl 37. 23', 'Although parties filled in \u201c(c)** Singapore law, Singapore arbitration\u201d in Box 33, alternative (c) was deleted in Part II and alternative (d) was retained. 24', 'The Tribunal held that parties\u2019 intention for \u201cSingapore law, Singapore arbitration\u201d was clear. 25', 'Before me, the first objection is not pursued as it is accepted that the insertion of the letter (c) was merely a typographical error and alternative (d) applied.', '20\\u2003In relation to the second objection, the Tribunal observed that the scope of cl 39 was uncertain when considered in a vacuum. The Tribunal thus adopted a contextual interpretation and determined that cl 39 encompassed all procurement services rendered by the Owner in relation to the entire Salvage Operation. This was an interpretation that the express words of cl 39 could reasonably bear. The Contract had been concluded in the context of an emergency and the \u201coverall commercial purpose of the [Contract] was to urgently salvage [the Casualty]\u201d. The Charterers had no presence, equipment, or resources in the locality, and it was thus \u201cintended that the [Owner] was to play an important role in procuring and providing resources, equipment and personnel to support the Salvage Operation\u201d. Although the Contract was a standard form contract, the fact remained that cl 39 was an additional clause specifically added by the parties and was therefore intended to address matters not covered by BIMCO Supplytime 2017. The Tribunal did not take into consideration any purported oral agreement reached between Mr X and Mr Y prior to the Contract. Having reached this conclusion, the Tribunal found that it was unnecessary to determine whether it had jurisdiction to determine the quantum meruit claim. Nevertheless, the Tribunal concluded that, considering the aforementioned context of the Contract and the fact that the Contract expressly named the Casualty as the area of operation of the Crane Barge, the quantum meruit claim also fell within the scope of the arbitration clause. 26', 'The Tribunal thus concluded that it has jurisdiction to determine the Disputed Claims on the basis of cl 39 or as a quantum meruit claim.'"}

{"casename":"2023_SGHC_106","fact":"'6\\u2003I start with a brief elaboration of the background facts. To begin, USP Group is a public company limited by shares. It is listed on the main board of the Singapore Stock Exchange since 2007. At present, it has issued and paid-up share capital of over $67m, comprising 90,922,003 shares, of which 634,600 are treasury shares.', '7\\u2003On 26 October 2022, the Requisition Notice was sent to USP Group. The Requisition Notice called for the passing of nine ordinary resolutions which pertained to the removal of the existing Board of Directors, and for the appointment of a new Board of Directors. The Requisition Notice provided several reasons to explain these resolutions, two of which being that the current Board of Directors lacks shareholder support and that there is a need for the renewal of leadership. For present purposes, there is no need to go into these reasons any further.', '8\\u2003At the time of the Requisition Notice, the Requisitionists were the beneficial owners of a total of 9,942,220 ordinary shares. This represented approximately 11.01% of the total issued and paid-up ordinary shares (excluding treasury shares) of USP Group. Crucially, however, none of the Requisitionists\u2019 names appear on USP Group\u2019s Register of Members on 26 October 2022. Instead, in the Requisition Notice, each of the Requisitionists signed off in their own capacities, on behalf of various brokerage houses. The names of these brokerage houses appear on USP Group\u2019s Register of Members.', '9\\u2003On 27 October 2022, USP Group released a general announcement to say that it had received the Requisition Notice. The general announcement further stated that USP Group was seeking legal advice on the contents of the Requisition Notice and that shareholders would be updated in due course. By way of follow-up to the Requisition Notice, USP Group sent a letter to the Requisitionists on 3 November 2022. By that letter, USP Group asked the Requisitionists to provide copies of the authority letters referred to in the Requisition Notice as evidence that the Requisitionists remained the beneficial owners of their respective shareholdings in USP Group as at the date of the Requisition Notice.', '10\\u2003On 11 November 2022, the Requisitionists sent USP Group a letter enclosing the authority letters which showed the Requisitionists\u2019 shareholdings. On 14 November 2022, USP Group sent the Requisitionists a letter to say that USP Group was \u201ccarefully considering\u201d the Requisition Notice and the authority letters that had been provided to them. On 22 November 2022, USP Group sent the Requisitionists an email to say that USP Group\u2019s Board of Directors had \u201ccarefully considered\u201d the Requisition Notice and resolved not to convene the EGM. Further to this email, USP Group on 24 November 2022 released an announcement stating that it will not be convening an EGM.', '11\\u2003Between 30 November 2022 and 29 December 2022, USP Group and the Requisitionists continued to correspond in relation to the Requisition Notice. Specifically, by a letter dated 30 November 2022, the Requisitionists informed USP Group that they disagreed with USP Group\u2019s announcement on 24 November 2022 that it would not be convening the EGM. The Requisitionists asked USP Group to immediately convene the EGM within two months from the receipt of the Requisition Notice, pursuant to s 176(1). The Requisitionists also stated that if USP Group did not convene the EGM within seven days, then they would proceed to convene the EGM to consider the various resolutions raised. When USP Group did not reply by 9 December 2022, the Requisitionists sent USP Group a letter on 9 December 2022, in which the Requisitionists stated that they would \u201cproceed to exercise their rights pursuant to Section 176(3) of the [Companies] Act and recover all reasonable expenses incurred by the [Requisitionists] from current directors of [USP Group] pursuant to Section 176(4) of the [Companies] Act\u201d. 1', '12\\u2003When USP Group did not reply to this letter, the Requisitionists sent yet another letter to USP Group on 16 December 2022. In this letter, the Requisitionists stated that they would proceed to exercise their rights pursuant to s 176(3) of the Companies Act and recover all reasonable expenses incurred by them from the current directors of USP Group pursuant to s 176(4) of the same Act. On 19 December 2022, USP Group finally responded by way of an email stating that USP Group would take reasonable steps to cooperate with the Requisitionists when the Requisitionists convened the EGM. The email also indicated that USP Group would like to be involved in the review of the appointments and\/or scope of engagement of any third-party service providers as well as any documents relating to the EGM. The Requisitionists replied by letter on the same day to state, among other things, that they would proceed to conduct the EGM and that, to that end, they had appointed Toppan Merrill Pte Ltd to print and dispatch the EGM documents to the shareholders. In particular, the Requisitionists requested for a copy of the register and index of members in the following formats: (a) as of 23 December 2022 for their inspection pursuant to s 192(2) of the Companies Act, which was for the purpose of dispatching the Notice of EGM, Shareholders\u2019 Circular, and related documents; and (b) as of 11am on 18 January 2023, being 72 hours before the scheduled EGM.', '13\\u2003On 22 December 2022, the Requisitionists sent USP Group an email stating that the proposed EGM was scheduled for 20 January 2023. The email also provided further information relating to ancillary matters for the conduct of the EGM. The parties exchanged several emails later that day in relation to the Requisitionists\u2019 request for USP Group to instruct its Share Registrar to release the Register of Members and to assist with the various ancillary matters set out in the Requisitionists\u2019 letter of 19 December 2022. In the end, the Requisitionists concluded that USP Group had clearly shown an intention not to cooperate with the Requisitionists. In particular, based on the time for the inspection on 23 December 2022, and for the Share Registrar to meet the Requisitionists\u2019 requests, USP Group would have to give instructions to the Share Registrar before the close of business hours on 22 December 2022. Since USP Group had failed to do that, the Share Registrar was not in a position to provide the Register of Members to the Requisitionists by 23 December 2022. On 23 December 2022, USP Group responded to deny that it did not intend to cooperate with the Requisitionists. It also attached its email instructing the Share Registrar to provide the Requisitionists with the relevant information as of 23 December 2022.', '14\\u2003USP Group finally provided the relevant information to the Requisitionists on 27 December 2022. However, the Requisitionists say that it was already impossible for the EGM to be conducted by the intended deadline of 26 January 2023. Given what the Requisitionists perceived to be USP Group\u2019s lack of cooperation in assisting them in convening the EGM, the Requisitionists appointed Jacque Law LLC (\u201cJacque Law\u201d) to enforce their rights against USP Group. Jacque Law sent an email to USP Group on the same day to state, among other things, that the Requisitionists intended to apply to court by 29 December 2022 to seek an extension of the validity of the Requisition Notice by a period of eight weeks from the date the court makes the order.', '15\\u2003When USP Group did not reply to Jacque Law\u2019s email sent on 27 December 2022, the Requisitionists filed HC\/OA 894\/2022 (\u201cOA 894\u201d) on 29 December 2022 to seek an extension of the validity of the Requisition Notice. OA 894 concluded with a court order on 13 February 2023 which extended the validity of the Requisition Notice by a period of eight weeks (\u201cthe OA 894 Order\u201d). The OA 894 Order also directed USP Group to provide other assistance to enable the Requisitionists to convene the EGM. To this end, the Requisitionists wrote to USP Group on 17 February 2023 to take steps to convene the EGM.', '16\\u2003However, due to what the Requisitionists have characterised as \u201ca barrage of excuses\u201d from USP Group, the Requisitionists could not hold the EGM by the deadline pursuant to the OA 894 Order, ie, 10 April 2023. The Requisitionists then filed HC\/SUM 676\/2023 (\u201cSUM 676\u201d) on 9 March 2023. The Requisitionists had asked for a further extension of time of three weeks from 10 April 2023 to 1 May 2023 to hold the EGM pursuant to the Requisition Notice. A day after the Requisitionists filed SUM 676, USP Group filed OA 218.

Mr Ravi\u2019s \nPC for PY 2021\/2022 had been issued subject to certain conditions which were \ndesigned to ensure his fitness to practice while he underwent treatment for his \nVersion No 1: 26 Apr 2023 (12:24 hrs)\nLaw Society of Singapore v Ravi s\/o Madasamy [2023] SGHC 112\n3psychiatric condition. The grounds for the AG\u2019s application in OS 237 were that \nMr Ravi allegedly \u201cengaged in improper conduct or misconduct unbefitting an \nadvocate and solicitor \u2026 on multiple occasions, and [had] breached numerous \nprovisions of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct Rules) 2015 \u2026\u201d. The \nalleged improper conduct related to Mr Ravi\u2019s: (a) \u201cconduct of court hearings \nand legal cases\u201d; (b) \u201cacting without clients\u2019 instructions and yet \nmisrepresenting that he had such instructions\u201d; (c) \u201cacting in sub judice\u201d; (d) \n\u201cfailing to comply with a court order\u201d; and (e) breaching certain conditions of \nhis PC for PY 2021\/2022. It was also stated in the supporting affidavit filed by \nMr Hui Choon Kuen (\u201cMr Hui\u201d) for the AG that, apart from these alleged \ninstances of improper conduct, Mr Ravi was also facing pending disciplinary \nproceedings in relation to other complaints of misconduct \u2013 one of these being \nthe present proceedings in C3J\/OS 2\/2022 (\u201cOS 2\u201d). In the AG\u2019s view, the \n\u201cgravity and frequency\u201d of Mr Ravi\u2019s misconduct gave rise to \u201cgrave concerns \nthat [Mr Ravi would] persist in prejudicing the administration of justice, \nundermining public confidence in the integrity and honour of the legal \nprofession, and undermining public confidence in the rule of law and the \nintegrity of the Singapore legal system\u201d, which warranted a suspension of his \nPC under s 27B(1)(a)(ii) of the LPA.\n4 OS 237 was filed slightly less than three weeks before Mr Ravi\u2019s PC for \nPY 2021\/2022 was due to expire. It was explained in Mr Hui\u2019s affidavit that this \nwas done to \u201cprevent [Mr Ravi] from applying for another PC until [all the \npending] disciplinary proceedings [against him] have been determined\u201d. This \nwas a reference to a PC for the practice year 2022\/2023 (\u201cPY 2022\/2023\u201d) and \nbeyond. \n5 In this regard, the AG relied on s 27B(6) of the LPA, which provides \nthat:\nVersion No 1: 26 Apr 2023 (12:24 hrs)\nLaw Society of Singapore v Ravi s\/o Madasamy [2023] SGHC 112\n4(6) Where the suspension of the practising certificate of a \nsolicitor under this section has terminated by reason only of the \nexpiry of the solicitor\u2019s current practising certificate and not by \nreason of the occurrence of any of the events mentioned in \nsubsection (4), the solicitor must not apply for another practising \ncertificate until any of the events mentioned in subsection (4) has \noccurred; and if a practising certificate has been issued to the \nsolicitor, that certificate ceases to be in force. \n[emphasis added]\n6 Section 27B(4) of the LPA in turn provides that:\n(4) If, in a case where a Judge has made an order under \nsubsection (1)(a)(ii) suspending a solicitor\u2019s current practising \ncertificate \u2014\n(a) the Disciplinary Tribunal determines under \nsection 93(1)(a) that no cause of sufficient gravity \nfor disciplinary action against the solicitor exists \nunder section 83 or determines under \nsection 93(1)(b) that the solicitor should be \nreprimanded;\n(b) the application made against the solicitor under \nsection 98(1) is withdrawn or dismissed; or\n(c) an order has been made under section 98 that the \nsolicitor be struck off the roll, suspended from \npractice or censured, or that the solicitor pay a \npenalty,\nthe suspension of the practising certificate of the solicitor \nterminates immediately.\n7 The AG\u2019s position was that upon the expiration of Mr Ravi\u2019s PC for \nPY 2021\/2022 and by virtue of s 27B(6) read with s 27B(4) of the LPA, Mr Ravi \nwould not be permitted to apply for another PC until the pending disciplinary \nmatters had concluded if the court ordered a suspension of his PC under \ns 27B(1)(a)(ii) of the LPA.    \n8 The hearing for OS 237 was fixed for hearing before Aedit Abdullah J \non 30 March 2022. However, on 23 March 2022, the AG wrote in to inform the \ncourt that:\nVersion No 1: 26 Apr 2023 (12:24 hrs)\nLaw Society of Singapore v Ravi s\/o Madasamy [2023] SGHC 112\n5\u2026 both parties have reached an agreement for OS 237 to be \ndiscontinued by consent on the term that the Respondent \nconfirms and undertakes to the Supreme Court of Singapore \nand to the Attorney-General that he has not applied, and shall \nnot apply, for a Practising Certificate for Practice Year \n2022\/2023.\n9 Following this, a consent order was granted by Abdullah J on 30 March \n2022 in materially similar terms (the \u201cConsent Order\u201d), recording Mr Ravi\u2019s \nundertaking not to apply for a PC for PY 2022\/2023 before 31 March 2023 \n(\u201cMr Ravi\u2019s Undertaking\u201d). OS 237 was thereby withdrawn.\n10 Returning to the events following the release of our Judgment in OS 2, \nin response to Mr Ravi\u2019s 24 March 2023 Correspondence, we directed that \nMr Ravi clarify: (a) what the legal significance of his undertaking in OS 237 \nnot to apply for a PC for PY 2022\/2023 was in relation to the sanction we had \nimposed in OS 2; and (b) what was his position on how the sanction imposed in \nOS 2 may be \u201crectif[ied]\u201d, and the grounds upon which he contends that such \n\u201crectif[ication]\u201d should be done. The Law Society was also invited to respond \nto Mr Ravi\u2019s reply.\n11  On 29 March 2023, Mr Ravi furnished his response (the \u201c29 March \n2023 Correspondence\u201d). Referring to the Consent Order, Mr Ravi contended \nthat:\nThe effect of the order of 30 March 2022 was to forbid [him] \nfrom applying for a practising certificate. The fact [that he] had \nconsented to refrain from applying for a practicing certificate in \norder to save additional proceedings and wasted costs had the \nsame effect as the Court forbidding him from applying for a \npracticing certificate. \u2026\n\u2026\nUnder section 83(1) of the Legal Profession Act, the maximum \nperiod of suspension that can be ordered by the Court as a \npenalty is 5 years.  Since [he] had been ordered by the Court to \nrefrain from applying for a practising certificate since March \nVersion No 1: 26 Apr 2023 (12:24 hrs)\nLaw Society of Singapore v Ravi s\/o Madasamy [2023] SGHC 112\n62022, the period of suspension that the Court has imposed is a \ntotal of 6 years, less 9 days.\n[emphasis added]\n12 In essence, Mr Ravi viewed his voluntary undertaking as substantially \nand legally equivalent to a suspension that may be ordered by this court pursuant \nto s 83(1) of the LPA upon due cause being shown. Mr Ravi therefore suggested \nthat our order for the five-year suspension to commence at the date of the \nJudgment, taken together with his undertaking not to apply for a PC for \nPY 2022\/2023, effectively amounted to a six-year suspension. In Mr Ravi\u2019s \nview, this exceeded the maximum five years\u2019 suspension that this court can \nimpose under s 83(1)(b) of the LPA. Mr Ravi also averred that should his \nvoluntary undertaking not be taken into account, \u201cany period that a legal \npractitioner voluntarily agreed not to practise to allow complaints against him \nto be investigated and pursued would be in addition to any penalty, [and] that \nwould be a significant disincentive for such a practitioner to agree in advance \nto a period of suspension\u201d. He thus sought a variation of the order in OS 2 such \nthat his suspension would be reflected as having commenced on 30 March 2022, \nthat being the date Mr Ravi\u2019s Undertaking was recorded under the Consent \nOrder.\n13 The Law Society disagreed with Mr Ravi\u2019s position. In a letter to the \ncourt dated 10 April 2023 (the \u201cLaw Society\u2019s Letter\u201d), it submitted that \u201cthe \nCourt of Three Judges is only prevented under Section 83(1) of the LPA from \nimposing a five-year suspension to commence after a first period of suspension \nwhen that first period of suspension was imposed by the Court of Three Judges\u201d \n[emphasis in original omitted]. In the present case, as Mr Ravi\u2019s \u201csuspension\u201d \nwas voluntary, it could only be considered as a mitigating factor in the court\u2019s \ndetermination on sentence. In that regard, the Law Society argued that \nVersion No 1: 26 Apr 2023 (12:24 hrs)\nLaw Society of Singapore v Ravi s\/o Madasamy [2023] SGHC 112\n7Mr Ravi\u2019s conduct throughout the proceedings in OS 2 indicated an utter lack \nof remorse, and therefore his \u201cvoluntary suspension\u201d should be afforded no \nmitigating weight at all.\n14 On 14 April 2023, Mr Ravi responded by e-mail to the Law Society\u2019s \nLetter (the \u201c14 April 2023 Correspondence\u201d). Mr Ravi clarified that his position \nwas not that \u201cthe period he voluntarily refrained from applying for his practising \ncertificate must automatically be deducted from the period of suspension. All \n[he] requested, since it had not been referred to in the judgment, was that it be \ntaken into account as a mitigating factor\u201d. We should point out that, given the \ncontents of Mr Ravi\u2019s 29 March 2023 Correspondence (set out at [ 11] above), \nit is not entirely clear that all Mr Ravi had been seeking was to raise the fact of \nhis voluntary suspension as a mitigating factor. Indeed, even in his first \ncommunication which we reproduced at [ 1] above, Mr Ravi had asked that we \nrectify the suspension order. And in the next communication by way of the \n29 March 2023 Correspondence, he had, in fact, submitted that \u201cthis period [of \nrefraining from applying for a PC should] be deducted from the penalty of 5 \nyears suspension\u201d [emphasis added]. It appears to us that his arguments in the \n29 March 2023 Correspondence were directed toward the legal nature of his \nundertaking, rather than, as he had set out in the 14 April 2023 Correspondence, \na plea for this court to consider the fact of this undertaking in arriving at the \nappropriate sentence. Nonetheless, we consider both issues.  \nOur decision\n15 While a court exercising disciplinary jurisdiction has the power to \nimpose consecutive periods of suspension, the total of such periods cannot \nexceed five years pursuant to s 83(1)(b) of the LPA: Law Society of Singapore \nv Yap Bock Heng Christopher [2014] 4 SLR 877 at [39]. Mr Ravi\u2019s contention \nVersion No 1: 26 Apr 2023 (12:24 hrs)\nLaw Society of Singapore v Ravi s\/o Madasamy [2023] SGHC 112\n8in his 29 March 2023 Correspondence, therefore, hinges on the issue of whether \nMr Ravi\u2019s Undertaking constitutes a \u201csuspen[sion] from practice\u201d pursuant to \ns 83(1)(b). \n16 In our judgment, this is plainly not the case. Mr Ravi\u2019s Undertaking was \nentirely voluntary and did not arise from an order of the Court of Three Judges \n(\u201cC3J\u201d) upon \u201cdue cause shown\u201d (pursuant to s 83(1) of the LPA). There is \ntherefore no statutory basis to view Mr Ravi\u2019s voluntary cessation from practice \nas a suspension under the LPA. While Mr Ravi placed emphasis on the fact that \nhis undertaking was recorded as a \u201cCourt order\u201d (this being the Consent Order), \nwe are unable to see how this fact alone has any bearing on the sentence imposed \nin the present proceedings.

Although the Deceased rented a room for them both when the Defendant arrived in Singapore, 19', 'he also handed the Defendant a full set of keys to the Flat, telling her \u201cthis is our home, whether we stay here or not\u201d. 20', '13\\u2003After the Defendant\u2019s arrival in Singapore, the Deceased would stay with her in their rented room, while returning to the Flat to sleep at night. He did this because as a taxi driver, he had to wake up early at 3am to start his graveyard shift and did not want to disturb the Defendant\u2019s sleep. Each morning, during his morning break, the Deceased would meet with the Defendant at their rented room, where she would prepare breakfast for him. 21', 'The Deceased would also bring the Defendant to the Flat every two to three days.

The Deceased\u2019s friend claimed to have checked online and to have found that the Deceased and the Defendant \u201cwere indeed still married\u201d.

The Deceased was displeased and commented to the Defendant that it was time for HWF to leave the Flat. 43', 'Perhaps feeling embarrassed about her live-in boyfriend, HWF told the Deceased that he could bring the Defendant home to live in the Flat. Around this time, the Deceased and the Defendant started making plans to rent out the second bedroom which had previously been occupied by the former\u2019s father. Unfortunately, their plans came to nought because of HWF, who insisted that any tenant would have to use the toilet in the master bedroom (i.e. the room used by the Deceased and the Defendant). The Defendant was very upset that HWF was still making things difficult for them, and consequently refused to move into the Flat. 44', 'The Deceased was also upset and angry: he suggested that they should get his elder brother to help him sell the Flat so that the two of them could move into a smaller flat. 45', 'During this period, in March 2016, he also gave her money to study for and to obtain certification as a masseuse. 46', '25\\u2003Unfortunately, the Deceased\u2019s plans to sell the Flat also did not materialise when he later became ill. In April 2016, the Deceased\u2019s feet became swollen, and he had to go for check-ups. The Deceased did not want the Defendant to accompany him for these check-ups, and would tell her after each check-up that \u201ceverything was fine, nothing serious\u201d. In the meantime, the Defendant arranged for him to go for Traditional Chinese Medicine treatments and tried \u2013 unsuccessfully \u2013 to get him to stop working. 47', '26\\u2003In July 2016, the Defendant insisted on going to the hospital with the Deceased. On meeting the Claimant at the hospital, the Defendant offered to pay for the Deceased\u2019s medical bills, but the Claimant declined her offer. On the way back from this hospital visit, the Deceased reiterated to the Defendant that if anything were to happen to him, there was still the Flat which she could choose to stay in or to sell and retire to China. He also advised her to look to his eldest sister (ie, the Claimant) for help if anything were to happen to him. 48', '27\\u2003The Deceased continued to work despite his illness. From July 2016 onwards, the Defendant stopped him from driving her to work daily. Sadly, he passed away on 9 September 2016. The Defendant found out about his death when he did not come to meet her as usual on that day: when she called him, his second sister answered the call and told her about his passing. The Defendant wanted to rush down to the hospital but was told to go to the funeral home the next day instead. 49', '28\\u2003At the funeral home, as she was leaving after the cremation of the Deceased, the Deceased was informed by the Claimant that the latter would be putting a stop to the Deceased\u2019s CPF payments for the Defendant\u2019s hospital insurance premiums. 50', 'Following the funeral, the Deceased returned to China to grieve. When she later returned to Singapore, she buried herself in her work as a means of coping with her grief. 51', '29\\u2003According to the Defendant, despite having her contact number, the Claimant never informed her of the notice from HDB about the Home Improvement Program, nor did the Claimant tell her about the application for letters of administration in respect of the Deceased\u2019s estate. 52', 'Instead, the Deceased\u2019s family members apparently gave the Defendant\u2019s contact number to their lawyers; and in March 2022, the Claimant\u2019s lawyers contacted the Defendant in an attempt to get her to sign a declaration relating to the Flat. The lawyers did not accede to her request that they send her the document for her to take a look at before signing. 53', 'On 1 June 2022, the Defendant received another letter from the Claimant\u2019s lawyers: this time, the Claimant said she took the position \u2013 as the legal representative of the Estate \u2013 that the Flat belonged both legally and beneficially to the Estate; that the Defendant held the Flat \u201con trust\u201d for the Estate; and that she was to take \u201cimmediate steps\u201d to transfer the Flat to the Estate. 54', '30\\u2003In cross-examination, the Defendant testified that after the Deceased\u2019s passing, she did not dare to visit the Flat as she was afraid of HWF whom she found \u201cvery fierce\u201d. She also did not want to \u201ccome to Court to chase \u2018HWF\u2019 out of the [Flat]\u201d as HWF was still \u201cfamily\u201d; and the Deceased himself had not tried to chase her out during his lifetime. It was only after being sued by the Claimant and after learning that HWF had moved out of the Flat that the Defendant gathered up the courage to go to the Flat. This was sometime in late 2022. By then, the lock on the wooden door to the Flat had been changed, and she had to break open the padlock in order to enter the premises. 55', '31\\u2003Turning to the Claimant\u2019s account of events, she asserts that the Flat was paid for and maintained solely by the Deceased; 56', 'and that the Deceased continued to sleep overnight in the Flat even after his marriage to the Defendant 57', '. As for the Defendant, the Claimant alleges that she never stayed overnight in the Flat; 58', 'and that she had to be chaperoned by the Deceased during all her visits to the Flat. 59', 'The Claimant denies that the Defendant did any cleaning of the rooms in the Flat, claiming that she (the Claimant) was the one who cleaned her late father\u2019s room in the Flat. 60', 'Further, the Claimant felt it was significant that the Defendant had not kept the original title deed with her but had instead stored it at the Flat. 61', '32\\u2003The Claimant also alleges that from the time of the Deceased\u2019s death in September 2015 until sometime in late 2022, the Defendant did not visit the Flat at all, 62', 'nor did she broach the topic of the Flat with the Claimant at any time. 63', 'In respect of HDB\u2019s Home Improvement Programme for the Flat, the Claimant says she alone paid for the costs of this programme together with the late payment interests, in the sums of $18,001.09 and $47.40 respectively.

Indeed, the Deceased\u2019s siblings did not even know about the Deceased\u2019s marriage to the Defendant on 22 June 2010. 67', 'The Defendant never had a close relationship with any of the Deceased\u2019s siblings; 68', 'and she attended only one family gathering with the Deceased\u2019s family during Chinese New Year in 2011: that was the first time when the Claimant and his other siblings learnt of his marriage to the Deceased. 69', '34\\u2003The Claimant also alleges that the Defendant and the Deceased did not share \u201cintimacy as husband and wife\u201d in the Deceased\u2019s room. In her testimony in cross-examination, the Claimant contended that their marriage was a \u201csham\u201d marriage. 70', 'HWF, who gave evidence at the hearing before me, claimed that when the Deceased and the Defendant came over to the Flat, they would never close the room door. 71', '35\\u2003According to the Claimant, when the Deceased fell ill, she was the one who brought him for his medical appointments.

The district judge (the \u201cDJ\u201d) reversed the Registrar\u2019s Decision, deciding that (a) the respondent was not required to re-quantify his claim; all that was required was that the respondent record in writing that he would abandon the amount of his claim beyond the DC Limit; and (b) any reduction in damages on account of the respondent\u2019s contributory negligence should be from the quantum of damages assessed, not the re-quantified claim (the \u201cDJ\u2019s Decision\u201d).', '5\\u2003The appellant appealed the DJ\u2019s Decision.'"}
{"casename":"2023_SGHC_119","fact":"'7\\u2003The respondent admitted without qualification to the material facts of this case as set out in the Statement of Facts. On the night of 5 February 2022, the respondent drank four small glasses of \u201cChivas\u201d at his shop located at Upper Bukit Timah Road. After the drinking session at his shop, the respondent decided to drive himself and his wife back to their home located at Block 220 Petir Road.', '8\\u2003At the carpark near their home, the respondent failed to keep a proper lookout as he was reversing into a parallel parking lot. His car collided into the right side of a car belonging to the Victim, which was parked ahead. Both cars were damaged, with scratches and dents on the rear right side of the Victim\u2019s car. The cost of repairs to the Victim\u2019s car was $2,400. The respondent had made full restitution to the Victim.', '9\\u2003At the time of the accident, the weather was clear, the road surface was dry, and the traffic volume was light.', '10\\u2003After the collision, the respondent and his wife left for home. About two hours later, on 6 February 2022 at about 12.11am, the Victim discovered the damage to both his car and the respondent\u2019s car and called the police. The police tracked down the respondent at his home. The respondent failed a breathalyser test and was arrested. He was escorted to the Traffic Police Headquarters. At about 3.27am, a Breath Analysing Device test conducted on the respondent revealed that there was 85\u03bcg of alcohol in every 100ml of the respondent\u2019s breath. This exceeded the prescribed limit of 35\u03bcg of alcohol per 100ml of breath.', '11\\u2003At the plead guilty mention, the Prosecution sought a sentence of three weeks\u2019 imprisonment and three years\u2019 disqualification for the Careless Driving Offence on the basis that the case fell within Band 2 of the framework laid down by Sundaresh Menon CJ in Wu Zhi Yong. The Prosecution submitted that this was warranted as the respondent\u2019s alcohol level was at the high end of Band 3 of the framework in Rafael Voltaire Alzate v Public Prosecutor [2022] 3 SLR 993 (\u201cRafael\u201d) at [31]. The respondent was to be punished as a repeat offender and was also irresponsible in failing to notify the Victim of the damage caused to his car.', '12\\u2003The respondent, who was unrepresented below, pleaded in mitigation that he was advanced in age and had since sold his car and stopped driving. 2', 'He highlighted that he understood that drink-driving is wrong and sought the court\u2019s forgiveness. 3', 'He also claimed to have \u201cmany things to attend to outside\u201d 4', 'and to have recently been diagnosed with nerve issues in his right hand. 5', '13\\u2003The DJ sentenced the respondent to a fine of $7,000 and three years\u2019 disqualification for the Drink Driving Offence. In relation to the Careless Driving Offence, which lies at the heart of the present appeal, the DJ sentenced the respondent to a fine of $4,000 and 30 months\u2019 disqualification.', '14\\u2003In determining the sentence for the Careless Driving Offence, the DJ drew guidance from the two-step sentencing approach in Wu Zhi Yong.', '15\\u2003At the first step, the DJ considered the offence-specific factors. In this regard, the DJ considered the circumstances in which the offence was committed and the harm caused (GD at [48]\u2013[52]). In particular, she noted the respondent\u2019s status as a repeat offender \u201cby virtue of his 1998 and 2004 speeding convictions and his level of alcohol [which] was at the second highest band of Rafael\u201d. She opined that this would only affect the seriousness of his offence to a limited extent, 6', 'as the extent of his irresponsible driving within the carpark was swiping the rear right portion of the Victim\u2019s motorcar while trying to parallel park his car. The DJ further noted that the respondent\u2019s previous convictions were relevant but dated. The DJ found that the present case involved a lower level of seriousness falling within Band 1 of the Wu Zhi Yong framework, with a starting point of a fine of $6,000.', '16\\u2003At the second step, the DJ calibrated the sentence based on the offender-specific factors. The DJ considered that there was potential harm, albeit not of a significant degree, in view of the time of the offence, the light volume of traffic, the respondent\u2019s manner of driving and his low speed as he parallel-parked his car. Further, the extent of property damage consisted of scratches and dents and thus fell within the higher level of the low harm category.', '17\\u2003Overall, the DJ found the following factors aggravating. 7', 'The respondent\u2019s alcohol level was high. In addition, after consuming alcohol, the respondent drove home from Upper Bukit Timah Road to Petir Road with his wife as a passenger. She also considered the TIC charge as an aggravating factor. The DJ observed that the respondent, having failed to provide his particulars after the accident, would have escaped responsibility for his charges if the Victim had not discovered the damage early.', '18\\u2003In terms of the mitigating factors, the DJ considered that the respondent\u2019s plea of guilt at the first court mention was a sign of his genuine remorse and, therefore, a mitigating factor. Furthermore, the DJ considered that the respondent had provided restitution to the Victim for the cost of repairs amounting to $2,400 before the first court mention.', '19\\u2003Considering these factors and the totality principle, the DJ calibrated the sentence downwards to a fine of $4,000. The DJ also imposed a disqualification period of 30 months, which was in line with the range of two to three years\u2019 disqualification for a Band 1 offence delineated in Wu Zhi Yong.'"}
{"casename":"2023_SGHC_12","fact":"'4\\u2003The Plaintiff is B High House International Pte Ltd \u2013 a company incorporated in Singapore. The Plaintiff is in the business of managing and collecting payments for the group of companies to which it belongs. To that end, the Plaintiff processes payment transactions and manages, collects and recovers payments from customers (\u201cthird party customers\u201d) of its principal affiliates. Specifically, in respect of the monies claimed by the Plaintiff in these proceedings, it is not disputed that these monies were from payments made by customers of the Plaintiff\u2019s principal, Blue High House SA (\u201cBlue SA\u201d) on the latter\u2019s website BetOnline.ag. To facilitate the collection and processing of payments from third party customers, the Plaintiff maintains a worldwide network of third-party processing agents. 1', '5\\u2003The 1st Defendant is MCDP Phoenix Services Pte Ltd \u2013 a company incorporated in Singapore.

He is the sole shareholder, Chief Executive Officer (\u201cCEO\u201d) as well as the Managing Director of the 1st Defendant. 3', 'While the Plaintiff alleged that Mr Carbonara was the alter ego of MCDP, 4', 'both the Defendants denied this. 5', '6\\u2003The parties presented starkly different accounts of their relationships, as well as their relationship with the Third Party to this suit, Mr Berger, during the period 2019 to 2020. Mr Berger did not appear in these proceedings. As I will explain in these written grounds, whether the Plaintiff could succeed in its claim ultimately turned on whether it could adduce sufficient evidence to support its account of the relationships between the parties and the obligations they owed each other.', '7\\u2003Before I set out the parties\u2019 respective accounts of events, I outline briefly below how payment processing works in general.', '8\\u2003For the majority of consumers in the modern world, cashless payment has all but become the norm. The ubiquitous card reader or QR code awaits at the checkout counter: with a simple tap of a credit card or mobile phone, payment has been made, and the consumer is free to depart with their purchases. But behind the simple act of tapping of one\u2019s card on a payment terminal lies an entire system which supports the simple convenience of cashless payment. In its simplest form, a payment processing service is one which enables credit card or online payments to be made to a merchant. 6', 'There are numerous service providers in the payment processing ecosystem, and they differ in both the scope and suite of services provided. Some service providers may provide the entire range of services necessary to enable payments from a customer to a merchant whilst others may only cater to a specific type of service. 7', 'A service provider does not necessarily need to provide a particular service themselves \u2013 they may engage the functions of other service providers in order to do so on their behalf.', '9\\u2003These are the basic stages of payment processing:', '(a)\\u2003The customer purchases goods or services from the merchant by either entering his card details into a point-of-sale terminal or an online payment gateway, or tapping his credit or debit card on the card reader.', '(b)\\u2003The payment information will be sent to the acquiring bank. The acquiring bank processes the payment transaction for the merchant. It does so by sending the payment information to the respective card networks (ie, Visa or Mastercard) who in turn sends the information on to the issuing bank (ie, the bank which issued the credit or debit card to the customer).', '(c)\\u2003The acquiring bank identifies which transactions belong to a particular merchant, or payment processor, through the issuance of a Merchant Identification Number (\u201cMID\u201d) to the relevant merchant or payment processor. This MID is associated with a merchant account.', '(d)\\u2003The issuing bank decides whether to approve or decline a particular transaction based on its own parameters. The card networks, the acquiring bank, the merchant and the customer are eventually notified as to whether the transaction has been approved or declined.', '(e)\\u2003If the payment transaction is approved, the issuing bank then sends the funds to the acquiring bank which then remits these funds (less any fees charged) to the merchant.', '(f)\\u2003The role of the payment processor is to act as the intermediary between the merchant and the acquiring bank. 8', '10\\u2003The Plaintiff claimed that Mr Berger was a sales representative who would match, arrange or refer online merchant clients to the Defendants in return for a commission. 9', 'The Plaintiff claimed to have been approached by Mr Berger on or around 15 August 2019 and to have been told by him that he was the representative of various interrelated companies which provided payment processing services. Mr Berger said he could procure one of these entities to provide payment processing services to BHH. 10', 'This arrangement would involve the use of merchant accounts with an acquirer bank in Mexico. 11', 'This Mexican bank was Banco Ahorro Famsa SA 12', '(\u201cFamsa Bank\u201d), and it was used to collect and receive customers\u2019 credit and debit card payments. 13', '11\\u2003On the same day, 15 August 2019, Mr Berger and the Plaintiff\u2019s representative, Ms Vanessa Meza (\u201cMs Meza\u201d, who appears to have gone by the alias \u201cSloane Stone\u201d in all the communications relevant to this suit), held a Skype teleconference in which they discussed and agreed on the terms of the engagement (\u201cthe Payment Processing Agreement\u201d). 14', 'According to the Plaintiff, the essential terms of the Payment Processing Agreement were as follows:', '(a)\\u2003Mr Berger was to procure a company (\u201cthe Processing Entity\u201d) to process payments for and on behalf of the Plaintiff. It was understood by the parties that the identity of the Processing Entity was to be confirmed subsequently.', '(b)\\u2003The processing entity would be responsible for providing the Plaintiff with payment processing services through MIDs which would be made available to the Plaintiff.

This process involved the following:', '12\\u2003The Plaintiff claimed that in reliance on Mr Berger\u2019s representations, the 1st Defendant was engaged as the abovementioned Processing Entity under the Payment Processing Agreement. 16', 'Between 30 August 2019 and 4 February 2020, the 1st Defendant processed payments made by third party customers. 17', '13\\u2003Before the 1st Defendant could begin processing payments on the Plaintiff\u2019s behalf, certain technical details had to be ironed out. Again, Mr Berger had a role to play. On 19 August 2019, Mr Berger provided Ms Meza with the following Uniform Resource Locator (\u201cURL\u201d): \u201cDevcenter.txpmnt.com\u201d and informed her that this was where she could access the Application Programming Interface (\u201cAPI\u201d). The API was a necessary component in order for the Plaintiff to integrate the payment gateway of its principal affiliates with that used by the 1st Defendant. On 21 August 2019, Mr Berger also sent Ms Meza a message in their Skype group chat, forwarding further details such as a hash key and merchant number, which were required to complete the integration process. 18', '14\\u2003On 29 August 2019, Mr Berger introduced Daphne Alfaro (\u201cMs Alfaro\u201d) to the Plaintiff\u2019s representatives via their Skype Group Chat and stated that she would be assisting him. 19', 'On the Plaintiff\u2019s version of events (which the Defendants disputed), Ms Alfaro was at all material times an employee and authorised representative of the 1st Defendant. She was the person in charge of setting up the MIDs and making them available for use by the Plaintiff\u2019s affiliated merchants. She also informed the Plaintiff, on the 1st Defendant\u2019s behalf, of the corresponding descriptors (which were basically a means of identifying all transactions processed through a particular MID). 20', '15\\u2003On 30 April 2019, Ms Alfaro provided Ms Meza with access to a Merchant Control Panel (with the URL \u201cmerchants.txpmnt.com\/Website\/\u201d). 21', 'The Merchant Control Panel had been procured by the 1st Defendant from a third-party vendor and \u201crebranded\u201d to appear as a service offering by the 1st Defendant. In particular, the Plaintiff claimed that the Merchant Control Panel bore features indicating that it was the 1st Defendant\u2019s platform: specifically, its URL and the fact that it showed the 1st Defendant\u2019s sailboat emblem on its web interface.', '16\\u2003On Mr Berger\u2019s instructions, Ms Alfaro set up the following MIDs for the Plaintiff:', '(a)\\u2003The PeakPay MID was set up and payment processing commenced through it on 30 August 2019. Payments channelled through the PeakPay MID initially bore the descriptor \u201cFEE%2AMHSERVICE\u201d. Shortly after the Plaintiff had begun to channel payments through the PeakPay MID, Ms Alfaro informed Ms Meza on 31 August 2019 via Skype group chat that a new descriptor, \u201cFEE*GERSON HDZ MARTINE\u201d would be used. 22', '(b)\\u2003The House MID was set up and payment processing commenced through it on 3 September 2019. Payments processed through this MID bore the following descriptors: \u201cFEE%2AMHSERVICE\u201d, \u201cFEE%2AMHSERVI\u201d or \u201cFEE*MHSERVI\u201d. 23', '(c)\\u2003The IPTV MID was set up and payment processing commenced through it on 28 November 2019. There was, however, a hiccup. Mr Berger informed Ms Meza that the IPTV MID was disabled on or around 7 December 2019 and that he was trying to find a solution. 24', 'A few days later, on or around 13 December 2019, Mr Berger informed the Plaintiff\u2019s representatives that the Plaintiff could resume channelling payments through the IPTV MID, and payments through this MID would bear the descriptor \u201cconnectapp*IPTV\u201d. 25', '17\\u2003Mr Berger, Ms Alfaro and Ms Meza communicated mainly via Skype Group Chat. In between setting up the various MIDs, on 27 September 2019, Ms Alfaro added two individuals, Elliot and Mario Alvarez, to their Skype Group Chat and stated that they would be assisting her. The Plaintiff claimed that both Mario Alvarez and Elliot were employees and\/or representatives of the 1st Defendant at the material time (though the Defendants denied this).', '18\\u2003Ms Alfaro oversaw the payment processing on the 1st Defendant\u2019s behalf. To that end, she had access to the backend of the 1st Defendant\u2019s payment processing gateway and system. 26', 'The Plaintiff cited two examples of the control exerted by Ms Alfaro over the payment processing system. First, when Ms Meza highlighted that there were technical issues relating to payments which were being processed via the PeakPay MID, Mr Berger directed the issue to Ms Alfaro who proceeded to follow up and to resolve it. Second, when Mr Berger requested that Ms Alfaro increase the processing capacity for the PeakPay and House MIDs to USD 1m per month, Ms Alfaro confirmed a mere three minutes later that this had been done. 27', '19\\u2003Apart from the 1st Defendant, there were other entities involved in the process which had been set up to facilitate the processing of payments on the Plaintiff\u2019s behalf. According to the Plaintiff, the 1st Defendant used the sub-processing agents Feenicia and ConectApp when processing payments for the Plaintiff through the PeakPay MID, the House MID and the IPTV MID. 28', 'Payments made by customers were processed by the 1st Defendant in the following manner:', '(a)\\u2003The electronic gateway (ie, API) of the Plaintiff\u2019s principal affiliates was integrated with that used by the 1st Defendant.', '(b)\\u2003Credit and debit card payments made by customers were transmitted through these integrated gateways to merchant accounts maintained by the sub-processing agents engaged by the 1st Defendant, Feenecia and ConectApp.', '(c)\\u2003The settlement proceeds would be remitted by the acquirer bank either directly to the 1st Defendant, or to the sub-processing agents engaged by the 1st Defendant who would then remit these sums to the 1st Defendant.', '(d)\\u2003The 1st Defendant was responsible for ensuring that the nett settlement proceeds (less any fees or charges due to them) were remitted to the Plaintiff\u2019s bank account, the details of which were provided to Mr Berger in an email dated 5 September 2019. 29', '20\\u2003The Plaintiff received its weekly settlement payments in respect of the PeakPay and House MIDs from a remittance company called WorldFirst Singapore (\u201cWorldFirst\u201d), which made these remittances on the 1st Defendant\u2019s behalf. The Plaintiff received 38 settlement payments from WorldFirst between 12 September 2019 to 6 January 2020. 30', '21\\u2003The Plaintiff claimed that the Processing Entity under the Payment Processing Agreement was indeed the 1st Defendant because the latter was mainly responsible for carrying out the payment processing services \u2013 and also because of various representations which the 1st Defendant allegedly made. 31', '22\\u2003According to the Plaintiff, from as early as 12 September 2019, the 1st Defendant began making late and deficient settlement payments in respect of the PeakPay and the House MIDs. When confronted about this, Mr Berger and Ms Alfaro gave several reasons for the delay and shortfall in payments. Amongst other things, they told the Plaintiff that the payment might not have reached the Plaintiff\u2019s bank account, and that the settlement reports had not been accurately updated. Ms Alfaro also claimed that Famsa Bank had withheld these funds from the 1st Defendant and closed the bank account. 32', 'However, neither Mr Berger, nor Ms Alfaro was able to provide any documentation or details to support their explanations as to why the payments of sums due to the Plaintiff were late.', '23\\u2003On 10 January 2020, Mr Berger sent Ms Meza a report prepared by the 1st Defendant which indicated that it had fallen behind on its payment obligations in respect of the PeakPay and House MIDs to the tune of at least \u20ac821,534.46. 33', 'Ms Meza responded to the email on the same day, seeking clarification as to why these funds had not been paid. When no response was forthcoming from Mr Berger, Ms Meza sent another email on 13 of January 2020. Mr Berger was evasive and said that he would forward Ms Meza\u2019s email to Ms Alfaro. No further details were provided in relation to the missing funds. 34', '24\\u2003A day later, on 14 January 2020, Ms Meza emailed Mr Berger seeking clarification as to when Famsa Bank had closed the 1st Defendant\u2019s merchant account. She requested a copy of the notification from Famsa bank which stated that the account had been closed and inquired when the funds would be released. However, Mr Berger and Ms Alfaro continued to ignore Ms Meza\u2019s requests. 35', 'On 29 January 2020, Ms Meza followed up with another email to Mr Berger, repeating her request for information concerning the Famsa bank account. Mr Berger continued to ignore her emails. Later, on 4 February, the Plaintiff ceased all payment processing through the 1st Defendant. 36', '25\\u2003In its amended Statement of Claim, the Plaintiff pleaded that the total outstanding sum owed to it by the 1st Defendant stood at US$2,680.535.21. This comprised the sum of US$1,735,949.69 which was due in respect of the PeakPay and House MIDs, and the sum of US$944,585.52 which was due in respect of the IPTV MID (the \u201cTrust Monies\u201d). 37', '26\\u2003Concerned as to where its funds had gone, the Plaintiff conducted its own investigations. According to the narrative which the Plaintiff put forward in this suit, it was the 1st Defendant who \u2013 through Mr Berger and Ms Alfaro \u2013 had misappropriated or diverted the funds. 38', 'Based on a company profile search, the Plaintiff learnt that the 2nd Defendant was the sole owner of the 1st Defendant, as well as one of its directors (specifically the Managing Director) and Chief Executive Officer. The Plaintiff claimed that this was bad news for it as it knew the 2nd Defendant to be a fraudster. On the Plaintiff\u2019s telling, the 2nd Defendant had in 2014 utilised an entity known as SecCom or Kreysha to defraud the Plaintiff\u2019s principal affiliate, BetOnline, and had misappropriated some US$1,139,056.45 in a similar fashion. 39', '27\\u2003On the Plaintiff\u2019s version of events, it had once again been defrauded by the 2nd Defendant, who had utilised the 1st Defendant this time as a vehicle to defraud and dishonestly misappropriate or divert monies belonging to the Plaintiff. 40', 'Contrary to Ms Alfaro\u2019s representation that Famsa Bank had withheld the Plaintiff\u2019s payments, the Plaintiff alleged that Famsa Bank had released these payments to Feenicia (one of the sub-processing agents engaged by the 1st Defendant) and that Feenicia had duly transferred the Plaintiff\u2019s funds to the 1st Defendant. 41', 'Instead of transferring these funds to the Plaintiff, the 1st Defendant had squirreled them away. Further, in respect of a portion of the payments amounting to MXN 12,450,876.14 which had been held back by Feenicia as a reserve to settle any disputed payments, chargebacks or fines, this portion of the funds had also been paid by Feenicia into the 1st Defendant\u2019s account with the First Finance International Bank (\u201cFFIB\u201d) on or around 13 April 2020 (\u201cFFIB funds\u201d). Instead of paying the FFIB funds to the Plaintiff, the 2nd Defendant had attempted to have these funds transferred to an account with JP Morgan London, UK which the Plaintiff alleged was his personal bank account. 42', 'The Plaintiff claimed that the FFIB funds were traceable to payments by the third party customers, which had been processed and\/or received by the 1st Defendant for and on behalf of the Plaintiff, and that the Plaintiff therefore had a proprietary interest in these funds. 43', 'Finally, the Plaintiff also alleged that payments channelled through the IPTV MID had been released by the relevant acquirer bank and\/or the sub-processing agent, ConectApp, to the 1st Defendant as well; and that the latter had similarly failed to pay these sums to the Plaintiff. 44', '28\\u2003In contrast, the Defendants took the position that it was Mr Berger who had been the 1st Defendant\u2019s client. The 1st Defendant had provided Mr Berger with remittance services, and allowed him to set up and use its software platform and payment management system. However, it was understood between the Defendants and Mr Berger that he would not transact or make any representation on behalf of the 1st Defendant. To that end, Mr Berger had his own portfolio of clients and managed them on his own. At no point in time did Mr Berger act as the 1st Defendant\u2019s employee or agent. 45', '29\\u2003In 2019, the professional and business relationship between the Defendants and Mr Berger took a turn for the worse: Mr Berger appeared to be plagued by personal issues: he was intoxicated and belligerent when communicating with the Defendants and colleagues, proclaimed he had taken on a mistress, and sent sexually harassing messages to female colleagues. 46', 'At the end of 2019, the 1st Defendant and Mr Berger parted ways professionally. Notwithstanding their professional differences, as Mr Berger was at this point not yet able to continue doing business without the 1st Defendant\u2019s software platform and payment management system, the latter continued to allow him to use the software platform and payment management system. 47', '30\\u2003Despite the 1st Defendant\u2019s goodwill, Mr Berger continued to harass their employees (including the 2nd Defendant). In the aftermath of the breakdown of their professional and business relationship, he even threatened to cause damage to the Defendants. According to the Defendants, they had come to realise that Mr Berger was working in concert with the Plaintiff in this action to cause damage to the Defendants after receiving inter alia text messages from Mr Berger 48', 'demonstrating his possession of information about the present proceedings which he could only have obtained from the Plaintiff. 49', '31\\u2003The Defendants denied that the 1st Defendant had been engaged by the Plaintiff as its payment processing agent or that it had processed on the Plaintiff\u2019s behalf those payments made by third-party customers. They contended that the 1st Defendant was not bound by the acts of Mr Berger insofar as it was alleged that he had acted on the 1st Defendant\u2019s behalf in entering into contracts or in making representations. 50', 'The Defendants further contended that they had no knowledge of, and did not agree to the terms of engagement allegedly discussed via Skype teleconference on 15 August 2019. 51', '32\\u2003The Defendants also took the position that the Plaintiff either knew, or must reasonably have known that Mr Berger was not the 1st Defendant\u2019s authorised representative for the following reasons. First, Mr Berger had not communicated with the Plaintiff using any account or email address belonging to the 1st Defendant. In fact, Mr Berger, who owned an independent business by the name of \u201cMCC Code\u201d, 52', 'would communicate with the Plaintiff through an email address with the domain name \u201cmcccode.com\u201d, and he would also use the MCC Code logo as his profile picture in his communications with the Plaintiff. 53', 'Second, Mr Berger did not purport to be acting on the 1st Defendant\u2019s behalf in his communications with the Plaintiff: that much was clear from the fact that other entities such as \u201cSM Marketing\u201d and \u201cKings Road Capital Corp Private Limited\u201d had been named as the contracting party in the draft contracts which Mr Berger sent to the Plaintiff. 54', 'Third, there was no mention of or reference to the 1st Defendant in any of the terms reached between Mr Berger and the Plaintiff under the alleged Payment Processing Agreement, or in any of the emails, text messages, group chats and draft contracts exchanged between Mr Berger and the Plaintiff. 55', 'Finally, on the Plaintiff\u2019s own case, there was no suggestion that the Plaintiff itself was even aware of the 1st Defendant\u2019s existence and\/or identity when it allegedly entered into the Payment Processing Agreement. 56', '33\\u2003As for Ms Alfaro, the Defendants asserted that she was not an employee and authorised representative of the 1st Defendant at all material times in the dealings with the Plaintiff. Instead, Ms Alfaro was an employee of a different company, SecureTeller, which was owned by her husband, one Oscar Bermuda. SecureTeller had, on previous occasions, provided other services to the 1st Defendant and had done the same in relation to Mr Berger\u2019s dealings with the Plaintiff. 57', 'Insofar as Ms Alfaro had communicated with the Plaintiff, she had done so on Mr Berger\u2019s behalf and not the 1st Defendant. 58', '34\\u2003The Merchant Control Panel was a software procured by the 1st Defendant from a third-party vendor, Coriunder. Mr Berger was the one who had introduced the 1st Defendant to Coriunder. The Merchant Control Panel was a piece of software which enabled merchants to track and view the transactions being processed through MIDs by payment processors on a single webpage \u2013 in other words, an informational tool. The Merchant Control Panel could be provided to the 1st Defendant\u2019s various clients for their use, but ultimately, the 1st Defendant had no control over how their clients actually used it. The Merchant Control Panel which was set up and operated by Mr Berger had the following URL: \u201cmerchants.txpmnt.com\/Website\/\u201d. 59', '35\\u2003In relation to the PeakPay, House and IPTV MIDs, the Defendants claimed that the 1st Defendant was not involved in processing the payments through these MIDs. The 1st Defendant did not own or control any of the merchant accounts or MIDs. Instead, it was Mr Berger who had set up these MIDs \u2013 and he was able to do so because the 1st Defendant had allowed him to set up and use its software platform and payment management system. 60', 'Following from this, insofar as Ms Alfaro appeared to have access to the 1st Defendant\u2019s system, this was premised on the fact that the 1st Defendant had actually granted Mr Berger permission to use their systems. This, however, did not mean that Ms Alfaro was either the 1st Defendant\u2019s employee or representative. The Defendants also asserted that Elliot and Mario Alvarez were not the 1st Defendant\u2019s employees or representatives. 61', '36\\u2003The Defendants gave several explanations as to why it was not responsible for the sums which the Plaintiff alleged had gone missing. First, in relation to the remittances made by WorldFirst to the Plaintiff, the 1st Defendant had acted on Mr Berger\u2019s instructions and made these payments on his behalf. The 1st Defendant had only provided Mr Berger with remittance services at the material time, and this included using WorldFirst\u2019s services to remit funds. 62', '37\\u2003Second, the 1st Defendant denied that it had prepared a report on 10 January 2020 indicating that it had fallen behind on its payment obligations in respect of the PeakPay and House MIDs (see above at [23]). 63', 'The 1st Defendant denied that it was liable to the Plaintiff for the sum of at least \u20ac821,534.46 in respect of the \u201cPeakPay MID\u201d and the \u201cHouse MID\u201d.', '38\\u2003Third, the Defendants denied that the 1st Defendant had received any of the Trust Monies owed to the Plaintiff, or that the 1st Defendant had misappropriated and\/or diverted funds received from Feenicia or ConectApp which were meant for the Plaintiff. 64', 'Specifically, in relation to the FFIB funds, the 1st Defendant had used Feenicia as a sub-processor to process payments made in Mexico on behalf of the 1st Defendant\u2019s own clients (who did not include the Plaintiff). While the 1st Defendant would receive the funds in Mexican Peso (\u201cMXN\u201d), it had to remit the funds to its clients in United States Dollars (\u201cUSD\u201d). 65', 'As part of the sub-processing services provided to the 1st Defendant, Feenicia was entitled to maintain a portion of the processed transactions as a reserve to settle any disputed payments, chargebacks and\/or fines. 66', '39\\u2003In or around April 2020, Feenicia was obliged to release these reserves to the 1st Defendant in respect of transactions processed for the 1st Defendant\u2019s clients. To mitigate against currency exchange loss, given that the MXN had devalued against the USD in or around March 2020, the 1st Defendant directed Feenicia to transfer the reserves to an account with FFIB. This was done to take advantage of FFIB\u2019s offer of a USD loan using the received MXN as collateral. The 1st Defendant could then use the USD loan to fulfil its obligations to its clients and vendors, and repay the loan when MXN increased in value. 67', '40\\u2003After FFIB received the funds from Feenicia, the 1st Defendant discovered that FFIB was in fact unwilling to extend the USD loan. Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC (\u201cMorgan Stanley\u201d), with which the 2nd Defendant had an account at the material time, indicated its willingness to grant the 1st Defendant such a loan to hedge against currency exchange fluctuations between the MXN and USD. As such, the 1st Defendant instructed FFIB to transfer the same funds to Morgan Stanley. Instead of doing so, however, FFIB froze the FFIB funds, claiming that it had received a complaint against the 1st Defendant regarding the source of the funds, and that it needed to investigate . 68', '41\\u2003In the circumstances, the Defendants denied that the FFIB funds were traceable to payments from the Plaintiff\u2019s third-party customers which had been processed and\/or received by the 1st Defendant for and on behalf of the Plaintiff. The Defendants also denied that the Plaintiff had a proprietary interest in these funds. 69'"}

A directors\u2019 meeting was held on 20 July 2016. At the meeting, Ms Seet resigned by way of letter as director of LA with immediate effect and provided one month\u2019s notice of LogicMills\u2019 intention to terminate the SHA. Mr Low\u2019s solicitors then issued a letter dated 14 September 2016 (the \u201c14 September 2016 Letter\u201d) 24', 'to LogicMills seeking reimbursement of sums loaned or advance by Mr Low on behalf of LogicMills, as well as giving LogicMills seven days to furnish a letter of proof of MOE certification, endorsement or validation of the curriculum of LogicMills and subsequently, LA. 25', '15\\u2003 Mr Low claims that the parents of students enrolled in LA pulled their children out of LA\u2019s programmes, and he had to suspend LA\u2019s operations in or around December 2016. 26', 'The defendants aver that there is no written evidence of any child being pulled out of LA for any reason related to its offerings not being MOE-validated. 27', '16\\u2003It is undisputed that on 20 July 2016, Ms Seet resigned as director of LA and provided notice of LogicMills\u2019 intention to terminate the SHA. 28', 'Mr Low suspended LA\u2019s operations in or around December 2016. 29'"}
{"casename":"2023_SGHC_125","fact":"'4\\u2003The relevant background facts centre around three documents: (a) a Sale and Purchase Agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) in respect of the Property; (b) a Power of Attorney (the \u201cPOA\u201d); and (c) the Caveat. In short, the Agreement and the POA form the basis for the claimant\u2019s claim against the defendant in OC 138, which in turn explains the context for which the Caveat was lodged.', '5\\u2003I turn first to the Agreement. On or about 12 October 2015, the claimant and the defendant entered into the Agreement. The defendant acted through her trustee, Mr Rajesh Bothra (\u201cMr Bothra\u201d), who is her father. This was because the defendant was not yet at the age of majority at that time. Pursuant to the Agreement, the claimant agreed to sell the Property to the defendant for the total price of $4m (the \u201cPurchase Price\u201d), with an additional stamp duty of $160,000. The Agreement was duly executed by the claimant and Mr Bothra. Clause 3 of the Agreement provided that the sale was to be completed on 31 March 2016 or any such mutually agreed date between the parties.', '6\\u2003On 2 July 2016, the title to the Property was eventually transferred to Ms Bothra but without the Purchase Price being paid. The claimant explained that, notwithstanding this transfer, she expected to be paid the Purchase Price in due course. She had allowed the transfer to take place before being paid because of the close relationship between the parties at the time. The claimant\u2019s position during the hearing was that she has yet to receive full payment of the Purchase Price. This formed the basis for her lodgement of the Caveat as an unpaid vendor.', '7\\u2003I turn next to the POA. Subsequently, through a POA dated 8 March 2019, the defendant appointed Mr Mishra as her Attorney in Singapore. The POA specified, among others, that Mr Mishra was appointed as the defendant\u2019s true and lawful Attorney to act in, conduct, and manage all her affairs, including but not limited to the Property. More specifically, pursuant to the POA, the defendant conferred broad powers and authority on Mr Mishra to deal with, lease, market, and\/or sell the Property. The defendant also empowered Mr Mishra to see to the upkeep and maintenance of the Property, and to do all things in relation to it, for which he would be indemnified.', '8\\u2003Pursuant to the powers conferred on him in the POA, Mr Mishra managed the Property on behalf of the defendant from 8 March 2019 to 20 January 2023. The latter date was when the defendant revoked the POA. During the period that Mr Mishra was managing the Property, he and his nominees incurred various expenses in relation to the Property. Further, from around 2021 onwards, Mr Mishra also marketed the Property for sale. Eventually, he concluded an arms-length sale of the Property. Pursuant to this sale, an Option to Purchase the Property was executed on 8 July 2022. The Property was to be sold for $7.4m, and the completion date was to be 3 March 2023.', '9\\u2003As I have mentioned above, the Agreement and the POA provided the background against which the claimant and Mr Mishra commenced OC 138 against the defendant, in which the claimant claims the Balance Sum of $626,422, plus interest and costs pursuant to the Agreement. Additionally, in that action, Mr Mishra also claims $444,311, plus interests and costs pursuant to the POA, which he says is the total sum for which he is entitled to be indemnified by the defendant.', '10\\u2003In the period leading to the commencement of OC 138, the claimant lodged the Caveat on 14 February 2023 in respect of her claim for the Balance Sum. More specifically, she did this because she suspected that the defendant did not intend to honour her obligation to pay the Balance Sum. Further, because the defendant and her family are presently outside of Singapore, the claimant was concerned that the proceeds from the latest sale of the Property would be moved out of the jurisdiction. This concern was especially pertinent since Mr Bothra had been declared a bankrupt.', '11\\u2003After the Caveat was lodged, the parties\u2019 solicitors exchanged correspondence in relation to their dispute. On 23 February 2023, the defendant filed the Cancellation Application. By a notice pursuant to s 127(2) of the LTA dated 27 February 2023 (\u201cthe Notice\u201d), the Registrar of Titles (\u201cthe Registrar\u201d) notified the claimant that the Caveat will be cancelled on 31 March 2023 unless an order of court to the contrary was served on the Registrar before then. The claimant therefore brought the present application in her own name on an expedited basis for either the Caveat to be maintained, or for the Balance Sum to be paid into court. Because only the claimant (and not Mr Mishra) was involved in the present case, the POA was not directly relevant to the claimant\u2019s justification of the Caveat.'"}
{"casename":"2023_SGHC_126","fact":"'4\\u2003I begin with the relevant background facts. The claimants are husband and wife. Together, they have three adult children. The second of their children is their son, Mr Cheong Jen-Ghis (\u201cCJG\u201d). The defendant is CJG\u2019s wife. This therefore makes the defendant the claimants\u2019 daughter-in-law. CJG is a medical doctor who is based in Australia. The defendant runs various businesses, including an online business selling honey products called \u201cHoneySpree\u201d. CJG and the defendant commenced divorce proceedings in September 2022.', '5\\u2003The claimants purchased the Property that is the subject of the present case in 2009. The claimants did so for investment reasons. As such, the Property has been rented out since the time it was purchased. The claimants in turn reside in a HDB flat in Bishan. They are the only occupants of this flat because all of their children have moved out after their respective marriages.', '6\\u2003In 2022, the claimants decided to sell the Property to fund their retirement. Thus, on 9 October 2022, the claimants granted an Option to Purchase (\u201cOTP\u201d) to Chin Fook Chink and Emily Tan Hwee Leng (\u201cthe Purchasers\u201d) to purchase the Property at $1,280,000. Following the grant of the OTP, the Purchasers accepted and exercised the OTP on 15 February 2023.', '7\\u2003It was through this process that the claimants found out that the defendant had lodged two caveats against the Property. After they had granted the OTP, the claimants found out from their conveyancing solicitors on 6 January 2023 that the defendant had lodged Caveat No IH\/666407A against the Property on 7 December 2022 (\u201cthe First Caveat\u201d). The First Caveat stated as follows:', '8\\u2003The claimants were then advised by their conveyancing solicitors that they would not be able to complete the sale and purchase of the Property unless the First Caveat was cancelled or withdrawn. The claimants therefore instructed their conveyancing solicitors to make an application to the Registrar pursuant to s 127(2) of the LTA (\u201cs 127(2)\u201d) for the First Caveat to be cancelled. The Registrar issued a notice dated 11 January 2023 (\u201cthe Notice\u201d) to the defendant, informing her that the First Caveat shall be cancelled unless she obtained a court order to the contrary by 15 February 2023. The defendant did not obtain such a court order by the deadline, nor did she respond to the Notice in any other way. As a result, the First Caveat was cancelled by the Registrar on 15 February 2023.', '9\\u2003Despite being notified that the First Caveat would lapse by 15 February 2023, the defendant lodged another caveat (ie, the Second Caveat) against the Property on 7 February 2023. The claimants were notified of the Second Caveat by a notice from the Registrar dated 11 February 2023. The grounds of claim in the Second Caveat were substantially similar to those in respect of the First Caveat:', '10\\u2003The claimants therefore brought the present application for relief against the defendant in respect of the Second Caveat. In this regard, the parties advanced different accounts as to the defendant\u2019s right to lodge the Second Caveat. I will deal with these accounts below.'"}

Mr Tay has never been involved in the day-to-day management of the first plaintiff or of the Group.', '19\\u2003The defendant played an anomalous role in the management of the first plaintiff and the Group. The role he played did not arise from any formal appointment. Instead, his role arose from the unique interpersonal working dynamic between the defendant on the one hand and Mr Siong and Mr Ching on the other.', '20\\u2003It is clear from the evidence that, at all material times and at a very high level, the defendant exercised ultimate management control over the first plaintiff and the Group. This was the position from the outset, ie, from the time the first plaintiff was incorporated in 2005, and well before the defendant was appointed a director of the first plaintiff for the first time in June 2018. It stopped only when disputes arose between the first plaintiff\u2019s four major shareholders in July 2019. The defendant was able to arrogate this role to himself, not through any appointment to any office or any right under any contract, but through the sheer force of his own personality combined with Mr Siong\u2019s and Mr Ching\u2019s deference and acquiescence.', '21\\u2003From the first plaintiff\u2019s incorporation in 2005 until disputes arose between the four major shareholders in 2019, the defendant styled himself internally and held himself out externally as the Chairman of the first plaintiff and of the Group. 23', 'He adopted this title even though the first plaintiff had never conferred it upon him and even when he was not a director of the first plaintiff.', '22\\u2003From 2005 until 2019, the defendant instructed and ordered Mr Siong and Mr Ching as to how to manage the business of first plaintiff and of the Group in terms of overall direction and strategy. 24', 'He felt entitled to take this approach because of his seniority (both in age and in experience in the packaging business), his working relationship with Mr Siong and Mr Ching as his subordinates in their previous employment, and because he considered himself, through Caldicott, to be the single largest shareholder in the first plaintiff. He even threatened to remove Mr Siong and Mr Ching as directors of the first plaintiff if they disobeyed his instructions and orders. 25', '23\\u2003Mr Siong and Mr Ching perceived the defendant\u2019s conduct as domineering and oppressive. Despite this, they did not oppose him. They simply did his bidding. 26', 'They accepted and acquiesced in his exercise of ultimate management control without question. 27', 'They did so out of deference to the defendant, out of a desire to avoid conflict with the defendant and out of a real fear that the defendant would persuade Mr Tay to vote together with him to remove them as directors of the first plaintiff. 28', '24\\u2003It was against the background of this interpersonal working dynamic that, in late 2017, the defendant told Mr Siong, Mr Ching and Mr Tay that the Group should invest in a new sheet board plant in the PRC. 29', 'An investment in a sheet board plant was a departure from the Group\u2019s existing business, which was in box plants only. 30', 'It is common ground that there is a material difference between a box plant and a sheet board plant, between the business models of the two types of plant and between the management considerations involved in setting up and running both types of plant. 31', '25\\u2003The investment in a sheet board plant was discussed at meetings held in February 2018 in Dongguan (\u201cthe February 2018 Meeting\u201d) and April 2018 in Singapore (\u201cthe April 2018 Meeting\u201d). 32', 'A key issue in contention between the parties is the nature and outcome of these meetings. In particular, it is hotly contested whether these meetings sufficed, both in fact and in law, to approve the steps that the defendant took to set up a sheet board plant.', '26\\u2003The defendant took three such steps between August 2018 and January 2019.', '27\\u2003First, in August 2018, the defendant caused AMBDG to incorporate two wholly owned subsidiaries in the PRC: 33', '(a) the second plaintiff; and (b) a company known as Huizhou Shengjia Industry Co.

Huizhou SJ was to be the automation company for a sheet board plant.', '28\\u2003Second, in September 2018, the defendant caused AMBDG to purchase equipment for a sheet board plant. AMBDG thus entered into a contract with BHS Corrugated Machinery (Shanghai) Co.

He was additionally a member of the Seagate committee which oversaw two tenders for the provision of transportation services to ferry Seagate\u2019s goods in China in 2006 and 2009 (\u201cthe 2006 Tender\u201d and \u201cthe 2009 Tender\u201d respectively). 5', '8\\u2003Three trucking routes were the subject of the 2006 Tender. Broadly, the first route (\u201cGroup 1 Route\u201d) was awarded to Shanghai Long-Distance Transportation Co (\u201cSLT\u201d) and China Shipping Air Cargo Co Ltd. The second route (\u201cGroup 2 Route\u201d) was awarded to SLT and the third (\u201cGroup 3 Route\u201d), to Feili International Transport Co Ltd (\u201cFeili\u201d). 6', '9\\u2003The award of these three routes was effected via three contracts dated 1 December 2006, viz, the Seagate Technology\/Shanghai Long-Distance Transportation Co Logistics Services Provider Agreement, the Maxtor Technology (Suzhou) Co Ltd\/Shanghai Long-Distance Transportation Co Logistics Services Provider Agreement and the Seagate Technology\/Feili International Transport Co Ltd Logistics Services Provider Agreement (\u201cthe 2006 Tender Contracts\u201d). The 2006 Tender Contracts spanned 24 months with the option of a one-year extension. They were extended for one year on 1 December 2008 and an additional two months on 1 December 2009. 7', '10\\u2003Next, in September 2009, Seagate held the 2009 Tender. This similarly involved the provision of transportation services for three trucking routes. One route was awarded to SLT (\u201cGroup B Route\u201d) while the remaining two were awarded to Feili (\u201cGroup A and C Routes\u201d). Again, Seagate entered into individual contracts with SLT and Feili to give effect to the results of the 2009 Tender (\u201cthe 2009 Tender Contracts\u201d). The 2009 Tender Contracts were effective between 1 February 2010 and 31 January 2013 but were terminated sometime in 2012 when Henry was investigated for offences under the PCA. 8', '11\\u2003Between April 2007 and November 2010, SLT and Feili paid moneys into a Bank of China (\u201cBOC\u201d) bank account that belonged to Joseph (\u201cJoseph\u2019s BOC Account\u201d). One Gu Meihua made 25 payments aggregating RMB1,877,135 to Joseph\u2019s BOC Account between 6 April 2007 and 20 October 2009 on behalf of SLT while one Gu Honghua made 25 payments aggregating RMB9,491,890.44 to Joseph\u2019s BOC Account between 21 November 2008 and 19 November 2010 on behalf of Feili. A breakdown of these 50 payments is set out in Annex A.', '12\\u2003SLT and Feili paid these moneys into Joseph\u2019s BOC Account pursuant to agreements they individually signed with Twin Palms in October 2006 (\u201cthe Agreements\u201d). The Agreements broadly stipulated that in consideration of Joseph assisting SLT and Feili to secure contracts for the provision of trucking services with Seagate, SLT and Feili would pay Twin Palms 10% of the invoice value of these trucking services. 9', 'Henry drafted the Agreements 10', 'while Judy helped to secure the signatures of SLT and Feili\u2019s representatives. 11', '13\\u2003The Prosecution\u2019s case was that Henry and Judy conspired to corruptly enrich themselves via the 2006 and 2009 Tender Contracts. Pursuant to this conspiracy, Henry provided Judy with Seagate\u2019s confidential information that he acquired by virtue of his positions as Senior Director of Logistics and member of the 2006 and 2009 Tender committees. Judy in turn utilised this information to assist SLT and Feili to successfully secure the 2006 and 2009 Tender Contracts. 12', '14\\u2003Following from the above, the Agreements were shams and concealed the true state of affairs between Henry and Judy on one hand and SLT and Feili on the other. The moneys SLT and Feili transferred to Joseph\u2019s BOC Account were not payments for Joseph helping SLT and Feili secure the 2006 and 2009 Tender Contracts but bribes for the confidential information Judy provided to SLT and Feili. 13', '15\\u2003Henry and Judy used Joseph as a conduit for Judy to receive bribes from SLT and Feili. At all material times, Judy had control of Joseph\u2019s BOC Account. She was able to withdraw moneys from Joseph\u2019s BOC Account using the corresponding ATM card and Joseph\u2019s passbook. In this manner, Judy transferred moneys from Joseph\u2019s BOC Account into her own BOC account (\u201cJudy\u2019s BOC Account\u201d). 14', '16\\u2003Separately, sometime on or before July 2009, Henry conspired with Judy to withdraw S$703,480 (which constituted bribe moneys) from Judy\u2019s BOC Account to fund the purchase of a condominium unit in Singapore (\u201cthe Property\u201d). Henry utilised Judy\u2019s ATM card to withdraw the said sum from Judy\u2019s BOC Account and deposited these moneys into his personal accounts between July 2009 and September 2010. The Property was purchased in Judy\u2019s name in 2012. 15', 'This formed the subject matter of the CDSA Charge.', '17\\u2003The Prosecution\u2019s case largely rested on the following:', '(a)\\u2003Four investigative statements recorded from Henry under s 22 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (\u201c1985 CPC\u201d) on 1 December 2010 at about 4.20pm (\u201cP38\u201d), 2 December 2010 at about 11.54am (\u201cP39\u201d), 6 December 2010 at about 7.04pm (\u201cP44\u201d) and 9 December 2010 at about 3.00pm (\u201cP45\u201d). 16', '(b)\\u2003Three investigative statements recorded from Henry under s 22 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (\u201c2012 CPC\u201d) on 27 April 2015 at about 2.15pm (\u201cP43\u201d), 17 April 2015 at about 2.40pm (\u201cP42\u201d) and 2 November 2016 at about 10.15am (\u201cP102\u201d). 17', '(c)\\u2003Four investigative statements recorded from Judy under s 22 of the 2012 CPC on 5 January 2011 at about 3.10pm (\u201cP47\u201d), 12 January 2011 at about 3.18pm (\u201cP48\u201d), 24 August 2016 at about 10.00am (\u201cP100\u201d) and 24 August 2016 at about 3.45pm (\u201cP101\u201d). 18', '(d)\\u2003Emails Henry and Judy exchanged between 29 August 2005 and 17 September 2006 (\u201cthe Emails\u201d). 19', '(e)\\u2003Bank statements from the BOC, Shanghai Branch (\u201cBOC Statements\u201d). 20', '(f)\\u2003Statements recorded from Hu Zhiquan (\u201cHu\u201d) and Jiang Hong (\u201cJiang\u201d), representatives of SLT, by Shanghai Zhabei District People\u2019s Procuratorate (\u201cSLT Statements\u201d). 21', '18\\u2003The Defence contended that the DJ had no jurisdiction to try the PCA Charges in so far as Henry\u2019s acts of abetment as well as Judy\u2019s receipt of the moneys subject of the PCA Charges occurred outside Singapore. It followed that the sum subject of the CDSA Charge was not \u201cbenefits of criminal conduct\u201d within the meaning of s 44(1)(a) of the CDSA and the CDSA Charge was similarly not made out. 22', '19\\u2003Additionally, the Defence submitted that: (a) P38 was involuntarily provided and recorded under oppressive circumstances; (b) the affidavits of Joseph and Feili\u2019s employee, Chen Ming-Chieh Simon (\u201cSimon\u201d) \u2013 two persons who did not testify at the trial \u2013 ought to be admitted under s 32(1)(j) of the EA; and (c) the documents the Prosecution obtained pursuant to a request made under the MACMA, namely the BOC Statements and the SLT Statements, were inadmissible as they had not been authenticated under ss 8(3) and 42(3) of the MACMA or alternatively, should be excluded under s 32(3) of the EA. 23', '20\\u2003 Once the evidential matrix was properly ascertained, the Defence submitted that the information Henry conveyed to Judy could not be said to be confidential. Likewise, there was no conspiracy between Henry and Judy to corruptly receive gratification from SLT and Feili; any moneys SLT and Feili paid to Joseph\u2019s BOC Account constituted remuneration for Twin Palms referring businesses to SLT and Feili. Thus, the sum subject of the CDSA Charge was not bribe moneys nor Judy\u2019s benefits from her criminal conduct. Rather, they stemmed from the monthly salary Judy received from Twin Palms and her own savings.', '21\\u2003In support of the aforesaid, the Defence, inter alia, pointed to the fact that Henry and Judy discussed their plans to set up a company providing trucking services in China in the Emails before the 2006 Tender was first mooted in August 2006, Henry did not have the authority to unilaterally determine the award of the 2006 and 2009 Tenders, and the moneys paid into Joseph\u2019s BOC Account did not correspond to 10% of the value of services SLT and Feili provided Seagate. 24', '22\\u2003The Defence further sought to rely on Henry and Judy\u2019s cautioned statements recorded under s 23 of the 2012 CPC. Two cautioned statements were recorded from Henry on 27 June 2017 at 10.30am (\u201cD12\u201d) and 12.10pm (\u201cD13\u201d) respectively. Similarly, Judy provided two cautioned statements on 27 June 2017 at 10.53am (\u201cD18\u201d) and 12.07pm (\u201cD19\u201d). 25', '23\\u2003The DJ\u2019s full grounds of decision are set out in Public Prosecutor v Teo Chu Ha @ Henry Teo and another [2021] SGDC 196.', '24\\u2003Preliminarily, the DJ held that the District Court had jurisdiction to try the PCA and CDSA Charges. Henry sent confidential information belonging to Seagate to Judy and withdrew the moneys subject of the CDSA Charge while he was in Singapore. Even if Henry had performed these acts outside Singapore, s 37(1) of the PCA provided that the provisions of the PCA had extra-territorial application over Singaporean citizens. 26', 'In this vein, there was no basis to interpret s 37(1) of the PCA as a provision conditioned by s 108B of the Penal Code, such that any conduct abetted must be committed in Singapore. There is nothing in the PCA that suggested s 37(1) of the PCA should be so interpreted and the Defence\u2019s proposed interpretation would neuter the legislative intent animating s 37(1) of the PCA. 27', '25\\u2003The DJ next found that Henry provided P38 voluntarily without any threat, inducement or promise and in the absence of oppressive circumstances. In so far as neither Henry nor Judy challenged this finding on appeal, it suffices to note that the DJ placed emphasis on the fact that Henry did not raise any complaints during the recording of the statement, made a significant number of amendments that were inconsistent with his claim to have been unable to concentrate while providing the statement, lied in asserting that Sathiabalan s\/o M Veerapillai (\u201cSathia\u201d) acted aggressively towards him during the recording of P38 given that Sathia was not even present during this time, and chose not to make any amendments to the statement when he was accorded the opportunity to do so the following day. 28', '26\\u2003In relation to the BOC Statements, the DJ held that they were admissible under s 8(3) of the MACMA read with s 32(1)(b)(iv) of the EA. These documents were obtained via a formal inter-State request made under the MACMA, were duly authenticated and formed part of the records of a business that was kept by the BOC. Whilst the BOC Statements disclosed both missing and illegible pages, this did not justify exclusion under s 32(3) of the EA. At best, the missing and unreadable pages affected the evidential weight to be placed on the documents. 29', '27\\u2003The DJ likewise found that the SLT Statements were admissible under s 8(3) of the MLA read with s 32(1)(j)(iii) of the EA. He accepted that Hu and Jiang were outside Singapore and officers from the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (\u201cCPIB\u201d) had taken all reasonable steps to procure their attendance at trial. Pertinently, CPIB officers had sought the assistance of the Chinese authorities to contact Hu and Jiang and also attempted to directly contact Hu and Jiang via phone and email to no avail. 30', '28\\u2003Relatedly, the DJ held that Joseph\u2019s affidavit was admissible under s 32(1)(j)(iii), but not ss 32(1)(j)(i) or 32(1)(j)(iv) of the EA. He found that Joseph was outside Singapore and the Defence had shown it had taken all reasonable steps to persuade Joseph to attend the trial. These included Judy and the Defence counsel\u2019s attempts to contact Joseph via phone and email respectively. In the latter regard, Ong had replied to these emails and indicated that he was unable to testify at the trial. 31', 'Nothing in this appeal turns on the DJ\u2019s finding that Joseph\u2019s affidavit was inadmissible under ss 32(1)(j)(i) or 32(1)(j)(iv) of the EA.', '29\\u2003Contrastingly, the DJ declined to admit Simon\u2019s affidavit into evidence under ss 32(1)(j)(iii) and 32(1)(j)(iv) of the EA. Whilst Simon was outside Singapore, the Defence had failed to demonstrate that it was not practicable to secure his attendance at the trial. Judy had never informed Simon of the trial dates nor served him a subpoena. The Defence had also failed to prove that Simon was a competent but non-compellable witness within the meaning of s 32(1)(j)(iv) of the EA. In any event, the DJ considered that Simon deliberately avoided coming to Singapore and would have excluded his affidavit under s 32(3) of the EA. 32', '30\\u2003Turning to the PCA Charges, the DJ identified the following factual and legal issues for his determination: 33', '(a)\\u2003Whether there was a conspiracy between Henry and Judy for Judy to corruptly receive gratification from SLT and Feili.', '(b)\\u2003Whether the information Henry sent to Judy constituted confidential information.', '(c)\\u2003Whether Judy provided SLT and Feili with confidential information.', '(d)\\u2003Whether the moneys SLT and Feili paid to Joseph\u2019s BOC Account were for legitimate business services rendered by Twin Palms.', '(e)\\u2003Whether Judy received gratification as a reward for assisting SLT and Feili secure the 2006 and 2009 Tender Contracts through the provision of confidential information.', '(f)\\u2003Whether the elements of the PCA Charges, including whether there was an objectively corrupt element and guilty knowledge, were established.', '31\\u2003He found that the Prosecution had proved all the elements of the PCA Charges beyond a reasonable doubt and convicted Henry and Judy on the PCA Charges:', '(a)\\u2003To begin, the conspiracy between Henry and Judy for Judy to corruptly receive gratification from SLT and Feili was supported by the Emails, P38, P47 and P48. The Emails evinced that Henry and Judy initially planned to set up a company to obtain business from Seagate (and for Judy to represent and conceal Henry\u2019s interest in the company) but later discussed using an existing company and a General Sales Agent to obtain commissions for any business deals between Seagate and third parties they successfully facilitated. As for P38, P47 and P48, these illustrated, inter alia, that Henry suggested to Judy that they should enter a General Sales Agreement (\u201cGSA\u201d) with SLT and Feili to ensure that Henry and Judy would receive 10% of the value of contracts SLT and Feili successfully entered into with Seagate. 34', '(b)\\u2003The information Henry sent to Judy, which included the prices Seagate paid its suppliers for various trucking routes, constituted confidential information. This was supported by the testimony of Seagate\u2019s employees and the Emails in which Henry informed Judy that it was imperative for her to keep said information confidential. 35', '(c)\\u2003That Judy in turn conveyed the confidential information to SLT and Feili was evinced by emails Judy sent to Simon and Joseph, her admissions in P101 and the fact that the information SLT and Feili eventually submitted to Seagate in connection with the 2006 and 2009 Tenders mirrored the information Henry provided to Judy. 36', '(d)\\u2003 Whilst Henry and Judy contended that the moneys subject of the Charges were for legitimate business services rendered by Twin Palms, this flew in the face of emails illustrating that Henry and Judy intended for Twin Palms to be a mere conduit in their corrupt scheme, Henry\u2019s admission in P38 that he had to use proxies to prevent SLT, Feili and Seagate from discovering that he was helping SLT and Feili clinch trucking contracts with Seagate behind the scenes, and that the Defence provided no explanation for why Henry drafted the GSA between Twin Palms and Feili or why the moneys were paid into Joseph\u2019s BOC Account. 37', 'The DJ thus found that SLT and Feili paid the moneys subject of the Charges in consideration of the confidential information Judy provided them.', '(e)\\u2003Going one step further, the DJ was satisfied that the moneys SLT and Feili paid into Joseph\u2019s BOC Account were in substance paid to Judy (in contradistinction to Joseph and Twin Palms). Notably, Hu and Jiang both stated that the commissions were paid to Judy and Judy herself admitted that she had control over Joseph\u2019s BOC Account and could withdraw the moneys within as she desired. 38', '(f)\\u2003It followed that the moneys paid to Judy via Joseph\u2019s BOC Account was Judy\u2019s reward for assisting SLT and Feili successfully secure the 2006 and 2009 Tender Contracts. Judy herself acknowledged the quid pro quo nature of the arrangement in P100. 39', '(g)\\u2003Considering Henry and Judy\u2019s intentions underlying their receipt of the moneys from SLT and Feili, the transactions were tainted with an objectively corrupt element. 40', 'Indeed, given that both individuals knew that it was wrong for Henry to disclose Seagate\u2019s confidential information to Judy to assist SLT and Feili secure the 2006 and 2009 Tender Contracts and thus went to great lengths to conceal Henry\u2019s involvement in Judy\u2019s dealings with SLT and Feili, Henry and Judy knew that what they did was corrupt by ordinary and objective standards. 41', '32\\u2003With regard to the CDSA Charge, this necessitated consideration of the following issues: 42', '(a)\\u2003Whether the scope of ss 44(1)(a) and 44(5)(a) of the CDSA is limited to secondary offenders and whether Henry and Judy constitute primary or secondary offenders.', '(b)\\u2003Whether Henry and Judy conspired for Judy to corruptly receive gratification for herself.', '(c)\\u2003Whether the moneys Henry withdrew from Judy\u2019s BOC Account represented benefits of criminal conduct.', '(d)\\u2003Whether Henry and Judy knew that Judy was a person who engaged in criminal conduct and that their arrangement would facilitate the control of Judy\u2019s benefits of criminal conduct.', '33\\u2003The DJ was similarly satisfied that the Prosecution had proved all the elements of the CDSA Charge beyond a reasonable doubt:', '(a)\\u2003He rejected the Defence\u2019s contention that the logic of Yap Chen Hsiang Osborn v Public Prosecutor [2019] 2 SLR 319 (\u201cOsborn Yap\u201d) \u2013 namely that s 47(1) of the CDSA did not cover a secondary offender who does not himself commit the offence from which the proceeds were originally derived but launders the proceeds of another person\u2019s crime \u2013 applied with equal force to s 44 of the CDSA such that the latter provision only governed secondary offenders. In the DJ\u2019s view, s 44(1)(a) of the CDSA \u201ccontemplates an arrangement between a primary offender and a secondary offender\u201d. Given that the gratifications were received by Judy, Judy was a primary offender and Henry was a secondary offender in respect of the CDSA Charge. 43', '(b)\\u2003Henry and Judy conspired to be in an arrangement which facilitated the control of Judy\u2019s benefits of criminal conduct on behalf of Judy. Notably, the PCA Charges against Judy had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. 44', '(c)\\u2003The moneys Henry withdrew from Judy\u2019s BOC Account represented benefits of criminal conduct. In P100, Judy admitted that she would transfer the moneys SLT and Feili deposited into Joseph\u2019s BOC Account to Judy\u2019s BOC Account. Whilst she claimed that some of the moneys which Henry withdrew from Judy\u2019s BOC Account did not stem from SLT or Feili, she conceded that this sum of moneys \u201cshould not be very huge\u201d. 45', '(d)\\u2003Finally, Henry and Judy knew that Judy was a person who engaged in criminal conduct and their arrangement would facilitate the control of Judy\u2019s benefits of criminal conduct. Henry and Judy conspired for Judy to corruptly receive gratification from SLT and Feili and did not dispute that the purpose of Henry withdrawing the moneys from Judy\u2019s BOC Account was to purchase the Property. 46', '34\\u2003Beginning with the PCA Charges, the DJ found that six aggravating factors common to both Henry and Judy were disclosed on the facts, namely, that parties: (a) received a significant amount of gratification (see [11] above); (b) engaged in a long period of offending; (c) exhibited a high degree of planning and premeditation; (d) committed transnational offences; (e) seriously undermined Seagate\u2019s procurement process; and (f) committed the offences for personal gain. 47', '35\\u2003He considered that there were two additional aggravating factors unique to Henry. Henry had recent antecedents for offences under s 6(a) of the PCA and abused his position as Senior Director of Logistics and member of the 2006 and 2009 Tender Committees to obtain and disclose confidential information belonging to Seagate. 48', 'Thus, he found that Henry ought to receive a higher sentence. 49', '36\\u2003While the Defence submitted that the delay in prosecuting Henry and Judy and the advanced ages of the accused persons militated in favour of a non-custodial or a short custodial sentence, the DJ held that this was, at best, a mitigating factor. The Prosecution had demonstrated how investigations against Henry and Judy, which involved the Mutual Legal Assistance process, were ongoing since 2010. 50', '37\\u2003That said, the DJ declined to follow the Prosecution\u2019s proposed sentencing bands, viz, imprisonment terms of one to four months, five to seven months, ten to 12 months and upwards of 12 months for gratification amounts of less than S$10,000, between S$10,000 and S$30,000, between S$50,000 and S$80,000 and above S$90,000 respectively. 51', 'The Prosecution did not account for the gaps (for bribes between S$30,000 and S$50,000 and between S$80,000 and S$90,000) in its proposed sentencing bands and did not provide reasons for departing from these sentencing bands in calibrating the appropriate sentence to be imposed on Henry and Judy. 52', '38\\u2003Having regard to the amount of gratification received, the DJ considered that the sentencing ranges for the PCA Charges should be as follows: 53', '39\\u2003Further accounting for the aforesaid aggravating and mitigating factors, and the sentencing precedents, the DJ imposed sentences of between one and ten months\u2019 imprisonment on Henry and Judy in respect of the PCA Charges. A breakdown of these sentences is set out at Annex B.', '40\\u2003With regard to the CDSA Charge, the DJ considered that the sentencing framework for offences under s 44(1)(a) of the CDSA involving the laundering of cash proceeds of offences committed in Singapore set out in Huang Ying-Chun v Public Prosecutor [2019] 3 SLR 606 (\u201cHuang Ying-Chun\u201d) was equally applicable to the present case. 54', 'As the present case involved a significant sum of S$703,480, a transnational element, a serious predicate offence of corruption, accused persons who had actual knowledge of the predicate offences and the CDSA offence was committed over a year, the DJ considered that the CDSA offence involved moderate harm and low to medium culpability, with an indicative sentence of between ten and 60 months\u2019 imprisonment and a starting point of 25 months\u2019 imprisonment. Again, accounting for the delay in prosecution and the advanced ages of the accused persons, he imposed a sentence of 18 months\u2019 imprisonment in respect of the CDSA Charge on Henry and Judy. 55', '41\\u2003The DJ ordered the sentences for five PCA Charges and the CDSA Charge to run consecutively in respect of Henry and the sentences for four PCA Charges and the CDSA Charge to run consecutively in respect of Judy, resulting in aggregate imprisonment terms of 50 and 41 months respectively. 56', '42\\u2003Finally, he ordered Judy to pay the Penalty of $2,320,864.10 under s 13(1) of the PCA, in default of which Judy was to serve an imprisonment term of 18 months. 57', 'That said, in his written grounds of decision, the DJ stated that that this amount should be RMB11,369,025.44 or S$2,324,954.45. 58', 'The DJ declined to impose an attachment order to enforce the Penalty. He took the view that the default imprisonment term sufficiently ensured that Judy did not benefit from her corrupt behaviour and the imposition of an attachment order risked unduly protracting proceedings. 59'"}

At the material time during which the following events took place, he was practising with Messrs Andrew LLC.', '5\\u2003On 25 November 2016, Mr Hanam was appointed by Mr Pugazendhi to represent his company, P&P, in its dispute with Kori Construction (S) Pte Ltd (\u201cKori\u201d) in relation to two subcontracts for the construction of the Marina Bay Mass Rapid Transit station. The first subcontract was for the provision of manpower (the \u201cManpower Subcontract\u201d) and the second was for the supply of steel fabrication works (the \u201cSteel Fabrication Subcontract\u201d) (collectively, the \u201cSubcontracts\u201d). Under the Subcontracts, Kori owed P&P a total sum that was close to $1.5m. As mentioned, the dispute over the Subcontracts resulted in three sets of legal proceedings, namely, HC\/S 1255\/2016 (\u201cSuit 1255\u201d), DC\/DC 1043\/2018 (\u201cDC 1043\u201d) and HC\/S 1167\/2017 (\u201cSuit 1167\u201d).', '6\\u2003Throughout the conduct of the litigation on behalf of P&P (ie, over the span of the three suits), Mr Hanam did not keep any attendance notes or timesheets of his meetings and discussions with Mr Pugazendhi.', '7\\u2003We set out the chronology of events in the three suits, to provide the necessary background and context to appreciate and assess the DT\u2019s findings on Mr Hanam\u2019s misconduct under the two primary charges, details of which are set out below.', '8\\u2003On 25 November 2016, P&P commenced Suit 1255 against Kori for a claim of $376,344.93 under the Manpower Subcontract and $893,273.66 under the Steel Fabrication Subcontract. These claims were based on invoices that had fallen due as of 25 November 2016 (the \u201cNovember 2016 Invoices\u201d). Even though Mr Hanam was aware that there were other invoices that would fall due in December 2016 (the \u201cDecember 2016 Invoices\u201d), he informed Mr Pugazendhi in a letter dated 25 November 2016 that P&P would commence action for the November 2016 Invoices first and that the claim for the December 2016 Invoices would be filed after they became due and payable. Legal proceedings for the December 2016 Invoices were thus commenced separately in December 2017 (ie, Suit 1167). This approach led to two High Court actions.', '9\\u2003On 31 January 2017, Kori filed HC\/SUM 431\/2017 (\u201cSUM 431\u201d) against P&P to compel disclosure of documents referred to in P&P\u2019s Reply and Defence to Counterclaim. On 3 February 2017, Mr Hanam enclosed a copy of SUM 431 in a letter to Mr Pugazendhi and informed him that P&P would be objecting to the application \u201cbased on the lack of relevance of the documents\u201d. 1', 'P&P failed to resist SUM 431 and was ordered to pay costs of $3,200. On 15 February 2017, Mr Hanam advised Mr Pugazendhi to appeal because the \u201cAssistant Registrar was wrong to make the order as we have provided all the documents and the order to further produce is flawed\u201d. 2', 'P&P then filed HC\/RA 44\/2017 (\u201cRA 44\u201d) on 17 February 2017 but failed in the appeal and was ordered to amend its pleadings and pay costs of $2,000.', '10\\u2003On 17 October 2017, the trial of Suit 1255 commenced. On that same day, an agreement was reached regarding P&P\u2019s claim under the Manpower Subcontract and one of Kori\u2019s counterclaims (\u201cSuit 1255 Settlement\u201d). Kori agreed to pay $236,731.48 to P&P subject to a reduction of $543.73 on account of Kori\u2019s counterclaim. In total, Kori was to pay P&P a settlement sum of $236,187.75. However, there was no express agreement at the time on the timeframe for Kori to pay the settlement sum. Kori took the position that the sum was payable only at the conclusion of Suit 1255 which proceedings continued in respect of P&P\u2019s claim for the Steel Fabrication Subcontract and Kori\u2019s substantial counterclaim for approximately $719,000 (which was to be set off against a sum of approximately $129,000 that Kori owed to P&P). Kori was able to adopt that position because Mr Hanam had not negotiated for the settlement sum to be paid forthwith or within a reasonable time as part of the settlement agreement.', '11\\u2003On 15 November 2017, P&P filed HC\/SUM 5237\/2017 (\u201cSUM 5237\u201d) for third-party discovery against Taisei Corporation (\u201cTaisei\u201d) for the production of documents. This was after P&P unsuccessfully sought voluntary production of documents from Taisei on 23 October 2017. After Taisei filed an affidavit detailing the costs involved in producing copies of the documents, Mr Hanam advised Mr Pugazendhi to withdraw SUM 5237 and to pay costs to Taisei and Kori. Mr Pugazendhi agreed and P&P was ordered to pay costs of $500 to Kori and $2,300 to Taisei. In respect of the sum of $2,300, Taisei commenced garnishee proceedings against P&P and obtained a garnishee order on 26 March 2018, with parties to attend before the assistant registrar on 9 April 2018 for the show cause proceedings. Mr Hanam then agreed on behalf of P&P on 6 April 2018 to pay Taisei the sum of $1,513.70 for the costs incurred by Taisei in obtaining the garnishee order. This was accepted by Taisei, which appeared on P&P\u2019s behalf at the show cause hearing before the assistant registrar, whereupon a costs order of $1,513.70 was made against P&P.', '12\\u2003On 7 December 2017, P&P unsuccessfully applied for leave in HC\/SUM 5616\/2017 (\u201cSUM 5616\u201d) to call four additional witnesses and was ordered to pay costs of $6,000.', '13\\u2003 On 23 March 2018, P&P applied in HC\/SUM 1394\/2018 (\u201cSUM 1394\u201d) for judgment on the Suit 1255 Settlement based on an admission of fact. SUM 1394 was dismissed with costs of $3,700 ordered against P&P on 9 April 2018. On the same day, Mr Hanam updated Mr Pugazendhi by way of letter on the outcome of the application and explained that the assistant registrar agreed with Kori that the Suit 1255 Settlement was not a consent judgment or an admission of fact but a settlement agreement on which the court could not enter judgment on. In that same letter, he also advised Mr Pugazendhi to file a new action against Kori in respect of the Suit 1255 Settlement. This took the form of DC 1043. We digress to highlight that Mr Hanam\u2019s letter did not mention Kori\u2019s position that it would not pay the Suit 1255 Settlement sum before the conclusion of Suit 1255 (see [10] above).', '14\\u2003On 31 December 2018, the High Court found largely in favour of P&P in Suit 1255. In short, P&P succeeded in its claim for work done under the Steel Fabrication Subcontract but the judgment also took into account a sum of $137,224.01 comprising the excess steel that Kori had sold to P&P.', '15\\u2003On 9 April 2018, P&P sued on the Suit 1255 Settlement and filed DC 1043 for payment of $236,187.75 (see [10] above). This was on the same day that SUM 1394 in Suit 1255 was dismissed (see [13] above).', '16\\u2003On 27 July 2018, Kori issued an offer to settle (\u201cOTS\u201d) to P&P, under which Kori offered to pay a settlement sum of $236,187.75 within 14 days of the delivery of the judgment in Suit 1255. P&P did not respond to the OTS.', '17\\u2003On 11 January 2019, Kori made payment of the agreed sum under the Suit 1255 Settlement. As a consequence, the only outstanding issue in DC 1043 was whether interest of $9,588.19 and costs were payable by Kori. On 29 January 2019, Kori issued a second OTS, which proposed that Kori pay for half of the interest and for parties to bear their own costs. Mr Hanam updated Mr Pugazendhi on the second OTS in a letter dated 30 January 2019, and informed him that the court in DC 1043 had indicated that the issue of whether the payment of the Suit 1255 Settlement sum was to be made within a reasonable time or after the resolution of Suit 1255 could go either way and that it might be better for parties to settle since the only remaining issues were that of interest and costs. Mr Hanam then laid out three options for Mr Pugazendhi: first, to \u201c[a]ccept half the interest\u201d; secondly, to \u201c[p]ush for the full interest\u201d and lastly, to \u201c[g]o for trial for the full interest and costs\u201d. He advised Mr Pugazendhi to \u201cmake an offer to [Kori] for [Kori] to pay [P&P] the [full interest] and each party to bear its own costs\u201d. 3', 'On that same day, Mr Pugazendhi informed Mr Hanam that he \u201cwanted option 3\u201d as he \u201cthought that it was only right that Kori paid what [sic] fully due to P&P\u201d. 4', 'In short, P&P did not accept the second OTS and the parties proceeded with the trial.', '18\\u2003On 16 August 2019, the District Court found against P&P in DC 1043. The costs order of about $20,000 in favour of Kori included indemnity costs for costs incurred after the issuance of Kori\u2019s second OTS.', '19\\u2003On 11 December 2017, P&P filed Suit 1167 against Kori for payment of amounts due under the Manpower Subcontract in the sum of $342,821.05. To foreshadow, the sum of $342,821.05 was based on a compromise of the amount owing under the December 2016 Invoices. In Suit 1167, P&P\u2019s claim was in relation to workers supplied from May 2016 to October 2016 whereas P&P\u2019s claim under the Manpower Subcontract in Suit 1255 pertained to workers supplied from November 2015 to April 2016. Two letters of demand were issued prior to the commencement of Suit 1167.', '20\\u2003The first letter of demand to Kori on 23 December 2016 sought a sum of $371,720.14. The amount sought was based on 14 invoices, seven of which were dated 3 November 2016, with the remaining dated 4 November 2016. Payment for these 14 invoices was supposedly due in December 2016 (ie, the December 2016 Invoices). These invoices had been issued by P&P to Kori in early November 2016 and were almost immediately rejected by Kori on the basis that they were not based on \u201ccertified\u201d claims. By \u201ccertified\u201d claims, we understand Kori to mean that the claims were verified from supporting documents to be correct and accurate. Thus, for the purposes of this Judgment, the preference is to use the term \u201cverified\u201d over \u201ccertified\u201d. On 29 December 2016, Kori responded to P&P\u2019s first letter of demand and essentially rejected the invoices for the same reasons as it did in early November 2016, that the claims were not verified as P&P had not provided the relevant supporting documents.', '21\\u2003Almost a year later, around 12 September 2017, P&P obtained some supporting documents for the December 2016 Invoices from Sha Engineering & Contractors Pte Ltd (\u201cSha\u201d). These documents were provided to Kori on or around 4 October 2017. P&P then issued a further letter of demand on 20 October 2017 seeking a sum of $433,493.38, which was based on the same 14 invoices referred to in the letter of demand sent on 23 December 2016 with the addition of an invoice dated 6 November 2015 (Invoice Number P&P15NOV\/113) for $61,773.24.', '22\\u2003On 26 October 2017, Kori\u2019s lawyers wrote to Mr Hanam stating that Kori had carried out a \u201ccertification\u201d of the claim amount and confirmed that Kori was agreeable to pay an amount of $342,821.05. Accompanying this was a request to P&P to issue invoices for a sum of $342,821.05 (inclusive of GST), which figure was arrived at by deducting the invoice dated 6 November 2015 (Invoice Number P&P15 NOV\/113) which was, in fact, for a sum of $61,518.07 (and not $61,773.24; see [21] above) that it had already paid and also by deducting the claims that were not verified as P&P had not presented all the relevant supporting documents. Although Kori\u2019s offer to pay $342,821.05 was not stated to be subject to any conditions, Kori nevertheless indicated that it would not make payment until after determination of its counterclaim in Suit 1255.', '23\\u2003On 7 November 2017, Mr Hanam sent P&P\u2019s revised invoice dated 4 November 2017 for the amount of $342,821.05 and requested payment by 5 December 2017. On 9 November 2017, Kori maintained that it would only make payment upon resolution of Suit 1255. Mr Hanam updated Mr Pugazendhi of Kori\u2019s position on 15 November 2017 and advised Mr Pugazendhi to commence action on the sum of $342,821.05.', '24\\u2003As no payment was received, P&P filed Suit 1167 on 11 December 2017 against Kori claiming the amount of $342,821.05. This was the sum that Kori had agreed to pay which was based on P&P\u2019s acceptance of Kori\u2019s \u201ccertification\u201d for which it issued an invoice on 4 November 2017. P&P pleaded that the sum was due within 30 days and that Kori was not entitled to set off the claim amount from its counterclaim in Suit 1255.', '25\\u2003We mention for completeness that on 13 April 2018, P&P amended its Statement of Claim to include a claim for the sum of $371,720.14. This is the sum that P&P initially sought in the letter of demand dated 23 December 2016 based on the 14 invoices dated November 2016 (see [20] above). The amendment was made because Kori had allegedly repudiated its earlier \u201ccertification\u201d of the sum of $342,821.05 in its Defence filed on 9 January 2018.', '26\\u2003Following the commencement of Suit 1167, P&P sought summary judgment on 10 January 2018 by way of HC\/SUM 170\/2018, which was dismissed on 19 February 2018. The assistant registrar who heard the application granted Kori unconditional leave to defend the action because of Kori\u2019s assertion on affidavit that there was an express agreement to set off the amounts due from P&P to Kori under the counterclaim in Suit 1255 against all amounts due from Kori to P&P under the Manpower Subcontract.', '27\\u2003On 22 May 2018, P&P issued an OTS to Kori. The offer was for Kori to pay the sum of $350,000 in full and final settlement, plus interest and costs, within 14 days of acceptance. We note that the OTS is for a sum larger than the amount sought in Suit 1167, that being $342,821.05, and return to this point below at [67].', '28\\u2003On 21 January 2019, the High Court found in favour of P&P and ordered Kori to pay P&P the sum of $416,343.69, comprising the judgment sum of $342,821.05, costs of $45,000, disbursements of $8,068.80 as well as pre- and post-judgment interest. It is convenient to note here the High Court\u2019s findings. First, the sum of $342,821.05 was a compromise of the amount claimed by P&P for the workers supplied in the period from May 2016 to October 2016. The revised invoice dated 4 November 2017 for the amount of $342,821.05 replaced and superseded the earlier invoices for a total figure of $371.720.14 (claimed under the first letter of demand). Secondly, the alleged express agreement to set off the amounts due from P&P to Kori arising from its counterclaim in Suit 1255 against all amounts due from Kori to P&P under the Manpower Subcontract was not supported by any contemporaneous documentary evidence. If anything, the refusal to pay before the conclusion of the counterclaim in Suit 1255 was an unwarranted unilateral decision to hold back payment. As it transpired, the question of an agreement to set off became moot as the upshot of the decision in Suit 1255 at the end of December 2018 was that there was no net sum due from P&P to Kori.', '29\\u2003On 11 March 2020, Mr Pugazendhi lodged a complaint against Mr Hanam with the Law Society. Mr Pugazendhi claimed that Mr Hanam breached an agreement to charge a fixed fee of $170,000 and that he had overcharged for the work done in the three suits. Mr Pugazendhi also alleged that Mr Hanam acted in matters without his knowledge or agreement.', '30\\u2003On 25 August 2020, the Inquiry Committee was constituted to inquire into the conduct of Mr Hanam. The Inquiry Committee recommended on 23 November 2020 that a formal investigation be conducted by a disciplinary tribunal in respect of the complaint that Mr Hanam had overcharged for the work done in the three suits. A proposed charge was framed by the Inquiry Committee under s 83(2)(b) of the LPA, where it was alleged that Mr Hanam was in breach of r 17(7) of the PCR. The Inquiry Committee determined that there was no need for a formal investigation by a disciplinary tribunal for the remaining complaints (see [29] above).', '31\\u2003On 8 March 2021, the DT was constituted to hear and investigate the complaint referred to it by the Inquiry Committee. By then, the Law Society had filed its Statement of Case on 1 March 2021 which preferred a single charge pertaining to the allegation of overcharging against Mr Hanam (the \u201cFirst Charge\u201d), which was in pari materia with the proposed charge framed by the Inquiry Committee (see [30] above). Mr Hanam objected to the charge in his defence filed on 18 March 2021 on the basis that it was premature as the bill of costs for the three suits had not been taxed. The DT then directed submissions on whether it had the jurisdiction to investigate a charge of overcharging when the legal practitioner\u2019s bill of costs had not been taxed. Following the parties\u2019 submissions, the DT stayed the First Charge until Mr Hanam\u2019s professional fees were taxed.', '32\\u2003On 6 April 2021, Law Society filed an application to amend its Statement of Case. The Law Society avers that this was because they had been made aware of matters not reflected in Mr Pugazendhi\u2019s complaint in the course of taking instructions and was of the view that further charges should be preferred. The Statement of Case (Amendment No 1) (\u201cSOC1\u201d) was filed on 29 April 2021 to include five additional charges.', '33\\u2003According to the Law Society and the DT, Mr Hanam informed the DT on 3 May 2021 that he accepted that the Law Society could introduce new charges under s 89(4) of the LPA. On 27 May 2021, he filed an amended defence, Defence (Amendment No 1) (\u201cDefence\u201d), denying the five additional charges.', '34\\u2003The affidavits of evidence-in-chief (\u201cAEICs\u201d) of the Law Society and Mr Hanam were exchanged on 2 August 2021. No further AEICs were filed.', '35\\u2003The DT hearing was conducted between 17 August 2021 and 20 August 2021. On 20 August 2021, the Law Society applied to amend SOC1. The principal amendment was to include the term \u201cfailed to properly and periodically evaluate with the Complainant the use of alternative dispute resolution processes\u201d to certain charges. 5', 'This was allowed and the Statement of Case (Amendment No 2) (\u201cSOC2\u201d) was filed on the same day.', '36\\u2003Based on the SOC2, six charges were preferred against Mr Hanam. The six charges were also framed as alternative charges. In short, the primary charges were based on s 83(2)(b) of the LPA whereas the alternative charges were brought under s 83(2)(h). The primary and alternative charges framed against Mr Hanam are as follows: 6', '37\\u2003The DT found Mr Hanam guilty of the Second and Third Charges, and that cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action existed under s 83(2)(b) of the LPA. The Sixth Charge, which was an alternative to the Second and Third Charges, was deemed to be withdrawn. The Fourth and Fifth Charges were dismissed as it was not shown that Mr Pugazendhi disputed or raised a query about Mr Hanam\u2019s bills in February 2017 or January 2019. No findings were made as to the alternative charges. The DT\u2019s decision is set out in full in The Law Society of Singapore v Andrew John Hanam [2022] SGDT 12 (the \u201cReport\u201d).', '38\\u2003In substance, the Second Charge, which was framed under r 17(2)(e) of the PCR, concerned Mr Hanam\u2019s failure to evaluate with Mr Pugazendhi whether the steps taken in the legal proceedings justified the expense of, or the risk involved in pursuing litigation, and whether ADR processes should have been used. The Third Charge, on the other hand, concerned his breach of r 17(2)(f) of the PCR by his failure to advise P&P on the relevant legal issues in the proceedings, to enable P&P to make an informed decision about how to act in the said proceedings.', '39\\u2003The DT rejected Mr Hanam\u2019s preliminary objection that the Second and Third Charges were vague and did not contain sufficient particulars. Mr Hanam\u2019s objections were belated and, in any event, no prejudice had been occasioned to him. The Law Society\u2019s case was not unduly vague, wide or unfocused, and there was no attempt by the Law Society to take advantage of the generality of the charges. That said, the DT put aside the first limb of the Second Charge, which pertained to Mr Hanam\u2019s failure to advise Mr Pugazendhi on the anticipated legal fees, as it was irrelevant to the inquiry of a breach of r 17(2)(e) of the PCR and confined its consideration to the second and third limbs of the charge (see [36] above).', '40\\u2003In the DT\u2019s assessment, the nub of the Second and Third Charges concerned Mr Hanam\u2019s \u201calleged failure[s] to give proper advice\u201d. 7', 'While it was clear that Mr Hanam\u2019s written advice was inadequate, what was in dispute was whether he had provided advice orally. Although Mr Hanam\u2019s evidence under cross-examination was that he had numerous meetings with Mr Pugazendhi during which he gave oral advice, he had no timesheets or attendance notes of these alleged meetings with Mr Pugazendhi to support his stance. The DT found that it was appropriate to draw an adverse inference against Mr Hanam, as sought by the Law Society, having regard to several matters. First, the DT noted the absence of attendance notes and contemporaneous documents notwithstanding the numerous meetings that Mr Hanam purportedly had with Mr Pugazendhi. Mr Hanam also did not provide any reasons for his failure to keep attendances notes of these meetings, in several of which he would have had substantive and important discussions with Mr Pugazendhi. Secondly, his evidence that he met Mr Pugazendhi was belated and had not been mentioned in his Defence or AEIC. Finally, there was no objective or corroborative evidence to support his allegation that he had numerous meetings with Mr Pugazendhi regarding the litigation matters he was handling, and that he rendered legal advice orally on those occasions.', '41\\u2003The DT took a global approach towards the Second and Third Charges, and analysed Mr Hanam\u2019s breaches of the various PCR according to the chronology of the three suits and the interlocutory proceedings at the various stages therein (see [8]\u2013[28] above). The DT found the Second and Third Charges to be proven on 14 counts. The DT\u2019s findings in respect of rr 17(2)(e)(i) and 17(2)(f) are as follows:', '(a)\\u2003Two counts arising from the commencement of Suit 1255, in particular, Mr Hanam\u2019s failure to advise Mr Pugazendhi on SOPA Adjudication as well as his failure to advise Mr Pugazendhi on commencing Suit 1255 only after all the invoices had fallen due.', '(b)\\u2003One count arising from Mr Hanam\u2019s conduct in resisting Kori\u2019s application for documents in SUM 431 in Suit 1255 and filing RA 44.', '(c)\\u2003One count in relation to Mr Hanam\u2019s failure to obtain the instructions of Mr Pugazendhi in the filing of SUM 1394 in Suit 1255.', '(d)\\u2003One count arising from Mr Hanam\u2019s failure to advise on the filing of SUM 5237 and SUM 5616 to obtain additional evidence in Suit 1255.', '(e)\\u2003One count arising from Mr Hanam\u2019s failure to evaluate or advise Mr Pugazendhi on the commencement of DC 1043.', '(f)\\u2003Two counts arising from Mr Hanam\u2019s failure to evaluate and advise P&P on Kori\u2019s OTS dated 27 July 2018 and 29 January 2019 in DC 1043.', '(g)\\u2003Two counts arising from the commencement of Suit 1167, in particular, Mr Hanam\u2019s failure to advise on the timing of the filing of Suit 1167 as well as his failure to advise on the option of waiting for the issue of judgment in Suit 1255 in lieu of filing Suit 1167.', '(h)\\u2003One count arising from Mr Hanam issuing an OTS on P&P\u2019s behalf without the knowledge and consent of Mr Pugazendhi in Suit 1167.', '42\\u2003In addition, r 17(2)(f) was breached on two further counts where Mr Hanam made proposals for costs on behalf of P&P to Taisei and Kori without Mr Pugazendhi\u2019s instructions in Suit 1255. Mr Hanam also breached r 17(2)(e)(ii) in failing to evaluate with Mr Pugazendhi the use of ADR processes in Suit 1167.'"}

As such, under this arrangement, V Spec and the Guarantors are jointly and severally liable for the repayment of the loan sum.', '3\\u2003Further to the First Loan Agreement, the respondent and Mdm Wong, as the registered proprietors of the Property, executed a document authorising and consenting to the lodgment of a caveat by the applicant on the Property, which I will hereafter term as an \u201cAuthorisation to Caveat\u201d in favour of the applicant.', '4\\u2003On 13 April 2022, the applicant entered into another loan agreement with V Spec for the sum of $200,000 (\u201cthe Second Loan Agreement\u201d). The Second Loan Agreement was again secured by a guarantee executed by the Guarantors (\u201cthe Second Guarantee\u201d). Further to the Second Loan Agreement, the respondent and Mdm Wong executed an Authorisation to Caveat in favour of the applicant.', '5\\u2003Finally, on 20 April 2022, the applicant entered into another loan agreement with V Spec for the sum of $190,000 (\u201cthe Third Loan Agreement\u201d) secured by a guarantee executed by the Guarantors (\u201cthe Third Guarantee\u201d). Further to the Third Loan Agreement, the respondent and Mdm Wong similarly executed an Authorisation to Caveat in favour of the applicant.', '6\\u2003Relying on the three Authorisations to Caveat, the applicant lodged the Caveat over the Property on 31 October 2022. This was done on the basis that the applicant has an \u201cinterest in the sale proceeds of the [P]roperty\u201d, which are the words stated in the Authorisations to Caveat.', '7\\u2003However, on 9 February 2023, following earlier correspondence, the applicant\u2019s solicitors received a letter from the solicitors of the private trustees of the respondent\u2019s bankruptcy estate (\u201cthe Private Trustees\u201d). In the letter, the Private Trustees stated that the Caveat had been wrongfully lodged and demanded that it be withdrawn by no later than 14 February 2023. On 17 February 2023, the applicant\u2019s solicitors replied to say that it would withdraw the Caveat in exchange for the payment of the debt in the three Loan Agreements and all legal fees.', '8\\u2003On 23 March 2023, the respondent and Mdm Wong, being registered proprietors of the Property, made an \u201cApplication to Cancel Vexatious Caveat\u201d to the Singapore Land Authority. A day later, on 24 March 2023, the Singapore Land Authority issued a Notice to the applicant pursuant to s 127(2) of the Land Titles Act 1993 (2020 Rev Ed) (\u201cLTA\u201d). The Notice provided that the Caveat would be cancelled on the expiration of 30 days from the date of service, unless a court order to the contrary is served on the Registrar of Titles within the same period. This application to cancel the Caveat required the applicant to make an application to determine the validity of the Caveat. However, as the respondent had become a bankrupt as of 5 January 2023, the applicant cannot bring such an application against the respondent without permission of the court.', '9\\u2003It is against this background that the applicant brings the present application. As I mentioned at the outset, the Private Trustees do not object to this application. Nevertheless, they filed an affidavit to set out their position in relation to the application. Most relevantly, they maintained their view that \u201cthe Caveat has been wrongfully lodged by the [a]pplicant over the Property\u201d. This is because they were advised that: (a) the various Authorisations to Caveat do not confer on the applicant any legal, equitable or contractual interest in the sale proceeds of the Property, and (b) the Loan Agreements likewise do not confer on the applicant any pre-existing interest in the Property, or any interest in the sales proceeds of the Property. As such, the Private Trustees maintain that there is no caveatable interest for the Caveat to secure.'"}

I also find \nthat the likely sentence for the theft charges would be two years\u2019 \nimprisonment.

I also agree that his theft convictions \nconcern relatively low value items and cash. However, this must be \nplaced in the context of the repeated nature of the appellant\u2019s offending, \nand the need to protect the public from such crimes. As noted by the \nProsecution, the appellant has had multiple convictions for related \noffences, and his present set of offences involve five separate theft \noffences.

Therefore, the Car was sandwiched and Mustaqim had no choice but to stop the Car. Sgt Yoga, W\/SSgt Nurshila and SSgt Helmi then moved in to arrest Zaiman, who was seated at the front passenger seat of the Car.

During this period, there was no KM-1 physically in Singapore for NPE to review or inspect. It should be noted that Mr Lewis Lim had left Konica\u2019s employment on 30 August 2019 and Konica has not called Mr Lewis Lim as a witness in support of its case.', '6\\u2003Because there was no KM-1 physically in Singapore, Mr Lewis Lim had suggested to Mr Francis Chia to send materials, such as media content, to Konica Japan for test printing. On 20 September 2018, NPE sent these materials to Konica Japan for test printing to be conducted on two-sided polyethylene (\u201cPE\u201d) coated paper. NPE\u2019s materials were printed out using a KM-1 in Japan. In or around October 2018, Mr Lewis Lim sent Mr Francis Chia the test print samples from Japan. Mr Francis Chia was impressed by the test print samples. He became even more interested in purchasing a KM-1 because he felt that it was rare to have such good quality two-sided prints on PE material. 3', '7\\u2003On 29 October 2018, Mr Lewis Lim presented a written proposal in respect of the KM-1 (\u201cKM-1 Proposal\u201d) to Mr Francis Chia. There were two versions of the KM-1 Proposal in evidence. They are both dated 29 October 2018 and are identical except for the offer price, which is $1,900,000 in the one produced by NPE, 4', 'and $1,550,000 in the one produced by Konica in discovery. 5', 'NPE\u2019s case is that the offer price had been reduced in the version with the price marked as $1,550,000. But since NPE had not seen this latter version prior to discovery, I will only refer to the version that has $1,900,000 as the offer price.', '8\\u2003The KM-1 Proposal is fairly detailed and contains several constituent documents. These constituent documents include: (a) a cover letter (\u201cthe Proposal Cover Letter\u201d) signed off by Konica\u2019s Mr Lewis Goh (\u201cMr Goh\u201d), who is a Senior Account Manager, 6', '(b) a brochure about the KM-1 that is similar to but not an exact copy of the KM-1 Brochure (\u201cthe Proposal Brochure\u201d), 7', '(c) a document titled \u201cProposal\u201d that lists various package prices, included accessories, a sample service contract with two options, various terms and conditions, as well as an appendix of various spare parts (\u201cthe Proposal Details\u201d), 8', 'and (d) a signature page for both parties to sign off on (\u201cthe Proposal Signature Page\u201d). 9', '9\\u2003At this point, I make three observations about the KM-1 Proposal. First, while the Proposal Cover Letter stated that Mr Francis Chia had visited Japan on 6 to 7 September 2018 to evaluate the KM-1\u2019s print quality and capabilities, this is clearly untrue as by October 2018, Konica would have known that such a visit never took place. As such, Konica is wrong to characterise this as an \u201cinvitation\u201d from Mr Goh to Mr Francis Chia for the latter to visit Konica\u2019s office in Japan. 10', 'Second, while it is true that neither Konica nor NPE signed off on the Proposal Signature Page, Konica is not correct to suggest that it follows that neither party signed or acknowledged the KM-1 Proposal at all. 11', 'This is because Konica\u2019s Mr Goh had clearly signed off on the Proposal Cover Letter, which is part of the KM-1 Proposal. Further, it makes no sense for Konica to present Mr Francis Chia with a proposal that it never acknowledged or intended to honour. On the contrary, the Proposal Cover Letter states that the KM-1 Proposal was vetted by no less than three individuals of various seniority at Konica, including Mr Lewis Lim. Third, the offer price of the KM-1 on the Proposal Details was stated to be $1,900,000. 12', 'While there are two other prices quoted on the page, I understand those to be the pre-discounted prices.', '10\\u2003After negotiations, on or around 2 November 2018, Konica presented the KM-1 Order Form to NPE for the purchase of the KM-1 at $1,658,500, including taxes. 13', 'Mr Goh and Mr Francis Chia signed this Order Form on behalf of Konica and NPE, respectively. At this point, I make some observations about the Order Form. Most broadly, while the KM-1 Order Form contains several terms and conditions, it is decidedly bare. For example, the KM-1 Order Form does not even make clear what the terms of payment are. All that it states under the section titled \u201cTerms of Payment\u201d is that the \u201cDown Payment\u201d is 20%, amounting to $331,700 with taxes. There is otherwise no provision on when the Balance Sum is due and how that is to be paid, whether by instalments or otherwise. Further, while the KM-1 Order Form refers to a \u201cService Click Model\u201d under the section titled \u201cService Contract\u201d, it merely lists the cost of the impressions made by the KM-1 subject to a minimum charge of $10,000 per month. There is otherwise no mention of what the \u201cservice\u201d to be provided is, in contrast to the description of the \u201cService Click Model\u201d in the Proposal Details. In my view, for reasons that I will develop later, the KM-1 Order Form could not have been intended by the parties to constitute the entirety of their true agreement. Indeed, even by Konica\u2019s own pleaded case \u2013 which it appears to have dropped in its Closing Submissions \u2013 the KM-1 Order Form is subject to other terms, namely (a) the General Terms of its Products and Services Agreement and\/or (b) further implied terms (which appear to be based on the said General Terms). 14', '11\\u2003Returning then to the undisputed facts, due to the space and environmental requirements for housing the KM-1, NPE carried out customisation works at their premises from December 2018 to January 2019. Following this, the components of the KM-1 were delivered to NPE\u2019s premises on 19 January 2019. NPE accepted the components of the KM-1 by signing and acknowledging Konica\u2019s delivery note dated 19 January 2019.', '12\\u2003The installation of the KM-1 by Konica\u2019s engineers took place over more than a month and was completed on 4 March 2019. On or around 4 March 2019, Konica requested NPE to sign the \u201cCompletion of Installation\u201d form (\u201cCOI\u201d). Mr Francis Chia obliged but annotated in his handwriting that this did not constitute acceptance of the KM-1 and that commissioning had yet to be completed. However, before the installation was completed, NPE had started to use the KM-1. In particular, from late February 2019 to 5 March 2019, NPE sent some printed test samples from the KM-1 to a testing agency for confirmation that the prints carried out by the KM-1 would be food safe and could be used to fulfil NPE\u2019s production of food packaging.', '13\\u2003On 29 March 2019, Konica sent its invoice to NPE for the full purchase price of KM-1. This invoice stated that the payment term for this sum is 30 days. When NPE did not pay up, Konica reminded NPE on several occasions thereafter to make full payment of the Down Payment. In response, NPE made a total payment of $331,700 in fulfilment of the Down Payment in the following manner: (a) $100,000 on 4 April 2019 and (b) $231,700 on 6 August 2019. This meant that by 6 August 2019, NPE had fully paid the Down Payment. Despite all this, NPE consistently encountered problems with the KM-1. In April 2019, a WhatsApp chat group was created between representatives from Konica and NPE in which NPE raised issues and\/or problems faced with the KM-1 (\u201cWhatsApp Chat Group\u201d). Such messages were sent often over the course of several months.', '14\\u2003On 1 January 2020, Konica\u2019s Mr Davion Than (\u201cMr Than\u201d) informed Mr Francis Chia that Konica would be sending a \u201cTiger Team\u201d consisting of representatives from Konica Japan to address the issues with KM-1. Between 29 January 2020 to 7 February 2020, Konica\u2019s Tiger Team visited NPE to troubleshoot the KM-1. However, issues with the KM-1 persisted. On 7 April 2020, despite the Tiger Team visit, NPE faced a complete breakdown of the KM-1. NPE\u2019s Mr Soh Ting Poh then wrote to Konica to request assistance. On 8 April 2020, Konica initially sent NPE a quotation of $428.00 for services to be rendered in relation to assistance sought for the complete breakdown. However, on 14 April 2020, Konica sent NPE a different quotation in the sum of $60,512.83 for the same services. NPE did not accept the quotation and the KM-1 has therefore remained non-operational since.', '15\\u2003On 20 April 2020, Konica\u2019s technicians attended at NPE\u2019s premises and carried out a complete shutdown of the KM-1. Konica\u2019s reason for the shutdown was that \u201cthe machine will not be running\u201d and that it was purportedly important that the machine be shut down \u201cwhen the machine is not in use for [a] long period of time\u201d. 15'"}

she had \nalso visited the scene of the stabbing on 3 July 2018, and indicated where she \nand the deceased were when she stabbed the deceased.26\n40 In speaking with Dr Lijo, however, the accused reverted to denying that \nshe had stabbed the deceased, again blaming two dark-skinned men for the \ndeceased\u2019s death, as she had in her first statement of 25 June 2018 (which was \nuntrue, as she acknowledged in her subsequent statements to the police).\n41 Dr Lijo records the accused\u2019s account of events as follows:27\nShe was aware of the charge against her. She denied \ncommitting the alleged offence and stated that she admitted \ncommitting the offence as the investigation officer told her that \nshe will be given a death penalty if she did not agree to the \ncharge. She stated that she considered the victim like a mother, \neven though the victim was physically abusive towards her and \nhit her on multiple occasions. She also alleged that the victim \nhad burned her hands on two occasions[s] but shared that she \nhad no grudge against the victim. She stated that on the day of \nalleged offence, at around 11 am, she went to the centralized \nrubbish chute outside the employer\u2019s apartment to throw \nrubbish. At that time victim was at the apartment and when \nshe came back, she saw two \u2018dark skinned\u2019 men standing inside \nthe apartment. She reported that she was scared after seeing \nthe two men and hence sat near the centralized chute for twenty \nminutes. When she came back to the apartment, the men were \nnot there and found the victim lying on a sofa with blood on the \nfloor\u2026\n26 CH-PS 63, AB 497\u2013529. \n27 P450, para 12.\nVersion No 2: 18 May 2023 (17:57 hrs)\nPP v Zin Mar Nwe[2023] SGHC 146\n1642 The accused\u2019s story about two dark-skinned men having caused the \ndeath of the deceased was untrue; so too was her attempt to blame her admission \nof the stabbing on the police having threatened her with the death penalty. In \nthe statement of agreed facts, the accused agreed that her statement of 29 June \n2018 (in which she admitted to the stabbing, and said that her story about the \ntwo dark-skinned men was untrue) was one of the statements recorded and given \nvoluntarily by her, and that no threat, inducement, or promise was made to her \nat any time before or during the recording of the statements.\n43 Dr Lijo\u2019s opinion as expressed in his first report dated 30 July 2018, was \nthat the accused had no mental illness, and was not of unsound mind at the time \nof the alleged offence.\n(8) What the accused told Dr Tan for his report\n44 Dr Tan examined the accused on four occasions from March\u2013September \n2020, and gave a report dated 12 September 2020.\n45 The accused told Dr Tan that the deceased beat her with utensils such as \na small frying pan or ladle on her head or back, and with her knuckles and palm; \nshe was beaten many times through the day, almost every day. The accused also \nmentioned that she was kicked in the chest when she was cutting the deceased\u2019s \ntoenails, was burned on her right arm by the deceased pushing a hot pan against \nher, and was also cut by a knife when she was cutting onions and the deceased \npulled the knife away.\n46 The accused said that she had caused something to fall on the deceased\u2019s \nfoot, in response to which the deceased hit her on the back of her head with an \nobject, pulled her hair, and slapped her face. \nVersion No 2: 18 May 2023 (17:57 hrs)\nPP v Zin Mar Nwe[2023] SGHC 146\n1747 The accused said that she saw something stuck in the drawer of the altar \nand wanted to tell the deceased about it, but the deceased shouted at her and \nthen took scissors and pointed them at her neck while scolding her. The accused \nsaid, \u201cfear overcame her\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t know what happened\u201d, she was fearful that \nshe was going to die, and she thought the deceased was going to kill her \u2013 but \nthis is quite different from what she told the police in her statement dated 30 \nJune 2018 ([ 30] above).\n48 The accused said that the deceased told her, \u201cTomorrow, I\u2019m going to \nsend you agency. Don\u2019t work here.\u201d The accused said that she was in a daze; \nshe picked up the knife, but \u201cmy mind was blank\u201d (in her native language, \n\u201cnothing in my head\u201d), and \u201cI cannot recall what happened.\u201d She told Dr Tan \nthat she then realised something was wrong \u2013 \u201cI think I stabbed her\u201d. This \naccount is also quite different from the detailed account she had given to the \npolice about her stabbing of the deceased.\n49 Dr Tan\u2019s opinion was that the accused had mixed anxiety and depressive \nreaction (under ICD\u201310) or adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and \ndepressed mood (under DSM\u20135) at the time of the alleged offence.28 He added \nthat the accused had described that she was not able to remember exactly what \nhappened after the deceased said that she was sending her back to the agency \nthe next day; she remembered she was \u201cblank\u201d in her mind; she did not realise \nthat she had stabbed the deceased, and only realised what she had done after she \nhad stabbed the deceased.29\n50 Dr Tan concluded:\n28 Exhibit D4 at para 79.\n29 Exhibit D4 at para 88.\nVersion No 2: 18 May 2023 (17:57 hrs)\nPP v Zin Mar Nwe[2023] SGHC 146\n18She was in a dissociative state at the time of the alleged offence. \nHer mind was not conscious of what she was doing. She was \nnot able to control her acts when she was stabbing [the \ndeceased]. She was unable to remember she had stabbed [the \ndeceased]. She only knew that she had stabbed [the deceased] \nafter it had happened.\n(9) What the accused told Dr Lijo for his second report\n51 Dr Lijo gave a second report dated 16 March 2021. After his first report, \nhe interviewed the accused on three occasions between December 2020 and \nFebruary 2021. He also considered Dr Tan\u2019s report of 12 September 2020. He \nnoted that the accused had given different versions of what happened \u2013 one \nversion (what the accused told the police on 29 June 2018) was that she had \nstabbed the deceased several times with a knife as she was very angry with the \ndeceased because the deceased said that she would be sent back to her agent. \nThe accused first gave Dr Lijo this explanation: she \u201cmight have told the \ninvestigation officer about what likely could have happened at the time of \nalleged offence\u201d, but subsequently she accepted that she had told the \ninvestigation officer in June 2018 that she had stabbed the victim \u2013 she claimed \nthat she said so because she believed that by telling the investigation officer that \nshe stabbed the victim she could get a lighter sentence.30\n52 Further, the accused confirmed that what she had told Dr Lijo in 2018 \n(that she did not stab the deceased, and two dark-skinned men had caused the \ndeceased\u2019s death) was untrue \u2013 she said she had lied to him in 2018 so that she \nwould not be punished and could go back to her home country; she said sorry \nfor lying to Dr Lijo in 2018.31\n30 P450A at para 16.\n31 P450A at para 15.\nVersion No 2: 18 May 2023 (17:57 hrs)\nPP v Zin Mar Nwe[2023] SGHC 146\n1953 Dr Lijo disagreed with Dr Tan\u2019s diagnosis of the accused. He said that \nDr Tan\u2019s diagnosis was solely based on information given by the accused, and \nfor such diagnoses, apart from the mood and anxiety symptoms, there should be \nimpairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning, \nwhich was lacking in this case.32\n54 Dr Lijo maintained that the accused had no mental illness \u2013 her reported \nsymptoms of feeling sad at night when she thought about her family, and feeling \nstressed when around the deceased due to the alleged abuse, did not amount to \nmental illness. They were instead normal and expected reactions of being away \nfrom her family, and to the alleged abuse she faced from the deceased.33\n55 Further, Dr Lijo disagreed with Dr Tan about the accused being in a \ndissociative state at the time of the alleged offence \u2013 that was based on the \ninformation given by the accused that she did not know she had stabbed the \ndeceased, until after that had happened. But in her statements to the police on \n29 and 30 June 2018, she told the police that she had stabbed the deceased \nseveral times, and described the deceased\u2019s reactions at the time of the stabbing.\nThe aftermath of the stabbing\n56 After stabbing the deceased, the accused ransacked one of the bedrooms \nin the flat, broke the lock of a locked cupboard in that bedroom and retrieved \nher belongings which were kept in an envelope in that cupboard. She went to \nthe kitchen to wash the knife she had used to stab the deceased, and left the knife \nthere. She changed into a dress and took a bag belonging to her. She also took \n32 P450A at para 18(b).\n33 P450A at para 18(a).\nVersion No 2: 18 May 2023 (17:57 hrs)\nPP v Zin Mar Nwe[2023] SGHC 146\n20some money and an EZ-link card from on top of the microwave oven in the \nkitchen. It was not disputed that theft was not a motive for the stabbing.\n57 The accused then went to her maid agency, and asked for her passport, \nbut she left when she heard that the staff were about to call her employer.\n58 Over the next five hours, the accused then wandered around parts of \nSingapore, by bus, by MRT, and on foot; she bought bottles of mineral water, \nand food at a hawker centre which she ate. Finally, she took a taxi back to the \nmaid agency, where she was arrested.\n59 The accused left behind in the taxi a plastic bag containing cash. The \ntaxi driver located the maid agency and tried to return the bag to the accused, \nbut the accused said that the bag did not belong to her. However, forensic \nexamination found the bag and four currency notes to be stained with her blood.\nThe accused\u2019s testimony at trial\n60 In her testimony at trial, the accused maintained that she did not know \nwhat was happening when she stabbed the deceased, and that she only realised \nafter the stabbing, that the knife was in her hand and the deceased was on the \nsofa with blood.34\n61 This testimony contrasted with the details given in her statements to the \npolice. In cross-examination, she was reminded of the statements she had given \nto the police, and what she had described during the scene visit. She then \n34 Transcript, 23 September 2022, 27:1\u20133.\nVersion No 2: 18 May 2023 (17:57 hrs)\nPP v Zin Mar Nwe[2023] SGHC 146\n21conceded that she was able to recall what happened during the stabbing as she \nhad told the police.35\nFindings\n62 I accept that the deceased had hit the accused (to get her attention, or to \nreprimand her), and that the deceased had also retaliated when the accused had \naccidentally hurt the deceased. I do not believe that the accused would have \nstabbed the deceased if there were just an isolated statement by the deceased, \non the day in question, that the accused would be sent back to the agent. Rather, \nthat statement was made after a period in which the deceased had scolded, hit, \nand hurt the accused.\n63 But for the threat to send the accused back to the agent, however, the \naccused would not have stabbed the deceased. From what the accused said, the \ndeceased\u2019s treatment of her would not, in itself, have caused her to stab the \ndeceased. The accused did not report the deceased\u2019s treatment of her to her \nemployer or his family members, or to her agent, or to her family. It seems that \nshe was willing to tolerate such treatment, although she was hurt, sad, and felt \nunappreciated.\n64 The accused however feared being sent back to the agent (and \nconsequently back to her home country in debt), and when the deceased \nthreatened to do so, that triggered the stabbing. As the accused told the police, \nshe was \u201cvery angry\u201d when the deceased said that; she took a knife, went to the \ndeceased, and stabbed her.\n35 Transcript, 30 November 2022, 24:17 to 30:11, particularly at 26:15\u201329. \nVersion No 2: 18 May 2023 (17:57 hrs)\nPP v Zin Mar Nwe[2023] SGHC 146\n2265 I do not accept that the accused was in a dissociative state at the time of \nthe stabbing. From what she told the police, she reacted in anger at the deceased, \nand she was aware of what she was doing. Indeed, she described the stabbing in \ndetail. I do not accept that she was not conscious of what she was doing.\n66 The accused\u2019s behaviour in the aftermath of the stabbing is also \ninconsistent with her being in a dissociative state \u2013 she retrieved her belongings, \nwashed the knife, changed, tried to get her passport from the maid agency, and \ndenied that the bag and money she left in the taxi (which were stained with her \nblood) belonged to her.\n67 Turning to the elements of the defence of diminished responsibility, I \nfind that for the first limb (abnormality of mind) the accused was not suffering \nfrom an abnormality of mind at the time of stabbing. An abnormality of mind \n\u201cmeans a state of mind so different from that of ordinary human beings that the \nreasonable man would term it abnormal\u201d: Iskandar at [81], citing R v Byrne \n[1960] 2 QB 396 at 403.\n68 I prefer Dr Lijo\u2019s medical opinion to that of Dr Tan\u2019s \u2013 that the accused\u2019s \nreported symptoms of feeling sad and stressed were normal and expected \nreactions to her situation. I find Dr Lijo\u2019s opinion to be more consonant with the \nrest of the evidence, including what the accused admitted to the police.\n69 On the second limb (that the abnormality of mind was caused by a cause \nsuch as disease, ie, mental illness), I find that the accused was not suffering from \na mental illness at the time of the stabbing: in particular, she was not suffering \nfrom adjustment disorder (as diagnosed by Dr Tan).\nVersion No 2: 18 May 2023 (17:57 hrs)\nPP v Zin Mar Nwe[2023] SGHC 146\n2370 For the purposes of Criterion B in DSM-5, on the evidence, the accused \nwas not suffering from marked distress out of proportion to the severity or \nintensity of the stressor (the deceased), nor did she suffer from significant \nimpairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of function.\n71 The accused\u2019s decision to stab the deceased was an emotional, irrational \none. But that, per se, does not mean that the accused was suffering from an \nabnormality of mind caused by mental illness. As the accused told the police, \nshe stabbed the deceased because she was very angry at the deceased for \nthreatening to send her back to the agent. She then tried to get her passport from \nthe agent \u2013 presumably to leave the country. When she was arrested, she denied \nhaving stabbed the deceased, seeking to blame that on two fictitious dark-\nskinned men. Evidently, the accused thought that she might be able to escape \nresponsibility if that lie were believed; and she would also have removed the \ncause of her concern (the deceased, the one who had threatened to send her back \nto the agent).\n72 On the third limb (that the abnormality of mind substantially impaired \nher mental responsibility for her acts and omissions in causing the deceased\u2019s \ndeath), I find that the accused\u2019s mental responsibility for causing the deceased\u2019s \ndeath was not substantially impaired.\n73 The defence relied on the case of Juminem where two foreign domestic \nworkers, aged 18 and 15, successfully relied on the defence of diminished \nresponsibility. In that case, the High Court found that they both suffered from a \ndepressive disorder at the time of the offence which amounted to an abnormality \nof the mind which had significantly affected and impaired their judgment.\nVersion No 2: 18 May 2023 (17:57 hrs)\nPP v Zin Mar Nwe[2023] SGHC 146\n2474 The court accepted that persons suffering from a depressive illness did \nnot necessarily lose their capacity to think or the ability to carry out complex \ntasks (at [32]) and held that the disaffected mood drew the first accused to a \ncourse of action that she would not otherwise have followed \u2013 she was unable \nto distinguish or appreciate irrational urges (such as killing) from more rational \nones (such as complaining to the maid agency). Likewise, the court found that \nthe second accused, who also had low intellectual capacity, had her ability to \nrationalise or will herself out of the crime impaired (at [37]).\n75 In considering Juminem, I am mindful of the observations by the Court \nof"}

The applicant\u2019s principal activity is the wholesale of medical, professional, scientific, and precision equipment distribution, as well as the sales and services of test and measurement equipment in South East Asia. The applicant went into financial distress due to various reasons, such as its business venture in Myanmar, various bad debts owed to it, and high overhead costs in supporting its regional business.', '5\\u2003On 22 October 2022, the applicant first applied for a six-month moratorium under s 64 of the IRDA in HC\/OA 706\/2022 (\u201cOA 706\u201d). On 21 November 2022, the General Division of the High Court (\u201cthe General Division\u201d) heard OA 706 and granted a three-month moratorium after considering the views of some creditors. This moratorium expired on 21 February 2023. The applicant did not seek any extension to this moratorium.', '6\\u2003On 6 April 2023, the applicant filed the present application (ie, OA 350) seeking another moratorium. Mr Sim Hong Meng (\u201cMr Sim\u201d), the sole director of the applicant, explained in his supporting affidavit dated 5 April 2023 that OA 350 was filed late in the day because he intended to secure and finalise a more substantial restructuring plan to propose to the applicant\u2019s creditors \u201cbefore making this application to the court to extend [the applicant]\u2019s moratorium\u201d. 1', 'In addition, Mr Sim stated in the same affidavit that he has heart-related health issues and has been advised to \u201cavoid unnecessary stress\u201d. 2', 'The affidavit also, in broad terms, provided a brief summary of the applicant\u2019s restructuring plan.', '7\\u2003This plan was elaborated on in a Proposal dated 17 April 2023 (\u201cthe Proposal\u201d), which the applicant claims was sent to all of its known creditors, in the following terms:', '(a)\\u2003First, it has successfully obtained Mr Soon\u2019s agreement (stated to be owed S$1.53 million) to acquire all of the applicant\u2019s shares in exchange for Mr Soon waiving his claim for repayment (\u201cthe Debt for Equity Swap\u201d). Mr Soon would then take over full control of the applicant and its operation and use the applicant as a platform to grow his businesses.', '(b)\\u2003Second, it intends to distribute surplus assets arising from the proceeds from the sale of a property and the applicant\u2019s balance inventory. Specifically, it was stated that Mr Sim estimates that the inventory can be sold for approximately S$10,000. The surplus assets will first be used to pay off the debts owed to the preferential creditors, and then to the applicant\u2019s unsecured creditors. This would purportedly reduce the debts of the applicant by around S$2.8m.', '(c)\\u2003Third, as regards the remaining debts that are not paid off by the Debt for Equity Swap and the distribution of surplus assets, it was stated that the applicant intends to make a further payment of a maximum of S$250,000 to all of the applicant\u2019s unsecured creditors pro rata over a period of 48 months in quarterly instalments. This would supposedly provide a recovery of approximately five cents to a dollar against an estimated remaining debt of $4.7m.'"}

OKI also claims to own and operate a nearby seaport facility comprising a warehouse and jetty (the \u201cTerminal\u201d) at Tanjung Tapa Pier. Prior to the construction of this facility, products from the mill had to be shipped out from an inland jetty on barges. The laden barges in turn had to travel some 92km by river in order to load the products onto seagoing vessels. The construction of the Terminal in 2020 obviated the need for the barges to carry the products to the seagoing vessels, as the products could be transported from the mill by truck via the trestle bridge to the jetty, which was located more than 2km off the mainland. From the jetty, the products would be loaded on board the receiving vessels directly. 1', '9\\u2003The Vessel is and was at all material times owned by COSCO Shipping Specialized Carriers Co, Ltd (\u201cCOSCO Shipping\u201d), the claimant in this action. Pursuant to a contract of affreightment dated 6 April 2021 (the \u201cHead COA\u201d), the Vessel was chartered by the claimant to COSCO Shipping Specialized Carriers (Europe) BV (\u201cCOSCO Europe\u201d). By a voyage charterparty also dated 6 April 2021, COSCO Europe sub-chartered the Vessel to OKI. 2', 'As their names suggest, COSCO Shipping and COSCO Europe (collectively, the \u201cCOSCO entities\u201d), are related \u2013 COSCO Europe is majority-owned by another entity which is itself a wholly-owned subsidiary of COSCO Shipping. 3', '10\\u2003On 31 May 2022, at or around 3.20pm local time, the Vessel departed from her berth at the jetty whilst being piloted and with the assistance of two tugs. While manoeuvring away from the jetty, the Vessel made contact with the trestle bridge, allegedly causing about 220m of the bridge to collapse. 4', 'OKI claims to be the owner of the trestle bridge\/jetty and asserts that the Incident has caused it significant loss and damage. I mention as an aside and for completeness that since the occurrence of the Incident, COSCO Shipping and OKI have been unable to agree on security for OKI\u2019s claims, presently estimated by OKI to be approximately US$592 million. 5', 'In contrast, the aggregate limit of COSCO Shipping\u2019s liability under the LLMC 1976, calculated with reference to the tonnage of the Vessel, is approximately US$16 million. 6', '11\\u2003On 4 August 2022, COSCO Shipping commenced the present limitation action, naming OKI and COSCO Europe as defendants, and with the remaining defendants generically described as \u201c[a]ll other persons claiming or entitled to claim damage, loss, expense, indemnity arising out of contact between \u2018LE LI\u2019 (IMO No. 9192674) and jetty\/structure at Tanjung Tapa Pier on or about 31.05.2022\u201d.

SUM 3219 was scheduled to be heard by this court on 12 October 2022. However, OKI filed a notice of intention to contest on 11 October 2022. At the hearing of SUM 3219 on 12 October, Mr Chan Leng Sun SC (\u201cMr Chan\u201d) appeared as instructed counsel for OKI and stated for the record that OKI was challenging the court\u2019s jurisdiction in this limitation action. At Mr Chan\u2019s request (and after hearing COSCO Shipping\u2019s objections), I adjourned SUM 3219 to allow OKI time to formulate its reliefs.', '13\\u2003OKI subsequently filed the present application, HC\/SUM 4238\/2022 (\u201cSUM 4238\u201d), seeking, among others, declarations that: (a) the Singapore courts have no jurisdiction to hear this action; and (b) COSCO Europe is not a proper defendant in the action and should be removed from it. On the first issue of jurisdiction, OKI contends that the service of the originating claim on COSCO Europe\u2019s Singapore solicitors was invalid. The result, OKI argues, is that the requirements for service on a named defendant have not been met and the court therefore has no jurisdiction. On the second issue of COSCO Europe\u2019s status as a named defendant, OKI contends that COSCO Europe is not a \u201cproper\u201d defendant in the limitation action because its claims against COSCO Shipping are not genuine. Unsurprisingly, the COSCO entities deny OKI\u2019s contentions. These two issues form the core of OKI\u2019s application in SUM 4238. I should add that while OKI had also sought a declaration that the originating claim had not been served on it, Mr Chan sought permission to withdraw that prayer since it was not disputed that the originating claim had not been served on OKI. As that prayer of the application was superfluous, I granted OKI permission to withdraw it and reserved all questions of costs occasioned by the withdrawal to be dealt with later.', '14\\u2003I would also mention that since the filing of SUM 4238, arbitration proceedings have been commenced and are currently afoot in Singapore between COSCO Shipping and COSCO Europe, with each entity raising claims against the other in connection with the Incident. 8', 'I elaborate on this development later in this judgment.'"}

However, unlike their letter dated 1 September 2021, this letter was not copied to either Mdm Lakshmi or Mdm Rajeswary. 20', 'According to Mdm Rajeswary, it was therefore only much later on 2 December 2021, the day after she was reinstated as a director, that she discovered that Gokul Vegetarian\u2019s tenancy at 19 Upper Dickson Road had been terminated. This occurred when she returned to 19 Upper Dickson Road with the intention of inspecting Gokul Vegetarian\u2019s records, as she had sought to do just before her wrongful removal as director. 21', 'Upon her arrival at the premises, Mdm Rajeswary was informed that she was trespassing and instructed to leave the premises. When she refused, Mdm Lakshmi called the police, and upon their arrival, Mdm Lakshmi showed them a document identifying a company named Gokul-Raas, in which Mdm Lakshmi but not Mdm Rajeswary was a director, as the tenant of 19 Upper Dickson Road.

I also note that Mdm Lakshmi purported to effect this change unilaterally. That said, there is little doubt as to what Mdm Lakshmi was ultimately trying to do.', '17\\u2003On 23 September 2021, Mdm Lakshmi applied to the Ministry of Manpower (\u201cMOM\u201d) to change the employer of Gokul Vegetarian\u2019s foreign workers from Gokul Vegetarian to Gokul-Raas. 27', 'Mdm Rajeswary was again not notified of this. 28', '18\\u2003On 28 September 2021, the plaintiff\u2019s solicitors served on Gokul Vegetarian a statutory demand for repayment of the $20,000 paid in consideration for shares which were never issued.

To this end, she deposed as follows: 31', '20\\u2003On 27 October 2021, HC\/CWU 198\/2021 was filed and served on Gokul Vegetarian, on the basis that the statutory demand served on 28 September 2021 had not been met. Mdm Lakshmi did not inform Mdm Rajeswary of this. 32', '21\\u2003On 24 November 2021, Mdm Lakshmi filed a further affidavit, in which she, inter alia, attempted to refute Mdm Rajeswary\u2019s allegations that HC\/CWU 198\/2021 was an attempt to derail proceedings in HC\/OS 842 2021 in the following manner: 33', '22\\u2003On 9 November 2021, Mdm Rajeswary\u2019s solicitors wrote to the plaintiff\u2019s solicitors alleging that the $20,000 paid by the plaintiff to Gokul Vegetarian was either a sham loan to Gokul Vegetarian, or a personal loan to Mdm Lakshmi, and so could not properly ground the statutory demand upon which HC\/CWU 198\/2021 is based. In this connection, they expressly alleged that it was \u201cunbelievable that Mr Sharma would be of the view that [Mdm Rajeswary\u2019s] consent for the issuance of new shares would be obtained.\u201d 34', '23\\u2003On 12 November 2021, the plaintiff\u2019s solicitors replied to Mdm Rajeswary\u2019s solicitors. They maintained that the $20,000 was not a sham loan, and that it had been advanced to Gokul Vegetarian \u201cfor the issuance of shares\u201d. 35', 'However, although Mr Sharma had witnessed the objection of Mdm Rajeswary via her proxy at the EGM, the letter made no mention of any belief on his part that she might subsequently change her mind and that her consent might be obtained at some point in the future, nor made any other attempt to refute the allegation in the 9 November 2021 letter.', '24\\u2003On 15 November 2021, Mdm Lakshmi\u2019s solicitors wrote to Mdm Rajeswary\u2019s solicitors resisting her demand that the $20,000 be returned to the plaintiff, and arguing that the money had been applied to the legitimate purpose of paying off the rental arrears which had been the subject of the 1 September 2022 letter of demand issued by 78 Capital Pte Ltd. 36', 'However, this letter neglected to make any mention of the 15 September 2022 notice to vacate which 78 Capital Pte Ltd had given. It also stressed that the issuance of the shares was unrelated to the $20,000 which Mr Sharma caused the plaintiff to pay to Gokul Vegetarian, and denied that the $20,000 was \u201cshare application money\u201d. 37', '25\\u2003In addition to the $20,000 Adcrop debt owing to the plaintiff, Gokul Vegetarian had in the ordinary course of their business incurred debts (\u201ctrade debts\u201d) owing to various regular suppliers (\u201ctrade creditors\u201d), although I am mindful of Mdm Rajeswary\u2019s allegation that some of these trade debts were in fact incurred by Gokul-Raas after it took over the rental premises, 38', 'the trade creditors having been unaware of its seamless takeover of Gokul Vegetarian\u2019s business. Between 9 to 12 November 2021, many of these trade creditors signed deeds assigning their trade debts to the plaintiff, and served notices of assignment on Gokul Vegetarian. 39', '26\\u2003Two aspects of the assignment agreements are particularly noteworthy. First, the price which the plaintiff agreed to pay for the assignment of each debt was typically a sum approximately 90% of the debt in question. For example, the plaintiff would pay $5,659.97 as consideration for the assignment of a $6,288.85 debt, $9,765.19 for the assignment of a $10,850.21 debt, and $2,475.32 for the assignment of a $2,750.36 debt. 40', 'On paper, it would appear that the plaintiff stood to make a profit of around 10% of the value of the original assigned debts. However, as shall be discussed later at [60], the plaintiff was in all likelihood fully aware that it would recover very little to nothing from Gokul Vegetarian. As such, if the plaintiff had in fact paid the agreed consideration for the assigned debts up front, then rather than making a profit, it would very likely have made a loss instead. This would have been attractive to a trade creditor who was concerned about recovering their debt.', '27\\u2003However, the second notable feature of the assignment agreements was that the plaintiff would not in fact pay the agreed consideration upon execution of the deeds of assignment. Instead, such consideration was only to be paid \u201cupon receipt from Gokul Vegetarian Restaurant & Cafe Pte Ltd and\/or liquidator\u201d. 41', 'This meant that it was only if the plaintiff did recover any of the trade debts from Gokul Vegetarian or its liquidator, that it would pay the assignors the sum recovered, capped at the agreed consideration for the assignment. In effect, the plaintiff was able to claim the standing to rely on the trade debts in its winding up application without any risk of loss in the bargain. Such an arrangement was highly advantageous to the plaintiff, and was without doubt the product of a commercially sophisticated mind. Conversely, the assignors derived no financial benefit from this arrangement at all. If they had instead waited to file proof of their debts in liquidation, they would have obtained no less.'"}

This Statement was published by Cherylyn on the defendant\u2019s website, its Facebook page and on the \u201cSingapore Debaters\u201d Facebook group managed by the defendant. 14', 'The ExCo Statement referred to allegations of \u201cinappropriate behaviour\u201d by the Deceased (who was not named in the ExCo Statement but referred to as a \u201cDDI Director\u201d) and certain steps taken by the defendant in response. The salient points in the ExCo Statement are as follows: 15', '(a)\\u2003The Deceased was the creator and moderator of a WhatsApp group named \u201cDDI Darkness\u201d (the \u201cDarkness Chat Group\u201d). The participants were students in the DDI who were invited or added to the Darkness Chat Group by the Deceased.', '(b)\\u2003A number of comments which were sexual in nature were initiated by the Deceased and exchanged among participants of the Darkness Chat Group. These included discussions of sexual acts, sexual preferences and the sexual history of the participants. The Deceased, who was the only adult in the Darkness Chat Group, also led discussions which objectified DDI members who were minors, sharing photographs of such members for participants to comment on their physical characteristics (including genitalia).', '(c)\\u2003In July 2014, the Deceased had pressured a certain member of the Darkness Chat Group to exchange explicit photos through a private chat, which culminated in a \u201cphysical sexual encounter\u201d initiated by the Deceased.', '(d)\\u2003In light of the findings of an \u201caudit report\u201d made by \u201ctwo senior members of the debate community\u201d who were appointed to conduct an audit of the DDI programme (the \u201cAudit Report\u201d), the ExCo decided to permanently ban the Deceased from all events of the defendant (the \u201cBan\u201d), notify the defendant\u2019s partner organisations to prevent the Deceased from entering any competitions or camps co-organised by the defendant and file a police report against the Deceased (collectively, the \u201cDecision\u201d).', '(e)\\u2003The Deceased had been notified of the Ban earlier the same day on 7 August 2018 (the \u201cBan Notification\u201d).', '8\\u2003The defendant also notified Enterprise of the allegations outlined in the ExCo Statement against the Deceased on 7 August 2018. 16', '9\\u2003The then-ExCo members did not convene a general meeting of the members of the defendant to decide whether any action should be taken against the Deceased in light of the findings of the Audit Report. 17', 'It is disputed whether the then-ExCo members voted at an ExCo meeting in or around July 2018 or through other channels and\/or means as to whether any action should be taken against the Deceased. 18', '10\\u2003According to the defendant, it was entitled to rely on the Audit Report which disclosed, among other things, that the Deceased had acted inappropriately towards members of the Darkness Chat Group. These members were students selected by the Deceased after he had identified them as being part of (or potentially part of) the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) community. In addition, there was a specific incident which involved sexual acts being performed by the Deceased in the presence of a member who was a minor. 19', 'This individual was Hanniel Asher Lim Wen Te (\u201cHanniel\u201d). Hanniel testified as a witness for the defendant and confirmed that the incident in question took place sometime in November 2014 after his mother had passed away (the \u201c2014 Incident\u201d). He was then 17 years old. According to Hanniel, the Deceased had arranged to meet him and they subsequently masturbated in each other\u2019s presence inside a toilet cubicle at Pasir Ris East Community Club. Hanniel stated that he only did so upon the Deceased\u2019s request. 20', 'Hanniel\u2019s evidence in relation to the 2014 Incident, as well as other events recounted in his AEIC including the Deceased asking for photographs of Hanniel\u2019s penis and sending Hanniel photographs of his own penis, 21', 'was not challenged.', '11\\u2003It is common ground that the court is not being asked to determine the veracity or the merits of the allegations of inappropriate behaviour against the Deceased. The allegations nonetheless form part of the factual backdrop leading to the Deceased\u2019s decision to commit suicide by jumping to his death from the 14th floor of the apartment block where he resided on the afternoon of 8 August 2018. 22', 'He was 31 years old at the time. I should state at the outset that it is not necessary for me to delve into the detailed evidence adduced during the trial in relation to the allegations of inappropriate behaviour concerning the Deceased, in view of the approach adopted by counsel in the closing submissions for the plaintiff. For the same reason, I do not find it necessary to consider in detail the evidence of each and every witness who testified during the trial. It is evident that the plaintiff\u2019s case is largely premised on arguments on the law and its application to the facts, rather than on any material disputes of fact involving contested evidence from the witnesses.', '12\\u2003I proceed next to outline the key aspects of the parties\u2019 cases below. I will examine them in greater detail under the analysis of the discrete issues.'"}
{"casename":"2023_SGHC_155","fact":"'4\\u2003The following background facts were undisputed. The accused was the Victim\u2019s stepfather. The Victim\u2019s mother (\u201cM\u201d) married the accused in 2016. At that time, the Victim was two years old. The accused and M also had two biological children, namely two twin boys who were born in November 2016 (\u201cthe Twins\u201d). At the material time of the offence, the Victim lived in a rental flat (\u201cthe Flat\u201d) together with the accused, M and the Twins. 1', '5\\u2003It was undisputed that, on 1 September 2018, M left the Flat early in the morning for work and the Victim and the Twins were left in the Flat with the accused. M only returned home that evening at about 8.00pm. The Prosecution\u2019s case was that the events giving rise to the Murder Charge took place during this period while the Victim and the Twins were left in the care of the accused.', '6\\u2003At about 10.00am that day, the accused noticed a puddle of urine outside the toilet of the Flat. The accused became angry because he thought that the Victim, who had already been toilet-trained, was misbehaving. The accused called the Victim over to the toilet and placed her on the toilet bowl. It was not in dispute that the accused, after having placed the Victim on the toilet bowl, applied some force on the Victim\u2019s abdomen with his knuckles. What was in dispute was whether the force applied by the accused on the Victim\u2019s abdomen consisted of punches, as alleged by the Prosecution, or mere nudges to stop the Victim from getting off the toilet bowl, as alleged by the Defence. After this incident at 10.00am, the accused exited the toilet and left the Victim there alone. 2', 'Nothing untoward happened after that incident.', '7\\u2003Later that same day, at about 3.00pm, the Victim indicated to the accused that she wanted to go to the toilet. The accused asked the Victim to go to the toilet to urinate on her own. The Victim went into the toilet and came out a while later. After the Victim came out of the toilet, the accused went into the toilet and saw that the Victim had again urinated on the floor in front of the toilet bowl. The accused became angry and called the Victim over. He questioned the Victim about the urine on the floor. The accused then pushed the Victim on the left shoulder, causing her to fall sideways on the ground. Then, while the Victim was lying on her side on the ground, the accused kicked the Victim\u2019s abdomen twice with his right leg while barefoot. This part of the 3.00pm incident was undisputed as the accused admitted to pushing the Victim and kicking her abdomen twice during that incident. 3', '8\\u2003After the kicks, the accused picked the Victim up and placed her on the toilet bowl. Again, it was not in dispute that, after the accused placed the Victim on the toilet bowl, he applied force on the Victim\u2019s abdomen with his knuckles a few times. However, just as in the case of the 10.00am incident, there was a dispute as to whether the force applied consisted of punches or nudges. 4', '9\\u2003Later that evening at about 8.00pm, M returned home from work. M also bought dinner for the family. The Victim complained of stomach pain after eating a few mouthfuls of rice. Shortly after, the Victim vomited. 5', 'The accused then applied some ointment on the Victim\u2019s abdomen. The accused testified that, as he was applying ointment on the Victim\u2019s abdomen, he noticed that the Victim\u2019s face twitched when he pressed on her right abdominal area. The accused then pressed lightly on the other parts of the Victim\u2019s abdominal area and asked her if it was painful. 6', '10\\u2003The events that occurred thereafter were also largely undisputed.', '11\\u2003In the night of 1 September 2018 and in the early hours of 2 September 2018, the Victim continued to vomit periodically. On 2 September 2018, at about 8.00am, the accused brought the Victim to the toilet where the Victim tried to vomit into the toilet bowl. The accused noticed that the Victim had difficulty vomiting so he used his index finger to ease her vomit. The Victim then vomited and became unconscious. The accused carried the Victim out of the toilet and informed M that she was no longer breathing and asked M to call for an ambulance. M then asked the accused to perform cardiac pulmonary resuscitation (\u201cCPR\u201d) on the Victim and he did so for about 15 minutes until the paramedics arrived at about 9.28am.', '12\\u2003When the paramedics arrived, it was observed that the Victim was no longer breathing and had no pulse. The paramedics also applied a defibrillator on the Victim\u2019s body and noticed that her asystole line was flat, meaning that there was no heartbeat. They also observed that the Victim\u2019s hands and legs were stiff and that rigor mortis had set in.', '13\\u2003The Victim was subsequently conveyed to the Accident and Emergency Department of Ng Teng Fong General Hospital (\u201cthe Hospital\u201d) and arrived there at about 9.44am. On examination, she was not breathing and there was no heartbeat. After resuscitation efforts failed, the Victim was pronounced dead on 2 September 2018 at 10.12am.', '14\\u2003The Hospital reported the death of the Victim to the police, and following initial investigations, the accused was arrested on 3 September 2018 at about 5.00pm.', '15\\u2003On 3 September 2018, the forensic pathologist, Dr Gilbert Lau (\u201cDr Lau\u201d), performed an autopsy on the Victim\u2019s body. On 17 September 2018, Dr Lau issued an autopsy report (\u201cthe Autopsy Report\u201d).', '16\\u2003In the Autopsy Report, Dr Lau certified the cause of the death as: 7', '17\\u2003In the second paragraph of his conclusions, Dr Lau explained in more detail that: 8', '18\\u2003In layman\u2019s language, the cause of death was internal bleeding in the abdominal cavity which arose from injuries in the form of severe disruption of the greater omentum and severe bruising of segments of the small intestines. 9', 'The greater omentum is an apron of fatty tissue well supplied with small blood vessels that drapes over the intestines. 10', '19\\u2003Later in the same paragraph (ie, the second paragraph of his conclusions), Dr Lau noted that the following other injuries were also present: 11', '(a)\\u2003haemorrhage along two proximal segments of the ileum; and', '(b)\\u2003bruising of the mesentery, the retroperitoneum and both iliopsoas muscles.', '20\\u2003Dr Lau further concluded that all the foregoing intra-abdominal injuries, taken together, \u201cwould be consistent with the infliction of blunt force trauma to the abdomen, such as that caused by a fist blow, or multiple fist blows\u201d. 12'"}

Thus, while \nBurswood was largely concerned with section 3(2)(f) of the RECJA, it also had \nregard to s 3(1) of the RECJA and made the following finding on whether it \nwould not be just and convenient to register the judgment with which it was \nconcerned (at [47]): \nThus far, the focus of this judgment has been on the public \npolicy exception laid down in s 3(2)(f) of the RECJA. However, \nwe also think it apt to mention another provision of the RECJA \nwhich was neglected by counsel for both parties but which we \nfound relevant to the resolution of this case \u2013 s 3(1) of the \nRECJA. Whilst s 3(2) of the RECJA lays down various \nrestrictions on the court\u2019s power to order the registration of \nforeign judgments, s 3(1) of the RECJA gives the court the \ngeneral discretion to order the registration of a foreign judgment \nif \u201cin all the circumstances of the case [the court] thinks it is \njust and convenient that the judgment should be enforced in \nSingapore\u201d.

The underlying debt had arisen from an arbitration award obtained on 21 July 2017 by SGI SWE Limited and Schulze Global Investments Holdings LLC (\u201cthe SGI Creditors\u201d). The SGI Creditors are the first plaintiff\u2019s only creditors.', '4\\u2003In March 2021, the plaintiffs commenced Suit 229 against the defendants. This was done with the court\u2019s permission, which was granted under s 144(1) of the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act 2018 (2020 Rev Ed) in HC\/SUM 62\/2021 (\u201cSUM 62\u201d). Importantly for present purposes, in SUM 62, the second plaintiff was also granted authorisation to enter into a funding agreement with the SGI Creditors (\u201cthe Funding Agreement\u201d). Under the Funding Agreement, the SGI Creditors are to indemnify the second plaintiff in respect of all legal fees, costs, and expenses in pursuing Suit 229.', '5\\u2003Focusing on the first defendant for the purposes of this present appeal, the plaintiffs\u2019 case against him in Suit 229 is that he had conspired with one or more of the other defendants to wrongfully cause the first plaintiff\u2019s assets to be sold at an undervalue to the fifth and sixth defendants, which are Sino Africa Trading Limited and Coca-Cola Sabco (East Africa) Limited, respectively. This allegedly caused the first plaintiff to become unable to pay its debts, resulting in its consequent winding up. In this regard, the first defendant was a director of the first plaintiff from 1 September 2004 until he resigned on 1 August 2017. He was also the sole shareholder of the first plaintiff from 30 May 2016 to 27 February 2018.', '6\\u2003In terms of the timeline for Suit 229, general discovery was completed in October 2021. By August 2022, the parties were in the stage of specific discovery and had put together their list of witnesses and estimated the number of trial days required. The parties would have exchanged their respective affidavits of evidence-in-chief (\u201cAEICs\u201d) in April 2023 and trial would have taken place from late June 2023.', '7\\u2003Against this timeline, the first defendant\u2019s application for SFC was filed only on 28 February 2023. The learned AR heard the parties over a number of days in early April 2023 and issued his decision on 12 April 2023. However, on 12 April 2023, the plaintiffs informed the Registry that they intended to amend their Statement of Claim. As a result, the Registry indefinitely deferred the April dates for the parties to exchange their AEICs, and also vacated the June trial dates. The first defendant filed his Notice of Appeal against the learned AR\u2019s decision on 24 April 2023. Accordingly, the circumstances in which I heard HC\/RA 80\/2023 (\u201cRA 80\u201d) were quite different from those that confronted the learned AR below.'"}
{"casename":"2023_SGHC_161","fact":"'4\\u2003By way of background, OC 369 arose from a guarantee that the respondent had signed (\u201cthe Guarantee\u201d). The Guarantee relates to a tenancy agreement that the applicant and Stansfield College Pte Ltd entered into in relation to a property (\u201cthe Property\u201d). In essence, the applicant claims two primary sums from the respondent as a guarantor, namely, (a) $27,000, being the rental arrears from November 2018 to January 2019; and (b) $84,000, being double rent from 1 February 2019 to 20 June 2019 (\u201cthe Double Rent\u201d). The respondent filed her Defence in OC 369 on 24 August 2022. The applicant then filed an application for summary judgment via SUM 2916 on 14 September 2022.', '5\\u2003The DR heard the parties in relation to SUM 2916 on 10 January 2023. He gave his decision on the same day, granting summary judgment for the sum of $29,208.75 in favour of the applicant. For all of the other aspects of the applicant\u2019s claim, including that which related to the Double Rent, the DR granted the respondent unconditional permission to defend. The issue in relation to the Double Rent was whether the respondent had returned vacant possession of the Property by 31 January 2019, which would be a defence against the applicant\u2019s claim for the Double Rent. On this point, the DR held that the respondent had adduced evidence that she had arranged for the keys to the Property to be returned to the applicant by 31 January 2019. In the DR\u2019s view, this meant that the respondent had established a bona fide defence.', '6\\u2003But more significantly, the DR held that even if he were mistaken on this point, he was not convinced that the applicant was entitled to summary judgment for his claim for the Double Rent. This is because there was evidence that the applicant had rejected the respondent\u2019s attempt to return the keys a day earlier on 30 January 2019, on the basis that the respondent did not provide a proper company\u2019s resolution to authorise the courier to return the keys. As such, the DR allowed the respondent to amend her Defence to include the \u201cprevention principle\u201d based on the above facts. The upshot of this principle, as explained in the Appellate Division of the High Court (\u201cAppellate Division\u201d) decision of Ng Koon Yee Mickey v Mah Sau Cheong [2022] 2 SLR 1296 at [80], was that the applicant could no longer insist on its contractual right to the Double Rent when it had prevented the respondent from returning the keys.', '7\\u2003After the DR\u2019s decision on 10 January 2023, the applicant filed a Notice of Appeal in RA 5 on 18 January 2023 against the DR\u2019s decision to grant the respondent unconditional permission to defend. The respondent filed her Amended DCC on 20 January 2023. The PDJ heard the parties in relation to RA 5 on 17 February 2023 and dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal. After the PDJ indicated on 1 March 2023 that he did not require further arguments from the applicant in relation to RA 5, the applicant filed its application to the PDJ on 2 March 2023 seeking permission to appeal against his decision in RA 5. The PDJ dismissed this application on 20 March 2023. The applicant has therefore filed the present application to seek permission to appeal against the PDJ\u2019s decision in RA 5.'"}

She started working in Singapore in around 2003 as a hairdresser at a salon, where she met Henry. It is not seriously disputed that Henry and Chia later entered into a romantic relationship and that Chia moved into Henry\u2019s home, The Tiara, either in 2011 (as claimed by Chia) or in 2013 (as claimed by Judy). This is despite Judy initially asserting that Henry and Chia were never in a \u201ccommitted, loving or romantic relationship\u201d and that Chia was merely Henry\u2019s \u201ccaregiver\u201d. 2', 'The fact remains that: (a) Chia had cohabitated with Henry at The Tiara from at least 2013 until she returned to Malaysia in early 2020; 3', '(b) Henry had given Chia large sums of money and other items which are not being claimed by Henry\u2019s family; 4', '(c) Henry had allowed Chia to use two supplementary credit cards; 5', '(d) Henry had opened joint bank accounts with Chia; (e) Henry had placed some of the Assets in Chia\u2019s name even before he suffered the first stroke; and (f) Henry had sent messages to Chia in 2019 that showed he \u201clove[d] [her] very much\u201d. 6', 'Pertinently, after Henry had suffered the second stroke, Judy asked Chia to return to Singapore to care for him. If Henry merely needed a \u201ccaregiver\u201d, Judy could have easily engaged someone else to do the same.', '7\\u2003In around March 2020, Chia returned to Malaysia to attend to personal matters. She claims she did not return to Singapore until 13 October 2020 because of travel restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the evidence shows that by end 2019, her relationship with Henry was strained and they were speaking about going their separate ways. Henry\u2019s calendar recorded that they quarrelled on 25 and 28 December 2019, that Chia \u201cleft\u201d on 30 December 2019, and that they \u201cbroke off\u201d on 31 December 2019. 7', '8\\u2003Whilst Chia claims she still had a strong relationship with and cared deeply for Henry; 8', 'and that they kept in daily contact and \u201creligiously sent text and audio messages to each other\u201d whilst she was in Malaysia, there is no evidence to support this. Nevertheless, I find Henry continued to have feelings for Chia and was concerned for her, even if Chia did not reciprocate in the same manner or to the same degree. This can be seen from the audio messages between them from July to September 2020, and by Judy\u2019s conduct in reaching out to Chia on 12 October 2020 (after Henry had suffered the second stroke) to ask her to return to Singapore to support Henry. 9', '9\\u2003Chia returned to Singapore on 13 October 2020 and stayed with Henry at The Tiara. Whilst she claims she was concerned for Henry\u2019s well-being, Judy claims the subsequent events showed that Chia \u201cwas busy lining her pockets with Henry\u2019s moneys and assets over [a] short period of less than 6 months\u201d and she completely neglected to take care of Henry. This resulted in Henry losing a tremendous amount of weight and developing paranoia and persecutory delusions against his family. Judy exhibited audio messages from Chia to show that Chia did not care about Henry despite his mental impairment. 10', '10\\u2003The relationship between Chia and Henry\u2019s family came to a head on 6 April 2021. That morning, Henry told Jerrold that he wanted to \u201cjump from\u201d The Tiara. Henry was then admitted to the Institute of Mental Health (\u201cIMH\u201d), and Judy and Jerrold stayed at The Tiara to arrange for the installation of CCTV cameras and locks on the windows, to monitor and ensure Henry\u2019s safety when he returned home. 11', '11\\u2003In the evening of 6 April 2021, Judy and Jerrold were joined at The Tiara by Jordan, Joey and Henry\u2019s ex-wife. Chia also returned to The Tiara accompanied by Ms Tammy Tan (\u201cTammy\u201d) and Mr Li Nanxing (who are Henry\u2019s friends) at Chia\u2019s request. 12', '12\\u2003The CCTV footages of events at The Tiara that evening (\u201cCCTV Footages\u201d) showed Chia apologising to Judy for not taking good care of Henry. Judy was then upset with and berated Chia. 13', 'Thereafter, Henry\u2019s family and Chia agreed that Chia would stop seeing Henry and vacate The Tiara in exchange for being allowed to keep various assets that she claimed to have received from Henry. Chia thus signed a \u201cDeed of Settlement\u201d (\u201c6\/4\/21 Document\u201d) drafted by Joey. I reproduce the salient portions of it: 14', 'Other than the heading \u201cLIST OF ITEMS \u2026\u201d in bold above, the rest of Annexure A was written by Tammy. 15', '13\\u2003While the parties agree that the 6\/4\/21 Document is not enforceable, the plaintiff relies on it to show that Chia had removed $800,000 from Henry\u2019s safe at The Tiara in October 2020. 16'"}

{"casename":"2023_SGHC_164","fact":"'3\\u2003I turn first to the background facts. These facts are common to both RA 71 and RA 70, as well as SUM 1161.', '4\\u2003The dispute between the parties started because of a Specific Credit Facility which the claimant had granted to Lemarc Agromond Pte Ltd (\u201cLAPL\u201d) pursuant to an agreement on 24 May 2022 (\u201cthe Facility Agreement\u201d). The Facility Agreement is governed by Swiss law. By the Facility Agreement, the claimant extended a loan of US$1,500,000 (\u201cthe Facility Sum\u201d) to enable LAPL to repay a debt it owed to Yueyang Guansheng Investment Development Company Limited. In particular, the Facility Agreement provided for interest at the rate of 8.5% per annum on the Facility Sum. The Facility Sum plus interest must be repaid by 31 July 2022.', '5\\u2003The Facility Agreement also provided that the defendant, the defendant\u2019s father (\u201cDaniel\u201d), and one Mr William Rooz are to execute personal guarantees securing LAPL\u2019s indebtedness to the claimant under the Facility Agreement. Thus, the defendant executed a guarantee in favour of the claimant on 24 May 2022 (\u201cthe Guarantee\u201d). The terms of the Guarantee provided that the claimant is entitled to an indemnity from the defendant for costs and expenses incurred in various circumstances. Daniel also executed a guarantee in almost identical terms as the Guarantee (\u201cDaniel\u2019s Guarantee\u201d).', '6\\u2003Pursuant to cl 1 of the Guarantee, the defendant guaranteed the payment of any moneys for which LAPL may be liable to the claimant. This is, however, limited to the aggregate of the principal sum of US$1,500,000 and such further sums comprising interest at 8.5% per annum on the principal amount (\u201cthe Guaranteed Sum\u201d). The Guaranteed Sum was to be payable on the claimant\u2019s written demand.', '7\\u2003In the end, LAPL failed to repay the Facility Sum and interest by 31 July 2022. The claimant issued a written demand to the defendant for payment of the Guarantee Sum on 18 August 2022 (\u201cthe First Demand\u201d). The defendant did not respond to the First Demand. The claimant instructed its solicitors to issue another demand for the Guaranteed Sum on 7 October 2022 (\u201cthe Second Demand\u201d). The defendant also did not respond to the Second Demand.', '8\\u2003On 24 November 2022, the claimant commenced OC 416 against the defendant in Singapore on the basis that he failed, refused, or otherwise neglected to repay the debt that has arisen under the Guarantee.', '9\\u2003The defendant filed his Defence in OC 416 on 19 December 2022. In it, he relied on a letter that LAPL had sent to the claimant three days before on 16 December 2022 (\u201cthe 16 Dec Letter\u201d) and alleged that his liability under the Guarantee had been discharged. The 16 Dec Letter was written by one Mr Chow Wai San (\u201cMr Chow\u201d), who is a director of LAPL. In so far as it is relevant to the present appeals, Mr Chow claimed to have been informed of the following matters.', '(a)\\u2003The claimant and LAPL had entered into a Memorandum of Understanding dated 20 March 2020 (\u201cthe MOU\u201d).', '(b)\\u2003Pursuant to the MOU, the claimant had agreed to provide LAPL with financing for various commodities transactions and shall not unreasonably withhold such financing for a period of five years. In this connection, para 1.1 of the MOU provides as follows: 1', '(c)\\u2003LAPL\u2019s former directors and management had requested financing from the claimant pursuant to the MOU on multiple occasions between September 2020 and July 2022.', '(d)\\u2003The claimant breached para 1.1 of the MOU when it rejected these requests for financing without using its best endeavours to reasonably negotiate with LAPL\u2019s former directors and management on the terms of such financing.', '(e)\\u2003The claimant is liable under the MOU to pay LAPL damages of US$2.25m per year for each full year that the claimant fails to provide financing. In this connection, para 1.2 of the MOU provides as follows: 2', '(f)\\u2003As such, the claimant is liable to pay LAPL a sum of US$4.5m (\u201cthe Alleged Claim\u201d).', '10\\u2003Significantly, the 16 Dec Letter then stated LAPL would be applying this alleged right to damages to set off and fully discharge its debt to the claimant under the Facility Agreement. On this basis, the defendant claimed that his liability under the Guarantee has been discharged. Apart from this defence, it is important that the defendant does not dispute that, if LAPL is liable to the claimant for the Facility Sum plus interest, then the defendant would be liable to the claimant as well for the Guaranteed Sum on the basis of the Guarantee.', '11\\u2003On 16 January 2023, the claimant filed the Summary Judgment Application. In opposition to the application, the defendant\u2019s solicitors filed the defendant\u2019s affidavit in draft under their covering affidavit. In his draft affidavit, the defendant relied on the same reason in the 16 Dec Letter to show cause against the Summary Judgment Application, ie, that the claimant allegedly breached paragraph 1.1 of the MOU by unreasonably withholding financing to LAPL, thereby entitling LAPL to set off the sum it owed under the Facility Agreement and discharging the Guaranteed Sum. To support his defence, the defendant alleged one instance where the claimant had rejected a request by LAPL on 18 November 2021 to finance a trade of Ukrainian corn.', '12\\u2003On 27 January 2023, Daniel commenced HC\/OC 55\/2023 (\u201cOC 55\u201d) against the claimant. Daniel had done this instead of joining the defendant in OC 416 because Daniel enjoyed the benefit of an Indemnity Agreement dated 9 April 2019 (\u201cthe Indemnity Agreement\u201d). By the Indemnity Agreement, LAPL is obliged to bring proceedings against any third party asserting a claim against Daniel. Since LAPL refused to bring an action against the claimant pursuant to the Indemnity Agreement, Daniel commenced OC 55 against the claimant, and joined LAPL as a defendant. Daniel had joined LAPL as a defendant because it is a necessary party to show that the debt under the Facility Agreement had been discharged. The defendant joined OC 55 as a claimant because both him and Daniel gave similarly worded guarantees. As of the hearing of the present appeals, the claimant has yet to be served with OC 55.', '13\\u2003After OC 55 was commenced, the defendant filed the Stay Application on 15 February 2023 seeking, among others, a stay of OC 416 until the determination of OC 55. The Summary Judgment Application and the Stay Application were both heard by the AR on 23 March 2023.', '14\\u2003At the hearing of the Stay Application, the defendant changed his position and requested that the court consolidate OC 416 and OC 55 instead if it was not inclined to grant the stay of OC 416. The defendant further took the position that if consolidation was granted as an alternative relief, then the hearing of the Summary Judgment Application should not proceed on that day.', '15\\u2003The AR dismissed the Stay Application and the alternative relief of consolidation sought by the defendant. The AR then granted the Summary Judgment Application in full after finding that the defendant\u2019s defence was bare, lacking in particulars, and unsubstantiated by evidence. The AR further found that the 16 Dec Letter was insufficient to support the alleged defence and was contradictory both internally and against external documents.', '16\\u2003With the above background facts in mind, I turn to consider SUM 1161 before turning to RA 71 and RA 70.'"}

The 1958 Indenture contains no reference to \u201cLian Chee Kek Buddhist Temple\u201d.', '6\\u2003The defendants are not the original trustees but were appointed in accordance with the provisions of the Trust some years later. Proviso (1) of the 1958 Indenture provides:', 'These provisions thus took the form of a self-perpetuating trust where the trustees are empowered to appoint their successors. The first defendant was duly appointed on 7 March 1988, while the second and third defendants were appointed on 14 August 1991. 6', 'The defendants are reflected on the land register as the proprietors of the Premises, holding as joint tenants in trust. 7', '7\\u2003The 1958 Indenture contains two other provisions that are relevant: 8', '(a)\\u2003Under proviso (2), the Trustees were to \u201cmanage and superintend the management of the said land and premises in accordance with such rules and regulations as the Trustees and their successors in office shall from time to time think expedient\u201d.', '(b)\\u2003Under proviso (3), the Trustees were empowered to take down and remove \u201cthe building now erected on the said land for the purpose of rebuilding the same with premises better\u201d.', '8\\u2003It is helpful to introduce next the second proposed Additional Plaintiff, the Venerable Tjie Giok Sang, who is said to be the Abbot of Lian Chee Kek Buddhist Temple (\u201cAbbot Tjie\u201d). Abbot Tjie has exhibited a letter dated 10 June 1987 by which the then trustees of the Trust first invited him to stay at the Premises. 9', 'Abbot Tjie was not appointed a trustee of the Trust. He, like the first Additional Plaintiff, is a member of the Plaintiff\u2019s management committee. At this juncture, it is helpful to describe briefly, and in neutral terms, how this management committee came about.', '9\\u2003The defendants as Trustees appear to have come to the view sometime prior to 1998 that it would be better to transfer the Premises to the Singapore Buddhist Federation, a registered society and registered charity that has the object of unifying Buddhist institutions and Buddhists in Singapore. The Singapore Buddhist Federation was ready to accept this gift. 10', 'However, before they could make this gift, the Trustees needed to alter the objects of the Trust accordingly, and to that end applied by a letter dated 28 October 1998 to the Commissioner for Charities (the \u201cCommissioner\u201d) to exercise her power under s 24(1)(c) of the version of the Charities Act then in force (currently s 22(1)(c) of the Charities Act). 11', 'In their application, the Trustees relied on the doctrine of cy-pr\u00e8s. The Trustees informed the Commissioner that the Premises were occupied by \u201ca buddhist temple styled \u2018Lian Chee Kok Temple\u2019\u201d, which provided a place for general Buddhist worship not limited to the worship of Kwan Yin. The Trustees stated that the Premises were being underutilised and could be optimised for the advancement of Buddhism in Singapore by a transfer of the Premises to the Singapore Buddhist Federation. The Trustees therefore sought to alter the objects of the Trust and apply the Premises cy-pr\u00e8s under ss 21(1)(c) and 21(1)(e)(iii) of the version of the Charities Act then in force (currently ss 19(1)(c) and 19(1)(e)(iii) of the Charities Act). The Trustees also indicated their desire to gift an adjoining strip of land, described as being beneficially owned by the Trustees, to the Singapore Buddhist Federation, should their application succeed.', '10\\u2003The application ran into a roadblock. Before the Commissioner would consider the Trustees\u2019 application, she required a certified statement of accounts for the previous five years (1993 to 1997) as well as a description of the activities carried out \u201cby the Temple\u201d since 1993. 12', 'The Trustees thus reached out to Abbot Tjie for the necessary accounts and description of activities, but they were not forthcoming. 13', 'It appears that Abbot Tjie did not agree with the decision to transfer the Premises to the Singapore Buddhist Federation. 14', 'The application could not proceed.', '11\\u2003By way of a lawyers\u2019 letter dated 14 August 2000, the defendants as Trustees issued a notice to quit to Abbot Tjie, addressed to Abbot Tjie as a licensee of the Premises. 15', 'Evidently, Abbot Tjie did not leave the Premises and the Trustees did not take further legal action. While I need not and do not reach any conclusion on this point, I observe parenthetically that this raises the question of whether Abbot Tjie remained lawfully on the Premises after having been served a notice to quit.', '12\\u2003On 20 April 2006, an application for the registration of a charity was made by Abbot Tjie. 16', 'It is the defendants\u2019 position that this application was done surreptitiously without their knowledge. They claim to have discovered this application only during these proceedings. 17', 'The Plaintiff\u2019s position is that Abbot Tjie had been forced to make the application on account of the defendants\u2019 wilful refusal to register as a charity since 1991. 18', '13\\u2003The application form named \u201cLian Chee Kek Buddhist Temple\u201d as the organisation seeking registration as a charity and identified the Premises as the address. The form required a declaration as to the nature of the legal entity making the application, providing five options, namely a society; a company limited by guarantee; a quasi-government organisation; a trust; or \u201cothers\u201d. The option \u201cothers\u201d was selected with the annotation \u201cBuddhist Temple\u201d. The date of establishment was given as 21 January 1958, the same date as the 1958 Indenture, and the land occupied for charitable purposes, identified as the Premises, was declared as being \u201cOwned\u201d. The form also required stating the particulars of \u201ccharity trustees\u201d, which was submitted in an attached list. Fifteen persons were named, including Abbot Tjie, but no mention was made of any of the three defendants. 19', 'It appears (but I need not and do not make a finding to this effect given the stage at which these appeals arise) that the defendants did not know about or approve this application. It also appears that the Commissioner proceeded to register the Plaintiff as a charity based on the constitution and management committee furnished by Abbot Tjie in this application, even though previous correspondence in 1998 had come from the defendants\u2019 lawyers. The original constitution of the Plaintiff submitted by Abbot Tjie did not make any reference to the 1958 Indenture. Apparently, it was the Commissioner that required the addition of a clause expressly referring to the 1958 Indenture in the constitution, and the Commissioner who provided Abbot Tjie with a copy of the 1958 Indenture in response to his initial application. 20', '14\\u2003 The Plaintiff\u2019s constitution appears to be based upon a typical constitution for an association. It briefly sets out the core objectives of the Plaintiff, but focuses in the main on membership conditions, rights, and fees, and management procedures, such as meetings and the election of office bearers. 21', 'In particular, provisions are set out for the election of \u201ctrustees\u201d by a general meeting of the members of the Plaintiff and for the vacation of that office upon the occurrence of specified events. \u201cTrustee\u201d is not defined in the Plaintiff\u2019s constitution, but clause 37 specifies their role, stating that \u201c[i]f the Temple at any time acquires any immovable property, such property shall be vested in Trustees subject to a declaration of trust\u201d. Although the drafting is not a model of clarity, it also appears that the general meeting may consider proposals to remove trustees. 22', '15\\u2003Abbot Tjie\u2019s application was granted on 19 June 2006 and the Plaintiff was thereafter registered as a charity. 23', 'The defendants are not members of the Plaintiff.', '16\\u2003Abbot Tjie then appears to have proceeded to run the Plaintiff and manage the Premises without reference to the Trustees. This extended to proceeding with additions and alterations to the Premises between 2017 and 2019 without the approval of the Trustees. The Urban Redevelopment Authority (\u201cURA\u201d) appears to have picked up on the absence of consent on the part of the registered proprietors of the Premises when the Plaintiff sought approval of the renovation works in 2020. By letter dated 12 January 2021, the URA required the Plaintiff to provide this consent, noting that the Premises were not owned by the President of the Plaintiff, who had been erroneously declared as the owner of the Premises in the Plaintiff\u2019s application for approval. 24', '17\\u2003Three days later, the Plaintiff, by its solicitors Wee Swee Teow LLP (\u201cWST\u201d), wrote to the defendants requesting them to sign and return the requisite consent. 25', 'There was no response. WST wrote again by a letter dated 8 March 2021, this time requesting that the defendants sign a deed of retirement as trustees and stating the Plaintiff\u2019s intention to appoint new trustees in their place, presumably being Abbot Tjie and others from his management committee. This letter accused the defendants of being disinterested in the activities of the Plaintiff and warned that legal proceedings would be commenced to remove the defendants as trustees should they continue to fail to respond. 26', 'When there was no response, the Plaintiff then convened a general meeting on 26 June 2021 and passed resolutions purporting to remove the defendants as trustees pursuant to and under the terms of the Plaintiff\u2019s constitution, appointing Abbot Tjie and two other members of the management committee as new trustees. 27', 'The defendants were not asked to attend this general meeting and the resolutions were passed in their absence.', '18\\u2003On 30 June 2021, the Plaintiff filed this originating summons seeking declarations that the removal of the defendants as trustees and the appointment of the new trustees on 26 June 2021 were valid and effectual, and seeking consequentially a declaration vesting the Premises in these new trustees.'"}

{"casename":"2023_SGHC_178","fact":"'4\\u2003I begin with the background facts, which apply to all four appeals. On or around 28 February 2019, the claimant agreed to rent its construction equipment (\u201cthe Equipment\u201d) to Global Explorer Sdn Bhd (\u201cGlobal Explorer\u201d), who was a subcontractor of the first defendant. The Equipment was loaded on board the barge MUTIARA 280 (\u201cthe Barge\u201d) and remains on board to the present day. The second defendant is the owner of the Barge.', '5\\u2003Later, in 2021, Global Explorer became involved in a project known as the Yunlin Wind Power Project in Taiwan (\u201cthe Taiwan Project\u201d). The Taiwan Project required the use of the Equipment, especially the carousel and tensioner. As such, the claimant wrote a proposal on 2 February 2021 (\u201cthe Proposal\u201d) to Global Explorer in respect of a purchase order for the rental of the carousel and tensioner. A finalised purchase order was then made on 8 February 2021 (\u201cthe Purchase Order\u201d).', '6\\u2003The two defendants became involved in this dispute with the claimant due to the Taiwan Project. The first defendant became involved as it had subcontracted Global Explorer to provide it with cable storage solutions, and this caused Global Explorer to rent the claimant\u2019s carousel and tensioner to the first defendant. As for the second defendant, it had chartered the Barge to the claimant for the duration of the Taiwan Project. This was so that the claimant could place its Equipment on the Barge.', '7\\u2003On 7 July 2022, Global Explorer entered into liquidation in Malaysia. The claimant terminated the Proposal on 14 July 2022. Pursuant to the terms of the Proposal, the claimant was entitled to immediate possession of the carousel and tensioner. As such, the claimant wrote to the first and second defendants on 14 July 2022 and 22 July 2022, respectively. The claimant made known in its letters that it was the owner of the Equipment, and that no one should operate the Equipment without its express permission. However, on 19 July 2022, the claimant was notified that the second defendant had exercised a purported lien over the Equipment due to Global Explorer\u2019s failure to pay charter hire fees to it.', '8\\u2003On 22 August 2022, the claimant, once again, wrote to the defendants to inform them that it owned the Equipment, and demanded their return. However, the defendants did not do so. Instead, the first defendant continued to use the carousel and tensioner for the purposes of the Taiwan Project. The second defendant also continued to maintain its purported lien over the Equipment. This state of affairs remains the status quo at the time of the hearing before me.', '9\\u2003The claimant therefore commenced HC\/OC 236\/2022 (\u201cOC 236\u201d) against the defendants (being the main action from which these present appeals arise). The claimant\u2019s pleaded case in OC 236 is that both defendants have committed the torts of conversion, trespass, and detinue. The claimant also claims in OC 236 that the first defendant is liable for unjust enrichment.', '10\\u2003The defendants have mounted several arguments in their pleaded defences against the claimant\u2019s claims in OC 236. In particular, the first defendant has said that, among others, one Mr Peter Parkinson (\u201cMr Parkinson\u201d), acting on behalf of Global Explorer, represented to them that Global Explorer owned and had good title to the Equipment. Mr Parkinson is a director of Global Explorer and is also the sole director of the claimant. Similarly, the second defendant has also said that the claimant ought to be estopped from asserting ownership over the Equipment because Mr Parkinson had, by his conduct, represented that Global Explorer was the owner of the Equipment. Importantly for present purposes, both defendants have brought counterclaims against the claimant. In this regard, the first defendant has counterclaimed against the claimant for its losses suffered as a result of the injunction obtained by the claimant on 2 September 2022 in HC\/SUM 3259\/2022, which prevented the defendants from operating the Equipment.

{"casename":"2023_SGHC_180","fact":"'13\\u2003We now set out the facts of this appeal. Dr Wee was registered as a medical practitioner on 26 April 1977 and practised as a general practitioner thereafter. At the material time, he was carrying on his practice at Wee\u2019s Clinic & Surgery located at Blk 418 Bedok North Avenue 2, Singapore.', '14\\u2003On 28 October 2016, the SMC received a complaint from the Ministry of Health relating to the manner in which Dr Wee prescribed benzodiazepines and codeine-containing cough mixtures. On 25 April 2018, the SMC issued a Notice of Complaint to Dr Wee, which stated that a Complaints Committee (the Committee\u201d) had been appointed and that the Committee had directed an investigation to be conducted. In the Notice of Complaint, the SMC also invited Dr Wee to submit a written explanation addressing, among other things, the clinical basis for his prescriptions of codeine-containing cough mixtures and benzodiazepines to certain patients. Dr Wee sent his letter of explanation to the SMC on 20 June 2018 (the \u201cLetter of Explanation\u201d). We say more about the contents of the Letter of Explanation later. After considering the Letter of Explanation, the Committee referred Dr Wee to the DT for a formal inquiry.', '15\\u2003On 9 February 2021, the SMC served a Notice of Inquiry on Dr Wee. The Notice of Inquiry set out a total of 50 charges against Dr Wee \u2013 25 of these charges alleged that Dr Wee had conducted himself in a manner that constituted an intentional and deliberate departure from standards observed or approved by members of the profession of good repute and competency, such that he was guilty of professional misconduct under s 53(1)(d) of the MRA. The remaining 25 charges were \u201calternate\u201d charges, which alleged that Dr Wee\u2019s conduct amounted to such serious negligence that it objectively constituted an abuse of the privileges of being a registered medical practitioner, and that Dr Wee was accordingly guilty of professional misconduct under s 53(1)(d) of the MRA.', '16\\u2003The SMC ultimately decided to proceed on 20 of the alternate charges. These charges concerned ten patients who had consulted Dr Wee on various occasions between 2009 and 2016. In respect of each patient, Dr Wee was alleged to have (a) inappropriately prescribed codeine-containing cough mixtures or benzodiazepines; and (b) failed to keep adequate patient medical records. Accordingly, as already noted, the proceeded charges against Dr Wee comprised ten Inappropriate Prescription charges and ten Inadequate Records charges.', '17\\u2003In relation to the Inappropriate Prescription charges, Dr Wee was alleged to have prescribed medicines to his patients at such frequencies and\/or in such quantities as breached the Ministry of Health\u2019s letter dated 9 October 2000 on the Sale and Supply of Cough Mixtures Containing Codeine (the \u201cCodeine Guidelines\u201d), and the Ministry of Health\u2019s Administrative Guidelines on the Prescribing of Benzodiazepines and Other Hypnotics dated 14 October 2008 (the \u201cBenzodiazepines Guidelines\u201d). The Codeine Guidelines provide that codeine-containing cough mixtures are not to be sold to the same patient within four days, while the Benzodiazepines Guidelines provide that benzodiazepines are not to be prescribed for a cumulative period longer than eight weeks.', '18\\u2003For present purposes, it suffices for us to reproduce the wording of one of the Inadequate Records charges, and one of the Inappropriate Prescription charges:', '19\\u2003In addition, we set out below the salient facts relating to the proceeded charges, as contained in the Agreed Statement of Facts (\u201cAgreed Facts\u201d). The Agreed Facts stated that Dr Wee \u201cwas aware and\/or ought to have been aware\u201d that five of his patients (identified as P1, P2, P3, P11 and P13) were dependent on codeine-containing cough mixtures. The Agreed Facts did not contain a similar statement in respect of the remaining patients (identified as P4, P5, P9, P10 and P15):', '20\\u2003Dr Wee pleaded guilty to the above charges and was convicted accordingly. Dr Wee also consented to five charges being taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. These charges related to his failure to keep adequate medical records for another five patients (the \u201cTIC charges\u201d). The remaining charges set out in the Notice of Inquiry were withdrawn by the SMC.', '21\\u2003The reasons for the DT\u2019s decision can be found in Singapore Medical Council v Dr Wee Teong Boo [2022] SMCDT 1 (the \u201cGD\u201d). We summarise them below.', '22\\u2003As we have mentioned, the DT applied the sentencing framework set out in Wong Meng Hang and found that Dr Wee\u2019s culpability was medium. The DT observed that Dr Wee had inappropriately prescribed medication to a total of ten patients and did not appear to have any structured treatment plan for them. His offending may have intensified the addictions of his patients who had underlying drug dependency issues, and the inappropriate prescriptions had been frequent and issued over an extended period of time. That being said, the DT noted that Dr Wee had not exploited his patients for profit and had been convicted of conduct amounting to serious negligence rather than intentional and deliberate misconduct. Accordingly, the DT declined to find that Dr Wee\u2019s culpability was high: GD at [21].', '23\\u2003As for the level of harm caused by the offences, the DT accepted the SMC\u2019s submission that the harm caused by Dr Wee\u2019s misconduct was moderate: GD at [23]. The SMC did not appeal against the DT\u2019s finding on the level of harm caused.', '24\\u2003Applying the matrix set out at [8] above, the DT accordingly found that the indicative sentencing range for each of the Inappropriate Prescription charges was a suspension of one to two years: GD at [25]. As for the appropriate starting point, the DT found that a starting point of 12 months\u2019 suspension was appropriate: GD at [29].', '25\\u2003Turning to the relevant offender-specific factors, the DT considered Dr Wee\u2019s seniority in the medical profession to be an aggravating factor, as a higher degree of trust and confidence would have been reposed in him. On the other hand, the DT considered Dr Wee\u2019s cooperation with investigations and his expression of remorse to be mitigating factors. The DT also noted that Dr Wee\u2019s conduct did not appear to be motivated by financial gain: GD at [28].', '26\\u2003All things considered, the DT found that it was not necessary to amend the starting point of 12 months\u2019 suspension for most of the Inappropriate Prescription charges. The DT accepted the SMC\u2019s submission that an uplift of six months was warranted in respect of P3, P11 and P13, given the high number of inappropriate prescriptions in those cases, as well as in relation to P10, given the long duration of the inappropriate prescription in that case: GD at [29]. The DT accordingly sentenced Dr Wee for the Inappropriate Prescription charges as follows:', '27\\u2003The DT found that a suspension of three months was appropriate for each of the Inadequate Records charges, save for the alternate 7th charge for which a suspension of four months was warranted: GD at [31]\u2013[32]. The SMC did not appeal against the sentence imposed in respect of the Inadequate Records charges.', '28\\u2003In calibrating the aggregate sentence, the DT took into account the fact that Dr Wee had five TIC charges. The DT considered it appropriate to run the sentences for the alternate 2nd charge (12 months\u2019 suspension) and the alternate 19th charge (18 months\u2019 suspension) consecutively: GD at [36]. The DT noted that, however, it was undisputed that there had been an inordinate delay in prosecution, as 2 years and 11 months had lapsed between the time of the Ministry of Health\u2019s complaint and the issuance of the Notice of Inquiry. The DT therefore reduced the aggregate sentence by one-third to arrive at a final sentence of 20 months\u2019 suspension: GD at [37] and [41].'"}

Mr Deniyal oversaw day-to-day operations at Keppel Yard and was entitled to a degree of autonomy in carrying out this function. Although Mr Deniyal was not Mr Niew\u2019s equal, the evidence shows that in addition to his aforementioned duties, Mr Deniyal was also held out to third parties as a representative of the Mapo Group and was involved in ensuring that clients paid for work carried out at Keppel Yard. 40', 'Mr Niew also conceded that, as MMPL was a common contractor, Mr Deniyal would have oversight over MMPL workmen in Keppel Yard. 41', 'Mr Niew\u2019s own testimony was that MMPL had at least two projects in Keppel Yard which involved Mr Deniyal. 42', '16\\u2003It is undisputed that Mr Niew effectively exercised control over MEPL and MMPL and was the driving force behind the Mapo Group. 43', 'Mr Niew had full control over finance and business development. 44', 'Mr Niew decided what salaries and bonuses to give 45', 'and the companies\u2019 accounts department reported to Mr Niew. 46', 'However, Mr Niew conceded that Mr Deniyal\u2019s approval was required before the companies made large purchases or applied for bank loans. 47', 'To oversee the companies, Mr Niew would periodically check in on the Mapo Group\u2019s operations at the different shipyards, but mainly worked from the main office. 48', 'According to Mr Niew, he was responsible for contributing the start-up capital of MEPL and MMPL. Both companies remain substantially indebted to him. 49', '17\\u2003Both parties provide completely different accounts of the events leading up to the deterioration in their relationship. Mr Deniyal\u2019s version starts with a long period of blind faith in Mr Niew during which he was largely oblivious to the administration of the Mapo Group, followed by a series of confrontations that culminated in the termination of his employment.

The three men engaged in long discussions to ensure that MMPL would be commercially viable. In these discussions, Mr Niew expressed his gratitude towards Mr Deniyal and Mr Ong and thanked them for their contributions. Mr Niew stated his intention that the three would become the directors and shareholders of MMPL and work together for its success. 72', 'Mr Niew granted Mr Deniyal his stake in MMPL as a reward for his hard work and to provide a further incentive (by way of profit sharing) for him to remain loyal to MMPL. 73', '28\\u2003Mr Niew denies having engaged in any discussions about the incorporation of MMPL, which was his sole initiative. Mr Niew had identified Mr Ong as a capable candidate for the role of general manager and had only sought him out after MMPL was already incorporated. When Mr Ong was made a director and shareholder, Mr Deniyal was also gifted 10% of the shares and appointed a director. According to Mr Niew, this was \u201ca matter of convenience\u201d and because Mr Niew regarded Mr Deniyal as a valuable employee who Mr Niew wanted to reward and retain in the long term. Mr Deniyal was appointed a nominal director on the \u201cunderstanding\u201d that Mr Deniyal would \u201ccontinue in his usual role and would not be involved in the management of MMPL\u201d. 74', '29\\u2003Mr Ong testified that he was already employed as MEPL\u2019s general manager prior to MMPL\u2019s incorporation.

Mr Deniyal had noticed a growing rift between Mr Niew and Mr Ong, and when prompted, Mr Ong shared his concerns regarding Mr Niew\u2019s handling of the accounts prior to leaving MMPL. 77', '32\\u2003Mr Niew denies having had any disagreement with Mr Ong. Instead, Mr Ong had resigned because he received a job offer and was relocating to the People\u2019s Republic of China. It was Mr Ong\u2019s choice to transfer his 20% shareholding in MMPL to Mr Deniyal. 78', 'Mr Niew\u2019s version of events is corroborated by Mr Ong, who made no mention of any disagreements regarding the handling of accounts. 79', '33\\u2003Nevertheless, any possible revelation evidently did not shake Mr Deniyal\u2019s confidence in Mr Niew at this time, as he continued to \u201cplace full trust\u201d in Mr Niew and focused only on the operational side of the Mapo Group. 80', '34\\u2003Mr Deniyal\u2019s interest in the accounts of MEPL and MMPL was only piqued in early 2018 when he noticed that invoices for two Malaysian companies, YR Engineering & Trading and YR Marine Engineering Sdn Bhd (the \u201cMalaysian Companies\u201d), were not reflected in the list of unpaid invoices. When Mr Deniyal asked Ms Cindy, she told him that the money owed under the invoices had been paid to Mr Niew in cash. 81', 'It was then that Mr Deniyal formed the view that he ought to have been provided with monthly accounts as a director. However, despite repeated oral requests for the documents being rejected by Mr Niew, Mr Deniyal eventually accepted that obtaining the documents was unnecessary as he was persuaded that Mr Niew could be trusted to maintain proper accounts and manage the companies fairly. 82', 'According to Mr Niew, Mr Deniyal did not request any documents and Mr Niew did not make any representations or assurances in relation thereto. 83', '35\\u2003Mr Deniyal was apparently removed as a cheque signatory for MEPL in 2018. 84', '36\\u2003According to Mr Deniyal, the parties fell out in mid-2019 after he confronted Mr Niew about the perceived irregularities in the management of MEPL and MMPL and demanded an explanation for why he was not given his directors\u2019 remuneration. Being dissatisfied with Mr Niew\u2019s response, Mr Deniyal sought legal counsel. 85', 'Mr Niew denies that any such confrontation took place. 86', '37\\u2003In December 2019, on behalf of Mr Deniyal, Rajah & Tann formally demanded that MEPL and MMPL disclose certain financial documents and information (the \u201cR&T Demand Letter\u201d). 87', 'In January 2020, on behalf of MEPL and MMPL, Tang & Partners requested time to locate the documents. 88', 'By a letter dated 5 February 2020, Rajah & Tann stipulated a deadline of 12 February 2020, failing which Mr Deniyal would commence legal proceedings. 89', 'Documents were eventually disclosed by correspondence from Eldan Law, who currently represent Mr Niew, dated 2 March 2020, 12 June 2020, 26 June 2020, and 30 October 2020. 90', 'Mr Deniyal maintains that these disclosures were piecemeal and selective.

Mr Deniyal claims that this was a calculated move by Mr Niew to deny Mr Deniyal access to the financial documents of the companies. 93', 'Mr Deniyal also testified that his phone lines and access cards were all terminated the day after the R&T Demand Letter was sent, denying him access to Keppel Yard. This claim is supported by a contemporaneous letter from Rajah & Tann dated 20 January 2020. 94', '39\\u2003Mr Niew explains that Mr Deniyal had been dismissed for good reasons. The notices of termination state that Mr Deniyal had failed to report to work and failed to collect his salary despite repeated reminders. 95', 'Mr Niew elaborates that business at Keppel Yard declined in 2019. Mr Deniyal was therefore requested to report to the main office on a more regular basis. However, Mr Deniyal did not do so. 96', 'According to Mr Niew, Mr Deniyal came down sporadically to hand over necessary documents or only when expressly instructed to do so. Mr Deniyal was formally dismissed after he started to entirely neglect reporting to work in November 2019 and became uncontactable. 97', 'Mr Deniyal initially denied being absent from work or being uncontactable, explaining that although he did not report to the main office as requested, he remained stationed at Keppel Yard. 98', 'However, Mr Deniyal later admitted that he had refused to report to work sometime in end December 2019 or early January 2020 after an argument with Mr Niew regarding the R&T Demand Letter. 99', '40\\u2003On 2 April 2021, following an extraordinary general meeting, Ms Celesty was appointed a director and made a shareholder of both MEPL and MMPL. Although Mr Deniyal had been given notice of the meetings, he did not attend them as he considered Ms Celesty\u2019s appointment a foregone conclusion due to Mr Niew\u2019s controlling stake.

The full text of ST 3.3 and ST 3.4 are set out in [26] below.', '15\\u2003According to the claimant, it was agreed on 20 October 2022 that pursuant to ST 3.3 of the LFA, the defendant\u2019s lawyers would prepare a written opinion on whether the Draft Settlement Agreement was fair and reasonable. The defendant denied any such agreement.', '16\\u2003It was not disputed that the defendant\u2019s lawyers did commence preparing an opinion as to whether the Draft Settlement Agreement was fair and reasonable.

An email dated 21 November 2022 from the defendant\u2019s lawyers to the claimant stated that the defendant had taken legal advice and that it was not required under ST 3.3 to instruct its lawyers to opine on whether the Draft Settlement Agreement was fair and reasonable. 4', '17\\u2003In summary, the defendant\u2019s reasons for its position that ST 3.3 and ST 3.4 did not apply to the Draft Settlement Agreement were as follows:', '(a)\\u2003ST 3.3 and ST 3.4 concerned the settlement of \u201cClaims\u201d or \u201cProceedings\u201d, which (as defined) would include recognition and enforcement proceedings only if the claimant had agreed to fund such proceedings in accordance with the terms of the LFA.', '(b)\\u2003The Draft Settlement Agreement did not relate to the defendant\u2019s claim against Co1 but related to the enforcement of the Final Award against Co1. It fell within the meaning of \u201cProceedings\u201d only if the claimant had agreed to fund the enforcement proceedings in accordance with the terms of the LFA. Pursuant to GT 8.1 and GT 8.2 of the LFA, the claimant had to notify the defendant and its lawyers in writing that it was prepared to fund the enforcement proceedings. The claimant did not give any such notice to the defendant and its lawyers. Consequently, the Draft Settlement Agreement was not a settlement of \u201cthe Proceedings\u201d within the meaning of ST 3.3.', '18\\u2003The claimant disagreed with the defendant and on 2 March 2023, the claimant filed OA 189 seeking, in substance, specific performance of ST 3.3.

The defendant relied on the arbitration agreement under GT 14 of the LFA. GT 14.1 provided that any dispute arising out of the LFA \u201cwhich is not subject to Specific Term 3.3 and 3.4\u201d must be resolved in accordance with GT 14. GT 14 provided for disputes to be resolved by way of good faith endeavours, mediation (if the parties so agree), and arbitration (if the dispute remained unresolved). The relevant provisions of GT 14 are set out in full in [25] below.', '20\\u2003On 12 April 2023, the AR dismissed the defendant\u2019s application for a stay of proceedings. The issue before the AR was whether the anterior question as to whether ST 3.3 and ST 3.4 applied to the Draft Settlement Agreement fell within the scope of GT 14 or whether it had been carved out from GT 14. The AR held that the dispute as to whether the defendant should be compelled to obtain a written opinion from its lawyers in accordance with ST 3 had been carved out from the arbitration agreement in GT 14.', '21\\u2003On 18 April 2023, the defendant lodged the present appeal against the AR\u2019s decision.'"}

{"casename":"2023_SGHC_191","fact":"the facts of this case. \n48 Before I undertake a more detailed analysis of s 73C(1) of the SCJA, it \nwould be useful to briefly set out the background to the civil restraint order \nregime. This regime was introduced by way of the Supreme Court of Judicature \n(Amendment No. 2) Act 2018 (Act 46 of 2018). I reproduce the explanation by \nthe then-Senior Minister of State for Law (Singapore Parliamentary Debates, \nOfficial Report (2 October 2018), vol 94 (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai, Senior \nMinister of State for Law)): \nThe policy intention behind these amendments is \u2026 to allow \nthe courts to have, and to be able to take, a more nuanced \napproach in terms of the orders that they make in managing \nthe different levels of culpability of the vexatious litigants. And \nthis allows the judges to have more regard to the individual \ncircumstances of each case and to make those distinctions.\n\u2026 in terms of how and when these orders are to be applied, it \nwill be for the courts to carefully consider all the facts and \ncircumstances of each case before exercising their discretion on \nwhether to do so or not \u2026 the jurisprudence in this area must \nultimately be left to be developed through the exercise of \nprincipled discretion by our judges, based on the actual facts \nand the context before them \u2026\n\u2026\nIt may be helpful to consider that these restraint orders have in \nfact been applied in jurisdictions like the UK \u2026 The factors I \nVersion No 1: 13 Jul 2023 (12:30 hrs)\nThe National University of Singapore\nv Ten Leu Jiun Jeanne-Marie[2023] SGHC 191\n21believe are clear, and they have been considered in previous \ncases also in the UK.

{"casename":"2023_SGHC_192","fact":"'3\\u2003I begin with the background facts. The claimant is the son of a brother of the late Mr Ho Kok Kwong (\u201cthe Deceased\u201d). The defendant is another brother of the Deceased. The claimant is therefore the defendant\u2019s nephew by virtue of the claimant\u2019s father being the brother of the defendant and the Deceased. Both the claimant and the defendant are beneficiaries of the estate of the Deceased.', '4\\u2003The Deceased passed away in unfortunate circumstances. On 2 July 2020, officers from the National Environment Agency discovered the skeletal remains of the Deceased in his flat (\u201cthe Flat\u201d). It was determined through forensic tests that the Deceased had died about nine years ago. Tragically, because the Deceased\u2019s body had laid undiscovered for many years, it had decomposed to such an extent that the police pathologist was not able to determine the cause of death. Following further investigations, the police determined that there was no foul play involved in the Deceased\u2019s death. On 13 August 2020, the police passed the keys to the Flat to the defendant.', '5\\u2003The Deceased had died intestate. On 13 August 2020, the defendant was informed, by a letter from the claimant\u2019s then-solicitors, that the claimant intended to apply for the letters of administration of the Deceased\u2019s estate (\u201cthe Estate\u201d). On 14 August 2020, the defendant replied, by way of a letter from his then-solicitors, that he has a prior right to the grant of such letters of administration. On 20 August 2020, the claimant replied that he was agreeable to the defendant being appointed as administrator of the Estate, provided that the claimant be joined as a co-administrator. On 31 August 2020, the defendant informed the claimant that he, as the surviving sibling of the Deceased, has the right to be the sole administrator of the Estate and did not require the claimant\u2019s consent to do this.', '6\\u2003Against these circumstances, the defendant applied to the Family Justice Courts on 11 September 2020 to be the sole administrator of the Estate (\u201cthe LA Application\u201d). However, so as to ensure that letters of administration would not be granted without notice given to him, the claimant filed caveat FC\/CAVP 80\/2020 on 14 August 2020 against the grant of letters of administration. The claimant later filed caveat FC\/CAVP 8\/2021 on 8 February 2021. Between September 2020 and March 2021, the claimant and the defendant continued to argue about the defendant\u2019s right to be an administrator of the Estate.', '7\\u2003The parties\u2019 dispute in relation to the LA Application led to a court mediation on 31 March 2021. The mediation culminated in a Settlement Agreement which was entered into on 1 June 2021 between the claimant, the defendant, and the Deceased\u2019s nieces, Ms Lam Joon Lan, and Ms Lam Yuen Har (\u201cthe Settlement Agreement\u201d). Broadly speaking, the effect of the Settlement Agreement is for the claimant to withdraw the two caveats he had lodged, which would then enable the defendant to proceed with the LA Application to be the sole administrator of the Estate. The claimant and his brother, Mr Ho Chee Sin (\u201cHCS\u201d), are also to donate their respective shares of the Estate to a charity. The defendant is then to make a similar donation in a matching amount. I will go through the clauses of the Settlement Agreement in detail later, but it suffices to say that the parties\u2019 dispute centres on the interpretation and application of these clauses.', '8\\u2003On 7 June 2021, the claimant withdrew the two caveats he had lodged. On 8 August 2021, the defendant was granted the letters of administration as the sole administrator of the Estate. However, on 9 March 2022, the claimant commenced FC\/OSP 10\/2022 (\u201cOSP 10\u201d) against the defendant in the latter\u2019s capacity as administrator of the Estate. In brief, in OSP 10, the claimant sought an order for the defendant, as the administrator of the Estate, to file and serve an affidavit on the steps that he had taken to collect, bring in, and distribute the Estate. The claimant commenced OSP 10 because he felt that the defendant did not provide the beneficiaries with accurate information about the administration progress and distribution timeline. OSP 10 was largely dismissed by the Family Justice Courts on 1 November 2022, save for the claimant\u2019s prayer that the defendant makes available a video recording and contents of several laptops for inspection and the taking of copies by the beneficiaries.', '9\\u2003On 28 December 2022, the defendant, acting as the sole administrator of the Estate, paid $154,019.17 each to the claimant and HCS. On 30 December 2022, the claimant and HCS arranged for two cashier\u2019s orders, each of the amount $154,019.17, to be issued in favour of Sian Chay Medical Institution (\u201cSCMI\u201d), which is a registered Institution of Public Character. On the same day, SCMI wrote a letter to the claimant and HCS to acknowledge receipt of the sum of $308,038.34 through the two cashier\u2019s orders issued in its favour (\u201cthe Acknowledgement Letter\u201d). The claimant provided the Acknowledgement Letter to the defendant by way of an email dated 6 January 2023. When the defendant did not respond, the claimant followed up with a letter dated 13 February 2023. However, the defendant was not satisfied with the Acknowledgement Letter. As such, by way of letters dated 14 February 2023 and 16 February 2023 from his solicitors to the claimant, the defendant requested the official receipts issued by SCMI to prove that the sum of $308,038.34 was duly received.', '10\\u2003On 20 February 2023, the claimant commenced HC\/OC 112\/2023 (\u201cOC 112\u201d) against the defendant, which is the underlying claim in relation to the present application. After the parties filed their Statement of Claim and Defence respectively, on 12 May 2023, the claimant filed the present application for summary judgment.'"}
{"casename":"2023_SGHC_193","fact":"'5\\u2003The Applicant and the Respondent were friends at the material time. On or about 5 January 2022, the Applicant and the Respondent entered into an oral agreement for the Applicant to sell and for the Respondent to purchase the Watches. The purchase price of $28,000 for the Rolex Watch was paid immediately, while the purchase price of $16,000 for the Hublot Watch was to be paid in three months or, at the Respondent\u2019s option, by monthly instalments. The Respondent made payment of $28,000 on 5 January 2022. 3', 'The Watches were delivered by the Applicant to the Respondent on 6 January 2022. 4', 'The Respondent, however, did not make payment of the purchase price of $16,000 for the Hublot Watch. The Applicant, therefore, sought to claim the sum of $16,000 from the Respondent by commencing the MC Claim (see Hon G v Tan Pei Li [2023] SGMC 8 (the \u201cTrial Judgment\u201d) at [4]\u2013[5]). 5', '6\\u2003The Respondent claimed that a key term of the oral agreement between the parties was that the Watches must be authentic. However, the Watches were found to be counterfeit by an expert, Mr Eric Ong (the \u201cExpert\u201d). Therefore, the Respondent counterclaimed for breach of contract or, alternatively, a failure of consideration (see the Trial Judgment at [6]).', '7\\u2003In response to the Respondent\u2019s counterclaim, the Applicant had accepted that the Watches were sold on the basis, either express or implied, that the Watches were authentic. The Applicant had also accepted that the Watches which were the subject of the Expert\u2019s examination were not authentic. However, the Applicant denied that the Watches which were the subject of the Expert\u2019s examination were, in fact, the Watches which had been delivered by the Applicant to the Respondent. Instead, the Applicant claimed that: (a) there were discrepancies in the Expert\u2019s reports on the Watches; and (b) the Respondent was facing financial difficulties which provided a motive for counterfeit watches to be provided to the Expert for examination instead of the Watches sold by the Applicant (see the Trial Judgment at [7]).', '8\\u2003Following a one-day hearing, the DJ found in favour of the Respondent. A summary of the DJ\u2019s findings is as follows:', '(a)\\u2003The DJ accepted the Expert\u2019s reports and found that the Watches were not authentic. The alleged discrepancies in the Expert\u2019s reports on the Watches, as alleged by the Applicant, were not discrepancies. The Expert had given his explanations which were accepted by the DJ (see the Trial Judgment at [11]\u2013[33]). The DJ found that the Respondent\u2019s alleged motive for swapping the Watches with counterfeit watches because of her financial difficulties was unsubstantiated and speculative (see the Trial Judgment at [34]\u2013[38]). The DJ found that the Applicant\u2019s allegation about the swapping of the Watches with counterfeit watches was inherently improbable from the perspectives of time and logic (see the Trial Judgment at [39]\u2013[43]).', '(b)\\u2003The DJ allowed the Respondent\u2019s counterclaim on the basis that there was a breach of contract. The Applicant had accepted that the sale of the Watches was on the basis that the Watches were authentic. Accordingly, there was a breach of the oral agreement as the Watches were not authentic. Given that this lack of authenticity in the Watches fell within one of the four situations in which an innocent party is entitled to discharge a contract, as set out by the Court of Appeal in RDC Concrete Pte Ltd v Sato Kogyo (S) Pte Ltd and another appeal [2007] 4 SLR(R) 413 (at [99]), the Respondent was entitled to discharge the oral agreement. The Respondent was, therefore, entitled to a refund of the purchase price of $28,000 which she had paid to the Applicant for the Rolex Watch (see the Trial Judgment at [50]\u2013[62]).', '(c)\\u2003The DJ rejected the Applicant\u2019s reliance on s 35(1)(a) and s 35(4) of the Sale of Goods Act 1979 (2020 Rev Ed) (\u201cSOGA\u201d) to rebut the Respondent\u2019s counterclaim that the Respondent was deemed to have accepted the Watches because: (i) the Respondent had intimated to the Applicant that she had accepted the Watches; and (ii) the Respondent had retained the Watches after the lapse of a reasonable time without intimating to the Applicant that she had rejected the Watches. The Applicant argued that s 11(3) of the SOGA prevented the Respondent from rejecting the Watches. However, the DJ found that there was a lack of evidence to support the Applicant\u2019s defence to the Respondent\u2019s counterclaim that the Respondent had intimated to the Applicant that she had accepted the Watches. Further, a reasonable time had not elapsed since the Watches were luxury watches which could not be readily assessed by a layperson at the point of delivery. The Respondent would have required time to identify an expert to examine the Watches. Therefore, the SOGA did not affect the Respondent\u2019s counterclaim for breach of contract (see the Trial Judgment at [63]\u2013[77]).', '(d)\\u2003The DJ also found that there was a failure of consideration as the Watches were not authentic. Thus, the Applicant was unjustly enriched.', '9\\u2003On 18 April 2023, the DJ dismissed the Applicant\u2019s claim of $16,000 and made the following orders (see Hon G v Tan Pei Li [2023] SGMC 21 (the \u201cDJ\u2019s 18 April 2023 Judgment\u201d) at [3] and [4]): 6', '(a)\\u2003the Applicant was to refund the Respondent the sum of $28,000 with interest at 5.33% per annum from the date of the MC Claim to the date of the Trial Judgment; and', '(b)\\u2003the Applicant was to pay the Respondent costs of the action which were fixed at $8,000 plus reasonable disbursements to be agreed plus any applicable goods and services tax.', '10\\u2003The Applicant was dissatisfied with the DJ\u2019s decision and sought to appeal against it. Pursuant to s 21(1)(a) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1969 (2020 Rev Ed), the Applicant requires permission to appeal against the DJ\u2019s decision. The Applicant, therefore, filed the MC Summons for permission to appeal against the DJ\u2019s decision in the MC Claim. After considering the parties\u2019 submissions, the DJ dismissed the application. The detailed grounds of the DJ\u2019s decision can be found in the DJ\u2019s 18 April 2023 Judgment. I set out below a summary of the Applicant\u2019s submissions and the DJ\u2019s 18 April 2023 Judgment.', '11\\u2003The DJ applied the well-settled test for permission to appeal as set out in Lee Kuan Yew v Tang Liang Hong and another [1997] 2 SLR(R) 862 (\u201cLee Kuan Yew\u201d) at [16]. There must be: (a) a prima facie case of error; (b) a question of general principle decided for the first time; or (c) a question of importance upon which further argument and a decision of a higher tribunal would be to the public advantage (see the DJ\u2019s 18 April 2023 Judgment at [7]).', '12\\u2003The Applicant submitted that there were four prima facie cases of error and two questions of general principle decided for the first time. The DJ disagreed with the Applicant. A summary of the Applicant\u2019s submissions and the DJ\u2019s findings are as follows:', '(a)\\u2003The first prima facie case of error alleged by the Applicant was that the DJ had failed to consider whether the Watches were sold on an \u201cas-is-where-is\u201d basis before concluding that the Applicant had breached the oral agreement. The thrust of the Applicant\u2019s argument was that the Watches were sold on an \u201cas-is-where-is\u201d basis and that the risk of the Watches being counterfeit passed to the Respondent upon delivery. Therefore, the Respondent should be deemed to have accepted the Watches without any warranty or guarantee. The DJ found that the Applicant\u2019s argument was untenable. While the Applicant had pleaded that the Watches were sold on an \u201cas-is-where-is\u201d basis, the Applicant had also pleaded that the sale of the Watches was on the basis, express and\/or implied, that the Watches were authentic. The DJ had proceeded on the basis that the Applicant\u2019s pleaded case was that the Watches were sold on an \u201cas-is-where-is\u201d basis subject to them being authentic. Therefore, the DJ found that there was no prima facie case of error (see the DJ\u2019s 18 April 2023 Judgment at [11]\u2013[14]).', '(b)\\u2003The second prima facie case of error alleged by the Applicant was that the DJ had erred in finding that the Respondent had been deprived substantially of the whole benefit of the oral agreement. The Applicant argued that the Respondent was not so deprived as the sale of the Watches which were pre-owned was done on an \u201cas-is-where-is\u201d basis without the boxes or papers for the Watches. The DJ found that the authenticity of the Watches was a key term of the oral agreement and the Respondent was deprived substantially of the whole benefit of the oral agreement. Therefore, the DJ found that there was no prima facie case of error (see the DJ\u2019s 18 April 2023 Judgment at [15]\u2013[17]).', '(c)\\u2003The third prima facie case of error alleged by the Applicant was that the DJ had erred in finding that the Respondent was not deemed to have accepted the Watches pursuant to s 35(1)(a) of the SOGA despite the Respondent\u2019s evidence at the hearing that she had been satisfied with the Watches when she first took delivery of them. According to the Applicant, s 35(1)(a) of the SOGA states that a buyer is deemed to have accepted the goods when he intimates to the seller that he has accepted them and this can encompass acceptance by acquiescence. The DJ rejected the Applicant\u2019s submission. Section 35(2)(a) of the SOGA states that a buyer is not deemed to have accepted goods under s 35(1) of the SOGA until he has had a reasonable opportunity to examine them. The DJ had found that a reasonable time had not elapsed between the date of delivery of the Watches and the date the Respondent rejected the Watches because she had learnt that the Watches were not authentic. The Respondent also did not have a reasonable opportunity to examine the Watches.', '(d)\\u2003The fourth prima facie case of error alleged by the Applicant was that the DJ had erred in allowing the Respondent\u2019s counterclaim based on the ground of failure of consideration notwithstanding that the parties had not disputed the existence of the oral agreement. The DJ rejected the Applicant\u2019s submission.', '(e)\\u2003The Applicant further argued that there were two questions of general principle which were decided for the first time. The details of the Applicant\u2019s submission and the DJ\u2019s findings on these issues are as follows:', '13\\u2003In view of the DJ\u2019s finding that there was no prima facie case of error or question of general principle decided for the first time, the DJ dismissed the Applicant\u2019s application for permission to appeal against the DJ\u2019s decision. The DJ also ordered the Applicant to pay the Respondent the costs of the application which was fixed at $1,000 (all-in) plus any applicable goods and services tax.', '14\\u2003The Applicant now makes this application for permission of the General Division of the High Court to appeal against the DJ\u2019s decision.'"}

One of the two companies was Sheenway Exhibition and Projects Pte Ltd (\u201cSE&P\u201d). The Applicant held 40% of the shares in SE&P and the Respondent held 60% of the shares in SE&P. As a result of differences which arose, the parties entered into a settlement agreement (the \u201cSA\u201d). As part of the SA, the parties had agreed that SE&P would cease all operations except the collection of outstanding debts. Further, the receivables were to be distributed between the Applicant and the Respondent in accordance with the proportion of shares they each held. The parties also appended their signatures to a document which stated that SE&P\u2019s receivables were in excess of $530,000 (see Tey Leng Yen v Mai Xun Yao [2021] SGDC 65 (the \u201cTrial Judgment\u201d) at [1]\u2013[6]). 1', '6\\u2003The Applicant subsequently commenced a suit in the District Court, DC\/DC 45\/2018 (\u201cDC 45\u201d), against the Respondent on 5 January 2018 on the basis that the Respondent had breached various terms of the SA (see the Trial Judgment at [3]).', '7\\u2003On 17 March 2020, the Respondent made an offer to settle (the \u201cOTS\u201d) which included the following terms: 2', '(a)\\u2003The Respondent shall make available to the Applicant the accounts of the two companies after March 2013; and', '(b)\\u2003Any net balance in the accounts of the two companies (after deducting the expenses, taxes, etc) shall be split between the Applicant and the Respondent in accordance with their respective shareholdings in the two companies.', '8\\u2003The Applicant did not accept the OTS. 3', '9\\u2003The trial was bifurcated. The first tranche dealt with the liability of the parties. There were two issues to be decided at the first tranche: (a) whether the Respondent had breached the SA by allowing SE&P to continue operating; and (b) whether the Respondent had breached the SA by failing to distribute the receivables of SE&P in accordance with the proportion of the shares held by the parties (see the Trial Judgment at [14]).', '10\\u2003The DR who was the trial judge in the second tranche on assessment of damages found that the Applicant succeeded in proving that the Respondent had breached the SA by allowing SE&P to continue operating (see the Trial Judgment at [16]\u2013[48]). However, the DR found that the Applicant failed to prove that the Respondent had breached the SA by failing to distribute the receivables of SE&P in accordance with the proportion of the shares held by the parties as SE&P was still in operation with outstanding receivables, debts and expenses. Thus, the receivables could not be distributed until after SE&P\u2019s liabilities were settled (see the Trial Judgment at [50]\u2013[54]). Given the Applicant\u2019s success on the first issue, the DR found that the Applicant was entitled to interlocutory judgment with damages to be assessed for the loss occasioned by the Respondent\u2019s breach of the SA by allowing SE&P to continue operating (see the Trial Judgment at [55]). The Respondent appealed to the High Court against the decision of the DR, but the appeal was dismissed on 15 July 2021. 4', '11\\u2003In the second tranche of the trial, the Applicant submitted that she was entitled to 40% of SE&P\u2019s receivables which was determined as at March 2013, being what she was entitled to under the SA in accordance with the proportion of the shares she held in SE&P. The DR, however, found that the Applicant had failed to prove the loss she suffered and the quantum of that loss as a result of the Respondent\u2019s breach which allowed SE&P to continue operating because the company was in operation and the Applicant\u2019s share of SE&P\u2019s receivables could only be determined after SE&P\u2019s liabilities were settled. The DR thus awarded nominal damages of $1,000 to the Applicant with interest. 5', '12\\u2003On 18 November 2022, the DR awarded costs of $40,000 in favour of the Applicant, with disbursements to be agreed or taxed as the Applicant had succeeded in her claim in the first tranche on liability and was awarded nominal damages in the second tranche when damages were assessed. 6', 'However, at the hearing on costs, the parties did not inform the DR of the existence of the OTS which had substantial implications on the costs award.', '13\\u2003Subsequently, the Respondent realised the implication of the OTS on the issue of costs. On 21 November 2022, the Respondent wrote to the DR to reconsider the costs award (the \u201cRespondent\u2019s 21 November 2022 Letter\u201d) in the light of the OTS. In the Respondent\u2019s 21 November 2022 Letter, the Respondent had set out the circumstances surrounding the OTS and submitted that the costs award by the DR should be reconsidered in view of the OTS. 7', 'On 23 November 2022 the DR replied that her decision on costs made on 18 November 2022 was to stand. 8', 'Nothing further was said by the DR about the OTS. 9', '14\\u2003In RA 85, the Respondent made the following arguments: 10', '(a)\\u2003Order 22A r 9(3) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (the \u201cROC 2014\u201d) should apply. There was a valid OTS which had not been withdrawn and had not expired before the disposal of the suit. The Applicant had obtained a judgment which was not more favourable than the terms of the OTS. Therefore, the Respondent should have been entitled to costs on the indemnity basis from the date the OTS was served until the date of the decision on the assessment of damages by the DR.', '(b)\\u2003In the event the DJ disagreed that O 22A r 9(3) of the ROC 2014 applied, the Applicant should still have not been awarded costs. The Applicant cannot be regarded as the successful party since she had only been awarded nominal damages in the second tranche of the trial.', '15\\u2003On 10 March 2023, the DJ allowed the Respondent\u2019s appeal in RA 85 and awarded costs of $20,000 in the Respondent\u2019s favour instead, with disbursements to be fixed if not agreed. 11', 'The DJ\u2019s decision can be summarised as follows:', '(a)\\u2003The OTS remained valid at the time the DR made an assessment on damages. Further, the Applicant did not obtain a judgment that was more favourable than the OTS. Although the Applicant had won on the first liability issue of the Respondent\u2019s breach of the SA by allowing SE&P to continue operating, the Applicant was awarded only nominal damages as the Applicant could not prove the damages suffered. The Applicant had to wait until after SE&P\u2019s liabilities had been settled and its operations ceased before she could ascertain her share of SE&P\u2019s receivables. This was akin to what was offered in the OTS. If the Applicant had accepted the OTS, she would have been in no worse a position than she was after the decision on assessment of damages was made by the DR. Therefore, the judgment obtained by the Applicant was not more favourable than the terms of the OTS. 12', '(b)\\u2003The OTS was a serious and genuine attempt at settlement. Therefore, the costs consequences provided for in O 22A r 9(3) of the ROC 2014 should have applied. In other words, the Applicant was entitled to costs on the standard basis until 17 March 2020 which was when the OTS was served, and the Respondent was entitled to costs on the indemnity basis from the date the OTS was served to 18 November 2022 when the DR made her decision on damages. 13', '(c)\\u2003The DR had omitted to consider the OTS as the parties did not raise the OTS when addressing the DR on costs. The DR, therefore, erred in her decision on costs and the Respondent\u2019s appeal in RA 85 was allowed. 14', '(d)\\u2003The second ground of appeal raised by the Respondent was moot as the DJ had already allowed the Respondent\u2019s appeal on the basis of the OTS. Nevertheless, the DJ considered whether the Applicant should be regarded as a successful party given that she had only been awarded nominal damages. Here, the DJ stated that the general principle as set out in Anglo-Cyprian Trade Agencies Ltd v Paphos Wine Industries Ltd [1951] 1 All ER 873 was that where a plaintiff is only awarded nominal damages, the plaintiff should not be regarded as a successful party and costs should be awarded to the defendant as if he had succeeded in his defence. In RA 85, the DJ took the view that even if the OTS had not existed or applied, the DR should have ordered that each party should bear its own costs for the first tranche of the trial. As for the second tranche, the DJ was of the view that the Applicant should have to bear costs of the assessment of damages hearing as the Applicant took an unrealistic position in the second tranche of the trial to insist on damages unnecessarily and caused costs and expenses in the second tranche of the trial. Therefore, even if the OTS did not exist or apply, the DJ would have found that the DR erred in awarding the Applicant costs of $40,000. 15', '(e)\\u2003The DJ awarded costs of $12,000 to the Applicant on the standard basis from the date of commencement of the suit to the date the OTS was served. The DJ also awarded the Respondent costs of $32,000 on an indemnity basis from the date the OTS was served to the date of judgment in the second tranche of the trial. The net effect of this was a costs award of $20,000 in the Respondent\u2019s favour. Therefore, the DJ set aside the DR\u2019s costs award and ordered costs of $20,000 in the Respondent\u2019s favour, with disbursements to be fixed if not agreed. 16', '16\\u2003The Applicant was dissatisfied with the DJ\u2019s decision on costs in RA 85. The Applicant, therefore, filed SUM 706 for permission to appeal against the DJ\u2019s decision on costs as the DJ\u2019s decision is appealable only if permission is obtained.', '17\\u2003In SUM 706, the Applicant submitted the following grounds to support her application: 17', '(a)\\u2003The DJ had not given due weight to the DR\u2019s decision when deciding to overturn the DR\u2019s decision on costs in RA 85.', '(b)\\u2003The DJ had considered the OTS when it was not brought up to the DR at the hearing on costs.', '(c)\\u2003The DJ had considered the OTS when the DR had already taken it into account after the request for further arguments was denied.', '(d)\\u2003The DJ erred in her conclusion that the judgment obtained by the Applicant was not more favourable than the terms of the OTS.', '(e)\\u2003There was a procedural irregularity in RA 85 as the Respondent had been labouring under the misapprehension that the Rules of Court 2021 applied instead of the ROC 2014.', '18\\u2003The DJ dismissed SUM 706. 18', 'The DJ\u2019s decision can be summarised as follows:', '(a)\\u2003The Applicant\u2019s position appeared to be inconsistent. On the one hand, the Applicant took issue that the DJ had considered the OTS in RA 85 when it had not been brought up to the DR during the hearing on costs before the DR. On the other hand, the Applicant took issue that the DJ had considered the OTS in RA 85 when the DR had already considered the OTS when it was brought to the attention of the DR by way of the Respondent\u2019s 21 November 2022 Letter. The Applicant\u2019s counsel also accepted that these were contradictory positions. 19', '(b)\\u2003The hearing of RA 85 operated as a de novo hearing and the DJ was allowed to consider the OTS. The DJ also gave due weight to the DR\u2019s decision when evaluating whether the DR had erred in deciding on the award of costs. The DR had not indicated that she had considered the OTS, or provided reasons to support the DR\u2019s award of costs in light of the OTS. In view of the facts of the case, the DR\u2019s award of costs could not be sustained. 20', '(c)\\u2003While the Respondent may have taken the erroneous position that the Rules of Court 2021 applied to the RA 85 instead of the ROC 2014, the court clearly recognised that it was the ROC 2014 which applied. Further, the substantive law was the same in both the ROC 2014 and the Rules of Court 2021. 21', '(d)\\u2003The Applicant was dissatisfied with the outcome of RA 85 but could not point to any prima facie case of error of law for which permission to appeal ought to be granted. 22', '19\\u2003The DJ awarded costs of $1,000 (all-in) in favour of the Respondent following the dismissal of the Applicant\u2019s application for permission to appeal in SUM 706. 23', '20\\u2003The Applicant now seeks this Court\u2019s permission to appeal against the DJ\u2019s decision.

{"casename":"2023_SGHC_196","fact":"'3\\u2003The applicant is a 26-year-old Singaporean. The first and second respondents are the father and mother of the applicant, respectively. The applicant resides at the Property with the second respondent and his sister. The first respondent resides in another property at Block 141 Lorong Ah Soo (\u201cthe Lorong Ah Soo Flat\u201d).', '4\\u2003The background to the purchase of the Property and the creation of the Trust are as follows. It is undisputed that on 13 July 2020, the respondents entered into an option to purchase the Property for a total consideration of $4.925m. At that time, the respondents were in their mid-50s, and the first respondent had retired. As such, the respondents raised the purchase sum through various loans. The loans were eventually repaid through the sale of three other properties and by liquidating some of the respondents\u2019 personal assets.', '5\\u2003It is also undisputed that, subsequently in July 2020, the respondents jointly engaged solicitors from Lee & Lee to draft and execute the Trust by way of a deed. Pursuant to the Trust, the respondents were to hold the Property, or alternatively, the net proceeds of the sale of the Property, on trust as joint trustees for the applicant\u2019s sole benefit. More specifically, the respondents met with Ms Sharon Tay (\u201cMs Tay\u201d), a solicitor from Lee & Lee, for advice on the conveyancing process and to prepare the Trust Deed.', '6\\u2003Crucially, however, the parties dispute the purpose of the Trust. The applicant and the second respondent say that the Trust was created to gift the applicant, the respondents\u2019 elder child and only son, a legacy property while the respondents were still alive. In contrast, the first respondent alleges the Trust Deed was created to avoid the payment of ABSD and that it was a sham instrument. According to him, the Trust was created because the respondents thought that it would be better for the applicant to beneficially own the Property so that the respondents could \u201cbuy\u201d time to dispose of their other assets and avoid the hefty ABSD that they could not afford.', '7\\u2003Moreover, the respondents dispute between themselves what transpired during the meeting with Ms Tay. Specifically, while the respondents agree that Ms Tay advised them that the Trust could be \u201ccollapsed\u201d, the respondents differ on what she meant by that. According to the first respondent, Ms Tay allegedly advised the respondents that the Trust could easily be \u201ccollapse[d]\u201d after the \u201c[ABSD] period\u201d ended in four years\u2019 time, and that the respondents could then \u201ctake back\u201d the property if they decided to. 1', 'In respect of the four-year period, it was likely that, instead of ABSD, the first respondent was referring to Seller\u2019s Stamp Duty (\u201cSSD\u201d) which is payable if the Property was acquired and disposed of within a specified number of years.', '8\\u2003In response, the second respondent alleges that Ms Tay said that it is the applicant who can legally ask for the Property to be transferred to him before the age of 40 years despite cl 7 of the Trust. In this regard, this clause provides that if the Property is not sold, then upon the applicant attaining the age of 40 years old, the legal title of the Property shall vest in him on his request: 2', '9\\u2003After the execution of the Trust, the first respondent alleged that a loan agreement (\u201cthe Loan Agreement\u201d) dated 4 August 2020 was signed by the applicant and the respondents. By the terms of the Loan Agreement, the respondents agreed to loan the applicant the sum of $4.925m to purchase the Property. However, the applicant and the second respondent dispute (a) whether the Loan Agreement was signed to begin with, and (b) the effect and purpose of the Loan Agreement. Regarding the issue of whether the Loan Agreement was signed, the applicant and the second respondent both deny that the applicant had ever signed the Loan Agreement. As such, by their account, there was no agreement reached between the parties at all.', '10\\u2003As for the effect and purpose of the Loan Agreement, the first respondent originally took the position that it was intended to protect the applicant in the long term. In particular, the first respondent explained that he and the second respondent were concerned that should the applicant\u2019s marriage with his future wife end in a divorce, his future wife may make a claim on the Property. However, the first respondent later changed tack. He now claims that the Loan Agreement was to protect him and the second respondent, and not the applicant. 3', 'By the first respondent\u2019s latest account, the Property was the respondents\u2019 sole asset after disposing of all their other properties. Therefore, it was necessary to protect himself and the second respondent in case they were left with nothing. In contrast, the applicant and the second respondent take the position that the Loan Agreement was to \u201cprotect\u201d the capital sum of $4.925m in case the applicant\u2019s future wife attempted to assert any rights over the Property in the event of the applicant\u2019s divorce. In essence, the applicant and the second respondent reaffirm the position initially taken by the first respondent that the Loan Agreement was intended to protect the applicant in the long term.', '11\\u2003Sometime in 2021, the relationship between the respondents became rocky. The second respondent commenced divorce proceedings against the first respondent, who had moved out to stay at the Lorong Ah Soo Flat. In light of this development, the applicant now wishes to terminate the Trust in order to have the Property vest in him immediately. According to him, this is to prevent any more disputes between the respondents, and to ensure that the second respondent, his sister, and him will have a place to stay after the divorce proceedings between the respondents are finalised.', '12\\u2003To that end, the applicant instructed his solicitors to write to the respondents to inform them of his intention to terminate the Trust and to seek their agreement for the legal title of the Property to be transferred to him immediately upon such termination. The second respondent replied on 5 August 2022 to state that she was agreeable to the applicant\u2019s proposal. The first respondent replied by way of email on 6 August 2022 to state that he wished to let the court decide on the application.

The contract was to be on a Licensing plus Engineering, Procurement and Construction (\u201cL+EPC\u201d) basis, which meant that the contractor would also have to bring with it a licensor to provide the technological know-how to construct the HDPE Plant, and provide the licence to OPAL to operate the plant using the licensed technology. 3', '3\\u2003Two eligible bids were submitted.

More importantly, the terms of the GCC also formed the basis of much of the dispute regarding OPAL\u2019s claims against Daelim. Daelim acknowledged the NOA and the project was set in motion \u2013 as per the NOA, the parties were to sign a formal contract within 30 days. 7', '4\\u2003Daelim\u2019s triumph in the bidding process was, however, short-lived. Various issues arose with its licensor, CP Chem, which were ultimately never resolved. Just over a month later, on 11 February 2011, Daelim informed OPAL that it could not enter into the formal contract. 8', 'OPAL\u2019s attempts to mediate between Daelim and CP Chem proved unsuccessful, and OPAL proceeded to terminate the NOA on 28 April 2011. With Daelim no longer an option, the L+EPC contract was awarded to the only other bidder, Samsung, on 29 April 2011. 9', 'This set the stage for the dispute between OPAL and Daelim.', '5\\u2003OPAL commenced arbitration proceedings against Daelim on 26 November 2012, claiming damages for Daelim\u2019s abandonment of the contract. 10', 'A three-member tribunal consisting of Mr Peter Leaver KC, Justice VN Khare (Retd) and Justice RV Raveendran (Retd) (the \u201cTribunal\u201d) was constituted. Justice VN Khare subsequently resigned as a member of the Tribunal and was replaced by Justice GS Singhvi (Retd). 11', 'The proceedings were vigorously contested, with Daelim bringing challenges to the constitution of the Tribunal and to its jurisdiction, first before the Tribunal itself, and subsequently before the Singapore High Court in HC\/OS 140\/2016. The subject matter of these challenges are not material to the present application \u2013 it suffices to say that the High Court decided that the Tribunal was validly constituted, and the arbitration was seated in Singapore. 12', '6\\u2003By agreement of the parties, the proceedings were bifurcated into two phases dealing with liability and quantum respectively.', '7\\u2003OPAL\u2019s case on liability was essentially as follows: a binding and enforceable contract had come into existence by Daelim\u2019s acceptance of the NOA. However, Daelim\u2019s subsequent withdrawal amounted to a wrongful repudiation. OPAL therefore sought a declaration that it had rightfully terminated the contract following Daelim\u2019s repudiation and claimed, among others, compensation under the following heads of claim: 13', '(a)\\u2003US$13,803,800 plus INR459,330,050 amounting to 10% of the contract price guaranteed to be paid as security for performance of the contract (the \u201cGuarantee Claim\u201d);', '(b)\\u2003INR300.80 crores (or INR3,008,000,000) or an appropriate sum as compensation for the 113-day delay between Daelim\u2019s abandonment and the award of the contract to Samsung, resulting in loss on account of delay in creating a revenue producing asset (the \u201cDelay Claim\u201d); and', '(c)\\u2003INR409.28 crores (or INR4,092,800,000) as compensation for the loss of Net Present Value (\u201cNPV\u201d) (the \u201cLoss of NPV Claim\u201d).', '8\\u2003A brief explanation of the Loss of NPV Claim is apposite as this claim forms the core of the dispute in the application before me. NPV was the methodology adopted by EIL (OPAL\u2019s project management consultant) to evaluate the bids received, utilising three basic components derived from the data submitted by the bidders: capital expenditure, operational costs and economic value derived from bidders\u2019 quoted conversion efficiencies. Daelim\u2019s bid was evaluated to have a distinctive advantage over Samsung\u2019s bid, resulting in a higher NPV \u2013 in a nutshell, the higher the NPV, the better. With Daelim\u2019s withdrawal from the contract, OPAL had no choice but to contract with Samsung, resulting in an NPV difference. It was this difference in NPV which was claimed by OPAL under its Loss of NPV Claim. 14', '9\\u2003In its defence, Daelim raised several grounds such as illegality and impossibility of performance to contend that the contract was void or that Daelim was discharged from performance. Daelim further denied OPAL\u2019s entitlement to the heads of damage claimed. 15', 'It argued that: 16', '(a)\\u2003OPAL was not entitled to make the Guarantee Claim because the final contract was never finalised and executed, such that Daelim\u2019s obligation to provide a performance guarantee never arose;', '(b)\\u2003OPAL was not entitled to make the Delay Claim because it did not suffer any loss or damage on account of the alleged delay and the claim was in any event excluded under cll 6.2.1 and 6.2.3 of the GCC;', '(c)\\u2003the Loss of NPV Claim was also barred by cll 6.2.1 and 6.2.3 of the GCC, which excluded liability for loss of profits, loss of production and interest; and', '(d)\\u2003OPAL had no further remedy beyond terminating the NOA and forfeiting Daelim\u2019s bid security of US$500,000.', '10\\u2003For completeness, cll 6.2.1 and 6.2.3 of the GCC provided as follows: 17', '11\\u2003The liability hearing took place in tranches between 18 December 2017 and 28 July 2018. 18', 'The Tribunal issued a final award dated 28 December 2018 on liability, and a correction on 28 February 2019 (collectively, the \u201cLiability Award\u201d). The Tribunal was split, with Justices Raveendran and Singhvi in the majority, and Mr Leaver KC dissenting. In the Liability Award, the majority held that there was a concluded contract in existence between the parties, which Daelim had wrongfully abandoned. Turning to the heads of claim for damages, the majority dismissed the Guarantee Claim and Delay Claim outright, on the grounds that the former was a duplication of the Loss of NPV Claim, whereas the latter was barred by cll 6.2.1 and 6.2.3 of the GCC. 19', '12\\u2003However, the majority declined to outrightly dismiss the Loss of NPV Claim. The majority characterised this as a claim made under cl 8.4.1.1 read with 8.4.1.2 of the GCC. These clauses, read together, entitled OPAL to deploy any other contractor to complete the work at the risk and cost of the defaulting contractor, Daelim, and to recover the extra cost from Daelim subject to a ceiling of 20% of the contract price: 20', '13\\u2003As such, the majority permitted the claim to proceed to the quantum phase. 21', 'Whether, in so doing, the majority made conclusive findings as to how quantum was to be assessed is a major point of contention between the parties which I elaborate on below. In the dispositive paragraph, the Tribunal concluded as follows: 22', '14\\u2003The dissenting arbitrator issued a dissenting opinion. In his view, the contract was unenforceable because at least one fundamental term had not been agreed between the parties. 23', 'He further raised several points of disagreement relating to damages, particularly with the majority\u2019s decision permitting the Loss of NPV Claim to proceed to the quantum phase at all. 24', 'As I shall explain below, OPAL also relies on the dissent to support its case for setting aside the Quantum Award.', '15\\u2003Neither party challenged any aspect of the Liability Award following its issuance. The arbitration then proceeded to the quantum hearing.', '16\\u2003In this phase, OPAL presented a revised claim for loss of NPV (the \u201cRevised NPV Claim\u201d) amounting to INR11,019,300,000 (or 1101.93 crores) \u2013 this represented a significant increase from the sum claimed at the liability stage. To support the Revised NPV Claim, OPAL heavily relied on a report produced by Mr Andrew Flower, its expert witness in the quantum stage (\u201cMr Flower\u2019s Report\u201d). 25', 'The Revised NPV Claim consisted of two separate heads of claim:', '(a)\\u2003the overall extra cost to OPAL of building and operating the plant with Samsung as the contractor instead of Daelim (the \u201cIncremental Cost Claim\u201d); and', '(b)\\u2003the value of missing production capability, ie, the inability to produce a product which would have been available if the plant had been built by Daelim using CP Chem\u2019s technology (the \u201cLoss of Capability Claim\u201d). 26', '17\\u2003 Daelim raised several challenges to the Revised NPV Claim which can be summarised as follows. First, it opposed the Revised NPV Claim as an impermissible departure from OPAL\u2019s pleaded claim at the liability stage of the arbitration. Second, it claimed that the Incremental Cost Claim and Loss of Capability Claim were in essence claims for loss of profit which OPAL was not entitled to raise under the GCC. Third, it challenged the Revised NPV Claim as being unsupported by evidence and argued that it was quantified using erroneous assumptions and fundamental misconceptions. 27', '18\\u2003The quantum hearing took place from 4\u201314 January 2021 28', 'dealing specifically with the Loss of NPV Claim. 29', 'The Tribunal issued its second final award dated 20 December 2021 on the issue of quantum, along with a further correction on 3 February 2022 (collectively, the \u201cQuantum Award\u201d). In summary, it dismissed both the Incremental Cost Claim and Loss of Capability Claim \u2013 the former because OPAL had failed to prove what it pleaded at the liability stage, and chose to prove what it did not plead, 30', 'and the latter because it was essentially a claim for loss of profits which was barred by cll 6.2.1 and 6.2.3 of the GCC. 31', '19\\u2003Having dismissed those claims, the Tribunal considered whether OPAL\u2019s Revised NPV Claim as pleaded in the quantum stage (if they could be made out at all) could be re-worked to fit the claim as originally pleaded in the liability stage. 32', 'The Tribunal analysed Mr Flower\u2019s Report, which formed the basis of the Revised NPV Claim, and found that his calculations suffered \u201cfrom serious and fundamental errors requiring rejection\u201d. 33', 'The Tribunal concluded in the round that OPAL had failed to prove its loss, and eventually only awarded OPAL nominal damages amounting to INR500,000. 34'"}

The 1st defendant also alleged that by failing to produce several of the documents requested in the NTP, the claimants had breached the court\u2019s directions. The 1st defendant then asked for production of the documents in requests #20, #28 and #58, and reserved their rights with respect to the other documents that had not been produced.', '12\\u2003The claimants replied on 15 May 2023 and explained that the 1st defendant was not entitled to the document in request #45 because the document did not relate to their claim against the 1st defendant. The claimants also took the position that they had no obligation to produce the documents in requests #20, #28 and #58.', '13\\u2003On the same day (15 May 2023), the 1st defendant\u2019s lawyers wrote to the court requesting the court to direct (among other things) the production of the documents in requests #20, #28 and #58 forthwith and the remaining documents on a rolling basis no later than 19 May 2023. The 1st defendant again sought an extension of time to file its defence.', '14\\u2003On 16 May 2023, the claimants\u2019 lawyers informed the court that the claimants had instructed them to file an appeal and requested the AR not to make any directions pending the determination of the appeal.

Consequently, the AR extended the time for the filing of the 1st defendant\u2019s defence until after the appeal was dealt with.'"}
{"casename":"2023_SGHC_199","fact":"'7\\u2003ByBit, a Seychellois company, owns a namesake cryptocurrency exchange. ByBit remunerates its employees with traditional currency, cryptocurrency, or a mixture of both. WeChain Fintech Pte Ltd (\u201cWeChain\u201d), a Singapore incorporated company, provides payroll services for ByBit and related entities. Ms Ho was employed by WeChain and was responsible for the payroll processing of ByBit\u2019s employees. 1', '8\\u2003As part of her duties, Ms Ho maintained Microsoft Excel spreadsheets which tracked the cash and cryptocurrency payments due to ByBit\u2019s employees each month (respectively, the \u201cFiat Excel Files\u201d and \u201cCryptocurrency Excel Files\u201d). The Cryptocurrency Excel Files list the \u201cAddress\u201d designated by ByBit\u2019s employees for the receipt of cryptocurrency payments. An \u201cAddress\u201d can be understood as an encrypted digital \u201cfolder\u201d which can \u201creceive\u201d and \u201cstore\u201d cryptocurrency. Each Address takes the form of a unique string of alpha numerals. A corresponding \u201cPrivate Key\u201d is required to access and authorise transfers between Addresses. These Private Keys are in turn stored in \u201cWallets\u201d, which can thus be understood as the means of interfacing with cryptocurrency. Wallets which are hosted online by a service provider, usually a cryptocurrency exchange, are known as \u201cCustodial Wallets\u201d. Custodial Wallets usually take the form of an application with a user interface. Offline Wallets are known as \u201cSelf-Custodial Wallets\u201d and may range from a simple piece of paper inscribed with the Private Key or complex encryption software restricting access to the Private Key. In short, access to a Wallet grants access to the stored Private Keys which provide control over an Address and thus the cryptocurrency stored therein. ByBit\u2019s employees could and did regularly change their designated Address by communicating a new Address to Ms Ho, who would then update the Cryptocurrency Excel Files. 2', 'Ms Ho was singularly responsible for updating the Cryptocurrency Excel Files and was the only person with access, save that the Cryptocurrency Excel Files would be submitted to her direct superior, Ms Casandra Teo, for approval each month. 3', '9\\u2003On 7 September 2022, ByBit discovered that eight unusual cryptocurrency payments had been made (the \u201cAnomalous Transactions\u201d) between 31 May 2022 and 31 August 2022, involving large payments of USDT into four Addresses, which I will refer to for simplicity as Address 1, 2, 3 and 4. In total, 4,209,720 USDT had been transferred (the \u201cCrypto Asset\u201d). 4', 'USDT is so named because its value is tethered to the US dollar and each USDT grants a holder who is a \u201cverified customer\u201d of its issuer, Tether Limited, a contractual right to redeem their USDT for US dollars. 5', 'The Anomalous Transactions were compiled into an Excel spreadsheet (the \u201cReconciliation Excel File\u201d), and Ms Ho was tasked with accounting for the discrepancies. Ms Ho initially attributed the Anomalous Transactions to inadvertent mistakes or technical errors and offered to calculate the amounts required to be clawed back from ByBit\u2019s employees. 6', '10\\u2003Between 9 to 22 September 2022, Ms Ho remained unable to provide any explanation for the Anomalous Transactions. When asked why payments to different employees were made to the same Address, Address 1, Ms Ho suggested that she had made an inadvertent mistake. Ms Ho continued to provide status updates in the Reconciliation Excel File, characterising the Anomalous Transactions as amounts \u201coverpaid\u201d to ByBit\u2019s employees. 7', '11\\u2003On 27 September 2022, ByBit contacted one of the supposed recipients of the Anomalous Transactions. 1,300,000 USDT had been paid to Address 1 in his name. However, according to ByBit, that employee denied ever designating an Address as he had only ever been remunerated with traditional currency and did not know who owned Address 1. 8', 'ByBit\u2019s internal investigations revealed that Ms Ho\u2019s work email had sent to itself an email containing Address 1 on 19 May 2022. Ms Ho\u2019s work email had also received an email containing all four Addresses on 29 August 2022, this time originating from Ms Ho\u2019s personal email. 9', 'These emails had to be recovered by ByBit as they had been deleted. 10', '12\\u2003ByBit also discovered that Ms Ho had caused $117,238.46 (the \u201cFiat Asset\u201d) to be paid into her personal bank account in May 2022. It is undisputed that Ms Ho is not entitled to the Fiat Asset and Ms Ho expressly accepts that she holds the Fiat Asset on trust for ByBit. 11', 'However, Ms Ho has to date not taken any steps to return the Fiat Asset.', '13\\u2003ByBit interviewed Ms Ho on 29 September 2022 and 4 October 2022. In the first meeting, Ms Ho claimed that she was unable to recall the details of the Anomalous Transactions. In the second meeting, Ms Ho was confronted with the fruits of ByBit\u2019s investigations. Ms Ho told ByBit that she did not own the Wallets associated with the four Addresses, which belonged to her maternal cousin, and that she did not have access to them. Ms Ho said that it was her cousin who had proposed that she assist in transferring cryptocurrency to him and that she possessed closed circuit surveillance footage recording him carrying out the Anomalous Transactions in her house. Ms Ho confessed that she had become involved in the scheme some three months prior to the interview and told ByBit that she preferred that a police report be made as she did not possess the Crypto Asset. After the interview, Ms Ho refused to sign an acknowledgment on a single page statement recording what transpired. Nevertheless, it is undisputed that Ms Ho made these representations to ByBit. 12', 'Thereafter, Ms Ho ceased contact with ByBit and WeChain and failed to attend follow up interviews. 13', '14\\u2003ByBit commenced this action on 12 October 2022. ByBit succeeded in obtaining several items of interim relief, including a worldwide freezing order against Ms Ho and a proprietary injunction in respect of the cryptocurrency in the four Addresses (ie, the Crypto Asset) and the Fiat Asset in Ms Ho\u2019s bank account. 14', 'Ms Ho was personally served with the Originating Claim and the orders on 18 October 2022. 15', 'On 31 October 2022, Ms Ho disclosed by affidavit that the Wallets associated with the four Addresses were owned by one Mr Jason Teo (\u201cJason\u201d), her maternal cousin. Ms Ho averred that she did not have access to any of the Wallets, that she had deleted her text conversation history with Jason prior to the service of the orders, and that she no longer had the closed-circuit surveillance footage as recordings older than seven days were automatically deleted. 16', 'Ms Ho filed her defence on 11 November 2022 and took out a third-party notice against Jason.', '15\\u2003Ms Ho fully accepts that the Crypto Asset belongs to ByBit and that she is not entitled to the same. 17', 'The core of Ms Ho\u2019s defence is that Jason stole the Crypto Asset from ByBit without her knowledge. She did not receive or benefit from them as the Wallets associated with the four Addresses are owned and controlled by Jason alone. Her case is that from May 2022, she had asked Jason to assist in checking the Cryptocurrency Excel Files on \u201cnumerous occasions\u201d when Jason visited her home. Jason had thereafter accessed her work laptop without her knowledge or consent, which Ms Ho only discovered after reviewing her home\u2019s closed-circuit surveillance footage when ByBit drew her attention to the Anomalous Transactions. She then confronted Jason, who admitted that he had intentionally substituted the designated Address of several ByBit employees with the four Addresses. Despite repeated requests, Jason has refused to return the Crypto Asset. 18', 'Ms Ho\u2019s position is that she remained unaware of the cause of the Anomalous Transactions on 9 September 2022, 19', 'which was well over seven days after the last Anomalous Transaction (dated 31 August 2022). No explanation is provided for how Ms Ho was able to view the incriminating footage.', '16\\u2003Dissatisfied with Ms Ho\u2019s disclosure, ByBit sought and obtained on 7 December 2022 orders for more extensive disclosure against Ms Ho and a number of third-parties, including her father and husband. 20', 'This was because ByBit had discovered that Ms Ho had made several substantial purchases from July 2022 onwards, including a freehold penthouse apartment with her husband, a brand new car, and several Louis Vuitton products. 21', 'Notably, despite initially denying ownership of any real property, 22', 'Ms Ho subsequently explained that she had acquired the freehold penthouse using moneys earned from cryptocurrency trading on MetaMask and crypto.com. 23', 'This was contrary to her previous claim that her MetaMask account was entirely unused. Ms Ho did not provide her MetaMask and crypto.com Address nor furnish accounts statements for transactions. According to Ms Ho, she lost access to her crypto.com account because it was registered to her personal email, which has since become disabled for reasons unknown. Similarly, she could not access her MetaMask account as she had purchased a brand new handphone in October 2022 and was unable to access the necessary passcode from her previous device. 24', 'I also note that contrary to the disclosure order, Ms Ho initially failed to disclose all her assets, such as her bank accounts, which required ByBit to carry out a further round of questioning. 25', '17\\u2003Simultaneously, Ms Ho applied for and obtained permission to effect substituted service on Jason. Curiously, Ms Ho averred in her supporting affidavit that it was Jason who had deleted their text conversation history after she informed him that she had been served the Originating Claim. 26', 'Jason has not made an appearance in these proceedings.', '18\\u2003On 30 March 2023, ByBit took out this application for summary judgment. Ms Ho did not file any affidavit disputing the application pursuant to O 9 r 17(3) of the Rules of Court 2021. On 18 April 2023, prior to the hearing, Ms Ho took over the conduct of her own defence. Ms Ho did not attend any of the hearings before me and did not file submissions.', '19\\u2003For completeness, ByBit also applied to amend their claim and to put in further submissions, which I directed to be filed by 19 May 2023. ByBit had originally pleaded that Ms Ho held the Crypto Asset and Fiat Asset on remedial constructive trust. ByBit therefore sought the amendment in order to run an alternative argument premised on institutional constructive trust. I granted Ms Ho leave to file submissions in respect of the amendment and granted an extension for her to file submissions in respect of summary judgment by 26 May 2023. As before, Ms Ho neglected to file any submissions and did not oppose the amendment application.', '20\\u2003ByBit submitted that the amendments were merely clarificatory and did not introduce any new facts. The pleadings already specified that Ms Ho wrongfully caused the Anomalous Transactions and Ms Ho\u2019s defence would not be affected by the amendments. Instead, the amendments enabled the real issue in controversy to be determined and no prejudice would be caused to Ms Ho that could be compensated by costs. 27', '21\\u2003I agreed that the proposed amendments were clarificatory in nature, and that adding the alternative legal conclusion of institutional constructive trust on the basis of the already pleaded facts enabled the real controversy to be fully and finally determined. Accordingly, on 30 June 2023 I allowed the amendments, and proceeded with the application for summary judgment on the basis of ByBit\u2019s Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 2), which was filed on 5 July 2023.'"}

They found the elderly woman sitting on the floor beside a lift lobby. Sgt Isaac asked her if she was okay, and why she was there. She replied that her legs were painful. Sgt Irfan asked her where she stayed. The elderly woman was unable to tell the police officers where she stayed and instead repeated that her legs were in pain.', '4\\u2003Subsequently, Sgt Isaac told the elderly woman that she was required to wear a mask, which was mandatory under the then-prevailing COVID-19 regulations.

Sgt Isaac and Sgt Irfan went to the Partial Address Location with a photo of the elderly woman and managed to find her residence with the help of the elderly woman\u2019s neighbours who recognised the elderly woman from the photo.

The fact that such actions only took place after offending should not \nbe reason to doubt the genuineness of his desire to change.\n17 However, given the reasons that I have stated above, I find that the DJ \ndid not err in concluding that the overall amount of resolve to change \ndemonstrated by the appellant was \u201cfair\u201d, in light of his other behaviour.\n18 For completeness, I do not find that the DJ erred in his assessment of the \nappellant\u2019s reduction in consumption of pornography. This was a factor which \nthe DJ acknowledged suggested some measure of change, though not amounting \nto a full and complete resolve. While credit should be given to the appellant for \nhis honesty, the DJ rightly considered that this was a trigger that made the \nappellant susceptible to sexual offending.\n19 Similarly, the DJ did not err in his assessment of the appellant\u2019s lack of \nre-offending. This was \u201cgiven due weight\u201d by the DJ,8 and there is no evidence \nthat insufficient weight was placed on this factor.\nThere is insufficient evidence of the existence of conditions that are \nconducive to helping the appellant turn over a new leaf\n20 I now consider the second limb of the Terence Siow framework, which \nrelates to the conditions in the appellant\u2019s life that are conducive to helping him \nturn over a new leaf.\n7 GD at [36]; ROP at p 145.\n8 GD at [40]; ROP at p 147.\nVersion No 1: 27 Jul 2023 (16:27 hrs)\nTien Kiat Chong v PP [2023] SGHC 202\n821 The appellant submits that the DJ erred in finding that the appellant\u2019s \npeer and intimate relationships were insufficient evidence of a supportive \nexternal environment. In this regard, the appellant says that he has a romantic \npartner, as well as university and church friends, from whom he draws support. \nHowever, I find that the DJ did not err in finding there was room for \nimprovement in this area given that, despite these factors, there were still \nconcerns expressed by the Probation Officer as to the appellant\u2019s lack of \npositive social connections and structured activities.\n22 Additionally, the appellant submits that the DJ erred in according little \nweight to his strong desire to pursue his tertiary education by reason of his \nadmission of taking upskirt videos while he was in ITE and polytechnic. The \nappellant argues that, as he was at a different stage of maturity before entering \nuniversity, it would be onerous to accord weight to this. I do not accept this \nsubmission. As recognised in Terence Siow at [77], if positive influences were \nalready present before the offence was committed, the fact that the appellant \nwas able to compartmentalise these influences and pursue a parallel pattern of \nbehaviour in committing the offences raises the question of whether such \ninfluences were able to channel the appellant to constructive non-offending \nbehaviour. If such circumstances have not changed, the degree to which these \npositive influences are able to prevent further re-offending would not be judged \nto be very high. \n23 Further, I also disagree with the appellant\u2019s submission that a \nconstructive environment would be more helpful just because the appellant is \nnow older. It may even be the case that a supportive environment may be more \nlikely to help a younger person whose habits are less likely to be set in stone.\nVersion No 1: 27 Jul 2023 (16:27 hrs)\nTien Kiat Chong v PP [2023] SGHC 202\n924 Lastly, contrary to the appellant\u2019s position, I also find that the DJ did not \nerr in finding that the appellant\u2019s familial support would only assist to a limited \ndegree. This has less to do with the earnestness of the involvement of his mother \nand brothers, who by all accounts have been supportive, and more to do with \nthe nature of the offence in question. As the DJ correctly noted, because such \noffences occur in the most private of circumstances, parental intervention and \nsupervision are not likely to be feasible. This was also recognised in Terence \nSiow at [79]. I stress that this is not any indictment of the supportiveness of the \nappellant\u2019s family but relates to the suitability of familial intervention in general \nfor offences of such nature.\n25 Given the above factors, I find that the DJ did not err in considering that \nthe appellant, while clearly demonstrating some propensity for reform, did not \ndemonstrate an extremely strong propensity for reform. It is thus unnecessary \nto move to the third limb of the Terence Siow framework to assess whether there \nwould be risk factors that warrant a revision of a finding that the appellant had \na strong propensity for reform. \nEven if the appellant has an extremely strong propensity for reform, \ndeterrence would have remained as the dominant sentencing consideration\n26 Before I conclude, I should state that I agree with the DJ\u2019s assessment \nthat even if the appellant had demonstrated an extremely strong propensity for \nreform, deterrence would have remained the dominant sentencing \nconsideration.\n27 As set out by a three-judge panel of the High Court in Nicholas Tan Siew \nChye v Public Prosecutor [2023] SGHC 35 at [42] (\u201cNicholas Tan\u201d), deterrence \nis generally the dominant sentencing consideration for offences under \nVersion No 1: 27 Jul 2023 (16:27 hrs)\nTien Kiat Chong v PP [2023] SGHC 202\n10s 377BB(4) of the Penal Code, at least in so far as adult offenders with no mental \ncondition contributing to their offending conduct are concerned. It would rarely \nbe the case that the emphasis would shift from deterrence to rehabilitation even \nwhere offenders have demonstrated an extremely strong propensity for reform. \nWhile this statement was made in the context of s 377BB(4) of the Penal Code, \nI am of the respectful view that this legal principle should also apply in \nascertaining the dominant sentencing consideration for voyeurism offences \nunder the now-repealed s 509 of the Penal Code which would have been \nprosecuted under the current s 377BB(4).\n28 The factors cited by the DJ for the seriousness of the appellant\u2019s \noffending were legitimate and given due weight. Such offences of recording \nupskirt videos using a mobile phone have seen an increase in prevalence. They \nare easy to commit but difficult to detect. The appellant had taken numerous \nvideos, including at least one on public transport. There is a need for specific \ndeterrence given the repeat offending by the appellant. I stress that I do not base \nthe need for specific deterrence on the uncharged offending to which the \nappellant candidly admitted in his psychological assessment, but solely on the \nconduct with which he was charged. Even confining our examination to the \ncharges before the court, the appellant\u2019s conduct, which involved the taking of \n19 videos in the course of 100 days, was egregious. It is further aggravating that \nthe appellant, unlike the offender in Nicholas Tan, reviewed the videos he had \nrecorded at home. The absence of a vulnerable victim does not diminish this \nconsideration at all.\n29 This was clearly not an exceptional case to warrant rehabilitation being \nthe dominant sentencing consideration.\nVersion No 1: 27 Jul 2023 (16:27 hrs)\nTien Kiat Chong v PP [2023] SGHC 202\n1130 Having concluded that probation was indeed not a suitable sentencing \noption for the appellant, I now turn to the appropriate length of the \nimprisonment term.\nDuration of imprisonment term\n31 Both parties agree that the present case does not possess many of the \naggravating factors that were present on the facts of Public Prosecutor v Chong \nHou En [2015] 3 SLR 222 (\u201cChong Hou En\u201d). The charges in Chong Hou En \nthat arose out of the filming of young victims in their residential homes are thus \nof limited relevance in calibrating the imprisonment term in the present case. \nWhat is instructive, however, is the charge relating to the filming of a stranger \nin a shopping mall, for which a sentence of 12 weeks\u2019 imprisonment was \nimposed. The appellant points out that even though the offender in Chong Hou \nEn was caught red-handed in the commission of his offence, credit was still \ngiven to the genuine remorse and plea of guilt.9 The appellant argues that \nmitigating weight should similarly be accorded to his remorse. Even accepting \nthis, a sentence of 12 weeks\u2019 imprisonment in fact accords the appellant more \nmitigating weight than the offender in Chong Hou En. This is because the \ncharge in Chong Hou En related to only one victim in a shopping mall, \ncompared to the amalgamated charge with 19 victims in the present case. If \nanything, the imprisonment term could have been calibrated even higher than \nthe 12 weeks\u2019 imprisonment term in Chong Hou En.\n32 In my view, 12 weeks\u2019 imprisonment also does not compare \nunfavourably with the sentence of 24 weeks\u2019 imprisonment imposed on the \noffender in Ang Zhu Ci Joshua v Public Prosecutor [2016] 4 SLR 1059, after \n9 Appellant\u2019s Skeletal Arguments dated 10 February 2023 at para 108.\nVersion No 1: 27 Jul 2023 (16:27 hrs)\nTien Kiat Chong v PP [2023] SGHC 202\n12taking into account the severity of the aggravating factors in the latter case. \nNeither does the term compare unfavourably with the other precedents cited by \nthe Prosecution.\n33 In the circumstances, the sentence imposed by the DJ was not manifestly \nexcessive, even after taking into account the appellant\u2019s plea of guilt, co-\noperation with the authorities, and efforts to seek treatment and counselling.\n34 I thus dismiss"}

Although both the Prosecution and the Defence have appealed against the decision of the DJ, for convenience, I refer to Mr Soo as the Appellant. The Appellant faced eight charges before the DJ, four of which he pleaded guilty to and four of which were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. The details of the four proceeded charges are as follows:', '(a)\\u2003committing an offence punishable under s 324 of the Penal Code 1871 (2020 Rev Ed) (\u201cPenal Code\u201d) (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means) by slashing the hand of Mr Wong Wei Jie (\u201cMr Wong\u201d), with a knife and causing him to suffer a right hand traumatic laceration on 17 February 2022 at about 8.40pm at Block 420A Clementi Avenue 1 (the \u201cFirst Charge\u201d);', '(b)\\u2003committing an offence punishable under s 506 of the Penal Code (criminal intimidation) by charging towards a police officer, Mr Tan Chuan Zhen, while brandishing a knife and threatening him with grievous hurt with intent to cause alarm on 17 February 2022 at about 8.55pm at 20 Clementi Avenue 5 (the \u201cSecond Charge\u201d);', '(c)\\u2003committing an offence punishable under s 506 of the Penal Code (criminal intimidation) by charging at Mr Goh Wui Teck (\u201cMr Goh\u201d) with a knife while threatening him with grievous hurt with intent to cause alarm on 17 February 2022 at about 8.45pm along Clementi Avenue 5 (the \u201cThird Charge\u201d); and', '(d)\\u2003committing an offence punishable under s 332 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty) by punching the face of a police officer who was on duty, one Saini bin Karim, and causing him to suffer from tenderness and swelling of his left temporoparietal region on 9 June 2019 at about 6.38pm at the Kampong Java Neighbourhood Police Centre (\u201cNPC\u201d) (the \u201cFourth Charge\u201d).', '6\\u2003MA 9220 only relates to the First, Second and Third Charges.', '7\\u2003In the proceedings below, the Prosecution tendered a Statement of Facts (\u201cSOF\u201d), which the Appellant admitted to without qualification. I set out the salient extracts from the SOF that relate to the First, Second and Third Charges which concern events that took place on 17 February 2022.', '8\\u2003Sometime in the morning of 17 February 2022, the Appellant went to Geylang and consumed cough syrup and diazepam without a prescription. That night, the Appellant went to his mother\u2019s house located at Clementi Avenue 1 (the \u201cUnit\u201d). At about 8.25pm, the Appellant called the police and reported that \u201cSomeone wants to kill me and my mother. I don\u2019t know how to explain. Can you stop asking me questions\u201d. After making the phone call to the police, the Appellant took a knife that was wrapped in newspaper and left the Unit.', '9\\u2003The Appellant then loitered along a pavement near the Unit. He claimed that he heard a voice telling him to slash members of the public at random, and so he waited for pedestrians to walk by.', '10\\u2003At about 8.39pm, the Appellant first approached a pedestrian. He ran after the pedestrian with the knife in his hand but stopped after a short distance, and the pedestrian managed to escape unhurt. Thereafter, the Appellant rewrapped the knife with newspaper. This incident was the subject of one of the charges against the Appellant that was taken into consideration.', '11\\u2003At about 8.40pm, the Appellant targeted Mr Wong, who was going on his usual evening stroll along the said pavement. When Mr Wong approached him, the Appellant suddenly took out the knife and swung it towards Mr Wong\u2019s head. Mr Wong used his hand to block the attack, resulting in the Appellant slashing Mr Wong\u2019s hand with the knife. Mr Wong immediately ran towards a nearby supermarket and the Appellant tried to run after him for a brief period. This formed the subject of the First Charge.', '12\\u2003Mr Wong was subsequently admitted to National University Hospital (\u201cNUH\u201d) for his injuries, where he was diagnosed with right hand traumatic laceration. Mr Wong underwent right hand debridement surgery and secondary closure of the right hand under local anaesthesia.', '13\\u2003After attacking Mr Wong, the Appellant continued to loiter along the pavement. When a female pedestrian walked towards him, the Appellant swung the knife in her direction, but she managed to escape unhurt. This was the subject of another charge against the Appellant that was taken into consideration.', '14\\u2003The Appellant then flagged a taxi driven by Mr Goh and asked to be driven to Clementi Police Division. The journey lasted about five minutes. As the taxi was approaching the Clementi Police Division along Clementi Avenue 5, the Appellant opened the left rear passenger door and attempted to leave while the taxi was still in motion. Mr Goh immediately stopped the taxi and the Appellant fell onto the road near the kerb, and lay on the ground for a few minutes.', '15\\u2003Mr Goh exited from the taxi to check on the Appellant. When Mr Goh was walking towards the Appellant, he noticed that the Appellant was holding a knife. The Appellant pointed the knife towards Mr Goh, who stepped back, but the Appellant charged at him with the knife in his hand. Mr Goh ran away and was unhurt. This formed the subject of the Third Charge.', '16\\u2003Mr Goh quickly returned to his taxi and locked the doors. While Mr Goh was in the locked taxi, the Appellant pointed the knife towards Mr Goh again. Mr Goh then proceeded to drive the taxi away, making a U-turn near the entrance to the Clementi Police Division, which was about 40m away, in order to alert the police officers who were there to the situation.', '17\\u2003The Appellant then turned his attention to the police officers who were on duty at the entrance to the Clementi Police Division. He walked towards them with a knife and was shouting incoherently. The police officers commanded the Appellant to stop and drop the knife, but the Appellant continued to advance forward. At about 8.55pm, the Appellant suddenly charged towards one of the police officers on duty while brandishing his knife. This formed the subject of the Second Charge.', '18\\u2003Sensing an imminent threat to the lives and safety of those present, the officer fired a live round at the Appellant, which struck his left arm, causing him to fall to the ground. Due to the gunshot wound, the Appellant suffered wounds over his left arm and a humeral midshaft fracture. The Appellant was then arrested and conveyed to NUH for treatment.', '19\\u2003The Fourth Charge is not strictly relevant to the present appeals as it has not been appealed against by either party. Nevertheless, I note that the Appellant was initially given a conditional warning for the Fourth Charge, but the charge was later proceeded with after he breached a Personal Protection Order.', '20\\u2003The Appellant suffers from at least three mental conditions. These are: (a) schizophrenia; (b) polysubstance dependence; and (c) psychosis that is believed to be triggered by his substance abuse and which caused symptoms of auditory hallucinations and persecutory delusions. For the purposes of this judgment, I shall refer to this last condition and its symptoms collectively as \u201csubstance-induced psychosis\u201d.', '21\\u2003Three psychiatric reports prepared by the Institute of Mental Health (\u201cIMH\u201d) provide some insight into these mental conditions. These reports were dated 12 July 2019, 12 December 2019 (both of which were prepared prior to the events that are the subject of the present appeals), and 10 March 2022 respectively (collectively, \u201cthe IMH Reports\u201d). A Corrective Training Suitability Report dated 20 October 2022 (\u201cCT Report\u201d) also provides relevant, albeit limited, evidence on the Appellant\u2019s mental conditions. I consider these reports in greater detail in this section.', '22\\u2003The IMH report dated 12 July 2019 (\u201c12 July 2019 IMH Report\u201d) was prepared by Dr Lim Kai Chong Daniel (\u201cDr Lim\u201d) in relation to an investigation into the Fourth Charge and after the Appellant\u2019s admissions to the IMH for two separate periods from 10 to 12 June 2019, and 23 to 26 June 2019. The 12 July 2019 IMH Report also recorded the Appellant as having a history of schizophrenia and polysubstance abuse.', '23\\u2003The following observations from the 12 July 2019 IMH Report are relevant:', '(a)\\u2003In relation to his first period of admission to the IMH between 10 June 2019 and 12 June 2019, the Appellant was assessed to have substance-induced psychosis from the cough syrup that he was abusing. The Appellant described psychotic symptoms such as auditory hallucinations and persecutory delusions. He heard voices that told him that he could not leave the police station, and directed him to hit the police officer on 9 June 2019. His psychotic symptoms resolved by 12 June 2019, and he was subsequently discharged.', '(b)\\u2003In relation to his second period of admission to the IMH between 23 June 2019 and 26 June 2019, the Appellant was assessed again to have drug-induced psychosis from the cough syrup that he had consumed just three or four days prior and subsequently experienced similar psychotic symptoms. Dr Lim also noted that the Appellant described depressive symptoms such as low mood and insomnia. His psychotic symptoms resolved by 26 June 2019 and he was discharged.', '24\\u2003While the 12 July 2019 IMH Report records that the Appellant was \u201cdiagnosed with [substance-induced] psychosis from the cough syrup that he was abusing\u201d, it does not provide any reasons or basis for this diagnosis. Moreover, the report also does not state whether the Appellant was informed or otherwise aware that his substance abuse was causally linked to the onset of his psychotic symptoms manifesting.', '25\\u2003The IMH Report dated 12 December 2019 (\u201c12 December 2019 IMH Report\u201d) was made by Dr Lee Yu Wei (\u201cDr Lee\u201d). This too was in relation to the investigation into the Fourth Charge regarding the \u201ccausality between the Appellant\u2019s mental disorder and his offending conduct\u201d. It is not clear what mental disorder Dr Lee was referring to.', '26\\u2003The following observations from the 12 December 2019 IMH Report are relevant:', '(a)\\u2003The Appellant\u2019s first attendance at IMH was on 4 July 2005 for substance abuse (intravenous Subutex and Dormicum use) and he was diagnosed with Subutex and Dormicum Dependence, against a background of heroin use.', '(b)\\u2003The Appellant\u2019s first admission to IMH was in 2006, after he suffered a fall from height while having an episode related to substance-induced psychosis.', '(c)\\u2003Prior to 2019, there were no documented instances of the Appellant exhibiting violent behaviour after abusing substances. The 12 December 2019 IMH Report listed \u201csome\u201d reasons for previous admissions, though these did not appear to be exhaustive. Moreover, while the report included examples of violent acts that were previously committed by the Appellant, it does not specify whether these acts were related to the Appellant\u2019s mental conditions or whether they were preceded by the Appellant\u2019s consumption of substances. Examples of the Appellant\u2019s violent acts included hitting a security guard while intoxicated in 2012 and threatening his mother with a knife, ostensibly due to his paranoia. I do not equate the Appellant\u2019s 2012 offence of hitting a security guard while intoxicated with his acts of violent behaviour while abusing substances (the subject of the present charges) and elaborate on this distinction at [64]-\u2013[66] and [84]\u2013[91] below. Notwithstanding these observations however, I should highlight that the CT Report records an instance where the Appellant may have exhibited violent behaviour while abusing substances. I address this below at [33].', '(d)\\u2003In 2019, Dr Lee noted that the Appellant had a total of five admissions between February and June. These admissions were due to auditory hallucinations associated with delusions of persecution that the head of a gang was going to find him and his mother and hurt them. The 12 July 2019 IMH Report also noted that his urine tested positive for opiates for at least two out of his five admissions in 2019. The details of two of these admissions were covered in the 12 July 2019 IMH Report (see [23] above).', '27\\u2003In relation to the Fourth Charge, Dr Lee opined that the Appellant was suffering from substance-induced psychosis at the time of the alleged offence. Dr Lee\u2019s assessment was that the Appellant was labouring under delusions of persecution, which led him to assault the police officer in order to be apprehended because he thought that being held in police custody would protect him from his persecutors. Dr Lee thus concluded as follows:', '(a)\\u2003while there was a significant contributory link between the Appellant\u2019s psychiatric condition and the alleged offence, he was cognisant of the nature and wrongness of his act and was not of unsound mind at the material time of the alleged offence;', '(b)\\u2003the Appellant was fit to plead\/enter a plea; and', '(c)\\u2003the Appellant would benefit significantly from adherence to medication, abstinence from substances and continued follow up with his treatment team.', '28\\u2003The IMH report dated 10 March 2022 (\u201c10 March 2022 IMH Report\u201d) was a forensic psychiatric evaluation prepared by Dr Lee Kim Huat Jason (\u201cDr Jason Lee\u201d) in connection with the investigation into the First to Third Charges. As highlighted at [21] above, the 10 March 2022 IMH Report was the sole Report that was prepared after the events that are the subject of the present appeals. The 10 March 2022 IMH Report outlined the Appellant\u2019s medical history, IMH records, collateral information from his mother, NUH records, the Appellant\u2019s account of the alleged offences and his mental state at the time of the interview.', '29\\u2003Dr Jason Lee stated that the Appellant was known to the IMH since 2005 and that he had a principal diagnosis of polysubstance dependence. While he had presented with florid psychotic features such as persecutory delusions and related auditory hallucinations in the past, these were believed to be substance-induced and not to be associated with a primary psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia.', '30\\u2003In relation to the Appellant\u2019s mental state during the time of the offences in February 2022, Dr Jason Lee drew the following conclusions:', '(a)\\u2003The Appellant\u2019s clinical presentation was consistent with substance-induced psychosis. This was based on the Appellant\u2019s ongoing abuse of various drugs in the period preceding the offences and the quick and complete resolution of psychotic symptoms upon abstinence from those drugs.', '(b)\\u2003There was clear evidence that the Appellant was actively psychotic around the time of the offences, and that his hallucinations and persecutory delusions \u201ccontributed substantially to the alleged offences by impairing his judgment and impulse control\u201d.', '(c)\\u2003However, the Appellant would have maintained at least some degree of awareness and control of his actions due to the goal-directed nature of the alleged offences. On balance, Dr Lee opined that the Appellant was not of unsound mind at the material time of the offences.', '(d)\\u2003The Appellant was fit to plead in court.', '(e)\\u2003The Appellant would benefit from prospective follow-up and treatment for his mental health issues, including interventions for his substance abuse problem.', '31\\u2003As I understand it, the effect of those findings was that the Appellant would not qualify for the defence of insanity. The findings were thus not directly concerned with the separate and distinct question of whether his mental responsibility was impaired save for the explicit finding noted at [30(b)] above, that his delusional hallucinations \u201ccontributed substantially\u201d to the commission of the offences.', '32\\u2003In the proceedings below, the DJ also called for a corrective training (\u201cCT\u201d) suitability report after the Appellant pleaded guilty. The CT Report was prepared by Ms Rashida Mohamed Zain (\u201cMs Zain\u201d), a psychologist from the Singapore Prison Service, with a view to assessing whether the Appellant should be sentenced to a corrective training term of at least five years. I note at the outset that this is not a report inquiring into the Appellant\u2019s psychiatric condition.', '33\\u2003While the CT Report highlighted that the Appellant reported an onset of psychosis in 2006, consisting of auditory hallucinations which urged him to slash at strangers with a weapon, it did not consider the possibility of the Appellant\u2019s substance-induced psychosis interacting with his other mental conditions, specifically his polysubstance dependence and schizophrenia. I note that the CT Report also listed the Appellant\u2019s past criminal history, including a conviction in 2008 for assaulting a public servant and inhalant abuse. However, while it appeared that the Appellant was charged for these offences on the same day (see the Appellant\u2019s antecedents at [38] below), there were no details provided in the CT Report or by the parties as to whether these offences occurred on the same day or whether the Appellant\u2019s inhalant abuse had precipitated his assault on the public servant. This being the case, I am unable to determine whether there was any apparent causal link between the Appellant\u2019s inhalant abuse and his violent behaviour in 2008.', '34\\u2003The CT Report also noted that when the Appellant was incarcerated in 2013, he was housed in the prison psychiatric housing unit, where he received treatment for his psychosis and learned adaptive coping ways which he then applied upon his release from prison. For instance, he would take a walk at the garden near his flat when he heard the voices, in order to relieve the stress he experienced. When the voices were too overpowering, the Appellant would accede to instructions conveyed by these voices to take a knife and walk around the neighbourhood, but then he would deliberately go to places where he thought there would be no one around in order to avoid injuring anyone. The Appellant also indicated that when his symptoms worsened, he would admit himself to IMH.', '35\\u2003The Appellant indicated that the psychiatric medications prescribed to him were effective in suppressing the auditory hallucinations and he stopped hearing them whenever he was medically compliant. In this regard, the Appellant reportedly informed Ms Zain that while he was medically compliant during the time of his violent offences, he had abused cough syrup, and this preceded his auditory hallucinations becoming active. The CT Report therefore concluded that the Appellant\u2019s mental disorder predisposed him to violence and that his substance abuse would precipitate violent reoffending.', '36\\u2003I pause to make three points in relation to this conclusion:', '(a)\\u2003First, it appears to be based on the Appellant\u2019s self-reported assessment of what had precipitated his violent behaviour and an \u201cattached psychiatric memo\u201d that indicated that the Appellant had substance-induced psychosis. In other words, there does not appear to have been a separate assessment undertaken at Ms Zain\u2019s request that led her to conclude that the Appellant\u2019s drug use would precipitate his violent behaviour. The \u201cattached psychiatric memo\u201d prepared by another psychiatrist is unhelpful, as it only states that the Appellant was of stable mental condition under medication and that he suffered from the sole mental illness of \u201csubstance-induced psychosis\u201d. There was no elaboration provided for this conclusion. In fairness to Ms Zain and as noted at [32] above, this was likely because the CT Report was solely to assess the Appellant\u2019s suitability for the CT regime and is not a report which specifically inquires into his psychiatric condition.', '(b)\\u2003Second, there is a difference between events occurring in a chronological sequence and events occurring in a consequential manner. While the Appellant\u2019s self-reported observations to Ms Zain supports a finding that his auditory hallucinations became active after he abused cough syrup, it does not go so far as to establish a consequential link between these events. In this regard, it is notable that there was also no separate expert evidence to establish that such a consequential link was present.', '(c)\\u2003Third, even if I were to assume, for the sake of argument, that there was a link between the Appellant\u2019s abuse of cough syrup and violent behaviour, it is pertinent that this observation was shared with Ms Zain after the offences that are the subject of the present appeals had been committed. This is not evidence of the Appellant\u2019s awareness of any link between his substance abuse and violent behaviour at the time of the commission of the offences. It is not evident, for instance, whether this was the outcome of the Appellant\u2019s reflections of the event, after the fact.', '37\\u2003In any case, I note that the observation apparently proffered by the Appellant (at [35] above) as to the cause of his auditory hallucinations was not relied on by the Prosecution. Instead, the Prosecution\u2019s conclusion that the Appellant\u2019s mental conditions should not be given mitigating weight was based on inferences drawn from the Appellant\u2019s antecedent history.', '38\\u2003I next outline the Appellant\u2019s antecedents, which can be grouped into three main categories: (a) violence-related offences; (b) drug and substance-related offences; and (c) other mischief-related offences. These are set out in the table below for ease of reference:'"}
{"casename":"2023_SGHC_205","fact":"facts that \nwere adduced in this Suit as his AEIC contained more arguments in meeting \nPrime\u2019s D&CC than facts. During cross-examination, Kuon did not dispute the \nobligations of Pro-Active as set out in the LOA and which Prime relied on in \nthe D&CC18. He further agreed that Pro-Active\u2019s contract was a re-measurement \ncontract19.  However, he repeatedly insisted that as Pro-Active did not carry out \nthe roof crown works, those works should simply be taken out of Pro-Active\u2019s \nscope of works and deducted from the contract price (to which Prime disagreed). \n38 On the issue of delay, Kuon\u2019s attention was drawn to Andrew\u2019s e-mail \nto Pro-Active dated 5 September 201920 which set out detailed instructions to \nKuon for various types of work on various floors. The e-mail contained the \nfollowing extracts:\nYou are advised of the following schedule which we have \nmanaged to plead from capital land, deference or slow progress \nand they will exercise their liquidated damage right. Originally \nwe are to handover Lv 2 to them partially from 30th Sept     \n\u2026\nWith this instructions (sic) and schedules, I hope this can guide \nyou towards planning to finish your contractual works onsite. \nDespite the clear wording in the above extracts, Kuon disputed Pro-Active was \nin delay in the contracted works. He said he did not reply to Andrew\u2019s e-mail as \nhe chose instead to complete the outstanding works as soon as possible. \n18 See Kuon\u2019s cross-examination at transcripts on 6 December 2022 at pp 15 and 24\u201325. \n19 Ibid p 22.\n20 Exhibited at p 85 of Kuon\u2019s AEIC.\nVersion No 2: 07 Aug 2023 (15:11 hrs)\nPro-Active Engineering Pte Ltd v \nPrime Structures Engineering Pte Ltd[2023] SGHC 205\n1439 The schedule of works for the roof crown on the 28th floor was exhibited \nin Andrew\u2019s AEIC21. His AEIC also contained e-mails from Prime to \nPro-Active22 that showed the latter was informed on 22 August 2019 that \napproval from the relevant authorities had been obtained for the roof crown \nworks and Pro-Active was instructed \u201cto proceed to start the purchase & \nfabrication of the roof crown steel works\u201d. Then on 30 August 201923, Andrew \ne-mailed Pro-Active to inquire about fabrication of the roof crown materials in \nChina. He further inquired about the proposed visit on 9 September 2019 to the \nChinese factory producing the materials by a checker from Arup Singapore Pte \nLtd (\u201cArup\u201d) and representatives from Prime and Capitaland. After the \ninspection, Andrew required Pro-Active to courier to Singapore for testing the \nraw steel and galvanised steel to be fabricated to ensure the latter complied with \nthe specifications S355 and Q345.\n40 On 31 October 201924, Andrew e-mailed to Pro-Active a formal delay \nnotice citing three instances of delayed works for the contracted works at level \n2. Prime gave notice that unless Pro-Active showed immediate and considerable \nimprovement, Prime would be forced to terminate Pro-Active\u2019s services and \nfind a replacement contractor.  Cross-examined, Kuon did not deny the delay25 \nbut pointed out it had nothing to do with the roof crown works. He did not reply \nbut decided to resolve the delay issue by adding more manpower to expedite the \noutstanding works.

He further \nclaimed there were no other letters informing Pro-Active of delays to works on \nlevels 1 and 2 and even on the 21st floor. Kuon disagreed the letter constituted \na final warning to Pro-Active. He added that Pro-Active completed the \nscheduled works in November or December 2019. \n41 Kuon was then confronted with Andrew\u2019s e-mail dated 6 December \n201927 where Andrew noted Pro-Active only had eight workers on-site on 5 \nDecember with five workers on night shift, even though there were three main \nareas of work and that was \u201cthe last straw\u201d. Andrew added\nI\u2019m also tired of arranging supply workers for you and using \nyabo men to falsely cover up your manpower.\nAndrew\u2019s reference to \u201cYabo\u201d was to another subcontractor of Prime. Despite \nAndrew\u2019s aforesaid e-mail, Kuon disagreed inadequate manpower was one \nreason for the delay in Pro-Active\u2019s works.28  \n42 Adding to Pro-Active\u2019s woes, Prime had as far back as July 2019, e-\nmailed Kuon29 that Prime\u2019s quality assessor\/control engineer had issued non-\nconformance reports (\u201cNCR\u201d) against Pro-Active for missing anchor bolts\/nuts \nand rusty bolts\/nuts.

This was after the inspection of the \nfactory in China as is apparent from the extracts set out below from Shimizu\u2019s \ne-mail:  \nWe were very disappointed after the visit to China factory. The \nfirst batch of material for Zone C (6 sets) was expected to be \nloaded for shipment to Singapore ETA on 29 Nov. 19 but was \nstill in the process of welding and fabrication, not even 1 set \nwas painted.\nZone A materials (6 sets) were shown to our representatives, \nMr. Bablu and Mr. Yokota but cannot tell if they are fully \naccountable. There are no sign of Zone B material. \nThese have totally deviated from your plan submitted to us on \n11 Nov. 2019.\nAlthough Kuon admitted he sourced for the factory, he disagreed that he failed \nto ensure that the fabrication and supply was on schedule. Kuon claimed that \nPrime, and Andrew in particular, was in close contact and liaised direct with, \nQingdao Co. However, because he was originally in charge of doing the \ninstallation, Kuon claimed he took the initiative to make sure the materials \nwould arrive in Singapore in time for the installation. He merely acted as a \ncoordinator to ensure the materials were shipped to Singapore32. \n31 See p 43 of Andrew\u2019s AEIC. \n32 See transcripts on 6 December 2019 at p 44.  \nVersion No 2: 07 Aug 2023 (15:11 hrs)\nPro-Active Engineering Pte Ltd v \nPrime Structures Engineering Pte Ltd[2023] SGHC 205\n1744 Kuon maintained his stand even when Pro-Active installed undersized \nsteel frames, according to an e-mail from Shimizu to Andrew dated 28 August \n2019.33  \n45 Kuon\u2019s attention was drawn to Andrew\u2019s e-mail to Kuon, with Sonny \nand Frankie as recipients as well, on 6 December 2019, setting out a catch-up \nschedule with a delay of seven days to the original date of 30 January 2020. \nAndrew added that there was a need for three fabrication factories and a separate \nfactory for painting was required. \n46 On 13 December 201934, Shimizu rejected Prime\u2019s programme to finish \nthe installation portion of the roof crown works by February 2020. Shimizu cited \nthe reason for the delay to works on levels 1, 2 and 21 to be due to poor \nperformance and shortage of manpower. Questioned, Kuon claimed he was in \nChina when Shimizu\u2019s e-mail was received. He said there was no discussion \nabout a third party contractor taking over the roof crown works because while \nhe was in China, the focus then was on the schedule of work and arranging for \nthe materials to be shipped to Singapore. Kuon added he did not receive any \ndelay notice either from Prime or Shimizu. He claimed he was unaware of \nShimizu\u2019s meeting with Prime on 12 December 2019 and denied he was told by \nFrankie in a telephone call after that meeting that Pro-Active need not carry out \nthe installation component of the roof crown works.  \n47 Kuon claimed that Frankie had informed him only on or about 15 \nDecember 2019 that Shimizu was considering looking for another subcontractor \n33 At pp 25\u201336 of Andrew\u2019s AEIC.  \n34 See AB882.\nVersion No 2: 07 Aug 2023 (15:11 hrs)\nPro-Active Engineering Pte Ltd v \nPrime Structures Engineering Pte Ltd[2023] SGHC 205\n18(Kong Hwee). Andrew told him over the telephone on 27 December 2019 that \nPro-Active\u2019s services were terminated. Kuon testified35 he felt \u201cbetrayed\u201d as he \nhad provided so much assistance and co-ordinated the shipment to Singapore of \nthe steel supplied by Qingdao Co. He was then still in China36 and returned to \nSingapore on 4 January 2020. \n48 Kuon further denied receiving an e-mail dated 16 December 201937 (see \np 382 of Sonny\u2019s AEIC) from a fa\u00e7ade checker Sonny Roflo (\u201cRoflo\u201d) from \nArup, stationed at Qingdao Co, who pointed to the fabricated steel being non-\ncompliant with the specifications set out earlier at [ 39].  Thereafter, Pro-Active \nwas back charged by Prime $11,242.23 on 30 November 2019 for Roflo\u2019s visits \nin September\/October 2019 for the inspection. Arup had charged Prime for \nRoflo\u2019s inspection visit and in turn Prime back charged Pro-Active. Kuon \ndisputed this back-charge38 on the basis it was never agreed to by Pro-Active. \nKuon pointed out that as the installation works had been taken out of Pro-\nActive\u2019s scope of works, Pro-Active should not have to bear the back charge. If \nthere was to be inspection, the inspection should have been done in Singapore.   \n49 Even though Prime on Pro-Active\u2019s behalf paid the L\/C amount of \n$275,00039 to Qingdao Co, Kuon initially would not admit that it was due to \nPro-Active\u2019s financial difficulties, until pressed by the court for his answer40. \nHe had further agreed that Pro-Active would pay Prime 3% commission for the \n35 See transcripts on 7 December 2022 at p 117.\n36 See transcripts on 6 December 2022 at p 45.\n37 See p 382 of Sonny\u2019s AEIC.\n38 See transcripts on 7 December 2022 at p 121.  \n39 At AB582.\n40 See transcripts on 6 December 2022 at p 56.\nVersion No 2: 07 Aug 2023 (15:11 hrs)\nPro-Active Engineering Pte Ltd v \nPrime Structures Engineering Pte Ltd[2023] SGHC 205\n19issuance of the L\/C in his e-mail to Prime dated 2 September 201941 and yet, he \ndisputed Prime\u2019s claim for interest on the L\/C.  \n50 In his AEIC, Kuon42 had deposed that he purchased nuts and bolts for \nthe roof crown works. This statement was found to be untrue when he was cross-\nexamined43.   \n51 It was said by Kuon during re-examination44 that the contractual \ncompletion date of 30 June 2019 kept being pushed back due to changes in \ndrawings which necessitated the purchase of additional materials. The change \nin drawings (which was sometimes more than one revision) resulted in an \nincrease of 2.5 times in tonnage of raw materials. \nPrime\u2019s case \n52 As stated earlier at [ 36], Prime had three witnesses. Sonny was Prime\u2019s \nfirst witness. Nothing really turns on Sonny\u2019s testimony. As the managing-\ndirector of Prime, he was not on site at the project unlike Andrew and Frankie \nalthough he attended site meetings either at the site office of Shimizu or at its \noffice. However, Sonny was aware of site conditions and of Pro-Active\u2019s work \nprogress. He would be updated on work progress by either Andrew and\/or \nFrankie, at site meetings and\/or from correspondence exchanged between Prime \nand Pro-Active or between Shimizu and Prime. \n41 See AB863.\n42 At para 27. \n43 See transcripts on 7 December 2022 at p 103. \n44 Ibid at p 110\u2013111.\nVersion No 2: 07 Aug 2023 (15:11 hrs)\nPro-Active Engineering Pte Ltd v \nPrime Structures Engineering Pte Ltd[2023] SGHC 205\n2053 In his AEIC45, Sonny set out a chronology of Pro-Active\u2019s work \nperformance. He deposed that by early December 2019 it became apparent to \nPrime that Pro-Active did not have the manpower to carry out the installation \ncomponent and the Variation Order in relation to the roof crown works. Around \nthat time, Shimizu had already informed Prime that if those works could not be \ncarried out according to schedule, Shimizu would take over the installation \ncomponent of the roof crown works and look to Prime for all costs incurred \nthereby. Hence, Prime, via Andrew, issued the catch-up schedule to Pro-Active \non 6 December 2019. Sonny deposed in his AEIC46 that on or about the same \nday, Shimizu informed Prime that Shimizu had no confidence in Pro-Active\u2019s \ncarrying out the installation component of the roof crown works.  This was then \nfollowed by Shimizu\u2019s e-mail of 13 December 2019 set out at [ 82] below.   \n54 Frankie was Prime\u2019s second witness. He no longer works for Prime as a \nproject director and has in fact left the construction industry altogether. \n55 Frankie confirmed he telephoned Kuon on 12 December 2019 while the \nlatter was in China to inform Kuon that Pro-Active need not do the roof crown \ninstallation works. On that day. Frankie had also flown to China after making \nthe call to Kuon. Frankie denied Kuon\u2019s allegation that someone from Prime \nhad called and told Kuon the news on 27 December 2019.  \n56 Andrew was Prime\u2019s third and last witness. Like Frankie, Andrew no \nlonger works for Prime. He left Prime\u2019s services around June 202147.  \n45 At para 17.\n46 At para 17(e).\n47 See transcripts on 28 February 2023 at p 202.\nVersion No 2: 07 Aug 2023 (15:11 hrs)\nPro-Active Engineering Pte Ltd v \nPrime Structures Engineering Pte Ltd[2023] SGHC 205\n2157 During cross-examination, Andrew disclosed48 that Pro-Active started \nconstruction late. It should have started with the fabrication and supply of the \nsteel columns for the roof crown on 18 July 2019 but only did so on or about 31 \nOctober 2019. Andrew recalled that Pro-Active purchased the steel materials \nearly (by October 2019) but for reasons unknown to him, Pro-Active could not \nget the fabrication done before December 2019.\n58 Part of the problem was due to Pro-Active\u2019s inability to get the required \nsteel grade (355) from China. Pro-Active then proposed an alternative steel \ngrade (Q345B or C) which necessitated Prime\u2019s engineer going back to the BCA \nfor fresh approval. \n59 Counsel for Pro-Active suggested to Andrew that the changes in \ndrawings made by Prime caused Pro-Active\u2019s delay, one example being the \nincrease in size of the baseplates (without holes) for the trusses (see [ 10] above). \nAndrew agreed with counsel that there were other changes in the drawings but \ntestified that those changes were minor.\n60 Andrew testified that as Prime\u2019s project manager, his issue with Pro-\nActive was that the latter was slow in its work \u2013 it was all due to their having \ninsufficient manpower to carry out the contracted works. He had no issues with \nthe quality of Pro-Active\u2019s work. Due to Pro-Active\u2019s inadequate manpower, its \nscope of works started to stack-up, resulting in delays when additional \nmanpower was not deployed49 both for the contracted works as well as for the \nremedial works.\n48 Ibid at p 206.\n49 Ibid at pp 215 & 216.\nVersion No 2: 07 Aug 2023 (15:11 hrs)\nPro-Active Engineering Pte Ltd v \nPrime Structures Engineering Pte Ltd[2023] SGHC 205\n2261 Counsel for Pro-Active had suggested to both Sonny and Andrew that if \nindeed Pro-Active was slow, Prime would not have requested Pro-Active to take \nover Yabo\u2019s scope of works50. Sonny explained that the roof trellis work was a \nvery small piece of work, it was not part of the critical path and it would not \nhave caused any delay51. Indeed, Andrew disclosed that it was Pro-Active that \nhad requested more work in order to increase its profits. Yabo was then in \ncharge of aluminium works in the roof trellis which work involved some \nelement of steel works. Pro-Active requested Andrew that it be allowed to take \nover Yabo\u2019s works at the roof trellis since it already had the manpower for the \nroof crown works. Andrew was agreeable to Pro-Active\u2019s request provided \nYabo agreed, which it did. The Variation Order alluded to at [14]52 included the \ntrellis works.    \n62 When the court questioned Andrew53 on Prime\u2019s scope of works for the \nproject, he testified it included levels 1 and 2 which steelworks were \nsubcontracted to Pro-Active. Due to Pro-Active\u2019s supply and installation of steel \nnot in accordance with BCA\u2019s approved thickness, all of the steel works \ninstalled by Pro-Active had to be dismantled and replaced, resulting in a delay \nof 4\u20135 months. By then the cladding had already been done and that too had to \nbe torn down.   \n50 Ibid at p 216. \n51 See transcripts on 8 December 2022 at pp 140\u2013141.\n52 At AB537.\n53 See transcripts on 28 February 2023 at pp 234\u2013235.  \nVersion No 2: 07 Aug 2023 (15:11 hrs)\nPro-Active Engineering Pte Ltd v \nPrime Structures Engineering Pte Ltd[2023] SGHC 205\n23The submissions \n63 Before the court makes its findings, it would be appropriate at this \njuncture to look at the submissions put forward by the parties after the close of \nthe trial. \n(i) Pro-Active\u2019s submissions\n64 In Pro-Active\u2019s closing submissions54,  it was submitted that it would be \nunjust and unfair for Prime to be allowed to add the value of the entire roof \ncrown works to the contract sum and then purport to deduct a large back charge \nfor the same. That would mean that Pro-Active performed the entire roof crown \nworks when Pro-Active was instructed not to (at least for the installation \ncomponent).\n65 Pro-Active argued that the installation component of the roof crown \nworks must be removed or \u201cde-scoped\u201d from Pro-Active\u2019s scope of works, since \nthat component was taken over by Shimizu. That was because according to the \nLOA55, it is a re-measurement contract. Pro-Active then made the following \ncalculations, based on \u201cde-scoping\u201d the installation of the roof crown from its \nscope of works:\n288,480kg x $2.80 per kg $807,744.00\nLess: \nPayment to Qingdao via letter of credit $765,865.00\n$  41,879.00\n54 At para 20(c).\n55 See AB511 clause 1.2.  \nVersion No 2: 07 Aug 2023 (15:11 hrs)\nPro-Active Engineering Pte Ltd v \nPrime Structures Engineering Pte Ltd[2023] SGHC 205\n24Even taking into account 3% interest charged by Prime on the payment to \nQingdao Co ie, $22,975.95 ($765,865.00 x 3%), a sum of $18,903.05 is still \npayable to Pro-Active by Prime ($41,879.00 - $22,975.95).\n66 Pro-Active further submitted56 that as there is no extension of time \nclause in the LOA, time is set at large. There was also the addition of the \nVariation Order. Therefore, Pro-Active was required to complete the contracted \nworks within a reasonable time as opposed to a contractually stipulated \ndeadline.  Pro-Active alleged that besides the Variation Order, Prime had \nengaged in acts of prevention (not specified) that caused delays in the project. \nIt should not be allowed to take advantage of its own wrongdoing, citing Peak \nConstruction (Liverpool) Ltd v McKinney Foundations Ltd [1970] 1 BLR 111 \n(\u201cPeak Construction\u201d).  \n67 Pro-Active drew a distinction57 between delays caused by Pro-Active \nand those caused by Prime. Pro-Active alleged that there was evidence that even \nbefore the LOA was signed on 28 February 2019, Shimizu had complained of \nPrime\u2019s slow progress on site. Pro-Active relied on its counsel\u2019s cross-\nexamination of Frankie58 and Shimizu\u2019s e-mail to Prime dated 27 February \n201959.  This submission is incorrect as Frankie had pointed out60 that Shimizu\u2019s \ncomplaint related to the monitoring of the mock-up schedule and had nothing \nto do with the main scope of works.\n56 At para 22 of its closing submissions. \n57 Ibid at para 33.\n58 At transcripts on 8 December 2019 at pp 179\u2013180. \n59 At AB903. \n60 At transcripts on 8 December 2019 at p 181.   \nVersion No 2: 07 Aug 2023 (15:11 hrs)\nPro-Active Engineering Pte Ltd v \nPrime Structures Engineering Pte Ltd[2023] SGHC 205\n2568 Pro-Active made much of the fact61 that there was no evidence tendered \nby Prime in respect of correspondence between Positive (who was Prime\u2019s \nimmediate main contractor62) and Prime and between Positive and Shimizu. It \nargued that it was pure speculation to decipher what Positive\u2019s stance was in \nrespect of Shimizu\u2019s decision to engage a third party contractor (Kong Hwee) \nto carry out the roof crown installation. Prime had produced Shimizu\u2019s letter \ndated 18 March 2020 to Positive63 and Shimizu\u2019s contra charge of the same \ndate64 to Positive in the amount of $652,918.10. However, there was no \nevidence that those contra charges were back charged to Prime and there was \nalso no privity of contract between Shimizu and Prime.\n69 Pro-Active raised the possibility65 that Positive had reached a \ncompromise with Shimizu in respect of Kong Hwee\u2019s engagement and that may \nexplain the lack of evidence in respect of Positive\u2019s back charge to Prime for \nthe installation cost of the roof crown. Hence, Prime has not shown it incurred \nthe installation cost. Accordingly, Pro-Active should not be liable for such costs \nas it was no longer the responsibility of Pro-Active (which was also Prime\u2019s \ncase).66 Pro-Active accused Prime of being opportunistic and wrongfully \nwithholding payment to Pro-Active.

If the supply and fabrication components of the roof crown works \nwere not \u201cde-scoped\u201d from the contracted works, it meant that Prime would still \nhave to pay Pro-Active $41,879.00 based on the following calculations: \n288,480 kg x $2.80 per kg of steel $807,744.00\nLess:\nPayment to Qingdao Co $765,865.00\n$  41, 879.00\nFor the reasons set out below at [ 107]\u2013[ 108] and [ 120], the court disagrees with \nPro-Active\u2019s calculations and does not accept that the roof crown works had \nbeen \u201cde-scoped\u201d from the contracted works by reason of Shimizu\u2019s decision to \nremove those works from Pro-Active\u2019s contract.  \n71 Pro-Active had argued67 that whilst \u201cde-scoping\u201d the roof crown works \nmay affect the heads of items that are calculated in deriving the contract sum \nand in calculating the sum Pro-Active is entitled to, there will not be a \nsignificant effect on the amount that is ultimately derived. That argument is \nmisconceived as can be seen from the court\u2019s calculations set out at [ 129] below. \n72 Pro-Active had further submitted that Prime failed to provide reasonable \nnotice to Pro-Active to \u201cde-scope\u201d the installation component of the roof crown \nworks.

The court is of the view that the instances cited by Prime \nconstitute breaches by Pro-Active of clause 9 of the LOA. The relevant portion \nof that clause headed Termination states:\n9.1 If the Subcontractor should commit any of the \nfollowings:\n9.1.1 Fail to proceed the Subcontract Works \nexpeditiously and with due diligence either in whole or \nin part;\n\u2026\n9.2 The Contractor fully reserves the right to serve upon the \nSubcontractor a notice of termination stating the default \ncommitted by the Subcontractor, and requiring the \nSubcontractor to immediately cease and rectify the same.   \n74 Clause 9.1 of the LOA is reinforced by clause 3.2 which states:\nThe subcontractor shall proceed with the Works diligently and \nwith due expedition at all times in accordance with the \nrespective time for completion as stipulated in the Contractor\u2019s \nconstruction schedule with and including any revisions thereto. \nIf in the Contractor\u2019s view that the works is (sic) in delay, the \nSubcontractor must implement among others but not limited to \nthe addition of skill workforce and resources, double shift works \nand all other necessary resources and equipment to mitigate \nthe delays at NO additional cost to the Contractor.

S 14(1) of the \nEA requires the tribunal to consider whether \u201cgrounds or misconduct \ninconsistent with the fulfilment of the express or implied conditions of the \nemployee\u2019s service\u201d is proven. Furthermore, under s 14(3) of the EA, the \nTribunal may order a reinstatement or award compensation should it find that \nno just cause for dismissal existed. These legal issues require the Tribunal to \ninquire into allegations of breaches by Lim of his employment obligations. All \nthat are precisely the subject matter of the High Court Suit.

On 22 November 2022, the claimant commenced OC 406 against the defendant. The claim in OC 406 is for the breach of a loan agreement between the parties (the \u201cLoan Agreement\u201d). By the terms of the Loan Agreement, the claimant extended a sum of US$1,100,000 to the defendant. In exchange, the defendant agreed to repay the claimant the sum of US$1,950,000 within approximately six months. Thus, the claimant\u2019s case is premised on the repayment of a sum provided for in the Loan Agreement.', '4\\u2003On 16 December 2022, the defendant filed the Defence in OC 406. The defendant\u2019s case is that, among others: (a) he never received any money under the Loan Agreement because the sum of US$1,099,911.66 that had been transferred to him was to purchase a \u201cApek Vantage Unit\u201d on behalf of the claimant and his associates; and (b) he does not recall executing the Loan Agreement. In essence, the defendant says that the supposed loan was not really a loan, and that even if it was a loan, he does not recall entering into it.', '5\\u2003On 13 January 2023, the claimant commenced SUM 104 to seek summary judgment against the defendant. On 14 April 2023, the learned Assistant Registrar (the \u201cAR\u201d) granted summary judgment for the claimant in the sum of US$1,950,000 together with interest. The learned AR first found that the claimant had made out a prima facie case on the basis of the Loan Agreement, which clearly obliged the defendant to repay the sum of US$1,950,000. The learned AR then concluded that the defendant did not show that there were any triable issues or that he had a bona fide defence. In this regard, the learned AR observed that the defendant did not plead that the Loan Agreement was a sham or that it had been forged. Further, the learned AR found that the defendant\u2019s attempt to recharacterise the Loan Agreement as not being a loan was incoherent and that this attempt did not explain how the defendant came to sign the Loan Agreement that was clearly stipulated to be a loan.', '6\\u2003On 24 April 2023, the defendant filed an appeal against the learned AR\u2019s decision in SUM 104. On 4 May 2023, the defendant requested his solicitors to instruct Mr N Sreenivasan SC (\u201cMr Sreenivasan\u201d) to argue the appeal. It was in this context that the defendant took out the present application on 15 May 2023. The defendant sought to add two defendants to the counterclaim. The defendants also sought amendments to the Defence across eight broad areas, namely: 1', '(a)\\u2003to amend the timeframe during which: (i) the defendant intended to purchase one Vantage Equipment Unit for the purposes of refurbishment and resale for profit; and (ii) the claimant and Bryan (who is the claimant\u2019s associate) expressed interest to similarly acquire a Vantage Equipment Unit for refurbishment and resale;', '(b)\\u2003to add the defence that the Loan Agreement is not enforceable as it is not supported by consideration;', '(c)\\u2003to add the defence that the Loan Agreement is an illegal moneylending agreement and is therefore unenforceable;', '(d)\\u2003to make clear that no loan amount was transferred to the defendant pursuant to the Loan Agreement and, therefore, there was no obligation for the defendant to make payment on the \u201cEquipment Sale Price\u201d under the Loan Agreement;', '(e)\\u2003to make clear how the Loan Agreement had been varied by conduct;', '(f)\\u2003to add the defence that the proper interpretation of the Loan Agreement is that it is implied that the payment of the \u201cEquipment Sale Price\u201d by the defendant to the claimant was contingent on the Apek Vantage Unit being sold at the \u201cEquipment Sale Price\u201d of US$1,950,000, and\/or that any interest charged for late payment was on the \u201cLoan Amount\u201d of US$1,100,000 and not the \u201cEquipment Sale Price\u201d of US$1,950,000;', '(g)\\u2003to add the defence that the interest charged for late payment is a penalty clause and is therefore unenforceable; and', '(h)\\u2003to add the defence of set-off in light of the counterclaim commenced against the claimant, Bryan, and Apek. By way of background, the defendant commenced the counterclaim on the basis that, if the defendant is found liable to the claimant under the Loan Agreement, then the defendant should be given compensation for the Apek Vantage Unit that was shipped out due to the claimant, Bryan, and\/or Apek for zero benefit to the defendant.', '7\\u2003With these background facts, as well as the amendments sought by the defendant, in mind, I turn now to the applicable law.'"}

{"casename":"2023_SGHC_218","fact":"facts that gave rise to"}
{"casename":"2023_SGHC_219","fact":"the facts of this case and the DJ\u2019s decision, I do not \nfind that there was a fundamental error occasioning a clear failure of justice. In \nmy view, the DJ\u2019s disposal orders were consistent with the law as it stands. My \nviews on each of the DJ\u2019s disposal orders are as follows:\n(a) In relation to the sum of $34,000 in Watch Capital\u2019s bank \naccount, the DJ was correct to find that both the appellant and Watch \nCapital fulfilled the precondition of being in lawful possession of the \nseized property. On the part of the appellant, the sum of $34,000 \noriginated from the appellant\u2019s bank account and the transfer of the sum \nwas procured by fraud perpetrated by an unknown individual on the \npretext of the appellant purchasing USDT. Watch Capital, on the other \nVersion No 1: 10 Aug 2023 (15:00 hrs)\nGuo Wei v PP[2023] SGHC 219\n7hand, had received the sum of $34,000 as part of a legitimate contractual \ntransaction involving the sale of the Rolex Watch, without any \nindication of criminal behaviour on its part. Here, I emphasise that there \nwas no evidence adduced in the court below to suggest that Watch \nCapital was aware of or involved in the scam perpetrated against the \nappellant. The appellant also did not take the position that Watch Capital \nwas aware of or involved in the scam. In a case where both claimants \nhave satisfied the precondition of being in lawful possession of the \nproperty, and there is no further evidence available as to who has a \nbetter claim, the court in William Lim made clear (at [56]) that the \nproperty should be returned to the lawful possessor of the property at \nthe point of seizure. In this case, Watch Capital was in lawful possession \nof the sum of $34,000 at the point of seizure and there was no further \nevidence available as to who had a better claim. Therefore, the DJ was \ncorrect to order that the sum of $34,000 in Watch Capital\u2019s bank account \nbe released to Watch Capital.\n(b) In relation to the Rolex Watch seized from The Finest Time, the \nDJ was correct to find that both the appellant and The Finest Time \nfulfilled the precondition of being in lawful possession of the seized \nproperty. The Rolex Watch was released by Watch Capital upon receipt \nof the sum of $34,000 from the appellant\u2019s bank account, and \nsubsequently sold by intermediaries to The Finest Time. The appellant \nfulfilled the precondition of being in lawful possession of the Rolex \nWatch because it was traceable to the sum of $34,000 transferred by the \nappellant to Watch Capital. On the other hand, The Finest Time obtained \nthe Rolex Watch as part of a legitimate contractual transaction involving \nthe purchase of the Rolex Watch for $31,000, without any indication of \ncriminal behaviour on its part. Here, there was again no evidence \nVersion No 1: 10 Aug 2023 (15:00 hrs)\nGuo Wei v PP[2023] SGHC 219\n8adduced in the court below to suggest that The Finest Time was aware \nof or involved in the scam perpetrated against the appellant. The \nappellant also did not take the position that The Finest Time was aware \nof or involved in the scam. Therefore, the DJ was correct to order that \nthe Rolex Watch be released to The Finest Time, since The Finest Time \nwas in lawful possession of the Rolex Watch at the point of seizure and \nthere was no further evidence available as to who had a better claim.\n(c) In relation to the sum of $10,540.10 in Elroy\u2019s bank account, the \nappellant appears to assert that this sum comprises proceeds of the scam \nwhich Elroy was involved in. However, the appellant was unable to \nadduce any evidence of this in the court below. Rather, based on the \nevidence in the court below, most of the proceeds from the scam \nperpetrated against the appellant were dissipated shortly after the sum \nwas transferred by the appellant out of his bank account. According to \nElroy, the sum in his bank account constituted moneys from his own \nbusiness and were unrelated to the present case. Elroy adduced his bank \nstatements as evidence which showed numerous transactions unrelated \nto the present case and which supported his claim. Ultimately, as was \nstated by the investigation officer in the course of cross-examination at \nthe disposal inquiry, the police were unable to ascertain if the sum in \nElroy\u2019s bank account were criminal proceeds given that there were \ndeposits and withdrawals that were unrelated to this case (see Notes of \nEvidence, 3 October 2022 at page 17). Given the state of the evidence, \nthe appellant had not been able to show any interest in the seized sum in \nElroy\u2019s bank account. In contrast, Elroy had shown that he had an \ninterest in the sum. Therefore, the DJ was correct to order that the sum \nof $10,540.10 be released to Elroy since he was the only one who was \nentitled to the sum.\nVersion No 1: 10 Aug 2023 (15:00 hrs)\nGuo Wei v PP[2023] SGHC 219\n9(d) Finally, in relation to the sums of $2,554.82 in Wee\u2019s bank \naccount, $3,537.80 in Wong\u2019s bank account and $2,000 in cash \ncomprising sums seized from Gabriel, Fairus and Bryan, I find that the \nDJ was justified to order that these sums be forfeited to the State. Wee, \nWong, Gabriel, Fairus and Bryan did not lay claim to the amounts which \nwere seized from them. However, notably, the appellant was unable to \nshow any interest in the seized sums apart from a bare assertion that \nthese were proceeds from the scam perpetrated against him. In the \nabsence of any evidence to support the appellant\u2019s assertion, the DJ was \ncorrect to exercise her discretion to order that the sums be forfeited to \nthe State.\n11 The appellant has stated in his written submissions that this was a \n\u201ctriangular fraud\u201d involving multiple victims and that responsibility should be \nshared among the various victims. The appellant also asserts that placing the \n\u201centirety of the blame\u201d on him would be unfair. However, I think it is important \nto explain to the appellant here that a disposal inquiry is not conclusive as to \ntitle. A disposal inquiry is simply an inexpensive and expeditious manner of \ndistributing items seized by the police in the course of investigations. While the \noutcome of the disposal inquiry may be such that the appellant feels that he is \nbeing penalised while the other claimants, Watch Capital and The Finest Time, \nare able to retain the sum of $34,000 and the Rolex Watch respectively, based \non the law as it stands, the DJ did not err in the orders which were made. There \nwas, therefore, no fundamental error occasioning a clear failure of justice.\n12 What is crucial to highlight to the appellant is that the orders made in a \ndisposal inquiry do not preclude parties from commencing a civil suit to assert \ntheir rights. A disposal inquiry is simply not the appropriate forum to \nconclusively decide on title. I am, however, in no way suggesting that the \nVersion No 1: 10 Aug 2023 (15:00 hrs)\nGuo Wei v PP[2023] SGHC 219\n10appellant should commence a civil suit as this is a decision for the appellant to \nmake based on legal advice if he decides to seek such advice.\n13 For the reasons above, I dismiss"}

Instead, Winson urgently proceeded with its second \npresentations, and pressed for payment on the LCs.\n(H) CONCLUSION ON WINSON\u2019S STATE OF MIND AT THE TIME OF THE SECOND \nPRESENTATIONS\n164 Based on a review of events up to the time of the second presentations, \nI conclude that by that time Winson did not believe in the truth of the \nrepresentations in its LOIs \u2013 at the very least, it was indifferent to whether its \nrepresentations were true or not, in which case it did not believe in their truth.

We did not involve in any shipping \narrangements of the Goods and is not privy to the contract \nbetween Trafigura and its supplier of the goods.\nBased on the IJM Letter, there is a concern that Trafigura might \nnot be able to honour its warranties set out in the LOI. \n170 Winson then said it had instructed UBS to honour Trafigura\u2019s \npresentation, but Winson sought to persuade Natixis to place the proceeds of the \nLC into a suspense account pending further investigations and clarifications \nfrom the IJM. It is noteworthy that Winson described itself as a middleman not \ninvolved in any shipping arrangements of the goods. There was no reference to \nany checks Winson made with Trafigura about the goods, as Winson in these \nproceedings claims to have done.\n171 There is similarly no reference to any such checks in Winson\u2019s \nsubsequent email of 22 May 2020 to Natixis,97 in which Winson said:\nPursuant to the IJM letter dated 14 May 2020 and the fact that \nTrafigura has failed to honour our demand for the production \nof the original bills of lading pursuant to our email dated 22 \nMay 2020, it is highly unlikely that Trafigura would be able to \nhonour its warranties and undertakings set out in the LOI.\n172 On 26 May 2020, Winson wrote to Mashreqbank (which had \ncountersigned the other Trafigura LOI \u2013 that in respect of the Ocean Voyager).98 \n96 17AB 246\u2013247. \n97 17AB 241\u2013242.\n98 17AB 249.\nVersion No 2: 18 Aug 2023 (16:33 hrs)\nWinson Oil Trading Pte Ltd v[2023] SGHC 220\nOversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd\n57That correspondence was in even stronger terms. Winson asserted that the LOI \ncontained various misrepresentations. Winson referred to the IJMs\u2019 letter of \n8 May 2020 and said that by then \u2013 when Trafigura received the IJM letter \u2013 \nTrafigura knew of certain facts which were contrary to representations in the \nLOI, yet Trafigura proceeded to present the LOI on 22 May 2020.\n173 On 23 July 2020, Trafigura wrote to Winson,99 asking if it was still \nWinson\u2019s position that Trafigura had failed to pass good title to Winson in \nrespect of the cargo on the Ocean Voyager and Ocean Taipan.\n174 In its response on 30 July 2020,100 Winson backed down from the \nposition it had taken earlier. Winson did not maintain that Trafigura had not \npassed good title to it; instead Winson said, \u201cAs pointed out by the IJMs of HL \nand [OTPL], it is now not entirely clear which parties are entitled to the Cargoes. \nAccordingly, we are not in a position to opine whether you have passed good \ntitle of the Cargoes to us.\u201d\n175 Winson was in an uncomfortable position: OCBC and SCB were not \npaying it, while Trafigura had presented LOIs for payment on the LCs that \nWinson had procured. Winson took the position that Trafigura had fraudulently \nmade false representations \u2013 at least in respect of Trafigura\u2019s LOI for the Ocean \nVoyager \u2013 but Winson did not seek to stop Trafigura from receiving payment. \nIn the present proceedings Winson then contended that the equivalent \nrepresentations in its own LOIs were not false, and in any event were not made \nfraudulently.\n99 17AB 287.\n100 17AB 289.\nVersion No 2: 18 Aug 2023 (16:33 hrs)\nWinson Oil Trading Pte Ltd v[2023] SGHC 220\nOversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd\n58176 I have found that Winson did make false representations in its LOIs. By \nMay 2020, Winson evidently believed that false representations had been made, \nas is evident from its correspondence with Natixis and Mashreqbank. Of course, \nit does not follow that because Winson was alleging in May 2020 (with the \nbenefit of letters from the IJMs of Hin Leong) that Trafigura was fraudulent, \nthat Winson was also fraudulent in April 2020 when it made its second \npresentations \u2013 I accept that Winson did not then have all the facts revealed in \nthe IJMs\u2019 letters in May 2020. However, based on what Winson did know at the \ntime of its second presentations, what checks Winson did, and what checks \nWinson did not do, my conclusion remains that Winson was fraudulent, at least \nin the sense that it did not believe in the truth of the representations in its LOIs.\n177 Accordingly, I conclude that the banks have established the Fraud \nException in relation to Winson\u2019s second presentations (which are the operative \nones). It follows that Winson\u2019s claim for payment on the LCs fails.\nThe Nullity Exception\n178 As I find the Fraud Exception to have been established, it is unnecessary \nfor me to make a finding on whether the banks can rely on the Nullity Exception \nto resist payment, and I leave that point open.\n179 I simply observe that the banks\u2019 contentions in relation to the Nullity \nException appear to extend the exception beyond its scope as recognised in the \nCourt of"}

{"casename":"2023_SGHC_222","fact":"'7\\u2003I begin with the background facts, which explain the apparent absurdity of OS 704 and OS 666 being essentially identical applications. To begin with, the applicants in OS 704 and OS 666 are identical. They are Mr Lim Oon Kuin (\u201cLOK\u201d), Mr Lim Chee Meng (\u201cLCM\u201d), and Mdm Lim Huey Ching (\u201cLHC\u201d). The respondent in OS 704 and OS 666 is Rajah & Tann Singapore LLP. OS 704 stemmed from LCM\u2019s and LHC\u2019s discontentment with the respondent acting for Hin Leong Trading (Pte) Ltd (\u201cHLT\u201d) and its respective interim judicial managers at the material time. OS 666, similarly, stemmed from LCM\u2019s and LHC\u2019s discontentment with the respondent acting for Ocean Tankers Pte Ltd (\u201cOTPL\u201d) and its respective interim judicial managers at the material time. The applicants were concerned that allegedly confidential information or documents would be misused unless the respondent was restrained from so acting. The applicants filed OS 704 on 21 July 2020, and filed OS 666 on 9 July 2020.', '8\\u2003In their original forms, the only substantive claim which the applicants sought in OS 704 and OS 666 was to restrain the respondent from representing HLT, OTPL, and their respective interim judicial managers, ie, final injunctive relief. Although LCM and LHC were directors of HLT and OTPL, they did not have legal standing to authorise the commencement of OS 704 and OS 666 in the names of HLT and OTPL, respectively. This was because LCM and LHC had divested their powers to the interim judicial managers of HLT and OTPL. As such, OS 704 and OS 666 were struck out at first instance in Ocean Tankers (Pte) Ltd (under judicial management) v Rajah & Tann Singapore LLP and another matter [2021] SGHC 47 and on appeal in Hin Leong Trading (Pte) Ltd (in liquidation) v Rajah & Tann Singapore LLP and another appeal [2022] 2 SLR 253. Despite this, LCM and LHC were able to maintain OS 704 and OS 666 by applying to join themselves and LOK as parties to the two originating summonses in their personal capacities. The joinder applications were rejected at first instance in Ocean Tankers (Pte) Ltd (under judicial management) v Rajah & Tann Singapore LLP and another matter [2021] SGHC 144 but allowed on appeal in Lim Oon Kuin and others v Rajah & Tann Singapore LLP and another appeal [2022] 2 SLR 280 (\u201cLim Oon Kuin\u201d). This explains why OS 704 and OS 666, in their present form, are essentially identical applications.', '9\\u2003Subsequently, after being joined as parties, on 7 June 2022, the applicants obtained leave to amend OS 704 and OS 666 to replace HLT and OTPL with the applicants as the parties to the proceedings. After being joined as parties, the applicants maintained their single claim for a final injunctive relief against the respondent. The basis for this claim also remained as the purported possibility or risk of confidential information or documents being misused, and that the respondent\u2019s continued representation of HLT and OTPL, as well as their liquidators, would pose a threat to the proper administration of justice. Crucially, the applicants did not, at the time of their joinder, indicate that they sustained losses personally or that they would be seeking compensation for any alleged breach of confidence arising from the respondent\u2019s conduct.', '10\\u2003Then, on 11 August 2022, the applicants filed HC\/SUM 2981\/2022 (under OS 704) and HC\/SUM 2982\/2022 (under OS 666) to seek specific discovery of over 100 categories of documents to support their claim for final injunctive relief. In the affidavits filed in support of both applications, 2', 'the applicants again maintained their single claim for a final injunctive relief against the respondent. Indeed, the applicants likewise did not indicate that they sustained losses personally or that they would be seeking compensation for any alleged breach of confidence arising from the respondent\u2019s conduct.', '11\\u2003At around the time that the applications for specific discovery were filed, the parties attempted to resolve their dispute. When this did not succeed, the respondent, in view of the applicants\u2019 position that their sole concern was to obtain a final injunctive relief, took steps to disengage from acting for HLT and OTPL, as well as their respective liquidators. By this time, HLT and OPL were in liquidation, which was why the respondent had been acting for their liquidators instead of their judicial managers. In addition, on 12 September 2022, the respondent, through its solicitors, wrote to the applicants\u2019 solicitors (\u201c12 September Letter\u201d). In the 12 September Letter, the respondent informed the applicants of the respondent\u2019s cessation of its engagement with HLT and OPTL, as well as their liquidators. The respondent also offered to pay the costs of the proceedings to the applicants, with the amount to be agreed, if not, taxed, but on a without admission of liability basis.', '12\\u2003When the applicants did not give the respondent a substantive response, the respondent filed the Striking Out Applications on 22 September 2022 to strike out OS 704 and OS 666. The respondent did so on the basis that the continued maintenance of these proceedings no longer served any practical purposes in the light of the respondent\u2019s actions detailed in the previous paragraph. However, the applicants then filed the Amendment Applications on 25 October 2022.

The defendant\u2019s principal business activity is to manage the operations of its subsidiaries in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore. These subsidiaries are in the business of providing technology-driven automobile assistance. The defendant also owns and maintains certain intellectual property, that are in turn licensed to these subsidiaries.', '4\\u2003The defendant has two shareholders.

ONBH is the holding vehicle for the defendant\u2019s founders, who are Mr Praveen Surendiran (\u201cPraveen\u201d) and Mr Sreekumar Sundaramoorthy. The shareholders\u2019 agreement between the claimant and ONBH dated 9 April 2018 (the \u201cSHA\u201d) sets out their rights and obligations in relation to their shareholding in the defendant.', '5\\u2003The SHA and the defendant\u2019s constitution provide that ONBH is entitled to nominate and maintain two directors to the defendant\u2019s board of directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d). In turn, the claimant is entitled to nominate and maintain one director to the Board as long as it maintains at least 15% of its shareholding in the defendant. Pursuant to these arrangements, Praveen has been the managing director of the defendant since 16 May 2018. In that capacity, he is responsible for managing the business and day-to-day operations of the defendant and its subsidiaries (the \u201cGroup\u201d).', '6\\u2003Between 2019 and 2021, the claimant increased its investment in the defendant. It made a series of cash injections in the form of equity and loans. In particular, the claimant extended a loan of $4,800,000 to the defendant (the \u201cLoan Principal\u201d) pursuant to the terms of an optionally convertible loan agreement dated 27 July 2021 (the \u201cOCLA\u201d). Under the OCLA, the claimant may exercise an option to convert the Loan Principal into ordinary shares of the defendant. Clauses 2.2 and 2.5 of the OCLA provide that the Loan Principal plus interest (the \u201cDebt\u201d) shall be repaid in a single tranche on 30 January 2023. On 2 February 2023, after the Debt had been due, the claimant gave formal notice to the defendant, requesting the immediate repayment of the Debt. The defendant had not repaid the Debt as of the date I heard the parties. However, the claimant had not served a statutory demand on the defendant to recover the Debt.

{"casename":"2023_SGHC_23","fact":"'6\\u2003In 2009, the board of TGL decided to expand its water and environmental business. Membrane-related technology was new then, and the plan was to conduct R&D before developing a manufacturing base in China to produce membrane-related products. 12', '7\\u2003The membrane-related technology that Tritech was exploring concerned artificial membranes, which are used for water filtration, and water and wastewater treatment. Depending on the specific purpose of the membrane, different types of membranes with different properties may be required. Two categories are pertinent to this case: hollow fibre membranes and flat sheet membranes. Typically, hollow fibre membranes are used for the process of ultrafiltration. Flat sheet membranes, on the other hand, are used for nanofiltration, forward osmosis (\u201cFO\u201d) and reverse osmosis (\u201cRO\u201d). 13', 'Flat sheet membranes and hollow fibre membranes are fabricated using different production processes, with different equipment. 14', '8\\u2003Tritech\u2019s R&D initially focused on hollow fibre membranes. 15', 'Flat sheet membrane work started in 2010, when Dr Wang started a collaboration with Associate Professor Ng How Yong (\u201cProf Ng\u201d) at the National University of Singapore (\u201cNUS\u201d). The collaboration was to conduct R&D on flat sheet membranes to be used in an FO process. A laboratory setting was used to determine the method and process of fabricating flat sheet membranes with the desired qualities. 16', '9\\u2003At the time, Dr Duan was a post-doctoral research assistant in Prof Ng\u2019s team. His main scope of work was the R&D of novel membranes, including FO membranes. 17', 'As part of a plan to set up a commercial production line for FO membranes (the \u201cFO Project\u201d), Dr Wang invited Dr Duan to be the expert to lead the Tritech team. An agreement was reached with Dr Duan to allow him to complete his work with the NUS-Tritech collaboration before joining TWT as an employee. Dr Wang obtained Prof Ng\u2019s permission for Dr Duan to start work on the FO Project during the interim period when he was still at NUS. Tritech paid him an allowance each month during this interim period. 18', 'An exclusive licence agreement was also entered into with NUS in respect of the formula that was used within NUS, to be used in the planned commercial production line. 19', '10\\u2003In 2011, Tritech began to source for suppliers of the production line to be used in the FO Project. 20', 'Two Tritech employees, Mr Gong Zhao and Mr Xie, worked together with Dr Duan. Three companies were shortlisted: Shanghai Dahe New Material Technology Co Ltd (\u201cShanghai Dahe\u201d), Changzhou Dongfeng Textile Machinery Factory and Dalian Kena Science Technology Development Co Ltd. Dr Wang was keen for Dr Duan to be involved in the vendor selection process as he was the only one who had technical expertise in FO membranes and was aware of the existing issues faced by the test equipment at NUS. 21', 'Thus, Dr Duan participated in the second set of visits to the shortlisted companies which took place between 22 and 25 March 2011. 22', 'After these visits, Mr Gong put together a summary of the three companies\u2019 estimated fees and plans and sent them to Dr Wang, Dr Duan and Mr Xie, seeking their views. Dr Duan responded that \u201cthe one in Dalian [was] basically rejected\u201d and \u201c[t]he Wuxi one \u2026 did not show a sincere desire to cooperate\u201d and while \u201cthey probably have the best design and machining capabilities\u201d, they had not given Tritech a basic sketch so one could not tell what their real processing capabilities were. As for Shanghai Dahe, Dr Duan said that their offer price was too high, but \u201c[i]f they can quote a realistic price, [he thought] it would be ideal for them to do it\u201d because \u201cthey [had] some experience in design and machining and have made some similar equipment\u201d. 23', '11\\u2003Tritech eventually agreed that Shanghai Dahe would supply the production line for the FO Project. This was completed in a two-stage process. On 8 May 2011, TEG first signed a \u201cFilm Manufacturing Equipment Design Commissioning Agreement\u201d with Shanghai Dahe (the \u201cDesign Commissioning Agreement\u201d). 24', 'Discussions then followed between Tritech and Shanghai Dahe about the specifics of the design of the production line.

He notified Dr Wang by e-mail of the following: 26', '(a)\\u2003He had not been able to test the full production line. The workshop was too small and the production line could not be fully extended. Further, plumbing and wiring needed to be cut and installed according to the actual conditions of Tritech\u2019s plant. It was not possible to test individual components separately as the entire production line was programmed for automatic control. Thus, the trials could only be carried out in Tritech\u2019s factory.', '(b)\\u2003He had checked every part of the equipment from start to finish against the design drawings, and his conclusion was that the equipment was manufactured exactly according to the design drawings and was capable of meeting the technical requirements set out in the design. He qualified this by saying that the accuracy of the control could only be tested during commissioning.', '13\\u2003Following this confirmation, Mr Gong arranged for delivery of the FO Production Line, which took place on 15 September 2012. 27', 'The FO Production Line was assembled in one of TEG\u2019s factories in China (\u201cFactory Three\u201d). Dr Duan was appointed director of Factory Three once its construction was completed in the second half of 2012. 28', '14\\u2003Upon delivery, Mr Gong realised that the FO Production Line contained various external defects. 29', 'After the installation and during the commissioning of the FO Production Line, further defects surfaced.

Their function was to roll the flat sheet membranes produced by the FO Production Line. 33', 'Dr Duan was involved in reviewing the technical drawings for these machines. 34', 'He also conducted an inspection of the MR Machines and informed Dr Wang that the machines were manufactured in accordance with Tritech\u2019s design and were satisfactory. 35', '16\\u2003There were, however, defects present in the MR Machines. In an e-mail dated 24 April 2014, Dr Duan compiled a list of defects that were present in the MR Machines and sent it to Mr Gong. 36', 'On 28 September 2014, Mr Gong told Shanghai Dahe that the MR Machines were \u201cbasically non-functional\u201d. 37', 'Later, in an e-mail to Shanghai Dahe with Mr Gong copied, on 4 November 2014, Dr Duan said that Tritech had solved the issues with the MR Machines themselves. 38', 'Mr Gong\u2019s evidence is that he has no knowledge of how this was done, and that the MR Machines are still unused. 39', '17\\u2003Due to the failure to complete the FO Production Line, Dr Wang decided that a good back-up plan was to set-up an RO production line in Factory Three instead (RO membranes are the other type of flat sheet membranes, see [7] above). Dr Duan advised him that it was possible to adapt the FO Production Line into an RO production line. 40', 'Dr Duan was tasked to conceptualise an RO production line, conduct site visits of vendors, and select a vendor who would be able to put together an RO production line in accordance with Tritech\u2019s technical requirements. 41', '18\\u2003On 5 July 2014, Dr Wang asked Dr Duan to inspect two potential vendors to assess their suitability, one of which was Zhejiang Shengshi Machinery Co Ltd (\u201cZhejiang Shengshi\u201d). 42', 'Dr Duan visited the site and confirmed that Zhejiang Shengshi had the capacity to design, manufacture and install an RO production line to produce RO membranes on a commercial scale; had prior experience in supplying production lines for RO membranes; and would be able to supply an RO production line using technical solutions which were its own technology. 43', 'On 30 July 2014, Dr Duan informed Mr Gong that Zhejiang Shengshi had provided a quotation with technical documents for an RO production line, and he had reviewed them and made some changes. He said that he hoped the goods could be supplied as soon as possible. 44', 'On 22 August 2014, TEG entered into an agreement (\u201cRO Purchase Contract\u201d) with Zhejiang Shengshi for the supply and manufacture of an RO production line (the \u201cRO Production Line\u201d). 45', '19\\u2003Dr Duan inspected the RO Production Line prior to delivery alone at Zhejiang Shengshi\u2019s factory and informed Dr Wang and Mr Gong of his findings on 1 December 2014. 46', 'He stated that the water and drying tank were finished, but it was impossible to conduct a site inspection to determine if they had been manufactured with the correct stainless steel. However, \u201c[t]he appearance and the structure compl[ied] with the requirements described in the Contract\u201d and it had a \u201cbeautiful appearance\u201d.

There was some defect on the surface of the drying tank, and he had requested that it be rectified.', '20\\u2003TEG accepted delivery of the RO Production Line, and it was delivered in batches between December 2014 and January 2015. Installation and commissioning then commenced. Similar to the FO Production Line, the RO Production Line was dogged by defects. 47', 'No RO membrane has been produced. 48', '21\\u2003In the course of finding solutions to the problems with the RO Production Line, Dr Duan selected two companies to be technical consultants, and sought Dr Wang\u2019s approval of payment of RMB400,000 to them. 49', 'The money was disbursed to Dr Duan in two debit cards on 19 August 2016. Tritech did not receive any technical consultancy services and TEG reported Dr Duan to the Chinese police when this discrepancy was discovered in July 2019, after Dr Duan had left Tritech\u2019s employment. 50', 'Dr Duan was subsequently convicted of bribery in China and sentenced to seven months\u2019 imprisonment with a fine of RMB100,000. 51', 'The facts supporting his plea of guilt reflected that Dr Duan had paid the RMB400,000 to one Mr He. He agreed with Mr He that Tritech would engage Mr He to provide technical support to Tritech at RMB400,000, with Dr Duan receiving a kick-back of one-third of that sum (RMB149,800). 52', '22\\u2003In the meanwhile, the commissioning of the FO Production Line continued. At Mr Gong\u2019s request, Dr Duan set out the full list of defects in a copy of the FO Purchase Contract containing annotations identifying various technical requirements that the FO Production Line did not satisfy. This annotated copy of the contract was prepared on 7 November 2016 (the \u201c7 November 2016 List\u201d). 53', 'The contract with Shanghai Dahe was terminated four days later.', '23\\u2003On 12 March 2017, Dr Duan resigned as an employee of Tritech. He told Dr Wang that the work was taking a toll on him, and he wanted to rest for some time. 54', 'He was still at this juncture a trusted employee despite the failure of both the FO and RO Production Lines, and Dr Wang told him that he was always welcome to return. 55', '24\\u2003The FO Production Line and RO Production Line were in Tritech\u2019s Factory Three, which was focused on the production of flat sheet membranes. Tritech was producing hollow fibre membranes in \u201cFactory One\u201d. 56', 'I will refer to the hollow fibre membrane production line in Factory One as the \u201cUF Production Line\u201d. Tritech first launched hollow fibre membrane ultrafiltration products in April 2013 after approximately four years of R&D. 57', 'This area of work was under the purview of Dr Tan Chien Hsiang (\u201cDr Tan\u201d), who was appointed Principal Membrane Engineer by Tritech in February 2013 and seconded to Tritech\u2019s office in China to oversee the commissioning of the UF Production Line. 58', '25\\u2003Tritech produced two hollow fibre membrane products: a curtain-style membrane and a column-style membrane. The column-style membrane was first launched in December 2013, and the curtain-style membrane was first launched in April 2013. The main difference between the two types of membrane lies in the way the fibres are packed, either as a column or as a curtain. 59', 'One of Tritech\u2019s subsidiaries holds a patent in respect of these two products, which discloses a range of operating parameters that would allow replication of the production process to manufacture hollow fibre membranes. However, the precise combination of parameters and steps required to produce the hollow-fibre membranes with uniform, desired properties and consistently on a commercial scale are confidential within Tritech and are not disclosed in the patent. 60', '26\\u2003By 2017, Mr Luo held a number of key management and senior executive positions within Tritech. 61', 'In November 2017, Dr Tan was informed by the lead of his production team (\u201cMr Xiao\u201d) that Mr Luo had been at the UF Production Line a few times that month, observing the production process and taking detailed notes. Mr Luo had also asked members of the production team various technical questions. Because of Mr Luo\u2019s seniority within Tritech, the production employees initially answered his queries. Eventually, they grew suspicious and thus reported Mr Luo\u2019s behaviour to Dr Tan. 62', 'Dr Tan told Mr Xiao that the production team should not be disclosing any information relating to the production of UF products to anyone not involved in the production process, including Mr Luo. 63', 'In December 2017, Mr Xiao told Dr Tan that Mr Luo still came to the production line and asked the production team questions. Around the same time, a research engineer in one of the R&D teams that reported to Dr Tan (\u201cMs Zhang\u201d), told Dr Tan that Mr Luo had asked for a technical flowchart of Tritech\u2019s production process. 64', 'Dr Tan reported Mr Luo\u2019s behaviour to Dr Wang in January 2018.', '27\\u2003This prompted an investigation into Mr Luo, which extended to Dr Duan because there were rumours that Mr Luo was working with Dr Duan. 65', 'It was then discovered that Dr Duan had incorporated a company, Dreamem, on 1 March 2017, before he resigned from Tritech.

There are some aspects which, \nin the absence of evidence or trial, no findings can be made, and I thus will not \nmake those findings. First, the orders: \n(a) By consent, the plaintiffs be given leave to discontinue this suit \nin accordance with the terms of settlement reached between them and \nthe 1st and 3rd defendants. \n(b) Summons 2331 is dismissed with costs to be paid by Arbiters \nLaw Inc Corporation to the plaintiffs and the 1st and 3rd defendants. \n(c) Summons 2424 is dismissed with costs to paid by Arbiters Law \nInc Corporation to the plaintiffs and the 1st and 3rd defendants. \n(d) I will determine the costs at a later date if parties are unable to \nagree.\n10 To understand why I dismissed Mr Rai\u2019s summonses, it is necessary to \nreturn to the beginning. When parents, like the plaintiffs, seek legal advice over \nthe death of their son, they would, of course, have been advised on the facts and \nthe law to help them decide whether to pursue litigation. I do not know how \nmuch work had been done by the solicitors, but some issues arose which \ncompels me to estimate the work involved. Mr Rai is claiming an equitable lien \non the settlement money because of his unpaid fees. I must therefore be satisfied \nthat equity leans in his favour. Otherwise, Mr Rai has to claim his fees in the \nusual way, by a letter of demand, and if that is challenged, he and the clients \nhave to sort that out in court because the facts and evidence must be ventilated \nat trial.\nVersion No 2: 28 Aug 2023 (10:38 hrs)\nArokiasamy Steven Joseph v Lee Boon Chuan Nelson[2023] SGHC 230\n611 For the moment, I need only consider what factors, if any, weigh against \nMr Rai\u2019s applications. First, the Father sued in his personal capacity and as the \nadministrator of SFS, and the Mother sued in her own right. The pleadings are \nmeandering but they do not tell me what was the cause of action that the Father \nand Mother rely on. The statement of claim repeatedly claims that the \ndefendants were in breach as against SFS and the plaintiffs. It appears that the \ncomplaint is that SFS was diagnosed as suffering from depression and not \nschizophrenia. Furthermore, SFS was prescribed the wrong medication, and was \nnot properly attended to. All these would be fair issues at trial.\n12 The problem is that these are claims that would have to be made on \nSFS\u2019s behalf. That may be done by the Father suing as the administrator of \nSFS\u2019s estate. It does not explain why the Father (personally) and the Mother \nwere suing as plaintiffs. In their respective affidavits, they claim that their son\u2019s \ndeath drove them to depression and they could not therefore work. That \nconsequently led to them to being dismissed from their jobs. However, the \npleadings do not set out what their cause of action is. They failed to specify the \nduty owed to them (if any), or how that duty was breached. The indirect allusion \nthat they lost their jobs because they could not work on account of their grieving \nover SFS\u2019s death is not a cause of action. It is just casting blame in a non-legal \nsense. \n13 The Father, suing as the administrator of SFS, appears to be claiming \nloss of income on behalf of SFS. He had been working in various food and \nbeverage outlets intermittently, such as Aerin\u2019s, O Coffee Club, Cuba Libre, \nBJ Food Pte Ltd, Eighteen Chefs, and Cold storage. All in all, his monthly salary \nranged from $75.00 to $1,388.00.\nVersion No 2: 28 Aug 2023 (10:38 hrs)\nArokiasamy Steven Joseph v Lee Boon Chuan Nelson[2023] SGHC 230\n714 At a previous pretrial conference, it dawned on Mr Rai that his case for \nSFS hinges on proof that Concerta, one of the drugs prescribed to SFS was \ninappropriate, and he needed an expert opinion to prove it. Trial dates had by \nthat time been given, so Mr Rai sought leave to engage Professor Eleni from \nLondon as that expert. In the event, Mr Rai informed me on 14 August that he \nwas unable to communicate with Prof Eleni because she had cancer and was \nundergoing \u2018intensive chemotherapy\u2019.\n15 These are complicated legal matters for the lawyers to advise their \nclients. They must be satisfied that they have the evidence to lay a claim. They \nmust also advise that in medical cases, opinions may differ and that they have \nat least arguably strong expert evidence to back"}
{"casename":"2023_SGHC_231","fact":"'3\\u2003I begin with the background facts leading to the applicant\u2019s application. The applicant is a private company incorporated in Singapore on 25 April 1992. The applicant has a track record of general building for more than 25 years in Singapore. The applicant is also a wholly owned subsidiary of Boldtek Holdings Limited (\u201cBHL\u201d). BHL has been listed on the Catalist of the Singapore Exchange since 12 January 2013. For convenience, I will refer to BHL and its subsidiaries, which include the applicant, as the \u201cGroup\u201d.', '4\\u2003The applicant pointed to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the ensuing governmental restrictions in Singapore and Malaysia, as factors that severely affected the Group\u2019s business. Despite these difficulties, the Group\u2019s recovery was on an upward trajectory. Indeed, the Group\u2019s order book from general building and precast manufacturing stood at about $79.4m as of 25 October 2022. In addition, the Group was awarded construction contracts worth approximately $119.1m for the period between June 2022 and January 2023.', '5\\u2003Despite these positive developments, the Group\u2019s recovery efforts came to a stop when BHL called for a trading halt in January 2023, which was later converted into a voluntary suspension in the same month. This was necessitated by its independent auditor\u2019s inclusion of a qualified opinion in its report on the Group\u2019s audited financial statements for the financial year ended 30 June 2022. While the voluntary suspension of BHL\u2019s trading persisted, several of the applicant\u2019s contractors became much more stringent with their payment terms. Some even threatened legal proceedings to demand for payment. The Group also faced difficulties in raising finance.', '6\\u2003More specifically, the applicant presently faces several demands for payment. It is also involved in several legal proceedings, including originating claims brought in the General Division of the High Court and the District Court, as well as adjudication proceedings brought under the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act 2004 (2020 Rev Ed).'"}
{"casename":"2023_SGHC_232","fact":"'4\\u2003The respondent contended at trial that there was a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between her and key personnel in JSPL that served as a defence to all the charges. As a result of the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d, Rainbow was essentially guaranteed JSPL\u2019s custom. Hence, the respondent argued that it was unnecessary for her to have given gratification to anyone to advance the business interests of Rainbow.', '5\\u2003The Judge below acquitted the respondent on all the charges on the basis of the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d defence. He found that the respondent had discharged her evidential burden in respect of the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d defence and thus the evidential burden had shifted to the Prosecution to rebut it: Public Prosecutor v Kong Swee Eng [2020] SGDC 140 (\u201cKong Swee Eng (DC)\u201d) at [31]. The Judge found that the Prosecution had failed to rebut the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d defence, and thus there was reasonable doubt on the mens rea for all the charges: Kong Swee Eng (DC) at [83] and [85].', '6\\u2003On appeal, I found that the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d was inherently incredible. Several factors supported this conclusion: (a) it had only been raised at trial; (b) the respondent was not consistent on its existence; (c) it was completely unclear as to how the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d worked in practice; and (d) the existence of the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d was not supported by the documentary evidence relied upon and was plainly contradicted by some of the evidence adduced at trial. Hence, applying Muhammad Nabill bin Mohd Fuad v Public Prosecutor [2020] 1 SLR 984 (at [71]), I held that the respondent did not discharge her evidential burden and properly put into issue the existence of the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d: Kong Swee Eng (Conviction) at [54], [56] and [78].', '7\\u2003As the respondent did not discharge her evidential burden on the existence of the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d, I further held that it was not the Prosecution\u2019s burden to call Mr Wong Weng Sun (\u201cMr Wong\u201d), JSPL\u2019s Managing Director at the material time, to rebut the existence of the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d: Kong Swee Eng (Conviction) at [78]. Despite Mr Wong and his investigative statements being offered to the respondent by the Prosecution, and the relevance of his evidence to the existence of the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d being apparent, the respondent declined to call him. I subsequently described this as a considered decision on her part: see [9] below.', '8\\u2003As a result of the respondent\u2019s failure to discharge her evidential burden on the existence of the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d, it was not relevant in assessing mens rea and was not taken into account. I allowed the Prosecution\u2019s appeal in part in respect of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 8th and 11th charges and convicted the respondent accordingly.', '9\\u2003Subsequently, post-conviction, the respondent filed an application in Criminal Motion No 105 of 2021 (\u201cthe 394H application\u201d) under s 394H of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (the \u201cCPC\u201d) for leave to make an application to review the conviction. Central to the 394H application were two statements allegedly recorded from Mr Wong in October 2021 and November 2021 (individually as described and collectively as \u201cthe 2021 Statements\u201d). It was apparent that the 394H application was a response to my conclusion that the respondent had failed to discharge her evidential burden on the existence of the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d. The October 2021 statement sought to establish and explain the existence of the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d. The November 2021 statement described JSPL\u2019s procurement decision to award a bid to DMH and detailed instances where Mr Wong had asked the respondent to help train personnel in JSPL\u2019s procurement department. I summarily dismissed the 394H application in Kong Swee Eng v Public Prosecutor [2022] 5 SLR 310 (\u201cKong Swee Eng (CM 105)\u201d). I held that although the evidence in the 2021 Statements was available to the respondent at the material time and its importance clear to her, she made a considered decision not to adduce it at trial: Kong Swee Eng (CM 105) at [18], [19] and [31].', '10\\u2003Following the dismissal of the 394H application, the respondent filed an application, Criminal Motion No 28 of 2021 (\u201cCM 28\u201d) under s 397(1) of the CPC, seeking leave to refer questions of law of public interest to the Court of Appeal. The question in relation to which leave was sought (\u201cthe Question\u201d) was as follows (Kong Swee Eng v Public Prosecutor [2022] 2 SLR 1374 (\u201cKong Swee Eng (CM 28)\u201d) at [13]):', '11\\u2003The Court of Appeal observed that the answer to the Question depended on whether the defence raised by the respondent was credible and capable of raising reasonable doubt as to the Prosecution\u2019s case: Kong Swee Eng (CM 28) at [22]. In line with the decision in Kong Swee Eng (Conviction), the Court of Appeal held that the respondent\u2019s defence was not such a defence.', '12\\u2003The Court of Appeal noted that the respondent\u2019s true complaint in CM 28 was that the conclusion that the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d was inherently incredible was incorrect, or at least should have been arrived at only after hearing Mr Wong\u2019s evidence: Kong Swee Eng (CM 28) at [24]. However, to call into question this conclusion would have required an appeal against my decision allowing the Prosecution\u2019s appeal. As no appeal lay to the Court of Appeal from a decision of the General Division of the High Court exercising appellate criminal jurisdiction in an appeal from the State Courts, CM 28 was a backdoor appeal and an abuse of process: Kong Swee Eng (CM 28) at [28]\u2013[30]. Accordingly, CM 28 was dismissed by the Court of Appeal.'"}

He first met Lim in 2016, at Lim\u2019s shop at Katong Shopping Centre, where Lim sold Buddhist statues and religious items (the \u201cShop\u201d). Lim is also the founder and owner of a temple (the \u201cTemple\u201d), which was at that time located at his residence. On Lim\u2019s invitation, Khoo started visiting the Temple for worship and volunteering there regularly. 1', '3\\u2003Khoo claims that in January or February 2017, Lim approached him to jointly purchase a commercial property to be used as premises for the Temple and told Khoo that it would a be a \u201c50\/50 investment\u201d. Lim told him that in helping to set up a temple, he would be rewarded by the deities and receive a lot of merits. Khoo said he would consider the proposal, and subsequently agreed to jointly purchase the Property \u201cbased on [his] understanding\u201d that he and Lim would contribute to the Property equally and own it in equal shares. 2', '4\\u2003Lim, however, claims in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief (\u201cAEIC\u201d) that it was at a meeting of the committee members of the Temple in June 2017 that he made known his intention to purchase a property to use as premises for the Temple and the Shop. Ms Angeline Teo (\u201cAngeline\u201d), a volunteer at the Temple and a real estate agent, assisted him to look for suitable premises. In August 2017, Angeline accompanied Khoo to view the show flat for T-Space whereupon he expressed his interest in purchasing a unit there. 3', 'Angeline informed him that, based on his financial position, he would not be able on his own to obtain a bank loan sufficient to cover the purchase price, and suggested that he purchase the Property jointly with Khoo to obtain the loan. Lim claims that after Angeline spoke to Khoo, Khoo agreed to do so purely to help Lim obtain the bank loan but Khoo would not be responsible to contribute to the purchase of the Property. Hence, Lim and Khoo agreed to hold the Property as tenants-in-common in the share of 99 to 1 respectively. 4', '5\\u2003On 9 August 2017, Khoo went for the first time to view T-Space with Lim, and they decided to purchase the Property. The Option to Purchase (\u201cOTP\u201d) was issued on that day by the developer (\u201cGoldprime\u201d). The purchase price of the Property of $700,000 was subsequently financed by a loan of $560,000 (ie, 80% of the purchase price) from OCBC Bank secured by a mortgage over the Property (the \u201cLoan\u201d). Khoo and Lim signed the Loan agreement as the joint borrowers. 5', '6\\u2003Lim claims that he, Khoo, Angeline and Mr Henry Hoe (\u201cHenry\u201d) were present at Goldprime\u2019s site office when the OTP was issued. Henry is also a volunteer at the Temple and resides at Lim\u2019s residence; and he had driven Lim to T-Space that day. Lim also claims that it was discussed that he would make all payments towards the purchase price of the Property, and that Khoo was very vocal in emphasising that he would not be responsible for making any payments. 6', 'Khoo denies there was any discussion or agreement on 9 August 2017 that Lim would make all payments towards the Property and that Khoo would merely receive a 1% share in it. 7', 'It is undisputed that it was at the viewing of T-Space on 9 August 2017, that Lim first suggested to Khoo the idea of using the first floor of the Property for his Shop and the second floor for the Temple. 8', '7\\u2003The sale and purchase agreement (the \u201cSPA\u201d) was signed by the parties on 15 September 2017 at the office of Capital Law Corporation (\u201cCLC\u201d), which acted for them in the purchase of the Property (\u201c15\/9\/17 Meeting\u201d). The parties also signed a Confirmation of Manner of Holding document (\u201cManner of Holding Document\u201d), which stated that they held the Property as joint tenants. 9', 'The Temporary Occupation Permit (\u201cTOP\u201d) for the Property was issued on 26 June 2018, and the Property has been used by Lim as premises for the Temple and Shop since around July 2018. 10', '8\\u2003On or around 14 October 2018, the parties had a disagreement on matters relating to the Temple. Khoo decided to stop volunteering and being involved at the Temple, and he also no longer wished to be an owner of the Property. 11', 'Although Certificate of Statutory Completion for the Property was issued on 19 October 2018, the parties decided to wait for three years from its purchase before removing Khoo\u2019s name as an owner, to avoid incurring the seller\u2019s stamp duty. Subsequently, in December 2020, Lim arranged with his cousin, Ms Sally Ng (\u201cSally\u201d), to replace Khoo as the joint owner of the Property as he could not obtain refinancing in his sole name. 12', '9\\u2003As Lim was taking some time to resolve the matter and Khoo wanted his name to be removed from the Property, Khoo chased Lim on this issue and subsequently instructed his lawyers from Nakoorsha Law Corporation (\u201cNLC\u201d) on 26 July 2021 to propose to Lim that the Property be sold in the open market and the net sale proceeds be divided equally between the parties. 13', '10\\u2003Various communications ensued between the parties, including the following. On 16 August 2021, NLC informed Lim to resolve the matter without further delay, failing which legal action might be taken. On 18 October 2021 (shortly after Khoo commenced this suit), Lim informed NLC that he had secured a loan from OCBC Bank and that he wanted to discuss with Khoo the steps to transfer Khoo\u2019s \u201cnominated shares\u201d from the Property. 14', 'On 19 October 2021, NLC responded to dispute that Khoo was merely a nominee owner of the Property or that his interest was equivalent to \u201cnominated shares\u201d. 15', 'On 25 October 2021, Lim informed NLC that there was a prior verbal agreement between the parties that Khoo would be given \u201cnominated shares\u201d to assist Lim in obtaining the bank loan, and that Lim and Khoo held the Property as tenants-in-common in proportion of 99 to 1 respectively.

The claimant is one of Dato Lim\u2019s eight children. The first to third defendants are the majority shareholders of SLH. The first defendant is Mr Lim Soon Huat (\u201cSoon Huat\u201d) and the second defendant is Mr Lim Soon Heng (\u201cSoon Heng\u201d).

To effect this, Dato Lim divided his eight children into two groups (\u201cGroup A\u201d and \u201cGroup B\u201d). Dato Lim then caused his various companies (and the properties they owned) to be divided between the fourth defendant, Sin Soon Lee Realty Company (Private) Limited (\u201cSSLRC\u201d), and SLH. The Group A beneficiaries, which include Soon Huat, became shareholders of SSLRC and the beneficial owners of the assets held by SSLRC and its subsidiaries. The Group B beneficiaries, which include Dato Lim, the claimant, and Soon Heng, became shareholders of SLH and the beneficial owners of the assets held by SLH and its subsidiaries. On 15 September 2016, Dato Lim supposedly gave his personal and beneficial stake in LKCI to Soon Huat. On 23 August 2017, Dato Lim also supposedly gave his personal and beneficial stake in SLH to Soon Huat. As a result, in addition to being a member of the Group A beneficiaries, Soon Huat also became a member of the Group B beneficiaries.', '5\\u2003The Original Deed has been amended twice. On 28 February 2015, the members of the Lim family entered into an Amending and Restating Deed of Family Arrangement to amend certain terms of the Original Deed (the \u201cAmended Deed\u201d). Subsequently, on 11 January 2019, the parties to the Original Deed and the Amended Deed entered into a third deed, to provide, among others, for the disposal and handling of certain shares in an asset in Australia.', '6\\u2003The obligations relevant to the present application are as follows. Under cl 9.1 of the Amended Deed, the Group A beneficiaries were obliged to procure SSLRC to make a gift or transfer two properties to SLH and\/or its nominees. These two properties are known as the \u201cGeylang Property\u201d and the \u201cTamarind Road Property\u201d. For convenience, I will refer to the two properties as the \u201cProperties\u201d.

In the days following 7 August 2020, the lawyers who attended the meeting exchanged email correspondence \u2013 that is, the Emails \u2013 about the issues discussed at the meeting.

Moreover, it is clear that, when read in \ncontext, the Prosecution\u2019s questions (as shown in the notes of evidence \nextracted by Mr Jumabhoy)117 were targeted at showing that Mr Tan was \nindifferent to the nature of the drugs he was collecting from Pal through \nMr Dineshkumar. To elaborate, these questions concerned whether Mr Tan took \nany steps to open the plastic bags so as to \u201cverify\u201d their contents. In my view, \nthis line of questioning was primarily aimed at demonstrating that Mr Tan is \nunable to rebut the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA. For \nthe avoidance of doubt, the element of knowledge is distinct from that of \nknowing possession. This coheres with established law that an accused person \nwho was merely indifferent to or ignorant of what he was carrying would not \nbe able to rebut the presumption in s 18(2): Gobi at [64]. \n57 In any event, the Prosecution is only precluded from invoking the \npresumption under s 18(1) of the MDA if its case proceeds solely on the basis \nthat the accused person had been wilfully blind: Adili at [100]. This is certainly \nnot the case here. Insofar as Mr Jumabhoy has chosen to focus on the issue of \nwilful blindness in the closing submissions, Mr Tan is in no way prejudiced. \nThe closing submissions deal fully with the evidence at the trial and the \nsubstance of Mr Tan\u2019s defence (as outlined above from [ 33] onwards). Further, \nMr Tan filed reply closing submissions and had the opportunity to respond to \nthe Prosecution\u2019s closing submissions which clearly also relied on the \npresumption under s 18(1) of the MDA. \n117 Tan CS at para 43.\nVersion No 1: 25 Aug 2023 (16:40 hrs)\nPP v Tan Yew Kuan[2023] SGHC 235\n35Whether Mr Tan has rebutted the presumption  \n58 Returning to the s 18(1)(a) presumption, as mentioned (at [ 54] above), \nMr Tan accepts that, when he alighted from the Car, he was in physical \npossession of the plastic bags, E1A and E1B, which contained the Drugs.118 The \nissue for my determination is whether Mr Tan has successfully rebutted the \npresumption under s 18(1)(a) of the MDA by proving, on a balance of \nprobabilities, that he was never aware that the Drugs were in his custody. \n59 In my judgment, Mr Tan has failed to establish that he was not aware \nthat the Drugs were in his custody. During cross-examination, Mr Tan admitted \nthat he knew that certain things were placed in the Recycle Bag by \nMr Dineshkumar while Mr Tan was in the Car.119 When he exited the Car, \nMr Tan felt that the bag was heavy.120 In his contemporaneous statements, \nMr Tan said that E1A and E1B contained \u201cheroin and \u2018ice\u2019\u201d [emphasis added] \nbelonging to Sal Poulez (ie, Pal) and that Mr Tan was supposed to drop them \noff at a specified location as instructed by Sal Poulez. I note that Mr Tan alleges \nthat he did not use the conjunctive \u201cand\u201d (but that he used the conjunctive \u201cor\u201d). \nAs explained later at [ 92]\u2013[ 96], I reject this allegation. \n60 For present purposes, what is important is that Mr Tan does not dispute \nthat he knew he was carrying drugs at the material time. In fact, this was \nMr Tan\u2019s consistent position during investigations and at trial. By the Nature of \nTransaction Defence, raised only at trial, Mr Tan claims that he was expecting \nsmall quantities of \u201cice\u201d and three \u201cpopeyes\u201d to be delivered to him (albeit for \n118 NE, 23 March 2023, p 88 ln 1 to ln 5.\n119 NE, 23 March 2023, p 76 ln 7 to ln 22; p 77 ln 13 to ln 20; and p 79 ln 28 to ln 31.  \n120 NE, 22 March 2023, p 66 ln 24 to p 67 ln 6; and NE, 24 March 2023, p 38 ln 28 to \nln 30 and p 39 ln 13 to ln 16.  \nVersion No 1: 25 Aug 2023 (16:40 hrs)\nPP v Tan Yew Kuan[2023] SGHC 235\n36his personal use). I shall deal with the Nature of Transaction Defence from [ 67] \nbelow. In any event, by the time Mr Tan exited the Car with the Recycle Bag, \nhowever, he knew it was heavy and must have contained things other than some \n\u201cice\u201d and three \u201cpopeyes\u201d. Therefore, I am not satisfied that Mr Tan has \nestablished that he was not aware that the Drugs were in his possession so as to \nrebut the s 18(1)(a) presumption. \nWhether Mr Tan or Mr Dineshkumar placed the Drugs into the Recycle Bag\n61 For completeness, in relation to this issue, I should mention that Mr Tan \ntakes objection to the fact that the contradictory positions taken by Mr Tan and \nMr Dineshkumar during investigations as to who placed the Drugs into the \nRecycle Bag were never clarified by the investigation officers.121 As such, a \nfactual ambiguity has arisen and, so says Mr Tan, the court must resolve the \nambiguity in his favour. \n62 In his long statement recorded on 18 August 2020, Mr Tan said that he \ndid not handle the Drugs at all; they were placed into the Recycle Bag by \nMr Dineshkumar. In contrast, in Mr Dineshkumar\u2019s long statement recorded on \n4 March 2020, he stated that he passed the two plastic bags, E1A and E1B, to \nMr Tan during the car ride. It was Mr Tan who then placed the plastic bags into \nthe Recycle Bag. Notwithstanding this, during cross-examination, \nMr Dineshkumar disavowed his earlier narrative and admitted that Mr Tan had \nno role in placing E1A and E1B into the Recycle Bag.122\n121 Tan CS at para 41.\n122 Tan CS at paras 38\u201339; NE, 27 March 2023, p 61 ln 4 to ln 7; and NE, 27 March 2023, \np 60 ln 12 to ln 18.\nVersion No 1: 25 Aug 2023 (16:40 hrs)\nPP v Tan Yew Kuan[2023] SGHC 235\n3763  According to Mr Tan, as Mr Dineshkumar would gain nothing by lying \nabout this, he must have been telling the truth while he was on the stand. In any \nevent, if there is any doubt as to who is telling the truth, the benefit must be \ngiven to Mr Tan. Moreover, this apparent contradiction in the statements was \nnever clarified by the CNB officers during investigations, despite it being a \nmaterial aspect in the Prosecution\u2019s case (the Prosecution had put to Mr Tan \nduring cross-examination that he was the one who placed E1A and E1B into the \nRecycle Bag).123 \n64 In finding that Mr Tan has failed to rebut the presumption under \ns 18(1)(a) of the MDA, I have proceeded on the basis that Mr Tan knew that \nMr Dineshkumar placed certain things into the Recycle Bag (see [ 59] above). \nEffectively, I have resolved any ambiguity or discrepancy in favour of Mr Tan. \nFor clarity, I state that I accept that Mr Dineshkumar placed the plastic bags, \nE1A and E1B, into the Recycle Bag.  \nKnowledge \n65 With that, I turn to the element of knowledge. As Mr Tan is presumed \nto have had the Drugs in his possession pursuant to s 18(1)(a) of the MDA, the \npresumption of knowledge (that Mr Tan knew the nature of the Drugs) under \ns 18(2) of the MDA applies. The main issue I have to consider is whether \nMr Tan has successfully rebutted this presumption. \nWhether the Prosecution ran a different case at trial \n66 Similar to the element of knowing possession above, Mr Tan takes issue \nwith the Prosecution for purportedly running a different case at trial. While the \n123 Tan CS at para 42; see NE, 23 March 2023, p 78 ln 21 to ln 23.\nVersion No 1: 25 Aug 2023 (16:40 hrs)\nPP v Tan Yew Kuan[2023] SGHC 235\n38Prosecution suggested in its opening that it was relying on the presumption \nunder section 18(2) of the MDA, the questions put by the Prosecution to Mr Tan \nduring cross-examination suggest that its case is based on actual knowledge or \nwilful blindness.124 As such, Mr Jumabhoy urges me to decide Mr Tan\u2019s state of \nmind on the basis of wilful blindness.125 For the same reasons which I stated (at \n[55]\u2013[ 57] above), there is no merit in this argument. Accordingly, I decline to \ndecide Mr Tan\u2019s state of mind on the basis of wilful blindness. Instead, I shall \ndirect my mind to the question of whether Mr Tan has successfully rebutted the \npresumption of knowledge. \nThe Nature of Transaction Defence\n67 As set out at [ 38] above, Mr Tan\u2019s main defence is that he was only \nexpecting to deliver money to Pal\u2019s \u201cconveyor\u201d and collect some \u201cice\u201d and three \n\u201cpopeyes\u201d for himself on the night of 25 February 2020 ie, the Nature of \nTransaction Defence. On the other hand, the Prosecution argues that the Nature \nof Transaction Defence is a fabricated afterthought that ought to be rejected. In \nmy judgment, Mr Tan\u2019s Nature of Transaction Defence should be rejected for \nthe following reasons.  \n(1) Mr Tan\u2019s purported reactions after the arrest   \n68 In support of the defence, Mr Tan highlights his reactions after the \nRecycle Bag was opened in his presence in the Unit to reveal the Four \nBundles.126\n124 Tan CS at para 50.    \n125 Tan CS at para 55.\n126 Tan CS at paras 83\u201384; and Reply Closing Submissions of Mr Tan Yew Kuan \n(\u201cTan RCS\u201d) at para 15.\nVersion No 1: 25 Aug 2023 (16:40 hrs)\nPP v Tan Yew Kuan[2023] SGHC 235\n3969 As set out above at [ 20(d)], in his first long statement, Mr Tan said that \nupon his arrest while on the way home, the Recycle Bag was opened, and he \nwas shown the contents of the Recycle Bag by the CNB officers. He cursed Pal \nfor doing \u201ca dirty deed\u201d to him.127 Thereafter, he was brought up to the Unit. \n70 However, in his evidence at trial, consistent with the evidence of the \nCNB officers, Mr Tan testified that the Recycle Bag was opened and its contents \nrevealed to him in the Unit. Mr Tan said that he felt \u201cplayed out\u201d.128 However, \nhe did not mention that he cursed aloud (see [ 40] above). I shall refer to the \nopening of the Recycle Bag in the Unit as \u201cthe first point in time\u201d. \n71 A little later, as set out in his first long statement (see [ 20(e)] above), \nMr Tan said that when his handphone rang while he was in the Unit, he felt very \nagitated and told the officers that he wanted to \u201cfuck\u201d Pal for delivering the \namount of drugs in question without informing Mr Tan beforehand. He would \ndo so before saying what the CNB had wanted him to say. In his evidence (as \nset out at [ 40] above), he said this happened while Insp Eugene was recording \nhis first contemporaneous statement. I shall refer to this as \u201cthe second point in \ntime\u201d.  \n72 For context, in the living room of the Unit, SI Alwin handed a tamper-\nproof bag containing the Recycle Bag to Staff Sergeant Phang Yee Leong James \n(\u201cSSgt James\u201d). At about 10.41pm, SSgt James cut open the tamper-proof bag \nand conducted a search of the Recycle Bag. This was when its contents were \nrevealed.129 Staff Sergeant Low Yi Xun (\u201cSSgt Low\u201d) was there to assist.

In cross-examining these officers, Mr Tan did \nnot ask about this purported reaction of his. For completeness, I should add that \nSI Alwin and SSgt Low were the arresting officers. They said that Mr Tan was \narrested standing and was not pushed to the ground, contrary to Mr Tan\u2019s \nassertion (that he was tackled onto the ground).130 According to SI Alwin, it was \na normal arrest. Neither was asked about a reaction by Mr Tan to the contents \nof the Recycle Bag at the point of arrest. \n73 Turning to the second point in time, Insp Eugene testified that from \n10.45pm onwards, he instructed SSgt James to pause the search of the Recycle \nBag, after which Insp Eugene commenced the recording of the \ncontemporaneous statements in the living room.131 When Mr Tan\u2019s handphone \nrang, and during his discussion with Mr Tan about answering the calls, Mr Tan \ndid not express his frustration regarding Pal\u2019s actions, contradicting Mr Tan\u2019s \nevidence.132 It was put to Insp Eugene that when Mr Tan was asked if he would \nlike to answer a call from Pal\u2019s number, Mr Tan said yes, but that \u201cfirst, [he \nwants] to fuck him for sending [him] so much drugs\u201d. Insp Eugene disagreed.133 \nWhen cross-examined, SSgt James, SI Alwin and SSgt Low were unable to shed \nlight on the conversation between Insp Eugene and Mr Tan. They were not \npaying attention to the statement recording process as they were occupied with \nother matters in the Unit.134\n130 AB 340 at para 11. \n131 AB 109 at para 12; AB 131 at para 11; NE, 7 March 2023, p 30 ln 10 to ln 26.\n132 NE, 7 March 2023, p 93 ln 19 to ln 20.\n133 NE, 7 March 2023, p 32 ln 15 to ln 19.\n134 NE, 7 March 2023, p 76 ln 31 to p 77 ln 2; NE, 21 March 2023, p 17 ln 30 to ln 32; \nNE, 7 March 2023, p 17 ln 21 to ln 27.\nVersion No 1: 25 Aug 2023 (16:40 hrs)\nPP v Tan Yew Kuan[2023] SGHC 235\n4174 To sum up, the three officers, ie, SSgt James, SI Alwin James and \nSSgt Low, were not asked about the purported reaction at the first point in time \n\u2013 when the contents of the Recycle Bag were revealed. They were only asked \nabout what happened at the second point in time. Furthermore, Mr Tan did not \nmention this aspect in his testimony. Nor did he raise this in his closing \nsubmissions. It would seem that Mr Tan no longer relies on this aspect raised in \nthe first long statement. For the avoidance of doubt, I find that there was no such \nreaction upon seeing the contents of the Recycle Bag. \n75 SSgt James, SI Alwin James and SSgt Low did not know what was said \nbetween Insp Eugene and Mr Tan when Insp Eugene was interviewing Mr Tan. \nAs these officers had other duties at the time, I do not treat their failure to notice \nany strong reaction by Mr Tan against Mr Tan\u2019s defence. To me, this would \nhave been a neutral point. However, Insp Eugene\u2019s evidence clearly contradicts \nthat of Mr Tan. I see no reason to doubt Insp Eugene\u2019s account. At the material \ntime, Insp Eugene\u2019s focus would have been on Mr Tan. It is unlikely that he \nwould have missed the strong reaction (if any). I pause to observe that the \nsentiment underlying the purported reaction ie, that Mr Tan had been deceived, \nwas not reflected in either the first or the second contemporaneous statement. \nIn these statements, Insp Eugene had duly recorded Mr Tan\u2019s other responses, \nwhich included those that implicated Pal in the transaction. If Mr Tan said to \nInsp Eugene that he had been deceived by Pal, I do not see any reason for \nInsp Eugene to deliberately leave out this important detail, contrary to what \nMr Tan seems to suggest.135 This is because even if Pal had deceived Mr Tan \nconcerning the quantity of drugs involved, it does not necessarily mean that \nMr Tan would be exculpated. In light of the discussion above, as well as what I \n135 NE, 7 March 2023, p 32 ln 20 to ln 23.\nVersion No 1: 25 Aug 2023 (16:40 hrs)\nPP v Tan Yew Kuan[2023] SGHC 235\n42shall discuss below, I do not accept Mr Tan\u2019s account of his purported reaction \nat the second point in time.  \n76 Presumably, Mr Tan claims to have reacted as such because he was to \ncollect only some \u201c\u00edce\u201d and three \u201cpopeyes\u201d that night ie, the Nature of \nTransaction Defence, and that, in any case, the agreement was that he would not \ntake more than one pound of heroin and 125g of \u201cice\u201d, ie, the Alleged \nAgreement. Taking his account of the purported reaction at the second point in \ntime at the highest, they do not go far to support the Nature of Transaction \nDefence. Essentially, Mr Tan\u2019s concern seemed to be that he was deceived into \ntaking delivery of a large quantity of drugs per se. His reaction was not in \nrelation to being deceived into taking delivery of any drugs at all, other than \nsome \u201cice\u201d for his own consumption. In fact, Mr Tan\u2019s account seriously \ndetracts from the Nature of Transaction Defence. The fact that I disbelieve his \naccount of the purported reaction at the second point in time also undermines, \nalbeit perhaps to a lesser extent, his claim in relation to the Alleged Agreement.  \n(2) Mr Tan\u2019s failure to mention the Nature of Transaction Defence in the \ninvestigation statements  \n77 Next, while the Nature of Transaction Defence forms the core of \nMr Tan\u2019s defence, it is conspicuously absent in all the investigation statements.\n(A) THE CONTEMPORANEOUS STATEMENTS\n78 As discussed above, the Nature of Transaction Defence is absent from \nthe first and second contemporaneous statements recorded by Insp Eugene after \nMr Tan\u2019s arrest. In particular, there is no mention at all about how Mr Tan was \ndeceived by Pal. As discussed above at [ 75], I accept that Insp Eugene had no \nreason not to record such an important detail in the contemporaneous \nVersion No 1: 25 Aug 2023 (16:40 hrs)\nPP v Tan Yew Kuan[2023] SGHC 235\n43statements, especially the second one, if Mr Tan had told him about his \npredicament. \n79 The third contemporaneous statement was recorded by SSgt Eric from \nabout 12.15am, about two hours after Mr Tan\u2019s arrest. When Mr Tan was asked \nspecifically whether he knew how much drugs he was supposed to collect ie, \nQuestion 26, Mr Tan answered, \u201cNo. I do not know\u201d.136 At trial, Mr Tan \nexplained that he did not raise the Nature of Transaction Defence in response to \nQuestion 26 because he wanted to implicate himself so that he could receive the \ndeath penalty.137 Mr Tan was feeling despondent at the time and wanted to \u201cget \nit done with\u201d.138 However, in my view, it is difficult to see how Mr Tan\u2019s answer \nof \u201cNo. I do not know\u201d bears out his alleged state of mind when the answer is \nessentially a denial. If Mr Tan had truly wanted to implicate himself to receive \nthe death penalty, he would have provided an inculpatory answer to Question 26 \nrather than claiming that he was ignorant of how much drugs he was supposed \nto collect that night. \n80 Further, at trial, Mr Tan also provided inconsistent accounts as to what \nhe told SSgt Eric in response to Question 26. During the cross-examination of \nSSgt Eric, Mr Tan\u2019s case was that the answer was a shortened form of what he \nwas telling SSgt Eric. In fact, Mr Tan had meant to say that he had no \nexpectation of collecting anything on that day.139 However, this account, as put \nto SSgt Eric, is at odds with Mr Tan\u2019s alleged state of mind, ie, that he wanted \n136 AB 152 (Q\/A 26).\n137 NE, 24 March 2023, p 17 ln 18 to ln 21.  \n138 NE, 24 March 2023, p 15 ln 22 to ln 26.  \n139 NE, 7 March 2023, p 53 ln 17 to ln 22.  \nVersion No 1: 25 Aug 2023 (16:40 hrs)\nPP v Tan Yew Kuan[2023] SGHC 235\n44to implicate himself, as well as the Nature of Transaction Defence, ie, that he \nwas expecting only some \u201cice\u201d and \u201cpopeyes\u201d.\n81 Immediately after his answer to Question 26, Mr Tan was asked if he \nhad anything else to tell or if he wanted to help CNB, ie, Question 27. Mr Tan \nanswered that he wished to cooperate but did not know who to incriminate. It is \nincongruous for Mr Tan to offer to cooperate with the CNB if he had wanted to \nimplicate himself and be sentenced to suffer death at that time. Mr Tan also did \nnot provide any satisfactory explanation for the inconsistency of the answer with \nhis alleged state of mind. When asked about the inconsistency, Mr Tan could \nonly say that he did not know why, and his mind was muddled at that point in \ntime.140\n82 In my view, the absence of the Nature of Transaction Defence in all three \ncontemporaneous statements, and its absence from the third contemporaneous \nstatement, despite Mr Tan expressing a wish to cooperate with the CNB and his \npreparedness to implicate someone else, suggest that the Nature of Transaction \nDefence is an afterthought. For completeness, I note that there is medical \nevidence regarding Mr Tan\u2019s state of mind at the relevant time, which I shall \ndeal with from [ 84] below. \n(B) THE CAUTIONED STATEMENT\n83 Similarly, Mr Tan also failed to raise the Nature of Transaction Defence \nin his cautioned statement that was recorded a day following his arrest. The \ncautioned statement is brief as Mr Tan merely stated, \u201cI did what I did. I am \nguilty\u201d. The key issue for me to decide is what exactly Mr Tan\u2019s state of mind \nwas at the material time. In this regard, Mr Jumabhoy argues that there is \u201ca real \n140 NE, 24 March 2023, p 17 ln 25 to ln 28.  \nVersion No 1: 25 Aug 2023 (16:40 hrs)\nPP v Tan Yew Kuan[2023] SGHC 235\n45risk of taking things too literally\u201d141 as Mr Tan was \u201creally resigned and \ndespondent\u201d and was trying to kill himself. As such, Mr Tan wanted to implicate \nhimself at that point in time.142 Unsurprisingly, the Prosecution\u2019s position is that \nMr Tan did not labour suicidal thoughts at the material time, and his expression \nof a desire to implicate himself is a mere afterthought.\n84 I reject Mr Tan\u2019s claim that he was suicidal mainly because it is \ndiscredited by the evidence of the psychiatrist from the Institute of Mental \nHealth (\u201cIMH\u201d), Dr Christopher Cheok (\u201cDr Cheok\u201d). Dr Cheok examined \nMr Tan on three occasions on 6, 9 and 11 March 2020 after Mr Tan\u2019s arrest on \n25 February 2020. In his psychiatric report dated 17 March 2020, Dr Cheok \nobserved that Mr Tan\u2019s \u201cmood was euthymic\u201d, and there were \u201cno psychotic \nsymptoms and no thought disorder\u201d. There were no \u201cfeelings of passivity\u201d, and \n\u201cthere were no thoughts of suicide or violence\u201d.143 Dr Cheok concluded that \nMr Tan suffered from \u201csevere substance use disorder\u201d. He also had \u201ca past \nhistory of depression (which was in remission)\u201d.144 In his testimony, Dr Cheok \nwas clear that Mr Tan was not suicidal prior to the offence.145 This opinion was \nbased on Mr Tan\u2019s narrative when interviewed by Dr Cheok and Dr Cheok\u2019s \nprofessional assessment. \n85 Mr Tan also says that on 9 March 2020, he had remarked to Dr Cheok \nthat (i) prior to the offence, he made no attempt at suicide but \u201cdid think of it\u201d \nand (ii) Mr Tan knew it would \u201cbe the gallows\u201d for him and wanted a \u201cquick \n141 Tan CS at para 78.\n142 Tan CS at para 76.\n143 Exhibit P33 at para 12.\n144 Exhibit P33 at para 15.\n145 NE, 22 February 2023, p 20 ln 8 to ln 29; p 21 ln 3 to ln 10; p 34 ln 16 to ln 20 and \np 35 ln 13.  \nVersion No 1: 25 Aug 2023 (16:40 hrs)\nPP v Tan Yew Kuan[2023] SGHC 235\n46way to go\u201d.

I agree with the \nProsecution that Mr Tan\u2019s purported claim on 9 March 2020 that he had suicidal \nideations must be viewed with circumspection considering Mr Tan\u2019s indication \nto Dr Cheok just three days before ie, 6 March 2020, that he was not suicidal \nprior to the offence.146 In any event, Dr Cheok\u2019s considered opinion, based on a \nholistic psychiatric assessment of Mr Tan, is that he was not suicidal prior to the \noffence. For completeness, as regards Mr Tan\u2019s remark that he wanted a \u201cquick \nway to go\u201d, Dr Cheok testified that it did not necessarily point to \u201ca certain \ndarkness in terms of [Mr Tan\u2019s] mindset\u201d at the material time because it could \nsimply be a \u201cvery logical, straightforward\u201d response.147\n86 During his examination-in-chief, Mr Tan stated that during Dr Cheok\u2019s \nmedical examination, Mr Tan asked Dr Cheok if the latter was familiar with the \nterms \u201csuicide by cops\u201d or \u201csuicide by police\u201d. He told Dr Cheok that he had \nwanted to commit \u201csuicide by cops\u201d,148 but Dr Cheok failed to record this \nmaterial fact in his notes and consider it in assessing Mr Tan\u2019s state of mind.149 \nIn my view, apart from Mr Tan\u2019s bare assertion, which was categorically denied \nby Dr Cheok, there is no credible reason why Dr Cheok would deliberately lie \nand omit this crucial piece of evidence if it existed. Nothing suggests that \nDr Cheok is not an independent and objective witness. \n87 By the above, I reject Mr Tan\u2019s claim regarding his suicidal ideations. \nFor completeness, I note that Mr Tan argues that, in any event, his cautioned \nstatement is no more than an expression of despondency in the situation he had \n146 Exhibit D-1 at p 4; and NE, 22 February 2023, p 34 ln 16 to ln 20 and p 35 ln 13.\n147 NE, 22 February 2023, p 21 ln 16 to ln 23.  \n148 NE, 22 March 2023, p 76 ln 15 to ln 21.\n149 NE, 22 February 2023, p 23 ln 23 to ln 24; Tan CS at para 77. \nVersion No 1: 25 Aug 2023 (16:40 hrs)\nPP v Tan Yew Kuan[2023] SGHC 235\n47found himself in rather than an admission of guilt. As he was not thinking \nrationally, no weight should be attached to the cautioned statement.150 I first \nobserve that Mr Tan has conceded during cross-examination that he had failed \nto furnish any credible reason for failing to raise his Nature of Transaction \nDefence in his cautioned statement.151 Even if I give Mr Tan the benefit of the \ndoubt, by giving no weight to the cautioned statement, the fact remains that \nMr Tan\u2019s Nature of Transaction Defence is absent in his contemporaneous \nstatements (see [ 78]\u2013[ 82] above) and long statements (see below). \n(C) THE LONG STATEMENTS\n88 Lastly, the Prosecution also contends that Mr Tan\u2019s Nature of \nTransaction Defence does not feature in any of his long statements. In contrast, \nMr Tan points to paragraph 19 of his second long statement, as recorded on \n3 March 2020 by ASP Fernandez, to argue that he had raised the Nature of \nTransaction Defence during investigations.152 The material sentence reads:153\nI wish to say that during the time \u2018Pal\u2019 had called me after lunch \non 25\/02\/2020, \u2018Pal\u2019 had told me that he had pack [sic] \ninstrument for me to smoke \u2018ice\u2019 together with some \u2018ice\u2019 for the \nnight\u2019s collection.\n89 In my view, the sentence does not assist Mr Tan very much. All it states \nis that the collection for the night would include some \u201cice\u201d and an instrument \nto smoke the \u201cice\u201d. It does not state that the package would only contain three \n\u201cpopeyes\u201d and a small amount of \u201cice\u201d (ie, the Nature of Transaction Defence). \n150 Tan CS at para 78. \n151 NE, 24 March 2023, p 47 ln 23 to ln 26.\n152 NE, 23 March 2023, p 54 ln 10 to ln 21.\n153 AB 343 at para 19.\nVersion No 1: 25 Aug 2023 (16:40 hrs)\nPP v Tan Yew Kuan[2023] SGHC 235\n48Indeed, the sentence must be read in context. Right before that sentence, Mr Tan \nsaid the following in paragraph 19: \nI told the officers that the contents in the black recyclable \nshopping bag were \u2018heroin\u2019 and \u2018ice\u2019. I had assumed that it was \n\u2018heroin\u2019 and \u2018ice\u2019. I had this assumption because I had done \ncollections for the past 06 to 07 times and it was either \u2018heroin\u2019 \nand \u2018ice\u2019 or a mixture of both. \u2026 \n90 Therefore, I fail to see how the sentence in paragraph 19 is supposed to \nassist Mr Tan because that very paragraph reveals Mr Tan\u2019s expectation of what \nhe would be carrying as it says Mr Tan had assumed that there would heroin \nand \u201cice\u201d. At best, Mr Tan could be said to be merely indifferent to the presence \nof heroin, in addition to \u201cice\u201d. However, an accused person who was merely \nindifferent to what he was carrying would not be able to rebut the presumption \nof knowledge in s 18(2): Gobi at [64]. \n91 By the above, I reject Mr Tan\u2019s explanations for his failure to state the \nNature of Transaction Defence in the investigation statements. This hampers his \nattempt to rebut the presumption in s 18(2) of the MDA.\n(3) The contemporaneous statements contradict the Nature of Transaction \nDefence \n92 Apart from the fact that the Nature of Transaction Defence is absent in \nthe investigation statements, in my view, it is also contradicted by the contents \nof Mr Tan\u2019s contemporaneous statements. The plain words of the first \ncontemporaneous statements are that the Four Bundles ie, E1A1, E1A2, E1B1 \nand E1B2 contained heroin and \u201cice\u201d. \n93 At trial, when confronted with the first contemporaneous statement \nrecorded by Insp Eugene, Mr Tan initially accepted that he had probably told \nVersion No 1: 25 Aug 2023 (16:40 hrs)\nPP v Tan Yew Kuan[2023] SGHC 235\n49Insp Eugene that E1A and E1B contained heroin and \u201cice\u201d154 but later asserted \nthat what he said was \u201cheroin or ice\u201d as he had no idea what the contents of the \nbundles were and was just speculating.155 According to Mr Tan, he could have \noverlooked the mistake and just signed.156 However, this was flatly denied by \nInsp Eugene who firmly testified that Mr Tan had said that the bundles \ncontained \u201cheroin and ice\u201d.157\n94 In my view, Mr Tan\u2019s position is unbelievable. In the first place, this \nclaim that he said \u201cheroin or ice\u201d was not raised in Mr Tan\u2019s examination-in-\nchief. Mr Tan appended his signature at the bottom of the two pages of the first \ncontemporaneous statement. It is also incredible that Mr Tan would have \n\u201coverlooked\u201d the mistake on two occasions because, in the third \ncontemporaneous statement, recorded by another officer, ie, SSgt Eric, it was \nalso stated that the four bundles contained \u201cheroin and ice\u201d [emphasis added].158 \nThere is no reason why two different officers would have recorded the same \nconjunctive \u201cand\u201d if Mr Tan had indeed verbalised the word \u201cor\u201d to them. I shall \ndeal with the allegations against SSgt Eric shortly. More detrimental to \nMr Tan\u2019s position is the fact that in the third contemporaneous statement, Mr \nTan was recorded as saying that he \u201c[did] not know which is Heroin, which is \nIce\u201d immediately after identifying the Four Bundles as \u201cHeroin and Ice\u201d.159 This \nclearly indicates that Mr Tan knew that he was carrying both heroin and \u201cice\u201d. \n154 NE, 24 March 2023, p 4 ln 6 to ln 10.  \n155 NE, 24 March 2023, p 5 ln 1 to ln 5.  \n156 NE, 24 March 2023, p 4 ln 20 to ln 24.  \n157 NE, 7 March 2023, p 33 ln 9 to ln 10.  \n158 AB 148 (Q\/A3).\n159 AB 148 (Q\/A3).\nVersion No 1: 25 Aug 2023 (16:40 hrs)\nPP v Tan Yew Kuan[2023] SGHC 235\n5095 At trial, Mr Tan sought to cast doubt on the veracity of the third \ncontemporaneous statement by claiming that he did not bother to read it and had \nsimply signed where SSgt Eric had told him to sign because he was very \nresigned and despondent and had wanted to \u201cjust get it done with\u201d. Mr Tan had \nan altercation with SSgt Eric and was not \u201cin a very good frame of mind at that \ntime\u201d. According to Mr Tan, he had an altercation with SSgt Eric because the \nlatter was insisting that Mr Tan was guilty and hurrying the recording process.160\n96 I am unable to accept the allegations made by Mr Tan. For a start, I note \nthat SSgt Eric denied that he failed to record what Mr Tan said, ie, \u201cheroin or \nice\u201d, but recorded \u201cheroin and ice\u201d instead.161 SSgt Eric also denied that he \nrefused to reflect what Mr Tan was telling him. SSgt Eric explained that the \nrecording process took quite long because he had to clarify Mr Tan\u2019s answers.162 \nMore importantly, as explained above at [ 94], taken in context, it was clear that \nMr Tan meant \u201cheroin and ice\u201d. As for the allegation of the altercation, \npertinently, Mr Tan made no complaints against SSgt Eric despite the improper \nconduct alleged against SSgt Eric. While Mr Tan allegedly complained about \nSSgt Eric\u2019s unreasonable behaviour to ASP Fernandez,163 this is contradicted by \nASP Fernandez\u2019s unchallenged account that Mr Tan did not make any \ncomplaints regarding the statement recorded by SSgt Eric.164\n97 Even if I were to assume in Mr Tan\u2019s favour that the first and third \ncontemporaneous statements should read \u201cheroin or ice\u201d, there is no reason for \n160 NE, 24 March 2023, p 14 ln 30 to p 15 ln 9 and p 15 ln 20 to ln 31.  \n161 NE, 7 March 2023, p 65 ln 25 to p 66 ln 1.\n162 NE, 7 March 2023, p 52 ln 17 to ln 26.\n163 NE, 24 March 2023, p 20 ln 25 to ln 28 and p 21 ln 1 to ln 2.\n164 NE, 21 March 2023, p 49 ln 29 to ln 31.  \nVersion No 1: 25 Aug 2023 (16:40 hrs)\nPP v Tan Yew Kuan[2023] SGHC 235\n51Mr Tan to have identified the Four Bundles (which were wrapped in black tape) \nas \u201cheroin or ice\u201d if he had only been expecting some \u201cice\u201d and \u201cpopeyes\u201d as \nper the Nature of Transaction Defence. Even taking Mr Tan\u2019s case at the highest \nand proceeding on the basis that he was expecting some \u201cice\u201d and \u201cpopeyes\u201d, it \nis hard to believe that he had no inkling what could be within the Four Bundles. \nFurther, assuming there was the Alleged Agreement between Mr Tan and Pal, \nit would have been perfectly in accord with the agreement for Mr Tan to handle \none pound of heroin and 125g of \u201cice\u201d. Thus, by the foregoing, I accept the \ncontents of the first and third contemporaneous statements that Mr Tan said that \nthe Four Bundles contained heroin and \u201cice\u201d, and that this contradicts the Nature \nof Transaction Defence. \n(4) Whether the Nature of Transaction Defence is believable \n98 In and of itself, I am of the view that the Nature of Transaction Defence \nis unbelievable, and I do not accept Mr Tan\u2019s belated bare assertions of the \nsame. I explain. Before 25 February 2020, there were prior transactions with Pal \nwhich first involved heroin or ice, and then heroin and ice. This was stated in \nparagraph 19 of the second long statement (see [ 89] above). Sometimes, some \n\u201cice\u201d for Mr Tan\u2019s personal consumption would also be delivered. I accept these \naspects concerning the prior transactions as recorded in the long statements, \nwhich were not disputed by Mr Tan.\n99 Given the history of the dealings, it is conceivable that Pal would have \nagreed to deliver the items for Mr Tan\u2019s use (along with other drugs for \ntrafficking and to collect cash from Mr Tan); this would have followed the \npattern of earlier transactions. However, it is unbelievable that Pal would go out \nof his way to help Mr Tan by making such a special arrangement (by delivering \nsmall quantities of \u201cice\u201d and three \u201cpopeyes\u201d for Mr Tan\u2019s personal \nVersion No 1: 25 Aug 2023 (16:40 hrs)\nPP v Tan Yew Kuan[2023] SGHC 235\n52consumption and use), even if Pal also wanted to collect the money from \nMr Tan. I note that on that night alone, the transaction required nine calls \nbetween the parties. In the day, there were also calls between them. \nFurthermore, Pal would be putting his \u201cconveyor\u201d at some risk \u2013 purportedly \nfor a small amount of \u201cice\u201d and three \u201cpopeyes\u201d. \n100 There is, moreover, no reason whatsoever for Mr Tan to believe that Pal \nwould only deliver the items meant for his personal use. According to Mr Tan, \nPal was essentially a drug dealer who he had never met in person.165 Moreover, \nPal was associated with Segar, another drug dealer who had previously betrayed \nMr Tan by causing Mr Tan to collect a large amount of heroin. There was no \nspecial relationship between them for Pal to agree to help Mr Tan, and certainly, \nthere was no basis for Mr Tan to believe the delivery would only be of the items \nhe required. Instead, the contents of paragraph 19 of the second long statement \n\u2013 that Mr Tan was expecting a delivery of drugs, along with items for his own \nuse \u2013 rang more of the truth.  \n101 For all the foregoing reasons, as well as my views on the Alleged \nAgreement below, I reject the Nature of Transaction Defence.  \nThe Alleged Agreement\n102 As part of his defence, Mr Tan also raises the Alleged Agreement. As \nexplained in [ 42] above, this serves as the backdrop not only in relation to the \nquestion of Mr Tan\u2019s knowledge of the Drugs but also the issue of whether \nMr Tan had the intention to traffic the Drugs. In this regard, as the Prosecution \nacknowledges, if this agreement exists, one may argue that Mr Tan would not \n165 AB 349 at para 36.\nVersion No 1: 25 Aug 2023 (16:40 hrs)\nPP v Tan Yew Kuan[2023] SGHC 235\n53have known that the Three Bundles all contained heroin since he did not expect \nto receive more than one pound of heroin.166\n103 According to the Prosecution, there is no Alleged Agreement. Like the \nNature of Transaction Defence, the Alleged Agreement is nowhere to be found \nin any of Mr Tan\u2019s investigation statements. The Prosecution contends that \nduring the cross-examination of ASP Fernandez, Mr Tan failed to put to him \nthat during the recording of the second long statement on 3 March 2020, he told \nASP Fernandez about the Alleged Agreement.167\n104 Mr Tan contends that ASP Fernandez himself admitted that Mr Tan had \nraised the Alleged Agreement during the statement recording process. \nASP Fernandez understood what was to be conveyed in the wording of \nparagraph 24 of the second long statement, which accorded with what Mr Tan \nintended to convey.168 Paragraph 24 reads: \nI am now read back my contemporaneous statement in English \nlanguage. I am now asked about Question 10, in which I was \nasked what I get in return to help \u2018Sal Poulez\u2019. I had answered \nthat \u2018Sal Poulez\u2019 pay me SGD$500 for 02 batu \u2018heroin\u2019, \nSGD$300 for 01 batu \u2018heroin\u2019 and 125g of \u2018ice\u2019 for SGD$200. \nHowever, I wish to say now that the price was what \u2018Sal Poulez\u2019 \nand I had agreed on since I started helping him. However, I wish \nto say that I have never taken 02 batu of \u2018heroin\u2019 from him before. \n\u2018Pal\u2019 is also referring to \u2018Sal Poulez\u2019. \n[emphasis added] \n105 I set out what was put to ASP Fernandez during cross-examination:169\n166 PCS at para 61.\n167 PCS at paras 62\u201363.\n168 Tan CS at paras 80\u201381.\n169 NE, 21 March 2023, p 85 ln 27 to ln 28.  \nVersion No 1: 25 Aug 2023 (16:40 hrs)\nPP v Tan Yew Kuan[2023] SGHC 235\n54Q: And his position to you is that he never agreed to take \ntwo bags of heroin. \nA: Yes, Your Honour. But if I may add to the answer?  \nQ: I\u2019m quite content with that answer, officer.\nA: Okay.\nIn my view, unfortunately, the question to ASP Fernandez was not altogether \nclear, and Mr Jumabhoy did not allow ASP Fernandez to clarify his answer. For \ncompleteness, ASP Fernandez\u2019s answer during re-examination is that he \n\u201cagreed that throughout the statements, Mr Tan had never said that he was to \ncollect two bags of heroin\u201d.170 Specifically, ASP Fernandez was not cross-\nexamined about a prior existing agreement with Pal not to take more than a \ncertain quantity of drugs (ie, the Alleged Agreement). Instead, the rather \nequivocal question asked was whether Mr Tan said he had \u201cnever agreed to take \ntwo bags of heroin\u201d. This question envisages the scenario where there was no \nprior agreement. Yet, Mr Tan\u2019s position at trial is that there was an Alleged \nAgreement that Mr Tan would not take more than a certain quantity of drugs. \nNonetheless, to give Mr Tan the benefit of the doubt, I do not hold this \nambiguity in questioning ASP Fernandez against him. To be clear, I do not fault \nMr Tan on the basis that he failed to put to ASP Fernandez in cross-examination \nthat during the recording of the second long statement, he had told \nASP Fernandez about the Alleged Agreement. \n106 That said, I do not agree with Mr Jumabhoy that paragraph 24 of the \nsecond long statement (especially the italicised words at [ 104] above) supports \nthe existence of the Alleged Agreement. All it says is that Mr Tan never took \ntwo \u201cbatu\u201d (ie, pounds)171 of heroin from Sal Poulez\/Pal in any of the prior \n170 NE, 22 March 2023, p 29 ln 1 to ln 6.  \n171 AB 345 at para 24.\nVersion No 1: 25 Aug 2023 (16:40 hrs)\nPP v Tan Yew Kuan[2023] SGHC 235\n55deliveries. As borne out by the context of the statement, this is essentially a \nnarration of Mr Tan\u2019s history of drug delivery with Pal. Simply put, Mr Tan \nindicated that the situation had not arisen before. I agree with Mr Jumbhoy that \nthere is no ambiguity in the meaning of these italicised words. Unfortunately, I \nam not persuaded by the meaning Mr Jumabhoy puts forth. To find that these \nitalicised words mean that there was a standing agreement with Pal that Mr Tan \nwould only collect one pound of heroin and\/or 125g of ice would be to accord \nto them more than their plain meaning. \n107 What is more telling is that in paragraph 20 of the same long statement, \nMr Tan said that:172\n[Pal] should not have assumed that I would be ok to collect this \namount of drugs. If \u2018Pal\u2019 try to brush me off, I would have \nwarned him not to put this amount of drugs without letting me \nknow next time. Normally, I would only collect 01 pound of \n\u2018heroin\u2019 or 125 grams of \u2018ice\u2019, or a mixture of both, from \u2018Pal\u2019s\u2019 \nconveyors. \nThis was another one of many opportunities to mention the Alleged Agreement, \nbut Mr Tan did not positively assert it. \n108 Further, I note that according to Mr Tan, the terms of the agreement were \nfirst reached with Segar and then re-established with Pal (see [ 37] above). These \nare key aspects of the defence. However, Mr Tan did not mention Segar and \nhow the botched transaction with Segar on or around 9 January 2020 led to the \nAlleged Agreement in any of the statements. This was not for want of an \nopportunity to do so. In Mr Tan\u2019s second long statement, he dealt at some length \nwith his dealings with Boy Tanjong before he started dealing with Pal.173 Then, \n172 AB 344 at para 20. \n173 AB 348 at para 33.\nVersion No 1: 25 Aug 2023 (16:40 hrs)\nPP v Tan Yew Kuan[2023] SGHC 235\n56contrary to his evidence at trial (that Boy Tanjong introduced Mr Tan to Segar \nbefore Pal came into the picture (see [ 34] above)), in the fifth long statement \nrecorded on 25 August 2020, Mr Tan said that it was Boy Tanjong who \nintroduced him to Pal.174 There was no mention of Segar, his understanding with \nSegar and how he came to reach the same agreement with Pal. To my mind, it \nis inexplicable why Mr Tan did not raise these matters.\n109 As I have discussed above, Mr Tan said in his second long statement \nthat he had never taken two \u201cbatu\u201d of heroin before ie, the situation had not \narisen before. Even if true, this does not take Mr Tan\u2019s defence very far. The \nfact that Mr Tan had never taken two \u201cbatu\u201d of heroin in his previous collections \nis insufficient to support the existence of a standing agreement to only collect \none pound of heroin and\/or 125g of ice (which is at the heart of the Alleged \nAgreement). The Alleged Agreement was raised belatedly at the trial and not in \nMr Tan\u2019s investigation statements. Accordingly, I am unable to accept Mr Tan\u2019s \naccount that the Alleged Agreement exists. That said, Mr Tan\u2019s claim that he \ndid not deal with more than one pound of heroin in previous transactions will \nbe considered again in relation to the question of whether he intended to traffic \nthe Drugs. \nWhether Mr Tan was the intended recipient of the Drugs\n110 Mr Tan relies on Mr Dineshkumar\u2019s evidence to provide the surrounding \ncircumstances of the transaction on 25 February 2020. I set out more of \nMr Dineshkumar\u2019s account. According to Mr Dineshkumar, at 8.50pm, Kelvin \nsent him a location at Jalan Besar and asked him to go there.175 Mr Dineshkumar \n174 AB 380 at para 70. \n175 NE, 27 March 2023, p 55 ln 16 to ln 18.\nVersion No 1: 25 Aug 2023 (16:40 hrs)\nPP v Tan Yew Kuan[2023] SGHC 235\n57refused to do so, as the journey would take too long. Then, at 9.01pm, he was \ngiven a second location at Fishery Port Road by Kelvin. Mr Dineshkumar \narrived there at about 9.15pm to 9.20pm.176 \n111 Initially, Kelvin told Mr Dineshkumar that someone would collect all \nthe bundles from him at Fishery Port Road.177 However, when he arrived and \ncalled Kelvin, Kelvin told him that because he was late, the recipient had left.178 \nMr Dineshkumar wanted to leave all the drugs at Fishery Port Road for the \nperson to collect, but Kelvin begged him to go to Lorong 7.179 Mr Dineshkumar \nthen packed the items, and proceeded to Lorong 7. \n112 Based on the above, Mr Tan argues that the Jalan Besar and Fishery Port \nRoad locations were pre-planned locations. Therefore, it is likely that at least \ntwo deliveries to two different persons were planned.180 Further, the way the \nbundles were hidden in the boot of the Car lend support to this. \nMr Dineshkumar\u2019s evidence is that originally there was one bundle in the black \nplastic bag (ie, E1B), while the other three bundles were simply in the boot. \nMr Dineshkumar placed one more bundle in the black plastic bag and the other \ntwo bundles in the white plastic bag.181 Mr Dineshkumar had to sort out the \nbundles for ease of delivery. Mr Tan argues that as the Three Bundles, E1A1, \nE1A2 and E1B1 contained heroin, it must have been E1B2 (which contained \n\u201cice\u201d) which was separately placed into the black plastic bag for easy \n176 NE, 27 March 2023, p 56 ln 20 to p 57 ln 15.\n177 NE, 27 March 2023, p 24 ln 17 to ln 19.\n178 NE, 27 March 2023, p 24 ln 20 to ln 26.\n179 NE, 27 March 2023, p 25 ln 1 to ln 10.\n180 Tan CS at para 26; AB 397 at para 61.\n181 AB 397 at para 62.\nVersion No 1: 25 Aug 2023 (16:40 hrs)\nPP v Tan Yew Kuan[2023] SGHC 235\n58identification. In any case, from the fact that the Three Bundles were left in the \ncar boot and not in a plastic bag, they could have been meant for different \ndeliveries. If Mr Tan only became the recipient of the Drugs because \nMr Dineshkumar did not go to the first location at Jalan Besar, and no one turned \nup at the second location at Fishery Port Road, whether Mr Tan knew about the \ndelivery of the Drugs becomes highly questionable.182\n113 Having carefully considered Mr Jumabhoy\u2019s arguments, I am unable to \naccept them. While Mr Tan was not the original intended recipient, there was \nlittle to suggest that he was not meant to receive all Four Bundles. I agree with \nthe Prosecution that at no time did Mr Dineshkumar say that there were any \ninstructions for him to split up the Four Bundles across several recipients. In \nfact, at Fishery Port Road, Mr Dineshkumar was specifically informed that the \nFour Bundles were meant to be collected by one recipient. It was the same for \nthe delivery to the third location ie, Lorong 7, where Mr Tan turned up and \nreceived the Four Bundles.183 That said, even if Mr Tan might not have expected \nto collect so many bundles of drugs, based on my discussion above, it seems \nclear enough that he was meant to collect heroin and \u201cice\u201d. Therefore, such \nsurrounding context does not, in my view, assist Mr Tan in rebutting the \npresumption of knowledge of the Drugs.   \nWhether Mr Tan has successfully rebutted the presumption of knowledge\n114 In evaluating Mr Tan\u2019s evidence concerning"}

This is because a claim for breach of confidence can protect both the wrongful loss interest and the wrongful gain interest at the same time, and each interest gives rise to its own remedies. 15', 'Conversely, the defendants submit that the plaintiffs are not entitled to make such a claim because the interests are very distinct. 16'"}

{"casename":"2023_SGHC_243","fact":"'4\\u2003I begin with the background to the parties\u2019 dispute. Sometime in or around 2015, FEM was contemplating its own listing on a recognised stock exchange. Mr Syed Abdel Nasser bin Syed Hassan Aljunied (\u201cMr Aljunied\u201d), one of the two directors of FEM alongside Mr Hong Kah Ing (\u201cMr Hong\u201d), recruited Mr Lim Eng Hoe (\u201cMr Lim\u201d) to assist in this endeavour. FEM later appointed Mr Lim as the Chief Financial Officer (\u201cCFO\u201d) on or around 10 March 2016, in order to facilitate this work. Sometime in February or March 2016, FEM also became interested in acquiring a controlling stake in a listed company, into which it also intended to inject assets. Mr Lim was tasked to seek out opportunities for a possible reverse takeover, which I have referred to above as the Transaction. At Mr Lim\u2019s recommendation, on or around 4 April 2016, FEM appointed Ms Chong Wan Ling (\u201cMs Chong\u201d) as its Group Financial Controller.', '5\\u2003In late May or early June 2016, Mr Lim was informed by Mr Alex Tan (\u201cMr Alex Tan\u201d) of ZICO Capital Pte Ltd that CBL was a suitable candidate company for the Transaction. 1', 'Mr Lim was also told by Mr Alex Tan that it was necessary to reach out directly to Datuk Lim, who was the controlling shareholder of CBL at the material time, through Mr Lee. 2', 'While Mr Lee\u2019s exact role within CBL at the time is a point of dispute between the parties, it is clear that Mr Lee is a lawyer who, before the material events, had acted for Datuk Lim or represented his business interests in Malaysia. 3', 'As such, Mr Lim reached out to Datuk Lim through Mr Lee on the Transaction.', '6\\u2003Mr Alex Tan further informed Mr Lim that Mr Alex Khor (\u201cMr Khor\u201d) of Strategic Advisory & Capital Pte Ltd (\u201cSAC\u201d), who had a close working relationship with CBL\u2019s board of independent directors and who was working to identify an asset which could be injected into CBL, would be able to assist in reaching out to CBL\u2019s board and convincing them of the commercial viability of the Transaction. 4', 'In this respect, Mr Lim met Mr Khor twice in or around June 2016, introducing himself as the CFO of FEM and explaining the Transaction to Mr Khor. 5', '7\\u2003On 28 June 2016, Mr Lim then introduced CBL to FEM as one of the potential listed companies via an email. 6', 'In the aforesaid email, Mr Lim also attached a document spreadsheet, in which it was stated that one set of \u201cArranger\u2019s Fee\u201d was to be 4% of the new shares issued, amounting to 100,405,925 shares, 7', 'which would be payable by CBL. 8', 'Subsequently, on 5 July 2016, Mr Lim informed Mr Hong and Mr Aljunied via WhatsApp that he would be having lunch with \u201cChina Bearing[\u2019s] lawyer\u201d on 12 July 2016. 9', '8\\u2003Beyond these background facts, the parties dispute much of what subsequently happened. For ease of exposition, the parties\u2019 dispute centres on the following material events:', 'Generally, these disputed events inform the overarching questions of whether FEM knew that Mr Lee was the beneficial owner of Axis; and, if not, the reason for it not knowing. More specifically, these events are material in three aspects. First, they are material to how the parties perceived Mr Lee, that is, whether they regarded him as FEM\u2019s introducer and arranger or as Datuk Lim\u2019s legal advisor and representative. Second, they are relevant to the question of whether the parties agreed to an arrangement whereby Mr Lee would receive the Arranger Fee for the Transaction through a shell company. Third, they are relevant to whether the parties concealed the aforementioned arrangement from Mr Hong and Mr Aljunied of FEM. In relation to these disputed material events, I will make the relevant findings of fact at the appropriate junctures below.', '9\\u2003The first disputed material event was the meeting between Mr Lee, Mr Lim, and Mr Khor on 12 July 2016 at Dome Caf\u00e9 at UOB Plaza 1 (\u201cthe Meeting of 12 July 2016\u201d). This meeting was ostensibly arranged to advance the Transaction. What transpired at this meeting is of some importance to the parties\u2019 cases.', '10\\u2003Axis\u2019s account is that Mr Lee, Mr Lim, and Mr Khor discussed and came to an understanding and agreement on the following points: 10', '(a)\\u2003Given Mr Lee\u2019s close working relationship with Datuk Lim, and the fact that he would be introducing FEM to Datuk Lim and had put forward the Transaction for Datuk Lim\u2019s consideration, Mr Lee would be the \u201cintroducer and arranger\u201d for FEM with regard to the Transaction, and Mr Lee would be paid the Arranger Fee by FEM.', '(b)\\u2003Mr Lee had instructed his corporate secretarial firm to look out for a dormant company in Malaysia, of which Mr Lee would be the representative. This company would eventually be Axis.', '(c)\\u2003Given Mr Khor\u2019s close relationship with CBL\u2019s independent directors, Mr Khor would act, through SAC, as the arranger for CBL. Mr Khor\u2019s arranger fee would be paid by CBL.', '(d)\\u2003In total, an arranger fee of 4% on the proposed acquisition value of CBL of US$120m would be split equally between Mr Lee and Mr Khor, with each arranger\u2019s fee to be paid by FEM and CBL, respectively. The objective was for all parties to work towards convincing CBL, its board, and its controlling shareholder, Datuk Lim, to agree to proceed with the Transaction.', '(e)\\u2003A dinner meeting in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia would be arranged for the introduction of FEM\u2019s representatives to Datuk Lim and for a discussion on the preliminary term sheet.', '(f)\\u2003Arrangements would be made for FEM and its representatives to present the Transaction to the CBL board members during the CBL board meeting that was scheduled to be held on 8 August 2016.', '(g)\\u2003CBL would appoint Mr Leong Chuo Ming (\u201cMr Leong\u201d) of Withers KhattarWong LLP as its legal advisor if CBL was prepared to proceed with the Transaction.', '11\\u2003According to Axis, Mr Lim then provided Mr Hong and Mr Aljunied with an update on the Meeting of 12 July 2016 after it had concluded. Having updated both Mr Hong and Mr Aljunied, Mr Lim then sent an email dated 14 July 2016 to both of them. 11', 'In this email, Mr Lim stated:', 'In addition, cl 3 of the aforementioned \u201crevised draft Term Sheet\u201d states:', 'Axis contends that the statement in the aforesaid email was meant to highlight to Mr Hong and Mr Aljunied that the arranger fee of 4% of the proposed acquisition value of US$120m was to be split equally between Mr Lee and Mr Khor. 12', '12\\u2003On the other hand, while FEM does not dispute that the Meeting of 12 July 2016 took place, it challenges Axis\u2019s account of what transpired at the meeting. According to FEM, 13', 'concerns were raised as to whether the Transaction would be derailed if the arranger fee of 4% of US$120m (amounting to US$4.8m) expected by Mr Lee and Mr Khor were to be borne solely by CBL. Thus, in order to ensure that the no one knew of the actual arranger fee, it was agreed between Mr Lim, Mr Lee, and Mr Khor that the 4% arranger fee would be split equally between Mr Lee and Mr Khor, where FEM would pay Mr Lee\u2019s fees to a company beneficially owned by him, and Mr Khor\u2019s fees would be paid by CBL through SAC.', '13\\u2003According to FEM, in order to conceal this alleged scheme (\u201cthe alleged Scheme\u201d), Mr Lim, Mr Lee, and Mr Khor agreed to: 14', '(a)\\u2003procure FEM to execute the Engagement Letter with a company with nominee shareholders and directors but beneficially owned by Mr Lee;', '(b)\\u2003intentionally conceal from FEM the fact that Mr Lee was the beneficial owner of this company; and', '(c)\\u2003intentionally conceal from FEM that Mr Lee would be personally benefitting from the Transaction as the recipient of the 2% Arranger Fee from FEM.', '14\\u2003FEM further says 15', 'this arrangement for Mr Lee to be paid the 2% Arranger Fee was kept secret from Mr Hong and Mr Aljunied because, had they been aware of it, they would have immediately objected to Mr Lee\u2019s appointment as its introducer and arranger. In this regard, Mr Lim had previously informed Mr Hong and Mr Aljunied that Mr Lee was Datuk Lim\u2019s legal advisor and representative, and that Mr Lee intended to, and did in fact, assist Datuk Lim with the Transaction. According to FEM, Mr Lee was obviously in a position of conflict of interest, and FEM (ie, Mr Hong and Mr Aljunied) would not have agreed to directly engage Mr Lee to act for FEM.', '15\\u2003Moreover, following the Meeting of 12 July 2016, FEM contends that Mr Lim did not update Mr Hong or Mr Aljunied on his discussions with Mr Lee and Mr Khor in relation to the payable arranger fee. It is also FEM\u2019s position that, pursuant to the alleged Scheme outlined at [13] above, Mr Lee, Mr Lim, and Mr Khor took various steps to prevent FEM from discovering Mr Lee\u2019s beneficial ownership of Axis, and the fact that he would therefore be personally benefitting from the Transaction. These steps allegedly included: 16', '(a)\\u2003deliberately excluding Mr Hong and Mr Aljunied from key correspondence and communications which would have revealed the alleged Scheme;', '(b)\\u2003continuing to misrepresent to Mr Hong and Mr Aljunied that Mr Lee was assisting in the Transaction solely in his capacity as Datuk Lim\u2019s legal advisor and representative;', '(c)\\u2003using nominee shareholders and directors for Axis, so as to conceal the fact that Mr Lee was the beneficial owner of Axis throughout the Transaction;', '(d)\\u2003refraining from correcting documents which revealed that Mr Lee was the beneficial owner and representative of Axis; and', '(e)\\u2003excluding references to the fact that Mr Lee would be receiving arranger fees through Axis from FEM from key contractual documents.', '16\\u2003Lastly, as to the question of what transpired at the meeting, it is undisputed that Mr Lee liaised separately with his corporate secretarial firm on the morning of 20 July 2016 in order to take over a dormant company which he intended to use to collect the Arranger Fee. To this end, he instructed Ms Ee Fong Nee (\u201cMs Ee\u201d) and Mr Goh Horng Tyng (\u201cMr Goh\u201d) to take over Axis on 22 July 2016. 17', '17\\u2003After the Meeting of 12 July 2016, the second disputed material event relates to the dinner which was held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on 20 July 2016 (\u201cthe Dinner of 20 July 2016\u201d). The parties do not dispute that this dinner happened, and it is common ground that this dinner was attended by Datuk Lim, Mr Lee, Mr Hong, Mr Aljunied, and Mr Lim. It is also undisputed that, during the dinner, FEM was introduced to CBL. However, parties dispute what transpired during the dinner \u2013 which is significant to (a) how FEM, in particular, Mr Hong and Mr Aljunied, perceived Mr Lee\u2019s role, and (b) whether Mr Lee carried out the services listed in the Engagement Letter.', '18\\u2003According to Axis, the way that Mr Lee conducted himself was in line with him being the introducer and arranger for FEM, as Mr Lee was: 18', '(a)\\u2003assisting FEM with translating the matters discussed at the meeting because Datuk Lim did not understand English; and', '(b)\\u2003making proposals to Datuk Lim as to how the Transaction ought to be structured.', '19\\u2003Additionally, Axis asserts that, on the night of 20 July 2016, Mr Lim informed Mr Hong and Mr Aljunied that it would be through Axis that Mr Lee would carry out the services as introducer and arranger, after which Mr Lee would receive the Arranger Fee. 19', '20\\u2003However, according to FEM, Mr Lee and Mr Lim continued to misrepresent to Mr Hong and Mr Aljunied during the dinner that Mr Lee was assisting in the Transaction solely as Datuk Lim\u2019s legal advisor and representative, and conceal the fact that Mr Lee was to receive the Arranger Fee from FEM through a company beneficially owned by Mr Lee. 20', 'In this regard, FEM asserts the following: 21', '(a)\\u2003Mr Lim introduced Mr Lee to Mr Hong and Mr Aljunied as Datuk Lim\u2019s legal advisor, representative, and translator.', '(b)\\u2003There was no discussion whatsoever on the Arranger Fee purportedly payable by FEM to Mr Lee\/Axis, or that an arrangement had allegedly been reached for Mr Lee\/Axis to act as FEM\u2019s introducer and arranger. There was also no mention of the fact that Mr Lee would be using Axis for the purposes of carrying out the services under the Engagement Letter. As against Axis\u2019s assertion that the Arranger Fee was discussed on 20 July 2016, FEM contends that this is a bare assertion that is unbelievable.', '21\\u2003Following the dinner on 20 July 2016, the third disputed material event relates to the site visits on 25 and 26 July 2016 to a nickel mine in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia, of which FEM was an indirect owner. 22', 'These site visits were arranged to allow CBL to conduct due diligence on the nickel mine. 23', 'While the parties agree that the site visits occurred, they disagree as to what was discussed during those visits. First, the parties dispute whether the relevant persons at the site visits \u2013 which included Mr Lim, Mr Leong, Mr Hong, and Mr Lee \u2013 discussed the arrangement to engage Mr Lee through Axis as FEM\u2019s arranger and for the Arranger Fee to be payable to Mr Lee. Second, the parties dispute whether Mr Lim and Mr Lee concealed from Mr Hong the fact that Mr Lee was the beneficial owner and representative of Axis.', '22\\u2003According to Axis, Mr Hong was well aware of this arrangement. 24', 'In this regard, 25', 'Mr Lee allegedly made a request to Mr Lim and Mr Hong to have his arranger fee be paid in cash. However, Mr Hong and Mr Lim insisted that Mr Lee\u2019s arranger fee be paid in shares, in line with market practice. Mr Lee then said he would finalise the draft Memorandum of Understanding, Letter of Undertaking, and Engagement Letter for FEM to review. Mr Lee further told Mr Hong that he would use a company of which he (Mr Lee) was the representative to carry out his services as introducer and arranger for FEM.', '23\\u2003However, according to FEM, as the site visits were arranged for the purpose of allowing CBL to conduct its due diligence on the nickel mine, the discussions that took place were focused on the operations of the nickel mine, and Mr Hong addressed the queries posed by Mr Lee and Mr Leong on this issue. FEM alleges that throughout the site visits: 26', '(a)\\u2003Mr Lee continued to represent to Mr Hong that he was the legal advisor and representative of Datuk Lim, which was made clear to Mr Hong from the queries posed by Mr Lee.', '(b)\\u2003There was no discussion whatsoever regarding the arranger fee that was allegedly to be paid by FEM to Axis or Mr Lee. Mr Hong was also not informed, whether by Mr Lim or Mr Lee, that Mr Lee would be using a company of which he would be the representative to assist FEM with the Transaction.', '24\\u2003Next, the fourth disputed material event relates to the board meeting which was held on 8 August 2016. The parties do not dispute that this meeting happened and that it was attended by Mr Khor, Mr Lee, Mr Lim, Mr Aljunied, Mr Leyng Thai Weng (\u201cMr Leyng\u201d), the former Financial Controller of CBL, and CBL\u2019s board (comprising Datuk Lim, Mr Wong Chee Meng Lawrence, Mr Lee Kean Cheong, and Mr Tan Kah Ghee). 27', 'However, the parties disagree over how Mr Lee\u2019s role in the Transaction was understood during the board meeting.', '25\\u2003According to Axis, Mr Lee attended the board meeting as the introducer and arranger of FEM to help \u201csell\u201d the Transaction and assist in its translation so that the majority shareholder of CBL, Datuk Lim, could receive information on the Transaction. 28', 'Mr Lee also allegedly posed queries, as he was the \u201cdeal maker\u201d and would ask questions to satisfy himself that there would not be \u201cany potential hiccough [sic] to the deal\u201d. 29', 'Mr Lee then allegedly provided input or information to \u201chelp the board of CBL \u2026 make the decision on whether to proceed with the Proposed Transaction\u201d. 30', '26\\u2003On the other hand, FEM contends that throughout the meeting, Mr Lee was acting solely as Datuk Lim\u2019s legal advisor and representative, posing queries on behalf of Datuk Lim, and translating the matters that were being discussed for the benefit of Datuk Lim. 31', 'Moreover, after the meeting ended, Mr Aljunied and Mr Lim left the meeting to allow CBL\u2019s board to commence its board meeting. In this regard, FEM says that the fact that Mr Lee did not leave the ensuing board meeting only cemented Mr Aljunied\u2019s understanding that Mr Lee was Datuk Lim\u2019s legal advisor and representative, and that he was permitted to stay on for the board meeting in that capacity. 32', 'As such, in light of the above, FEM\u2019s position is that Mr Lee\u2019s assertion that he was simply Datuk Lim\u2019s translator (and not Datuk Lim\u2019s legal advisor and representative) is clearly false. 33', '27\\u2003The fifth disputed material event relates to the signing of the Engagement Letter on 16 August 2016, and specifically, whether Mr Lee and Mr Lim concealed the fact that Mr Lee was the beneficial owner and representative of Axis in order to induce FEM to sign the Engagement Letter.', '28\\u2003In this regard, Axis says that it was Ms Chong who had printed out the Engagement Letter, wrote down Mr Aljunied\u2019s particulars, and passed it to Mr Aljunied for him to sign. 34', 'Axis further alleges that Mr Aljunied signed the Engagement Letter without asking any questions because the terms contained therein were based on his previous amendments. 35', 'As such, Axis contends that Mr Aljunied was well aware of the contents of the entire Engagement Letter, including the circumstances that resulted in the then-prevailing terms of the Engagement Letter. If there had been any issues, he would not have signed it and would have asked Mr Lim to contact Mr Lee again to make further amendments. 36', '29\\u2003Against this, FEM contends that the Engagement Letter was first placed before Mr Aljunied on 16 August 2016 by Mr Lim and that, in signing the Engagement Letter, Mr Aljunied relied on Mr Lim\u2019s assurance that Axis would be able to assist FEM in the Transaction. 37', 'FEM further argues that, as part of their scheme, Mr Lee and Mr Lim continued to conceal the fact that Mr Lee was the beneficial owner and representative of Axis in order to induce FEM to sign the Engagement Letter. In particular, FEM alleges that:', '(a)\\u2003When Mr Aljunied asked Mr Lim who Axis\u2019s representatives were and who had signed the Engagement Letter on behalf of Axis, Mr Lim\u2019s response was simply that Mr Aljunied would have the opportunity to meet Axis\u2019s representatives in due course when Axis commenced work on the Transaction.', '(b)\\u2003Mr Lee also took additional steps to arrange for the Engagement Letter to be signed by Mr Goh (who was never once involved or played any part in the Transaction) instead of signing it himself and indicating on the Engagement Letter that he was the beneficial owner and representative of Axis. This extra effort was taken despite the fact that not only had the Engagement Letter been prepared by Mr Lee\u2019s own associates in Han & Partners (a Malaysian law firm of which Mr Lee was the managing partner), 38', 'he had been the person who would approve the drafts before they were sent to Mr Lim.', '30\\u2003FEM also alleges that, after the Engagement Letter was signed, Mr Lee was not satisfied with it because it was signed solely by Mr Aljunied. This was because Mr Lee wanted to ensure that he would be able to enforce the Engagement Letter against FEM and eventually receive the Arranger Fee. Accordingly, Mr Lee allegedly orally instructed Mr Lim, over a telephone call, to procure Mr Hong\u2019s signature on the Engagement Letter as well. 39', '31\\u2003The sixth disputed material event relates to the signing of FEM\u2019s consent letters on 17 November 2017 and 12 March 2018 in respect of certain loan agreements which were entered into between Axis and CBL for the principal amounts of S$1,000,000 and S$270,000 respectively, with CBL as the borrower and Axis as the lender. These consent letters were necessary as FEM had to consent to CBL\u2019s entry into the loan agreements with Axis, since the loan would eventually have to be repaid out of the escrow account which CBL would inherit after the completion of the Transaction, 40', 'which would ostensibly affect FEM as well given the proposed merger between FEM and CBL.', '32\\u2003In relation to the circumstances surrounding the signing of the consent letters, FEM contends that Ms Chong took active steps to assist Mr Lim and Mr Lee with the implementation and concealment of the alleged Scheme by refraining from informing Mr Aljunied who Axis\u2019s representatives were, even when Mr Aljunied directly queried her on this. 41', 'In this regard, Mr Aljunied claimed that \u201cMs Chong sought to pressure [him] into signing the First Consent Letter on the basis that the completion of the Proposed Transaction would be held up if [he] failed to sign it\u201d. 42', 'Additionally, FEM points out that both loan agreements specifically provided that any notices required to be given under the loan agreements should be addressed to Mr Goh, a director and shareholder of Axis at that time, despite the fact that Mr Goh did not play any role in the Transaction. FEM says that this was a deliberate step taken by Mr Lee to conceal his identity as the beneficial owner of Axis. 43', '33\\u2003Axis denies FEM\u2019s contentions and says that it is incredulous that Mr Aljunied, being an experienced director, would be so gullible as to sign such an important document when an employee (ie, Ms Chong) pressured him to do so. 44', 'Axis also points out that Mr Aljunied did not go past Ms Chong and satisfy himself as to who the representative of Axis was. According to Axis, this could only mean that Mr Aljunied already knew that Mr Lee was the representative of Axis, and that Mr Aljunied\u2019s denial of this is clearly an afterthought. 45', '34\\u2003In summary, these factual disputes are material to the legal issues of whether: (a) the Engagement Letter should be declared void for unilateral mistake at common law, misrepresentation, and\/or illegality as Mr Hong and Mr Aljunied did not know that Mr Lee was the beneficial owner of Axis at the relevant time; (b) whether the defendants in counterclaim misrepresented by their conduct or silence as to the beneficial ownership of Axis; (c) whether the services undertaken by Axis in the Engagement Letter were performed; and (d) whether the defendants in counterclaim engaged in an unlawful means conspiracy to cause injury to FEM.

In 2004, Mr Sadique and Mr Zulkifli set up the law practice called M\/s Sadique Marican & Z M Amin (the \u201cFirm\u201d). Mr Zulkifli was the Firm\u2019s managing partner and managed the Firm\u2019s client and office accounts while Mr Sadique was responsible for matters concerning staff salaries and the monthly review of the balances in the client account.', '5\\u2003On 19 November 2007, Mr Sadique discovered that both the Firm\u2019s client and office accounts were overdrawn. One day later, Mr Zulkifli absconded.', '6\\u2003On 22 November 2007, Mr Sadique and another partner of the Firm informed the Compliance and Conduct Department of the Law Society of Singapore (the \u201cLaw Society\u201d) that Mr Zulkifli was untraceable and that they suspected that he had misappropriated moneys from both the client and the office accounts. A police report was also made on the same day.', '7\\u2003On 23 November 2007, the Compliance and Conduct Department of the Law Society informed Mr Sadique that the Council of the Law Society (the \u201cCouncil\u201d) would inspect the Firm\u2019s accounts for the period 1 January 2007 to 22 November 2007. The subsequent inspection by the Law Society revealed that the Firm had not prepared any bank reconciliation statements after June 2007. Further, contrary to the Legal Profession (Solicitors\u2019 Accounts) Rules (Cap 161, R8, 1999 Rev Ed) (\u201cSAR\u201d), the Firm had issued cash cheques totalling $5,660,357.02 and the propriety of issuing those cheques could not be verified due to insufficient documentation supporting the payments.', '8\\u2003On 3 June 2008, the Council referred the matter to an Inquiry Committee which recommended a formal investigation by a Disciplinary Tribunal (\u201cDT\u201d). Before the DT, the Law Society preferred three charges against Mr Sadique for his breaches of the SAR:', '(a)\\u2003The \u201cFirst Charge\u201d was that for the period August to October 2007, Mr Sadique failed to conduct any reconciliation of the balances in the clients\u2019 cash books and the monthly bank statements of the Firm\u2019s client account and also to keep a statement showing the reconciliation in a cash book or other appropriate accounting documents.', '(b)\\u2003The \u201cSecond Charge\u201d was that for the period 3 January 2007 to 20 November 2007, Mr Sadique failed to record or cause to be recorded all transactions concerning the Firm\u2019s client account in ledgers required to be maintained.', '(c)\\u2003The \u201cThird Charge\u201d was that for the period 3 January 2007 to 20 November 2007, Mr Sadique breached his duty as a co-signatory of the Firm\u2019s client account by failing to adequately supervise transactions involving this account and by failing to safeguard clients\u2019 moneys in the account such that unauthorised transactions were made from it.', '9\\u2003On 5 August 2009, the DT heard the charges against Mr Sadique and found that the First Charge was proved only in relation to the month of October 2007 but not August and September 2007. The DT found that Mr Sadique was guilty in respect of the Second Charge and the Third Charge. The DT was of the view that there was sufficient cause for disciplinary action to be taken against Mr Sadique. An application was then taken out in Originating Summons No 219 of 2010 (\u201cOS 219\u201d) for Mr Sadique to show cause why he should not be sanctioned under s 83 of the LPA.', '10\\u2003The Court of Three Judges (the \u201cCourt\u201d) heard OS 219 and issued its decision on 20 January 2011. In respect of the First Charge, the Court affirmed the DT\u2019s finding that the reconciliation statements for October 2007 had not been prepared. The Court further held that the August and September 2007 reconciliation statements were also not prepared.', '11\\u2003In respect of the Second Charge, the Court agreed with the DT\u2019s findings. The Court noted that Mr Sadique was unable to produce the Firm\u2019s actual ledger as he claimed that it was missing.', '12\\u2003In respect of the Third Charge, the Court agreed with the DT\u2019s findings. The Court observed that Mr Sadique\u2019s failure to supervise the Firm\u2019s accounts and to put in place an adequate system of periodic checks allowed Mr Zulkifli to commit a massive fraud over a relatively short period of time.', '13\\u2003The Court was of the view that the appropriate penalty was for Mr Sadique to be struck off the Roll for the following reasons:', '(a)\\u2003First, while Mr Sadique did not misappropriate the clients\u2019 moneys and there was no dishonesty on his part, he allowed Mr Zulkifli to manage the Firm\u2019s accounts alone and without a framework for periodic checks. This resulted in no checks being conducted during the period when the misappropriations took place. This was in spite of the fact that Mr Sadique would have known that the Firm had a sizeable conveyancing practice and that the client account would contain substantial funds.', '(b)\\u2003Second, an advocate and solicitor could be struck off the Roll for serious transgressions other than dishonesty in exceptional circumstances. The present facts amounted to such an exceptional case due to the huge financial loss caused to the Firm\u2019s clients.', '(c)\\u2003Third, Mr Sadique\u2019s dereliction of duty was a serious breach of professional responsibility as it facilitated losses to more than 80 clients of a sum of more than $11m. While the Firm was able to repay about $1m to its clients, there was still an amount of $10m that the Firm was unable to repay.', '14\\u2003Following Mr Zulkifli\u2019s abscondment, Mr Sadique and the Firm arranged to pay out more than $1m to the Firm\u2019s clients. However, as Mr Sadique was unable to pay the majority of the debts owed to the Firm\u2019s clients and creditors, bankruptcy proceedings were commenced against him in 2009. He was declared a bankrupt on 4 February 2010.', '15\\u2003Thereafter, Mr Sadique made monthly payments averaging $1,000 for a period of 12 years until the Official Assignee applied for him to be discharged from bankruptcy on the grounds of his good conduct, regular payments and a serious medical condition that he was suffering from. None of Mr Sadique\u2019s creditors objected to this application and Mr Sadique was discharged from bankruptcy on 7 February 2022.', '16\\u2003As alluded to at [15] above, Mr Sadique was diagnosed with cancer of the oesophagus in 2013 which eventually led to the removal of his stomach. The cancer recurred in 2015 and he sought further treatment in July that year that involved aggressive chemotherapy. Mr Sadique has since made a full recovery.', '17\\u2003Mr Sadique continued to be actively involved and engaged in legal work overseas after he was struck off the Roll. From January 2011, he took up a variety of in-house legal roles in Dubai and won awards for his work as general counsel. Between June 2022 and February 2023, Mr Sadique joined a UAE private practice in Dubai as the Head of Arbitration.', '18\\u2003Aside from his core legal work in Dubai, Mr Sadique was involved in law-related speaking engagements and he has published law-related articles. Mr Sadique also attended legal courses even after he was struck off the Roll.

I reproduce an organisational chart of the Company\u2019s shareholding structure:', '', '4\\u2003The Company is insolvent because it could not pay its debts when they fell due. It has three undisputed creditors, which are BNI, Emirates, and PT Peak Sekuritas Indonesia (\u201cPeak Sekuritas\u201d). BNI and Emirates each extended a loan to the Company under separate facility agreements. On the other hand, Peak Sekuritas took over a debt that the Company had owed to HSBC Bank (\u201cHSBC\u201d). Based on the Company\u2019s total debt to these three creditors, BNI is the majority creditor, as it is owed 63.99%, whereas Emirates is owed 25.093% and Peak Sekuritas is owed 10.917%.', '5\\u2003Due to its financial difficulties, the Company made a number of court applications. According to BNI and Emirates, the affidavits filed by the Company in support of these applications are important. This is because the Company specifically listed out the above-mentioned three undisputed creditors without any mention of GL as a creditor. This is a point that I will return to below.', '6\\u2003In April 2021, the Company and GL applied for moratoriums under s 64(1) of the IRDA (the \u201cMoratorium Applications\u201d).

BNI and Emirates objected to this application. The Company was advised and represented by experienced professionals, including its restructuring advisor and proposed scheme manager, AJCapital.

Since the first respondent also needed more time to familiarise himself with the Company, he wrote to the Official Receiver pursuant to s 94(6) of the IRDA for an extension of time for the interim judicial management until 3 January 2023.', '13\\u2003On 23 November 2022, the Official Receiver informed the first respondent over a telephone call that it had no objections to the extension of time sought. However, the Official Receiver asked the first respondent to consider seeking a 60-day extension of the interim judicial management period in light of the various complexities involved. The first respondent agreed and applied on the same day for a further extension of time to 2 February 2023. On 29 November 2022, the Official Receiver granted this further extension of time.', '14\\u2003On 19 January 2023, the first respondent wrote to the Company\u2019s creditors to inform them that the Pre-Appointment Meeting would be convened on 2 February 2023 (the \u201c19 January 2023 Letter\u201d). 12', 'The first respondent also enclosed the SOA prepared by the Company\u2019s directors, as well as a list of the Company\u2019s creditors (the \u201cList of Creditors\u201d) and the estimated amount of their claims based on information set out in the SOA. It is significant to note the following about the enclosures.', '(a)\\u2003First, the List of Creditors included two additional creditors, being GL and AJCapital, in addition to the three creditors that the Company had previously listed. According to BNI and Emirates, this is crucial because if the two additional creditors voted alongside Peak Sekuritas, they would form the majority, thereby depriving BNI and Emirates of their majority status among the previous known list of three creditors.', '(b)\\u2003Second, it was pivotal that GL was recognised as a creditor for the sum of US$30,950,054 because this amount would constitute 46.354% of the Company\u2019s total debt. This means that GL\u2019s vote would be the \u201cswing vote\u201d, ie, it is likely that no majority could be reached without voting together with GL.', '15\\u2003Because of the potential impact caused by the recognition of GL as a creditor, BNI and Emirates submit that it is inexplicable for the first respondent to have concluded that GL was a creditor and therefore be entitled to attend and vote at the Pre-Appointment Meeting. In this regard, the SOA showed that, as part of the Company\u2019s assets, GL owed a sum of US$321,620,209 to the Company, while the Company owed a sum of US$30,950,054 to GL. As such, the SOA showed that GL was a net debtor of the Company in the sum of US$290,670,155. 13', '16\\u2003The first respondent received two responses to the 19 January 2023 Letter, namely, a letter from Emirates\u2019s solicitors dated 26 January 2023 and a letter from BNI\u2019s solicitors dated 30 January 2023. The first respondent was given until 30 January 2023 and 31 January 2023, respectively, to respond to the letters. In these letters, BNI and Emirates took issue with the debts owed by the Company to GL as set out in the List of Creditors. In particular, BNI and Emirates based their objections on the fact that the Company had not identified GL as a creditor in the earlier court proceedings. 14', 'Moreover, BNI also questioned why the mutual debts between the Company and GL had not been set off. 15', 'The first respondent states that it was not possible for him to investigate the issues raised within the short response time given by BNI and Emirates.', '17\\u2003Parenthetically, both BNI and Emirates had submitted their respective proxy forms to the first respondent before the Pre-Appointment Meeting, wherein they voted against the judicial management resolutions. GL had done the same on or about 30 January 2023, wherein it voted in favour of the judicial management resolutions. Therefore, before the Pre-Appointment Meeting, the first respondent knew the positions taken by BNI, Emirates, and GL, as well as the likely outcome of the vote.', '18\\u2003Subsequently, at the Pre-Appointment Meeting on 2 February 2023, the first respondent decided to admit all the creditors\u2019 proofs of debts for the limited purpose of voting at the meeting. BNI objected only to the admission of GL\u2019s proof of debt, but not AJCapital\u2019s proof of debt. In response, the first respondent recorded BNI\u2019s objection and informed BNI that it could make an application to court after the meeting. According to the minutes of the Pre-Appointment Meeting, Emirates did not raise any objection to GL\u2019s or AJCapital\u2019s proofs of debt.', '19\\u2003As it turned out, a statutory majority was reached at the Pre-Appointment Meeting, and the Company was placed under judicial management. The first respondent was appointed as the judicial manager of the Company. On 10 February 2023, the first respondent applied successfully for CWU 139 to be dismissed given that the Company had been placed under judicial management. After some further correspondence between the first respondent, BNI, and Emirates, the latter two filed OA 130 and OA 184, respectively, on 15 February 2023 and 2 March 2023.'"}

In fact, the appellant himself seeks to rely on inferences from the \nCCTV footage that are not found in the Statement of Facts, such as Hafiz\u2019s use \nof what counsel asserts to be broken glass during the fighting.\n11 On balance, Hafiz\u2019s involvement is more similar to that of the \nappellant\u2019s as someone who had flung a table at the victims and made no attempt \nto de-escalate the situation. The DJ thus did not err in considering a comparison \nwith Hafiz to be a relevant starting point. \nComparison of culpability \n12 I next assess the DJ\u2019s treatment of the relative culpability of Hafiz and \nthe appellant in terms of offence-specific factors.  \n13 I note that the DJ did in fact find that Hafiz\u2019s conduct was more \negregious. To this extent, I agree with the appellant\u2019s submissions that Hafiz \ndemonstrated a significantly higher degree of violence. \na) As noted by the DJ, Hafiz threw the bar table twice compared to the \nappellant who threw it only once.\nb) The potential harm of Hafiz\u2019s actions would also have been greater \nthan that of the appellant. In this regard, I do not fully accept the \nappellant\u2019s submission that the appellant\u2019s throw of the table landed \nonly at the foot of the sofa, as it is not clear from the footage whether \nthe table landed on the leg of a victim. I also take into account the \nrespondent\u2019s submissions that the appellant was the first person to \nutilize the bar table as an implement. However, I find Hafiz to have \nVersion No 2: 01 Feb 2023 (17:50 hrs)\nKesavan Chandiran v PP [2023] SGHC 25\n5on balance engaged in more aggravated use of the bar table than the \nappellant. In particular, the second use of the table by Hafiz was \naimed squarely at the head and chest area of the victim from a close \ndistance. This was much more intentional and a repeated targeting \nof a vulnerable area of the body than was demonstrated by the \nappellant.\nc) The potential harm of the Hafiz\u2019s behaviour was also greater in \nrespect of the other implements used by him. While both Hafiz and \nthe appellant used a pitcher as an implement in their assaults, Hafiz \nadditionally used a piece of what appears to be broken glass from \nthe floor to hit the victims.\nd) The degree of culpability of both co-accused persons is also \ndifferentiated by their responses to the violence. As noted earlier, the \nappellant helped to carry away an injured person from the scene. \nHafiz conversely did not offer any assistance. Hafiz\u2019s attacks on the \nvictim also continued after Jude\u2019s intervention, even after the \nappellant had ceased participating in the fight.\n14 In view of the above, a downward calibration from Hafiz\u2019s three strokes \nto one stroke would be appropriate before consideration of the offender-specific \nfactors.\n15 In reaching this conclusion, I attribute minimal weight to the fact that \nHafiz was involved in the initial dispute before any violence occurred. On this \npoint, I accept the respondent\u2019s submissions that the escalation of the fight was \ntriggered primarily by M Dipan\u2019s disproportionate and sudden use of violence, \nand that the context of the original dispute is thus of limited relevance.\nVersion No 2: 01 Feb 2023 (17:50 hrs)\nKesavan Chandiran v PP [2023] SGHC 25\n616 I now turn to examine the offender-specific factors.\n17 I agree with the DJ that the appellant\u2019s past record points towards an \nuplift in sentence. Only two and a half years ago, the appellant had been placed \non probation for the exact same offence. Specific deterrence would have \nelevated importance in such a situation.\n18 However, it must also be considered that Hafiz had reoffended while on \nbail. This was his second offence which was committed while on court bail and \na significant aggravating factor in Hafiz\u2019s case. This consideration does not \napply to the appellant. While the absence of offending on bail does not obviate \nthe need for specific deterrence, it is nevertheless a valid consideration in the \ncalibration of parity between co-accused persons.\n19 In relation to the appellant\u2019s age, I reject the appellant\u2019s submission that \nthere should be no distinction between the appellant and the co-accused Hafiz \njust because both are above 21 years old. The appellant argues that no \npresumption in favour of rehabilitation exists when an offender is above the age \nof 21, on the basis of cases such as Public Prosecutor v Mok Ping Wuen Maurice \n[1998] 3 SLR(R) 439, Public Prosecutor v Lim Cheng Ji Alvin [2017] 5 SLR \n671 and A Karthik v Public Prosecutor [2018] SGHC 202 (\u201cA Karthik\u201d). In my \nview, this is a red herring. The DJ in this case did not make any finding \nregarding the existence of a presumption in favour of rehabilitation on the basis \nof Hafiz\u2019s age. Instead, the DJ considered the relative youth of Hafiz compared \nto the appellant as a general factor in calibrating the parity of their sentences.4 \n4 GD at [19].\nVersion No 2: 01 Feb 2023 (17:50 hrs)\nKesavan Chandiran v PP [2023] SGHC 25\n720 Assessing the correctness of the DJ\u2019s consideration thus requires \nanswering the following question: Can a difference in the age of co-offenders \nengaged in the same criminal enterprise be a valid basis for modifying the \napplication of the parity principle between them, if both are above the age of \nmajority?\n21 I answer this question in the affirmative. I first consider that the age of \nan offender is in general a factor that the court is empowered to take into account \nduring sentencing. Specifically, the relative youth of an offender can be relevant \nin determining the weight to be attributed to the sentencing objectives of \ndeterrence and rehabilitation, as per Ng Kean Meng Terence v Public \nProsecutor [2017] 2 SLR 449 (\u201cTerence Ng\u201d).

All this while, the Patient remained in the same seated position on the chair. The paramedics examined the Patient and found him to be pulseless and not breathing. They moved the Patient from the chair to the floor, laying him down in a supine position, before performing manual CPR.

In response, the appellant called Dr Lim Swee Han (\u201cDr Lim\u201d), who is a senior consultant of the Department of Emergency Medicine at the Singapore General Hospital. Dr Lim was initially asked by SMC to provide an expert opinion for the purpose of the disciplinary inquiry and he did so on 11 March 2020.

The claimant issued the letter of credit for this sum on 15 July 2022 (the \u201cLetter of Credit\u201d). The claimant later cancelled the Letter of Credit on 11 October 2022 as the required supporting documents were not presented to it. As such, with the sums extended under the Trust Receipt and the Letter of Credit, the outstanding amount on the EFS Trade Facility was well over US$551,497,98, leaving less than US$50,000 available credit for the defendant to draw down on. In any event, the claimant did not receive any further application from the defendant, especially in respect of the transactions mentioned at [12] below.', '8\\u2003The defendant defaulted in paying for the Trust Receipt when it fell due on 8 August 2022.

According to the defendant, in or around July 2022, the claimant requested documents from the defendant to process a fourth trade facility. This was to replace the third trade facility pursuant to the Letter of Offer dated 13 July 2021, which was due to expire on 18 July 2022. Because the third trade facility was about to expire at the time, the defendant kept all its new businesses on hold until the fourth trading facility was approved.', '12\\u2003On 28 August 2022, the claimant debited a fee of S$6,343.88 from the defendant\u2019s account as renewal fees for the EFS Trade Facility, or what the defendant has termed as the \u201cfourth trade facility\u201d. The defendant, in reliance of what it says is an agreement between the parties on a fourth trade facility, immediately went to its buyers to conclude the transactions that had been put on hold pending the renewal of the EFS Trade Facility.

On 13 September 2022, the defendant concluded an agreement with its buyer for the sale of two containers of virgin coconut oil worth US$448,350. The defendant claims that the claimant\u2019s denial of the use of the EFS Trade Facility deprived the defendant of a profit of at least US$155,500 on these transactions. However, it bears noting that while the claimant recalled all the banking facilities on 25 October 2022, including the EFS Trade Facility, the defendant never applied for any credit in respect of these transactions before that date. The defendant further claims that it was in a position to make at least six of such transactions had the EFS Trade Facility not been wrongfully terminated.

The Appellant agreed to the job offer.', '3\\u2003On 8 December 2022, at around 11.00pm, Ann informed the Appellant that there was an unpacking job at Ecotech@Sunview, 1 Sunview Road. Ann told the Appellant to meet at that location.', '4\\u2003On 9 December 2022, at about 3.00am, the Appellant arrived at Ecotech@Sunview as instructed. There, he met one Muhammad Nur bin Mohd Yunos (\u201cNur\u201d), one Muhammad Syafiiy Salim (\u201cSyafiiy\u201d) and two other unknown men for the first time. Ann then created a WhatsApp chat group. Using that chat group, Ann informed that a Malaysian lorry would be delivering four different brands of duty unpaid cigarettes to Ecotech@Sunview and provided the breakdown of the quantity and the brands of cigarettes. The Appellant then became aware that the job involved duty unpaid cigarettes but he continued to wait for the arrival of the Malaysian lorry.', '5\\u2003Shortly thereafter, a Malaysian lorry driven by Loo Siew Mun (\u201cLoo\u201d) arrived. The Appellant and the four men proceeded to unload the duty unpaid cigarettes from the lorry.

The two vans were then driven up to 1 Sunview Road, Ecotech@Sunview, #08-29 (the \u201cUnit\u201d) and the boxes of cigarettes were unloaded into the Unit.', '6\\u2003 After all the boxes of cigarettes were moved into the Unit at about 8am, Loo left in the lorry.

The Appellant attempted to flee but was detained by the officers. The officers searched the Unit and found a total of 2996 cartons x 160 sticks and 6100 cartons x 200 sticks of assorted brands of duty unpaid cigarettes. Of all the duty unpaid cigarettes seized from the Unit, investigations revealed that Ann had instructed the Appellant and the other men to repack and arrange only 2996 cartons x 160 sticks and 4506 cartons x 200 sticks of assorted brands of duty unpaid cigarettes (the \u201cCigarettes\u201d) in the Unit.

{"casename":"2023_SGHC_262","fact":"'4\\u2003I turn first to the background facts that are common to all six matters before me. These matters originate from S 1270, which the respondents started against the appellant to recover funds that they had invested based on the appellant\u2019s allegedly dishonest advice and recommendation. This included the sum of US$3.45m that the respondents had allocated for various investments (the \u201cInvestments\u201d).', '5\\u2003After the trial of S 1270, Ang J decided that the respondents had relied on the appellant to manage the Investments and interface with the various investee companies. Therefore, the appellant was the respondents\u2019 only means of access to the Investments. Ang J also found that the appellant had used the respondents\u2019 funds for his own undisclosed purposes. The learned judge therefore held, among other findings, that the appellant had breached his fiduciary duties to the respondents. She allowed the respondents\u2019 claims on the following items:', '6\\u2003The appellant was thus ordered to pay the respondents\u2019 investment capital of US$3.45m, as well as interest for the period between 23 January 2014 and 11 December 2018. It should be noted that OA 152 concerns only the documents pertaining to a single item in the Judgment, that is, the Pacatolus Investment. The Pacatolus Investment comprised the Pacatolus Growth Fund Class 6 (the \u201cPacatolus Fund\u201d). In relation to the Pacatolus Fund, Ang J held that: (a) the appellant acted in breach of his fiduciary duty to the respondents, which obliged the appellant to act on the respondents\u2019 behalf to interface with the investee company, monitor the investments, and on maturity (or whenever the respondents desired), redeem the investments; and (b) the appellant was liable to the respondents in deceit as he failed to let the respondents know how the moneys would be used, and that the Pacatolus Fund was neither a bank product nor capital protected.', '7\\u2003The appellant filed an appeal against the Judgment to the Court of Appeal. In Pradeepto Kumar Biswas v Sabyasachi Mukherjee and another [2019] SGCA 79, the Court of Appeal struck out the appeal due to the appellant\u2019s breach of an unless order.', '8\\u2003Subsequently, the appellant did not take any steps to challenge the Judgment. However, the appellant did not satisfy the Judgment even as the respondents\u2019 solicitors sent several reminders for payment. The respondents finally issued the SD in respect of the Judgment debt on 19 July 2021. Following this, the appellant then commenced a series of proceedings and filed a number of appeals.', '9\\u2003Most pertinently for present purposes, on 2 August 2021, the appellant applied in HC\/OSB 74\/2021 (\u201cOSB 74\u201d) to set aside the SD. In OSB 74, the appellant argued that the SD should be set aside because: (a) the debt is disputed on grounds that appeared to be substantive; and (b) the respondents had committed perjury at the trial of S 1270 by misleading Ang J into believing that the Investments were shams. The learned Assistant Registrar Jean Chan (\u201cAR Chan\u201d) dismissed OSB 74 on 16 September 2021. On appeal, the High Court in HC\/RA 260\/2021 (\u201cRA 260\u201d) agreed with AR Chan that there were no grounds for the SD to be set aside. The court did not make any finding as to whether the respondents had possession or control of the Investments or whether the Investments had value. The court also granted the respondents liberty to file bankruptcy proceedings against the appellant after 7 October 2021, being 21 days after the decision in OSB 74.', '10\\u2003As such, on 8 October 2021, the respondents filed B 2425 against the appellant. At around the same time, the appellant filed other applications:', '(a)\\u2003On 6 October 2021, the appellant applied for a re-trial of S 1270 in CA\/OS 24\/2021 (\u201cOS 24\u201d). The Court of Appeal dismissed the application on the basis that the court lacked jurisdiction, the application lacked merit in any event, and the application an abuse of process (see the Court of Appeal decision of Pradeepto Kumar Biswas v Sabyasachi Mukherjee and another and another matter [2022] 2 SLR 340 at [93]).', '(b)\\u2003On 12 October 2021, the appellant applied for leave to appeal against the decision in RA 260 in HC\/SUM 4721\/2021 (\u201cSUM 4721\u201d). The learned Assistant Registrar Navin Anand held that assuming leave was even required under the Fifth Schedule of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1969 (2020 Rev Ed) (the \u201cSCJA\u201d), the application should have been filed by originating summons to the Appellate Division of the High Court pursuant to the Sixth Schedule of the SCJA. Therefore, he granted the appellant leave to withdraw SUM 4721.', '(c)\\u2003Following SUM 4721, on 8 November 2021, the appellant filed AD\/OS 53\/2021 (\u201cOS 53\u201d) for: (i) leave to appeal against the decision in RA 260; (ii) an extension of time to seek leave to appeal; and (iii) an extension of time to file an appeal against the decision in RA 260. The Appellate Division of the High Court dismissed the application because, among other reasons, leave was not required to appeal against the decision in RA 260 in s 29A(1) of the SCJA, and the appellant\u2019s application was filed after much delay with no good explanation. Further, on an assessment of the merits of the appeal, it was unlikely to succeed given the outcome of OS 24.', '(d)\\u2003On 10 November 2021, the appellant filed HC\/S 921\/2021, claiming unjust enrichment arising from the respondents\u2019 attempts to enforce the Judgment. The learned Assistant Registrar Gan Kam Yuin (\u201cAR Gan\u201d) struck out the application on 6 May 2022.', '11\\u2003Following the dismissal of these applications, B 2425 was fixed for hearing on 18 November 2021. However, the appellant then filed further applications to stay the hearing of B 2425. It is not necessary for me to recount all of these applications, save to say that they were largely found to be vexatious to the respondents and therefore amounted to an abuse of process. To briefly summarise, the relevant applications are as follows:', '(a)\\u2003On 17 May 2022, the appellant applied in HC\/SUM 1848\/2022 for a stay of proceedings in B 2425. AR Gan granted the stay on the condition that the appellant provides security for costs in respect of the Judgment debt. However, the appellant did not eventually provide security.', '(b)\\u2003On 18 May 2022, the appellant applied for permission to appeal the decision in OS 53 in CA\/OA 2\/2022 (\u201cOA 2\u201d). After the parties tendered their submissions on 5 July 2022, the appellant then filed CA\/SUM 15\/2022 (\u201cSUM 15\u201d) to recuse Andrew Phang Boon Leong JCA from hearing OA 2. The Court of Appeal dismissed both applications in its decision of Pradeepto Kumar Biswas v Gouri Mukherjee and another [2022] 2 SLR 1347 (at [64]), because \u201c[n]either, in [their] opinion, bore any semblance of merit\u201d. With respect to OA 2, the court awarded costs on the higher end of the relevant range found in Appendix G of the Supreme Court Practice Directions 2021 because of the lack of merit in the application (at [65(a)]). With respect to SUM 15, \u201cit did not even come close to succeeding\u201d, and \u201c[d]espite the gravity of SUM 15\u2019s subject matter, the allegations and arguments made by [the appellant] were completely unsubstantiated\u201d (at [65(b)]). The court therefore awarded costs to the respondents on an indemnity basis .', '12\\u2003On 25 May 2022, the appellant filed OA 152. As I mentioned above, OA 152 is the appellant\u2019s application for pre-action discovery of certain categories of documents (the \u201cPacatolus Documents\u201d) relating to the Pacatolus Fund. This application was taken out against Barclays Bank PLC and Bank of Singapore Limited, which are the first and second respondents in OA 152. The appellant added the respondents as parties to OA 152 subsequently.', '13\\u2003The parties then appeared before AR Gan on 7 October 2022 to proceed with the hearing of the question as to whether B 2425 should be stayed. However, 45 minutes before that hearing, the appellant filed SUM 3718 to seek a fresh stay of B 2425 pending the determination of OA 152. SUM 3718 was eventually fixed for hearing before AR Tan on 24 November 2022. On 24 November 2022, the appellant requested for an adjournment so that he could review the respondents\u2019 submissions which he had been served with within the deadlines stipulated by the court. AR Tan nonetheless adjourned SUM 3718 to 1 December 2022. Then, on 30 November 2022, the appellant filed SUM 4306 to dismiss B 2425 on grounds that, among other things, it is based on a \u201cfalse case\u201d (in S 1270).', '14\\u2003Finally, on 1 December 2022, the parties appeared before AR Tan for the hearing of SUM 3718, SUM 4306, and B 2425. AR Tan dismissed SUM 3718 and SUM 4306, and adjudged the appellant a bankrupt in B 2425. AR Tan\u2019s decisions form the subject matters of some of the matters before me.'"}

In brief, DNV\u2019s role as class is to (a) establish and maintain rules and standards for the construction of vessels; (b) establish and maintain survey rules during the operational phase of vessels; and (c) issue class certificates to confirm that a vessel satisfies the relevant rules and standards based on survey results. 6', 'These class certificates are relied upon not only by regulatory authorities and flag states, but also by commercial parties like oil majors who may wish to charter the vessel in question.', '6\\u2003Keppel in turn appointed Hanjin as a sub-contractor for the project pursuant to an agreement dated 17 January 2013 (the \u201cSub-Contract\u201d). 7', 'Hanjin was responsible for, among others, the fabrication, assembly and erection of the pontoons and lower columns of the Vessel (the \u201cWorks\u201d). The pontoons (pictured below in Figure 2) are the structures of the Vessel which are submerged underwater and help maintain the Vessel\u2019s buoyancy. The pontoons are joined perpendicular to lower columns by bracings which prevent them from splaying outwards. 8', 'The lower columns support the accommodation deck and other structures of the Vessel above the columns.', '7\\u2003The pontoons and lower columns were constructed by Hanjin at its shipyard in the Philippines. 9', '8\\u2003Under the Sub-Contract, the Works were to be completed by 30 October 2013. 10', 'However, Hanjin could not meet this deadline for a variety of reasons. In light of this, the parties eventually came to an agreement for Keppel to take over part of the Works, with the value of these works to be set off against the amount payable to Hanjin. This agreement was eventually recorded in a Protocol of Delivery and Acceptance dated 27 December 2013, annexing a Letter Agreement and Price Schedule setting out the sums payable by Keppel to Hanjin. 11', 'I will refer to these documents collectively as the \u201cSide Letter\u201d.

These defects were discovered during a routine inspection while the Vessel was docked at a shipyard in \u00d8len, Norway, operated by Westcon Yard AS (\u201cWestcon Shipyard\u201d). In short, at DNV\u2019s suggestion, the bracing stubs of the Vessel had been checked during this routine inspection by way of non-destructive testing (\u201cNDT\u201d) conducted by SolidTech AS (\u201cSolidTech\u201d), an independent NDT service provider. 13', 'Briefly, NDT refers to the testing of the physical condition of an object without affecting the object\u2019s ability to fulfil its intended function and without physically altering its characteristics; common NDT methods include magnetic testing, radiographic testing and ultrasonic testing. 14', '11\\u2003Following the inspection, SolidTech prepared a report (the \u201cSolidTech August 2016 Report\u201d) detailing its findings that there were numerous welding defects on the bracing stubs of the pontoons and other areas. 15', '12\\u2003It was at this point that Keppel first notified Hanjin of the defects. This was done by way a letter dated 24 August 2016 sent by Keppel\u2019s Project Manager, Mr Lee Shu Rong (\u201cMr Lee\u201d). The letter went further to attribute the defects to Hanjin\u2019s fabrication process: \u201c\u2026 Preliminary investigation indicates the defects to have occurred during the course of fabrication, at HHIC-Phil (Subic Philippines)\u201d. 16', '13\\u2003The Vessel was due to commence her next charter program in or around the North Sea on 31 August 2016. In view of this, DNV directed that the welding defects in the bracing stubs had to be repaired before the Vessel could proceed, given that the bracing stubs were considered critical structures of the Vessel. Partial repairs were accordingly carried out at Westcon Shipyard and the Vessel departed on 4 September 2016. 17', '14\\u2003Given the partial nature of the repairs carried out at Westcon Shipyard, leaving some of the welding defects unrectified, DNV issued Condition of Class 4 for the Vessel on 4 October 2016. This meant that the Vessel was subject to an extended monitoring and inspection regime. 18', 'Pursuant to these requirements, further NDT was conducted by SolidTech in December 2016 whilst the Vessel was operating offshore. 19', 'SolidTech produced further reports detailing its findings during these inspections \u2013 I refer to these reports and the SolidTech August 2016 Report collectively as the \u201cSolidTech Reports\u201d.', '15\\u2003From 14 December 2017 to 21 July 2018, the Vessel was berthed and dry docked at Damen Verolme Rotterdam Shipyard (\u201cDVR Shipyard\u201d) in the Netherlands for a second round of inspections and repairs. These inspections were conducted by Materiaal Metingen Testgroep BV (\u201cMME\u201d) and witnessed by representatives of Keppel, Floatel, DNV and Hanjin\u2019s Mr Moon Seung Joon (\u201cMr Moon\u201d). 20', '16\\u2003MME issued a further set of NDT reports (the \u201cMME Reports\u201d) setting out its findings following the second inspection. The MME reports detailed numerous welding defects at various locations. 21', 'However, there was insufficient time to repair all the defects at DVR Shipyard as the Vessel was due for her next charter program. Therefore, only limited repairs were carried out on the structurally sensitive areas or high stress areas of the Vessel. 22', 'On or about 20 July 2018, the Vessel departed DVR shipyard for her next charter program in or around the North Sea. The Vessel continued to be subject to certain operational restrictions and further monitoring pursuant to Condition of Class 7 issued by DNV. 23', '17\\u2003Relations between Keppel and Hanjin broke down following from the second inspection and repairs at DVR Shipyard, as the parties could not resolve their disputes over responsibility for the defects and the repair costs. Eventually, communications between the two ceased. 24', '18\\u2003Keppel thus undertook, at its own cost and expense, the remaining inspection and repairs at Keppel\u2019s shipyard in Singapore (the \u201cSG Shipyard\u201d), where it had control over the program, quality and costs of repairs. 25', 'In order to effect the repairs in Singapore, the Vessel was (after its bow thrusters had been removed) loaded onto a heavy lift vessel and transported from Europe to the SG Shipyard. 26', '19\\u2003A further round of NDT was conducted once the Vessel was brought to the SG Shipyard. This uncovered more welding defects, as recorded in NDT reports produced by Keppel (the \u201cKeppel Reports\u201d). 27', 'All repairs to the Vessel were eventually completed and deemed satisfactory in July 2019. The Vessel was thereafter transported back to Europe where the bow thrusters were reinstalled before the Vessel was redelivered back to Floatel. 28', '20\\u2003Keppel, through its efforts, managed to save its working and commercial relationship with Floatel. However, the same could not be said for its relationship with Hanjin. That has culminated in the present suit.'"}

The maximum sentence is left usually for the worst cases.  I am satisfied \nthat your killing of Umaisyah is among the worst cases of culpable homicide.  \nYou had slapped her on her face so much that she went weak; she had to sit on \nthe floor; she then stopped crying and gasped for air.  Blood was in her mouth \nand liquid came out of her mouth or nose.  She suffered from a concussive \nseizure.

It was nothing less \nthan the infliction of gratuitous violence without regard for her safety and well-\nbeing.  You did so even though she was but a toddler, defenceless and \nvulnerable, not capable clearly of being able to withstand the violence inflicted, \nand capable of little else but to cry in response to it.  She could not resist, she \ncould not fight back, she could not run away.  What you did went beyond any \nlevel of reasonable discipline; it was vicious, callous, and heinous.\n13 Against these points, what was raised in your mitigation did not help \nyou.  It is said that this was not premediated, and in the spur of the moment.  It \nmay be that the attack was not planned, but it is clear from the other charges \nthat you are a violent person, ready to strike and to hit.  The fact that you did \nnot plan to hit counts for little.  The fact that after your assault you tried to \nresuscitate her could not help you either.\n14 I am satisfied that the maximum sentence of 10 years\u2019 imprisonment \nshould be imposed on you.  I am also satisfied that you should suffer 12 strokes \nof the cane.

The agreement for the \npurchase of nickel was thus revised and executed by [DBL] and [DBM] (\u201cthe \nNickel Purchase Agreement\u201d).

[DBL] provided a signed and stamped confirmation \nthat the net principal sum of US$4,610,707.65 was due to [DBM] (\u201cthe Second \nBalance Confirmation\u201d). [DBL] similarly did not provide any statement of \naccount to support this revised figure.19\n18 Ultimately, [DBL] did not make any payment to [DBM].20\nThe Arbitration\n19 On 24 July 2020, [DBM] commenced arbitration proceedings against \n[DBL].21 The parties\u2019 pleadings were prolix and somewhat confusing.

The second defendant, Mr Cheng Ka Wai (\u201cCheng\u201d), was a director of the first plaintiff between 11 December 2009 and 1 August 2017, and was the in-house accountant of the first plaintiff during his directorship. The third defendant, Mr Chooi Kok Yaw (\u201cChooi\u201d), was a director of the first plaintiff between 10 October 2012 and 1 August 2017, and was the company secretary of the first plaintiff during that period.', '7\\u2003Having not received the promised amount, the plaintiffs now say that the sixth defendant\u2019s purchase of the AMBO Shares under the SPA was a transaction at an undervalue under s 224 of the IRDA, or its predecessor provisions in s 98 of the Bankruptcy Act 1995 (2020 Rev Ed) read with s 329 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed). The plaintiffs say that the payment mechanics of the SPA show that the sixth defendant conspired with the other defendants to cause financial damage to the first plaintiff, or to dissipate its assets to the prejudice of creditors. This includes, among other acts, the sixth defendant choosing not to conduct \u201cindustry standard\u201d know-your-client and anti-money laundering inquiries on two of the nominees.', '8\\u2003The sixth defendant\u2019s case is that its purchase of the AMBO Shares was a bona fide commercial, arms-length transaction that was not at an undervalue. More specifically, during the negotiation and implementation of the SPA, the first plaintiff was represented by reputable international counsel. This counsel had proposed the payment mechanics in the SPA, which the sixth defendant saw no reason to object to. Thus, the sixth defendant says that it made full payment and performed all its obligations under the SPA, including paying all sums required to the first plaintiff and to its nominees. This is evidenced by documents which the sixth defendant has provided in general discovery, including bank transfer advice and bank account statements. Having paid the entire purchase sum of US$10,796,784 as stipulated in the SPA, the sixth defendant says that it would be unjust to require it to pay any further sums to the first plaintiff for the AMBO Shares.', '9\\u2003Therefore, the sixth defendant says that there was no transaction at an undervalue. Alternatively, the sixth defendant also pleads that the plaintiffs have already accepted that the first plaintiff benefited from the sixth defendant\u2019s payment of US$4,375,000 to it, and the sixth defendant\u2019s payment of US$43,047 to AMBO. In this regard, the combined value of US$4,418,047 received by the first plaintiff is not significantly less than the value, in money or money\u2019s worth, of the AMBO Shares that the sixth defendant purchased at the time of the SPA.', '10\\u2003It is in this context that the plaintiffs brought the application below to amend the SOC A1 in the terms of the Draft SOC A2. The three relevant amendments that are the subject of the present appeal are as follows:', '(a)\\u2003At paras 52.1 to 52.7 of the Draft SOC A2, the plaintiffs introduce a new cause of action, alleging that all six defendants (except the fifth defendant) and Vermeulen engaged in an unlawful means conspiracy to cause loss to the first plaintiff. This conspiracy involved downward adjustments made by the first defendant and other unnamed persons in 2015 to the accounts of AMBO (\u201cAMBO Accounts\u201d). 2', '(b)\\u2003At para 52.2 of the Draft SOC A2, the plaintiffs introduce a new cause of action, alleging that the first defendant, the sixth defendant, and Vermeulen \u201cknowingly, intentionally, and fraudulently withheld from Trident Trust\u201d the fact that some of the payments in the SPA were to be made to non-parties. 3', 'According to the plaintiffs, this amounts to fraudulent concealment.', '(c)\\u2003The Draft SOC A2 seeks to join Vermeulen as the seventh defendant to the proceedings.', '11\\u2003The plaintiffs claim Vermeulen is and was, at all material times, a director of Coca-Cola Beverages Africa (which is the parent company of the sixth defendant). The plaintiffs also claim Vermeulen has been a director of AMBO since 10 November 2016.'"}

Further, at the point of termination of the Storage Agreement, there was no Product belonging to the claimant stored in the Storage Tanks at the Terminal. 44', '38\\u2003As for the claimant\u2019s case that the defendant had breached the Storage Agreement by taking instructions relating to the claimant\u2019s Product from a third party (ie, Co A) (see [30(a)(iii)] above), the Arbitrator held that the defendant had been entitled to take instructions from Co A alone. Pursuant to Art [redacted] of the Commercial Conditions of the Storage Agreement, operational communications to the claimant were to be given care of Co A. The Arbitrator found that this applied not just to the making of communications by the defendant to the claimant via Co A, but also to the making of communications to the defendant by Co A on the claimant\u2019s behalf. The effect of Art [redacted] of the Commercial Conditions was to authorise Co A to act as the claimant\u2019s agent in respect of operational communications. 45', '39\\u2003With respect to the claimant\u2019s allegation that the defendant was liable for fraudulent and\/or negligent misrepresentation in issuing the Certificates (see [30(b)] above), the Arbitrator held that the defendant had not issued or authorised the issuance of the Certificates. 46', 'Even assuming that X and Y had issued the Certificates, the Arbitrator found that they would have been acting in the pursuit of their or Co A\u2019s own interests, and thus the defendant would not be vicariously liable for X\u2019s and\/or Y\u2019s issuance of the Certificates. The Arbitrator further found that if the Certificates were issued by Co A, otherwise than through X and Y, it would be even harder for the close connection test to be satisfied. 47', '40\\u2003In respect of the claimant\u2019s allegation that the defendant had conspired with Co A to defraud the claimant (see [30(e)] above), the Arbitrator noted that the allegation of conspiracy was \u201cat the forefront\u201d of the claimant\u2019s case 48', 'and that a key part of the claimant\u2019s case involved the knowledge of X and Y being attributed to both Co A and the defendant. 49', '41\\u2003The Arbitrator did not agree with the claimant\u2019s submission that X\u2019s and Y\u2019s knowledge of the non-existent Product in the Storage Tanks was to be attributed to the defendant under the agency doctrine because the defendant had not been under a duty to make inquiry into the non-existence of the Product. In the absence of a duty to make inquiry, X\u2019s and Y\u2019s knowledge was not attributable to the defendant under the agency doctrine. 50', '42\\u2003As for the identification doctrine, the Arbitrator found that the knowledge of X and Y could not be attributed to the defendant as if they were one and the same person, such that the defendant could be deemed as having combined with Co A to harm the claimant. In this regard, the Arbitrator was not satisfied that X and Y alone were free to commit the defendant to the alleged combination; they were not the directing mind and will of the defendant with full discretion to act independently of the board. The Arbitrator also found it important to bear in mind that the conspiracy as pleaded by the claimant was alleged to have occurred at a time before the Storage Agreement had been entered into. Matters relied on by the claimant in terms of X\u2019s and Y\u2019s roles subsequent to the entering into of the Storage Agreement could not form the basis on which to infer the alleged combination at a much earlier point in time. 51', '43\\u2003As for the claimant\u2019s submission that other employees of the defendant had been privy to the alleged conspiracy and that their knowledge of the combination should be attributed to the defendant via the agency doctrine, the Arbitrator reiterated that the defendant was not under a duty to make inquiry into the non-existence of the Product. 52', '44\\u2003Further, the Arbitrator held that there was insufficient basis for any inference that the conduct complained of was intended to injure the claimant. The terms of the Storage Agreement were not negotiated in such a way as to have been intended to cause the claimant loss. Causing loss to the claimant was also not a necessary part of achieving the alleged common goal of the defendant and Co A of getting paid under the Storage Agreement and under the 1st and 2nd Sale Contracts respectively. 53', '45\\u2003As for the claimant\u2019s alternative claim in negligence (see [30(d)] above), the Arbitrator concluded that no duty of care was owed by the defendant to safeguard access to its watermarked paper and company stamp. 54', '46\\u2003Finally, as regards the claimant\u2019s claim in the tort of conversion and detinue (see [30(c)] above), the claimant relied on the Certificates to establish both title and a right of possession to the cargoes stored in the Storage Tanks. 55', 'The claimant submitted that, to the extent that the defendant was estopped from denying that the cargoes were stored in the Storage Tanks, it was liable in conversion and detinue. 56', '47\\u2003As the Arbitrator concluded that the defendant was not responsible or deemed to be responsible for the issuance of the Certificates, the Arbitrator found that there was no representation made by the defendant on which to found the alleged estoppel, upon which the claimant\u2019s claims in conversion and detinue were based. 57', 'Therefore, the claimant\u2019s claim to recover in conversion and detinue, for the barrels of Product which should have remained in the Storage Tanks, failed.', '48\\u2003In respect of the defendant\u2019s counterclaim for the unpaid storage fees (see [31] above), the Arbitrator found that there was no total failure to perform or breach of the Storage Agreement on the defendant\u2019s part. 58', 'Accordingly, the defendant was entitled to recover the storage fees due to it under the 1st and 2nd Tax Invoices in the full amount claimed. 59', '49\\u2003The net result was that the claimant\u2019s claim was dismissed entirely while the defendant\u2019s counterclaim succeeded.'"}

It was therefore unclear why \nhe would be concerned about the interests of his family only with respect \nto the Trust Portion. No evidence was led as to how he had protected his \nfamily with respect to his other assets;\n(b) Alan did not explain why he wanted Joyce to hold the Trust \nPortion when she was not experienced in investment or managing \nfinancial assets. Further, Alan was a customer of HSBC Private Banking \nand would no doubt have had access to their trust services;\n(c) it made no sense for Alan to entrust Joyce with the Trust Portion \nto protect his family when one of his stated reasons for closing the Joint \nAccount was that Joyce may have cancer and needed money;37\n(d) it is odd that Alan would protect his family without the alleged \ntrust being evidenced in writing.

It is therefore difficult to see how an oral arrangement protected \nhis family;\n(e) even worse, Alan claims that Joyce had told him in late 2017 that \nshe was afraid Mark and his children would \u201charass\u201d her for her bonus.41 \nIf so, his or his family\u2019s claim over the Trust Portion would be \nvulnerable should something happen to Joyce; and\n(f) in February or March 2020, Alan learned that Joyce had divorced \nMark,42 which would have made any assets in her name vulnerable to \nmatrimonial distribution. Yet, he made no effort to recall the trust or \nconfirm it in writing. He only sent his lawyer\u2019s demand (ie, the First \nHEP Letter) a year later in April 2021,43 and even then, took an \ninconsistent position as to what comprised the assets under the trust (see \n[23] below).\n38 Transcript (5 Oct 2023) at p 69 line 5\u2013p 71 line 7.\n39 A-1 at para 59.\n40 A-1 at para 48.\n41 A-1 at para 41(b).\n42 A-1 at para 55.\n43 A-1 at para 75.\nVersion No 1: 12 Oct 2023 (11:21 hrs)\nChan Wei Meng v Chan Lai Wan Joyce[2023] SGHC 288\n1120 Alan\u2019s counsel highlighted that Joyce had also failed to put her case to \nAlan that (a) she did not ask for additional funds from him; and (b) she did not \nsuggest holding assets on trust for him as he claimed. I disagree that Joyce\u2019s \nfailure to do so warrants the same consequences \u2013 these were positive averments \nmade by Alan which Joyce was simply denying; further, the burden was on Alan \nto prove the trust, and he must therefore put his factual assertions with respect \nto the trust, including its formation, to Joyce. He failed to do so. \n21 Alan\u2019s subsequent conduct was also inconsistent with his case on the \nTrust Portion.\n22 First, he sent Joyce a WhatsApp message dated 11 March 2021 asking \nfor the return of \u201cat least $1,000,000 that [she] took from [him]\u201d,44 which was \nplainly inconsistent with his case. Alan explained that this was a test \u2013 he had \ndeliberately exaggerated the figure so that if Joyce responded to correct him by \nsaying that the Trust Portion was only about $700,000, he would have secured \nevidence in writing of the trust; if she denied the request altogether, then he \nwould know her position.45 This explanation did not appear in his AEIC. In fact, \nin his AEIC, he referred to the message as \u201cregarding [Joyce] returning me the \nassets held under trust\u201d when that was plainly not the case.46 In any event, this \nappeared a peculiar way to test Joyce. Alan could simply have asked for the \nTrust Portion directly \u2013 Joyce\u2019s answer to this direct question would have given \nhim the same results as under the two scenarios for the \u201ctest\u201d question. In the \nevent, Joyce did not respond.

He testified that before coming to the \ndecision to ask Joyce to hold some assets on trust for him, the assets from the \nJoint Account which he planned to give Joyce were $400,000 in cash, 20,000 \nSGX shares, and 80,000 Genting shares (\u201cJoyce\u2019s Original Portion\u201d),51 which \nwas worth $670,000 at the time.52 After deciding to ask Joyce to hold some \nassets on trust for him, he added 67,500 SPH and 400,000 Genting shares to the \nassets to be transferred to her (\u201cthe Additional Portion\u201d).53 The Additional \nPortion was worth slightly more than $700,000 at the time.54 He then claimed \nthat out of the total group of assets to be transferred to Joyce (ie, Joyce\u2019s \nOriginal Portion and the Additional Portion combined), they simply agreed that \nhalf of it (without specifying which components) would be the Trust Portion.55 \n24 In April 2021, when Alan decided to issue the First HEP Letter, he \ndemanded the return of the 67,500 SPH and 400,000 Genting shares (ie, the \nAdditional Portion), rather than half of all the assets transferred to Joyce, \nbecause the value of the Additional Portion had dropped from $700,000 to \n47 A-1 at pp 187\u2013188.\n48 A-1 at p 187.\n49 A-1 at para 50.\n50 A-1 at para 81, pp 209\u2013213.\n51 Transcript (5 Oct 2023) at p 40 lines 7\u201311.\n52 Transcript (5 Oct 2023) at p 40 lines 8\u201311.\n53 Transcript (5 Oct 2023) at p 40 lines 16\u201320.\n54 Transcript (5 Oct 2023) at p 40 lines 18\u201320.\n55 Transcript (5 Oct 2023) at p 40 lines 20\u201322.\nVersion No 1: 12 Oct 2023 (11:21 hrs)\nChan Wei Meng v Chan Lai Wan Joyce[2023] SGHC 288\n13$450,000.56 Meanwhile, the value of Joyce\u2019s Original Portion had remained at \naround $670,000. He was willing to only take back the Additional Portion as by \ndoing so, he thought Joyce would acknowledge that he was absorbing most of \nthe loss in the value of the assets, and would therefore agree to return the \nAdditional Portion.57\n25 Alan\u2019s demand for the Additional Portion could be consistent with two \nscenarios \u2013 (a) a trust arrangement over vaguely \u201chalf\u201d of the assets (which in \nthe First HEP Letter, allegedly out of magnanimity, he decided to claim the \nAdditional Portion as); or (b) simply demanding back from Joyce a portion of \nthe assets which he had given her when the Joint Account was closed, which \nwould be contrary to his case. \n26 Nonetheless, I do not accept Alan\u2019s explanation: \n(a) Alan testified that he did not tell his lawyers about the actual trust \narrangement as he hoped that Joyce would accept his gesture and the \ndispute would be quickly resolved.58 It is unclear to me how telling his \nlawyers the reason for asking for the Additional Portion would have \ndisadvantaged him or delayed the resolution of the dispute;\n(b) Alan could have set out the terms of the trust as he now claims \nin the First HEP Letter, and explicitly stated that he was offering to \ndissolve it on terms beneficial to Joyce.

Instead, in the First HEP Letter, he threatened to sue \nJoyce if she did not give in to his demand;59 and\n(c) most importantly, he did not include the above explanation in his \nAEIC. During cross-examination, his response was that he knew he \nwould be asked about this at trial \u2013 this was a weak riposte given that \nthe First HEP Letter contained a clearly inconsistent demand which \ncalled for an explanation.60 \nHence, I find his account to be an after-thought. \n27 Third, on 12 February 2021, Alan met with Justin and Jamie at his \nhome.61 He testified that he told them that Joyce took $1.6m from him and that \nsome of it was given by him to Joyce for them,62 although he did not mention \nthe amount. He claimed that this was to test whether the children, specifically \nJustin, had been told by Joyce of the trust arrangement.63\n28 Alan claimed that after this conversation with the children, he wanted to \nfind out if Joyce had told Elsie about the trust arrangement.64 Hence, he sent a \nWhatsApp message to Elsie to say that he had transferred $1.6m to Joyce and \nthat this was mainly for her children.65 Again, Alan described this as a test to \n59 A-1 at p 187.\n60 Transcript (5 Oct 2023) at p 44 lines 16\u201324.\n61 A-1 at para 66.\n62 A-1 at para 67.\n63 Transcript (5 October 2023) at p 87 lines 19\u201325.\n64 A-1 at para 71.\n65 A-1 at para 71, pp 174\u2013175.\nVersion No 1: 12 Oct 2023 (11:21 hrs)\nChan Wei Meng v Chan Lai Wan Joyce[2023] SGHC 288\n15check whether Joyce had informed Elsie of the trust.66 This explanation was \nmore puzzling than the previous \u201ctest\u201d. Alan could have simply asked Elsie if \nJoyce had informed her of the trust. He claimed under cross-examination that \nhe could not do so because Joyce\u2019s children were with him at the time.67 But this \nwas a text message to Elsie, which he did not have to show, and which he did \nnot claim to have shown, the children. Further, if it was a test to see if Elsie was \naware of the trust, there would be no need for him to add the line \u201c[k]indly noted \nthat this money are [sic] mainly for her 2 kids\u201d.68 In fact, he did not respond \nwhen Elsie simply replied, \u201c[o]k noted\u201d,69 which did not address what Elsie may \nor may not have been told by Joyce. He then claimed he called Elsie about a \nmonth after the text exchange but admitted that he still did not mention the trust \nin that conversation.70 I note that he did not mention calling Elsie in his AEIC,71 \nnor was such a conversation put to her.\n29 I note that one aspect of Justin and Jamie\u2019s evidence which was not \nchallenged was that Alan had explained that the reason he was telling them \nabout the Joint Account was because he wanted them to be aware of the \nexistence of the Joint Account and the moneys therein, that the Joint Account \nwas a good investment decision, and that they should not let it go to waste and \nuse the moneys for their education.72 On his own evidence, he informed the \nchildren that Joyce had taken $1.6m from him.

He did not. Instead, the \nimpression he gave is one consistent with Joyce\u2019s story \u2013 that the assets in the \nJoint Account distributed to her were unconditionally hers. \n31 For completeness, I do not place weight on the children\u2019s evidence that \nAlan had informed them that he had a \u201csecret\u201d account with Joyce and that they \nhad agreed to close the account and split the assets \u201cequally\u201d.74 Under cross-\nexamination, they both confirmed that Alan did not actually say those words, \nand that it was an impression they formed.75 \nMiscellaneous issues \u2013 the cheques\n32 Both parties devoted some attention to certain cheques issued by Alan \nin favour of Joyce. Joyce claimed that after the Joint Account was opened, Alan \n\u201cwould periodically issue [her] cheques for [her] share of the profits under the \nJoint Account\u201d.76 In so far as this was meant to bolster the existence of the \nAgreement, Joyce\u2019s testimony under cross-examination contradicted her claim \n\u2013 she admitted that Alan did not tell her that the cheques were her investment \nearnings, and simply said that they were \u201cfor her\u201d.77\n73 A-1 at para 48.\n74 JH-1 at paras 11,13; JH-2 at paras 13, 15.\n75 Transcript (6 Oct 2023) at p 28 lines 2\u20138, p 34 lines 4\u20136.\n76 J-1 at para 39.\n77 Transcript (6 Oct 2023) at p 17 line 13\u2013p 18 line 2.\nVersion No 1: 12 Oct 2023 (11:21 hrs)\nChan Wei Meng v Chan Lai Wan Joyce[2023] SGHC 288\n1733 Alan\u2019s account in relation to the cheques was also unsatisfactory. \nCounsel for Joyce pointed to a cheque book entry recorded by Alan on 2 January \n2008 showing that $15,000 was provided to \u201cCHAN LAI WAN [ie, Joyce] \n(PROFIT ON SHARES)\u201d.78 Alan also exhibited this cheque book entry in his \nAEIC, but the \u201cPROFIT ON SHARES\u201d portion of the entry was redacted.79 His \nexplanation was that he paid the $15,000 to Joyce to compensate her for taking \ncare of their mother, Mdm Oi Joh Chan (\u201cMdm Oi\u201d), and he did not want the \ncheque book entry to reflect that purpose.80 He said that he redacted the entry \nbecause it had \u201cnothing to do with this case\u201d.81 I reject this explanation \u2013 it did \nnot make sense for Alan to record the payment to be specifically for \u201cprofit on \nshares\u201d in order to hide the fact that it was actually moneys for Mdm Oi\u2019s \nmaintenance. Any other description, or simply an omission of one, would have \nsufficed. Further, the chequebook was Alan\u2019s and it was unclear, and he did not \nexplain, why he would need to disguise the entry. The subsequent redaction of \nthe entry was also suspect.\n34 Joyce\u2019s counsel also pointed out that Alan\u2019s explanation of the origin of \nthe unredacted cheque book entry was false.82 Alan had explained that he \nadduced the redacted cheque book entry but not the unredacted copy,83 and that \nit was Joyce who had obtained the unredacted copy from previous Tribunal of \nMaintenance of Parents proceedings involving Mdm Oi.84 However, Alan\u2019s \n78 Agreed Bundle of Documents (19 Sep 2023) at p 119.\n79 A-1 at p 223.\n80 Transcript (5 Oct 2023) at p 126 line 14\u2013p 129 line 12.\n81 Transcript (5 Oct 2023) at p 130 line 20\u2013p 131 line 3.\n82 Defendant\u2019s Written Submissions (\u201cDWS\u201d) at para 14.\n83 Transcript (5 Oct 2023) at p 132 lines 3\u201313.\n84 Transcript (5 Oct 2023) at p 132 line 14\u2013p 133 line 8.\nVersion No 1: 12 Oct 2023 (11:21 hrs)\nChan Wei Meng v Chan Lai Wan Joyce[2023] SGHC 288\n18counsel subsequently explained that the unredacted copy was in fact disclosed \nby Alan, not Joyce.85 In so far as Alan\u2019s explanation appeared to be an attempt \nto cover up the fact that the redaction was done during the course of preparation \nfor this action, I find this aspect of his testimony to be suspect as well.\n35 In any case, it was unclear to me how this cheque book entry related to \nthe profits from the Joint Account investments. The Joint Account was opened \nin March 2008, after the cheque book entry which was dated 2 January 2008.86 \nJoyce claimed that pending the opening of the Joint Account, Alan had in or \naround end 2007 or early 2008 begun making investments on behalf of Joyce \nand himself jointly, pursuant to the Agreement.87 It was therefore her case that \nthe cheque book entry related to profits from these investments. But it was \nJoyce\u2019s testimony that her bonus moneys were kept in her POSB bank account \nfrom when she received them in 2006, and were not touched until they were \napplied to the Joint Account in 2008.88 Hence, the investments made by Alan \nprior to the opening of the Joint Account could not have involved any of her \nmoneys, and could not be said to have been \u201cjoint\u201d investments. Indeed, on \nJoyce\u2019s own case, the Agreement related only to assets and profits of the Joint \nAccount.89 Finally, I note that even if Alan had given Joyce some investment \nearnings from time to time (whether from the Joint Account or not), it does not \nmean that he did so pursuant to an agreement to split the assets and profits from \nthe Joint Account equally. I therefore placed no weight on the said cheque \npayment. \n85 Letter from Harry Elias Partnership to the Court (9 Oct 2023).\n86 A-1 at para 27.\n87 J-1 at para 32.\n88 Transcript (6 Oct 2023) at p 19 lines 2\u201316.\n89 J-1 at para 30.\nVersion No 1: 12 Oct 2023 (11:21 hrs)\nChan Wei Meng v Chan Lai Wan Joyce[2023] SGHC 288\n19Conclusion\n36 For the above reasons, I do not find that the Trust Portion was transferred \nto Joyce to hold on trust for Alan.

Mr Salgaocar passed away intestate on 1 January 2016 and Mdm Lakshmi has continued the action as sole administratrix of the Estate. The assets that are the subject of S 821 fall within a larger group of the Estate\u2019s assets referred to as \u201cthe Non-India Assets\u201d. 1', '4\\u2003The beneficiaries of the Estate are Mdm Lakshmi, Mr Salgaocar\u2019s widow, and four children, including Ms Purnima. Disputes arose between Ms Purnima and Mdm Lakshmi, including about the amount of information the former was given about the Estate\u2019s assets. On 13 April 2020, Mdm Lakshmi, in her capacity as administratrix of the Estate, and Ms Purnima entered into a settlement agreement.', '5\\u2003Ms Purnima subsequently alleged that Mdm Lakshmi had breached their settlement agreement and filed HC\/OS 928\/2020 (\u201cOS 928\u201d) on 22 September 2020. On 27 May 2021, Mdm Lakshmi and Ms Purnima entered into a second settlement agreement (\u201c2SA\u201d) to settle OS 928. 2', '2SA is the agreement relevant to this matter.', '6\\u2003Broadly, the bargain struck in 2SA was that, in return for Mdm Lakshmi providing certain accounts in relation to certain assets and making certain payments, Ms Purnima would not commence further litigation against the Estate until the final determination of S 821 (and any appeal arising therefrom).', '7\\u2003I start by elaborating on the obligation concerning the provision of accounts. Under cl 7 of 2SA, Mdm Lakshmi was obliged to provide an account of the Non-India Assets for the period from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2020 (the \u201cAccounts\u201d). These Accounts were to be drawn up by an independent and qualified accountant, and placed at the office of one Mr Gurbachan Singh of GSM Law LLP (\u201cMr Singh\u201d) by 1 December 2021. Ms Purnima was entitled to inspect the Accounts with advance notice given but was not to take photos, video, or audio recordings of any material and\/or information during the inspection.', '8\\u2003Ms Purnima alleges that Mdm Lakshmi breached cl 7.

Instead, it was a thin report by an accountant which purported to set out valuations of the Non-India Assets, excluding the assets which are the subject of S 821, on two dates, ie, 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2020. Ms Purnima\u2019s grievance was not that the report should have included the assets which are the subject of S 821. Rather, even for the other Non-India Assets, the report did not contain any information on Mdm Lakshmi\u2019s dealings with them between 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2020.

Under cl 4(b), Mdm Lakshmi was also to pay Ms Purnima $15,000 on the fifteenth day of each calendar month from 15 June 2021 until the final distribution of the Non-India Assets.

She had also paid the $15,000 monthly payments until Ms Purnima\u2019s allegation that Mdm Lakshmi had breached her obligation to provide the Accounts whereupon Mdm Lakshmi stopped making the $15,000 monthly payments from June 2022. In fact, Mdm Lakshmi went further to claim the return of the money which she had already paid to Ms Purnima: see [13] above. I noted that Mdm Lakshmi\u2019s position was that 2SA remains in force. 8', 'Accordingly, I ordered, among other things, Mdm Lakshmi to make payment of the $15,000 per month to Ms Purnima as damages, in so far as this pertained to overdue payments, and to continue to pay that sum monthly in accordance with 2SA.

Mdm Lakshmi described this decision as being largely in favour of the Estate. However, as Mr Jhaveri has filed an appeal, S 821 has not yet been finally determined for the purpose of cl 11 of 2SA.', '20\\u2003On 4 May 2023, the trial of OC 49 took place before me despite the pending appeal against Lai SJ\u2019s decision on the interim injunction at that time (see [16] above).

The AD\u2019s ruling interpreting cll 11 and 18 of 2SA is expressed as a final decision that binds the parties in OC 49 as well as in OSP 6, including SUM 145.', '22\\u2003The AD, first of all, expressed \u201cthe view that OSP 6 may be considered an action for breach of 2SA and may come within cl 18\u201d: Purnima Anil Salgaocar (AD) at [35]. The AD considered cll 11 and 18 to be poorly drafted and inconsistent. The AD resolved this inconsistency by holding that cl 11 prevails over cl 18 such that Ms Purnima could commence OSP 6 even if it does not come within cl 18.', '23\\u2003The AD then expressed \u201cthe view that, if [Mdm Lakshmi] has breached cl 7, [Ms Purnima] is not precluded from commencing OSP 6\u201d: Purnima Anil Salgaocar (AD) at [44]. The AD reasoned that OSP 6 relates to matters in cl 11, which prevails over cl 18, and Ms Purnima is, accordingly, not precluded from commencing OSP 6 if Mdm Lakshmi had breached cl 7.

The appellant, Mr Johnny Lian Tian Yong, and the first and second respondents, Mr Tan Swee Wan and Mr Kelvin Low Keng Siang, were business partners.

From 2006 to 2009, Tecbiz developed a software product named \u201cSolvesam\u201d. It was intended that Solvesam would eventually be owned by a company that could be listed on NASDAQ, a stock exchange in the United States. The DJ found that, given the respondents\u2019 technical expertise, the appellant was likely responsible for fund-raising, whereas the respondents were likely responsible for the development of Solvesam. In December 2010, the parties incorporated another company, Solvesam International Pte Ltd (\u201cSIPL\u201d), with the intention that Tecbiz would eventually transfer the rights in Solvesam to SIPL. SIPL was later renamed to SSI International Pte Ltd (\u201cSSI\u201d) in July 2011.', '4\\u2003The parties\u2019 relationship deteriorated in 2011. This was in part due to the spread of online falsehoods about Solvesam in June 2011, which led to the apparent risk of a lawsuit by Microsoft China. No lawsuit was eventually brought. Both respondents resigned as directors of SSI by July 2011 and sold their shares in SSI to the appellant for $1 each. Subsequently, the second respondent resigned as a director of Tecbiz in July 2011, and the first respondent resigned as a director of Tecbiz in November 2011. Tecbiz eventually ceased operations following an extraordinary general meeting (\u201cEGM\u201d) called in June 2012.', '5\\u2003Against this general context, there are three emails from 2011 that are of relevance to the present appeal.', '(a)\\u2003In an email dated 26 February 2011 (the \u201cFebruary 2011 Email\u201d) sent by the appellant to the respondents, the appellant stated that he showed \u201cour CEO the agreement between the group and myself, a personal guarantee and assurance that [Solvesam] will not fail and 100% will list, OR I\u2019ll have to be responsible and PAY back all invested amounts\u201d. 1', '(b)\\u2003In an email dated 29 June 2011 (the \u201cJune 2011 Email\u201d) sent by the appellant to the respondents, in response to the risk of Microsoft China taking legal action against Tecbiz, the appellant stated that \u201cI\u2019ll pay you for the next twenty years\u201d. 2', '(c)\\u2003In an email dated 27 July 2011 (the \u201cJuly 2011 Email\u201d) sent by the second respondent to the appellant and the first respondent, the second respondent stated that \u201cthis email confirms the completion of the sale transaction of my Tecbiz Frisman shares to [the appellant].

The issue before the concurso court was whether, in light of its effect on Perforadora\u2019s concurso, cl 15.1(g) was unenforceable under Art 87 of the LCM and contrary to Mexican public policy.

{"casename":"2023_SGHC_299","fact":"'12\\u2003Given the elusive nature of the Scheme, it is apposite to begin near its end. On Saturday, 7 September 2013, the Straits Times published an article by Senior Correspondent Mr Goh Eng Yeow titled, \u201cBlumont\u2019s meteoric rise raises concerns: Mining counter\u2019s huge gains don\u2019t square with the firm\u2019s Q2 results\u201d. 21', 'For context, the price of Blumont shares at the beginning of the second quarter of 2013 was approximately S$0.625. By the first week of September 2013, when the foregoing article was published, this price had climbed to just under S$2.00, 22', 'a more-than threefold increase.', '13\\u2003The publication of this article led Commercial Affairs Officer (\u201cCAO\u201d) Ms Eunice Yeo to lodge a police report raising the possibility that Blumont\u2019s shares may have been the subject of manipulation. This triggered an inquiry by the Commercial Affairs Department (\u201cCAD\u201d) into the matter. 23', '14\\u2003This inquiry, however, did not get far before others began expressing similar sentiments. On 1 October 2013, SGX\u2019s then-Head of Market Surveillance, Mr Kelvin Koh, 24', 'issued the following query to Blumont\u2019s Executive Director and Chief Executive Officer (\u201cCEO\u201d), Mr Hong, 25', 'using the central exchange\u2019s online announcement platform: 26', '15\\u2003Similarly, on 2 October 2013, Today published an article titled, \u201cSIAS and SGX query \u2018steep increase\u2019 in Blumont share price\u201d. 27', 'The article, by and large, expressed the same message as that in the SGX\u2019s query. 28', '16\\u2003These statements shortly preceded the most significant event connected with this matter. On Friday, 4 October 2013, Blumont\u2019s share price fell sharply from S$1.895 to S$0.88 within the first hour of the trading day. The share prices of Asiasons and LionGold followed suit, falling from S$2.65 to S$1.04 and S$1.42 to S$0.875, respectively. As a response, the SGX suspended the trading of all three counters that same day at around 10.00am. 29', '17\\u2003On Sunday, 6 October 2013 at around 6.00pm, the SGX announced that trading would resume the next day, 30', 'but, that the three counters were to be declared \u201cDesignated Securities\u201d. 31', 'This meant that BAL shares could only be purchased if the buyer had cash on hand; contra trading was not permitted. 32', 'Further, short selling was also prohibited. Shares could only be sold if the seller had the shares to be sold on hand.', '18\\u2003After these announcements were made, on the evidence of the First Accused \u2013 Blumont\u2019s lawyer at the time, Mrs Lee SF of Stamford Law Corporation 33', '\u2013 called and spoke to SGX\u2019s then-Chief Risk and Regulatory Officer, Mdm Yeo. 34', 'This conversation was held with a view to convincing the SGX to defer the resumption of trading by two days to allow traders to prepare the funds needed to trade in BAL, given its designated status. Without such buffer time, the First Accused suggested that \u201cmayhem\u201d was bound to ensue. 35', 'This request was ultimately not acceded to for reasons which were not made known. At the trial, nothing more was revealed about any such communications (on this, see [1302] below). 36', 'When trading resumed on 7 October 2013, BAL\u2019s share prices continued to fall rapidly, dropping from S$0.88, S$1.04, and S$0.875 before the suspension, to S$0.13, S$0.15, and S$0.25 by the end of that trading day. 37', 'Collectively, I will refer to the sharp price drops on both 4 and 7 October 2013 as \u201cthe Crash\u201d.', '19\\u2003Whether the foregoing articles, queries, and decisions had materially contributed to the crash that followed the crescendo which had been building since August 2012 was a matter of considerable dispute. The Prosecution\u2019s case was, naturally, that the accused persons were responsible for the Crash because they had, by their Scheme, created appearances as to the markets and prices of BAL shares which were \u201cso utterly false that, when the music eventually stopped and the bubble burst on 4 October 2013, the share prices of all three companies collapsed\u201d. 38', 'The accused persons\u2019 submissions, of course, opposed this. Assuming they were even the ones to manipulate the markets for and prices of BAL\u2019s shares \u2013 which they denied \u2013 the accused persons cited several factors, including but not limited to the articles, queries, and decisions, 39', 'and suggested that they could not be said to have caused the Crash. 40', '20\\u2003These are matters I will return to much later in these grounds (see [1299] below). For now, the salient point is that the Crash resulted in the CAD and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (\u201cMAS\u201d) launching a joint investigation into the matter. 41', 'The CAO who led the joint investigation was Ms Sheryl Tan 42', 'and her team\u2019s investigations were extensive.', '21\\u2003Following investigations, in the third quarter of 2016, the Prosecution preferred charges against the First and Second Accused. However, it should be noted that at the start of the trial, the accused persons were charged with abetting, by conspiracy, offences under s 197(1)(b) and s 201(b) of the SFA as well as s 420 of the Penal Code. They had not been charged for criminal conspiracy under s 120B of the Penal Code. It was only in July 2019, after the trial had commenced, that the Prosecution applied to amend the original charges for abetment to the Conspiracy Charges, an application which I allowed (see [1502]\u2013[1506] below). The consequences of this amendment remained contentious in closing (see [126] below) and even at the sentencing stage of these proceedings (see [1319] below).', '22\\u2003A third person, Mr Goh HC, 43', 'whom the Prosecution assessed had played a smaller role in the Scheme \u2013 was also charged alongside the accused persons. Mr Goh HC faced a total of six charges for abetting, by intentionally aiding, the accused persons in their commission of offences under s 197(1)(b) of the SFA. These six offences were punishable under s 204(1) of the SFA read with s 109 of the Penal Code. 44', '23\\u2003On 20 March 2019, before See Kee Oon J, Mr Goh HC pleaded guilty to two of the six charges he faced, with the four others being taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. The two charges to which Mr Goh HC pleaded guilty were essentially identical save that one pertained to the role he played in connection with the false trading of Blumont shares, and the other concerned Asiasons shares. As an illustration, I reproduce the charge which concerned Blumont shares: 45', '24\\u2003See J sentenced Mr Goh HC to 36 months\u2019 imprisonment for each of the two proceeded charges, which were ordered to run concurrently (see Public Prosecutor v Goh Hin Calm HC\/CC 13\/2019). 46', 'Thereafter, the trial against the accused persons commenced before me.'"}

At the time, part of the Cargo had arrived at Nhava Sheva and was due to be discharged whilst the rest of the Cargo was then awaiting transshipment at Colombo for on-carriage to Nhava Sheva. 13', 'According to the claimant, SUM 591 was taken out urgently because an Import General Manifest (\u201cIGM\u201d), akin to a customs declaration form, had been issued by the third defendant in respect of one of the bills of lading. This could result in the imminent discharge and delivery of that parcel of the Cargo to the third defendant at Nhava Sheva once the IGM was filed with the Indian customs authorities. 14', '10\\u2003The court granted the order sought in SUM 591 on 7 March 2023 in HC\/ORC 1013\/2023 (\u201cORC 1013\u201d). Pertinently, in the affidavit supporting SUM 591, the claimant undertook to bear the costs of maintaining the storage of the Cargo at the Henry Bath LME warehouse. 15', 'Equally pertinently, one of the orders made in ORC 1013 was for the \u201ccosts of such detention and preservation of the Cargo at present location to be paid by the Claimant at first instance but recoverable as part of the Claimant\u2019s claim herein against the Defendants\u201d.

By way of context, Affert, ICS, and Senfer were part of the Archean Group of Companies (the \u201cArchean Group\u201d) that was based in India. The remaining 34% of the shares in ICS was held by the State of Senegal, the Government of India, and the Indian Farmers Fertilisers Cooperative Ltd.

{"casename":"2023_SGHC_308","fact":"'3\\u2003I begin with the brief background facts. The second defendant, UHP Holdings Pte Ltd (\u201cUHP\u201d), is a special purpose vehicle that was incorporated on 23 November 2018 for investment purposes. It is beneficially owned by Hector Capital Holdings Pte Ltd, which is one of the entities under Hector Capital Partners (\u201cHector\u201d). The first defendant, Mr Vikash Kumar, is the Chief Investment Officer of Hector.', '4\\u2003Since late 2015, Hector has invested in the alternative energy industry. Then, beginning from July 2017, Hector invested in a solar energy development company in Singapore known as Entoria Energy Pte Ltd (\u201cEEPL\u201d). In 2018, Hector, through EEPL, began to consider an investment in Sun Electric Pte Ltd (\u201cSE\u201d) and three of its subsidiaries. The claimant, Mr Matthew Peloso, is the founder of SE. He has been a shareholder and director of SE since its incorporation but ceased to be a shareholder on 18 June 2021.', '5\\u2003Between January and June 2019, EEPL and SE continued discussions regarding EEPL\u2019s potential investment in SE. Eventually, on 29 June 2019, UHP, SE, and three of its subsidiaries entered into an investment agreement (the \u201c29 June Investment Agreement\u201d). Under this agreement, UHP would acquire 51% of shares in SE and three of its subsidiaries for consideration of $21,000 each, with the total consideration to the four companies being $84,000. In return, UHP would use its best efforts to arrange a further capital injection of at least US$10m in the form of a debt facility.', '6\\u2003After the 29 June Investment Agreement was signed, the claimant informed the first defendant that SE needed more than US$10m in funding. The parties agreed that UHP would provide an increased credit line of US$100m on a best-efforts basis. However, this facility would not be fully disbursed upfront, but instead in stages upon SE and its subsidiaries reaching certain agreed milestones. In return, UHP would be entitled to 80% (an increase from the original 51%) of shares in SE and its three subsidiaries. The consideration was to remain the same at $21,000 each. On 2 July 2019, the parties entered into a revised investment agreement on those terms (the \u201c2 July Investment Agreement\u201d). Then, on 3 July 2019, UHP and SE entered into a loan facility agreement that provided for a secured credit facility of up to US$100m (the \u201c3 July Loan Facility Agreement\u201d).', '7\\u2003It is important to note for present purposes that the claimant does not dispute the existence and validity of the three documents mentioned above, namely, the 29 June Investment Agreement, the 2 July Investment Agreement, and the 3 July Loan Facility Agreement. Indeed, the claimant had listed all three documents in his List of Documents that he provided to the defendants pursuant to the court\u2019s direction for the parties to exchange documents that they would be relying on in OC 179.', '8\\u2003Subsequently, as the claimant claims in OC 179, the first defendant allegedly signed an investment agreement dated 18 November 2019 (the \u201cAlleged 18 November Investment Agreement\u201d). Under this agreement, the first defendant allegedly agreed on behalf of UHP to acquire 51% of the shares in SE for a consideration of $5.15m. This forms the basis for the claimant\u2019s action in OC 179 against the defendants.', '9\\u2003Notwithstanding the Alleged 18 November Investment Agreement, on 25 November 2019, SE issued and passed the Share Application Form and Directors\u2019 Resolution, respectively, by allotting 51% of the ordinary shares of SE to UHP for a consideration of $21,000. On 27 November 2019, the shares were allotted to UHP. This allotment was supposedly done pursuant to the 2 July Investment Agreement, which provided that these forms could not be filed earlier than 1 October 2019. However, this was clearly a mistake as the 2 July Investment Agreement provided for an allotment of 80% of the shares in SE and three of its subsidiaries. The mistake arose because SE had used the wrong share allotment forms from the superseded 29 June Investment Agreement instead of the 2 July Investment Agreement. SE fixed this mistake on 23 December 2019, by issuing and passing the correct Share Application Form and Directors\u2019 Resolution, respectively, to allot an additional 322,050 of the ordinary shares in SE to UHP.', '10\\u2003On 5 August 2022, the claimant commenced OC 179. He claims for the sum of $5.15m that the defendants had allegedly failed to pay pursuant to the Alleged 18 November Investment Agreement. The claimant\u2019s pleading in the Statement of Claim on the formation of this agreement is in the following terms: \u201c[b]y a written agreement dated 18 November 2019, the [c]laimant, with the consent of the existing shareholders of [SE] at the time, and the [d]efendants agreed to a dilution of the shares in [SE] and for the [second] [d]efendant to be issued a majority of ordinary shares in [SE] for the amount of S$5,150,000.00\u201d. 1', '11\\u2003As the defendants\u2019 position is that the Alleged 18 November Investment Agreement was never signed, they issued a Notice to Produce Documents to require the claimant to produce, among other documents, this agreement. On 14 October 2022, the claimant provided an electronic copy of the Alleged 18 November Investment Agreement. As the defendants would not accept an electronic copy of the document, on 17 October 2022, their solicitors wrote to the claimant\u2019s solicitors to ask for the original document for inspection. On 18 October 2022, the claimant\u2019s solicitors replied to state that \u201c[w]e are instructed that the original wet ink version of the Investment Agreement dated 18 November 2019 \u2026 was retained by either of [the defendants] and that [the claimant] was only provided with a copy of the Agreement\u201d [emphasis in original]. 2', '12\\u2003The defendants\u2019 solicitors responded to reject the claimant\u2019s version of events. On 23 November 2022, the defendants submitted the Alleged 18 November Investment Agreement, as well as the 3 July Loan Facility (which the parties accept to be genuine), to the Health Sciences Authority (\u201cHSA\u201d) for handwriting analysis. On 24 February 2023, HSA concluded that the first defendant\u2019s signatures on both the Alleged 18 November Investment Agreement and the 3 July Loan Facility were \u201calmost superimposable\u201d with \u201cno exclusionary difference\u201d in both the length of the signature line beneath the signature and even the position of the signatures relative to the signature line. 3', 'The defendants exhibited HSA\u2019s report in their application for security for costs in HC\/SUM 597\/2023 (\u201cSUM 597\u201d).', '13\\u2003In his reply affidavit dated 18 April 2023 in SUM 597, the claimant exhibited a forensic expert report which he had obtained from Infinity Forensics. The report concluded that the first defendant\u2019s signatures on the Alleged 18 November Investment Agreement and the 3 July Loan Facility \u201caligns [sic] on top of each other almost perfectly\u201d. 4', 'The report further concluded that it is \u201cvery likely\u201d that one signature was copied and inserted from the other signature as \u201c[i]t will be almost impossible for a human to sign 2 identical signatures\u201d. 5', 'In short, the claimant\u2019s own expert agreed with the defendants\u2019 expert that the first defendant\u2019s signature on the two documents are practically identical.', '14\\u2003Subsequently, the defendants filed HC\/SUM 1656\/2023 (\u201cSUM 1656\u201d) to seek further and better particulars of the Statement of Claim from the claimant. On 10 August 2023, the claimant filed his further and better particulars, which stated, among other things, that: (a) the Alleged 18 November Investment Agreement was signed \u201cin person\u201d, and that (b) this was done either on 20 or 21 November 2019 at around 1.30pm at the office of Hector Capital Pte Ltd in the Singapore Land Tower. For clarity, Hector Capital Pte Ltd is a distinct entity from Hector Capital Holdings Pte Ltd. The claimant\u2019s version of events must also be seen in the light of his reply affidavit dated 18 April 2023 in SUM 597, where he said the following: \u201cI wish to state that I do not have the original version of the [Alleged 18 November Investment Agreement] with wet ink signatures \u2026 as it was retained by the [first] [d]efendant and\/or the [second] [d]efendant\u201d [emphasis added]. 6', 'Taken together, the claimant\u2019s case as contained in his pleadings and affidavits is that the Alleged 18 November Investment Agreement was signed by the parties physically (as opposed to electronically).', '15\\u2003On 4 September 2023, the defendants filed SUM 2670 to strike out the claimant\u2019s claim in OC 179. Among other arguments, the defendants\u2019 primary case is that the first defendant\u2019s signature on the Alleged 18 November Investment Agreement had been copied and inserted from the 3 July Loan Facility Agreement. Therefore, the Alleged 18 November Investment Agreement was forged and unenforceable. The learned AR heard and dismissed SUM 2670 on 6 October 2023. The learned AR\u2019s decision forms the subject of the appeal presently before me.'"}

Jason and David were close friends for more than 30 years. David had worked for Jason in Nam Hong Construction & Engineering Pte Ltd sometime in 2004 or 2005. Eventually, David introduced Jason to one Lian Cher Hong (Lian Zhihong), whom I will address as \u201cAloysius\u201d. Jason and Aloysius incorporated NHE, a construction company that specialised in air-conditioning works, in 2010.', '4\\u2003Both Aloysius and Jason were equal shareholders in NHE and the only directors. Notably, the directors were joint signatories to NHE\u2019s bank account.', '5\\u2003In September 2012, NHE secured a subcontract from Kurihara Kogyo Co Ltd (\u201cKK\u201d) for the \u201cSupply and Installation of Chilled Water and Condensate Drain Pipeworks c\/w Testing and Commissioning\u201d for the Fusionopolis Project (the \u201cFP Project\u201d). This contract was valued at $5.2m.', '6\\u2003In 2013, NHE faced some cash flow issues. Aloysius\u2019s father-in-law loaned $300,000 to NHE. Aloysius sought repayment of the loan subsequently. However, Jason refused as he felt that NHE needed to conserve cash to prepare for \u201crainy days\u201d. In or around the middle of 2014 \u2013 about a year and a half after securing the FP Project \u2013 Aloysius told David that NHE needed to pay $300,000 to the then Assistant General Manager of KK, Mr Ng Boon Hwa (\u201cMr Ng\u201d) for allegedly procuring KK to award the FP Project to NHE. Aloysius requested David to convey this to Jason.', '7\\u2003Unbeknown to David, what Aloysius told him was false. There was no arrangement between Mr Ng and Aloysius as asserted. Aloysius had concocted the story purportedly for the purpose of repaying the loan to his father-in-law. Aloysius approached David because David was close to Jason, and Aloysius was not. Aloysius was hopeful that David would be able to persuade Jason to agree to make the payment to Mr Ng.', '8\\u2003David conveyed the false story to Jason. Jason believed it and eventually, the appellants agreed to pay the $300,000 in two equal tranches. In accordance with NHE\u2019s internal processes, the appellants and Aloysius signed two payment vouchers for $150,000 each, and Jason and Aloysius signed on the corresponding cheques (dated 14 July 2014 and 29 September 2014) that drew on NHE\u2019s bank account. Notably, the cheques were cash cheques and the payment vouchers \u2013 payment voucher no. 2000 and no. 2149 \u2013 carried the descriptions \u201cEntertainment\u201d and \u201cContra A\/C\u201d, respectively.', '9\\u2003There was no need for David to sign the payment vouchers. However, he did so because he was the overall in-charge of operations in NHE and Jason trusted him. Unless David verified payment and signed the relevant payment voucher, Jason would not sign the payment voucher and authorise payment.', '10\\u2003The cheques were handed over to Aloysius. However, the sum of $300,000 was never paid by Aloysius to his father-in-law. Nor was it paid to Mr Ng. Instead, unknown to Jason and David, Aloysius deposited the cheques into his personal bank account and used the money for his personal expenses.', '11\\u2003In 2017, Jason made a report (the \u201cReport\u201d) against Aloysius and David to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (the \u201cCPIB\u201d). In the Report, Jason alleged a conspiracy between David, Aloysius and various subcontractors of NHE to defraud and cheat him and NHE. There were almost $2m of unpaid invoices due from KK to NHE for work that had been long completed. Yet Aloysius and David took no steps to recover this sum from KK, and instead abandoned NHE leaving Jason to manage the affairs of the company.', '12\\u2003Jason asserted that the only plausible explanation for this \u201ccompletely illogical behaviour\u201d was that David and Aloysius had conspired with KK and the subcontractors of NHE to attempt to wind up NHE before it was able to pursue a claim against KK for the $2m in unpaid invoices. He believed that the sum of $300,000 was used to further the conspiracy. It is notable that when the Report was filed, Jason was unaware that Aloysius\u2019s story was false and that the sum of $300,000 had been pocketed by Aloysius. The Report triggered investigations, and the subsequent prosecution of Aloysius and the appellants.', '13\\u2003Aloysius initially faced two charges of corruptly receiving gratification of $150,000 for the benefit of Mr Ng. These charges were subsequently amended to two charges of cheating under s 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (the \u201cPenal Code\u201d) by deceiving Jason and David into believing that NHE had to pay a bribe to Mr Ng to advance the NHE\u2019s business interests with KK. Aloysius was tried and convicted on the amended charges in separate proceedings and received a global sentence of 18 months\u2019 imprisonment.', '14\\u2003His appeal against conviction and sentence was also dismissed on 22 February 2023.'"}

Similar with the rest of the Lease Documents, the Lease Agreement contained, among other terms, a number of key characteristics.', '(a)\\u2003First, there was a no-oral modification clause, which provided that its terms shall comprise the whole of the agreement between the parties, unless varied or supplemented to by any subsequent written agreement signed between parties (\u201cNOM Clause\u201d).', '(b)\\u2003Second, the Lease Agreement did not contain any provision that would have allowed the defendant to terminate the agreement prior to the expiry of the agreed three-year fixed term.', '(c)\\u2003Third, the Lease Agreement provided that in the event that (i) any Rent or Service Charge or any other sums payable is unpaid for 14 days, or (ii) the defendant fails or neglects to perform or observe any covenants, conditions, or agreements, among other things, the claimant could re-enter the premises to repossess the premises.', '(d)\\u2003Finally, the Lease Agreement provided that the defendant was to pay to the claimant (i) one month\u2019s advance rent and service charge upon acceptance of the letter of offer (the \u201cAdvance\u201d), and (ii) a security deposit equivalent to four-and-a-half months\u2019 Rent and Service Charge (the \u201cSecurity Deposit\u201d). In this connection, it was agreed that, unless expressly agreed in writing by the claimant, the claimant is entitled to retain the Security Deposit should the defendant purport to terminate the Lease Agreement prematurely before the expiry of the agreed three-year fixed term.', '5\\u2003The parties\u2019 dispute concern whether the Lease Agreement was terminated by an oral agreement following a meeting between the parties on 10 October 2022 (the \u201cOctober Meeting\u201d).', '6\\u2003The claimant\u2019s version of events is that during the October Meeting, the defendant\u2019s representatives informed the claimant\u2019s representatives that the Viva Group no longer had the necessary capital to proceed with the leases under the Lease Documents. Since the Lease Documents did not provide for a right to early termination, the Viva Group, including the defendant, proposed that Robson could retain the Advance and Security Deposit with respect to each lease, in consideration for allowing the various Viva Group entities to terminate the Lease Documents (the \u201cProposal\u201d). While the claimant\u2019s representative listened to this Proposal, its position is that it did not accept it. Instead, immediate steps were taken to correct any misunderstanding that the defendant may have regarding the October Meeting. In this regard, the claimant\u2019s representative spoke with the defendant\u2019s Ms Evelyn Ku (\u201cMs Ku\u201d) to make clear that it had not agreed to the Proposal. However, as a gesture of good-will, the claimant would try to find replacement tenants and if it managed to do so, then parties could discuss the commercial terms of the Proposal.', '7\\u2003In the end, the claimant managed to find replacement tenants in respect of the Caf\u00e9 and Gallery Units. The claimant therefore allowed the relevant Viva Group entities to terminate the Lease Documents for those units prematurely. As such, the parties executed a deed of surrender with respect to each of the Caf\u00e9 and Gallery Units in December 2022 and January 2023, respectively (collectively, the \u201cDeed(s) of Surrender\u201d). In contrast, there was no replacement tenant willing to take up the Office Unit. Hence, according to the claimant, the Lease Agreement was never terminated.', '8\\u2003By this version of events, the Lease Agreement continued afoot. Because the defendant never paid its outstandings under the Lease Agreement, the claimant issued a statutory demand (\u201cSD\u201d) on 23 June 2023 in respect of the underlying debt to this application, namely the Rent and Service Charge for the lease of the Office Unit for the period from 1 January 2023 to 30 June 2023 (the \u201cDebt\u201d). After deducting the Advance and Security Deposit from the Debt, the amount owned by the defendant to the claimant remains $142,785.72 as on 23 June 2023. Since the SD has not been satisfied within the statutorily prescribed three-week period, the defendant is deemed unable to pay its debts pursuant to s 125(2)(a) of the IRDA.'"}

In particular, Braun was charged with offences of embezzlement through loans amounting to \u20ac210m from and\/or through the companies in the Wirecard Group to the Company in relation to the Wirecard Group\u2019s purported dealings in the third-party acquirer and the merchant cash advance lines of businesses, which in truth did not exist.

This was because the use of such Reports entailed Mr Sudesh having acted in breach of Amber\u2019s \u201cundertaking to the Court and immediate steps should be taken to remedy\u201d the breach. Later that same day, Mr Sudesh\u2019s position in his reply email was that there \u201cha[d] been no use of any [Search Order] evidence documents\u201d and the only information reported to the Authorities were \u201cfrom [his] notes on suspect conversations, suspects involved and open court documents\u201d.', '27\\u2003Next, on 14 December 2018, Amber appointed L&L as its legal representative in Suit 164 (see [10] above). As a result, L&L gained access to the online data room which stored the documents which were the subject of the Listing Exercise on 18 December 2018.', '28\\u2003Two days later (ie, 20 December 2018), the L&L team formed the view that Amber had in fact made use of some of the Documents in making the Reports in breach of the Riddick Undertaking. Mr Chew wrote to Mr Sudesh on the same day to inform him that the firm would \u201cmake an urgent application to the court for Amber to preserve and use the search order documents for the purposes of making criminal reports\u201d. There was further correspondence between L&L and Mr Sudesh on the issue of Amber\u2019s breach of its Search Order Undertaking between 20 December 2018 and 23 January 2019. This correspondence shed critical light on Mr de Souza\u2019s intent behind drafting and filing Sudesh\u2019s 29\/1\/19 Affidavit, and we deal with it in detail below.', '29\\u2003For present purposes, it suffices to note that the next event of significance was the Pre-Trial Conference held before a Senior Assistant Registrar on 23 January 2019 (\u201c23\/1\/19 PTC\u201d). This arose because the Defendants took the view that Amber had not complied with the Judge\u2019s timelines in relation to the Listing Exercise, and wanted a penal notice to be inserted at the end of a draft order for SUM 2169. The Defendants claimed that the addition of a penal notice would incentivise Amber to comply with the timelines of the Listing Exercise, and also provide Amber with notice of the Defendants\u2019 intent to enforce the Judge\u2019s order through contempt of court proceedings.', '30\\u2003At the 23\/1\/19 PTC, Mr de Souza informed the SAR that Amber\u2019s persistent failure to comply with the Listing Exercise timelines was due to the \u201csheer number of documents involved\u201d. After hearing parties, the SAR held that a penal notice need not be included in the draft SUM 2169 order to be extracted, and directed L&L to write to Pereira & Tan LLC to agree to extended timelines for the Listing Exercise, failing which Amber was to apply to the court for an extension of time to comply with the exercise by 11 February 2019. It was not disputed that L&L did not mention Amber\u2019s breach of its Search Order Undertaking during the PTC.', '31\\u2003As directed at the 23\/1\/19 PTC, L&L wrote a letter to Pereira & Tan LLC dated 25 January 2019 (\u201c25\/1\/19 Letter\u201d) to seek its consent for an extension of time for the Listing Exercise to be completed by 5 April 2019. It was also not disputed that this letter made no mention of the fact that various Search Order documents had been used in making the Reports without leave of court.', '32\\u2003Subsequently, on 29 January 2019, Amber filed SUM 484 ex parte. By SUM 484, Amber applied for orders that documents it had obtained under the Search Orders be preserved and it be entitled to use the said documents to make reports to law enforcement agencies. Mr Sudesh affirmed his 29\/1\/19 Affidavit in support of Amber\u2019s application. It was undisputed that Mr de Souza was involved in the preparation of Sudesh\u2019s 29\/1\/19 Affidavit and also personally made final amendments to paragraph 24 thereof.', '33\\u2003Pereira & Tan LLC replied to the 25\/1\/19 Letter on 31 January 2019 to agree to the extension of time sought on behalf of Amber. At the time consent was given, Pereira & Tan LLC had no inkling that SUM 484 was filed two days earlier on 29 January 2019.', '34\\u2003The hearing for SUM 484 was fixed for 13 May 2019. On 1 February 2019, L&L wrote to the court to request \u201can urgent hearing date\u201d in view of \u201cthe urgency of the subject matter of the Summons which involve[d] the potential commission of criminal offences and which necessitated it being filed on an ex-parte basis\u201d. It separately wrote to the court on 7 February 2019 to seek its approval of the extended timelines of the Listing Exercises parties had agreed to.', '35\\u2003In a response conveyed on 8 February 2019, the Judge granted Amber an extension of time to comply with the terms of the Listing Exercise in the terms sought by the parties and in view of the parties\u2019 agreement. The Judge also directed on the same day that the SUM 484 hearing date of 13 May 2019 was to stand, and Amber was to serve SUM 484 and Sudesh\u2019s 29\/1\/19 Affidavit on the Defendants by 13 February 2019. In other words, SUM 484 was to be heard inter partes.', '36\\u2003Amber served the documents on the Defendants on 12 February 2019. This was when the Defendants first learnt that Amber had used and intended to use the Documents for the extraneous purpose of making criminal reports to the authorities. Consequently, D1 and D2 filed HC\/SUM 1094\/2019 (\u201cSUM 1094\u201d) on 4 March 2019 to set aside the extension of the Listing Exercise timelines the Judge had granted parties on 28 September 2018 (see [21] above). In SUM 1094, D1 and D2 claimed that they were led to believe that Amber genuinely required more time to sort through the documents subject of the Listing Exercise when Amber was in fact stalling for time to review the documents for the purpose of reporting the Defendants to the Authorities. SUM 1094 was nevertheless eventually withdrawn by D1 and D2 on 22 March 2019 with D1 and D2 paying costs of that application to Amber.', '37\\u2003Separately, Ms Lim filed a reply affidavit in SUM 484 on behalf of herself and UrbanRX on 11 March 2019. In this affidavit, Ms Lim likewise claimed that Amber had acted in bad faith as it had misrepresented to the Defendants that it needed an extension of time to comply with the Listing Exercise because of the \u201csheer volume of the task\u201d when it was in fact preoccupied with preparing its application in SUM 484 for leave to disclose the Documents to the Authorities.', '38\\u2003Mr Sudesh filed a further affidavit dated 25 March 2019 (\u201cSudesh\u2019s 25\/3\/19 Affidavit\u201d) to respond to Ms Lim\u2019s affidavit of 11 March 2019, and Amber as well as D1 and D2 each filed written submissions on 2 April 2019.', '39\\u2003The Judge first heard parties on SUM 484 on 8 April 2019. On this occasion, the Judge directed Amber to set out how each document it sought permission to disclose to the Authorities \u201crelate[d] to the specific offences\u201d allegedly committed by the Defendants, and to consider paring down the number of documents Amber \u201cintend[ed] to use to report to the authorities\u201d. At the hearing, based on Mr Sudesh\u2019s position to L&L, Mr de Souza informed the court that in making the Reports, Amber \u201cha[d] only quoted certain WhatsApp messages and other information which they gleaned from the documents\u201d and \u201cdid not hand over any of the documents to the authorities\u201d.', '40\\u2003Amber filed supplementary written submissions on 29 April 2019, and parties returned for a hearing before the Judge on 24 June 2019. This time, Mr de Souza stated that he \u201c[did not] disagree\u201d that he had advised Amber to take out SUM 484 because it had breached its Search Order Undertaking. He also clarified that Amber was seeking \u201cboth retrospective and prospective\u201d leave to disclose the Documents, and he had yet to identify which documents had \u201calready been given to the authorities\u201d. The Judge directed Amber to file an affidavit stating which documents had already been disclosed to the Authorities, and adjourned the matter for decision.', '41\\u2003Mr Sudesh filed an affidavit on behalf of Amber as directed. This was dated 8 July 2019 (\u201cSudesh\u2019s 8\/7\/19 Affidavit\u201d). In this affidavit, Mr Sudesh explained that he had only used excerpts of ten Search Order documents in support of the Reports he had made to the Authorities.', '42\\u2003The Judge rendered her decision in SUM 484 on 30 October 2019, and furnished her full grounds of decision on 19 November 2019. By the earlier of these dates, L&L had ceased to act for Amber as L&L had discharged itself as Amber\u2019s solicitors on 4 September 2019. In short, the Judge sanctioned the retrospective and prospective disclosure of the documents pertaining to the Defendants\u2019 possible commission of offences under the EFMA (\u201cEFMA Documents\u201d) to the Authorities. She considered the potential offences under the EFMA to be serious, the materials sought to be disclosed to be cogent, and did not find SUM 484 to be motivated by an improper purpose. The Judge did not grant Amber leave to disclose documents purportedly connected to other offences (\u201cOther Documents\u201d).', 'Proceedings before the Court of Appeal', '43\\u2003Both parties appealed against the Judge\u2019s decision. L&L was no longer solicitors on record in Suit 164 and Amber was represented by Allen & Gledhill LLP. The Court of Appeal (\u201cCA\u201d) dismissed Amber\u2019s appeal for leave to disclose the Other Documents, and reversed the Judge\u2019s decision to grant Amber retrospective and prospective leave to disclose the EFMA Documents to the Authorities. The CA\u2019s judgment may be found at Lim Suk Ling Priscilla and another v Amber Compounding Pharmacy Pte Ltd and another and another appeal and another matter [2020] 2 SLR 912 (\u201cAmber (CA)\u201d).', '44\\u2003On the evidence before it, the CA was satisfied that Amber\u2019s application in SUM 484 was motivated by an improper purpose. It considered there to be no reason for Amber to have conducted a substantive review of the Search Order documents, much less disclose the Documents to the Authorities. After all, the Judge had directed parties to determine the ownership of the documents subject of the Listing Exercise using search terms. The CA further observed that there should have been no difficulty for Amber to inform the court that the circumstances made it necessary to examine the substance of the Documents before reporting to the authorities if Amber had truly been concerned about the offences allegedly committed by the Defendants. What Amber did instead was to render the disclosure to the authorities a fait accompli and thereafter take its chances to convince the court to grant retrospective leave. Amber had furthermore repeatedly represented to the court and the Defendants that its various delays in complying with the Listing Exercise were solely attributable to the magnitude of the exercise. The CA also considered it significant that Amber chose to file SUM 484 ex parte even though it was clear that the Defendants were counterparties to the action, and had also sought the Defendants\u2019 agreement for a further extension of time to complete the Listing Exercise whilst proceeding with SUM 484 on an ex parte basis.', '45\\u2003Further accounting for the fact that the Defendants had not waived their privilege against self-incrimination, the interest of privacy, and the prejudice that would be occasioned to the Defendants if they were subjected to criminal investigations, the CA denied Amber retrospective and prospective leave to disclose any of the Documents to the Authorities.', '46\\u2003In the wake of the CA\u2019s decision, the Deputy Registrar of the Supreme Court (\u201cDR\u201d) referred information touching upon the conduct of Mr de Souza to the Law Society on behalf of the CA under s 85(3)(a) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 2009 Rev Ed) via a letter dated 9 September 2020 (\u201cReferral Letter\u201d).', '47\\u2003In this letter, the DR informed the Law Society that Amber had obtained search orders against the Defendants in Suit 164 and subsequently breached the undertakings it provided the court to obtain said orders. Vis-\u00e0-vis Mr de Souza, the DR highlighted the CA\u2019s observations that he had made no mention of Amber\u2019s extraneous use of the Documents at the 23\/1\/19 PTC or in the 25\/1\/19 Letter but had, during this period, sought an extension of time to comply with the Listing Exercise on the basis of \u201cthe sheer number of documents involved\u201d. The DR noted that it was not clear whether this extension of time was sought for the purpose of completing the Listing Exercise or for reviewing the Defendants\u2019 documents in connection with the reports, and enclosed the CA\u2019s judgment for the Law Society\u2019s consideration.', '48\\u2003An Inquiry Committee (\u201cIC\u201d) was constituted on 13 January 2021. In its report dated 13 July 2021, the IC found that Mr de Souza\u2019s failure to inform the court of Amber\u2019s breach of its Search Order Undertaking at the 23\/1\/19 PTC was not borne of a desire to mislead the court and thus did not amount to a breach of r 9(2)(a)(i) of the PCR. In particular, the IC found that Mr de Souza did not disclose Amber\u2019s breach of its Search Order Undertaking at the 23\/1\/19 PTC because he believed that he needed Amber\u2019s permission to disclose the said breach to the court and had yet to obtain such permission as at 23 January 2019.', '49\\u2003The IC likewise found there to be no evidence that Mr de Souza knowingly misled or attempted to mislead Mr Pereira in breach of rr 9(2)(a)(iii) and 9(2)(a)(iv) of the PCR by: (a) proceeding with SUM 484 ex parte; or (b) by failing to inform Mr Pereira of Amber\u2019s breach of its Search Order Undertaking whilst seeking the Defendants\u2019 consent to an extension of time to complete the Listing Exercise in the 25\/1\/19 Letter. The IC considered the former to be unexceptional as Mr de Souza genuinely believed that proceeding with SUM 484 ex parte would assist Amber to preserve evidence of the Defendants\u2019 alleged crimes. In the IC\u2019s view, the latter was also unobjectionable since Amber truly required more time to complete the Listing Exercise.', '50\\u2003The IC did not find r 9(3)(b)(i) of the PCR to be relevant. This provision enjoined a legal practitioner to disclose to the court or opposing counsel every fact, item of evidence, item of information and other matter which the legal practitioner is required by law to disclose in those proceedings to the court or opposing counsel. The IC was unaware of any specific provision of law that required Mr de Souza to inform the court or his opposing counsel of Amber\u2019s breach of its Search Order Undertaking. In any event, it accepted that Mr de Souza disclosed Amber\u2019s breach of the Search Order Undertaking \u201cwhen he filed [SUM 484]\u201d.', '51\\u2003Turning to r 10(3)(a) of the PCR, the IC did not think that Mr de Souza\u2019s failure to attach the Reports to Sudesh\u2019s 29\/1\/19 Affidavit he filed in SUM 484 on behalf of Amber amounted to suppression of evidence within the meaning of r 10(3)(a) of the PCR. This was on the basis that neither the Judge nor the Defendants requested for copies of the Reports when SUM 484 was heard.', '52\\u2003Notwithstanding the above, the IC found that Mr de Souza failed to place his duty to the court above his duty to his clients because he ought, at the very least, to have informed the court at the 23\/1\/19 PTC that he had \u201cadvised [Amber] that an urgent leave application in relation to the seized documents was necessary\u201d, and did not do so. In the circumstances, the IC found Mr de Souza guilty of misconduct under s 83(2)(h) of the LPA and suggested that he be fined $2,000. The IC did not consider it necessary for a DT to be convened.', '53\\u2003The Council of the Law Society disagreed with the IC\u2019s findings. Pursuant to s 87(2)(b) of the LPA, and on 5 November 2021, it sought the appointment of a disciplinary tribunal to formally investigate Mr de Souza\u2019s conduct. The DT was formally appointed on 19 November 2021.', '54\\u2003In its Statement of Case filed in the proceedings before the DT, the Law Society preferred five charges, each with alternative charges, against Mr de Souza.', '(a)\\u2003The first charge (\u201cFirst Charge\u201d) and the first alternative charge related to Mr de Souza knowingly misleading or attempting to mislead the court and opposing counsel at the 23\/1\/19 PTC by failing to inform them of Amber\u2019s breach of its Search Order Undertaking, concealing Amber\u2019s intended ex parte leave application to remedy the said breach, and requesting an extension of time to comply with court timelines on the basis of voluminous documents when the actual reason for the extension was to review the documents subject of the Search Orders for the purpose of making further reports to the authorities. It alleged a breach of rr 9(2)(a)(i) and 9(2)(a)(iii) of the PCR.', '(b)\\u2003The second charge (\u201cSecond Charge\u201d) and the second alternative charge pertained to Mr de Souza\u2019s failure to disclose to the court at the 23\/1\/19 PTC, Amber\u2019s breach of its Search Order Undertaking and its intended ex parte leave application. This was alleged to be in breach of r 9(3)(b)(i) of the PCR.', '(c)\\u2003The third charge (\u201cThird Charge\u201d) and the third alternative charge related to Mr de Souza\u2019s failure to disclose Amber\u2019s breach of its Search Order Undertaking and its intended ex parte leave application to solicitor for the Defendants (ie, Pereira & Tan LLC) at the 23\/1\/19 PTC and when he sought the Defendants\u2019 consent for an extension of time for the Listing Exercise on 25 January 2019. This was said to be in breach of r 9(3)(b)(i) of the PCR.', '(d)\\u2003The fourth charge (\u201cFourth Charge\u201d) and the fourth alternative charge averred that Mr de Souza was a party to and assisted Amber in suppressing evidence in breach of r 10(3)(a) of the PCR because he had prepared and filed Sudesh\u2019s 29\/1\/19 Affidavit without exhibiting the Reports nor supporting documents made to certain agencies by Amber which, if exhibited in Sudesh\u2019s 29\/1\/19 Affidavit, would have revealed that Amber had breached its Search Order Undertaking.', '(e)\\u2003Lastly, the fifth charge (\u201cFifth Charge\u201d) and the fifth alternative charge alleged that in failing to inform the court at the 23\/1\/19 PTC of Amber\u2019s breach of its Search Order Undertaking and its intended ex parte leave application, Mr de Souza allowed his duty to Amber to supersede his duty to the court.', '55\\u2003The DT found Mr de Souza guilty only of the Fourth Charge. Before we elaborate on this aspect of the DT\u2019s decision, we briefly narrate its findings on the other charges.', '56\\u2003The DT found that the First Charge raised no case for Mr de Souza to answer. In the DT\u2019s view, there was no evidence that Mr de Souza failed to disclose Amber\u2019s breach of its Search Order Undertaking or its intent to file the ex parte leave application for permission to use the Documents at the 23\/1\/19 PTC because he wished to buy Amber more time to identify documents which supported that the Defendants had committed criminal offences. On the contrary, upon learning of Amber\u2019s potential breach of its Riddick Undertaking on 3 December 2018, Mr de Souza instructed his associates to stop reviewing the documents (see [25] above).', '57\\u2003In the DT\u2019s view, the Second Charge was also not made out. This was because Mr de Souza was not legally obliged to disclose to the court Amber\u2019s breach of its Search Order Undertaking or its intended ex parte leave application (ie, SUM 484) at the 23\/1\/19 PTC. Neither the terms of the Search Order Undertaking nor the scope of the Riddick principle demanded that Mr de Souza immediately disclose Amber\u2019s breach to the court. Furthermore, Mr Sudesh was not prepared to admit to any breach at this time.', '58\\u2003In so far as the DT considered the factual averments subject of the Fifth Charge to be the same as those subject of the Second Charge, it treated the Fifth Charge and fifth alternative charge as second and third alternative charges to the Second Charge. These two charges (ie, what were originally the Fifth Charge and the fifth alternative charge) were predicated on a legal practitioner\u2019s paramount duty to the court, which the DT understood as requiring a legal practitioner to make full disclosure of all material facts and circumstances to the court. The DT found there to be no breach of the paramount duty as Amber\u2019s breach of the Search Order Undertaking and intended ex parte leave application were not facts material to the 23\/1\/19 PTC. The 23\/1\/19 PTC largely focussed on whether a penal notice ought to be annexed to the draft order to SUM 2169 (see [29] above).', '59\\u2003 On the Third Charge and its alternative, the DT was \u201cdisturbed\u201d by Mr de Souza \u201cseeking consent [for an extension of time to comply with the Listing Exercise from Mr Pereira] while keeping [him] in the dark on a matter that would have affected the giving of consent\u201d. That said, it nonetheless held that the Law Society had not proved any requirement in law for Amber to make the relevant disclosures to Pereira & Tan LLC, and dismissed the Third Charge and its alternative on this basis.', '60\\u2003Returning to the Fourth Charge, whilst the DT was cognisant that this charge concerned the suppression of evidence, it considered that \u201cnon-disclosure\u201d would also engage the duty of full and frank (\u201cF&F\u201d) disclosure (and thus r 9(3)(b)(i) of the PCR) as well as a legal practitioner\u2019s paramount duty to the court. This stemmed from the DT\u2019s view that that the \u201cduty not to suppress evidence is the other side of the coin of the duty to disclose matters required by law as well as a facet of the paramount duty to disclose material facts and not to mislead the Court\u201d.', '61\\u2003With this alleged overlap in the various duties in mind, the DT then treated the \u201ckey question\u201d as whether \u201cmaterial facts that should have been the subject of [F&F] disclosure [were] suppressed\u201d. In this regard, the DT did not consider the subjective state of mind of a legal practitioner to be relevant. It held that \u201conce actual knowledge of material facts to be disclosed is proven, the question of whether there was breach of [the] duty to disclose should be considered objectively, and not based on the subjective view of the legal practitioner\u201d.', '62\\u2003On the facts, the DT found that Mr de Souza was aware that Amber had breached its Riddick Undertaking as early as 5 December 2018 and must have known that Amber breached its Search Order Undertaking at or about the same time. Going further, the DT was \u201cof the unequivocal view\u201d that Sudesh\u2019s 29\/1\/19 Affidavit did not make F&F disclosure of Amber\u2019s breach of its Search Order Undertaking. Instead, Sudesh\u2019s 29\/1\/19 Affidavit merely sought permission from the court \u201cto use some of the Documents in support of the reports given\u201d and did not disclose that documents and information had already been used. The DT thus concluded that Amber had suppressed evidence in Sudesh\u2019s 29\/1\/19 Affidavit and by filing this affidavit, Mr de Souza was a party to and assisted in Amber\u2019s suppression in breach of r 10(3)(a) of the PCR. In the circumstances, the Fourth Charge was made out.', '63\\u2003The DT found that Mr de Souza\u2019s breach of r 10(3)(a) of the PCR amounted to improper conduct and practice and constituted a breach of sufficient gravity for him to show cause before this court.'"}

Instead, Mr Ravi highlights the substantial effect his condition \nhad on him at the material time, which, in Mr Ravi\u2019s view, substantially reduces \nhis culpability.19 In this connection, Mr Ravi explains that his mental disorder is \nlifelong, and that he requires ongoing medical treatment and supervision. He \nhas been known to the IMH since 2008.20 Mr Ravi refers to the medical reports \nby Dr Yeo and Dr Lim to support the case that his bipolar disorder at the \nmaterial time was serious and is, therefore, a significant mitigating factor that \nreduces his culpability. \n22 I turn to Dr Yeo\u2019s report. Mr Ravi was examined by Dr Yeo on \n2 December 2021. During that medical examination, Dr Yeo found Mr Ravi to \n18 RWS at paras 5.11 and 7.6.\n19 RWS at paras 7.10 and 9.1\u20139.4.\n20 RWS at para 5.1.\nVersion No 1: 08 Nov 2023 (12:15 hrs)\nAG v Ravi s\/o Madasamy[2023] SGHC 321\n12be exhibiting pressured speech, flight of ideas, and an abnormal, persistent and \nirritable mood. Dr Yeo further observed that Mr Ravi exhibited grandiose \nbeliefs and was excessively talkative and disparaging of others.21 In Dr Yeo\u2019s \nprofessional opinion, he concluded:22\n4. [Mr Ravi] was assessed clinically to be in a Hypomanic \nEpisode of Bipolar Disorder. This is a distinct period of \nabnormally and persistently elevated and irritable mood \nassociated with persistently increased activity and energy \nlevels. Though the episode is not severe enough to necessitate \nadmission to hospital, he clearly showed some impairment in \nhis social occupational functioning and it was clearly a \nnoticeable change from his usual behaviour.\n\u2026\n6. Based on the information made available to me and my \nassessment of the subject on 02\/12\/2021, I am of the \nconsidered opinion that at this juncture, the subject is \nmentally unwell due to a relapse of his bipolar disorder. \nThis would adversely affect his ability to conduct himself \nprofessionally and adequately in his work as an advocate \nand solicitor.

As Mr Ravi felt that Lim J \nwas rude towards him, he became angry and was unable to hold back, leading \n21 Dr Yeo\u2019s report dated 6 December 2021 at para 3.\n22 Dr Yeo\u2019s report dated 6 December 2021 at paras 4 and 6.\nVersion No 1: 08 Nov 2023 (12:15 hrs)\nAG v Ravi s\/o Madasamy[2023] SGHC 321\n13to him accusing Lim J of being biased.23 Dr Lim concluded her report by stating \nher professional opinion:24\n33. I am of the opinion that:\na. [Mr Ravi] has a Bipolar Disorder and was in \nrelapse at the time of the alleged offences.\nb. During the timeframe (November 2021 onwards) \nwhere the alleged offence was committed, [Mr Ravi] \nexperienced hypomanic symptoms as reported by \nhimself and family members. These symptoms \ncontinued to be present and were also observed by his \nDoctor (Dr. Derrick Yeo) in the IMH Outpatient clinic on \n2nd December 2021 where he was assessed to be in \nrelapse of his Bipolar disorder with prominent \nhypomanic symptoms.\nTherefore, there is a contributory link to the alleged \ncharges as he was in relapse of his bipolar disorder, \ndisplaying flight of ideas, pressured speech and \nirritability during this time frame which contributed to \nhis demeanor in court leading to contempt in court and \nconduct issues in his behavior. \n\u2026\n[emphasis added in bold italics]\n24 In arriving at this opinion, Dr Lim explained that she had relied on the \nfollowing sources of information: (a) her examinations of Mr Ravi on the two \noccasions in June 2022, which appeared to consist largely of self-reporting; (b) \ncorroborative evidence from Mr Ravi\u2019s sister as to Mr Ravi\u2019s observed \nbehaviour during the period of early November 2021; (c) the medical reports by \nMr Ravi\u2019s previous doctors, including Dr Yeo\u2019s report dated 6 December 2021; \n(d) the charge sheet of the index offence; and (e) the report and summary of \nfacts by the investigating officer.25\n23 Dr Lim\u2019s report dated 28 June 2022 at paras 23 and 24.\n24 Dr Lim\u2019s report dated 28 June 2022 at paras 33(a) and 33(b).\n25 Dr Lim\u2019s report dated 28 June 2022 at para 3.\nVersion No 1: 08 Nov 2023 (12:15 hrs)\nAG v Ravi s\/o Madasamy[2023] SGHC 321\n1425 Mr Ravi contends that if his bipolar disorder at the material time was not \nserious, Dr Yeo would not have indicated in his report that if Mr Ravi\u2019s \nhypomania did not improve with the change in medication he prescribed, \nDr Yeo would recommend that Mr Ravi be hospitalised.26 Mr Ravi also says \nthat, while he was not hospitalised, he had had to suspend his practice as an \nadvocate and solicitor, and argues that this is an indication that his symptoms \ndid in fact seriously disrupt his occupational functioning at the material time.27 \nThis is by virtue of the fact that following Dr Yeo\u2019s examination, Mr Ravi had \nto cease his practice because, in Dr Yeo\u2019s opinion, he was unable to conduct \nhimself appropriately as a legal professional. Indeed, Dr Yeo opined, inter alia, \nthat Mr Ravi\u2019s condition carried a potential risk of harm to Mr Ravi and his \nclients. Accordingly, the AG\u2019s claim that there is little evidence to suggest that \nMr Ravi\u2019s mental condition affected his capacity to exercise self-control and \nrestraint is untenable.28 \n26 To sum up, Mr Ravi takes issue with the AG\u2019s position (at [ 18]\u2013[ 19] \nabove) on the following grounds:29\n(a)  First, the AG\u2019s position is taken without the support of any \nmedical authority or expert.\n(b) Second, the AG\u2019s assertion is contradicted by two medical \ndoctors, namely, Dr Yeo and Dr Lim, who have set out the hypomanic \nsymptoms that Mr Ravi exhibited.\n26 RWS at para 7.2.\n27 RWS at para 7.5.\n28 RWS at para 7.6.\n29 RWS at paras 7.6\u20137.7.\nVersion No 1: 08 Nov 2023 (12:15 hrs)\nAG v Ravi s\/o Madasamy[2023] SGHC 321\n15(c) Third, the AG\u2019s assertion is at odds with its own acceptance that \nMr Ravi\u2019s bipolar disorder had a contributory link to his contemptuous \nacts.30\n(d) Fourth, the AG\u2019s submission ignores Dr Yeo\u2019s recommendation \nto the Law Society in December 2021 that Mr Ravi should cease \npractising as a lawyer immediately until his symptoms were under \ncontrol. \n(e) Fifth, the AG\u2019s argument appears to be based solely on the fact \nthat the reports of Dr Yeo and Dr Lim did not expressly use the words \n\u201csubstantial diminution in self-control\u201d in describing the effects of \nMr Ravi\u2019s bipolar disorder on him at the material time.\n(f) Sixth, the AG\u2019s submission demonstrates a poor understanding \nof bipolar disorder. For instance, the AG wrongly referred to the \ndecision of the Disciplinary Tribunal in Ravi DT (2015) to illustrate that \nMr Ravi\u2019s mental condition in 2015 was much more serious than that at \nthe material time in 2021. In reality, the symptoms exhibited by Mr Ravi \nin 2015, which led the Disciplinary Tribunal in Ravi DT (2015) to \nconclude that his ability to make rational judgments was impaired, were \nall present during the material time in 2021.\n27 Following from Mr Ravi\u2019s position that his culpability was reduced by \nvirtue of his serious and contributory bipolar disorder, Mr Ravi says that the \nweight to be accorded to the sentencing principle of deterrence, both general \nand specific, must necessarily be reduced.31\n30 See AWS at paras 13 and 17. \n31 RWS at paras 9.1\u20139.4.\nVersion No 1: 08 Nov 2023 (12:15 hrs)\nAG v Ravi s\/o Madasamy[2023] SGHC 321\n1628 In my judgment, while I agree that Mr Ravi\u2019s bipolar disorder had a \ncontributory link to his conduct, I am unable to accept that Mr Ravi\u2019s culpability \nfor his contemptuous acts is significantly reduced by virtue of his bipolar \ndisorder. To begin with, neither medical report expressly concludes that there \nwas a substantial diminution in Mr Ravi\u2019s ability to exercise self-control at the \nmaterial time (see [ 22] and [ 23] above). I observe that, on the one hand, Mr Ravi \ntakes issue with the AG\u2019s reliance on the fact that the medical reports did not \nuse the words \u201csubstantial diminution in self-control\u201d to support the position \nthat his bipolar disorder was not serious.32 Yet, on the other hand, Mr Ravi is \nalso seeking to draw a conclusion (ie, that his bipolar disorder substantially \ncontributed to his offending conduct) that was not expressly stated in the \nreports.33 I reiterate that Dr Lim\u2019s finding was simply that there was a \n\u201ccontributory link between the alleged charges as he was in relapse of bipolar \ndisorder\u201d. \n29 I also note that, at the material time, Mr Ravi\u2019s license was conditional \nupon his mental fitness to practise. Indeed, Dr Yeo\u2019s report was drawn up in \nresponse to the Law Society\u2019s query as to whether Mr Ravi was medically fit to \npractise as an advocate and solicitor. This explains why Dr Yeo had to caution \nthat Mr Ravi posed a potential risk of harm to himself and his clients should he \ncontinue with his professional practice. I also note that Dr Yeo stated that the \nepisode was not severe enough to necessitate admission, but that there remained \na possibility that he would recommend that Mr Ravi be warded should his \ncondition fail to improve upon review.34 \n32 RWS at para 7.6(v).\n33 RWS at para 6.2 and 7.6.\n34 Dr Yeo\u2019s report dated 6 December 2021 at paras 4 and 7.\nVersion No 1: 08 Nov 2023 (12:15 hrs)\nAG v Ravi s\/o Madasamy[2023] SGHC 321\n1730 However, in my view, such aspects of Dr Yeo\u2019s report do not have the \neffect that Mr Ravi hopes to produce. Dr Yeo\u2019s report had not been directed \ntowards Mr Ravi\u2019s ability to control or understand the consequences of his \nactions which would be relevant to the issue of culpability. Dr Yeo\u2019s opinion \nwas that Mr Ravi was unfit to practise law, and that Mr Ravi might have to be \nadmitted for a period of treatment at IMH should his condition not improve. \nThat Mr Ravi was unfit to practise law (a professional practice which imposes \nexacting demands), and the possibility that he might require inpatient treatment \nupon review, simply do not suffice to support a conclusion that Mr Ravi\u2019s \ncapacity to exercise self-control at the material time was in fact substantially \nimpaired. \n31 I should add that it is undisputed that Mr Ravi has a history of bipolar \ndisorder (Mr Ravi was admitted to the IMH on no less than four occasions over \nthe years).35 Further, Mr Ravi was previously suspended as a practising lawyer \nas a result of his non-compliance with medical treatment.36 He recognised that \n\u201cpersons suffering from bipolar disorder must seek treatment and management \nof their condition\u201d and \u201c[o]therwise, it is only a matter of time before a \nhypomanic or manic episode occurs\u201d.37 Accordingly, Mr Ravi was amply aware \nof the importance of paying close attention to his mental health, as he undertook \nhis duties and responsibilities as a practising lawyer. This he did not do. Despite \nbeing aware of his mental condition and the need for proper management of his \ncondition in light of his profession, it would seem that Mr Ravi did little to guard \nagainst the effects of his bipolar disorder, or to manage them should things go \nawry. First, Mr Ravi admitted to being non-compliant with his medication \n35 Dr Lim\u2019s report dated 28 June 2022 at para 13.\n36 Dr Lim\u2019s report dated 28 June 2022 at para 9.\n37 RWS at para 7.2.\nVersion No 1: 08 Nov 2023 (12:15 hrs)\nAG v Ravi s\/o Madasamy[2023] SGHC 321\n18regime around the time, specifically, that he had \u201c[forgotten] to take \nmedications on some days\u201d.38 Second, Mr Ravi knew that his actions on \n9 November 2021 (which form the subject matter of the Second to Fourth \nInstances of contempt) were wrong, or at least earned the strong disapprobation \nof the judge in question. Yet, Mr Ravi saw it fit to return the next morning to \nproffer more insults that were similar in nature to those made the day before \nagainst DJ Chay before walking out of the courtroom. Third, despite having \nmade disparaging actions towards DJ Chay, Mr Ravi failed to seek any \nprofessional intervention or stop his practice following the proceedings before \nDJ Chay. Instead, he decided to continue practising and appear before Lim J \nless than two weeks later, leading to the commission of more acts of contempt. \n32 At the end of the day, I recognise, as supported by the medical reports, \nthat Mr Ravi\u2019s bipolar disorder had a contributory link to his conduct. Thus, I \nrely on them to reach the view that Mr Ravi\u2019s bipolar disorder contributed to his \noffending conduct and affected his capacity to exercise self-control at the \nmaterial time. However, I do not agree that Mr Ravi\u2019s bipolar disorder was so \nserious at the material time that it substantially impaired his capacity to exercise \nself-control and appreciate the nature and wrongfulness of his conduct. Further, \ngiven Mr Ravi\u2019s repeated failures to comply with his treatment regime and take \nother steps to guard against relapses discussed above at [ 31], it is difficult to \nmake much of his complaint about any alleged unfairness arising from the \nunavailability of the MTO in respect of the contemptuous acts (see [ 13] above). \nEven if I were to take Mr Ravi\u2019s argument on the unavailability of the MTO at \nits highest, suitability for treatment and likelihood of compliance are relevant \nfactors in determining whether an MTO ought to be made: see ss 339(3)(b) and \n339(5)(a) of the CPC. In fact, in light of Mr Ravi\u2019s history dealing with his \n38 Dr Lim\u2019s report dated 28 June 2022 at para 29.\nVersion No 1: 08 Nov 2023 (12:15 hrs)\nAG v Ravi s\/o Madasamy[2023] SGHC 321\n19bipolar disorder, it seems to me that the sentencing principle of deterrence, both \ngeneral and specific, remains relevant. Accordingly, at best, I would only accord \nmoderate weight to this factor. \nStanding as a senior lawyer  \n33 The second area concerns Mr Ravi\u2019s standing as a senior lawyer. \nAccording to the AG, Mr Ravi\u2019s culpability is high as he was a senior lawyer at \nthe material time. Under r 9(1)(a) of the Legal Profession (Professional \nConduct) Rules 2015 (\u201cLP(PC)R\u201d), a legal practitioner is duty bound to \u201cassist \nin the administration of justice, and must act honourably in the interests of the \nadministration of justice\u201d. By his conduct, Mr Ravi has breached this and other \nduties imposed on legal practitioners.39 In particular, with respect to Mr Ravi\u2019s \nunfounded allegations against both DJ Chay and Lim J in open court while \ncarrying out his professional duties, they would carry greater weight as \ncompared to if similar allegations had been made by a lay person, consequently \nundermining public confidence in the administration of justice to a greater \ndegree.40  \n34 On the other hand, Mr Ravi\u2019s position is that while particular duties were \nreposed in him as an advocate and solicitor, the mere fact that he was a lawyer \nat the material time cannot ipso facto be an aggravating factor when he is being \nsentenced for contempt. The primary purpose of the AJPA is to safeguard the \nadministration of justice and not to punish legal practitioners for breaches of \ntheir professional duties. Subjecting Mr Ravi to a heavier penalty for contempt \n39 See eg, AWS at paras 24 and 38.\n40 See AWS at paras 24 and 51.\nVersion No 1: 08 Nov 2023 (12:15 hrs)\nAG v Ravi s\/o Madasamy[2023] SGHC 321\n20because his actions constituted a breach of professional conduct rules would \nalso amount to double punishment.41 \n35 I accept that the purpose of the AJPA is not to punish legal practitioners \nfor breach of their professional duties per se. However, I disagree with \nMr Ravi\u2019s claim that his status as a senior lawyer ought not to be considered as \nrelevant. As Mr Ravi acknowledges, the AJPA safeguards the administration of \njustice. On that score, lawyers have a duty to assist in administration of justice. \nThus, in discharging their professional duties, lawyers are held to high standards \n\u2013 standards not imposed on laypersons. When a lawyer commits contempt, \neffectively failing to safeguard the administration of justice, it is surely an \naggravating circumstance. In particular, as the AG points out, in respect of \nMr Ravi\u2019s allegations in open court, those would have carried more weight than \nif made by a layperson, thereby posing a greater risk to public confidence in the \nadministration of justice.

As he felt Roger was not forthcoming with information, Victor began to distrust him. 23', '19\\u2003Eventually, Eugene and David refused to cause FHS to be mortgaged to raise the Mortgaged Sum, and Victor and David decided to part ways with Roger.

The defendants disputed this and argued that the plaintiff freely intended to make an inter vivos gift to the second defendant.

An additional 400,000 shares in the third defendant were also issued, which were never offered to the plaintiff, and both of these actions were in breach of the third defendant\u2019s articles of association. Further, the first and second defendants, as directors of the third defendant, chose to pay a large amount of directors\u2019 remuneration for the financial year 2012 without the concurrent declaration of any dividends, thus preferring the directors\u2019 interests at the expense of shareholders.

In addition, the plaintiff sought an order for KPMG to take into account the findings from the RPT Review in its valuation exercise and valuation report.

These charges read as follows:', '19\\u2003DJ Ng referred to the sentencing frameworks and guidance set out in Yap Ah Lai and Pang Shuo on the relevant sentencing considerations for Customs Act offences involving cigarette smuggling.

Bhawal had also admitted to making past deliveries of boxes containing duty unpaid cigarettes under Lo Ta\u2019s instructions.', '21\\u2003Based on these considerations, DJ Ng calibrated the appropriate sentence at 40 weeks\u2019 imprisonment for the Excise Duty Charge. Given that Bhawal was in remand for seven weeks before he was released on bail, DJ Ng adjusted Bhawal\u2019s sentence downwards from 40 weeks to 33 weeks\u2019 imprisonment. A sentence of ten weeks\u2019 imprisonment was imposed for the GST Charge and this was ordered to run concurrently for a global sentence of 33 weeks\u2019 imprisonment.', '22\\u2003Bhawal applied to defer the commencement of his sentence to 13 June 2023.

There was no direct contract between Marchand and Olam. After the voyage had been performed under the Voyage Charter, there was demurrage incurred under the Voyage Charter. Following negotiations, Olam and Sinco agreed on or around 21 December 2022 that the sum due under the Voyage Charter was US$190,112 (being demurrage in the sum of US$192,812 less dunnage and hold cleaning in the sum of US$2,700). It was undisputed that Olam therefore owed the sum of US$190,112 to Sinco under the Voyage Charter. 3', '7\\u2003On 11 January 2023, Marchand issued a notice of exercise of the Clause 18 lien to Olam (the \u201c11 January 2023 Notice\u201d), with Sinco in the loop. The 11 January 2023 Notice informed Olam that Sinco was in breach of the terms of the Charterparty by failing to pay hire due and owing to Marchand, as well as set out the amount claimed by Marchand from Sinco. It expressly referred to, and set out the entirety of, Clause 18, and instructed Olam to \u201ctreat this message as Notice of Lien over any balance of freight(s) and\/or hire(s) and\/or demurrage due\u201d. Marchand requested that Olam confirm the amounts due from Olam to Sinco, and to arrange for payment of the said amounts to Marchand, not to Sinco. Olam was warned that Marchand reserved the right to recover these amounts from Olam, should Olam fail to take heed of the 11 January 2023 Notice by making payment to Sinco. 4', 'It was not disputed that the 11 January 2023 Notice was formally valid and had been issued to Olam before Olam made payment of the US$190,112. However, Sinco informed Olam: (a) that Sinco objected to Marchand\u2019s exercise of the lien; (b) that no sums were due and owing under the Charterparty; and (c) that Olam was to pay the US$190,112 owed to Sinco, not to Marchand. 5', '8\\u2003Olam was therefore faced with two competing claims from Marchand and Sinco. Olam informed Marchand that, in order to avoid the risk of having to pay twice, Olam would hold onto the moneys and make payment in accordance with any agreement subsequently reached between Marchand and Sinco. No agreement materialised. Olam also offered to pay the US$190,112 into escrow pending resolution of the dispute between Marchand and Sinco. 6', 'Despite Olam\u2019s efforts to reach an amicable resolution, Marchand commenced OA 138 and claimed against Olam for payment of the US$190,112. Subsequently, Sinco was added as a party to these proceedings on 21 April 2023.

The High Court held that it had no jurisdiction to hear and determine OS 355 (see Mohamed Shariff Valibhoy and others v Arif Valibhoy [2016] 2 SLR 301 at [97]\u2013[98]).', '5\\u2003In May 2016, the OETs filed a complaint to MUIS to seek the Applicant\u2019s removal as a trustee of the VCT, alleging unreasonable conduct on the part of the Applicant in managing the trust. 5', 'In October 2016, the Applicant filed a cross-complaint against the OETs seeking their removal as trustees of the VCT, alleging \u201cserious breaches\u201d of duties and \u201cnumerous instances of mismanagement of the VCT\u201d by the OETs. 6', 'In accordance with MUIS\u2019 wakaf dispute resolution framework, MUIS referred the Applicant and the OETs to mediation which the parties attended in January 2018. When the mediation proved unsuccessful, both complaints were referred to an Inquiry Committee constituted by MUIS. 7', 'Both sides were represented by counsel and filed affidavits and submissions for the inquiry, and counsel made oral arguments during the hearing on 12 December 2018. There was no cross-examination of witnesses. 8', '6\\u2003Following the hearing, the Inquiry Committee provided its findings and recommendations to the Council of MUIS (\u201cthe Council\u201d). 9', 'On 12 June 2019, MUIS informed the Applicant and the OETs that the Council had deliberated on the matter and directed that (a) the parties were to \u201ccollectively submit to [MUIS] an agreed operating protocol on the responsibilities, decision-making processes, and communication protocols between them for the management of the [VCT]\u201d (\u201cAgreed Operating Protocol\u201d) and (b) \u201cneither side [was] to claim any of their legal or other costs\u201d for the wakaf dispute resolution proceedings from the assets of the VCT (\u201cthe Costs Decision\u201d). 10', '7\\u2003The Applicant and the OETs could not agree on an Agreed Operating Protocol despite extensions of time being granted.

He argued that MUIS ought to have decided on the complaint or invited the Applicant to show cause, rather than to circumvent the need to do so by asking parties for an Agreed Operating Protocol; such a request was irrational in the light of the relationship between the trustees. At the hearing for leave on 20 March 2023, the OETs were on a watching brief but had not similarly applied for leave because they were willing to abide by the MUIS Decisions in the event that leave was not granted.', '9\\u2003A point argued at the leave hearing, because the OETs were not party to the leave application, was whether, without the OETs being joined, orders specific to the Applicant could be granted to him. Citing various precedents, the Applicant\u2019s argument was that the MUIS Decisions were severable in respect of the individual trustees. In these grounds of decision, the term \u201cseverability\u201d is used in the same meaning employed by the Applicant, to refer to a decision being applicable to an individual trustee in contrast to the four trustees as a whole. The Applicant\u2019s argument was that the MUIS Decisions could be quashed in a manner specific to him; in the event that they could not, the proceedings would then be dismissed. The issue as to whether the MUIS Decisions are severable is a proper one for the substantive stage of these proceedings. Regarding the leave threshold of reasonable suspicion, I agreed the threshold was met. An extension of time and leave was granted for judicial review of the Costs Decision because that decision was related to the dispute, for which the Removal Decision marked the end of a process of negotiation between MUIS and the four trustees in the context of their ongoing litigation. The Removal Decision would be before the court in any event and the Costs Decision was an integral aspect of that Decision.', '10\\u2003The Applicant accordingly filed HC\/SUM 1155\/2023 (\u201cSUM 1155\u201d) on 20 April 2023 for the following:', '(a)\\u2003A quashing order against MUIS\u2019 decision to remove the Applicant as a trustee of the VCT.', '(b)\\u2003A quashing order against MUIS\u2019 decision not to allow the Applicant to claim legal or other costs incurred in the dispute resolution proceedings before MUIS from the assets of the VCT.', '(c)\\u2003A declaration that the Applicant\u2019s legal costs and disbursements on an indemnity basis in respect of the dispute resolution proceedings be reimbursed from the VCT.', 'He did not serve any papers on the OETs despite their request that he do so. 12', '11\\u2003On 5 June 2023, the OETs filed SUM 1671 seeking, inter alia, (a) an order for the papers to be served on them (\u201cthe service issue\u201d); and (b) an order that they were to be made parties to the proceedings or were alternatively allowed to participate as non-parties (\u201cthe joinder issue\u201d).', '12\\u2003When SUM 1671 first came on for hearing on 31 August 2023, the OETs explained that they were unable to submit on the manner in which they were to be joined as they had not yet been served, although they were clear that they wished to be joined as parties.

{"casename":"2023_SGHC_342","fact":"'4\\u2003I begin with the background, as framed by the Liquidators, to the present applications. I emphasise that my citation of the background facts is restricted to the purposes of the present applications only.', '5\\u2003From around January 2016 to around April 2020, EAM purported to purchase quantities of London Metal Exchange (\u201cLME\u201d) Nickel Grade Metal (\u201cPoseidon Nickel\u201d) from an Australian company, Poseidon Nickel Limited. In particular, EAM purported to have purchased Poseidon Nickel at a 16% to 25% discount compared to the average of the LME nickel official daily cash settlement prices for the month prior to the month when shipment was scheduled. EAM then purported to sell Poseidon Nickel to third party buyers at a higher price.', '6\\u2003By virtue of the above purported arrangements, Investors stood to earn a cut of the profit by entering into a LOA with EAM. Under the terms of the LOA, each Investor would pay an investment amount to EAM to be used \u201csolely for investment in LME Nickel Grade Metal\u201d or \u201csolely for investment in LME Grade Nickel Concentrates\u201d for a three-month period. 2', 'However, in certain cases, Investors could commit to multiple, consecutive three-month tranches upfront. Upon the maturity date of the LOA, the Investor would be entitled to a return of the \u201cInvestment Amount\u201d, which is the Investor\u2019s original principal amount plus any \u201cAppreciation, net of any Commission, Shipping and Insurance costs and Hedging costs\u201d. 3', 'Investors could then decide whether to fully or partially withdraw their returns or reinvest their returns under a new LOA.', '7\\u2003On 19 March 2020, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (\u201cMAS\u201d) placed EAM on its Investor Alert List. MAS did this to \u201chighlight that EAM may have been wrongly perceived as being licensed by MAS\u201d. 4', 'According to a statement that MAS released at the material time, it had \u201creceived public feedback that EAM had told [Investors] that it was in the process of applying for a license from MAS, when in fact no such application had been submitted\u201d. 5', '8\\u2003Following the actions taken by MAS, the Envy Companies were restructured. From around April 2020, EAM\u2019s business of purported nickel trading was transferred to EGT. Thereafter, Investors who invested in the purported nickel trading did so by way of RPAs instead of LOAs. Under the terms of the RPAs, the Investor would directly purchase a proportion of the receivables that EGT was purportedly entitled to receive under a Forward Contract with a third-party buyer at a certain \u201cSale Price\u201d. The Investor would profit from the difference between the \u201cSale Price\u201d and the proportion of the receivables that the Investor is entitled to. In addition, Investors had to be accredited investors (\u201cAI\u201d) as defined in the Securities and Futures Act 2001 (2020 Rev Ed) before they could continue investing in the purported nickel trading.', '9\\u2003However, since not all of the Investors qualified as an AI, several Investors reinvested purported returns from their LOAs\/RPAs through accounts other than their personal investment accounts with the Envy Companies. These primarily took place through: (a) the investment account of a third-party AI; and\/or (b) a joint account with another Investor (\u201cJoint Account\u201d). Some of the Investors would reinvest their purported returns by means other than their personal investment accounts (with the Envy Companies) through other third parties such as family members, and may claim beneficial interest over those investments.', '10\\u2003On 22 March 2021, the Commercial Affairs Department announced that it had preferred charges against the Envy Companies\u2019 key person, Mr Ng Yu Zhi (\u201cNYZ\u201d), for cheating and fraudulent trading. On 15 April 2021, the Envy Companies filed applications to place themselves under judicial management. Interim judicial managers (\u201cIJMs\u201d) were appointed over the Envy Companies on 27 April 2021. The IJMs were tasked with, among other things, preparing a report on the financial position of the Envy Companies, along with their views on the prospects of the objectives of judicial management being achieved.', '11\\u2003On 25 May 2021, the IJMs issued the Interim Judicial Managers\u2019 Report (the \u201cInterim Report\u201d). The IJMs found that \u201cthe Companies\u2019 [p]urported [n]ickel [t]rading was non-existent, and documents presented to [them] in support of the [p]urported [n]ickel [t]rading were forgeries\u201d. 6', 'The IJMs therefore concluded that \u201cnone of the purposes of a judicial management as set out in section 89(1) of the IRDA can be achieved\u201d. 7', 'This was not only because the purported nickel trading was non-existent, but because the Envy Companies did not undertake in any other meaningful business. Moreover, the Envy Companies\u2019 known assets were grossly insufficient to meet the potential claims of the Envy Companies\u2019 creditors.', '12\\u2003On 2 July 2021, the IJMs issued the Update to the Interim Report (the \u201cUpdate\u201d). The IJMs then applied on the same day to wind up the Envy Companies since there was no meaningful business to rehabilitate. On 16 August 2021, a winding up order was made against each of the Envy Companies.', '13\\u2003In the Update, the IJMs identified claims against certain Investors (the \u201cOverwithdrawn Investors\u201d) for: (a) referral fees paid by the Envy Companies; and\/or (b) the Overwithdrawn Sums, as a potential avenue of recovery for the Envy Companies. By way of letters of demand dated between September 2022 and February 2023, the Liquidators wrote to the Overwithdrawn Investors to demand the return of the Overwithdrawn Sums. One hundred of the Overwithdrawn Investors responded to claim that they reinvested part of, or the entirety of, their referral fees and\/or Overwithdrawn Sums in the Envy Companies through a third party\u2019s account and\/or a Joint Account.', '14\\u2003On 26 September 2022, the Liquidators filed various applications to seek the court\u2019s approval of the Liquidators\u2019 use of the \u201crunning account\u201d approach to adjudicate on the Investors\u2019 proofs of debts. During the hearings of those applications in November 2022, the Liquidators were asked how they would treat the sums reinvested by the Overwithdrawn Investors. The Liquidators responded that they would allow the Overwithdrawn Investors to consolidate and net-off the sums reinvested. However, the Liquidators would seek the approval of the Committee of Inspection (\u201cCOI\u201d) or the court for such an approach after they had verified the sums reinvested by the Overwithdrawn Investors.', '15\\u2003On 7 February 2023, a single COI over the Envy Companies was constituted.

The Will, which was dated 21 July 2000, named the Claimant and one other person as the executors and trustees of the Testatrix\u2019s estate. As that other person predeceased the Testatrix, the Claimant was left as the sole executor and trustee. According to the schedule of assets annexed to the grant of probate (issued to the Claimant on 29 May 2023), the Testatrix owned only two assets: (a) the Property, which was valued at $3.2m at the time of her death; and (b) a DBS account containing $3,712.73.', '4\\u2003The Property was subject to a mortgage securing an overdraft loan owing from the Testatrix to United Overseas Bank Ltd (\u201cUOB\u201d). 2', 'On 26 May 2017, UOB obtained an order (\u201cORC 3359\u201d) for the delivery of vacant possession of the Property to UOB, on account of the outstanding overdraft, 3', 'although it appears that UOB did not seek to enforce the order while the Testatrix was still alive. 4', 'Apart from the overdraft loan owed to UOB, the Testatrix also owed sums to the management corporation (\u201cthe MC\u201d) overseeing the condominium development in which the Property was situated, arising from unpaid fees levied for the condominium\u2019s management and sinking funds, as well as cumulative interest on these fees. 5', '5\\u2003Clause 8 of the Will empowered the executors to sell the Testatrix\u2019s immovable property, including the Property.

Pertinently, cll 8(a) and 8(i), contained an express prohibition against the sale of the Testatrix\u2019s immovable property within three years of her death, except in certain situations. For convenience, I reproduce the relevant parts of cl 8 below:', '6\\u2003The Claimant claimed that the estate did not possess any cash to service either the outstanding mortgage to UOB or the debt owed to the MC, and thus decided that the only reasonable course of action was to sell the Property to pay off these liabilities and thereafter set up the Fund. 6', 'As such, the Claimant consulted his solicitors, who advised him that the restriction in cl 8 was of no benefit to the estate or the Fund and that it was advisable for the Property to be sold. The Claimant further averred that his solicitors advised him that in the event of a purchaser subsequently requesting for an order of court sanctioning the sale, an application for such an order could be made once the contract for sale had been signed. 7', 'The Claimant also held family meetings at which the Testatrix\u2019s family members agreed that the Property should be sold. 8', '7\\u2003Relying on his solicitors\u2019 advice, the Claimant granted the Defendant an option to purchase the Property (\u201cthe OTP\u201d), at the price of $4.45m.

He was looking for something to steal as he had no money but wanted to purchase heroin as well as pay off his debts. He spotted the victim, an elderly woman, walking along the street near Blk 966 Jurong West Street 93. He noticed that she was wearing a gold chain. Having decided to steal her gold chain, the appellant tailed the victim back to her residence. He saw her enter her residence. In a bid to get her attention and to lure her closer to the gate, where she would be within striking range, the appellant rang the doorbell and shouted \u201cDavid\u201d. As the victim approached the gate, the appellant reached through the rails of the gate and grabbed the gold chain violently, breaking it.', '7\\u2003These facts formed the subject of the first charge of using criminal force to commit theft under s 356 of the Penal Code 1871 (2020 Rev Ed).', '8\\u2003After robbing the victim of her gold chain, the appellant took a bus to Boon Lay Interchange. He then went to his friend\u2019s housing block where he disposed of his grey shirt to escape detection by the police who would be hot on his trail. Thereafter, he took a taxi to Jalan Bukit Merah where he pawned the gold chain for $870.', '9\\u2003The appellant then took the train to Bukit Batok and went to a block at Bukit Batok where he had previously purchased heroin. After making this purchase, he took a taxi back to Boon Lay where he was arrested. Upon his arrest, he was taken to Woodlands Police Divisional Headquarters. Urine samples were taken. They were found to contain monoacetylmorphine, a known metabolite of heroin and a specified drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act 1973 (2020 Rev Ed) (\u201cMDA\u201d). The appellant stated that he had last consumed heroin on the morning of 20 January 2022 at around 9am.', '10\\u2003These facts formed the subject of the second charge. The appellant was liable for enhanced punishment for drug consumption under the MDA because he had a previous conviction for heroin consumption.', '11\\u2003The DJ considered that a PD sentence was amply justified in the present case. He considered that there was a real need to protect the public against future reoffending given the appellant\u2019s history of offending, the circumstances of the present offences that the appellant was charged with and the risk of future reoffending. Examining the appellant\u2019s lengthy antecedents, the DJ noticed three highly disturbing patterns. First, the appellant\u2019s offences were all drug or property-related. Second, since 2000, the appellant was unable to refrain from crime for any substantial period whenever he was released from incarceration and re-integrated into society. Third, all of the earlier punishments had a limited rehabilitative or deterrent effect. Notwithstanding the fact that the appellant had been incarcerated for increasingly lengthy periods, undergone corrective training, and even been caned, this did not deter him from reoffending (GD at [25]\u2013[29]).', '12\\u2003Continuing in this vein, the DJ noted that the circumstances of the appellant\u2019s present offences reinforced the view that he was a recalcitrant offender. Again, the offences which the appellant had been charged with were drug and property-related (GD at [30]).', '13\\u2003It was also clear, from the facts underlying the first charge, that the offence was not a trivial one. The offence was premeditated. The appellant had formed an intention to steal from the victim. He stalked her to her flat and had no qualms in attacking the victim. He had also deliberately targeted the victim because she was an elderly person. He had also sought to evade arrest \u2013 and this cast doubt on the extent of his remorse (GD at [30]).', '14\\u2003The DJ then considered the appellant\u2019s prospects of reoffending. He noted that the pre-sentencing report (\u201cPSR\u201d) highlighted several risk factors which further lent weight to the view that the appellant should be incarcerated for a substantial period to protect the public. For one, the PSR categorised the appellant as being in the \u201chigh risk\/need\u201d level of criminal reoffending. There was a 70.2% probability of recidivism within two years of release. There were a number of risk factors which supported the view that it was highly probable that the appellant would reoffend. As the appellant himself conceded, his social circle consisted of peers who were negative influences. Further, his own history of drug abuse could also lead him to commit property offences to fuel his habit. The appellant\u2019s behavioural and thinking patterns also suggested that he thought crime was a useful way of resolving his immediate problems. Although capable of introspection and self-reflection, the appellant could not resist the temptation to resort to crime to resolve his problems (GD at [31]\u2013[33]).', '15\\u2003While the appellant\u2019s family and his choice of recreational activities did not present issues, this did not mean that they would stop him from reoffending. In the round, the picture that emerged was that the appellant was highly likely to continue to commit drug and property-related offences which could harm innocent members of the public. There was thus a need to sentence the appellant to PD to protect the public from future reoffending by the appellant (GD at [34]\u2013[35]).', '16\\u2003As to the length of PD, the DJ considered that ten years was warranted, taking into account the appellant\u2019s history of habitual offending, the circumstances of the present offences and the risk factors that strongly suggested that he was likely to reoffend if not incarcerated. In particular, the DJ noted that the likely sentence the appellant would have received had he been sentenced to a term of regular imprisonment was nine years. This suggested that the appropriate length of the PD sentence should not, in any event, be less than nine years. After all, PD operated on a different penological basis from regular imprisonment, and the principle of proportionality would not apply as rigorously (GD at [38]\u2013[42])', '17\\u2003Finally, the DJ concluded, citing the decision of the Court of Appeal in Rosli at [20], that there was no reason to backdate the sentence meted out. The case was not an exceptional one where backdating was possibly justified. Here, we note that the DJ applied Rosli without considering s 318(1) of the CPC (GD at [43]\u2013[44]).'"}

The Exchange gave ASTI 36 months from 6 June 2019 to meet its criteria in order to exit the watchlist. ASTI failed to do so. On 6 June 2022, the Exchange sent ASTI a notification of delisting.

He carried on his business in Singapore through a group of companies held under Sin Soon Lee Realty Company (Private) Limited (\u201cSSLRC\u201d). Dato Lim\u2019s wife, Datin Ong Tin, died intestate on 3 May 2005. 1', '4\\u2003In or around 2013, Dato Lim started to make plans to distribute a portion of his assets among his eight children in Singapore. Indeed, members of the family also desired to reallocate their entitlements to the assets of Datin Ong Tin\u2019s estate. As part of these plans, Dato Lim set up Seng Lee Holdings Pte Ltd (\u201cSLH\u201d) on 12 July 2013 to hold assets that he wished to distribute for the benefit of certain members of his family.', '5\\u2003On 25 July 2013, Dato Lim and his children entered into a Deed of Family Arrangement (the \u201cOriginal Deed\u201d) to, among other things, distribute a portion of his assets to his eight children in Singapore. Pursuant to the Original Deed, Dato Lim allocated his eight children into two groups (\u201cGroup A\u201d and \u201cGroup B\u201d). Dato Lim then divided his various companies (and the properties they owned) between SSLRC and SLH. The Group A beneficiaries, which include Soon Huat, became shareholders of SSLRC and the beneficial owners of the assets held by SSLRC and its subsidiaries. The Group B beneficiaries, which include Dato Lim and Soon Heng, became shareholders of SLH and the beneficial owners of the assets held by SLH and its subsidiaries. 2', '6\\u2003Crucially for present purposes, cl 9.1 of the Original Deed provided as follows: 3', 'In this regard, the \u201cProperties\u201d in cl 9.1 refer to a property at Geylang (the \u201cGeylang Property\u201d), as well as a property at Tamarind Road (the \u201cTamarind Road Property\u201d). 4', '7\\u2003After the Original Deed was signed, the parties involved made various asset transfers in a manner that differed from that provided in the Original Deed. To give effect to this change, all of the signatories to the Original Deed signed various letter-agreements (the \u201cLetter-Agreements\u201d). The Letter-Agreements provided for certain assets to be transferred in a manner that differed from the Original Deed. In effect, the signatories to the Original Deed were agreeing to vary the terms of the Original Deed in the manners set out in the Letter-Agreements. 5', '8\\u2003Beyond the Letter-Agreements, the Original Deed was amended twice, in 2015 and 2019. Dato Lim proposed that the Original Deed be amended to provide some flexibility for how the assets would be distributed. To that end, a draft of the amendments was circulated to the signatories of the Original Deed. Eventually, on 28 February 2015, the members of the Lim family entered into an Amending and Restating Deed of Family Arrangement to amend certain terms of the Original Deed (the \u201cAmended Deed\u201d). Among other things, cl 9.1 was amended to provide as follows: 6', '9\\u2003As for the reasons for these amendments, the defendants\u2019 position is that several discussions took place between the family members regarding the draft of the Amended Deed, but no notes were kept of those discussions. More specifically, at one such meeting in 2014 between Dato Lim and three of the defendants, the first defendant suggested that the amendments to the Original Deed should not detract from the original intention that the assets distributed under the Original Deed had to be kept within the family in Singapore and retained for the benefit of either the Group A or Group B beneficiaries. In response, Dato Lim supposedly told the first defendant not to worry and assured him that the amendments would not detract from such an intention. Thus, the defendants take the view that the inclusion of the phrase \u201cand\/or nominees\u201d meant that a party nominated by a named beneficiary under the Amended Deed was to hold the asset for the benefit of and on the named beneficiary\u2019s behalf. This was said to introduce flexibility into the Amended Deed to allow entitles other than the named beneficiary to receive assets, but on the condition that they did so on behalf of the named beneficiary. 7', '10\\u2003Soon Huat and Soon Heng disagree with the defendants as to the reasons for this amendment to cl 9.1. Specifically, they claim to have been unaware of any discussions or any communications about those discussions. They therefore dispute the defendants\u2019 interpretation of the words \u201cand\/or nominees\u201d. In their view, the parties\u2019 intention behind the Amended Deed was not for any nominee to hold any of the assets as a trustee. 8', '11\\u2003Subsequently, on 11 January 2019, the parties to the Original Deed and the Amended Deed entered into a third deed (the \u201cThird Deed\u201d), to provide, among others, for the disposal and handling of certain shares in an asset in Australia (the \u201cAustralian Investment\u201d) to SLH. More specifically, following the terms of the Amended Deed, cl 10 provided that the shares in the Australian Investment were to be transferred to SLH \u201cand\/or its nominees\u201d. The Australian Investment was eventually given to the family of Mr Lim Soon Joo (who is Dato Lim\u2019s third child and eldest son) by way of certain share transfers. 9', '12\\u2003As will be recalled, cl 9.1 of the Amended Deed obliged the Group A Beneficiaries to procure SSLRC to: (a) transfer the Properties; and (b) pay the amount of $9m (which was the second tranche of the \u201cGroup B Assignment Amount\u201d as referred to at cl 12.5 of the Amended Deed), 10', 'to SLH and\/or its nominees. To this end, sometime in July 2020, Soon Heng and Soon Huat proposed that the remaining $9m of the Group B Assignment Amount that was due to be paid to SLH be transferred to Dato Lim, and for the Properties to be transferred to Soon Huat and his son, Mr Lim Yong Yeow Thomas (\u201cThomas\u201d), respectively, purportedly as nominees of SLH.', '13\\u2003Dato Lim then proposed a meeting between the Group A and Group B beneficiaries to resolve the transfers mentioned above. This meeting took place on 7 August 2020 and was attended by the parties and their lawyers. However, the meeting ended after just half an hour, as the parties and their lawyers could not resolve the issues at hand. In the days following 7 August 2020, the lawyers who attended the meeting exchanged email about the issues discussed at the meeting. However, the parties remained unable to resolve many of the issues. 11', '14\\u2003On 27 July 2022, the fourth defendant, Ms Leong Quee Ching Karen (\u201cKaren\u201d), commenced HC\/OC 158\/2022 (\u201cOC 158\u201d) against, among others, the majority shareholders of SLH, including Soon Huat and Soon Heng, for minority oppression. For present purposes, it suffices to state that one of the alleged oppressive acts was that Soon Huat and Soon Heng intended for Soon Huat and Thomas to receive the Properties instead of SLH. Thus, according to the defendants, one of the disputed issues in OC 158 relates to the interpretation of the words \u201cand\/or nominees\u201d as set out in the Amended Deed. Further to OC 158, Karen also filed HC\/SUM 2781\/2022 (\u201cSUM 2781\u201d), where she sought, among others, injunctions to restrain the transfer of the Properties to Soon Huat and Thomas pending the final determination of OC 158 and any appeals therefrom.', '15\\u2003Soon Huat and Soon Heng, along with the defendants in OC 158, applied to strike out OC 158 on the basis that Karen ought to have accepted a buy-out offer from Soon Huat. This striking out application was dismissed by an Assistant Registrar, and the resulting appeals were then dismissed by the High Court in Leong Quee Ching Karen v Lim Soon Huat and others [2023] 4 SLR 1133. OC 158 therefore remains to be determined pending the resolution of SUM 2781.', '16\\u2003After their striking out applications were dismissed, Soon Huat and Soon Heng raised, at a case conference on 23 May 2023, their intention to file OA 738 and OA 739 to determine the interpretation of cl 9.1 of the Amended Deed. Karen took the position that these OAs should be commenced by way of OCs. Despite Karen\u2019s views, Soon Huat and Soon Heng proceeded to file the OAs on 25 July 2023. Under the OAs, Soon Huat and Soon Heng sought the following orders: 12', '(a)\\u2003a declaration concerning the interpretation of the words \u201cand\/or nominees\u201d under cl 9.1 of the Amended Deed; and', '(b)\\u2003an order that the Group A Beneficiaries procure SSLRC to transfer the Properties to Soon Huat and Thomas.', '17\\u2003On 28 August 2023, the defendants in OA 738 and OA 739 filed the conversion applications to convert the OAs into OCs.

To understand the context in which the Patents teach processes to synthesise bortezomib, it is important to understand the basic structure of boronic acid. In the Primer, the plaintiffs define boronic acid as a compound related to boric acid in which one of the three hydroxyl groups is replaced by an alkyl or aryl group. 54', 'A hydroxyl group is a functional group denoted by the chemical formula \u2212OH and composed of one oxygen atom covalently bonded to one hydrogen atom. 55', 'An alkyl group is derived from an alkane by the removal of one hydrogen atom from a carbon atom. 56', 'In organic chemistry, an alkane is a hydrocarbon, which in other words consists of hydrogen and carbon atoms only, arranged in a tree structure. 57', 'For instance, the alkyl group of methane (denoted by the chemical formula CH4) is methyl (denoted by the chemical formula CH3). 58', 'An aryl group is a functional group derived from a simple aromatic ring compound where one hydrogen atom is removed from the ring. 59', 'For example, a simple aryl group is phenyl (denoted by the chemical formula C6H5), a group derived from benzene (denoted by the chemical formula C6H6).

Given their unique characteristics, boronic acids are used extensively in organic chemistry as chemical building blocks and intermediates in various organic reactions.', '33\\u2003The annotated diagram below depicts the components of bortezomib: the two hydroxyl groups circled by the dotted lines and the replacement group with the dashed line. The boron atom is denoted by \u201cB\u201d.', '', '34\\u2003In the context of bortezomib, the \u201cate\u201d complex refers to a specific type of complex formed during the synthesis of the active ingredient, bortezomib. Specifically, it refers to the complex formed between boronic acid and an organometallic reagent, typically a lithium or magnesium compound, which is used to create the boronate ester intermediate in the synthesis of bortezomib. 62', 'It is a complex which is formed by the rearrangement of boron compounds in the presence of Lewis acid. 63', 'These boron compounds can be represented in the form of Formula (II), 64', 'as (IIa) or (IIb), 65', 'and as the compound of Formula (XV). 66', 'This complex allows for the transfer of the boronic acid moiety to the organometallic reagent, which is necessary to form the boronate ester intermediate. Without this complex, the reaction may not proceed effectively, leading to lower yields or incomplete reaction. The \u201cate\u201d complex is therefore a critical component of the synthesis of bortezomib, allowing for the efficient formation of the boronate ester intermediate.', '35\\u2003Furthermore, the formation and stability of the \u201cate\u201d complex is dependent on several factors, such as the nature of the boronic acid and the organometallic reagent, as well as the reaction conditions. As a result, optimizing the conditions for the formation of this complex is important for the efficient synthesis of bortezomib. 67', '36\\u2003A Lewis acid is a molecular entity and chemical species that contains an empty orbital which is capable of accepting an electron pair from a Lewis base to form a Lewis adduct. 68', 'A Lewis base is any species that has a filled orbital containing an electron pair which is not involved in bonding but may form a dative bond with a Lewis acid to form a Lewis adduct because it can donate its lone pair of electrons. 69', 'In a Lewis adduct, the Lewis acid and base share an electron pair furnished by the Lewis base, forming a dative bond. 70', 'This is depicted in the diagram below.', 'A dative bond is also known as a coordinate, coordination or dipolar bond, and it is a bond formed upon interaction between molecular species where one serves as a donor and the other an acceptor of the electron pair to be shared. 71', 'Its analogy as a \u201ctype\u201d of covalent bond stems from it sharing a common electron pair between two atoms; although dative bonds have significant polarity, lesser strength and greater length. 72', 'A covalent bond is a region of relatively high electron density between nuclei of atoms which arises from inter alia the sharing of electrons. 73', '37\\u2003For the purposes of the present suit, it would be useful to note that zinc chloride (ZnCl2) is a Lewis acid. 74', '38\\u2003A nucleofuge group, otherwise known as a nucleofugic group, is a functional group that is capable of leaving a molecule during a chemical reaction by accepting a pair of electrons. It departs from a substrate with a pair of electrons, forming a new species, while the substrate undergoes a transformation. 75', 'In the synthesis of bortezomib, a nucleofuge is used in the formation of the boronic acid or boronate ester moiety. For instance, a suitable nucleofugic group is attached to a boron-containing intermediate, and upon reaction with the desired nucleophile, the nucleofugic group leaves the molecule, enabling the formation of the boronic acid or boronate ester functional group. 76', '39\\u2003The proteasome is a multisubunit enzyme complex that plays a central role in the regulation of proteins that control cell-cycle progression and apoptosis (cell death), and has therefore become an important target for anticancer therapy. 77', '40\\u2003A coordinating solvent or a coordinating co-solvent refers to a solvent that is capable of coordinating the Lewis acid and solvating the ionic components of the reaction. 78', 'A co-solvent is a solvent added to another primary solvent to modify the solubility of the reaction components. 79', '41\\u2003A coordinating ether solvent is an organic solvent that contains one or more ether functional groups, such as dimethyl ether, diethyl ether, or tetrahydrofuran (\u201cTHF\u201d). 80', 'These solvents are commonly used in coordination chemistry and organometallic chemistry, as they have the ability to coordinate with metal ions and facilitate their solubility in organic solvents. 81', '42\\u2003Homologation is the chemical process through which some boronic acid esters compounds (ie, the class of intermediates in the synthesis of bortezomib (see [58] below)) are synthesised. In organic chemistry, a homologation reaction is any chemical reaction that converts the reactant into the next member of the homologous series, which is a group of compounds that differ by a constant unit, generally a methylene (\u2013CH2\u2013) group. 82', '43\\u2003The Matteson homologation protocol is an organic chemistry reaction used to extend a carbon chain by one carbon atom, while also introducing a functional group, typically an alkene or alkyne. 83', 'The reaction involves the use of a homologating agent, which contains a halogen atom, and a nucleophile, typically an organometallic reagent such as an alkyl lithium or magnesium compound. 84', 'In the manufacture of bortezomib, the Matteson homologation protocol introduces an additional carbon atom to the boronate ester intermediate, which is a key step in the synthesis of bortezomib. Specifically, the protocol involves the use of a Lewis acid catalyst, which facilitates the reaction between the boronate ester intermediate and the homologating agent. The Lewis acid catalyst may be a metal halide such as zinc chloride, which coordinates with the boronate ester intermediate and activates it towards reaction with the homologating agent. The resulting product is an extended carbon chain with a new functional group, which can be further manipulated to obtain the desired final product, bortezomib. 85', '44\\u2003In 1983, Professor Donald S. Matteson (\u201cProf Matteson\u201d) reported his studies on the synthesis of (+)-pinanediol (\u03b1S)-\u03b1-chloro-\u03b1-phenylmethane boronate by using zinc chloride as a Lewis acid catalyst in an academic article titled \u201cEpimerization of \u03b1-Chloro Boronic Esters by Lithium and Zinc Chlorides\u201d (\u201cMatteson and Erdik\u201d). 86', 'Prof Matteson recorded his findings that the epimerisation of (+)-pinanediol (\u03b1S)-\u03b1-chloro-\u03b1-phenylmethane boronate was catalysed by lithium chloride (denoted by chemical formula LiCl) in the solvent THF. THF is an organic compound with the formula (CH2)4O, and in the case of moisture-sensitive reactions, anhydrous THF may be used. 87', 'Epimerisation creates an undesirable compound that reduces product purity (see [52] below). 88', 'Prof Matteson observed that the rate of epimerisation is greatly increased by reagents which promote the ionisation of lithium chloride, including water and dimethyl sulfoxide. 89', 'The active catalyst is thus the free chloride ion (Cl-). Prof Matteson further explained that zinc chloride (being a direct substitute for lithium chloride) also catalysed the epimerisation. 90', 'In summary, the Matteson homologation reaction may be split into two stages, and the synthetic reaction sequence is shown below.', '', '45\\u2003Step 1 involves the synthesis of the boron \u201cate\u201d complex (ie, an intermediate in the synthesis of bortezomib), while step 2 involves contacting the resultant boron \u201cate\u201d complex with a Lewis acid (contacting step) to generate the desired product. The yield of the desired product was accompanied with a 6% rate of the unwanted epimerised product (see [249] below). In the subsequent studies, Matteson and Erdik identified excess lithium chloride (LiCl) to be the reason for the rate of epimerisation observed, and further noted that the presence of a small amount of water led to the higher ionisation of lithium chloride (in other words, an increased formation of Li+ ions and Cl- ions). As a consequence, the rate of epimerisation increased significantly. The diagram below illustrates the epimerisation process.', '', '46\\u2003The known problem (or limitation) of the Matteson homologation process is therefore epimerisation, which introduces an undesired by-product. The coordinating solvent, THF, with even small amounts of water, promotes the ionisation of LiCl, and the Cl- ions. This in turn causes the epimerisation of the desired product to form the undesired by-product that is the impurity (or the epimer). Moisture in the THF is likely introduced by the Lewis acid catalyst, zinc chloride (ZnCl2), itself. Zinc chloride is a highly hygroscopic compound (ie, it absorbs moisture from its surroundings) and drying it is difficult and resource-intensive, especially when a large amount of the Lewis acid is to be dried. To illustrate the magnitude of the known problem of epimerisation, Matteson and Erdik recorded that 11mg of water in 10ml of THF doubled the rate of epimerisation. 91', 'Resultantly, the yield of the desired product falls.', '47\\u2003Deprotection is a chemical process in which a protecting group is removed from a functional group in a molecule, restoring the original reactivity of that functional group. Protecting groups are temporary modifications made to a molecule to prevent undesirable side reactions during a multi-step synthesis. 92', 'In the synthesis of bortezomib, deprotection is a critical step. Bortezomib contains an N-terminal pyrazinoic acid moiety and a C-terminal boronic acid group. 93', 'During synthesis, the boronic acid group is often protected as a boronate ester to prevent unwanted side reactions. Deprotection of the boronate ester is necessary to obtain the active boronic acid form of bortezomib. 94', '48\\u2003Ionisation is the process by which an atom or molecule acquires a net electric charge by gaining or losing one or more electrons, thus forming an ion. In the context of the manufacture of bortezomib, ionisation may be utilised during the analytical stages to monitor the quality and purity of the intermediates and the final product. Ionisation is employed in various analytical techniques such as mass spectrometry, to identify and characterise molecules by altering their charge states and subsequently detecting their masses.', '49\\u2003Linear synthesis is a chemical synthesis process in which a series of linear transformation reactions are used to convert a reactant or some reactants into a product or multiple products. 95', 'This synthesis process includes the longest route for the production of the target product. 96', '50\\u2003Convergent synthesis is a chemical synthesis process in which pieces of the desired product are made by a set of reactions, and the pieces are combined with each other via another set of reactions. 97', 'This type of synthesis process is different from linear synthesis because this process involves parallel reactions rather than linear transformations. 98', 'This process features in SG 29P.', '51\\u2003Diastereomeric ratio is a term used in chemistry to describe the relative amounts of different diastereomers in a mixture. 99', 'Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other (or non-superimposable stereoisomers) and have different physical and chemical properties. 100', 'Such physical and chemical properties include melting point, boiling point and solubility. The diastereomeric ratio is usually expressed as the ratio of the concentration of one diastereomer to the concentration of the other diastereomer in a mixture. 101', 'For example, if a mixture contains 60% of diastereomer A and 40% of diastereomer B, the diastereomeric ratio of A:B is 3:2. 102', 'By measuring the diastereomeric ratio, pharmaceutical chemists can determine the purity and quality of drug compounds, optimise the production processes for chiral drugs and monitor the stability and degradation of chiral drug compounds during storage or in biological systems. 103', '52\\u2003Epimerisation is a process in which there is an interconversion of one epimer to another epimer (ie, the configuration of a stereocenter is changed from one enantiomer to another). 104', 'An epimer is one of a pair of diastereomers, each of which have opposite configuration at only one stereogenic centre out of at least two. In the context of the Matteson homologation protocol, epimerisation can occur during the reaction of the chiral starting material with reagents such as THF in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst (eg, zinc chloride). 105', 'During the Matteson homologation reaction, the chiral starting material is converted to a new chiral intermediate, which is then used to synthesise the boronic ester intermediate for bortezomib. If the reaction conditions are not carefully controlled, however, the chiral intermediate can undergo epimerisation, leading to the formation of undesired stereoisomers and reducing the yield and purity of the desired product. 106', '53\\u2003Hygroscopic refers to a substance\u2019s tendency to absorb moisture from the environment. 107', 'Hygroscopy is the phenomenon of attracting and holding water molecules via either absorption or adsorption from the surrounding environment, which is usually at normal or room temperature. 108', 'In the context of the manufacture of bortezomib, hygroscopic materials may be used to control moisture levels in the reaction environment to ensure the stability and effectiveness of the final product. 109', '54\\u2003Miscibility is the ability of two or more substances to mix together and form a homogeneous solution without phase separation. 110', 'If two substances are miscible, they are also completely soluble in one another irrespective of the order of introduction.

Stereochemical erosion must be minimised during bortezomib synthesis to maintain the desired stereochemistry of the final product, which directly affects its therapeutic efficacy. 113', '57\\u2003It is common ground that there are a number of ways to synthesise bortezomib.', '58\\u2003Bortezomib is made by synthesising a series of intermediates.

SUM 1697 was an application by the first and second defendants for the Order to be varied by removing paragraphs 1, 2 and 11 from the Order. In brief, I found that a court of co-ordinate jurisdiction to the court that granted the Order lacked the power to do what Dr Chan sought in SUM 1697, which was to effectively reverse the Order, which itself was a final order granted pursuant to the plaintiff\u2019s summary judgment application. In any event, there were also no grounds justifying a setting aside or variation of the Order, even assuming the court had the power to do so.', '23\\u2003I then continued to hear SUM 5179.

However, this was not set out in any affidavit, including that of Dr Chan\u2019s forensic expert. Following Ms Lee\u2019s request, I adjourned the hearing again and allowed the first and second defendants to file a further affidavit to clarify what devices had been received by their expert, when, and from whom, and to explain the conclusions reached by the expert on whether those devices fell within the list of devices enumerated in the Order. The plaintiff was allowed to respond to the further affidavit.', '24\\u2003The further affidavits were duly filed, and the matter came before me for the third time on 17 October 2022. At that hearing, Ms Lee fairly acknowledged that even as of 17 October 2022, full compliance had not been achieved. Instead, Ms Lee\u2019s core argument was that Dr Chan\u2019s efforts to-date ought to carry a mitigating effect on sentencing.', '25\\u2003After hearing arguments on 17 October 2022, I reserved judgment. Subsequently, and in the course of my deliberations, it emerged that there was a potential issue on whether the requirements for service of the Order under O 45 r 7(2)(b) of the ROC had been complied with.

Under O 67 r 3(4) ROC 2014, an applicant seeking to register a foreign judgment under REFJA is required to provide evidence of the enforceability by execution of the foreign judgment in its country of origin alongside the affidavit supporting the application.

{"casename":"2023_SGHC_44","fact":"'2\\u2003I begin with the relevant background facts to the present appeal. As is clear, Suit 465 and Suit 877 were in issue. Suit 465 is a claim by the nominal shareholder, Ms Yeo Su Lan (Yang Shulan) (\u201cYSL\u201d), for minority oppression against the first defendant, Mr Thomas Hong (\u201cThomas\u201d), the second defendant, Ms Tan Li Khim (Chen Liqin) (\u201cTLK\u201d), and the third defendant, Soup Empire Holdings Pte Ltd (\u201cSEH\u201d). It is helpful to set out a brief summary of SEH which explains why YSL is a nominal shareholder. SEH is in the food and beverage industry. SEH was co-founded by Thomas and Mr Lim Cheng San (\u201cEdger\u201d). Thomas and Edger hold shares beneficially in SEH through a trust arrangement with TLK and YSL, who are the only two shareholders of SEH. TLK and YSL hold 60.4% and 39.6% of the shares in SEH on trust for Thomas and Edger, respectively. This therefore explains why YSL is the plaintiff in Suit 465 and not Edger. Indeed, Edger is not named as a plaintiff in Suit 465 even though he, for all intents and purposes, is the main protagonist in these matters together with Thomas.', '3\\u2003In response to YSL\u2019s claim in Suit 465, Thomas caused SEH to bring a counterclaim (\u201cthe Counterclaim\u201d) against YSL and four other defendants. The Counterclaim alleged that the defendants conspired to use unlawful means to injure SEH\u2019s business. In so far as the defendants in the Counterclaim are concerned, the second defendant is Edger, the third defendant is Ms Teo Li Lian (Zhang Lilian) (\u201cZhang Lilian\u201d), who is the de facto owner of the fourth defendant, W Food Empire Pte Ltd (\u201cWFE\u201d), which in turn is a company that runs a food business in competition with SEH, and the fifth defendant is The Dim Sum Place (CCP) II Pte Ltd (\u201cDSP\u201d), which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the fourth defendant.', '4\\u2003At this point, it is significant to note that one of the alleged conspirators is Mr Cheong Chee Wai (\u201cJames\u201d). James was a former employee at SEH and its group of companies. He served as Director of Operations. Despite being portrayed as a major participant in the alleged conspiracy in the Counterclaim, James was not named as a defendant in the Counterclaim. It is not necessary to speculate why SEH did not do this, although YSL did suggest that this was because SEH was under the mistaken belief that it needed to seek leave to bring James as a defendant given that he is an undischarged bankrupt. But what SEH did do next was significant. SEH, together with two other plaintiffs, commenced Suit 877 as a separate suit against James and his wife, Ms Yen Mei Ling (\u201cYML\u201d). The other two plaintiffs in Suit 877 are the companies Lao Huo Tang Restaurant Pte Ltd (\u201cLHTR\u201d) and Lao Huo Tang Group Pte Ltd (\u201cLHTG\u201d). These companies are wholly owned subsidiaries of SEH.', '5\\u2003The main cause of action against James in Suit 877 is for the alleged breach of his implied duties of good faith and fidelity, or his duties as an employee. These duties were allegedly owed to SEH, LHTR, and LHTG. Apart from this, a second cause of action against James in Suit 877 is for the tort of malicious falsehood. As against YML, the causes of action against her in Suit 877 are two-fold: (a) breach of the fiduciary duties and obligations under s 157 of the Companies Act 1967 (2020 Rev Ed) (\u201cCompanies Act\u201d) in her capacity as a director of LHTR, and (b) breach of a resulting trust by her keeping of the sale proceeds from the sale of a vehicle owned by LHTR. There was no allegation in either Suit 465 or Suit 877 that YML was a participant in the alleged conspiracy to injure SEH\u2019s business.', '6\\u2003While Suit 465 is moving along to trial, there has already been a default judgment entered against James in Suit 877. This is because James did not enter a defence in Suit 877. He had not entered a defence because, as an undischarged bankrupt, he needed to seek the Official Assignee\u2019s sanction to defend Suit 877 but did not succeed in doing so. The plaintiffs in Suit 877 therefore sought to and succeeded in entering judgment in default of defence against James, but only with respect to the cause of action in relation to his breach of his various duties, with the assessment of damages to be done after the conclusion of Suit 465. Default judgment was not entered against James with respect to his alleged commission of the tort of malicious falsehood because the court was not satisfied that all the elements of the tort were made out in the pleadings. As such, it is clear that only three causes of action remain in Suit 877, namely, those of (a) malicious falsehood against James, (b) breach of director\u2019s duties against YML, and (c) breach of a resulting trust against YML.', '7\\u2003It was in these general circumstances that SEH brought SUM 4175 to consolidate Suit 877 with Suit 465. SUM 4175 was opposed by all the defendants in the Counterclaim.'"}

Suit 821 was commenced by Mr Salgaocar in August 2015. Unfortunately, Mr Salgaocar passed away suddenly intestate on 1 January 2016, which resulted in Mdm Lakshmi taking over the conduct of Suit 821 in her capacity as the sole administratrix of his estate. While he was alive, Mr Salgaocar was a businessman who engaged in a wide range of business interests. Within India, Mr Salgaocar and his family had owned iron ore mines, in Goa since 1955 and in Karnataka since 1972. The iron ore produced by these mines was sold and\/or exported principally through Salgaocar Mining Industries Pvt Ltd (\u201cSMI\u201d), a company incorporated in India. Five of the BVI SPVs (see [14] below) bought iron ore exclusively from SMI while the sixth purchased iron ore from one of Mr Salgaocar\u2019s companies in Swaziland.', '7\\u2003The second plaintiff is Winter Meadow Capital Inc (\u201cWinter Meadow\u201d).

Between 1981 to 2000, Mr Darsan was in the business of dealing in diamonds and gemstones in India. Thereafter, Mr Darsan relocated to Hong Kong in order to expand his business into the Chinese market.', '9\\u2003The second and third defendants are Mr Darsan\u2019s wife, Mdm Jhaveri Jashma Darsan, and daughter, Ms Pooja Darsan Jhaveri, respectively. The plaintiffs discontinued Suit 821 against the second defendant on 4 March 2019 and have not effected service of process on the third defendant.', '10\\u2003The fourth to fourteenth defendants are SPVs incorporated in Singapore, of which Mr Darsan is a director and, either directly or indirectly, the sole shareholder.

Mr Kwan was hired by Mr Salgaocar to work in relation to the BVI SPVs (defined at [14] below). Specifically, Mr Kwan was involved in the sale of iron ore from India and Swaziland to buyers in China, through the BVI SPVs. Mr Kwan was the plaintiffs\u2019 witness in Suit 821.', '12\\u2003The SPVs incorporated in the BVI and a number of the SPVs incorporated in Singapore are relevant to Suit 821. The plaintiffs claim that they are part of the assets of the 2003 Trust. By the plaintiffs\u2019 account, these companies were set up by Mr Salgaocar and he was the sole beneficial owner of all the shares issued by the SPVs as well as the monies, investments and other assets that were held by the SPVs. However, as noted above, the plaintiffs have clarified that they are not making any claims in Suit 821 against the assets of the SPVs.', '13\\u2003The SPVs incorporated in the BVI are the six SPVs referred to at [1] above. I shall refer to them collectively as \u201cthe BVI SPVs\u201d.

Thereafter, Mr Darsan frequently met Mr Salgaocar and\/or his family members socially and for business and became a close friend of Mr Salgaocar and his family. Mr Darsan likened his relationship with Mr Salgaocar to that between a \u201cfather and son\u201d. This was not seriously challenged by the plaintiffs.', '18\\u2003While SMI was in the 1950s and 1960s primarily in the business of exporting iron ore to Europe, the closure of the Suez Canal in June 1967 resulted in SMI pivoting to exporting iron ore to Japan instead. When demand from Chinese steel mills for iron ore grew, SMI started exporting iron ore to China as well. Save for Eltina, the other BVI SPVs were thus set up for the purpose of trading in iron ore between January 2004 and October 2009. Five of the BVI SPVs \u2013 Ling Tao, Sino Ling Tao (BVI), GBA Minmetals, Cheermark and Joyking \u2013 purchased iron ore from SMI, on a free on board (\u201cFOB\u201d) basis, and on-sold it on a spot basis to the Chinese market on a cost and freight (\u201cCFR\u201d) basis. The last BVI SPV, Eltina, purchased iron ore from one of Salgaocar\u2019s companies in Swaziland on a CFR basis for sale to the Chinese market also on a CFR basis. I shall refer to this manner of sales as \u201cthe two-legged contracts\u201d.', '19\\u2003The two-legged contracts proved to be hugely profitable for the BVI SPVs. Between 2005 and 2012, the Singapore SPVs were incorporated, and they acquired vessels, shipping assets and real estate using the trading profits made by the BVI SPVs. However, the plaintiffs claim that from 2011 to 2014, Mr Darsan had without Mr Salgaocar\u2019s knowledge or approval, inter alia, arranged for the BVI SPVs to pay US$270,372,938 to himself or entities controlled by or connected to him. The plaintiffs also claim that Mr Darsan caused the transfer of various apartments in Newton Imperial, a residential project in Singapore, from the developer, Great Newton Properties, to himself and the second defendant, as well as third parties and 22 BVI companies owned by Million Dragon Wealth Ltd (\u201cMillion Dragon\u201d). Million Dragon is a BVI company whose sole shareholder and director was the third defendant at the time of transfer of the apartments in question. When Mr Salgaocar found out about the events described above, his relationship with Mr Darsan started to fray and deteriorate.', '20\\u2003On 14 May 2014, Holman Fenwick Willan Hong Kong (\u201cHFW\u201d), acting on Mr Salgaocar\u2019s instructions, issued a letter of demand to Mr Darsan (\u201cthe HFW Letter\u201d) for a return of the trust assets that were alleged to have been misappropriated. What transpired subsequently are events and correspondences in respect of which Mr Darsan has claimed \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d privilege, a matter which is further discussed below at [131]\u2013[144].', '21\\u2003Eventually, in or around December 2014, Mr Ajaib Haridass (\u201cMr Haridass\u201d), a lawyer retained by Mr Salgaocar in relation to the recovery of the trust assets, approached representatives from Deloitte & Touche LLP (\u201cDeloitte\u201d) to undertake an assessment of the assets that could be part of a settlement. In the subsequent months, Mr Haridass corresponded with Deloitte. Meetings involving Mr Haridass, Mr Darsan\u2019s representative Mr Rajiv Bhoj (\u201cMr Bhoj\u201d), one of Mr Salgaocar\u2019s accountants Mr Nitin Sud (\u201cMr Sud\u201d), and two directors from Deloitte took place in Mr Haridass\u2019 office. Eventually Deloitte was not engaged.', '22\\u2003Mr Salgaocar commenced Suit 821 in August 2015 after, according to the plaintiffs, Mr Darsan failed to comply with some of Mr Salgaocar\u2019s demands in relation to the trust assets. Mr Darsan filed the defence on 6 October 2015 before applying by Summons No 6205 of 2015 (\u201cSUM 6205\u201d) on 28 December 2015 to strike out the Statement of Claim (\u201cthe SOC\u201d) and for Suit 821 to be dismissed. This was on the basis that if the matters in the SOC were accepted as true, Mr Salgaocar\u2019s export arrangements to China through the BVI SPVs breached Indian law including the Customs Act 1962 (India) (\u201cthe Customs Act\u201d) and the Foreign Exchange Management Act 1999 (India) (\u201cthe FEMA\u201d), as he was said to have not made a true declaration of the full export value of the iron ore sold in China, amongst others.', '23\\u2003Subsequently, following Mr Salgaocar\u2019s passing in 2016, there was a lengthy impasse in the proceedings. This was because a dispute arose in the Family Justice Courts between Mdm Lakshmi and Ms Chandana Anil Salgaocar (\u201cMs Chandana\u201d), Mr Salgaocar and Mdm Lakshmi\u2019s daughter, over the appointment of the administratrix of Mr Salgaocar\u2019s estate. As matters neared resolution, on 15 May 2017, Mdm Lakshmi\u2019s solicitors notified the court, copying Mr Darsan\u2019s solicitors, that a settlement of the issue on appointment was expected with the result that a single administratrix would administer the estate\u2019s affairs including the conduct of Suit 821.Several satellite litigation followed.', '24\\u2003The next day, on 16 May 2017, Mr Darsan commenced proceedings against Mr Salgaocar\u2019s estate and Million Dragon in the BVI (\u201cBVI 83\u201d). In BVI 83, Mr Darsan alleged that he was the beneficial owner of the sole share in Million Dragon, which had been transferred to Mr Salgaocar in July 2014. The transfer was allegedly made in return for Mr Salgaocar agreeing to transfer to Mr Darsan monies that were paid for the purchase of units in Newton Imperial by Million Dragon. As Mr Salgaocar failed to transfer the monies, Mr Darsan asserted that he was the beneficial owner of the share. About three weeks later, on 7 June 2017, Mdm Lakshmi filed Originating Summons No 627 of 2017 (\u201cOS 627\u201d) in the High Court for an anti-suit injunction to restrain Mr Darsan from proceeding in BVI 83. The application was not granted by the High Court in April 2018 but later allowed by the Court of Appeal in July 2019.

{"casename":"2023_SGHC_59","fact":"the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding Ms Tay\u2019s conduct are dissimilar to those of the applicants in Re \nLeon Tay, Re Wong Wai Loong Sean, and Re Monisha Devaraj in two main \nrespects:\n(a) Ms Tay did not cheat in her professional qualifying examinations \nbut committed plagiarism in one of her modules in her second year of \nuniversity. While plagiarism is not less serious than cheating in an \nexamination, it may be less aggravated when the misconduct in question \nis isolated and has taken place a significant time before the admission \nprocess, rather than in the very process of seeking admission.\n(b) Unlike the other cases that have been dealt with, Ms Tay was \nentirely forthcoming about the misconduct. She disclosed it in her \nadmission affidavit even though the facts were private and not public. I \nfurther note that as early as 28 May 2022, Ms Tay contacted SMU\u2019s \nOffice of the Dean of Students to obtain the records relating to her \ndisciplinary conduct, which suggests that she may have been \ncontemplating disclosing this this incident even before the incidents \nconcerning the 2020 Part B Examination came into public attention. In \nany case, the willingness to make disclosure of a matter that was not \nVersion No 2: 10 Mar 2023 (16:49 hrs)\nRe Tay Jie Qi[2023] SGHC 59 \n7publicly known suggests to me that she was resolute about coming clean \nand facing up to the consequences. \n14 In the circumstances before me, I am satisfied Ms Tay has sufficiently \nshown that she has learnt from her mistake and can be considered a proper \nperson to be admitted as an advocate and solicitor in Singapore at this time. I \nnow elaborate on my reasons.\n15 I earlier referred to the importance of assessing the significance of any \ninstance of misconduct with the benefit of the time that has passed since then. \nIn this case, it is significant that Ms Tay has maintained a clean record through \nthe remainder of her course of study at SMU and beyond that.  In the intervening \nperiod of nearly four years since the incident that took place in or about May \n2019, she has graduated from SMU and passed her Part B examinations without \nany further suggestion of dishonesty or misconduct. As I emphasised in Re Leon \nTay at [42] and Re Wong Wai Loong Sean at [27], the purpose of deferment in \nadmission applications is not to punish, but to provide a timeframe for the \napplicant to resolve her character issues and for the stakeholders to regain \nconfidence in the applicant\u2019s suitability to be admitted. \n16 In my view, the period of time that has elapsed is a weighty factor in the \npresent circumstances because it serves as evidence that her remorse is real and \nthat she does have the necessary capacity for change and rehabilitation. It \ndemonstrates that Ms Tay has reflected on and understood the ramifications of \nher misconduct as a student at SMU and has resolved not to repeat it. This period \nalso affords the stakeholders sufficient time to assess her suitability for \nadmission. Unlike the applicants in Re Leon Tay, Re Wong Wai Loong Sean, \nand Re Monisha Devaraj, who cheated in their Part B examinations shortly \nbefore their admission applications, there is no need to further defer Ms Tay\u2019s \nVersion No 2: 10 Mar 2023 (16:49 hrs)\nRe Tay Jie Qi[2023] SGHC 59 \n8admission application in order to enable the stakeholders to assess her \nsuitability. \n17 In addition, as I have already noted, Ms Tay demonstrated candour and \nforthrightness in confronting her mistake. This can be seen not only from her \ninitial conduct during SMU\u2019s investigations in 2019, but also from her voluntary \ndisclosures in her affidavit for admission. When Ms Tay was first confronted \nby Professor Ong, she immediately admitted that certain paragraphs in her \nResearch Paper were taken from the Relevant Research Paper. She apologised \nfor her misconduct and indicated that she was willing to accept any punishment \nmeted out by the school. This contrasts favourably with the applicant in Re Leon \nTay who lied to the SILE when he was initially confronted over his suspected \ncheating (see Re Leon Tay at [2] and [7]). Ms Tay\u2019s willingness to admit to her \nmistakes during the initial investigation is similar to that of Mr Lim Zi Yi (\u201cMr \nLim\u201d) and Ms Annabelle Au Jia En (\u201cMs Au\u201d) in Re Wong Wai Loong Sean, \nand that was a significant factor I considered in concluding that a shorter \nduration of deferment would suffice for Mr Lim and Ms Au as compared to that \nfor the other applicants in that case (see Re Wong Wai Loong Sean at [73]). \n18 Ms Tay also disclosed her misconduct at the first opportunity when she \nfiled her admission affidavit. She did this of her own accord notwithstanding \nthe fact that the Violation was filed as an internal disciplinary record within \nSMU and was not reflected on her academic transcript upon graduation. Indeed, \nit was not a matter that was made public at all. By voluntarily highlighting this \nincident in her admission affidavit, Ms Tay demonstrated an evident willingness \nto take responsibility for her mistake. This weighs strongly in her favour and \nsuggests to me that Ms Tay has learnt valuable lessons from her mistake and \nthat notwithstanding her lapse of judgment in her second year of university, she \ncan be considered a fit and proper person for admission at this time. Everyone \nVersion No 2: 10 Mar 2023 (16:49 hrs)\nRe Tay Jie Qi[2023] SGHC 59 \n9makes mistakes; the real question is whether one demonstrates the capacity to \nlearn from one\u2019s mistakes and in my judgment, Ms Tay has sufficiently \ndemonstrated that.\n19 Finally, I note that Ms Tay\u2019s admission hearing was originally fixed on \n23 August 2022, but she agreed to adjourn her admission hearing for three \nmonths. In my view, the three-month adjournment, assuming it was needed at \nall, would have afforded Ms Tay a further opportunity, in the specific context \nof seeking admission to the roll, to reflect on the importance of the attributes of \nhonesty and integrity in this profession. All the relevant stakeholders have \nindicated that they have no objections to her admission. In these circumstances, \nI allow her admission application in AAS 410.\nMs Low Shauna\n20 The applicant in AAS 572 is Ms Low Shauna (\u201cMs Low\u201d). Ms Low too \nis a graduate of SMU. In her affidavit for admission dated 30 September 2022, \nshe disclosed two incidents that occurred between 2016 and 2018 where she had \nbrushes with law enforcement.\nThe first incident\n21 The first incident occurred sometime in the period between the later part \nof 2016 and the early part of 2017. Ms Low was already a law student at SMU \nat that time. She attempted to steal an eyeshadow palette, worth around $50, \nfrom the Sephora store in ION Orchard. When she was leaving the store, she \nwas approached by the store\u2019s security guards. She immediately admitted to \nshoplifting and surrendered the eyeshadow palette. Subsequently, the security \nguards called the police who recorded a statement from Ms Low, in which she \nagain admitted that she had shoplifted. On 6 January 2017, the police issued Ms \nVersion No 2: 10 Mar 2023 (16:49 hrs)\nRe Tay Jie Qi[2023] SGHC 59 \n10Low a stern warning in lieu of prosecution and informed her that there would \nbe a sealed police record of the incident.\nThe second incident\n22 The second incident occurred sometime in 2017 or 2018. Ms Low had \ngone for a night out with her boyfriend, her sister and some other acquaintances. \nThe group was attempting to enter a club when a staff member of the club found \nsome suspected illegal substances in the bag of one of the persons in the group. \nThe whole group was arrested and brought into police custody. Ms Low was \nquestioned, tested for drugs, and released the next morning.\n23 According to Ms Low, she only found out after her release that a slab of \nXanax had been found in her sister\u2019s bag. The Xanax belonged another person \nin the group, who was seeing a psychiatrist at the time and had been prescribed \nXanax to cope with a medical issue, and who had asked Ms Low\u2019s sister to keep \nthe Xanax with her that night. After the drug test results were out, an officer \nfrom the Central Narcotics Bureau (\u201cCNB\u201d) informed the group that no further \naction would be taken against them.\nThe events leading up to AAS 572\n24 After Ms Low\u2019s initial disclosures, the Law Society sought some more \ninformation and Ms Low filed a supplementary affidavit on 26 October 2022 to \nprovide further details of the two incidents. \n25 On 31 October 2022, the AGC sent a letter to Ms Low stating its position \nthat Ms Low was not a fit and proper person to be admitted at that time and \ninvited her to adjourn her application for a period of three months. On 2 \nNovember 2022, Ms Low applied to adjourn the hearing of her admission \nVersion No 2: 10 Mar 2023 (16:49 hrs)\nRe Tay Jie Qi[2023] SGHC 59 \n11application (which was originally fixed on 9 November 2022) for three months. \nThe stakeholders did not object to her request and the adjournment was granted.\n26 During a CMC that was held on 31 January 2023, the AGC indicated \nthat it would not object to Ms Low\u2019s admission if she agreed to file a further \nsupplementary affidavit confirming that no new facts had arisen since her last \nsupplementary affidavit that affected her suitability to be admitted as an \nadvocate and solicitor. Ms Low duly filed a further supplementary affidavit on \n10 February 2023 confirming the same. The stakeholders have since indicated \nthat they have no objections to Ms Low\u2019s admission.\nWhether Ms Low is a fit and proper person to be admitted\n27 I begin by noting that the second incident disclosed by Ms Low has no \napparent relevance to her suitability to practice as an advocate and solicitor. \nThis is so given that (a) Ms Low has consistently maintained she did not know \nwhat transpired until after her release from custody; (b) there was a valid \nexplanation for the Xanax that was found in her sister\u2019s bag; (c) as it turned out \nthis had nothing at all to do with Ms Low; and (d) Ms Low tested negative for \ndrugs and no further action was taken against her. It follows from these \nconsiderations that the second incident does not show any aspect of Ms Low\u2019s \nconduct or character that affects her suitability to be admitted as an advocate \nand solicitor. All in all, it seems to have been an unfortunate incident, which she \nhad disclosed out of an abundance of caution.\n28 I turn then to the first incident, namely Ms Low\u2019s act of shoplifting, \nwhich is pertinent. Ms Low admitted in her supplementary affidavit that she \nfound the eyeshadow palette to be expensive and she \u201cattempted to shoplift said \nproduct by concealing it either in [her] bag or under [her jacket]\u201d. This reflects \ndishonesty, which is almost invariably seen as suggestive of underlying \nVersion No 2: 10 Mar 2023 (16:49 hrs)\nRe Tay Jie Qi[2023] SGHC 59 \n12character flaws that are incompatible with being admitted as an advocate and \nsolicitor. In our profession, clients invariably repose their trust and confidence \nin lawyers, in various ways, including to handle their money. It is essential in \nsuch circumstances, that lawyers act with the utmost integrity and moral \nfortitude at all times. This is also mandated by the nature of a lawyer\u2019s vocation, \nwhich is to aid in the administration of justice. \n29 That said, the question I must determine today is whether Ms Low has \nreflected on and remedied the character issues which surfaced in something she \ndid more than six years ago when she was 19 or 20 years old. In my judgment, \nnotwithstanding her brush with the law, Ms Low has demonstrated genuine \nremorse and has reformed herself in the intervening period preceding her \nadmission application. \n30 First, like Ms Tay, Ms Low has maintained a clean record since her \nmisconduct, more than six years ago. She graduated from SMU and passed her \nPart B examinations without any suggestion or complaints of dishonesty or \nmisconduct. Her clean record in the years after her brush with the law suggests \nthat she has learnt from her mistake and has taken steps to reflect on her mistake \nand on what she must do to reform herself. I stress again that the purpose of a \ndeferment in admission applications is not punitive, but rehabilitative. Where \nan applicant has, through a consistent course of conduct, demonstrated that she \nhas turned over a new leaf, there is no need or even basis for any further \ndeferment of her admission application to punish her. In each case, the need for \nsuch a deferment should be carefully assessed. It should not be insisted upon as \na matter of routine. And if appropriate, the request for an adjournment should \nbe explained so that the applicant understands why this is being sought and what \nshe must do to make the best use of that time.\nVersion No 2: 10 Mar 2023 (16:49 hrs)\nRe Tay Jie Qi[2023] SGHC 59 \n1331 Second, Ms Low has also been forthcoming in her disclosures and her \nwillingness to take responsibility for her mistake. During the initial \ninvestigations, Ms Low immediately confessed to shoplifting, cooperated with \nthe police and returned the eyeshadow palette. She also disclosed her \nwrongdoing to the court and the stakeholders at the first opportunity in her \nadmission affidavit. This is notwithstanding the fact that the police informed her \nthat her act of shoplifting would be noted in a sealed police record. The fact that \nMs Low nonetheless disclosed the episode in her admission affidavit \ndemonstrates her willingness to openly confront her mistake. This reveals a high \ndegree of candour and accountability on Ms Low\u2019s part, which are qualities that \nevery advocate and solicitor in Singapore should have. \n32 I am therefore satisfied that notwithstanding Ms Low\u2019s brush with the \nlaw more than six years ago, she has shown that she is a fit and suitable person \nwho may be permitted to practice as an advocate and solicitor in Singapore. All \nthe stakeholders have indicated that they have no objections to her admission. \nIn these circumstances, I allow her admission application in AAS 572.\nConclusion\n33 In conclusion, I allow both applications for admission in AAS 410 and \nAAS 572. Both applicants have demonstrated remorse and a sufficient capacity \nfor change and rehabilitation and have maintained clean records since their \nrespective misconduct. Both applicants have also been completely transparent \nin their respective disclosures and have shown their willingness to hold \nthemselves accountable for their mistakes. I also highlight that they both made \nvoluntary disclosures of matters that were apparently not in the public domain. \nI found the willingness of both these candidates to face up to their mistakes and \nto deal candidly and forthrightly with the court and with the stakeholders, \nVersion No 2: 10 Mar 2023 (16:49 hrs)\nRe Tay Jie Qi[2023] SGHC 59 \n14heartening.

He is a citizen and a resident of the United Kingdom. 2', 'He is in the business of real estate and product distribution. In the course of his business, he has invested in a large number of ventures worldwide. 3', 'This dispute arises from one such venture. The third defendant was incorporated to be the investment vehicle for this venture.', '8\\u2003The second defendant is a Singapore citizen 4', 'and a resident of Singapore. She was and continues to be an employee of Infinitus Law Corporation (\u201cILC\u201d), a law firm practising in Singapore. In the course of her employment, she accepts appointment as a nominee director of companies which ILC incorporates for its clients. Some of ILC\u2019s clients need a nominee director to satisfy s 145 of the Companies Act 1967 (2020 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe Companies Act\u201d). That section requires every company incorporated in Singapore to have at least one director who is resident in Singapore. The second defendant also accepts appointment as a nominee shareholder in companies which ILC incorporates for its clients. This is how the second defendant came to hold the Shares. She therefore accepts that she holds the Shares on trust and thus has no beneficial interest whatsoever in the Shares. 5', 'The question in this action is for whom she holds the Shares on trust.', '9\\u2003The third defendant was incorporated in Singapore in 2015. ILC carried out the incorporation. It did so in circumstances which I describe more fully below. The third defendant\u2019s incorporation documents name: (a) the second defendant as its initial and sole subscribing shareholder: and (b) the plaintiff, the first defendant and the second defendant as its initial directors. The third defendant\u2019s directors now are the second defendant and one Mr Mendel Gluck (\u201cMr Gluck\u201d).', '10\\u2003The term \u201cshareholder\u201d as I use it in this judgment will always mean a member of the third defendant whose name appears in the electronic register of the third defendant\u2019s members kept and maintained by the Registrar of Companies under s 196A of the Companies Act. My use of the term \u201cshareholder\u201d will therefore say nothing as to where lies the beneficial interest in the shares attributed to that shareholder in the electronic register.', '11\\u2003It is now necessary to introduce Mr Gluck. He is a citizen and resident of the United Kingdom. As I have mentioned, he was one of the initial directors of the third defendant. He has remained a director of the third defendant to date. 6', 'The plaintiff named Mr Gluck as a defendant when he commenced this action. His original statement of claim sought relief against both Mr Gluck and the first defendant for breach of contract, in the tort of conspiracy and for minority oppression under the Companies Act. 7', 'I struck out all of these claims before trial. 8', 'I allowed this action to proceed to trial only in so far as he claimed that the second defendant held one-third of the Shares on an express trust for him under or by reason of the 2015 Trust Deed. That claim does not involve Mr Gluck in any way. As a result, the plaintiff voluntarily discontinued this action against Mr Gluck. Mr Gluck is therefore no longer a defendant to this action. He was, however, a key witness for the first defendant at trial.', '12\\u2003I now set out the background to the parties\u2019 dispute.', '13\\u2003In 2011, the GOSL invited bids for a project to revive the then-defunct Kantale Sugar Factory (\u201cthe Project\u201d) in Sri Lanka. 9', 'The plaintiff was at that time a shareholder and director of KPN Hong Kong Limited (\u201cKPN HK\u201d). He decided to put in a bid for the Project using KPN HK as his vehicle. 10', 'The plaintiff was introduced to Mr Gluck. The two men entered into a joint venture agreement to bid for the Project. The lead technical collaborator for KPN HK\u2019s bid was Prabhulingeshwar Sugars and Chemical Limited (\u201cPrabhu Sugars\u201d). 11', 'The bid put in by the plaintiff\u2019s consortium was successful. However, the GOSL decided not to proceed with the Project.', '14\\u2003Despite this setback, the plaintiff did not give up on the Project. By 2015, he had persuaded the GOSL to consider reviving it. He then approached Mr Gluck to see whether he was still interested in investing in it. In May 2015, Mr Gluck indicated interest, subject to due diligence. 12', 'Mr Gluck\u2019s legal adviser for this purpose was Mr Aaron Jordan, a partner in the law firm Holman Fenwick Willan LLP. 13', '15\\u2003The difficulty was that the GOSL now required the successful bidder to invest US$100m in the Project and to furnish a performance guarantee of US$10m. These were substantial sums beyond the capacity of the joint venture which the plaintiff had entered into with Mr Gluck in 2011. They had to find additional investors. 14', '16\\u2003In June 2015, the GOSL formally awarded the Project to the plaintiff\u2019s consortium. 15', 'Following discussions with the GOSL, it was decided that the corporate structure for the Project would be as follows: 16', '17\\u2003In July 2015, the plaintiff set up the corporate structure for the Project. MG Sugars Lanka (Private) Limited (\u201cMG Sugars\u201d) was incorporated in Sri Lanka to serve as Project Co. 17', 'MG Holdings Lanka (Pvt) Limited (\u201cMG Holdings\u201d) was also incorporated in Sri Lanka to serve as Investor Co. 18', '18\\u2003In the meantime, Mr Gluck had approached the first defendant and his brother to see whether they were interested in investing in the Project. In July 2015, they indicated interest. 19', 'Mr Gluck\u2019s adviser for this purpose was Mr Richard Baldock (\u201cMr Baldock\u201d) of Stonehage Fleming. 20', 'Mr Baldock is a business consultant, not a lawyer, and Stonehage Fleming is a multifamily office, not a law firm. Nevertheless, it appears that Mr Baldock provided commercial and tax advice to Mr Gluck in the same way that a lawyer would, without going so far as to provide legal advice.', '19\\u2003Mr Baldock advised the first defendant that it would be more tax efficient to invest in the Project through a company incorporated in Singapore. 21', 'That company would then hold 49% of the Project with the GOSL holding the other 51%. It was accordingly decided to incorporate a company in Singapore to be the vehicle for investing in the Project. 22', 'The company incorporated pursuant to this decision was the third defendant.', '20\\u2003Mr Baldock was assisted by Mr Paul Weldon (\u201cMr Weldon\u201d), also of Stonehage Fleming. On 22 July 2015, Mr Weldon instructed ILC to incorporate the third defendant. 23', 'On 22 July 2015 and 23 July 2015, Ms Pamela Chong (\u201cMs Chong\u201d), a lawyer at ILC, carried out the usual preparatory steps for incorporating a company in Singapore. As a result, a number of events took place on 23 July 2015 which I now describe individually and in sequence.', '21\\u2003On the morning of 23 July 2015, ILC issued a tax invoice for its professional fees and disbursements for the incorporation. 24', 'The invoice was addressed personally to the first defendant.

That night, the third defendant was duly incorporated under the Companies Act. That event caused the third defendant to commence existence as a legal person and called the Shares into existence as property. The third defendant\u2019s initial share capital comprised three shares of US$1 each (\u201cthe Subscriber Shares\u201d). As I have mentioned, the second defendant held all of the Subscriber Shares as the sole subscriber to the third defendant\u2019s share capital.', '22\\u2003Also on 23 July 2015, the second defendant executed the 2015 Trust Deed. 26', 'By its express terms, she declared that she held the Subscriber Shares on trust for the plaintiff, the first defendant and Mr Gluck in equal shares: 27', '23\\u2003There is no practical difference for present purposes between the second defendant declaring that she held the three Subscriber Shares for the first defendant, Mr Gluck and the plaintiff in equal shares and the second defendant declaring that she held one of the three Subscriber Shares on trust for the plaintiff. I shall therefore treat the 2015 Trust Deed as the second defendant\u2019s declaration that she held one of the Subscriber Shares on trust for the plaintiff.', '24\\u2003Clause 2.2 of the 2015 Trust Deed sets out the second defendant\u2019s acknowledgment that Mr Gluck was the plaintiff\u2019s authorised representative on all matters concerning the Subscriber Shares:', '25\\u2003Also on 23 July 2015, the plaintiff, the first defendant and Mr Gluck executed a letter of indemnity.

The development of emotional or behavioural symptoms in \nresponse to an identifiable stressor(s) occurring within 3 \nmonths of the onset of the stressor(s).  \nB. These symptoms or behaviours are clinically significant, as \nevidenced by one or both of the following:  \n1. Marked distress that is out of proportion to the \nseverity or intensity of the stressor, taking into \naccount the e xternal context and the cultural factors \nthat might influence symptom severity and \npresentation.  \n \n35  PWS at para 54.  \n36  PWS at paras 93 to 99.  \n37  AB 5 , para 11 . \nVersion No 1: 17 Mar 2023 (10:33 hrs) \nPP v Mohamed Mub in bin Abdul Rahman  [2023] SGHC 60 \n \n \n12 2.

The stress -related disturbance does not meet the criteria for \nanother mental disorder and is not merely an exacerbation \nof a pre -existing mental disorder.  \nD. The symptoms do not represent normal bereavement . \nE. Once the stressor or its consequences have terminated, the \nsymptoms do not persist for more than an additional 6 \nmonths.  \n26 Dr Ung opined that Mubin fulfilled Criterion B1 of the Adjustment \nDisorder Diagnostic Criteria (\u201cCriterion B1\u201d),  that the distress shown was out \nof proportion to the severity or the intensity of the stressor , rather than  Criterion \nB2 of the Adjustment Diso rder Diagnostic Criteria (\u201cCriterion B2\u201d) , as he was \nable to \u201cfunction reasonably well\u201d in daily activities such as work and being \nable to enjoy leisure activities with others such as Tihani.38 \n27 Dr Ung made several  caveats. First , he acknowledged that there was a \nsignificant period of time between his interview with Mubin and the time of the \noffence. As such, there could be issues with accuracy due to memory distortion. \nSecondly, he acknowledged that some of what he was told by Mub in would \nhave been \u201cafterthoughts of a desperate man, of course, trying to save himself\u201d \nand that his opinion was predicated on the truthfulness of Mubin\u2019s reports. \nFinally, he reiterated that the assessment of what constitutes significant distress \nis subj ective and rests on the assessor, such that two assessors may reach \ndifferent conclusions as to whether the threshold of significant distress is \nreached.39 \n \n38  NE 4 February 2022 at p 23 ln 20 to ln 26; AB 5 to 6.  \n39  NE 4 Feb ruary 2022  at p 11 ln 24 to p 12 l n 11. \nVersion No 1: 17 Mar 2023 (10:33 hrs) \nPP v Mohamed Mub in bin Abdul Rahman  [2023] SGHC 60 \n \n \n13 Dr Cheok\u2019s opinion  \n28 Dr Cheok disagreed with Dr Ung\u2019s diagnosis because he disagreed that  \nCriterion B1  was fulfilled . Dr Cheok observed that \u201c[g]etting upset after \nquarrelling with a girlfriend is a normal, expected and understandable reaction \u201d, \nand further that \u201cbeing stressed after coming out of prison and having to readapt \nto society\u201d was similarly \u201cexp ected and understandable\u201d .40 Dr Cheok drew on \nthe fact that Mubin could ably find housing, maintain a relationship and earn a \nsteady income to show that he was able to adapt despite his challenges. For \nthose same reasons , Dr Cheok agreed with Dr Ung that C riterion B2 was not \nfulfilled .41 \nAnalysis  \n29 I did not find Dr Ung\u2019s evidence cogent for the following reasons . \n30 First, diagnosis requires a sound factual basis. Dr Ung premised his \nconclusion s on the sole basis of Mubin\u2019s own report of his mental state  some \nfour or five years prior . Sundaresh Menon CJ observed in Wong Tian Jun De \nBeers v Public Prosecutor [2022] 4 SLR 805  (\u201cDe Beers \u201d) at [21] that less \nweight should be placed on an expert report that is \u201cpredicated entirely on the \ntruthfulness of the information the [accused] provided\u2026 with no independent \ninformation he could rely on in the preparation of the report apart from the \nnarrative th e [accused] gave him\u201d.

I did not agree with the Defence \u2019s submission that Mubin\u2019s \u201cclear \nevidence\u201d at trial showed he was under marked distress, satisfying  Criterion \nB1.43 Criterion B1 , as set out  at [25] above, is concerned with a person\u2019s \nreaction , which must be out of proportion  to the severity of the identified \nstressors . Dr Cheok\u2019s report  explains :44  \n\u2026 The diagnosis of Adjustment Disorder requires \u201cMarked \ndistress that is out of proportion to the severity or intensity of \nthe stressor\u201d and\/or \u201cSignificant impairment in social, \noccupational or other important areas of functioning.\u201d In this \nrespect, the stress and sadness he felt were normal reactions to \nthe situation and not marked nor out of proportion.  There was no \nimpairment of social and occupational functioning. The \nemotional symptoms he felt as well as the poor sleep can also \nbe caused by methamphetamine use which is known to cause \nanxiety, tensi on, anger and insomnia.  \n[emphasis added]  \n32 Mubin\u2019s testimony did not reflect the necessary disproportionate \nresponse :45 \nQ  And these quarrels, they made you ---how did they make \nyou feel?  \nA  Your Honour , I felt frustrated  and at the same time \nstressed, Your Honour, because this matter keep on \nbugging me, Your Honour.

As \nsuch, Your Honour, all this thing bothers me, Your \nHonour. All I can do is to have patience with my life,  Your \nHonour.  \n[emphasis added]  \n33 In his First R eport , Dr Ung placed emphasis on how \u201cmarked distress\u201d \nwas subjective , allowing him to place reliance on a person\u2019s self -report. H e did \nnot explain how Mubin\u2019s self -reported stress crossed into the threshold of \nmarked distress , stating generically:46 \nThe chronic nature of his stress with respect to his aplastic \nanaemia and its sequelae (tiredness) as well as the relationship \nstresses with his girlfriend would be consistent to the \ndevelopment of an adjustment disorder (when his coping \nreserves become exhausted) at some point . \n[emphasis added]   \nThere was no specificity in the t ime of onset of the adjustment disorder or how \nit was concluded that these factors led to the marked distress that was the subject \nof the paragraph.  \n34 When cross -examined,  Dr Ung relied on Mubin\u2019s substance abuse in \nresponse to stress as an example of a disp roportionate response. The logical \n \n46  AB 6, para 14 . \nVersion No 1: 17 Mar 2023 (10:33 hrs) \nPP v Mohamed Mub in bin Abdul Rahman  [2023] SGHC 60 \n \n \n16 nexus of this assertion was not established; the following revealed that Dr Ung\u2019s \nassertion  was in the nature of an assumption :47 \nYah. So I mean, you know, as you said, you know, anybody ---\nmost people would feel stress wh en they quarrel with their \ngirlfriend and, you know, they deal with it. However, if the, you \nknow, you quarrel with your girlfriend and you start to take \nillegal drugs, then that might be considered, you know, a \ndisproportionate response.  \n\u2026 \nSo what I\u2019m try ing to say is that, you know, I mean I presume \nthe quarrels have been going on but ---and he had been dealing \nwith it. He had been not lapsing back. However, it got to the \nstage where he then felt unable to then control himself or ---\nbecause of the level of distress and then to self -medicate by \ntaking his methamphetamine, then that would be a possible \nexample of a disproportionate response . Now, when I said that \nhe told me that he took methamphetamine to alleviate his \nphysical state, I believe again from memo ry he also did say that \nhe took methamphetamine to also alleviate his mental distress.  \n[emphasis added]  \n35 Dr Cheok, to the contrary, was of the view that Mubin used drugs as a \nhabitual way of dealing with stress, explaining :48 \n\u2026 when a person quarrels with their partner, it is not surprising \nif someone feels stressed, yah, and unless the stress is so \nextreme, we wouldn\u2019t ---we will say that this is a normal, \nexpected reaction to that particular incident, yah. For someone \nto consume  drugs, especially with a background, given the \naccused\u2019s history of repeated drug use, this is actually not \nsurprising, because he ---this is his habitual way of dealing with \nstressful situations , to consume substances\u2026.  \n\u2026 disproportionate response, for ex ample, we see this type of \nsituation in our emergency rooms every day, not just at I ---I \nmean, at IMH or in our clinical work. When someone is very, \nvery stressed, the person may attempt self -harm, may cut \nthemselves, or some people even lose their ability  to move their \nlimbs for a short period of time. Some ---some people start going \ninto a dazed state, and they can\u2019t communicate.

But to merely fee l stressed \nafter a quarrel with your partner, I think this is part of our \neveryday, normal human experience.  \n[emphasis added]  \n36 Mubin himself identified various reasons for his use of \nmethamphetamine, not simply to cope with stress, but also to relax, to focus on \nhis work ,49 and to improve his sexual prowess.50 For example, he explained in \ncross -examination :51 \nQ Thank you.

As an order has been made for any judgment published in this action to be redacted, the identities of the parties and other pertinent details relevant to the dispute have been redacted or anonymised.', '8\\u2003The claimant, a construction company incorporated in Ruritania, was engaged to carry out dredging and land reclamation works in certain areas of Ruritania City Port. By means of an agreement dated 12 May 2017 (the \u201cContract\u201d), the claimant sub-contracted the dredging works to the defendant, a marine engineering company specialising in offshore construction. 1', 'The governing law of the Contract was English law, and the dispute resolution clause provided for arbitration seated in Singapore under the rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre. 2', '9\\u2003Under the Contract, the defendant was to deploy four vessels to carry out the dredging works: a trailing suction hopper dredger (the \u201cHopper\u201d), a cutter suction dredger (the \u201cCutter\u201d) and two split hopper barges (the \u201cBarges\u201d) (collectively, the \u201cVessels\u201d). The Hopper would be used to dredge loose and soft soils like sand, gravel, silt or clay. Harder soils and rocks which could not be cleared by the Hopper would be dredged by the Cutter and discharged onto the Barges. The Barges would then dispose of the dredged material at a designated dumping area. 3', '10\\u2003Pursuant to Art 6.1 of the Contract, the works were to be completed within a 90-day period (the \u201cTime for Completion\u201d) from the commencement date. It is undisputed that the commencement date was 26 May 2017, such that the works were to be completed by 24 August 2017. 4', '11\\u2003Central to the dispute was Art 3.9 of the Contract, which states:', '12\\u2003Over the course of the engagement, there were several stoppages to the operation of the Vessels owing to various incidents. The defendant subsequently sought an extension of time and, more significantly, compensation from the claimant under Art 3.9 in respect of these stoppages. For present purposes, the relevant incidents were (a) delay in the mobilisation of the Cutter and Barges arising from problems in obtaining the required permits, and (b) the evacuation of the Vessels from the work site to avoid a typhoon. It is also apposite to mention at this point that notwithstanding the delays, the defendant completed the works on 26 August 2017, exceeding the Time for Completion by two days. 5', '13\\u2003Disputes arose between the parties in relation to the defendant\u2019s entitlement to compensation and an extension of time under Art 3.9 for the various delays and disruptions to the operation of the Vessels. On 26 October 2018, the defendant commenced arbitration proceedings against the claimant under the Contract (the \u201cArbitration\u201d). 6', 'After some complications with the appointment of arbitrators arising from the demise of the arbitrator initially nominated by the claimant, the Tribunal was constituted.', '14\\u2003The defendant (ie, the claimant in the Arbitration) sought, inter alia, compensation under Art 3.9 in respect of several incidents: (a) the delay in procuring import permits for the split hopper barges (the \u201cImport Delay Claim\u201d), (b) the evacuation of the Vessels to evade a typhoon (the \u201cTyphoon Claim\u201d), (c) a change in the reclamation sequence for the project, and (d) the claimant\u2019s failure to maintain access to the dumping area for the split hopper barges. 7', 'The claimant (as the respondent in the Arbitration), completely denied any liability under Art 3.9.', '15\\u2003The claimant locked horns with the defendant on several aspects of the Art 3.9 claim. Firstly, the claimant disagreed with the defendant on the proper interpretation of Art 3.9, namely whether (as the defendant argued) the provision entitled the defendant to compensation for stoppages, regardless of whether they prevented the defendant from completing the works within the Time for Completion (the \u201cInterpretation Issue\u201d). I simply note at this point that the claimant has sought to argue in this application that the defendant did not initially advance this interpretation of Art 3.9. I will elaborate on this below. Secondly, the claimant disputed each of the four incidents of delay, essentially on grounds that they either did not amount to a \u201cstoppage\u201d under Art 3.9, were caused by reasons falling within one of the exceptions in Art 3.9, or otherwise constituted force majeure events under Art 22 of the Contract.', '16\\u2003For completeness, the claimant also made a counterclaim in the Arbitration against the defendant for breaching its obligation to endeavour to complete the works within the Time for Completion. 8', 'As the Tribunal\u2019s decision on the claimant\u2019s counterclaim is of no relevance for the purposes of the application before me, I say no more on it.', '17\\u2003The Tribunal issued the Award on 4 May 2022. 9', 'On the defendant\u2019s claim under Art 3.9, which is the only part of the Award relevant to this application, the Tribunal was split. The majority of the Tribunal (the \u201cMajority\u201d) agreed with the defendant\u2019s interpretation of Art 3.9, viz, that it entitled the defendant to compensation regardless of whether the stoppages prevented it from completing the works before the Time for Completion expired. The Majority decided that the claimant was liable to pay compensation (together with interest and costs) to the defendant in respect of all the incidents that caused stoppages.', '18\\u2003The presiding arbitrator issued a dissenting opinion (the \u201cDissenting Opinion\u201d). He disagreed with the Majority\u2019s interpretation of Art 3.9, and consequently found that the claimant was not liable to pay compensation for any of the stoppages. As the claimant relies heavily on the Dissenting Opinion in its objections to the Majority\u2019s decision on the interpretation of Art 3.9, I will discuss the Dissenting Opinion in greater detail below.'"}

The respondent employed three drivers and rented two vans on behalf of IK Enterprise for its business. One week before the events for which the respondent was charged, all the drivers employed by 1K Enterprise resigned, leaving it with no drivers to undertake deliveries. Notwithstanding this, respondent continued to accept orders from existing customers. However, no orders were accepted from new customers.', '5\\u2003On 6 September 2020, the respondent left his home at about 10am to deliver several parcels. He drove a van leased by 1K Enterprise. At about 3pm on the same day, the respondent, driving the same van, returned home to fetch his wife and three children for dinner. After picking up his family, the respondent proceeded to deliver a parcel before exiting onto Woodlands Close towards Woodlands Avenue 12. It was about 4:24pm then. As it was raining, the roads were wet.', '6\\u2003The respondent approached a red-light signal where a car driven by a Mr Chea Seek Kang (\u201cMr Chea\u201d) had come to a stop. However, the respondent failed to keep a proper look out and did not come to a complete stop when forming up behind Mr Chea\u2019s car. As a result, there was a minor collision between the van and Mr Chea\u2019s car. There was no visible damage to the van and minor damage to the rear of Mr Chea\u2019s car. No injuries were suffered.', '7\\u2003The respondent attempted to settle the accident with Mr Chea. Mr Chea, however, refused and pressed the respondent for his driving licence. The respondent refused, and instead returned to the van and drove off with his family. A police car in the vicinity was alerted to the collision and gave chase. Realising this, the respondent drove to a multi-storey car park near his home and parked. He then ran off in an attempt to evade arrest, leaving his family (ie, his wife and three children) behind in the van. When the police located the van, the respondent\u2019s family was still inside.', '8\\u2003Investigations revealed that the respondent only possessed a Provisional Driving License and had in fact failed a Class 3 test (manual transmission) once and a Class 3A test (automatic transmission) twice. In other words, the respondent did not possess a valid driving licence and was unqualified to drive the van. As the respondent did not have a valid driving licence, there was also no motor insurance policy that covered the respondent at the material time.', '9\\u2003The respondent faced five charges in relation to the driving offences committed on 6 September 2020. He pleaded guilty on 2 August 2021 before the DJ to the following three charges:', '10\\u2003The respondent also consented to having the remaining two charges of (a) failing to exchange particulars after the accident under s 84(1)(a) RTA; and (b) failing to make a police report within 24 hours of the accident under s 84(2) RTA taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing.', '11\\u2003Before the DJ, the Prosecution sought a custodial sentence of four to eight weeks\u2019 imprisonment and a disqualification period of two to three years for the s 35 Charge. The Prosecution submitted, first, that by increasing the sentencing range for offences under s 35(1) RTA pursuant to the Amendment Act, Parliament displayed an intention to strengthen deterrence against irresponsible (including unlicensed) driving, and second, that general deterrence was essential to protect the public from unlicensed driving. The Prosecution also submitted that specific deterrence was an important consideration in the present case for the following reasons:', 'The Prosecution further submitted that the fact that the respondent was a first offender was not a mitigating factor.', '12\\u2003The respondent was unrepresented before the DJ. In mitigation, he explained that he had left the van \u201cto avoid the penalty that [would] be given to the company that [he] was running\u201d. He further explained that he had driven off because there was a \u201cspark of argument during the incident\u201d and he wished to avoid any \u201cfighting\u201d. Nonetheless, the respondent conceded that he drove away because he \u201cbasically, [did not] have any valid licence to show to [Mr Chea]\u201d.', '13\\u2003The DJ imposed the following sentences on the respondent:', '(a)\\u2003On the s 35 Charge, a fine of $8,000 or, in default, four weeks\u2019 imprisonment, and disqualification of 24 months with effect from 2 August 2021.', '(b)\\u2003On the Second Charge, a fine of $1,000 or, in default, five days\u2019 imprisonment, and disqualification of three months with effect from 2 August 2021.', '(c)\\u2003On the Third Charge, a fine of $800 or, in default, four days\u2019 imprisonment and disqualification of 12 months with effect from 2 August 2021.', 'The total sentence imposed was thus a fine of $9,800 or, in default, four weeks and nine days\u2019 imprisonment, and disqualification from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of 24 months with effect from 2 August 2021.', '14\\u2003In arriving at her decision, the DJ made the following observations that are relevant to MA 9176:', '(a)\\u2003First, the usual sentence for a first offender under s 35(1) RTA (both before and after the Amendment Act) was a fine. The fines ranged from $600 to $800 for offences committed prior to the Amendment Act, and $1,500 to $1,800 for offences committed after the Amendment Act.', '(b)\\u2003Second, while the increase in the punishments introduced by the Amendment Act did not necessarily necessitate an increase in sentences, the parliamentary debates during the second reading of the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill 2019 (the bill upon which the Amendment Act was based) demonstrated Parliament\u2019s intention to amend the RTA to more strongly deter against irresponsible driving, including unlicensed driving.', '(c)\\u2003Third, the increase in the sentencing range introduced by the Amendment Act gave the court greater latitude in sentencing. In particular, egregious irresponsible driving, which might not have been sufficiently punished previously, could now be properly addressed. Nonetheless, the increase did not necessarily mean that a custodial term should be imposed. Deterrence need not necessarily take the form of a custodial sentence and a high fine might well be appropriate in the circumstances.', '15\\u2003As mentioned at [2] above, the Prosecution only appealed against the DJ\u2019s decision to impose a fine of $8,000 for the s 35 Charge. No appeal was brought against the 24-month disqualification period that she imposed.', '16\\u2003At the first hearing of MA 9176 on 25 February 2022, the Prosecution sought a custodial sentence of between four and eight weeks for the s 35 Charge on the basis that a fine was manifestly inadequate. The Prosecution submitted that a custodial sentence was appropriate in view of the increase in sentencing range introduced by the Amendment Act. The Prosecution further submitted that guidance from this court on when the custodial threshold would be crossed for an offence under s 35(1) RTA would be appropriate. The respondent was unrepresented and made no submissions.', '17\\u2003The Prosecution, however, acknowledged that following the Amendment Act, there were difficulties in determining a consistent sentencing approach, in particular, the circumstances under which a custodial sentence would be warranted for an offence under s 35(1) RTA. The Prosecution brought to my attention the fact that, despite the increase in the sentencing range for offences under s 35 RTA, the vast majority of sentences continued to cluster around a fine, with custodial sentences being rare. In view of these precedents, the Prosecution acknowledged its difficulty in justifying its submission that a custodial sentence of four to eight weeks was appropriate in this case.', '18\\u2003As such, I had difficulty accepting the Prosecution\u2019s submission on sentence without further assistance. I decided that the appointment of a young amicus curiae (\u201cYAC\u201d) would be of assistance to the court and adjourned the appeal for this reason. I also mentioned at the hearing on 25 February 2022 that it would be helpful for the respondent to obtain legal representation and the Prosecution kindly agreed to assist with the respondent\u2019s application to the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme. Subsequently, on 17 March 2022, Mr Aaron Lee (\u201cMr Lee\u201d) was appointed to represent the respondent.', '19\\u2003Mr Sim Bing Wen (\u201cMr Sim\u201d) was appointed as YAC on 7 March 2022. Three questions were posed to him:', '(a)\\u2003Is a sentencing framework appropriate for s 35(1) RTA and, if so, what form should the sentencing framework take?

Gobi\u2019s defence counsel at the time was Mr Shashi Nathan.', '6\\u2003At trial, the sole issue before the High Court was whether Gobi had rebutted the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA (the \u201cs 18(2) MDA presumption\u201d). Section 18(2) of the MDA states:', '7\\u2003At first instance, Gobi\u2019s case was that he thought the Drugs were a form of mild controlled drug mixed with chocolate, and thus that he did not know that the Drugs were a Class A controlled drug. The Prosecution\u2019s case was that Gobi \u201cknew or was wilfully blind as to the nature of the drugs\u201d [emphasis added]: see Public Prosecutor v Gobi a\/l Avedian [2017] SGHC 145 (\u201cGobi (Trial)\u201d) at [2]. At the conclusion of the trial, the High Court found Gobi\u2019s testimony credible, and that he had rebutted the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA: see Gobi (Trial) at [53]. The High Court accordingly acquitted Gobi on the charge that was brought but convicted him on an amended lesser charge of attempting to import the Drugs believing it to be a controlled drug under Class C. Gobi was sentenced to 15 years\u2019 imprisonment and ten strokes of the cane on the amended charge and acquitted of the capital charge.', '8\\u2003The Prosecution appealed against Gobi\u2019s acquittal on the capital charge in CA\/CCA 20\/2017 (\u201cCCA 20\u201d). The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and held that Gobi had failed to rebut the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA. On 25 October 2018, it set aside Gobi\u2019s conviction on the amended charge and convicted Gobi of the original capital charge: see Public Prosecutor v Gobi a\/l Avedian [2019] 1 SLR 113 (\u201cGobi (Appeal)\u201d).', '9\\u2003Mr Ravi began acting for Gobi in September 2019. On 3 January 2020, he filed on behalf of Gobi an application for leave to commence criminal review proceedings against the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in Gobi (Appeal) pursuant to s 394H of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (the \u201cCPC\u201d). The Court of Appeal granted leave for Gobi to file a review application pursuant to s 394I of the CPC. On 25 February 2020, Gobi duly filed CA\/CM 3\/2020 (\u201cCM 3\u201d), seeking a review of Gobi (Appeal).', '10\\u2003This application was premised on a separate decision of the Court of Appeal in Adili Chibuike Ejike v Public Prosecutor [2019] 2 SLR 254 (\u201cAdili\u201d) that had been released some months earlier on 27 May 2019, but some months after the Court of Appeal rendered its decision in Gobi (Appeal). In Adili, the accused person had appealed against the High Court\u2019s decision convicting him of trafficking in a capital amount of methamphetamine and sentencing him to the mandatory death penalty. Both at first instance and on appeal, the Prosecution relied on the presumption of possession under s 18(1) of the MDA, which provides that:', '11\\u2003The Prosecution\u2019s case, however, was that the accused had been wilfully blind to the existence of the drugs in question. The Court of Appeal held that the Prosecution could not invoke the s 18(1) MDA presumption in relation to wilful blindness because the s 18(1) presumption was a presumption of fact while the doctrine of wilful blindness was a construct of law which described a mental state falling short of actual knowledge but that was treated as its legal equivalent. The Court of Appeal, however, left open the question of whether the same was true of s 18(2) of the MDA: see Adili at [69].', '12\\u2003Separately, Mr Ravi on 28 January 2020 filed HC\/OS 111\/2020 (\u201cOS 111\u201d) on behalf of Gobi and one Datchinamurthy a\/l Kataiah (\u201cDatchinamurthy\u201d). Datchinamurthy too had been sentenced to the mandatory death sentence after being convicted of trafficking in a quantity of drugs exceeding the threshold for the imposition of capital punishment: see Public Prosecutor v Christeen d\/o Jayamany and another [2015] SGHC 126. Gobi and Datchinamurthy sought (amongst other orders) a prohibitory order to stay their executions in the light of their allegations that executions were being carried out by prison officials kicking prisoners on the back of the neck.', '13\\u2003On 4 February 2020, a pre-trial conference was convened at the request of Mr Wong Woon Kwong of the AGC (\u201cMr Wong\u201d). Mr Wong sought urgent hearing dates on account of the gravity of the allegations contained in OS 111. In particular, Mr Wong added that he was \u201c... instructed to state that we are expressly reserving all our rights against Mr Ravi\u201d (the \u201cReservation Statement\u201d). Mr Ravi sought to clarify the meaning of the Reservation Statement during the hearing, but was directed by the Assistant Registrar to seek clarifications from the AGC thereafter.', '14\\u2003On 10 February 2020, Mr Ravi filed HC\/OS 181\/2020 (\u201cOS 181\u201d) on behalf of Gobi and Datchinamurthy, seeking a declaration that the Reservation Statement constituted a breach of their right to a fair hearing. OS 111 and OS 181 were heard together on 13 February 2020 and dismissed.', '15\\u2003Returning to Gobi\u2019s review application, CM 3 was heard by a five-Judge panel of the Court of Appeal on 19 October 2020. Brief grounds of the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment were delivered on the same day (the \u201cBrief Grounds\u201d), setting out its reasons for setting aside Gobi\u2019s conviction on the capital charge and reinstating Gobi\u2019s conviction on the amended charge imposed in Gobi (Trial). At [9] of its Brief Grounds, the Court of Appeal made the following observation:', '16\\u2003The Court of Appeal then found that the Prosecution\u2019s case had changed from one of wilful blindness at trial to one of actual knowledge on appeal. In this regard, the Court of Appeal observed that \u201c[t]his change in the Prosecution\u2019s case was ultimately prejudicial to [Gobi] because he was never squarely confronted with the case that he did not in fact believe what he had been told by [the relevant persons], and so he could not have responded to such a case\u201d (see the Brief Grounds at [20]). As the Prosecution\u2019s case at trial was premised on wilful blindness, the court held that the Prosecution was not entitled to rely on the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA at all.', '17\\u2003The Court of Appeal\u2019s full written judgment in Gobi (Review) was released after the hearing of CM 3.', '18\\u2003Shortly after the delivery of the Brief Grounds on 19 October 2020, Mr Ravi was interviewed by TOC Asia outside the Supreme Court building (the \u201cInterview\u201d). When requested to comment on Gobi\u2019s criminal proceedings, Mr Ravi made the following remarks:', 'We refer to the statement in italics above as the \u201cFirst Interview Statement\u201d; to the statement in bold above as the \u201cSecond Interview Statement\u201d; and to the underlined statement above as the \u201cThird Interview Statement\u201d. These three statements are collectively referred to as the \u201cInterview Statements.\u201d', '19\\u2003A video recording of the Interview was published on TOC Asia\u2019s website and Facebook page on the same day. Excerpts of the Interview were also cited in an accompanying article titled \u201cCourt of Appeal sets aside death sentence of Malaysian inmate, cites miscarriage of justice\u201d.', '20\\u2003On 20 October 2020, the DAG wrote to Mr Ravi, referring to the Interview Statements (the \u201cDAG\u2019s Letter\u201d). The DAG informed Mr Ravi that the Interview Statements contained serious allegations that the Public Prosecutor had acted in bad faith or maliciously in the prosecution of Gobi, and alleged that Mr Ravi was aware that such allegations were false and inflammatory. The DAG also sought an apology and retraction of the Interview Statements by Mr Ravi.', '21\\u2003Later that day, Mr Ravi uploaded the DAG\u2019s Letter in a Facebook post (the \u201cFirst Facebook Post\u201d). The material parts of the First Facebook Post are as follows:', 'We refer to the statement in italics above as the \u201cFirst Facebook Statement\u201d; to the statement in bold above as the \u201cSecond Facebook Statement\u201d; and to the underlined statement above as the \u201cThird Facebook Statement\u201d. These statements are collectively referred to as the \u201cFacebook Statements\u201d.', '22\\u2003On 22 October 2020, Mr Ravi replied to the DAG\u2019s Letter (the \u201cReply Letter\u201d). In the Reply Letter, Mr Ravi acknowledged that he had made the Interview Statements but rejected the allegation in the DAG\u2019s Letter that the statements had been made with the knowledge that they were false, or that any obligations under the LPA and the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 (S 706\/2015) (the \u201cPCR\u201d) had been breached when he made those statements. He maintained that there was sufficient basis, \u201cboth objective and subjective\u201d, for the statements to be made. Accordingly, Mr Ravi took the position that the AGC\u2019s requests for a public apology and retraction of the relevant statements were \u201cnot only plainly without basis, but also insulting given the fact that [the AGC had] treated Gobi\u2019s life with such a blatant disregard, whom [Mr Ravi] was trying to save at the eleventh hour and which he eventually succeeded\u201d. He concluded the Reply Letter by stating that \u201c[r]egardless of the Prosecution\u2019s apology\u2026, we have firm instructions from Gobi and his family to commence legal action and enforce his rights against [the AG, the DAG], and members of the Prosecution who had carriage of this matter in Gobi (Appeal) and Gobi (Review)\u201d.', '23\\u2003Mr Ravi uploaded the Reply Letter in a Facebook post on the same day. In that post (the \u201cSecond Facebook Post\u201d), he reiterated that he had been instructed to commence legal action (as set out in the foregoing paragraph).', '24\\u2003On 4 November 2020, Mr Ravi commenced HC\/S 1068\/2020 (\u201cSuit 1068\u201d) on behalf of Gobi against the AG, the DAG, and the prosecutors who had carriage of the Gobi proceedings (collectively referred to as the \u201cAG et al\u201d). It was alleged that the AG et al had committed the tort of misfeasance in public office and were in breach of their statutory duty under the PCR. The AG et al successfully applied to strike out the Statement of Claim in Suit 1068 and the action was dismissed by the High Court.', '25\\u2003On 23 October 2020 (one day after the Second Facebook Post was published), the DAG referred a complaint against Mr Ravi to the Law Society pursuant to s 85(3)(b) of the LPA (the \u201cComplaint\u201d). The Complaint was made in relation to the Interview Statements, the First Facebook Post and the Second Facebook Post, and requested that the Law Society refer the matter to a disciplinary tribunal. Following the Complaint, the Council of the Law Society applied to the Chief Justice to appoint a disciplinary tribunal. The DT was constituted to investigate the Complaint on 25 March 2021.', '26\\u2003The Law Society preferred four primary and three alternative charges against Mr Ravi (collectively, the \u201cCharges\u201d). The first charge concerned Mr Ravi\u2019s First to Third Interview Statements, and read as follows (the \u201cFirst Charge\u201d):', '27\\u2003The second charge and second alternative charge pertained to Mr Ravi\u2019s First and Second Facebook Statements (the \u201cSecond Charge\u201d and \u201cSecond Alternative Charge\u201d respectively):', '28\\u2003The third charge and third alternative charge concerned Mr Ravi\u2019s Third Facebook Statement, which was directed at the Law Society (the \u201cThird Charge\u201d and \u201cThird Alternative Charge\u201d respectively):', '29\\u2003The fourth charge and fourth alternative charge related to Mr Ravi\u2019s Reply Letter (the \u201cFourth Charge\u201d and \u201cFourth Alternative Charge\u201d respectively):', '30\\u2003Following the hearing before the DT, which took place from 28 to 29 July 2021, the DT released its findings in its report dated 20 December 2021 (the \u201cDT Report\u201d).', '31\\u2003In relation to the First Charge, the DT considered that the key issue was whether the Interview Statements constituted fair criticism. This was Mr Ravi\u2019s sole defence to the First Charge before the DT. In the DT\u2019s determination, whether the Interview Statements constituted fair criticism depended in turn on whether Mr Ravi had \u201cany rational basis\u201d for making these statements. The DT found it relevant to consider the factors set out in Attorney-General v Tan Liang Joo John and others [2009] 2 SLR(R) 1132 at [15]\u2013[23] (and affirmed by the Court of Appeal in Shadrake Alan v Attorney-General [2011] 3 SLR 778) in the context of the law of contempt of court. Applying these factors, the DT found that Mr Ravi had a rational basis for making all three Interview Statements and that the First Charge was not made out.', '32\\u2003In relation to the Second Charge, the DT found that Mr Ravi had failed to treat the AG et al with courtesy and fairness in breach of s 83(2)(b)(i) of the LPA read with r 7(2) of the PCR, by publicly communicating his intention to commence an action against them in the First Facebook Post. In this regard, the DT accepted Mr Ravi\u2019s explanation that the use of the word \u201cwrongdoers\u201d referred to those responsible for the commission of a civil rather than a criminal wrong, and that the Second Facebook Statement was not a threat made by Mr Ravi to commence legal proceedings. The DT found, however, that it was not proper of Mr Ravi to have made allegations of misconduct without referring the matter to the appropriate body.', '33\\u2003For the Third Charge, the DT found that Mr Ravi, by making the Third Facebook Statement, had acted in a manner contrary to a legal practitioner\u2019s position as a member of an honourable profession pursuant to s 83(2)(h) of the LPA read with r 8(3)(b) of the PCR. In the DT\u2019s view, the Third Facebook Statement constituted a threat against the Law Society and an accusation that it was complicit in alleged \u201charassment\u201d by the AG. The fact that Mr Ravi had made the statement in a public forum also compounded the severity of his misconduct.', '34\\u2003In relation to the Fourth Charge, the DT relied on its reasoning with respect to the Second Charge to find that Mr Ravi had similarly breached s 83(2)(b)(i) of the LPA read with r 7(2) of the PCR.', '35\\u2003In the round, however, the DT determined that there was no cause of sufficient gravity disclosed by Mr Ravi\u2019s misconduct, as the misconduct in question did not \u201cinvolve dishonesty ... trustworthiness or moral turpitude, or a conviction for a criminal offence\u201d. It ordered that Mr Ravi pay a monetary penalty, pursuant to s 93(1)(b)(i) of the LPA, comprising the following sums:', '36\\u2003Dissatisfied with this result, the Attorney-General proceeded to file HC\/OS 41\/2022 (\u201cOS 41\u201d) on 18 January 2022. OS 41 was an application to review the DT\u2019s findings in relation to the First Charge pursuant to s 97(1) of the LPA.', '37\\u2003OS 41 was heard on 5 and 12 May 2022 before a judge of the General Division of the High Court (the \u201cJudge\u201d), who dismissed OS 41 and found that the Interview Statements did not necessarily imply that the Prosecution had acted with malice, in bad faith or improperly: see Attorney-General v Ravi s\/o Madasamy and another [2022] SGHC 180 (\u201cAG v Ravi\u201d). In particular, the Judge was of the view that (see AG v Ravi at [31]):', '38\\u2003Two days after OS 41 was filed, the Law Society filed the present application on 20 January 2022 for Mr Ravi to be dealt with pursuant to s 83(1) of the LPA.', '39\\u2003With this background in mind, we turn to consider the parties\u2019 cases in OS 2.'"}

He was the sole director and shareholder of GCX. To acquire operating capital for GCX, the plaintiff obtained loans from his brother, Rio Christian (\u201cRC\u201d) and other individuals. 1', 'GCX had, up to 28 July 2020, an exemption from holding a licence under the Payment Services Act 2019 (\u201cPSA\u201d) for the provision of a digital payment token service. 2', '3\\u2003The defendant was, at all material times, the managing director of Qrypt Technologies Pte Ltd (\u201cQrypt\u201d), a company that was engaged in the business of \u201cdigital assets, blockchain, cryptocurrency and\/or management consultancy services\u201d. 3', '4\\u2003The defendant was introduced to the plaintiff and GCX by RC. It appears that between July 2019 and May 2020, the defendant concluded a number of transactions with GCX for the sale of cryptocurrencies. 4', 'According to the plaintiff, after 28 July 2020, GCX ceased business, and the plaintiff began to liquidate the leftover cryptocurrencies in his personal capacity and returned the outstanding loans. 5', '5\\u2003On 1 December 2020, the defendant contacted the plaintiff to ask if the plaintiff had some S$320,000.00 worth of Bitcoin to sell. The plaintiff confirmed that he had, and they made arrangements to conduct the transaction at the defendant\u2019s office that afternoon where they confirmed the price of the Bitcoin (12.14 Bitcoin in exchange for S$320,000.00). The plaintiff was accompanied by Mr Phoon Chee Kong (\u201cNik\u201d). The plaintiff transferred the 12.14 Bitcoin to the cryptocurrency wallet specified by the defendant. 6', '6\\u2003The problem arose after the transfer. The plaintiff wanted to take the S$320,000.00 in cash, which had been placed at the table, and leave. However, he was stopped by three other male individuals in the defendant\u2019s office. One of the three men told the plaintiff and Nik that the cash belonged to him and that they could not leave the premises until he had received his United States Dollars Tether (\u201cUSDT\u201d) (ie, a cryptocurrency). 7', 'According to the plaintiff, he agreed to wait for the transaction to be completed. 8', '7\\u2003After almost an hour, the defendant said that the person to whom he had transferred the Bitcoin to had deleted their Telegram chat. Chaos erupted. A quarrel broke out as to who was entitled to the S$320,000.00 in cash. The plaintiff called the police, who arrived shortly thereafter. 9', 'The plaintiff eventually left the defendant\u2019s office without the S$320,000.00 and bereft of 12.14 Bitcoin.', '8\\u2003The above narrative contains the undisputed facts. The rest of the facts are hotly disputed by the parties. It was clear, however, that this was a transaction for cryptocurrency gone awry. Putting aside the various distractions, specifically, the allegations that there was a scam, it is clear that the heart of this dispute is essentially a claim in contract, and in the alternative, unjust enrichment.', '9\\u2003I turn now to set out parties\u2019 respective cases.'"}
{"casename":"2023_SGHC_67","fact":"'2\\u2003The Company, incorporated in 1999 by the defendant, was in the supermarket business. 1', 'The defendant owns 85% of its shares (850,000 shares), while the plaintiff owns 8% of its shares (80,000 shares). Of the remaining 7% shareholding, 5% is held by the plaintiff\u2019s mother (50,000 shares), and 2% (20,000 shares) by his sister, Ms Kwek Joo Sim (\u201cMs Kwek\u201d). 2', 'In 2003, the Property was purchased in the name of one of the defendant\u2019s companies, Kwek Sum Chuan Holding Pte Ltd (\u201cKSC Holding\u201d). 3', 'The Company used the Property as a supermarket.', '3\\u2003The plaintiff claims that he had been assisting the Company since its incorporation and started working for the Company from 2000. Based on his contributions towards expanding the supermarket business, he was appointed its chief executive officer (\u201cCEO\u201d) in 2004. Under him, the supermarket business boomed. 4', 'The defendant, however, says that the plaintiff was not substantively involved in setting up the Company in 1999. However, the defendant saw the Company as a family business and wanted all five of his children to be involved in it. The plaintiff only began working for the Company in 2003, after obtaining a Master\u2019s degree. 5', 'Barely a year later, the plaintiff requested to be appointed the CEO, and the defendant agreed to this as he wanted to groom the plaintiff. This continued from 2004 to 2012. 6', '4\\u2003According to the plaintiff, he was headhunted by a Malaysian company, Pasaraya Wah Seah Maju Sdn Bhd (\u201cPasaraya\u201d), in late 2011. The plaintiff decided to take up Pasaraya\u2019s offer as Pasaraya offered the plaintiff a much higher remuneration than what he was receiving from the Company. As such, the plaintiff tendered his resignation to the defendant. However, upon receipt of the plaintiff\u2019s resignation letter, the defendant offered the following to the plaintiff in exchange for his continued employment with the Company: 7', '(a)\\u2003\u201c[T]o make [the plaintiff] a director and also a managing director of the Company and to transfer 6% of the shares in the Company to [the plaintiff] by the end of the following year\u201d (\u201cthe First Set of Terms\u201d); and', '(b)\\u2003\u201c[T]o give [the plaintiff] at least another 60% of the shares in the Company and 60% of properties, purchased or to be purchased in the name of the Defendant or the Defendant\u2019s companies, which are used or to be used for the Company\u2019s supermarket business, in 5 years\u2019 time when the Defendant would go into retirement\u201d (\u201cthe Second Set of Terms\u201d).', '5\\u2003The plaintiff says that he accepted the defendant\u2019s offer right away and withdrew his resignation letter by tearing it in the presence of the defendant. Thus, the Alleged Oral Agreement was formed. 8', '6\\u2003On the other hand, the defendant denies having ever made such an offer to the plaintiff or having entered into the Alleged Oral Agreement with the plaintiff. The defendant says he did not receive any resignation letter from the plaintiff and did not receive any indication that the plaintiff wished to resign. In fact, the defendant was not aware of the plaintiff being headhunted by Pasaraya, or any other company. 9', '7\\u2003It is not disputed that on 7 November 2012, the plaintiff was appointed a director of the Company. From the financial statements of the Company for the year ending 2012, in the course of 2012, the plaintiff\u2019s shareholding increased by about 6% of the total shareholding (from 20,000 out of 980,000 shares to 80,000 out of 1,000,000 shares). This appears to have been achieved by a transfer of 40,000 shares from the defendant to the plaintiff, and an allocation of an additional 20,000 shares to the plaintiff. 10', '8\\u2003These acts, says the plaintiff, were in fulfilment of the First Set of Terms. Indeed, he claims to be appointed not only as a director, but as the managing director of the Company. 11', 'The plaintiff\u2019s beef is that contrary to the Alleged Oral Agreement, the defendant has not performed the Second Set of Terms. According to the defendant, however, he had decided in 2012 that his children should play a larger role in the management of the Company. Therefore, both Ms Kwek and the plaintiff were appointed as directors of the Company at the same time. 12', 'Around 2012, the defendant says he told the plaintiff about his intention to distribute his assets to his children, including the plaintiff, in the future. This was because the defendant was thinking about succession planning at the Company. 13', '9\\u2003Parties agree that on multiple occasions, the plaintiff asked the defendant to put matters into writing. The plaintiff says he wanted the Alleged Oral Agreement to be recorded, while the defendant says he was asked to record his intention to transfer his assets to the plaintiff. In any event, the defendant refused to do so. The defendant explains that he thought that it was unnecessary. He was simply expressing his plans for the future and did not intend to create any legally binding agreement with the plaintiff. 14', '10\\u2003One such discussion apparently occurred on 21 December 2015 when the parties met in the Company\u2019s office. A video recording of a part of that meeting was adduced by the plaintiff as evidence in support of the Alleged Oral Agreement (\u201cthe Video Recording\u201d). 15', 'The defendant, on the other hand, disputes the contents of the Video Recording, and asserts that he has never confirmed the existence of the Alleged Oral Agreement. 16', '11\\u2003In December 2016, ie, purportedly five years after the formation of the Alleged Oral Agreement, the plaintiff asked the defendant to honour the Second Set of Terms under the Alleged Oral Agreement. The defendant, evidently, did not do so. 17', '12\\u2003Following his appointment as a director of the Company, the plaintiff ran the Company\u2019s supermarket business. The defendant\u2019s position is that the plaintiff seriously mismanaged the Company, and the Company incurred significant financial losses as a result. 18', 'The Company\u2019s supermarket business ceased to be viable by 2017. 19', 'Eventually, on 25 May 2018, the defendant and the other shareholders of the Company unanimously resolved to end the Company\u2019s supermarket operations. 20', '13\\u2003According to the defendant, from 2016, rather than be co-operative in facilitating the closure of the Company\u2019s supermarket business, the plaintiff made a series of threats and demands against the defendant for the latter\u2019s monies and assets. The relationship between father and son deteriorated significantly by March 2018. At that time, the defendant was in the midst of closing the Company\u2019s supermarket operations and required certain documents such as the Company\u2019s 2017 statement of accounts and various missing supplier invoices. As such, the defendant offered the plaintiff S$3m to buy out his shareholding (ie, 8% of the shares in the Company) in the hope that by doing so, the defendant would be able to promptly obtain the necessary documents. 21', 'The defendant made the offer as he hoped to resolve his differences with the plaintiff peacefully and the offer was not an admission of any liability on his part. 22', '14\\u2003However, the plaintiff asked for S$15m for him to exit the Company. 23', 'The defendant rejected this. 24', 'Subsequently, the plaintiff indicated that he was prepared to accept the initial sum of S$3m for him to exit the Company. 25', 'The defendant rejected this because he could not accept the other terms in the draft agreement prepared by the plaintiff. 26', '15\\u2003According to the defendant, subsequently, the plaintiff made more threats.

It is an engineering, procurement and construction (\u201cEPC\u201d) contractor. Its business is constructing and commissioning Infrastructure Projects for the Rohan Group in Gondor. The arbitration arose out of one such project (\u201cthe Project\u201d).', '11\\u2003The third respondent is a company incorporated in Gondor. It is a special purpose vehicle. The first respondent and the Procurement Company incorporated the third respondent for the sole purpose of owning and operating the Project.', '12\\u2003The Procurement Company is a company incorporated in Singapore. As its anonymised name suggests, the Procurement Company is the Rohan Group\u2019s centralised procurement arm. Its role is to procure goods for the Rohan Group from vendors around the world and to supply those goods to members of the group after applying an intragroup markup. 4', '13\\u2003Until October 2016, the first respondent held 99.99% of the shares in both the second and third respondents. Another member of the Rohan Group held the remaining 0.01% of the shares in the second respondent. The Procurement Company held the remaining 0.01% of the shares in the third respondent. In October 2016, the Rohan Group sold the third respondent to an unrelated group (\u201cthe Sauron Group\u201d). In March 2017, the Rohan Group sold the second respondent to another unrelated group of companies.', '14\\u2003From March 2017, therefore, each respondent has been under separate ownership: (a) the Rohan Group continues to own the first respondent; (b) another unrelated group has owned the second respondent since March 2017; and (c) the Sauron Group has owned the third respondent since October 2016. This divergence of ownership, and therefore of interests, is why each respondent was separately represented in the arbitration and has brought a separate challenge to the award.', '15\\u2003The Modules which the second respondent needed to complete the Project for the third respondent were supplied under a chain of contracts entered into in 2015 and 2016.

Under the MSA, the claimant agreed to sell Modules to the Procurement Company for use in the Rohan Group\u2019s Infrastructure Projects worldwide.

The Sauron Group\u2019s position was that: (a) the second respondent\u2019s remaining liability for Modules was no more than \u20b43.84m as set out in the second respondent\u2019s books; and (b) in any event, Gondor\u2019s foreign exchange laws obliged the second respondent to pay that sum to the Procurement Company (as the second respondent\u2019s contractual counterparty) and prohibited the second respondent from paying that sum directly to the claimant (with whom the second respondent had no contract of any kind). The Rohan Group\u2019s position was that no money whatsoever should be paid to the Procurement Company, as it was by then subject to the Chapter 11 proceedings. 17', 'The claimant\u2019s position was that it was a company under public ownership and therefore could not accept a mere part payment in the sum of \u20b43.84m to discharge an indisputable claim for \u20b47.35m for Modules sold and delivered. 18', '28\\u2003At the end of October 2016, the Rohan Group transferred its shares in the second respondent and the third respondent to the Sauron Group.', '29\\u2003In November 2016, representatives of the Rohan Group again attempted to persuade the claimant to accept a part-payment of \u20b43.84m from the Sauron Group in exchange for issuing the manufacturers\u2019 warranties for the Modules to the third respondent, on the basis that the claimant could reserve its right to recover the balance of the \u20b47.35m from the Procurement Company. It was again the claimant\u2019s position that, as a company under public ownership, it could not accept part-payment for an undisputable claim.', '30\\u2003The following facts are therefore not in dispute. The claimant sold and delivered Modules worth \u20b47.35m to the Procurement Company who sold them on to the second respondent who in turn sold them on to the third respondent. The second respondent used the Modules to complete the Project for the third respondent. The Project is operational, and the third respondent is earning substantial revenue from it. The Procurement Company still owes the claimant \u20b47.35m for the Modules. According to the second respondent, it owes the Procurement Company only \u20b43.84m for the Modules.

In The Law Society of Singapore v Syn Kok Kay [2022] SGDT 10 (the \u201cReport\u201d), the Disciplinary Tribunal found that there was cause of sufficient gravity for referral to the Court of Three Judges in respect of the First Charge and the Second Charge:', '(a)\\u2003In respect of the First Charge, the Disciplinary Tribunal considered that, notwithstanding the agreed position that there was no fraud or dishonesty, there was a prima facie basis to find that the respondent had acted unethically in presenting bills which were far in excess of what he should have reasonably charged (at [20] of the Report).', '(b)\\u2003In respect of the Second Charge, the respondent attributed the delay to his unfamiliarity with taxation proceedings and his appeal against the Taxation Order. The Disciplinary Tribunal considered that his incompetence, even if accepted at face value, did not reduce the gravity of his conduct, which lay in his failure to comply with the Taxation Order and the prejudice it caused JWR by delaying its recovery of the excess fees (at [23] of the Report).', '15\\u2003As for the Third Charge, it was the respondent\u2019s position before the Disciplinary Tribunal that he was unable to make repayment at the material time. The Law Society did not dispute this position. However, it argued that the respondent\u2019s ability to make repayment was irrelevant to the charge as it was his legal obligation to do so. Further, it noted that these facts were not within its knowledge, and that it was not for the Law Society to speculate. The Disciplinary Tribunal ultimately took the view that the respondent\u2019s failure to pay was \u201cdue to his impecuniosity when his obligation to repay crystallised\u201d, which alone did not present a prima facie case of due cause for disciplinary action. Consequently, the Disciplinary Tribunal decided not to refer the Third Charge to the Court of Three Judges, but to reprimand the respondent instead (at [29]\u2013[30] of the Report).', '16\\u2003The Law Society proceeded to file the present application for the respondent to show cause, in respect of the First and Second Charges, as to why he should not be made to suffer sanction under s 83(1) of the LPA.

In essence, the representations were to the effect that there would be an imminent trade sale of all AMP shares to an important person in Singapore, that Dr Goh intended to list AMP through an initial public offering on the Singapore Exchange if the trade sale did not materialise, and that Dr Goh required Liberty Sky\u2019s financial support to buy out minority investors in AMP with voting rights who could stifle the trade sale or the initial public offering (at [4]).

As the trade sale and initial public offering did not occur, Liberty Sky filed Suit 457 against Dr Goh and AMP to claim against AMP vis-\u00e0-vis this indemnity agreement (Liberty Sky Investments Ltd v Goh Seng Heng and another [2019] SGHC 40 at [2]).

Mr Loh joined the Singapore Prison Service in 1965, and he retired as a Deputy Superintendent in 2002. As stated at [2] above, Mr Loh is also a prominent figure in the local track and field scene.

According to her, all four individual training sessions were held at the old Tampines Stadium (which has since been demolished).

{"casename":"2023_SGHC_75","fact":"'3\\u2003I begin with the relevant background context, against which the Questions are to be answered. The Questions arise in the context of claims for personal injuries arising out of motor vehicle accidents (\u201cPIMA\u201d) cases. Without intending to diminish the absolute importance of every case to the individual parties concerned, the quantum of damages claimed in the typical PIMA case is relatively small. As such, there has been a concerted effort in Singapore, and other jurisdictions, to encourage or even direct parties to settle their disputes in PIMA cases at the earliest possible time, and in as uncomplicated a manner as possible. More broadly, this reflects what Sundaresh Menon CJ has referred to as the overarching mission to ensure that court users are able to find justice at a proportionate cost (see \u201cChief Justice Sundaresh Menon: Response delivered at the Opening of The Legal Year 2023\u201d (9 January 2023) at para 15). These broad motivations have resulted in the \u201cPre-Action Protocol for Personal Injury Claims and Non-Injury Motor Accident Claims\u201d (\u201cthe Protocol\u201d), which applies to almost all PIMA and non-injury motor accident (\u201cNIMA\u201d) cases commenced in the State Courts. For the purposes of the present case, I will confine my consideration of the Questions to PIMA cases only.', '4\\u2003In Singapore, the Protocol can be found in Appendix B of the State Courts Practice Directions 2021 (\u201cPD 2021\u201d). Pursuant to para 39(2) of the PD 2021, claimants in all PIMA cases must comply with the Protocol before commencing court proceedings. The Protocol was previously found in Appendix E of the State Courts Practice Directions 2014 (\u201cPD 2014\u201d). While the present case concerns an accident which occurred prior to the application of the PD 2021, I will deal primarily with the PD 2021 in as much as the material parts of the Protocol remain unchanged across the two Practice Directions.', '5\\u2003In essence, the Protocol frontloads some of the court processes such as the discovery of documents, which used to be disclosed only later in the proceedings. The rationale for this is to allow the defendant or his insurer the opportunity to assess the claim and make a settlement offer, so that parties may arrive at an early settlement and avoid a costly legal process (see Eversheds Harry Elias Practical Guides: \u201cWhat to do in a motor accident?\u201d (8 July 2019) (\u201cWhat to do in a motor accident\u201d) at para 24). Thus, after all the relevant information and documents have been exchanged, the PD 2021 directs that the parties \u201cshall negotiate with a view of settling the matter at the earliest opportunity on both liability and quantum\u201d (see Appendix B to PD 2021 at para 11.1). However, if there is no reasonable prospect of settlement after a specified period from the date of the receipt of the letter of claim, the claimant may commence legal action.', '6\\u2003Pursuant to para 39(9) and Appendix C of the PD 2021, if the claimant commences legal action, and the defendant enters a notice of intention to contest, the claim will proceed for a Court Dispute Resolution Case Conference (\u201cCDR CC\u201d). The objective of the CDR CC is to facilitate the amicable resolution of disputes without trial through the provision of an early neutral evaluation on the merits of the case (see para 39(10) of the PD 2021). At the CDR CC stage, there are three possible outcomes. First, if the parties agree on liability, then they may enter into a consent interlocutory judgment on liability in accordance with Form 7 of Appendix A1 to the PD 2021 (\u201cForm 7\u201d) (see para 39(17) of the PD 2021). This will state the percentage of liability that the defendant shall bear, and will provide for damages, interest, and costs to be assessed by the Registrar. Second, if the parties disagree on liability, the CDR CC judge will give timelines for the case to progress to a trial on liability (see para 39(14) of the PD 2021). Third, if the parties agree on quantum in addition to liability, then they may record a final settlement or enter into a consent final judgment in accordance with Form 7. The practical advantage of recording a final settlement instead of entering a final judgment is that the settlement may be on a without admission of liability basis. In any event, the case will then be complete (see \u201cWhat to do in a motor accident\u201d at para 35.3).', '7\\u2003Against this general context, the Questions have arisen in the scenario where the parties have agreed on liability and entered into a consent interlocutory judgment on such. The present case arose from MC\/MC 8815 of 2020 (\u201cMC 8815\u201d). This is the plaintiff\u2019s 1', 'claim against the defendant for personal injury, loss, and expenses arising out of an accident on 29 March 2019. The defendant was driving a motorcycle which was insured with Direct Asia Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd when it collided with the plaintiff\u2019s motor car along Loyang Lane. As a result of the accident, the plaintiff allegedly suffered neck pain and back pain. Presumably after going through the Protocol (albeit under the PD 2014), the plaintiff filed his Statement of Claim on 21 August 2020. Pursuant to O 18 r 12(1A) of the ROC 2014, the plaintiff also annexed to his claim a medical report and statement of the special damages claimed. The plaintiff claimed for general damages and special damages. The special damages claimed included loss of income amounting to $434.00, medical expenses amounting to $66.65, and transport expenses amounting to $30.00. In his Defence filed on 24 September 2020, the defendant resisted the plaintiff\u2019s claim on the basis of, among other grounds, the lack of causation of the plaintiff\u2019s losses.', '8\\u2003On 8 January 2021, consent interlocutory judgment was entered for the plaintiff against the defendant for 90% of damages to be assessed, with costs and interest reserved to the Registrar. The terms of the consent interlocutory judgment are as follows:', 'It is noteworthy that despite the terms of the consent interlocutory judgment making no mention of issues of causation, in the completed Form 9I dated 8 January 2021 (which is the equivalent of Form 7 under the PD 2014), the parties had ticked the box which indicated that by consent, interlocutory judgment is entered for the plaintiff against the defendant at 90%, \u201cleaving the issues of damages and causation to be assessed and costs reserved to the Registrar assessing the damages\u201d [emphasis added]. The current version of Form 9I no longer contain the words \u201cand causation\u201d in the equivalent sentence. Neither does Form 7 in the PD 2021 contain those words. I understand that the prevailing practice at one time in the State Courts was to allow the defendant to challenge the causation of injuries in toto at the AD Stage despite the entering of interlocutory judgment by consent in relation to liability.', '9\\u2003Subsequently, pursuant to an order of court dated 24 March 2021, the plaintiff\u2019s proposed medical doctor, Dr Stephanie Ong, and the defendant\u2019s proposed technical specialist, Mr David James Hunter (\u201cMr Hunter\u201d), were appointed as Single Joint Experts (\u201cSJEs\u201d) under O 108 r 5(3)(a) of the ROC 2014. Their respective SJE reports were duly filed. Mr Hunter\u2019s report stated that the damage profiles of the vehicles involved were not consistent with the level of force transference required to have caused the plaintiff to suffer neck and lower back pain from the accident. Therefore, relying on the SJE reports, the defendant challenged the causation of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries. More specifically, from Mr Hunter\u2019s report, the defendant had disputed the causal connection between the accident and the plaintiff\u2019s injuries. By extension, the defendant also challenged the plaintiff\u2019s heads of claims for general damages. As a result, in the Joint Opening Statement dated 13 June 2022 filed for the AD hearing in MC 8815, the defendant submitted a \u201cnil\u201d position in respect of the plaintiff\u2019s claim for pain and suffering for neck pain and back pain. In particular, the defendant had stated \u201ccausation disputed\u201d in relation to both of these injuries. However, the defendant did agree to pay the sum of $66.65 claimed for the plaintiff\u2019s medical expenses and the sum of $10.00 for the plaintiff\u2019s transport expenses.', '10\\u2003At the AD hearing for MC 8815 before the learned Deputy Registrar Lewis Tan (\u201cDR Tan\u201d), the parties confirmed that they were willing to proceed with the AD despite the defendant disputing the causation of the plaintiff\u2019s general damages. However, DR Tan was reluctant to proceed with the AD hearing on this basis in light of the Court of Appeal decision of Tan Woo Thian v PricewaterhouseCoopers Advisory Services Pte Ltd [2021] 1 SLR 1166 (\u201cTan Woo Thian\u201d). In that case, the Court of Appeal held ex tempore that (at [8]), in a bifurcated trial, the plaintiff at the liability stage would need \u201cto show that he did, in fact, suffer one or more types of loss that was causally connected to the alleged breach\u201d [emphasis in original]. DR Tan expressed the view that \u201cthere does not seem to be any decision whereby assessment went ahead when parties only consented to [special damages]\u201d. 2', '11\\u2003As a result, the defendant filed HC\/OA 301 of 2022 (\u201cOA 301\u201d) for MC 8815 to be transferred to the General Division of the High Court (\u201cthe High Court\u201d) under s 54B(1) of the State Courts Act 1970 (2020 Rev Ed) (\u201cSCA\u201d) for the determination of the Questions. According to the defendant, the rationale for OA 301 was to seek a High Court pronouncement to settle the extent to which causation might be contested at the AD Stage after the entering of interlocutory judgment against a defendant. The defendant says that this would affect more than the immediate interest of the parties in MC 8815 and would benefit future litigants, insurance companies, and their legal advisors in planning their litigation roadmap and strategies in relation to causation. On 5 August 2022, an Assistant Registrar (\u201cAR\u201d) allowed the transfer of MC 8815 to the High Court for the Questions to be answered.'"}
{"casename":"2023_SGHC_76","fact":"'2\\u2003The present dispute arises out of a falling-out between three business partners-turned-adversaries \u2013 Mr Chia Kuan Wee (\u201cMr Chia\u201d) on one side, and on the other Mr Lim Boon Chye Victor (\u201cMr Lim\u201d) and Mr Murugesan Srinivasan (\u201cMr Srinivasan\u201d). Mr Chia is the second plaintiff in this action, while Mr Lim and Mr Srinivasan are the first and second defendants respectively. All three men were directors in the third defendant, Rotating Offshore Solutions Pte Ltd (\u201cROS\u201d), a Singapore-incorporated company carrying on the business of manufacturing and repairing oil rigs and ocean-going vessels. Individually, they also indirectly held (and continue to hold, in the cases of Mr Lim and Mr Srinivasan) shares in ROS through companies incorporated in the British Virgin Islands (\u201cBVI\u201d). Mr Chia\u2019s company, 3N Investments Group Limited (\u201c3N\u201d) (of which Mr Chia is the sole shareholder and director) is the first plaintiff.', '3\\u2003Through their respective BVI companies, Mr Chia, Mr Lim and Mr Srinivasan were equal shareholders in ROS. From 2015 until November 2019, there was a fourth shareholder in ROS \u2013 Ezion Holdings Ltd (\u201cEzion\u201d), a Singapore-incorporated company listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange. 1', 'Ezion\u2019s Chief Risk Officer and Chief Strategy Officer, Mr Cheah Boon Pin (\u201cMr Cheah\u201d), was a non-executive director of ROS from 1 March 2019 to 30 July 2019. 2', 'Mr Cheah attempted to play a mediating role between the parties when the disputes arose, albeit unsuccessfully as events (which I shall detail below) unfolded.', '4\\u2003The last key figure for present purposes is Mr Michael Wong, the Financial Controller of ROS. 3', 'Owing to the breakdown in relations between Mr Chia on the one hand and Mr Lim and Mr Srinivasan on the other, Mr Wong became the primary point of contact representing the latter two during the relevant period.', '5\\u2003In or around September 2019, tensions arose between the three directors in relation to the management of ROS. They attempted to resolve their dispute by entering into a settlement agreement on 12 September 2019 (the \u201c12 September Agreement\u201d). This agreement generally delineated the terms of Mr Chia\u2019s exit from ROS as a director, employee and shareholder. 4', 'This attempt ultimately proved to be unsuccessful, and served only to breed further disputes which culminated in the plaintiffs commencing HC\/S 1050\/2019 against the defendants for minority oppression (the \u201cMinority Oppression Suit\u201d). 5', 'This caused a fracture in the relationship between the directors to the point where Mr Chia was no longer on speaking terms with Mr Lim and Mr Srinivasan. 6', '6\\u2003After the commencement of the Minority Oppression Suit, the parties embarked on a second attempt to resolve their dispute through negotiations, which culminated in a number of agreements concluded on 15 November 2019 (the \u201c15 November Agreements\u201d). These agreements were (a) a Deed of Settlement providing for full and final settlement of all the parties\u2019 disputes, including the Minority Oppression Suit; (b) a Deed of Cessation of Employment; (c) two Sale and Purchase Agreements (the \u201cSPAs\u201d); and (d) a Share Transfer Agreement between ROS and Mr Chia. 7', 'Pursuant to these agreements, Mr Chia would resign his directorship and employment in ROS and sell his shares in ROS (the \u201cROS Shares\u201d) (held through the first plaintiff) to Mr Lim and Mr Srinivasan.', '7\\u2003It is apt to note at this point that the 15 November Agreements were expressed to supersede all other agreements including, specifically, the 12 September Agreement. 8', 'Thus, this court should not have regard to the 12 September Agreement as forming any part of the relevant context within which to interpret any of the 15 November Agreements.', '8\\u2003The present dispute centres around the two SPAs \u2013 the first provided for 3N to sell half its ROS Shares to Mr Lim (the \u201cD1 SPA\u201d), and the second provided for 3N to sell the other half of its ROS Shares to Mr Srinivasan (the \u201cD2 SPA\u201d). All three directors, as well as 3N and ROS, were parties to both the D1 SPA and D2 SPA. The terms of both SPAs were materially identical and each provided for 3N to transfer a specified lot of ROS Shares to the respective purchaser (ie, Mr Lim and Mr Srinivasan respectively). As consideration, each purchaser was to pay:', '(a)\\u2003S$1,012,500 in cash payable in several tranches (pursuant to cll 3, 4.4(a) and 4.4(c) of each SPA); and', '(b)\\u2003a further S$1,524,072 to be satisfied by the transfer of 5,000,000 shares in Uzma Berhad, a company listed on the Malaysian stock exchange (the \u201cUzma Shares\u201d). The Uzma Shares were to be transferred from the respective purchaser\u2019s securities account to Mr Chia\u2019s securities account (pursuant to cl 4.4(b) of each SPA). 9', 'Thus, pursuant to the D1 SPA and D2 SPA, a total of 10,000,000 Uzma Shares were to be transferred to Mr Chia.', '9\\u2003As cl 4.4(b) represents the core of the parties\u2019 disputes in this case, it is apposite that I set it out in full here: 10', '10\\u2003Furthermore, under cl 7 of each SPA, Mr Lim and Mr Srinivasan undertook mutually to procure each other\u2019s performance of the other\u2019s obligations. ROS also undertook to procure the performance of both SPAs by Mr Lim and Mr Srinivasan respectively. Clause 7 of the D1 SPA is reproduced here; the wording of the D2 SPA is identical except that references to \u201cVictor\u201d (the first defendant) are to be substituted with \u201cSrini\u201d (the second defendant), and references to \u201cSrini\u201d are to be similarly substituted with \u201cVictor\u201d: 11', '11\\u2003As far as the performance of contractual obligations is concerned, it is undisputed that Mr Chia fulfilled his obligations by resigning his employment and directorship in ROS on 15 November 2019, and transferring his ROS shares held through 3N to Mr Lim and Mr Srinivasan on 18 November 2019. 12', 'It is also not in dispute that the cash component of the consideration under both SPAs was furnished on time by Mr Lim and Mr Srinivasan. 13', 'What remained was for the Uzma Shares to be transferred to Mr Chia by 31 December 2019 \u2013 it was this step which proved to be the stumbling block to closure, both for the deal and for the parties, and which eventually led to the commencement of this action.', '12\\u2003Some background context to the share transfer process is necessary for a better understanding of the factual topography of this case. Shares in Uzma are listed on the Malaysian stock exchange, known as Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad (\u201cBursa\u201d), and are typically transferred within Bursa\u2019s automated and computerised securities trading system. 14', 'However, the case at hand involved a transaction exclusively between the parties (as opposed to one with the market at large) which had to be effected through other methods.', '13\\u2003There are several such other methods, depending on whether the transfer is pursuant to a trade by private treaty. If it is, then the transaction is done on the exchange by way of a direct business transaction (\u201cDBT\u201d). On the other hand, transfers not pursuant to a trade by private treaty are effected off-market, through the central depository (ie, without the involvement of the exchange), by Bursa Malaysia Depository Sdn Bhd (\u201cBursa Depository\u201d), and may only be done pursuant to certain approved reasons. 15', '14\\u2003To carry out the share transfer, the defendants engaged Maybank Investment Bank Berhad (\u201cMaybank IB\u201d) to advise and assist them. 16', 'Maybank IB proposed several methods: (a) a B5 transfer (B5 being a reference to one of the approved reasons for a transaction effected through the central depository, which would be subject to Bursa Depository\u2019s approval); (b) a direct business transaction (\u201cDBT\u201d) transfer without financial consideration (which would be subject to Bursa\u2019s approval); and (c) a normal DBT transfer with financial consideration. 17', '15\\u2003The parties originally intended to use the option of a DBT transfer without financial consideration, to be executed by ROS\u2019 securities broker, Maybank Kim Eng. 18', 'However, Maybank Kim Eng declined to assist with the transaction because ROS was involved in ongoing litigation unrelated to the present dispute. 19', '16\\u2003The defendants then decided to attempt a B5 transfer. 20', 'To effect a B5 transfer, an application form must be submitted to the Bursa Depository, and the reason for the transfer must fall within a prescribed list of approved reasons (which I elaborate on below). 21', 'Due to several delays which the parties now blame each other for, the B5 transfer application was only submitted on 30 December 2019 (ie, one day before the contractual deadline). This application was rejected by Bursa Depository on the same day, on the ground that the reason provided for in the application did not fall within the approved reasons for a B5 transfer. 22', '17\\u2003In the wake of the failed B5 transfer, the parties were now beyond the contractually stipulated deadline of 31 Dec 2019, with the Uzma Shares still in ROS\u2019 hands. The defendants next attempted a DBT transfer without financial consideration, this time to be executed by Maybank IB. 23', 'This process was again delayed for several months due to many disagreements between the parties over various matters, as well as the imposition of Movement Control Orders (\u201cMCOs\u201d) by the Malaysian Government to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in Malaysia, starting in March 2020. The Uzma Shares were finally transferred to Mr Chia\u2019s share trading account on 29 July 2020 (ie, close to seven months late), 24', 'by which time their market value had diminished significantly. 25'"}

{"casename":"2023_SGHC_83","fact":"facts. However, I turn first to the applicable principles.\nThe applicable principles\nGeneral principles\n8 The present application is made under s 139(1) of the IRDA, which \nprovides that \u201c[a] liquidator appointed by the Court may resign or on cause \nshown be removed by the Court\u201d. This applies to the compulsory winding-up \nregime. Section 139(1) is identical and derived from s 268(1) of the Companies \nAct (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (\u201cCompanies Act\u201d). Accordingly, as a starting point, \nthe principles applicable to s 268(1) of the Companies Act must be equally \napplicable to s 139(1) of the IRDA. In this regard, Tan Lee Meng J in the High \nCourt decision of Hong Investment Pte Ltd v Tai Thong Hung Plastics \nIndustries (Pte) Ltd [2010] SGHC 375 adopted the principles articulated in \nVersion No 2: 06 Apr 2023 (15:31 hrs)\nDB International Trust (Singapore) Ltd v \nMedora Xerxes Jamshid[2023] SGHC 83\n5Woon and Hicks, The Companies Act of Singapore \u2013 An Annotation \n(LexisNexis, Looseleaf Ed, 2004, Issue 2) (\u201cWoon and Hicks\u201d) (at para 3105-\n3125) to his application of s 268(1) of the Companies Act, as follows (at [5]):\nRemoval of liquidators for cause See also s 268(1). A liquidator \nmay be removed if there is some unfitness of the person by \nreason of his personal character, or from his connection with \nother parties or from the circumstances in which he is involved: \nSir John Moore Gold Mining Co (1879) 12 Ch D 325, 331 per \nJessel MR. Thus, for instance, if a liquidator refuses to take \naction against miscreant directors because he is one of them or \nbecause they are his friends, he may be removed by the court: \nChua Boon Chin v McCormack [1979] 2 MLJ 156. If the \nliquidator is not independent or impartial because of his \nconnection with persons against whom there might be pending \nclaims, there would be cause to have him removed: \nRe: Charterland Goldfields (1909) 26 TLR 132. Similarly, if it \nappears that the liquidator is in a position where his duty and \ninterest conflict: Re International Properties Pty Ltd (1977) \n2 ACLR 488, 492.\nThe court has power to remove a liquidator not only because of \nhis personal unfitness, but also on the ground that it is in the \ninterest of the liquidation that he should be replaced: Chua \nBoon Chin v McCormack [1979] 2 MLJ 156, 158; Re Adam Eyton \nLtd (1887) 36 Ch D 299, 303-304. In Procam (Pte) Ltd v Nangle \n[1990] 3 MLJ 269 Thean J declined to order the removal of a \nliquidator on the ground that it was not in the interest of the \nliquidation to do so, given the advanced state of the liquidation. \nMoreover, the errors made by the liquidator were made in good \nfaith and did not prejudice the liquidation.\n9 While the principles articulated in Woon and Hicks are undoubtedly \nhelpful in providing examples of situations where s 268(1) of the Companies \nAct may be successfully invoked, it is, in my view, more important to have \nregard to the general basis for how s 268(1) of the Companies Act, and \ncorrespondingly s 139(1) of the IRDA, is to be applied. Such a general basis \nwill help us understand why the situations suggested in Woon and Hicks should \nresult in the successful invocation of s 268(1), and how other situations might \nalso result in the same. \nVersion No 2: 06 Apr 2023 (15:31 hrs)\nDB International Trust (Singapore) Ltd v \nMedora Xerxes Jamshid[2023] SGHC 83\n610 In the High Court decision of Petroships Investment Pte Ltd v \nWealthplus Pte Ltd (in members\u2019 voluntary liquidation) (Koh Brothers \nBuilding & Civil Engineering Contractor (Pte) Ltd and another, interveners) \nand another matter [2018] 3 SLR 687 (\u201cPetroships\u201d), Vinodh \nCoomaraswamy J had to consider the principles in relation to the removal of a \nliquidator pursuant to s 302 of the Companies Act. Similar to but also distinct \nfrom s 268(1), s 302 allows the court, on cause shown, to remove a liquidator \nand appoint another liquidator in a voluntary winding up. In the subsequent \nHigh Court decision of Liquidators of Ace Class Precision Engineering Pte Ltd \n(in members\u2019 voluntary liquidation) v Tan Boon Hwa [2022] 3 SLR 539 (\u201cTan \nBoon Hwa\u201d), Tan Siong Thye J held that the principles articulated in Petroships \nin relation to s 302 apply equally to s 174 of the IRDA, which is derived from \ns 302 (at [99]). \n11 More broadly, given the similarity in wording between ss 268(1) and \n302 of the Companies Act (and, correspondingly, ss 139(1) and 174 of \nthe IRDA), Coomaraswamy J\u2019s statement of the law in Petroships in relation to \ns 268(1) of the Companies Act should also apply to s 139 of the IRDA and \ntherefore govern the present application, with appropriate adjustments to be \nmade for the distinction between a solvent and an insolvent liquidation (see \nPetroships at [126]).\n12 Applying the principles laid down in Petroships to s 139(1) of \nthe IRDA, the broad effect of the relevant authorities is that, to show cause \nunder this section, the applicant \u201cmust establish that the removal of the \nliquidator is in the real, substantial and honest interest of the liquidation and will \nadvance the purposes for which the liquidator was appointed\u201d (see Petroships \nat [109(b)]). While this may be seen as a two-limb test that is concerned with \nVersion No 2: 06 Apr 2023 (15:31 hrs)\nDB International Trust (Singapore) Ltd v \nMedora Xerxes Jamshid[2023] SGHC 83\n7the interest of the liquidation and the purpose for which the liquidator is \nappointed (see Petroships at [127] and In re Adam Eyton Ltd, Ex parte \nCharlesworth (1887) 36 Ch D 299 at 306), it might be difficult to differentiate \nthe two limbs if they are meant to be cumulatively satisfied. Rather, as \nCoomaraswamy J stressed in Petroships, it is important to first pay heed to the \npurpose for which the liquidator was appointed, so as to set \u201cthe standard by \nwhich the court is to assess the actions of the liquidator which have been \nimpugned\u201d (at [125]). \n13 Therefore, rather than to conceive the appropriate test under s 139(1) of \nthe IRDA as a cumulative two-limb test, it is better to think of it as a two-stage \ntest that is to be applied sequentially: \n(a) the first stage would involve the court assessing the purposes for \nwhich the liquidator was appointed, which would be co-extensive with \nthe purposes for the liquidation (see Petroships at [125]); and\n(b) the second stage would involve the court assessing whether the \nremoval of the liquidator is in the \u201creal, substantial and honest interest \nof the liquidation\u201d, bearing in mind the purposes determined at the first \nstage.\nIf the court concludes at the end of the two stages that the removal of the \nliquidator is in the \u201creal, substantial and honest interest of the liquidation\u201d, then \nthe applicant would have shown cause for the liquidator concerned to be \nremoved. This would enliven the court\u2019s discretion to remove the liquidator. \nThe court would then have to consider if it should exercise its discretion to \nremove the liquidator. Of course, if the court had already concluded that the \nremoval of the liquidator is in the \u201creal, substantial and honest interest of the \nVersion No 2: 06 Apr 2023 (15:31 hrs)\nDB International Trust (Singapore) Ltd v \nMedora Xerxes Jamshid[2023] SGHC 83\n8liquidation\u201d, it would usually follow that the court will exercise its discretion to \nremove the liquidator concerned.\n14 This manner of conceptualising the test under s 139(1) of the IRDA also \nexplains why the examples given in Woon and Hicks amount to cause for the \nremoval of liquidators. To take one example, in Chua Boon Chin v McCormack \nJohn Maxwell and others [1979\u20131980] SLR(R) 121, the High Court removed \nthe liquidators in a members\u2019 voluntary liquidation because one of them was \nconcurrently a director of the company. In that case, the first stage of the \nanalysis above would reveal that one of the purposes of the liquidation must be \nto ensure the fair distribution of the company\u2019s assets. Bearing this purpose in \nmind and proceeding to the second stage of the analysis, the removal of the \nliquidators would be in the real, substantial, and honest interest of the \nliquidation since there was real doubt whether the liquidators will discharge \ntheir responsibilities properly given one of them is a director of the company.\nSpecific principles in relation to the present application\n15 With these general principles in mind, I come to the specific principles \nin relation to the present application. \n16 In this regard, the present application concerns an insolvent liquidation. \nWhile Petroships and Tan Boon Hwa both involved solvent liquidations, \nCoomaraswamy J had, in the course of distilling the applicable considerations \nin relation to solvent liquidations in Petroships, also set out the relevant \npurposes of an insolvent liquidation. The learned judge had (at [130]) referred \nto Andrew R Keay, McPherson\u2019s Law of Company Liquidation \n(Sweet & Maxwell, 3rd Ed, 2013) (\u201cMcPherson\u201d) (at para 1-005):\nVersion No 2: 06 Apr 2023 (15:31 hrs)\nDB International Trust (Singapore) Ltd v \nMedora Xerxes Jamshid[2023] SGHC 83\n9\u2026\nThe purposes of the liquidation of insolvent companies are often \nseen as: first, providing a procedure that allows for an equitable \nand fair distribution of the assets of the debtor company \namongst its creditors. This means that one or more creditors \nare not discriminated against and one or some creditors do not \nprofit at the expense of other creditors \u2026; second, in providing \nfor the winding up of a company which is hopelessly insolvent, \nliquidation serves the community at large as it is not good for \nsociety that companies who are insolvent are able to continue \nto trade; third, liquidation is designed to allow for an \ninvestigation of the company\u2019s affairs by an independent and \nappropriately qualified person, with particular emphasis on the \ncircumstances which precipitated the winding up. Such an \ninvestigation may reveal improper or dishonest conduct by \nofficers of the company or others associated with the company \nthat should be punished by prosecution or civil action. Further, \nthe investigation may disclose the fact that there were unfair \ndispositions of property, which has reduced the ability of the \ncompany to pay its creditors.\n17 As can be seen from this extract from McPherson, there are, broadly \nspeaking, three purposes of an insolvent liquidation, namely, (a) providing a \nprocedure that ensures an equitable and fair distribution of assets among \ncreditors, (b) serving the community at large by not allowing insolvent \ncompanies to continue to trade, and (c) allowing for an investigation into the \ncompany\u2019s affairs by an independent and appropriately qualified person, \nespecially in relation to the circumstances that led to the winding up. In relation \nto the possibility of an investigation, a liquidator in a compulsory liquidation \nmay be reasonably expected to exercise his broad powers of investigation if he \nconsiders this to be necessary in his professional assessment (see Petroships at \n[139]). These purposes, which are by no means exhaustive, set the standards by \nwhich I should assess the actions of the Liquidator in the present case. \n18 Following from these purposes, I will need to consider whether the \nremoval of the Liquidator is in the \u201creal, substantial and honest interest of the \nliquidation\u201d. In this regard, as Coomaraswamy J said in Petroships, it is \nVersion No 2: 06 Apr 2023 (15:31 hrs)\nDB International Trust (Singapore) Ltd v \nMedora Xerxes Jamshid[2023] SGHC 83\n10necessary to ask who is primarily interested in the results of the liquidation, \nsince this would directly inform what the interest of the liquidation is (at [131]). \nIn the context of an insolvent liquidation such as in the present case, an insolvent \ncompany is liquidated primarily in the creditors\u2019 interest. The creditors are the \nprimary stakeholders because their interests prevail over the interests of other \npersons likely to be affected by the winding up, such as shareholders (see \nMcPherson at para 3-104). As such, I will give predominant weight to the \ncreditors\u2019 wishes in assessing whether the removal of the Liquidator is in the \nreal, substantial, and honest interest of the liquidation. In most cases, the \ncreditors\u2019 wishes will coincide with the purposes of the liquidation. For \nexample, it must be that creditors would like for the liquidation to provide a \nprocedure that ensures an equitable and fair distribution of assets among \ncreditors. As such, if a liquidator is not doing what is reasonably necessary to \nachieve this, then it must be in the creditors\u2019 interest in the liquidation to remove \nthe liquidator. \nWhether the applicant has shown cause for the Liquidator to be removed\n19 Applying the principles above, I conclude that the applicant has shown \ncause for the Liquidator to be removed as KIPL\u2019s liquidator. In gist, bearing in \nmind the three purposes of an insolvent liquidation, I find that the removal of \nthe Liquidator is in the \u201creal, substantial and honest interest of the liquidation\u201d. \nWhether the Liquidator has failed to display sufficient vigour in carrying \nout his duties\nThe general law\n20 I turn to the first reason advanced by the applicant. In general, it is well \nestablished that a liquidator\u2019s failure to display sufficient vigour in carrying out \nVersion No 2: 06 Apr 2023 (15:31 hrs)\nDB International Trust (Singapore) Ltd v \nMedora Xerxes Jamshid[2023] SGHC 83\n11his duties can justify his removal. Thus, in Re Keypak Homecare Ltd [1987] \nBCLC 409 (\u201cRe Keypak\u201d), the liquidator was removed because, despite being \nin office for three months, the liquidator had, among others, made no \nexamination of the sales and purchase ledgers, conducted no investigation in \norder to ascertain whether stock is missing and, if so, what happened to it. \nAdditionally, he had made no inquiries of the company and had not taken any \nevidence or interviewed any of the employees of the business who might have \ntold him what was going on in the weeks before the company\u2019s cessation of \ntrade (at 413). \n21 To find that a liquidator had not displayed sufficient vigour in carrying \nout his duties, it is not necessary to conclude that the liquidator was at fault, or \nthat he has acted wrongfully or ineptly (see the High Court decision of Yap \nJeffery Henry and another v Ho Mun-Tuke Don [2006] 3 SLR(R) 427 at [22]). \nThis proposition was similarly articulated in the English High Court decision of \nRe Edennote Ltd [1995] 2 BCLC 248, where the court stressed that, in coming \nto his decision to remove the liquidator concerned, \u201cno attack has been made on \nhis integrity and good faith\u201d (at 270). In my view, this follows from the general \nprinciple above that the removal of a liquidator is justified on what is in the \n\u201creal, substantial and honest interest of the liquidation\u201d, which does not \nnecessarily require the liquidator to have acted wrongfully or ineptly. \n22 Relatedly, a liquidator\u2019s failure to exercise sufficient vigour in carrying \nout his duties may also lead to the company suffering loss. In this case, the \ncourts have held that it would be in the best interest of the liquidation for the \nliquidator to be removed. Thus, in the Federal Court of Australia decision of \nCity & Suburban Pty Ltd v Smith (as liquidator of Conpac (Aust) Pty Ltd (in \nliq)) and another (1988) 28 ACSR 328 (\u201cCity & Suburban\u201d), there was \nVersion No 2: 06 Apr 2023 (15:31 hrs)\nDB International Trust (Singapore) Ltd v \nMedora Xerxes Jamshid[2023] SGHC 83\n12evidence that the directors concerned had used the company\u2019s profits to earn \nsecret profits. Despite this, the liquidator failed to conduct a proper investigation \ninto the matter. The liquidator also incorrectly used funds of the company to \nmake termination payments to employees of a different company controlled by \nthe directors of the first company. This happened because the liquidator had \nfailed to ascertain the facts necessary to obtain appropriate legal advice and, in \nany event, on the basis of the facts known to him, failed to obtain appropriate \nlegal advice (at 335). In the circumstances, the Federal Court of Australia held \nthat there might have been a possibility that the liquidator\u2019s actions have caused \nloss to the company and its creditors. The court further rejected the liquidator\u2019s \nargument that he ought not to be removed unless the court was satisfied that a \nbreach of duty had been clearly established; rather, the court held that a prima \nfacie case of breach would suffice (at 339). \nWhether the Liquidator has unjustifiably allowed Mr Taylor to act for and on \nbehalf of KIPL in Indonesia\n(1) The parties\u2019 positions\n23 Returning to the present case, the applicant cites, in effect, two examples \nthat show how the Liquidator has failed to display sufficient vigour in carrying \nout his duties. The first is that the Liquidator has unjustifiably allowed \nMr Taylor to act for and on behalf of KIPL in Indonesia, and the second is that \nthe Liquidator has unjustifiably not personally undertaken any investigations \ninto the affairs of KIPL. \n24 Beginning with the first example, it will be recalled that the Bonds were \nsecured by the Share Pledge and that under the Share Pledge, KIPL\u2019s shares in \nBPCI have been pledged to the applicant as security for the Bonds. The \nVersion No 2: 06 Apr 2023 (15:31 hrs)\nDB International Trust (Singapore) Ltd v \nMedora Xerxes Jamshid[2023] SGHC 83\n13Liquidator claims that he was informed by the BPCI directors in January 2022 \non the steps that Mr Taylor had taken for and on behalf of KIPL to nullify the \nShare Pledge in the Indonesian courts. The Liquidator then proceeded to ratify \nMr Taylor\u2019s actions after obtaining separate indemnities from Rasia FZE \n(Dubai) and Mr Taylor in relation to Mr Taylor\u2019s actions and proceedings in \nIndonesia. In a Statement Letter of KIPL dated 3 February 2022, the Liquidator \nmade the following ratification:1\nIn connection with the ongoing winding up proceedings of the \nCompany in Singapore, it has been brought to the Liquidator\u2019s \nattention that the Company has had to taken [sic] certain steps \nto protect its assets, interests and rights in Indonesia.\nThe Liquidator, on behalf of the Company, hereby ratifies (as if \nthe same were undertaken by the Liquidator himself): all \nactions, announcements, commencement of proceedings, \npowers of attorney, resolutions and notices issued in relation to \nprotecting the Company\u2019s assets, interests and rights in \nIndonesia, from the date of the Winding Up Order (i.e. \n20 November 2020) to the date of this Statement Letter.

As of 29 December 2021, the issued \nshare capital of BPCI was 6,000 shares, with KIPL holding 5,700 shares. \nHowever, the issued share capital of BPCI had increased to 20,000 on \n21 January 2022. Despite this, the number of shares held by KIPL did not \n1 Affidavit of Medora Xerxes Jamshid dated 25 November 2022 at p 57.\nVersion No 2: 06 Apr 2023 (15:31 hrs)\nDB International Trust (Singapore) Ltd v \nMedora Xerxes Jamshid[2023] SGHC 83\n14change. In effect, KIPL\u2019s shareholding in BPCI was reduced from 95% to \n28.5%. Despite KIPL being a 95% shareholder of BPCI at the time of the share \nissuance, the Liquidator was not consulted or asked to sign any shareholders\u2019 \nresolution approving the issuance of the shares. Instead, the applicant submits \nthat it appears that Mr Taylor had authorised or signed a shareholders\u2019 \nresolution approving the share issuance on behalf of the Liquidator, who then \nratified his actions.  \n26 In response, the Liquidator explains that he had only ratified \nMr Taylor\u2019s actions to a limited extent and on the basis that those actions were \nin the best interest of KIPL\u2019s creditors. The Liquidator points out that he did not \naccede to all of the requests of ratification made to him by the BPCI directors. \nIn particular, the Liquidator informed the BPCI directors that he could not \nauthorise Mr Taylor\u2019s undertaking and assumption of the powers and duties of \na director of the KIPL, given that it had been wound up since November 2020. \nFurther, while the Liquidator was agreeable to ratify Mr Taylor\u2019s actions, he \nhad requested a summary of the proceedings in Indonesia, as well as a list and \ncopies of all documents that he had signed on behalf of the KIPL from \nNovember 2020 to January 2022, as well as any other relevant documents. This \nis so that the Liquidator could make an informed decision whether to ratify \nMr Taylor\u2019s actions. It was after such consideration and further correspondence \nbetween the parties that the Liquidator provided the ratification on 31 January \n2022.\n27 Moreover, while the Liquidator admits that the issuance of the shares in \nBPCI \u201cis far from ideal\u201d, he was ultimately not involved in this affair. In this \nregard, he submits that while it is not clear what documents were signed to \nfacilitate the share issuance, it is clear that the Liquidator did not sign, or ratify, \nVersion No 2: 06 Apr 2023 (15:31 hrs)\nDB International Trust (Singapore) Ltd v \nMedora Xerxes Jamshid[2023] SGHC 83\n15any document on behalf of KIPL in relation to the matter. The Liquidator also \nsays that it is not obvious that the share issuance has had an adverse impact on \nthe value of KIPL\u2019s shares since it has apparently resulted in an injection of \nneeded capital into BPCI. \n(2) My decision: the Liquidator unjustifiably allowed Mr Taylor to act for \nand on behalf of KIPL in too broad a manner\n28 In my judgment, the Liquidator has unjustifiably allowed Mr Taylor to \nact for and on behalf of KIPL in too broad a manner. As such, I find that he has \nfailed to exercise sufficient vigour in the carrying out of his duties. I say so for \nthe following reasons.\n29 First, while I can accept that the Liquidator had provided the ratification \non 31 January 2022 on the basis that the application to nullify the Share Pledge \nwas in the interests of KIPL\u2019s creditors as it would potentially increase the pool \nof assets available for distribution to the unsecured creditors, I do not think this \nobjective was clearly expressed in the broadly framed ratification. In this regard, \nit is important that the ratification purported to \u201cratify any actions\u201d taken by \nMr Taylor in signing any letters and resolutions on behalf of the Company, \n\u201cincluding but not limited to\u201d [emphasis added] the signing of the shareholders\u2019 \nresolution of BPCI, as well as the signing of powers of attorney for the \nappointment of Budidjaja International Lawyers as the Company\u2019s counsel in \nIndonesia to commence any court proceeding and legal action for and on behalf \nof the Company in Indonesia. Therefore, despite what the Liquidator may say \nhis intention was, the broad framing of this ratification clearly extends to the \nsigning of letters and resolutions beyond those necessary to progress the \napplication to nullify the Share Pledge. This is clearly unnecessary and \nVersion No 2: 06 Apr 2023 (15:31 hrs)\nDB International Trust (Singapore) Ltd v \nMedora Xerxes Jamshid[2023] SGHC 83\n16unjustifiable for it effectively gives Mr Taylor a broad latitude to act on behalf \nof KIPL in matters other than the said nullification proceedings.\n30 Second, I find it unsatisfactory that the Liquidator did not find out about \nthe share issuance, which appears to have taken place sometime between \nDecember 2021 and January 2022, before he gave the ratification on 31 January \n2022. Indeed, by the Liquidator\u2019s own admission, he only found out about the \nshare issuance and the resulting dilution of KIPL\u2019s shares in BPCI when he read \nthe affidavit filed by Mr Anil Sharma in support of the applicant\u2019s application \nhere. Since Mr Sharma\u2019s affidavit is dated 20 October 2022 and the Liquidator\u2019s \nown affidavit attesting to how he found out about the share issuance is dated \n25 November 2022, I can only surmise that the Liquidator only found out about \nthe share issuance and the resulting dilution between October and November \n2022. This is at least eight months after he had provided the ratification on \n31 January 2022. This is unsatisfactory considering that these very shares \nconstituted KIPL\u2019s primary assets. \n31 While the Liquidator has now tried to cast the blame on BPCI by saying \nthat he is not a director of, and has no control over BPCI, this is not a satisfactory \nexplanation. This is because given that the primary purpose of the liquidation \nwas to preserve and distribute KIPL\u2019s assets, it would be reasonable to expect \nthe Liquidator to assure himself of the status of KIPL\u2019s primary asset (in the \nform of the shares in BPCI) before providing any ratification that may affect \nthose shares. Furthermore, it was not as if the Liquidator was not put on notice \nof the need to check on the status of KIPL\u2019s shareholding in BPCI. While \nMr Keith Han, who appeared for the applicant, referred me to some \ncorrespondence between the Liquidator\u2019s solicitors and BPCI\u2019s solicitors in \nJanuary 2022 to make good this point, I find that it is not necessary for me to \nVersion No 2: 06 Apr 2023 (15:31 hrs)\nDB International Trust (Singapore) Ltd v \nMedora Xerxes Jamshid[2023] SGHC 83\n17focus on those emails. Instead, on 9 March 2022, the Joint Official Liquidators \nof RF Investment Holding Limited (in official liquidation) (\u201cRF Investment\u201d), \nwhich is a contributory and creditor of KIPL, asked for confirmation \u201cif KIPL, \nbeing the 95% shareholder of BPCI continues to exert control over the \noperations of BPCI\u201d [emphasis added].2 The Liquidator did not respond to this \nspecifically. But had he turned his attention to the matters raised in the letter, \nwhich were not irrelevant to the liquidation at that point, he might have realised \nthat KIPL\u2019s shares in BPCI had been diluted. \n32 Third, while the Liquidator has now followed up on the share issuance \nby seeking clarifications from the parties involved, I do not think that this is \nsufficient to show that the Liquidator had been vigorous in the carrying out of \nhis duties. It is always easy to ask questions after problems have arisen. But it \nis more difficult to avoid having to ask those questions by preventing the \nproblems from arising in the first place. What the Liquidator is doing now, in \nthe face of KIPL\u2019s primary asset being diluted, is to be expected. However, the \nLiquidator\u2019s lack of vigour in carrying out his duties lies in failing to prevent, \nor at least recognise, the share dilution in the first place. In that regard, albeit \nwith the benefit of hindsight, I do not think that the Liquidator has acted \nsatisfactorily. \n33 Accordingly, for all these reasons, I find that the Liquidator has failed \nto display sufficient vigour in carrying out his duties by unjustifiably allowing \nMr Taylor to act for and on behalf of KIPL in Indonesia in too broad a manner, \nwhich has plausibly resulted in loss to KIPL in the form of the dilution of its \nshares in BPCI. \n2 Affidavit of Anil Sharma dated 2 February 2023 at p 503.\nVersion No 2: 06 Apr 2023 (15:31 hrs)\nDB International Trust (Singapore) Ltd v \nMedora Xerxes Jamshid[2023] SGHC 83\n18Whether the Liquidator has unjustifiably not undertaken any personal \ninvestigations into the affairs of KIPL\n(1) The parties\u2019 positions \n34 The applicant advances a second example of how the Liquidator has \nfailed to display sufficient vigour in carrying out his duties, and this is that the \nLiquidator has unjustifiably not undertaken any personal investigations into the \naffairs of KIPL. In this regard, the applicant complains that the Liquidator has \nsimply engaged KPMG Services Pte Ltd (Singapore) (\u201cKPMG\u201d) to carry out \nforensic investigations into KIPL\u2019s affairs. Moreover, the scope, purpose and \nprogress of these investigations are unknown. Yet, the Liquidator has \nconsistently used the ongoing KPMG investigations to explain the lack of \nprogress in the liquidation.\n35 The Liquidator\u2019s response is essentially that the circumstances leading \nto KIPL\u2019s winding up warranted the KPMG investigation. In this regard, \nMr Taylor, shortly after his appointment as director of KIPL on 11 July 2019, \nuncovered multiple suspicious transactions that raised serious questions and, in \nhis opinion, may have involved fraud, bad faith and\/or breach of directors\u2019 \nduties. As a result, in October 2020, Mr Taylor caused KIPL to apply to be \nwound up on the basis that it was just and equitable to do so. Indeed, at that \ntime, there was a concern of a multitude of frivolous suits being brought against \nKIPL from fictitious or disputed creditors. \n36 After the Liquidator commenced the liquidation of KIPL, he found the \nrecords maintained by the former management to be in poor shape. There were \nvarious loans to KIPL which did not appear to be supported by documentation, \nor for which there was no clear commercial justification. On or around \nVersion No 2: 06 Apr 2023 (15:31 hrs)\nDB International Trust (Singapore) Ltd v \nMedora Xerxes Jamshid[2023] SGHC 83\n196 September 2021, the Liquidator formally engaged KPMG to investigate into \nthe affairs of KIPL. KPMG has not completed their investigations. However, on \n1 December 2022, KPMG issued an interim report. \n(2) My decision: the Liquidator has unjustifiably not undertaken any \npersonal investigations into the affairs of KIPL\n37 In my judgment, the Liquidator has unjustifiably not undertaken any \npersonal investigations into the affairs of KIPL but has, instead, relied \nexclusively on KPMG to conduct the relevant investigations. As such, I find \nthat he has failed to exercise sufficient vigour in the carrying out of his duties. I \nhave come to this conclusion for the following reasons.\n38 First, while I can accept that the Liquidator had valid reasons to doubt \nthe records maintained by the former management of KIPL so as to launch an \ninvestigation, it is unsatisfactory that the investigation has still not been \ncompleted even though more than two years have passed since his initial \nappointment as liquidator. In this regard, the Liquidator has not provided a good \nexplanation why it took him almost one year after his initial appointment in \nNovember 2020 to decide to appoint KPMG to conduct the investigation into \nKIPL\u2019s affairs. I say this despite the explanation provided by Mr Daniel Soo, \nwho appeared for the Liquidator, that the Liquidator had other matters to attend \nto during the intervening period. Further, while I accept that KPMG will require \nsome time to complete its investigation, it is unsatisfactory that the Liquidator \ndoes not appear to have sought regular updates from KPMG on the state of the \ninvestigation. Indeed, in his affidavit filed in this present application, the \nLiquidator has not exhibited any correspondence between him and KPMG in \nthe period between September 2021 and November 2022. In fact, the only \ncorrespondence that the Liquidator has exhibited is an email between his \nVersion No 2: 06 Apr 2023 (15:31 hrs)\nDB International Trust (Singapore) Ltd v \nMedora Xerxes Jamshid[2023] SGHC 83\n20solicitors and KPMG on 24 November 2022, where KPMG was asked if it was \nready to issue its interim report. Given that the present application was filed on \n20 October 2022, I can only surmise that the said email was prompted by the \napplication and that, if the application had not been filed, the Liquidator might \nhave continued to allow KPMG\u2019s investigation to continue in abeyance without \nseeking any update in the interim. In essence, it appears that the Liquidator was \ncontent to let the KPMG investigation to go on for more than a year without \nseeking any update. \n39 Second, while it is reasonable for a liquidator to engage external \nexpertise to supplement areas of his investigation, it is quite a different matter \nfor a liquidator to effectively delegate all responsibility of such investigation to \nthe external party. In this regard, a liquidator has the responsibility of providing \nthe scope, purpose and progress of these investigations to interested parties. I \nunderstand the Liquidator\u2019s position to be that since he has not admitted \nany PODs, there are no creditors who can claim to be interested in these \ninvestigations. However, even if I accept that the Liquidator\u2019s approach can be \nmaintained (and see my conclusions to the contrary below), it remains that \nputative creditors such as the applicant remain interested parties who should be \nkept informed of the investigations. It is unsatisfactory that the Liquidator has \nnot provided much information on, for instance, the scope of KPMG\u2019s \ninvestigation, to interested parties. For example, on 22 October 2021, the Joint \nOfficial Liquidators of RF Investment sought clarification as to the involvement \nand scope of KPMG\u2019s investigation. Further, on 9 March 2022, the Joint \nOfficial Liquidators also asked for the basis of KPMG\u2019s appointment and \nindicated that COI approval should have been sought for its engagement. The \nLiquidator merely responded to say that the KPMG report will be shared once \na COI has been formed. Indeed, the Liquidator has not even exhibited the letter \nVersion No 2: 06 Apr 2023 (15:31 hrs)\nDB International Trust (Singapore) Ltd v \nMedora Xerxes Jamshid[2023] SGHC 83\n21of engagement with KPMG in his affidavit here which would have set out the \nscope of the investigation. A few days before the hearing for this matter, the \nLiquidator applied to admit a further affidavit, in which he exhibited an update \ndated 25 January 2023 that he gave to parties who have filed a POD, including \nthe applicant. I allowed the affidavit to be admitted since the applicant did not \nobject. However, this update has come quite late in the day and appears, once \nagain, to have been prompted by the present application.\n40 Third, even disregarding the Liquidator\u2019s failure to provide information \non KPMG\u2019s investigations to interested parties, it appears to me that the scope \nof such investigation is also objectively unclear. As I have mentioned above, \nthe Liquidator has not exhibited the letter of engagement with KPMG that \nwould have clarified such scope. If KPMG has been engaged to investigate into \nthe affairs of KIPL so as to ascertain the veracity of the PODs that have been \nfiled, then it is puzzling why the applicant has not been asked for further \ndocumentation or information in relation to its POD. Indeed, the Liquidator\u2019s \nonly response to date in relation to the applicant\u2019s POD is that he has been \nunable to verify the underlying debt. Mr Soo\u2019s explanation during the hearing \nwas that the scale of the investigation is very large and that it goes beyond just \nthe applicant\u2019s alleged debt. Be that as it may, that does not explain why, even \nafter KPMG has seen it fit to issue an interim report, the applicant was never \nasked about the POD it has filed. Without intending to express any doubt on the \nactual rigour of KPMG\u2019s investigation, this does show that, absent further \nclarification from the Liquidator, the scope of KPMG\u2019s investigation to be \nunclear. \n41 Accordingly, for all these reasons, I find that the Liquidator has failed \nto display sufficient vigour in carrying out his duties by unjustifiably not \nVersion No 2: 06 Apr 2023 (15:31 hrs)\nDB International Trust (Singapore) Ltd v \nMedora Xerxes Jamshid[2023] SGHC 83\n22undertaking any personal investigations into the affairs of KIPL and relying \nexclusively on KPMG\u2019s investigation without adequate oversight. \nConclusion\n42 In view of my conclusion that the Liquidator has failed to display \nsufficient vigour in carrying out his duties by (a) unjustifiably allowing \nMr Taylor to act for and on behalf of KIPL and therefore causing loss to KIPL, \nand (b) unjustifiably not personally undertaking any investigations into the \naffairs of KIPL, I find that the applicant has shown cause for the Liquidator\u2019s \nremoval. Put another way, I am satisfied that the removal of the Liquidator \nwould be in the \u201creal, substantial and honest interest of the liquidation\u201d, bearing \nin mind that one purpose for which the Liquidator was appointed was to realise \nthe value of KIPL\u2019s assets, which the Liquidator has failed to achieve in \nstanding by while KIPL\u2019s primary asset was diluted. While this would be \nsufficient to enliven my discretion to remove the Liquidator, I will examine the \nother reasons advanced by the applicant for the removal of the Liquidator. \nWhether the Liquidator failed to obtain the requisite approvals and comply \nwith his statutory obligations\nThe general law\n43 The applicant has cited three examples to show how the Liquidator \nfailed to obtain the requisite approvals and comply with his statutory \nobligations. While the applicant has not cited a direct authority on this point, it \nis reasonable that there will be a justifiable loss of confidence by the creditors \nin the liquidator\u2019s ability \u201cto realise the assets of the company to their best \nadvantage and to pursue claims with due diligence\u201d (see the decision of the \nEnglish Court of"}

{"casename":"2023_SGHC_9","fact":"the facts of Saiful, where a shorter period \nof imprisonment only partially overlapped with a longer term of \ndisqualification.

This \nwould result in a longer period of 5 years\u2019 and 4 months\u2019 imprisonment. It would \nbe perverse if the commission of additional driving offences by the appellant \nnot only resulted in a more lenient imprisonment sentence for him, but also \nlacked any additional consequence through a disqualification order. I thus \nconsider it appropriate that the disqualification order be imposed in addition to \nthe period of imprisonment for the appellant\u2019s other offences. \n21 Fourth, the appellant committed the s 65 RTA offence while absconding \nfrom bail, when he had already been convicted and sentenced to a lengthy term \nof imprisonment. This increases the relative importance of deterrence compared \nto the case of Saiful. While prospective offenders are unlikely to base their \nactions on the consideration that a potential disqualification period would be \novertaken by a subsequent imprisonment sentence, they are far more likely to \nbase their actions on the consideration that any potential disqualification period \nwould be rendered completely irrelevant by an existing period of imprisonment \nthat they are already liable to while absconding from bail. Were periods of \ndisqualification for offenders absconding from bail to always run concurrently \nwith their existing imprisonment sentences, there would be no marginal \ndisincentive for accused persons who have already been sentenced to lengthy \nterms of imprisonment not to commit further driving offences.\nVersion No 1: 12 Jan 2023 (12:42 hrs)\nMuhammad Ramzaan s\/o Akhbar v PP[2023] SGHC 9\n822 In my judgment, it is for this reason that Sundaresh Menon CJ in Saiful \nexplicitly distinguished situations where the offence for which a term of \nimprisonment is imposed is committed before the set of offences for which \ndisqualification is ordered: Saiful at [49]. Where an offender knows he has \nalready committed an offence that may attract imprisonment, there must be a \nmarginal disincentive to deter further offending that is likely to attract a \ndisqualification order but not additional imprisonment (such as speeding). \n23 The same logic should apply to offenders sentenced to substantial \nperiods of imprisonment, who then reoffend while absconding from bail \npending"}

According to the Plaintiffs, they and the Defendants agreed to enter into a \u201c50\/50 joint venture with Patrick and Steven\u201d Ho, and to use Invest Ho as the joint venture company instead of incorporating a new company. 9', 'Based on their discussions, the agreement between the Plaintiffs and the Defendants at that time was for 50% of the total shares in Invest Ho to be issued to HSK and HSF, with HSK and HSF holding the shares on trust for themselves and for the three Plaintiffs in equal proportions of 1\/5 share per each brother (\u201c1995 Agreement\u201d). 10', 'HAS and Peng Zuo were not party to the 1995 Agreement. 11', '9\\u2003The Plaintiffs\u2019 case is that the five brothers\u2019 shares in Invest Ho were paid for by a loan from the Bank of East Asia which was in turn secured against the Syed Alwi Property. 12', '10\\u2003Subsequently, in the period around 2006 to 2007, Patrick Ho and Steven Ho exited Invest Ho and ceased being joint venture partners with the Ho Brothers. From the ACRA records and other documents provided, it appeared that Patrick Ho and Steven Ho ceased being shareholders of Invest Ho sometime in 2007. 13', 'This left HSK and HSF as the sole registered shareholders of Invest Ho. The Plaintiffs\u2019 case is that at this stage, HSK and HSF continued to hold all their shares in Invest Ho on trust for the five brothers (ie not including HAS or his son Peng Zuo) in equal proportions. 14', '11\\u2003The Plaintiffs\u2019 case is that they received constant verbal reassurances from HSK over the years between 2007 and 2012 that he and HSK would transfer to the Plaintiffs their respective shares in Invest Ho. These communications were not documented because of their familial relationship. 15', 'As at 2012, no share transfer had taken place. Sometime in 2012, therefore, the three Plaintiffs and the two Defendants held a meeting, during which they agreed to record their agreement that the shares in Invest Ho which were held in HSF\u2019s and HSK\u2019s names belonged equally to each of them. 16', '12\\u2003At this meeting, it was agreed that since Invest Ho had been built up as a result of the contributions from all the brothers in the Ho family, the shares in Invest Ho belonged equally to each and every one of the brothers, including the eldest brother HAS (who had not been included in the 1995 Agreement). HSF himself proposed that they include HAS \u201cby allocating to him an equal portion of shares in recognition of [HAS\u2019s] contributions to Invest Ho\u201d. 17', 'This was agreed to by all five brothers. 18', 'As HAS was in ill health at this stage, HSK proposed \u2013 and the others agreed \u2013 that the shares allocated to HAS be given to the latter\u2019s son Peng Zuo. 19', '13\\u2003HAS, on being asked, also agreed to the above arrangement (\u201c2012 Agreement\u201d). Thereafter, the Plaintiffs, the Defendants and Peng Zuo each executed a document, \u201cCompany Resolution (07 August 2012)\u201d (\u201c2012 Company Resolution\u201d) prepared by HSF, wherein it was documented that all 2,500,000 Invest Ho shares were to be equally divided among the six of them. The paid up and issued shares in Invest Ho totaled 2,500,000, so this meant that the six of them would each own 416,666.67 shares. 20', '14\\u2003On or around 28 February 2012, the Plaintiffs and Defendants also started a United Kingdom company known as Forward Realty Limited (\u201cForward Realty\u201d) which developed properties in the UK. The Plaintiffs\u2019 position is that in keeping with the agreement of equal ownership between them, the Plaintiffs, the 1st and 2nd Defendants, and Peng Zuo each held one share in Forward Realty. 21', '15\\u2003The Plaintiffs\u2019 case is that in line with the agreement and understanding that the Ho Brothers each had an equal share in the family businesses, Invest Ho had been operated by the Ho Brothers collectively since 1995, with each of them making contributions and efforts towards the running of the company. Inter alia, the Plaintiffs assert that HST and Edwin had contributed and\/or advanced and\/or loaned their personal funds to Invest Ho in the period 2007 to 2020. These monies had come from their personal bank accounts; and these contributions or advances were made to assist Invest Ho in its business operations and to meet its liabilities and expenses \u2013 especially in respect of the re-development of 22 Hillside Drive. These monies were also used to redeem the loan in respect of 1 Mactaggart Road. 22', 'In total, the funds contributed by HST and Edwin to Invest Ho amounted to around $4,654,11.00. 23', '16\\u2003As another example of their contributions to Invest Ho, the Plaintiffs point to HST and Edwin having used their own company to take loans in order to assist Invest Ho in the payment of development charges to URA for the 22 Hillside Drive development. HST and Edwin jointly owned a company called M Design & Build Pte Ltd (\u201cM Design\u201d) which was incorporated in October 2009 and whose business was principally that of general building contractors. M Design lent to Invest Ho \u2013 interest-free \u2013 a sum of $2,193.674.14. 24', '17\\u2003As yet another example, the Plaintiffs assert that HSW agreed to mortgage his property at 82 Boundary Road as collateral to obtain an overdraft loan facility of $1,925,00.00 for Invest Ho. 25', 'HSW states that to date, 82 Boundary Road remains a security for this facility while he remains a guarantor in respect of this facility. 26', '18\\u2003Following the 2012 Agreement, HSF and HSK did not transfer to the Plaintiffs and Peng Zuo their respective shares in Invest Ho. In light of their familial relationship, the Plaintiffs did not insist. They also felt reassured by the existence of the 2012 Agreement. 27', '19\\u2003Sometime in late 2016, the Plaintiffs and HSF had a meeting during which HSF agreed that out of his shareholding of 1,550,000 Invest Ho shares, he would transfer 310,000 shares to each of the Plaintiffs and Peng Zuo. HSF informed the Plaintiffs that HSK was unwilling to transfer any shares to them. However, as HSF claimed that he \u201chad a way to persuade [HSK]\u201d to do so, the Plaintiffs left it to HSF to speak to HSK. 28', '20\\u2003On 1 March 2017, HST transferred 310,000 shares each to HST, HSW, Edwin and Peng Zuo. This made for a total of 1,240,000 shares transferred from HST. 29', 'HSF and HSK \u2013 who were then the directors and registered shareholders of Invest Ho \u2013 passed a resolution on 1 March 2017 stating that the transfer of the 1,240,000 shares by HSF to the Plaintiffs and Peng Zuo was approved. 30', 'These share transfers and the updated shareholding positions were duly reflected in Invest Ho\u2019s ACRA business profile ACRA the following day (2 March 2017). ACRA records showed these changes as having been lodged by Invest Ho\u2019s company secretary Chew Lee Sam (\u201cMdm Chew\u201d). 31', 'The Plaintiffs\u2019 position is that there were no monies to be paid to HSF for the transfer of the shares. 32', 'Each of the share transfer forms did, however, state that there was \u201cconsideration\u201d of $4030.00. This amount was written by Mdm Chew. Mdm Chew based this calculation on the total net asset value of Invest Ho being $32,487.00 and therefore, the net asset value per share (at a total of 2,500,000 shares) being $0.01299 (rounded up to $0.013). Stamp duty of $18 was paid on each of the share transfers. 33', '21\\u2003HSK did not at any time transfer to the Plaintiffs and Peng Zuo any of the shares registered in his name. The Plaintiffs contend that HSK failed, refused and neglected to transfer his shares despite demands by HST and HSW that he do so. The Plaintiffs\u2019 case is that HSK continues to hold the Plaintiffs\u2019 respective shares in Invest Ho on trust for them. 34', '22\\u2003According to the Plaintiffs, they found out about the unlawful change in their shareholding position sometime in July 2019, when HSW obtained a copy of Invest Ho\u2019s ACRA business profile. 35', 'From the ACRA business profile, the Plaintiff discovered that their 930,000 shares (310,000 shares per each Plaintiff) had been transferred to HSF without their knowledge, consent or authorization. This left HSF as the largest shareholder in Invest Ho with 1,240,000 shares, while HSK held 950,000 shares and Peng Zuo continued to hold 310,000 shares. When questioned, HSF admitted that he had changed the ACRA records, but failed to give the Plaintiffs any reasonable or cogent explanation as to why he had brought about this wrongful transfer of the Plaintiffs\u2019 shares. 36', 'Further investigations showed that the transfers of HST\u2019s, HSW\u2019s and Edwin\u2019s shares to HSF were lodged by HSF personally on 22 October 2018, ie not by Invest Ho\u2019s company secretary. 37', '23\\u2003The Plaintiffs\u2019 subsequently engaged lawyers and made a demand for the wrongfully transferred shares to be returned to them, as well as for HSK to transfer to them the shares he was still holding on trust for them. 38', 'They commenced these proceedings after failing to reach any agreement with the two Defendants. 39', '24\\u2003I next summarise the Defendants\u2019 version of events. In gist, the Defendants\u2019 case is that the Ho Brothers were never involved in any family business or family enterprise: the businesses and\/or properties which were acquired over the years belonged to the Defendants, and the Plaintiffs had no part in them. The Defendants\u2019 position, therefore, is that HPK Enterprise belonged to them (the Defendants) and was run by them despite the fact that HPK Enterprise was initially registered in HSK\u2019s name only. 40', '25\\u2003As for HTS Engineering, the Defendants\u2019 position is that HTS Engineering was never involved in the development of the Syed Alwi Property, and no funds belonging to HTS Engineering were utilized for the purchase of that property. Instead, the Defendants claim that they utilized monies they had earned from HPK Enterprise to purchase the Syed Alwi Property. The Defendants also deny that HSW contributed monies to purchase the adjacent plot of land next to the Syed Alwi Property: according to the Defendants, HSW was very young at that time, and had neither income nor financial capacity to contribute. 41', '26\\u2003The Defendants further deny that there was ever any agreement between the Plaintiffs and HSF to purchase the Syed Alwi Property together and to hold it in HSF and HSK\u2019s name on trust for the Ho Brothers. 42', '27\\u2003The Defendants deny the existence of the 1995 Agreement. It is their case that the Plaintiffs were never part of the discussions concerning the joint venture in Invest Ho with Patrick Ho and Steven Ho. According to the Defendants, the Plaintiffs had no involvement whatsoever in the affairs of HTS Engineering; and the 1st and 2nd Defendants thus had no reason to involve them in any discussion regarding the joint venture. 43', 'The Defendants\u2019 position is that HSW and HST only became involved in Invest Ho\u2019s business when they were appointed as directors in 2017 and 2018 respectively \u2013 whereas Edwin had no intention of participating in the affairs of Invest Ho as he had set up a sole proprietorship himself. 44', '28\\u2003The Defendants deny that the development charges for the 22 Hillside Drive development were paid by contributions from HST and Edwin. Instead, the Defendants claim that Invest Ho paid for these development charges itself \u201cby refinancing 5 units of factories situated at 1 Mactaggart Road with Maybank and\/or from Lei Shing Hong Capital (Singapore) Pte Ltd [\u201cLSH Capital\u201d] by using the property at 25 and 27 Lorong 104 Changi Road\u201d. 45', 'The Defendants\u2019 position is that although the loans were taken in HST\u2019s and Edwin\u2019s names, it was actually \u201cdone on behalf of [HSF]\u201d. 46', '29\\u2003Not surprisingly, the Defendants also deny the existence of 2012 Agreement. Their position is that the transfer of shares by HSF to the Plaintiffs and Peng Zuo in March 2017 came about as a result of HSF having decided to sell some of his shares to the Plaintiffs and Peng Zuo. In fact, in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, HSF claims that at the 2012 meeting, both he and HSK had proposed selling \u201ca portion of [their] 2.5 million shares\u201d to the Plaintiffs and Peng Zuo at $2.50 per share. At that point, HSF held 1,550,000 shares in Invest Ho and HSK held 950,000 shares. 47', 'HSF claims that the Defendants\u2019 intention in offering to sell their shares was \u201cfor the entire 2.5 million shares in Invest Ho to be split equally amongst the six of [them]\u201d (ie the three Plaintiffs, the two Defendants and Peng Zuo), \u201cin exchange for the payment\u201d to the Defendants of a total sale price of $4,166,666.67 (at $2.50 per share). 48', 'The Plaintiffs were the ones who allegedly backed away from proceeding with the purchase of the shares in 2012 due to uncertainty over the Hillside Development; and the 2012 sale of shares was accordingly \u201caborted\u201d. 49', '30\\u2003As to how the transfer of shares to the Plaintiffs and Peng Zuo came about in 2017, the Defendants claim that at a meeting which they had with the Plaintiffs in March 2017, HSF \u201crevisited the possibility of selling and distributing [his] shares to the Plaintiffs and Peng Zuo, to raise funds for the Hillside Development\u201d. This time, HSK refused to sell any of his shares as he was worried that the Plaintiffs would not pay him after obtaining the shares. 50', '31\\u2003According to HSF, his offer at the March 2017 meeting was for his 1,550,000 shares to be \u201csplit equally\u201d between himself, the Plaintiffs and Peng Zuo. This was how he came to transfer 310,000 shares each to the Plaintiffs and Peng Zuo \u2013 for which he was to be paid a total sum of $3,100,000 (at $2.50 per share for 1,240,000 shares in total). 51', 'This meant that the Plaintiffs and Peng Zuo were each obliged to pay him $775,000 for the 310,000 shares transferred to each of them. HSF claims that he also attached a number of \u201crequirement[s]\u201d to his offer to sell shares, such as a requirement that he would \u201ccontinue to be responsible for dealing with the architect, consultant and surveyor for the Hillside Development\u201d. 52', '32\\u2003HSF claims that it was the Plaintiffs who provided the share transfer forms to him for signing \u2013 and that when he signed the share transfer forms, they were blank save for \u201ccertain typewritten portions\u201d. 53', 'HSF\u2019s position is that he does not know how the handwritten figure of $4,030 as the \u201cconsideration\u201d for each transfer of shares came about. 54', 'In any event, HSF claims that the Plaintiffs and Peng Zuo never paid him this stated sum of $4,030 each \u2013 much less the sale price of $775,000 each. 55', '33\\u2003Despite the non-payment of the alleged sale price, HSF proceeded to effect the transfer of his shares to the Plaintiffs (and Peng Zuo) because they were brothers and he trusted the Plaintiffs. 56', 'According to the Defendants, no share scrips were ever issued to the Plaintiffs precisely because they failed to pay HSF for the shares. 57', 'Subsequently, HSF transferred the Plaintiffs\u2019 930,000 shares back to himself \u201cdue to a failure to provide consideration on their end\u201d. 58', 'The Defendants deny, therefore, that the subsequent change in shareholding effected by HSF was unlawful.'"}

The last two people to see Ms Teo alive were the appellant and one Mr Ragil Putra Setia Sukmarahjana (\u201cMr Ragil\u201d).

This led to the appellant being arrested on 15 December 2020 and questioned again. On 17 December 2020, the appellant was charged with the murder of Ms Teo in furtherance of a common intention between him and Mr Ragil. In the course of further investigations, the appellant revealed to the authorities that, in 2007, he had deposited Ms Teo\u2019s corpse in a public place, misappropriated her property, failed to report her death, given false statements to the police and fabricated false evidence to evade suspicion. The appellant maintained, however, that he was not in any way responsible for causing Ms Teo\u2019s death.', '4\\u2003From the time of his arrest on 15 December 2020, the appellant remained in remand because he was facing a charge of murder, which is a non-bailable offence. Slightly more than 18 months after it brought the Charge, on 27 June 2022, the Prosecution applied under s 232(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 (2020 Rev Ed) (\u201cCPC\u201d) for a DNATA in respect of the Charge. The appellant objected to the Prosecution\u2019s application and sought a DATA instead. The DJ allowed the Prosecution\u2019s application. On the same day, the Prosecution tendered six new charges arising from the appellant\u2019s admissions about his conduct after Ms Teo\u2019s death.', '5\\u2003On 14 October 2022, the appellant pleaded guilty to four of those charges: one for depositing Ms Teo\u2019s corpse with Mr Ragil; one for dishonestly appropriating Ms Teo\u2019s property with Mr Ragil; one for giving false information to the police with Mr Ragil; and one for fabricating false evidence with Mr Ragil. He consented to having the remaining two charges taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

The plaintiffs had invested into what turned out \nto be a Ponzi scheme of Bernard L Madoff. The plaintiffs contended that the \ndefendant bank\u2019s relationship managers had made negligent or fraudulent \nmisrepresentations that induced the plaintiffs to invest, and remain invested, \nuntil the fund collapsed. The court held at [75]: \u201c\u2026the Plaintiffs\u2019 understanding \nof the representation that Fairfield Sentry \u2018was a safe and stable investment with \nconsistent good returns and low volatility\u2019 had nothing to do with the risk of \nloss due to managerial fraud. What the Plaintiffs had in mind when Fairfield \nSentry was marketed to them was investment performance and market volatility. \nFraud and managerial wrongdoing did not cross their minds.\u201d As what caused \nthe loss was the fraudulent deeds of Madoff, rather than adverse market \nmovements, ie, market risk, the representations which the plaintiffs understood \nto relate to market risk were irrelevant (at [73]).\n58 In the same way, what Ken and Sally said about SureWin4U was \nfocused on the viability of SureWin4U\u2019s way of making money \u2013 by gambling. \nIn describing SureWin4U, Ken and Sally were not talking about whether \nSureWin4U was legitimate and not a scam. Indeed, it would have been \nincongruous for Ken and Sally to have said, at SureWin4U events: \u201cPeter and \nPhilip are not fraudsters, SureWin4U is not a scam, you will not be cheated of \nyour money.\u201d SureWin4U events, and its promotional materials, focused on the \npositive benefits of participation, with success stories like that of Ken and Sally. \n\u201cFraud and managerial wrongdoing\u201d was never a topic.\nVersion No 1: 14 Apr 2023 (11:26 hrs)\nChan Pik Sun v Wan Hoe Keet and others[2023] SGHC 96\n1959 On Sandra\u2019s part, at that time, she was not focused on whether \nSureWin4U was legitimate and not a scam. She was focused on the returns from \nthe packages on offer, and on SureWin4U\u2019s method of making money to pay \nthose returns \u2013 by gambling at baccarat.\n60 Sandra was introduced to SureWin4U in January 2014 by her husband\u2019s \nfriend, Zhou Jing Hua. She only met Ken and Sally at RPH two months later. I \ndo not believe that Sandra understood what Ken and Sally (as earlier \nparticipants) said about SureWin4U as a factual representation that SureWin4U \nwas legitimate, not a scam. The fact that Sandra bought 2 packages, and Silver \nPackages rather than Bronze Packages at that, prior to attending the 99.8% class, \nsuggests that whether the scheme was legitimate was not a concern of hers then.\n61 In summary, I find in relation to the first tranche of Sandra\u2019s investments \nin SureWin4U, that:\n(a) Ken and Sally did not represent as a fact that SureWin4U was \nlegitimate, not a scam \u2013 they only expressed their positive opinion about \nparticipating in the scheme;\n(b) Sandra did not rely on what Ken and Sally said about the scheme \nbeing \u201csafe and profitable\u201d, in making the first tranche of her \ninvestments \u2013 she considered that there was no risk in making those \ninvestments not because Ken and Sally had assured her that SureWin4U \nwas legitimate and not a scam; she considered that there was no risk \nbecause SureWin4U had promised to refund what she had paid, if she \ncould disprove the 99.8% formula; and\nVersion No 1: 14 Apr 2023 (11:26 hrs)\nChan Pik Sun v Wan Hoe Keet and others[2023] SGHC 96\n20(c) Ken and Sally did not represent that SureWin4U was legitimate, \nnot a scam; their description of the scheme was about the viability of \nSureWin4U making money through its gambling business model.\n62 To that, I would add that in all the messages in evidence between Sandra \nand her downlines, Sandra never referred to any of the representations that she \nnow says Ken, Sally or Sebastian made, which she claims induced her to invest \nin SureWin4U. Instead, she mentioned SureWin4U\u2019s promised returns, \nSureWin4U\u2019s gambling formulas, what SureWin4U said in its brochures, and \nhow she believed in SureWin4U. If, in fact, any of the alleged representations \nby Ken, Sally or Sebastian had played a real and substantial part in Sandra\u2019s \ndecision to invest in SureWin4U, one would have expected to see that \nmentioned in her messages to her downlines. But that is not to be found. The \nexplanation that Sandra offered was that her downlines also attended the \nSureWin4U seminars, and so they would have heard for themselves what was \nsaid at those seminars.27 I do not find that explanation convincing. The same \nmay be said about SureWin4U\u2019s gambling methods, which those who purchased \npackages could attend classes on. Yet, Sandra went on at length about how much \nshe believed in those gambling methods. Gambling, and the lucrative returns \npromised by SureWin4U, were foremost in Sandra\u2019s mind. \n63 Sandra\u2019s own description of what she told her downline Ms Feng is \nnoteworthy:28\nI only told [her] what Ken and Sally had told me.

On or around early May 2014, 1 met up with Sandra in Hong \nKong. She told me that she had just returned from her trip to \nSingapore, where she attended a conference organised by \nSureWin4U, which was an investment scheme she was \nparticipating in. She told me that the returns were lucrative. \nShe shared with me about how SureWin4U operated, and the \n99.8% class that she had attended during the conference.\n6. Sandra also showed me a promotional brochure that \nSureWin4U had distributed. \u2026 I recall that SureWin4U was \ndescribed in it as a safe and profitable investment scheme. To \nme, that meant it was a genuine scheme and not some sort of \ndubious scheme.\n7. In reliance on the representations made in the promotional \nbrochure that the scheme was safe and profitable, I \npurchased\u2026\n66 There is again no reference to any \u201csafe and profitable\u201d representation \nby Ken and Sally, nor any of the other representations that Sandra is now suing \non. Shelly Wong invested in reliance on what SureWin4U was saying about \nitself in the brochure, after being told by Sandra about the lucrative returns, how \nSureWin4U operated, and the 99.8% class. \n29 Ms Wong\u2019s AEIC, paras 5\u20137.\nVersion No 1: 14 Apr 2023 (11:26 hrs)\nChan Pik Sun v Wan Hoe Keet and others[2023] SGHC 96\n2267 Further, I find that Sandra\u2019s conduct in the aftermath of the collapse of \nSureWin4U is inconsistent with her assertion that she had invested in reliance \non representations by Ken, Sally, and Sebastian. I will address this later.\nSandra\u2019s second tranche investment\n68 The second tranche of Sandra\u2019s investments into SureWin4U happened \nin May 2014, after Sandra had attended the Suntec Conference held from 1 to 3 \nMay 2014, during which she attended the 99.8% class.\n(1) The SureWin4U promotional booklet and brochure\n69 Sandra claimed that at the Suntec Conference, Ken and Sally were the \nones who distributed the SureWin4U promotional booklet and brochure; she \nseemed to suggest that they thereby bore responsibility for whatever was said \nin those documents.\n70 I find that the SureWin4U promotional booklet and brochure were \ndistributed by SureWin4U, not by Ken and Sally; moreover, Ken and Sally \ncannot be held responsible for everything said in those documents.\n71 Sandra conceded that she had no basis to say that Ken and Sally had \nauthored those documents, or printed them.30 She said that when she passed \nbrochures to her downlines, and spoke to them about SureWin4U and how she \nbelieved in it, that was different from what Ken and Sally did to her, because \nshe was honest and they were dishonest.31 Putting state of mind to one side, what \n30 Transcript, 10 May 2022, pages 43 to 44.\n31 Transcript, 10 May 2022, pages 47 to 49.\nVersion No 1: 14 Apr 2023 (11:26 hrs)\nChan Pik Sun v Wan Hoe Keet and others[2023] SGHC 96\n23Sandra did in sharing (with her downlines) her positive experience with \nSureWin4U, was the same as what Ken and Sally did in relation to Sandra.\n72 In a similar vein, Sandra agreed that when she spoke at a SureWin4U \nevent on 15 June 2014, she was expressing her experience of how profitable it \nhad been for her to be an investor in SureWin4U.32\n73 The brochure claimed that SureWin4U was a \u201cprofitable and safe \noption\u201d which \u201cEnables you to make a lot of money, but it\u2019s safe. It\u2019s not just \ntalk, but is proven to work.\u201d33 \u201cSafe\u201d in the context of those statements by \nSureWin4U, referred to the viability of SureWin4U\u2019s business model of making \nmoney by gambling, particularly given the \u201cproven to work\u201d reference. \nSureWin4U was not saying, \u201cwe are legitimate, we are not a scam\u201d, but if that \nmight be implied because SureWin4U was the party running the scheme, that \nmeaning cannot be attributed to Ken and Sally (or Sebastian), who did not run \nthe scheme, but were participants in it, as discussed earlier.\n(2) The representations about Ken and Sally\u2019s earnings from SureWin4U\n74 I do however find that Ken and Sally should bear some responsibility \nfor the statements made in the promotional booklet and brochure, and at the \nSuntec Conference, about their earnings from the scheme. There were three \naspects to this:\n(a) that Ken and Sally had earnings of HK$201,325,564.70;34\n32 Transcript, 10 May 2022, pages 97 to 98.\n33 8AB 2221.\n34 7AB 2121.\nVersion No 1: 14 Apr 2023 (11:26 hrs)\nChan Pik Sun v Wan Hoe Keet and others[2023] SGHC 96\n24(b) that SureWin4U had gifted Ken and Sally a Ferrari sportscar for \nthem completing something in 58 days;35 and\n(c) that Ken and Sally had received a yacht from SureWin4U for \ntheir participation in the scheme.\n75 Sandra had earlier alleged that it was untrue that Ken and Sally had \nreceived the yacht from SureWin4U, but this appears to have been dropped in \nher closing submissions. In any event, I accept Ken and Sally\u2019s position that the \nyacht was paid for with cash from Peter Ong \u2013 there was thus nothing false \nabout the representation that they had received a yacht for their participation in \nthe scheme.\n76 The representations about the earnings of about HK$201 million, and \nthe Ferrari, however, had some element of exaggeration.\n77 The HK$201 million figure included future earnings on the packages \nKen and Sally had;36 that was not a sum that Ken and Sally could demand \nimmediate payment of.37 Ken and Sally\u2019s position is that they had withdrawn \nsome S$7 million to $10 million before SureWin4U collapsed, and what they \nhad in the scheme was still worth some $10.5 million. Based on those figures, \ntheir earnings up to the time of SureWin4U\u2019s collapse were no more than $20.5 \nmillion (around some HK$123 million) not the HK$201 million figure that in \nMay 2022 they were said to have earned.\n35 10 AB 2820.\n36 Transcript, 28 July 2022, page 93; \n37 16 August 2022, pages 24\u201325.\nVersion No 1: 14 Apr 2023 (11:26 hrs)\nChan Pik Sun v Wan Hoe Keet and others[2023] SGHC 96\n2578 The HK$201 million figure was also exaggerated in that it included the \nvalue of what SureWin4U had paid towards the Ferrari (some $138,000) and \nthe yacht (some $750,000).38 The impression given, however, was that Ken and \nSally had received a Ferrari and a yacht on top of HK$201 million in earnings. \n79 The supposed gift of the Ferrari was itself an exaggeration in that \nalthough SureWin4U first paid the full $398,000 price of the car, that was on \nthe basis that SureWin4U would ultimately only contribute $138,000 towards \nit; the balance of $260,000 was to be repaid by Ken and Sally by 12 monthly \ndeductions of their YB.39\n80 SureWin4U had \u201ccommitment challenges\u201d with rewards that included \n\u201cYB 100,000 car rewards\u201d, which accords with Ken and Sally\u2019s position that \nSureWin4U\u2019s ultimate contribution towards their Ferrari was YB 100,000, \nwhich was equivalent to $138,000.\n81 The SureWin4U June Sri Lanka Commitment Challenge in respect of \nSandra40 made express reference to such \u201cYB 100,000 car rewards\u201d. In a 27 July \n2014 message, Sebastian asked Sandra if she wanted 6 property packages under \nher own name because of \u201c100k for car funds\u201d.41\n82 Had Sandra thought in May 2014 that SureWin4U had given Ken and \nSally the full value of a Ferrari, by June or July 2014 she should have realised \nthat the value of SureWin4U\u2019s car rewards was YB 100,000 ($138,000). I do \nnot, however, consider Ken and Sally\u2019s Ferrari to have played a real and \n38 Transcript, 28 July 2022, page 89.\n39 Transcript, 28 July 2022, pages 20 and 27; 13 May 2022, page 203.\n40 7AB 2149\u20132150.\n41 2AB 503.\nVersion No 1: 14 Apr 2023 (11:26 hrs)\nChan Pik Sun v Wan Hoe Keet and others[2023] SGHC 96\n26significant role in Sandra\u2019s decision to invest \u2013 what was said about the Ferrari \nshe subsumes in the \u201csafe and profitable\u201d representation, and the difference of \n$260,000 (being what Ken and Sally were liable to repay in instalments from \ntheir YB) is a small amount in comparison with their earnings figure of HK$201 \nmillion.\n83 Returning then to the earnings figure of HK$201 million: the value of \nSureWin4U\u2019s contributions towards the Ferrari and the yacht, even if one were \nto use the full value of the Ferrari ($398,000), would be some $1,148,000 or \nHK$6,888,000 out of the HK$201 million figure \u2013 around 3.5% of the total. So, \nit is the exaggeration by including future earnings that is more significant.\n84 As I noted above, based on their own evidence Ken and Sally\u2019s earnings \nfrom SureWin4U were no more than $20.5 million (HK$123 million) at the time \nSureWin4U collapsed in September 2014. The figure of HK$201 million was \nrepresented in May 2014, some 4 months earlier. As their earnings were \naccumulated progressively, their earnings as of May 2014 would have been \nsomewhat less than $20.5 million (HK$123 million); but those earnings would \nstill have been in the millions of dollars, whether in terms of $ or HK$.\n85 I do not accept that, if Ken and Sally\u2019s earnings as of May 2014 had \nbeen accurately stated, say, as HK$100 million ($16 million) rather than \nHK$201 million, that would have made a real and significant difference to \nSandra\u2019s decision to invest further. It would still have been a sizeable, \nimpressive sum. Again, Sandra\u2019s case is not so much that the exaggeration in \nthe figure  made a significant difference to her, but more that Ken and Sally\u2019s \nsuccess story was part and parcel of the \u201csale and profitable representation\u201d, in \nthe sense of SureWin4U being legitimate, not a scam. Whether the correct figure \nVersion No 1: 14 Apr 2023 (11:26 hrs)\nChan Pik Sun v Wan Hoe Keet and others[2023] SGHC 96\n27was HK$201 million, or, say, HK$100 million, is not material to whether \nSureWin4U was legitimate and not a scam.\n86 On a related note, I accept that Ken and Sally knew that they had not \nearned the full amount of HK$201 million as at May 2022, but I do not find that \nthey decided to exaggerate the figure to induce others to invest in SureWin4U. \nI accept their evidence that the figure was provided by SureWin4U.42\n(3) The 99.8% class\n87 I find that the 99.8% class was conducted by Philip Ong, rather than by \nPeter, Ken, and Sally, as Sandra suggests. The classes which Sandra\u2019s \ndownlines Shelley Wong and Wujun attended were likewise conducted by \nPhilip Ong.\n88 Sandra believed in SureWin4U\u2019s 99.8% formula, and praised it \u2013 that is \nclear from what she said contemporaneously. From 1 July 2014, she told her \ndownline Yuan Jun:\nI learned in the winner project that I have 99.8% winning \nchances and I did win it.\nIt\u2019s believable. I hope more people will know this and have this \nblessing.43\n89 However, she went on to caution him against trying SureWin4U\u2019s \nmethod himself, for there was a risk of loss:\nIn fact, I don't recommend you go to the casino to play this \nthing. Because you don't have time for 1, 2, if I encounter that \n0.2, I am a little worried. Although he has 512 throws, he will \nlose with one stroke. This mentality is very important, so I am \nmore worried about you.\n42 Transcript, 16 August 2022, pages 24\u201327, 195\u2013200.\n432DBD 767\nVersion No 1: 14 Apr 2023 (11:26 hrs)\nChan Pik Sun v Wan Hoe Keet and others[2023] SGHC 96\n28\u2026\nSo, I don't think you need to keep going to the casino, is \nmeaningless\nFirst, no self-control ability. Secondly, may encounter the 0.2. \nThird, you don't have that much time.44\n90 Sandra recognised that although the 99.8% formula had a 99.8% win \nrate, there was a 0.2% or 1\/512 chance of loss.\n91 In similar vein, she told one Ms Feng on 5 July 2014:\nIf I strictly followed the teacher's method, I really swear to \nChairman Mao, I really have never lost before. I suggest you to \nkeep practicing in your home, practice every day, practice every \nday, and then see for yourself if you can encounter. I haven't \nencountered it anyway.\n\u2026\n512 rounds, it is hard not to win any. No.\nI sometimes do it with my opinion because I can read the cards. \nThis is hard to teach. If you have so many years of experience, \nmaybe you will also read the cards yourself.  This method \ncannot teach other people, because many do not know how to \ngamble and can only follow the teacher\u2019s methods.\n\u2026\nWhen there is a clash between my own methods and the \nteacher\u2019s methods, I will choose the teacher\u2019s methods.45\n92 There, she was talking about not having encountered the risk of loss. At \ntrial, she put this down to coincidence: \n\u2026 coincidentally, I won -- I won everytime. It was just \ncoincidence. But that doesn't mean that -- but it doesn't mean \nthat the method is correct, and it doesn't mean that I can win \nevery time.\n\u2026\n44 2DBD 776\u2013778.\n45 2DBD 670\u2013671.\nVersion No 1: 14 Apr 2023 (11:26 hrs)\nChan Pik Sun v Wan Hoe Keet and others[2023] SGHC 96\n29Yes, the fact is I have never lost.46\n93 The point is that at the time Sandra was well aware that there was a risk \nof loss; but she believed in the 99.8% formula, and sought to convince others of \nit.\n94 In her testimony, Sandra also said:\nI was misled by them, by all their falsehoods, whatever they had \nsaid were all false, they even said that publicly, so I was misled \nby all they said. They said that it was safe, it was legitimate, it \nwas stable, and they said that the winning risk was 99.8 per \ncent, and they said that we would 100 per cent win this. They \nsaid this openly, and I was cheated by them.47\n95 The evidence does not bear out Sandra\u2019s allegation that Ken, Sally, or \nSebastian ever said, \u201cwe would 100 per cent win this\u201d. She knew full well that \na 99.8% chance of winning was a 99.8% chance of winning, it was not a 100% \nchance of winning.\n96 On the evidence, I find that Sandra made her second tranche of \ninvestments not because of any false representations that she attributes to Ken, \nSally, or Sebastian, but because she was attracted by the returns promised by \nSureWin4U, and she believed in SureWin4 U\u2019s gambling methods, particularly \nafter attending the 99.8% class.\nSandra\u2019s third tranche investment\n97 The third tranche of Sandra\u2019s investments into SureWin4U happened in \nAugust 2014, shortly before the scheme collapsed in September 2014.\n46 Transcript, 5 May 2022, page 64.\n47 Transcript, 5 May 2022, page 18.\nVersion No 1: 14 Apr 2023 (11:26 hrs)\nChan Pik Sun v Wan Hoe Keet and others[2023] SGHC 96\n30(1) What Ken and Sally said after the Suntec Conference\n98 Sandra attributes various representations to Ken and Sally, but none of \nthem (nor all of them taken together) amount to a representation that \nSureWin4U was \u201csafe and profitable\u201d in the sense of the scheme being \nlegitimate, not a scam.\n(2) What Sebastian said to Sandra\n99 In her closing submissions, Sandra relies heavily on the following \nexchange of messages with Sebastian on 29 July 2014:\nSandra: I fully trust surewin\nI put almost all my money in their hands\nShould I do this?\n\u2026\u2026\nSebastian: Must see how u play. I also put all my money in. Not \nas much as u put la.\n100 Sandra asked Sebastian \u201cShould I do this?\u201d, having told him that she \nfully trusted SureWin4U and had \u201cput almost all my money in their hands\u201d. I \naccept that she was asking Sebastian if he thought SureWin4U could be trusted. \nSebastian\u2019s answer, however, was rather non-committal: \u201cMust see how u play. \nI also put all my money in. Not as much as u put la.\u201d His response, \u201cMust see \nhow u play\u201d was not a resounding endorsement of SureWin4U\u2019s \ntrustworthiness; rather, it means, \u201cit really depends on how you want to do these \nthings\u201d, as Sebastian explained at trial.48\n101 In her submissions, Sandra contends that Sebastian lied when he said, \u201cI \nalso put all my money in\u201d, for he had not literally put into SureWin4U every \n48 Transcript, 13 May 2022, pages 56\u201357. \nVersion No 1: 14 Apr 2023 (11:26 hrs)\nChan Pik Sun v Wan Hoe Keet and others[2023] SGHC 96\n31cent that he had. But that is not what Sebastian conveyed by his remark. He did \nnot mean that he had put in every cent that he had, and that is not what Sandra \nunderstood either. He said, \u201cI also put all my money in\u201d, in response to Sandra \nsaying that she had \u201cput almost all my money in their hands\u201d. His use of the \nword \u201calso\u201d indicates that he meant the same as Sandra: almost all his money, \nrather than literally all his money. I accept his explanation on this point.49\n102 In that exchange of messages, Sandra did not tell Sebastian what she \nnow claims to be the case: that she fully trusted SureWin4U because Ken and \nSally told her it was safe and profitable, that SureWin4U was legitimate, not a \nscam. Instead, she asked him, \u201cShould I do this\u201d.\n103 It is ironic that Sebastian\u2019s response was not specifically pleaded by \nSandra as a misrepresentation. If it had operated on her mind in inducing her to \nmake her third tranche of investments, one would have expected her to \nspecifically plead it, especially since the messages were in written form. Nor \ndid Sandra mention these messages in her AEIC. To top it off, in Sandra\u2019s \nopening statement, she indicated that her causes of action in misrepresentation \nwere being raised against Ken and Sally, but not Sebastian. I find that Sandra \ndid not rely on her exchange of messages with Sebastian as an assurance by \nSebastian that she could trust SureWin4U; she did not rely on that in making \nthe third tranche of her investments.\n49 Transcript, 13 May 2022, pages 50\u201351.\nVersion No 1: 14 Apr 2023 (11:26 hrs)\nChan Pik Sun v Wan Hoe Keet and others[2023] SGHC 96\n32(3) The 100% class\n104 Prior to the third tranche of Sandra\u2019s investments, she attended the 100% \nclass. That made her even more enthusiastic about SureWin4U and its gambling \nmethods, as shown by her messages on 17 July 2014 to Yuan Jun:50\nSandra: Just learned 100% yesterday, feeling great. I'm even \nmore excited that I couldn't sleep.\nNow I believe in this project even more, I will practice more, \nkeep it up.\nYuan: Did you test it out? you used small money to make big \nmoney?\nSandra: Of course. We test it out the day before in Macau\nYuan: Great, I want to learn it too Send me the website again\nSandra: This company is so great\n\u2026\u2026\nI have not returned to Hong Kong yet. I am practicing 100%.\n105 As Sandra said, she was \u201ceven more excited\u201d having learned the 100% \nformula, she had tested it out, and was practicing it; and she considered \nSureWin4U to be \u201cso great\u201d.\n106 In her evidence, Sandra did not provide a description of the 100% \nformula that she had tested and practised. Her case is that in fact SureWin4U \ndid not have a formula with a 100% chance of winning, but I do not believe that \nshe ever thought that SureWin4U had a 100% chance of winning. Significantly, \nin her 17 July 2014 messages to Yuan Jun (whom she had warned of the risk of \nloss earlier that month, when she only knew the 99.8% formula), she did not tell \nhim that the 100% formula gave SureWin4U a 100% chance of winning. I find \n50 2DBD 784, 787.\nVersion No 1: 14 Apr 2023 (11:26 hrs)\nChan Pik Sun v Wan Hoe Keet and others[2023] SGHC 96\n33she knew that there was still some risk of loss in SureWin4U\u2019s gambling \nmethods, but she nevertheless believed in those methods.\n107 Thus, Sandra\u2019s claim in relation to the Safe and Profitable \nRepresentation fails.\nThe second \u201cmain representation\u201d \u2013 the \u201cUS Property Representation\u201d\n108 The US Property Representation is formulated in Sandra\u2019s reply \nsubmissions as follows:51 \u201cthat investing in the US Property Package entitled \nher to title deeds to houses in Detroit\u201d. That is said to be false because \u201cSandra \ndid not receive the title deeds to any US property in respect of the US Property \nPackage.\u201d52 Sandra\u2019s complaint about the US Property Representation is thus \nthat SureWin4U did not keep its promise to give her title deeds to houses in \nDetroit. That, however, involves no false representation of fact. In Sandra\u2019s oral \nclosing submissions slides, at slide 18 \u2013 on \u201cThe Representations are statements \nof fact\u201d \u2013 it is merely asserted that \u201cThe US Property Representation that Sandra \nwill receive a title deed for each Detroit property is a statement of fact.\u201d \n[emphasis added] A statement that something \u201cwill\u201d happen in future, is not a \nstatement of fact \u2013 it is either a statement as to the future, or a promise. The only \nthing factual about the US Property Representation, is that it was a term of the \nUS Property Package that those who bought that package were entitled to a title \ndeed to a house in Detroit. There was nothing false in that: this was a term of \nthe US Property Package.\n109 Compounding Sandra\u2019s problems with this alleged representation, the \nSOC mentions the US Property Package as something Ken and Sally promoted \n51 Sandra\u2019s reply submissions, para 3.\n52 Sandra\u2019s closing submissions, para 249(b).\nVersion No 1: 14 Apr 2023 (11:26 hrs)\nChan Pik Sun v Wan Hoe Keet and others[2023] SGHC 96\n34(at para 53(d)\u2013(f) of the SOC). However, para 53(d)\u2013(f) of the SOC is not \nreferred to in para 73 of the SOC, where Sandra pleads why the representations \nshe complains about were false.\n110 The US Property Representation involves no false statement of fact \nmade by Ken, Sally, or Sebastian, and they did nothing fraudulent in that regard \neither.\n111 In buying the US Property Package, Sandra knew that it was a term of \nthat package that she was entitled to a title deed to a house in Detroit, but \nwhether she received that title deed would depend on whether SureWin4U kept \nits promise in that regard.\n112 Her claim against Ken, Sally, and Sebastian in relation to the US \nProperty Representation thus fails.\nThe third main representation \u2013 the \u201cShare Investment Representation\u201d\n113 Sandra\u2019s case in relation to the Share Investment Representation is beset \nwith the same problems. The representation is formulated in Sandra\u2019s reply \nsubmissions as follows:53 \u201cthat her monies invested under the Share Investment \nPackage would be used to acquire a company that was going to be listed on the \nSingapore Stock Exchange in October 2014 (the \u2018Share Investment \nRepresentation\u2019)\u201d. Sandra\u2019s complaint about this representation is that \nSureWin4U did not use her money to acquire any company that was going to \nbe listed in October 2014; instead, the scheme collapsed in September 2014. \nHowever, that involves no false representation of fact. A statement that \nsomething \u201cwould be\u201d done in the future, is not a statement of fact \u2013 it is either \n53 Sandra\u2019s reply submissions, para 3.\nVersion No 1: 14 Apr 2023 (11:26 hrs)\nChan Pik Sun v Wan Hoe Keet and others[2023] SGHC 96\n35a statement as to the future, or a promise. The only thing factual about the Share \nInvestment Representation, is that it was a term of the Share Investment Package \nthat those who bought that package would acquire an interest in a company that \nSureWin4U would be acquiring. There was nothing false in this: this was a term \nof the Share Investment Package.\n114 Again, Sandra\u2019s submissions involve a shift away from her pleaded case. \nShe pleads at para 58(a) of the SOC that Ken and Sally had represented that \n\u201cSureWin4U had plans to buy over a company that was going to be listed on the \nSingapore Stock Exchange in October 2014\u201d; this is said to be false (in para \n73(d) of the SOC) in that \u201cSureWin4U had no real plans to nor did it acquire a \nlisted company contrary to Ken and Sally\u2019s claims\u201d.\n115 The fact that SureWin4U collapsed before it could keep its promise to \nacquire a listed company, involves no false statement of fact on the part of Ken \nand Sally (or Sebastian), and there was nothing fraudulent in what Ken and Sally \n(or Sebastian) did in relation to the Share Investment Package. It was a term of \nthe Share Investment Package that SureWin4U would acquire a company that \nwas to be listed, but whether SureWin4U did acquire that company would \ndepend on whether SureWin4U kept its promise in that regard.\n116 Moreover, it does not follow that because SureWin4U did not acquire a \ncompany to be listed (if that is the case), that it had no real plans to do so \u2013 \nSandra has failed to prove this. Indeed, Sandra has not even proved that her \nmoney was not used by SureWin4U to acquire a company that was to be listed. \nThere is simply no evidence what SureWin4U did with the money it received \nfrom Sandra for the Share Investment Packages \u2013 SureWin4U may well have \nused it to acquire some company with a view of listing it.\nVersion No 1: 14 Apr 2023 (11:26 hrs)\nChan Pik Sun v Wan Hoe Keet and others[2023] SGHC 96\n36117 Slide 18 of Sandra\u2019s oral closing submissions slides involves a further \nshift \u2013 the representation is recast as being one \u201cthat Sandra\u2019s investment will \nbe used to acquire a particular target company (i.e. China Kunda Technology \nHoldings Ltd)\u201d. However, it was neither Sandra\u2019s pleaded case nor her evidence \nthat the particular target company was ever mentioned to her prior to her \npurchasing the Share Investment Packages.\n118 Sandra\u2019s case ranges from saying that SureWin4U had no intention to \nacquire \u201cany company that was to be listed\u201d,54 to saying that SureWin4U had no \nintention to acquire China Kunda Technology Holdings Ltd55 which was already \nlisted. I accept Ken\u2019s explanation that it was only after the collapse of \nSureWin4U that he came to know, from one of his downlines, that the intention \nwas to acquire China Kunda Technology Holdings Ltd.56\n119 The fact that China Kunda Technology Holdings Ltd was already listed, \ndoes not help Sandra\u2019s case. The SureWin4U June Sri Lanka Commitment \nChallenge57 document states: \u201cThe subsidiary of Surewin will be backdoor \nlisted on Singapore RTO before the end of 2014. Any buyer of the diamond \npackage can get the right of first refusal to subscribe for the internal shares of \nSurewin subsidiary, (500,000 YB).\u201d A \u201cbackdoor listing\u201d pursuant to an \u201cRTO\u201d \n(in the context, a reverse takeover) involves using one company to acquire \nanother that was already listed, thereby gaining listed status. This is consistent \nwith, as opposed to being inconsistent with, China Kunda Technology Holdings \nLtd already being listed.\n54 Sandra\u2019s closing submisions, para 249(c).\n55 Sandra\u2019s oral closing submission slide 18.\n56 Transcript, 16 August 2022, pages 95\u2013100.\n57 7AB 2149\u20132150. \nVersion No 1: 14 Apr 2023 (11:26 hrs)\nChan Pik Sun v Wan Hoe Keet and others[2023] SGHC 96\n37The fourth main representation \u2013 the \u201cHK No.1 Representation\u201d\n120 In the SOC, Sandra pleads that at the 1st Presidential Suite Meeting, \nSally told her:\n(a) even though Sandra had not achieved the top sales position in \nHong Kong, she was invited to the meeting because Ken and Sally had \ntold Peter Ong of Sandra\u2019s potential to become the top representative for \nHong Kong (para 51(b));\n(b) Sally introduced Sandra to Peter Ong as the \u201cnext top \nrepresentative for Hong Kong\u201d (para 51(c));\n(c) Sally encouraged Sandra to buy and sell more packages so that \nshe could become the next \u201cSally\u201d of Hong Kong (para 51(d)).\n121 Sandra further pleads that at the 2nd Presidential Suite Meeting, Ken and \nSally repeated their earlier representations at the 1st Presidential Suite Meeting \nand told Sandra that they saw potential in her and wanted to groom her to \nbecome Hong Kong\u2019s top representative (para 58(e)).\n122 In para 73 of the SOC, however, Sandra does not say that the above \nrepresentations were false; those paragraphs of the SOC are not mentioned in \npara 73.\n123 In her closing submissions, however, the \u201cHK No.1 Representation\u201d was \nportrayed as one of the four main actionable representations at the core of \nSandra\u2019s case. The representation is formulated in Sandra\u2019s reply submissions \nas follows:58 \u201cthat by investing 4 sets of the US Property and Share Investment \n58 Sandra\u2019s reply submissions, para 3.\nVersion No 1: 14 Apr 2023 (11:26 hrs)\nChan Pik Sun v Wan Hoe Keet and others[2023] SGHC 96\n38Packages, Sandra could become a \u2018Seven-Star Agent\u2019 and Ken and Sally would \ngroom her to become Hong Kong\u2019s top representative\u201d. That is said to be false \nin that \u201cDespite investing in the US Property and Share Investment Packages, \nSandra did not become Hong Kong\u2019s No.1 salesperson.\u201d59 Her submissions are \na departure from her pleaded case.\n124 In her oral closing submissions, at slide 18, Sandra asserts that \u201cThe HK \nNo.1 Representation that if Sandra purchased 4 US Property and 4 Share \nInvestment Packages, she would become Hong Kong\u2019s top salesperson with \nKen and Sally\u2019s grooming is a statement of fact as Ken and Sally had no such \nintention \u2013 SureWin4U was about to collapse!\u201d.\n125 I find that the HK No.1 Representation was never made by Ken and \nSally \u2013 they never said that if Sandra purchased 4 US Property and 4 Share \nInvestment Packages, she would become Hong Kong\u2019s top salesperson \n(whether with Ken and Sally\u2019s grooming or otherwise).\n126 In any event, this (if it had been said) would not have been a statement \nof fact; it would be a statement as to the future, at most a promise. But Ken and \nSally were in no position to promise that Sandra would become Hong Kong\u2019s \ntop salesperson (and Sandra knew that) \u2013 that would depend on how she did, \nrelative to others in Hong Kong. If someone else in Hong Kong outperformed \nSandra, Sandra would then not have become Hong Kong\u2019s top salesperson.\n127 In any event, Sandra has failed to prove that she had not become Hong \nKong\u2019s top salesperson \u2013 on the evidence, she may well have become that by \nthe time of SureWin4U\u2019s collapse.\n59 Sandra\u2019s closing submissions, para 249(d).\nVersion No 1: 14 Apr 2023 (11:26 hrs)\nChan Pik Sun v Wan Hoe Keet and others[2023] SGHC 96\n39128 For completeness, I find that there was nothing false or fraudulent in \nwhat Ken, Sally, or Sebastian said to Sandra about her performance and \npotential in the context of SureWin4U.\nThe aftermath of SureWin4U\u2019s collapse\n129 Sandra\u2019s conduct in the aftermath of SureWin4U\u2019s collapse shows that \nSandra had not relied on the representations she alleges Ken, Sally, and \nSebastian had made to her, in investing into SureWin4U.\n130 First, just a few days after the collapse, there is the following exchange \nof messages on 14 September 2014 between her and her upline Mr Zhou Jing \nHua:\nZhou: I am very sorry! Take care! A healthy body is your asset!\nSandra: It's OK, I knew the risk. I will face it.\nNext time work every day in a casino in Macau, haha.\nZhou: You're a manly lady, you're broad-minded!\nI heard that Ken, Sally have gone to Hong Kong. You can meet \nthem and give them some advice.\nSandra: That's great, thank you.\n[emphasis added]\n131 There are two points of note:\n(a) Sandra told Mr Zhou: \u201cIt\u2019s OK, I knew the risk, I will face it.\u201d \nShe did not say she thought her participation in SureWin4U was free of \nrisk, and she did not say she thought it was free of risk because Ken and \nSally told her SureWin4U was \u201csafe and profitable\u201d.\n(b) Sandra did not say that she had invested in SureWin4U because \nof representations made by Ken and Sally (and Sebastian) \u2013 instead, \nVersion No 1: 14 Apr 2023 (11:26 hrs)\nChan Pik Sun v Wan Hoe Keet and others[2023] SGHC 96\n40when Mr Zhou suggested that she can meet Ken and Sally (who have \ngone to Hong Kong where Sandra was) and give them some advice, she \nsaid, \u201cThat\u2019s great, thank you.\u201d\n132 That is not the behaviour of someone who thought that Ken and Sally \nhad defrauded her, or that they had made false representations which had \ninduced her to invest in SureWin4U and consequently lose millions of dollars.\n133 Second, there is an exchange with Sally on 17 September 2014 where \nSally asked Sandra whether the latter had given her downlines any guarantees, \nand told her that that she cannot do so. In response, Sandra said, \u201cI have not \nguarantee them one bit... I told them there are risks but the problem is that they \ntrust me...\u201d [emphasis added]. What Sandra said contemporaneously \u2013 that she \nhad told her downlines that there are risks \u2013 is fundamentally inconsistent with \nher present position that she thought her participation in SureWin4U was free \nof risk because Ken and Sally (and Sebastian) had assured her that SureWin4U \nwas \u201csafe and profitable\u201d. She knew there were risks, and she told her downlines \nas much. Sandra did not say to Sally that she had invested in SureWin4U \nbecause of representations that Ken, Sally, or Sebastian had made to her.\n134 Third, in October 2014 Sandra came to Singapore and stayed at Ken and \nSally\u2019s home for about a week. At that time, a group of ten investors, including \nSebastian and Sandra, went to the Marina Bay Sands Casino with $148,000 in \ncapital provided by Ken and Sally to attempt to win money using the 100% \nformula. Sandra still believed in SureWin4U\u2019s 100% formula (as did Ken, Sally, \nand Sebastian), she went to live with Ken and Sally, and she was part of this \neffort with Sebastian (using Ken and Sally\u2019s money) \u2013 she evidently did not \nthink then, that they had defrauded her or made false representations that had \ninduced her into investing in SureWin4U.\nVersion No 1: 14 Apr 2023 (11:26 hrs)\nChan Pik Sun v Wan Hoe Keet and others[2023] SGHC 96\n41135 I find that Ken and Sally provided the $148,000 capital because they too \nbelieved that the 100% formula could be used to win money at a casino, and \nSebastian believed that too. I do not believe they spent that sum to create the \nimpression that they were innocent parties. At that time, they were not facing \nany allegations that they were fraudulent, or in cahoots with the Ong brothers.\n136 Fourth, in May 2015 Sandra had the following exchange with Yuan Jun:\nWhy are ken and sally accused? It's because they now earn \nabout 50 million Singapore dollars in this project Now they \ndon't want to spit out the money, so everyone is forcing them to \ncatch them and return the money to us.\n\u2026\nThank you for willing to reply me. You're right, it's my fault and \nI don't blame you for your reaction. I just wanted good for \neveryone in the first place. I also studied a lot and then put in \nthe money. I didn't expect it was such a big scam. I didn't run \naway and chose to stay with everyone to find solutions together. \nBut now I'm not the one to take your money, I'm also the victim. \nYou lost 3 million and I lost 2 million. You all know Mijian is \nnow 54 years old and lost all of his savings. He is now in debt. \nEvery time I think of this, I'm terribly guilty and I can't sleep at \nnight. The good relationships we used to have is now gone, and \nthis makes me very sad.\n137 There, Sandra said the reason for going after Ken and Sally was because \nthey had made money, while others had lost money; she did not say that Ken \nand Sally had made false representations that had induced her and others to \ninvest in SureWin4U. She further said that it was her fault; she had studied a lot \nand then put in the money, but she didn\u2019t expect that it was such a big scam. \nShe did not blame Ken and Sally for having induced her to invest in SureWin4U \nby the \u201csafe and profitable\u201d representation, or other representations. Instead, she \nsaid it was her fault that others had lost money, and she felt terribly guilty.\nVersion No 1: 14 Apr 2023 (11:26 hrs)\nChan Pik Sun v Wan Hoe Keet and others[2023] SGHC 96\n42138 The evidence does not show that Sandra invested in SureWin4U because \nof any false representations of fact made by Ken, Sally, or Sebastian. The picture \nwhich emerges instead is:\n(a) Sandra was attracted by the lucrative returns SureWin4U \npromised, which she had started receiving on her initial packages.\n(b) To her, there was no risk in purchasing her initial packages \nbecause of SureWin4U\u2019s \u201cmoney back guarantee\u201d if she could disprove \nthe 99.8% formula;\n(c) She attended the 99.8% and 100% classes, and believed in \nSureWin4U\u2019s gambling methods, which she had successfully tried \nherself;\n(d) She did not believe that investing in SureWin4U was free of risk \n\u2013 she knew there was a risk in SureWin4U\u2019s gambling methods; she \nknew there was a risk in investing in SureWin4U, and said \u201cI knew the \nrisk. I will face it.\u201d She said she told her downlines that there were risks.\n(e) In getting her downlines to invest, Sandra never told them about \nany representations made by Ken, Sally, or Sebastian; she told them \nabout the returns promised by SureWin4U, SureWin4U\u2019s gambling \nmethods, SureWin4U\u2019s brochure, and her belief in SureWin4U.\n(f) Sandra\u2019s conduct in the aftermath of SureWin4U\u2019s collapse is \ninconsistent with her case that she had invested because of false \nrepresentations made to her by Ken, Sally, or Sebastian.\n139 SureWin4U had exaggerated the extent of Ken and Sally\u2019s earnings, as \npresented at the Suntec Conference, and Ken and Sally must take some \nVersion No 1: 14 Apr 2023 (11:26 hrs)\nChan Pik Sun v Wan Hoe Keet and others[2023] SGHC 96\n43responsibility for that, for they knew that their earnings up to that point were \nnot that much. However, I find that if Ken and Sally\u2019s earnings had been \naccurately represented by SureWin4U, it would have made no difference to \nSandra\u2019s investment decisions.\n140 Further, many of the representations Sandra sues on are not even \nstatements of fact, but statements as to the future, or promises, or statements of \nopinion.\n141 I also generally find that Ken, Sally, and Sebastian were not fraudulent \nin the sense of them having made statements knowing they were false, or not \ngenuinely believing in the truth of what was said (I will discuss this further in \nrelation to"}
