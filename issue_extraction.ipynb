      "constituted a continuing breach of that constructive trust.\n",
      "There was no serious objection to these amendments and we could see no reasons why they should\n",

      "relevant period of limitation current at the date of the issue of the writ has expired. There was really\n",
      "no issue on the amendments proposed. The point in issue was whether, on the assumption that the\n",

      "of the appellant`s causes of action is for money paid under a mistake and falls within the ambit of this\n",

      "under the mistaken assumption that respondent`s wife, Lim, had an interest in Lot 1606. That mistake\n",
      "was one relating to the ownership of property and was a mistake of law: see Bingham v Bingham 1\n",

      "Lim did not have an interest in Lot 1606, contrary to previous assumption on the part of Tan. It also\n",
      "followed from this that the consideration for which the sum of US$642,451.04 was paid to Liu only\n",
      "failed when that fact was established. The cause of action to recover the sum paid as money had\n",
      "and received or as money paid under a mistake of law therefore accrued only in February 1998, when\n",
      "the Court of Appeal delivered its judgment, and the claim is thus not time-barred.\n",
      "Counsel for the appellant relied on the recent decision of the House of Lords in Kleinwort Benson Ltd\n",
      "v Lincoln City Council [1998] 4 All ER 513[1998] 3 WLR 1095, which abrogated the long-established\n",

      "an action by a bank to recover money paid to local authorities under certain swap agreements, which\n",
      "following the decision of the House of Lords in Hazell v Hammersmith and Fulham London\n",
      "Borough Council [1992] 2 AC 1 were held to be ultra vires and void. In Kleinwort Benson , it was\n",
      "held that the rule, under which money paid under a mistake of law is not recoverable in restitution\n",
      "should no longer be part of the law, and consequently money paid under a mistake, whether of fact or\n",
      "law, is recoverable. It was further held that money paid under a mistake of law is recoverable, even\n",
      "where the money has been paid under a settled understanding of the law, which is subsequently\n",
      "departed from by judicial decision or where the payment has been received by recipient under an\n",
      "honest belief of an entitlement to retain the money. Such discovery occurs only when the existing law\n",
      "is changed by a later decision of the court.\n",
      "Reverting to the instant case, we are not concerned, at this interlocutory stage, to inquire whether in\n",
      "truth there was a mistake and whether such mistake was one of fact or law. The burden is on the\n",

      "discovered earlier, and that the period of limitation began to run only from that date. On this basis,\n",
      "the appellant`s action for the recovery of the moneys is not time-barred. In our opinion, this is not a\n",
      "plain and obvious case of an action being barred by Limitation Act, and the claim should not have\n",
      "been struck out at this stage. The entire issue: whether the action is time-barred would have to be\n",
      "determined at the trial.\n",
      "Constructive trust or other proprietary remedy\n",
      "Before us it was argued on behalf of the appellant that she has a good arguable case that a\n",
      "constructive trust as a remedy is available to her as Tan`s executrix to recover the money from Liu.\n",
      "The money was paid to Liu under a mistake, and although the mere receipt of the money in ignorance\n",
      "of the mistake did not give rise to a trust in favour of Tan at that time, the retention of the money by\n",
      "Liu after the mistake was discovered (ie after the Court of Appeal had delivered its decision) gave rise\n",

      "limitation applies to an action by a beneficiary under a trust to recover from the trustee trust\n",

      "The authority primarily relied upon by the appellant in this regard is Chase Manhattan Bank NA v\n",
      "Israel-British Bank (London) Ltd [1981] Ch 105. There, the plaintiffs in July 1974 by mistake paid\n",
      "the defendants some o2m twice. Very soon after the payment, the defendants became aware of the\n",
      "mistake but did not take any step to refund the sum. In the following month, the defendants went\n",
      "into liquidation. In an action brought to recover the money, the plaintiffs sought to trace and recover\n",

      "Again, at this interlocutory stage, we would refrain from expressing any view whether in Singapore\n",
      "the court would, in appropriate circumstances, impose a constructive trust as a remedy. Quite apart\n",
      "from that, the success or otherwise of the appellant`s arguments on this issue must depend, to a\n",
      "large extent, on the circumstances in which the sum of US$642,451.04 was paid by Tan to Liu and\n",

      "In that case, the plaintiff was the owner of the copyright in a special type of collar-attached shirt for\n",
      "use by the clergy. In 1970, she commenced proceedings against D Ltd for infringement of the\n",

      "proceedings. The plaintiff failed in that action, the court holding that there was no infringement of the\n",
      "plaintiff`s copyright, and that decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal. In 1975, the plaintiff\n",
      "issued a writ against W Ltd, alleging infringement of copyright in relation to the same shirt and\n",
      "claiming relief by way of declaration, injunction, damages and delivery up of infringing copies. On the\n",

      "advance a contention. There was a sufficient identity of parties in the two sets\n",
      "of proceedings, but the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council held that the\n",
      "statement of claim in the second action should be struck out as being an abuse\n",
      "of the process of the court because it was founded on a contention which ought\n",
      "to have been advanced in the first action, but which had not been. Mr Skone\n",
      "James ... urged that there was no great difference between adding contentions\n",
      "and adding parties.\n",
      "It seems to me that the difference is very considerable ... [I]f Mr Skone James\n",
      "is right, the failure to join a possible defendant in the chain may mean that,\n",
      "whatever additional evidence or acquisition of riches subsequently emerges,\n",
      "that possible defendant cannot be sued in subsequent proceedings ...\n",
      "... I can well see the justice of refusing to permit a plaintiff who has failed to\n",

      "in order to take that point. What I cannot see is the justice of refusing to\n",
      "permit a plaintiff to sue a person at all because the plaintiff failed to join him as\n",
      "a defendant in other proceedings against another person. Such a failure may\n",
      "provide material for cross-examination in the second proceedings, and it may\n",
      "also sound in costs, especially if the second proceedings have the same result\n",
      "as the first; but the drastic step of striking out the proceedings is quite another\n",
      "matter.\n",
      "There is yet another reason for holding that the present action is not an abuse of the court`s\n",
      "process. One of the appellant`s claims is that the sum in question was paid to Liu under a mistake of\n",
      "law and the mistake was discovered only upon the Court of Appeal delivering its judgment. Now, this\n",
